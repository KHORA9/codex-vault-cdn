If, in any part of it, I have actually deflected from the tone of true\r\npatriotism and nationality, I am unable to perceive the fault. What I have\r\ncommitted to paper is but a fair reflex of the honest and long-settled\r\nconvictions of my heart.\r\n\r\nIn writing this book, it has been no part of my purpose to cast unmerited\r\nopprobrium upon slaveholders, or to display any special friendliness or\r\nsympathy for the blacks. I have considered my subject more particularly\r\nwith reference to its economic aspects as regards the whites--not with\r\nreference, except in a very slight degree, to its humanitarian or\r\nreligious aspects. To the latter side of the question, Northern writers\r\nhave already done full and timely justice. The genius of the North has\r\nalso most ably and eloquently discussed the subject in the form of novels.\r\nYankee wives have written the most popular anti-slavery literature of the\r\nday. Against this I have nothing to say; it is all well enough for women\r\nto give the fictions of slavery; men should give the facts.\r\n\r\nI trust that my friends and fellow-citizens of the South will read this\r\nbook--nay, proud as any Southerner though I am, I entreat, I beg of them\r\nto do so. And as the work, considered with reference to its author's\r\nnativity, is a novelty--the South being my birth-place and my home, and my\r\nancestry having resided there for more than a century--so I indulge the\r\nhope that its reception by my fellow-Southrons will also be novel; that is\r\nto say, that they will receive it, as it is offered, in a reasonable and\r\nfriendly spirit, and that they will read it and reflect upon it as an\r\nhonest and faithful endeavor to treat a subject of enormous import,\r\nwithout rancor or prejudice, by one who naturally comes within the pale of\r\ntheir own sympathies.\r\n\r\nAn irrepressibly active desire to do something to elevate the South to an\r\nhonorable and powerful position among the enlightened quarters of the\r\nglobe, has been the great leading principle that has actuated me in the\r\npreparation of the present volume; and so well convinced am I that the\r\nplan which I have proposed is the only really practical one for achieving\r\nthe desired end, that I earnestly hope to see it prosecuted with energy\r\nand zeal, until the Flag of Freedom shall wave triumphantly alike over the\r\nvalleys of Virginia and the mounds of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nH.

elaborate\r\nethnographical essay, to establish peculiarities of difference, mental,\r\nmoral, and physical, in the great family of man. Neither is it our design\r\nto launch into a philosophical disquisition on the laws and principles of\r\nlight and darkness, with a view of educing any additional evidence of the\r\nfact, that as a general rule, the rays of the sun are more fructifying and\r\ncongenial than the shades of night. Nor yet is it our purpose, by writing\r\na formal treatise on ethics, to draw a broad line of distinction between\r\nright and wrong, to point out the propriety of morality and its advantages\r\nover immorality, nor to waste time in pressing a universally admitted\r\ntruism--that virtue is preferable to vice. Self-evident truths require no\r\nargumentative demonstration.\r\n\r\nWhat we mean to do is simply this: to take a survey of the relative\r\nposition and importance of the several states of this confederacy, from\r\nthe adoption of the national compact; and when, of two sections of the\r\ncountry starting under the same auspices, and with equal natural\r\nadvantages, we find the one rising to a degree of almost unexampled power\r\nand eminence, and the other sinking into a state of comparative\r\nimbecility and obscurity, it is our determination to trace out the causes\r\nwhich have led to the elevation of the former, and the depression of the\r\nlatter, and to use our most earnest and honest endeavors to utterly\r\nextirpate whatever opposes the progress and prosperity of any portion of\r\nthe union.\r\n\r\nThis survey we have already made; we have also instituted an impartial\r\ncomparison between the cardinal sections of the country, north, south,\r\neast, and west; and as a true hearted southerner, whose ancestors have\r\nresided in North Carolina between one and two hundred years, and as one\r\nwho would rather have his native clime excel than be excelled, we feel\r\nconstrained to confess that we are deeply abashed and chagrined at the\r\ndisclosures of the comparison thus instituted. At the time of the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, in 1789, we commenced an even race with the North.\r\nAll things considered, if either the North or the South had the advantage,\r\nit was the latter. In proof of this, let us introduce a few statistics,\r\nbeginning with the states of\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK AND VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, when the first census was taken, New York contained 340,120\r\ninhabitants; at the same time the population of Virginia was 748,308,\r\nbeing more than twice the number of New York. Just sixty years afterward,\r\nas we learn from the census of 1850, New York had a population of\r\n3,097,394; while that of Virginia was only 1,421,661, being less than half\r\nthe number of New York! In 1791, the exports of New York amounted to\r\n$2,505,465; the exports of Virginia amounted to $3,130,865. In 1852, the\r\nexports of New York amounted to $87,484,456; the exports of Virginia,\r\nduring the same year, amounted to only $2,724,657. In 1790, the imports of\r\nNew York and Virginia were about equal; in 1853, the imports of New York\r\namounted to the enormous sum of $178,270,999; while those of Virginia, for\r\nthe same period, amounted to the pitiful sum of only $399,004. In 1850,\r\nthe products of manufactures, mining and the mechanic arts in New York\r\namounted to $237,597,249; those of Virginia amounted to only $29,705,387.\r\nAt the taking of the last census, the value of real and personal property\r\nin Virginia, including negroes, was $391,646,438; that of New York,\r\nexclusive of any monetary valuation of human beings, was $1,080,309,216.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1856, the real and personal estate assessed in the City of\r\nNew-York amounted in valuation to $511,740,491, showing that New-York City\r\nalone is worth far more than the whole State of Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhat says one of Virginia's own sons? He still lives; hear him speak. Says\r\nGov. Wise:\r\n\r\n\"It may be painful, but nevertheless, profitable, to recur occasionally to\r\nthe history of the past; to listen to the admonitions of experience, and\r\nlearn lessons of wisdom from the efforts and actions of those who have\r\npreceded us in the drama of human life. The records of former days show\r\nthat at a period not very remote, Virginia stood pre-eminently the first\r\ncommercial State in the Union; when her commerce exceeded in amount that\r\nof all the New England States combined; when the City of Norfolk owned\r\nmore than one hundred trading ships, and her direct foreign trade exceeded\r\nthat of the City of New-York, now the centre of trade and the great\r\nemporium of North America. At the period of the war of independence, the\r\ncommerce of Virginia was four times larger than that of New-York.\"\r\n\r\nThe cash value of all the farms, farming implements and machinery in\r\nVirginia, in 1850, was $223,423,315; the value of the same in New-York, in\r\nthe same year, was $576,631,568. In about the same ratio does the value of\r\nthe agricultural products and live stock of New-York exceed the value of\r\nthe agricultural products and live stock of Virginia. But we will pursue\r\nthis humiliating comparison no further. With feelings mingled with\r\nindignation and disgust, we turn from the picture, and will now pay our\r\nrespects to\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS AND NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, Massachusetts contained 378,717 inhabitants; in the same year\r\nNorth Carolina contained 393,751; in 1850, the population of Massachusetts\r\nwas 994,514, all freemen; while that of North Carolina was only 869,039,\r\nof whom 288,548 were slaves. Massachusetts has an area of only 7,800\r\nsquare miles; the area of North Carolina is 50,704 square miles, which,\r\nthough less than Virginia, is considerably larger than the State of\r\nNew-York. Massachusetts and North Carolina each have a harbor, Boston and\r\nBeaufort, which harbors, with the States that back them, are, by nature,\r\npossessed of about equal capacities and advantages for commercial and\r\nmanufacturing enterprise. Boston has grown to be the second commercial\r\ncity in the Union; her ships, freighted with the useful and unique\r\ninventions and manufactures of her ingenious artisans and mechanics, and\r\nbearing upon their stalwart arms the majestic flag of our country, glide\r\ntriumphantly through the winds and over the waves of every ocean. She has\r\ndone, and is now doing, great honor to herself, her State and the nation,\r\nand her name and fame are spoken with reverence in the remotest regions of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nHow is it with Beaufort, in North Carolina, whose harbor is said to be the\r\nsafest and most commodious anywhere to be found on the Atlantic coast\r\nsouth of the harbor of New-York, and but little inferior to that? Has\r\nanybody ever heard of her? Do the masts of her ships ever cast a shadow on\r\nforeign waters? Upon what distant or benighted shore have her merchants\r\nand mariners ever hoisted our national ensign, or spread the arts of\r\ncivilization and peaceful industry? What changes worthy of note have taken\r\nplace in the physical features of her superficies since \"the evening and\r\nthe morning were the third day?\" But we will make no further attempt to\r\ndraw a comparison between the populous, wealthy, and renowned city of\r\nBoston and the obscure, despicable little village of Beaufort, which,\r\nnotwithstanding \"the placid bosom of its deep and well-protected harbor,\"\r\nhas no place in the annals or records of the country, and has scarcely\r\never been heard of fifty miles from home.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, the exports of Massachusetts amounted to $16,895,304, and her\r\nimports to $41,367,956; during the same time, and indeed during all the\r\ntime, from the period of the formation of the government up to the year\r\n1853, inclusive, the exports and imports of North Carolina were so utterly\r\ninsignificant that we are ashamed to record them. In 1850, the products of\r\nmanufactures, mining and the mechanic arts in Massachusetts, amounted to\r\n$151,137,145; those of North Carolina, to only $9,111,245. In 1856, the\r\nproducts of these industrial pursuits in Massachusetts had increased to\r\nsomething over $288,000,000, a sum more than twice the value of the entire\r\ncotton crop of all the Southern States! In 1850, the cash value of all the\r\nfarms, farming implements and machinery in Massachusetts, was\r\n$112,285,931; the value of the same in North Carolina, in the same year,\r\nwas only $71,823,298. In 1850, the value of all the real and personal\r\nestate in Massachusetts, without recognizing property in man, or setting a\r\nmonetary price on the head of a single citizen, white or black, amounted\r\nto $573,342,286; the value of the same in North Carolina, including\r\nnegroes, amounted to only $226,800,472. In 1856, the real and personal\r\nestate assessed in the City of Boston amounted in valuation to within a\r\nfraction of $250,000,000, showing conclusively that so far as dollars and\r\ncents are concerned, that single city could buy the whole State of North\r\nCarolina, and by right of purchase, if sanctioned by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and by State Constitutions, hold her as a province. In\r\n1850, there were in Massachusetts 1,861 native white and free colored\r\npersons over twenty years of age who could not read and write; in the\r\nsame year, the same class of persons in North Carolina numbered 80,083;\r\nwhile her 288,548 slaves were, by legislative enactments, kept in a state\r\nof absolute ignorance and unconditional subordination.\r\n\r\nHoping, however, and believing, that a large majority of the most\r\nrespectable and patriotic citizens of North Carolina have resolved, or\r\nwill soon resolve, with unyielding purpose, to cast aside the great\r\nobstacle that impedes their progress, and bring into action a new policy\r\nwhich will lead them from poverty and ignorance to wealth and intellectual\r\ngreatness, and which will shield them not only from the rebukes of their\r\nown consciences, but also from the just reproaches of the civilized world,\r\nwe will, for the present, in deference to their feelings, forbear the\r\nfurther enumeration of these degrading disparities, and turn our attention\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nAn old gentleman, now residing in Charleston, told us, but a few months\r\nsince, that he had a distinct recollection of the time when Charleston\r\nimported foreign fabrics for the Philadelphia trade, and when, on a\r\ncertain occasion, his mother went into a store on Market-street to select\r\na silk dress for herself, the merchant, unable to please her fancy,\r\npersuaded her to postpone the selection for a few days, or until the\r\narrival of a new stock of superb styles and fashions which he had recently\r\npurchased in the metropolis of South Carolina. This was all very proper.\r\nCharleston had a spacious harbor, a central position, and a mild climate;\r\nand from priority of settlement and business connections, to say nothing\r\nof other advantages, she enjoyed greater facilities for commercial\r\ntransactions than Philadelphia. She had a right to get custom wherever she\r\ncould find it, and in securing so valuable a customer as the Quaker City,\r\nshe exhibited no small degree of laudable enterprise. But why did she not\r\nmaintain her supremacy? If the answer to this query is not already in the\r\nreader's mind, it will suggest itself before he peruses the whole of this\r\nwork. For the present, suffice it to say, that the cause of her shameful\r\ninsignificance and decline is essentially the same that has thrown every\r\nother Southern city and State in the rear of progress, and rendered them\r\ntributary, in a commercial and manufacturing point of view, almost\r\nentirely tributary, to the more sagacious and enterprising States and\r\ncities of the North.\r\n\r\nA most unfortunate day was that for the Palmetto State, and indeed for the\r\nwhole South, when the course of trade was changed, and she found herself\r\nthe retailer of foreign and domestic goods, imported and vended by\r\nwholesale merchants at the North. Philadelphia ladies no longer look to\r\nthe South for late fashions, and fine silks and satins; no Quaker dame now\r\nwears drab apparel of Charleston importation. Like all other\r\n_niggervilles_ in our disreputable part of the confederacy, the commercial\r\nemporium of South Carolina is sick and impoverished; her silver cord has\r\nbeen loosed; her golden bowl has been broken; and her unhappy people,\r\nwithout proper or profitable employment, poor in pocket, and few in\r\nnumber, go mourning or loafing about the streets. Her annual importations\r\nare actually less now than they were a century ago, when South Carolina\r\nwas the second commercial province on the continent, Virginia being the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, as we learn from Mr. Benton's \"Thirty Years' View,\" the foreign\r\nimports into Charleston were $2,662,000; in 1855, they amounted to only\r\n$1,750,000! In 1854, the imports into Philadelphia, which, in foreign\r\ntrade, ranks at present but fourth among the commercial cities of the\r\nunion, were $21,963,021. In 1850, the products of manufactures, mining,\r\nand the mechanic arts, in Pennsylvania, amounted to $155,044,910; the\r\nproducts of the same in South Carolina, amounted to only $7,063,513.\r\n\r\nAs shown by the census report of 1850, which was prepared under the\r\nsuperintendence of a native of South Carolina, who certainly will not be\r\nsuspected of injustice to his own section of the country, the Southern\r\nstates, the cash value of all the farms, farming implements, and machinery\r\nin Pennsylvania, was $422,598,640; the value of the same in South\r\nCarolina, in the same year, was only $86,518,038. From a compendium of the\r\nsame census, we learn that the value of all the real and personal property\r\nin Pennsylvania, actual property, no slaves, amounted to $729,144,998; the\r\nvalue of the same in South Carolina, including the estimated--we were\r\nabout to say fictitious--value of 384,925 negroes, amounted to only\r\n$288,257,694. We have not been able to obtain the figures necessary to\r\nshow the exact value of the real and personal estate in Philadelphia, but\r\nthe amount is estimated to be not less than $300,000,000; and as, in 1850,\r\nthere were 408,762 free inhabitants in the single city of Philadelphia,\r\nagainst 283,544 of the same class, in the whole state of South Carolina,\r\nit is quite evident that the former is more powerful than the latter, and\r\nfar ahead of her in all the elements of genuine and permanent superiority.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, in 1850, the annual income of public schools amounted to\r\n$1,348,249; the same in South Carolina, in the same year, amounted to only\r\n$200,000; in the former state there were 393 libraries other than private,\r\nin the latter only 26; in Pennsylvania 310 newspapers and periodicals were\r\npublished, circulating 84,898,672 copies annually; in South Carolina only\r\n46 newspapers and periodicals were published, circulating but 7,145,930\r\ncopies per annum.\r\n\r\nThe incontrovertible facts we have thus far presented are, we think, amply\r\nsufficient, both in number and magnitude, to bring conviction to the mind\r\nof every candid reader, that there is something wrong, socially,\r\npolitically and morally wrong, in the policy under which the South has so\r\nlong loitered and languished. Else, how is it that the North, under the\r\noperations of a policy directly the opposite of ours, has surpassed us in\r\nalmost everything great and good, and left us standing before the world,\r\nan object of merited reprehension and derision?\r\n\r\nFor one, we are heartily ashamed of the inexcusable weakness, inertia and\r\ndilapidation everywhere so manifest throughout our native section; but the\r\nblame properly attaches itself to an usurping minority of the people, and\r\nwe are determined that it shall rest where it belongs. More on this\r\nsubject, however, after a brief but general survey of the inequalities and\r\ndisparities that exist between those two grand divisions of the country,\r\nwhich, without reference to the situation that any part of their territory\r\nbears to the cardinal points, are every day becoming more familiarly known\r\nby the appropriate appellation of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE AND THE SLAVE STATES.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well known to every intelligent Southerner that we are\r\ncompelled to go to the North for almost every article of utility and\r\nadornment, from matches, shoepegs and paintings up to cotton-mills,\r\nsteamships and statuary; that we have no foreign trade, no princely\r\nmerchants, nor respectable artists; that, in comparison with the free\r\nstates, we contribute nothing to the literature, polite arts and\r\ninventions of the age; that, for want of profitable employment at home,\r\nlarge numbers of our native population find themselves necessitated to\r\nemigrate to the West, whilst the free states retain not only the larger\r\nproportion of those born within their own limits, but induce, annually,\r\nhundreds of thousands of foreigners to settle and remain amongst them;\r\nthat almost everything produced at the North meets with ready sale, while,\r\nat the same time, there is no demand, even among our own citizens, for the\r\nproductions of Southern industry; that, owing to the absence of a proper\r\nsystem of business amongst us, the North becomes, in one way or another,\r\nthe proprietor and dispenser of all our floating wealth, and that we are\r\ndependent on Northern capitalists for the means necessary to build our\r\nrailroads, canals and other public improvements; that if we want to visit\r\na foreign country, even though it may lie directly South of us, we find\r\nno convenient way of getting there except by taking passage through a\r\nNorthern port; and that nearly all the profits arising from the exchange\r\nof commodities, from insurance and shipping offices, and from the thousand\r\nand one industrial pursuits of the country, accrue to the North, and are\r\nthere invested in the erection of those magnificent cities and stupendous\r\nworks of art which dazzle the eyes of the South, and attest the\r\nsuperiority of free institutions!\r\n\r\nThe North is the Mecca of our merchants, and to it they must and do make\r\ntwo pilgrimages per annum--one in the spring and one in the fall. All our\r\ncommercial, mechanical, manufactural, and literary supplies come from\r\nthere. We want Bibles, brooms, buckets and books, and we go to the North;\r\nwe want pens, ink, paper, wafers and envelopes, and we go to the North; we\r\nwant shoes, hats, handkerchiefs, umbrellas and pocket knives, and we go to\r\nthe North; we want furniture, crockery, glassware and pianos, and we go to\r\nthe North; we want toys, primers, school books, fashionable apparel,\r\nmachinery, medicines, tombstones, and a thousand other things, and we go\r\nto the North for them all. Instead of keeping our money in circulation at\r\nhome, by patronizing our own mechanics, manufacturers, and laborers, we\r\nsend it all away to the North, and there it remains; it never falls into\r\nour hands again.\r\n\r\nIn one way or another we are more or less subservient to the North every\r\nday of our lives. In infancy we are swaddled in Northern muslin; in\r\nchildhood we are humored with Northern gewgaws; in youth we are instructed\r\nout of Northern books; at the age of maturity we sow our \"wild oats\" on\r\nNorthern soil; in middle-life we exhaust our wealth, energies and talents\r\nin the dishonorable vocation of entailing our dependence on our children\r\nand on our children's children, and, to the neglect of our own interests\r\nand the interests of those around us, in giving aid and succor to every\r\ndepartment of Northern power; in the decline of life we remedy our\r\neye-sight with Northern spectacles, and support our infirmities with\r\nNorthern canes; in old age we are drugged with Northern physic; and,\r\nfinally, when we die, our inanimate bodies, shrouded in Northern cambric,\r\nare stretched upon the bier, borne to the grave in a Northern carriage,\r\nentombed with a Northern spade, and memorized with a Northern slab!\r\n\r\nBut it can hardly be necessary to say more in illustration of this unmanly\r\nand unnational dependence, which is so glaring that it cannot fail to be\r\napparent to even the most careless and superficial observer. All the world\r\nsees, or ought to see, that in a commercial, mechanical, manufactural,\r\nfinancial, and literary point of view, we are as helpless as babes; that,\r\nin comparison with the Free States, our agricultural resources have been\r\ngreatly exaggerated, misunderstood and mismanaged; and that, instead of\r\ncultivating among ourselves a wise policy of mutual assistance and\r\nco-operation with respect to individuals, and of self-reliance with\r\nrespect to the South at large, instead of giving countenance and\r\nencouragement to the industrial enterprises projected in our midst, and\r\ninstead of building up, aggrandizing and beautifying our own States,\r\ncities and towns, we have been spending our substance at the North, and\r\nare daily augmenting and strengthening the very power which now has us so\r\ncompletely under its thumb.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, in view of the preceding statistical facts and arguments,\r\nthat the South, at one time the superior of the North in almost all the\r\nennobling pursuits and conditions of life, has fallen far behind her\r\ncompetitor, and now ranks more as the dependency of a mother country than\r\nas the equal confederate of free and independent States. Following the\r\norder of our task, the next duty that devolves upon us is to trace out the\r\ncauses which have conspired to bring about this important change, and to\r\nplace on record the reasons, as we understand them,\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE NORTH HAS SURPASSED THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have come to the very heart and soul of our subject, we\r\nfeel no disposition to mince matters, but mean to speak plainly, and to\r\nthe point, without any equivocation, mental reservation, or secret evasion\r\nwhatever. The son of a venerated parent, who, while he lived, was a\r\nconsiderate and merciful slaveholder, a native of the South, born and bred\r\nin North Carolina, of a family whose home has been in the valley of the\r\nYadkin for nearly a century and a half, a Southerner by instinct and by\r\nall the influences of thought, habits, and kindred, and with the desire\r\nand fixed purpose to reside permanently within the limits of the South,\r\nand with the expectation of dying there also--we feel that we have the\r\nright to express our opinion, however humble or unimportant it may be, on\r\nany and every question that affects the public good; and, so help us God,\r\n\"sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish,\" we are determined to\r\nexercise that right with manly firmness, and without fear, favor or\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nAnd now to the point. In our opinion, an opinion which has been formed\r\nfrom data obtained by assiduous researches, and comparisons, from\r\nlaborious investigation, logical reasoning, and earnest reflection, the\r\ncauses which have impeded the progress and prosperity of the South, which\r\nhave dwindled our commerce, and other similar pursuits, into the most\r\ncontemptible insignificance; sunk a large majority of our people in\r\ngalling poverty and ignorance, rendered a small minority conceited and\r\ntyrannical, and driven the rest away from their homes; entailed upon us a\r\nhumiliating dependence on the Free States; disgraced us in the recesses of\r\nour own souls, and brought us under reproach in the eyes of all civilized\r\nand enlightened nations--may all be traced to one common source, and there\r\nfind solution in the most hateful and horrible word, that was ever\r\nincorporated into the vocabulary of human economy--_Slavery_!\r\n\r\nReared amidst the institution of slavery, believing it to be wrong both in\r\nprinciple and in practice, and having seen and felt its evil influences\r\nupon individuals, communities and states, we deem it a duty, no less than\r\na privilege, to enter our protest against it, and to use our most\r\nstrenuous efforts to overturn and abolish it! Then we are an abolitionist?\r\nYes! not merely a freesoiler, but an abolitionist, in the fullest sense of\r\nthe term. We are not only in favor of keeping slavery out of the\r\nterritories, but, carrying our opposition to the institution a step\r\nfurther, we here unhesitatingly declare ourself in favor of its immediate\r\nand unconditional abolition, in every state in this confederacy, where it\r\nnow exists! Patriotism makes us a freesoiler; state pride makes us an\r\nemancipationist; a profound sense of duty to the South makes us an\r\nabolitionist; a reasonable degree of fellow feeling for the negro, makes\r\nus a colonizationist. With the free state men in Kanzas and Nebraska, we\r\nsympathize with all our heart. We love the whole country, the great family\r\nof states and territories, one and inseparable, and would have the word\r\nLiberty engraved as an appropriate and truthful motto, on the escutcheon\r\nof every member of the confederacy. We love freedom, we hate slavery, and\r\nrather than give up the one or submit to the other, we will forfeit the\r\npound of flesh nearest our heart. Is this sufficiently explicit and\r\ncategorical? If not, we hold ourself in readiness at all times, to return\r\na prompt reply to any proper question that may be propounded.\r\n\r\nOur repugnance to the institution of slavery, springs from no one-sided\r\nidea, or sickly sentimentality. We have not been hasty in making up our\r\nmind on the subject; we have jumped at no conclusions; we have acted with\r\nperfect calmness and deliberation; we have carefully considered, and\r\nexamined the reasons for and against the institution, and have also taken\r\ninto account the probable consequences of our decision. The more we\r\ninvestigate the matter, the deeper becomes the conviction that we are\r\nright; and with this to impel and sustain us, we pursue our labor with\r\nlove, with hope, and with constantly renewing vigor.\r\n\r\nThat we shall encounter opposition we consider as certain; perhaps we may\r\neven be subjected to insult and violence. From the conceited and cruel\r\noligarchy of the South, we could look for nothing less. But we shall\r\nshrink from no responsibility, and do nothing unbecoming a man; we know\r\nhow to repel indignity, and if assaulted, shall not fail to make the blow\r\nrecoil upon the aggressor's head. The road we have to travel may be a\r\nrough one, but no impediment shall cause us to falter in our course. The\r\nline of our duty is clearly defined, and it is our intention to follow it\r\nfaithfully, or die in the attempt.\r\n\r\nBut, thanks to heaven, we have no ominous forebodings of the result of the\r\ncontest now pending between Liberty and Slavery in this confederacy.\r\nThough neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, our vision is\r\nsufficiently penetrative to divine the future so far as to be able to see\r\nthat the \"peculiar institution\" has but a short, and, as heretofore,\r\ninglorious existence before it. Time, the righter of every wrong, is\r\nripening events for the desired consummation of our labors and the\r\nfulfillment of our cherished hopes. Each revolving year brings nearer the\r\ninevitable crisis. The sooner it comes the better; may heaven, through our\r\nhumble efforts, hasten its advent.\r\n\r\nThe first and most sacred duty of every Southerner, who has the honor and\r\nthe interest of his country at heart, is to declare himself an unqualified\r\nand uncompromising abolitionist. No conditional or half-way declaration\r\nwill avail; no mere threatening demonstration will succeed. With those who\r\ndesire to be instrumental in bringing about the triumph of liberty over\r\nslavery, there should be neither evasion, vacillation, nor equivocation.\r\nWe should listen to no modifying terms or compromises that may be\r\nproposed by the proprietors of the unprofitable and ungodly institution.\r\nNothing short of the complete abolition of slavery can save the South from\r\nfalling into the vortex of utter ruin. Too long have we yielded a\r\nsubmissive obedience to the tyrannical domination of an inflated\r\noligarchy; too long have we tolerated their arrogance and self-conceit;\r\ntoo long have we submitted to their unjust and savage exactions. Let us\r\nnow wrest from them the sceptre of power, establish liberty and equal\r\nrights throughout the land, and henceforth and forever guard our\r\nlegislative halls from the pollutions and usurpations of pro-slavery\r\ndemagogues.\r\n\r\nWe have stated, in a cursory manner, the reasons, as we understand them,\r\nwhy the North has surpassed the South, and have endeavored to show, we\r\nthink successfully, that the political salvation of the South depends upon\r\nthe speedy and unconditional abolition of slavery. We will not, however,\r\nrest the case exclusively on our own arguments, but will again appeal to\r\nincontrovertible facts and statistics to sustain us in our conclusions.\r\nBut before we do so, we desire to fortify ourself against a charge that is\r\ntoo frequently made by careless and superficial readers. We allude to the\r\nobjections so often urged against the use of tabular statements and\r\nstatistical facts. It is worthy of note, however, that those objections\r\nnever come from thorough scholars or profound thinkers. Among the majority\r\nof mankind, the science of statistics is only beginning to be appreciated;\r\nwhen well understood, it will be recognized as one of the most important\r\nbranches of knowledge, and, as a matter of course, be introduced and\r\ntaught as an indispensable element of practical education in all our\r\nprincipal institutions of learning. One of the most vigorous and popular\r\ntransatlantic writers of the day, Wm. C. Taylor, LL.D., of Dublin, says:\r\n\r\n\"The cultivation of statistics must be the source of all future\r\nimprovement in the science of political economy, because it is to the\r\ntable of the statistician that the economist must look for his facts; and\r\nall speculations not founded upon facts, though they may be admired and\r\napplauded when first propounded, will, in the end, assuredly be forgotten.\r\nStatistical science may almost be regarded as the creation of this age.\r\nThe word statistics was invented in the middle of the last century by a\r\nGerman professor,[1] to express a summary view of the physical, moral, and\r\nsocial conditions of States; he justly remarked, that a numerical\r\nstatement of the extent, density of population, imports, exports,\r\nrevenues, etc., of a country, more perfectly explained its social\r\ncondition than general statements, however graphic or however accurate.\r\nWhen such statements began to be collected, and exhibited in a popular\r\nform, it was soon discovered that the political and economical sciences\r\nwere likely to gain the position of physical sciences; that is to say,\r\nthey were about to obtain records of observation, which would test the\r\naccuracy of recognized principles, and lead to the discovery of new modes\r\nof action. But the great object of this new science is to lead to the\r\nknowledge of human nature; that is, to ascertain the general course of\r\noperation of man's mental and moral faculties, and to furnish us with a\r\ncorrect standard of judgment, by enabling us to determine the average\r\namount of the past as a guide to the average probabilities of the future.\r\nThis science is yet in its infancy, but has already produced the most\r\nbeneficial effects. The accuracy of the tables of life have rendered the\r\ncalculations of rates of insurance a matter of much greater certainty than\r\nthey were heretofore; the system of keeping the public accounts has been\r\nsimplified and improved; and finally, the experimental sciences of\r\nmedicine and political economy, have been fixed on a firmer foundation\r\nthan could be anticipated in the last century. Even in private life this\r\nscience is likely to prove of immense advantage, by directing attention to\r\nthe collection and registration of facts, and thus preventing the\r\nformation of hasty judgments and erroneous conclusions.\"\r\n\r\nThe compiler, or rather the superintendent of the seventh United States\r\ncensus, Prof. De Bow, a gentleman of more than ordinary industry and\r\npractical learning, who, in his excellent Review, has, from time to time,\r\ndisplayed much commendable zeal in his efforts to develop the industrial\r\nresources of the Southern and South-western states, and who is, perhaps,\r\nthe greatest statistician in the country, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Statistics are far from being the barren array of figures ingeniously and\r\nlaboriously combined into columns and tables, which many persons are apt\r\nto suppose them. They constitute rather the ledger of a nation, in which,\r\nlike the merchant in his books, the citizen can read, at one view, all of\r\nthe results of a year or of a period of years, as compared with other\r\nperiods, and deduce the profit or the loss which has been made, in morals,\r\neducation, wealth or power.\"\r\n\r\nImpressed with a sense of the propriety of introducing, in this as well as\r\nin the succeeding chapters of our work, a number of tabular statements\r\nexhibiting the comparative growth and prosperity of the free and slave\r\nstates, we have deemed it eminently proper to adduce the testimony of\r\nthese distinguished authors in support of the claims which official facts\r\nand accurate statistics lay to our consideration. And here we may remark\r\nthat the statistics which we propose to offer, like those already given,\r\nhave been obtained from official sources, and may, therefore, be relied on\r\nas correct. The object we have in view in making a free use of facts and\r\nfigures, if not already apparent, will soon be understood. It is not so\r\nmuch in its moral and religious aspects that we propose to discuss the\r\nquestion of slavery, as in its social and political character and\r\ninfluences. To say nothing of the sin and the shame of slavery, we believe\r\nit is a most expensive and unprofitable institution; and if our brethren\r\nof the South will but throw aside their unfounded prejudices and\r\npreconceived opinions, and give us a fair and patient hearing, we feel\r\nconfident that we can bring them to the same conclusion. Indeed, we\r\nbelieve we shall be enabled--not alone by our own contributions, but with\r\nthe aid of incontestable facts and arguments which we shall introduce from\r\nother sources--to convince all true-hearted, candid and intelligent\r\nSoutherners, who may chance to read our book, (and we hope their name may\r\nbe legion) that slavery, and nothing but slavery, has retarded the\r\nprogress and prosperity of our portion of the Union; depopulated and\r\nimpoverished our cities by forcing the more industrious and enterprising\r\nnatives of the soil to emigrate to the free states; brought our domain\r\nunder a sparse and inert population by preventing foreign immigration;\r\nmade us tributary to the North, and reduced us to the humiliating\r\ncondition of mere provincial subjects in fact, though not in name. We\r\nbelieve, moreover, that every patriotic Southerner thus convinced will\r\nfeel it a duty he owes to himself, to his country, and to his God, to\r\nbecome a thorough, inflexible, practical abolitionist. So mote it be!\r\n\r\nNow to our figures. Few persons have an adequate idea of the important\r\npart the cardinal numbers are now playing in the cause of Liberty. They\r\nare working wonders in the South. Intelligent, business men, from the\r\nChesapeake to the Rio Grande, are beginning to see that slavery, even in a\r\nmercenary point of view, is impolitic, because it is unprofitable. Those\r\nunique, mysterious little Arabic sentinels on the watch-towers of\r\npolitical economy, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, have joined forces,\r\nallied themselves to the powers of freedom, and are hemming in and\r\ncombatting the institution with the most signal success. If let alone, we\r\nhave no doubt the digits themselves would soon terminate the existence of\r\nslavery; but we do not mean to let them alone; they must not have all the\r\nhonor of annihilating the monstrous iniquity. We want to become an\r\nauxiliary in the good work, and facilitate it. The liberation of five\r\nmillions of \"poor white trash\" from the second degree of slavery, and of\r\nthree millions of miserable kidnapped negroes from the first degree,\r\ncannot be accomplished too soon. That it was not accomplished many years\r\nago is our misfortune. It now behooves us to take a bold and determined\r\nstand in defence of the inalienable rights of ourselves and of our fellow\r\nmen, and to avenge the multiplicity of wrongs, social and political, which\r\nwe have suffered at the hands of a villainous oligarchy. It is madness to\r\ndelay. We cannot be too hasty in carrying out our designs. Precipitance in\r\nthis matter is an utter impossibility. If to-day we could emancipate all\r\nthe slaves in the Union, we would do it, and the country and everybody in\r\nit would be vastly better off to-morrow. Now is the time for action; let\r\nus work.\r\n\r\nBy taking a sort of inventory of the agricultural products of the free and\r\nslave States in 1850, we now propose to correct a most extraordinary and\r\nmischievous error into which the people of the South have unconsciously\r\nfallen. Agriculture, it is well known, is the sole boast of the South;\r\nand, strange to say, many pro-slavery Southerners, who, in our latitude,\r\npass for intelligent men, are so puffed up with the idea of our importance\r\nin this respect, that they speak of the North as a sterile region, unfit\r\nfor cultivation, and quite dependent on the South for the necessaries of\r\nlife! Such rampant ignorance ought to be knocked in the head! We can prove\r\nthat the North produces greater quantities of bread-stuffs than the South!\r\nFigures shall show the facts. Properly, the South has nothing left to\r\nboast of; the North has surpassed her in everything, and is going farther\r\nand farther ahead of her every day. We ask the reader's careful attention\r\nto the following tables, which we have prepared at no little cost of time\r\nand trouble, and which, when duly considered in connection with the\r\nforegoing and subsequent portions of our work, will, we believe, carry\r\nconviction to the mind that the downward tendency of the South can be\r\narrested only by the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

Mark well\r\nthe balance in bushels, and the difference in value! Is either in favor of\r\nthe South? No! Are both in favor of the North? Yes! Here we have\r\nunquestionable proof that of all the bushel-measure products of the\r\nnation, the free states produce far more than one-half; and it is worthy\r\nof particular mention, that _the excess of Northern products is of the\r\nmost valuable kind_. The account shows a balance against the South, in\r\nfavor of the North, of _seventeen million four hundred and twenty-three\r\nthousand one hundred and fifty-two bushels_, and a difference in value of\r\n_forty-four million seven hundred and eighty-two thousand six hundred and\r\nthirty-six dollars_. Please bear these facts in mind, for, in order to\r\nshow positively how the free and slave States do stand upon the great and\r\nimportant subject of rural economy, we intend to take an account of all\r\nthe other products of the soil, of the live-stock upon farms, of the\r\nanimals slaughtered, and, in fact, of every item of husbandry of the two\r\nsections; and if, in bringing our tabular exercises to a close, we find\r\nslavery gaining upon freedom--a thing it has never yet been known to\r\ndo--we shall, as a matter of course, see that the above amount is\r\ntransferred to the credit of the side to which it of right belongs.\r\n\r\nIn making up these tables we have two objects in view; the first is to\r\nopen the eyes of the non-slaveholders of the South, to the system of\r\ndeception, that has so long been practiced upon them, and the second is to\r\nshow slaveholders themselves--we have reference only to those who are not\r\ntoo perverse, or ignorant, to perceive naked truths--that free labor is\r\nfar more respectable, profitable, and productive, than slave labor. In the\r\nSouth, unfortunately, no kind of labor is either free or respectable.\r\nEvery white man who is under the necessity of earning his bread, by the\r\nsweat of his brow, or by manual labor, in any capacity, no matter how\r\nunassuming in deportment, or exemplary in morals, is treated as if he was\r\na loathsome beast, and shunned with the utmost disdain. His soul may be\r\nthe very seat of honor and integrity, yet without slaves--himself a\r\nslave--he is accounted as nobody, and would be deemed intolerably\r\npresumptuous, if he dared to open his mouth, even so wide as to give faint\r\nutterance to a three-lettered monosyllable, like yea or nay, in the\r\npresence of an august knight of the whip and the lash.\r\n\r\nThere are few Southerners who will not be astonished at the disclosures of\r\nthese statistical comparisons, between the free and the slave States. That\r\nthe astonishment of the more intelligent and patriotic non-slaveholders\r\nwill be mingled with indignation, is no more than we anticipate. We\r\nconfess our own surprise, and deep chagrin, at the result of our\r\ninvestigations. Until we examined into the matter, we thought and hoped\r\nthe South was really ahead of the North in _one_ particular, that of\r\nagriculture; but our thoughts have been changed, and our hopes frustrated,\r\nfor instead of finding ourselves the possessors of a single advantage, we\r\nbehold our dear native South stripped of every laurel, and sinking deeper\r\nand deeper in the depths of poverty and shame; while, at the same time, we\r\nsee the North, our successful rival, extracting and absorbing the few\r\nelements of wealth yet remaining amongst us, and rising higher and higher\r\nin the scale of fame, fortune, and invulnerable power. Thus our\r\ndisappointment gives way to a feeling of intense mortification, and our\r\nsoul involuntarily, but justly, we believe, cries out for retribution\r\nagainst the treacherous, slave-driving legislators, who have so basely and\r\nunpatriotically neglected the interests of their poor white constituents\r\nand bargained away the rights of posterity. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe white non-slaveholders of the South, are in the majority, as five to\r\none, they have never yet had any part or lot in framing the laws under\r\nwhich they live. There is no legislation except for the benefit of\r\nslavery, and slaveholders. As a general rule, poor white persons are\r\nregarded with less esteem and attention than negroes, and though the\r\ncondition of the latter is wretched beyond description, vast numbers of\r\nthe former are infinitely worse off. A cunningly devised mockery of\r\nfreedom is guarantied to them, and that is all. To all intents and\r\npurposes they are disfranchised, and outlawed, and the only privilege\r\nextended to them, is a shallow and circumscribed participation in the\r\npolitical movements that usher slaveholders into office.\r\n\r\nWe have not breathed away seven and twenty years in the South, without\r\nbecoming acquainted with the demagogical manoeuverings of the oligarchy.\r\nTheir intrigues and tricks of legerdemain are as familiar to us as\r\nhousehold words; in vain might the world be ransacked for a more precious\r\njunto of flatterers and cajolers. It is amusing to ignorance, amazing to\r\ncredulity, and insulting to intelligence, to hear them in their blattering\r\nefforts to mystify and pervert the sacred principles of liberty, and turn\r\nthe curse of slavery into a blessing. To the illiterate poor whites--made\r\npoor and ignorant by the system of slavery--they hold out the idea that\r\nslavery is the very bulwark of our liberties, and the foundation of\r\nAmerican independence! For hours at a time, day after day, will they\r\nexpatiate upon the inexpressible beauties and excellencies of this great,\r\n_free_ and _independent_ nation; and finally, with the most extravagant\r\ngesticulations and rhetorical flourishes, conclude their nonsensical\r\nravings, by attributing all the glory and prosperity of the country, from\r\nMaine to Texas, and from Georgia to California, to the \"invaluable\r\ninstitutions of the South!\" With what patience we could command, we have\r\nfrequently listened to the incoherent and truth-murdering declamations of\r\nthese champions of slavery, and, in the absence of a more politic method\r\nof giving vent to our disgust and indignation, have involuntarily bit our\r\nlips into blisters.\r\n\r\nThe lords of the lash are not only absolute masters of the blacks, who are\r\nbought and sold, and driven about like so many cattle, but they are also\r\nthe oracles and arbiters of all non-slaveholding whites, whose freedom is\r\nmerely nominal, and whose unparalleled illiteracy and degradation is\r\npurposely and fiendishly perpetuated. How little the \"poor white trash,\"\r\nthe great majority of the Southern people, know of the real condition of\r\nthe country is, indeed, sadly astonishing. The truth is, they know nothing\r\nof public measures, and little of private affairs, except what their\r\nimperious masters, the slave-drivers, condescend to tell, and that is but\r\nprecious little, and even that little, always garbled and one-sided, is\r\nnever told except in public harangues; for the haughty cavaliers of\r\nshackles and handcuffs will not degrade themselves by holding private\r\nconverse with those who have neither dimes nor hereditary rights in human\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nWhenever it pleases, and to the extent it pleases, a slaveholder to become\r\ncommunicative, poor whites may hear with fear and trembling, but not\r\nspeak. They must be as mum as dumb brutes, and stand in awe of their\r\naugust superiors, or be crushed with stern rebukes, cruel oppressions, or\r\ndownright violence. If they dare to think for themselves, their thoughts\r\nmust be forever concealed. The expression of any sentiment at all\r\nconflicting with the gospel of slavery, dooms them at once in the\r\ncommunity in which they live, and then, whether willing or unwilling, they\r\nare obliged to become heroes, martyrs, or exiles. They may thirst for\r\nknowledge, but there is no Moses among them to smite it out of the rocks\r\nof Horeb. The black veil, through whose almost impenetrable meshes light\r\nseldom gleams, has long been pendent over their eyes, and there, with\r\nfiendish jealousy, the slave-driving ruffians sedulously guard it.\r\nNon-slaveholders are not only kept in ignorance of what is transpiring at\r\nthe North, but they are continually misinformed of what is going on even\r\nin the South. Never were the poorer classes of a people, and those classes\r\nso largely in the majority, and all inhabiting the same country, so basely\r\nduped, so adroitly swindled, or so damnably outraged.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the stupid and sequacious masses, the white victims of\r\nslavery, will believe, and, as a general thing, they do believe, whatever\r\nthe slaveholders tell them; and thus it is that they are cajoled into the\r\nnotion that they are the freest, happiest and most intelligent people in\r\nthe world, and are taught to look with prejudice and disapprobation upon\r\nevery new principle or progressive movement. Thus it is that the South,\r\nwoefully inert and inventionless, has lagged behind the North, and is now\r\nweltering in the cesspool of ignorance and degradation.\r\n\r\nWe have already intimated that the opinion is prevalent throughout the\r\nSouth that the free States are quite sterile and unproductive, and that\r\nthey are mainly dependent on us for breadstuffs and other provisions. So\r\nfar as the cereals, fruits, garden vegetables and esculent roots are\r\nconcerned, we have, in the preceding tables, shown the utter falsity of\r\nthis opinion; and we now propose to show that it is equally erroneous in\r\nother particulars, and very far from the truth in the general reckoning.\r\nWe can prove, and we intend to prove, from facts in our possession, that\r\nthe hay crop of the free States is worth considerably more in dollars and\r\ncents than all the cotton, tobacco, rice, hay and hemp produced in the\r\nfifteen slave States. This statement may strike some of our readers with\r\namazement, and others may, for the moment, regard it as quite incredible;\r\nbut it is true, nevertheless, and we shall soon proceed to confirm it. The\r\nsingle free State of New-York produces more than _three times_ the\r\nquantity of hay that is produced in all the slave States. Ohio produces a\r\nlarger number of tons than all the Southern and Southwestern States, and\r\nso does Pennsylvania. Vermont, little and unpretending as she is, does\r\nthe same thing, with the exception of Virginia. Look at the facts as\r\npresented in the tables, and let your own eyes, physical and intellectual,\r\nconfirm you in the truth.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, forsooth, the slave-driving oligarchy would whip us into the\r\nbelief that agriculture is not one of the leading and lucrative pursuits\r\nof the free States, that the soil there is an uninterrupted barren waste,\r\nand that our Northern brethren, having the advantage in nothing except\r\nwealth, population, inland and foreign commerce, manufactures, mechanism,\r\ninventions, literature, the arts and sciences, and their concomitant\r\nbranches of profitable industry,--miserable objects of charity--are\r\ndependent on us for the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nNext to Virginia, Maryland is the greatest Southern hay-producing State;\r\nand yet, it is the opinion of several of the most extensive hay and grain\r\ndealers in Baltimore, with whom we have conversed on the subject, that the\r\ndomestic crop is scarcely equal to one-third the demand, and that the\r\nbalance required for home consumption, about two-thirds, is chiefly\r\nbrought from New-York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. At this rate,\r\nMaryland receives and consumes not less than three hundred and fifteen\r\nthousand tons of Northern hay every year; and this, as we are informed by\r\nthe dealers above-mentioned, at an average cost to the last purchaser, by\r\nthe time it is stowed in the mow, of at least twenty-five dollars per ton;\r\nit would thus appear that this most popular and valuable provender, one of\r\nthe staple commodities of the North, commands a market in a single slave\r\nState, to the amount of seven million eight hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand dollars per annum.\r\n\r\nIn this same State of Maryland, less than one million of dollar's worth of\r\ncotton finds a market, the whole number of bales sold here in 1850\r\namounting to only twenty-three thousand three hundred and twenty-five,\r\nvalued at seven hundred and forty-six thousand four hundred dollars.\r\nBriefly, then, and in round numbers, we may state the case thus: Maryland\r\nbuys annually seven millions of dollars worth of hay from the North, and\r\none million of dollars worth of cotton from the South. Let slaveholders\r\nand their fawning defenders read, ponder and compare.\r\n\r\nThe exact quantities of Northern hay, rye, and buckwheat flour, Irish\r\npotatoes, fruits, clover and grass seeds, and other products of the soil,\r\nreceived and consumed in all the slaveholding States, we have no means of\r\nascertaining; but for all practical purposes, we can arrive sufficiently\r\nnear to the amount by inference from the above data, and from what we see\r\nwith our eyes and hear with our ears wherever we go. Food from the North\r\nfor man or for beast, or for both, is for sale in every market in the\r\nSouth. Even in the most insignificant little villages in the interior of\r\nthe slave States, where books, newspapers and other mediums of\r\nintelligence are unknown, where the poor whites and the negroes are alike\r\nbowed down in heathenish ignorance and barbarism, and where the news is\r\nreceived but once a week, and then only in a Northern-built stage-coach,\r\ndrawn by horses in Northern harness, in charge of a driver dressed\r\n_cap-a-pie_ in Northern habiliments, and with a Northern whip in his\r\nhand,--the agricultural products of the North, either crude, prepared,\r\npickled or preserved, are ever to be found.\r\n\r\nMortifying as the acknowledgment of the fact is to us, it is our unbiased\r\nopinion--an opinion which will, we believe, be endorsed by every\r\nintelligent person who goes into a careful examination and comparison of\r\nall the facts in the case--that the profits arising to the North from the\r\nsale of provender and provisions to the South, are far greater than those\r\narising to the South from the sale of cotton, tobacco and breadstuffs to\r\nthe North. It follows, then, that the agricultural interests of the North\r\nbeing not only equal but actually superior to those of the South, the\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars which the commerce and manufactures of the\r\nformer annually yield, is just so much clear and independent gain over the\r\nlatter. It follows, also, from a corresponding train or system of\r\ndeduction, and with all the foregoing facts in view, that the difference\r\nbetween freedom and slavery is simply the difference between sense and\r\nnonsense, wisdom and folly, good and evil, right and wrong.\r\n\r\nAny observant American, from whatever point of the compass he may hail,\r\nwho will take the trouble to pass through the Southern markets, both great\r\nand small, as we have done, and inquire where this article, that and the\r\nother came from, will be utterly astonished at the variety and quantity of\r\nNorthern agricultural productions kept for sale. And this state of things\r\nis growing worse and worse every year. Exclusively agricultural as the\r\nSouth is in her industrial pursuits, she is barely able to support her\r\nsparse and degenerate population. Her men and her domestic animals, both\r\ndwarfed into shabby objects of commiseration under the blighting effects\r\nof slavery, are constantly feeding on the multifarious products of\r\nNorthern soil. And if the whole truth must be told, we may here add, that\r\nthese products, like all other articles of merchandize purchased at the\r\nNorth, are generally bought on a credit, and, in a great number of\r\ninstances, by far too many, never paid for--not, as a general rule,\r\nbecause the purchasers are dishonest or unwilling to pay, but because they\r\nare impoverished and depressed by the retrogressive and deadening\r\noperations of slavery, that most unprofitable and pernicious institution\r\nunder which they live.\r\n\r\nTo show how well we are sustained in our remarks upon hay and other\r\nspecial products of the soil, as well as to give circulation to other\r\nfacts of equal significance, we quote a single passage from an address by\r\nPaul C. Cameron, before the Agricultural Society of Orange County, North\r\nCarolina. This production is, in the main, so powerfully conceived, so\r\ncorrect and plausible in its statements and conclusions, and so well\r\ncalculated, though, perhaps, not intended, to arouse the old North State\r\nto a sense of her natural greatness and acquired shame, that we could wish\r\nto see it published in pamphlet form, and circulated throughout the length\r\nand breadth of that unfortunate and degraded heritage of slavery. Mr.\r\nCameron says:\r\n\r\n\"I know not when I have been more humiliated, as a North Carolina farmer,\r\nthan when, a few weeks ago, at a railroad depot at the very doors of our\r\nState capital, I saw wagons drawn by Kentucky mules, loading with\r\nNorthern hay, for the supply not only of the town, but to be taken to the\r\ncountry. Such a sight at the capital of a State whose population is almost\r\nexclusively devoted to agriculture, is a most humiliating exhibition. Let\r\nus cease to use every thing, as far as it is practicable, that is not the\r\nproduct of our own soil and workshops--not an axe, or a broom, or bucket,\r\nfrom Connecticut. By every consideration of self-preservation, we are\r\ncalled to make better efforts to expel the Northern grocer from the State\r\nwith his butter, and the Ohio and Kentucky horse, mule and hog driver,\r\nfrom our county at least. It is a reproach on us as farmers, and no little\r\ndeduction from our wealth, that we suffer the population of our towns and\r\nvillages to supply themselves with butter from another Orange County in\r\nNew-York.\"\r\n\r\nWe have promised to prove that the hay crop of the free states is worth\r\nconsiderably more than all the cotton, tobacco, rice, hay and hemp\r\nproduced in the fifteen slave States. The compilers of the last census, as\r\nwe learn from Prof. De Bow, the able and courteous superintendent, in\r\nmaking up the hay-tables, allowed two thousand two hundred and forty\r\npounds to the ton. The price per ton at which we should estimate its value\r\nhas puzzled us to some extent. Dealers in the article in Baltimore think\r\nit will average twenty-five dollars, in their market. Four or five months\r\nago they sold it at thirty dollars per ton. At the very time we write,\r\nthough there is less activity in the article than usual, we learn, from an\r\nexamination of sundry prices-current and commercial journals, that hay is\r\nselling in Savannah at $33 per ton; in Mobile and New Orleans at $26; in\r\nCharleston at $25; in Louisville at $24; and in Cincinnati at $23. The\r\naverage of these prices is _twenty-six dollars sixteen and two-third\r\ncents_; and we suppose it would be fair to employ the figures which would\r\nindicate this amount, the net value of a single ton, in calculating the\r\ntotal market value of the entire crop. Were we to do this--and, with the\r\nforegoing facts in view, we submit to intelligent men whether we would not\r\nbe justifiable in doing it,--the hay crop of the free states, 12,690,982\r\ntons, in 1850, would amount in valuation to the enormous sum of\r\n$331,081,695--more than four times the value of all the cotton produced in\r\nthe United States during the same period!\r\n\r\nBut we shall not make the calculation at what we have found to be the\r\naverage value per ton throughout the country. What rate, then, shall be\r\nagreed upon as a basis of comparison between the value of the hay crop of\r\nthe North and that of the South, and as a means of testing the truth of\r\nour declaration--that the former exceeds the aggregate value of all the\r\ncotton, tobacco, rice, hay and hemp produced in the fifteen slave States?\r\nSuppose we take $13,08-1/3--just half the average value--as the multiplier\r\nin this arithmetical exercise. This we can well afford to do; indeed, we\r\nmight reduce the amount per ton to much less than half the average value,\r\nand still have a large margin left for triumphant demonstration. It is not\r\nour purpose, however, to make an overwhelming display of the incomparable\r\ngreatness of the free States.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of the various agricultural products of the two\r\ngreat sections of the country, we have been guided by prices emanating\r\nfrom the Bureau of Agriculture in Washington; and in a catalogue of those\r\nprices now before us, we perceive that the average value of hay throughout\r\nthe nation is supposed to be not more than half a cent per pound--$11.20\r\nper ton--which, as we have seen above, is considerably less than half the\r\npresent market value;--and this, too, in the face of the fact that prices\r\ngenerally rule higher than they do just now. It will be admitted on all\r\nsides, however, that the prices fixed upon by the Bureau of Agriculture,\r\ntaken as a whole, are as fair for one section of the country as for the\r\nother, and that we cannot blamelessly deviate from them in one particular\r\nwithout deviating from them in another. Eleven dollars and twenty cents\r\n($11.20) per ton shall therefore be the price; and, notwithstanding these\r\ngreatly reduced figures, we now renew, with an addendum, our declaration\r\nand promise, that--_We can prove, and we shall now proceed to prove, that\r\nthe annual hay crop of the free States is worth considerably more in\r\ndollars and cents than all the cotton, tobacco, rice, hay, hemp and cane\r\nsugar annually produced in the fifteen slave States_.\r\n\r\nHAY CROP OF THE FREE STATES--1850.\r\n\r\n  12,690,982 tons _a_ 11,20                        $142,138,998\r\n\r\nSUNDRY PRODUCTS OF THE SLAVE STATES--1850.\r\n\r\n  Cotton            2,445,779 bales  _a_   32,00    $78,264,928\r\n  Tobacco         185,023,906 lbs.    \"       10     18,502,390\r\n  Rice (rough)    215,313,497 lbs.    \"        4      8,612,539\r\n  Hay               1,137,784 tons    \"    11,20     12,743,180\r\n  Hemp                 34,673 tons    \"   112,00      3,883,376\r\n  Cane Sugar      237,133,000 lbs.    \"        7     16,599,310\r\n                                                   ------------\r\n                                                   $138,605,723\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n  Hay crop of the free States                      $142,138,998\r\n  Sundry products of the slave States               138,605,723\r\n                                                   ------------\r\n  Balance in favor of the free States                $3,533,275\r\n\r\nThere is the account; look at it, and let it stand in attestation of the\r\nexalted virtues and surpassing powers of freedom. Scan it well, Messieurs\r\nlords of the lash, and learn from it new lessons of the utter\r\ninefficiency, and despicable imbecility of slavery. Examine it minutely,\r\nliberty-loving patriots of the North, and behold in it additional\r\nevidences of the beauty, grandeur, and super-excellence of free\r\ninstitutions. Treasure it up in your minds, outraged friends and\r\nnon-slaveholders of the South, and let the recollection of it arouse you\r\nto an inflexible determination to extirpate the monstrous enemy that\r\nstalks abroad in your land, and to recover the inalienable rights and\r\nliberties, which have been filched from you by an unprincipled oligarchy.\r\n\r\nIn deference to truth, decency and good sense, it is to be hoped that\r\nnegro-driving politicians will never more have the effrontery to open\r\ntheir mouths in extolling the agricultural achievements of slave labor.\r\nEspecially is it desirable, that, as a simple act of justice to a basely\r\ndeceived populace, they may cease their stale and senseless harangues on\r\nthe importance of cotton. The value of cotton to the South, to the North,\r\nto the nation, and to the world, has been so grossly exaggerated, and so\r\nextensive have been the evils which have resulted in consequence of the\r\nextraordinary misrepresentations concerning it, that we should feel\r\nconstrained to reproach ourself for remissness of duty, if we failed to\r\nmake an attempt to explode the popular error. The figures above show what\r\nit is, and what it is not. Recur to them, and learn the facts.\r\n\r\nSo hyperbolically has the importance of cotton been magnified by certain\r\npro-slavery politicians of the South, that the person who would give\r\ncredence to all their fustian and bombast, would be under the necessity of\r\nbelieving that the very existence of almost everything, in the heaven\r\nabove, in the earth beneath, and in the water under the earth, depended on\r\nit. The truth is, however, that the cotton crop is of but little value to\r\nthe South. New England and Old England, by their superior enterprise and\r\nsagacity, turn it chiefly to their own advantage. It is carried in their\r\nships, spun in their factories, woven in their looms, insured in their\r\noffices, returned again in their own vessels, and, with double freight and\r\ncost of manufacturing added, purchased by the South at a high premium. Of\r\nall the parties engaged or interested in its transportation and\r\nmanufacture, the South is the only one that does not make a profit. Nor\r\ndoes she, as a general thing, make a profit by producing it.\r\n\r\nWe are credibly informed that many of the farmers in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Baltimore, where we now write, have turned their attention\r\nexclusively to hay, and that from one acre they frequently gather two\r\ntons, for which they receive fifty dollars. Let us now inquire how many\r\ndollars may be expected from an acre planted in cotton. Mr. Cameron, from\r\nwhose able address before the Agricultural Society of Orange County, North\r\nCarolina, we have already gleaned some interesting particulars, informs\r\nus, that the cotton planters in his part of the country, \"have contented\r\nthemselves with a crop yielding only _ten or twelve dollars per acre_,\"\r\nand that \"the summing up of a large surface gives but a living result.\" An\r\nintelligent resident of the Palmetto State, writing in De Bow's Review,\r\nnot long since, advances the opinion that the cotton planters of South\r\nCarolina are not realizing more than one per cent. on the amount of\r\ncapital they have invested. While in Virginia, very recently, an elderly\r\nslaveholder, whose religious walk and conversation had recommended and\r\npromoted him to an eldership in the Presbyterian church, and who supports\r\nhimself and family by raising niggers and tobacco, told us that, for the\r\nlast eight or ten years, aside from the increase of his human chattels, he\r\nfelt quite confident he had not cleared as much even as one per cent. per\r\nannum on the amount of his investment. The real and personal property of\r\nthis aged _Christian_ consists chiefly in a large tract of land and about\r\nthirty negroes, most of whom, according to his own confession, are more\r\nexpensive than profitable. The proceeds arising from the sale of the\r\ntobacco they produce, are all absorbed in the purchase of meat and bread\r\nfor home consumption, and when the crop is stunted by drought, frost, or\r\notherwise cut short, one of the negroes must be sold to raise funds for\r\nthe support of the others. Such are the agricultural achievements of slave\r\nlabor; such are the results of \"the sum of all villainies.\" The diabolical\r\ninstitution subsists on its own flesh. At one time children are sold to\r\nprocure food for the parents, at another, parents are sold to procure food\r\nfor the children. Within its pestilential atmosphere, nothing succeeds;\r\nprogress and prosperity are unknown; inanition and slothfulness ensue;\r\neverything becomes dull, dismal and unprofitable; wretchedness and\r\ndesolation run riot throughout the land; an aspect of most melancholy\r\ninactivity and dilapidation broods over every city and town; ignorance and\r\nprejudice sit enthroned over the minds of the people; usurping despots\r\nwield the sceptre of power; everywhere, and in everything, between\r\nDelaware Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, are the multitudinous evils of\r\nslavery apparent.\r\n\r\nThe soil itself soon sickens and dies beneath the unnatural tread of the\r\nslave. Hear what the Hon. C. C. Clay, of Alabama, has to say upon the\r\nsubject. His testimony is eminently suggestive, well-timed, and truthful;\r\nand we heartily commend it to the careful consideration of every spirited\r\nSouthron who loves his country, and desires to see it rescued from the\r\nfatal grasp of \"the mother of harlots.\" Says he:\r\n\r\n\"I can show you, with sorrow, in the older portions of Alabama, and in my\r\nnative county of Madison, the sad memorials of the artless and exhausting\r\nculture of cotton. Our small planters, after taking the cream off their\r\nlands, unable to restore them by rest, manures, or otherwise, are going\r\nfurther West and South, in search of other virgin lands, which they may\r\nand will despoil and impoverish in like manner. Our wealthier planters,\r\nwith greater means and no more skill, are buying out their poorer\r\nneighbors, extending their plantations, and adding to their slave force.\r\nThe wealthy few, who are able to live on smaller profits, and to give\r\ntheir blasted fields some rest, are thus pushing off the many who are\r\nmerely independent. Of the $20,000,000 annually realized from the sales of\r\nthe cotton crop of Alabama, nearly all not expended in supporting the\r\nproducers, is re-invested in land and negroes. Thus the white population\r\nhas decreased and the slave increased almost _pari passu_ in several\r\ncounties of our State. In 1825, Madison county cast about 3,000 votes;\r\nnow, she cannot cast exceeding 2,300. In traversing that county, one will\r\ndiscover numerous farm-houses, once the abode of industrious and\r\nintelligent freemen, now occupied by slaves, or tenantless, deserted and\r\ndilapidated; he will observe fields, once fertile, now unfenced,\r\nabandoned, and covered with those evil harbingers, fox-tail and\r\nbroomsedge; he will see the moss growing on the mouldering walls of once\r\nthrifty villages, and will find 'one only master grasps the whole domain,'\r\nthat once furnished happy homes for a dozen white families. Indeed, a\r\ncountry in its infancy, where fifty years ago scarce a forest tree had\r\nbeen felled by the axe of the pioneer, is already exhibiting the painful\r\nsigns of senility and decay, apparent in Virginia and the Carolinas.\"\r\n\r\nSome one has said that \"an honest confession is good for the soul,\" and if\r\nthe adage be true, as we have no doubt it is, we think Mr. C. C. Clay is\r\nentitled to a quiet conscience on one score at least. In the extract\r\nquoted above, he gives us a graphic description of the ruinous operations\r\nand influences of slavery in the Southwest; and we, as a native of\r\nCarolina, and a traveler through Virginia, are ready to bear testimony to\r\nthe fitness of his remarks when he referred to those States as examples of\r\nsenility and decay. With equal propriety, however, he might have stopped\r\nnearer home for a subject of comparison. Either of the States bordering\r\nupon Alabama, or, indeed, any other slave States, would have answered his\r\npurpose quite as well as Virginia and the Carolinas. Wherever slavery\r\nexists there he may find parallels to the destruction that is sweeping\r\nwith such deadly influence over his own unfortunate State.\r\n\r\nAs for examples of vigorous, industrious and thrifty communities, they can\r\nbe found anywhere beyond the Upas-shadow of slavery--nowhere else.\r\nNew-York and Massachusetts, which, by nature, are confessedly far inferior\r\nto Virginia and the Carolinas, have, by the more liberal and equitable\r\npolicy which they have pursued, in substituting liberty for slavery,\r\nattained a degree of eminence and prosperity altogether unknown in the\r\nslave States.\r\n\r\nAmidst all the hyperbole and cajolery of slave-driving politicians, who,\r\nas we have already seen, are 'the books, the arts, the academies, that\r\nshow, contain, and govern all the South,' we are rejoiced to see that Mr.\r\nClay, Mr. Cameron, and a few others, have had the boldness and honesty to\r\nstep forward and proclaim the truth. All such frank admissions are to be\r\nhailed as good omens for the South. Nothing good can come from any attempt\r\nto conceal the unconcealable evidences of poverty and desolation\r\neverywhere trailing in the wake of slavery. Let the truth be told on all\r\noccasions, of the North as well as of the South, and the people will soon\r\nbegin to discover the egregiousness of their errors, to draw just\r\ncomparisons, to inquire into cause and effect, and to adopt the more utile\r\nmeasures, manners and customs of their wiser cotemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn wilfully traducing and decrying everything North of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline, and in excessively magnifying the importance of everything South of\r\nit, the oligarchy have, in the eyes of all liberal and intelligent men,\r\nonly made an exhibition of their uncommon folly and dishonesty. For a long\r\ntime, it is true, they have succeeded in deceiving the people, in keeping\r\nthem humbled in the murky sloughs of poverty and ignorance, and in\r\ninstilling into their untutored minds passions and prejudices expressly\r\ncalculated to strengthen and protect the accursed institution of slavery;\r\nbut, thanks to heaven, their inglorious reign is fast drawing to a close;\r\nwith irresistible brilliancy, and in spite of the interdict of tyrants,\r\nlight from the pure fountain of knowledge is now streaming over the dark\r\nplaces of our land, and, ere long--mark our words--there will ascend from\r\nDelaware, and from Texas, and from all the intermediate States, a huzza\r\nfor Freedom and for Equal Rights, that will utterly confound the friends\r\nof despotism, set at defiance the authority of usurpers, and carry\r\nconsternation to the heart of every slavery-propagandist.\r\n\r\nTo undeceive the people of the South, to bring them to a knowledge of the\r\ninferior and disreputable position which they occupy as a component part\r\nof the Union, and to give prominence and popularity to those plans which,\r\nif adopted, will elevate us to an equality, socially, morally,\r\nintellectually, industrially, politically, and financially, with the most\r\nflourishing and refined nation in the world, and, if possible, to place us\r\nin the van of even that, is the object of this work. Slaveholders, either\r\nfrom ignorance or from a wilful disposition to propagate error, contend\r\nthat the South has nothing to be ashamed of, that slavery has proved a\r\nblessing to her, and that her superiority over the North in an\r\nagricultural point of view makes amends for all her shortcomings in other\r\nrespects. On the other hand, we contend that many years of continual\r\nblushing and severe penance would not suffice to cancel or annul the shame\r\nand disgrace that justly attaches to the South in consequence of\r\nslavery--the direst evil that e'er befell the land--that the South bears\r\nnothing like even a respectable approximation to the North in navigation,\r\ncommerce, or manufactures, and that, contrary to the opinion entertained\r\nby ninety-nine hundredths of her people, she is far behind the free States\r\nin the only thing of which she has ever dared to boast--agriculture. We\r\nsubmit the question to the arbitration of figures, which, it is said, do\r\nnot lie. With regard to the bushel-measure products of the soil, of which\r\nwe have already taken an inventory, we have seen that there is a balance\r\nagainst the South in favor of the North of _seventeen million four hundred\r\nand twenty-three thousand one hundred and fifty-two bushels_, and a\r\ndifference in the value of the same, also in favor of the North, of\r\n_forty-four million seven hundred and eighty-two thousand six hundred and\r\nthirty-six dollars_. It is certainly a most novel kind of agricultural\r\nsuperiority that the South claims on that score!\r\n\r\nOur attention shall now be directed to the twelve principal pound-measure\r\nproducts of the free and of the slave States--hay, cotton, butter and\r\ncheese, tobacco, cane, sugar, wool, rice, hemp, maple sugar, beeswax and\r\nhoney, flax, and hops--and in taking an account of them, we shall, in\r\norder to show the exact quantity produced in each State, and for the\r\nconvenience of future reference, pursue the same plan as that adopted in\r\nthe preceding tables. Whether slavery will appear to better advantage on\r\nthe scales than it did in the half-bushel, remains to be seen. It is\r\npossible that the rickety monster may make a better show on a new track;\r\nif it makes a more ridiculous display, we shall not be surprised. A\r\ncareful examination of its precedents, has taught us the folly of\r\nexpecting anything good to issue from it in any manner whatever. It has no\r\ndisposition to emulate the magnanimity of its betters, and as for a\r\nlaudable ambition to excel, that is a characteristic altogether foreign to\r\nits nature. Languor and inertia are the insalutary viands upon which it\r\ndelights to satiate its morbid appetite; and \"from bad to worse\" is the\r\nill-omened motto under which, in all its feeble efforts and achievements,\r\nit ekes out a most miserable and deleterious existence.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

In this comparison with the South, neither\r\nhundreds, thousands, nor millions, according to the regular method of\r\ncomputation, are sufficient to exhibit the excess of the pound-measure\r\nproducts of the North. Recourse must be had to an almost inconceivable\r\nnumber; billions must be called into play; and there are the figures\r\ntelling us, with unmistakable emphasis and distinctness, that, in this\r\ndepartment of agriculture, as in every other, the North is vastly the\r\nsuperior of the South--the figures showing a total balance in favor of the\r\nformer of _twenty-four billion five hundred and thirty-nine million six\r\nhundred and ninety-four thousand two hundred and forty-one pounds_, valued\r\nat _fifty-nine million one hundred and ninety-nine thousand one hundred\r\nand eight dollars_. And yet, the North is a poor, God-forsaken country,\r\nbleak, inhospitable, and unproductive!\r\n\r\nWhat next? Is it necessary to adduce other facts in order to prove that\r\nthe rural wealth of the free States is far greater than that of the slave\r\nStates? Shall we make a further demonstration of the fertility of northern\r\nsoil, or bring forward new evidences of the inefficient and desolating\r\nsystem of terra-culture in the South? Will nothing less than\r\n\"confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ,\" suffice to convince the\r\nSouth that she is standing in her own light, and ruining both body and\r\nsoul by the retention of slavery? Whatever duty and expedience require to\r\nbe done, we are willing to do. Additional proofs are at hand. Slaveholders\r\nand slave-breeders shall be convinced, confuted, convicted, and converted.\r\nThey shall, in their hearts and consciences, if not with their tongues and\r\npens, bear testimony to the triumphant achievements of free labor. In the\r\ntwo tables which immediately follow these remarks, they shall see how much\r\nmore vigorous and fruitful the soil is when under the prudent management\r\nof free white husbandmen, than it is when under the rude and\r\nnature-murdering tillage of enslaved negroes; and in two subsequent tables\r\nthey shall find that the live stock, slaughtered animals, farms, and\r\nfarming implements and machinery, in the free States, are worth at least\r\n_one thousand million of dollars_ more than the market value of the same\r\nin the slave States! In the face, however, of all these most significant\r\nand incontrovertible facts, the oligarchy have the unparalleled audacity\r\nto tell us that the South is the greatest agricultural country in the\r\nworld, and that the North is a dreary waste, unfit for cultivation, and\r\nquite dependent on us for the necessaries of life.

They demonstrate conclusively the great moral triumph of\r\nLiberty over Slavery. They show unequivocally, in spite of all the blarney\r\nand boasting of slave-driving politicians, that the entire value of all\r\nthe agricultural interests of the free States is very nearly twice as\r\ngreat as the entire value of all the agricultural interests of the slave\r\nStates--the value of those interests in the former being twenty-five\r\nhundred million of dollars, that of those in the latter only fourteen\r\nhundred million, leaving a balance in favor of the free States of _one\r\nbillion one hundred and eighty-eight million two hundred and ninety-nine\r\nthousand eight hundred and three dollars_! That is what we call a full,\r\nfair and complete vindication of Free Labor. Would we not be correct in\r\ncalling it a total eclipse of the Black Orb? Can it be possible that the\r\nslavocracy will ever have the hardihood to open their mouths again on the\r\nsubject of terra-culture in the South? Dare they ever think of cotton\r\nagain? Ought they not, as a befitting confession of their crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors, and as a reasonable expiation for the countless evils which\r\nthey have inflicted on society, to clothe themselves in sackcloth, and,\r\nafter a suitable season of contrition and severe penance, follow the\r\nexample of one Judas Iscariot, and go and hang themselves?\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we have omitted the Territories and the District\r\nof Columbia in all the preceding tables. We did this purposely. Our object\r\nwas to draw an equitable comparison between the value of free and slave\r\nlabor in the thirty-one sovereign States, where the two systems,\r\ncomparatively unaffected by the wrangling of politicians, and, as a matter\r\nof course, free from the interference of the general government, have had\r\nthe fullest opportunities to exert their influence, to exhibit their\r\nvirtues, and to commend themselves to the sober judgments of enlightened\r\nand discriminating minds. Had we counted the Territories on the side of\r\nthe North, and the District of Columbia on the side of the South, the\r\nresult would have been still greater in behalf of free labor. Though \"the\r\nsum of all villanies\" has but a mere nominal existence in Delaware and\r\nMaryland, we have invariably counted those States on the side of the\r\nSouth; and the consequence is, that, in many particulars, the hopeless\r\nfortunes of slavery have been propped up and sustained by an imposing\r\narray of figures which of right ought to be regarded as the property of\r\nfreedom. But we like to be generous to an unfortunate foe, and would\r\nutterly disdain the use of any unfair means of attack or defence.\r\n\r\nWe shall take no undue advantage of slavery. It shall have a fair trial,\r\nand be judged according to its deserts. Already has it been weighed in the\r\nbalance, and found wanting; it has been measured in the half-bushel, and\r\nfound wanting; it has been apprized in the field, and found wanting.\r\nWhatever redeeming traits or qualities it may possess, if any, shall be\r\nbrought to light by subjecting it to other tests.\r\n\r\nIt was our desire and intention to furnish a correct table of the\r\ngallon-measure products of the several States of the Union; but we have\r\nnot been successful in our attempt to procure the necessary statistics.\r\nEnough is known, however, to satisfy us that the value of the milk, wine,\r\nardent spirits, malt liquors, fluids, oils, and molasses, annually\r\nproduced and sold in the free States, is at least fifty millions of\r\ndollars greater than the value of the same articles annually produced and\r\nsold in the slave States. Of sweet milk alone, it is estimated that the\r\nmonthly sales in three Northern cities, New York, Philadelphia and Boston,\r\namount to a larger sum than the marketable value of all the rosin, tar,\r\npitch, and turpentine, annually produced in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nOur efforts to obtain reliable information respecting another very\r\nimportant branch of profitable industry, the lumber business, have also\r\nproved unavailing; and we are left to conjecture as to the amount of\r\nrevenue annually derived from it in the two grand divisions of our\r\ncountry. The person whose curiosity prompts him to take an account of the\r\nimmense piles of Northern lumber now lying on the wharves and houseless\r\nlots in Baltimore, Richmond, and other slaveholding cities, will not, we\r\nimagine, form a very flattering opinion of the products of Southern\r\nforests. Let it be remembered that nearly all the clippers, steamers, and\r\nsmall craft, are built at the North; that large cargoes of Eastern lumber\r\nare exported to foreign countries; that nine-tenths of the wooden-ware\r\nused in the Southern States is manufactured in New England; that, in\r\noutrageous disregard of the natural rights and claims of Southern\r\nmechanics, the markets of the South are forever filled with Northern\r\nfurniture, vehicles, ax helves, walking canes, yard-sticks, clothes-pins\r\nand pen-holders; that the extraordinary number of factories,\r\nsteam-engines, forges and machine-shops in the free States, require an\r\nextraordinary quantity of cord-wood; that a large majority of the\r\nmagnificent edifices and other structures, both private and public, in\r\nwhich timber, in its various forms, is extensively used, are to be found\r\nin the free States--we say, let all these things be remembered, and the\r\ntruth will at once flash across the mind that the forests of the North are\r\na source of far greater income than those of the South. The difference is\r\nsimply this: At the North everything is turned to advantage. When a tree\r\nis cut down, the main body is sold or used for lumber, railing or paling,\r\nthe stump for matches and shoepegs, the knees for ship-building, and the\r\nbranches for fuel. At the South everything is either neglected or\r\nmismanaged. Whole forests are felled by the ruthless hand of slavery, the\r\ntrees are cut into logs, rolled into heaps, covered with the limbs and\r\nbrush, and then burned on the identical soil that gave them birth. The\r\nland itself next falls a prey to the fell destroyer, and that which was\r\nonce a beautiful, fertile and luxuriant woodland, is soon despoiled of all\r\nits treasures, and converted into an eye-offending desert.\r\n\r\nWere we to go beneath the soil and collect all the mineral and lapidarious\r\nwealth of the free States, we should find it so much greater than the\r\ncorresponding wealth of the slave States, that no ordinary combination of\r\nfigures would suffice to express the difference. To say nothing of the\r\ngold and quicksilver of California, the iron and coal of Pennsylvania, the\r\ncopper of Michigan, the lead of Illinois, or the salt of New-York, _the\r\nmarble and freestone quarries of New England are, incredible as it may\r\nseem to those unacquainted with the facts, far more important sources of\r\nrevenue than all the subterranean deposits in the slave States_. From the\r\nmost reliable statistics within our reach, we are led to the inference\r\nthat the total value of all the precious metals, rocks, minerals, and\r\nmedicinal waters, annually extracted from the bowels of the free States,\r\nis not less than eighty-five million of dollars; the whole value of the\r\nsame substances annually brought up from beneath the surface of the slave\r\nStates does not exceed twelve millions. In this respect to what is our\r\npoverty ascribable? To the same cause that has impoverished and dishonored\r\nus in all other respects--the thriftless and degrading institution of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nNature has been kind to us in all things. The strata and substrata of the\r\nSouth are profusely enriched with gold and silver, and precious stones,\r\nand from the natural orifices and aqueducts in Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, flow the purest healing waters in the world. But of what avail\r\nis all this latent wealth? Of what avail will it ever be, so long as\r\nslavery is permitted to play the dog in the manger? To these queries there\r\ncan be but one reply. Slavery must be suppressed; the South, so great and\r\nso glorious by nature, must be reclaimed from her infamy and degradation;\r\nour cities, fields and forests, must be kept intact from the unsparing\r\nmonster; the various and ample resources of our vast domain, subterraneous\r\nas well as superficial, must be developed, and made to contribute to our\r\npleasures and to the necessities of the world.\r\n\r\nA very significant chapter, and one particularly pertinent to many of the\r\npreceding pages, might be written on the Decline of Agriculture in the\r\nSlave States; but as the press of other subjects admonishes us to be\r\nconcise upon this point, we shall present only a few of the more striking\r\ninstances. In the first place, let us compare the crops of wheat and rye\r\nin Kentucky, in 1850, with the corresponding crops in the same State in\r\n1840--after which, we will apply a similar rule of comparison to two or\r\nthree other slaveholding states.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n                        Wheat, bus.

What\r\nirrefragable evidence of the unequaled efficacy and grandeur of free\r\ninstitutions! These figures are, indeed, too full of meaning to be passed\r\nby without comment. The two tables from which they are borrowed are at\r\nleast a volume within themselves; and, after all the pains we have taken\r\nto compile them, we shall, perhaps, feel somewhat disappointed if the\r\nreader fails to avail himself of the important information they impart.\r\n\r\nHuman life, in all ages, has been made up of a series of adventures and\r\nexperiments, and even at this stage of the world's existence, we are\r\nalmost as destitute of a perfect rule of action, secular or religious, as\r\nwere the erratic cotemporaries of Noah. It is true, however, that we have\r\nmade some progress in the right direction; and as it seems to be the\r\ntendency of the world to correct itself, we may suppose that future\r\ngenerations will be enabled, by intuition, to discriminate between the\r\ntrue and the false, the good and the bad, and that with the development of\r\nthis faculty of the mind, error and discord will begin to wane, and\r\nfinally cease to exist. Of all the experiments that have been tried by the\r\npeople in America, slavery has proved the most fatal; and the sooner it is\r\nabolished the better it will be for us, for posterity, and for the world.\r\nOne of the evils resulting from it, and that not the least, is apparent in\r\nthe figures above. Indeed, the _unprofitableness_ of slavery is a\r\nmonstrous evil, when considered in all its bearings; it makes us poor;\r\npoverty makes us ignorant; ignorance makes us wretched; wretchedness makes\r\nus wicked, and wickedness leads to the devil!\r\n\r\n  \"Ignorance is the curse of God,\r\n  Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nFacts truly astounding are disclosed in the two last tables, and we could\r\nheartily wish that every intelligent American would commit them to memory.\r\nThe total value of all the real and personal property of the free States,\r\nwith an area of only 612,597 square miles, is one billion one hundred and\r\nsixty-six million eighty-one thousand three hundred and seventy-one\r\ndollars greater than the total value of all the real and personal\r\nproperty, including the price of 3,204,313 negroes, of the slave States,\r\nwhich have an area of 851,508 square miles! But extraordinary as this\r\ndifference is in favor of the North, it is much less than the true amount.\r\n_On the authority of Southrons themselves, it is demonstrable beyond the\r\npossibility of refutation that the intrinsic value of all the property in\r\nthe free States is more than three times greater than the intrinsic value\r\nof all the property in the slave States._\r\n\r\nJames Madison, a Southern man, fourth President of the United States, a\r\nmost correct thinker, and one of the greatest statesmen the country has\r\nproduced, \"thought it wrong to admit the idea that there could be property\r\nin man,\" and we indorse, to the fullest extent, this opinion of the\r\nprofound editor of the _Federalist_. We shall not recognize property in\r\nman; the slaves of the South are not worth a groat in any civilized\r\ncommunity; no man of genuine decency and refinement would hold them as\r\nproperty on any terms; in the eyes of all enlightened nations and\r\nindividuals, they are men, not merchandize. Southern pro-slavery\r\npoliticians, some of whom have not hesitated to buy and sell their own\r\nsons and daughters, boast that the slaves of the South are worth sixteen\r\nhundred million of dollars, and we have seen the amount estimated as high\r\nas two thousand million. Mr. De Bow, the Southern superintendent of the\r\nseventh census, informs us that the value of all the property in the slave\r\nStates, real and personal, including slaves, was, in 1850, only\r\n$2,936,090,737; while, according to the same authority, the value of all\r\nthe real and personal property in the free States, genuine property,\r\nproperty that is everywhere recognized as property, was, at the same time,\r\n$4,102,172,108. Now all we have to do in order to ascertain the real value\r\nof all the property of the South, independent of negroes, whose value, if\r\nvaluable at all, is of a local and precarious character, is to subtract\r\nfrom the sum total of Mr. De Bow's return of the entire wealth of the\r\nslave States the estimated value of the slaves themselves; and then, by\r\ndeducting the difference from the intrinsic value of all the property in\r\nthe free States, we shall have the exact amount of the overplus of wealth\r\nin the glorious land of free soil, free labor, free speech, free presses,\r\nand free schools. And now to the task.\r\n\r\n  Entire Wealth of the Slave States, including Slaves,   $2,936,090,737\r\n  Estimated Value of the Slaves,                          1,600,000,000\r\n                                                          -------------\r\n      True Wealth of the Slave States,                   $1,336,090,737\r\n\r\n\r\n  True Wealth of the Free States,                        $4,102,172,108\r\n  True Wealth of the Slave States,                        1,336,090,737\r\n                                                         --------------\r\n      Balance in favor of the Free States                $2,766,081,371\r\n\r\nThere, friends of the South and of the North, you have the conclusion of\r\nthe whole matter. Liberty and slavery are before you; choose which you\r\nwill have; as for us, in the memorable language of the immortal Henry, we\r\nsay, \"give us liberty, or give us death!\" In the great struggle for wealth\r\nthat has been going on between the two rival systems of free and slave\r\nlabor, the balance above exhibits the net profits of the former. The\r\nstruggle on the one side has been calm, laudable, and eminently\r\nsuccessful; on the other, it has been attended by tumult, unutterable\r\ncruelties and disgraceful failure. We have given the slave drivers every\r\nconceivable opportunity to vindicate their domestic policy, but for them\r\nto do it is a moral impossibility.\r\n\r\nLess than three-quarters of a century ago--say in 1789, for that was about\r\nthe average time of the abolition of slavery in the Northern States--the\r\nSouth, with advantages in soil, climate, rivers, harbors, minerals,\r\nforests, and, indeed, almost every other natural resource, began an even\r\nrace with the North in all the important pursuits of life; and now, in the\r\nbrief space of scarce three score years and ten, we find her completely\r\ndistanced, enervated, dejected and dishonored. Slave-drivers are the sole\r\nauthors of her disgrace; as they have sown so let them reap.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen above, a careful and correct inventory of all the real and\r\npersonal _property_ in the two grand divisions of the country, discloses\r\nthe astounding fact that, in 1850 the free States were worth precisely\r\n_two thousand seven hundred and sixty-six million eighty-one thousand\r\nthree hundred and seventy-one dollars_ more than the slave States!\r\nTwenty-seven hundred and sixty-six million of dollars!--Think of it! What\r\na vast and desirable sum, and how much better off the South would be with\r\nit than without it! Such is the enormous amount out of which slavery has\r\ndefrauded us during the space of sixty-one years--from 1789 to 1850--being\r\nan average of about forty-five million three hundred and fifty thousand\r\ndollars per annum. During the last twenty-five or thirty years, however,\r\nour annual losses have been far greater than they were formerly. There has\r\nbeen a gradual increase every year, and now the ratio of increase is\r\nalmost incredible. No patriotic Southerner can become conversant with the\r\nfacts without experiencing a feeling of alarm and indignation. Until the\r\nNorth abolished slavery, she had no advantage of us whatever; the South\r\nwas more than her equal in every respect. But no sooner had she got rid of\r\nthat hampering and pernicious institution than she began to absorb our\r\nwealth, and now it is confidently believed that the merchants and\r\nnegro-driving pleasure-seekers of the South annually pour one hundred and\r\ntwenty million of dollars into her coffers! Taking into account, then, the\r\nprobable amount of money that has been drawn from the South and invested\r\nin the North within the last six years, and adding it to the grand balance\r\nabove--the net profits of the North up to 1850--it may be safely assumed\r\nthat, in the present year of grace, 1857, _the free States are worth at\r\nleast thirty-four hundred million of dollars more than the slave States_!\r\nLet him who dares, gainsay these remarks and calculations; no truthful\r\ntongue will deny them; no honorable pen can controvert them.\r\n\r\nOne more word now as to the valuation of negroes. Were our nature so\r\ndegraded, or our conscience so elastic as to permit us to set a price upon\r\nmen, as we would set a price upon cattle and corn, we should be content to\r\nabide by the appraisement of the slaves of the South, and would then enter\r\ninto a calculation to ascertain the value of foreigners to the North. Not\r\nlong since, it was declared in the South that \"one free laborer is equal\r\nto five slaves,\" and as there are two million five hundred thousand\r\nEuropeans in the free States, all of whom are free laborers, we might\r\nbring Southern authority to back us in estimating their value at\r\n_sixty-two hundred million of dollars_--a handsome sum wherewithal to\r\noffset the account of _sixteen hundred million of dollars_, brought\r\nforward as the value of Southern slaves! It is obvious, therefore, that if\r\nwe were disposed to follow the barbarian example of the traffickers in\r\nhuman flesh, we could prove the North vastly richer than the South in bone\r\nand sinew--to say nothing of mind and morals, which shall receive our\r\nattention hereafter. The North has just as good a right to appraise the\r\nIrish immigrant, as the South has to set a price on the African slave. But\r\nas it would be wrong to do either, we shall do neither. It is not our\r\nbusiness to think of man as a merchantable commodity; and we will not,\r\neven by implication, admit \"the wild and guilty fantasy,\" that the\r\ncondition of chattelhood may rightfully attach to sentient and immortal\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, we would direct the special attention of the reader\r\nto the following eloquent passage, exhibiting the philosophy of free and\r\nslave labor, from the facile pen of the editor of the _North American and\r\nUnited States Gazette_:\r\n\r\n\"In the very nature of things, the freeman must produce more than the\r\nslave. There is no conclusion of science more certain. Under a system\r\nwhich gives to a laboring man the fruit of his toil, there is every motive\r\nto render him diligent and assiduous. If he relies on being employed by\r\nothers, his wages rise with his reputation for industry, skill, and\r\nfaithfulness. And as owner of the soil, there is every assurance that he\r\nwill do what he can to cultivate it to the best advantage, and develope\r\nits latent wealth. Self-interest will call forth what powers of intellect\r\nand of invention he has to aid him in his work, and employ his physical\r\nstrength to the greatest possible advantage. Free labor receives an\r\nimmediate reward, which cheers and invigorates it; and above all, it has\r\nthat chief spring of exertion, hope, whose bow always spans the heaven\r\nbefore it. It has an inviolate hearth; it has a home. But it looks forward\r\nto a still better condition, to brighter prospects in the future, to which\r\nits efforts all contribute. The children in such a household are chief\r\ninducements to nerve the arm of labor, that they may be properly cared\r\nfor, fed, clothed, educated, accomplished, instructed in some useful and\r\nhonorable calling, and provided for when they shall go out upon the world.\r\nAll its sentiments, religious and otherwise, all its affections for\r\nparents and kindred, all its tastes are so many impelling and stimulating\r\nforces. It is disposed to read, to ornament its home, to travel, to enjoy\r\nsocial intercourse, and to attain these ends, it rises to higher exertions\r\nand a stricter economy of time; it explores every path of employment, and\r\nis, therefore, in the highest degree productive.\r\n\r\n\"How different is it with slave labor! The slave toils for another, and\r\nnot for himself. Whether he does little or much, whether his work is well\r\nor ill performed, he has a subsistence, nothing less, nothing more; and\r\nwhy should he toil beyond necessity? He cannot accumulate any property for\r\nthe decline of his years, or to leave to his children when he is departed.\r\nNay, he cannot toil to better the present condition of his children. They\r\nbelong to another, and not to him. He cannot supply his hut with comforts,\r\nor embellish it with the adornments of taste. He does not read. He does\r\nnot journey for pleasure. Inducements to exertion, he has none. That he\r\nmay adapt himself to his condition, and enjoy the present hour, he deadens\r\nthose aspirations that must always be baffled in his case, and sinks down\r\ninto ease and sensuality. His mind is unlighted and untutored; dark with\r\nignorance. Among those who value him most, he is proverbially indolent,\r\nthievish, and neglectful of his master's interests. It is common for even\r\nthe advocates of slavery to declare that one freeman is worth half a dozen\r\nslaves. With every cord to exertion thus sundered, the mind benighted, the\r\nman nearly lost in the animal, it requires no deep philosophy to see why\r\nlabor cannot be near as productive as it would be were these conditions\r\nall reversed. Though ever so well directed by the superior skill, and\r\nurged forward by the strong arm of the master, slave labor is necessarily\r\na blight to the soil--sterility follows in its steps, and not afar off.\r\n\r\n\"What a difference, plain and heaven-wide, between the outward and\r\ninterior life of a slave and of a free community, resulting directly and\r\npalpably from this difference in its labor. The cottage-home, amid trees\r\nand shrubbery, its apartments well adorned and furnished, books on its\r\nshelves, and the passing literature of the day scattered around; the few,\r\nperhaps, but well-tilled acres, belonging to the man who tills them; the\r\nhappy children with sunny prospects; the frequent school; the church\r\narrayed with beauty; the thriving, handsome village; the flourishing\r\ncities and prosperous marts of trade; the busy factories; railroads,\r\ntraffic, travel--where free labor tills the ground, how beautiful it all\r\nis in contrast to the forlorn and dreary aspect of a country tilled by\r\nslaves. The villages of such a country are mainly groups of miserable\r\nhuts. Its comparatively few churches are too often dilapidated and\r\nunsightly. The common school-house, the poor man's college, is hardly\r\nknown, showing how little interest is felt in the chief treasures of the\r\nState, the immortal minds of the multitude who are not born to wealth. The\r\nsigns of premature old age are visibly impressed upon everything that\r\nmeets the eye. The fields present a dread monotony. Everywhere you see\r\nlands that are worn out, barren and deserted, in consequence of slave\r\ntillage, left for more fertile lands in newer regions, which are also, in\r\ntheir turn, to be smitten with sterility and forsaken. The free community\r\nmay increase its population almost without limit. The capacity of slave\r\ncountries to sustain a population is soon at an end, and then, it\r\ndiminishes. In all the elements of essential prosperity, in all that\r\nelevates man, how striking the contrast between the region that is tilled\r\nby slave, and the region that is tilled by free labor.\"\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing what Virginia, once the richest, most populous,\r\nand most powerful of the States, has become under the blight of slavery,\r\nwe shall now introduce an extract from one of the speeches delivered by\r\nHenry A. Wise, during the last gubernatorial campaign in that degraded\r\ncommonwealth. Addressing a Virginia audience, in language as graphic as it\r\nis truthful, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Commerce has long ago spread her sails, and sailed away from you. You\r\nhave not, as yet, dug more than coal enough to warm yourselves at your own\r\nhearths; you have set no tilt-hammer of Vulcan to strike blows worthy of\r\ngods in your own iron-foundries; you have not yet spun more than coarse\r\ncotton enough, in the way of manufacture, to clothe your own slaves. You\r\nhave no commerce, no mining, no manufactures. You have relied alone on the\r\nsingle power of agriculture, and _such agriculture_! Your sedge-patches\r\noutshine the sun. Your inattention to your only source of wealth, has\r\nseared the very bosom of mother earth. Instead of having to feed cattle on\r\na thousand hills, you have had to chase the stump-tailed steer through the\r\nsedge-patches to procure a tough beef-steak. The present condition of\r\nthings has existed too long in Virginia. The landlord has skinned the\r\ntenant, and the tenant has skinned the land, until all have grown poor\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nWith tears in its eyes, and truth on its lips, for the first time after an\r\ninterval of twenty years, the _Richmond Enquirer_ helps to paint the\r\nmelancholy picture. In 1852, that journal thus bewailed the condition of\r\nVirginia:--\r\n\r\n\"We have cause to feel deeply for our situation. Philadelphia herself\r\ncontains a population far greater than the whole free population of\r\nEastern Virginia. The little State of Massachusetts has an aggregate\r\nwealth exceeding that of Virginia by more than $126,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nJust a score of years before these words were penned, the same paper, then\r\nedited by the elder Ritchie, made a most earnest appeal to the\r\nintelligence and patriotism of Virginia, to adopt an effectual measure for\r\nthe speedy overthrow of the damnable institution of human bondage. Here is\r\nan extract from an article which appeared in its editorial column under\r\ndate of January 7th, 1832:\r\n\r\n\"Something must be done, and it is the part of no honest man to deny\r\nit--of no free press to affect to conceal it. When this dark population is\r\ngrowing upon us; when every new census is but gathering its appalling\r\nnumbers upon us; when, within a period equal to that in which this Federal\r\nConstitution has been in existence, these numbers will increase to more\r\nthan two millions within Virginia; when our sister States are closing\r\ntheir doors upon our blacks for sale, and when our whites are moving\r\nwestwardly in greater numbers than we like to hear of; when this, the\r\nfairest land on all this continent, for soil, and climate and situation,\r\ncombined, might become a sort of garden spot, if it were worked by the\r\nhands of white men alone, can we, ought we, to sit quietly down, fold our\r\narms, and say to each other, 'Well, well; this thing will not come to the\r\nworst in our days; we will leave it to our children, and our\r\ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren, to take care of themselves, and to\r\nbrave the storm!' Is this to act like wise men? Means, sure but gradual,\r\nsystematic but discreet, ought to be adopted, for reducing the mass of\r\nevil which is pressing upon the South, and will still more press upon her,\r\nthe longer it is put off. We say now, in the utmost sincerity of our\r\nhearts, that our wisest men cannot give too much of their attention to\r\nthis subject, nor can they give it too soon.\"\r\n\r\nBetter abolition doctrine than this is seldom heard. Why did not the\r\n_Enquirer_ continue to preach it? What potent influence hushed its clarion\r\nvoice, just as it began to be lifted in behalf of a liberal policy and an\r\nenlightened humanity? Had Mr. Ritchie continued to press the truth home to\r\nthe hearts of the people, as he should have done, Virginia, instead of\r\nbeing worth only $392,000,000 in 1850--negroes and all--would have been\r\nworth at least $800,000,000 in genuine property; and if the State had\r\nemancipated her slaves at the time of the adoption of the Constitution,\r\nthe last census would no doubt have reported her wealth, and correctly, at\r\na sum exceeding a thousand millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nListen now to the statement of a momentous fact. The value of all the\r\nproperty, real and personal, including slaves, in seven slave States,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida and\r\nTexas, is less than the real and personal estate, which is unquestionable\r\nproperty, in the single State of New-York. Nay, worse; if eight entire\r\nslave States, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Missouri,\r\nMississippi, Tennessee and Texas, and the District of Columbia--with all\r\ntheir hordes of human merchandize--were put up at auction, New-York could\r\nbuy them all, and then have one hundred and thirty-three millions of\r\ndollars left in her pocket! Such is the amazing contrast between freedom\r\nand slavery, even in a pecuniary point of view. When we come to compare\r\nthe North with the South in regard to literature, general intelligence,\r\ninventive genius, moral and religious enterprises, the discoveries in\r\nmedicine, and the progress in the arts and sciences, we shall, in every\r\ninstance, find the contrast equally great on the side of Liberty.\r\n\r\nIt gives us no pleasure to say hard things of the Old Dominion, the mother\r\nof Washington, Jefferson, Henry, and other illustrious patriots, who, as\r\nwe shall prove hereafter, were genuine abolitionists; but the policy which\r\nshe has pursued has been so utterly inexcusable, so unjust to the\r\nnon-slaveholding whites, so cruel to the negroes, and so disregardful of\r\nthe rights of humanity at large, that it becomes the duty of every one who\r\nmakes allusion to her history, to expose her follies, her crimes, and her\r\npoverty, and to publish every fact, of whatever nature, that would be\r\ninstrumental in determining others to eschew her bad example. She has\r\nwilfully departed from the faith of the founders of this Republic. She has\r\nnot only turned a deaf ear to the counsel of wise men from other States in\r\nthe Union, but she has, in like manner, ignored the teachings of the\r\ngreat warriors and statesmen who have sprung from her own soil. In a\r\nsubsequent chapter, we expect to show that all, or nearly all, the\r\ndistinguished Virginians, whose bodies have been consigned to the grave,\r\nbut whose names have been given to history, and whose memoirs have a place\r\nin the hearts of their countrymen, were the friends and advocates of\r\nuniversal freedom--that they were inflexibly opposed to the extension of\r\nslavery into the Territories, devised measures for its restriction, and,\r\nwith hopeful anxiety, looked forward to the time when it should be\r\neradicated from the States themselves. With them, the rescue of our\r\ncountry from British domination, and the establishment of the General\r\nGovernment upon a firm basis, were considerations of paramount importance;\r\nthey supposed, and no doubt earnestly desired, that the States, in their\r\nsovereign capacities, would soon abolish an institution which was so\r\npalpably in conflict with the principles enunciated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Indeed, it would seem that, among the framers of that\r\nimmortal instrument and its equally immortal sequel, the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, there was a tacit understanding to this effect; and the\r\nNorthern States, true to their implied faith, abolished it within a short\r\nperiod after our national independence had been secured. Not so with the\r\nSouth. She has pertinaciously refused to perform her duty. She has\r\napostatized from the faith of her greatest men, and even at this very\r\nmoment repudiates the sacred principle that \"all men are endowed by their\r\nCreator with certain unalienable rights,\" among which \"are life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness.\" It is evident, therefore, that the free\r\nStates are the only members of this confederacy that have established\r\nrepublican forms of government based upon the theories of Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, Henry, and other eminent statesmen of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe great revolutionary movement which was set on foot in Charlotte,\r\nMecklenburg county, North Carolina, on the 20th day of May, 1775, has not\r\nyet been terminated, nor will it be, until every slave in the United\r\nStates is freed from the tyranny of his master. Every victim of the vile\r\ninstitution, whether white or black, must be reinvested with the sacred\r\nrights and privileges of which he has been deprived by an inhuman\r\noligarchy. What our noble sires of the revolution left unfinished it is\r\nour duty to complete. They did all that true valor and patriotism could\r\naccomplish. Not one iota did they swerve from their plighted faith; the\r\nself-sacrificing spirit which they evinced will command the applause of\r\nevery succeeding age. Not in vindication of their own personal rights\r\nmerely, but of the rights of humanity; not for their own generation and\r\nage simply, but for all ages to the end of time, they gave their toil,\r\ntheir treasure and their blood, nor deemed them all too great a price to\r\npay for the establishment of so comprehensive and beneficent a principle.\r\nLet their posterity emulate their courage, their disinterestedness, and\r\ntheir zeal, and especially remember that it is the duty of every existing\r\ngeneration so to provide for its individual interests, as to confer\r\nsuperior advantages on that which is to follow. To this principle the\r\nNorth has adhered with the strictest fidelity. How has it been with the\r\nSouth? Has she imitated the praiseworthy example of our illustrious\r\nancestors? No! She has treated it with the utmost contempt; she has been\r\nextremely selfish--so selfish, indeed, that she has robbed posterity of\r\nits natural rights. From the period of the formation of the government\r\ndown to the present moment, her policy has been downright suicidal, and,\r\nas a matter of course, wholly indefensible. She has hugged a viper to her\r\nbreast; her whole system has been paralyzed, her conscience is seared, and\r\nshe is becoming callous to every principle of justice and magnanimity.\r\nExcept among the non-slaveholders, who, besides being kept in the grossest\r\nignorance, are under the restraint of all manner of iniquitous laws,\r\npatriotism has ceased to exist within her borders. And here we desire to\r\nbe distinctly understood, for we shall have occasion to refer to this\r\nmatter again. We repeat, therefore, the substance of our averment, that,\r\nat this day, there is not a grain of patriotism in the South, except among\r\nthe non-slaveholders. Subsequent pages shall testify to the truth of this\r\nassertion. Here and there, it is true, a slaveholder, disgusted with the\r\ninstitution, becomes ashamed of himself, emancipates his negroes, and\r\nenters upon the walks of honorable life; but these cases are exceedingly\r\nrare, and do not, in any manner, disprove the general correctness of our\r\nremark. All persons who do voluntarily manumit their slaves, as mentioned\r\nabove, are undeniably actuated by principles of pure patriotism, justice\r\nand humanity; and so believing, we delight to do them honor.\r\n\r\nOnce more to the Old Dominion. At her door we lay the bulk of the evils of\r\nslavery. The first African sold in America was sold on James River, in\r\nthat State, on the 20th of August, 1620; and although the institution was\r\nfastened upon her and the other colonies by the mother country, she was\r\nthe first to perceive its blighting and degrading influences, her wise men\r\nwere the first to denounce it, and, after the British power was overthrown\r\nat York Town, she should have been the first to abolish it. Fifty-seven\r\nyears ago she was the Empire State; now, with half a dozen other\r\nslaveholding states thrown into the scale with her, she is far inferior to\r\nNew-York, which, at the time Cornwallis surrendered his sword to\r\nWashington, was less than half her equal. Had she obeyed the counsels of\r\nthe good, the great and the wise men of our nation--especially of her own\r\nincomparable sons, the extendible element of slavery would have been\r\npromptly arrested, and the virgin soil of nine Southern States, Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida,\r\nand Texas, would have been saved from its horrid pollutions. Confined to\r\nthe original states in which it existed, the institution would soon have\r\nbeen disposed of by legislative enactments, and long before the present\r\nday, by a gradual process that could have shocked no interest and alarmed\r\nno prejudice, we should have rid ourselves not only of African slavery,\r\nwhich is an abomination and a curse, but also of the negroes themselves,\r\nwho, in our judgment, whether viewed in relation to their actual\r\ncharacteristics and condition, or through the strong antipathies of the\r\nwhites, are, to say the least, an undesirable population.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the ground of our expostulation with Virginia: that, in\r\nstubborn disregard of the advice and friendly warnings of Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, Henry, and a host of other distinguished patriots who\r\nsprang from her soil--patriots whose voices shall be heard before we\r\nfinish our task--and in utter violation of every principle of justice and\r\nhumanity, _she still persists_ in fostering an institution which is so\r\nmanifestly detrimental to her vital interests. Every Virginian, whether\r\nliving or dead, whose name is an honor to his country, has placed on\r\nrecord his abhorrence of slavery, and in doing so, has borne testimony to\r\nthe blight and degradation that everywhere follow in its course. One of\r\nthe best abolition speeches we have ever read was delivered in the\r\nVirginia House of Delegates, January 20th, 1832, by Charles James\r\nFaulkner, who still lives, and who has, we understand, generously\r\nemancipated several of his slaves, and sent them to Liberia. Here follows\r\nan extract from his speech; let Southern politicians read it attentively,\r\nand imbibe a moiety of the spirit of patriotism which it breathes:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I am gratified to perceive that no gentleman has yet risen in this\r\nHall, the avowed advocate of slavery. _The day has gone by when such a\r\nvoice could be listened to with patience, or even with forbearance._ I\r\neven regret, Sir, that we should find those amongst us who enter the lists\r\nof discussion as its _apologists_, except alone upon the ground of\r\nuncontrollable necessity. And yet, who could have listened to the very\r\neloquent remarks of the gentleman from Brunswick, without being forced to\r\nconclude that he at least considered slavery, however _not to be defended\r\nupon principle_, yet as being divested of much of its enormity, as you\r\napproach it in practice.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if there be one who concurs with that gentleman in the harmless\r\ncharacter of this institution, let me request him to compare the condition\r\nof the slaveholding portion of this commonwealth--_barren, desolate, and\r\nseared as it were by the avenging hand of Heaven_--with the descriptions\r\nwhich we have of this country from those who first broke its virgin soil.\r\nTo what is this change ascribable? _Alone to the withering and blasting\r\neffects of slavery._ If this does not satisfy him, let me request him to\r\nextend his travels to the _Northern States of this Union_, and beg him to\r\ncontrast the happiness and contentment which prevail throughout that\r\ncountry, the busy and cheerful sound of industry, the rapid and swelling\r\ngrowth of their population, their means and institutions of education,\r\ntheir skill and proficiency in the useful arts, their enterprise and\r\npublic spirit, the monuments of their commercial and manufacturing\r\nindustry; and, above all, their devoted attachment to the government from\r\nwhich they derive their protection, _with the derision, discontent,\r\nindolence, and poverty of the Southern country_. To what, Sir, is all this\r\nascribable? _To that vice in the organization of society, by which\r\none-half of its inhabitants are arrayed in interest and feeling against\r\nthe other half_--to that unfortunate state of society in which freemen\r\nregard labor as disgraceful, and slaves shrink from it as a burden\r\ntyrannically imposed upon them--to that condition of things in which half\r\na million of your population can feel no sympathy with the society in the\r\nprosperity of which they are forbidden to participate, and no attachment\r\nto a government at whose hands they receive nothing but injustice.\r\n\r\n\"If this should not be sufficient, and the curious and incredulous\r\ninquirer should suggest that the contrast which has been adverted to, and\r\nwhich is so manifest, might be traced to a difference of climate, or other\r\ncauses distinct from slavery itself, permit me to refer him to the two\r\nStates of Kentucky and Ohio. No difference of soil, no diversity of\r\nclimate, no diversity in the original settlement of those two States, can\r\naccount for the remarkable disproportion in their natural advancement.\r\nSeparated by a river alone, _they seem to have been purposely and\r\nprovidentially designed to exhibit in their future histories the\r\ndifference which necessarily results from a country free from, and a\r\ncountry afflicted with, the curse of slavery_.\r\n\r\n\"Vain and idle is every effort to strangle this inquiry. As well might you\r\nattempt to chain the ocean, or stay the avenging thunderbolts of Heaven,\r\nas to drive the people from any inquiry which may result in their better\r\ncondition. This is too deep, too engrossing a subject of consideration. It\r\naddresses itself too strongly to our interests, to our passions, and to\r\nour feelings. I shall advocate no scheme that does not respect the right\r\nof property, _so far as it is entitled to be respected_, with a just\r\nregard to the safety and resources of the State. I would approach the\r\nsubject as one of great magnitude and delicacy, as one whose varied and\r\nmomentous consequences demand the calmest and most deliberate\r\ninvestigation. But still, Sir, I would approach it--aye, delicate as it\r\nmay be, encompassed as it may be with difficulties and hazards, I would\r\nstill approach it. The people demand it. Their security requires it. In\r\nthe language of the wise and prophetic Jefferson, 'You must approach\r\nit--you must bear it--you must adopt some plan of emancipation, or worse\r\nwill follow.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis, in a speech in the Virginia Legislature in 1832, said:\r\n\r\n\"There is a malaria in the atmosphere of these regions, which the new\r\ncomer shuns, as being deleterious to his views and habits. See the\r\nwide-spreading ruin which the avarice of our ancestral government has\r\nproduced in the South, as witnessed in a sparse population of freemen,\r\ndeserted habitations, and fields without culture! Strange to tell, even\r\nthe wolf, driven back long since by the approach of man, now returns,\r\nafter the lapse of a hundred years, to howl over the desolations of\r\nslavery.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Moore, also a member of the Legislature of Virginia, in speaking of\r\nthe evils of slavery, said:\r\n\r\n\"The first I shall mention is the irresistible tendency which it has to\r\nundermine and destroy everything like virtue and morality in the\r\ncommunity. If we look back through the long course of time which has\r\nelapsed since the creation to the present moment, we shall scarcely be\r\nable to point out a people whose situation was not, in many respects,\r\npreferable to our own, and that of the other States, in which negro\r\nslavery exists.\r\n\r\n\"In that part of the State below tide-water, the whole face of the country\r\nwears an appearance of almost utter desolation, distressing to the\r\nbeholder. The very spot on which our ancestors landed, a little more than\r\ntwo hundred years ago, appears to be on the eve of again becoming the\r\nhaunt of wild beasts.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rives, of Campbell county, said:\r\n\r\n\"On the multiplied and desolating evils of slavery, he was not disposed to\r\nsay much. The curse and deteriorating consequence were within the\r\nobservation and experience of the members of the House and the people of\r\nVirginia, and it did not seem to him that there could be two opinions\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Powell said:\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely persuade myself that there is a solitary gentleman in this\r\nHouse who will not readily admit that slavery is an evil, and that its\r\nremoval, if practicable, is a consummation most devoutly to be wished. I\r\nhave not heard, nor do I expect to hear, a voice raised in this Hall to\r\nthe contrary.\"\r\n\r\nIn the language of another, \"we might multiply extracts almost\r\nindefinitely from Virginia authorities--testifying to the blight and\r\ndegradation that have overtaken the Old Dominion, in every department of\r\nher affairs. Her commerce gone, her agriculture decaying, her land falling\r\nin value, her mining and manufactures nothing, her schools dying out,--she\r\npresents, according to the testimony of her own sons, the saddest of all\r\npictures--that of a sinking and dying State.\" Every year leaves her in a\r\nworse condition than it found her; and as it is with Virginia, so it is\r\nwith the entire South. In the terse language of Governor Wise, \"all have\r\ngrown poor together.\" The black god of slavery, which the South has\r\nworshipped for two hundred and thirty-seven years, is but a devil in\r\ndisguise; and if we would save ourselves from being engulphed in utter\r\nruin we must repudiate this foul god, for a purer deity, and abandon his\r\naltars for a holier shrine. No time is to be lost; his fanatical adorers,\r\nthe despotic adversaries of human liberty, are concocting schemes for the\r\nenslavement of all the laboring classes irrespective of race or color. The\r\nissue is before us; we cannot evade it; we must meet it with firmness, and\r\nwith unflinching valor.\r\n\r\nWhat it was that paralyzed the tongues of all those members of the Virgina\r\nLegislature, who, at the session of 1831-'32, distinguished themselves by\r\nadvocating a system of emancipation, is a mystery that has never yet been\r\nsolved. Whether any or all of them shared a division of spoils with a\r\ncertain newspaper editor, we have no means of knowing; but if all accounts\r\nbe true, there was consummated in Richmond, in the latter part of the year\r\n1832, one of the blackest schemes of bribery and corruption that was ever\r\nperpetrated in this or any other country. We are assured, however, that\r\none thing is certain, and it is this: that the negro population of\r\nVirginia was very considerably and suddenly decreased by forcible\r\nemigration--that a large gang was driven further South, sold, and the\r\nproceeds divided among certain renegades and traitors, who, Judas-like,\r\nhad agreed to serve the devil for a price.\r\n\r\nWe would fain avoid all personalities and uncomplimentary allusions to the\r\ndead, but when men, from love of lucre, from mere selfish motives, or from\r\nsheer turpitude of heart, inflict great injuries and outrages on the\r\npublic, their villainy ought to be exposed, so that others may be deterred\r\nfrom following in their footsteps. As a general rule, man's moral nature\r\nis, we believe, so strong that it invariably prompts him to eschew vice\r\nand practice virtue--in other words, to do right; but this rule, like all\r\nothers, has its exceptions, as might be most strikingly illustrated in the\r\ncharacter of ---- ----, and some half-dozen or more of his pro-slavery\r\ncoadjutors. From whose hands did this man receive fifty thousand\r\ndollars--improperly, if not illegally, taken from the public funds in\r\nWashington? When did he receive it?--and for what purpose?--and who was\r\nthe arch-demagogue through whose agency the transfer was made? He was an\r\noligarchical member of the Cabinet under Mr. Polk's administration in\r\n1845,--and the money was _used_,--and who can doubt _intended_?--for the\r\nexpress purpose of establishing another negro-driving journal to support\r\nthe tottering fortunes of slavery. From the second volume of a valuable\r\npolitical work, \"by a Senator of thirty years,\" we make the following\r\npertinent extract:--\r\n\r\n\"The _Globe_ was sold, and was paid for, and how? becomes a question of\r\npublic concern to answer; for it was paid for out of public money--those\r\nsame $50,000 which were removed to the village bank in the interior of\r\nPennsylvania by a Treasury order on the fourth of November, 1844. Three\r\nannual installments made the payment, and the Treasury did not reclaim the\r\nmoney for these three years; and, though traveling through tortuous\r\nchannels, the sharpsighted Mr. Rives traced the money back to its starting\r\npoint from that deposit. Besides, Mr. Cameron, who had control of the\r\nvillage bank, admitted before a committee of Congress, that he had\r\nfurnished money for the payments--an admission which the obliging\r\nCommittee, on request, left out of their report. Mr. Robert J. Walker was\r\nSecretary of the Treasury during these three years, and the conviction was\r\nabsolute, among the close observers of the course of things, that he was\r\nthe prime contriver and zealous manager of the arrangements which\r\ndisplaced Mr. Blair and installed Mr. Ritchie.\"\r\n\r\nThus, if we are to believe Mr. Benton, in his \"Thirty Year's View,\" and we\r\nare disposed to regard him as good authority, the Washington _Union_ was\r\nbrought into existence under the peculiar auspices of the ostensible\r\neditor of the Richmond _Enquirer_; and the two papers, fathered by the\r\nsame individual, have gone hand in hand for the last dozen or thirteen\r\nyears, the shameless advocates and defenders of human bondage. To suppose\r\nthat either has been sustained by fairer means than it was commenced with,\r\nwould be wasting imagination on a great improbability. Both have uniformly\r\nand pertinaciously opposed every laudable enterprise that the white\r\nnon-slaveholder has projected; indeed, so unmitigated has been their\r\nhostility to all manual pursuits in which their stupid and vulgar slaves\r\ncan not be employed to advantage--and if there is any occupation under the\r\nsun in which they can be employed to good advantage, we know not what it\r\nis--that it is an extremely difficult matter to find a respectable\r\nmerchant, mechanic, manufacturer, or business man of any calling whatever,\r\nwithin the bounds of their circulation.\r\n\r\nWe have been credibly informed by a gentleman from Powhattan county, in\r\nVirginia, that in the year 1836 or '37, or about that time, the Hon.\r\nAbbott Lawrence, of Boston, backed by his brother Amos and other\r\nmillionaires of New England, went down to Richmond with the sole view of\r\nreconnoitering the manufacturing facilities of that place--fully\r\ndetermined, if pleased with the water-power, to erect a large number of\r\ncotton-mills and machine-shops. He had been in the capital of Virginia\r\nonly a day or two before he discovered, much to his gratification, that\r\nnature had shaped everything to his liking; and as he was a business man\r\nwho transacted business in a business-like manner, he lost no time in\r\nmaking preliminary arrangements for the consummation of his noble purpose.\r\nHis mission was one of peace and promise; others were to share the\r\nbenefits of his laudable and concerted scheme; thousands of poor boys and\r\ngirls in Virginia, instead of growing up in extreme poverty and ignorance,\r\nor of having to emigrate to the free States of the West, were to have\r\navenues of profitable employment opened to them at home; thus they would\r\nbe enabled to earn an honest and reputable living, to establish and\r\nsustain free schools, free libraries, free lectures, and free presses, to\r\nbecome useful and exemplary members of society, and to die fit candidates\r\nfor heaven. The magnanimous New Englander was in ecstasies with the\r\nprospect that opened before him. Individually, so far as mere money was\r\nconcerned, he was perfectly independent; his industry and economy in early\r\nlife had secured to him the ownership and control of an ample fortune.\r\nWith the aid of eleven other men, each equal to himself, he could have\r\nbought the whole city of Richmond--negroes and all--though it is not to be\r\npresumed that he would have disgraced his name by becoming a trader in\r\nhuman flesh. But he was not selfish; unlike the arrogant and illiberal\r\nslaveholder, he did not regard himself as the centre around whom everybody\r\nelse should revolve. On the contrary, he was a genuine philanthropist.\r\nWhile, with a shrewdness that will command the admiration of every\r\npractical business man, he engaged in nothing that did not swell the\r\ndimensions of his own purse, he was yet always solicitous to invest his\r\ncapital in a manner calculated to promote the interest of those around\r\nhim. Nor was he satisfied with simply furnishing the means whereby his\r\nless fortunate neighbors were to become prosperous, intelligent and\r\ncontented. With his generous heart and sagacious mind, he delighted to aid\r\nthem in making a judicious application of his wealth to their own use.\r\nMoreover, as a member of society, he felt that the community had some\r\nreasonable claims upon him, and he made it obligatory on himself\r\nconstantly to devise plans and exert his personal efforts for the public\r\ngood. Such was the character of the distinguished manufacturer who honored\r\nRichmond with his presence nineteen or twenty years ago; such was the\r\ncharacter of the men whom he represented, and such were the grand designs\r\nwhich they sought to accomplish.\r\n\r\nTo the enterprising and moneyed descendant of the Pilgrim Fathers it was a\r\nmatter of no little astonishment, that the immense water-power of Richmond\r\nhad been so long neglected. He expressed his surprise to a number of\r\nVirginians, and was at a loss to know why they had not, long prior to the\r\nperiod of his visit amongst them, availed themselves of the powerful\r\nelement that is eternally gushing and foaming over the falls of James\r\nRiver. Innocent man! He was utterly unconscious of the fact that he was\r\n\"interfering with the beloved institutions of the South,\" and little was\r\nhe prepared to withstand the terrible denunciations that were immediately\r\nshowered on his head through the columns of the Richmond _Enquirer_. Few\r\nwords will suffice to tell the sequel. That negro-worshipping sheet, whose\r\nhireling policy, for the last four and twenty years, has been to support\r\nthe worthless black slave and his tyrannical master at the expense of the\r\nfree white laborer, wrote down the enterprise! and the noble son of New\r\nEngland, abused, insulted and disgusted, quietly returned to\r\nMassachusetts, and there employed his capital in building up the cities of\r\nLowell and Lawrence, either of which, in all those elements of material\r\nand social prosperity that make up the greatness of States, is already far\r\nin advance of the most important of all the seedy and squalid niggervilles\r\nin the Old Dominion. Such is an inkling of the infamous means that have\r\nbeen resorted to, from time to time, for the purpose of upholding and\r\nperpetuating in America the accursed institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nHaving in view all the foregoing facts, we were not in the least surprised\r\nwhen, while walking through Hollywood Cemetery, in the western suburbs of\r\nRichmond, not long since, our companion, a Virginian of the true school,\r\ndirected our attention to a monument of some pretentions, and exclaimed,\r\n\"There lie the remains of a man upon whose monument should be inscribed in\r\neverlasting prominence the finger of scorn pointing downward.\" The reader\r\nscarcely needs to be told that we were standing at the tomb of ---- ----,\r\nwho in the opinion of our friend, had, by concentrating within himself the\r\nviews and purposes of all the evil spirits in Virginia, greatly retarded\r\nthe abolition of slavery; so greatly, indeed, as, thereby, to throw the\r\nState at least fifty years behind her free competitors of the North, of\r\nthe East, and of the West. It is to be hoped that Virginia may never give\r\nbirth to another man whose evil influence will so justly entitle him to\r\nthe reprobation of posterity.\r\n\r\nHow any rational man in this or any other country, with the astounding\r\ncontrasts between Freedom and Slavery ever looming in his view, can offer\r\nan apology for the existing statism of the South, is to us a most\r\ninexplicable mystery. Indeed, we cannot conceive it possible that the\r\nconscience of any man, who is really sane, would permit him to become the\r\nvictim of such an egregious and diabolical absurdity. Therefore, at this\r\nperiod of our history, with the light of the past, the reality of the\r\npresent, and the prospect of the future, all so prominent and so palpable,\r\nwe infer that every person who sets up an unequivocal defence of the\r\ninstitution of slavery, must, of necessity, be either a fool, a knave, or\r\na madman.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the slavocrats look at but one side of the\r\nquestion. Of all the fanatics in the country, they have, of late, become\r\nthe most unreasonable and ridiculous. Let them deliberately view the\r\nsubject of slavery in all its aspects and bearings, and if they are\r\npossessed of honest hearts and convincible minds, they will readily\r\nperceive the grossness of their past errors, renounce their allegiance to\r\na cause so unjust and disgraceful, and at once enroll themselves among the\r\nhosts of Freedom and the friends of universal Liberty. There are\r\nthirty-one States in the Union; let them drop California, or any other new\r\nfree State, and then institute fifteen comparisons, first comparing\r\nNew-York with Virginia, Pennsylvania with Carolina, Massachusetts with\r\nGeorgia, and so on, until they have exhausted the catalogue. Then, for\r\nonce, let them be bold enough to listen to the admonitions of their own\r\nsouls, and if they do not soon start to their feet _demanding_ the\r\nabolition of slavery, it will only be because they have reasons for\r\nsuppressing their inmost sentiments. Whether we compare the old free\r\nStates with the old slave States, or the new free States with the new\r\nslave States, the difference, unmistakable and astounding, is\r\nsubstantially the same. All the free States are alike, and all the slave\r\nStates are alike. In the former, wealth, intelligence, power, progress,\r\nand prosperity, are the prominent characteristics; in the latter, poverty,\r\nignorance, imbecility, inertia, and extravagance, are the distinguishing\r\nfeatures. To be convinced, it is only necessary for us to open our eyes\r\nand look at facts--to examine the _statistics_ of the country, to free\r\nourselves from obstinacy and prejudice, and to unbar our minds to\r\nconvictions of truth. Let figures be the umpire. Close attention to the\r\npreceding and subsequent tables is all we ask; so soon as they shall be\r\nduly considered and understood, the primary object of this work will have\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nNot content with eating out the vitals of the South, slavery, true to the\r\ncharacter which it has acquired for insatiety and rapine, is beginning to\r\nmake rapid encroachments on new territory; and as a basis for a few\r\nremarks on the blasting influence which it is shedding over the broad and\r\nfertile domains of the West, which in accordance with the views and\r\nresolutions offered by the immortal Jefferson, should have been\r\nirrevocably dedicated to freedom, we beg leave to call the attention of\r\nthe reader to another presentation of the philosophy of free and slave\r\nlabor. Says the _North American and United States Gazette_:\r\n\r\n\"We have but to compare the States, possessing equal natural advantages,\r\nin which the two kinds of labor are employed, in order to decide with\r\nentire confidence as to which kind is the more profitable. At the origin\r\nof the government, Virginia, with a much larger extent of territory than\r\nNew-York, contained a population of seven hundred and fifty thousand, and\r\nsent ten representatives to Congress; while New-York contained a\r\npopulation of three hundred and forty thousand, and sent six\r\nrepresentatives to Congress. Behold how the figures are reversed. The\r\npopulation of New-York is three and a half millions, represented by\r\nthirty-three members in Congress; while the population of Virginia is but\r\nlittle more than one and a half millions, represented by thirteen members\r\nin Congress. It is the vital sap of free labor that makes the one tree so\r\nthrifty and vigorous, so capable of bearing with all ease the fruit of\r\nsuch a population. And it is slave labor which strikes a decadence through\r\nthe other, drying up many of its branches with a fearful sterility, and\r\nrendering the rest but scantily fruitful; really incapable of sustaining\r\nmore. Look at Ohio, teeming with inhabitants, its soil loaded with every\r\nkind of agricultural wealth, its people engaged in every kind of freedom's\r\ndiversified employments, abounding with numberless happy homes, and with\r\nall the trophies of civilization, and it exhibits the magic effect of free\r\nlabor, waking a wilderness into life and beauty; while Kentucky, with\r\nequal or superior natural advantages, nature's very garden in this Western\r\nworld, which commenced its career at a much earlier date, and was in a\r\nmeasure populous when Ohio was but a slumbering forest, but which in all\r\nthe elements of progress, is now left far, very far, behind its young\r\nrival, shows how slave labor hinders the development of wealth among a\r\npeople, and brings a blight on their prosperity. The one is a grand and\r\nbeautiful poem in honor of free labor. The other is an humble confession\r\nto the world of the inferiority of slave labor.\"\r\n\r\nEqually significant is the testimony of Daniel R. Goodloe, of North\r\nCarolina, who says:--\r\n\r\n\"The history of the United States shows, that while the slave States\r\nincrease in population less rapidly than the free, there is a tendency in\r\nslave society to diffusion, greater than is exhibited by free society. In\r\nfact, diffusion, or extension of area, is one of the necessities of\r\nslavery; the prevention of which is regarded as directly and immediately\r\nmenacing to the existence of the institution. This arises from the almost\r\nexclusive application of slave labor to the one occupation of agriculture,\r\nand the difficulty, if not impossibility, of diversifying employments.\r\nFree society, on the contrary, has indefinite resources of development\r\nwithin a restricted area. It will far excel slave society in the\r\ncultivation of the ground--first, on account of the superior intelligence\r\nof the laborers; and secondly, in consequence of the greater and more\r\nvarious demands upon the earth's products, where commerce, manufactures,\r\nand the arts, abound. Then, these arts of life, by bringing men together\r\nin cities and towns, and employing them in the manufacture or\r\ntransportation of the raw materials of the farmer, give rise to an\r\nindefinite increase of wealth and population. The confinement of a free\r\npeople within narrow limits seems only to develop new resources of wealth,\r\ncomfort and happiness; while slave society, pent up, withers and dies. It\r\nmust continually be fed by new fields and forests, to be wasted and wilted\r\nunder the poisonous tread of the slave.\"\r\n\r\nWere we simply a freesoiler, or anything else less than a thorough and\r\nuncompromising abolitionist, we should certainly tax our ability to the\r\nutmost to get up a cogent argument against the extension of slavery over\r\nany part of our domain where it does not now exist; but as our principles\r\nare hostile to the institution even where it does exist, and, therefore,\r\nby implication and in fact, more hostile still to its introduction into\r\nnew territory, we forbear the preparation of any special remarks on this\r\nparticular subject.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the unnational and demoralizing institution of slavery, we\r\nbelieve the majority of Northern people are too scrupulous. They seem to\r\nthink that it is enough for them to be mere freesoilers, to keep in check\r\nthe diffusive element of slavery, and to prevent it from crossing over\r\nthe bounds within which it is now regulated by municipal law. Remiss in\r\ntheir _national_ duties, as we contend, they make no positive attack upon\r\nthe institution in the Southern States. Only a short while since, one of\r\ntheir ablest journals--the _North American and United States Gazette_,\r\npublished in Philadelphia--made use of the following language:--\r\n\r\n\"With slavery in the States, we make no pretence of having anything\r\npolitically to do. For better or for worse, the system belongs solely to\r\nthe people of those States; and is separated by an impassable gulf of\r\nState sovereignty from any legal intervention of ours. We cannot vote it\r\ndown any more than we can vote down the institution of caste in Hindostan,\r\nor abolish polygamy in the Sultan's dominions. Thus, precluded from all\r\npolitical action in reference to it, prevented from touching one stone of\r\nthe edifice, not the slightest responsibility attaches to us as citizens\r\nfor its continued existence. But on the question of extending slavery over\r\nthe free Territories of the United States, it is our right, it is our\r\nimperative duty to think, to feel, to speak and to vote. We cannot\r\ninterfere to cover the shadows of slavery with the sunshine of freedom,\r\nbut we can interfere to prevent the sunshine of freedom from being\r\neclipsed by the shadows of slavery. We can interpose to stay the progress\r\nof that institution, which aims to drive free labor from its own heritage.\r\nKansas should be divided up into countless homes for the ownership of men\r\nwho have a right to the fruit of their own labors. Free labor would make\r\nit bud and blossom like the rose; would cover it with beauty, and draw\r\nfrom it boundless wealth; would throng it with population; would make\r\nStates, nations, empires out of it, prosperous, powerful, intelligent and\r\nfree, illustrating on a wide theatre the beneficent ends of Providence in\r\nthe formation of our government, to advance and elevate the millions of\r\nour race, and, like the heart in the body, from its central position,\r\nsending out on every side, far and near, the vital influences of freedom\r\nand civilization. May that region, therefore, be secured to free labor.\"\r\n\r\nNow we fully and heartily indorse every line of the latter part of this\r\nextract; but, with all due deference to our sage cotemporary, we do most\r\nemphatically dissent from the sentiments embodied in the first part. Pray,\r\npermit us to ask--have the people of the North no interest in the United\r\nStates as a _nation_, and do they not see that slavery is a great injury\r\nand disgrace to the _whole country_? Did they not, in \"the days that tried\r\nmen's souls,\" strike as hard blows to secure the independence of Georgia\r\nas they did in defending the liberties of Massachusetts, and is it not\r\nnotoriously true that the Toryism of South Carolina prolonged the war two\r\nyears at least? Is it not, moreover, equally true that the oligarchs of\r\nSouth Carolina have been unmitigated pests and bores to the General\r\nGovernment ever since it was organized, and that the free and\r\nconscientious people of the North are virtually excluded from her soil, in\r\nconsequence of slavery? It is a well-known and incontestible fact, that\r\nthe Northern States furnished about two-thirds of all the American troops\r\nengaged in the Revolutionary War; and, though they were neither more nor\r\nless brave or patriotic than their fellow-soldiers of the South, yet,\r\ninasmuch as the independence of our country was mainly secured by virtue\r\nof their numerical strength, we think they ought to consider it not only\r\ntheir right but their _duty_ to make a firm and decisive effort to save\r\nthe States which they fought to free, from falling under the yoke of a\r\nworse tyranny than that which overshadowed them under the reign of King\r\nGeorge the Third. Freemen of the North! we earnestly entreat you to think\r\nof these things. Hitherto, as mere freesoilers, you have approached but\r\nhalf-way to the line of your duty; now, for your own sakes and for ours,\r\nand for the purpose of perpetuating this glorious Republic, which your\r\nfathers and our fathers founded in septennial streams of blood, we ask\r\nyou, in all seriousness, to organize yourselves as _one man_ under the\r\nbanners of Liberty, and to aid us in _exterminating_ slavery, which is the\r\nonly thing that militates against our complete aggrandizement as a nation.\r\n\r\nIn this extraordinary crisis of affairs, no man can be a true patriot\r\nwithout first becoming an abolitionist. (A freesoiler is only a tadpole in\r\nan advanced state of transformation; an abolitionist is the full and\r\nperfectly developed frog.) And here, perhaps, we may be pardoned for the\r\ndigression necessary to show the exact definition of the terms _abolish_,\r\n_abolition_ and _abolitionist_. We have looked in vain for an explanation\r\nof the signification of these words in any Southern publication; for no\r\ndictionary has ever yet been published in the South, nor is there the\r\nleast probability that one ever will be published within her borders,\r\nuntil slavery is _abolished_; but, thanks to Heaven, a portion of this\r\ncontinent is what our Revolutionary Fathers and the Fathers of the\r\nConstitution fought and labored and prayed to make it--a land of freedom,\r\nof power, of progress, of prosperity, of intelligence, of religion, of\r\nliterature, of commerce, of science, of arts, of agriculture, of\r\nmanufactures, of ingenuity, of enterprise, of wealth, of renown, of\r\ngoodness, and of grandeur. From that glorious part of our\r\nconfederacy--from the North, whence, on account of slavery in the South,\r\nwe are under the humiliating necessity of procuring almost everything that\r\nis useful or ornamental, from primers to Bibles, from wafers to\r\nprinting-presses, from ladles to locomotives, and from portfolios to\r\nportraits and pianos--comes to us a huge volume bearing the honored name\r\nof Webster--Noah Webster, who, after thirty-five years of unremitting\r\ntoil, completed a work which is, we believe, throughout Great Britain and\r\nthe United States, justly regarded as the standard vocabulary of the\r\nEnglish language--and in it the terms _abolish_, _abolition_, and\r\n_abolitionist_, are defined as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Abolish, _v. t._ To make void; to annul; to abrogate; applied\r\n     chiefly and appropriately to establish laws, contracts, rites,\r\n     customs and institutions; as to _abolish_ laws by a repeal, actual or\r\n     virtual. To destroy or put an end to; as to _abolish_ idols.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Abolition, _n._ The act of abolishing; or the state of being\r\n     abolished; an annulling; abrogation; utter destruction; as the\r\n     _abolition_ of laws, decrees, or ordinances, rites, customs, &c. The\r\n     putting an end to slavery; emancipation.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Abolitionist, _n._ A person who favors abolition, or the immediate\r\n     emancipation of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThere, gentlemen of the South, you have the definitions of the transitive\r\nverb _abolish_ and its two derivative nouns, _abolition_ and\r\n_abolitionist_; can you, with the keenest possible penetration of vision,\r\ndetect in either of these words even a tittle of the opprobrium which the\r\noligarchs, in their wily and inhuman efforts to enslave all working\r\nclasses irrespective of race or color, have endeavored to attach to them?\r\nWe know you cannot; abolition is but another name for patriotism, and its\r\nother special synonyms are generosity, magnanimity, reason, prudence,\r\nwisdom, religion, progress, justice, and humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd here, by the way, we may as well explain whom we refer to when we\r\nspeak of gentlemen of the South. We say, therefore, that, deeply impressed\r\nwith the conviction that slavery is a great social and political evil, a\r\n_sin and a crime_, in the fullest sense, whenever we speak of gentlemen of\r\nthe South, or of gentlemen anywhere, or at whatever time, or in whatever\r\nconnection we may speak of gentlemen, we seldom allude to slaveholders,\r\nfor the simple reason that, with few exceptions, we cannot conscientiously\r\nrecognize _them_ as gentlemen. It is only in those rare instances where\r\nthe crime is mitigated by circumstances over which the slaveholder has had\r\nno control, or where he himself, convinced of the impropriety, the folly\r\nand the wickedness of the institution, is anxious to abolish it, that we\r\ncan sincerely apply to him the sacred appellation in question--an\r\nappellation which we would no sooner think of applying to a _pro-slavery_\r\nslaveholder, or any other pro-slavery man, than we would think of applying\r\nit to a border-ruffian, a thief or a murderer. Let it be understood,\r\nhowever, that the rare instances of which we speak are less rare than many\r\npersons may suppose. We are personally acquainted with several\r\nslaveholders in North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Virginia, who\r\nhave unreservedly assured us that they were disgusted with the\r\ninstitution, and some of them went so far as to say they would be glad to\r\nacquiesce in the provision of a statute which would make it obligatory on\r\nthem all to manumit their slaves, without the smallest shadow or substance\r\nof compensation. These, we believe, are the sentiments of all the\r\nrespectable and patriotic slaveholders, who have eyes to see, and\r\nsee--ears to hear, and hear; who, perceiving the impoverishing and\r\ndegrading effects of slavery, are unwilling to entail it on their\r\nchildren, and who, on account of their undeviating adherence to truth and\r\njustice, are, like the more intelligent non-slaveholders, worthy of being\r\nregarded as gentlemen in every sense of the term. Such slaveholders were\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, and other illustrious Virginians, who, in\r\nthe language of the great chief himself, declared it among their \"_first\r\nwishes_ to see some plan adopted by which slavery, in this country, may be\r\nabolished by law.\" The words embraced within this quotation were used by\r\nWashington, in a letter to John F. Mercer, dated September 9th, 1786--a\r\nletter from which we shall quote more freely hereafter; and we think his\r\nemphatic use of the participle _abolished_, at that early day, is proof\r\npositive that the glorious \"Father of his Country\" is entitled to the\r\nfirst place in the calendar of primitive American abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIt is against slavery on the whole, and against slaveholders as a body,\r\nthat we wage an exterminating war. Those persons who, under the infamous\r\nslave-laws of the South--laws which have been correctly spoken of as a\r\n\"disgrace to civilization,\" and which must be annulled simultaneously with\r\nthe abolition of slavery--have had the vile institution entailed on them\r\ncontrary to their wills, are virtually on our side; we may, therefore,\r\nvery properly strike them off from the black list of three hundred and\r\nforty-seven thousand slaveholders, who, as a body, have shocked the\r\ncivilized world with their barbarous conduct, and from whose conceited and\r\npresumptuous ranks are selected the officers who do all the legislation,\r\ntown, county, state and national, for (against) five millions of poor\r\noutraged whites, and three millions of enslaved negroes.\r\n\r\nNon-slaveholders of the South! farmers, mechanics and workingmen, we take\r\nthis occasion to assure you that the slaveholders, the arrogant demagogues\r\nwhom you have elected to offices of honor and profit, have hoodwinked you,\r\ntrifled with you, and used you as mere tools for the consummation of their\r\nwicked designs. They have purposely kept you in ignorance, and have, by\r\nmoulding your passions and prejudices to suit themselves, induced you to\r\nact in direct opposition to your dearest rights and interests. By a system\r\nof the grossest subterfuge and misrepresentation, and in order to avert,\r\nfor a season, the vengeance that will most assuredly overtake them ere\r\nlong, they have taught you to hate the abolitionists, who are your best\r\nand only true friends. Now, as one of your own number, we appeal to you\r\nto join us in our patriotic endeavors to rescue the generous soil of the\r\nSouth from the usurped and desolating control of these political vampires.\r\nOnce and forever, at least so far as this country is concerned, the\r\ninfernal question of slavery must be disposed of; a speedy and perfect\r\nabolishment of the whole institution is the true policy of the South--and\r\nthis is the policy which we propose to pursue. Will you aid us, will you\r\nassist us, will you be freemen, or will you be slaves? These are questions\r\nof vital importance; weigh them well in your minds; come to a prudent and\r\nfirm decision, and hold yourselves in readiness to act in accordance\r\ntherewith. You must either be for us or against us--anti-slavery or\r\npro-slavery; it is impossible for you to occupy a neutral ground; it is as\r\ncertain as fate itself, that if you do not voluntarily oppose the\r\nusurpations and outrages of the slavocrats, they will force you into\r\ninvoluntary compliance with their infamous measures. Consider well the\r\naggressive, fraudulent and despotic power which they have exercised in the\r\naffairs of Kanzas; and remember that, if, by adhering to erroneous\r\nprinciples of neutrality or non-resistance, you allow them to force the\r\ncurse of slavery on that vast and fertile field, the broad area of all the\r\nsurrounding States and Territories--the whole nation, in fact--will soon\r\nfall a prey to their diabolical intrigues and machinations. Thus, if you\r\nare not vigilant, will they take advantage of your neutrality, and make\r\nyou and others the victims of their inhuman despotism. Do not reserve the\r\nstrength of your arms until you shall have been rendered powerless to\r\nstrike; the present is the proper time for action; under all the\r\ncircumstances, apathy or indifference is a crime. First ascertain, as\r\nnearly as you can, the precise nature and extent of your duty, and then,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, perform it in good faith. To facilitate you in\r\ndetermining what considerations of right, justice and humanity require at\r\nyour hands, is one of the primary objects of this work; and we shall\r\ncertainly fail in our desire if we do not accomplish our task in a manner\r\nacceptable to God and advantageous to man.\r\n\r\nBut we are carrying this chapter beyond all ordinary bounds; and yet,\r\nthere are many important particulars in which we have drawn no comparison\r\nbetween the free and the slave States. The more weighty remarks which we\r\nintended to offer in relation to the new States of the West and Southwest,\r\nfree and slave, shall appear in the succeeding chapter. With regard to\r\nagriculture, and all the multifarious interests of husbandry, we deem it\r\nquite unnecessary to say more. Cotton has been shorn of its magic power,\r\nand is no longer King; _dried grass_, commonly called hay, is, it seems,\r\nthe rightful heir to the throne. Commerce, Manufactures, Literature, and\r\nother important subjects, shall be considered as we progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHOW SLAVERY CAN BE ABOLISHED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary to our elucidation of what we conceive to be the most\r\ndiscreet, fair and feasible plan for the abolition of slavery, we propose\r\nto offer a few additional reasons why it should be abolished. Among the\r\nthousand and one arguments that present themselves in support of our\r\nposition--which, before we part with the reader, we shall endeavor to\r\ndefine so clearly, that it shall be regarded as ultra only by those who\r\nimperfectly understand it--is the influence which slavery invariably\r\nexercises in depressing the value of real estate; and as this is a matter\r\nin which the non-slaveholders of the South, of the West, and of the\r\nSouthwest, are most deeply interested, we shall discuss it in a sort of\r\npreamble of some length.\r\n\r\nThe oligarchs say we cannot abolish slavery without infringing on the\r\nright of property. Again we tell them we do not recognize property in man;\r\nbut even if we did, and if we were to inventory the negroes at quadruple,\r\nthe value of their last assessment, still, impelled by a sense of duty to\r\nothers, and as a matter of simple justice to ourselves, we, the\r\nnon-slaveholders of the South, would be fully warranted in emancipating\r\nall the slaves at once, and that, too, without any compensation whatever\r\nto those who claim to be their absolute masters and owners. We will\r\nexplain. In 1850, the average value per acre, of land in the Northern\r\nStates was $28,07; in the Northwestern $11,39; in the Southern $5,34; and\r\nin the Southwestern $6,26. Now, in consequence of numerous natural\r\nadvantages, among which may be enumerated the greater mildness of climate,\r\nrichness of soil, deposits of precious metals, abundance and spaciousness\r\nof harbors, and super-excellence of water-power, we contend that, had it\r\nnot been for slavery, the average value of land in all the Southern and\r\nSouthwestern States, would have been _at least_ equal to the average value\r\nof the same in the Northern States. We conclude, therefore, and we think\r\nthe conclusion is founded on principles of equity, that you, the\r\nslaveholders, are indebted to us, the non-slaveholders, in the sum of\r\n$22,73, which is the difference between $28,07 and $5,34, on every acre of\r\nSouthern soil in our possession. This claim we bring against you, because\r\nslavery, which has inured exclusively to your own benefit, if, indeed, it\r\nhas been beneficial at all, has shed a blighting influence over our lands,\r\nthereby keeping them out of market, and damaging every acre to the amount\r\nspecified. Sirs! are you ready to settle the account? Let us see how much\r\nit is. There are in the fifteen slave States, 346,048 slaveholders, and\r\n544,926,120 acres of land. Now the object is to ascertain how many acres\r\nare owned by slaveholders, and how many by non-slaveholders. Suppose we\r\nestimate five hundred acres as the average landed property of each\r\nslaveholder; will that be fair? We think it will, taking into\r\nconsideration the fact that 174,503 of the whole number of slaveholders\r\nhold less than five slaves each--68,820 holding only one each. According\r\nto this hypothesis, the slaveholders own 173,024,000 acres, and the\r\nnon-slaveholders the balance, with the exception of about 40,000,000 of\r\nacres, which belong to the General Government. The case may be stated\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n                      Area of the Slave States 544,926,720 acres.\r\n  Estimates  {Acres owned by slaveholders      173,024,000\r\n             {Acres owned by the government    40,000,000--213,024,000\r\n             {Acres owned by non-slaveholders              331,902,720\r\n\r\nNow, chevaliers of the lash, and worshippers of slavery, the total value\r\nof three hundred and thirty-one million nine hundred and two thousand\r\nseven hundred and twenty acres, at twenty-two dollars and seventy-three\r\ncents per acre, is _seven billion five hundred and forty-four million one\r\nhundred and forty-eight thousand eight hundred and twenty-five dollars_;\r\nand this is our account against you on a single score. Considering how\r\nyour villainous institution has retarded the development of our commercial\r\nand manufacturing interests, how it has stifled the aspirations of\r\ninventive genius; and, above all, how it has barred from us the\r\nheaven-born sweets of literature and religion--concernments too sacred to\r\nbe estimated in a pecuniary point of view--might we not, with perfect\r\njustice and propriety, duplicate the amount, and still be accounted modest\r\nin our demands? Fully advised, however, of your indigent circumstances, we\r\nfeel it would be utterly useless to call on you for the whole amount that\r\nis due us; we shall, therefore, in your behalf, make another draft on the\r\nfund of non-slaveholding generosity, and let the account, meagre as it is,\r\nstand as above. Though we have given you all the offices, and you have\r\ngiven us none of the benefits of legislation; though we have fought the\r\nbattles of the South, while you were either lolling in your piazzas, or\r\nplaying the tory, and endeavoring to filch from us our birthright of\r\nfreedom; though you have absorbed the wealth of our communities in sending\r\nyour own children to Northern seminaries and colleges, or in employing\r\nYankee teachers to officiate exclusively in your own families, and have\r\nrefused to us the limited privilege of common schools; though you have\r\nscorned to patronize our mechanics and industrial enterprises, and have\r\npassed to the North for every article of apparel, utility, and adornment;\r\nand though you have maltreated, outraged and defrauded us in every\r\nrelation of life, civil, social, and political, yet we are willing to\r\nforgive and _forget_ you, if you will but do us justice on a single count.\r\nOf you, the introducers, aiders and abettors of slavery, we demand\r\nindemnification for the damage our lands have sustained on account\r\nthereof; the amount of that damage is $7,544,148,825; and now, Sirs, we\r\nare ready to receive the money, and if it is perfectly convenient to you,\r\nwe would be glad to have you pay it in specie! It will not avail you,\r\nSirs, to parley or prevaricate. We must have a settlement. Our claim is\r\njust and overdue. We have already indulged you too long. Your criminal\r\nextravagance has almost ruined us. We are determined that you shall no\r\nlonger play the profligate, and fair sumptuously every day at our expense.\r\nHow do you propose to settle? Do you offer us your negroes in part\r\npayment? We do not want your negroes. We would not have all of them, nor\r\nany number of them, even as a gift. We hold ourselves above the\r\ndisreputable and iniquitous practices of buying, selling, and owning\r\nslaves. What we demand is damages in money, or other absolute property, as\r\nan equivalent for the pecuniary losses we have suffered at your hands. You\r\nvalue your negroes at sixteen hundred millions of dollars, and propose to\r\nsell them to us for that sum; we should consider ourselves badly cheated,\r\nand disgraced for all time, here and hereafter, if we were to take them\r\noff your hands at sixteen farthings! We tell you emphatically, we are\r\nfirmly resolved never to degrade ourselves by becoming the mercenary\r\npurchasers or proprietors of human beings. Except for the purpose of\r\nliberating them, we would not give a handkerchief or a tooth-pick for all\r\nthe slaves in the world. But, in order to show how brazenly absurd are the\r\nhowls and groans which you invariably set up for compensation, whenever we\r\nspeak of the abolition of slavery, we will suppose your negroes are worth\r\nall you ask for them, and that we are bound to secure to you every cent of\r\nthe sum before they can become free--in which case, our accounts would\r\nstand thus:\r\n\r\n  Non-slaveholder's account against Slaveholders   7,544,148,825\r\n  Slaveholder's account against Non-slaveholders   1,600,000,000\r\n                                                   -------------\r\n  Balance due Non-slaveholders                     5,944,148,825\r\n\r\nNow, Sirs, we ask you in all seriousness, Is it not true that you have\r\nfilched from us nearly five times the amount of the assessed value of your\r\nslaves? Why, then, do you still clamor for more? Is it your purpose to\r\nmake the game perpetual? Think you that we will ever continue to bow at\r\nthe wave of your wand, that we will bring humanity into everlasting\r\ndisgrace by licking the hand that smites us, and that with us there is no\r\npoint beyond which forbearance ceases to be a virtue? Sirs, if these be\r\nyour thoughts, you are laboring under a most fatal delusion. You can goad\r\nus no further; you shall oppress us no longer; heretofore, earnestly but\r\nsubmissively, we have asked you to redress the more atrocious outrages\r\nwhich you have perpetrated against us; but what has been the invariable\r\nfate of our petitions? With scarcely a perusal, with a degree of contempt\r\nthat added insult to injury, you have laid them on the table, and from\r\nthence they have been swept into the furnace of oblivion. Henceforth,\r\nSirs, we are demandants, not suppliants. We demand our rights, nothing\r\nmore, nothing less. It is for you to decide whether we are to have justice\r\npeaceably or by violence, for whatever consequences may follow, we are\r\ndetermined to have it one way or the other. Do you aspire to become the\r\nvictims of white non-slaveholding vengeance by day, and of barbarous\r\nmassacre by the negroes at night? Would you be instrumental in bringing\r\nupon yourselves, your wives, and your children, a fate too horrible to\r\ncontemplate? shall history cease to cite, as an instance of unexampled\r\ncruelty, the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, because the world--the\r\nSouth--shall have furnished a more direful scene of atrocity and carnage?\r\nSirs, we would not wantonly pluck a single hair from your heads; but we\r\nhave endured long, we have endured much; slaves only of the most\r\ndespicable class would endure more. An enumeration or classification of\r\nall the abuses, insults, wrongs, injuries, usurpations, and oppressions,\r\nto which you have subjected us, would fill a larger volume than this; it\r\nis our purpose, therefore, to speak only of those that affect us most\r\ndeeply. Out of our effects your have long since overpaid yourselves for\r\nyour negroes; and now, Sirs, you _must_ emancipate them--speedily\r\nemancipate them, or we will emancipate them for you! Every non-slaveholder\r\nin the South is, or ought to be, and will be, against you. You yourselves\r\nought to join us at once in our laudable crusade against \"the mother of\r\nharlots.\" Slavery has polluted and impoverished your lands; freedom will\r\nrestore them to their virgin purity, and add from twenty to thirty dollars\r\nto the value of every acre. Correctly speaking, emancipation will cost you\r\nnothing; the moment you abolish slavery, that very moment will the\r\nputative value of the slave become actual value in the soil. Though there\r\nare ten millions of people in the South, and though you, the slaveholders,\r\nare only three hundred and forty-seven thousand in number, you have within\r\na fraction of one-third of all the territory belonging to the fifteen\r\nslave States. You have a landed estate of 173,024,000 acres, the present\r\naverage market value of which is only $5,34 per acre; emancipate your\r\nslaves on Wednesday morning, and on the Thursday following the value of\r\nyour lands, and ours too, will have increased to an average of at least\r\n$28,07 per acre. Let us see, therefore, even in this one particular,\r\nwhether the abolition of slavery will not be a real pecuniary advantage to\r\nyou. The present total market value of all your landed property, at $5,34\r\nper acre, is only $923,248,160! With the beauty and sunlight of freedom\r\nbeaming on the same estate, it would be worth, at $28,07 per acre,\r\n$4,856,873,680. The former sum, deducted from the latter, leaves a balance\r\nof $3,933,535,520, and to the full extent of this amount will your lands\r\nbe increased in value whenever you abolish slavery; that is, provided you\r\nabolish it before it completely \"dries up all the organs of increase.\"\r\nHere is a more manifest and distinct statement of the case:--\r\n\r\n  Estimated value of slaveholders' lands after slavery} $4,856,783,680\r\n  shall have been abolished                           }\r\n\r\n  Present value of slaveholders' lands                     923,248,160\r\n                                                        --------------\r\n  Probable aggregate enhancement of value               $3,933,535,520\r\n\r\nNow, Sirs, this last sum is considerably more than twice as great as the\r\nestimated value of your negroes; and those of you, if any there be, who\r\nare yet heirs to sane minds and honest hearts, must, it seems to us, admit\r\nthat the bright prospect which freedom presents for a wonderful increase\r\nin the value of real estate, ours as well as yours, to say nothing of the\r\nthousand other kindred considerations, ought to be quite sufficient to\r\ninduce all the Southern States, in their sovereign capacities, to abolish\r\nslavery at the earliest practical period. You yourselves, instead of\r\nlosing anything by the emancipation of your negroes--even though we\r\nsuppose them to be worth every dime of $1,600,000,000--would, in this one\r\nparticular, the increased value of land, realize a _net profit_ of over\r\n_twenty three hundred millions of dollars_! Here are the exact figures:--\r\n\r\n  Net increment of value which it is estimated will}\r\n  accrue to slaveholders' lands in consequence     }  $3,933,535,520\r\n  of the abolition of slavery                      }\r\n\r\n  Putative value of the slaves                         1,600,000,000\r\n                                                       -------------\r\n  Slaveholders' estimated net landed profits of eman. $2,333,535,520\r\n\r\nWhat is the import of these figures? They are full of meaning. They\r\nproclaim themselves the financial intercessors for freedom, and, with that\r\nopen-hearted liberality which is so characteristic of the sacred cause in\r\nwhose behalf they plead, they propose to pay you upward of three thousand\r\nnine hundred millions of dollars for the very \"property\" which you, in all\r\nthe reckless extravagance of your inhuman avarice, could not find a heart\r\nto price at more than one thousand six hundred millions. In other words,\r\nyour own lands, groaning and languishing under the monstrous burden of\r\nslavery, announce their willingness to pay you all you ask for the\r\nnegroes, and offer you, besides, a bonus of more than twenty-three hundred\r\nmillions of dollars, if you will but convert those lands into free soil!\r\n_Our_ lands, also, cry aloud to be spared from the further pollutions and\r\ndesolations of slavery; and now, Sirs, we want to know explicitly whether,\r\nor not, it is your intention to heed these lamentations of the ground? We\r\nwant to know whether you are men or devils--whether you are entirely\r\nselfish and cruelly dishonest, or whether you have any respect for the\r\nrights of others. We, the non-slaveholders of the South, have many very\r\nimportant interests at stake--interests which, heretofore, you have\r\nsteadily despised and trampled under foot, but which, henceforth, we shall\r\nfoster and defend in utter defiance of all the unhallowed influences which\r\nit is possible for you, or any other class of slaveholders or\r\nslavebreeders to bring against us. Not the least among these interests is\r\nour landed property, which, to command a decent price, only needs to be\r\ndisencumbered of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn his present condition, we believe man exercises one of the noblest\r\nvirtues with which heaven has endowed him, when, without taking any undue\r\nadvantage of his fellow-men, and with a firm, unwavering purpose to\r\nconfine his expenditures to the legitimate pursuits and pleasures of life,\r\nhe covets money and strives to accumulate it. Entertaining this view, and\r\nhaving no disposition to make an improper use of money, we are free to\r\nconfess that we have a greater penchant for twenty-eight dollars than for\r\nfive; for ninety than for fifteen; for a thousand than for one hundred.\r\nSouth of Mason and Dixon's line we, the non-slaveholders, have 331,902,720\r\nacres of land, the present average market value of which, as previously\r\nstated, is only $5,34 per acre; by abolishing slavery we expect to enhance\r\nthe value to an average of at least $28,07 per acre, and thus realize an\r\naverage net increase of wealth of more than _seventy-five hundred millions\r\nof dollars_. The hope of realizing smaller sums has frequently induced men\r\nto perpetrate acts of injustice; we can see no reason why the certainty of\r\nbecoming immensely rich in real estate, or other property, should make us\r\nfalter in the performance of a _sacred duty_.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of our theme, a bit of personal history may not be out of\r\nplace in this connection. Only a few months have elapsed since we sold to\r\nan elder brother an interest we held in an old homestead which was willed\r\nto us many years ago by our dear departed father. The tract of land,\r\ncontaining two hundred acres, or thereabouts, is situated two and a half\r\nmiles west of Mocksville, the capital of Davie county, North Carolina, and\r\nis very nearly equally divided by Bear Creek, a small tributary of the\r\nSouth Yadkin. More than one-third of this tract--on which we have plowed,\r\nand hoed, and harrowed, many a long summer without ever suffering from the\r\neffects of _coup de soleil_--is under cultivation; the remaining portion\r\nis a well-timbered forest, in which, without being very particular, we\r\ncounted, while hunting through it not long since, sixty-three different\r\nkinds of indigenous trees--to say nothing of either coppice, shrubs or\r\nplants--among which the hickory, oak, ash, beech, birch, and black walnut,\r\nwere most abundant. No turpentine or rosin is produced in our part of the\r\nState; but there are, on the place of which we speak, several species of\r\nthe genus Pinus, by the light of whose flammable knots, as radiated on the\r\ncontents of some half-dozen old books, which, by hook or by crook, had\r\nfound their way into the neighborhood, we have been enabled to turn the\r\nlong winter evenings to our advantage, and have thus _partially_ escaped\r\nfrom the prison-grounds of those loathsome dungeons of illiteracy in which\r\nit has been the constant policy of the oligarchy to keep the masses, the\r\nnon-slaveholding whites and the negroes, forever confined. The fertility\r\nof the soil may be inferred from the quality and variety of its natural\r\nproductions; the meadow and the bottom, comprising, perhaps, an area of\r\nforty acres, are hardly surpassed by the best lands in the valley of the\r\nYadkin. A thorough examination of the orchard will disclose the fact that\r\nconsiderable attention has been paid to the selection of fruits; the\r\nbuildings are tolerable; the water is good. Altogether, to be frank, and\r\nnothing more, it is, for its size, one of the most desirable farms in the\r\ncounty, and will, at any time, command the maximum price of land in\r\nWestern Carolina. Our brother, anxious to become the sole proprietor,\r\nreadily agreed to give us the highest market price, which we shall publish\r\nby-and-bye. While reading the Baltimore _Sun_, the morning after we had\r\nmade the sale, our attention was allured to a paragraph headed \"Sales of\r\nReal Estate,\" from which, among other significant items, we learned that a\r\ntract of land containing exactly two hundred acres, and occupying a\r\nportion of one of the rural districts in the southeastern part of\r\nPennsylvania, near the Maryland line, had been sold the week before, at\r\n_one hundred and five dollars and fifty cents_ per acre. Judging from the\r\nsuccinct account given in the _Sun_, we are of the opinion that, with\r\nregard to fertility of soil, the Pennsylvania tract always has been, is\r\nnow, and perhaps always will be, rather inferior to the one under special\r\nconsideration. One is of the same size as the other; both are used for\r\nagricultural purposes; in all probability the only _essential_ difference\r\nbetween them is this: one is blessed with the pure air of freedom, the\r\nother is cursed with the malaria of slavery. For our interest in the old\r\nhomestead we received a nominal sum, amounting to an average of precisely\r\n_five dollars and sixty cents_ per acre. No one but our brother, who was\r\nkeen for the purchase, would have given us quite so much.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, pray let us ask, what does this narrative teach? We shall use\r\nfew words in explanation: there is an extensive void, but it can be better\r\nfilled with reflection. The aggregate value of the one tract is $21,100;\r\nthat of the other is only $1,120; the difference is $19,980. We contend,\r\ntherefore, in view of all the circumstances detailed, that the advocates\r\nand retainers of slavery, have, to all intents and purposes, defrauded our\r\nfamily out of this last-mentioned sum. In like manner, and on the same\r\nbasis of deduction, we contend that almost every non-slaveholder, who\r\neither is or has been the owner of real estate in the South, would, in a\r\ncourt of strict justice, be entitled to damages--the amount in all cases\r\nto be determined with reference to the quality of the land in question. We\r\nsay this because, in violation of every principle of expediency, justice,\r\nand humanity, and in direct opposition to our solemn protests, slavery was\r\nfoisted upon us, and has been thus far perpetuated, by and through the\r\ndiabolical intrigues of the oligarchs, and by them alone; and furthermore,\r\nbecause the very best agricultural lands in the Northern States being\r\nworth from one hundred to one hundred and seventy-five dollars per acre,\r\nthere is no possible reason, except slavery, why the more fertile and\r\ncongenial soil of the South should not be worth at least as much. If, on\r\nthis principle, we could ascertain, in the matter of real estate, the\r\ntotal indebtedness of the slaveholders to the non-slaveholders, we should\r\ndoubtless find the sum quite equivalent to the amount estimated on a\r\npreceding page--$7,544,148,825.\r\n\r\nWe have recently conversed with two gentlemen who, to save themselves from\r\nthe poverty and disgrace of slavery, left North Carolina six or seven\r\nyears ago, and who are now residing in the territory of Minnesota, where\r\nthey have accumulated handsome fortunes. One of them had traveled\r\nextensively in Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, and other adjoining\r\nStates; and, according to his account, and we know him to be a man of\r\nveracity, it is almost impossible for persons at a distance, to form a\r\nproper conception of the magnitude of the difference between the current\r\nvalue of lands in the Free and the Slave States of the West. On one\r\noccasion, embarking at Wheeling, he sailed down the Ohio; Virgina and\r\nKentucky on the one side, Ohio and Indiana on the other. He stopped at\r\nseveral places along the river, first on the right bank, then on the left,\r\nand so on, until he arrived at Evansville; continuing his trip, he sailed\r\ndown to Cairo, thence up the Mississippi to the mouth of the Des Moines;\r\nhaving tarried at different points along the route, sometimes in Missouri,\r\nsometimes in Illinois. Wherever he landed on free soil, he found it from\r\none to two hundred per cent. more valuable than the slave soil on the\r\nopposite bank. If, for instance, the maximum price of land was eight\r\ndollars in Kentucky, the minimum price was sixteen in Ohio; if it was\r\nseven dollars in Missouri, it was fourteen in Illinois. Furthermore, he\r\nassured us, that, so far as he could learn, two years ago, when he\r\ntraveled through the States of which we speak, the range of prices of\r\nagricultural lands, in Kentucky, was from three to eight dollars per acre;\r\nin Ohio, from sixteen to forty; in Missouri, from two to seven; in\r\nIllinois, from fourteen to thirty; in Arkansas, from one to four; in Iowa,\r\nfrom six to fifteen.\r\n\r\nIn all the old slave States, as is well known, there are vast bodies of\r\nland that can be bought for the merest trifle. We know an enterprising\r\ncapitalist in Philadelphia, who owns in his individual name, in the State\r\nof Virginia, _one hundred and thirty thousand acres_, for which he paid\r\nonly _thirty-seven and a half cents_ per acre! Some years ago, in certain\r\nparts of North Carolina, several large tracts were purchased at the rate\r\nof _twenty-five cents_ per acre!\r\n\r\nHiram Berdan, the distinguished inventor, who has frequently seen freedom\r\nand slavery side by side, and who is, therefore, well qualified to form an\r\nopinion of their relative influence upon society, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Many comparisons might be drawn between the free and the slave\r\n     States, either of which should be sufficient to satisfy any man that\r\n     slavery is not only ruinous to free labor and enterprise, but\r\n     injurious to morals, and blighting to the soil where it exists. The\r\n     comparison between the States of Michigan and Arkansas, which were\r\n     admitted into the Union at the same time, will fairly illustrate the\r\n     difference and value of free and slave labor, as well as the\r\n     difference of moral and intellectual progress in a free and in a\r\n     slave State.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1836 these young Stars were admitted into the constellation of\r\n     the Union. Michigan, with one-half the extent of territory of\r\n     Arkansas, challenged her sister State for a twenty years' race, and\r\n     named as her rider, 'Neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude,\r\n     unless for the punishment of crime, shall ever be tolerated in this\r\n     State.' Arkansas accepted the challenge, and named as her rider, 'The\r\n     General Assembly shall have no power to pass laws for the\r\n     emancipation of slaves without the consent of the owners.' Thus\r\n     mounted, these two States, the one free and the other slave, started\r\n     together twenty years ago, and now, having arrived at the end of the\r\n     proposed race, let us review and mark the progress of each. Michigan\r\n     comes out in 1856 with three times the population of slave Arkansas,\r\n     with five times the assessed value of farms, farming implements and\r\n     machinery and with eight times the number of public schools.\"\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing part of our work, we have drawn comparisons between the\r\nold free States and the old slave States, and between the new free States\r\nand the new slave States; had we sufficient time and space, we might with\r\nthe most significant results, change this method of comparison, by\r\ncontrasting the new free States with the old slave States. Can the\r\nslavocrats compare Ohio with Virginia, Illinois with Georgia, or Indiana\r\nwith South Carolina, without experiencing the agony of inexpressible\r\nshame? If they can, then indeed has slavery debased them to a lower deep\r\nthan we care to contemplate. Herewith we present a brief contrast, as\r\ndrawn by a Maryland abolitionist, between the most important old slave\r\nState and the most important new free State:\r\n\r\n     \"Virginia was a State, wealthy and prosperous, when Ohio was a\r\n     wilderness belonging to her. She gave that territory away, and what\r\n     is the result? Ohio supports a population of two million souls, and\r\n     the mother contains but one and a half millions; yet Virginia is\r\n     one-third larger than the Buckeye State. Virginia contains 61,000\r\n     square miles, Ohio but 40,000. The latter sustains 50 persons to the\r\n     square mile, while Virginia gives employment to but 25 to the square\r\n     mile. Notwithstanding Virginia's superiority in years and in\r\n     soil--for she grows tobacco, as well as corn and\r\n     wheat--notwithstanding her immense coal-fields, and her splendid\r\n     Atlantic ports, Ohio, the infant State, had 21 representatives in\r\n     Congress in 1850, while Virginia had but 13--the latter having\r\n     _commenced_ in the Union with 10 Congressmen. Compare the progress of\r\n     these States, and then say, what is it but Free Labor that has\r\n     advanced Ohio? and to what, except slavery, can we attribute the\r\n     non-progression of the Old Dominion?\"\r\n\r\nAs a striking illustration of the selfish and debasing influences which\r\nslavery exercises over the hearts and minds of slaveholders themselves, we\r\nwill here state the fact that, when we, the non-slaveholders, remonstrate\r\nagainst the continuance of such a manifest wrong and inhumanity--a system\r\nof usurpation and outrage so obviously detrimental to _our_\r\ninterests--they fly into a terrible passion, exclaiming, among all sorts\r\nof horrible threats, which are not unfrequently executed, \"It's none of\r\nyour business!\"--meaning to say thereby that their slaves do not annoy us,\r\nthat slavery affects no one except the masters and their chattels\r\npersonal, and that _we_ should give ourselves no concern about it,\r\nwhatever! To every man of common sense and honesty of purpose the\r\npreposterousness of this assumption is so evident, that any studied\r\nattempt to refute it would be a positive insult. Would it be none of our\r\nbusiness, if they were to bring the small-pox into the neighborhood, and,\r\nwith premeditated design, let \"foul contagion spread?\" Or, if they were to\r\nthrow a pound of strychnine into a public spring, would that be none of\r\nour business? Were they to turn a pack of mad dogs loose on the community,\r\nwould we be performing the part of good citizens by closing ourselves\r\nwithin doors for the space of nine days, saying nothing to anybody?\r\nSmall-pox is a nuisance; strychnine is a nuisance; mad dogs are a\r\nnuisance; slavery is a nuisance; slaveholders are a nuisance, and so are\r\nslave-breeders; it is our business, nay, it is our imperative duty, to\r\nabate nuisances; we propose, therefore, with the exception of strychnine,\r\nwhich is the least of all these nuisances, to exterminate this catalogue\r\nfrom beginning to end.\r\n\r\nWe mean precisely what our words express, when we say we believe thieves\r\nare, as a general rule, less amenable to the moral law than slaveholders;\r\nand here is the basis of our opinion: Ordinarily, thieves wait until we\r\nacquire a considerable amount of property, and then they steal a\r\ndispensable part of it; but they deprive no one of physical liberty, nor\r\ndo they fetter the mind; slaveholders, on the contrary, by clinging to the\r\nmost barbarous relic of the most barbarous age, bring disgrace on\r\nthemselves, their neighbors, and their country, depreciate the value of\r\ntheir own and others' lands, degrade labor, discourage energy and\r\nprogress, prevent non-slaveholders from accumulating wealth, curtail their\r\nnatural rights and privileges, doom their children to ignorance, and all\r\nits attendant evils, rob the negroes of their freedom, throw a damper on\r\nevery species of manual and intellectual enterprise, that is not projected\r\nunder their own roofs and for their own advantage, and, by other means\r\nequally at variance with the principles of justice, though but an\r\ninsignificant fractional part of the population, they constitute\r\nthemselves the sole arbiters and legislators for the entire South. Not\r\nmerely so; the thief rarely steals from more than one man out of an\r\nhundred; the slaveholder defrauds ninety and nine, and the hundredth does\r\nnot escape him. Again, thieves steal trifles from rich men; slaveholders\r\noppress poor men, and enact laws for the perpetuation of their poverty.\r\nThieves practice deceit on the wise; slaveholders take advantage of the\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nWe contend, moreover, that slaveholders are more criminal than common\r\nmurderers. We know all slaveholders would not wilfully imbue their hands\r\nin the blood of their fellow-men; but it is a fact, nevertheless, that all\r\nslaveholders are under the shield of a perpetual license to murder. This\r\nlicense they have issued to themselves. According to their own infamous\r\nstatutes, if the slave raises his hand to ward off an unmerited blow, they\r\nare permitted to take his life with impunity. We are personally acquainted\r\nwith three ruffians who have become actual murderers under circumstances\r\nof this nature. One of them killed two negroes on one occasion; the other\r\ntwo have murdered but one each. Neither of them has ever been subjected to\r\neven the preliminaries of a trial; not one of them has ever been arrested;\r\ntheir own private explanations of the homicides exculpated them from all\r\nmanner of blame in the premises. They had done nothing wrong in the eyes\r\nof the community. The negroes made an effort to shield themselves from the\r\ntortures of a merciless flagellation, and were shot dead on the spot.\r\nTheir murderers still live, and are treated as honorable members of\r\nsociety! No matter how many slaves or free negroes may witness the\r\nperpetration of these atrocious homicides, not one of them is ever allowed\r\nto lift up his voice in behalf of his murdered brother. In the South,\r\nnegroes, whether bond or free, are never, under any circumstances,\r\npermitted to utter a syllable under oath, except for or against persons of\r\ntheir own color; their testimony against white persons is of no more\r\nconsequence than the idle zephyr of the summer.\r\n\r\nWe shall now introduce four tables of valuable and interesting statistics,\r\nto which philosophic and discriminating readers will doubtless have\r\nfrequent occasions to refer. Tables 22 and 23 will show the area of the\r\nseveral States, in square miles and in acres, and the number of\r\ninhabitants to the square mile in each State; also the grand total, or the\r\naverage, of every statistical column; tables 24 and 25 will exhibit the\r\ntotal number of inhabitants residing in each State, according to the\r\ncensus of 1850, the number of whites, the number of free colored, and the\r\nnumber of slaves. The recapitulations of these tables will be followed by\r\na complete list of the number of slaveholders in the United States,\r\nshowing the exact number in each Southern State, and in the District of\r\nColumbia. Most warmly do we commend all these statistics to the _studious_\r\nattention of the reader. Their language is more eloquent than any possible\r\ncombination of Roman vowels and consonants. We have spared no pains in\r\narranging them so as to express at a single glance the great truths of\r\nwhich they are composed; and we doubt not that the plan we have adopted\r\nwill meet with general approbation. Numerically considered, it will be\r\nperceived that the slaveholders are, in reality, a very insignificant\r\nclass. Of them, however, we shall have more to say here after.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

But this\r\nappearance is deceptive. The actual number is certainly less than two\r\nhundred thousand. Professor De Bow, the Superintendent of the Census,\r\ninforms us that \"the number includes slave-hirers,\" and furthermore, that\r\n\"where the party owns slaves in different counties, or in different\r\nStates, he will be entered more than once.\" Now every Southerner, who has\r\nany practical knowledge of affairs, must know, and does know, that every\r\nNew Year's day, like almost every other day, is desecrated in the South,\r\nby publicly hiring out slaves to large numbers of non-slaveholders. The\r\nslave-owners, who are the exclusive manufacturers of public sentiment,\r\nhave popularized the dictum that white servants, decency, virtue, and\r\njustice, are unfashionable; and there are, we are sorry to say, nearly one\r\nhundred and sixty thousand non-slaveholding sycophants, who have\r\nsubscribed to this false philosophy, and who are giving constant\r\nencouragement to the infamous practices of slaveholding and\r\nslave-breeding, by hiring at least one slave every year.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States, as in all other slave countries, there are three\r\nodious classes of mankind; the slaves themselves, who are cowards; the\r\nslaveholders, who are tyrants; and the non-slaveholding slave-hirers, who\r\nare lickspittles. Whether either class is really entitled to the regards\r\nof a gentleman is a matter of grave doubt. The slaves are pitiable; the\r\nslaveholders are detestable; the slave-hirers are contemptible.\r\n\r\nWith the statistics at our command, it is impossible for us to ascertain\r\nthe exact numbers of slaveholders and non-slaveholding slave-hirers in the\r\nslave States; but we have data which will enable us to approach very near\r\nto the facts. The town from which we hail, Salisbury, the capital of Rowan\r\ncounty, North Carolina, contains about twenty-three hundred inhabitants,\r\nincluding three hundred and seventy-two slaves, fifty-one slaveholders,\r\nand forty-three non-slaveholding slave-hirers. Taking it for granted that\r\nthis town furnishes a fair relative proportion of all the slaveholders,\r\nand non-slaveholding slave-hirers in the slave States, the whole number of\r\nthe former, including those who have been \"entered more than once,\" is one\r\nhundred and eighty-eight thousand five hundred and fifty-one; of the\r\nlatter, one hundred and fifty-eight thousand nine hundred and\r\nseventy-four; and, now, estimating that there are in Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand other grain-growing States, an aggregate of two thousand slave-owners,\r\nwho have cotton plantations _stocked_ with negroes in the far South, and\r\nwho have been \"entered more than once,\" we find, as the result of our\r\ncalculations, that the total number of actual slaveholders in the Union,\r\nis precisely one hundred and eighty-six thousand five hundred and\r\nfifty-one--as follows:\r\n\r\n  Number of actual slaveholders in the United States       186,551\r\n  Number \"entered more than once\"                            2,000\r\n  Number of non-slaveholding slave-hirers                  158,974\r\n                                                          --------\r\n  Aggregate number, according to De Bow                    347,525\r\n\r\nThe greater number of non-slaveholding slave-hirers, are a kind of\r\nthird-rate aristocrats--persons who formerly owned slaves, but whom\r\nslavery, as is its custom, has dragged down to poverty, leaving them, in\r\ntheir false and shiftless pride, to eke out a miserable existence over the\r\nhapless chattels personal of other men.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that the total number of actual slave-owners, including their\r\nentire crew of cringing lickspittles, against whom we have to contend, is\r\nbut three hundred and forty-seven thousand five hundred and twenty-five.\r\nAgainst this army for the defense and propagation of slavery, we think it\r\nwill be an easy matter--independent of the negroes, who, in nine cases out\r\nof ten, would be delighted with an opportunity to cut their masters'\r\nthroats, and without accepting of a single recruit from either of the free\r\nStates, England, France or Germany--to muster one at least three times as\r\nlarge, and far more respectable for its utter extinction. We hope,\r\nhowever, and believe, that the matter in dispute may be adjusted without\r\narraying these armies against each other in hostile attitude. We desire\r\npeace, not war--justice, not blood. Give us fair-play, secure to us the\r\nright of discussion, the freedom of speech, and we will settle the\r\ndifficulty at the ballot-box, not on the battle-ground--by force of\r\nreason, not by force of arms. But we are wedded to one purpose from which\r\nno earthly power can ever divorce us. We are determined to abolish slavery\r\nat all hazards--in defiance of all the opposition, of whatever nature,\r\nwhich it is possible for the slavocrats to bring against us. Of this they\r\nmay take due notice, and govern themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed further, it may be necessary to call attention to the\r\nfact that, though the ostensible proprietorship of the slaves is vested in\r\nfewer individuals than we have usually counted in our calculations\r\nconcerning them, the force and drift of our statistics remain unimpaired.\r\nIn the main, all our figures are correct. The tables which we have\r\nprepared, especially, and the recapitulations of those tables, may be\r\nrelied on with all the confidence that is due to American official\r\nintegrity; for, as we have substantially remarked on a previous occasion,\r\nthe particulars of which they are composed have been obtained from the\r\nreturns of competent census agents, who, with Prof. De Bow as principal,\r\nwere expressly employed to collect them. As for our minor labors in the\r\nscience of numbers, we cheerfully submit them to the candid scrutiny of\r\nthe impartial critic.\r\n\r\nA majority of the slaveholders with whom we are acquainted--and we happen\r\nto know a few dozen more than we care to know--own, or pretend to own, at\r\nleast fifteen negroes each; some of them are the masters of more than\r\nfifty each; and we have had the _honor (!)_ of an introduction to one man\r\nwho is represented as the owner of sixteen hundred! It is said that if all\r\nthe lands of this latter worthy were in one tract, they might be formed\r\ninto two counties of more than ordinary size; he owns plantations and\r\nwoodlands in three cotton-growing States.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land owned by the slaveholder is generally in proportion\r\nto the number of negroes at his \"quarter;\" the master of only one or two\r\nslaves, if engaged in agriculture, seldom owns less than three hundred\r\nacres; the holder of eight or ten slaves usually owns from a thousand to\r\nfifteen hundred acres; five thousand acres are not unfrequently found in\r\nthe possession of the master of fifty slaves; while in Columbia, South\r\nCarolina, about twelve months ago, a certain noted slaveholder was pointed\r\nout to us, and reported as the owner of nearly two hundred thousand acres\r\nin the State of Mississippi. How the great mass of illiterate poor whites,\r\na majority of whom are the indescribably wretched tenants of these\r\nslavocratic landsharks, are specially imposed upon and socially outlawed,\r\nwe shall, if we have time and space, take occasion to explain in a\r\nsubsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nThus far, in giving expression to our sincere and settled opinions, we\r\nhave endeavored to show, in the first place, that slavery is a great\r\nmoral, social, civil, and political evil--a dire enemy to true wealth and\r\nnational greatness, and an atrocious crime against both God and man; and,\r\nin the second place, that it is a paramount duty which we owe to heaven,\r\nto the earth, to America, to humanity, to our posterity, to our\r\nconsciences, and to our pockets, to adopt effectual and judicious measures\r\nfor its immediate abolition. The questions now arise, How can the evil be\r\naverted? What are the most prudent and practical means that can be devised\r\nfor the abolition of slavery? In the solution of these problems it becomes\r\nnecessary to deal with a multiplicity of stubborn realities. And yet, we\r\ncan see no reason why North Carolina, in her sovereign capacity, may not,\r\nwith equal ease and success, do what forty-five other States of the world\r\nhave done within the last forty-five years. Nor do we believe any good\r\nreason exists why Virginia should not perform as great a deed in 1859 as\r\ndid New-York in 1799. Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1780; would it\r\nnot be a masterly stroke of policy in Tennessee, and every other slave\r\nState, to abolish it in or before 1860?\r\n\r\nNot long since, a slavocrat, writing on this subject, said,\r\napologetically, \"we frankly admit that slavery is a monstrous evil; but\r\nwhat are we to do with an institution which has baffled the wisdom of our\r\ngreatest statesmen?\" Unfortunately for the South, since the days of\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, and their illustrious compatriots, she has\r\nnever had more than half a dozen statesmen, all told; of mere politicians,\r\nwire-pullers, and slave-driving demagogues, she has had enough, and to\r\nspare; but of statesmen, in the true sense of the term, she has had, and\r\nnow has, but precious few--fewer just at this time, perhaps, than ever\r\nbefore. It is far from a matter of surprise to us that slavery has, for\r\nsuch a long period, baffled the \"wisdom\" of the oligarchy; but our\r\nsurprise is destined to culminate in amazement, if the wisdom of the\r\nnon-slaveholders does not soon baffle slavery.\r\n\r\nFrom the eleventh year previous to the close of the eighteenth century\r\ndown to the present moment, slaveholders and slave-breeders, who, to speak\r\nnaked truth, are, as a general thing, unfit to occupy any honorable\r\nstation in life, have, by chicanery and usurpation, wielded all the\r\nofficial power of the South; and, excepting the patriotic services of the\r\nnoble abolitionists above-mentioned, the sole aim and drift of their\r\nlegislation has been to aggrandize themselves, to strengthen slavery, and\r\nto keep the poor whites, the constitutional majority, bowed down in the\r\ndeepest depths of degradation. We propose to subvert this entire system of\r\noligarchal despotism. We think there should be _some_ legislation for\r\ndecent white men, not alone for negroes and slaveholders. Slavery lies at\r\nthe root of all the shame, poverty, ignorance, tyranny and imbecility of\r\nthe South; slavery must be thoroughly eradicated; let this be done, and a\r\nglorious future will await us.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen who are to abolish slavery in Kentucky, must be mainly and\r\nindependently constituted by the non-slaveholders of Kentucky; so in every\r\nother slave State. Past experience has taught us the sheer folly of ever\r\nexpecting voluntary justice from the slaveholders. Their illicit\r\nintercourse with \"the mother of harlots\" has been kept up so long, and\r\ntheir whole natures have, in consequence, become so depraved, that there\r\nis scarcely a spark of honor or magnanimity to be found amongst them. As\r\nwell might one expect to hear highwaymen clamoring for a universal\r\ninterdict against traveling, as to expect slaveholders to pass laws for\r\nthe abolition of slavery. Under all the circumstances, it is the duty of\r\nthe non-slaveholders to mark out an independent course for themselves, to\r\nsteer entirely clear of the oligarchy, and to utterly contemn and ignore\r\nthe many vile instruments of power, animate and inanimate, which have been\r\nso freely and so effectually used for their enslavement. Now is the time\r\nfor them to assert their rights and liberties; never before was there such\r\nan appropriate period to strike for Freedom in the South.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the better sense, the purer patriotism, and the more\r\npractical justice of the non-slaveholders, the Middle States and New\r\nEngland would still be groaning and groveling under the ponderous burden\r\nof slavery; New-York would never have risen above the dishonorable level\r\nof Virginia; Pennsylvania, trampled beneath the iron-heel of the black\r\ncode, would have remained the unprogressive parallel of Georgia;\r\nMassachusetts would have continued till the present time, and Heaven only\r\nknows how much longer, the contemptible coequal of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nSucceeded by the happiest moral effects and the grandest physical results,\r\nwe have seen slavery crushed beneath the wisdom of the non-slaveholding\r\nstatesmen of the North; followed by corresponding influences and\r\nachievements, many of us who have not yet passed the meridian of life, are\r\ndestined to see it equally crushed beneath the wisdom of the\r\nnon-slaveholding Statesmen of the South. With righteous indignation, we\r\nenter our disclaimer against the base yet baseless admission that\r\nLouisiana and Texas are incapable of producing as great statesmen as Rhode\r\nIsland and Connecticut. What has been done for New Jersey by the statesmen\r\nof New Jersey, can be done for North Carolina by the statesmen of North\r\nCarolina; the wisdom of the former State has abolished slavery; as sure as\r\nthe earth revolves on its axis, the wisdom of the latter will not do less.\r\n\r\nThat our plan for the abolition of slavery, is the best that can be\r\ndevised, we have not the vanity to contend; but that it is a good one, and\r\nwill do to act upon until a better shall have been suggested, we do firmly\r\nand conscientiously believe. Though but little skilled in the delicate\r\nart of surgery, we have pretty thoroughly probed slavery, the frightful\r\ntumor on the body politic, and have, we think, ascertained the precise\r\nremedies requisite for a speedy and perfect cure. Possibly the less ardent\r\nfriends of freedom may object to our prescription, on the ground that some\r\nof its ingredients are too griping, and that it will cost the patient a\r\ndeal of most excruciating pain. But let them remember that the patient is\r\nexceedingly refractory, that the case is a desperate one, and that drastic\r\nremedies are indispensably necessary. When they shall have invented milder\r\nyet equally efficacious ones, it will be time enough to discontinue the\r\nuse of ours--then no one will be readier than we to discard the infallible\r\nstrong recipe for the infallible mild. Not at the persecution of a few\r\nthousand slaveholders, but at the restitution of natural rights and\r\nprerogatives to several millions of non-slaveholders, do we aim.\r\n\r\nInscribed on the banner, which we herewith unfurl to the world, with the\r\nfull and fixed determination to stand by it or die by it, unless one of\r\nmore virtuous efficacy shall be presented, are the mottoes which, in\r\nsubstance, embody the principles, as we conceive, that should govern us in\r\nour patriotic warfare against the most subtle and insidious foe that ever\r\nmenaced the inalienable rights and liberties and dearest interests of\r\nAmerica:\r\n\r\n     1st. Thorough Organization and Independent Political Action on the\r\n     part of the Non-Slaveholding whites of the South.\r\n\r\n     2nd. Ineligibility of Slaveholders--Never another vote to the\r\n     Trafficker in Human Flesh.\r\n\r\n     3rd.

No Recognition of Pro-slavery Men, except as Ruffians, Outlaws,\r\n     and Criminals.\r\n\r\n     6th. Abrupt Discontinuance of Subscription to Pro-slavery Newspapers.\r\n\r\n     7th. The Greatest Possible Encouragement to Free White Labor.\r\n\r\n     8. No more Hiring of Slaves by Non-slaveholders.\r\n\r\n     9th. Immediate Death to Slavery, or if not immediate, unqualified\r\n     Proscription of its Advocates during the Period of its Existence.\r\n\r\n     10th. A Tax of Sixty Dollars on every Slaveholder for each and every\r\n     Negro in his Possession at the present time, or at any intermediate\r\n     time between now and the 4th of July, 1863--said Money to be Applied\r\n     to the transportation of the Blacks to Liberia, to their Colonization\r\n     in Central or South America, or to their Comfortable Settlement\r\n     within the Boundaries of the United States.\r\n\r\n     11th. An additional Tax of Forty Dollars per annum to be levied\r\n     annually, on every Slaveholder for each and every Negro found in his\r\n     possession after the 4th of July, 1863--said Money to be paid into\r\n     the hands of the Negroes so held in Slavery, or, in cases of death,\r\n     to their next of kin, and to be used by them at their own option.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the outline of our scheme for the abolition of slavery in\r\nthe Southern States. Let it be acted upon with due promptitude, and, as\r\ncertain as truth is mightier than error, fifteen years will not elapse\r\nbefore every foot of territory, from the mouth of the Delaware to the\r\nemboguing of the Rio Grande, will glitter with the jewels of freedom. Some\r\ntime during this year, next, or the year following, let there be a general\r\nconvention of non-slaveholders from every slave State in the Union, to\r\ndeliberate on the momentous issues now pending. First, let them adopt\r\nmeasures for holding in restraint the diabolical excesses of the\r\noligarchy; secondly, in order to cast off the thraldom which the infamous\r\nslave-power has fastened upon them, and, as the first step necessary to be\r\ntaken to regain the inalienable rights and liberties with which they were\r\ninvested by Nature, but of which they have been divested by the accursed\r\ndealers in human flesh, let them devise ways and means for the complete\r\nannihilation of slavery; thirdly, let them put forth an equitable and\r\ncomprehensive platform, fully defining their position, and inviting the\r\nactive sympathy and co-operation of the millions of down-trodden\r\nnon-slaveholders throughout the Southern and Southwestern States. Let all\r\nthese things be done, not too hastily, but with calmness, deliberation,\r\nprudence, and circumspection; if need be, let the delegates to the\r\nconvention continue in session one or two weeks; only let their labors be\r\nwisely and thoroughly performed; let them, on Wednesday morning, present\r\nto the poor whites of the South, a well-digested scheme for the\r\nreclamation of their ancient rights and prerogatives, and, on the\r\nThursday following, slavery in the United States will be worth absolutely\r\nless than nothing; for then, besides being so vile and precarious that\r\nnobody will want it, it will be a lasting reproach to those in whose hands\r\nit is lodged.\r\n\r\nWere it not that other phases of the subject admonish us to be economical\r\nof space, we could suggest more than a dozen different plans, either of\r\nwhich, if scrupulously carried out, would lead to a wholesome, speedy, and\r\nperfect termination of slavery. Under all the circumstances, however, it\r\nmight be difficult for us--perhaps it would not be the easiest thing in\r\nthe world for any body else--to suggest a better plan than the one above.\r\nLet it, or one embodying its principal features, be adopted forth with,\r\nand the last wail of slavery will soon be heard, growing fainter and\r\nfainter, till it dies utterly away, to be succeeded by the jubilant shouts\r\nof emancipated millions.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, let it be distinctly understood that ownership in slaves\r\nconstitutes ineligibility--that it is a crime, as we verily believe it is,\r\nto vote for a slavocrat for any office whatever. Indeed, it is our honest\r\nconviction that all the pro-slavery slaveholders, who are alone\r\nresponsible for the continuance of the baneful institution among us,\r\ndeserve to be at once reduced to a parallel with the basest criminals that\r\nlie fettered within the cells of our public prisons. Beyond the power of\r\ncomputation is the extent of the moral, social, civil, and political evils\r\nwhich they have brought, and are still bringing, on the country. Were it\r\npossible that the whole number could be gathered together and transformed\r\ninto four equal gangs of licensed robbers, ruffians, thieves, and\r\nmurderers, society, we feel assured, would suffer less from their\r\natrocities than it does now. Let the wholesome public sentiment of the\r\nnon-slaveholders be vigilant and persevering in bringing them down to\r\ntheir proper level. Long since, and in the most unjust and cruel manner,\r\nhave they socially outlawed the non-slaveholders; now security against\r\nfurther oppression, and indemnity for past grievances, make it incumbent\r\non the non-slaveholders to cast them into the identical pit that they dug\r\nfor their betters--thus teaching them how to catch a Tartar!\r\n\r\nAt the very moment we write, as has been the case ever since the United\r\nStates have had a distinct national existence, and as will always continue\r\nto be the case, unless right triumphs over wrong, all the civil,\r\npolitical, and other offices, within the gift of the South, are filled\r\nwith negro-nursed incumbents from the ranks of that execrable band of\r\nmisanthropes--three hundred and forty-seven thousand in number--who, for\r\nthe most part, obtain their living by breeding, buying and selling slaves.\r\nThe magistrates in the villages, the constables in the districts, the\r\ncommissioners of the towns, the mayors of the cities, the sheriffs of the\r\ncounties, the judges of the various courts, the members of the\r\nlegislatures, the governors of the States, the representatives and\r\nsenators in Congress--are all slaveholders. Nor does the catalogue of\r\ntheir usurpations end here. Through the most heart-sickening arrogance and\r\nbribery, they have obtained control of the General Government, and all the\r\nconsuls, ambassadors, envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary,\r\nwho are chosen from the South, and commissioned to foreign countries, are\r\nselected with special reference to the purity of their pro-slavery\r\nantecedents. If credentials have ever been issued to a single\r\nnon-slaveholder of the South, we are ignorant of both the fact and the\r\nhearsay; indeed, it would be very strange if this much abused class of\r\npersons were permitted to hold important offices abroad, when they are not\r\nallowed to hold unimportant ones at home.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, there is the Presidency of the United States, which office has\r\nbeen held _forty-eight_ years by slaveholders from the South, and only\r\n_twenty_ years by non-slaveholders from the North. Nor is this the full\r\nrecord of oligarchal obtrusion. On an average, the offices of Secretary of\r\nState, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, Secretary of War, Postmaster-General and Attorney-General, have\r\nbeen under the control of slave-drivers nearly two-thirds of the time. The\r\nChief Justices and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, the Presidents pro tem. of the Senate, and the Speakers of\r\nthe House of Representatives, have, in a large majority of instances, been\r\nslave-breeders from the Southern side of the Potomac. Five slaveholding\r\nPresidents have been reelected to the chief magistracy of the Republic,\r\nwhile no non-slaveholder has ever held the office more than a single term.\r\nThus we see plainly that even the non-slaveholders of the North, to whose\r\nfreedom, energy, enterprise, intelligence, wealth, population, power,\r\nprogress, and prosperity, our country is almost exclusively indebted for\r\nits high position among the nations of the earth, have been arrogantly\r\ndenied a due participation in the honors of federal office. When \"the sum\r\nof all villainies\" shall have ceased to exist, then the rights of the\r\nnon-slaveholders of the North, of the South, of the East, and of the West,\r\nwill be duly recognized and respected; not before.\r\n\r\nWith all our heart, we hope and believe it is the full and fixed\r\ndetermination of a majority of the more intelligent and patriotic citizens\r\nof this Republic, that the Presidential chair shall never again be filled\r\nby a slavocrat. Safely may we conclude that the doom of the oligarchy is\r\nalready sealed with respect to that important and dignified station; it\r\nnow behooves us to resolve, with equal firmness and effect, that, after a\r\ncertain period during the next decade of years, no slaveholder shall\r\noccupy any position in the Cabinet, that no slave-breeder shall be sent as\r\na diplomatist to any foreign country, that no slave-driver shall be\r\npermitted to bring further disgrace on either the Senate or the House of\r\nRepresentatives, that the chief justices, associate justices, and judges\r\nof the several courts, the governors of the States, the members of the\r\nlegislatures, and all the minor functionaries of the land, shall be free\r\nfrom the heinous crime of ownership in man.\r\n\r\nFor the last sixty-eight years, slaveholders have been the sole and\r\nconstant representatives of the South, and what have they accomplished? It\r\nrequires but little time and few words, to tell the story of their\r\nindiscreet and unhallowed performances. In fact, with what we have already\r\nsaid, gestures alone would suffice to answer the inquiry. We can make\r\nneither a more truthful nor emphatic reply than to point to our thinly\r\ninhabited States, to our fields despoiled of their virgin soil, to the\r\ndespicable price of lands, to our unvisited cities and towns, to our\r\nvacant harbors and idle water-power, to the dreary absence of shipping and\r\nmanufactories, to our unpensioned soldiers of the revolution, to the\r\nmillions of living monuments of ignorance, to the poverty of the whites,\r\nand to the wretchedness of the blacks.\r\n\r\nEither directly or indirectly, are slave-driving demagogues, who have\r\nostentatiously set up pretensions to statesmanship, responsible for every\r\ndishonorable weakness and inequality that exists between the North and the\r\nSouth. Let them shirk the responsibility if they can; but it is morally\r\nimpossible for them to do so. We know how ready they have always been to\r\ncite the numerical strength of the North, as a valid excuse for their\r\ninability to procure appropriations from the General Government, for\r\npurposes of internal improvement, for the establishment of lines of ocean\r\nsteamers to South American and European ports, and for the accomplishment\r\nof other objects. Before that apology ever escapes from their lips again,\r\nlet them remember that the numerical weakness of the South is wholly\r\nattributable to their own villainous statism. Had the Southern States, in\r\naccordance with the principles enunciated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, abolished slavery at the same time the Northern States\r\nabolished it, there would have been, long since, and most assuredly at\r\nthis moment, a larger, wealthier, wiser, and more powerful population,\r\nsouth of Mason and Dixon's line, than there now is north of it. This fact\r\nbeing so well established that no reasonable man denies it, it is evident\r\nthat the oligarchy will have to devise another subterfuge for even\r\ntemporary relief.\r\n\r\nUntil slavery and slaveholders cease to be the only favored objects of\r\nlegislation in the South, the North will continue to maintain the\r\nascendency in every important particular. With those loathsome objects out\r\nof the way, it would not take the non-slaveholders of the South more than\r\na quarter of a century to bring her up, in all respects, to a glorious\r\nequality with the North; nor would it take them much longer to surpass the\r\nlatter, which is the most vigorous and honorable rival that they have in\r\nthe world. Three quarters of a century hence, if slavery is abolished\r\nwithin the next ten years, as it ought to be, the South will, we believe,\r\nbe as much greater than the North, as the North is now greater than the\r\nSouth. Three quarters of a century hence, if the South retains slavery,\r\nwhich God forbid! she will be to the North much the same that Poland is to\r\nRussia, that Cuba is to Spain, or that Ireland is to England.\r\n\r\nWhat we want and must have, as the only sure means of attaining to a\r\nposition worthy of Sovereign States in this eminently progressive and\r\nutilitarian age, is an energetic, intelligent, enterprising, virtuous, and\r\nunshackled population; an untrammeled press, and the Freedom of Speech.\r\nFor ourselves, as white people, and for the negroes and other persons of\r\nwhatever color or condition, we demand all the rights, interests and\r\nprerogatives, that are guarantied to corresponding classes of mankind in\r\nthe North, in England, in France, in Germany, or in any other civilized\r\nand enlightened country. Any proposition that may be offered conceding\r\nless than this demand, will be promptly and disdainfully rejected.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the non-slaveholders of the South, George M. Weston, a zealous\r\nco-laborer in the cause of Freedom, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The non-slaveholding whites of the South, being not less than\r\n     seven-tenths of the whole number of whites, would seem to be entitled\r\n     to some enquiry into their actual condition; and especially, as they\r\n     have no real political weight or consideration in the country, and\r\n     little opportunity to speak for themselves. I have been for twenty\r\n     years a reader of Southern newspapers, and a reader and hearer of\r\n     Congressional debates; but, in all that time, I do not recollect ever\r\n     to have seen or heard these non-slaveholding whites referred to by\r\n     Southern 'gentlemen,' as constituting any part of what they call\r\n     '_the South_.' When the rights of the South, or its wrongs, or its\r\n     policy, or its interests, or its institutions, are spoken of,\r\n     reference is always intended to the rights, wrongs, policy,\r\n     interests, and institutions of the three hundred and forty-seven\r\n     thousand slaveholders. Nobody gets into Congress from the South but\r\n     by their direction; nobody speaks at Washington for any Southern\r\n     interest except theirs. Yet there is, at the South, quite another\r\n     interest than theirs; embracing from two to three times as many white\r\n     people; and, as we shall presently see, entitled to the deepest\r\n     sympathy and commiseration, in view of the material, intellectual,\r\n     and moral privations to which it has been subjected, the degradation\r\n     to which it has already been reduced, and the still more fearful\r\n     degradation with which it is threatened by the inevitable operation\r\n     of existing causes and influences.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract, from a paper on \"Domestic Manufactures in the South\r\nand West,\" published by M. Tarver, of Missouri, may be appropriately\r\nintroduced in this connection:--\r\n\r\n     \"The non-slaveholders possess, generally, but very small means, and\r\n     the land which they possess is almost universally poor, and so\r\n     sterile that a scanty subsistence is all that can be derived from\r\n     its cultivation; and the more fertile soil, being in the possession\r\n     of the slaveholders, must ever remain out of the power of those who\r\n     have none. This state of things is a great drawback, and bears\r\n     heavily upon and depresses the moral energies of the poorer classes.\r\n     The acquisition of a respectable position in the scale of wealth\r\n     appears so difficult, that they decline the hopeless pursuit, and\r\n     many of them settle down into habits of idleness, and become the\r\n     almost passive subjects of all its consequences. And I lament to say\r\n     that I have observed of late years, that an evident deterioration is\r\n     taking place in this part of the population, the younger portion of\r\n     it being less educated, less industrious, and in every point of view\r\n     less respectable than their ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nEqually worthy of attention is the testimony of Gov. Hammond, of South\r\nCarolina, who says:--\r\n\r\n     \"According to the best calculation, which, in the absence of\r\n     statistic facts, can be made, it is believed, that of the three\r\n     hundred thousand white inhabitants of South Carolina, there are not\r\n     less than fifty thousand whose industry, such as it is, and\r\n     compensated as it is, is not, in the present condition of things, and\r\n     does not promise to be hereafter, adequate to procure them, honestly,\r\n     such a support as every white person is, and feels himself entitled\r\n     to. And this, next to emigration, is, perhaps, the heaviest of the\r\n     weights that press upon the springs of our prosperity. Most of these\r\n     now follow agricultural pursuits, in feeble, yet injurious\r\n     competition with slave labor. Some, perhaps, not more from\r\n     inclination, than from the want of due encouragement, can scarcely be\r\n     said to work at all. They obtain a precarious subsistence, by\r\n     occasional jobs, by hunting, by fishing, sometimes by plundering\r\n     fields or folds, and too often by what is, in its effects, far\r\n     worse--trading with slaves, and seducing them to plunder for their\r\n     benefit.\"\r\n\r\nConjoined with the sundry plain straightforward facts which have issued\r\nfrom our own pen, these extracts show conclusively that immediate and\r\nindependent political action on the part of the non-slaveholding whites\r\nof the South, is, with them, a matter, not only of positive duty, but also\r\nof the utmost importance. As yet, it is in their power to rescue the South\r\nfrom the gulf of shame and guilt, into which slavery has plunged her; but\r\nif they do not soon arouse themselves from their apathy, this power will\r\nbe wrenched from them, and then, unable to resist the strong arm of the\r\noppressor, they will be completely degraded to a social and political\r\nlevel with the negroes, whose condition of servitude will, in the\r\nmeantime, become far more abject and forlorn than it is now.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reasons which we have already assigned why no slavocrat\r\nshould, in the future, be elected to any office whatever, there are others\r\nthat deserve to be carefully considered. Among these may be mentioned the\r\nillbreeding and the ruffianism of slaveholding officials. Tedious indeed\r\nwould be the task to enumerate all the homicides, duels, assaults and\r\nbatteries, and other crimes, of which they are the authors in the course\r\nof a single year. To the general reader their career at the seat of\r\ngovernment is well known; there, on frequent occasions, choking with rage\r\nat seeing their wretched sophistries scattered to the winds by the sound,\r\nlogical reasoning of the champions of Freedom, they have overstepped the\r\nbounds of common decency, vacated the chair of honorable controversy, and,\r\nin the most brutal and cowardly manner, assailed their unarmed opponents\r\nwith bludgeons, bowie knives and pistols. Compared with some of their\r\nbarbarisms at home, however, their frenzied onslaughts at the national\r\nCapital have been but the simplest breaches of civil deportment; and it\r\nis only for the purpose of avoiding personalities that we now refrain from\r\ndivulging a few instances of the unparalleled atrocities which they have\r\nperpetrated in legislative halls South of the Potomac. Nor is it alone in\r\nthe national and State legislatures that they substitute brute force for\r\ngenteel behavior and acuteness of intellect. Neither court-houses nor\r\npublic streets, hotels nor private dwellings, rum-holes nor law-offices,\r\nare held sacred from their murderous conflicts. About certain silly\r\nabstractions that no practical business man ever allows to occupy his time\r\nor attention, they are eternally wrangling; and thus it is that\r\nrencounters, duels, homicides, and other demonstrations of personal\r\nviolence, have become so popular in all slaveholding communities. A few\r\nyears of entire freedom from the cares and perplexities of public life,\r\nwould, we have no doubt, greatly improve both their manners and their\r\nmorals; and we suggest that it is a Christian duty, which devolves on the\r\nnon-slaveholders of the South, to disrobe them of the mantle of office,\r\nwhich they have so long worn with disgrace to themselves, injustice to\r\ntheir constituents, and ruin to their country.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we say of such men as Botts, Stuart, and Macfarland of\r\nVirginia; of Raynor, Morehead, Miller, Stanly, Graves, and Graham of North\r\nCarolina; of Davis and Hoffman of Maryland; of Blair and Benton of\r\nMissouri; of the Marshalls of Kentucky; and of Etheridge of Tennessee? All\r\nthese gentlemen, and many others of the same school, entertain, we\r\nbelieve, sentiments similar to those that were entertained by the immortal\r\nFathers of the Republic--that slavery is a great moral, social, civil,\r\nand political evil, to be got rid of at the earliest practical period--and\r\nif they do, in order to secure our votes, it is only necessary for them to\r\n\"have the courage of their opinions,\" to renounce slavery, and to come out\r\nfrankly, fairly and squarely, in favor of freedom. To neither of these\r\npatriotic sons of the South, nor to any one of the class to which they\r\nbelong, would we give any offence whatever. In our strictures on the\r\ncriminality of pro-slavery demagogues we have had heretofore, and shall\r\nhave hereafter, no sort of reference to any respectable slaveholder--by\r\nwhich we mean, any slaveholder who admits the injustice and inhumanity of\r\nslavery, and who is not averse to the discussion of measures for its\r\nspeedy and total extinction. Such slaveholders are virtually on our side,\r\nthat is, on the side of the non-slaveholding whites, with whom they may\r\nvery properly be classified. On this point, once for all, we desire to be\r\ndistinctly understood; for it would be manifestly unjust not to\r\ndiscriminate between the anti-slavery proprietor who owns slaves by the\r\nlaw of entailment, and the pro-slavery proprietor who engages in the\r\ntraffic and becomes an aider and abettor of the institution from sheer\r\nturpitude of heart; hence the propriety of this special disclaimer.\r\n\r\nIf we have a correct understanding of the positions which they assumed,\r\nsome of the gentlemen whose names are written above, gave, during the last\r\npresidential campaign, ample evidence of their unswerving devotion to the\r\ninterests of the great majority of the people, the non-slaveholding\r\nwhites; and it is our unbiassed opinion that a more positive truth is no\r\nwhere recorded in Holy Writ, than Kenneth Raynor uttered, when he said,\r\nin substance, that the greatest good that could happen to this country\r\nwould be the complete overthrow of slave-driving democracy, _alias_ the\r\nnigger party, which has for its head and front the Ritchies and Wises of\r\nVirginia, and for its caudal termination the Butlers and Quatlebums of\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nAnd this, by the way, is a fit occasion to call attention to the fact,\r\nthat slave-driving Democrats have been the perpetrators of almost every\r\nbrutal outrage that ever disgraced our halls of legislation. Of countless\r\ninstances of assault and battery, affrays, and fatal rencounters, that\r\nhave occurred in the court-houses, capitols, and other public buildings in\r\nthe Southern States, we feel safe in saying that the aggressor, in at\r\nleast nine cases out of ten, has been a negro-nursed adherent of modern,\r\nmiscalled democracy. So, too, the challenger to almost every duel has been\r\nan abandoned wretch, who, on many occasions during infancy, sucked in the\r\ncorrupt milk of slavery from the breasts of his father's sable concubines,\r\nand who has never been known to become weary of boasting of a fact that\r\ninvariably impressed itself on the minds of his auditors or observers, the\r\nvery first moment they laid their eyes upon him, namely, that _he_ was a\r\nmember of the Democratic party. Brute violence, however, can hardly be\r\nsaid to be the worst characteristic of the slave-driving Democrat; his\r\nignorance and squalidity are proverbial; his senseless enthusiasm is\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\nPeculiarly illustrative of the material of which sham democracy is\r\ncomposed was the vote polled at the Five Points precinct, in the city of\r\nNew-York, on the 4th of November, 1856, when James Buchanan was chosen\r\nPresident by a _minority_ of the people. We will produce the figures:\r\n\r\nFive Points Precinct, New-York City, 1856.\r\n\r\n  Votes cast for James Buchanan      574\r\n   \"     \"    \"  John C. Fremont      16\r\n   \"     \"    \"  Millard Fillmore      9\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Col. Fremont's majority over Buchanan, in the\r\nState of New-York, was between seventy-eight and seventy-nine thousand,\r\nand that he ran ahead of the Fillmore ticket to the number of nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty-one thousand. We have not the shadow of a doubt that he\r\nis perfectly satisfied with Mr. Buchanan's triumph at the Five Points,\r\nwhich, with the exception of the slave-pens in Southern cities, is,\r\nperhaps, the most vile and heart-sickening locality in the United States.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable and commendable features of the last general\r\nelection is this: almost every State, whose inhabitants have enjoyed the\r\nadvantages of free soil, free labor, free speech, free presses, and free\r\nschools, and who have, in consequence, become great in numbers, in virtue,\r\nin wealth, and in wisdom, voted for Fremont, the Republican candidate, who\r\nwas pledged to use his influence for the extension of like advantages to\r\nother parts of the country. On the other hand, with a single honorable\r\nexception, all the States which \"have got to hating everything with the\r\nprefix Free, from free negroes down and up through the whole\r\ncatalogue--free farms, free labor, free society, free will, free thinking,\r\nfree children, and free schools,\" and which have exposed their citizens to\r\nall the perils of numerical weakness, absolute ignorance, and hopeless\r\npoverty, voted for Buchanan, the Democratic candidate, who, in reply to\r\nthe overtures of his slave-driving partisans, had signified his\r\nwillingness to pursue a policy that would perpetuate and disseminate,\r\nwithout limit, the multitudinous evils of human bondage.\r\n\r\nLed on by a huckstering politician, whose chief vocation, at all times, is\r\nthe rallying of ragamuffins, shoulder strikers, and liquor-house\r\nvagabonds, into the ranks of his party, and who, it is well known,\r\nreceives from the agents of the slave power, regular installments of money\r\nfor this infamous purpose, a Democratic procession, exceedingly motley and\r\nunrefined, marched through the streets of one of the great cities of the\r\nNorth, little less than a fortnight previous to the election of Mr.\r\nBuchanan to the Presidency; and the occasion gave rise, on the following\r\nday, to a communication in one of the morning papers, from which we make\r\nthe following pertinent extract:\r\n\r\n     \"While the Democratic procession was passing through the streets of\r\n     this city, a few days since, I could not but think how significant\r\n     the exultation of that ignorant multitude was of the ferocious\r\n     triumphs which would be displayed if ever false Democracy should\r\n     succeed in throwing the whole power of the country into the hands of\r\n     the Slave Oligarchy. It is melancholy to think that every individual\r\n     in that multitude, ignorant and depraved though he may be, foreign\r\n     perhaps in his birth, and utterly unacquainted with the principles\r\n     upon which the welfare of the country depends, and hostile it may be\r\n     to those principles, if he does understand them, is equal in the\r\n     power which he may exercise by his vote to the most intelligent and\r\n     upright man in the community.\r\n\r\n     \"Of this, indeed, it is useless to complain. We enjoy our freedom\r\n     with the contingency of its loss by the acts of a numerical majority.\r\n     It behooves all men, therefore, who have a regard to the common\r\n     good, to look carefully at the influences which may pervert the\r\n     popular mind; and this, I think, can only be done by guarding against\r\n     the corruption of individual character. A man who has nothing but\r\n     political business to attend to--I mean the management of\r\n     elections--ought to be shunned by all honest men. If it were\r\n     possible, he should have the mark of Cain put upon him, that he might\r\n     be known as a plotter against the welfare of his country.\"\r\n\r\nThat less than _three_ per cent. of those who voted for Col. Fremont, that\r\nonly about _five_ per cent. of those who gave their suffrages to Mr.\r\nFillmore, and that more than _eighteen_ per cent. of those who supported\r\nMr. Buchanan, were persons over one and twenty years of age who could not\r\nread and write, are estimates which we have no doubt are not far from the\r\ntruth, and which, in the absence of reliable statistics, we venture to\r\ngive, hoping, by their publicity, to draw closer attention to the fact,\r\nthat the illiterate foreigners of the North, and the unlettered natives of\r\nthe South, were cordially united in their suicidal adherence to the Nigger\r\nparty. With few exceptions, all the intelligent non-slaveholders of the\r\nSouth, in concert with the more respectable slaveholders, voted for Mr.\r\nFillmore; certain rigidly patriotic persons of the former class, whose\r\nhearts were so entirely with the gallant Fremont that they refused to vote\r\nat all--simply because they did not dare to express their preference for\r\nhim--form the exceptions to which we allude.\r\n\r\nThough the Whig, Democratic, and Know-Nothing newspapers, in all the\r\nStates, free and slave, denounced Col. Fremont as an intolerant Catholic,\r\nit is now generally conceded that he was nowhere supported by the\r\npeculiar friends of Pope Pius IX. The votes polled at the Five Points\r\nprecinct, which is almost exclusively inhabited by low Irish Catholics,\r\nshow how powerfully the Jesuitical influence was brought to bear against\r\nhim. At that delectable locality, as we have already shown, the timid Sage\r\nof Wheatland received five hundred and seventy-four votes; whereas the\r\ndauntless Finder of Empire received only sixteen.\r\n\r\nTrue to their instincts for Freedom, the Germans, generally, voted the\r\nright ticket, and they will do it again, and continue to do it. With the\r\nintelligent Protestant element of the Fatherland on our side, we can well\r\nafford to dispense with the ignorant Catholic element of the Emerald Isle.\r\nIn the influences which they exert on society, there is so little\r\ndifference between Slavery, Popery, and Negro-driving Democracy, that we\r\nare not at all surprised to see them going hand in hand in their\r\ndiabolical works of inhumanity and desolation.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, no lack of evidence to show that the Democratic party of\r\nto-day is simply and unreservedly a sectional Nigger party. On the 15th of\r\nDecember, 1856, but a few weeks subsequent to the appearance of a\r\nscandalous message from an infamous governor of South Carolina,\r\nrecommending the reopening of the African slave trade, Emerson Etheridge\r\nof Tennessee--honor to his name!--submitted, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the following timely resolution:--\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That this House regard all suggestions or propositions of\r\n     every kind, by whomsoever made, for a revival of the slave trade, as\r\n     shocking to the moral sentiments of the enlightened portion of\r\n     mankind, and that any act on the part of Congress, legislating for,\r\n     conniving at, or legalizing that horrid and inhuman traffic, would\r\n     justly subject the United States to the reproach and execration of\r\n     all civilized and Christian people throughout the world.\"\r\n\r\nWho voted _for_ this resolution? and who voted _against_ it? Let the yeas\r\nand nays answer; they are on record, and he who takes the trouble to\r\nexamine them will find that the resolution encountered no opposition worth\r\nmentioning, except from members of the Democratic party. Scrutinize the\r\nyeas and nays on any other motion or resolution affecting the question of\r\nslavery, and the fact that a majority of the members of this party have\r\nuniformly voted for the retention and extension of the \"sum of all\r\nvillanies,\" will at once be apparent.\r\n\r\nFor many years the slave-driving Democrats of the South have labored most\r\nstrenuously, both by day and by night--we regret to say how\r\nunsuccessfully--to point out abolition proclivities in the Whig and\r\nKnow-Nothing parties, the latter of which is now buried, and deservedly,\r\nso deep in the depths of the dead, that it is quite preposterous to\r\nsuppose it will ever see the light of resurrection.\r\n\r\nFor its truckling concessions to the slave power, the Whig party merited\r\ndefeat, and defeated it was, and that, too, in the most decisive and\r\noverwhelming manner. But there is yet in this party much vitality, and if\r\nits friends will reorganize, detach themselves from the burden of slavery,\r\nespouse the cause of the white man, and hoist the fair flag of freedom,\r\nthe time may come, at a day by no means remote, when their hearts will\r\nexult in triumph over the ruins of miscalled Democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is not too late, however, for the Democratic party to secure to itself\r\na pure renown and an almost certain perpetuation of its power. Let it at\r\nonce discard the worship of slavery, and do earnest battle for the\r\nprinciples of freedom, and it will live victoriously to a period far in\r\nthe future. On the other hand, if it does not soon repudiate the fatal\r\nheresies which it has incorporated into its creed, its doom will be\r\ninevitable. Until the black flag entirely disappears from its array, we\r\nwarn the non-slaveholders of the South to repulse and keep it at a\r\ndistance, as they would the emblazoned skull and cross-bones that flout\r\nthem from the flag of the pirate.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the sophistical reasoning which teaches that abolitionists,\r\nbefore abolishing slavery, should compensate the slaveholders for all or\r\nany number of the negroes in their possession, we have, perhaps, said\r\nquite enough; but wishing to brace our arguments, in every important\r\nparticular, with unequivocal testimony from men whom we are accustomed to\r\nregard as models of political sagacity and integrity--from Southern men as\r\nfar as possible--we herewith present an extract from a speech delivered in\r\nthe Virginia House of Delegates, January 20, 1832, by Charles James\r\nFaulkner, whose sentiments, as then and there expressed, can hardly fail\r\nto find a response in the heart of every intelligent, upright man:--\r\n\r\n     \"But, Sir, it is said that society having conferred this property on\r\n     the slaveholder, it cannot _now_ take it from him without an adequate\r\n     compensation, by which is meant full value. I may be singular in the\r\n     opinion, but I defy the legal research of the House to point me to a\r\n     principle recognized by the law, even in the ordinary course of its\r\n     adjudications, where the community pays for property which is\r\n     removed or destroyed because it is a nuisance, and found injurious to\r\n     that society. There is, I humbly apprehend, no such principle. There\r\n     is no obligation upon society to continue your right one moment after\r\n     it becomes injurious to the best interests of society; nor to\r\n     compensate you for the loss of that, the deprivation of which is\r\n     demanded by the safety of the State, and in which general benefit you\r\n     participate as members of the community. Sir, there is to my mind a\r\n     manifest distinction between condemning private property to be\r\n     applied to some beneficial public purpose, and condemning or removing\r\n     private property which is ascertained to be a positive wrong to\r\n     society. It is a distinction which pervades the whole genius of the\r\n     law; and is founded upon the idea, that any man who holds property\r\n     injurious to the peace of that society of which he is a member,\r\n     thereby violates the condition upon the observance of which his right\r\n     to the property is alone guarantied. For property of the first class\r\n     condemned, there ought to be compensation; but for property of the\r\n     latter class, none can be demanded upon principle, none accorded as\r\n     matter of right.\r\n\r\n     \"It is conceded that, at this precise moment of our legislation,\r\n     slaves are injurious to the interests and threaten the subversion and\r\n     ruin of this Commonwealth. Their present number, their increasing\r\n     number, all admonish us of this. In different terms, and in more\r\n     measured language, the same fact has been conceded by all who have\r\n     yet addressed this House. '_Something must be done_,' emphatically\r\n     exclaimed the gentleman from Dinwiddie; and I thought I could\r\n     perceive a response to that declaration, in the countenance of a\r\n     large majority of this body. And why must something be done? Because\r\n     if not, says the gentleman from Campbell, the throats of all the\r\n     _white_ people of Virginia will be cut. No, says the gentleman from\r\n     Dinwiddie--'The whites cannot be conquered--the throats of the\r\n     _blacks_ will be cut.' It is a trifling difference, to be sure, Sir,\r\n     and matters not to the argument. For the fact is conceded, that one\r\n     race or the other must be exterminated.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, such being the actual condition of this Commonwealth, I ask if\r\n     we would not be justified _now_, supposing all considerations of\r\n     policy and humanity concurred without even a moment's delay, in\r\n     staving off this appalling and overwhelming calamity? Sir, if this\r\n     immense negro population were now in arms, gathering into black and\r\n     formidable masses of attack, would that man be listened to, who spoke\r\n     about property, who prayed you not to direct your artillery to such\r\n     or such a point, for you would destroy some of _his_ property? Sir,\r\n     to the eye of the Statesman, as to the eye of Omniscience, dangers\r\n     pressing, and dangers that must _necessarily_ press, are alike\r\n     present. With a single glance he embraces Virginia now, with the\r\n     elements of destruction reposing quietly upon her bosom, and Virginia\r\n     is lighted from one extremity to the other with the torch of servile\r\n     insurrection and massacre. It is not sufficient for him that the\r\n     match is not yet applied. It is enough that the magazine is open, and\r\n     the match will shortly be applied.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, it is true in national as it is in private contracts, that loss\r\n     and injury to one party may constitute as fair a consideration as\r\n     gain to the other. Does the slaveholder, while he is enjoying his\r\n     slaves, reflect upon the deep injury and incalculable loss which the\r\n     possession of that property inflicts upon the true interests of the\r\n     country? Slavery, it is admitted, is an evil--it is an institution\r\n     which presses heavily against the best interests of the State. It\r\n     banishes free white labor, it exterminates the mechanic, the artisan,\r\n     the manufacturer. It deprives them of occupation. It deprives them of\r\n     bread. It converts the energy of a community into indolence, its\r\n     power into imbecility, its efficiency into weakness. Sir, being thus\r\n     injurious, have we not a right to demand its extermination? shall\r\n     society suffer, that the slaveholder may continue to gather his\r\n     _crop_ of human flesh? What is his mere pecuniary claim, compared\r\n     with the great interests of the common weal? Must the country\r\n     languish, droop, die, that the slaveholder may flourish? Shall all\r\n     interests be subservient to one--all rights subordinate to those of\r\n     the slaveholder? Has not the mechanic, have not the middle classes\r\n     their rights--rights incompatible with the existence of slavery?\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, so great and overshadowing are the evils of slavery--so\r\n     sensibly are they felt by those who have traced the causes of our\r\n     national decline--so perceptible is the poisonous operation of its\r\n     principles in the varied and diversified interests of this\r\n     Commonwealth, that all, whose minds are not warped by prejudice or\r\n     interest, must admit that the disease has now assumed that mortal\r\n     tendency, as to justify the application of any remedy which, under\r\n     the great law of State necessity, we might consider advisable.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the abstract of our plan for the abolition of slavery, it will be\r\nperceived that, so far from allowing slaveholders any compensation for\r\ntheir slaves, we are, and we think justly, in favor of imposing on them a\r\ntax of sixty dollars for each and every negro now in their possession, as\r\nalso for each and every one that shall be born to them between now and the\r\n4th of July, 1863; after which time, we propose that they shall be taxed\r\nforty dollars per annum, annually, for every person by them held in\r\nslavery, without regard to age, sex, color, or condition--the money, in\r\nboth instances, to be used for the sole advantage of the slaves. As an\r\naddendum to this proposition, we would say that, in our opinion, if\r\nslavery is not totally abolished by the year 1869, the annual tax ought to\r\nbe increased from forty to one hundred dollars; and furthermore, that if\r\nthe institution does not then almost immediately disappear under the onus\r\nof this increased taxation, the tax ought in the course of one or two\r\nyears thereafter, to be augmented to such a degree as will, in harmony\r\nwith other measures, prove an infallible death-blow to slavery on or\r\nbefore the 4th of July, 1876.\r\n\r\nAt once let the good and true men of this country, the patriot sons of the\r\npatriot fathers, determine that the sun which rises to celebrate the\r\ncentennial anniversary of our national independence, shall not set on the\r\nhead of any slave within the limits of our Republic. Will not the\r\nnon-slaveholders of the North, of the South, of the East, and of the West,\r\nheartily, unanimously sanction this proposition? Will it not be cheerfully\r\nindorsed by many of the slaveholders themselves? Will any _respectable_\r\nman enter a protest against it? On the 4th of July, 1876--sooner, if we\r\ncan--let us make good, at least so far as we are concerned, the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, which was proclaimed in Philadelphia on the\r\n4th of July, 1776--that \"all men are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights; that among these, are life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted\r\namong men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;\r\nthat whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it\r\nis the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a\r\nnew government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing\r\nits powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their\r\nsafety and happiness.\" In purging our land of the iniquity of negro\r\nslavery, we will only be carrying on the great work that was so\r\nsuccessfully commenced by our noble sires of the Revolution; some future\r\ngeneration may possibly complete the work by annulling the last and least\r\nform of oppression.\r\n\r\nTo turn the slaves away from their present homes--away from all the\r\nproperty and means of support which their labor has mainly produced, would\r\nbe unpardonably cruel--exceedingly unjust. Still more cruel and unjust\r\nwould it be, however, to the non-slaveholding whites no less than to the\r\nnegroes, to grant further toleration to the existence of slavery. In any\r\nevent, come what will, transpire what may, the institution must be\r\nabolished. The evils, if any, which are to result from its abolition,\r\ncannot, by any manner of means, be half as great as the evils which are\r\ncertain to overtake us in case of its continuance. The perpetuation of\r\nslavery is the climax of iniquity.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and thirty-seven years have the negroes in America been held\r\nin inhuman bondage. During the whole of this long period they have toiled\r\nunceasingly from the gray of dawn till the dusk of eve, for their cruel\r\ntask-masters, who have rewarded them with scanty allowances of the most\r\ninferior qualities of victuals and clothes, with heartless separations of\r\nthe tenderest ties of kindred, with epithets, with scoldings, with\r\nexecrations, and with the lash--and, not unfrequently, with the fatal\r\nbludgeon or the more deadly weapon. From the labor of their hands, and\r\nfrom the fruit of their loins, the humanmongers of the South have become\r\nwealthy, insolent, corrupt, and tyrannical. In reason and in conscience\r\nthe slaves might claim from their masters a much larger sum than we have\r\nproposed to allow them. If they were to demand an equal share of all the\r\nproperty, real and personal, which has been accumulated or produced\r\nthrough their efforts, Heaven, we believe, would recognize them as honest\r\nclaimants.\r\n\r\nElsewhere we have shown, by just and liberal estimates, that, on the\r\nsingle score of damages to lands, the slaveholders are, at this moment,\r\nindebted to the non-slaveholding whites in the extraordinary sum of\r\n$7,544,148,825. Considered in connection with the righteous claim of\r\nwages for services which the negroes might bring against their masters,\r\nthese figures are the heralds of the significant fact that, if strict\r\njustice could be meted out to all parties in the South, the slaveholders\r\nwould not only be stripped of every dollar, but they would become in law\r\nas they are in reality, the hopeless debtors of the myriads of unfortunate\r\nslaves, white and black, who are now cringing, and fawning, and festering\r\naround them. In this matter, however, so far has wrong triumphed over\r\nright, that the slaveholders--a mere handful of tyrants, whose manual\r\nexercises are wholly comprised in the use they make of instruments of\r\ntorture, such as whips, clubs, bowie-knives and pistols--have, as the\r\nresult of a series of acts of their own villainous legislation, become the\r\nsole and niggardly proprietors of almost every important item of Southern\r\nwealth; not only do they own all the slaves--none of whom any really\r\nrespectable person cares to own--but they are also in possession of the\r\nmore valuable tracts of land and the appurtenances thereto belonging;\r\nwhile the non-slaveholding whites and the negroes, who compose at least\r\nnine-tenths of the entire population, and who are the actual producers of\r\nevery article of merchandize, animal, vegetable, and mineral, that is sold\r\nfrom the South, are most wickedly despoiled of the fruits of their labors,\r\nand cast into the dismal abodes of extreme ignorance, destitution and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nFor the services of the blacks from the 20th of August, 1620, up to the\r\n4th of July, 1863--an interval of precisely two hundred and forty-two\r\nyears ten months and fourteen days--their masters, if unwilling, ought,\r\nin our judgment, to be compelled to grant them their freedom, and to pay\r\neach and every one of them at least sixty dollars cash in hand. The\r\naggregate sum thus raised would amount to about two hundred and forty-five\r\nmillions of dollars, which is less than the total market value of two\r\nentire crops of cotton--one-half of which sum would be amply sufficient to\r\nland every negro in this country on the coast of Liberia, whither, if we\r\nhad the power, we would ship them all within the next six months. As a\r\nmeans of protection against the exigencies which might arise from a sudden\r\ntransition from their present homes in America to their future homes in\r\nAfrica, and for the purpose of enabling them there to take the initiatory\r\nstep in the walks of civilized life, the remainder of the sum--say about\r\none hundred and twenty-two millions of dollars--might, very properly, be\r\nequally distributed amongst them after their arrival in the land of their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nDr. James Hall, the Secretary of the Maryland Colonization Society,\r\ninforms us that the average cost of sending negroes to Liberia does not\r\nexceed thirty dollars each; and it is his opinion that arrangements might\r\nbe made on an extensive plan for conveying them thither at an average\r\nexpense of not more than twenty-five dollars each.\r\n\r\nThe American colonization movement, as now systematized and conducted, is\r\nsimply an American humane farce. At present the slaves are increasing in\r\nthis country at the rate of nearly one hundred thousand per annum; within\r\nthe last ten years, as will appear below, the American Colonization\r\nSociety has sent to Liberia less than five thousand negroes.\r\n\r\nEmigrants sent to Liberia by the American Colonization Society, during the\r\nten years ending January 1st, 1857.\r\n\r\n  In 1847               39 }\r\n  In 1848              213 }\r\n  In 1849              474 }\r\n  In 1850              590 }\r\n  In 1851              279 }\r\n  In 1852              568 } Emigrants.\r\n  In 1853              583 }\r\n  In 1854              783 }\r\n  In 1855              207 }\r\n  In 1856              544 }\r\n                      ---- }\r\n          Total       4280 }\r\n\r\nThe average of this total is precisely four hundred and twenty-eight,\r\nwhich may be said to be the number of negroes annually colonized by the\r\nsociety; while the yearly increase of slaves, as previously stated, is\r\nlittle less than one hundred thousand! Fiddlesticks for such colonization!\r\nOnce for all, within a reasonably short period, let us make the\r\nslaveholders do something like justice to their negroes by giving each and\r\nevery one of them his freedom, and sixty dollars in current money; then\r\nlet us charter all the ocean steamers, packets and clipper ships that can\r\nbe had on liberal terms, and keep them constantly plying between the ports\r\nof America and Africa, until all slaves shall enjoy freedom in the land of\r\ntheir fathers. Under a well-devised and properly conducted system of\r\noperations, but a few years would be required to redeem the United States\r\nfrom the monstrous curse of negro slavery.\r\n\r\nSome few years ago, when certain ethnographical oligarchs proved to their\r\nown satisfaction that the negro was an inferior \"type of mankind,\" they\r\nchuckled wonderfully, and avowed, in substance, that it was right for the\r\nstronger race to kidnap and enslave the weaker--that because Nature had\r\nbeen pleased to do a trifle more for the Caucasian race than for the\r\nAfrican, the former, by virtue of its superiority, was perfectly\r\njustifiable in holding the latter in absolute and perpetual bondage! No\r\nsystem of logic could be more antagonistic to the spirit of true\r\ndemocracy. It is probable that the world does not contain two persons who\r\nare exactly alike in all respects; yet \"_all_ men are endowed by their\r\nCreator with certain _inalienable_ rights, among which are life,\r\n_liberty_, and the pursuit of happiness.\" All mankind may or may not be\r\nthe descendants of Adam and Eve. In our own humble way of thinking, we are\r\nfrank to confess, we do not believe in the unity of the races. This is a\r\nmatter, however, which has little or nothing to do with the great question\r\nat issue. Aside from any theory concerning the original parentage of the\r\ndifferent races of men, facts, material and immaterial, palpable and\r\nimpalpable--facts of the eyes and facts of the conscience--crowd around us\r\non every hand, heaping proof upon proof, that slavery is a shame, a crime,\r\nand a curse--a great moral, social, civil, and political evil--an\r\noppressive burden to the blacks, and an incalculable injury to the\r\nwhites--a stumbling-block to the nation, an impediment to progress, a\r\ndamper on all the nobler instincts, principles, aspirations and\r\nenterprises of man, and a dire enemy to every true interest.\r\n\r\nWaiving all other counts, we have, we think, shown to the satisfaction of\r\nevery impartial reader, that, as elsewhere stated, on the single score of\r\ndamages to lands, the slaveholders are, at this moment, indebted to us,\r\nthe non-slaveholding whites, in the enormous sum of nearly seventy-six\r\nhundred millions of dollars. What shall be done with this amount? It is\r\njust; shall payment be demanded? No; all the slaveholders in the country\r\ncould not pay it; nor shall we ever ask them for even a moiety of the\r\namount--no, not even for a dime, nor yet for a cent; we are willing to\r\nforfeit every farthing for the sake of freedom; for ourselves we ask no\r\nindemnification for the past: we only demand justice for the future.\r\n\r\nBut, Sirs, knights of bludgeons, chevaliers of bowie-knives and pistols,\r\nand lords of the lash, we are unwilling to allow you to swindle the slaves\r\nout of all the rights and claims to which, as human beings, they are most\r\nsacredly entitled. Not alone for ourself as an individual, but for others\r\nalso--particularly for five or six millions of Southern non-slaveholding\r\nwhites, whom your iniquitous statism has debarred from almost all the\r\nmental and material comforts of life--do we speak, when we say, you _must_\r\nemancipate your slaves, and pay each and every one of them at least sixty\r\ndollars cash in hand. By doing this, you will be restoring to them their\r\nnatural rights, and remunerating them at the rate of less than twenty-six\r\ncents per annum for the long and cheerless period of their servitude, from\r\nthe 20th of August, 1620, when, on James River, in Virginia, they became\r\nthe unhappy slaves of heartless masters. Moreover, by doing this you will\r\nbe performing but a simple act of justice to the non-slaveholding whites,\r\nupon whom the institution of slavery has weighed scarcely less heavily\r\nthan upon the negroes themselves. You will also be applying a saving balm\r\nto your own outraged hearts and consciences, and your children--yourselves\r\nin fact--freed from the accursed stain of slavery, will become\r\nrespectable, useful, and honorable members of society.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sirs, we have thus laid down our ultimatum. What are you going to\r\ndo about it? Something dreadful, as a matter of course! Perhaps you will\r\ndissolve the Union _again_. Do it, if you dare! Our motto, and we would\r\nhave you to understand it, is _the abolition of slavery, and the\r\nperpetuation of the American Union_. If, by any means, you do succeed in\r\nyour treasonable attempts to take the South out of the Union to-day, we\r\nwill bring her back to-morrow--if she goes away with you, she will return\r\nwithout you.\r\n\r\nDo not mistake the meaning of the last clause of the last sentence; we\r\ncould elucidate it so thoroughly that no intelligent person could fail to\r\ncomprehend it; but, for reasons which may hereafter appear, we forego the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nHenceforth there are other interests to be consulted in the South, aside\r\nfrom the interests of negroes and slaveholders. A profound sense of duty\r\nincites us to make the greatest possible efforts for the abolition of\r\nslavery; an equally profound sense of duty calls for a continuation of\r\nthose efforts until the very last foe to freedom shall have been utterly\r\nvanquished. To the summons of the righteous monitor within, we shall\r\nendeavor to prove faithful; no opportunity for inflicting a mortal wound\r\nin the side of slavery shall be permitted to pass us unimproved. Thus,\r\nterror-engenderers of the South, have we fully and frankly defined our\r\nposition; we have no modifications to propose, no compromises to offer,\r\nnothing to retract. Frown, Sirs, fret, foam, prepare your weapons, threat,\r\nstrike, shoot, stab, bring on civil war, dissolve the Union, nay\r\nannihilate the solar system if you will--do all this, more, less, better,\r\nworse, anything--do what you will, Sirs, you can neither foil nor\r\nintimidate us; our purpose is as firmly fixed as the eternal pillars of\r\nHeaven; we have determined to abolish slavery, and, so help us God,\r\nabolish it we will! Take this to bed with you to-night, Sirs, and think\r\nabout it, dream over it, and let us know how you feel to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN TESTIMONY AGAINST SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it please the reader, let him forget all that we have written on the\r\nsubject of slavery; if it accord with his inclination, let him ignore all\r\nthat we may write hereafter. We seek not to give currency to our peculiar\r\nopinions; our greatest ambition, in these pages, is to popularize the\r\nsayings and admonitions of wiser and better men. Miracles, we believe, are\r\nno longer wrought in this bedeviled world; but if, by any conceivable or\r\npossible supernatural event, the great Founders of the Republic,\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Henry, and others, could be reinvested with\r\ncorporeal life, and returned to the South, there is scarcely a slaveholder\r\nbetween the Potomac and the mouth of the Mississippi, that would not burn\r\nto pounce upon them with bludgeons, bowie-knives and pistols! Yes, without\r\nadding another word, Washington would be _mobbed_ for what he has already\r\nsaid. Were Jefferson now employed as a professor in a Southern college, he\r\nwould be dismissed and driven from the State, perhaps murdered before he\r\nreached the border. If Patrick Henry were a bookseller in Alabama, though\r\nit might be demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that he had never\r\nbought, sold, received, or presented, any kind of literature except\r\nBibles and Testaments, he would first be subjected to the ignominy of a\r\ncoat of tar and feathers, and then limited to the option of unceremonious\r\nexpatriation or death. How seemingly impossible are these statements, and\r\nyet how true! Where do we stand? What is our faith? Are we a flock without\r\na shepherd? a people without a prophet? a nation without a government?\r\n\r\nHas the past, with all its glittering monuments of genius and patriotism,\r\nfurnished no beacon by which we may direct our footsteps in the future? If\r\nwe but prove true to ourselves, and worthy of our ancestry, we have\r\nnothing to fear; our Revolutionary sires have devised and bequeathed to us\r\nan almost perfect national policy. Let us cherish, and defend, and build\r\nupon, the fundamental principles of that polity, and we shall most\r\nassuredly reap the golden fruits of unparalleled power, virtue and\r\nprosperity. Heaven forbid that a desperate faction of slaveholding\r\ncriminals should succeed in their infamous endeavors to quench the spirit\r\nof liberty, which our forefathers infused into those two sacred charts of\r\nour political faith, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution\r\nof the United States. Oligarchal politicians are alone responsible for the\r\ncontinuance of African slavery in the South. For purposes of\r\nself-aggrandizement, they have kept learning and civilization from the\r\npeople; they have wilfully misinterpreted the national compacts, and have\r\noutraged their own consciences by declaring to their illiterate\r\nconstituents, that the Founders of the Republic were not abolitionists.\r\nWhen the dark clouds of slavery, error and ignorance shall have passed\r\naway,--and we believe the time is near at hand when they are to be\r\ndissipated,--the freemen of the South, like those of other sections, will\r\nlearn the glorious truth, that inflexible opposition to Human Bondage has\r\nformed one of the distinguishing characteristics of every really good or\r\ngreat man that our country has produced.\r\n\r\nThe principles, aims and objects that actuated the framers of the\r\nConstitution, are most graphically and eloquently set forth, in the\r\nfollowing extract from a speech recently delivered by the Hon. A. H.\r\nCragin, of New Hampshire, in the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n     \"When our forefathers reared the magnificent structure of a free\r\n     Republic in this Western land, they laid its foundations broad and\r\n     deep in the eternal principles of right. Its materials were all\r\n     quarried from the mountain of truth; and, as it rose majestically\r\n     before an astonished world, it rejoiced the hearts and hopes of\r\n     mankind. Tyrants only cursed the workmen and their workmanship. Its\r\n     architecture was new. It had no model in Grecian or Roman history. It\r\n     seemed a paragon, let down from Heaven to inspire the hopes of men,\r\n     and to demonstrate the favor of God to the people of a new world. The\r\n     builders recognized the rights of human nature as universal. Liberty,\r\n     the great first right of man, they claimed for 'all men,' and claimed\r\n     it from 'God himself.' Upon this foundation they erected the temple,\r\n     and dedicated it to Liberty, Humanity, Justice, and Equality.\r\n     Washington was crowned its patron saint.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The work completed was the noblest effort of human wisdom. But it\r\n     was not perfect. It had one blemish--a little spot--the black stain\r\n     of slavery. The workmen--the friends of freedom everywhere--deplored\r\n     this. They labored long and prayerfully to remove this deformity.\r\n     They applied all the skill of their art; but they labored in vain.\r\n     Self-interest was too strong for patriotism and love of liberty. The\r\n     work stood still, and for a time it was doubtful whether the\r\n     experiment would succeed. The blot must remain, or the whole must\r\n     fail. The workmen revarnished their work, to conceal and cover up the\r\n     stain. Slavery was recognized, but not sanctioned. The word slave or\r\n     slavery must not mar the Constitution. So great an inconsistency must\r\n     not be proclaimed to the world.\"\r\n\r\n     \"All agreed, at that time, that the anomaly should not increase, and\r\n     all concurred in the hope and belief that the blemish would gradually\r\n     disappear. Those noble men looked forward to the time when slavery\r\n     would be abolished in this land of ours. They believed that the\r\n     principles of liberty were so dear to the people, that they would not\r\n     long deny to others what they claimed for themselves. They never\r\n     dreamed that slavery would be extended, but firmly believed it would\r\n     be wholly blotted out. _I challenge any man to show me a single\r\n     patriot of the Revolution who was in favor of slavery, or who\r\n     advocated its extension._ So universal was the sentiment of liberty\r\n     then, that no man, North or South, could be found to justify it. Some\r\n     palliated the evil, and desired that it might be gradually\r\n     extinguished; but none contemplated it as a permanent institution.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Liberty was then the national goddess, worshiped by all the people.\r\n     They sang of liberty, they harangued for liberty, they prayed for\r\n     liberty, and they sacrificed for liberty. Slavery was then hateful.\r\n     It was denounced by all. The British king was condemned for foisting\r\n     it upon the Colonies. Southern men were foremost in entering their\r\n     protest against it. It was then everywhere regarded as an evil, and a\r\n     crime against humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is too palpable to be disguised, that slavery and slaveholders\r\nhave always been a clog and a dead-weight upon the government--a disgrace\r\nand a curse to humanity. The slaveholding Tories of the South,\r\nparticularly of South Carolina, in their atrocious hostility to freedom,\r\nprolonged the arduous war of the Revolution from two to three years; and\r\nsince the termination of that momentous struggle, in which, thank Heaven,\r\nthey were most signally defeated, it has been their constant aim and\r\neffort to subvert the dear-bought liberties which were achieved by the\r\nnon-slaveholding patriots.\r\n\r\nNon-slaveholders of the South! up to the present period, neither as a\r\nbody, nor as individuals, have you ever had an independent existence; but,\r\nif true to yourselves and to the memory of your fathers, you, in equal\r\ncopartnership with the non-slaveholders of the North, will soon become the\r\nhonored rulers and proprietors of the most powerful, prosperous, virtuous,\r\nfree, and peaceful nation, on which the sun has ever shone. Already has\r\nthe time arrived for you to decide upon what basis you will erect your\r\npolitical superstructure. Upon whom will you depend for an equitable and\r\njudicious form of constitutional government? Whom will you designate as\r\nmodels for your future statesmen? Your choice lies between the dead and\r\nthe living--between the Washingtons, the Jeffersons and the Madisons of\r\nthe past, and the Quattlebums, the Quitmans and the Butlers of the\r\npresent. We have chosen; choose ye, remembering that freedom or slavery is\r\nto be the issue of your option.\r\n\r\nAs the result of much reading and research, and at the expenditure of no\r\ninconsiderable amount of time, labor and money, we now proceed to make\r\nknown the anti-slavery sentiments of those noble abolitionists, the\r\nFathers of the Republic, whose liberal measures of public policy have been\r\nso criminally perverted by the treacherous advocates of slavery.\r\n\r\nLet us listen, in the first place, to the voice of him who was \"first in\r\nwar, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,\" to\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to John F. Mercer, dated September 9th, 1786, General\r\nWashington says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I never mean, unless some particular circumstances should compel me\r\n     to it, to possess another slave by purchase, it being among my _first\r\n     wishes_ to see some plan adopted by which slavery, in this country,\r\n     may be abolished by law.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Robert Morris, dated Mount Vernon, April 12, 1786, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more\r\n     sincerely than I do to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it.\r\n     But there is only one proper and effectual mode by which it can be\r\n     accomplished, and that is by legislative authority; and this, as far\r\n     as my suffrage will go, shall never be wanting.\"\r\n\r\nHe says, in a letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"To the MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE--April 5th, 1783:--\r\n\r\n     The scheme, my dear Marquis, which you propose as a precedent, to\r\n     encourage the emancipation of the black people in this country from\r\n     the state of bondage in which they are held, is a striking evidence\r\n     of the benevolence of your heart. I shall be happy to join you in so\r\n     laudable a work; but will defer going into a detail of the business\r\n     till I have the pleasure of seeing you.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter to Lafayette, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The benevolence of your heart, my dear Marquis, is so conspicuous on\r\n     all occasions, that I never wonder at any fresh proofs of it; but\r\n     your late purchase of an estate in the Colony of Cayenne, with the\r\n     view of emancipating the slaves on it, is a generous and noble proof\r\n     of your humanity. Would to God a like spirit might diffuse itself\r\n     generally into the minds of the people of this country.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Sir John Sinclair, he further said:--\r\n\r\n     \"There are in Pennsylvania laws for the gradual abolition of slavery,\r\n     which neither Virginia nor Maryland have at present, but which\r\n     nothing is more certain than they must have, and at a period _not\r\n     remote_.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his last will and testament we make the following extract:\r\n\r\n     \"Upon the decease of my wife, it is my will and desire that all the\r\n     slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom. To\r\n     emancipate them during her life would, though earnestly wished by me,\r\n     be attended with such insuperable difficulties, on account of their\r\n     intermixture by marriage with the dower negroes, as to excite the\r\n     most painful sensation, if not disagreeable consequences, from the\r\n     latter, while both descriptions are in the occupancy of the same\r\n     proprietor, it not being in my power, under the tenure by which the\r\n     dower negroes are held, to manumit them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that, \"when Mrs. Washington learned, from the will of her\r\ndeceased husband, that the only obstacle to the immediate perfection of\r\nthis provision was her right of dower, she at once gave it up, and the\r\nslaves were made free.\" A man might possibly concentrate within himself\r\nmore real virtue and influence than ever Washington possessed, and yet he\r\nwould not be too good for such a wife.\r\n\r\nFrom the Father of his Country, we now turn to the author of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. We will listen to\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nOn the 39th and 40th pages of his Notes on Virginia, Jefferson says:--\r\n\r\n     \"There must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our\r\n     people, produced by the existence of slavery among us. The whole\r\n     commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most\r\n     boisterous passions--the most unremitting despotism on the one part,\r\n     and degrading submissions on the other. Our children see this, and\r\n     learn to imitate it; for man is an imitative animal. This quality is\r\n     the germ of all education in him. From his cradle to his grave, he is\r\n     learning to do what he sees others do. If a parent could find no\r\n     motive, either in his philanthropy or his self-love, for restraining\r\n     the intemperance of passion towards his slave, it should always be a\r\n     sufficient one that his child is present. But generally it is not\r\n     sufficient. The parent storms, the child looks on, catches the\r\n     lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller\r\n     slaves, gives a loose rein to the worst of passions; and, thus\r\n     nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be\r\n     stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy\r\n     who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such\r\n     circumstances. And with what execration should the Statesman be\r\n     loaded, who, permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the\r\n     rights of the other, transforms those into despots and these into\r\n     enemies, destroys the morals of the one part and the _amor patriae_\r\n     of the other; for if a slave can have a country in this world, it\r\n     must be any other in preference to that in which he is born to live\r\n     and labor for another; in which he must look up the faculties of his\r\n     nature, contribute, as far as depends on his individual endeavors, to\r\n     the evanishment of the human race, or entail his own miserable\r\n     condition on the endless generations proceeding from him. With the\r\n     morals of the people, their industry also is destroyed; for, in a\r\n     warm climate, no man will labor for himself who can make another\r\n     labor for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a\r\n     very small proportion, indeed, are ever seen to labor. And can the\r\n     liberties of a nation be thought secure, when we have removed their\r\n     only firm basis--a conviction in the minds of the people that these\r\n     liberties are of the gift of God? that they are not to be violated\r\n     but with his wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect\r\n     that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever; that\r\n     considering numbers, nature, and natural means only, a revolution of\r\n     the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible\r\n     events; that it may become probable by supernatural interference! The\r\n     Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a\r\n     contest.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Virginia was yet a Colony, in 1774, she held a Convention to appoint\r\ndelegates to attend the first general Congress, which was to assemble, and\r\ndid assemble, in Philadelphia, in September of the same year. Before that\r\nConvention, Mr. Jefferson made an exposition of the rights of British\r\nAmerica, in which he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"The abolition of domestic slavery is the greatest object of desire\r\n     in these Colonies, where it was unhappily introduced in their infant\r\n     State. But previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves, it is\r\n     necessary to exclude further importations from Africa. Yet our\r\n     repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions, and by imposing\r\n     duties which might amount to prohibition, have been hitherto defeated\r\n     by his Majesty's negative; thus preferring the immediate advantage of\r\n     a few African corsairs to the lasting interests of the American\r\n     States, and the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by this\r\n     infamous practice.\"\r\n\r\nIn the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, of which it is\r\nwell known he was the author, we find this charge against the King of\r\nGreat Britain:--\r\n\r\n     \"He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its\r\n     most sacred rights of life and liberty, in the persons of a distant\r\n     people who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into\r\n     slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their\r\n     transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of\r\n     infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian King of Great\r\n     Britain. Determined to keep a market where men should be bought and\r\n     sold, he has at length prostituted his negative for suppressing any\r\n     legislative attempt to prohibit and restrain this execrable\r\n     commerce.\"\r\n\r\nHear him further; he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\r\n     equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\n     unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are\r\n     instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of\r\n     the governed.\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of August 7th, 1785, in a letter to Dr. Price of London, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"Northward of the Chesapeake you may find, here and there an opponent\r\n     of your doctrine, as you may find, here and there, a robber and\r\n     murderer; but in no great number. Emancipation is put into such a\r\n     train, that in a few years there will be no slaves northward of\r\n     Maryland. In Maryland I do not find such a disposition to begin the\r\n     redress of this enormity, as in Virginia. This is the next State to\r\n     which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle of justice\r\n     in conflict with avarice and oppression; a conflict wherein the\r\n     sacred side is gaining daily recruits from the influx into office of\r\n     young men grown up, and growing up. These have sucked in the\r\n     principles of liberty, as it were, with their mother's milk; and it\r\n     is to them I look with anxiety to turn the fate of the question.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, written to a friend in 1814, he made use of the\r\nfollowing emphatic language:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your favor of July 31st was duly received, and read with peculiar\r\n     pleasure. The sentiments do honor to the head and heart of the\r\n     writer. Mine on the subject of the slavery of negroes have long since\r\n     been in the possession of the public, and time has only served to\r\n     give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of country\r\n     plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a reproach to us\r\n     that they should have pleaded it so long in vain.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"What an incomprehensible machine is man! who can endure toil,\r\n     famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself, in vindication of\r\n     his own liberty; and the next moment be deaf to all those motives\r\n     whose power supported him through his trial, and inflict on his\r\n     fellow man a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with more misery\r\n     than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the South, at the present day, especially among slaveholders,\r\nnegroes are almost invariably spoken of as \"goods and chattels,\"\r\n\"property,\" \"human cattle.\" In our first quotation from Jefferson's works,\r\nwe have seen that he spoke of the blacks as _citizens_. We shall now hear\r\nhim speak of them as _brethren_. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We must wait with patience the workings of an overruling Providence,\r\n     and hope that that is preparing the deliverance of these our\r\n     brethren. When the measure of their tears shall be full, when their\r\n     groans shall have involved Heaven itself in darkness, doubtless a God\r\n     of justice will awaken to their distress. Nothing is more certainly\r\n     written in the Book of Fate, than that this people shall be free.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to James Heaton, on this same subject, dated May 20, 1826,\r\nonly six weeks before his death, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"My sentiments have been forty years before the public. Had I\r\n     repeated them forty times, they would have only become the more stale\r\n     and threadbare. Although I shall not live to see them consummated,\r\n     they will not die with me.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Father of the Declaration of Independence, we now turn to the\r\nFather of the Constitution. We will listen to\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MADISON.\r\n\r\nAdvocating the abolition of the slave-trade, Mr. Madison said:--\r\n\r\n     \"The dictates of humanity, the principles of the people, the national\r\n     safety and happiness, and prudent policy, require it of us. It is to\r\n     be hoped, that by expressing a national disapprobation of the trade,\r\n     we may _destroy_ it, and save our country from reproaches, and our\r\n     posterity from the imbecility ever attendant on a country filled with\r\n     slaves.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is wrong to admit into the Constitution the idea that there can\r\n     be property in man.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 39th No. of \"The Federalist,\" he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The first question that offers itself is, whether the general form\r\n     and aspect of the government be strictly Republican. It is evident\r\n     that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the\r\n     people of America, and with the fundamental principles of the\r\n     Revolution, or with that honorable determination which animates every\r\n     votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the\r\n     capacity of mankind for self-government.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Federal Convention, he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"And in the third place, where slavery exists, the Republican theory\r\n     becomes still more fallacious.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have seen the mere distinction of color made, in the most\r\n     enlightened period of time, a ground of the most oppressive dominion\r\n     ever exercised by man over man.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MONROE.\r\n\r\nIn a speech in the Virginia Convention, Mr. Monroe said:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have found that this evil has preyed upon the very vitals of the\r\n     Union, and has been prejudicial to all the States, in which it has\r\n     existed.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF HENRY.\r\n\r\nThe eloquent Patrick Henry says, in a letter dated January 18, 1773:--\r\n\r\n     \"Is it not a little surprising that the professors of Christianity,\r\n     whose chief excellence consists in softening the human heart, in\r\n     cherishing and improving its finer feelings, should encourage a\r\n     practice so totally repugnant to the first impressions of right and\r\n     wrong? What adds to the wonder is, that this abominable practice has\r\n     been introduced in the most enlightened ages. Times that seem to have\r\n     pretensions to boast of high improvements in the arts and sciences,\r\n     and refined morality, have brought into general use, and guarded by\r\n     many laws, a species of violence and tyranny which our more rude and\r\n     barbarous, but more honest ancestors detested. Is it not amazing that\r\n     at a time when the rights of humanity are defined and understood with\r\n     precision, in a country above all others fond of liberty--that in\r\n     such an age and in such a country, we find men professing a religion\r\n     the most mild, humane, gentle, and generous, adopting such a\r\n     principle, as repugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent with the\r\n     Bible, and destructive to liberty? Every thinking, honest man rejects\r\n     it in speculation. How free in practice from conscientious motives!\r\n     Would any one believe that I am master of slaves of my own purchase?\r\n     I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without\r\n     them. I will not, I cannot justify it. However culpable my conduct, I\r\n     will so far pay my devoir to virtue as to own the excellence and\r\n     rectitude of her precepts, and lament my want of conformity to them.\r\n     I believe a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to\r\n     abolish this lamentable evil. Everything we can do is to improve it,\r\n     if it happens in our day; if not, let us transmit to our descendants,\r\n     together with our slaves, a pity for their unhappy lot, and an\r\n     abhorrence for slavery. If we cannot reduce this wished-for\r\n     reformation to practice, let us treat the unhappy victims with\r\n     lenity. It is the furthest advance we can make towards justice. It is\r\n     a debt we owe to the purity of our religion, to show that it is at\r\n     variance with that law which warrants slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, this great orator says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It would rejoice my very soul, that every one of my fellow-beings\r\n     was emancipated. We ought to lament and deplore the necessity of\r\n     holding our fellow-men in bondage. Believe me; I shall honor the\r\n     Quakers for their noble efforts to abolish slavery.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nThat excentric genius, John Randolph, of Roanoke, in a letter to William\r\nGibbons, in 1820, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"With unfeigned respect and regard, and as sincere a deprecation on\r\n     the extension of slavery and its horrors, as any other man, be him\r\n     whom he may, I am your friend, in the literal sense of that much\r\n     abused word. I say much abused, because it is applied to the leagues\r\n     of vice and avarice and ambition, instead of good will toward man\r\n     from love of him who is the Prince of Peace.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Congress, he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, I envy neither the heart nor the head of that man from the\r\n     North who rises here to defend slavery on principle.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that he emancipated all his negroes. The following lines\r\nfrom his will are well worth perusing and preserving:--\r\n\r\n     \"I give to my slaves their freedom, to which my conscience tells me\r\n     they are justly entitled. It has a long time been a matter of the\r\n     deepest regret to me that the circumstances under which I inherited\r\n     them, and the obstacles thrown in the way by the laws of the land,\r\n     have prevented my emancipating them in my life-time, which it is my\r\n     full intention to do in case I can accomplish it.\"\r\n\r\nTHOMAS M. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nIn an address to the Virginia Legislature, in 1820, Gov. Randolph said:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have been far outstripped by States to whom nature has been far\r\n     less bountiful. It is painful to consider what might have been, under\r\n     other circumstances, the amount of general wealth in Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, Mr. Randolph, of Albemarle, in the Legislature of Virginia, used\r\nthe following most graphic and emphatic language:--\r\n\r\n     \"I agree with gentlemen in the necessity of arming the State for\r\n     internal defence. I will unite with them in any effort to restore\r\n     confidence to the public mind, and to conduce to the sense of the\r\n     safety of our wives and our children. Yet, Sir, I must ask upon whom\r\n     is to fall the burden of this defence? Not upon the lordly masters of\r\n     their hundred slaves, who will never turn out except to retire with\r\n     their families when danger threatens. No, Sir; it is to fall upon the\r\n     less wealthy class of our citizens, chiefly upon the\r\n     non-slaveholder. I have known patrols turned out when there was not a\r\n     slaveholder among them; and this is the practice of the country. I\r\n     have slept in times of alarm quiet in bed, without having a thought\r\n     of care, while these individuals, owning none of this property\r\n     themselves, were patrolling under a compulsory process, for a\r\n     pittance of seventy-five cents per twelve hours, the very curtilage\r\n     of my house, and guarding that property which was alike dangerous to\r\n     them and myself. After all, this is but an expedient. As this\r\n     population becomes more numerous, it becomes less productive. Your\r\n     guard must be increased, until finally its profits will not pay for\r\n     the expense of its subjection. Slavery has the effect of lessening\r\n     the free population of a country.\r\n\r\n     \"The gentleman has spoken of the increase of the female slaves being\r\n     a part of the profit. It is admitted; but no great evil can be\r\n     averted, no good attained, without some inconvenience. It may be\r\n     questioned how far it is desirable to foster and encourage this\r\n     branch of profit. It is a practice, and an increasing practice, in\r\n     parts of Virginia, to rear slaves for market. How can an honorable\r\n     mind, a patriot, and a lover of his country, bear to see this Ancient\r\n     Dominion, rendered illustrious by the noble devotion and patriotism\r\n     of her sons in the cause of liberty, converted into one grand\r\n     menagerie, where men are to be reared for the market, like oxen for\r\n     the shambles? Is it better, is it not worse, than the slave\r\n     trade--that trade which enlisted the labor of the good and wise of\r\n     every creed, and every clime, to abolish it? The trader receives the\r\n     slave, a stranger in language, aspect, and manners, from the merchant\r\n     who has brought him from the interior. The ties of father, mother,\r\n     husband, and child, have all been rent in twain; before he receives\r\n     him, his soul has become callous. But here, Sir, individuals whom the\r\n     master has known from infancy, whom he has seen sporting in the\r\n     innocent gambols of childhood, who have been accustomed to look to\r\n     him for protection, he tears from the mother's arms and sells into a\r\n     strange country among strange people, subject to cruel taskmasters.\r\n\r\n     \"He has attempted to justify slavery here, because it exists in\r\n     Africa, and has stated that it exists all over the world. Upon the\r\n     same principle, he could justify Mahometanism, with its plurality of\r\n     wives, petty wars for plunder, robbery, and murder, or any other of\r\n     the abominations and enormities of savage tribes. Does slavery exist\r\n     in any part of civilized Europe? No, Sir, in no part of it.\"\r\n\r\nPEYTON RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October, 1774, while Congress was in session in\r\nPhiladelphia, Peyton Randolph, President, the following resolution, among\r\nothers, was unanimously adopted:--\r\n\r\n     \"That we will neither import nor purchase any slave imported after\r\n     the first day of December next; after which time we will wholly\r\n     discontinue the slave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it\r\n     ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or\r\n     manufactures, to those who are concerned in it.\"\r\n\r\nEDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States contains the following provision:--\r\n\r\n     \"No person held to service or labor in another State, under the laws\r\n     thereof, escaping to another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\n     regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but\r\n     shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or\r\n     labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nTo the studious attention of those vandals who contend that the above\r\nprovision requires the rendition of fugitive _slaves_, we respectfully\r\ncommend the following resolution, which, it will be observed, was\r\n_unanimously_ adopted:--\r\n\r\n     \"On motion of Mr. Randolph, the word '_servitude_' was struck out,\r\n     and '_service_' unanimously inserted--the former being thought to\r\n     express the condition of slaves, and the latter the obligation of\r\n     _free_ persons.\"--_Madison Papers, vol. III., p. 1569._\r\n\r\nWell done for the Randolphs!\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF CLAY.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay, whom everybody loved, and at the mention of whose name the\r\nAmerican heart always throbs with emotions of grateful remembrance, said,\r\nin an address before the Kentucky Colonization Society, in 1829:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is believed that nowhere in the _farming_ portion of the United\r\n     States would slave-labor be generally employed, if the proprietor\r\n     were not tempted to raise slaves by the high price of the Southern\r\n     market, which keeps it up in his own.\"\r\n\r\nIn the United States Senate, in 1850, he used the following memorable\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am extremely sorry to hear the Senator from Mississippi say that\r\n     he requires, first the extension of the Missouri Compromise line to\r\n     the Pacific, and also that he is not satisfied with that, but\r\n     requires, if I understand him correctly, a positive provision for the\r\n     admission of slavery South of that line. And now, Sir, coming from a\r\n     slave State, as I do, I owe it to myself, I owe it to truth, I owe it\r\n     to the subject to say that no earthly power could induce me to vote\r\n     for a specific measure for the introduction of slavery where it had\r\n     not before existed, either South or North of that line. Coming as I\r\n     do from a slave State, it is my solemn, deliberate and well-matured\r\n     determination that no power, no earthly power, shall compel me to\r\n     vote for the positive introduction of slavery either South or North\r\n     of that line. Sir, while you reproach, and justly too, our British\r\n     ancestors for the introduction of this institution upon the continent\r\n     of America I am, for one, unwilling that the posterity of the present\r\n     inhabitants of California and of New Mexico, shall reproach us for\r\n     doing just what we reproach Great Britain for doing to us. If the\r\n     citizens of those territories choose to establish slavery, and if\r\n     they come here with Constitutions establishing slavery, I am for\r\n     admitting them with such provisions in their Constitutions; but then\r\n     it will be their own work, and not ours, and their posterity will\r\n     have to reproach them, and not us, for forming Constitutions allowing\r\n     the institution of slavery to exist among them. These are my views,\r\n     Sir, and I choose to express them; and I care not how extensively or\r\n     universally they are known.\"\r\n\r\nHear him further; he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"So long as God allows the vital current to flow through my veins, I\r\n     will never, never, never, by word, or thought, by mind or will, aid\r\n     in admitting one rood of free territory to the everlasting curse of\r\n     human bondage.\"\r\n\r\nA bumper to the memory of noble Harry of the West!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS M. CLAY.\r\n\r\nOf the great number of good speeches made by members of the Republican\r\nparty during the late Presidential campaign, it is, we believe, pretty\r\ngenerally admitted that the best one was made by Cassius M. Clay, of\r\nKentucky, at the Tabernacle, in New-York City, on the 24th of October,\r\n1856. From the speech of that noble champion of freedom, then and there\r\ndelivered, we make the following graphic extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"If there are no manufactures, there is no commerce. In vain do the\r\n     slaveholders go to Knoxville, to Nashville, to Memphis and to\r\n     Charleston, and resolve that they will have nothing to do with these\r\n     abolition eighteen millions of Northern people; that they will build\r\n     their own vessels, manufacture their own goods, ship their own\r\n     products to foreign countries, and break down New-York, Philadelphia\r\n     and Boston! Again they resolve and reresolve, and yet there is not a\r\n     single ton more shipped and not a single article added to the wealth\r\n     of the South. But, gentlemen, they never invite such men as I am to\r\n     attend their Conventions. They know that I would tell them that\r\n     slavery is the cause of their poverty, and that I will tell them that\r\n     what they are aiming at is the dissolution of the Union--that they\r\n     may be prepared to strike for that whenever the nation rises. They\r\n     well know that by slave labor the very propositions which they make\r\n     can never be realized; yet when we show these things, they cry out,\r\n     'Oh, Cotton is King!' But when we look at the statistics, we find\r\n     that so far from Cotton being King, Grass is King. There are nine\r\n     articles of staple productions which are larger than that of cotton\r\n     in this country.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I suppose it does not follow because slavery is endeavoring to\r\n     modify the great dicta of our fathers, that cotton and free labor are\r\n     incompatible. In the extreme South, at New Orleans, the laboring\r\n     men--the stevedores and hackmen on the levee, where the heat is\r\n     intensified by the proximity of the red brick buildings, are all\r\n     white men, and they are in the full enjoyment of health. But how\r\n     about cotton? I am informed by a friend of mine--himself a\r\n     slaveholder, and therefore good authority--that in Northwestern\r\n     Texas, among the German settlements, who, true to their national\r\n     instincts, will not employ the labor of a slave--they produce more\r\n     cotton to the acre, and of a better quality, and selling at prices\r\n     from a cent to a cent and a half a pound higher than that produced by\r\n     slave labor. This is an experiment that illustrates what I have\r\n     always held, that whatever is right is expedient.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF BENTON.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Thirty Years' View,\" Thomas H. Benton says:--\r\n\r\n     \"My opposition to the extension of slavery dates further back than\r\n     1844--forty years further back; and as this is a suitable time for a\r\n     general declaration, and a sort of general conscience delivery, I\r\n     will say that my opposition to it dates from 1804, when I was a\r\n     student at law in the State of Tennessee, and studied the subject of\r\n     African slavery in an American book--a Virginia book--Tucker's\r\n     edition of Blackstone's Commentaries.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in a speech delivered in St. Louis, on the 3rd of November, 1856,\r\nhe says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I look at white people, and not at black ones; I look to the peace\r\n     and reputation of the race to which I belong. I look to the peace of\r\n     this land--the world's last hope for a free government on the earth.\r\n     One of the occasions on which I saw Henry Clay rise higher than I\r\n     thought I ever saw him before, was when in the debate on the\r\n     admission of California, a dissolution was apprehended if slavery was\r\n     not carried into this Territory, where it never was. Then Mr. Clay,\r\n     rising, loomed colossally in the Senate of the United States, as he\r\n     rose declaring that for no earthly purpose, no earthly object, could\r\n     he carry slavery into places where it did not exist before. It was a\r\n     great and proud day for Mr. Clay, towards the latter days of his\r\n     life, and if an artist could have been there to catch his expression\r\n     as he uttered that sentiment, with its reflex on his face, and his\r\n     countenance beaming with firmness of purpose, it would have been a\r\n     glorious moment in which to transmit him to posterity--his\r\n     countenance all alive and luminous with the ideas that beat in his\r\n     bosom. That was a proud day. I could have wished that I had spoken\r\n     the same words. I speak them now, telling you they were his, and\r\n     adopting them as my own.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MASON.\r\n\r\nColonel Mason, a leading and distinguished member of the Convention that\r\nformed the Constitution, from Virginia, when the provision for prohibiting\r\nthe importation of slaves was under consideration, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"The present question concerns not the importing States alone, but\r\n     the whole Union. Slavery discourages arts and manufactures. The poor\r\n     despise labor when performed by slaves. They prevent the emigration\r\n     of whites who really enrich and strengthen a country. They produce\r\n     the most pernicious effect on manners. Every master of slaves is born\r\n     a petty tyrant. They bring the judgment of Heaven on a country. As\r\n     nations cannot be rewarded or punished in the next world, they must\r\n     be in this. By an inevitable chain of causes and effects, Providence\r\n     punishes national sins by national calamities. He lamented that some\r\n     of our Eastern brethren had, from a lust of gain, embarked in this\r\n     nefarious traffic. As to the States being in possession of the right\r\n     to import, this was the case with many other rights, now to be\r\n     properly given up. He held it essential, in every point of view, that\r\n     the General Government should have power to prevent the increase of\r\n     slavery.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MCDOWELL.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, Gov. McDowell used this language in the Virginia Legislature:--\r\n\r\n     \"Who that looks to this unhappy bondage of an unhappy people, in the\r\n     midst of our society, and thinks of its incidents or issues, but\r\n     weeps over it as a curse as great upon him who inflicts as upon him\r\n     who suffers it? Sir, you may place the slave where you please--you\r\n     may dry up, to your uttermost, the fountains of his feelings, the\r\n     springs of his thought--you may close upon his mind every avenue of\r\n     knowledge, and cloud it over with artificial night--you may yoke him\r\n     to your labors, as the ox, which liveth only to work and worketh only\r\n     to live--you may put him under any process which, without destroying\r\n     his value as a slave, will debase and crush him as a rational\r\n     being--you may do this, and the idea that he was born to be free will\r\n     survive it all. It is allied to his hope of immortality--it is the\r\n     etherial part of his nature which oppression cannot rend. It is a\r\n     torch lit up in his soul by the hand of Deity, and never meant to be\r\n     extinguished by the hand of man.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF IREDELL.\r\n\r\nIn the debates of the North Carolina Convention, Mr. Iredell, afterwards a\r\nJudge of the United States Supreme Court, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"When the entire abolition of slavery takes place, it will be an\r\n     event which must be pleasing to every generous mind, and every friend\r\n     of human nature.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF PINKNEY.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pinkney, of Maryland, in the House of Delegates in that State, in\r\n1789, made several powerful arguments in favor of the abolition of\r\nslavery. Here follows a brief extract from one of his speeches:--\r\n\r\n     \"Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland, is that dreary system\r\n     of partial bondage which her laws have hitherto supported with a\r\n     solicitude worthy of a better object, and her citizens by their\r\n     practice, countenanced. Founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which\r\n     the parent country lent its fostering aid, from motives of interest,\r\n     but which even she would have disdained to encourage, had England\r\n     been the destined mart of such inhuman merchandize, its continuance\r\n     is as shameful as its origin.\r\n\r\n     I have no hope that the stream of general liberty will forever flow\r\n     unpolluted through the mire of partial bondage, or that they who have\r\n     been habituated to lord it over others, will not, in time, become\r\n     base enough to let others lord it over them. If they resist, it will\r\n     be the struggle of pride and selfishness, not of principle.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF LEIGH.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of Virginia, in 1832, Mr. Leigh said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I thought, till very lately that it was known to every body that,\r\n     during the Revolution, and for many years after, the abolition of\r\n     slavery was a favorite topic with many of our ablest Statesmen, who\r\n     entertained with respect all the schemes which wisdom or ingenuity\r\n     could suggest for its accomplishment.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MARSHALL.\r\n\r\nThomas Marshall, of Fauquier, said, in the Virginia Legislature, in\r\n1832:--\r\n\r\n     \"Wherefore, then, object to slavery? Because it is ruinous to the\r\n     whites--retards improvements, roots out an industrious population,\r\n     banishes the yeomanry of the country--deprives the spinner, the\r\n     weaver, the smith, the shoemaker, the carpenter, of employment and\r\n     support.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF BOLLING.\r\n\r\nPhilip A. Bolling, of Buckingham, a member of the Legislature of Virginia\r\nin 1832, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"The time will come--and it may be sooner than many are willing to\r\n     believe--when this oppressed and degraded race cannot be held as they\r\n     now are--when a change will be effected, abhorrent, Mr. Speaker, to\r\n     you, and to the feelings of every good man.\r\n\r\n     The wounded adder will recoil, and sting the foot that tramples upon\r\n     it. The day is fast approaching, when those who oppose all action\r\n     upon this subject, and, instead of aiding in devising some feasible\r\n     plan for freeing their country from an acknowledged curse, cry\r\n     '_impossible_,' to every plan suggested, will curse their\r\n     perverseness, and lament their folly.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler, of Norfolk, member of the Virginia Legislature, in 1832,\r\ntook occasion to say:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is admitted, by all who have addressed this House, that slavery\r\n     is a curse, and an increasing one. That it has been destructive to\r\n     the lives of our citizens, history, with unerring truth, will record.\r\n     That its future increase will create commotion, cannot be doubted.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF SUMMERS.\r\n\r\nMr. Summers, of Kanawha, member of the Legislature of Virginia, in 1832,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     \"The evils of this system cannot be enumerated. It were unnecessary\r\n     to attempt it. They glare upon us at every step. When the owner looks\r\n     to his wasted estate, he knows and feels them.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF PRESTON.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of Virginia, in 1832, Mr. Preston said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, Mr. Jefferson, whose hand drew the preamble to the Bill of\r\n     Rights, has eloquently remarked that we had invoked for ourselves the\r\n     benefit of a principle which we had denied to others. He saw and felt\r\n     that slaves, as men, were embraced within this principle.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF FREMONT.\r\n\r\nJohn Charles Fremont, one of the noblest sons of the South, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I heartily concur in all movements which have for their object to\r\n     repair the mischiefs arising from the violation of good faith in the\r\n     repeal of the Missouri Compromise. I am opposed to slavery in the\r\n     abstract, and upon principles sustained and made habitual by long\r\n     settled convictions. I am inflexibly opposed to its extension on this\r\n     continent beyond its present limits.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The great body of non-slaveholding Freemen, including those of the\r\n     South, upon whose welfare slavery is an oppression, will discover\r\n     that the power of the General Government over the Public Lands may be\r\n     beneficially exerted to advance their interests, and secure their\r\n     independence, knowing this, their suffrages will not be wanting to\r\n     maintain that authority in the Union, which is absolutely essential\r\n     to the maintenance of their own liberties, and which has more than\r\n     once indicated the purpose of disposing of the Public Lands in such a\r\n     way as would make every settler upon them a freeholder.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF BLAIR.\r\n\r\nIn an Address to the Republicans of Maryland, in 1856, Francis P. Blair\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"In every aspect in which slavery among us can be considered, it is\r\n     pregnant with difficulty. Its continuance in the States in which it\r\n     has taken root has resulted in the monopoly of the soil, to a great\r\n     extent, in the hands of the slaveholders, and the entire control of\r\n     all departments of the State Government; and yet a majority of people\r\n     in the slave States are not slave-owners. This produces an anomaly in\r\n     the principle of our free institutions, which threatens in time to\r\n     bring into subjugation to slave-owners the great body of the free\r\n     white population.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MAURY.\r\n\r\nLieut. Maury, to whom has been awarded so much well-merited praise in the\r\nworld of science, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The fact must be obvious to the far-reaching minds of our Statesmen,\r\n     that unless some means of relief be devised, some channel afforded,\r\n     by which the South can, when the time comes, get rid of the excess of\r\n     her slave population, she will be ultimately found with regard to\r\n     this institution, in the predicament of the man with the wolf by the\r\n     ears; too dangerous to hold on any longer, and equally dangerous to\r\n     let go. To our mind, the event is as certain to happen as any event\r\n     which depends on the contingencies of the future, viz.: that unless\r\n     means be devised for gradually relieving the slave States from the\r\n     undue pressure of this class upon them--unless some way be opened by\r\n     which they may be rid of their surplus black population--the time\r\n     will come--it may not be in the next nor in the succeeding\r\n     generation--but, sooner or later, come it will, and come it\r\n     must--when the two races will join in the death struggle for the\r\n     mastery.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF BIRNEY.\r\n\r\nJames G. Birney, of Kentucky, under whom the Abolitionists first became a\r\nNational Party, and for whom they voted for President in 1844, giving him\r\n66,304 votes, says:\r\n\r\n     \"We have so long practiced injustice, adding to it hypocrisy, in the\r\n     treatment of the colored race, both negroes and Indians, that we\r\n     begin to regard injustice as an element--a chief element--the chief\r\n     element of our government. But no government which admits injustice\r\n     as an element can be a harmonious one or a permanent one. Harmony is\r\n     the antagonist of injustice, ever has been, and ever will be; that\r\n     is, so long as injustice lasts, which cannot always be, for it is a\r\n     lie, a semblance, therefore, perishable. True, from the imperfection\r\n     of man, his ambition and selfishness, injustice often finds its way\r\n     incidentally into the administration of public affairs, and maintains\r\n     its footing a long time before it is cast out by the legitimate\r\n     elements of government.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Our slave States, especially the more southern of them, in which the\r\n     number of slaves is greater, and in which, of course the sentiment of\r\n     injustice is stronger than in the more northern ones, are to be\r\n     placed on the list of decaying communities. To a philosophic\r\n     observer, they seem to be falling back on the scale of civilization.\r\n     Even at the present point of retrogression, the cause of civilization\r\n     and human improvement would lose nothing by their annihilation.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF DELAWARE.\r\n\r\nStrong anti-slavery sentiment had become popular in Delaware as early as\r\n1785. With Maryland and Missouri, it may now be ranked as a semi-slave\r\nState. Mr. McLane, a member of Congress from this State in 1825, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I shall not imitate the example of other gentlemen by making\r\n     professions of my love of liberty and abhorrence of slavery, not,\r\n     however, because I do not entertain them. I am an enemy to slavery.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF MARYLAND.\r\n\r\nSlavery has little vitality in Maryland. Baltimore, the greatest city of\r\nthe South--greatest because freest--has a population of more than two\r\nhundred thousand souls, and yet less than three thousand of these are\r\nslaves. In spite of all the unjust and oppressive statutes enacted by the\r\noligarchy, the non-slaveholders, who with the exception of a small number\r\nof slaveholding emancipationists, may in truth be said to be the only\r\nclass of respectable and patriotic citizens in the South, have wisely\r\ndetermined that their noble State shall be freed from the sin and the\r\nshame, the crime and the curse of slavery; and in accordance with this\r\ndetermination, long since formed, they are giving every possible\r\nencouragement to free white labor, thereby, very properly, rendering the\r\nlabor of slaves both unprofitable and disgraceful. The formation of an\r\nAbolition Society in this State, in 1789, was the result of the influence\r\nof the masterly speeches delivered in the House of Delegates, by the Hon.\r\nWilliam Pinkney whose undying testimony we have already placed on record.\r\nNearly seventy years ago, this eminent lawyer and Statesman declared to\r\nthe people of America, that if they did not mark out the bounds of\r\nslavery, and adopt measures for its total extinction, it would finally\r\n\"work a decay of the spirit of liberty in the free States.\" Further, he\r\nsaid that, \"by the eternal principles of natural justice, no master in the\r\nState has a right to hold his slave in bondage a single hour.\" In 1787,\r\nLuther Martin, of this State, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a\r\n     tendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it\r\n     lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and habituates us\r\n     to tyranny and oppression.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing the unreserved and immortal testimony of Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, Henry, and the other great men of the Old Dominion,\r\nagainst the institution of slavery, it may to some, seem quite superfluous\r\nto back the cause of Freedom by arguments from other Virginia\r\nabolitionists; but this State, notwithstanding all her more modern manners\r\nand inhumanity, has been so prolific of just views and noble sentiments,\r\nthat we deem it eminently fit and proper to blazon many of them to the\r\nworld as the redeeming features of her history. An Abolition Society was\r\nformed in this State in 1791. In a memorial which the members of this\r\nSociety presented to Congress, they pronounced slavery \"not only an odious\r\ndegradation, but an outrageous violation of one of the most essential\r\nrights of human nature, and utterly repugnant to the precepts of the\r\nGospel.\" A Bill of Rights, unanimously agreed upon by the Virginia\r\nConvention of June 12, 1776, holds--\r\n\r\n     \"That all men are, by nature, equally free and independent;\r\n\r\n     That Government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common\r\n     benefit, protection, and security, of the People, Nation, or\r\n     Community;\r\n\r\n     That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people\r\n     in assembly ought to be free;\r\n\r\n     That all men having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest\r\n     with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage,\r\n     and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property, for public uses,\r\n     without their own consent or that of their representatives so\r\n     elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not in like manner\r\n     assented, for the public good;\r\n\r\n     That the freedom of the Press is one of the greatest bulwarks of\r\n     Liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic Governments;\r\n\r\n     That no free Government or the blessing of Liberty can be preserved\r\n     to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation,\r\n     temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by a frequent recurrence to\r\n     fundamental principles.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Virginia Society for the Abolition of Slavery,\" organized in 1791,\r\naddressed Congress in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your memorialists, fully aware that righteousness exalteth a nation,\r\n     and that slavery is not only an odious degradation, but an outrageous\r\n     violation of one of the most essential rights of human nature, and\r\n     utterly repugnant to the precepts of the gospel, which breathes\r\n     'peace on earth and good will to men,' lament that a practice so\r\n     inconsistent with true policy and the inalienable rights of men,\r\n     should subsist in so enlightened an age, and among a people\r\n     professing that all mankind are, by nature, equally entitled to\r\n     freedom.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nIf the question, _slavery_ or _no slavery_, could be fairly presented for\r\nthe decision of the legal voters of North Carolina at the next popular\r\nelection, we believe at least two-thirds of them would deposite the _no\r\nslavery_ ticket. Perhaps one-fourth of the slaveholders themselves would\r\nvote it, for the slaveholders in this State are more moderate, decent,\r\nsensible, and honorable, than the slaveholders in either of the adjoining\r\nStates, or the States further South; and we know that many of them are\r\nheartily ashamed of the vile occupations of slaveholding and\r\nslave-breeding in which they are engaged, for we have the assurance from\r\ntheir own lips. As a matter of course, all the non-slaveholders, who are\r\nso greatly in the majority, would vote to suppress the degrading\r\ninstitution which has kept them so long in poverty and ignorance, with the\r\nexception of those who are complete automatons to the beck and call of\r\ntheir imperious lords and masters, the major-generals of the oligarchy.\r\n\r\nHow long shall it be before the citizens of North Carolina shall have the\r\nprivilege of expressing, at the ballot-box, their true sentiments with\r\nregard to this vexed question? Why not decide it at the next general\r\nelection? Sooner or later, it must and will be decided--decided correctly,\r\ntoo--and the sooner the better. The first Southern State that abolishes\r\nslavery will do herself an immortal honor. God grant that North Carolina\r\nmay be that State, and soon! There is at least one plausible reason why\r\nthis good old State should be the first to move in this important matter,\r\nand we will state it. On the 20th of May, 1775, just one year one month\r\nand fourteen days prior to the adoption of the Jeffersonian Declaration of\r\nIndependence, by the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776,\r\nthe Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, the authorship of which is\r\ngenerally attributed to Ephraim Brevard, was proclaimed in Charlotte,\r\nMecklenburg county, North Carolina, and fully ratified in a second\r\nConvention of the people of said county, held on the 31st of the same\r\nmonth. And here, by the way, we may remark, that it is supposed Mr.\r\nJefferson made use of this last-mentioned document as the basis of his\r\ndraft of the indestructible title-deed of our liberties. There is\r\ncertainly an identicalness of language between the two papers that is well\r\ncalculated to strengthen this hypothesis. This, however, is a controversy\r\nabout which we are but little concerned. For present purposes, it is,\r\nperhaps, enough for us to know, that on the 20th of May, 1775, when\r\ntransatlantic tyranny and oppression could no longer be endured, North\r\nCarolina set her sister colonies a most valorous and praiseworthy example,\r\nand that they followed it. To her infamous slaveholding sisters of the\r\nSouth, it is now meet that she should set another noble example of\r\ndecency, virtue, and independence. Let her at once inaugurate a policy of\r\ncommon justice and humanity--enact a system of equitable laws, having due\r\nregard to the rights and interests of all classes of persons, poor whites,\r\nnegroes, and nabobs, and the surrounding States will ere long applaud her\r\nmeasures, and adopt similar ones for the governance of themselves.\r\n\r\nAnother reason, and a cogent one, why North Carolina should aspire to\r\nbecome the first free State of the South is this: The first slave State\r\nthat makes herself respectable by casting out \"the mother of harlots,\" and\r\nby rendering enterprise and industry honorable, will immediately receive\r\na large accession of most worthy citizens from other States in the Union,\r\nand thus lay a broad foundation of permanent political power and\r\nprosperity. Intelligent white farmers from the Middle and New England\r\nStates will flock to our more congenial clime, eager to give thirty\r\ndollars per acre for the same lands that are now a drug in the market\r\nbecause nobody wants them at the rate of five dollars per acre; an\r\nimmediate and powerful impetus will be given to commerce, manufactures,\r\nand all the industrial arts; science and literature will be revived, and\r\nevery part of the State will reverberate with the triumphs of manual and\r\nintellectual labor.\r\n\r\nAt this present time, we of North Carolina are worth less than either of\r\nthe four adjoining States; let us abolish slavery at the beginning of the\r\nnext regular decade of years, and if our example is not speedily followed,\r\nwe shall, on or before the first day of January, 1870, be enabled to\r\npurchase the whole of Virginia and South Carolina, including, perhaps, the\r\ngreater part of Georgia. An exclusive lease of liberty for ten years would\r\nunquestionably make us the Empire State of the South. But we have no\r\ndisposition to debar others from the enjoyment of liberty or any other\r\ninalienable right; we ask no special favors; what we demand for ourselves\r\nwe are willing to concede to our neighbors. Hereby we make application for\r\na lease of freedom for ten years; shall we have it? May God enable us to\r\nsecure it, as we believe He will. We give fair notice, however, that if we\r\nget it for ten years, we shall, with the approbation of Heaven, keep it\r\ntwenty--forty--a thousand--forever!\r\n\r\nWe transcribe the Mecklenburg Resolutions, which, it will be observed,\r\nacknowledge the \"inherent and inalienable rights of man,\" and \"declare\r\nourselves a free and independent people, are, and of right ought to be, a\r\nsovereign and self-governing association, under the control of no power\r\nother than that of our God, and the general government of the Congress.\"\r\n\r\nMECKLENBURG DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,\r\n\r\nAs proclaimed in the town of Charlotte, North Carolina, May 20th, 1775,\r\nand ratified by the County of Mecklenburg, in Convention, May 31st, 1775.\r\n\r\n     \"I. _Resolved_--That whosoever, directly or indirectly, abetted, or\r\n     in any way, form or manner, countenanced the unchartered and\r\n     dangerous invasion of our rights as claimed by Great Britain, is an\r\n     enemy to this country, to America, and to the inherent and\r\n     inalienable rights of man.\r\n\r\n     \"II. _Resolved_--That we the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do\r\n     hereby dissolve the political bands which have connected us to the\r\n     mother country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to\r\n     the British Crown, and abjure all political connection, contract or\r\n     association with that nation, who have wantonly trampled on our\r\n     rights and liberties, and inhumanly shed the blood of American\r\n     patriots at Lexington.\r\n\r\n     \"III. _Resolved_--That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and\r\n     independent people, are, and of right ought to be, a sovereign and\r\n     self-governing association, under the control of no power other than\r\n     that of our God, and the general government of the Congress; to the\r\n     maintenance of which independence, we solemnly pledge to each other\r\n     our mutual co-operation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred\r\n     honor.\r\n\r\n     \"IV. _Resolved_--That as we now acknowledge the existence and control\r\n     of no law or legal officer, civil or military, within this county, we\r\n     do hereby ordain and adopt, as a rule of life, all, each, and every\r\n     of our former laws--wherein, nevertheless, the crown of Great Britain\r\n     never can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immunities or\r\n     authority therein.\"\r\n\r\nHad it not been for slavery, which, with all its other blighting and\r\ndegrading influences, stifles and subdues every noble impulse of the\r\nheart, this consecrated spot would long since have been marked by an\r\nenduring monument, whose grand proportions should bear witness that the\r\nvirtues of a noble ancestry are gratefully remembered by an emulous and\r\nappreciative posterity. Yet, even as things are, we are not without\r\ngenuine consolation. The star of hope and promise is beginning to beam\r\nbrightly over the long-obscured horizon of the South; and we are firm in\r\nthe belief, that freedom, wealth, and magnanimity, will soon do justice to\r\nthe memory of those fearless patriots, whose fair fame has been suffered\r\nto moulder amidst the multifarious abominations of slavery, poverty,\r\nignorance and grovelling selfishness.\r\n\r\nJudge Iredell's testimony, which will be found on a preceding page, and to\r\nwhich we request the reader to recur, might have been appropriately\r\nintroduced under our present heading.\r\n\r\nIn the Provincial Convention held in North Carolina, in August, 1774, in\r\nwhich there were sixty-nine delegates, representing nearly every county in\r\nthe province, it was--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_--That we will not import any slave or slaves, or purchase\r\n     any slave or slaves imported or brought into the Province by others,\r\n     from any part of the world, after the first day of November next.\"\r\n\r\nIn Iredell's Statutes, revised by Martin, it is stated that,\r\n\r\n     \"In North Carolina, no general law at all was passed, prior to the\r\n     revolution, declaring who might be slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThat there is no _legal_ slavery in the Southern States, and that slavery\r\nno where can be legalized, any more than theft, arson or murder can be\r\nlegalized, has been virtually admitted by some of the most profound\r\nSouthern jurists themselves; and we will here digress so far as to furnish\r\nthe testimony of one or two eminent lawyers, not of North Carolina, upon\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nIn the debate in the United States Senate, in 1850, on the Fugitive Slave\r\nBill, Mr. Mason, of Virginia, objected to Mr. Dayton's amendment,\r\nproviding for a trial by jury, because, said he:--\r\n\r\n     \"A trial by jury necessarily carries with it a trial of the whole\r\n     right, and a trial of the right to service will be gone into,\r\n     according to all the forms of the Court, in determining upon any\r\n     other fact. Then, again, it is proposed, as a part of the proof to be\r\n     adduced at the hearing, after the fugitive has been re-captured, that\r\n     evidence shall be brought by the claimant to show that slavery is\r\n     established in the State from which the fugitive has absconded. Now\r\n     this very thing, in a recent case in the city of New-York, was\r\n     required by one of the judges of that State, which case attracted the\r\n     attention of the authorities of Maryland, and against which they\r\n     protested. In that case the State judge went so far as to say that\r\n     the only mode of proving it was by reference to the Statute book.\r\n     Such proof is required in the Senator's amendment; and if he means by\r\n     this that proof shall be brought that slavery is established by\r\n     existing laws, it is impossible to comply with the requisition, for\r\n     no such law can be produced, I apprehend, in any of the slave States.\r\n     I am not aware that there is a single State in which the institution\r\n     is established by positive law.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Clarke, of Mississippi, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In this State the legislature have considered slaves as reasonable\r\n     and accountable beings; and it would be a stigma upon the character\r\n     of the State, and a reproach to the administration of justice, if the\r\n     life of a slave could be taken with impunity, or if he could be\r\n     murdered in cold blood, without subjecting the offender to the\r\n     highest penalty known to the criminal jurisprudence of the country.\r\n     Has the slave no rights, because he is deprived of his freedom? He is\r\n     still a human being, and possesses all those rights of which he is\r\n     not deprived by the positive provisions of the law. The right of the\r\n     master exists not by force of the law of nature or nations, but by\r\n     virtue only of the positive law of the State.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Judge Ruffin, of North Carolina, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Arguments drawn from the well-established principles, which confer\r\n     and restrain the authority of the parent over the child, the tutor\r\n     over the pupil, the master over the apprentice, have been pressed on\r\n     us. The Court does not recognize their application; there is no\r\n     likeness between the cases; they are in opposition to each other, and\r\n     there is an impassable gulf between them. The difference is that\r\n     which exists between freedom and slavery, and a greater cannot be\r\n     imagined. In the one, the end in view is the happiness of the youth,\r\n     born to equal rights with that governor on whom the duty devolves of\r\n     training the young to usefulness, in a station which he is afterwards\r\n     to assume among freemen. To such an end, and with such a subject,\r\n     moral and intellectual instruction seem the natural means, and, for\r\n     the most part, they are found to suffice. Moderate force is\r\n     superadded only to make the others effectual. If that fail, it is\r\n     better to leave the party to his own headstrong passions, and the\r\n     ultimate correction of the law, than to allow it to be immoderately\r\n     inflicted by a private person. With slavery it is far otherwise. The\r\n     end is the profit of the master, his security, and the public safety;\r\n     the subject, one doomed, in his own person and his posterity, to live\r\n     without knowledge, and without the capacity to make anything his own,\r\n     and to toil that another may reap the fruits. What moral\r\n     considerations shall be addressed to such a being to convince him,\r\n     what it is impossible but that the most stupid must feel and know can\r\n     never be true, that he is thus to labor upon a principle of natural\r\n     duty, or for the sake of his own personal happiness? Such services\r\n     can only be expected from one who has no will of his own; who\r\n     surrenders his will in implicit obedience to that of another. Such\r\n     obedience is the consequence only of uncontrolled authority over the\r\n     body. There is nothing else which can operate to produce the effect.\r\n     The power of the master must be absolute to render the submission of\r\n     the slave perfect. I most freely confess my sense of the harshness of\r\n     this proposition. I feel it as deeply as any man can; and as a\r\n     principle of moral right, every person in his retirement must\r\n     repudiate it.\"\r\n\r\nAn esteemed friend, a physician, who was born and bred in Rowan county,\r\nNorth Carolina, and who now resides there, informs us that Judge Gaston,\r\nwho was one of the half dozen Statesmen whom the South has produced since\r\nthe days of the venerable fathers of the Republic, was an avowed\r\nabolitionist, and that he published an address to the people of North\r\nCarolina, delineating, in a masterly manner, the material, moral, and\r\nsocial disadvantages of slavery. Where is that address? Has it been\r\nsuppressed by the oligarchy? The fact that slaveholders have, from time to\r\ntime, made strenuous efforts to expunge the sentiments of freedom which\r\nnow adorn the works of nobler men than the noble Gaston, may, perhaps,\r\nfully account for the oblivious state into which his patriotic address\r\nseems to have fallen.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nPoor South Carolina! Folly is her nightcap; fanaticism is her day-dream;\r\nfire-eating is her pastime. She has lost her better judgment; the\r\ndictates of reason and philosophy have no influence upon her actions. Like\r\nthe wife who is pitiably infatuated with a drunken, worthless husband, she\r\nstill clings, with unabated love, to the cause of her shame, her misery,\r\nand her degradation.\r\n\r\nA Kentuckian has recently expressed his opinion of this State in the\r\nfollowing language:--\r\n\r\n     \"South Carolina is bringing herself irrecoverably in the public\r\n     contempt. It is impossible for any impartial lover of his country,\r\n     for any just thinking man, to witness her senseless and quenchless\r\n     malignancy against the Union without the most immeasurable disgust\r\n     and scorn. She is one vast hot-bed of disunion. Her people think and\r\n     talk of nothing else. She is a festering mass of treason.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1854, there were assessed for taxation in\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA,\r\n\r\n  Acres of Land                    17,289,359\r\n  Valued at                       $22,836,374\r\n  Average value per acre                $1,32\r\n\r\nAt the same time there were in\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY,\r\n\r\n  Acres of Land,                      324,800\r\n  Valued at                      $153,161,619\r\n  Average value per acre               $28,76\r\n\r\nWe hope the Slavocrats will look, first on that picture, and then on this;\r\nfrom one or the other, or both, they may glean a ray or two of wisdom,\r\nwhich, if duly applied, will be of incalculable advantage to them and\r\ntheir posterity. We trust, also, that the non-slaveholding whites will\r\nview, with discriminating minds, the different lights and shades of these\r\ntwo pictures; they are the parties most deeply interested; and it is to\r\nthem we look for the glorious revolution that is to substitute Freedom for\r\nSlavery. They have the power to retrieve the fallen fortunes of South\r\nCarolina, to raise her up from the loathsome sink of iniquity into which\r\nslavery has plunged her, and to make her one of the most brilliant stars\r\nin the great constellation of States. While their minds are occupied with\r\nother considerations, let them not forget the difference between\r\n_twenty-eight dollars and seventy-six cents_, the value of land per acre\r\nin New Jersey, which is a second-rate free State, and _one dollar and\r\nthirty-two cents_, the value of land per acre in South Carolina, which is,\r\n_par excellence_, the model slave State. The difference between the two\r\nsums is twenty-seven dollars and forty-four cents, which would amount to\r\nprecisely two thousand seven hundred and forty-four dollars on every\r\nhundred acres. To present the subject in another form, the South Carolina\r\ntract of land, containing two hundred acres, is worth now only two hundred\r\nand sixty-four dollars, and is depreciating every day. Let slavery be\r\nabolished, and in the course of a few years, the same tract will be worth\r\nfive thousand seven hundred and fifty-two dollars, with an upward\r\ntendency. At this rate, the increment of value on the total area of the\r\nState will amount to more than three times as much as the present\r\nestimated value of the slaves!\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has not always been, nor will she always continue to be, on\r\nthe wrong side. From Ramsay's History of the State, we learn that, in\r\n1774, she--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_--That His Majesty's subjects in North America (without\r\n     respect to color or other accidents) are entitled to all the inherent\r\n     rights and liberties of his natural born subjects within the Kingdom\r\n     of Great Britain; that it is their fundamental right, that no man\r\n     should suffer in his person or property without a fair trial, and\r\n     judgment given by his peers, or by the law of the land.\"\r\n\r\nOne of her early writers, under the _non de plume_ of Philodemus, in a\r\npolitical pamphlet published in Charleston in 1784, declares that--\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the fatal influence of slavery on the human mind, that it\r\n     almost wholly effaces from it even the boasted characteristic of\r\n     rationality.\"\r\n\r\nThis same writer, speaking of the particular interests of South Carolina,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"It has been too common with us to search the records of other\r\n     nations, to find precedents that may give sanction to our own errors,\r\n     and lead us unwarily into confusion and ruin. It is our business to\r\n     consult their histories, not with a view to tread right or wrong in\r\n     their steps, but in order to investigate the real sources of the\r\n     mischiefs that have befallen them, and to endeavor to escape the\r\n     rocks which they have all unfortunately split upon. It is paying\r\n     ourselves but a poor compliment, to say that we are incapable of\r\n     profiting by others, and that, with all the information which is to\r\n     be derived from their fatal experience, it is in vain for us to\r\n     attempt to excel them. If, with all the peculiar advantages of our\r\n     present situation, we are incapable of surpassing our predecessors,\r\n     we must be a degenerate race indeed, and quite unworthy of those\r\n     singular bounties of Heaven, which we are so unskilled or undesirous\r\n     to turn to our benefit.\"\r\n\r\nA recent number of Frazer's Magazine contains a well-timed and\r\nwell-written article from the pen of Wm. Henry Hurlbut, of this State;\r\nand from it we make the following extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"As all sagacious observers of the operation of the system of slavery\r\n     have demonstrated, the profitable employment of slave-labor is\r\n     inconsistent with the development of agricultural science, and\r\n     demands a continual supply of new and unexhausted soil. The\r\n     slaveholder, investing his capital in the purchase of the laborers\r\n     themselves, and not merely in soil and machines, paying his free\r\n     laborers out of the profit, must depend for his continued and\r\n     progressive prosperity upon the cheapness and facility with which he\r\n     can transfer his slaves to fresh and fertile lands. An enormous\r\n     additional item, namely, the price of slaves, being added to the cost\r\n     of production, all other elements of that cost require to be\r\n     proportionably smaller, or profits fail.\"\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered before the South Carolina Institute, in\r\nCharleston, Nov. 20th, 1856, Mr. B. F. Perry, of Greenville, truthfully\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"It has been South Carolina's misfortune, in this utilitarian age, to\r\n     have her greatest talents and most powerful energies directed to\r\n     pursuits, which avail her nothing, in the way of wealth and\r\n     prosperity. In the first settlement of a new country, agricultural\r\n     industry necessarily absorbs all the time and occupation of its\r\n     inhabitants. They must clear the forests and cultivate the earth, in\r\n     order to make their bread. This is their first consideration. Then\r\n     the mechanical arts, and manufactures, and commerce, must follow in\r\n     the footsteps of agriculture, to insure either individual or national\r\n     prosperity. No people can be highly prosperous without them. No\r\n     people ever have been. Agriculture, alone, will not make or sustain a\r\n     great people. The true policy of every people is to cultivate the\r\n     earth, manufacture its products, and send them abroad, in exchange\r\n     for those comforts and luxuries, and necessaries, which their own\r\n     country and their own industry cannot give or make. The dependence of\r\n     South Carolina on Europe and the Northern States for all the\r\n     necessaries, comforts and luxuries, which the mechanic arts afford,\r\n     has, in fact, drained her of her wealth, and made her positively\r\n     poor, when compared with her sister States of the Confederacy. It is\r\n     at once mortifying and alarming, to see and reflect on our own\r\n     dependence in the mechanic arts and manufactures, on strangers and\r\n     foreigners. In the Northern States their highest talents and energy\r\n     have been diversified, and more profitably employed in developing the\r\n     resources of the country, in making new inventions in the mechanic\r\n     arts, and enriching the community with science and literature,\r\n     commerce and manufactures.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nOf the States strictly Southern, Georgia is, perhaps, the most thrifty.\r\nThis prosperous condition of the State is mainly ascribable to her hundred\r\nthousand free white laborers--more than eighty-three thousand of whom are\r\nengaged in agricultural pursuits. In few other slave States are the\r\nnon-slaveholders so little under the domination of the oligarchy. At best,\r\nhowever, even in the most liberal slave States, the social position of the\r\nnon-slaveholding whites is but one short step in advance of that of the\r\nnegroes; and as there is, on the part of the oligarchy, a constantly\r\nincreasing desire and effort to usurp greater power, the more we\r\ninvestigate the subject the more fully are we convinced that nothing but\r\nthe speedy and utter annihilation of slavery from the entire nation, can\r\nsave the masses of white people in the Southern States from ultimately\r\nfalling to a political level with the blacks--both occupying the most\r\nabject and galling condition of servitude of which it is possible for the\r\nhuman mind to conceive.\r\n\r\nGen. Oglethorpe, under whose management the Colony of Georgia was\r\nsettled, in 1733, was bitterly opposed to the institution of slavery. In a\r\nletter to Granville Sharp, dated Oct. 13th, 1776, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"My friends and I settled the Colony of Georgia, and by charter were\r\n     established trustees, to make laws, &c. We determined not to suffer\r\n     slavery there. But the slave merchants and their adherents occasioned\r\n     us not only much trouble, but at last got the then government to\r\n     favor them. We would not suffer slavery, (which is against the\r\n     Gospel, as well as the fundamental law of England,) to be authorized\r\n     under our authority; we refused, as trustees, to make a law\r\n     permitting such a horrid crime. The government, finding the trustees\r\n     resolved firmly not to concur with what they believed unjust, took\r\n     away the charter by which no law could be passed without our\r\n     consent.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, 1775, in indorsing the proceedings of the first\r\nAmerican Congress, among other resolutions, \"the Representatives of the\r\nextensive District of Darien, in the Colony of Georgia\" adopted the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n     \"5. To show the world that we are not influenced by any contracted or\r\n     interested motives, but a general philanthropy for all mankind, of\r\n     whatever climate, language, or complexion, we hereby declare our\r\n     disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural practice of slavery in\r\n     America, (however the uncultivated state of our country or other\r\n     specious arguments may plead for it,) a practice founded in injustice\r\n     and cruelty, and highly dangerous to our liberties, (as well as\r\n     lives,) debasing part of our fellow creatures below men, and\r\n     corrupting the virtue and morals of the rest; and is laying the basis\r\n     of that liberty we contend for, (and which we pray the Almighty to\r\n     continue to the latest posterity,) upon a very wrong foundation. We\r\n     therefore resolve, at all times, to use our utmost endeavors for the\r\n     manumission of our slaves in this Colony, upon the most safe and\r\n     equitable footing for the masters and themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Mr. Reid, of this State, in a speech delivered in Congress, Feb.\r\n1, 1820, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am not the panegyrist of slavery. It is an unnatural state, a dark\r\n     cloud, which obscures half the lustre of our free institutions. For\r\n     my own part, though surrounded by slavery from my cradle to the\r\n     present moment, yet--\r\n\r\n          'I hate the touch of servile hands,\r\n          I loathe the slaves who cringe around.'\"\r\n\r\nAs an accompaniment to those lines, he might have uttered these:--\r\n\r\n  \"I would not have a slave to till my ground;\r\n  To carry me, to fan me while I sleep\r\n  And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth\r\n  That sinews bought and sold have ever earned.\"\r\n\r\nThus have we presented a comprehensive summary of the most unequivocal and\r\nirrefragable testimony of the South against the iniquitous institution of\r\nhuman slavery. What more can we say? What more can we do? We might fill a\r\nfolio volume with similar extracts; but we must forego the task; the\r\nremainder of our space must be occupied with other arguments. In the\r\nforegoing excerpts is revealed to us, in language too plain to be\r\nmisunderstood, the important fact that every truly great and good man the\r\nSouth has ever produced, has, with hopeful confidence, looked forward to\r\nthe time when this entire continent shall be redeemed from the crime and\r\nthe curse of slavery. Our noble self-sacrificing forefathers have\r\nperformed their part, and performed it well. They have laid us a\r\nfoundation as enduring as the earth itself; in their dying moments they\r\nadmonished us to carry out their designs in the upbuilding and completion\r\nof the superstructure. Let us obey their patriotic injunctions.\r\n\r\nFrom each of the six original Southern States we have introduced the most\r\nardent aspirations for liberty--the most positive condemnations of\r\nslavery. From each of the nine slave States which have been admitted into\r\nthe Union since the organization of the General Government, we could\r\nintroduce, from several of their wisest and best citizens, anti-slavery\r\nsentiments equally as strong and convincing as those that emanated from\r\nthe great founders of our movement--Washington, Jefferson, Madison,\r\nPatrick Henry and the Randolphs. As we have already remarked, however, the\r\nlimits of this chapter will not admit of the introduction of additional\r\ntestimony from either of the old or of the new slave States.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not fail to observe that, in presenting these solid\r\nabolition doctrines of the South, we have been careful to make such\r\nquotations as triumphantly refute, in every particular, the more specious\r\nsophistries of the oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the illustrious names above, reminds us of the fact, that\r\nthe party newspapers, whose venal columns are eternally teeming with\r\nvituperation and slander, have long assured us that the Whig ship was to\r\nbe steered by the Washington rudder, that the Democratic barque was to\r\nsail with the Jefferson compass, and that the Know-Nothing brig was to\r\ncarry the Madison chart. Imposed upon by these monstrous falsehoods, we\r\nhave, from time to time, been induced to engage passage on each of these\r\ncorrupt and rickety old hulks; but, in every instance, we have been basely\r\nswamped in the sea of slavery, and are alone indebted for our lives to the\r\nkindness of Heaven and the art of swimming. Washington the founder of the\r\nWhig party! Jefferson the founder of the Democratic party! Voltaire the\r\nfounder of Christianity! God forbid that man's heart should always\r\ncontinue to be the citadel of deception--that he should ever be to others\r\nthe antipode of what he is to himself.\r\n\r\nThere is now in this country but one party that promises, in good faith,\r\nto put in practice the principles of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and\r\nthe other venerable Fathers of the Republic--the Republican party. To this\r\nparty we pledge unswerving allegiance, so long as it shall continue to\r\npursue the statism advocated by the great political prototypes\r\nabove-mentioned, but no longer. We believe it is, as it ought to be, the\r\ndesire, the determination, and the destiny of this party, to give the\r\ndeath-blow to slavery; should future developments prove the party at\r\nvariance with this belief--a belief, by the bye, which it has recently\r\ninspired in the breasts of little less than one and a half millions of the\r\nmost intelligent and patriotic voters in America--we shall shake off the\r\ndust of our feet against it, and join one that will, in a summary manner,\r\nextirpate the intolerable grievance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best evidence that can be given of the enlightened patriotism and love\r\nof liberty in the Free States, is the fact that, at the Presidential\r\nelection in 1856, they polled thirteen hundred thousand votes for the\r\nRepublican candidate, JOHN C. FREMONT. This fact of itself seems to\r\npreclude the necessity of strengthening our cause with the individual\r\ntestimony of even their greatest men. Having, however, adduced the most\r\ncogent and conclusive anti-slavery arguments from the Washingtons, the\r\nJeffersons, the Madisons, the Randolphs, and the Clays of the South, we\r\nshall now proceed to enrich our pages with gems of Liberty from the\r\nFranklins, the Hamiltons, the Jays, the Adamses, and the Websters of the\r\nNorth. Too close attention cannot be paid to the words of wisdom which we\r\nhave extracted from the works of these truly eminent and philosophic\r\nStatesmen. We will first listen to\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin was the first president of \"The Pennsylvania Society for\r\npromoting the Abolition of Slavery;\" and it is now generally conceded\r\nthat this was the first regularly organized American abolition Society--it\r\nhaving been formed as early as 1774, while we were yet subjects of the\r\nBritish government. In 1790, in the name and on behalf of this Society,\r\nDr. Franklin, who was then within a few months of the close of his life,\r\ndrafted a memorial \"to the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States,\" in which he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your memorialists, particularly engaged in attending to the\r\n     distresses arising from slavery, believe it to be their indispensable\r\n     duty to present this subject to your notice. They have observed, with\r\n     real satisfaction, that many important and salutary powers are vested\r\n     in you, for 'promoting the welfare and securing the blessings of\r\n     liberty to the people of the United States;' and as they conceive\r\n     that these blessings ought rightfully to be administered, without\r\n     distinction of color, to all descriptions of people, so they indulge\r\n     themselves in the pleasing expectation that nothing which can be done\r\n     for the relief of the unhappy objects of their care, will be either\r\n     omitted or delayed.\r\n\r\n     \"From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally the portion, and\r\n     is still the birthright of all men, and influenced by the strong ties\r\n     of humanity and the principles of their institution, your\r\n     memorialists conceive themselves bound to use all justifiable\r\n     endeavors to loosen the bonds of slavery, and promote a general\r\n     enjoyment of the blessings of freedom. Under these impressions, they\r\n     earnestly entreat your attention to the subject of slavery; that you\r\n     will be pleased to countenance the restoration to liberty of those\r\n     unhappy men, who, alone, in this land of freedom, are degraded into\r\n     perpetual bondage, and who, amid the general joy of surrounding\r\n     freemen, are groaning in servile subjection; that you will devise\r\n     means for removing this inconsistency of character from the American\r\n     people; that you will promote mercy and justice towards this\r\n     distressed race; and that you will step to the very verge of the\r\n     power vested in you for discouraging every species of traffic in the\r\n     persons of our fellow-men.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, he says:--\"Slavery is an atrocious debasement of\r\nhuman nature.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton, the brilliant Statesman and financier, tells us\r\nthat:--\r\n\r\n     \"The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old\r\n     parchments or musty records. They are written as with a sunbeam, in\r\n     the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the Divinity itself,\r\n     and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1774, addressing himself to an American Tory, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The fundamental source of all your errors, sophisms, and false\r\n     reasonings, is a total ignorance of the natural rights of mankind.\r\n     Were you once to become acquainted with these, you could never\r\n     entertain a thought, that all men are not, by nature, entitled to\r\n     equal privileges. You would be convinced that natural liberty is the\r\n     gift of the beneficent Creator to the whole human race; and that\r\n     civil liberty is founded on that.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF JAY.\r\n\r\nJohn Jay, first Chief Justice of the United States under the Constitution\r\nof 1789, in a letter to the Hon. Elias Boudinot, dated Nov. 17, 1819,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"Little can be added to what has been said and written on the subject\r\n     of slavery. I concur in the opinion that it ought not to be\r\n     introduced nor permitted in any of the new States, and that it ought\r\n     to be gradually diminished and finally abolished in all of them.\r\n\r\n     \"To me, the constitutional authority of the Congress to prohibit the\r\n     migration and importation of slaves into any of the States does not\r\n     appear questionable.\r\n\r\n     \"The first article of the Constitution specifies the legislative\r\n     powers committed to the Congress. The 9th section of that article has\r\n     these words: 'The _migration_ or _importation_ of such persons as any\r\n     of the _now-existing_ States shall think proper to admit, shall not\r\n     be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808, but a tax or\r\n     duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars\r\n     for each person.'\r\n\r\n     \"I understand the sense and meaning of this clause to be, that the\r\n     power of the congress, although competent to prohibit such migration\r\n     and importation, was to be exercised with respect to the _then_\r\n     existing States, and them only, until the year 1808, but the Congress\r\n     were at liberty to make such prohibitions as to any _new_ State,\r\n     which might in the _mean_ time be established. And further, that from\r\n     and after _that_ period, they were authorized to make such\r\n     prohibitions as to _all_ the States, whether _new_ or _old_.\r\n\r\n     \"It will, I presume, be admitted, that slaves were the persons\r\n     intended. The word slaves was avoided, probably on account of the\r\n     existing toleration of slavery, and its discordancy with the\r\n     principles of the Revolution, and from a consciousness of its being\r\n     repugnant to the following positions in the Declaration of\r\n     Independence: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men\r\n     are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\n     certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and\r\n     the pursuit of happiness.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a previous letter, written from Spain, whither he had been appointed as\r\nminister plenipotentiary, he says, speaking of the abolition of slavery:--\r\n\r\n     \"Till America comes into this measure, her prayers to Heaven will be\r\n     impious. This is a strong expression, but it is just. I believe that\r\n     God governs the world, and I believe it to be a maxim in His, as in\r\n     our Courts, that those who ask for equity ought to do it.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JAY.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Wm. Jay, a noble son of Chief Justice John Jay, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"A crisis has arrived in which we must maintain our rights, or\r\n     surrender them for ever. I speak not to abolitionists alone, but to\r\n     all who value the liberty our fathers achieved. Do you ask what we\r\n     have to do with slavery? Let our muzzled presses answer--let the mobs\r\n     excited against us by the merchants and politicians answer--let the\r\n     gag laws threatened by our governors and legislatures answer, let the\r\n     conduct of the National Government answer.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF ADAMS.\r\n\r\nFrom the Diary of John Quincy Adams, \"the old man eloquent,\" we make the\r\nfollowing extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is among the evils of slavery, that it taints the very sources of\r\n     moral principle. It establishes false estimates of virtue and vice;\r\n     for what can be more false and more heartless than this doctrine,\r\n     which makes the first and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon\r\n     the color of the skin? It perverts human reason, and induces men\r\n     endowed with logical powers to maintain that slavery is sanctioned by\r\n     the Christian religion; that slaves are happy and contented in their\r\n     condition; that between master and slave there are ties of mutual\r\n     attachment and affection; that the virtues of the master are refined\r\n     and exalted by the degradation of the slave, while at the same time\r\n     they vent execrations upon the slave-trade, curse Britain for having\r\n     given them slaves, burn at the stake negroes convicted of crimes, for\r\n     the terror of the example, and writhe in agonies of fear at the very\r\n     mention of human rights as applicable to men of color.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nIn a speech which he delivered at Niblo's Garden, in the city of\r\nNew-York, on the 15th of March, 1847, Daniel Webster, the great Expounder\r\nof the Constitution, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"On the general question of slavery, a great part of the community is\r\n     already strongly excited. The subject has not only attracted\r\n     attention as a question of politics, but it has struck a far deeper\r\n     one ahead. It has arrested the religious feeling of the country, it\r\n     has taken strong hold on the consciences of men. He is a rash man,\r\n     indeed, and little conversant with human nature, and especially has\r\n     he an erroneous estimate of the character of the people of this\r\n     country, who supposes that a feeling of this kind is to be trifled\r\n     with or despised. It will assuredly cause itself to be respected. But\r\n     to endeavor to coin it into silver, or retain its free expression, to\r\n     seek to compress and confine it, warm as it is, and more heated as\r\n     such endeavors would inevitably render it--should this be attempted,\r\n     I know nothing, even in the Constitution or Union itself, which might\r\n     not be endangered by the explosion which might follow.\"\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the Oregon Bill in 1848, he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have made up my mind, for one, that under no circumstances will I\r\n     consent to the further extension of the area of slavery in the United\r\n     States, or to the further increase of slave representation in the\r\n     House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of February 15th, 1850, in a letter to the Rev. Mr. Furness, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"From my earliest youth I have regarded slavery as a great moral and\r\n     political evil. I think it unjust, repugnant to the natural equality\r\n     of mankind, founded only in superior power; a standing and permanent\r\n     conquest by the stronger over the weaker. All pretense of defending\r\n     it on the ground of different races, I have ever condemned. I have\r\n     even said that if the black race is weaker, that is a reason against,\r\n     not for, its subjection and oppression. In a religious point of view\r\n     I have ever regarded it, and even spoken of it, not as subject to any\r\n     express denunciation, either in the Old Testament or the New, but as\r\n     opposed to the whole spirit of the Gospel and to the teachings of\r\n     Jesus Christ. The religion of Jesus Christ is a religion of kindness,\r\n     justice, and brotherly love. But slavery is not kindly affectionate;\r\n     it does not seek anothers, and not its own; it does not let the\r\n     oppressed go free. It is, as I have said, but a continual act of\r\n     oppression. But then, such is the influence of a habit of thinking\r\n     among men, and such is the influence of what has been long\r\n     established, that even minds, religious and tenderly conscientious,\r\n     such as would be shocked by any single act of oppression, in any\r\n     single exercise of violence and unjust power, are not always moved by\r\n     the reflection that slavery is a continual and permanent violation of\r\n     human rights.\"\r\n\r\nWhile delivering a speech at Buffalo, in the State of New York, in the\r\nsummer of 1851, only about twelve months prior to his decease, he made use\r\nof the following emphatic words:--\r\n\r\n     \"I never would consent, and never have consented, that there should\r\n     be one foot of slave territory beyond what the old thirteen States\r\n     had at the formation of the Union. Never, never.\"\r\n\r\nNOAH WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nNoah Webster, the great American vocabulist, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"That freedom is the sacred right of every man, whatever be his\r\n     color, who has not forfeited it by some violation of municipal law,\r\n     is a truth established by God himself, in the very creation of human\r\n     beings. No time, no circumstance, no human power or policy can change\r\n     the nature of this truth, nor repeal the fundamental laws of society,\r\n     by which every man's right to liberty is guarantied. The act of\r\n     enslaving men is always a violation of those great primary laws of\r\n     society, by which alone, the master himself holds every particle of\r\n     his own freedom.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF CLINTON.\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton, the father of the great system of internal improvements in\r\nthe State of New York, speaking of despotism in Europe, and of slavery in\r\nAmerica, asks:--\r\n\r\n     \"Have not prescription and precedent--patriarchal dominion--divine\r\n     right of kings and masters, been alternately called in to sanction\r\n     the slavery of nations? And would not all the despotisms of the\r\n     ancient and modern world have vanished into air, if the natural\r\n     equality of mankind had been properly understood and practiced? * * *\r\n     This declares that the same measure of justice ought to be measured\r\n     out to all men, without regard to adventitious inequalities, and the\r\n     intellectual and physical disparities which proceed from inexplicable\r\n     causes.\"\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF WARREN.\r\n\r\nMajor General Joseph Warren, one of the truest patriots of the Revolution,\r\nand the first American officer of rank that fell in our contest with Great\r\nBritain, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"That personal freedom is the natural right of every man, and that\r\n     property, or an exclusive right to dispose of what he has honestly\r\n     acquired by his own labor, necessarily arises therefrom, are truths\r\n     that common sense has placed beyond the reach of contradiction. And\r\n     no man, or body of men, can, without being guilty of flagrant\r\n     injustice, claim a right to dispose of the persons or acquisitions of\r\n     any other man or body of men, unless it can be proved that such a\r\n     right has arisen from some compact between the parties, in which it\r\n     has been explicitly and freely granted.\"\r\n\r\nOtis, Hancock, Ames, and others, should be heard, but for the want of\r\nspace. Volumes upon volumes might be filled with extracts similar to the\r\nabove, from the works of the deceased Statesmen and sages of the North,\r\nwho, while living, proved themselves equal to the task of exterminating\r\nfrom their own States the matchless curse of human slavery. Such are the\r\nmen who, though no longer with us in the flesh, \"still live.\" A living\r\nprinciple--an immortal interest--have they, invested in every great and\r\ngood work that distinguishes the free States. The railroads, the canals,\r\nthe telegraphs, the factories, the fleets of merchant vessels, the\r\nmagnificent cities, the scientific modes of agriculture, the unrivaled\r\ninstitutions of learning, and other striking evidences of progress and\r\nimprovement at the North, are, either directly or indirectly, the\r\noffspring of their gigantic intellects. When, if ever, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures, and agriculture, and great enterprises, and truth, and\r\nliberty, and justice, and magnanimity, shall have become obsolete terms,\r\nthen their names may possibly be forgotten, but not tell then.\r\n\r\nAn army of brave and worthy successors--champions of Freedom now living,\r\nhave the illustrious forefathers of the North, in the persons of Garrison,\r\nGreeley, Giddings, Goodell, Grow, and Gerrit Smith; in Seward, Sumner,\r\nStowe, Raymond, Parker, and Phillips; in Beecher, Banks, Burlingame,\r\nBryant, Hale, and Hildreth; in Emerson, Dayton, Thompson, Tappan, King and\r\nCheever; in Whittier, Wilson, Wade, Wayland, Weed, and Burleigh. These are\r\nthe men whom, in connection with their learned and eloquent compatriots,\r\nthe Everetts, the Bancrofts, the Prescotts, the Chapins, the Longfellows,\r\nand the Danas, future historians, if faithful to their calling, will place\r\non record as America's true statesmen, literati, preachers, philosophers,\r\nand philanthropists, of the present age.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, however, it may not be amiss to remark that the\r\nHomers, the Platos, the Bacons, the Newtons, the Shakspeares, the Miltons,\r\nthe Blackstones, the Cuviers, the Humboldts, and the Macaulays of America,\r\nhave not yet been produced; nor, in our humble judgment, will they be,\r\nuntil slavery shall have been overthrown and freedom established in the\r\nStates of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Upon the soil of those\r\nStates, when free, or on other free soil crossed by about the same degrees\r\nof latitude, and not distant from the Appalachian chain of mountains,\r\nwill, we believe, be nurtured into manhood, in the course of one or two\r\ncenturies, perhaps, as great men as those mentioned above--greater,\r\npossibly, than any that have ever yet lived. Whence their ancestors may\r\ncome, whether from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, from Oceanica, from\r\nNorth or South America, or from the islands of the sea, or whatever\r\nhonorable vocation they may now be engaged in, matters nothing at all. For\r\nought we know, their great-grandfathers are now humble artisans in Maine,\r\nor moneyed merchants in Massachusetts; illiterate poor whites in\r\nMississippi, or slave-driving lordlings in South Carolina; frugal farmers\r\nin Michigan, or millionaires in Illinois; daring hunters in the Rocky\r\nMountains, or metal-diggers in California; peasants in France, or princes\r\nin Germany--no matter where, or what, the scope of country above-mentioned\r\nis, in our opinion, destined to be the birth-place of their illustrious\r\noffspring--the great savans of the New World, concerning whom we should\r\nconsole ourselves with the hope that they are not buried deeply in the\r\nmatrix of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the true friends of freedom throughout the world, it is a pleasing\r\nthought, and one which, by being communicated to others, is well\r\ncalculated to universalize the principles of liberty, that the great\r\nheroes, statesmen, and sages, of all ages and nations, ancient and modern,\r\nwho have ever had occasion to speak of the institution of human slavery,\r\nhave entered their most unequivocal and positive protests against it. To\r\nsay that they disapproved of the system would not be sufficiently\r\nexpressive of the utter detestation with which they uniformly regarded it.\r\nThat they abhorred it as the vilest invention that the Evil-One has ever\r\nassisted bad men to concoct, is quite evident from the very tone and\r\nconstruction of their language.\r\n\r\nHaving, with much pleasure and profit, heard the testimony of America,\r\nthrough her representative men, we will now hear that of other nations,\r\nthrough their representative men--doubting not that we shall be more than\r\nremunerated for our time and trouble. We will first listen to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nIn the case of James Somerset, a negro who had been kidnapped in Africa,\r\ntransported to Virginia, there sold into slavery, thence carried to\r\nEngland, as a waiting-boy, and there induced to institute proceedings\r\nagainst his master for the recovery of his freedom,\r\n\r\nMANSFIELD says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of\r\n     being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by\r\n     positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons,\r\n     occasion, and time itself whence it was created, is erased from the\r\n     memory. It is so odious that nothing can be sufficient to support it\r\n     but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from\r\n     the decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the\r\n     law of England, and therefore the black must be discharged.\"\r\n\r\nLOCKE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is so vile, so miserable a state of man, and so directly\r\n     opposite to the generous temper and courage of our nation, that it is\r\n     hard to be convinced that an Englishman, much less a gentleman,\r\n     should plead for it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Though the earth, and all inferior creatures be common to all men,\r\n     yet every man has a property in his own person; this nobody has any\r\n     right to but himself.\"\r\n\r\nPITT says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is injustice to permit slavery to remain for a single hour.\"\r\n\r\nFOX says:--\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to a regulation of slavery, my detestation of its\r\n     existence induces me to know no such thing as a regulation of\r\n     robbery, and a restriction of murder. Personal freedom is a right of\r\n     which he who deprives a fellow-creature is criminal in so depriving\r\n     him, and he who withholds is no less criminal in withholding.\"\r\n\r\nSHAKSPEARE says:--\r\n\r\n  \"A man is master of his liberty.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"It is the curse of Kings, to be attended\r\n  By slaves, that take their humors for a warrant\r\n  To break within the bloody house of life,\r\n  And, on the winking of authority,\r\n  To understand a law; to know the meaning\r\n  Of dangerous majesty, when, perchance, it frowns\r\n  More upon humor than advised respect.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n  \"Heaven will one day free us from this slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n  \"Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!--\r\n  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets;\r\n  Some to the common pulpits, and cry out,\r\n  Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement\"\r\n\r\nCOWPER says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n  Receive our air, that moment they are free.\r\n  They touch our country and their shackles fall.\r\n  That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud\r\n  And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,\r\n  And let it circulate through every vein\r\n  Of all your Empire, that where Britain's power\r\n  Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too!\"\r\n\r\nMILTON asks:--\r\n\r\n  \"Where is the beauty to see,\r\n  Like the sun-brilliant brow of a nation when free?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"If our fathers promised for themselves, to make themselves slaves,\r\n     they could make no such promise for us.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"Since, therefore, the law is chiefly right reason, if we are bound\r\n     to obey a magistrate as a minister of God, by the very same reason\r\n     and the very same law, we ought to resist a tyrant, and minister of\r\n     the devil.\"\r\n\r\nDR. JOHNSON says:--\r\n\r\n     \"No man is by nature the property of another. The rights of nature\r\n     must be some way forfeited before they can justly be taken away.\"\r\n\r\nDR. PRICE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"If you have a right to make another man a slave, he has a right to\r\n     make you a slave.\"\r\n\r\nBLACKSTONE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"If neither captivity nor contract can, by the plain law of nature\r\n     and reason, reduce the parent to a state of slavery, much less can\r\n     they reduce the offspring.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The primary aim of society is to protect individuals in the\r\n     enjoyment of those absolute rights which were vested in them by the\r\n     immutable laws of nature. Hence it follows that the first and primary\r\n     end of human laws is to maintain those absolute rights of\r\n     individuals.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"If any human law shall allow or require us to commit crime, we are\r\n     bound to transgress that human law, or else we must offend both the\r\n     natural and divine.\"\r\n\r\nCOKE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"What the Parliament doth, shall be holden for naught, whenever it\r\n     shall enact that which is contrary to the rights of nature.\"\r\n\r\nHAMPDEN says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The essence of all law is justice. What is not justice is not law;\r\n     and what is not law, ought not to be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\nHARRINGTON says:--\r\n\r\n     \"All men naturally, are equal; for though nature with a noble variety\r\n     has made different features and lineaments of men, yet as to freedom,\r\n     she has made every one alike, and given them the same desires.\"\r\n\r\nFORTESCUE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Those rights which God and nature have established, and which are\r\n     therefore called natural rights, such as life and liberty, need not\r\n     the aid of human laws to be more effectually invested in every man\r\n     than they are; neither do they receive any additional strength when\r\n     declared by the municipal laws to be inviolable. On the contrary, no\r\n     human power has any authority to abridge or destroy them, unless the\r\n     owner himself shall commit some act that amounts to a forfeiture.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The law, therefore, which supports slavery and opposes liberty, must\r\n     necessarily be condemned as cruel, for every feeling of human nature\r\n     advocates liberty. Slavery is introduced by human wickedness, but God\r\n     advocates liberty, by the nature which he has given to man.\"\r\n\r\nBROUGHAM says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Tell me not of rights--talk not of the property of the planter in\r\n     his slaves. I deny the right; I acknowledge not the property. In vain\r\n     you tell me of laws that sanction such a claim. There is a law above\r\n     all the enactments of human codes, the same throughout the world, the\r\n     same in all times; it is the law written by the finger of God on the\r\n     hearts of men; and by that law, unchangeable and eternal, while men\r\n     despise fraud, and loathe rapine, and abhor blood, they shall reject\r\n     with indignation the wild and guilty phantasy that man can hold\r\n     property in man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF IRELAND.\r\n\r\nBURKE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is a state so improper, so degrading, and so ruinous to the\r\n     feelings and capacities of human nature, that it ought not to be\r\n     suffered to exist.\"\r\n\r\nCURRAN says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I speak in the spirit of British law, which makes liberty\r\n     commensurate with and inseparable from British soil; which proclaims\r\n     even to the stranger and the sojourner, the moment he sets his foot\r\n     upon British earth, that the ground on which he treads is holy and\r\n     consecrated by the genius of Universal Emancipation. No matter in\r\n     what language his doom may have been pronounced; no matter what\r\n     complexion, incompatible with freedom, an Indian or African sun may\r\n     have burnt upon him; no matter in what disastrous battle his liberty\r\n     may have been cloven down; no matter with what solemnities he may\r\n     have been devoted upon the altar of slavery, the moment he touches\r\n     the sacred soil of Britain, the altar and the god sink together in\r\n     the dust; his soul walks abroad in her own majesty; and he stands\r\n     redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled by the irresistible genius of\r\n     Universal Emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dublin University Magazine for December, 1856, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The United States must learn, from the example of Rome, that\r\n     Christianity and the pagan institution of slavery cannot co-exist\r\n     together. The Republic must take her side and choose her favorite\r\n     child; for if she love the one, she must hate the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nBEATTIE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is inconsistent with the dearest and most essential rights\r\n     of man's nature; it is detrimental to virtue and industry; it hardens\r\n     the heart to those tender sympathies which form the most lovely part\r\n     of human character; it involves the innocent in hopeless misery, in\r\n     order to procure wealth and pleasure for the authors of that misery;\r\n     it seeks to degrade into brutes beings whom the Lord of Heaven and\r\n     Earth endowed with rational souls, and created for immortality; in\r\n     short, it is utterly repugnant to every principle of reason,\r\n     religion, humanity, and conscience. It is impossible for a\r\n     considerate and unprejudiced mind, to think of slavery without\r\n     horror.\"\r\n\r\nMILLER says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The human mind revolts at a serious discussion of the subject of\r\n     slavery. Every individual, whatever be his country or complexion, is\r\n     entitled to freedom.\"\r\n\r\nMACKNIGHT says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Men-stealers are inserted among the daring criminals against whom\r\n     the law of God directed its awful curses. These were persons who\r\n     kidnapped men to sell them for slaves; and this practice seems\r\n     inseparable from the other iniquities and oppressions of slavery; nor\r\n     can a slave dealer easily keep free from this criminality, if indeed\r\n     the receiver is as bad as the thief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I would never have drawn my sword in the cause of America, if I\r\n     could have conceived that thereby I was founding a land of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, while in the prison of Magdeburg, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I know not what disposition has been made of my plantation at\r\n     Cayenne; but I hope Madame de Lafayette will take care that the\r\n     negroes who cultivate it shall preserve their liberty.\"\r\n\r\nO. LAFAYETTE, grandson of General Lafayette, in a letter under date of\r\nApril 26th, 1851, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"This great question of the Abolition of Negro Slavery, which has my\r\n     entire sympathy, appears to me to have established its importance\r\n     throughout the world. At the present time, the States of the\r\n     Peninsula, if I do not deceive myself, are the only European powers\r\n     who still continue to possess slaves; and America, while continuing\r\n     to uphold slavery, feels daily, more and more how heavily it weighs\r\n     upon her destinies.\"\r\n\r\nMONTESQUIEU asks:--\r\n\r\n     \"What civil law can restrain a slave from running away, since he is\r\n     not a member of society?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is contrary to the fundamental principles of all societies.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"In democracies, where they are all upon an equality, slavery is\r\n     contrary to the principles of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing puts one nearer the condition of a brute than always to see\r\n     freemen and not be free.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"Even the earth itself, which teems with profusion under the\r\n     cultivating hand of the free born laborer, shrinks into barrenness\r\n     from the contaminating sweat of a slave.\"\r\n\r\nLOUIS X. issued the following edict:--\r\n\r\n     \"As all men are by nature free born, and as this Kingdom is called\r\n     the Kingdom of Franks, (freemen) it shall be so in reality. It is\r\n     therefore decreed that enfranchisement shall be granted throughout\r\n     the whole Kingdom upon just and reasonable terms.\"\r\n\r\nBUFFON says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is apparent that the unfortunate negroes are endowed with\r\n     excellent hearts, and possess the seeds of every human virtue. I\r\n     cannot write their history without lamenting their miserable\r\n     condition.\" \"Humanity revolts at those odious oppressions that result\r\n     from avarice.\"\r\n\r\nROUSSEAU says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The terms _slavery_ and _right_, contradict and exclude each other.\"\r\n\r\nBRISSOT says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery, in all its forms, in all its degrees, is a violation of\r\n     divine law, and a degradation of human nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\nGROTIUS says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Those are men-stealers who abduct, keep, sell or buy slaves or free\r\n     men. To steal a man is the highest kind of theft.\"\r\n\r\nGOETHE SAYS:--\r\n\r\n  Such busy multitudes I fain would see\r\n  Stand upon free soil with a people free.\"\r\n\r\nLUTHER SAYS:--\r\n\r\n     \"Unjust violence is, by no means, the ordinance of God, and therefore\r\n     can bind no one in conscience and right, to obey, whether the command\r\n     comes from pope, emperor, king or master.\"\r\n\r\nAn able German writer of the present day, says, in a recent letter to his\r\nfriends in this country:--\r\n\r\n     \"Consider that the cause of American liberty is the cause of\r\n     universal liberty; its failure, a triumph of despotism everywhere.\r\n     Remember that while American liberty is the great argument of\r\n     European Democracy, American slavery is the greater argument of its\r\n     despotism. Remember that all our actions should be governed by the\r\n     golden rule, whether individual, social, or political; and no\r\n     government, and, above all, no republican government, is safe in the\r\n     hands of men that practically deny that rule. Will you support by\r\n     your vote a system that recognizes property of man in man? A system\r\n     which sanctions the sale of the child by its own father, regardless\r\n     of the purpose of the buyer? What need is there to present to you the\r\n     unmitigated wrong of slavery? It is the shame of our age that\r\n     argument is needed against slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"Liberty is no exclusive property; it is the property of mankind of\r\n     all ages. She is immortal, though crushed, can never die; though\r\n     banished, she will return; though fettered, she will yet be free.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF ITALY.\r\n\r\nCICERO SAYS:--\r\n\r\n     \"By the grand laws of nature, all men are born free, and this law is\r\n     universally binding upon all men.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Eternal justice is the basis of all human laws.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"Law is not something wrought out by man's ingenuity, nor is it a\r\n     decree of the people, but it is something eternal, governing the\r\n     world by the wisdom of its commands and prohibitions.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whatever is just is also the true law, nor can this true law be\r\n     abrogated by any written enactments.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"If there be such a power in the decrees and commands of fools, that\r\n     the nature of things is changed by their votes, why do they not\r\n     decree that what is bad and pernicious shall be regarded as good and\r\n     wholesome, or why, if the law can make wrong right, can it not make\r\n     bad good?\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"Those who have made pernicious and unjust decrees, have made\r\n     anything rather than laws.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\r\n\r\n     \"The law of all nations forbids one man to pursue his advantage at\r\n     the expense of another.\"\r\n\r\nLACTANTIUS says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Justice teaches men to know God and to love men, to love and assist\r\n     one another, being all equally the children of God.\"\r\n\r\nLEO X. says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Not only does the Christian religion, but nature herself cry out\r\n     against the state of slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF GREECE.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is a system of outrage and robbery.\"\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is neither for the good, nor is it just, seeing all men are by\r\n     nature alike, and equal, that one should be lord and master over\r\n     others.\"\r\n\r\nPOLYBIUS says:--\r\n\r\n     \"None but unprincipled and beastly men in society assume the mastery\r\n     over their fellows, as it is among bulls, bears, and cocks.\"\r\n\r\nPLATO says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is a system of the most complete injustice.\"\r\n\r\nFrom each of the above, and from other nations, additional testimony is at\r\nhand; but, for reasons already assigned, we forbear to introduce it.\r\nCorroborative of the correctness of the position which we have assumed,\r\neven Persia has a voice, which may be easily recognized in the tones of\r\nher immortal Cyrus, who says:\r\n\r\n     \"To fight, in order not to be made a slave, is noble.\"\r\n\r\nThan Great Britain no nation has more heartily or honorably repented of\r\nthe crime of slavery--no nation, on the perception of its error, has ever\r\nacted with more prompt magnanimity to its outraged and unhappy bondsmen.\r\nEntered to her credit, many precious jewels of liberty remain in our\r\npossession, ready to be delivered when called for; of their value some\r\nidea may be formed, when we state that they are filigreed with such names\r\nas Wilberforce, Buxton, Granville, Grattan, Camden, Clarkson, Sharp,\r\nSheridan, Sidney, Martin, and Macaulay.\r\n\r\nVirginia, the Carolinas, and other Southern States, which are provided\r\nwith _republican (!)_ forms of government, and which have abolished\r\nfreedom, should learn, from the history of the monarchal governments of\r\nthe Old World, if not from the example of the more liberal and enlightened\r\nportions of the New, how to abolish slavery. The lesson is before them in\r\na variety of exceedingly interesting forms, and, sooner or later, they\r\nmust learn it, either voluntarily or by compulsion. Virginia, in\r\nparticular, is a spoilt child, having been the pet of the General\r\nGovernment for the last sixty-eight years; and like most other spoilt\r\nchildren, she has become froward, peevish, perverse, sulky and\r\nirreverent--not caring to know her duties, and failing to perform even\r\nthose which she does know. Her superiors perceive that the abolition of\r\nslavery would be a blessing to her; she is, however, either too ignorant\r\nto understand the truth, or else, as is the more probable, her false pride\r\nand obstinacy restrain her from acknowledging it. What is to be done?\r\nShall ignorance, or prejudice, or obduracy, or willful meanness, triumph\r\nover knowledge, and liberality, and guilelessness, and laudable\r\nenterprise? No, never! Assured that Virginia and all the other\r\nslaveholding States are doing wrong every day, it is our duty to make them\r\ndo right, if we have the power; and we believe we have the power now\r\nresident within their own borders. What are the opinions, generally, of\r\nthe non-slaveholding whites? Let them speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n  \"Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets,\r\n  Some to the common pulpits, and cry out,\r\n  Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn quest of arguments against slavery, we have perused the works of\r\nseveral eminent Christian writers of different denominations, and we now\r\nproceed to lay before the reader the result of a portion of our labor. As\r\nit is the special object of this chapter to operate on, to correct and\r\ncleanse the consciences of slaveholding professors of religion, we shall\r\nadduce testimony only from the five churches to which they, in their\r\nsatanic piety, mostly belong--the Presbyterian, the Episcopal, the\r\nBaptist, the Methodist, and the Roman Catholic--all of which, thank\r\nHeaven, are destined, at no distant day, to become thoroughly\r\nabolitionized. With few exceptions, all the other Christian sects are, as\r\nthey should be, avowedly and inflexibly opposed to the inhuman institution\r\nof slavery. The Congregational, the Quaker, the Lutheran, the Dutch and\r\nGerman Reformed, the Unitarian, and the Universalist, especially, are all\r\nhonorable, able, and eloquent defenders of the natural rights of man. We\r\nwill begin by introducing a mass of\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESBYTERIAN TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Albert Barnes, of Philadelphia, one of the most learned\r\nPresbyterian preachers and commentators of the day, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is a deep and growing conviction in the minds of the mass of\r\n     mankind, that slavery violates the great laws of our nature; that it\r\n     is contrary to the dictates of humanity; that it is essentially\r\n     unjust, oppressive, and cruel; that it invades the rights of liberty\r\n     with which the Author of our being has endowed all human beings; and\r\n     that, in all the forms in which it has ever existed, it has been\r\n     impossible to guard it from what its friends and advocates would call\r\n     '_abuses_ of the system.' It is a violation of the first sentiments\r\n     expressed in our Declaration of Independence, and on which our\r\n     fathers founded the vindication of their own conduct in an appeal to\r\n     arms. It is at war with all that a man claims for himself and for his\r\n     own children; and it is opposed to all the struggles of mankind, in\r\n     all ages, for freedom. The claims of humanity plead against it. The\r\n     struggles for freedom everywhere in our world condemn it. The\r\n     instinctive feeling in every man's own bosom in regard to himself is\r\n     a condemnation of it. The noblest deeds of valor, and of patriotism\r\n     in our own land, and in all lands where men have struggled for\r\n     freedom, are a condemnation of the system. All that is noble in man\r\n     is opposed to it; all that is base, oppressive, and cruel, pleads for\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"The spirit of the New Testament is against slavery, and the\r\n     principles of the New Testament, if fairly applied, would abolish it.\r\n     In the New Testament no man is commanded to purchase and own a slave;\r\n     no man is commended as adding anything to the evidences of his\r\n     Christian character, or as performing the appropriate duty of a\r\n     Christian, for owning one. No where in the New Testament is the\r\n     institution referred to as a good one, or as a desirable one. It is\r\n     commonly--indeed, it is almost universally--conceded that the proper\r\n     application of the principles of the New Testament would abolish\r\n     slavery everywhere, or that, the state of things which will exist\r\n     when the Gospel shall be fairly applied to all the relations of life,\r\n     slavery will not be found among those relations.\r\n\r\n     \"Let slavery be removed from the church, and let the voice of the\r\n     church, with one accord, be lifted up in favor of freedom; let the\r\n     church be wholly detached from the institution, and let there be\r\n     adopted by all its ministers and members an interpretation of the\r\n     Bible--as I believe there may be and ought to be--that shall be in\r\n     accordance with the deep-seated principles of our nature in favor of\r\n     freedom, and with our own aspirations for liberty, and with the\r\n     sentiments of the world in its onward progress in regard to human\r\n     rights, and not only would a very material objection against the\r\n     Bible be taken away--and one which would be fatal if it were well\r\n     founded--but the establishment of a very strong argument _in favor_\r\n     of the Bible, as a revelation from God, would be the direct result of\r\n     such a position.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Scott, the celebrated English Presbyterian Commentator, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"To number the persons of men with beasts, sheep, and horses, as the\r\n     stock of a farm, or with bales of goods, as the cargo of a ship, is,\r\n     no doubt, a most detestable and anti-Christian practice.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a resolution denunciatory of slavery, unanimously adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, in 1818, we make the\r\nfollowing extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"We consider the voluntary enslaving of one part of the human race by\r\n     another as a gross violation of the most precious and sacred rights\r\n     of human nature, as utterly inconsistent with the law of God, which\r\n     requires us to love our neighbor as ourselves, and as totally\r\n     irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of the Gospel of\r\n     Christ, which enjoins that 'all things whatsoever ye would that men\r\n     should do to you, do ye even so to them.' * * * We rejoice that the\r\n     church to which we belong commenced, as early as any other in this\r\n     country, the good work of endeavoring to put an end to slavery, and\r\n     that in the same work many of its members have ever since been, and\r\n     now are, among the most active, vigorous, and efficient laborers. * *\r\n     * We earnestly exhort them to continue, and, if possible, to\r\n     increase, their exertions to effect a total abolition of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nA Committee of the Synod of Kentucky, in an address to the Presbyterians\r\nof that State, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"That our negroes will be worse off, if emancipated, is, we feel, but\r\n     a specious pretext for lulling our own pangs of conscience, and\r\n     answering the argument of the philanthropist. None of us believe that\r\n     God has so created a whole race that it is better for them to remain\r\n     in perpetual bondage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEPISCOPAL TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nBISHOP HORSLEY says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery is injustice, which no consideration of policy can\r\n     extenuate.\"\r\n\r\nBISHOP BUTLER says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Despicable as the negroes may appear in our eyes, they are the\r\n     creatures of God, and of the race of mankind, for whom Christ died,\r\n     and it is inexcusable to keep them in ignorance of the end for which\r\n     they were made, and of the means whereby they may become partakers of\r\n     the general redemption.\"\r\n\r\nBISHOP PORTEUS says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Bible classes men-stealers or slave-traders among the murderers\r\n     of fathers and mothers, and the most profane criminals on earth.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Jay, Esq., of the City of New-York--a most exemplary Episcopalian--in\r\na pamphlet entitled, \"Thoughts on the Duty of the Episcopal Church, in\r\nRelation to Slavery,\" says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Alas! for the expectation that she would conform to the spirit of\r\n     her ancient mother! She has not merely remained a mute and careless\r\n     spectator of this great conflict of truth and justice with hypocrisy\r\n     and cruelty, but her very priests and deacons may be seen ministering\r\n     at the altar of slavery, offering their talents and influence at its\r\n     unholy shrine, and openly repeating the awful blasphemy, that the\r\n     precepts of our Saviour sanction the system of American slavery. Her\r\n     Northern clergy, with rare exceptions, whatever they may feel on the\r\n     subject, rebuke it neither in public nor in private, and her\r\n     periodicals, far from advancing the progress of abolition, at times\r\n     oppose our societies, impliedly defending slavery, as not\r\n     incompatible with Christianity, and occasionally withholding\r\n     information useful to the cause of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in a late number of \"The Anti-Slavery Church man,\" published in\r\nGeneva, Wisconsin, speaking of a certain portion of the New Testament,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"This passage of Paul places necessary work in the hands of Gospel\r\n     ministers. If they preach the whole Gospel, they must preach what\r\n     this passage enjoins--and if they do this, they must preach against\r\n     American slavery. Its being connected with politics does not shield\r\n     them. Political connections cannot place sin under protection. They\r\n     cannot throw around it guards that the public teachers of morals may\r\n     not pass. Sin is a violation of God's law--and God's law must be\r\n     proclaimed and enforced at all hazards. This is the business of the\r\n     messenger of God, and if anything stands in its way, it is his right,\r\n     rather it is his solemn commission, to go forward--straightway to\r\n     overpass the lines that would shut him out, and utter his warnings.\r\n     Many sins there are, that, in like manner, might be shielded.\r\n     Fashion, and rank, and business, are doing their part to keep much\r\n     sin in respectability, and excuse it from the attacks of God's\r\n     ministers. But what are these, that they should seal a minister's\r\n     lips--what more are the wishes of politicians?\"\r\n\r\nFor further testimony from this branch of the Christian system, if\r\ndesired, we refer the reader to the Rev. Dudley A. Tyng, the Rev. Evan M.\r\nJohnson, and the Rev. J. McNamara,--all Broad Church Episcopalians, whose\r\nmagic eloquence and irresistible arguments bid fair, at an early day, to\r\nwin over to the paths of progressive freedom, truth, justice and humanity,\r\nthe greater number of their High and Low Church brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAPTIST TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nConcerning a certain text, the Rev. Mr. Brisbane, once a slaveholding\r\nBaptist in South Carolina, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Paul was speaking of the law as having been made for men-stealers.\r\n     Where is the record of that law? It is in Exodus xxi. 16, and in\r\n     these words: 'He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be\r\n     found in his possession, he shall surely be put to death.' Here it\r\n     will be perceived that it was a crime to sell the man, for which the\r\n     seller must suffer death. But it was no less a crime to hold him as a\r\n     slave, for this also was punishable with death. A man may be\r\n     kidnapped out of slavery into freedom. There was no law against that.\r\n     And why? Because kidnapping a slave and placing him in a condition of\r\n     freedom, was only to restore him to his lost rights. But if the man\r\n     who takes him becomes a slaveholder, or a slave seller, then he is a\r\n     criminal, liable to the penalty of death, because he robs the man of\r\n     liberty. Perhaps some will say this law was only applicable to the\r\n     first holder of the slave, that is, the original kidnapper, but not\r\n     to his successors who might have purchased or inherited him. But what\r\n     is kidnapping? Suppose I propose to a neighbor to give him a certain\r\n     sum of money if he will steal a white child in Carolina and deliver\r\n     him to me. He steals him; I pay him the money upon his delivering the\r\n     child to me. Is it not my act as fully as his? Am I not also the\r\n     thief? But does it alter the case whether I agree before hand or not,\r\n     to pay him for the child? He steals him, and then sells him to me.\r\n     He is found by his parents in my hands. Will it avail me to say I\r\n     purchased him and paid my money for him? Will it not be asked, Do you\r\n     not know that a white person is not merchantable? And shall I not\r\n     have to pay the damage for detaining that child in my service as a\r\n     slave? Assuredly, not only in the eyes of the law, but in the\r\n     judgment of the whole community, I would be regarded a criminal. So\r\n     when one man steals another and offers him for sale, no one, in view\r\n     of the Divine law, can buy him, for the reason that the Divine law\r\n     forbids that man shall in the first place be made a merchantable\r\n     article. The inquiry must be, if I buy, I buy in violation of the\r\n     Divine law, and it will not do for me to plead that I bought him. I\r\n     have him in possession, and that is enough, God condemns me for it as\r\n     a man-stealer. My having him in possession is evidence against me,\r\n     and the Mosaic law says, if he be found in my hands, I must die. Now,\r\n     when Paul said the law was made for men-stealers, was it not also\r\n     saying the law was made for slaveholders? I am not intending to apply\r\n     this term in harsh spirit. But I am bound, as I fear God to speak\r\n     what I am satisfied is the true meaning of the apostle.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Elements of Moral Science,\" the Rev. Francis Wayland, D.D., one of\r\nthe most erudite and distinguished Baptists now living, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Domestic slavery proceeds upon the principle that the master has a\r\n     right to control the actions, physical and intellectual, of the\r\n     slave, for his own, that is, the master's individual benefit; and, of\r\n     course, that the happiness of the master, when it comes in\r\n     competition with the happiness of the slave, extinguishes in the\r\n     latter the right to pursue it. It supposes, at best, that the\r\n     relation between master and slave, is not that which exists between\r\n     man and man, but is a modification, at least, of that which exists\r\n     between man and the brutes.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, this manifestly supposes that the two classes of beings are\r\n     created with dissimilar rights: that the master posseses rights which\r\n     have never been conceded by the slave; and that the slave has no\r\n     rights at all over the means of happiness which God has given him,\r\n     whenever these means of happiness can be rendered available to the\r\n     service of his master. It supposes that the Creator intended one\r\n     human being to govern the physical, intellectual and moral actions of\r\n     as many other human beings as by purchase he can bring within his\r\n     physical power; and that one human being may thus acquire a right to\r\n     sacrifice the happiness of any number of other human beings, for the\r\n     purpose of promoting his own. Slavery thus violates the personal\r\n     liberty of man as a physical, intellectual, and moral being.\r\n\r\n     \"It purports to give to the master a right to control the physical\r\n     labor of the slave, not for the sake of the happiness of the slave,\r\n     but for the sake of the happiness of the master. It subjects the\r\n     amount of labor, and the kind of labor, and the remuneration for\r\n     labor, entirely to the will of the one party, to the entire exclusion\r\n     of the will of the other party.\r\n\r\n     \"But if this right in the master over the slave be conceded there are\r\n     of course conceded all other rights necessary to insure its\r\n     possession. Hence, inasmuch as the slave can be held in this\r\n     condition only while he remains in the lowest state of mental\r\n     imbecility, it supposes the master to have the right to control his\r\n     intellectual development, just as far as may be necessary to secure\r\n     entire subjection. Thus, it supposes the slave to have no right to\r\n     use his intellect for the production of his own happiness; but, only\r\n     to use it in such manner as may conduce to his master's profit.\r\n\r\n     And, moreover, inasmuch as the acquisition of the knowledge of his\r\n     duty to God could not be freely made without the acquisition of other\r\n     knowledge, which might, if universally diffused, endanger the control\r\n     of the master, slavery supposes the master to have the right to\r\n     determine how much knowledge of his duty a slave shall obtain, the\r\n     manner in which he shall obtain it, and the manner in which he shall\r\n     discharge that duty after he shall have obtained a knowledge of it.\r\n     It thus subjects the duty of man to God entirely to the will of man;\r\n     and this for the sake of pecuniary profit. It renders the eternal\r\n     happiness of the one party subservient to the temporal happiness of\r\n     the other. And this principle is commonly carried into effect in\r\n     slaveholding countries.\r\n\r\n     If argument were necessary to show that such a system as this must be\r\n     at variance with the ordinance of God, it might be easily drawn from\r\n     the effects which it produces both upon _morals_ and _national\r\n     wealth_.\r\n\r\n     Its effects must be disastrous upon the _morals_ of both parties. By\r\n     presenting objects on whom passion may be satiated without resistance\r\n     and without redress, it cultivates in the master, pride, anger,\r\n     cruelty, selfishness and licentiousness. By accustoming the slave to\r\n     subject his moral principles to the will of another, it tends to\r\n     abolish in him all moral distinction; and thus fosters in him lying,\r\n     deceit, hypocrisy, dishonesty, and a willingness to yield himself up\r\n     to minister to the appetites of his master.\r\n\r\n     The effects of slavery on _national wealth_, may be easily seen from\r\n     the following considerations:--\r\n\r\n     Instead of imposing upon all the necessity of labor, it restricts the\r\n     number of laborers, that is of producers, within the smallest\r\n     possible limit, by rendering labor disgraceful.\r\n\r\n     It takes from the laborers the natural stimulus to labor, namely, the\r\n     desire in the individual of improving his condition; and substitutes,\r\n     in the place of it, that motive which is the least operative and the\r\n     least constant, namely, the fear of punishment without the\r\n     consciousness of moral delinquency.\r\n\r\n     It removes, as far as possible, from both parties, the disposition\r\n     and the motives to frugality. Neither the master learns frugality\r\n     from the necessity of labor, nor the slave from the benefits which it\r\n     confers. And here, while the one party wastes from ignorance of the\r\n     laws of acquisition, and the other because he can have no motive to\r\n     economy, capital must accumulate but slowly, if indeed it accumulate\r\n     at all.\r\n\r\n     No country, not of great fertility, can long sustain a large slave\r\n     population. Soils of more than ordinary fertility can not sustain it\r\n     long, after the richness of the soil has been exhausted. Hence,\r\n     slavery in this country is acknowledged to have impoverished many of\r\n     our most valuable districts; and, hence, it is continually migrating\r\n     from the older settlements, to those new and untilled regions, where\r\n     the accumulated manure of centuries of vegetation has formed a soil,\r\n     whose productiveness may, for a while, sustain a system at variance\r\n     with the laws of nature. Many of our free and of our slaveholding\r\n     States were peopled at about the same time. The slaveholding States\r\n     had every advantage, both in soil and climate, over their neighbors.\r\n     And yet the accumulation of capital has been greatly in favor of the\r\n     latter. If any one doubts whether this difference be owing to the use\r\n     of slave labor, let him ask himself what would have been the\r\n     condition of the slaveholding States, at this moment, if they had\r\n     been inhabited, from the beginning, by an industrious yeomanry; each\r\n     one holding his own land, and each one tilling it with the labor of\r\n     his own hands.\r\n\r\n     The moral precepts of the Bible are diametrically opposed to slavery.\r\n     They are, Thou shalt love thy _neighbor_ as _thyself_, and _all\r\n     things whatsoever_ ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even\r\n     so unto them.\r\n\r\n     The application of these precepts is universal. Our neighbor is\r\n     _every one whom we may benefit_. The obligation respects _all things\r\n     whatsoever_. The precept, then, manifestly, extends to _men, as men,\r\n     or men in every condition_; and if to all things whatsoever,\r\n     certainly to a thing so important as the right to personal liberty.\r\n\r\n     Again. By this precept, it is made our duty to cherish as tender and\r\n     delicate a respect for the right which the meanest individual\r\n     posseses over the means of happiness bestowed upon him by God, as we\r\n     cherish for our own right over our own means of happiness, or as we\r\n     desire any other individual to cherish for it. Now, were this precept\r\n     obeyed, it is manifest that slavery could not in fact exist for a\r\n     single instant. The principle of the precept is absolutely subversive\r\n     of the principle of slavery. That of the one is the entire equality\r\n     of right; that of the other, the entire absorption of the rights of\r\n     one in the rights of the other.\r\n\r\n     If any one doubts respecting the bearing of the Scripture precept\r\n     upon this case, a few plain questions may throw additional light upon\r\n     the subject. For instance,--\r\n\r\n     \"Do the precepts and the spirit of the Gospel allow me to derive my\r\n     support from a system which extorts labor from my fellow-men, without\r\n     allowing them any voice in the equivalent which they shall receive;\r\n     and which can only be sustained by keeping them in a state of mental\r\n     degradation, and by shutting them out, in a great degree, from the\r\n     means of salvation?\r\n\r\n     \"Would the master be willing that another person should subject him\r\n     to slavery, for the same reasons, and on the same grounds, that he\r\n     holds his slave in bondage?\r\n\r\n     \"Would the Gospel allow us, if it were in our power, to reduce our\r\n     fellow-citizens of our own color to slavery? If the gospel be\r\n     diametrically opposed to the _principle_ of slavery, it must be\r\n     opposed to the _practice_ of slavery; and therefore, were the\r\n     principles of the gospel fully adopted, slavery could not exist.\r\n\r\n     \"The very course which the gospel takes on this subject, seems to\r\n     have been the only one that could have been taken, in order to effect\r\n     the universal abolition of slavery. The gospel was designed, not for\r\n     one race, or for one time, but for all races, and for all times. It\r\n     looked not at the abolition of this form of evil for that age alone,\r\n     but for its universal abolition. Hence, the important object of its\r\n     Author was, to gain it a lodgment in every part of the known world;\r\n     so that, by its universal diffusion among all classes of society, it\r\n     might quietly and peacefully modify and subdue the evil passions of\r\n     men; and thus, without violence, work a revolution in the whole mass\r\n     of mankind.\r\n\r\n     \"If the system be wrong, as we have endeavored to show, if it be at\r\n     variance with our duty both to God and to man, it must be abandoned.\r\n     If it be asked when, I ask again, when shall a man begin to cease\r\n     doing wrong? Is not the answer, _immediately_? If a man is injuring\r\n     _us_, do we ever doubt as to the time when _he_ ought to cease? There\r\n     is then no doubt in respect to the time when we ought to cease\r\n     inflicting injury upon others.\"\r\n\r\nAbraham Booth, an eminent theological writer of the Baptist persuasion,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have not a stronger conviction of scarcely anything, than that\r\n     slaveholding (except when the slave has forfeited his liberty by\r\n     crimes against society) is wicked and inconsistent with Christian\r\n     character. To me it is evident, that whoever would purchase an\r\n     innocent black man to make him a slave, would with equal readiness\r\n     purchase a white one for the same purpose could he do it with equal\r\n     impunity, and no more disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the General Committee of the Baptists of Virginia, in\r\n1789, the following resolution was offered by Eld. John Leland, and\r\nadopted:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That slavery is a violent deprivation of the rights of\r\n     nature, and inconsistent with republican government, and therefore we\r\n     recommend it to our brethren to make use of every measure to\r\n     extirpate this horrid evil from the land; and pray Almighty God that\r\n     our honorable legislature may have it in their power to proclaim the\r\n     great jubilee, consistent with the principles of good policy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODIST TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley, the celebrated founder of Methodism, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Men buyers are exactly on a level with men stealers.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"American Slavery is the vilest that ever saw the sun; it constitutes\r\n     the sum of all villanies.\"\r\n\r\nThe learned Dr. Adam Clarke, author of a voluminous commentary on the\r\nScriptures, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Slave-dealers, whether those who carry on the traffic in human flesh\r\n     and blood; or those who steal a person in order to sell him into\r\n     bondage; or those who buy such stolen men or women, no matter of what\r\n     color, or what country; or the nations who legalize or connive at\r\n     such traffic; all these are men-stealers, and God classes them with\r\n     the most flagitious of mortals.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the rules laid down in the Methodist Discipline as amended in 1784,\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Every member of our Society who has slaves in his possession, shall,\r\n     within twelve months after notice given to him by the assistant,\r\n     legally execute and record an instrument, whereby he emancipates and\r\n     sets free every slave in his possession.\"\r\n\r\nAnother rule was in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"No person holding slaves shall in future be admitted into Society,\r\n     or to the Lord's Supper, till he previously complies with these rules\r\n     concerning slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question--\"What shall be done with those who buy or sell\r\nslaves, or give them away\"--is couched in the following language:--\r\n\r\n     \"They are immediately to be expelled, unless they buy them on purpose\r\n     to free them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1785, the voice of this church was heard as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"We do hold in the deepest abhorrence the practice of slavery, and\r\n     shall not cease to seek its destruction, by all wise and prudent\r\n     means.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1797, the Discipline contained the following wholesome paragraph:--\r\n\r\n     \"The preachers and other members of our Society are requested to\r\n     consider the subject of negro slavery, with deep attention, and that\r\n     they impart to the General Conference, through the medium of the\r\n     Yearly Conferences, or otherwise, any important thoughts on the\r\n     subject, that the Conference may have full light, in order to take\r\n     further steps towards eradicating this enormous evil from that part\r\n     of the Church of God with which they are connected. The Annual\r\n     Conferences are directed to draw up addresses for the gradual\r\n     emancipation of the slaves, to the legislatures of those States in\r\n     which no general laws have been passed for that purpose. These\r\n     addresses shall urge, in the most respectful but pointed manner, the\r\n     necessity of a law for the gradual emancipation of slaves. Proper\r\n     committees shall be appointed by the Annual Conferences, out of the\r\n     most respectable of our friends, for conducting the business; and\r\n     presiding elders, elders, deacons, and traveling preachers, shall\r\n     procure as many proper signatures as possible to the addresses, and\r\n     give all the assistance in their power, in every respect, to aid the\r\n     committees, and to forward the blessed undertaking. Let this be\r\n     continued from year to year, till the desired end be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHOLIC TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nIt has been only about twenty years since Pope Gregory XVI. immortalized\r\nhimself by issuing the famous Bull against slavery, from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"Placed as we are on the Supreme seat of the apostles, and acting,\r\n     though by no merits of our own, as the vicegerent of Jesus Christ,\r\n     the Son of God, who, through his great mercy, condescended to make\r\n     himself man, and to die for the redemption of the world, we regard as\r\n     a duty devolving on our pastoral functions, that we endeavor to turn\r\n     aside our faithful flocks entirely from the inhuman traffic in\r\n     negroes, or any other human beings whatever. * * * In progress of\r\n     time, as the clouds of heathen superstition became gradually\r\n     dispersed, circumstances reached that point, that during several\r\n     centuries there were no slaves allowed amongst the great majority of\r\n     the Christian nations; but with grief we are compelled to add, that\r\n     there afterwards arose, even among the faithful, a race of men, who,\r\n     basely blinded by the appetite and desire of sordid lucre, did not\r\n     hesitate to reduce, in remote regions of the earth, Indians, negroes,\r\n     and other wretched beings, to the misery of slavery; or, finding the\r\n     trade established and augmented, to assist the shameful crime of\r\n     others. Nor did many of the most glorious of the Roman Pontiffs omit\r\n     severely to reprove their conduct, as injurious to their souls'\r\n     health, and disgraceful to the Christian name. Among these may be\r\n     especially quoted the bull of Paul III., which bears the date of the\r\n     29th of May, 1537 addressed to the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo,\r\n     and another still more comprehensive, by Urban VIII., dated the 22d\r\n     of April, 1636, to the collector Jurius of the Apostolic chamber in\r\n     Portugal, most severely castigating by name those who presumed to\r\n     subject either East or West Indians to slavery, to sell, buy,\r\n     exchange, or give them away, to separate them from their wives and\r\n     children, despoil them of their goods and property, to bring or\r\n     transmit them to other places, or by any means to deprive them of\r\n     liberty, or retain them in slavery; also most severely castigating\r\n     those who should presume or dare to afford council, aid, favor or\r\n     assistance, under any pretext, or borrowed color, to those doing the\r\n     aforesaid; or should preach or teach that it is lawful, or should\r\n     otherwise presume or dare to co-operate, by any possible means, with\r\n     the aforesaid. * * * Wherefore, we, desiring to divert this disgrace\r\n     from the whole confines of Christianity, having summoned several of\r\n     our venerable brothers, their Eminences the Cardinals, of the H. R.\r\n     Church, to our council, and, having maturely deliberated on the whole\r\n     matter, pursuing the footsteps of our predecessors, admonished by our\r\n     apostolical authority, and urgently invoke in the Lord, all\r\n     Christians, of whatever condition, that none henceforth dare to\r\n     subject to slavery, unjustly persecute, or despoil of their goods,\r\n     Indians, negroes, or other classes of men, or be accessories to\r\n     others, or furnish them aid or assistance in so doing; and on no\r\n     account henceforth to exercise that inhuman traffic by which negroes\r\n     are reduced to slavery, as if they were not men, but automata or\r\n     chattels, and are sold in defiance of all the laws of justice and\r\n     humanity, and devoted to severe and intolerable labors. We further\r\n     reprobate, by our apostolical authority, all the above-described\r\n     offences as utterly unworthy of the Christian name; and by the same\r\n     authority we rigidly prohibit and interdict all and every individual,\r\n     whether ecclesiastical or laical, from presuming to defend that\r\n     commerce in negro slaves under pretence or borrowed color, or to\r\n     teach or publish in any manner, publicly or privately, things\r\n     contrary to the admonitions which we have given in these letters.\r\n\r\n     \"And, finally, that these, our letters, may be rendered more apparent\r\n     to all, and that no person may allege any ignorance thereof, we\r\n     decree and order that it shall be published according to custom, and\r\n     copies thereof be properly affixed to the gates of St. Peter and of\r\n     the Apostolic Chancel, every and in like manner to the General Court\r\n     of Mount Citatorio, and in the field of the Campus Florae and also\r\n     through the city, by one of our heralds, according to aforesaid\r\n     custom.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at Rome, at the Palace of Santa Maria Major, under the seal of\r\n     the fisherman, on the 3d day of December, 1837, and in the ninth year\r\n     of our pontificate.\r\n\r\n     \"Countersigned by Cardinal A. Lambruschini.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already quoted the language of Pope Leo X., who says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Not only does the Christian religion, but nature herself cry out\r\n     against the State of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Raynal says:--\r\n\r\n     \"He who supports slavery is the enemy of the human race. He divides\r\n     it into two societies of legal assassins, the oppressors and the\r\n     oppressed. I shall not be afraid to cite to the tribunal of reason\r\n     and justice those governments which tolerate this cruelty, or which\r\n     even are not ashamed to make it the basis of their power.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the proceedings of a Massachusetts Anti-slavery Convention in 1855,\r\nwe make the following extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"Henry Kemp, a Roman Catholic, came forward to defend the Romish\r\n     Church in reply to Mr. Foster. He claimed that the Catholic Church is\r\n     thoroughly anti-slavery--as thoroughly as even his friend Foster.\"\r\n\r\nThus manfully do men of pure hearts and noble minds, whether in Church or\r\nState, and without regard to sect or party, lift up their voices against\r\nthe wicked and pernicious institution of human slavery. Thus they speak,\r\nand thus they are obliged to speak, if they speak at all; it is only the\r\nvoice of Nature, Justice, Truth, and Love, that issues from them. The\r\ndivine principle in man prompts him to speak and strike for Freedom; the\r\ndiabolical principle within him prompts him to speak and strike for\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nFrom those churches which are now--as all churches ought to be, and will\r\nbe, ere the world becomes Christianized--thoroughly imbued with the\r\nprinciples of freedom, we do not, as already intimated, deem it\r\nparticularly necessary to bring forward new arguments in opposition to\r\nslavery. If, however, the reader would be pleased to hear from the\r\nchurches to which we chiefly allude--and, by the bye, he might hear from\r\nthem with much profit to himself--we respectfully refer him to Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, George B. Cheever, Joseph P. Thompson, Theodore Parker, E. H.\r\nChapin, and H. W. Bellows, of the North, and to M. D. Conway, John G. Fee,\r\nJames S. Davis, Daniel Wilson, and W. E. Lincoln, of the South. All these\r\nreverend gentlemen, ministers of different denominations, feel it their\r\nduty to preach against slavery, and, to their honor be it said, they do\r\npreach against it with unabated zeal and success. Our earnest prayer is,\r\nthat Heaven may enable them, their cotemporaries and successors, to preach\r\nagainst it with such energy and effect, as will cause it to disappear\r\nforever from the soil of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBIBLE TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery person who has read the Bible, and who has a proper understanding of\r\nits leading moral precepts, feels, in his own conscience, that it is the\r\nonly original and complete anti-slavery text-book. In a crude state of\r\nsociety--in a barbarous age--when men were in a manner destitute of\r\nwholesome laws, either human or divine, it is possible that a mild form of\r\nslavery may have been tolerated, and even regulated, as an institution\r\nclothed with the importance of temporary recognition; but the Deity never\r\napproved it, and, for the very reason that it is impossible for him to do\r\nwrong, he never will, never can approve it. The worst system of servitude\r\nof which we have any account in the Bible--and, by the way, it furnishes\r\nno account of anything so bad as slavery (the evil-one and his hot home\r\nalone excepted)--was far less rigorous and atrocious than that now\r\nestablished in the Southern States of this Confederacy. Even that system,\r\nhowever, the worst, which seems to have been practiced to a considerable\r\nextent by those venerable old fogies, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, was one\r\nof the monstrous inventions of Satan that God \"winked\" at; and, to the\r\nmind of the biblical scholar, nothing can be more evident than that He\r\ndetermined of old, that it should, in due time, be abolished. To say that\r\nthe Bible sanctions slavery is to say that the sun loves darkness; to say\r\nthat one man was created to domineer over another is to call in question\r\nthe justice, mercy, and goodness of God.\r\n\r\nWe will now listen to a limited number of the\r\n\r\nPRECEPTS AND SAYINGS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.\r\n\r\n     \"Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants\r\n     thereof.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Let the oppressed go free.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person\r\n     of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night\r\n     until the morning.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Do justice to the afflicted and needy; rid them out of the hand of\r\n     the wicked.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Execute judgment and justice; take away your exactions from my\r\n     people, saith the Lord God.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore thus saith the Lord; ye have not hearkened unto me, in\r\n     proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his\r\n     neighbor: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to\r\n     the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you\r\n     to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n     \"He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his\r\n     hand, he shall surely be put to death.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry,\r\n     but shall not be heard.\"\r\n\r\n     \"He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the\r\n     adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that\r\n     oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and\r\n     that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith\r\n     the Lord of Hosts.\"\r\n\r\n     \"As the partridge setteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that\r\n     getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of\r\n     his days, and at his end shall be a fool.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now we will listen to a few selected\r\n\r\nPRECEPTS AND SAYINGS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.\r\n\r\n     \"Call no man master, neither be ye called masters.\"\r\n\r\n     \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even\r\n     so to them.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor\r\n     preferring one another.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Do good to all men, as ye have opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you\r\n     free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If thou mayest be made free, use it rather.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The laborer is worthy of his hire.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago a clerical lickspittle of the slave power had the temerity\r\nto publish a book or pamphlet entitled \"Bible Defence of Slavery,\" which\r\nthe Baltimore _Sun_, in the course of a caustic criticism, handled in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n     \"Bible defence of slavery! There is no such thing as a Bible defence\r\n     of slavery at the present day. Slavery in the United States is a\r\n     social institution, originating in the convenience and cupidity of\r\n     our ancestors, existing by State laws, and recognized to a certain\r\n     extent--for the recovery of slave property--by the Constitution. And\r\n     nobody would pretend that, if it were inexpedient and unprofitable\r\n     for any man or any State to continue to hold slaves, they would be\r\n     bound to do so on the ground of a \"Bible defence\" of it. Slavery is\r\n     recorded in the Bible, and approved, with many degrading\r\n     characteristics. War is recorded in the Bible, and approved, under\r\n     what seems to us the extreme of cruelty. But are slavery and war to\r\n     _endure_ for ever because we find them in the Bible? or are they to\r\n     _cease_ at once and for ever because the Bible inculcates peace and\r\n     brotherhood?\"\r\n\r\nThus, in the last five chapters inclusive, have we introduced a mass of\r\nanti-slavery arguments, human and divine, that will stand, irrefutable and\r\nconvincing, as long as the earth itself shall continue to revolve in its\r\norbit. Aside from unaffected truthfulness and candor, no merit is claimed\r\nfor anything we have said on our own account. With the best of motives,\r\nand in the language of nature more than that of art, we have simply given\r\nutterance to the honest convictions of our heart--being impelled to it by\r\na long-harbored and unmistakable sense of duty which grew stronger and\r\ndeeper as the days passed away.\r\n\r\nIf half the time which has been spent in collecting and arranging these\r\ntestimonies had been occupied in the composition of original matter, the\r\nweight of paper and binding and the number of pages would have been much\r\ngreater, but the value and the effect of the contents would have been far\r\nless. From the first, our leading motive has been to convince our\r\nfellow-citizens of the South, non-slaveholders and slaveholders, that\r\nslavery, whether considered in all its bearings, or, setting aside the\r\nmoral aspect of the question, and looking at it in only a pecuniary point\r\nof view, is impolitic, unprofitable, and degrading; how well, thus far, we\r\nhave succeeded in our undertaking, time will, perhaps, fully disclose.\r\n\r\nIn the words of a contemporaneous German writer, whose language we readily\r\nand heartily endorse, \"It is the shame of our age that argument is needed\r\nagainst slavery.\" Taking things as they are, however, argument being\r\nneeded, we have offered it; and we have offered it from such sources as\r\nwill, in our honest opinion, confound the devil and his incarnate\r\nconfederates.\r\n\r\nThese testimonies, culled from the accumulated wisdom of nearly six\r\nthousand centuries, beginning with the great and good men of our own time,\r\nand running back through distant ages to Saint Paul, Saint John, and Saint\r\nLuke, to Cicero, Plato, and Socrates, to Solomon, David, and Moses, and\r\neven to the Deity himself, are the pillars of strength and beauty upon\r\nwhich the popularity of our work will, in all probability, be principally\r\nbased. If the ablest writers of the Old Testament; if the eloquent\r\nprophets of old; if the renowned philosophers of Greece and Rome; if the\r\nheavenly-minded authors and compilers of the New Testament; if the\r\nillustrious poets and prose-writers, heroes, statesmen, sages of all\r\nnations, ancient and modern; if God himself and the hosts of learned\r\nministers whom he has commissioned to proclaim his word--if all these are\r\nwrong, then we are wrong; on the other hand, however, if they are right,\r\nwe are right; for, in effect, we only repeat and endeavor to enforce their\r\nprecepts.\r\n\r\nIf we are in error, we desire to be corrected; and, if it is not asking\r\ntoo much, we respectfully request the advocates of slavery to favor us\r\nwith an _expose_ of what they, in their one-sided view of things, conceive\r\nto be the advantages of their favorite and peculiar institution. Such an\r\n_expose_, if skillfully executed, would doubtless be regarded as the\r\nfunniest novel of the times--a fit production, if not too immoral in its\r\ntendencies, to be incorporated into the next edition of D'Israeli's\r\ncuriosities of literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFREE FIGURES AND SLAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this heading we propose to introduce the remainder of the more\r\nimportant statistics of the Free and of the Slave States;--especially\r\nthose that relate to Commerce, Manufactures, Internal Improvements,\r\nEducation and Religion. Originally it was our intention to devote a\r\nseparate chapter to each of the industrial and moral interests\r\nabove-named: but other considerations have so greatly encroached on our\r\nspace, that we are compelled to modify our design. To the thoughtful and\r\ndiscriminating reader, however, the chief statistics which follow will be\r\nnone the less interesting for not being the subjects of annotations.\r\n\r\nAt present, all we ask of pro-slavery men, no matter in what part of the\r\nworld they may reside, is to look these figures fairly in the face. We\r\nwish them to do it, in the first instance, not on the platforms of public\r\ndebate, where the exercise of eloquence is too often characterized by\r\nviolent passion and subterfuge, but in their own private apartments, where\r\nno eye save that of the All-seeing One will rest upon them, and where, in\r\nconsidering the relations which they sustain to the past, the present, and\r\nthe future, an opportunity will be afforded them of securing that most\r\nvaluable of all possessions attainable on earth, a conscience void of\r\noffence toward God and man.\r\n\r\nEach separate table or particular compilation of statistics will afford\r\nfood for at least an hour's profitable reflection; indeed, the more these\r\nfigures are studied, and the better they are understood, the sooner will\r\nthe author's object be accomplished,--the sooner will the genius of\r\nUniversal Liberty dispel the dark clouds of slavery.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

How often are\r\nour ears insulted with such wickedly false assertions as these! In what\r\ndegree of latitude--pray tell us--in what degree of latitude do the rays\r\nof the sun become too calorific for white men? Certainly in no part of the\r\nUnited States, for in the extreme South we find a very large number of\r\nnon-slaveholding whites over the age of fifteen, who derive their entire\r\nsupport from manual labor in the open fields. The sun, that bugbear of\r\nslaveholding demagogues, shone on more than one million of free white\r\nlaborers--mostly agriculturists--in the slave States in 1850, exclusive\r\nof those engaged in commerce, trade, manufactures, the mechanic arts, and\r\nmining. Yet, notwithstanding all these instances of exposure to his wrath,\r\nwe have had no intelligence whatever of a single case of _coup de\r\nso-leil_. Alabama is not too hot; sixty-seven thousand white sons of toil\r\ntill her soil. Mississippi is not too hot; fifty-five thousand free white\r\nlaborers are hopeful devotees of her out-door pursuits. Texas is not too\r\nhot; forty-seven thousand free white persons, males, over the age of\r\nfifteen, daily perform their rural vocations amidst her unsheltered air.\r\n\r\nIt is stated on good authority that, in January, 1856, native ice, three\r\ninches thick, was found in Galveston Bay; we have seen it ten inches thick\r\nin North Carolina, with the mercury in the thermometer at two degrees\r\nbelow zero. In January, 1857, while the snow was from three to five feet\r\ndeep in many parts of North Carolina, the thermometer indicated a degree\r\nof coldness seldom exceeded in any State in the Union--thirteen degrees\r\nbelow zero. The truth is, instead of its being too hot in the South for\r\nwhite men, it is too cold for negroes; and we long to see the day arrive\r\nwhen the latter shall have entirely receded from their uncongenial homes\r\nin America, and given full and undivided place to the former.\r\n\r\nToo hot in the South for white men! It is not too hot for white women.\r\nTime and again, in different counties in North Carolina, have we seen the\r\npoor white wife of the poor white husband, following him in the\r\nharvest-field from morning till night, binding up the grain as it fell\r\nfrom his cradle. In the immediate neighborhood from which we hail, there\r\nare not less than thirty young women, non-slaveholding whites, between\r\nthe ages of fifteen and twenty-five--some of whom are so well known to us\r\nthat we could call them by name--who labor in the fields every summer; two\r\nof them in particular, near neighbors to our mother, are in the habit of\r\nhiring themselves out during harvest-time, the very hottest season of the\r\nyear, to bind wheat and oats--each of them keeping up with the reaper; and\r\nthis for the paltry consideration of twenty-five cents per day.\r\n\r\nThat any respectable man--any man with a heart or a soul in his\r\ncomposition--can look upon these poor toiling white women without feeling\r\nindignant at that accursed system of slavery which has entailed on them\r\nthe miseries of poverty, ignorance, and degradation, we shall not do\r\nourself the violence to believe. If they and their husbands, and their\r\nsons and daughters, and brothers and sisters, are not righted in some of\r\nthe more important particulars in which they have been wronged, the fault\r\nshall lie at other doors than our own. In their behalf, chiefly, have we\r\nwritten and compiled this work; and until our object shall have been\r\naccomplished, or until life shall have been extinguished, there shall be\r\nno abatement in our efforts to aid them in regaining the natural and\r\ninalienable prerogatives out of which they have been so infamously\r\nswindled. We want to see no more plowing, or hoeing, or raking, or\r\ngrain-binding, by white women in the Southern States; employment in\r\ncotton-mills and other factories would be far more profitable and\r\ncongenial to them, and this they shall have within a short period after\r\nslavery shall have been abolished.\r\n\r\nToo hot in the South for white men! What is the testimony of reliable\r\nSouthrons themselves? Says Cassius M. Clay, of Kentucky:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the extreme South, at New Orleans, the laboring men--the\r\n     stevedores and hackmen on the levee, where the heat is intensified by\r\n     the proximity of the red brick buildings, are all white men, and they\r\n     are in the full enjoyment of health. But how about Cotton? I am\r\n     informed by a friend of mine--himself a slaveholder and therefore\r\n     good authority--that in Northwestern Texas, among the German\r\n     settlements, who true to their national instincts, will not employ\r\n     the labor of a slave--they produce more cotton to the acre, and of a\r\n     better quality, and selling at prices from a cent to a cent and a\r\n     half a pound higher than that produced by slave labor.\"\r\n\r\nSays Gov. Hammond, of South Carolina:--\r\n\r\n     \"The steady heat of our summers is not so prostrating as the short,\r\n     but frequent and sudden, bursts of Northern summers.\"\r\n\r\nIn an extract which may be found in our second chapter, and to which we\r\nrespectfully refer the reader, it will be seen that this same South\r\nCarolinian, speaking of \"not less than fifty thousand\" non-slaveholding\r\nwhites, says--\"most of these now follow agricultural pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Cartwright of New Orleans:--\r\n\r\n     \"Here in New Orleans, the larger part of the drudgery--work requiring\r\n     exposure to the sun, as railroad-making, street-paving, dray-driving,\r\n     ditching and building, is performed by white people.\"\r\n\r\nTo the statistical tables which show the number of deaths in the free and\r\nin the slave States in 1850, we would direct special attention. Those\r\npersons, particularly the propogandists of negro slavery, who,\r\nheretofore, have been so dreadfully exercised on account of what they have\r\nbeen pleased to term \"the insalubrity of Southern climes,\" will there find\r\nsomething to allay their fearful apprehensions. A critical examination of\r\nsaid tables will disclose the fact that, in proportion to population,\r\ndeaths occur more frequently in Massachusetts than in any Southern State\r\nexcept Louisiana; more frequently in New York than in any of the Southern\r\nStates, except Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas; more\r\nfrequently in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania, and in Ohio, than in either\r\nGeorgia, Florida, or Alabama. Leaving Wisconsin and Louisiana out of the\r\naccount, and then comparing the bills of mortality in the remaining\r\nNorthern States, with those in the remaining Southern States, we find the\r\ndifference decidedly in favor of the latter; for, according to this\r\ncalculation, while the ratio of deaths is as only one to 74.60 of the\r\nliving population in the Southern States, it is as one to 72.39 in the\r\nNorthern.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. J. C. Nott, of Mobile:--\r\n\r\n     \"Heat, moisture, animal and vegetable matter are said to be the\r\n     elements which produce the diseases of the South, and yet the\r\n     testimony in proof of the health of the banks of the lower portion of\r\n     the Mississippi River, is too strong to be doubted,--not only the\r\n     river itself but also the numerous bayous which meander through\r\n     Louisiana. Here is a perfectly flat alluvial country, covering\r\n     several hundred miles, interspersed with interminable lakes, lagunes\r\n     and jungles, and still we are informed by Dr. Cartwright, one of the\r\n     most acute observers of the day, that this country is exempt from\r\n     miasmatic disorders, and is extremely healthy. His assertion has been\r\n     confirmed to me by hundreds of witnesses, and we know from our own\r\n     observation, that the population present a robust and healthy\r\n     appearance.\"\r\n\r\nBut the best part is yet to come. In spite of all the blatant assertions\r\nof the oligarchy, that the climate of the South was arranged expressly for\r\nthe negroes, and that the negroes were created expressly to inhabit it as\r\nthe healthful servitors of other men, a carefully kept register of all the\r\ndeaths that occurred in Charleston, South Carolina, for the space of six\r\nyears, shows that, even in that locality which is generally regarded as so\r\nunhealthy, the annual mortality was much greater among the blacks, in\r\nproportion to population, than among the whites. Dr. Nott himself shall\r\nstate the facts. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The average mortality for the last six years in Charleston for all\r\n     ages is 1 in 51, including all classes. Blacks alone 1 in 44; whites\r\n     alone, 1 in 58--a very remarkable result, certainly. This mortality\r\n     is perhaps not an unfair test, as the population during the last six\r\n     years has been undisturbed by emigration and acclimated in a greater\r\n     proportion than at any former period.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous other authorities might be cited in proof of the general\r\nhealthiness of the climate south of Mason and Dixon's line. Of 127\r\nremarkable cases of American longevity, published in a recent edition of\r\nBlake's Biographical Dictionary, 68 deceased centenarians are credited to\r\nthe Southern States, and 59 to the Northern--the list being headed with\r\nBetsey Trantham, of Tennessee--a white woman, who died in 1834, at the\r\nextraordinarily advanced age of 154 years.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

From\r\nthe South the tide of emigration still flows in a westerly and\r\nnorth-westerly direction, and it will continue to do so until slavery is\r\nabolished. The following remarks, which we extract from an editorial\r\narticle that appeared in the Memphis (Tenn.) _Bulletin_ near the close of\r\nthe year 1856, are worth considering in this connection:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have never before observed so large a number of immigrants going\r\n     westward as are crossing the river at this point daily, the two ferry\r\n     boats--sometimes three--going crowded from early morn until the boats\r\n     cease making their trips at night. It is no uncommon sight to see\r\n     from twenty to forty wagons encamped on the bluff for the night,\r\n     notwithstanding there has been a steady stream going across the river\r\n     all day, and yet the cry is, still they come.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Cassville (Geo.) _Standard_ spoke with surprise of\r\nthe multitude of emigrants crowding the streets of that town bound for the\r\nfar West.\r\n\r\nProf. B. S. Hedrick, late of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Of my neighbors, friends and kindred, nearly one-half have left the\r\n     State since I was old enough to remember. Many is the time I have\r\n     stood by the loaded emigrant wagon, and given the parting hand to\r\n     those whose faces I was never to look upon again. They were going to\r\n     seek homes in the free West, knowing, as they did, that free and\r\n     slave labor could not both exist and prosper in the same community.\r\n     If any one thinks that I speak without knowledge, let him refer to\r\n     the last census. He will there find that in 1850 there were\r\n     fifty-eight thousand native North Carolinians living in the free\r\n     States of the West--thirty-three-thousand in Indiana alone. There\r\n     were, at the same time, one hundred and eighty thousand Virginians\r\n     living in the free States. Now, if these people were so much in love\r\n     with the 'institution,' why did they not remain where they could\r\n     enjoy its blessings?\r\n\r\n     \"From my knowledge of the people of North Carolina, I believe that\r\n     the majority of them who will go to Kansas during the next five\r\n     years, would prefer that it should be a free State. I am sure that if\r\n     I were to go there I should vote to exclude slavery.\"\r\n\r\nFor daring to have political opinions of his own, and because he did not\r\ndeem it his duty to conceal the fact that he loved liberty better than\r\nslavery, the gallant author of the extract above quoted was peremptorily\r\ndismissed from his post of analytical and agricultural chemist in the\r\nUniversity of North Carolina, ignominiously subjected to the indignities\r\nof a mob, and then savagely driven beyond the borders of his native State.\r\nHis villainous persecutors, if not called to settle their accounts in\r\nanother world within the next ten years, will probably survive to repent\r\nof the enormity of their pro-slavery folly.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

He gave, but a short time since, at the Kansas\r\n     relief meeting in Albany, $3,000. Prior to that, he had sent about\r\n     $1,000 to the Boston Emigrant Committee. Out of his own funds, he\r\n     subsequently equipped a Madison county company, of one hundred picked\r\n     men, and paid their expenses to Kansas. At Syracuse he subscribed\r\n     $10,000 for Abolition purposes, so that his entire contributions\r\n     amount to at least $40,000.\"\r\n\r\nAn Eastern paper says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The sum of $500 was contributed at a meeting at New Bedford on\r\n     Monday evening, to make Kansas free. The following sums have been\r\n     contributed for the same purpose: $2,000 in Taunton: $600 in Raynham:\r\n     $800 in Clinton: $300 in Danbury, Ct. In Wisconsin, $2,500 at\r\n     Janesville: $500 at Dalton: $500 at the Women's Aid Meeting in\r\n     Chicago: $2,000 in Rockford, Ill.\"\r\n\r\nA telegraphic dispatch, dated Boston, January 2, 1857, informs us that--\r\n\r\n     \"The Secretary of the Kansas Aid Committee acknowledges the receipt\r\n     of $42,678.\"\r\n\r\nExclusive of the amounts above, the readers of the New-York _Tribune_\r\nhave contributed about $30,000 for the purpose of securing Kansas to\r\nFreedom; and, with the same object in view, other individuals and\r\nsocieties have, from time to time, made large contributions, of which we\r\nhave failed to keep a memorandum. The legislature of Vermont has\r\nappropriated $20,000; and other free State legislatures are prepared to\r\nappropriate millions, if necessary. Free men have determined that Kansas\r\nshall be free, and free it soon shall be, and ever so remain. Harmoniously\r\nthe work proceeds.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how slavery has rewarded the poor, ignorant, deluded, and\r\ndegraded mortals--swaggering lickspittles--who have labored so hard to\r\ngain for it \"a local habitation and a name\" in the disputed territory. One\r\nD. B. Atchison, Chairman of the Executive Committee of Border Ruffians,\r\nshall tell us all about it. Over date of October 13th, 1856, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Up to this moment, from all the States except Missouri, we have only\r\n     received the following sums, and through the following persons:--\r\n\r\n        A. W. Jones, Houston, Miss.,       $152\r\n        H. D. Clayton, Eufala, Ala.,        500\r\n        Capt. Deedrick, South Carolina,     500\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                         $1,152.\"\r\n\r\nOn this subject, further comment is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nNumerous other contrasts, equally disproportionate, might be drawn between\r\nthe vigor and munificence of freedom and the impotence and stinginess of\r\nslavery. We will, however, in addition to the above, advert to only a\r\nsingle instance. During the latter part of the summer of 1855, the\r\ncitizens of the niggervilles of Norfolk and Portsmouth, in Virginia, were\r\nsorely plagued with yellow fever. Many of them fell victims to the\r\ndisease, and most of those who survived, and who were not too unwell to\r\ntravel, left their homes, horror-stricken and dejected. To the horror of\r\nmankind in general, and to the glory of freemen in particular,\r\ncontributions in money, provisions, clothing, and other valuable supplies,\r\npoured in from all parts of the country, for the relief of the sufferers.\r\nPortsmouth alone, according to the report of her relief association,\r\nreceived $42,547 in cash from the free States, and only $12,182 in cash\r\nfrom all the slave States, exclusive of Virginia, within whose borders the\r\nmalady prevailed. Including Virginia, the sum total of all the slave State\r\ncontributions amounted to only $33,398. Well did the Richmond _Examiner_\r\nremark at the time--\"we fear that generosity of Virginians is but a figure\r\nof speech.\" Slavery! thy name is shame!\r\n\r\nIn connection with tables 44 and 45 on page 292, it will be well to\r\nexamine the following statistics of Congressional representation, which we\r\ntranscribe from Reynold's Political Map of the United States;--\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE.\r\n\r\n     16 free States, with a white population of 13,238,670, have 32\r\n     Senators.\r\n\r\n     15 slave States, with a white population of 6,186,477, have 30\r\n     Senators.\r\n\r\n     So that 413,708 free men of the North enjoy but the same political\r\n     privileges in the U. S. Senate as is given to 206,215 slave\r\n     propagandists.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n     The free States have a total of 144 members.\r\n\r\n     The slave States have a total of 90 members.\r\n\r\n     One free State Representative represents 91,935 white men and women.\r\n\r\n     One slave State Representative represents 68,725 white men and women.\r\n\r\n     Slave Representation gives to slavery an advantage over freedom of 30\r\n     votes in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM-HOUSE RECEIPTS.--1854.\r\n\r\n  Free States,                                        $60,010,489\r\n  Slave States,                                         5,136,969\r\n                                                      -----------\r\n  Balance in favor of the Free States,                $54,873,520\r\n\r\nA contrast quite distinguishable!\r\n\r\nThat the apologists of slavery cannot excuse the shame and the shabbiness\r\nof themselves and their country, as we have frequently heard them attempt\r\nto do, by falsely asserting that the North has enjoyed over the South the\r\nadvantages of priority of settlement, will fully appear from the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\nFREE STATES.\r\n\r\n  1614. New-York first settled by the Dutch.\r\n  1620. Massachusetts settled by the Puritans.\r\n  1623. New-Hampshire settled by the Puritans.\r\n  1624. New-Jersey settled by the Dutch.\r\n  1635.

Maryland settled by Irish Catholics.\r\n  1650. North Carolina settled by the English.\r\n  1670. South Carolina settled by the Huguenots.\r\n  1733. Georgia settled by Gen. Oglethorpe.\r\n  1782.

Texas admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an exceedingly interesting article on the early\r\nsettlements in America, R. K. Browne, formerly editor and proprietor of\r\nthe San Francisco _Evening Journal_, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Many people seem to think that the Pilgrim Fathers were the first\r\n     who settled upon our shores, and therefore that they ought to be\r\n     entitled, in a particular manner, to our remembrance and esteem.\r\n\r\n     \"This is not the case, and we herewith present to our readers a list\r\n     of settlements made in the present United States, prior to that of\r\n     Plymouth:\r\n\r\n     1564. A Colony of French Protestants under Ribault settled in\r\n     Florida.\r\n\r\n     1565. St. Augustine[8] founded by Pedro Melendez.\r\n\r\n     1584. Sir Walter Raleigh obtains a patent and sends two vessels to\r\n     the American coast, which receives the name of Virginia.\r\n\r\n     1607. The first effectual settlement made at Jamestown, Va., by the\r\n     London Company.\r\n\r\n     1614. A fort erected by the Dutch upon the site of New-York.\r\n\r\n     1615. Fort Orange built near the site of Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\n     1619. The first General Assembly called in Virginia.\r\n\r\n     1620. The Pilgrims land on Plymouth Rock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM AND SLAVERY AT THE FAIR.\r\n\r\nWHAT FREEDOM DID.\r\n\r\nAt an Agricultural Fair held at Watertown, in the State of New-York, on\r\nthe 2d day of October, 1856, two hundred and twenty premiums, ranging from\r\nthree to fifty dollars each, were awarded to successful competitors--the\r\naggregate amount of said premiums being $2,396, or an average of $10.89\r\neach.

While examining these figures, it should be recollected\r\nthat agriculture is the peculiar province of the slave States. If commerce\r\nor manufactures had been the subject of the fair, the result might have\r\nshown even a greater disproportion in favor of freedom, and yet there\r\nwould have been some excuse for slavery, for it makes no pretensions to\r\neither the one or the other; but as agriculture was the subject, slavery\r\ncan have no excuse whatever, but must bear all the shame of its niggardly\r\nand revolting impotence; this it must do for the reason that agriculture\r\nis its special and almost only pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Comptrollers of the States of New York and North\r\nCarolina, for the year 1856, are now before us. From each report we have\r\ngleaned a single item, which, when compared, the one with the other,\r\nspeaks volumes in favor of freedom and against slavery. We refer to the\r\naverage value per acre of lands in the two States; let slavocrats read,\r\nreflect, and repent.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, there were assessed for taxation in the State of\r\n\r\nNEW YORK,\r\n\r\n  Acres of land              30,080,000\r\n  Valued at              $1,112,133,136\r\n  Average value per acre         $36.97\r\n\r\nIn 1856, there were assessed for taxation in the State of\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA,\r\n\r\n  Acres of land              32,450,560\r\n  Valued at                 $98,800,636\r\n  Average value per acre          $3.06\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us to make any remarks on the official facts above.\r\nOur indignation is struck almost dumb at this astounding and revolting\r\ndisplay of the awful wreck that slavery is leaving behind it in the South.\r\nWe will however, go into a calculation for the purpose of ascertaining as\r\nnearly as possible, in this one particular, how much North Carolina has\r\nlost by the retention of slavery. As we have already seen, the average\r\nvalue per acre of land in the State of New York is $36.97; in North\r\nCarolina it is only $3.06; why is it so much less, or even any less, in\r\nthe latter than in the former? The answer is, _slavery_. In soil, in\r\nclimate, in minerals, in water-power for manufactural purposes, and in\r\narea of territory, North Carolina has the advantage of New York, and, with\r\nthe exception of slavery, no plausible reason can possibly be assigned why\r\nland should not be _at least_ as valuable in the valley of the Yadkin as\r\nit is along the banks of the Genesee.\r\n\r\nThe difference between $36.97 and $3.06 is $33.91, which, multiplied by\r\nthe whole number of acres of land in North Carolina, will show, in this\r\none particular, the enormous loss that Freedom has sustained on account of\r\nSlavery in the Old North State. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  32,450,560 acres _a_ $33,91     $1,100,398,489.\r\n\r\nLet it be indelibly impressed on the mind, however, that this amount,\r\nlarge as it is, is only a moity of the sum that it has cost to maintain\r\nslavery in North Carolina. From time to time, hundreds upon hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars have left the State, either in search of profitable,\r\npermanent investment abroad, or in the shape of profits to Northern\r\nmerchants and manufactures, who have become the moneyed aristocracy of the\r\ncountry by supplying to the South such articles of necessity, utility, and\r\nadornment, as would have been produced at home but for the pernicious\r\npresence of the peculiar institution.\r\n\r\nA reward of Eleven Hundred Millions of Dollars is offered for the\r\nconversion of the lands of North Carolina into free soil. The lands\r\nthemselves, desolate and impoverished under the fatal foot of slavery,\r\noffer the reward. How, then, can it be made to appear that the abolition\r\nof slavery in North Carolina, and, indeed, throughout all the Southern\r\nStates--for slavery is exceedingly inimical to them all--is not demanded\r\nby every consideration of justice, prudence, and good sense? In 1850, the\r\ntotal value of all the slaves of the State, at the rate of four hundred\r\ndollars per head, amounted to less than one hundred and sixteen millions\r\nof dollars. Is the sum of one hundred and sixteen millions of dollars more\r\ndesirable than the sum of eleven hundred millions of dollars? When a man\r\nhas land for sale, does he reject thirty-six dollars per acre and take\r\nthree? Non-slaveholding whites! look well to your interests! Many of you\r\nhave lands; comparatively speaking, you have nothing else. Abolish\r\nslavery, and you will enhance the value of every league, your own and your\r\nneighbors', from three to thirty-six dollars per acre. Your little tract\r\ncontaining two hundred acres, now valued at the pitiful sum of only six\r\nhundred dollars, will then be worth seven thousand. Your children, now\r\ndeprived of even the meagre advantages of common schools, will then reap\r\nthe benefits of a collegiate education. Your rivers and smaller streams,\r\nnow wasting their waters in idleness, will then turn the wheels of\r\nmultitudinous mills. Your bays and harbors, now unknown to commerce, will\r\nthen swarm with ships from every enlightened quarter of the globe.\r\nNon-slaveholding whites! look well to your interests!\r\n\r\nWould the slaveholders of North Carolina lose anything by the abolition of\r\nslavery? Let us see. According to their own estimate, their slaves are\r\nworth, in round numbers, say, one hundred and twenty millions of dollars.\r\nThere are in the State twenty-eight thousand slaveholders, owning, it may\r\nbe safely assumed, an average of at least five hundred acres of land\r\neach--fourteen millions of acres in all. This number of acres, multiplied\r\nby thirty-three dollars and ninety-one cents, the difference in value\r\nbetween free soil and slave soil, makes the enormous sum of four hundred\r\nand seventy-four millions of dollars--showing that, by the abolition of\r\nslavery, the slaveholders themselves would realize a net profit of not\r\nless than three hundred and fifty-four millions of dollars!\r\n\r\nCompensation to slaveholders for the negroes now in their possession! The\r\nidea is preposterous. The suggestion is criminal. The demand is unjust,\r\nwicked, monstrous, damnable. Shall we pat the bloodhounds of slavery for\r\nthe sake of doing them a favor? Shall we fee the curs of slavery in order\r\nto make them rich at our expense? Shall we pay the whelps of slavery for\r\nthe privilege of converting them into decent, honest, upright men? No,\r\nnever! The non-slaveholders expect to gain, and will gain, something by\r\nthe abolition of slavery; but slaveholders themselves will, by far, be the\r\ngreater gainers; for, in proportion to population, they own much larger\r\nand more fertile tracts of land, and will, as a matter of course, receive\r\nthe lion's share of the increase in the value of not only real estate, but\r\nalso of other genuine property, of which they are likewise the principal\r\nowners. How ridiculously absurd, therefore, is the objection, that, if we\r\nliberate the slaves, we ruin the masters! Not long since, a gentleman in\r\nBaltimore, a native of Maryland, remarked in our presence that he was an\r\nabolitionist because he felt that it was right and proper to be one;\r\n\"but,\" inquired he, \"are there not, in some of the States, many widows and\r\norphans who would be left in destitute circumstances, if their negroes\r\nwere taken from them?\" In answer to the question, we replied that slavery\r\nhad already reduced thousands and tens of thousands of non-slaveholding\r\nwidows and orphans to the lowest depths of poverty and ignorance, and that\r\nwe did not believe one slaveholding widow and three orphans were of more,\r\nor even of as much consequence as five non-slaveholding widows and fifteen\r\norphans. \"You are right,\" exclaimed the gentleman, \"I had not viewed the\r\nsubject in that light before; I perceive you go in for the greatest good\r\nto the greatest number.\" Emancipate the negroes, and the ex-slaveholding\r\nwidow would still retain her lands and tenements, which, in consequence of\r\nbeing surrounded by the magic influences of liberty, would soon render her\r\nfar more wealthy and infinitely more respectable, than she could possibly\r\never become while trafficking in human flesh.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, every slave in the South costs the State in which he resides\r\nat least three times as much as he, in the whole course of his life, is\r\nworth to his master. Slavery benefits no one but its immediate, individual\r\nowners, and them only in a pecuniary point of view, and at the sacrifice\r\nof the dearest rights and interests of the whole mass of non-slaveholders,\r\nwhite and black. Even the masters themselves, as we have already shown,\r\nwould be far better off without it than with it. To all classes of society\r\nthe institution is a curse; an especial curse is it to those who own it\r\nnot. Non-slaveholding whites! look well to your interests!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CITIES--SOUTHERN COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur theme is a city--a great Southern importing, exporting, and\r\nmanufacturing city, to be located at some point or port on the coast of\r\nthe Carolinas, Georgia or Virginia, where we can carry on active commerce,\r\nbuy, sell, fabricate, receive the profits which accrue from the exchange\r\nof our own commodities, open facilities for direct communication with\r\nforeign countries, and establish all those collateral sources of wealth,\r\nutility, and adornment, which are the usual concomitants of a metropolis,\r\nand which add so very materially to the interest and importance of a\r\nnation. Without a city of this kind, the South can never develop her\r\ncommercial resources nor attain to that eminent position to which those\r\nvast resources would otherwise exalt her. According to calculations based\r\nupon reasonable estimates, it is owing to the lack of a great commercial\r\ncity in the South, that we are now _annually_ drained of more than One\r\nHundred and Twenty Millions of Dollars! We should, however, take into\r\nconsideration the negative loss as well as the positive. Especially should\r\nwe think of the influx of emigrants, of the visits of strangers and\r\ncosmopolites, of the patronage to hotels and public halls, of the profits\r\nof travel and transportation, of the emoluments of foreign and domestic\r\ntrade, and of numerous other advantages which have their origin\r\nexclusively in wealthy, enterprising, and densely populated cities.\r\n\r\nNothing is more evident than the fact, that our people have never\r\nentertained a proper opinion of the importance of home cities. Blindly,\r\nand greatly to our own injury, we have contributed hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars towards the erection of mammoth cities at the North, while our own\r\nmagnificent bays and harbors have been most shamefully disregarded and\r\nneglected. Now, instead of carrying all our money to New-York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and Cincinnati, suppose we had kept it on the south\r\nside of Mason and Dixon's line--as we would have done, had it not been for\r\nslavery--and had disbursed it in the upbuilding of Norfolk, Beaufort,\r\nCharleston, or Savannah, how much richer, better, greater, would the South\r\nhave been to-day! How much larger and more intelligent would have been our\r\npopulation. How many hundred thousand natives of the South would now be\r\nthriving at home, instead of adding to the wealth and political power of\r\nother parts of the Union. How much greater would be the number and length\r\nof our railroads, canals, turnpikes, and telegraphs. How much greater\r\nwould be the extent and diversity of our manufactures. How much greater\r\nwould be the grandeur, and how much larger would be the number of our\r\nchurches, theatres, schools, colleges, lyceums, banks, hotels, stores, and\r\nprivate dwellings. How many more clippers and steamships would we have\r\nsailing on the ocean, how vastly more reputable would we be abroad, how\r\ninfinitely more respectable, progressive, and happy, would we be at home.\r\n\r\nThat we may learn something of the importance of cities in general, let us\r\nlook for a moment at the great capitals of the world. What would England\r\nbe without London? What would France be without Paris? What would Turkey\r\nbe without Constantinople? Or, to come nearer home, what would Maryland be\r\nwithout Baltimore? What would Louisiana be without New Orleans? What would\r\nSouth Carolina be without Charleston? Do we ever think of these countries\r\nor States without thinking of their cities also? If we want to learn the\r\nnews of the country, do we not go to the city, or to the city papers?\r\nEvery metropolis may be regarded as the nucleus or epitome of the country\r\nin which it is situated; and the more prominent features and\r\ncharacteristics of a country, particularly of the people of a country, are\r\nalmost always to be seen within the limits of its capital city. Almost\r\ninvariably do we find the bulk of the floating funds, the best talent, and\r\nthe most vigorous energies of a nation concentrated in its chief cities;\r\nand does not this concentration of wealth, energy, and talent, conduce, in\r\nan extraordinary degree, to the growth and prosperity of the nation?\r\nUnquestionably. Wealth develops wealth, energy develops energy, talent\r\ndevelops talent. What, then, must be the condition of those countries\r\nwhich do not possess the means or facilities of centralizing their\r\nmaterial forces, their energies, and their talents? Are they not destined\r\nto occupy an inferior rank among the nations of the earth? Let the South\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us ask, and we would put the question particularly to Southern\r\nmerchants, what do we so much need as a great Southern metropolis?\r\nMerchants of the South, slaveholders! you are the avaricious assassinators\r\nof your country! You are the channels through which more than one hundred\r\nand twenty millions of dollars--$120,000,000--are annually drained from\r\nthe South and conveyed to the North. You are daily engaged in the unmanly\r\nand unpatriotic work of impoverishing the land of your birth. You are\r\nconstantly enfeebling our resources and rendering us more and more\r\ntributary to distant parts of the nation. Your conduct is reprehensible,\r\nbase, criminal.\r\n\r\nWhether Southern merchants ever think of the numerous ways in which they\r\ncontribute to the aggrandizement of the North, while, at the same time,\r\nthey enervate and dishonor the South, has, for many years, with us, been a\r\nmatter of more than ordinary conjecture. If, as it would seem, they have\r\nnever yet thought of the subject, it is certainly desirable that they\r\nshould exercise their minds upon it at once. Let them scrutinize the\r\nworkings of Southern money after it passes north of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline. Let them consider how much they pay to Northern railroads and\r\nhotels, how much to Northern merchants and shop-keepers, how much to\r\nNorthern shippers and insurers, how much to Northern theatres, newspapers,\r\nand periodicals. Let them also consider what disposition is made of it\r\nafter it is lodged in the hands of the North. Is not the greater part of\r\nit paid out to Northern manufacturers, mechanics, and laborers, for the\r\nvery articles which are purchased at the North--and to the extent that\r\nthis is done, are not Northern manufacturers, mechanics, and laborers\r\ndirectly countenanced and encouraged, while at the same time, Southern\r\nmanufacturers, mechanics, and laborers, are indirectly abased, depressed,\r\nand disabled? It is, however, a matter of impossibility, on these small\r\npages, to notice or enumerate all the methods in which the money we\r\ndeposit in the North is made to operate against us; suffice it to say that\r\nit is circulated and expended there, among all classes of the people, to\r\nthe injury and impoverishment of almost every individual in the South. And\r\nyet, our cousins of the North are not, by any means, blameworthy for\r\navailing themselves of the advantages which we have voluntarily yielded to\r\nthem. They have shown their wisdom in growing great at our expense, and we\r\nhave shown our folly in allowing them to do so. Southern merchants,\r\nslaveholders, and slave-breeders, should be the objects of our censure;\r\nthey have desolated and impoverished the South; they are now making\r\nmerchandize of the vitals of their country; patriotism is a word nowhere\r\nrecorded in their vocabulary; town, city, country--they care for neither;\r\nwith them, self is always paramount to every other consideration.\r\n\r\nHaving already compared slavery with freedom in the States, we will now\r\ncompare it with freedom in the cities. From every person as yet\r\nunconvinced of the despicableness of slavery, we respectfully ask\r\nattention to the following letters, which fully explain themselves:--\r\n\r\n     FINANCE DEPARTMENT COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE,}\r\n     New-York, February 17th, 1857.          }\r\n\r\n     H.

HELPER,\r\n\r\n     New-York:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--\r\n\r\n     In answer to your note of the 24th December, I beg to refer you to\r\n     the enclosed abstract for the value of real estate and slaves\r\n     according to the last assessment.\r\n\r\n     There has heretofore been no assessment of personal property--there\r\n     having been no tax authorized until this year. The assessment is now\r\n     being made and will probably add about $5,000,000 to the assessment\r\n     as stated in the abstract.\r\n\r\n     There has been no census since the U.

The realty\r\n     being $60,701,267; the personalty $20,795,203, and the bank and\r\n     brokers' capital $7,314,264.

The actual cash value of property is not\r\n     taken by the assessors. Citizens are not sworn as to the value of\r\n     their personal effects, nor is real estate given in at twenty per\r\n     cent. of its selling cash price. An elaborate estimate of the real\r\n     value, in cash, of Chicago, which we have seen,\r\n\r\n        puts the real estate at     $125,000,000\r\n        Improvements on the same,    $24,000,000\r\n        Personal property,           $22,000,000\r\n                                    ------------\r\n        In 1857 total value,        $171,000,000\r\n\r\n     On half a dozen streets in this city lots sell readily at $1,000 to\r\n     $1,200 per foot front, exclusive of improvements.\r\n\r\n     A census of the population of Chicago was taken in October, 1853, and\r\n     in June, 1855, the latter by State authority. That of October '53\r\n     found 60,652; that of June '55 found 80,509. The best estimate at\r\n     present makes the number, on May 1st, 1857, to be 112,000, which is\r\n     rather under than over the truth. The amount of building, in the\r\n     city, is immense, but as quickly as a tenement can be spiked\r\n     together, it is taken at a high rent; and at no former period has\r\n     there seemed so rapid an augmentation of population.\r\n\r\n     Very truly yours,\r\n     RAY & MEDILL,\r\n     _Eds.

The value of the real estate in the city of Richmond\r\n     is $18,000,000. The value of the personal is $191,920. Total value\r\n     $18,201,920.

The\r\n     number of inhabitants--white and black, is 34,612 within the\r\n     corporation limits.

The\r\n     assessment of the personal property will be completed in three or\r\n     four weeks hence; but its _exact_ value cannot be arrived at from the\r\n     fact that a large portion of this description of property--including\r\n     slaves--is taxed specifically without regard to its value.

Commerce is\r\nthe forerunner of wealth and population; and it is mainly these that make\r\ninvincible the power of undying States.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in general terms of the commerce of this country, and of the\r\ngreat cities through which that commerce is chiefly carried on, the Boston\r\n_Traveler_ says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The wealth concentrated at the great commercial points of the United\r\n     States is truly astonishing. For instance, one-eighth part of the\r\n     entire property of this country is owned by the cities of New-York\r\n     and Boston. Boston alone, in its corporate limits, owns one-twentieth\r\n     of the property of this entire Union, being an amount equal to the\r\n     wealth of any three of the New-England States, except Massachusetts.\r\n     In this city is found the richest community, _per capita_, of any in\r\n     the United States. The next city in point of wealth, according to its\r\n     population, is Providence, (R. I.,) which city is one of the richest\r\n     in the Union, having a valuation of fifty-six millions, with a\r\n     population of fifty thousand.\"\r\n\r\nThe same paper, in the course of an editorial article on the \"Wealth of\r\nBoston and its Business,\" says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The assessors' return of the wealth of Boston will probably show\r\n     this year an aggregate property of nearly three hundred millions.\r\n     This sum, divided among 160,000 people, would give nearly $2,000 to\r\n     each inhabitant, and will show Boston to be much the wealthiest\r\n     community in the United States, save New York alone, with four times\r\n     its population. The value of the real estate in this city is\r\n     increasing now with great rapidity, as at least four millions of\r\n     dollars' worth of new houses and stores will be built this year. The\r\n     personal estate in ships, cargoes, stocks, &c., is greatly\r\n     increasing with each succeeding year, not withstanding the many\r\n     disasters and losses constantly occurring in such kinds of property.\r\n\r\n     \"It is impossible to get the exact earnings of the nearly six hundred\r\n     thousand tons of shipping owned in this city. But perhaps it would\r\n     not be much out of the way to set the total amount for 1855 at from\r\n     fifteen to twenty millions of dollars. This sum has probably been\r\n     earned by our fleet engaged in the domestic trade, and in commercial\r\n     transactions with the East and West Indies, South America, the\r\n     Pacific, Europe and Africa. The three sources from which the\r\n     population of Boston is maintained, and its prosperity continued, are\r\n     these: Commerce, trade, and manufactures. Its annual trade and sales\r\n     of merchandise are said now, by competent judges, to amount to three\r\n     hundred millions of goods per annum, and will soon greatly exceed\r\n     that vast sum. The annual manufactures of this city are much more in\r\n     amount than in many entire States in this Union. They amount,\r\n     according to recent statistics, to nearly seventy-five millions of\r\n     dollars.\"\r\n\r\nFreeman Hunt, the accomplished editor of _Hunt's Merchants' Magazine_,\r\nwriting on the \"Progressive Growth of Cities,\" says:--\r\n\r\n     \"London is now the greatest concentration of human power the world\r\n     has ever known. Will its supremacy be permanent? or will it, like its\r\n     predecessors, be eclipsed by western rivals? New-Yorkers do not\r\n     doubt, and indeed have no reason to doubt, that their city, now\r\n     numbering little more than one-third of the population of London,\r\n     will, within the next fifty years, be greater than the metropolis of\r\n     the British empire.\r\n\r\n     \"New York, with her immediate dependencies, numbers about 900,000.\r\n     Since 1790 she has established a law of growth which doubles her\r\n     population once in fifteen years. If this law continues to operate,\r\n     she may be expected to possess 1,800,000 in 1871, 3,600,000 in 1880,\r\n     and 7,200,000 in 1901. If twenty years be allowed New York as her\r\n     future period of duplication, she would overtake London by the end of\r\n     fifty years; London _may_ then have five millions; New-York will\r\n     almost certainly have more than that number.\r\n\r\n     \"Will the star of empire become stationary at New-York? The interior\r\n     plain of North America has within itself more means to sustain a\r\n     dense population in civilized comfort than any other region of the\r\n     world. The star of empire cannot be arrested in its western course\r\n     before it reaches this plain. Its most promising city at present is\r\n     Chicago. The law of its growth since 1840 seems to be a duplication\r\n     within four years. In 1840 it numbered 4,379. In June of this year it\r\n     will contain 88,000. At the same rate of increase carried forward, it\r\n     would overtake New-York within twenty years. If six years be allowed\r\n     for each future duplication, Chicago would overtake New-York in\r\n     thirty-three years. If the growth of Chicago should in future be\r\n     measured by a duplication of every seven years, it would contain\r\n     5,622,000 in forty-two years.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1901, forty-five years from this time, the central plain,\r\n     including the Canadas, will contain about eighty millions of people.\r\n     Its chief city may be reasonably expected to contain about one-tenth\r\n     of this population. Before the end of this century the towns and\r\n     cities of the central plain will contain, with their suburbs, not\r\n     less than half the entire population; that is to say, forty millions.\r\n     How these millions shall be apportioned among the cities of that day,\r\n     is a subject for curious speculation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA FLEET OF MERCHANTMEN.\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Journal_, of a late date, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"About one hundred sail of vessels, of various descriptions, entered\r\n     this port yesterday, consisting of traders from Europe, South\r\n     America, the West Indies, and from coastwise ports. The waters of the\r\n     bay and harbor presented a beautiful appearance from the surrounding\r\n     shores, as this fleet of white-winged messengers made their way\r\n     towards the city, and crowds of people must have witnessed their\r\n     advent with great delight. A more magnificent sight is seldom seen in\r\n     our harbor.\"\r\n\r\nWould to God that such sights could sometimes be seen in Southern\r\nharbors! When slavery shall cease to paralyse the energies of our people,\r\nthen ships, coming to us from the four quarters of the globe, will, with\r\nmajestic grandeur, begin to loom in the distance; our bays will rejoice in\r\nthe presence of \"the white-winged messengers,\" and our levees resound as\r\nnever before with the varied din of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE OF NORFOLK.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Argus_ thus speaks of the ruined commerce of a most\r\ndespicable niggerville:--\r\n\r\n     \"We question if any other community, certainly no other in the United\r\n     States of America, have made greater exertions to resuscitate the\r\n     trade of Norfolk than the mercantile portion of the inhabitants; in\r\n     proof of which nineteen-twentieths of those engaged in foreign\r\n     commerce have terminated in their insolvency, the principal cause of\r\n     which has been in the unrelenting hostility, to this day, from the\r\n     commencement of the present century, of the Virginia Legislature,\r\n     with the co-operation of at least the commercial portions of the\r\n     citizens of Richmond, Petersburg and Portsmouth.\"\r\n\r\nHow it is, in this enlightened age, that men of ordinary intelligence can\r\nbe so far led into error as to suppose that commerce, or any other noble\r\nenterprise, can be established and successfully prosecuted under the\r\ndominion of slavery, is, to us, one of the most inexplicable of mysteries.\r\n\"Commercial\" Conventions, composed of the self-titled lordlings of\r\nslavery--Generals, Colonels, Majors, Captains, etcaetera--may act out their\r\nannual programmes of farcical nonsense from now until doomsday; but they\r\nwill never add one iota to the material, moral, or mental interests of\r\nthe South,--never can, until their ebony idol shall have been utterly\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE--PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Baltimore _Patriot_ for the following interesting\r\nsketch of the Monumental City as it was, and as it is, and as it may be:--\r\n\r\n     \"The population of Baltimore in 1790 was 13,503; in 1800, 15,514; in\r\n     1810, 35,583; in 1820, 62,738; in 1830, 80,625; in 1840, 110,313; in\r\n     1850, 169,054. The increase of inhabitants within two particular\r\n     decades, will be found, by reference to the above table, to be\r\n     remarkable. Between 1800 and 1810, the population nearly doubled\r\n     itself; between 1840 and 1850, the increase was two-thirds; and for\r\n     the past five years, the numerical extension of our population has\r\n     been even more rapid than during the previous decade. We may safely\r\n     assume that Baltimore contains at the present time not less than\r\n     250,000 inhabitants. But the increase in the manufactured products of\r\n     the State, as shown by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\n     is a matter of even greater astonishment. The statistical tables of\r\n     1840 estimate the aggregate value of the manufactures of Maryland at\r\n     $13,509,636--_thirteen million five hundred and nine thousand six\r\n     hundred and thirty-six dollars_. In 1850, the value of the articles\r\n     manufactured within the limits of the State amounted to\r\n     $32,593,635--_thirty-two million five hundred and ninety-three\r\n     thousand six hundred and thirty-five dollars_! A signal proof that\r\n     the wealth of the State has increased with even far greater rapidity\r\n     than its population. A quarter of a century ago, the sum of our\r\n     manufactures did not much exceed five millions of dollars per annum.\r\n     At this day it may be set down as falling but little short of fifty\r\n     millions. These are facts taken from official sources, and therefore\r\n     understated rather than exceeded. They are easily verified by any one\r\n     who will take the necessary trouble to examine the reports for\r\n     himself; and they justify us in the assertion that we are but fifteen\r\n     years behind Philadelphia in population, and are only at the same\r\n     relative distance from her in point of wealth.\r\n\r\n     A change has been going on for some time past in our commercial and\r\n     industrial affairs which all may have noticed, but the extent of\r\n     which is known to but few, and we hazard nothing in saying that this\r\n     enormous progression must continue, because it is based upon a solid\r\n     foundation, and therefore subject to no ordinary contingencies.\r\n\r\n     Occupying geographically the most central position on this Continent,\r\n     with vast mines of coal lying within easy distance to the North and\r\n     West of us, with a harbor easy of access, and with railroads\r\n     penetrating by the shortest routes the most fertile sections of the\r\n     Union, we need nothing but the judicious fostering of a proper spirit\r\n     among our citizens to make Baltimore not only the commercial emporium\r\n     of the South and West, but also the great coal mart of the Union. Our\r\n     flour market is already the most extensive in the known world--we\r\n     speak without exaggeration, for this also is proven by unquestionable\r\n     facts. There is more guano annually brought into our port than into\r\n     all the other ports of the United States put together, and the demand\r\n     for this important article of commerce is steadily increasing. Our\r\n     shipments of tobacco are immense, and as the improvement in the depth\r\n     of the channel of the Patapsco increases, must inevitably become much\r\n     greater.\r\n\r\n     Such, then, is our present condition as a commercial community, and\r\n     when we add that our prosperity is as much owing to our admirable\r\n     geographical position as to the energy of our merchants and\r\n     manufacturers, we design to cast no imputation on these excellent\r\n     citizens, but rather to stimulate them to renewed efforts in a field\r\n     where enterprise cannot fail of reaping its due reward.\r\n\r\n     Take any common map of the United States and rule an air line across\r\n     it from Baltimore to St. Louis, and midway between the two it will\r\n     strike Cincinnati--the great inland centre of trade--traversing at\r\n     the same time those wonderfully fertile valleys which lie between the\r\n     latter point and the Mississippi river. Now let it be remembered that\r\n     since the introduction of railways fluvial navigation has been, to a\r\n     considerable extent, superseded by inland transport, because of the\r\n     greater speed and certainty of the latter. Let it be remembered also\r\n     that the migration westward is incessantly going on, and that with\r\n     every farm opened within striking distance of a great arterial\r\n     railway, or its anastomosing branches, a certain amount of freight\r\n     must find its way to the seaboard markets, while the demand for\r\n     manufactured products, and for domestic or foreign commodities, in\r\n     exchange for breadstuffs or raw material, must necessarily increase;\r\n     thereby adding greatly to the prosperity of the commercial centre\r\n     towards which articles of export tend, and from which imports in\r\n     return are drawn. It would be difficult to estimate the value of what\r\n     this trade will be fifty years hence, or what the population of\r\n     Baltimore, situated as she is, will by that time have become.\r\n\r\n     Reasoning from causes to effects, and presuming that ordinary\r\n     perseverance will be used in promoting the interests of our city,\r\n     industrially and commercially, we are justified in believing that its\r\n     progress must be in an accelerated ratio, and that there are those\r\n     now living who will look back with surprise and wonder at its growth\r\n     and magnitude, as we have done while comparing its present aspect\r\n     with that which it exhibited within our own memory.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, but one not at all surprising to those whose\r\nphilosophy leads them to think aright, that Baltimore and St. Louis, the\r\ntwo most prosperous cities in the slave States, have fewer slaves in\r\nproportion to the aggregate population than any other city or cities in\r\nthe South. While the entire population of the former is now estimated at\r\n250,000, and that of the latter at 140,000--making a grand total of\r\n390,000 in the two cities, less than 6,000 of this latter number are\r\nslaves; indeed, neither city is cursed with half the number of 6,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, there were only 2,946 slaves in Baltimore, and 2,656 in St.\r\nLouis--total in the two cities 5,602; and in both places, thank Heaven,\r\nthis heathenish class of the population was rapidly decreasing. The census\r\nof 1860 will, in all probability, show that the two cities are entirely\r\nexempt from slaves and slavery; and that of 1870 will, we prayerfully\r\nhope, show that the United States at large, at that time, will have been\r\nwholly redeemed from the unspeakable curse of human bondage.\r\n\r\nWhat about Southern Commerce? Is it not almost entirely tributary to the\r\ncommerce of the North? Are we not dependent on New-York, Philadelphia,\r\nBoston, and Cincinnati, for nearly every article of merchandise, whether\r\nforeign or domestic? Where are our ships, our mariners, our naval\r\narchitects? Alas! echo answers, where?\r\n\r\nReader! would you understand how abjectly slaveholders themselves are\r\nenslaved to the products of Northern industry? If you would, fix your mind\r\non a Southern \"gentleman\"--a slave-breeder and human-flesh monger, who\r\nprofesses to be a Christian! Observe the routine of his daily life. See\r\nhim rise in the morning from a Northern bed, and clothe himself in\r\nNorthern apparel; see him walk across the floor on a Northern carpet, and\r\nperform his ablutions out of a Northern ewer and basin. See him uncover a\r\nbox of Northern powders, and cleanse his teeth with a Northern brush; see\r\nhim reflecting his physiognomy in a Northern mirror, and arranging his\r\nhair with a Northern comb. See him dosing himself with the mendicaments of\r\nNorthern quacks, and perfuming his handkerchief with Northern cologne. See\r\nhim referring to the time in a Northern watch, and glancing at the news in\r\na Northern gazette. See him and his family sitting in Northern chairs,\r\nand singing and praying out of Northern books. See him at the breakfast\r\ntable, saying grace over a Northern plate, eating with Northern cutlery,\r\nand drinking from Northern utensils. See him charmed with the melody of a\r\nNorthern piano, or musing over the pages of a Northern novel. See him\r\nriding to his neighbor's in a Northern carriage, or furrowing his lands\r\nwith a Northern plow. See him lighting his segar with a Northern match,\r\nand flogging his negroes with a Northern lash. See him with Northern pen\r\nand ink, writing letters on Northern paper, and sending them away in\r\nNorthern envelopes, sealed with Northern wax, and impressed with a\r\nNorthern stamp. Perhaps our Southern \"gentleman\" is a merchant; if so, see\r\nhim at his store, making an unpatriotic use of his time in the miserable\r\ntraffic of Northern gimcracks and haberdashery; see him when you will,\r\nwhere you will, he is ever surrounded with the industrial products of\r\nthose whom, in the criminal inconsistency of his heart, he execrates as\r\nenemies, yet treats as friends. His labors, his talents, his influence,\r\nare all for the North, and not for the South; for the stability of\r\nslavery, and for the sake of his own personal aggrandizement, he is\r\nwilling to sacrifice the dearest interests of his country.\r\n\r\nAs we see our ruinous system of commerce exemplified in the family of our\r\nSouthern \"gentleman,\" so we may see it exemplified, to a greater or less\r\ndegree, in almost every other family throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe slaveholding States. We are all constantly buying, and selling, and\r\nwearing, and using Northern merchandise, at a double expense to both\r\nourselves and our neighbors. If we but look at ourselves attentively, we\r\nshall find that we are all clothed _cap a pie_ in Northern habilaments.\r\nOur hats, our caps, our cravats, our coats, our vests, our pants, our\r\ngloves, our boots, our shoes, our under-garments--all come from the North;\r\nwhence, too, Southern ladies procure all their bonnets, plumes, and\r\nflowers; dresses, shawls, and scarfs; frills, ribbons, and ruffles; cuffs,\r\ncapes, and collars.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that the South has wonderful powers of endurance and\r\nrecuperation; but she cannot forever support the reckless prodigality of\r\nher sons. We are all spendthrifts; some of us should become financiers. We\r\nmust learn to take care of our money; we should withhold it from the\r\nNorth, and open avenues for its circulation at home. We should not run to\r\nNew-York, to Philadelphia, to Boston, to Cincinnati, or to any other\r\nNorthern city, every time we want a shoe-string or a bedstead, a fish-hook\r\nor a hand-saw, a tooth-pick or a cotton-gin. In ease and luxury we have\r\nbeen lolling long enough; we should now bestir ourselves, and keep pace\r\nwith the progress of the age. We must expand our energies, and acquire\r\nhabits of enterprise and industry; we should arouse ourselves from the\r\ncouch of lassitude, and inure our minds to thought and our bodies to\r\naction. We must begin to feed on a more substantial diet than that of\r\npro-slavery politics; we should leave off our siestas and post-meridian\r\nnaps, and employ our time in profitable vocations. Before us there is a\r\nvast work to be accomplished--a work which has been accumulating on our\r\nhands for many years. It is no less a work than that of infusing the\r\nspirit of liberty into all our systems of commerce, agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, government, literature, and religion. Oligarchal despotism\r\nmust be overthrown; slavery must be abolished.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing how absolutely Southern \"gentlemen,\"\r\nparticularly slaveholding merchants, are lost to all sense of true honor\r\nand patriotism, we will here introduce an extract from an article which\r\nappeared more than three years ago in one of the editorial columns of the\r\nleading daily newspaper of the city of New-York. It is in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"Southern merchants do indeed keep away from New-York for the reason\r\n     that they can't pay their debts; there is no doubt that if the\r\n     jobbers of this city had not trusted Southern traders for the past\r\n     three years, they would be a great deal better off than they are. * *\r\n     * Already our trade with Canada is becoming as promising, sure, and\r\n     profitable, as our trade with the South is uncertain, riskful, and\r\n     annoying.\"\r\n\r\nNow, by any body of men not utterly debased by the influences of slavery,\r\nthis language would have been construed into an invitation to stay at\r\nhome. But do Southern merchants stay at home? Do they build up Southern\r\ncommerce? No! off they post to the North as regularly as the seasons,\r\nspring and fall, come round, and there, like cringing sycophants, flatter,\r\nbeg, and scheme, for favors which they have no money to command.\r\n\r\nThe better classes of merchants, and indeed of all other people, at the\r\nNorth, as elsewhere, have too much genuine respect for themselves to wish\r\nto have any dealings whatever with those who make merchandise of human\r\nbeings. Limited as is our acquaintance in the city of New-York, we know\r\none firm there, a large wholesale house, that makes it an invariable rule\r\nnever to sell goods to a merchant from the slave States except for cash.\r\nBeing well acquainted with the partners, we asked one of them, on one\r\noccasion, why he refused to trust slave-driving merchants. \"Because,\" said\r\nhe, \"they are too long-winded and uncertain; when we credit them, they\r\noccasion us more loss and bother than their trade is worth.\"\r\nNon-slaveholders of the South! recollect that slavery is the only\r\nimpediment to your progress and prosperity, that it stands diametrically\r\nopposed to all needful reforms, that it seeks to sacrifice you entirely\r\nfor the benefit of others, and that it is the one great and only cause of\r\ndishonor to your country. Will you not abolish it? May Heaven help you to\r\ndo your duty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND ARGUMENTS BY THE WAYSIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding that we shall have to leave unsaid a great many things which we\r\nintended to say, and that we shall have to omit much valuable matter, the\r\nproduct of other pens than our own, but which, having collected at\r\nconsiderable expense, we had hoped to be able to introduce, we have\r\nconcluded to present, under the above heading, only a few of the more\r\nimportant particulars.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we will give an explanation of the reason\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THIS WORK WAS NOT PUBLISHED IN BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of this work was written in Baltimore; and the\r\nwhole of it would have been written and published there, but for the\r\nfollowing odious clause, which we extract from the Statutes of Maryland:--\r\n\r\n     \"Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That after the\r\n     passage of this act, it shall not be lawful for any citizen of this\r\n     State, knowingly to make, print or engrave, or aid in the making,\r\n     printing or engraving, within this State, any pictorial\r\n     representation, or to write or print, or to aid in the writing or\r\n     printing any pamphlet, newspaper, handbill or other paper of an\r\n     inflammatory character, and having a tendency to excite discontent\r\n     or stir up insurrection amongst the people of color of this State, or\r\n     of either of the other States or Territories of the United States, or\r\n     knowingly to carry or send, or to aid in the carrying or sending the\r\n     same for circulation amongst the inhabitants of either of the other\r\n     States or Territories of the United States, and any person so\r\n     offending shall be guilty of a felony, and shall on conviction be\r\n     sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary of this State, for a\r\n     period not less than ten nor more than twenty years, from the time of\r\n     sentence pronounced on such person.\"--_Act passed Dec. 1831. See 2nd\r\n     Dorsey, page 1218._\r\n\r\nNow so long as slaveholders are clothed with the mantle of office, so long\r\nwill they continue to make laws, like the above, expressly calculated to\r\nbring the non-slaveholding whites under a system of vassalage little less\r\nonerous and debasing than that to which the negroes themselves are\r\naccustomed. What wonder is it that there is no native literature in the\r\nSouth? The South can never have a literature of her own until after\r\nslavery shall have been abolished. Slaveholders are too lazy and ignorant\r\nto write it, and the non-slaveholders--even the few whose minds are\r\ncultivated at all--are not permitted even to make the attempt. Down with\r\nthe oligarchy! Ineligibility of slaveholders--never another vote to the\r\ntrafficker in human flesh!\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTS AGAINST SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nIn his Compendium of the Seventh Census, Mr. DeBow has compiled the\r\nfollowing useful and highly interesting facts:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Continental Congress of 1774 resolved to discontinue the slave\r\n     trade, in which resolution they were anticipated by the Conventions\r\n     of Delegates of Virginia and North Carolina. In 1789 the Convention\r\n     to frame the federal Constitution, looked to the abolition of the\r\n     traffic in 1808. On the 2nd of March, 1807, Congress passed an act\r\n     against importations of Africans into the United States after January\r\n     1st, 1808. An act in Great Britain in 1807 also made the slave trade\r\n     unlawful. Denmark forbid the introduction of African slaves into her\r\n     colonies after 1804. The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, pronounced for\r\n     the abolition of the trade. France abolished it in 1817, and also\r\n     Spain, but the acts were to take effect after 1820. Portugal\r\n     abolished it in 1818.\r\n\r\n     \"In Pennsylvania slavery was abolished in 1780. In New Jersey it was\r\n     provisionally abolished in 1784; all children born of a slave after\r\n     1804 are made free in 1820. In Massachusetts, it was declared after\r\n     the revolution, that slavery was virtually abolished by their\r\n     Constitution, (1780). In 1784 and 1797, Connecticut provided for a\r\n     gradual extinction of slavery. In Rhode Island, after 1784, no person\r\n     could be _born_ a slave. The Constitutions of Vermont and New\r\n     Hampshire, respectively, abolished slavery. In New York it was\r\n     provisionally abolished in 1799, twenty-eight years' ownership being\r\n     allowed in slaves born after that date, and in 1817 it was enacted\r\n     that slavery was not to exist after ten years, or 1827. The ordinance\r\n     of 1787 forbid slavery in the territory northwest of the Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the instances enumerated above, slavery has been abolished in more\r\nthan forty different parts of the world within the last half century, and\r\nwith good results everywhere, except two or three West India islands,\r\nwhere the negro population was greatly in excess of the whites; and even\r\nin these, the evils, if any, that have followed, are not justly\r\nattributable to abolition, but to the previous demoralization produced by\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may very properly introduce the testimony of a West\r\nIndia planter to the relative advantages of Free over Slave Labor. Listen\r\nto Charles Pettyjohn, of Barbadoes, who, addressing himself to a citizen\r\nof our own country, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In 1834, I came in possession of 257 slaves, under the laws of\r\n     England, which required the owner to feed, clothe, and furnish them\r\n     with medical attendance. With this number I cultivated my sugar\r\n     plantation until the Emancipation Act of August 1st, 1838, when they\r\n     all became free. I now hire a portion of those slaves, the best and\r\n     cheapest of course, as you hire men in the United States. The average\r\n     number which I employ is 100, with which I cultivate more land at a\r\n     cheaper rate, and make more produce than I did with 257 slaves. With\r\n     my slaves I made from 100 to 180 tons of sugar yearly. With 100 free\r\n     negroes I think I do badly if I do not annually produce 250 tons.\"\r\n\r\nIf, in the forty and more instances to which we have alluded, the\r\nabolition of slavery had proved injurious in a majority of cases, the\r\nattempt to abolish it elsewhere might, perhaps, be regarded as an\r\nill-advised effort; but, seeing that its abolition has worked well in at\r\nleast fourteen-fifteenths of all the cases on record, the fact becomes\r\nobvious that it is our duty and our interest to continue to abolish it\r\nuntil the whole world shall be freed, or until we shall begin to see more\r\nevil than good result from our acts of emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE FRIENDS OF THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nFreesoilers and abolitionists are the only true friends of the South;\r\nslaveholders and slave-breeders are downright enemies of their own\r\nsection. Anti-slavery men are working for the Union and for the good of\r\nthe whole world; proslavery men are working for the disunion of the\r\nStates, and for the good of nothing except themselves. Than such men as\r\nGreeley, Seward, Sumner, Clay, and Birney, the South can have no truer\r\nfriends--nor can slavery have more implacable foes.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing that Horace Greeley is not, as he is generally\r\nrepresented by the oligarchy, an inveterate hater of the South, we will\r\nhere introduce an extract from one of his editorial articles in a late\r\nnumber of the New York _Tribune_--a faithful advocate of freedom, whose\r\ncirculation, we are happy to say, is greater than the aggregate\r\ncirculation of more than twenty of the principal proslavery sheets\r\npublished at the South:--\r\n\r\n     \"Is it in vain that we pile fact upon fact, proof on proof, showing\r\n     that slavery is a blight and a curse to the States which cherish it?\r\n     These facts are multitudinous as the leaves of the forest; conclusive\r\n     as the demonstrations of geometry. Nobody attempts to refute them,\r\n     but the champions of slavery extension seem determined to persist in\r\n     ignoring them. Let it be understood, then, once for all, that we do\r\n     not hate the South, war on the South, nor seek to ruin the South, in\r\n     resisting the extension of slavery. We most earnestly believe human\r\n     bondage a curse to the South, and to all whom it affects; but we do\r\n     not labor for its overthrow otherwise than through the conviction of\r\n     the South of its injustice and mischief. Its extension into new\r\n     Territories we determinedly resist, not by any means from ill will to\r\n     the South, but under the impulse of good will to all mankind. We\r\n     believe the establishment of slavery in Kansas or any other Western\r\n     Territory would prolong its existence in Virginia and Maryland, by\r\n     widening the market and increasing the price of slaves, and thereby\r\n     increasing the profits of slave-breeding, and the consequent\r\n     incitement thereto. Those who urge that slavery would not go into\r\n     Kansas if permitted, wilfully shut their eyes to the fact that it\r\n     _has gone_ into Missouri, lying in exactly the same latitude, and is\r\n     now strongest in that north-western angle of said State, which was\r\n     covertly filched from what is now Kansas, within the last twenty\r\n     years. Even if the growth of hemp, corn and tobacco were not so\r\n     profitable in Eastern Kansas, as it evidently must be, the growth of\r\n     slaves for more Southern consumption would inevitably prove as\r\n     lucrative there as in Virginia and Maryland, which lie in\r\n     corresponding latitudes, and whose chief staple export to-day\r\n     consists of negro bondmen destined for the plantations of Louisiana\r\n     and Mississippi, which could be supplied more conveniently and\r\n     cheaply from Kansas than from their present breeding-places this side\r\n     of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\n     Whenever we draw a parallel between Northern and Southern production,\r\n     industry, thrift, wealth, the few who seek to parry the facts at all\r\n     complain that the instances are unfairly selected--that the\r\n     commercial ascendancy of the North, with the profits and facilities\r\n     thence accruing, accounts for the striking preponderance of the\r\n     North. In vain we insist that slavery is the cause of this very\r\n     commercial ascendancy--that Norfolk and Richmond and Charleston might\r\n     have been to this country what Boston, New-York and Philadelphia now\r\n     are, had not slavery spread its pall over and paralyzed the energies\r\n     of the South.\"\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as a fair expression of the sentiments of a great\r\nmajority of the people north of Mason and Dixon's line. Our Northern\r\ncousins \"do not hate the South, war on the South, nor seek to ruin the\r\nSouth;\" on the contrary, they love our particular part of the nation, and,\r\nlike dutiful, sensible, upright men, they would promote its interests by\r\nfacilitating the abolition of slavery. Success to their efforts!\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY THOUGHTFUL--SIGNS OF CONTRITION.\r\n\r\nThe real condition of the South is most graphically described in the\r\nfollowing doleful admissions from the Charleston _Standard_:--\r\n\r\n     \"In its every aspect our present condition is provincial. We have\r\n     within our limits no solitary metropolis of interest or ideas--no\r\n     marts of exchange--no radiating centres of opinion. Whatever we have\r\n     of genius and productive energy, goes freely in to swell the\r\n     importance of the North. Possessing the material which constitutes\r\n     two-thirds of the commerce of the whole country, it might have been\r\n     supposed that we could have influence upon the councils of foreign\r\n     States; but we are never taken into contemplation. It might have been\r\n     supposed that England, bound to us by the cords upon which depend the\r\n     existence of four millions of her subjects, would be considerate of\r\n     our feelings; but receiving her cotton from the North, it is for them\r\n     she has concern, and it is her interest and her pleasure to reproach\r\n     us. It might have been supposed, that, producing the material which\r\n     is sent abroad, to us would come the articles that are taken in\r\n     exchange for it; but to the North they go for distribution, and to us\r\n     are parcelled out the fabrics that are suited to so remote a section.\r\n\r\n     Instead, therefore, of New-York being tributary to Norfolk,\r\n     Charleston, Savannah or New Orleans, these cities are tributary to\r\n     New-York. Instead of the merchants of New-York standing cap in hand\r\n     to the merchants of Charleston, the merchants of Charleston stand cap\r\n     in hand to the merchants of New-York.--Instead of receiving foreign\r\n     ships in Southern waters, and calling up the merchants of the country\r\n     to a distribution of the cargo, the merchants of the South are\r\n     hurried off to make a distribution elsewhere. In virtue of our\r\n     relations to a greater system, we have little development of internal\r\n     interests; receiving supplies from the great centre, we have made\r\n     little effort to supply ourselves. We support the makers of boots,\r\n     shoes, hats, coats, shirts, flannels, blankets, carpets, chairs,\r\n     tables, mantels, mats, carriages, jewelry, cradles, couches, coffins,\r\n     by the thousand and hundreds of thousands; but they scorn to live\r\n     amongst us. They must have the gaieties and splendors of a great\r\n     metropolis, and are not content to vegetate upon the dim verge of\r\n     this remote frontier.\r\n\r\n     As it is in material interests, so it is in arts and letters--our\r\n     pictures are painted at the North, our books are published at the\r\n     North, our periodicals and papers are printed at the North. We are\r\n     even fed on police reports and villany from the North. The papers\r\n     published at the South which ignore the questions at issue between\r\n     the sections are generally well sustained; the books which expose the\r\n     evils of our institution are even read with avidity beyond our\r\n     limits, but the ideas that are turned to the condition of the South\r\n     are intensely provincial. If, as things now are, a man should rise\r\n     with all the genius of Shakspeare, or Dickens, or Fielding, or of all\r\n     the three combined, and speak from the South, he would not receive\r\n     enough to pay the costs of publication. If published at the South,\r\n     his book would never be seen or heard of, and published at the North\r\n     it would not be read.--So perfect is our provincialism, therefore,\r\n     that enterprise is forced to the North for a sphere--talent for a\r\n     market--genius for the ideas upon which to work--indolence for ease,\r\n     and the tourist for attractions.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract exhibits in bold relief, and in small space, a large number\r\nof the present evils of past errors. It is charmingly frank and truthful.\r\nDeQuincey's Confessions of an opium eater are nothing to it. A\r\ndistinguished writer on medical jurisprudence informs us that \"the\r\nknowledge of the disease is half the cure;\" and if it be true, as perhaps\r\nit is, we think the _Standard_ is in a fair way to be reclaimed from the\r\nenormous vices of proslavery statism.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF FREEDOM IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, by St. Paul, the work goes bravely on.\"\r\n\r\nAs well might the oligarchy attempt to stay the flux and reflux of the\r\ntides, as to attempt to stay the progress of Freedom in the South.\r\nApproved of God, the edict of the genius of Universal Emancipation has\r\nbeen proclaimed to the world, and nothing, save Deity himself, can\r\npossibly reverse it. To connive at the perpetuation of slavery is to\r\ndisobey the commands of Heaven. Not to be an abolitionist is to be a\r\nwilful and diabolical instrument of the devil. The South needs to be free,\r\nthe South wants to be free, the South _shall_ be free!\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from Southern journals will show that the glorious\r\nlight of a better era has already begun to penetrate and dispel the\r\nportentous clouds of slavery. The Wellsburg (Va.) _Herald_, an independent\r\npaper, referring to the vote of thirteen Democrats from that section,\r\nrefusing, in the Virginia Legislature, in 1856, \"to appropriate money from\r\nthe general treasury for the recapture of runaway slaves,\" says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We presume these delegates in some degree represent their\r\n     constituents, and we are thereby encouraged and built up in the\r\n     confidence that there are other interests in Virginia to be seen to\r\n     besides those pertaining to slavery.\"\r\n\r\nA non-slaveholding Southron, in the course of a communication in a more\r\nrecent number of the same journal, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We are taxed to support slavery. The clean cash goes out of our own\r\n     pockets into the pockets of the slaveholder, and this in many ways. I\r\n     will now allude to but two. If a slave, for crime, is put to death or\r\n     transported, the owner is paid for him out of the public treasury,\r\n     and under this law thousands are paid out every year. Again, a\r\n     standing army is kept up in the city of Richmond for no other purpose\r\n     than to be ready to quell insurrection among the slaves; this is paid\r\n     for out of the public treasury annually. This standing army is called\r\n     the public guard, but it is no less a standing army always kept up.\r\n     We will quote from the acts of 1856 the expense of these two items to\r\n     the State, on the 23d and 24th pages of the acts:--'To pay for slaves\r\n     executed and transported, $22,000;' 'to the public guard at Richmond,\r\n     $24,000.' This, be it noticed, is only for one year, making near\r\n     $50,000 for those two objects in one year; but it can be shown by the\r\n     present unequal plan of taxation between slave property and other\r\n     property, that this is but a small item of our cash pocketed by the\r\n     slaveholders; and yet some will say we have no reason to complain.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Wheeling _Gazette_ publishes the following as his\r\nplatform on the slavery question:--\r\n\r\n     \"Allying ourself to neither North nor South, on our own hook we adopt\r\n     the following platform as our platform on this question, from which\r\n     we never have and never will recede. _We may_ FALL _on it, but_ WILL\r\n     NEVER LEAVE IT.\r\n\r\n     The severance of the General Government from slavery.\r\n\r\n     _The_ REPEAL _of the fugitive slave law._\r\n\r\n     _The_ REPEAL _of the Nebraska Kansas Bill._\r\n\r\n     _No more slave territories._\r\n\r\n     THE PURCHASE AND MANUMISSION OF SLAVES IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,\r\n     OR THE REMOVAL OF THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT TO FREE TERRITORY.\"\r\n\r\nSays the Baltimore _Clipper_:--\r\n\r\n     \"The South is contending for, and the North against, the extension of\r\n     slavery into the territories; but we do not think that either side\r\n     would consent to dissolve the Union about the negro population--a\r\n     population which we look upon as a curse to the nation, and should\r\n     rejoice to see removed to their native clime of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nThe _National Era_, _one_ of the best papers in the country, published in\r\nWashington City, D. C., says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The tendency of slavery to diffuse itself, and to crowd out free\r\n     labor, was early observed by American patriots, North and South; and\r\n     Mr. Jefferson, the great apostle of Republicanism, made an effort, in\r\n     1784, to cut short the encroaching tide of barbaric despotism, by\r\n     prohibiting slavery in all the territories of the Union, down to\r\n     thirty-one degrees of latitude, which was then our Southern boundary.\r\n     His beneficent purpose failed, not for want of a decisive majority of\r\n     votes present in the Congress of the Confederation, but in\r\n     consequence of the absence of the delegates from one or two States,\r\n     which were necessary to the constitutional majority. When the subject\r\n     again came up, in 1787, Mr. Jefferson was Minister to France, and the\r\n     famous ordinance of that year was adopted, prohibiting slavery North\r\n     and West of the Ohio river. Between 1784 and 1787, the strides of\r\n     slavery westward, into Tennessee and Kentucky, had become too\r\n     considerable to admit of the policy of exclusion; and besides those\r\n     regions were then integral parts of Virginia and North Carolina, and\r\n     of course they could not be touched without the consent of those\r\n     States. In 1820, another effort was made to arrest the progress of\r\n     slavery, which threatened to monopolize the whole territory west of\r\n     the Mississippi. In the meantime the South had apostatized from the\r\n     faith of Jefferson. It had ceased to love universal liberty, and the\r\n     growing importance of the cotton culture had caused the people to\r\n     look with indifference upon the moral deformity of slavery; and, as a\r\n     matter of course, the politicians became its apologists and\r\n     defenders. After a severe struggle a compromise was agreed upon, by\r\n     which Missouri was to be admitted with slavery, which was the\r\n     immediate point in controversy; and slavery was to be excluded from\r\n     all the territory North and West of that State.\r\n\r\n     \"We have shown, from the most incontestable evidence, that there is\r\n     in slave society a much greater tendency to diffuse itself into new\r\n     regions, than belongs to freedom, for the reason that it has no\r\n     internal vitality. It cannot live if circumscribed, and must, like a\r\n     consumptive, be continually roving for a change of air to recuperate\r\n     its wasting energies.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Missouri Legislature, in January, 1857, Mr. Brown, of St. Louis,\r\nproved himself a hero, a patriot, and a statesman, in the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am a Free-Soiler and I don't deny it. No word or vote of mine\r\n     shall ever inure to the benefit of such a monstrous doctrine as the\r\n     extension of Slavery over the patrimony of the free white laborers of\r\n     the country. I am for the greatest good of the greatest number, and\r\n     against the system which monopolizes the free and fertile territory\r\n     of our country for a few slaveholders, to the exclusion of thousands\r\n     upon thousands of the sinewy sons of toil. The time will come, and\r\n     perhaps very soon, when the people will rule for their own benefit\r\n     _and not for that of a class which, numerically speaking, is\r\n     insignificant_. I stand here in the midst of the assembled\r\n     Legislature of Missouri to avow myself a Free-Soiler. Let those who\r\n     are scared at names shrink from the position if they will. I shall\r\n     take my stand in favor of the white man. Here in Missouri I shall\r\n     support the rights, the dignity and the welfare of the 800,000\r\n     non-slaveholders in preference to upholding and perpetuating the\r\n     dominancy of the 30,000 slaveholders who inhabit our State.\"\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis _Democrat_, in an editorial article, under date of January\r\n28, 1857, entitled itself to the favorable regard of every true lover of\r\nliberty, by talking thus boldly on the subject of the \"Emancipation of\r\nSlavery in Missouri\":--\r\n\r\n     \"Viewing the question as a subject of State policy, we will venture\r\n     to say that it is the grandest ever propounded to the people. If it\r\n     were affirmed in a constitutional convention, and thoroughly carried\r\n     out without any violation of vested rights, Missouri, in a few years\r\n     subsequent to its consummation, would be the foremost State on the\r\n     American continent. Population would flow in from all sides were the\r\n     barrier of negro slavery once removed, and in place of 80,000 slaves,\r\n     we should have 800,000 white men, which, in addition to the\r\n     population we would have at that time, would give us at once an\r\n     aggregate of two millions.\r\n\r\n     Is Missouri ambitious of political power?--a power which is slipping\r\n     away from the South. The mode of acquiring it is found. We are not\r\n     rash enough to attempt a description of our condition if the element\r\n     of free labor were introduced. The earth would give up its hidden\r\n     treasures at its bidding as the sea will give up its dead; and the\r\n     soil would bloom more luxuriantly than if it drank the dews of Hermon\r\n     nightly; ten thousand keels would vex our rivers, towns along their\r\n     banks would grow into cities, and St. Louis would soon unite in\r\n     itself the attributes of the greatest commercial manufacturing and\r\n     literary metropolis in the world. Let it be remembered that we have\r\n     every inanimate element of wealth and power within our limits, and\r\n     that we require only labor--free labor--for we need not say that\r\n     servile labor is inadequate. * * *\r\n\r\n     There need be no pernicious agitation, and even if there should, it\r\n     is the penalty which we cannot avoid paying at some time; and it is\r\n     easier to pay it now, than in the future. Who that watches passing\r\n     events and indications, is not sensible of the fact that great\r\n     internal convulsions await the slave States? Better to grapple with\r\n     the danger in time, if danger there be, and avert it, than wait until\r\n     it becomes formidable. One thing is certain, or history is no guide:\r\n     that is, that slavery cannot be perpetuated anywhere. An agitation\r\n     now would be the effort of the social system to throw off a disease\r\n     which had not touched its vitals; hereafter it would be the struggle\r\n     for life with a mortal sickness. But we do not apprehend any\r\n     agitation more violent than has been forced upon us for years by the\r\n     pro-slavery politicians. Agitating the slavery question, has been\r\n     their constant business, and nothing worse has resulted from it than\r\n     their elevation to office--no very trifling evil, by the way--and the\r\n     temporary subjugation of Kansas.\r\n\r\n     Besides, we know that all the free States emancipated their slaves,\r\n     and England and France theirs suddenly; and we have yet to learn that\r\n     a dangerous agitation arose in any instance.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, it is well known, and we thank Heaven for the\r\nfact and for the indication, that, at the election held for Mayor of St.\r\nLouis, in April, 1857, the Abolition candidate, himself a native of\r\nVirginia, was triumphantly elevated to the chief magistracy of the city.\r\nThree cheers for St. Louis! nine for Missouri! thirteen for the South.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the late election in St. Louis, in which the Emancipation\r\nparty triumphed, the Wheeling (Va.) _Intelligencer_ says:--\r\n\r\n     \"These elections do demonstrate this fact, beyond a cavil, that the\r\n     sentiment of the great majority of the people of this Union is\r\n     irrevocably opposed to the extension of slavery; that they are\r\n     determined, if overwhelming public sentiment can avail anything,\r\n     another slave State shall not be admitted into the confederacy. And\r\n     why are they so determined? Because they believe, and not only\r\n     believe, but see and know, that slavery is an unmitigated curse to\r\n     the soil that sustains it. They know this, because they see every\r\n     free State outstripping every slave State in all the elements that\r\n     make a people powerful and prosperous; because they see the people in\r\n     the one educated and thrifty, and in the other ignorant and\r\n     thriftless; because they have before their eyes a State like our own,\r\n     once the very Union itself almost in importance, to-day taking her\r\n     rank as a fifth rate power.\"\r\n\r\nNon-slaveholders of the South! fail not to support the papers--the\r\nSouthern papers--that support your interests. Chief amongst those papers\r\nare the St. Louis (Mo.) _Democrat_, the _National Era_, published in\r\nWashington City, D. C., the Baltimore _Clipper_, the Wheeling (Va.)\r\n_Intelligencer_, and the Wellsburg (Va.) _Herald_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RIGHT FEELING IN THE RIGHT QUARTER.\r\n\r\nThere is but one way for the oligarchy to perpetuate slavery in the\r\nSouthern States, and that is by perpetuating absolute ignorance among the\r\nnon-slaveholding whites. This it is quite impossible for them to do. God\r\nhas scattered the seeds of knowledge throughout every portion of the\r\nSouth, and they are, as might have been expected, beginning to take root\r\nin her fertile soil. The following extracts from letters which have been\r\nreceived since we commenced writing this work, will show how powerfully\r\nthe spirit of freedom is operating upon the minds of intelligent, thinking\r\nmen in the slave States.\r\n\r\nA Baltimorean, writing to us awhile previous to the last Presidential\r\nelection, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I see that the Trustees of the University of North Carolina have\r\n     dismissed Prof. Hedrick for writing a letter in favor of Republican\r\n     principles. Oh, what an inglorious source of reflection for an\r\n     American citizen! To think, to know that our boasted liberty of\r\n     speech is a myth, an abstraction. To see a poor professor crushed\r\n     under the feet of the tyrannical magnates of slavery, for daring to\r\n     speak the honest sentiments of his heart. Where is fanaticism now,\r\n     North or South? Oh, my country, my country, whither art thou tending?\r\n     Truly we have fallen upon degenerate days. God grant that they may\r\n     not be like those of ancient Greece and Rome, the forerunners of our\r\n     country's ruin.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter under date of November 1, 1856, a friend who resides in the\r\neastern part of North Carolina, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the papers which reached me last week I notice that our own State\r\n     has been disgraced by a junto of pro-slavery hot-spurs, who had the\r\n     audacity to meet in Raleigh for the express purpose of concocting\r\n     measures for a dissolution of the Union. It appears that the three\r\n     leading spirits of this cabal were the present governors of three\r\n     neighboring States--three treasonable disturbers of the public peace,\r\n     who, under the circumstances, should, in my opinion, have been shot\r\n     dead upon the spot! I have each of their names noted down in my\r\n     memorandum, and I shall certainly die unsatisfied, if I do not live\r\n     to hear of their being thoroughly tarred and feathered, and ridden on\r\n     a rail, by the non-slaveholding whites, against whose welfare their\r\n     machinations have been chiefly leveled. Rely upon it, that, if they\r\n     do not soon sneak away into their graves, a day of retributive\r\n     justice will most assuredly overtake them.\"\r\n\r\nA native and resident of one of the towns in western North Carolina, under\r\ndate of March 19, 1857, writes to us as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"While patrolling a few nights ago I was forcibly struck with the\r\n     truthfulness of the remarks contained in your last letter.--Here I\r\n     am, a poor but sober and industrious man, with a family dependent on\r\n     me for support, and after I have finished my day's labor, I am\r\n     compelled to walk the streets from nine in the evening till three in\r\n     the morning, to restrain the roving propensities of other people's\r\n     'property'--niggers. Why should I thus be deprived of sleep that the\r\n     slaveholder may slumber? I frankly acknowledge my indebtedness to you\r\n     for opening my eyes upon this subject. The more I think and see of\r\n     slavery the more I detest it. * * * I am becoming restless, and have\r\n     been debating within my own mind whether I had not better emigrate to\r\n     a free State. * * * If I live, I am determined to oppose slavery\r\n     somewhere--here or elsewhere. It will be impossible for me to keep my\r\n     lips sealed much longer. Indeed, I sometimes feel that I have been\r\n     remiss in my duty in not having opened them ere now. But for the\r\n     unfathomable ignorance that pervades the mass of the poor, deluded,\r\n     slavery-saddled whites around me, I would not suppress my sentiments\r\n     another hour.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, under date of April 7, 1857, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I thank God that slavery will, in my opinion, soon be abolished. I\r\n     wish to Heaven I had the ability to raise my voice successfully in\r\n     favor of a just system to abolish it. I would indeed be rejoiced to\r\n     have an opportunity to do something to relieve the South of the awful\r\n     curse. Fear not that you will meet with no sympathizers in the South.\r\n     You will have hosts of friends on every side--even in this town, if I\r\n     am not greatly mistaken, a large majority of the citizens will add\r\n     an enthusiastic _Amen!_ to your work.\"\r\n\r\nWe might furnish similar extracts from other letters, but these, we think,\r\nare quite sufficient to show that the millennium of freedom is rapidly\r\ndawning throughout the benighted regions of slavery. Coveted events are\r\nhappening in charming succession. All we have to do is to wait and work a\r\nlittle longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLITERATE POOR WHITES OF THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nHad we the power to sketch a true picture of life among the\r\nnon-slaveholding whites of the South, every intelligent man who has a\r\nspark of philanthropy in his breast, and who should happen to gaze upon\r\nthe picture, would burn with unquenchable indignation at that system of\r\nAfrican slavery which entails unutterable miseries on the superior race.\r\nIt is quite impossible, however, to describe accurately the deplorable\r\nignorance and squalid poverty of the class to which we refer. The serfs of\r\nRussia have reason to congratulate themselves that they are neither the\r\nnegroes nor the non-slaveholding whites of the South. Than the latter\r\nthere can be no people in Christendom more unhappily situated. Below will\r\nbe found a few extracts which will throw some light on the subject now\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nSays William Gregg, in an address delivered before the South Carolina\r\nInstitute, in 1851:--\r\n\r\n     \"From the best estimates that I have been able to make, I put down\r\n     the white people who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so\r\n     employed as to be wholly unproductive to the State, at one hundred\r\n     and twenty-five thousand. Any man who is an observer of things could\r\n     hardly pass through our country, without being struck with the fact\r\n     that all the capital, enterprise, and intelligence, is employed in\r\n     directing slave labor; and the consequence is, that a large portion\r\n     of our poor white people are wholly neglected, and are suffered to\r\n     while away an existence in a state but one step in advance of the\r\n     Indian of the forest. It is an evil of vast magnitude, and nothing\r\n     but a change in public sentiment will effect its cure. These people\r\n     must be brought into daily contact with the rich and\r\n     intelligent--they must be stimulated to mental action, and taught to\r\n     appreciate education and the comforts of civilized life; and this, we\r\n     believe, may be effected only by the introduction of manufactures. My\r\n     experience at Graniteville has satisfied me that unless our poor\r\n     people can be brought together in villages, and some means of\r\n     employment afforded them, it will be an utterly hopeless effort to\r\n     undertake to educate them. We have collected at that place about\r\n     eight hundred people, and as likely looking a set of country girls as\r\n     may be found--industrious and orderly people, but deplorably\r\n     ignorant, three-fourths of the adults not being able to read or to\r\n     write their own names.\r\n\r\n     \"It is only necessary to build a manufacturing village of shanties,\r\n     in a healthy location, in any part of the State, to have crowds of\r\n     these people around you, seeking employment at half the compensation\r\n     given to operatives at the North. It is indeed painful to be brought\r\n     in contact with such ignorance and degradation.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he asks:--\r\n\r\n     \"Shall we pass unnoticed the thousands of poor, ignorant, degraded\r\n     white people among us, who, in this land of plenty, live in\r\n     comparative nakedness and starvation? Many a one is reared in _proud_\r\n     South Carolina, from birth to manhood, who has never passed a month\r\n     in which he has not, some part of the time, been stinted for meat.\r\n     Many a mother is there who will tell you that her children are but\r\n     scantily provided with bread, and much more scantily with meat; and,\r\n     if they be clad with comfortable raiment, it is at the expense of\r\n     these scanty allowances of food. These may be startling statements,\r\n     but they are nevertheless true; and if not believed in Charleston,\r\n     the members of our legislature who have traversed the State in\r\n     electioneering campaigns can attest the truth.\"\r\n\r\nIn an article on \"_Manufactures in South Carolina_,\" published some time\r\nago in _DeBow's Review_, J. H. Taylor, of Charleston (S. C.) says:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is in some quarters, a natural jealousy of the slightest\r\n     innovation upon established habits, and because an effort has been\r\n     made to collect the poor and unemployed white population into our new\r\n     factories, fears have arisen that some evil would grow out of the\r\n     introduction of such establishments among us. * * * The poor man has\r\n     a vote as well as the rich man, and in our State the number of the\r\n     former will largely overbalance the latter. So long as these poor but\r\n     industrious people can see no mode of living except by a degrading\r\n     operation of work with the negro upon the plantation, they will be\r\n     content to endure life in its most discouraging forms, satisfied that\r\n     they are _above_ the slave, though faring often worse than he.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking in favor of manufactures, the Hon. J. H. Lumpkin, of Georgia,\r\nsaid in 1852:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is objected that these manufacturing establishments will become\r\n     the hotbeds of crime. But I am by no means ready to concede that our\r\n     poor, degraded, half-fed, half-clothed, and ignorant\r\n     population--without Sabbath Schools, or any other kind of\r\n     instruction, mental or moral, or without any just appreciation of\r\n     character--will be injured by giving them employment, which will\r\n     bring them under the oversight of employers, who will inspire them\r\n     with self-respect by taking an interest in their welfare.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paper on the \"_Extension of Cotton and Wool Factories at the South_,\"\r\nMr. Steadman, of Tennessee, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In Lowell, labor is paid the fair compensation of 80 cents a day for\r\n     men, and $2 a week for women, beside board, while in Tennessee the\r\n     average compensation for labor does not exceed 50 cents per day for\r\n     men, and $1,25 per week for women.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a speech which he delivered in Congress several years\r\nago, Mr. T. L. Clingman, of North Carolina, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Our manufacturing establishments can obtain the raw material\r\n     (cotton) at nearly two cents on the pound cheaper than the\r\n     New-England establishments. Labor is likewise one hundred per cent.\r\n     cheaper. In the upper parts of the State, the labor of either a free\r\n     man or a slave, including board, clothing, &c., can be obtained for\r\n     from $110 to $120 per annum. It will cost at least twice that sum in\r\n     New-England. The difference in the cost of female labor, whether free\r\n     or slave, is even greater.\"\r\n\r\nThe Richmond (Va.) _Dispatch_ says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We will only suppose that the ready-made shoes imported into this\r\n     city from the North, and sold here, were manufactured in Richmond.\r\n     What a great addition it would be to the means of employment! How\r\n     many boys and females would find the means of earning their bread,\r\n     who are now suffering for a regular supply of the necessaries of\r\n     life.\"\r\n\r\nA citizen of New-Orleans, writing in _DeBow's Review_, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"At present the sources of employment open to females (save in menial\r\n     offices) are very limited; and an inability to procure suitable\r\n     occupation is an evil much to be deplored, as tending in its\r\n     consequences to produce demoralization. The superior grades of female\r\n     labor may be considered such as imply a necessity for education on\r\n     the part of the employee, while the menial class is generally\r\n     regarded as of the lowest; and in a slave State, this standard is 'in\r\n     the lowest depths, a lower deep,' from the fact that, by association,\r\n     it is a reduction of the white servant to the level of their colored\r\n     fellow-menials.\"\r\n\r\nBlack slave labor, though far less valuable, is almost invariably better\r\npaid than free white labor. The reason is this: The fiat of the oligarchy\r\nhas made it _fashionable_ to \"have negroes around,\" and there are, we are\r\ngrieved to say, many non-slaveholding-whites, (lickspittles,) who, in\r\norder to retain on their premises a hired slave whom they falsely imagine\r\nsecures to them not only the appearance of wealth, but also a position of\r\nhigh social standing in the community, keep themselves in a perpetual\r\nstrait.\r\n\r\nLast Spring we made it our special business to ascertain the ruling rates\r\nof wages paid for labor, free and slave, in North Carolina. We found\r\nsober, energetic white men, between twenty and forty years of age, engaged\r\nin agricultural pursuits at a salary of $84 per annum--including board\r\nonly; negro men, slaves, who performed little more than half the amount of\r\nlabor, and who were exceedingly sluggish, awkward, and careless in all\r\ntheir movements, were hired out on adjoining farms at an average of about\r\n$115 per annum, including board, clothing, and medical attendance. Free\r\nwhite men and slaves were in the employ of the North Carolina Railroad\r\nCompany; the former, whose services, in our opinion, were at least twice\r\nas valuable as the services of the latter, received only $12 per month\r\neach; the masters of the latter received $16 per month for every slave so\r\nemployed. Industrious, tidy white girls, from sixteen to twenty years of\r\nage, had much difficulty in hiring themselves out as domestics in private\r\nfamilies for $40 per annum--board only included; negro wenches, slaves, of\r\ncorresponding ages, so ungraceful, stupid and filthy that no decent man\r\nwould ever permit one of them to cross the threshold of his dwelling, were\r\nin brisk demand at from $65 to $70 per annum, including victuals, clothes,\r\nand medical attendance. These are facts, and in considering them, the\r\nstudents of political and social economy will not fail to arrive at\r\nconclusions of their own.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the greater density of population in the free States,\r\nlabor of every kind is, on an average, about one hundred per cent. higher\r\nthere than it is in the slave States. This is another important fact, and\r\none that every non-slaveholding white should keep registered in his mind.\r\n\r\nPoverty, ignorance, and superstition, are the three leading\r\ncharacteristics of the non-slaveholding whites of the South. Many of them\r\ngrow up to the age of maturity, and pass through life without ever owning\r\nas much as five dollars at any one time. Thousands of them die at an\r\nadvanced age, as ignorant of the common alphabet as if it had never been\r\ninvented. All are more or less impressed with a belief in witches, ghosts,\r\nand supernatural signs. Few are exempt from habits of sensuality and\r\nintemperance. None have anything like adequate ideas of the duties which\r\nthey owe either to their God, to themselves, or to their fellow-men.\r\nPitiable, indeed, in the fullest sense of the term, is their condition.\r\n\r\nIt is the almost utter lack of an education that has reduced them to\r\ntheir present unenviable situation. In the whole South there is scarcely a\r\npublication of any kind devoted to their interests. They are now\r\ncompletely under the domination of the oligarchy, and it is madness to\r\nsuppose that they will ever be able to rise to a position of true manhood,\r\nuntil after the slave power shall have been utterly overthrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with some degree of hesitation that we add a chapter on Southern\r\nLiterature--not that the theme is inappropriate to this work; still less,\r\nthat it is an unfruitful one; but our hesitation results from our\r\nconscious inability, in the limited time and space at our command, to do\r\nthe subject justice. Few, except those whose experience has taught them,\r\nhave any adequate idea of the amount of preparatory labor requisite to the\r\nproduction of a work into which the statistical element largely enters;\r\nespecially is this so, when the statistics desired are not readily\r\naccessible through public and official documents. The author who honestly\r\naims at entire accuracy in his statements, may find himself baffled for\r\nweeks in his pursuit of a single item of information, not of much\r\nimportance in itself perhaps, when separately considered, but necessary in\r\nits connection with others, to the completion of a harmonious whole. Not\r\nunfrequently, during the preparation of the preceding pages, have we been\r\nsubjected to this delay and annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe following brief references to the protracted preparatory labors and\r\ninevitable delays to which authors are subjected, may interest our\r\nreaders, and induce them to regard with charity any deficiencies, either\r\nin detail or in general arrangement, which, owing to the necessary haste\r\nof preparation, these concluding pages of our work may exhibit:\r\n\r\nGoldsmith was engaged nine years in the preparation of \"_The Traveller_,\"\r\nand five years in gathering and arranging the incidents of his \"_Deserted\r\nVillage_,\" and two years in their versification.\r\n\r\nBancroft, the American Historian, has been more than thirty years engaged\r\nupon his History of the United States, from his projection of the work to\r\nthe present date; and that History is not yet completed.\r\n\r\nHildreth, a no less eminent historian, from the time he began to collect\r\nmaterials for his History of the United States to the date of its\r\ncompletion, devoted no less than twenty-five years to the work.\r\n\r\nWebster, our great lexicographer, gave thirty-five years of his life in\r\nbringing his Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language to the degree\r\nof accuracy and completeness in which we now find it.\r\n\r\nDr. John W. Mason, after ten years' labor in the accumulation of materials\r\nfor a Life of Alexander Hamilton, was compelled to relinquish the work on\r\naccount of impaired health.\r\n\r\nMr. James Banks, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who recently delivered a\r\nlecture upon the Life and Character of Flora McDonald, was eighteen years\r\nin the collection of his materials.\r\n\r\nOulibicheff, a distinguished Russian author, spent twenty-five years in\r\nwriting the Life of Mozart.\r\n\r\nExamples of this kind might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent.\r\nIndeed, almost all the poets, prose-writers, painters, sculptors,\r\ncomposers, and other devotees of Art, who have won undying fame for\r\nthemselves, have done so through long years of earnest and almost\r\nunremitted toil.\r\n\r\nWe are quite conscious that the fullness and accuracy of statement which\r\nare desirable in this chapter cannot be attained in the brief time allowed\r\nus for its completion; but, though much will necessarily be omitted that\r\nought to be said, we shall endeavor to make no statement of facts which\r\nare not well authenticated, and no inferences from the same which are not\r\nlogically true. We can only promise to do the best in our power, with the\r\nmaterials at our command, to exhibit the inevitable influence of slavery\r\nupon Southern Literature, and to demonstrate that the accursed institution\r\nso cherished by the oligarchy, is no less prejudicial to our advancement\r\nin letters, than it is destructive of our material prosperity.\r\n\r\nWhat is the actual condition of Literature at the South? Our question\r\nincludes more than simple authorship in the various departments of\r\nletters, from the compilation of a primary reader to the production of a\r\nScientific or Theological Treatise. We comprehend in it all the activities\r\nengaged in the creation, publication, and sale of books and periodicals,\r\nfrom the penny primer to the heavy folio, and from the dingy, coarse-typed\r\nweekly paper, to the large, well-filled daily.\r\n\r\nIt were unjust to deny a degree of intellectual activity to the South. It\r\nhas produced a few good authors--a few competent editors, and a moderately\r\nlarge number of clever magazinists, paragraphists, essayists and critics.\r\nAbsolutely, then, it must be conceded that the South has something that\r\nmay be called a literature; it is only when we speak of her in comparison\r\nwith the North, that we say, with a pardonably strong expression, \"The\r\nSouth has no literature.\" This was virtually admitted by more than one\r\nspeaker at the late \"Southern Convention\" at Savannah. Said a South\r\nCarolina orator on that occasion: \"It is important that the South _should\r\nhave_ a literature of her own, to defend her principles and her rights;\" a\r\nsufficiently plain concession that she has not, now, such a literature.\r\nBut _facts_ speak more significantly than the rounded periods of\r\nConvention orators. Let us look at facts, then.\r\n\r\nFirst, turning our attention to the periodical literature of the South, we\r\nobtain these results: By the census of 1850, we ascertain that the entire\r\nnumber of periodicals, daily, semi-weekly, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly\r\nand quarterly, published in the slave States, including the District of\r\nColumbia, were seven hundred and twenty-two. These had an aggregate\r\n_yearly_ circulation of ninety-two million one hundred and sixty-seven\r\nthousand one hundred and twenty-nine. (92,167,129). The number of\r\nperiodicals, of every class, published in the non-slaveholding States\r\n(exclusive of California) was one thousand eight hundred and ninety-three,\r\nwith an aggregate yearly circulation of three hundred and thirty-three\r\nmillion three hundred and eighty-six thousand and eighty-one.\r\n(333,386,081).\r\n\r\nWe are aware that there may be inaccuracies in the foregoing estimates;\r\nbut the compilers of the census, not we, are responsible for them.\r\nBesides, the figures are unquestionably as fair for the South as for the\r\nNorth; we accept them, therefore, as a just basis of our comparisons.\r\nNearly seven years have elapsed since these statistics were taken, and\r\nthese seven years have wrought an immense change in the journalism of the\r\nNorth, without any corresponding change in that of the South. It is\r\nnoteworthy that, as a general thing, the principal journals of the free\r\nStates are more comprehensive in their scope, more complete in every\r\ndepartment, and enlist, if not a higher order of talent, at least _more_\r\ntalent, than they did seven years ago. This improvement extends not only\r\nto the metropolitan, but to the country papers also. In fact, the very\r\nhighest literary ability, in finance, in political economy, in science, in\r\nstatism, in law, in theology, in medicine, in the belles-lettres, is laid\r\nunder contribution by the journals of the non-slaveholding States. This is\r\ntrue only to a very limited degree of Southern journals. Their position,\r\nwith but few exceptions, is substantially the same that it was ten years\r\nago. They are neither worse nor better--the imbecility and inertia which\r\nattaches to everything which slavery touches, clings to them now as\r\ntenaciously as it did when Henry A. Wise thanked God for the paucity of\r\nnewspapers in the Old Dominion, and the platitudes of \"Father\" Ritchie\r\nwere recognized as the political gospel of the South. They have not, so\r\nfar as we can learn, increased materially in number, nor in the aggregate\r\nof their yearly circulation. In the free States no week passes that does\r\nnot add to the number of their journals, and extend the circle of their\r\nreaders and their influence. Since the census tables to which we have\r\nreferred were prepared, two of the many excellent weekly journals of which\r\nthe city of New-York can boast, have sprung into being, and attained an\r\naggregate circulation more than twice as large as that of the entire\r\nnewspaper press of Virginia in 1850--and exceeding, by some thousands, the\r\naggregate circulation of the two hundred and fifty journals of which\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida, could\r\nboast at the time above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, we beg leave to introduce the following letter, kindly\r\nfurnished us by the proprietors of the N. Y. Tribune, in answer to\r\nenquiries which we addressed to them:--\r\n\r\n     TRIBUNE OFFICE, New York,}\r\n     30th May, 1857.          }\r\n\r\n     MR. H. R. HELPER,\r\n\r\n     _Sir_:--\r\n\r\n     In answer to your inquiry we inform you that we employ in our\r\n     building one hundred and seventy-six persons regularly: this does not\r\n     include our carriers and cartmen, nor does it include the men\r\n     employed in the Job Office in our building. During the past year we\r\n     have used in printing _The Tribune_, Forty-four thousand nine hundred\r\n     and seventy nine (44,979) reams of paper, weighing two million three\r\n     hundred and ten thousand one hundred and thirty (2,310,130) pounds.\r\n     We publish one hundred and seventy-six thousand copies of our weekly\r\n     edition, which goes to press, the second form, at 7-1/2 o'clock, A.\r\n     M. and is finished at 2 A. M. the next morning. Our mailers require\r\n     eighteen to nineteen hours to mail our Weekly, which makes from\r\n     thirty to thirty-two cart loads.\r\n\r\n     Very respectfully,\r\n     GREELEY & MCELRATH.\r\n\r\nThroughout the non-slaveholding States, the newspaper or magazine that has\r\n_not_ improved during the last decade of years, is an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule. Throughout the entire slaveholding States, the newspaper or\r\nmagazine that _has_ improved during that time, is no less an exception to\r\nthe general rule that there obtains. Outside of the larger cities of the\r\nSouth, there are not, probably, half a dozen newspapers in the whole\r\nslaveholding region that can safely challenge a comparison with the\r\ncountry-press of the North. What that country-press was twenty years ago,\r\nthe country-press of the South is now.\r\n\r\nWe do not deny that the South has produced able journalists; and that some\r\nof the newspapers of her principal cities exhibit a degree of enterprise\r\nand talent that cannot fail to command for them the respect of all\r\nintelligent men. But these journals, we regret to say, are marked\r\nexceptions to the general condition of the Southern press; and even the\r\nbest of these fall far below the standard of excellence attained by the\r\nleading journals of the North. In fact, whether our comparison embraces\r\nquantity only, or extends to both quantity and quality, it is found to be\r\nimmeasurably in favor of the non-slaveholding States, which in journalism,\r\nas in all other industrial pursuits, leave their slavery-cursed\r\ncompetitors at an infinite distance behind them, and thus vindicate the\r\nsuperiority of free institutions, which, recognizing labor as honorable,\r\nsecure its rewards for all.\r\n\r\nThe literary vassalage of the South to the North constitutes in itself a\r\nmost significant commentary upon the diatribes of the former concerning \"a\r\npurely Southern literature.\" To begin at the beginning--the Alphabetical\r\nBlocks and Educational tables from which our Southern abecedarian takes\r\nhis initial lesson, were projected and manufactured in the North. Going\r\nforward a step, we find the youngling intent in spelling short sentences,\r\nor gratifying his juvenile fondness for the fine arts by copying the\r\nwood-cuts from his Northern primer. Yet another step, and we discover him\r\nwith his Sanders' Reader, his Mitchell's Geography, his Emerson's\r\nArithmetic, all produced by Northern mind and Northern enterprise. There\r\nis nothing _wrong_ in this; it is only a little ridiculous in view of the\r\nfulminations of the Southern proslavery press against the North.\r\nOccasionally however we are amused by the efforts of the oligarchs to make\r\ntheir own school-books, or to root out of all educational text-books every\r\nreference to the pestilential heresy of freedom. A \"gentleman\" in\r\nCharleston, S. C. is devoting his energies to the preparation of a series\r\nof pro-slavery elementary works, consisting of primers, readers, &c.--and\r\nlo! they are all printed, stitched and bound north of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline! A single _fact_ like this is sufficient to overturn whole folios of\r\n_theory_ concerning the divinity of slavery. The truth is, that, not\r\nschool-books alone, but works of almost every class produced by the South,\r\ndepend upon Northern enterprise and skill for their introduction to the\r\npublic. Mr. DeBow, the eminent Statistician, publishes a Southern Review,\r\npurporting to be issued from New Orleans. It is printed and bound in the\r\ncity of New York. We clip the following paragraph from a recent number of\r\nthe Vicksburgh (Miss.) _Whig_:--\r\n\r\n     \"SOUTHERN ENTERPRIZE.--Even the Mississippi Legislature, at its late\r\n     session allowed its laws to go to Boston to be printed, and made an\r\n     appropriation of $3,000 to pay one of its members to go there and\r\n     read the proof sheets instead of having it done in the State, and\r\n     thereby assisting in building up a Southern publishing house. What a\r\n     commentary on the Yankee-haters!\"\r\n\r\nThe Greensboro (N. C.) _Patriot_ thus records a similar contribution, on\r\nthe part of that State, to \"the creation of a purely Southern Literature:\"\r\n\r\n     \"We have heard it said, that those who had the control of the\r\n     printing of the revised Statutes of North Carolina, in order to save\r\n     a few dimes, had the work executed in Boston, in preference to giving\r\n     the job to a citizen of this State. We impugn not the motives of the\r\n     agents in this matter; but it is a little humiliating that no work\r\n     except the commonest labor, can be done in North Carolina; that\r\n     everything which requires a little skill, capital, or ingenuity, must\r\n     be sent North. In the case under consideration, we have heard it\r\n     remarked, that when the whole bill of expenses connected with the\r\n     printing of the Revised Statutes in Boston was footed up, it only\r\n     amounted to a few thousand dollars more than the job would have cost\r\n     in this State. But then we have the consolation of knowing that the\r\n     book _came from the North_, and that it was printed among the\r\n     _abolitionists_ of Boston; the _peculiar friends_ of North Carolina\r\n     and the South generally.--Of course we ought to be willing to pay a\r\n     few extra thousands in consideration of these important facts!\"\r\n\r\nSouthern divines give us elaborate \"Bible Arguments;\" Southern statists\r\nheap treatise upon treatise through which the Federal Constitution is\r\ntortured into all monstrous shapes; Southern novelists bore us _ad\r\ninfinitum_ with pictures of the beatitudes of plantation life and the\r\nnegro-quarters; Southern verse-wrights drone out their drowsy dactyls or\r\ngrow ventricous with their turgid heroics all in defence of\r\nslavery,--priest, politician, novelist, bardling, severally ringing the\r\nchanges upon \"the Biblical institution,\" \"the conservative institution,\"\r\n\"the humanizing institution,\" \"the patriarchal institution\"--and\r\nthen--have their books printed on Northern paper, with Northern types, by\r\nNorthern artizans, stitched, bound and made ready for the market by\r\nNorthern industry; and yet fail to see in all this, as a true\r\nphilosophical mind _must_ see, an overwhelming refutation of their\r\nmiserable sophisms in behalf of a system against which humanity in all its\r\nimpulses and aspirations, and civilization in all its activities and\r\ntriumphs, utter their perpetual protest.\r\n\r\nFrom a curious article in the \"American Publishers Circular\" on \"Book\r\nMaking in America,\" we give the following extracts:\r\n\r\n     \"It is somewhat alarming to know that the number of houses now\r\n     actually engaged in the publishing of books, not including\r\n     periodicals, amounts to more than three hundred. About three-fourths\r\n     of these are engaged in Boston, New-York, Philadelphia, and\r\n     Baltimore--the balance being divided between Cincinnati, Buffalo,\r\n     Auburn, Albany, Louisville, Chicago, St. Louis, and a few other\r\n     places. There are more than three thousand booksellers who dispense\r\n     the publications of these three hundred, besides six or seven\r\n     thousand apothecaries, grocers, and hardware dealers, who connect\r\n     literature with drugs, molasses, and nails.\r\n\r\n     \"The best printing in America is probably now done in Cambridge; the\r\n     best cloth binding in Boston, and the best calf and morocco in\r\n     New-York and Philadelphia. In these two latter styles we are, as yet,\r\n     a long distance from Heyday, the pride of London. His finish is\r\n     supreme. There is nothing between it and perfection.\r\n\r\n     \"Books have multiplied to such an extent in our country, that it now\r\n     takes 750 paper mills, with 2,000 engines in constant operation, to\r\n     supply the printers, who work day and night, endeavoring to keep\r\n     their engagements with publishers. These tireless mills produced\r\n     270,000,000 pounds of paper the past year, which immense supply has\r\n     sold for about $27,000,000. A pound and a quarter of rags were\r\n     required for a pound of paper, and 400,000,000 pounds were therefore\r\n     consumed in this way last year. The cost of manufacturing a twelve\r\n     months' supply of paper for the United States, aside from labor and\r\n     rags, is computed at $4,000,000. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"The Harper establishment, the largest of our publishing houses,\r\n     covers half an acre of ground. If old Mr. Caxton, who printed those\r\n     stories of the Trojan war so long ago, could follow the Ex-Mayor of\r\n     New-York in one of his morning rounds in Franklin Square, he would\r\n     be, to say the least, a little surprised. He would see in one room\r\n     the floor loaded with the weight of 150 tons of presses. The\r\n     electrotyping process would puzzle him somewhat; the drying and\r\n     pressing process would startle him; the bustle would make his head\r\n     ache; and the stock-room would quite finish him. An edition of\r\n     Harpers' Monthly Magazine alone consists of 175,000. Few persons have\r\n     any idea how large a number this is as applied to the edition of a\r\n     book. It is computed that if these magazines were to rain down, and\r\n     one man should attempt to pick them up like chips, it would take him\r\n     a fortnight to pick up the copies of one single number, supposing him\r\n     to pick up one every second, and to work ten hours a day.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The rapidity with which books are now manufactured is almost\r\n     incredible. A complete copy of one of Bulwer's novels, published\r\n     across the water in three volumes, and reproduced here in one, was\r\n     swept through the press in New-York in fifty hours, and offered for\r\n     sale smoking hot in the streets. The fabulous edifice proposed by a\r\n     Yankee from Vermont, no longer seems an impossibility. 'Build the\r\n     establishment according to my plan,' said he; 'drive a sheep in at\r\n     one end, and he shall immediately come out at the other, four\r\n     quarters of lamb, a felt hat, a leather apron, and a quarto Bible.'\"\r\n\r\nThe business of the Messrs. Harper, whose establishment is referred to in\r\nthe foregoing extract, is probably more generally diffused over every\r\nsection of this country than that of any other publishing house. From\r\nenquiries recently made of them we learn that they issue, on an average,\r\n3,000 bound volumes per day, throughout the year, and that each volume\r\nwill average 500 pages--making a total of about one million of volumes,\r\nand not less than five hundred millions of pages per annum. This does not\r\ninclude the Magazine and books in pamphlet form, each of which contains as\r\nmuch matter as a bound volume.--Their bills for paper exceed $300,000\r\nannually, and as the average cost is fifteen cents per pound, they consume\r\nmore than two millions of pounds--say one thousand tons of white paper.\r\n\r\nThere are regularly employed in their own premises about 550 persons,\r\nincluding printers, binders, engravers, and clerks. These are all paid in\r\nfull once a fortnight in bankable money. Besides these, there are numerous\r\nauthors and artists in every section of the country, who furnish\r\nmanuscripts and illustrations, on terms generally satisfactory to all the\r\nparties interested.\r\n\r\nThe Magazine has a monthly circulation of between 115,000 and 200,000, or\r\nabout two millions of copies annually. Each number of the Magazine is\r\nclosed up about the fifth of the month previous to its date. Three or four\r\ndays thereafter the mailing begins, commencing with more distant\r\nsubscribers, all of whom are supplied before any copies are sold for\r\ndelivery in New-York. The intention of the publishers is, that it shall be\r\ndelivered as nearly as possible on the same day in St. Louis,\r\nNew-Orleans, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston, and New-York. It takes from\r\nten to twelve days to dispatch the whole edition, (which weighs between\r\nfour and five tons,) by mail and express.\r\n\r\nTheir new periodical, \"Harpers' Weekly,\" has, in a little more than four\r\nmonths, reached a sale of nearly 70,000 copies. The mailing of this\r\ncommences on Tuesday night, and occupies about three days.\r\n\r\nEx-Mayor Harper, whom we have found to be one of the most affable and\r\nestimable gentlemen in the city of New-York, informed us, sometime ago,\r\nthat, though he had no means of knowing positively, he was of the opinion\r\nthat about eighty per cent. of all their publications find final\r\npurchasers in the free States--the remainder, about twenty per cent., in\r\nthe slave States. Yet it is probable that, with one or two exceptions, no\r\nother publishing house in the country has so large a per centage of\r\nSouthern trade.\r\n\r\nOf the \"more than three hundred houses engaged in the publication of\r\nbooks,\" to which the writer in the \"American Publishers' Circular\" refers,\r\nupwards of nine-tenths of the number are in the non-slaveholding States,\r\nand these represent not less than ninety-nine hundredths of the whole\r\ncapital invested in the business. Baltimore has twice as many publishers\r\nas any other Southern city; and nearly as many as the whole South beside.\r\nThe census returns of 1850 give but twenty-four publishers for the entire\r\nSouth, and ten of these were in Maryland. The relative disproportion which\r\nthen existed in this branch of enterprise, between the North and the\r\nSouth, still exists; or, if it has been changed at all, that change is in\r\nfavor of the North. So of all the capital, enterprise and industry\r\ninvolved in the manufacture of the _material_ that enters into the\r\ncomposition of books. All the paper manufactories of the South do not\r\nproduce enough to supply a single publishing house in the city of\r\nNew-York.--Perhaps \"a Southern Literature\" does not necessarily involve\r\nthe enterprises requisite to the _manufacture_ of books; but experience\r\nhas shown that there is a somewhat intimate relation between the author,\r\nprinter, paper-maker and publisher; in other words, that the intellectual\r\nactivity which expresses itself in books, is measurable by the mechanical\r\nactivities engaged in their manufacture.--Thus a State that is fruitful in\r\nauthors will almost necessarily be fruitful in publishers; and the number\r\nof both classes will be proportioned to the _reading_ population. The\r\npoverty of Southern literature is legitimately shown, therefore, in the\r\npaucity of Southern publishers. We do not deny a high degree of cultivated\r\ntalent to the South; we are familiar with the names of her sons whose\r\ngenius has made them eminent; all that we insist upon is, that the same\r\naccursed influence which has smitten her industrial enterprises with\r\nparalysis, and retarded indefinitely her material advancement, has exerted\r\na corresponding influence upon her literature. How it has done this we\r\nshall more fully indicate before we close the chapter.\r\n\r\nAt the \"Southern Convention\" held some months since at Savannah, a good\r\ndeal was said about \"Southern literature,\" and many suggestions made in\r\nreference to the best means for its promotion. One speaker thought that\r\n\"they could get text-books at home without going to either Old England or\r\nNew England for them.\" Well--they can try. The effort will not harm them;\r\nnor the North either. The orator was confident \"that the South had talent\r\nenough to do anything that needs to be done, and independence enough to do\r\nit.\" The _talent_ we shall not deny; the _independence_ we are ready to\r\nbelieve in when we see it. When she throws off the incubus of slavery\r\nunder which she goes staggering like the Sailor of Bagdad under the weight\r\nof the Old Man of the Sea, she will prove her independence, and\r\ndemonstrate her ability \"to do anything that needs to be done.\" Till then\r\nshe is but a fettered giant, whose vitals are torn by the dogs which her\r\nown folly has engendered.\r\n\r\nAnother speaker, on the occasion referred to, half-unconsciously it would\r\nseem, threw a gleam of light upon the subject under discussion, which, had\r\nnot himself and his hearers been bat-blind, would have revealed the clue\r\nthat conducts from the darkness in which they burrow to the day of\r\nredemption for the South. Said he:--\r\n\r\n     \"Northern publishers employ the talent of the South and of the whole\r\n     country to write for them, and pour out thousands annually for it;\r\n     but Southern men expect to get talent without paying for it. The\r\n     _Southern Quarterly Review_ and the _Literary Messenger_ are\r\n     literally struggling for existence, for want of material aid. * * *\r\n     It is not the South that builds up Northern literature--_they do it\r\n     themselves_. There is talent and mind and poetic genius enough in the\r\n     South to build up a literature of a high order; but Southern\r\n     publishers cannot get money enough to assist them in their\r\n     enterprises, and, therefore, the South has no literature.\r\n\r\nHere are truths. \"Southern men expect to get talent without paying for\r\nit.\" A very natural expectation, considering that they have been\r\naccustomed to have all their material wants supplied by the uncompensated\r\ntoil of their slaves. In this instance it may seem an absurd one, but it\r\nresults legitimately from the system of slavery. That system, in fact,\r\noperates in a two-fold way against the Southern publisher: first, by its\r\npractical repudiation of the scriptural axiom that the laborer is worthy\r\nof his hire; and secondly, by restricting the circle of readers through\r\nthe ignorance which it inevitably engenders. How is it that the people of\r\nthe North build up their literature?--Two words reveal the secret:\r\n_intelligence--compensation_. They are _a reading people_--the poorest\r\nartizan or day-laborer has his shelf of books, or his daily or weekly\r\npaper, whose contents he seldom fails to master before retiring at night;\r\nand _they are accustomed to pay for all the books and papers which they\r\nperuse_. Readers and payers--these are the men who insure the prosperity\r\nof publishers. Where a system of enforced servitude prevails, it is very\r\napt to beget loose notions about the obligation of paying for anything;\r\nand many minds fail to see the distinction, morally, between compelling\r\nSambo to pick cotton without paying him wages, or compelling Lippincott &\r\nCo. to manufacture books for the planter's pleasure or edification upon\r\nthe same liberal terms. But more than this--where a system of enforced\r\nservitude prevails, a fearful degree of ignorance prevails also, as its\r\nnecessary accompaniment. The enslaved masses are, of course, thrust back\r\nfrom the fountains of knowledge by the strong arm of law, while the poor\r\nnon-slaveholding classes are almost as effectually excluded from the\r\ninstitutions of learning by their poverty--the sparse population of\r\nslaveholding districts being unfavorable to the maintenance of free\r\nschools, and the exigencies of their condition forbidding them to avail\r\nthemselves of any more costly educational privileges.\r\n\r\nNorthern publishers can \"employ the talent of the South and of the whole\r\ncountry to write for them, and pour out thousands annually for it,\" simply\r\nbecause a _reading_ population, accustomed to _pay_ for the service which\r\nit receives, enables them to do so. A similar population at the South\r\nwould enable Southern publishers to do the same. Substitute free labor for\r\nslave labor, the institutions of freedom for those of slavery, and it\r\nwould not long remain true that \"Southern publishers cannot get money\r\nenough to assist them in their enterprises, and therefore the South has no\r\nliterature.\" This is the discovery which the South Carolina orator from\r\nwhom we quote, but narrowly escaped making, when he stood upon its very\r\nedge, and rounded his periods with the truths in whose unapprehended\r\nmeanings was hidden this germ of redemption for a nation.\r\n\r\nThe self-stultification of folly, however, was never more evident than it\r\nis in the current gabble of the oligarchs about a \"Southern literature.\"\r\nThey do not mean by it a healthy, manly, normal utterance of unfettered\r\nminds, without which there can be no proper literature; but an emasculated\r\nsubstitute therefor, from which the element of freedom is eliminated;\r\nhusks, from which the kernel has escaped--a body, from which the\r\nvitalizing spirit has fled--a literature which ignores manhood by\r\nconfounding it with brutehood; or, at best, deals with all similes of\r\nfreedom as treason against the \"peculiar institution.\" There is not a\r\nsingle great name in the literary annals of the old or new world that\r\ncould dwarf itself to the stature requisite to gain admission into the\r\nPantheon erected by these devotees of the Inane for their Lilliputian\r\ndeities. Thank God, a \"Southern literature,\" in the sense intended by the\r\nchampions of slavery, is a simple impossibility, rendered such by that\r\nexility of mind which they demand in its producers as a prerequisite to\r\nadmission into the guild of Southern authorship. The tenuous thoughts of\r\nsuch authorlings could not survive a single breath of manly criticism. The\r\nhistory of the rise, progress, and decline of their literature could be\r\neasily written on a child's smooth palm, and leave space enough for its\r\nfuneral oration and epitaph. The latter might appropriately be that which,\r\nin one of our rural districts, marks the grave of a still-born infant:--\r\n\r\n  \"If so early I am done for,\r\n  I wonder what I was begun for!\"\r\n\r\nWe desire to see the South bear its just proportion in the literary\r\nactivities and achievements of our common country. It has never yet done\r\nso, and it never will until its own manhood is vindicated in the abolition\r\nof slavery. The impulse which such a measure would give to all industrial\r\npursuits that deal with the elements of material prosperity, would be\r\nimparted also to the no less valuable but more intangible creations of the\r\nmind. Take from the intellect of the South the incubus which now oppresses\r\nit, and its rebound would be glorious; the era of its diviner\r\ninspirations would begin; and its triumphs would be a perpetual\r\nvindication of the superiority of free institutions over those of slavery.\r\n\r\nTo Duyckinck's \"Cyclopedia of American Literature\"--a sort of\r\n_Omnium-gatherum_ that reminds one of Jeremiah's figs--we are indebted for\r\nthe following facts: The whole number of \"American authors\" whose place of\r\nnativity is given, is five hundred and sixty-nine. Of these seventy-nine\r\nwere foreign born, eighty-seven were natives of the South, and four\r\nhundred and three--a vast majority of the whole, first breathed the vital\r\nair in the free North. Many of those who were born in the South, received\r\ntheir education in the North, quite a number of whom became permanent\r\nresidents thereof. Still, for the purposes of this computation, we count\r\nthem on the side of the South. Yet how significant the comparison which\r\nthis computation furnishes! Throwing the foreign born (adopted citizens,\r\nmostly residents of the North) out of the reckoning, and the record\r\nstands,--Northern authors _four hundred and three_; Southern,\r\n_eighty-seven_--a difference of three hundred and sixteen in favor of the\r\nNorth! And this, probably, indicates very fairly the relative intellectual\r\nactivity of the two sections.\r\n\r\nWe accept the facts gleaned from Duyckinck's work as a basis, simply, of\r\nour estimate: not as being absolutely accurate in themselves, though they\r\nare doubtless reliable in the main, and certainly as fair for the South as\r\nthey are for the North. We might dissent from the judgment of the compiler\r\nin reference to the propriety of applying the term \"literature\" to much\r\nthat his compilation contains; but as tastes have proverbially differed\r\nfrom the days of the venerable dame who kissed her cow--not to extend our\r\nresearches into the condition of things anterior to that interesting\r\nevent--we will not insist upon _our_ view of the matter, but take it for\r\ngranted that he has disentombed from forgotten reviews, newspapers,\r\npamphlets, and posters, a fair relative proportion of \"authors\" for both\r\nNorth and South, for which \"American Literature\" is unquestionably under\r\ninfinite obligations to him!\r\n\r\nGriswold's \"Poets and Poetry of America\" and Thomas Buchanan Read's\r\n\"Female Poets of America\" furnish evidence, equally conclusive, of the\r\nbenumbing influence of slavery upon the intellect of a country. Of course,\r\nthese compilers say nothing about Slavery, and probably never thought of\r\nit in connection with their respective works, but none the less\r\nsignificant on that account is the testimony of the _facts_ which they\r\ngive. From the last edition of Griswold's compilation, (which contains the\r\nnames of none of our female writers, he having included them in a separate\r\nvolume) we find the names of one hundred and forty-one writers of verse:\r\nof these _one_ was foreign-born, _seventeen_ natives of the slaveholding,\r\nand _one hundred and twenty-three_ of the non-slaveholding States. Of our\r\nfemale poets, whose nativity is given by Mr. Read, _eleven_ are natives of\r\nthe South; and _seventy-three_ of the North! These simple arithmetical\r\nfigures are God's eternal Scripture against the folly and madness of\r\nSlavery, and need no aid of rhetoric to give emphasis to the startling\r\neloquence of their revelations.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, literature is not to be estimated by cubic feet or pounds\r\naverdupois, nor measured by the bushel or the yardstick. Quality, rather\r\nthan quantity, is the true standard of estimation. The fact, however,\r\nmatters little for our present purpose; for the South, we are sorry to\r\nsay, is as much behind the North in the former as in the latter. We do not\r\nforget the names of Gayarre, Benton, Simms, and other eminent citizens of\r\nthe Slave States, who have by their contributions to American letters\r\nconferred honor upon themselves and upon our common country, when we\r\naffirm, that those among our authors who enjoy a cosmopolitan reputation,\r\nare, with a few honorable exceptions, natives of the Free North; and that\r\nthe names which most brilliantly illustrate our literature, in its every\r\ndepartment, are those which have grown into greatness under the nurturing\r\ninfluence of free institutions. \"Comparisons are odious,\" it is said; and\r\nwe will not, unnecessarily, render them more so, in the present instance,\r\nby contrasting, name by name, the literary men of the South with the\r\nliterary men of the North. We do not depreciate the former, nor\r\noverestimate the latter. But let us ask, whence come our geographers, our\r\nastronomers, our chemists, our meteorologists, our ethnologists, and\r\nothers, who have made their names illustrious in the domain of the Natural\r\nSciences? Not from the Slave States, certainly. In the Literature of Law,\r\nthe South can furnish no name that can claim peership with those of Story\r\nand of Kent; in History, none that tower up to the altitude of Bancroft,\r\nPrescott, Hildreth, Motley and Washington Irving; in Theology, none that\r\ncan challenge favorable comparison with those of Edwards, Dwight,\r\nChanning, Taylor, Bushnell, Tyler and Wayland in Fiction, none that take\r\nrank with Cooper, and Mrs. Stowe; and but few that may do so with even the\r\nsecond class novelists of the North;[9] in Poetry, none that can command\r\nposition with Bryant, Halleck, and Percival, with Whittier, Longfellow,\r\nand Lowell, with Willis, Stoddard and Taylor, with Holmes, Saxe, and\r\nBurleigh; and--we might add twenty other Northern names before we found\r\ntheir Southern peer, with the exception of poor Poe, who, within a narrow\r\nrange of subjects, showed himself a poet of consummate art, and occupies a\r\nsort of debatable ground between our first and second-class writers.\r\n\r\nWe might extend this comparison to our writers in every department of\r\nletters, from the compiler of school-books to the author of the most\r\nprofound ethical treatise, and with precisely the same result. But we\r\nforbear. The task is distasteful to our State pride, and would have been\r\nentirely avoided had not a higher principle urged us to its performance.\r\nIt remains for us now to enquire,\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS PRODUCED THIS LITERARY PAUPERISM OF THE SOUTH? One single word,\r\nmost pregnant in its terrible meanings, answers the question. That word\r\nis--SLAVERY! But we have been so long accustomed to the ugly thing itself,\r\nand have become so familiar with its no less ugly fruits, that the common\r\nmind fails to apprehend the connection between the one, as cause, and the\r\nother as effect; and it therefore becomes necessary to give a more\r\ndetailed answer to our interrogatory.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, the conditions requisite to a flourishing literature are\r\nwanting at the South. These are--\r\n\r\nI. Readers. The people of the South are not a reading people. Many of the\r\nadult population never learned to read; still more, do not care to read.\r\nWe have been impressed, during a temporary sojourn in the North, with the\r\ndifference between the middle and laboring classes in the Free States, and\r\nthe same classes in the Slave States, in this respect. Passing along the\r\ngreat routes of travel in the former, or taking our seat in the\r\ncomfortable cars that pass up and down the avenues of our great commercial\r\nmetropolis, we have not failed to contrast the employment of our\r\nfellow-passengers with that which occupies the attention of the\r\ncorresponding classes on our various Southern routes of travel. In the one\r\ncase, a large proportion of the passengers seem intent upon mastering the\r\ncontents of the newspaper, or some recently published book. The merchant,\r\nthe mechanic, the artizan, the professional man, and even the common\r\nlaborer, going to or returning from their daily avocations, are busy with\r\ntheir morning or evening paper, or engaged in an intelligent discussion of\r\nsome topic of public interest. This is their leisure hour, and it is given\r\nto the acquisition of such information as may be of immediate or ultimate\r\nuse, or to the cultivation of a taste for elegant literature. In the other\r\ncase, newspapers and books seem generally ignored, and noisy discussions\r\nof village and State politics, the tobacco and cotton crops, filibusterism\r\nin Cuba, Nicaragua, or Sonora, the price of negroes generally, and\r\nespecially of \"fine-looking wenches,\" the beauties of lynch-law, the\r\ndelights of horse-racing, the excitement of street fights with\r\nbowie-knives and revolvers, the \"manifest destiny\" theory that justifies\r\nthe stealing of all territory contiguous to our own, and kindred topics,\r\nconstitute the warp and woof of conversation. All this is on a level with\r\nthe general intelligence of the Slave States. It is true, these States\r\nhave their educated men,--the majority of whom owe their literary culture\r\nto the colleges of the North. Not that there are no Southern colleges--for\r\nthere are institutions, so called, in a majority of the Slave\r\nStates.--Some of them, too, are not deficient in the appointments\r\nrequisite to our higher educational institutions; but as a general thing,\r\nSouthern colleges are colleges only in _name_, and will scarcely take rank\r\nwith a third-rate Northern academy, while our academies, with a few\r\nexceptions, are immeasurably inferior to the public schools of New-York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Boston. The truth is, there is a vast inert mass of\r\nstupidity and ignorance, too dense for individual effort to enlighten or\r\nremove, in all communities cursed with the institution of slavery.\r\nDisguise the unwelcome truth as we may, slavery is the parent of\r\nignorance, and ignorance begets a whole brood of follies and of vices, and\r\nevery one of these is inevitably hostile to literary culture. The masses,\r\nif they think of literature at all, think of it only as a costly luxury,\r\nto be monopolized by the few.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of white adults over twenty years of age, in each State,\r\nwho cannot read and write, to the _whole_ white population, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Connecticut,    1 to every 568\r\n  Vermont,        1      \"   473\r\n  N. Hampshire,   1      \"   310\r\n  Massachusetts,  1      \"   166\r\n  Maine,          1      \"   108\r\n  Michigan,       1      \"    97\r\n  Rhode Island,   1      \"    67\r\n  New Jersey,     1      \"    58\r\n  New York,       1      \"    56\r\n  Pennsylvania,   1      \"    50\r\n  Ohio,           1      \"    43\r\n  Indiana,        1      \"    18\r\n  Illinois,       1      \"    17\r\n\r\n  Louisiana,       1 to every 38-1/2\r\n  Maryland         1      \"   27\r\n  Mississippi,     1      \"   20\r\n  Delaware,        1      \"   18\r\n  South Carolina,  1      \"   17\r\n  Missouri,        1      \"   16\r\n  Alabama,         1      \"   15\r\n  Kentucky,        1      \"   13-1/2\r\n  Georgia,         1      \"   13\r\n  Virginia,        1      \"   12-1/2\r\n  Arkansas,        1      \"   11-1/2\r\n  Tennessee,       1      \"   11\r\n  North Carolina,  1      \"    7\r\n\r\nIn this table, Illinois and Indiana are the only Free States which, in\r\npoint of education, are surpassed by any of the Slave States; and this\r\ndisgraceful fact is owing, principally, to the influx of foreigners, and\r\nto immigrants from the Slave States. New-York, Rhode Island, and\r\nPennsylvania have also a large foreign element in their population, that\r\nswells very considerably this percentage of ignorance. For instance,\r\nNew-York shows, by the last census, a population of 98,722 who cannot read\r\nand write, and of this number 68,052 are foreigners; Rhode Island, 3,607,\r\nof whom 2,359 are foreigners; Pennsylvania, 76,272, of whom 24,989 are\r\nforeigners. On the other hand, the ignorance of the Slave States is\r\nprincipally _native_ ignorance, but comparatively few emigrants from\r\nEurope seeking a home upon a soil cursed with \"the peculiar institution.\"\r\nNorth Carolina has a foreign population of only 340, South Carolina only\r\n104, Arkansas only 27, Tennessee only 505, and Virginia only 1,137, who\r\ncannot read and write; while the aggregate of _native_ ignorance in these\r\nfive States (exclusive of the _slaves_, who are debarred all education by\r\n_law_) is 278,948! No longer ago than 1837, Governor Clarke, of Kentucky,\r\nin his message to the Legislature of that State, declared that \"by the\r\ncomputation of those most familiar with the subject, _one-third of the\r\nadult population of the State are unable to write their names_;\" and\r\nGovernor Campbell, of Virginia, reported to the Legislature, that \"from\r\nthe returns of ninety-eight clerks, it appeared that of 4,614 applications\r\nfor marriage licenses in 1837, no less than 1,047 were made by men unable\r\nto write.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Slave States the proportion of free white children between the ages\r\nof five and twenty, who are found at any school or college, is not quite\r\n_one-fifth_ of the whole; in the Free States, the proportion is more than\r\n_three-fifths_.\r\n\r\nWe could fill our pages with facts like these to an almost indefinite\r\nextent, but it cannot be necessary. No truth is more demonstrable, nay, no\r\ntruth has been more abundantly demonstrated, than this: that Slavery is\r\nhostile to general education; its strength, its very life, is in the\r\nignorance and stolidity of the masses; it naturally and necessarily\r\nrepresses general literary culture. To talk, therefore, of the \"creation\r\nof a purely Southern Literature,\" without _readers_ to demand, or\r\n_writers_ to produce it, is the mere babble of idiocy.\r\n\r\nII. Another thing essential to the creation of a literature is MENTAL\r\nFREEDOM. How much of _that_ is to be found in the region of Slavery? We\r\nwill not say that there is _none_; but if it exists, it exists as the\r\noutlawed antagonist of human chattelhood. He who believes that the\r\ndespotism of the accursed institution expends its malignant forces upon\r\nthe _slave_, leaving intact the white and (so called) free population, is\r\nthe victim of a most monstrous delusion. One end of the yoke that bows the\r\nAfrican to the dust, presses heavily upon the neck of his Anglo-Saxon\r\nmaster. The entire mind of the South either stultifies itself into\r\nacquiescence with Slavery, succumbs to its authority, or chafes in\r\nindignant protest against its monstrous pretensions and outrageous\r\nusurpations. A free press is an institution almost unknown at the South.\r\nFree speech is considered as treason against slavery: and when people dare\r\nneither speak nor print their thoughts, free thought itself is well nigh\r\nextinguished. All that can be said in _defence_ of human bondage, may be\r\nspoken freely; but question either its morality or its policy, and the\r\nterrors of lynch law are at once invoked to put down the pestilent heresy.\r\nThe legislation of the Slave States for the suppression of the freedom of\r\nspeech and the press, is disgraceful and cowardly to the last degree, and\r\ncan find its parallel only in the meanest and bloodiest despotisms of the\r\nOld World. No institution that could bear the light would thus sneakingly\r\nseek to burrow itself in utter darkness. Look, too, at the mobbings,\r\nlynchings, robberies, social and political proscriptions, and all manner\r\nof nameless outrages, to which men in the South have been subjected,\r\nsimply upon the suspicion that they were the enemies of Slavery. We could\r\nfill page after page of this volume with the record of such atrocities.\r\nBut a simple reference to them is enough. Our countrymen have not yet\r\nforgotten why John C. Underwood was, but a few months since, banished from\r\nhis home in Virginia, and the accomplished Hedreck driven from his College\r\nprofessorship in North Carolina. They believed Slavery inimical to the\r\nbest interest of the South, and for daring to give expression to this\r\nbelief in moderate yet manly language, they were ostracised by the\r\ndespotic Slave Power, and compelled to seek a refuge from its vengeance in\r\nStates where the principles of freedom are better understood. Pending the\r\nlast Presidential election, there were thousands, nay, tens of thousands\r\nof voters in the Slave States, who desired to give their suffrages for the\r\nRepublican nominee, John C. Fremont, himself a Southron, but a\r\nnon-slaveholder. The Constitution of the United States guaranteed to these\r\nmen an expression of their preference at the ballot-box. But were they\r\npermitted such an expression? Not at all. They were denounced, threatened,\r\noverawed, by the Slave Power--and it is not too much to say that there was\r\nreally no _Constitutional election_,--that is, no such free expression of\r\npolitical preferences as the Constitution aims to secure--in a majority of\r\nthe Slave States.\r\n\r\nFrom a multiplicity of facts like these, the inference is unavoidable,\r\nthat Slavery tolerates no freedom of the press--no freedom of speech--no\r\nfreedom of opinion. To expect that a whole-souled, manly literature can\r\nflourish under such conditions, is as absurd as it would be to look for\r\nhealth amid the pestilential vapors of a dungeon, or for the continuance\r\nof animal life without the aid of oxygen.\r\n\r\nIII. Mental activity--force--enterprise--are requisite to the creation of\r\nliterature. Slavery tends to sluggishness--imbecility--inertia. Where free\r\nthought is treason, the masses will not long take the trouble of thinking\r\nat all. Desuetude begets incompetence--the _dare-not_ soon becomes the\r\n_cannot_. The mind thus enslaved, necessarily loses its interest in the\r\nprocesses of other minds; and its tendency is to sink down into absolute\r\nstolidity or sottishness. Our remarks find melancholy confirmation in the\r\nabject servilism in which multitudes of the non-slaveholding whites of the\r\nSouth are involved. In them, ambition, pride, self-respect, hope, seem\r\nalike extinct. Their slaveholding fellows are, in some respects, in a\r\nstill more unhappy condition--helpless, nerveless, ignorant, selfish; yet\r\nvain-glorious, self-sufficient and brutal. Are these the chosen architects\r\nwho are expected to build up \"a purely Southern literature?\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, slavery destroys, or vitiates, or pollutes, whatever it\r\ntouches. No interest of society escapes the influence of its clinging\r\ncurse. It makes Southern religion a stench in the nostrils of\r\nChristendom--it makes Southern politics a libel upon all the principles of\r\nRepublicanism--it makes Southern literature a travesty upon the honorable\r\nprofession of letters. Than the better class of Southern authors\r\nthemselves, none will feel more keenly the truth of our remarks. They\r\nwrite books, but can find for them neither publishers nor remunerative\r\nsales at the South. The executors of Calhoun seek, for his works, a\r\nNorthern publisher. Benton writes history and prepares voluminous\r\ncompilations, which are given to the world through a Northern publisher.\r\nSimms writes novels and poems, and they are scattered abroad from the\r\npresses of a Northern publisher. Eighty per cent. of all the copies sold\r\nare probably bought by Northern readers.\r\n\r\nWhen will Southern authors understand their own interests? When will the\r\nSouth, as a whole, abandoning its present suicidal policy, enter upon that\r\ncareer of prosperity, greatness, and true renown, to which God by his word\r\nand his providences, is calling it? \"If thou take away from the midst of\r\nthee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity; and if\r\nthou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul; then\r\nshall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday: And\r\nthe Lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought, and\r\nmake fat thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a\r\nspring of water, whose waters fail not. And they that shall be of thee\r\nshall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of\r\nmany generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach,\r\nThe restorer of paths to dwell in.\"\r\n\r\nOur limits, not our materials, are exhausted. We would gladly say more,\r\nbut can only, in conclusion, add as the result of our investigations in\r\nthis department of our subject, that _Literature and Liberty are\r\ninseparable; the one can never have a vigorous existence without being\r\nwedded to the other_.\r\n\r\nOur work is done. It is the voice of the non-slaveholding whites of the\r\nSouth, through one identified with them by interest, by feeling, by\r\nposition. That voice, by whomsoever spoken, must yet be heard and heeded.\r\nThe time hastens--the doom of slavery is written--the redemption of the\r\nSouth draws nigh.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of our readers, we know not how we can give more forcible\r\nexpression to our thoughts and intentions than by saying that, in concert\r\nwith the intelligent free voters of the North, we, the non-slaveholding\r\nwhites of the South, expect to elevate JOHN C. FREMONT, CASSIUS M. CLAY,\r\nJAMES G. BIRNEY, or some other Southern non-slaveholder, to the Presidency\r\nin 1860; and that the patriot thus elevated to that dignified station\r\nwill, through our cordial co-operation, be succeeded by WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\nCHARLES SUMNER, JOHN MCLEAN, or some other non-slaveholder of the\r\nNorth;--and furthermore, that if, in these or in any other similar cases,\r\nthe oligarchs do not quietly submit to the will of a constitutional\r\nmajority of the people, as expressed at the ballot-box, the first battle\r\nbetween freedom and slavery will be fought at home--and may God defend the\r\nright!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract of the Author's Plan for the Abolition of Slavery, 155.\r\n\r\nAchenwall, 29.\r\n\r\nAdams, John Quincy, 239.\r\n\r\nAgriculture and other out-door pursuits, number of free white male\r\nSouthrons engaged in, 298.\r\n\r\nAgricultural Products.--See Corn, Wheat, Rye, Oats, Barley, Hay, Cotton,\r\nTobacco, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAnimals Slaughtered, Value of, 71.\r\n\r\nAnti-slavery Letters from native Southrons, 374.\r\n\r\nArea of the several States and Territories, 143.\r\n\r\nAristotle, 256.\r\n\r\nAttorneys-General, 312.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaltimore, Letter from the Mayor of, 337.\r\n\r\nBaltimore, Past, Present, and Future, 352.\r\n\r\nBaltimore, Why this Work was not published there, 360.\r\n\r\nBancroft, George, 384.\r\n\r\nBank Capital of the several States, 286.\r\n\r\nBanks, James, 384.\r\n\r\nBaptist Testimony, 263.\r\n\r\nBarley, 36.\r\n\r\nBarnes, Rev.
