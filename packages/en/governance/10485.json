Questions of general and permanent importance\r\nare seldom finally settled. A very wise man has said that \"short of the\r\nmultiplication table there is no truth and no fact which must not be proved\r\nover again as if it had never been proved, from time to time.\" Conceptions\r\nof social rights and obligations and the institutions based upon them\r\ncontinue unquestioned for long periods as postulates in all discussions\r\nupon questions of government. Whatever conduct conforms to them is assumed\r\nto be right. Whatever is at variance with them is assumed to be wrong.\r\nThen a time comes when, with apparent suddenness, the ground of discussion\r\nshifts and the postulates are denied. They cease to be accepted without\r\nproof and the whole controversy in which they were originally established\r\nis fought over again.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States appear now to have entered upon such a\r\nperiod of re-examination of their system of government. Not only are\r\npolitical parties denouncing old abuses and demanding new laws, but\r\nessential principles embodied in the Federal Constitution of 1787, and long\r\nfollowed in the constitutions of all the states, are questioned and denied.\r\nThe wisdom of the founders of the Republic is disputed and the political\r\nideas which they repudiated are urged for approval.\r\n\r\nI wish in these lectures to present some observations which may have a\r\nuseful application in the course of this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two separate processes going on among the civilized nations at\r\nthe present time. One is an assault by socialism against the individualism\r\nwhich underlies the social system of western civilization. The other is\r\nan assault against existing institutions upon the ground that they do not\r\nadequately protect and develop the existing social order. It is of this\r\nlatter process in our own country that I wish to speak, and I assume an\r\nagreement, that the right of individual liberty and the inseparable right\r\nof private property which lie at the foundation of our modern civilization\r\nought to be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of life in America have changed very much since the\r\nConstitution of the United States was adopted. In 1787 each state entering\r\ninto the Federal Union had preserved the separate organic life of the\r\noriginal colony. Each had its center of social and business and political\r\nlife. Each was separated from the others by the barriers of slow and\r\ndifficult communication. In a vast territory, without railroads or\r\nsteamships or telegraph or telephone, each community lived within itself.\r\n\r\nNow, there has been a general social and industrial rearrangement.\r\nProduction and commerce pay no attention to state lines. The life of the\r\ncountry is no longer grouped about state capitals, but about the great\r\ncenters of continental production and trade. The organic growth which must\r\nultimately determine the form of institutions has been away from the\r\nmere union of states towards the union of individuals in the relation of\r\nnational citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe same causes have greatly reduced the independence of personal and\r\nfamily life. In the eighteenth century life was simple. The producer and\r\nconsumer were near together and could find each other. Every one who had an\r\nequivalent to give in property or service could readily secure the support\r\nof himself and his family without asking anything from government except\r\nthe preservation of order. To-day almost all Americans are dependent upon\r\nthe action of a great number of other persons mostly unknown. About half\r\nof our people are crowded into the cities and large towns. Their food,\r\nclothes, fuel, light, water--all come from distant sources, of which\r\nthey are in the main ignorant, through a vast, complicated machinery of\r\nproduction and distribution with which they have little direct relation.\r\nIf anything occurs to interfere with the working of the machinery, the\r\nconsumer is individually helpless. To be certain that he and his family may\r\ncontinue to live he must seek the power of combination with others, and in\r\nthe end he inevitably calls upon that great combination of all citizens\r\nwhich we call government to do something more than merely keep the\r\npeace--to regulate the machinery of production and distribution and\r\nsafeguard it from interference so that it shall continue to work.\r\n\r\nA similar change has taken place in the conditions under which a great part\r\nof our people engage in the industries by which they get their living.\r\nUnder comparatively simple industrial conditions the relation between\r\nemployer and employee was mainly a relation of individual to individual,\r\nwith individual freedom of contract and freedom of opportunity essential to\r\nequality in the commerce of life. Now, in the great manufacturing, mining,\r\nand transportation industries of the country, instead of the free give\r\nand take of individual contract there is substituted a vast system of\r\ncollective bargaining between great masses of men organized and acting\r\nthrough their representatives, or the individual on the one side accepts\r\nwhat he can get from superior power on the other. In the movement of these\r\nmighty forces of organization the individual laborer, the individual\r\nstockholder, the individual consumer, is helpless.\r\n\r\nThere has been another change of conditions through the development of\r\npolitical organization. The theory of political activity which had its\r\norigin approximately in the administration of President Jackson, and which\r\nis characterized by Marcy's declaration that \"to the victors belong\r\nthe spoils,\" tended to make the possession of office the primary and\r\nall-absorbing purpose of political conflict. A complicated system of party\r\norganization and representation grew up under which a disciplined body of\r\nparty workers in each state supported each other, controlled the machinery\r\nof nomination, and thus controlled nominations. The members of state\r\nlegislatures and other officers, when elected, felt a more acute\r\nresponsibility to the organization which could control their renomination\r\nthan to the electors, and therefore became accustomed to shape their\r\nconduct according to the wishes of the nominating organization. Accordingly\r\nthe real power of government came to be vested to a high degree in these\r\nunofficial political organizations, and where there was a strong man at\r\nthe head of an organization his control came to be something very closely\r\napproaching dictatorship. Another feature of this system aggravated its\r\nevils. As population grew, political campaigns became more expensive.\r\nAt the same time, as wealth grew, corporations for production and\r\ntransportation increased in capital and extent of operations and became\r\nmore dependent upon the protection or toleration of government. They found\r\na ready means to secure this by contributing heavily to the campaign funds\r\nof political organizations, and therefore their influence played a large\r\npart in determining who should be nominated and elected to office. So\r\nthat in many states political organizations controlled the operations of\r\ngovernment, in accordance with the wishes of the managers of the great\r\ncorporations. Under these circumstances our governmental institutions were\r\nnot working as they were intended to work, and a desire to break up and\r\nget away from this extra constitutional method of controlling our\r\nconstitutional government has caused a great part of the new political\r\nmethods of the last few years. It is manifest that the laws which were\r\nentirely adequate under the conditions of a century ago to secure\r\nindividual and public welfare must be in many respects inadequate to\r\naccomplish the same results under all these new conditions; and our people\r\nare now engaged in the difficult but imperative duty of adapting their laws\r\nto the life of to-day. The changes in conditions have come very rapidly\r\nand a good deal of experiment will be necessary to find out just what\r\ngovernment can do and ought to do to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe process of devising and trying new laws to meet new conditions\r\nnaturally leads to the question whether we need not merely to make new laws\r\nbut also to modify the principles upon which our government is based and\r\nthe institutions of government designed for the application of those\r\nprinciples to the affairs of life. Upon this question it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that we proceed with considerate wisdom.\r\n\r\nBy institutions of government I mean the established rule or order of\r\naction through which the sovereign (in our case the sovereign people)\r\nattains the ends of government. The governmental institutions of Great\r\nBritain have been established by the growth through many centuries of a\r\ngreat body of accepted rules and customs which, taken together, are\r\ncalled the British Constitution. In this country we have set forth in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence the principles which we consider to lie at\r\nthe basis of civil society \"that all men are created equal; that they are\r\nendowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among\r\nthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these\r\nrights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers\r\nfrom the consent of the governed.\"\r\n\r\nIn our Federal and State Constitutions we have established the institutions\r\nthrough which these rights are to be secured. We have declared what\r\nofficers shall make the laws, what officers shall execute them, what\r\nofficers shall sit in judgment upon claims of right under them. We have\r\nprescribed how these officers shall be selected and the tenure by which\r\nthey shall hold their offices. We have limited them in the powers which\r\nthey are to exercise, and, where it has been deemed necessary, we have\r\nimposed specific duties upon them. The body of rules thus prescribed\r\nconstitute the governmental institutions of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen proposals are made to change these institutions there are certain\r\ngeneral considerations which should be observed.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is that free government is impossible except\r\nthrough prescribed and established governmental institutions, which work\r\nout the ends of government through many separate human agents, each doing\r\nhis part in obedience to law. Popular will cannot execute itself directly\r\nexcept through a mob. Popular will cannot get itself executed through an\r\nirresponsible executive, for that is simple autocracy. An executive\r\nlimited only by the direct expression of popular will cannot be held to\r\nresponsibility against his will, because, having possession of all the\r\npowers of government, he can prevent any true, free, and general expression\r\nadverse to himself, and unless he yields voluntarily he can be overturned\r\nonly by a revolution. The familiar Spanish-American dictatorships are\r\nillustrations of this. A dictator once established by what is or is alleged\r\nto be public choice never permits an expression of public will which will\r\ndisplace him, and he goes out only through a new revolution because he\r\nalone controls the machinery through which he could be displaced peaceably.\r\nA system with a plebiscite at one end and Louis Napoleon at the other could\r\nnot give France free government; and it was only after the humiliation of\r\ndefeat in a great war and the horrors of the Commune that the French people\r\nwere able to establish a government that would really execute their will\r\nthrough carefully devised institutions in which they gave their chief\r\nexecutive very little power indeed.\r\n\r\nWe should, therefore, reject every proposal which involves the idea that\r\nthe people can rule merely by voting, or merely by voting and having one\r\nman or group of men to execute their will.\r\n\r\nA second consideration is that in estimating the value of any system of\r\ngovernmental institutions due regard must be had to the true functions\r\nof government and to the limitations imposed by nature upon what it is\r\npossible for government to accomplish. We all know of course that we cannot\r\nabolish all the evils in this world by statute or by the enforcement of\r\nstatutes, nor can we prevent the inexorable law of nature which decrees\r\nthat suffering shall follow vice, and all the evil passions and folly of\r\nmankind. Law cannot give to depravity the rewards of virtue, to indolence\r\nthe rewards of industry, to indifference the rewards of ambition, or to\r\nignorance the rewards of learning. The utmost that government can do is\r\nmeasurably to protect men, not against the wrong they do themselves but\r\nagainst wrong done by others and to promote the long, slow process of\r\neducating mind and character to a better knowledge and nobler standards of\r\nlife and conduct. We know all this, but when we see how much misery there\r\nis in the world and instinctively cry out against it, and when we see some\r\nthings that government may do to mitigate it, we are apt to forget how\r\nlittle after all it is possible for any government to do, and to hold the\r\nparticular government of the time and place to a standard of responsibility\r\nwhich no government can possibly meet. The chief motive power which has\r\nmoved mankind along the course of development that we call the progress of\r\ncivilization has been the sum total of intelligent selfishness in a vast\r\nnumber of individuals, each working for his own support, his own gain, his\r\nown betterment. It is that which has cleared the forests and cultivated\r\nthe fields and built the ships and railroads, made the discoveries and\r\ninventions, covered the earth with commerce, softened by intercourse the\r\nenmities of nations and races, and made possible the wonders of literature\r\nand of art. Gradually, during the long process, selfishness has grown more\r\nintelligent, with a broader view of individual benefit from the common\r\ngood, and gradually the influences of nobler standards of altruism, of\r\njustice, and human sympathy have impressed themselves upon the conception\r\nof right conduct among civilized men. But the complete control of such\r\nmotives will be the millennium. Any attempt to enforce a millennial\r\nstandard now by law must necessarily fail, and any judgment which assumes\r\ngovernment's responsibility to enforce such a standard must be an unjust\r\njudgment. Indeed, no such standard can ever be forced. It must come, not by\r\nsuperior force, but from the changed nature of man, from his willingness to\r\nbe altogether just and merciful.\r\n\r\nA third consideration is that it is not merely useless but injurious for\r\ngovernment to attempt too much. It is manifest that to enable it to deal\r\nwith the new conditions I have described we must invest government with\r\nauthority to interfere with the individual conduct of the citizen to a\r\ndegree hitherto unknown in this country. When government undertakes to\r\ngive the individual citizen protection by regulating the conduct of others\r\ntowards him in the field where formerly he protected himself by his freedom\r\nof contract, it is limiting the liberty of the citizen whose conduct is\r\nregulated and taking a step in the direction of paternal government. While\r\nthe new conditions of industrial life make it plainly necessary that many\r\nsuch steps shall be taken, they should be taken only so far as they are\r\nnecessary and are effective. Interference with individual liberty by\r\ngovernment should be jealously watched and restrained, because the habit of\r\nundue interference destroys that independence of character without which in\r\nits citizens no free government can endure.\r\n\r\nWe should not forget that while institutions receive their form from\r\nnational character they have a powerful reflex influence upon that\r\ncharacter. Just so far as a nation allows its institutions to be moulded\r\nby its weaknesses of character rather than by its strength it creates an\r\ninfluence to increase weakness at the expense of strength.\r\n\r\nThe habit of undue interference by government in private affairs breeds the\r\nhabit of undue reliance upon government in private affairs at the expense\r\nof individual initiative, energy, enterprise, courage, independent manhood.\r\n\r\nThe strength of self-government and the motive power of progress must be\r\nfound in the characters of the individual citizens who make up a nation.\r\nWeaken individual character among a people by comfortable reliance\r\nupon paternal government and a nation soon becomes incapable of free\r\nself-government and fit only to be governed: the higher and nobler\r\nqualities of national life that make for ideals and effort and achievement\r\nbecome atrophied and the nation is decadent.\r\n\r\nA fourth consideration is that in the nature of things all government must\r\nbe imperfect because men are imperfect. Every system has its shortcomings\r\nand inconveniences; and these are seen and felt as they exist in the system\r\nunder which we live, while the shortcomings and inconveniences of other\r\nsystems are forgotten or ignored.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to see governmental methods reformed and after a time,\r\nlong enough to forget the evils that caused the change, to have a new\r\nmovement for a reform which consists in changing back to substantially the\r\nsame old methods that were cast out by the first reform.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of shortcomings or inconveniences in government is not by\r\nitself sufficient to warrant a change of system. There should be also an\r\neffort to estimate and compare the shortcomings and inconveniences of the\r\nsystem to be substituted, for although they may be different they will\r\ncertainly exist.\r\n\r\nA fifth consideration is that whatever changes in government are to be\r\nmade, we should follow the method which undertakes as one of its cardinal\r\npoints to hold fast that which is good. Francis Lieber, whose affection\r\nfor the country of his birth equalled his loyalty to the country of his\r\nadoption, once said:\r\n\r\n   \"There is this difference between the English, French, and Germans:\r\n   that the English only change what is necessary and as far as it is\r\n   necessary; the French plunge into all sorts of novelties by whole\r\n   masses, get into a chaos, see that they are fools and retrace their\r\n   steps as quickly, with a high degree of practical sense in all this\r\n   impracticability; the Germans attempt no change without first recurring\r\n   to first principles and metaphysics beyond them, systematizing the\r\n   smallest details in their minds; and when at last they mean to apply\r\n   all their meditation, opportunity, with its wide and swift wings\r\n   of a gull, is gone.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written more than sixty years ago before the present French\r\nRepublic and the present German Empire, and Lieber would doubtless have\r\nmodified his conclusions in view of those great achievements in government\r\nif he were writing to-day. But he does correctly indicate the differences\r\nof method and the dangers avoided by the practical course which he ascribes\r\nto the English, and in accordance with which the great structure of British\r\nand American liberty has been built up generation after generation and\r\ncentury after century. Through all the seven hundred years since Magna\r\nCharta we have been shaping, adjusting, adapting our system to the new\r\nconditions of life as they have arisen, but we have always held on to\r\neverything essentially good that we have ever had in the system. We have\r\nnever undertaken to begin over again and build up a new system under the\r\nidea that we could do it better. We have never let go of Magna Charta or\r\nthe Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.\r\nWhen we take account of all that governments have sought to do and have\r\nfailed to do in this selfish and sinful world, we find that as a rule the\r\napplication of new theories of government, though devised by the most\r\nbrilliant constructive genius, have availed but little to preserve the\r\npeople of any considerable regions of the earth for any long periods from\r\nthe evils of despotism on the one hand or of anarchy on the other, or\r\nto raise any considerable portion of the mass of mankind above the hard\r\nconditions of oppression and misery. And we find that our system of\r\ngovernment which has been built up in this practical way through so many\r\ncenturies, and the whole history of which is potent in the provisions of\r\nour Constitution, has done more to preserve liberty, justice, security, and\r\nfreedom of opportunity for many people for a long period and over a great\r\nportion of the earth, than any other system of government ever devised by\r\nman. Human nature does not change very much. The forces of evil are hard\r\nto control now as they always have been. It is easy to fail and hard\r\nto succeed in reconciling liberty and order. In dealing with this most\r\nsuccessful body of governmental institutions the question should not be\r\nwhat sort of government do you or I think we should have. What you and I\r\nthink on such a subject is of very little value indeed. The question should\r\nbe:\r\n\r\nHow can we adapt our laws and the workings of our government to the new\r\nconditions which confront us without sacrificing any essential element of\r\nthis system of government which has so nobly stood the test of time and\r\nwithout abandoning the political principles which have inspired the growth\r\nof its institutions? For there are political principles, and nothing can\r\nbe more fatal to self-government than to lose sight of them under the\r\ninfluence of apparent expediency.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to answer this question we need not trouble ourselves very\r\nmuch about the multitude of excited controversies which have arisen over\r\nnew methods of extra constitutional-political organization and procedure.\r\nDirect nominations, party enrollments, instructions to delegates,\r\npresidential preference primaries, independent nominations, all relate\r\nto forms of voluntary action outside the proper field of governmental\r\ninstitutions. All these new political methods are the result of efforts of\r\nthe rank and file of voluntary parties to avoid being controlled by the\r\nagents of their own party organization, and to get away from real evils\r\nin the form of undue control by organized minorities with the support of\r\norganized capital. None of these expedients is an end in itself. They are\r\ntentative, experimental. They are movements not towards something definite\r\nbut away from something definite. They may be inconvenient or distasteful\r\nto some of us, but no one need be seriously disturbed by the idea that\r\nthey threaten our system of government. If they work well they will be\r\nan advantage. If they work badly they will be abandoned and some other\r\nexpedient will be tried, and the ultimate outcome will doubtless be an\r\nimprovement upon the old methods.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of new methods which do relate to the structure of\r\ngovernment and which call for more serious consideration here. Chief in\r\nthis class are:\r\n\r\nThe Initiative; that is to say, direct legislation by vote of the people\r\nupon laws proposed by a specified number or proportion of the electors.\r\n\r\nThe Compulsory Referendum; that is to say, a requirement that under certain\r\nconditions laws that have been agreed upon by a legislative body shall\r\nbe referred to a popular vote and become operative only upon receiving a\r\nmajority vote.\r\n\r\nThe Recall of Officers before the expiration of the terms for which they\r\nhave been elected by a vote of the electors to be had upon the demand of a\r\nspecified number or proportion of them.\r\n\r\nThe Popular Review of Judicial Decisions upon constitutional questions;\r\nthat is to say, a provision, under which, when a court of last resort\r\nhas decided that a particular law is invalid, because in conflict with\r\na constitutional provision, the law may nevertheless be made valid by a\r\npopular vote.\r\n\r\nSome of these methods have been made a part of the constitutional system of\r\na considerable number of our states. They have been accompanied invariably\r\nby provisions for very short and easy changes of state constitutions, and,\r\nso long as they are confined to the particular states which have chosen to\r\nadopt them, they may be regarded as experiments which we may watch with\r\ninterest, whatever may be our opinions as to the outcome, and with the\r\nexpectation that if they do not work well they also will be abandoned. This\r\nis especially true because, since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution, the states are prohibited from violating in their own\r\naffairs the most important principles of the National Constitution. It\r\nis not to be expected, however, that new methods and rules of action in\r\ngovernment shall become universal in the states and not ultimately bring\r\nabout a change in the national system. It will be useful, therefore, to\r\nconsider whether these new methods if carried into the national system\r\nwould sacrifice any of the essentials of that system which ought to be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States deals in the main with essentials.\r\nThere are some non-essential directions such as those relating to the\r\nmethods of election and of legislation, but in the main it sets forth the\r\nfoundations of government in clear, simple, concise terms. It is for this\r\nreason that it has stood the test of more than a century with but slight\r\namendment, while the modern state constitutions, into which a multitude of\r\nordinary statutory provisions are crowded, have to be changed from year to\r\nyear. The peculiar and essential qualities of the government established by\r\nthe Constitution are:\r\n\r\nFirst, it is representative.\r\n\r\nSecond, it recognizes the liberty of the individual citizen as\r\ndistinguished from the total mass of citizens, and it protects that liberty\r\nby specific limitations upon the power of government.\r\n\r\nThird, it distributes the legislative, executive and judicial powers, which\r\nmake up the sum total of all government, into three separate departments,\r\nand specifically limits the powers of the officers in each department.\r\n\r\nFourth, it superimposes upon a federation of state governments, a national\r\ngovernment with sovereignty acting directly not merely upon the states, but\r\nupon the citizens of each state, within a line of limitation drawn\r\nbetween the powers of the national government and the powers of the state\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nFifth, it makes observance of its limitations requisite to the validity of\r\nlaws, whether passed by the nation or by the states, to be judged by the\r\ncourts of law in each concrete case as it arises.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these five characteristics of the government established by\r\nthe Constitution was a distinct advance beyond the ancient attempts at\r\npopular government, and the elimination of any one of them would be a\r\nretrograde movement and a reversion to a former and discarded type of\r\ngovernment. In each case it would be the abandonment of a distinctive\r\nfeature of government which has succeeded, in order to go back and try\r\nagain the methods of government which have failed. Of course we ought\r\nnot to take such a backward step except under the pressure of inevitable\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThe first two of the characteristics which I have enumerated, those which\r\nembrace the conception of representative government and the conception of\r\nindividual liberty, were the products of the long process of development of\r\nfreedom in England and America. They were not invented by the makers of the\r\nConstitution. They have been called inventions of the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\nThey are the chief contributions of that race to the political development\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nThe expedient of representation first found its beginning in the Saxon\r\nwitenagemot. It was lost in the Norman conquest. It was restored step by\r\nstep, through the centuries in which parliament established its power as an\r\ninstitution through the granting or withholding of aids and taxes for the\r\nking's use. It was brought to America by the English colonists. It was the\r\npractice of the colonies which formed the Federal Union. It entered into\r\nthe constitution as a matter of course, because it was the method by which\r\nmodern liberty had been steadily growing stronger and broader for six\r\ncenturies as opposed to the direct, unrepresentative method of government\r\nin which the Greek and Roman and Italian republics had failed. This\r\nrepresentative system has in its turn impressed itself upon the nations\r\nwhich derived their political ideas from Rome and has afforded the method\r\nthrough which popular liberty has been winning forward in its struggle\r\nagainst royal and aristocratic power and privilege the world over.\r\nBluntschli, the great Heidelberg publicist of the last century, says:\r\n\r\n   \"Representative government and self-government are the great works of\r\n   the English and American peoples. The English have produced\r\n   representative monarchy with parliamentary legislation and\r\n   parliamentary government. The Americans have produced the\r\n   representative republic. We Europeans upon the Continent recognize\r\n   in our turn that in representative government alone lies the hoped-for\r\n   union between civil order and popular liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Initiative and Compulsory Referendum are attempts to cure the evils\r\nwhich have developed in our practice of representative government by means\r\nof a return to the old, unsuccessful, and discarded method of direct\r\nlegislation and by rehabilitating one of the most impracticable of\r\nRousseau's theories. Every candid student of our governmental affairs must\r\nagree that the evils to be cured have been real and that the motive which\r\nhas prompted the proposal of the Initiative and Referendum is commendable.\r\nI do not think that these expedients will prove wise or successful ways of\r\ncuring these evils for reasons which I will presently indicate; but it is\r\nnot necessary to assume that their trial will be destructive of our system\r\nof government. They do not aim to destroy representative government, but to\r\nmodify and control it, and were it not that the effect of these particular\r\nmethods is likely to go beyond the intention of their advocates they would\r\nnot interfere seriously with representative government except in so far as\r\nthey might ultimately prove to be successful expedients. If they did\r\nnot work satisfactorily they would be abandoned, leaving representative\r\ngovernment still in full force and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThere is now a limited use of the Referendum upon certain comparatively\r\nsimple questions. No one has ever successfully controverted the view\r\nexpressed by Burke in his letter to the electors of Bristol, that his\r\nconstituents were entitled not merely to his vote but to his judgment, even\r\nthough they might not agree with it. But there are some questions upon\r\nwhich the determining fact must be the preference of the people of the\r\ncountry or of a community; such as the question where a capital city or a\r\ncounty seat shall be located; the question whether a debt shall be incurred\r\nthat will be a lien on their property for a specific purpose; the question\r\nwhether the sale of intoxicating liquors shall he permitted. Upon certain\r\ngreat simple questions which are susceptible of a _yes_ or _no_ answer it\r\nis appropriate that the people should be called upon to express their\r\nwish by a vote just as they express their choice of the persons who shall\r\nexercise the powers of government by a vote. This, however, is very\r\ndifferent from undertaking to have the ordinary powers of legislation\r\nexercised at the ballot box.\r\n\r\nIn this field the weakness, both of the Initiative and of the Compulsory\r\nReferendum, is that they are based upon a radical error as to what\r\nconstitutes the true difficulty of wise legislation. The difficulty is\r\nnot to determine what ought to be accomplished but to determine how to\r\naccomplish it. The affairs with which statutes have to deal as a rule\r\ninvolve the working of a great number and variety of motives incident to\r\nhuman nature, and the working of those motives depends upon complicated\r\nand often obscure facts of production, trade, social life, with which men\r\ngenerally are not familiar and which require study and investigation to\r\nunderstand. Thrusting a rigid prohibition or command into the operation of\r\nthese forces is apt to produce quite unexpected and unintended results.\r\nMoreover, we already have a great body of laws, both statutory and\r\ncustomary, and a great body of judicial decisions as to the meaning and\r\neffect of existing laws. The result of adding a new law to this existing\r\nbody of laws is that we get, not the simple consequence which the words,\r\ntaken by themselves, would seem to require, but a resultant of forces from\r\nthe new law taken in connection with all existing laws. A very large part\r\nof the litigation, injustice, dissatisfaction, and contempt for law which\r\nwe deplore, results from ignorant and inconsiderate legislation with\r\nperfectly good intentions. The only safeguard against such evils and the\r\nonly method by which intelligent legislation can be reached is the method\r\nof full discussion, comparison of views, modification and amendment of\r\nproposed legislation in the light of discussion and the contribution and\r\nconflict of many minds. This process can be had only through the procedure\r\nof representative legislative bodies. Representative government is\r\nsomething more than a device to enable the people to have their say when\r\nthey are too numerous to get together and say it. It is something more than\r\nthe employment of experts in legislation. Through legislative procedure\r\na different kind of treatment for legislative questions is secured by\r\nconcentration of responsibility, by discussion, and by opportunity to meet\r\nobjection with amendment. For this reason the attempt to legislate by\r\ncalling upon the people by popular vote to say yes or no to complicated\r\nstatutes must prove unsatisfactory and on the whole injurious. In ordinary\r\ncases the voters will not and cannot possibly bring to the consideration of\r\nproposed statutes the time, attention, and knowledge required to determine\r\nwhether such statutes will accomplish what they are intended to accomplish;\r\nand the vote usually will turn upon the avowed intention of such proposals\r\nrather than upon their adequacy to give effect to the intention.\r\n\r\nThis would be true if only one statute were to be considered at one\r\nelection; but such simplicity is not practicable. There always will be, and\r\nif the direct system is to amount to anything there must be, many proposals\r\nurged upon the voters at each opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe measures, submitted at one time in some of the Western States now fill\r\nconsiderable volumes.\r\n\r\nWith each proposal the voter's task becomes more complicated and difficult.\r\n\r\nYet our ballots are already too complicated. The great blanket sheets with\r\nscores of officers and hundreds of names to be marked are quite beyond the\r\nintelligent action in detail of nine men out of ten.\r\n\r\nThe most thoughtful reformers are already urging that the voter's task be\r\nmade more simple by giving him fewer things to consider and act upon at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nThis is the substance of what is called the \"Short Ballot\" reform; and\r\nit is right, for the more questions divide public attention the fewer\r\nquestions the voters really decide for themselves on their own judgment and\r\nthe greater the power of the professional politician.\r\n\r\nThere is moreover a serious danger to be apprehended from the attempt at\r\nlegislation by the Initiative and Compulsory Referendum, arising from its\r\nprobable effect on the character of representative bodies. These expedients\r\nresult from distrust of legislatures. They are based on the assertion that\r\nthe people are not faithfully represented in their legislative bodies, but\r\nare misrepresented. The same distrust has led to the encumbering of\r\nmodern state constitutions by a great variety of minute limitations upon\r\nlegislative power. Many of these constitutions, instead of being simple\r\nframeworks of government, are bulky and detailed statutes legislating upon\r\nsubjects which the people are unwilling to trust the legislature to deal\r\nwith. So between the new constitutions, which exclude the legislatures from\r\npower, and the Referendum, by which the people overrule what they do,\r\nand the Initiative, by which the people legislate in their place, the\r\nlegislative representatives who were formerly honored, are hampered, shorn\r\nof power, relieved of responsibility, discredited, and treated as unworthy\r\nof confidence. The unfortunate effect of such treatment upon the character\r\nof legislatures and the kind of men who will he willing to serve in them\r\ncan well be imagined. It is the influence of such treatment that threatens\r\nrepresentative institutions in our country. Granting that there have been\r\nevils in our legislative system which ought to be cured, I cannot think\r\nthat this is the right way to cure them. It would seem that the true way\r\nis for the people of the country to address themselves to the better\r\nperformance of their own duty in selecting their legislative\r\nrepresentatives and in holding those representatives to strict\r\nresponsibility for their action. The system of direct nominations, which\r\nis easy of application in the simple proceeding of selecting members of a\r\nlegislature, and the Short Ballot reform aim at accomplishing that result.\r\nI think that along these lines the true remedy is to be found. No system of\r\nself-government will continue successful unless the voters have sufficient\r\npublic spirit to perform their own duty at the polls, and the attempt to\r\nreform government by escaping from the duty of selecting honest and capable\r\nrepresentatives, under the idea that the same voters who fail to perform\r\nthat duty will faithfully perform the far more onerous and difficult duty\r\nof legislation, seems an exhibition of weakness rather than of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nESSENTIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first of these lectures I specified certain essential\r\ncharacteristics of our system of government, and discussed the preservation\r\nof the first--its representative character. The four other characteristics\r\nspecified have one feature in common. They all aim to preserve rights by\r\nlimiting power.\r\n\r\nOf these the most fundamental is the preservation in our Constitution of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon idea of individual liberty. The republics of Greece and\r\nRome had no such conception. All political ideas necessarily concern man as\r\na social animal, as a member of society--a member of the state. The ancient\r\nrepublics, however, put the state first and regarded the individual only as\r\na member of the state. They had in view the public rights of the state in\r\nwhich all its members shared, and the rights of the members as parts of the\r\nwhole, but they did not think of individuals as having rights independent\r\nof the state, or against the state. They never escaped from the attitude\r\ntowards public and individual civil rights, which was dictated by the\r\noriginal and ever-present necessity of military organization and defense.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon idea, on the other hand, looked first to the individual.\r\nIn the early days of English history, without theorizing much upon the\r\nsubject, the Anglo-Saxons began to work out their political institutions\r\nalong the line expressed in our Declaration of Independence, that the\r\nindividual citizen has certain inalienable rights--the right to life, to\r\nliberty, to the pursuit of happiness, and that government is not the source\r\nof these rights, but is the instrument for the preservation and promotion\r\nof them. So when a century and a half after the conquest the barons of\r\nEngland set themselves to limit the power of the Crown they did not demand\r\na grant of rights. They asserted the rights of individual freedom and\r\ndemanded observance of them, and they laid the corner-stone of our system\r\nof government in this solemn pledge of the Great Charter:\r\n\r\n   \"No freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or be disseized of his free\r\n   hold, or his liberties, or his free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled,\r\n   or otherwise destroyed, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by\r\n   the law of the land.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again in the repeated confirmations of the Great Charter, in the\r\nPetition of Rights, in the Habeas Corpus Act, in the Bill of Rights, in\r\nthe Massachusetts Body of Liberties, in the Virginia Bill of Rights, and,\r\nfinally, in the immortal Declaration of 1776--in all the great utterances\r\nof striving for broader freedom which have marked the development of modern\r\nliberty, sounds the same dominant note of insistence upon the inalienable\r\nright of individual manhood under government but independent of government,\r\nand, if need be, against government, to life and liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to overestimate the importance of the consequences which\r\nfollowed from these two distinct and opposed theories of government. The\r\none gave us the dominion, but also the decline and fall of, Rome. It\r\nfollowed the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, with the negation of\r\nthose rights in the oppression of the Reign of Terror, the despotism of\r\nNapoleon, the popular submission to the second empire and the subservience\r\nof the individual citizen to official superiority which still prevails so\r\nwidely on the continent of Europe. The tremendous potency of the other\r\nsubdued the victorious Normans to the conquered Saxon's conception of\r\njustice, rejected the claims of divine right by the Stewarts, established\r\ncapacity for self-government upon the independence of individual character\r\nthat knows no superior but the law, and supplied the amazing formative\r\npower which has molded, according to the course and practice of the common\r\nlaw, the thought and custom of the hundred millions of men drawn from all\r\nlands and all races who inhabit this continent north of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe mere declaration of a principle, however, is of little avail unless it\r\nbe supported by practical and specific rules of conduct through which\r\nthe principle shall receive effect. So Magna Charta imposed specific\r\nlimitations upon royal authority to the end that individual liberty might\r\nbe preserved, and so to the same end our Declaration of Independence\r\nwas followed by those great rules of right conduct which we call the\r\nlimitations of the constitution. Magna Charta imposed its limitations upon\r\nthe kings of England and all their officers and agents. Our constitution\r\nimposed its limitations upon the sovereign people and all their officers\r\nand agents, excluding all the agencies of popular government from authority\r\nto do the particular things which would destroy or impair the declared\r\ninalienable right of the individual.\r\n\r\nThus the constitution provides: No law shall be made by Congress\r\nprohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of\r\nspeech or of the press. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall\r\nnot be infringed. The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\r\nhouses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\r\nshall not be violated. No person shall be subject for the same offense to\r\nbe twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor be compelled, in any criminal\r\ncase, to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or\r\nproperty without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken\r\nfor public use without just compensation. In all criminal prosecutions, the\r\naccused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial\r\njury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed;\r\nand to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be\r\nconfronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for\r\nobtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel\r\nfor his defense. Excessive bail shall not he required, nor excessive fines\r\nimposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted. The privilege of the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, except in case of rebellion\r\nor invasion. No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed. And\r\nby the Fourteenth Amendment, no state shall deprive any person of life,\r\nliberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person\r\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.\r\n\r\nWe have lived so long under the protection of these rules that most of us\r\nhave forgotten their importance. They have been unquestioned in America so\r\nlong that most of us have forgotten the reasons for them. But if we lose\r\nthem we shall learn the reasons by hard experience. And we are in some\r\ndanger of losing them, not all at once but gradually, by indifference.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Sohm says: \"The greatest and most far reaching revolutions in\r\nhistory are not consciously observed at the time of their occurrence.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one of these provisions has a history. Every one stops a way\r\nthrough which the overwhelming power of government has oppressed the\r\nweak individual citizen, and may do so again if the way be opened. Such\r\nprovisions as these are not mere commands. They withhold power. The instant\r\nany officer, of whatever kind or grade, transgresses them he ceases to act\r\nas an officer. The power of sovereignty no longer supports him. The majesty\r\nof the law no longer gives him authority. The shield of the law no longer\r\nprotects him. He becomes a trespasser, a despoiler, a law breaker, and\r\nall the machinery of the law may be set in motion for his restraint or\r\npunishment. It is true that the people who have made these rules may repeal\r\nthem. As restraints upon the people themselves they are but self-denying\r\nordinances which the people may revoke, but the supreme test of\r\ncapacity for popular self-government is the possession of that power of\r\nself-restraint through which a people can subject its own conduct to the\r\ncontrol of declared principles of action.\r\n\r\nThese rules of constitutional limitation differ from ordinary statutes in\r\nthis, that these rules are made impersonally, abstractly, dispassionately,\r\nimpartially, as the people's expression of what they believe to be right\r\nand necessary for the preservation of their idea of liberty and justice.\r\nThe process of amendment is so guarded by the constitution itself as\r\nto require the lapse of time and opportunity for deliberation and\r\nconsideration and the passing away of disturbing influences which may be\r\ncaused by special exigencies or excitements, before any change can be\r\nmade. On the contrary, ordinary acts of legislation are subject to the\r\nconsiderations of expediency for the attainment of the particular objects\r\nof the moment, to selfish interests, momentary impulses, passions,\r\nprejudices, temptations. If there be no general rules which control\r\nparticular action, general principles are obscured or set aside by the\r\ndesires and impulses of the occasion. Our knowledge of the weakness of\r\nhuman nature and countless illustrations from the history of legislation\r\nin our own country point equally to the conclusion that if governmental\r\nauthority is to be controlled by rules of action, it cannot be relied upon\r\nto impose those rules upon itself at the time of action, but must have them\r\nprescribed beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe second class of limitations upon official power provided in our\r\nconstitution prescribe and maintain the distribution of power to the\r\ndifferent departments of government and the limitations upon the officers\r\ninvested with authority in each department. This distribution follows the\r\nnatural and logical lines of the distinction between the different kinds of\r\npower--legislative, executive, and judicial. But the precise allotment of\r\npower and lines of distinction are not so important as it is that there\r\nshall be distribution, and that each officer shall be limited in accordance\r\nwith that distribution, for without such limitations there can be no\r\nsecurity for liberty. If, whatever great officer of state happens to be the\r\nmost forceful, skillful, and ambitious, is permitted to overrun and absorb\r\nto himself the powers of all other officers and to control their action,\r\nthere ensues that concentration of power which destroys the working of free\r\ninstitutions, enables the holder to continue himself in power, and leaves\r\nno opportunity to the people for a change except through a revolution.\r\nNumerous instances of this very process are furnished by the history of\r\nsome of the Spanish-American republics. It is of little consequence that\r\nthe officer who usurps the power of others may design only to advance the\r\npublic interest and to govern well. The system which permits an honest\r\nand well-meaning man to do this will afford equal opportunity for selfish\r\nambition to usurp power in its own interest. Unlimited official power\r\nconcentrated in one person is despotism, and it is only by carefully\r\nobserved and jealously maintained limitations upon the power of every\r\npublic officer that the workings of free institutions can be continued.\r\n\r\nThe rigid limitation of official power is necessary not only to prevent the\r\ndeprivation of substantial rights by acts of oppression, but to maintain\r\nthat equality of political condition which is so important for the\r\nindependence of individual character among the people of the country. When\r\nan officer has authority over us only to enforce certain specific laws at\r\nparticular times and places, and has no authority regarding anything else,\r\nwe pay deference to the law which he represents, but the personal relation\r\nis one of equality. Give to that officer, however, unlimited power, or\r\npower which we do not know to be limited, and the relation at once becomes\r\nthat of an inferior to a superior. The inevitable result of such a relation\r\nlong continued is to deprive the people of the country of the individual\r\nhabit of independence. This may be observed in many of the countries of\r\nContinental Europe, where official persons are treated with the kind of\r\ndeference, and exercise the kind of authority, which are appropriate only\r\nto the relations between superior and inferior.\r\n\r\nSo the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, after limiting the powers of\r\neach department to its own field, declares that this is done \"to the end it\r\nmay be a government of laws and not of men.\"\r\n\r\nThe third class of limitations I have mentioned are those made necessary by\r\nthe novel system which I have described as superimposing upon a federation\r\nof state governments, a national government acting directly upon the\r\nindividual citizens of the states. This expedient was wholly unknown before\r\nthe adoption of our constitution. All the confederations which had been\r\nattempted before that time were simply leagues of states, and whatever\r\ncentral authority there was derived its authority from and had its\r\nrelations with the states as separate bodies politic. This was so of the\r\nold confederation. Each citizen owed his allegiance to his own state\r\nand each state had its obligations to the confederation. Under our\r\nconstitutional system in every part of the territory of every state\r\nthere are two sovereigns, and every citizen owes allegiance to both\r\nsovereigns--to his state and to his nation. In regard to some matters,\r\nwhich may generally be described as local, the state is supreme. In regard\r\nto other matters, which may generally be described as national, the nation\r\nis supreme. It is plain that to maintain the line between these two\r\nsovereignties operating in the same territory and upon the same citizens is\r\na matter of no little difficulty and delicacy. Nothing has involved more\r\nconstant discussion in our political history than questions of conflict\r\nbetween these two powers, and we fought the great Civil War to determine\r\nthe question whether in case of conflict the allegiance to the state or the\r\nallegiance to the nation was of superior obligation. We should observe that\r\nthe Civil War arose because the constitution did not draw a clear line\r\nbetween the national and state powers regarding slavery. It is of very\r\ngreat importance that both of these authorities, state and national, shall\r\nbe preserved together and that the limitations which keep each within its\r\nproper province shall be maintained. If the power of the states were to\r\noverride the power of the nation we should ultimately cease to have a\r\nnation and become only a body of really separate, although confederated,\r\nstate sovereignties continually forced apart by diverse interests and\r\nultimately quarreling with each other and separating altogether. On the\r\nother hand, if the power of the nation were to override that of the states\r\nand usurp their functions we should have this vast country, with its great\r\npopulation, inhabiting widely separated regions, differing in climate, in\r\nproduction, in industrial and social interests and ideas, governed in all\r\nits local affairs by one all-powerful, central government at Washington,\r\nimposing upon the home life and behavior of each community the opinions\r\nand ideas of propriety of distant majorities. Not only would this be\r\nintolerable and alien to the idea of free self-government, but it would be\r\nbeyond the power of a central government to do directly. Decentralization\r\nwould be made necessary by the mass of government business to be\r\ntransacted, and so our separate localities would come to be governed by\r\ndelegated authority--by proconsuls authorized from Washington to execute\r\nthe will of the great majority of the whole people. No one can doubt that\r\nthis also would lead by its different route to the separation of our Union.\r\nPreservation of our dual system of government, carefully restrained in each\r\nof its parts by the limitations of the constitution, has made possible our\r\ngrowth in local self-government and national power in the past, and, so far\r\nas we can see, it is essential to the continuance of that government in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAll of these three classes of constitutional limitations are therefore\r\nnecessary to the perpetuity of our government. I do not wish to be\r\nunderstood as saying that every single limitation is essential. There are\r\nsome limitations that might be changed and something different substituted.\r\nBut the system of limitation must be continued if our governmental system\r\nis to continue--if we are not to lose the fundamental principles of\r\ngovernment upon which our Union is maintained and upon which our race has\r\nwon the liberty secured by law for which it has stood foremost in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLincoln covered this subject in one of his comprehensive statements that\r\ncannot be quoted too often. He said in the first inaugural:\r\n\r\n   \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations\r\n   and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinion\r\n   and sentiments the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever\r\n   rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or despotism.\"\r\n\r\nRules of limitation, however, are useless unless they are enforced. The\r\nreason for restraining rules arises from a tendency to do the things\r\nprohibited. Otherwise no rule would be needed. Against all practical rules\r\nof limitation--all rules limiting official conduct, there is a constant\r\npressure from one side or the other. Honest differences of opinion as\r\nto the extent of power, arising from different points of view make this\r\ninevitable, to say nothing of those weaknesses and faults of human nature\r\nwhich lead men to press the exercise of power to the utmost under the\r\ninfluence of ambition, of impatience with opposition to their designs, of\r\nselfish interest and the arrogance of office. No mere paper rules will\r\nrestrain these powerful and common forces of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe agency by which, under our system of government, observance of\r\nconstitutional limitation is enforced is the judicial power. The\r\nconstitution provides that \"This constitution, and the laws of the United\r\nStates which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or\r\nwhich shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be\r\nthe supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound\r\nthereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\" Under this provision an enactment by Congress not made in\r\npursuance of the constitution, or an enactment of a state contrary to the\r\nconstitution, is not a law. Such an enactment should strictly have no more\r\nlegal effect than the resolution of any private debating society. The\r\nconstitution also provides that the judicial power of the United States\r\nshall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution\r\nand laws of the United States. Whenever, therefore, in a case before a\r\nFederal court rights are asserted under or against some law which is\r\nclaimed to violate some limitation of the constitution, the court is\r\nobliged to say whether the law does violate the constitution or not,\r\nbecause if it does not violate the constitution the court must give effect\r\nto it as law, while if it does violate the constitution it is no law at all\r\nand the court is not at liberty to give effect to it. The courts do not\r\nrender decisions like imperial rescripts declaring laws valid or invalid.\r\nThey merely render judgment on the rights of the litigants in particular\r\ncases, and in arriving at their judgment they refuse to give effect to\r\nstatutes which they find clearly not to be made in pursuance of the\r\nconstitution and therefore to be no laws at all. Their judgments are\r\ntechnically binding only in the particular case decided, but the knowledge\r\nthat the court of last resort has reached such a conclusion concerning a\r\nstatute, and that a similar conclusion would undoubtedly be reached in\r\nevery case of an attempt to found rights upon the same statute, leads to a\r\ngeneral acceptance of the invalidity of the statute.\r\n\r\nThere is only one alternative to having the courts decide upon the validity\r\nof legislative acts, and that is by requiring the courts to treat the\r\nopinion of the legislature upon the validity of its statutes, evidenced\r\nby their passage, as conclusive. But the effect of this would be that the\r\nlegislature would not be limited at all except by its own will. All the\r\nprovisions designed to maintain a government carried on by officers of\r\nlimited powers, all the distinctions between what is permitted to the\r\nnational government and what is permitted to the state governments, all\r\nthe safeguards of the life, liberty and property of the citizen against\r\narbitrary power, would cease to bind Congress, and on the same theory they\r\nwould cease also to bind the legislatures of the states. Instead of the\r\nconstitution being superior to the laws the laws would be superior to\r\nthe constitution, and the essential principles of our government would\r\ndisappear. More than one hundred years ago, Chief Justice Marshall, in the\r\ngreat case of Marbury _vs_. Madison, set forth the view upon which our\r\ngovernment has ever since proceeded. He said:\r\n\r\n   \"The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those\r\n   limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written.\r\n   To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limit\r\n   committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by\r\n   those intended to be restrained? The distinction between a government\r\n   with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not\r\n   confine the persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts prohibited\r\n   and acts allowed are of equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain\r\n   to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act\r\n   repugnant to it; or that the legislature may alter the constitution\r\n   by an ordinary act.\r\n\r\n   \"Between these alternatives, there is no middle ground. The constitution\r\n   is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or\r\n   it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts,\r\n   is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it. If the\r\n   former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act, contrary\r\n   to the constitution, is not law: if the latter part be true, then\r\n   written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to\r\n   limit a power, in its own nature, inimitable.\r\n\r\n   \"Certainly, all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate\r\n   them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and\r\n   consequently, the theory of every such government must be, that an act\r\n   of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void. This theory\r\n   is essentially attached to a written constitution, and is, consequently,\r\n   to be considered by this court as one of the fundamental principles of\r\n   our society.\"\r\n\r\nAnd of the same opinion was Montesquieu who gave the high authority of the\r\n_Esprit des Lois_ to the declaration that\r\n\r\n   \"There is no liberty if the power of judging be not separate from the\r\n   legislative and executive powers; were it joined with the legislative\r\n   the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary\r\n   control.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the wit of man has not yet devised any better\r\nway of reaching a just conclusion as to whether a statute does or does not\r\nconflict with a constitutional limitation upon legislative power than the\r\nsubmission of the question to an independent and impartial court. The\r\ncourts are not parties to the transactions upon which they pass. They are\r\nwithdrawn by the conditions of their office from participation in business\r\nand political affairs out of which litigations arise. Their action is\r\nfree from the chief dangers which threaten the undue extension of power,\r\nbecause, as Hamilton points out in The Federalist, they are the weakest\r\nbranch of government: they neither hold the purse, as does the legislature,\r\nnor the sword, as does the executive. During all our history they have\r\ncommanded and deserved the respect and confidence of the people. General\r\nacceptance of their conclusions has been the chief agency in preventing\r\nhere the discord and strife which afflict so many lands, and in preserving\r\npeace and order and respect for law.\r\n\r\nIndeed in the effort to emasculate representative government to which I\r\nhave already referred, the people of the experimenting states have greatly\r\nincreased their reliance upon the courts. Every new constitution with\r\ndetailed orders to the legislature is a forcible assertion that the people\r\nwill not trust legislatures to determine the extent of their own powers,\r\nbut will trust the courts.\r\n\r\nTwo of the new proposals in government, which have been much discussed,\r\ndirectly relate to this system of constitutional limitations made effective\r\nthrough the judgment of the courts. One is the proposal for the Recall of\r\nJudges, and the other for the Popular Review of Decisions, sometimes spoken\r\nof as the Recall of Decisions.\r\n\r\nUnder the first of these proposals, if a specified proportion of the voters\r\nare dissatisfied with a judge's decision they are empowered to require that\r\nat the next election, or at a special election called for that purpose,\r\nthe question shall be presented to the electors whether the judge shall be\r\npermitted to continue in office or some other specified person shall be\r\nsubstituted in his place. This ordeal differs radically from the popular\r\njudgment which a judge is called upon to meet at the end of his term of\r\noffice, however short that may be, because when his term has expired he is\r\njudged upon his general course of conduct while he has been in office and\r\nstands or falls upon that as a whole. Under the Recall a judge may be\r\nbrought to the bar of public judgment immediately upon the rendering of a\r\nparticular decision which excites public interest and he will be subject to\r\npunishment if that decision is unpopular. Judges will naturally be afraid\r\nto render unpopular decisions. They will hear and decide cases with a\r\nstronger incentive to avoid condemnation themselves than to do justice to\r\nthe litigant or the accused. Instead of independent and courageous judges\r\nwe shall have timid and time-serving judges. That highest duty of the\r\njudicial power to extend the protection of the law to the weak, the\r\nfriendless, the unpopular, will in a great measure fail. Indirectly the\r\neffect will be to prevent the enforcement of the essential limitations upon\r\nofficial power because the judges will be afraid to declare that there is a\r\nviolation when the violation is to accomplish some popular object.\r\n\r\nThe Recall of Decisions aims directly at the same result. Under such an\r\narrangement, if the courts have found a particular law to be a violation of\r\none of the fundamental rules of limitation prescribed in the constitution,\r\nand the public feeling of the time is in favor of disregarding that\r\nlimitation in that case, an election is to be held, and if the people in\r\nthe election vote that the law shall stand, it is to stand, although it be\r\na violation of the constitution; that is to say, if at any time a majority\r\nof the voters of a state (and ultimately the same would be true of the\r\npeople of the United States) choose not to be bound in any particular case\r\nby the rule of right conduct which they have established for themselves,\r\nthey are not to be bound. This is sometimes spoken of as a Popular Reversal\r\nof the Decisions of Courts. That I take to be an incorrect view. The power\r\nwhich would be exercised by the people under such an arrangement would be,\r\nnot judicial, but legislative. The action would not be a decision that the\r\ncourt was wrong in finding a law unconstitutional, but it would be making\r\na law valid which was invalid before because unconstitutional. In such\r\nan election the majority of the voters would make a law where no law had\r\nexisted before; and they would make that law in violation of the rules of\r\nconduct by which the people themselves had solemnly declared they ought\r\nto be bound. The exercise of such a power, if it is to exist, cannot be\r\nlimited to the particular cases which you or I or any man now living may\r\nhave in mind. It must be general. If it can be exercised at all it can and\r\nwill be exercised by the majority whenever they wish to exercise it. If it\r\ncan be employed to make a Workmen's Compensation Act in such terms as to\r\nviolate the constitution, it can be employed to prohibit the worship of an\r\nunpopular religious sect, or to take away the property of an unpopular rich\r\nman without compensation, or to prohibit freedom of speech and of the press\r\nin opposition to prevailing opinion, or to deprive one accused of crime of\r\na fair trial when he has been condemned already by the newspapers. In every\r\ncase the question whether the majority shall be bound by those general\r\nprinciples of action which the people have prescribed for themselves will\r\nbe determined in that case by the will of the majority, and therefore in no\r\ncase will the majority be bound except by its own will at the time.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of such a power would strike at the very foundation of our\r\nsystem of government. It would be a reversion to the system of the ancient\r\nrepublics where the state was everything and the individual nothing\r\nexcept as a part of the state, and where liberty perished. It would be a\r\nrepudiation of the fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon liberty which we\r\ninherit and maintain, for it is the very soul of our political institutions\r\nthat they protect the individual against the majority. \"All men,\" says\r\nthe Declaration, \"are endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights.\r\nGovernments are instituted to secure these rights.\" The rights are not\r\nderived from any majority. They are not disposable by any majority. They\r\nare superior to all majorities. The weakest minority, the most despised\r\nsect, exist by their own right. The most friendless and lonely human being\r\non American soil holds his right to life and liberty and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness, and all that goes to make them up by title indefeasible against\r\nthe world, and it is the glory of American self-government that by the\r\nlimitations of the constitution we have protected that right against even\r\nourselves. That protection cannot be continued and that right cannot be\r\nmaintained, except by jealously preserving at all times and under all\r\ncircumstances the rule of principle which is eternal over the will of\r\nmajorities which shift and pass away.\r\n\r\nDemocratic absolutism is just as repulsive, and history has shown it to\r\nbe just as fatal, to the rights of individual manhood as is monarchical\r\nabsolutism.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to violate the rules of action which we have\r\nestablished for ourselves in the constitution in order to deal by law with\r\nthe new conditions of the time, for these rules of action are themselves\r\nsubject to popular control. If the rules are so stated that they are\r\nthought to prevent the doing of something which is not contrary to the\r\nprinciples of liberty but demanded by them, the true remedy is to be found\r\nin reconsidering what the rules ought to be and, if need be, in restating\r\nthem so that they will give more complete effect to the principles they are\r\ndesigned to enforce. If, as I believe, there ought to be in my own state,\r\nfor example, a Workman's Compensation Act to supersede the present\r\nunsatisfactory system of accident litigation, and if the constitution\r\nforbids such a law--which I very much doubt--the true remedy is not to cast\r\nto the winds all systematic self-restraint and to inaugurate a new system\r\nof doing whatever we please whenever we please, unrestrained by declared\r\nrules of conduct; but it is to follow the orderly and ordinary method of\r\namending the constitution so that the rule protecting the right to property\r\nshall not be so broadly stated as to prevent legislation which the\r\nprinciple underlying the rule demands.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the proposed practice of overriding the constitution\r\nby a vote and amending the constitution is vital. It is the difference\r\nbetween breaking a rule and making a rule; between acting without any rule\r\nin a particular case and determining what ought to be the rule of action\r\napplicable to all cases.\r\n\r\nOur legislatures frequently try to evade constitutional provisions, and\r\ndoubtless popular majorities seeking specific objects would vote the same\r\nway, but set the same people to consider what the fundamental law ought\r\nto be, and confront them with the question whether they will abandon in\r\ngeneral the principles and the practical rules of conduct according to\r\nprinciples, upon which our government rests, and they will instantly\r\nrefuse. While their minds are consciously and avowedly addressed to that\r\nsubject they will stand firm for the general rules that will protect them\r\nand their children against oppression and usurpation, and they will change\r\nthose rules only if need be to make them enforce more perfectly the\r\nprinciples which underlie them.\r\n\r\nCommunities, like individuals, will declare for what they believe to be\r\njust and right; but communities, like individuals, can be led away from\r\ntheir principles step by step under the temptations of specific desires and\r\nsupposed expediencies until the principles are a dead letter and allegiance\r\nto them is a mere sham.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the way in which popular governments lose their vitality and\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nThe Roman consuls derived their power from the people and were responsible\r\nto the people; but Rome went on pretending that the emperors and their\r\nservants were consuls long after the Praetorians were the only source of\r\npower and the only power exercised was that of irresponsible despotism.\r\n\r\nA number of countries have copied our constitution coupled with a provision\r\nthat the constitutional guarantees may be suspended in case of necessity.\r\nWe are all familiar with the result. The guarantees of liberty and justice\r\nand order have been forgotten: the government is dictatorship and the\r\npopular will is expressed only by revolution.\r\n\r\nNor, so far as our national system is concerned has there yet appeared any\r\nreason to suppose that suitable laws to meet the new conditions cannot be\r\nenacted without either overriding or amending the constitution. The liberty\r\nof contract and the right of private property which are protected by the\r\nlimitations of the constitution are held subject to the police power of\r\ngovernment to pass and enforce laws for the protection of the public\r\nhealth, public morals, and public safety. The scope and character of the\r\nregulations required to accomplish these objects vary as the conditions\r\nof life in the country vary. Many interferences with contract and with\r\nproperty which would have been unjustifiable a century ago are demanded by\r\nthe conditions which exist now and are permissible without violating any\r\nconstitutional limitation. What will promote these objects the legislative\r\npower decides with large discretion, and the courts have no authority to\r\nreview the exercise of that discretion. It is only when laws are passed\r\nunder color of the police power and having no real or substantial relation\r\nto the purposes for which the power exists, that the courts can refuse to\r\ngive them effect. By a multitude of judicial decisions in recent years our\r\ncourts have sustained the exercise of this vast and progressive power\r\nin dealing with the new conditions of life under a great variety of\r\ncircumstances. The principal difficulty in sustaining the exercise of the\r\npower has been caused ordinarily by the fact that carelessly or ignorantly\r\ndrawn statutes either have failed to exhibit the true relation between the\r\nregulation proposed and the object sought, or have gone farther than the\r\nattainment of the legitimate object justified. A very good illustration\r\nof this is to be found in the Federal Employer's Liability Act which\r\nwas carelessly drawn and passed by Congress in 1906 and was declared\r\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court, but which was carefully drawn and\r\npassed by Congress in 1908 and was declared constitutional by the same\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nInsistence upon hasty and violent methods rather than orderly and\r\ndeliberate methods is really a result of impatience with the slow methods\r\nof true progress in popular government. We should probably make little\r\nprogress were there not in every generation some men who, realizing evils,\r\nare eager for reform, impatient of delay, indignant at opposition, and\r\nintolerant of the long, slow processes by which the great body of the\r\npeople may consider new proposals in all their relations, weigh their\r\nadvantages and disadvantages, discuss their merits, and become educated\r\neither to their acceptance or rejection. Yet that is the method of progress\r\nin which no step, once taken, needs to be retraced; and it is the only way\r\nin which a democracy can avoid destroying its institutions by the impulsive\r\nsubstitution of novel and attractive but impracticable expedients.\r\n\r\nThe wisest of all the fathers of the Republic has spoken, not for his\r\nown day alone but for all generations to come after him, in the solemn\r\nadmonitions of the Farewell Address. It was to us that Washington spoke\r\nwhen he said:\r\n\r\n   \"The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make\r\n   and to alter their constitutions of government; but the Constitution\r\n   which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic\r\n   act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.... Towards\r\n   the preservation of your government, and the permanency of your present\r\n   happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily discountenance\r\n   irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you\r\n   resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however\r\n   specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect, in the\r\n   forms of the Constitution, alterations which will impair the energy of\r\n   the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In\r\n   all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and\r\n   habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments\r\n   as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard\r\n   by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a\r\n   country; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothesis\r\n   and opinion, exposes to perpetual changes, from the endless variety of\r\n   hypothesis and opinion.\"\r\n\r\nWhile, in the nature of things, each generation must assume the task of\r\nadapting the working of its government to new conditions of life as they\r\narise, it would be the folly of ignorant conceit for any generation to\r\nassume that it can lightly and easily improve upon the work of the founders\r\nin those matters which are, by their nature, of universal application to\r\nthe permanent relations of men in civil society.\r\n\r\nReligion, the philosophy of morals, the teaching of history, the experience\r\nof every human life, point to the same conclusion--that in the practical\r\nconduct of life the most difficult and the most necessary virtue is\r\nself-restraint. It is the first lesson of childhood; it is the quality for\r\nwhich great monarchs are most highly praised; the man who has it not is\r\nfeared and shunned; it is needed most where power is greatest; it is needed\r\nmore by men acting in a mass than by individuals, because men in the mass\r\nare more irresponsible and difficult of control than individuals. The\r\nmakers of our constitution, wise and earnest students of history and\r\nof life, discerned the great truth that self-restraint is the supreme\r\nnecessity and the supreme virtue of a democracy. The people of the United\r\nStates have exercised that virtue by the establishment of rules of right\r\naction in what we call the limitations of the constitution, and until\r\nthis day they have rigidly observed those rules. The general judgment of\r\nstudents of government is that the success and permanency of the American\r\nsystem of government are due to the establishment and observance of\r\nsuch general rules of conduct. Let us change and adapt our laws as the\r\nshifting-conditions of the times require, but let us never abandon or\r\nweaken this fundamental and essential characteristic of our ordered\r\nliberty.",
