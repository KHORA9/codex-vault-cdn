We have had\r\nthe best place and the largest type in the columns of that Journal for\r\n20 years, and I tell you, brothers, it don’t pay. While young _Fletch_\r\nhad stock in the _Times_, we had the best place, and the biggest type,\r\nbut you all know it didn’t pay. Nor do any of the public journals yield\r\na fair return for our enormous advertising investments.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Jack: What in the devil are you driving at? Upon my soul, you\r\npositively alarm me. Why, I declare, I never saw your eyes roll so, nor\r\nyour jaws close so fiercely, nor your fist fall so heavily on your knee.\r\nNow, for the Lord’s sake, do disclose, in common parlance, what you mean\r\nby your mysterious declamation. (Wesley takes out his pen knife, and\r\ncuts his nails, and Fletcher takes a fresh cud of tobacco, and crosses\r\nhis legs.)\r\n\r\n_Jack_—I have had an interview with James Gordon Bennett.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Fletch: Hand me that fan. Wes: Please open the window. Sam: Bring\r\nme a glass of ice water. Now, Jack, proceed.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Bennett spoke of other days, and inquired after our health.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Whose health?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Mine and yours.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—What the devil did he mean by that? My health is always good. I\r\nnever had the rheumatism or gout, like you, Jack. What did the old\r\nreprobate mean by inquiring about my health? I’ll thank him to mind his\r\nown business.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Jim: Listen: For thirty years, you have imposed on me the\r\nfinancial department of our vast establishment, until I have racked my\r\nbrain, and nearly worn myself into the grave, and I am pursued in my old\r\nage, by our creditors, as never before. True, we recently resumed\r\npayment, but we know that we did that for effect, and before we were\r\nfairly out of the woods. I tell you, brothers, we are in a very critical\r\ncondition. People want bread, instead of books and papers, in these days\r\nof famine and commercial desolation. Now, brothers, I am desperate, and\r\nI favor a resort to desperate measures, to save the credit of our House.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—I think I smell a skunk. To save our pecuniary credit, you would\r\nsacrifice our honor. Talk out, Jack, for I too am growing desperate,\r\nwhen the scuffle is between credit and honor, and I will die in defence\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Is not our _Weekly_ declining, and our _Monthly_ rapidly\r\ndecaying, and our general business nearly paralysed. Must we not pay our\r\nnotes? And how can we do that, unless we adopt the course of Bonner, who\r\nis devouring all the publishers of the civilised world. Now, Jim, it is\r\nvery pleasant for you to sit here two or three hours every day, and talk\r\nabout temperance, (and take a glass on the sly occasionally,) and praise\r\nMethodism, (and go to the Theatre, and some other very curious places of\r\namusement,) and hold political meetings in our counting room, which you\r\nfill daily with a gang of seedy political vagabonds, who once, (with the\r\naid of Divine Providence, and Methodists, and Daniel F. Tiemann, and\r\nPeter Cooper, and Judge Sidney Stewart, and the politicians of the\r\nSecond, Sixth, and Eleventh Wards,) set a ball in motion, that elected\r\nyou Mayor of New York, from which you did not make a cent, and did not\r\nadd a cipher to your private fortune,—I say, all this is mighty pleasant\r\nfor you, but not for me, as the entire financial department of our\r\nimmense establishment has ever been on my shoulders, and I am getting\r\nvery old, and I now am about to change our tactics, or we are forever\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Go on, Jack—go on. But stop a moment. Fletch: Just open the desk,\r\nand pass me the bottle of brandy. (Takes a stiff horn.) Now, Jack, go\r\non, for I am prepared for anything.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—I told Bennett that I thought of publishing his biography\r\nfavorably in our _Weekly_.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—And what did the old devil say to that?\r\n\r\n_Jack_—His eyes brightened and glistened with perfect delight, and he\r\nsaid it was a darm fine idea.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Wes: Do you hear all this?\r\n\r\n_Wes_—O yes: I was with brother John, at the interview with Bennett and\r\nHudson, at the _Herald_ Office.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—And Fletch: What have you to say?\r\n\r\n_Fletch_—I was there, too.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Here, Ike, run for your life to the Apothecary, and get me some\r\nCamphor and Asafetida. Sam: Bring me a lump of ice, and hold it on my\r\nhead. My blood rushes with great violence to my brain. Fletch: Just pass\r\nthe brandy bottle this way once more. O my God, my good brothers, I fear\r\nyou will be the death of your brother James. I never thought we would\r\ncome to this. John is nearly seventy years old, and I am on the winter\r\nside of sixty, and Wesley is sixty, and Fletcher is nearly sixty, and\r\nafter a long life of toil, and the preservation of our business honor,\r\nand with children and grandchildren soon to fill our places on the field\r\nof action, it is now proposed to prostrate ourselves at the feet of a\r\nman, who has led a life of infamy from his youth to the present hour,\r\nand who has pursued to the grave many a virtuous and timid female, and\r\nmany a noble merchant, who were so unfortunate as to get in his wicked\r\nclutches. O, brothers, I had rather starve, than succumb to Bennett, who\r\nhas abused us all our days. We can survive our present misfortunes,\r\nwithout disgracing our _Weekly_ with the panegyric of James Gordon\r\nBennett, which will injure our respectable family journal more than we\r\nshall realise from our advertisements and all the puffs we can squeeze\r\nfrom Bennett. There’s my private fortune. Take it, and I will gladly\r\nreturn to a one story dwelling, and to utter penury, before I will\r\nsacrifice my self-respect, and my honor, to such a monster as James\r\nGordon Bennett.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Myself, and Wesley, and Fletcher, have long considered this, and\r\nwe are unchangeable, as we deem it our only means of salvation. It is\r\nincontrovertibly true, that Bennett has the largest circulation of any\r\npaper in America, and if he will permit us to advertise, and puff us\r\nlike Bonner, why, I am willing to make any sacrifice.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—I perceive the old liar has been as quiet as a mouse about his\r\nprodigious circulation, since he had to swear in the Carr libel case,\r\nthat his circulation was only about 50,000. The old scamp, just prior to\r\nhis oath, declared that his circulation was nearly 100,000. Once a liar,\r\nalways a liar, is my motto, and I don’t believe the _Herald’s_\r\ncirculation is as large as that of the _Sun_, which is conducted by\r\nMoses S. Beach, who is an honest man, and a true Christian, and a\r\nmeritorious gentleman.\r\n\r\n_Jack_—Say what you will, Jim.—Wes, and Fletch, and myself are resolved\r\nto extend our hands to Bennett in terms of the warmest friendship.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Well, brothers, you are three to one, and as ours are democratic\r\ninstitutions—that is, as the country we have adopted, is democratic (for\r\nsome of us are of English birth, and the rest of us had a very narrow\r\nescape, although the world is ignorant of the fact)—I say, that as you\r\nare all against my judgment in this matter, and as I don’t like to leave\r\nyou in my old age, why, I shall very reluctantly, and in tears—as you\r\nsee—(he cries) consent to sell ourselves to James Gordon Bennett, whom I\r\nhave always regarded as the incarnation of a lie, and of the devil. And\r\nnow, brothers, I am prepared to go to the _Herald_ Office, and for your\r\nsake, affectionately press Bennett’s hand in hypocrisy, and publish his\r\nbiography, in our _Weekly_, daubed all over with whitewash, and without\r\nany severity of allusion to Helen Jewett, or Grinnell, or any of his\r\nblack mail victims, or the numerous males and females whose early graves\r\nhe dug. And now I’ll take another copious draught of brandy, and then\r\nI’m ready for our degradation, and for the first step in the eternal\r\ndownfall of the Harpers, who have preserved their business honor all\r\nover the world, until this evil and melancholy hour. Now, brothers, come\r\non, and I’m ready to face Bennett and the devil himself, and kiss their\r\ntoes, if it is your behest. (They all go to the _Herald_ Office, two\r\nabreast, with their numerous posterity, three abreast, in the rear,\r\nyoung _Fletch_ leading the younger tribes, with a _Weekly_ and _Monthly_\r\nin either hand, to show Mr. Bennett as a sample.)\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Randall’s Island.=\r\n\r\n\r\n_The evening sun gilds the trees and spires—The lily and rosy and\r\n  classic Mistress on her couch reclining._\r\n\r\n  ENTER GOVERNOR DANIEL F. TIEMANN.\r\n\r\n  _Amorous Dan_—Good evening, my pretty VIOLET.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—A warm salute to my kind protector.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—Has Governor Simeon Draper been here to-day?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Yes, and Governor Bell. Simeon forced a dozen kisses from my\r\n  lips and cheeks.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—O, the scamp! (Sits by her side, and sips luscious fragrance\r\n  from her cherry and rosy lips, while she archly reclines on the sofa\r\n  that he purchased for her)—Sim is a bold villain. Did he seek more\r\n  than a kiss?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—He again strove hard to ravish me.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—But you foiled him?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—I did.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—O, my love, let me reward thee with these grateful lips. (Kisses\r\n  her twenty times in rapid succession.)\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—O, dearest, I fear you will smother me with gratitude. Do not\r\n  strangle me with such emblems of affection.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—I love thee too fervently, my charming Violet.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—I’m sorry you have a family.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—And so am I, my fair one. But neither kin nor stranger shall\r\n  blight our sweet relations. Thou art all to me. Without thee, I am\r\n  most desolate.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—I fear Simeon Draper will mar our happy destiny.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—Why?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Because he loves me.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—His love is of a lustful nature, while mine is from the purest\r\n  rivulets of the heart.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—I know you adore my spirit, while he only loves my form.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—And dost thou avow so much? O, breathe those sweet tones again.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Shall I sing them, dearest?\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—O what bliss is this! Sing, O sing, my beauteous Violet, and\r\n  entrance my heart with thy celestial music.\r\n\r\n             _Violet sings_— For many a day,\r\n                             With doubtful ray,\r\n                             I gazed for thee,\r\n                             O’er lea and sea:\r\n                             And from my heart,\r\n                             Thou ne’er shalt part,\r\n                             So dear to me,\r\n                             Thy love will be.\r\n                             So on my bed,\r\n                             Repose thy head,\r\n                             And from my lip\r\n                             Choice honey sip.\r\n                      _Dan_— O my! and O thy!\r\n                             I will ever try\r\n                             To please thy fair eye,\r\n                             So happy am I.\r\n                   _Violet_— Come, O come with me,\r\n                             And most happy be.\r\n                      _Dan_— O, O, O!\r\n\r\n  (They retire for the night.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MORNING TWILIGHT.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—Dear Violet, if Sim comes to-day, and strives to coerce you,\r\n  scream to the peak of your lungs, and terrify and threaten to expose\r\n  him. I love you so devoutly, that I cannot live if he continues to\r\n  molest you. I have already expelled your _Friend_ from the Island. My\r\n  affection for my fair Violet has the intensity of Othello’s for\r\n  Desdemona, ere Iago maddened the honest Moor with fatal jealousy.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Simeon Draper threatens to have me suspended. He got me my\r\n  situation as Matron, and as he has been a Governor much longer than\r\n  you, and as himself and Richard B. Connolly have long controlled the\r\n  Island, had I not better be a little familiar with Simeon, so that I\r\n  will not arouse his wrath to such intensity as to peril my situation\r\n  as Matron? Please view these matters with discretion, my noble Daniel.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—I can’t consider them for a moment. Draper may be powerful, but\r\n  he has not the might and wealth of the Tiemanns and Coopers. So, don’t\r\n  be alarmed, dear Violet. Myself and Peter Cooper can protect you\r\n  against the world. When did Simeon threaten to suspend you?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Yesterday.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—Did he assign the cause?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Because he thinks I love you better than him.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—How did he learn my intimacy with you?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—When you came to see me last week, he was sitting on the sofa\r\n  with me, while you knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—Good gracious! And where did he go when I entered?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—He ran into the bed room, and got under the bed.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—Thunder and lightning! O, if I had only caught him. And why did\r\n  you not tell me, my constant Violet?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Because I feared you would kill him.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—You were right, and exercised great prudence, and probably saved\r\n  his life, as I might have slain him. (Paces the room in great\r\n  agitation.) Gods! I feel murderous! When do you again expect him?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—Never, as he emerged from under the bed in great anger, after\r\n  you left, and cursed me long and fearfully, for keeping him under the\r\n  bed so long, while you were permitted to enjoy the beauties of my\r\n  person.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—What did he threaten when he left?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—To have me suspended immediately.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—I dare him to make the attempt. I would spend my last dollar to\r\n  have you reinstated. And I will instantly depart for the city, and put\r\n  wires in motion that will paralize his wicked purpose.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—I fear you are too late, as he left in a desperate rage, and\r\n  has probably decapitated my Matron head already.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—I, too, am in a furious rage, and I am resolved to defeat his\r\n  unhallowed project. So, a sweet adieu, my lovely Violet, and when we\r\n  meet again, we’ll embrace and entwine our forms and hearts with\r\n  unwonted hilarity and fervor.\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—(Weeping). Good-by, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—And why do you weep, my fair and gentle lady? Have I offended\r\n  thee, sweet angel?\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—No, but you were going to leave me without your wonted kiss.\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—O, my pretty and tender Violet, do forgive my cruel mental\r\n  absence. For my distracted mind was riveted on Simeon’s plots to\r\n  destroy you. So, there, (kissing her), and there, and there, and—\r\n\r\n  _Violet_—That will suffice. I fear your enthusiastic and endless\r\n  kisses will again threaten me with strangulation. O, Daniel! Daniel!\r\n  thou art a dear and fervent lover, and I do hope you will return\r\n  to-morrow, and pass the night with thy devoted, and pensive, and\r\n  lonely Violet!\r\n\r\n  _Dan_—I will—I will:\r\n\r\n                       And now a very brief adieu,\r\n                       While I Sim Draper do pursue.\r\n\r\n  (He goes towards the shore, and she fastens her tearful eyes on his\r\n  prancing form, until it fades from her dismal view, and she retires to\r\n  her lonely apartment, and weeps like the wretched Niobe.)\r\n\r\n                            (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Stephen H.

Southworth. His cheeks were so rosy, and his form so\r\n  beautiful, and his face so graceful, that I paused and gazed until he\r\n  descended my farthest horizon. In later years, I formed his\r\n  acquaintance, and he became my friend, and in all my vicissitudes, he\r\n  has evinced the fidelity of an affectionate brother. When William Tell\r\n  was about to hurl an arrow at the temples of his child, he inquired,\r\n  in the presence of Gesler: “Have I a friend here?” when a brave youth\r\n  leaped forth, and exclaimed: “Yes, Tell, you have,” which thrilled the\r\n  populace with delight, and made Gesler tremble. On Wednesday last,\r\n  when in custody of the Sheriff, and in pursuit of bail, I looked in\r\n  the direction of Heaven, and I could see a friend there, in the spirit\r\n  of my lamented Father, but in the cheerless pavement, and in the cold\r\n  faces of the multitude, I could discern no friend, and my poor heart\r\n  was bereft of its wonted buoyancy. But when Mr. Joyce, the kind\r\n  hearted Sheriff, accompanied me to the editorial room of Sylvester S.\r\n  Southworth, of the _New York Mercury_, and I inquired: “Have I a\r\n  friend here?” he sprang and seized my hands, and exclaimed: “Yes,\r\n  Branch, you have,” and he became my bail, and my heart bounded from\r\n  the gloom of a dungeon, to the liberty of a mountain. For twenty\r\n  years, I have gratuitously written for the public journals of New\r\n  York. For seven years, I wrote the Reports of Alfred Carson, against\r\n  Municipal thieves, including Mayor Tiemann, who was then an Alderman.\r\n  For two years, I pursued George W. Matsell, Richard B. Connolly,\r\n  George H. Purser, and other perjured aliens. What I have suffered\r\n  through severe toil and illness and penury, in my pursuit of public\r\n  plunderers, and unnaturalized aliens, no inspired mind can ever truly\r\n  describe. For three months past, I have exposed such bogus\r\n  philanthropists and public thieves and rakes as Peter Cooper and Mayor\r\n  Tiemann and Simeon Draper. And I most solemnly swear, that I will\r\n  never cease my exposition of public robbers and villains of every\r\n  grade, until the arrow of death penetrates the core of my heart. The\r\n  Press and the People may conspire against me, and a Jury may soon\r\n  consign me to the solitude of a dungeon, but while I enjoy the\r\n  blessings of liberty, I will hurl shafts of political death at such\r\n  monsters as Cooper and Tiemann and Draper, who have bamboozled and\r\n  plundered the people for thirty successive years. So, come on, ye\r\n  incarnate demons, and (through power and gold and bribes, and packed\r\n  juries, and your official vassals and ruffians,) drag your victim to a\r\n  prison or the scaffold, but God has erected a wall between you and my\r\n  soul, that the sabres and bullets and verdicts of your hired assassins\r\n  can never penetrate.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n         =Pirates on the Captive and Pauper and Crazy Islands.=\r\n\r\n  Gov. Anderson recently officially declared, that Gov. Isaac J. Oliver\r\n  was a public robber. So that we have plunderers and Mistresses and\r\n  Rakes on Randall’s and the adjacent isles. I thought I felt the shock\r\n  of an earthquake last night. O God! thou art most forbearing, to spare\r\n  the Tiemanns and Olivers so long. And if one of Thy most awful\r\n  physical visitations should level the habitations of these two wicked\r\n  men, do, O do spare their spotless wives and precious little ones.\r\n  Read, citizens, read, and go home at sunset, and bar your doors, and\r\n  do not permit your wives and lovely daughters to leave your presence,\r\n  after the first pretty little star appears. And warn them to beware of\r\n  the Tiemanns and Olivers, when they cross their path, as poison and\r\n  death are in their gaze, and amorous and thievish motions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _From the New York Tribune of July 7._\r\n\r\n  “_An Episode—How Contracts are Awarded_— In the course of a\r\n  controversy about the iron work of the Island Hospital, some remarks\r\n  passed between Messrs. Oliver and Anderson more piquant than polite.\r\n  Gov. Anderson said he did not want to hold any intercourse with so\r\n  corrupt a man. Gov. Oliver would not take any notice of such language,\r\n  except to hurl it back with scorn in the teeth of the one that uttered\r\n  it. He dared any one to name a single fact that would show that he was\r\n  corrupt. Gov. Anderson said that he was guilty of a very corrupt act\r\n  when, in opening the bids for certain iron work, he endeavored to\r\n  induce his fellow members on the Committee to give the contract to a\r\n  man who was not the lowest bidder, more especially as they had since\r\n  discovered that two of that bidder’s tools—one of them his foreman,\r\n  and the other a Methodist parson in his interest—were among the\r\n  bidders.\r\n\r\n  Gov. Oliver said he did not know anything about these two men; the\r\n  reason he urged that the contract be awarded to his friend was because\r\n  he liked to serve his friends, as the other Governors did theirs,\r\n  (here several Governors protested against their names being called in\r\n  question,) and because the lowest bidder did not do business in the\r\n  city. Some other words passed between Messrs. Anderson and Oliver,\r\n  evidently very much to the annoyance of the other members of the\r\n  Board, who kept nervously remonstrating, and tried repeatedly, but in\r\n  vain, to get the Board to adjourn.\r\n\r\n  The discussion wound up by Gov. Oliver asserting that if any charges\r\n  could be brought against his integrity, he hoped they would be\r\n  referred to a Committee; either he or Gov. Anderson was evidently\r\n  unfit to sit in the Board.\r\n\r\n  Gov. Anderson said he was quite willing to refer the matter to a fair\r\n  Committee, and if he did not substantiate the charge of corruption\r\n  against Oliver, he would resign, provided that Oliver agreed, in case\r\n  the charge was proved, to leave the Board.\r\n\r\n  At this interesting juncture, an indignant demand for adjournment from\r\n  Gov. Maloney prevailed, and the troubled waters once more resumed\r\n  their wonted tranquillity.\r\n\r\n  Subsequently the members opened the bids for the iron work on the\r\n  Island Hospital. There were six bids, the highest being $26,875; the\r\n  lowest, by J. B. & W. W. Cornell, $18,364.”\r\n\r\n  Gov. Anderson assures me that Oliver is a very corrupt man, and that\r\n  he will soon give me the evidence of his corruption, which I will\r\n  publish as soon as I receive it. The firemen will grieve to learn that\r\n  Gov. Anderson, their faithful Ex-Chief Engineer, is indisposed, and\r\n  seeks the bracing air of Long Island for his restoration. Anderson and\r\n  Carson led the firemen long and bravely, and of the million\r\n  inhabitants around us, there are no two gallant spirits whom I more\r\n  profoundly revere than Cornelius V. Anderson and Alfred Carson. Both\r\n  are the soul of chivalry and honor. And may they ever prosper, and be\r\n  healthy and happy, and be warmly cherished by the firemen and by all\r\n  good citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n              _From the New York Express of Tuesday last._\r\n\r\n  “A NOVEL REGATTA.—Last Saturday afternoon, quite a novel exhibition of\r\n  aquatic skill came off at Blackwell’s Island, on the occasion of a\r\n  boat race, gotten up under the auspices of some of the Governors of\r\n  the Alms House. The boats are six oared barges used for conveying\r\n  passengers from the various institutions on the Island to New York.\r\n  The following were the entries which competed for sweepstakes:\r\n\r\n                Boat             manned by    ent. money\r\n                Alms House       vagrants             $5\r\n                Work House        paupers              5\r\n                Penitentiary      thieves              5\r\n                Lunatic Asylum   lunatics              5\r\n                                                    ––––\r\n                                Sweepstakes          $20\r\n\r\n  The race was around Blackwell’s Island, a distance of four miles,\r\n  starting from a stake-boat moored off the Penitentiary wharf. The race\r\n  was witnessed by the Governors and friends, and a large number of\r\n  spectators on New York side of the East River. The Work House boat\r\n  came in victor.\r\n\r\n  After the race, Governors B. F. Pinckney, P. G. Maloney, and Isaac J.\r\n  Oliver, with a large number of invited guests, sat down to a jolly\r\n  good dinner, furnished by order of the Governors, at the Lunatic\r\n  Asylum. The tables were supplied with every delicacy of the season,\r\n  with an abundant supply of brandies, wines, champagne, &c. It has been\r\n  hinted by some malicious persons, that the proceedings at table were\r\n  worthy of the place where the feast was held.”\r\n\r\n  These cruel and lazy Governors must have looked funny, sprawled on the\r\n  velvet banks, with public rum and segars in their bladders and jaws,\r\n  and obscenity and blasphemy in their filthy mouths, gazing at the\r\n  unfortunate creatures, (rowing for their lives beneath a burning sun,)\r\n  whom the public kindly placed under their supervision. What a gang of\r\n  drones, and thieves, and squanderers, and unblushing scamps! O that\r\n  Maloney and Pinckney and Oliver could be made to earn, by hard labor,\r\n  a tithe of the thousands they rifle from the honest and industrious\r\n  classes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The HARPERS are dead!

Also, what their associates\r\n  paid. Accredited rumor says that all the members of the Hunter Woodis\r\n  Society were drones and paupers before they began to collect indigent\r\n  funds for the Hunter Woodis Society, and before they cunningly devised\r\n  (in connection with Cooper, Tiemann, Gerard, and others) the Calico\r\n  Balls at the Academy of Music and Crystal Palace. They now have their\r\n  carriages, (gold and silver mounted,) and fast horses, and elegant\r\n  mansions, and have even had the silly boldness to open an Ice Cream\r\n  and Lager Bier Saloon, on a scale of dazzling splendor and\r\n  unprecedented area, that would fascinate the Frenchman, and bewilder\r\n  the German, and will astonish the American. So, just examine the tax\r\n  books, Leonard and Dowling, and give me the startling statistics, and\r\n  I will publish them. And I’ll bet largely in advance, that they were\r\n  paupers until they stole and appropriated the fascinating and noble\r\n  name of Woodis, to consummate their unhallowed schemes, to rob the\r\n  Poor of the Metropolis. “That’s all,” as Dr. Wallace too often says at\r\n  the close of his Junius editorials in the _Herald_:\r\n\r\n                  O Doctor, Doctor, Doctor!\r\n                  You are a funny Proctor!\r\n                  O De Forest and Tisdale,\r\n                  You’ll soon have worms, and grow pale.\r\n                  Leonard and Dowling: To your task,\r\n                  And in my rays, you yet may bask.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Credit—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\n  his breath!
