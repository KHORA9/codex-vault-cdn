NICOLL, in St. Paul’s Church-yard,\r\n  M DCC LXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS\r\n\r\nOn the Importance of the Study of\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL PAMPHLETS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a surer proof of ignorance and folly than impertinence,\r\nwhether it betrays itself in the pertness of a coxcomb, or in the\r\nsolemnity of a fop; provokes with the petulance of wit; stupifies with\r\nthe dullness of narration; insults with the arrogance of superior\r\nbirth, fortune, or learning; fatigues with frothy declamation, or stuns\r\nwith the clamour of dispute; in private and in public, over a dish of\r\ntea, or over a bottle; from the pulpit, or the bar, or in the senate,\r\nit is always offensive and ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe humble and obscure writer of a Pamphlet cannot, however, if he\r\nhappens to mistake his talents, be justly blamed for impertinence. He\r\nmay be pitied for his misfortune; but for his faults as an author, he\r\nis answerable to no man: for there is scarce any man, who has dealt in\r\nthis sort of reading, that has not had fair warning; it being more than\r\nan hundred to one, that he has bought an impertinent Pamphlet, some\r\ntime, or other, in the course of his studies. He cannot well fail of\r\nknowing that such things are sometimes published; neither the writer\r\nnor the bookseller compels him to buy; and if he suffers himself to be\r\nimposed on by a title-page, he can have no good reason to complain of\r\neither. Besides, no Pamphlet can fairly be said to be wholly useless:\r\nit may be always made to serve, at least, some purpose; whereas I\r\nbelieve there is hardly any body but may remember to have been present,\r\nperhaps once in their lives, at a conversation, or a pleading, or a\r\nspeech, or a sermon, that could serve no manner of purpose but to tire\r\nthe audience, and make the speaker ridiculous: and this must be allowed\r\nto be a very unpardonable sort of impertinence; for a man may throw\r\naside a Pamphlet, if he pleases, at the first page, or the first line;\r\nbut he cannot decently get out of a company, or out of the senate, or\r\nout of a church, whenever he may have a mind.\r\n\r\nI do not mean this, as an apology for authors in general: the\r\naccidental writer of a Pamphlet, or a Paper, hardly deserves so\r\nrespectable an appellation. On the contrary, every man who wantonly\r\nand vainly usurps that sacred profession, without being possessed of\r\na moderate share at least, either of genius, or wit, or learning, or\r\nknowledge, besides the indispensable qualifications and ingredients of\r\ncommon honesty, sincerity, and benevolence, is guilty, in my opinion,\r\nof the highest degree of impertinence.\r\n\r\nBut in this land of liberty, of general wealth, curiosity, and\r\nidleness, where there is scarce a human creature so poor that it cannot\r\nafford to buy or hire a Paper or a Pamphlet, or so busy that it cannot\r\nfind leisure to read it; where every man, woman, and child, is, by\r\ninstinct, birth, and inheritance, a politician; where the ordinary\r\nsubjects of common conversation turn not, as in most countries, upon\r\nthe impertinent trivial occurrences of the week or the day, nor on the\r\nsmall concerns, offices, and duties of private and social life; but\r\non the greater and the more important objects of war, negociations,\r\npeace, laws, and the public and general weal; where men are more\r\nsolicitous about the integrity and abilities of a lord commissioner\r\nof the treasury, or of a secretary of state, than the fidelity of\r\ntheir own wives, the chastity of their daughters, their sons, or their\r\nown honour and virtue; and where, like the virtuous citizens of Rome\r\nand Sparta, they unreluctantly offer up all the slenderer ties of\r\nblood, the endearments of love, the connexions of friendship, and the\r\nobligations of private gratitude, daily sacrifices and victims to the\r\ncommonwealth; in such a country, the dullest Pamphlet may have a fair\r\nchance of gaining some readers, provided it be a political Pamphlet;\r\nwhilst a treatise on religion or philosophy, unless the writer of it\r\nshould happen to be thoroughly master of his subject, and know how to\r\ntreat it with uncommon genius and learning, would meet with the fate\r\nit deserved, and be received with universal neglect.\r\n\r\nThese are dry insipid studies, fit only for the drudgery of a school\r\nor a college. They are commonly laid aside with the accidence or the\r\ngrammar, are of little use to a man in his commerce with the world,\r\nand contribute rather to obstruct the advancement of his interests\r\nand his fortunes, than to promote them. There are, besides, few men\r\nso unreasonably inquisitive about these matters, as not to be fully\r\nsatisfied with the stock they have already laid in, or who would not\r\neven sooner consent perhaps, to forget half they had ever learned,\r\nthan to take the useless or the dangerous pains of acquiring more. The\r\nworks of a Tillotson, or of a Shaftesbury, of a Seneca, or a Marcus\r\nAntoninus, may possibly be found amongst the lumber of a bookseller’s\r\nwarehouse; may serve, like the works of the Fathers, to fill up the\r\nvacant shelves of a large library; or may, now and then, assist a\r\nclergyman who happens to be ill, or engaged on a Saturday; but they\r\nare of little other use at present. Formerly, indeed, they seem to\r\nhave been read and approved by here and there a man; and some small\r\nencouragement was not wanting to writers, even of this stamp; but this\r\nwas in quiet and peaceful times, times of good government and perfect\r\nsecurity, when men were not universally called upon by the superior\r\nduties they owe to their country, when the constitution was in its\r\nfull vigour, and wanted not the zealous and united efforts of whole\r\nlegions of political labourers, to vindicate and assert its invaluable\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nIn those days, if they were threatened with no invasion from abroad,\r\nnor with popery nor arbitrary power at home; if magna charta, the\r\ndeclaration of rights, habeas corpus, and other fundamental laws of\r\nthe realm, remained unrepealed in full force and exertion, they never\r\ngave themselves any farther concern about the public, but minded what\r\nthey called their own affairs such as their respective trades, arts,\r\ncallings, professions, thereby to be enabled to feed, clothe, and\r\nlodge themselves and their families, and provide for their children.\r\nIf they could contrive to live in peace and plenty at home, and pass\r\namong their customers, their neighbours, and their friends, for honest,\r\nindustrious, good-humoured folks, they thought themselves at liberty\r\nto employ their leisure-hours in what studies they pleased, and looked\r\nno further. They had no notion of political refinements, of those\r\ndelicate and nicer sensations we feel for the public. It never entered\r\ninto their heads to be perpetually making earnest and anxious enquiries\r\nabout the state of the nation; if the body politic was, upon the whole,\r\nsound and in good health, they were no more alarmed at every little\r\ncomplaint, than at a slight cold, or an accidental head-ach. They had\r\nnot indeed the same opportunities of hearing complaints: the book of\r\nknowledge fair, was but half open to them; the sources of information\r\nand instruction were then neither so frequent nor so abundant; every\r\nremote corner of the kingdom was not, as it happily is now, plentifully\r\nsupplied with political, pure, refreshing streams, flowing without\r\nintermission, during the whole year, to the great delight and emolument\r\nof the whole kingdom. Neither were they rich enough to join in large\r\nvoluntary contribution for the feeding, clothing, and support of such\r\na numerous body of sturdy penmen as are now in constant pay. Those\r\ntrusty guardians of our liberties, oraculous as the priestess of\r\nApollo; jealous as Argus of the fair privileges committed to their\r\ncare; watchful of our golden treasures as the green dragons of the\r\nHesperides; faithful and fierce as the bellua centiceps of Pluto;\r\nalarming as the sacred birds that saved the Capitol; zealously attached\r\nto our service; equally vigilant in times of security as in danger, in\r\npeace as in the midst of war; ready at a moment’s warning, on every\r\nalarm, to attack or defend; intrepidly sacrificing to the public every\r\nconsideration that the timidity of other men calls dear to mankind;\r\nlike well-disciplined troops, scorning to loiter away their time in\r\nrusty idleness, daily exercising their arms, performing all their\r\nmarches and counter-marches, evolutions, and firings, with the same\r\nskill and alertness as if the enemy were upon them.\r\n\r\nThese advantages were unknown to our ancestors, and were reserved,\r\namong many other peculiar blessings, for their posterity. Not that\r\ngenius, wit, and learning, appear to have been scarce commodities\r\nin those days; but they laid on their owner’s hands, for want of\r\npurchasers. When the Daily Advertiser, the St. James’s Evening-Post,\r\nand the Gentleman’s Magazine, were as much as they could afford to buy,\r\nmany thousand hands were lying idle for want of employers, and many a\r\nstrenuous and faithful subject, amply qualified, both from his talents\r\nand his virtues, for the service of his country, was shut out from the\r\nhigher employments which nature had formed him for; confined, for mere\r\nwant of bread, to the narrow sphere of a shop-board or a counter, or\r\ncondemned perhaps for life to the sordid drudgery of some laborious\r\nhandicraft trade.\r\n\r\nThe times are now changed; merit is no longer in danger of pining in\r\nobscurity; the high road to wealth and fame is open to all their\r\nvotaries; whether a political writer be inspired by the genuine spirit\r\nof patriotism, inflamed with a fervent zeal for the honour of his\r\nking and his country; whether he aspires to high dignities, places,\r\npensions, or reversions; or whether he be a simple candidate for food\r\nand raiment, it is his own misfortune or fault, not the public’s, if\r\nhe fails: for it is notorious to every man of common observation, that\r\nthe arts and sciences, the children of genius and learning, thrive and\r\nincrease in proportion to the increase of our manufactures, trade, and\r\ncommerce; which enable a rich, indulgent, and munificent public to\r\ncherish, support, and honour them. The immense wealth acquired by these\r\nmeans within these few years, and scattered with generous profusion\r\nover the whole kingdom, is not more remarkable, nor more amazing, than\r\nthe rapid progress which the arts of painting, sculpture, building,\r\ngardening, music, engraving, &c. have made in the same period. Our\r\nartists begin already to rival and surpass the most celebrated artists\r\nof Europe, and bid fair to confer on their country as much honour and\r\nrenown, as those in the ages of Leo X. and Lewis XIV. did on France and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nHitherto, however, they have not reached that lofty summit; being\r\nrather subordinate arts, the arts of elegance and ornament, than\r\nof real and intrinsic use: they are neither held in such general\r\nestimation, nor so liberally rewarded; and are therefore not cultivated\r\nwith the same zeal and assiduity, as others of more immediate benefit\r\nand importance to society.\r\n\r\n  _Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera, &c.\r\n  Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento.\r\n  Hæ tibi erunt artes,----_\r\n\r\nwas an ingenious compliment paid by Virgil to his countrymen; a grave,\r\nserious, sober, virtuous people, like ourselves, devoted to the great\r\ninterests of their country, absorbed in public affairs, and preferring\r\nthe study of government, or the art of politics, to all other arts\r\nwhatever: to this art they were indebted for their prudence,\r\ngenerosity, fortitude, and magnanimity; for their excellent laws and\r\ninstitutions; for their admirable skill in negociations; for the\r\ntreaties they made, the victories they gained, and for their conquests,\r\nin almost every corner of the known world; for all which they are so\r\ndeservedly celebrated and renowned. Part of the Roman, and even part of\r\nthe Grecian art of politics, happily escaped the injuries of time and\r\naccident, and continued, for many hundred years, the constant theme,\r\nadmiration, and example of all writers on politics; but as we lament\r\nthe irreparable loss of the greater part of the productions of those\r\nwise and venerable ancients in philosophy, history, poetry, &c. so we\r\nmust despair of recovering the most valuable part of their writings\r\non the art of politics. The Anticatones of Cæsar; the Acta Diurna,\r\nwhich Cicero expressly mentions to have read daily, with great delight\r\nand instruction, as containing, Senatus consulta, edicta, fabulæ,\r\nrumores, &c. and ten thousand writings of the same kind, are all lost\r\nin one common ruin; and of all these daily Papers and Pamphlets, not\r\none, that I know of, is remaining, to discover to us the stupendous\r\ngenius and art with which they must have been composed, to produce the\r\nastonishing effects they manifestly appear to have done, especially\r\nin the latter times of these republics; such as, by a sort of magic,\r\nto fascinate the understandings and passions of the people, to wield\r\nat their pleasure that unwieldy body the multitude; to compel them,\r\nas it were, to choose or to dismiss what ministers the authors of\r\nthem thought proper; to enact or to repeal what laws they pleased; to\r\nprovoke them to war, or cajole them into peace; in short, to persuade\r\nthem that Scipio was a knave and a traitor, Aristides a common cheat,\r\nCato a coward, and Socrates a sodomite and an impostor; whereas all the\r\nhistorians, biographers, philosophers, and poets of those countries,\r\nagree in representing them as the justest, the greatest, and the wisest\r\nmen of the times in which they lived, or indeed in the times that\r\nsucceeded. It is manifest, likewise, that the very people themselves\r\nhad, for many years together, possessed the same opinion of them; that\r\nthey were universally beloved, honoured, and revered, until they were\r\ndismissed or had resigned, and that after their executions or deaths,\r\nthey were as universally and sincerely lamented.\r\n\r\nIf the great affairs of the world were uniform and consistent, the\r\nopinions of the people would, no doubt, have been suffered to remain\r\nso too; but they being, from their very nature, subject to perpetual\r\nchange and fluctuation, the political writers of those days saw that\r\nit was their business and duty to adjust themselves to accidents\r\nand events, and to the times which they strived to reform; to have\r\nrecourse, like Proteus, to every art, and to assume every imaginable\r\nshape. Now it is well known, that it was no uncommon thing among\r\ntheir countrymen, chearfully to sacrifice their own fortunes, or the\r\nfortunes of other men, their own or other people’s mothers, wives,\r\nchildren, friends, or acquaintances, nay, themselves, as often as\r\nthe more important affairs of the state required it: thus, when it\r\nbecame indispensably necessary for the preservation of liberty and the\r\nconstitution, or for the immediate salvation of their country, they\r\nvery gravely persuaded and prevailed on the people to impeach Scipio\r\nand Aristides, to banish Cicero, to poison Socrates, dissolve the union\r\nthey had so eagerly courted with Sparta or Arpinum, to curse the very\r\nmemories of all those able and upright counsellors who had advised\r\nit, to revile and insult every Lacedemonian or Samnite that had been\r\ninvited to their hospitality, and at length to drive them out of their\r\nhouses, and out of their cities.\r\n\r\nThere are people who pretend, that the Clouds, a dramatic performance\r\nof Aristophanes, is a specimen of the art of writing of which I have\r\nbeen speaking. In my own opinion, however, whether considered as a mere\r\ncomedy, or as a political composition, it is such a pert insipid piece\r\nof buffoonery, written so much in the true spirit of our Grub-street,\r\nthat it could have no manner of chance to produce the effect it is\r\nsupposed to have designed, and does not at all account for the\r\nproblem, being, in every respect, much inferior to our own writings\r\nof that kind, the Nonjuror, and Beggar’s Opera. We know, in short, as\r\nlittle of their art of political writing as of their music; the rise,\r\nprogress, and perfection of both seem to have been owing to the same\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIn arbitrary and despotic governments, fear, as Montesquieu justly\r\nremarks, is the principal engine of government; there the sophi, or the\r\ngrand seignior, or the dey, is the sole legislator; the only person\r\nwho has studied the art of politics, being the only person who is\r\ncalled upon by his country to practise it. This sort of writing being\r\nprincipally applied to the great purposes of provoking or of appeasing\r\nthe people; of awaking them, or laying them asleep; of blinding them,\r\nor restoring them to sight at pleasure, is wholly useless in a country\r\nwhere it is the sovereign’s business to command; the subjects duty to\r\nact, to suffer, and to obey.\r\n\r\nBut in the free governments of Greece and Rome, all ranks, degrees,\r\nand orders of men, patricians and plebeians, from the highest birth,\r\nalliance, and properties, down even to tinkers and coblers, were all\r\neither immediately or remotely perpetually employed, and at work upon\r\nthe constitution; busily and anxiously examining into every part of\r\nit; repairing any breaches that might have been made in it by time or\r\nneglect; framing new laws, or repealing old ones; appointing ministers,\r\nstatesmen, generals, admirals, &c. for all the various departments of\r\npeace and war; choosing faithful, eloquent, zealous tribunes, the great\r\ndefenders of the liberties of the plebeians; voting for peace or for\r\nwar, &c. By this means the arts of politics and music (of which latter\r\nI shall speak hereafter) became the immediate business, employment,\r\nand duty of every individual; as they both had been found, from long\r\nexperience, indispensably necessary for the repose, security, and\r\nduration of the state. The constitution and the inhabitants of Great\r\nBritain in these present times, very much resemble those of which I\r\nhave been speaking. The same instruments of government, therefore,\r\nare as necessary here as they were there; now as they were then: no\r\nencouragement, of course, has been wanting to these arts; and I cannot,\r\nupon this occasion, forbear to congratulate with my countrymen upon the\r\nhappy progress that has been made in them, even within these very few\r\nyears; more especially as our professors had no examples of such sort\r\nof writing before them for their imitation. It would be no difficult\r\nmatter to produce an hundred proofs, both of their skill and their\r\nsuccess. There are, for instance, few people, at this time of day, so\r\ninfatuated as to doubt that it is to them we are indebted that this our\r\nnative land, with all her revenues, dignities, honours, employments,\r\nposts, pensions, reversions, &c. was not seized, three or four years\r\nago, by the violent hands of Scotchmen, who, according to the prophecy\r\nof a late holy prophet, had formed, like the Goths and Vandals, and\r\nother fierce and enterprizing people of the North, the bold design of a\r\ngeneral emigration, had already (as it was currently reported) begun\r\ntheir flight, and were descried at a great distance (as appeared from\r\nmany affidavits made at that time by men of known veracity) like a huge\r\ncloud extending from East to West, from North to South, hovering over\r\nthe fair harvests of our lands and our labours, and ready to settle and\r\ndevour them! As the task assigned to our guardian polemists, upon this\r\noccasion, was difficult and arduous, so the services they performed\r\nwere signal and eminent. The Genius of England had been, at no time,\r\nmore confident of repose, nor had ever fallen into a profounder sleep:\r\nit required the loud roarings and shrieks of a multitude to awaken\r\nhim; and when at length he awoke, it called for the united efforts\r\nof argument, wit, eloquence, eager affirmation, positive assertion,\r\nrepeated oaths, and imprecations, to make him listen for a moment to a\r\nreport, which he treated most imprudently and unwarily with contempt\r\nand laughter. The greater part of his most faithful counsellors were\r\nunhappily under the same fatal delusion, and heard it with the same\r\nscorn and neglect.\r\n\r\nStrange as this dangerous confidence and supineness will appear\r\nto posterity, yet it was not altogether unaccountable; for as the\r\ninhabitants of the South and of the North of Great Britain had been\r\naccustomed to live together, for a great number of years before, in\r\nsuch perfect harmony and mutual affection, that it was no easy matter\r\nto distinguish the one from the other, either by their stature,\r\ncomplexion, language, dress, modes, education, manners, arts, sciences,\r\nreligion, principles of morals, or of government; as the injuries and\r\ndevastations of their former wars with each other, which, as well as\r\nI can remember, they equally and reciprocally suffered and offered,\r\nwere mutually forgotten and forgiven, and had left little traces, but\r\nin history and on record; as they had shewn the same zeal for civil\r\nand religious liberty; had rushed foremost, and begun the first attack\r\nupon the common enemies to both; had enabled us, by engaging first as\r\nprincipals, and afterwards as confederates, to oppose their furious and\r\ndangerous invasions, to repel them as often as they were attempted,\r\nand finally to rout and discomfit them for ever; as they had lent us\r\ntheir assistance likewise, with the same alacrity, in raising that\r\ncurious and wonderful fabric which we built on the ruins of the ancient\r\nstructure; venerable and awful as the Capitol, and composed of more\r\ndurable materials, which, in the course of many centuries, had by turns\r\nbeen often secretly undermined, treacherously betrayed, and openly and\r\nviolently battered, and by turns, as often as we had opportunity or\r\nabilities, recovered and repaired. As it was reared with their hands,\r\nand cemented with their blood, as well as with our own, they were\r\ninvited, by the advice of our counsellors, most renowned for their\r\ngravity, penetration, wisdom, and virtue, to all the advantages of its\r\nprotection; but they had a Capitol of their own, which, although it\r\nwas neither so splendid, nor so magnificent, nor so vast, yet they had\r\nthat superstitious love and veneration for it which is common to all\r\nnations, and which nature, education, and habit, has deeply implanted\r\nin the hearts of all honest men and good citizens, and were unwilling\r\nto quit it. We knew by experience that they were powerful allies; we\r\nthought them faithful friends, and we had found on record, mortifying\r\nas it was to remember it, that as often as they had been provoked or\r\ninsulted, they had been formidable and dangerous enemies. We plainly\r\nsaw that it was our interest they should be united to us for ever;\r\nand all our political arts and resources were employed to convince\r\nthem it was theirs too. At last, after large promises and assurances\r\nof honours, riches, and everlasting love; they were prevailed on,\r\nalthough reluctantly, to consent. The advantages we derived from this\r\nunion, by the abilities and virtues of their statesmen, the valour,\r\nskill, thirst of glory, and spirit of enterprize of their sailors and\r\nsoldiers; the genius, wit, taste, eloquence, and learning of their\r\ndivines, philosophers, historians, poets, lawyers, physicians, &c., the\r\ninventions of their artists; the industry of their merchants, &c. had\r\nbeen, until lately, manifest to all men, and were freely acknowledged\r\nby all men, who possessed or pretended to candor and impartiality.\r\n\r\nMen, indeed, conversant with history, knew well enough that the\r\nGoths, Vandals, Huns, Saracens, Turks, and Moors, had been invited to\r\nan alliance, in times of emergency and extreme danger; some of them\r\nby the Romans, others by the Spaniards, Italians, &c. that they, at\r\nfirst, fought for them, and defended them against their enemies; but\r\nturned, at last, their arms against the very people who had called them\r\nin, invaded their properties, usurped their governments, and finally\r\ndestroyed their constitution. But they reflected at the same time that\r\nthese people were not formed to live long together on any good terms of\r\nmutual friendship, and confidence, being neither born under the same\r\nclimate, nor of the same colour, nor educated in the same principles of\r\nmanners, morals, nor government, nor speaking the same language, nor\r\nworshipping the same god. There could not, therefore, be any stable\r\nprinciple of union in so heterogeneous a mixture: the interest of the\r\none was to disband them like mercenaries, when the service was over;\r\nthe policy of the other, to use the opportunity their arms had given\r\nthem to remain where they were, and seize all they could get.\r\n\r\nSome few politicians, nevertheless, there were among us (the very\r\npoliticians I have so justly extolled) of deeper penetration and\r\nmore enlarged views, who scrupled not to give shrewd hints, that the\r\nalliance between England and Scotland teemed with the same mischief;\r\nbut these insinuations were supposed to be the effects of private\r\ninterest, or of a malignant disposition; or, at the best, the mere\r\npleasantries of idle wags. Nor indeed (if what has been said of the\r\nNorth Britons be admitted) ought it to pass for matter of wonder\r\nthat what we emphatically call the Union, should appear to vulgar\r\neyes totally different from the alliance between the people of whom\r\nI have been speaking. It was, therefore, the prevailing and common\r\nopinion, that an Englishman might, with equal reason, be jealous of a\r\nman born in another country or city, or of his next door neighbour,\r\nor of his brother, as of a Scotchman. Now no man can be found so\r\nfoolish as to own such a jealousy, how much soever he may feel it; all\r\nmen being agreed to allow, that there cannot be a surer mark of a\r\nshallow understanding, and a wicked temper; yet it sometimes happens\r\nin private families, that the elder son, either from the vanity or\r\noverweening fondness which people feel for their first productions,\r\nor from novelty, or the ambition of transmitting to posterity their\r\nnames, titles, and possessions, is dandled and cockered in his infancy,\r\npampered in his childhood, flattered in his follies, and indulged in\r\nhis vices; during his youth exempted from the drudgery of reading\r\nand study, from the labours and anxieties of trade, and from the\r\nfatigues and dangers of war; secured from want by the liberality of\r\nhis parents, and from all solicitude about the future, but for the\r\nspeedy removal of one only obstacle to the accomplishment of all his\r\nwishes; carefully trained, indeed, to those noble principles which\r\ncreate authority and distinction in the great scenes of pleasure and\r\nidleness; but instructed in no other. The fate of his younger brother\r\nis frequently very different: if he be fed, cloathed, and taught, it\r\nis all he has a right to expect; he must be flogged to his books; his\r\npassions, follies, and vices, must be perpetually controuled, that\r\nthey may not obstruct his fortune in the world; and he must be, after\r\nall this, compelled to some profession, art, or business, to keep\r\nhim from starving, when his parents cannot or will not contribute\r\nany longer to his support. Now if he should chance, in the course of\r\nsuch an education, to learn the habits of temperance, frugality, and\r\nindustry, and qualify himself, after the hard labour of many years,\r\nfor the employment or profession of a divine, a statesman, a lawyer,\r\na physician, an artist, a merchant, &c. one would naturally suppose\r\nthat his elder brother would rejoice in his success; and being himself\r\ntotally ignorant and incapable of all these matters, would court his\r\nassistance, as often as his business, his pleasures, his affairs,\r\nhis health, his own preservation, or the safety and interest of his\r\ncountry required. Something of this sort does now-and-then happen, I\r\nbelieve, among the numerous families in Great Britain; and although\r\nthere are not wanting even multitudes of elder brothers, of the highest\r\ndistinction and eminence in every acquisition, accomplishment, talent,\r\nand virtue, yet they have not been found so abundant as to answer all\r\nthe exigencies either of private or public life; recourse, therefore,\r\nmust be had to somebody: by this means the younger brothers came to\r\nbe employed occasionally; sometimes the elder and the younger were\r\nemployed indiscriminately; but the preference was commonly shewn to the\r\nelder, according to that prevailing alacrity with which most men fly to\r\nthe aid of the rich and the powerful.\r\n\r\nThis, as far as I have been able to discover, was supposed to be pretty\r\nmuch the case with the South and the North Britons, until of late.\r\n\r\nWhen his present majesty (the first of our kings born in this country\r\nsince the Union) succeeded to the throne, he was most graciously\r\npleased to assure his subjects, that, among many other peculiar\r\nfelicities of his reign, he gloried in the name of Briton. The name\r\nof Briton was impartial, general, and comprehensive in its meaning,\r\nand most equitable in its intention. The prudent and wise application\r\nof it, on that great occasion, was acknowledged by all men (and all\r\ngood men united in their hopes) that the time was now come when all\r\ndistinctions, excepting the eternal distinctions of vice and virtue,\r\nwould be buried in oblivion; when every honest man, and every good\r\ncitizen, should be intitled to his majesty’s protection; and if his\r\ntalents happened to be useful to the state, to his royal favour and\r\nbounty. No prince had ever ascended the throne of these kingdoms so\r\nuniversally beloved and revered. His dominions every where resounded\r\nwith mutual congratulations, with the praises of so excellent a\r\nmonarch; and the breasts of all his subjects were filled with the most\r\nexulting hopes of a long and glorious reign. These halcyon days were\r\nsoon succeeded by a furious tempest, that had well nigh overwhelmed\r\nus (in the very bosom of repose and tranquillity)! A most execrable\r\nand horrid plot was said to be discovered (which had been long formed)\r\nconcealed with the same secrecy, and designed to have been executed\r\nwith more universal and fatal effect, than the famous gunpowder plot.\r\nMuch pains has been taken to get at the bottom of this plot; but no\r\nexact information, at least that I know of, has yet been obtained of\r\nit, or of the conspirators. Some pronounced it a democratical plot,\r\nothers affirmed it to be an aristocratical plot; some pretended\r\nit was a tory plot, others protested it was a whiggish plot; many\r\noffered large betts that they would prove it to be a jacobite plot,\r\nsome archly squinted at it as a popish plot; but the true and zealous\r\nfriends of their country swore by G--d it was a Scottish plot: there\r\nwere, indeed, a few, who insinuated that it was no plot at all; but as\r\nthese latter were known to be inveterate enemies to all such names and\r\ndenominations, they were of course supposed to bear no good-will to\r\ntheir countrymen; there not being more than one in a thousand of them\r\nwho does not call himself by one or other of these names: so that their\r\nopinion was almost universally treated with the contempt and scorn it\r\ndeserved. The opinion that it was a Scottish plot I think, prevailed\r\nvery generally in that part of Great Britain called England, and in\r\nBerwick upon Tweed. Then it began gradually to be doubted, then to be\r\nwholly disbelieved, for even a considerable time: happily it is now at\r\nthis very day revived; and, by the fervent zeal and marvellous skill of\r\nthose faithful guardians of our liberties, whom I have formerly spoken\r\nof, the eyes of all men are at length opened, and nobody is found so\r\nmad as to doubt it. For notwithstanding all I have said, and said most\r\ninnocently, of our brethren of Scotland (an appellation we fondly gave\r\nthem in times of our great distress) for the truth of which I beg\r\nleave to appeal to the honour and consciences of all my countrymen,\r\nwho have ever happened to see them, converse with them, employ them,\r\nserve with them, in the navy or the army; hear them in the pulpit, at\r\nthe bar, or in either houses of parliament; observe their buildings,\r\nengravings, and other arts; or read their productions; yet no true\r\nlovers of liberty can be too circumspect nor too vigilantly on their\r\nguard against the danger even of possibilities; it being an established\r\nmaxim among all politicians of free countries, that Credulity is the\r\nmother of Danger, as she is the daughter of Stupidity and Ignorance,\r\nand has been the total ruin of many nations: for proof of which they\r\nproduce examples from the histories of all countries; such as the\r\nsecret machinations of many the most illustrious patricians and\r\nwealthiest plebeians against the constitution of Rome, in the times of\r\nMarius, Sylla, Catiline, Pompey, and Cæsar, which, by the credulity\r\nof the people, lurked for a long while undiscovered and unsuspected,\r\nuntil it burst forth on a sudden in open and violent attacks, and ended\r\nin the total ruin of it; yet all these were Romans. The same wicked\r\ndesigns were said to have been formed, not long since, by the Jesuits\r\nin France and Portugal, and to have been almost ripe for execution;\r\nbut were happily discovered before it was too late, and prevented;\r\nyet these Jesuits were all Frenchmen or Portuguese. Neither are there\r\nwanting examples of this sort, even in the history of our own country,\r\nin the reigns of Charles I., Charles II. and James II. The greater\r\npart of the nobility, gentry, divines, and lawyers, were detected in a\r\nconspiracy against the lives and properties of their fellow-subjects,\r\nand the religion and liberty of this kingdom was dragged to the very\r\nbrink of destruction; yet these conspirators appear, to the best of\r\nmy remembrance of the histories of those times, to have been all,\r\nwith the exception of a few Scotchmen, Englishmen. These undeniable\r\nfacts are sufficient to warn us against the fatal consequences of\r\ncredulity, and the danger of trusting to the outward appearances I\r\nhave been describing, however fair. Let us not, therefore, shut our\r\nears to the cries of the streets, nor turn away our eyes from the\r\nlamentations of the news-papers. Let us not be cozened by the arts of\r\ncrafty and designing men, who maliciously and falsely represent them as\r\nthe counterfeit tears, the groans and wailings of hired mourners; the\r\nsnarling, roaring, and howling, of ravenous faction; or the hooting,\r\ncackling, and braying, of a wayward and deluded mob: they are the\r\ngenerous and noble calls of liberty; the genuine voice of the venerable\r\nand sacred multitude, neither provoked by private resentment, nor\r\nbribed by promises, nor awed by fear, nor urged by hunger, nor sold for\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nI have read almost every Pamphlet and Paper that has been published\r\nwithin these five years on political subjects, with equal delight and\r\nastonishment at the deep and comprehensive judgment, wit, spirit,\r\nand humour, with which many of them are manifestly written; and I\r\ncongratulate with my countrymen, on the rapid progress we are making\r\nin this art. Their erudition I have not mentioned, it having been\r\ndiscovered to be of no use at all in the knowledge or exercise of this\r\nart. It is an observation of the great lord Bacon, that a man will\r\nnever get to the end of his journey, if he happens to mistake the way,\r\nand go the wrong road; which he has clearly proved in his immortal\r\ntreatises, Novum Organum, and De Augmentis Scientiarum. Now, men had\r\nbeen taught to believe, until very lately, before the discovery of\r\na direct road, and a short cut, that the composition of a professed\r\npolitician required as many and as great a variety of ingredients,\r\nas Cicero’s orator, or the knight-errant of Don Quixote: accordingly\r\nthe great baron Montesquieu confesseth, That after the hardy study\r\nand drudgery of twenty-five years, by day and by night, consumed in\r\nthe production of two small volumes; he believed them, on mature\r\nrevisal, unworthy of the public; in a fit of despair dashed them\r\nagainst the wall; and had not the wall, as he affirms, returned them,\r\nthey would never have been heard of. Since this discovery was made,\r\nwhich I shall explain hereafter, it has been found out, to the saving\r\nof much labour, that the study of ancient and modern history, laws,\r\ntreaties, political systems, &c. is mere loss of time, and downright\r\npedantry. There are very few of our modern politicians to be seen now\r\nadays, bestrewed with learned dust, like Pope’s politician; or smelling\r\nof the lamp, like Demosthenes; or lean, like Cassius, with constant\r\nmeditation; or pale and blind with poring over Tacitus, Aristotle,\r\nPlato, Montesquieu, Harrington, Sidney, or Locke. They have heard that\r\nthese books contain nothing more than a parcel of crude maxims, or\r\nthe idle dreams of unpractised pedants and schoolmen; declamations on\r\nliberty, which any man in this country may learn at his leisure, in\r\nthe first company he chances to meet, over a dish of coffee, or over a\r\nbottle; general arguments in behalf of the rights of mankind, which,\r\naccording to Cicero, every man is taught by instinct; Est igitur hæc\r\njudices non scripta, sed nata lex, quam non didicimus, accipimus,\r\nlegimus; verùm ex naturâ ipsâ, arripuimus, hausimus, expressimus; and\r\nthe visions of vain projectors, stuffed with ridiculous notions, and\r\nimpracticable doctrines; such as that it may not be altogether safe\r\nnor proper for the whole body of a great nation, any more than for any\r\nprivate person, to eat or drink, or sleep, or dress, or sing, or dance,\r\nor game too much: that it is possible, even for a maritime power, to\r\ncarry on too much trade: that drunkenness, adultery, bribing, and\r\nperjury, at elections, are not very commendable practices: that even\r\nannual parliaments, nevertheless, may be more eligible than septennial\r\nones, especially as many of its members may happen to learn as much\r\nof the business of the senate at the end of six months as at the\r\nconclusion of seven years: that a standing army, in time of peace, may\r\nbe dangerous to liberty, unless it should be voted by the legislative\r\npower, although the officers who composed it were forty times more\r\nvaliant than the rest of their fellow-subjects, and just as honest\r\nand virtuous as ninety-nine in a hundred of them; tamen miserrimum\r\nest posse si velit: that a militia cannot well be too numerous, even\r\nthough the consumption of silk, or velvet, or lace, or ribbands, or\r\ntrinkets, should be thereby considerably diminished, and even though it\r\nshould be necessary to discipline it on the seventh day of every week:\r\nthat it may be possible in the nature of things for large fleets to\r\ntransport armies an hundred miles, and land them safely within sixty\r\nmiles of a great, unwarlike, and defenceless capital: that the king,\r\neven of a free people, may be legally and constitutionally possessed\r\nof certain instruments, engines, and powers, of unfailing efficacy, in\r\ntimes of general depravity; by means of which, if he chance, instead of\r\nbeing the friend and father of his people, to be wicked, an usurper,\r\nand a tyrant, he may gain over, to any purpose he pleases, the souls\r\nand bodies of three-fourths of them: that a free people, not clearly\r\ndiscerning the reciprocal duties of protection and obedience, and prone\r\nto confound the frenzy of sedition with the modesty of true liberty,\r\nmay, peradventure, tumultuously and violently obstruct the execution\r\nof the known laws of the land, madly insult, in the public streets,\r\na prince devoted to their happiness, threaten to blow out the brains\r\nof his friends and servants, and attempt to overawe the senate, in\r\nthe very midst of their public deliberations: that some care should\r\nbe taken to prevent such enormities from creeping into a free state:\r\nin short, as there never had been any man, according to the unanimous\r\nopinion of all divines and philosophers, who had ever written on\r\nvirtue, so perfectly good, but he might still be made somewhat better;\r\nso all these politicians agreed, that no constitution was ever so\r\nnicely and exactly framed, but it might possibly admit some addition\r\nor amendment; turpiterque desperatur quicquid fieri potest. Such\r\n(with many other wild projects and strange fancies of the like sort)\r\nwere the whimsical contents of these famous writings, that had once\r\nmade so much noise in the world. They are now universally neglected\r\nand exploded; they may cry aloud, but no man regardeth them. As lord\r\nBacon was the first who shewed the right way to the study of natural\r\nphilosophy, so Machiavel, a man of the most abundant invention, the\r\nmost magnanimous resolution, and the most consummate abilities, was\r\nthe first of all the moderns who discovered and pointed out the direct\r\nand short road to the art of political writing: and as the Whole Duty\r\nof Man was calculated for the service and benefit of private families,\r\nso Il Principe, that transcendant composition, that master-piece\r\nof the human genius, was designed, by its immortal author, for the\r\ninstruction of royal families only, as the title of it implies, and\r\nconsecrated to the use of kings and princes. It had no sooner made\r\nits appearance among them, than it was beheld with admiration, read\r\nwith avidity, applied with success, and became the standing rule of\r\npolitics among all the potentates of Europe, even among the kings\r\nof Great Britain, until the Revolution; at which time, by means of\r\ncertain innovations, and the introduction of some new-fangled opinions,\r\nit lost all credit with them, and has never recovered it to this day;\r\nnevertheless, as every man in this kingdom is intitled to some share in\r\nthe government of it, it becomes his duty likewise to inform himself in\r\nwhat manner it may be best governed; and in researches of this kind,\r\nthese golden rules, which the king had overlooked, or neglected, or\r\ndespised, his subjects happily discovered, adopted, and practised.\r\nThat this discovery has been made, is plain to every body who has read\r\nthe Prince of Machiavel, and the writings of our modern politicians.\r\nMany a man too may remember how much he was surprized at the novelty\r\nof a book, which, with the most mortifying scorn, contradicted every\r\nopinion and principle that he had imbibed from his mother, or had been\r\ntaught by his father, or his schoolmaster; the avowed design of it\r\nbeing to prove, that dissimulation, hypocrisy, fraud, lying, cruelty,\r\ntreachery, assassination, and massacres, were not only commodious and\r\nexpedient, on certain occasions, but that they were moral, political,\r\nand positive duties: that all men who did not believe in these unerring\r\nrules, were either fools, or madmen; and that all nations who had\r\nnot, or did not, put them in constant practice, had been, or must\r\nbe, infallibly undone. He did not, indeed, expressly include slander\r\nand defamation by name; conceiving, probably, that they were fully\r\ncomprehended under the articles of lying and assassination, and that it\r\nwas a mere matter of indifference, to ninety-nine men in an hundred,\r\nwhether you plundered them of the characters of honest men, and good\r\ncitizens, or knocked out their brains. Happily for this deluded nation,\r\nwe have now among us many disciples of this renowned politician, of\r\nconsiderable eminence and proficiency: to their united and zealous\r\nefforts for the common weal, we are indebted (perhaps before it is\r\ntoo late) for many useful and salutary discoveries; such as that\r\n********, under all the fair appearances of candor and humanity;\r\nthe sacred semblance of unblemished truth, justice, and mercy; the\r\nspecious disguise of the most unambitious and unaffected love of all\r\nhis fellow-creatures, concealed the dark and dangerous designs of a\r\nTiberius: that *****, who had been called from retirement and the study\r\nof philosophy to the instruction of his ****, and who had cajoled\r\nall that knew him into an obstinate belief that he was a nobleman of\r\ndistinguished honour and virtue, an accomplished scholar, a munificent\r\npatron of learning and the arts, an upright counsellor, an eloquent\r\nsenator, and an able statesman, was at the bottom a knave, a dunce,\r\na traitor, a bashaw, a Gaveston, a Wolsey, a Buckingham, a Sejanus:\r\nthat *****, who had passed almost universally for a patrician of a\r\nmost amiable, unreserved, and generous nature, beloved by his friends\r\nand his equals, for his noble and ingenuous manners; as courteous and\r\naffable to his inferiors, as if his high birth and fortune had not\r\ngiven him a right of prescription to insult them; of great humanity,\r\nkindness, and beneficence; a citizen warmly attached to the interests\r\nof his country; a statesman who had executed, during half a century,\r\nthe highest employments of government with zeal and integrity; had sat\r\nin the councils, and joined in the suffrages of our patriot ministers,\r\nin the most illustrious period of our annals, and had spent his whole\r\nlife in the uniform support of liberty; that this very patrician could\r\nhardly prove a single claim either to the virtues of social life, the\r\nmerit of public services, the authority of experience, or even to\r\nthe common privileges of age, and deserved to be treated as a very\r\ndrunkard, a glutton, and an old woman: that ****, the arch-magician,\r\nwho, by virtue of irresistible spells and incantations, and by the\r\npowers of certain wonderful and stupendous operations, unknown to all\r\nbut himself, and the great magicians of ancient times, had palmed\r\nhimself upon the universal people, not only of Great Britain, but of\r\nalmost the whole globe, as the deliverer of his country, the colossus\r\nof the age; as a philosopher, statesman, and patriot of the first\r\nmagnitude; possessing the genius, experience, eloquence, and consummate\r\nabilities of Pericles, and the virtues of Epaminondas; the decus\r\nimperii, the spes suprema senatus; was, after all, an impudent babbler,\r\na profligate villain, a shameless turncoat, a pensioned hireling,\r\na fawning minion, a common bully, a pernicious and treacherous\r\ncounsellor, a prodigal squanderer of the blood and treasures of his\r\nfellow-subjects; in short, a madman, and the perdition of his country.\r\nThese and many other discoveries of the same kind, equally new and\r\nimportant, are known and familiar to all men, who have studied the\r\nworks of our modern politicians, and sufficiently evince the progress\r\nwe have made in this art; yet it appears to be still far short of the\r\nperfection to which it was carried by the ancients, as I have already\r\nlamented; otherwise, with half the honest pains they have taken to\r\naccomplish it, the **** would have been d----d long ago; his friends\r\nand servants torn in pieces one after another, like the De Witts,\r\nand other betrayers of their country, and their names, like theirs,\r\nconsigned to perpetual infamy. As our political writings unhappily have\r\nnot yet reached that last perfection, neither has our music. To such as\r\nhave never happened to read the works of Aristotle, Plato, Quinctilian,\r\nand others of the ancients, what I have to say about the latter art,\r\nmay possibly appear somewhat extraordinary. It is, nevertheless, very\r\ncertain, they all considered music not only as an important, but as an\r\nindispensable part of the qualifications of a politician; Non igitur,\r\nfrustra, Plato civili viro, quem politicon vocant, necessariam musicen\r\ncredidit, says Quinctilian. It was one of the fundamental laws of\r\nthe republic of Arcadia, that every man should learn music until he\r\nwas thirty years of age. Themistocles the Athenian was treated as a\r\nvain boaster, for pretending that he could make a great kingdom of a\r\nsmall one, without availing himself of its assistance. The rigid and\r\naustere lawgiver of Sparta carefully mingled it with the composition\r\nof his renowned government, used it on all occasions with incredible\r\nefficacy, and by this means preserved it from corruption, for seven\r\nhundred years. The wise Socrates studied it with uncommon assiduity\r\nand success: and Pythagoras boldly declared, that the great system of\r\nthe universe was framed on its principles, and governed by its powers;\r\nin short, that it was all in all. Music, in their acceptation of the\r\nword, indeed, had somewhat of a more comprehensive meaning than it has\r\nat present; including not only stringed instruments, wind instruments,\r\nrope instruments, parchment instruments, bone and iron instruments, but\r\npoetry likewise, and many other sorts of harmony. Of this marvellous\r\nart we have hitherto but imperfect ideas. Shakespear just hints at it,\r\nand freely gives it as his opinion, that the man who knows it not, must\r\nbe a traitor, a villain, and a murderer. Mr. Pope too conceived that\r\nthe music of Mr. Handel had a remarkable influence over the passions\r\nand affections. Handel learned the little he knew of this art from the\r\nRomans, who, according to Quinctilian, surpassed all the nations of the\r\nworld in their martial music, as much as they excelled them in their\r\nmilitary achievements; Quid, autem aliud in nostris legionibus, cornua,\r\nac tubæ faciunt? Quorum concentus, quanto est vehementior, tantum\r\nRomana in bellis gloria cæteris præstat. And at this day the Roman or\r\nItalian music, depraved, corrupted, and enervated as it is become in\r\nthe course of two thousand years, has no inconsiderable power over the\r\nminds of our legislators, statesmen, and warriors. The force of it\r\nhas been felt in France, a country not much renowned for this art. M.\r\nVoltaire insinuates, that a song in the time of Calvin, the burden of\r\nwhich was, O Moines, O Moines, &c. contributed more than any thing to\r\nthe noble struggle a part of that country made, for forty years, in\r\ndefence of their religious liberty. So well aware was our Edward I. of\r\nits universal power, that he could never assure himself of the perfect\r\nand lasting conquest of Wales, until he had murdered all the Welsh\r\nbards. If I mistake not, he attempted to do the same by the bards of\r\nScotland: the immortal Ossian escaped him; and his music, calculated\r\nwith the most consummate political art to inspire the breasts of\r\nall his countrymen with every passion, affection, sentiment, and\r\nprinciple of heroic virtue, that might make them happy at home, beloved\r\nand respected by their friends, and terrible to their enemies, the\r\nNorwegians, Irish, or English, was reserved until some great occasion\r\nshould call it forth; and accordingly did not make its appearance until\r\nvery lately. Something of the same kind was immediately attempted by\r\nour English bards, with the wise and benevolent intention of inspiring\r\nand instructing their countrymen; but not, I believe, with quite the\r\nsame success. Some compositions, however, we have that are not without\r\na considerable share of merit; among which there is, for instance,\r\na well-known jig, I cannot name, that is observed to produce a very\r\nsensible effect upon our young men and women. Our sportsmen never\r\ncease to shout at, “With hounds, and with horn.” All men kindle at,\r\n“Britons strike home,” “Britannia rule the waves,” &c. Every man must\r\nhave remarked the unusual loyalty which never fails to appear in the\r\ncountenances of a whole audience at the excellent music of, “God save\r\ngreat George our king. Happy,” &c. Lullybylero, according to bishop\r\nBurnet, was sung by every man, woman, and child, throughout the whole\r\nkingdom, until the very person of every Irishman was contemptible and\r\nodious for near half a century. And I do not despair that some able\r\nand skilful bard may hereafter arise, truly penetrated and inspired by\r\nthe patriot love we bear our country, and thoroughly inflamed with that\r\nmanly and generous indignation we feel at the very name of a Scot, who,\r\nby means of a song or a ballad, may awaken the fury of an angry people,\r\ndissolve the union, and cut the throat of every North Briton in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor capital, p. 21. l. 8. from the bottom, read Capitol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\nMinor errors in punctuation have been fixed.\r\n\r\nThe Erratum has been applied.",
