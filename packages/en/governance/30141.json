H. MILROY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of many important military operations in the present war,\r\nwill be recorded most correctly in the proceedings of the Courts of\r\nInquiry and Courts Martial, which, from time to time, have been or may\r\nbe organized to investigate the conduct of the parties responsible for\r\nthem. The reports of commanding officers are no doubt often colored, if\r\nnot by their own interests and inclinations, at least by their\r\nenthusiasm and partial view of their own purposes; and even the\r\ndescription of disinterested reporters and eye witnesses may be\r\ndistorted and exaggerated, either by their own peculiarities of excited\r\nimagination, or from their imperfect opportunities for observation. But\r\nin cases where numerous witnesses are questioned, and cross examined\r\nunder the solemnities of judicial proceeding, each one knowing that\r\nothers equally well informed have been or subsequently will be\r\ninterrogated on the same points, the probabilities in favor of a\r\ntruthful result are very greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June last, the sudden and unexpected irruption of\r\nthe rebel army under General Lee into the Shenandoah Valley, surprised\r\nand surrounded a division of our army, commanded by Major-General R. H.\r\nMilroy, and compelled the evacuation of that post, in a manner and under\r\ncircumstances which have elicited the severest criticism and censure of\r\nthe public press. The commanding officer of these forces was placed in\r\narrest by the General-in-chief of the army. No charges were made against\r\nhim; but he himself demanded a court of inquiry, which was ordered by\r\nthe President. That court has recently concluded its labors, and the\r\ntestimony taken has been submitted to the President as the\r\nCommander-in-chief of the army, for his examination and decision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough this particular affair was one of subordinate importance, it\r\nwas, nevertheless, somewhat connected with the great invasion of\r\nPennsylvania by the rebel army last summer; and on that account, as well\r\nas from its own intrinsic interest, it is well worth the brief notice\r\nwhich we now propose to give it. In the general history of the war, the\r\nminute detail of such operations will necessarily be overlooked; but the\r\ninterest of truth requires that the principal features and the actual\r\nresult, even in these cases, should be fairly stated, and especially\r\nthat the actors should receive impartial judgment at the hands of the\r\npublic, with such just censure or applause as may be due to their\r\nconduct. In the tremendous operations of the war now raging around us,\r\nminor events may escape present attention; but no part of the great and\r\nbloody drama can fail to be of importance to the future student of this\r\nmomentous period in our national history.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the occurrences that form the subject of the inquiry\r\nrecently instituted, from which we chiefly derive the materials for this\r\nsketch, General Milroy was in the department and under the immediate\r\ncommand of Major-General R. C. Schenck, whose headquarters were at\r\nBaltimore. The force at Winchester consisted in all of about nine\r\nthousand men, and this body had occupied that position for six months\r\nprevious to the evacuation. The particular work assigned to General\r\nMilroy and his command, was to assist in guarding that important link of\r\ncommunication, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, against the incursions\r\nof a considerable rebel force in the valley, under the notorious leaders\r\nImboden, Jones, and Jenkins. The forces at Winchester constituted but a\r\npart of those employed in this service. There was, of course, a\r\nconsiderable body of men at Harper's Ferry, with smaller bodies at\r\nMartinsburg, Romney, and New Creek, all intended to coöperate in the\r\nprotection of the railroad.\r\n\r\nA question of much interest had been started between General Halleck,\r\nthe general-in-chief of the army, and General Schenck, the commander of\r\nthe department, as to the best means of disposing the forces on this\r\nroad, for its complete security. General Halleck thought the proper mode\r\nwas to post his forces immediately on the line of the road, with\r\nblockhouses and other defences for resisting the attacks of the enemy.\r\nGeneral Schenck, on the other hand, insisted upon holding a line some\r\ndistance to the south, with a view of watching the enemy, and meeting\r\nhis attacks before he reached the immediate vicinity of the road. This\r\ndifference of opinion had been the subject of frequent discussion\r\nbetween these two officers, and gave rise to several telegraphic\r\ncommunications from General Halleck to General Schenck, which the former\r\nprobably intended as orders, but which the latter, in view of their\r\npeculiar phraseology, considered to be merely advisory, and not having\r\nthe character of peremptory orders. General Halleck expressed the\r\ndecided opinion, if he did not actually command, that the main body of\r\nGeneral Milroy's forces should be withdrawn from Winchester, and a small\r\nforce only left as an outpost to watch the enemy. General Schenck, on\r\nthe other hand, as he testified before the Court of Inquiry, believed\r\nthat any small force left at that point must inevitably be captured; and\r\nhe therefore determined to leave the whole garrison until the occasion\r\nshould occur for its withdrawal. He therefore gave no order to General\r\nMilroy to evacuate his position until after the telegraphic wire had\r\nbeen cut, when it was too late to communicate with him. On the contrary,\r\nthe last order received from General Schenck, at Winchester, was to hold\r\nthe position and await further orders.\r\n\r\nThe solicitude about the forces at Winchester arose from the anticipated\r\nmovements of Lee's rebel army. After the disastrous battle of\r\nChancellorsville, it soon became the subject of universal apprehension\r\nthat the victors in that field would make an attempt upon Washington,\r\nand with that ultimate object would invade Maryland and Pennsylvania. In\r\nthe early days of June, the movements of the enemy on the Rappahannock\r\nindicated some aggressive design, though the precise nature of the\r\nenterprise about to be undertaken was unknown to our military\r\nauthorities, who waited with much anxiety for its development. A great\r\nraid across the Potomac by Stuart's famous cavalry was anticipated; but\r\nits inception was thought to have been seriously embarrassed, if not\r\nwholly thwarted, by the several attacks of our own forces, especially by\r\nthat at Beverly Ford. Still the mysterious movements of the rebel army\r\nperplexed our generals, while a distinct impression prevailed everywhere\r\nthat the Confederates were about to advance northward, menacing\r\nWashington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhile this state of uncertainty mystified the General-in-chief, as he\r\nsat at the centre of his converging lines of telegraphic wires, and\r\nparalyzed the movements of the Army of the Potomac, there began to be an\r\nunusual activity of the rebel forces on the several roads leading\r\nthrough the passes of the Blue Ridge, in the direction of Harper's Ferry\r\nand Winchester. It was on Friday, the 12th day of June, that the first\r\nindications were seen of the approach of the enemy in force. On that day\r\na strong reconnoitring party from Winchester was sent out on the\r\nStrasburg road, under command of Colonel Shawl, of the 87th Pennsylvania\r\nVolunteer Infantry. This party consisted of Colonel Shawl's regiment of\r\ninfantry, the 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry, and one section of Battery L,\r\nof the 5th regular artillery; and when its advance was within about two\r\nmiles of Middletown, it encountered a superior force of cavalry drawn up\r\nin line of battle. By a well-concerted piece of strategy, the enemy was\r\nlured into pursuit until he fell into an ambush, and received the\r\neffective fire both of our artillery and infantry from a dense wood\r\nwithin one hundred yards of the road. Repulsed and pursued by our\r\ncavalry, the enemy retreated in confusion, and in this handsome little\r\naffair lost no less than fifty in killed and wounded, and thirty-seven\r\nprisoners. These prisoners all proved to be part of the rebel forces\r\nwhich had long been in the valley, and thus served to allay all\r\napprehension of the approach of any part of Lee's army from that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAnother reconnoissance, under Lieutenant-Colonel Moss, of the 12th\r\nPennsylvania Cavalry, was sent out on the Front Royal road on the same\r\nday. On his return, this officer reported a large force of the enemy,\r\nconsisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, at Cedarville, twelve\r\nmiles from Winchester; but as the accounts of officers present, and of\r\nreliable scouts, were contradictory, and as it did not appear that he\r\nhad taken the precautions necessary to enable him to ascertain the\r\nstrength and character of the enemy, the report of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMoss was discredited. Nevertheless, on Friday night, the pickets around\r\nWinchester were doubled, and strong cavalry patrols were kept out on all\r\nthe principal roads. A messenger was also sent to Colonel McReynolds,\r\nwho commanded the 3d brigade at Berryville, notifying him that the enemy\r\nwas reported to be in force on the Front Royal road, and ordering him to\r\nreconnoitre in that direction, to be in readiness to move, and in case\r\nof serious attack, to fall back on Winchester. It was also arranged that\r\nupon the firing of the four large guns in the fort at Winchester he was\r\nto march immediately to that place. Accordingly, on Saturday morning, at\r\nabout 8 o'clock, the enemy was reported to be approaching on the Front\r\nRoyal road, and the concerted signal was given for the return of the 3d\r\nbrigade, under Colonel McReynolds, to unite with the main forces at\r\nWinchester. Berryville is on the direct road from Winchester to Harper's\r\nFerry, about twenty miles from the latter place, and ten from the\r\nformer. The 3d brigade, under Colonel McReynolds, consisting of his own\r\nregiment, the 1st New York Cavalry, commanded by Major A. W. Adams, the\r\n6th Indiana Infantry, the 67th Pennsylvania Infantry, and the Baltimore\r\nbattery, Captain Alexander, had been stationed at Berryville, to keep\r\nopen the road to Harper's Ferry, and to watch the passes of the Blue\r\nRidge and the fords of the Shenandoah river in that direction.\r\n\r\nWhen this part of General Milroy's forces was thus ordered to join him\r\nat Winchester, it was not known or suspected that any portion of General\r\nLee's army was in the valley. The movement was made with a view to\r\nconcentrate the command, and to repel an attack from that portion of the\r\nenemy's forces which were known to have been in that vicinity for many\r\nmonths. It was deemed possible that Stuart's cavalry might have crossed\r\nthe Blue Ridge, as had been apprehended, but there was no intention to\r\nabandon the position upon the approach of such an enemy. Indeed it was\r\nbelieved that, even if Stuart had entered the valley, his advance on\r\nWinchester would prove to be a mere feint to enable the main body of his\r\nforces to cross into Maryland.\r\n\r\nWinchester is not a place of any strategic importance; nor is it easily\r\nto be held against a greatly superior force. It is approachable on all\r\nsides by numerous roads, without any difficulty of intercommunication.\r\nBut there are some strong positions near the place susceptible of\r\nfortification; and several of these had been very skilfully improved by\r\nGeneral Milroy, during his occupation of the post--not with any view,\r\nhowever, of attempting to hold it, in case of an attack by overwhelming\r\nnumbers, but to resist any sudden concentration of the forces which were\r\nknown to be in the valley or likely to invade it. These fortifications\r\nwould have successfully resisted Stuart's cavalry, with all the field\r\nartillery he could have brought against them.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 13th of June, the enemy was encountered early in the\r\nday within a short distance of Winchester; but no enemy appeared in the\r\ndirection of the Strasburg road until the afternoon. Our forces held\r\nboth roads, but they gradually withdrew, skirmishing, during the day, as\r\nthe enemy steadily approached the town. At about 6 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, a prisoner was captured, who professed to belong to Hay's\r\nLouisiana brigade, of Ewell's rebel corps. From this prisoner was\r\nderived the information that both Ewell and Longstreet, with their\r\nentire forces, fifty thousand strong, were in the immediate vicinity of\r\nWinchester. This report was soon fully confirmed by a deserter, who\r\nshortly afterward entered our lines; and now, for the first time, it was\r\nrendered certain that the command at Winchester was in the immediate\r\npresence of an overwhelming force, probably the advance of Lee's entire\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nAt this time the 3d brigade, under Colonel McReynolds, was on the march\r\nfrom Berryville to Winchester, in pursuance of the signal, which had\r\nbeen given early in the morning. The direct road from Berryville to\r\nWinchester was only ten miles; but the appearance of the enemy at\r\nBerryville prevented Colonel McReynolds from taking that route. He\r\naccordingly pursued the Harper's Ferry road for a short distance, then\r\nturning to the left by a circuitous road through Summit Point to\r\nWinchester. His rear guard was attacked by the enemy's cavalry before\r\nleaving Berryville, and also again with greater violence at the Opequan\r\nCreek, between Summit Point and the Martinsburg road. The enemy was\r\nhandsomely repulsed in both instances, but particularly in the latter,\r\nwhen the cavalry, under Major A. W. Adams, and the artillery, commanded\r\nby Captain Alexander, were both brought into action. After a march of\r\nthirty miles, the 3d brigade reached the forts at Winchester about ten\r\no'clock at night.\r\n\r\nAfter it became known what force was in front of Winchester, early in\r\nthe night of Saturday, under cover of the darkness, the men were\r\nwithdrawn from the Front Royal and Strasburg roads, and posted in the\r\nsouthern part of the town, with orders to retire to the forts at two\r\no'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was now apparent that a very large force of the enemy had approached\r\nWinchester, and virtually surrounded it. The Berryville road, the direct\r\nroute to Harper's Ferry, was held by them. An attack had been made on\r\nour forces at Bunker Hill, on the Martinsburg road, during the day\r\n(Saturday), and some time in the evening the telegraphic line, which\r\ncommunicated by that road, was severed. Thus Winchester seemed to be\r\nentirely isolated and cut off from all its communications. Without any\r\nwarning whatever, the whole rebel army had eluded the Army of the\r\nPotomac, and had poured over the mountains like an avalanche into the\r\nShenandoah Valley. General Milroy did not, for a moment, suppose that\r\nthis movement could have taken place without the timely knowledge of the\r\nauthorities at Washington, and he very naturally supposed he had been\r\nleft unadvised and without orders, because of some movement of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, which would soon relieve him from his perilous position.\r\n\r\nGeneral Schenck was in expectation of early advice in case of any\r\nmovement of Lee's army into the valley. In his testimony he produced\r\nseveral telegrams to General Halleck inquiring for information on this\r\nsubject; but down to Sunday, the 14th, it seems there was no knowledge\r\nof Lee's movements in possession of the commander-in-chief of the army.\r\nOn Friday the 12th, General Schenck had telegraphed General Milroy in\r\nthese words: '_You will make all the required preparations for\r\nwithdrawing, but hold your position in the mean time. Be ready for\r\nmovement, but await further orders._' The additional orders had not been\r\nreceived. The telegraph had been in operation during the greater part of\r\nSaturday, while the enemy was gathering around the post; and when, that\r\nnight, the real situation became known, the most obvious conclusion\r\narising from the circumstances was, that General Schenck had ordered the\r\nplace to be held until further orders, for some important reason\r\nconnected with the wider plans of the General-in-chief of the army. The\r\ncutting of the telegraphic wire was the only circumstance which cast any\r\ndoubt upon this view. But in consultation with some of his officers on\r\nSaturday night, the commanding general, with their concurrence, adopted\r\nthe conclusion that his orders prohibited him from leaving Winchester at\r\nthat time, even if he could have done so with safety, which was more\r\nthan doubtful. He resolved, therefore, to await the events of Sunday,\r\nwhen the enemy would probably have massed his forces; and if relief\r\nshould not come during the day, it would then be more easy to determine\r\nin what manner and by what route it would be possible to escape. This\r\nconclusion was undoubtedly the wisest that could have been adopted. The\r\nmost critical military judgment will hardly succeed in finding any\r\nground of complaint against this decision in that serious emergency.\r\n\r\nSo passed the night of Saturday. On Sunday morning the contest was\r\nrenewed, and kept up with great energy during the whole day, chiefly\r\nwithin the suburbs of the town of Winchester. In the afternoon a sudden\r\nand unexpected attack was made upon an unfinished earthwork on Flint\r\nRidge, which, as it commanded the Pughtown and Romney roads, was\r\noccupied by Battery L of the 5th regular artillery, supported by the\r\n110th and part of the 116th Ohio volunteer infantry, all under command\r\nof Colonel Keifer, of the former regiment. A reconnaissance had been\r\npreviously ordered in that direction, and had been made or pretended to\r\nbe made by part of the 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the officer in charge\r\nof the party reporting that there was no enemy on either of those roads\r\nor between the two for a considerable distance from Winchester. Within\r\ntwo hours after this report was made, an overwhelming force appeared in\r\nthat very quarter. The enemy opened on the position with not less than\r\ntwenty guns, and precipitated upon it a column of at least ten thousand\r\nmen. After a gallant but ineffectual resistance, Colonel Keifer was\r\nenabled to make good his retreat, under cover of the guns from the main\r\nfort, which commanded the position. The guns of Battery L were most\r\neffectively served in this affair, and executed great slaughter in the\r\nranks of the enemy; but the horses having been nearly all killed, they\r\nwere necessarily spiked and abandoned.\r\n\r\nOur forces, pressed by the enemy on all sides, were now concentrated\r\nwithin the fortifications, and the rifle pits immediately in front of\r\nthem; and the contest was continued with artillery on both sides until\r\ndarkness compelled its cessation. In his report of this affair, General\r\nMilroy, with characteristic ardor at this juncture, says: 'To my regret,\r\nthe enemy made no effort to take my position by assault.' It was\r\nprobably about this time that the rebel General Ewell is reported with\r\nhis glass to have descried General Milroy in the lookout, which had been\r\nconstructed some distance up the flagstaff of the main fort, and to have\r\nexclaimed, 'There's that d--d old Milroy, who would stop and fight, if\r\nthe d--l himself was after him.'\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the loss of Battery L, which was wholly\r\nattributable to the imperfect reconnaissance or the false report of\r\nCaptain Morgan, who commanded the reconnoitring party, the advantage in\r\nthe fighting, both on Saturday and Sunday, had all been with our forces;\r\nand there can be little doubt that the enemy would have suffered\r\nseverely in any attempt to take the forts by assault.\r\n\r\nBut it was now apparent that the only alternatives were an evacuation or\r\na surrender. A council of war was ordered by the commanding general, and\r\nthe three brigade commanders, Brigadier-General Elliott, 1st brigade;\r\nColonel Ely, of the 18th Connecticut, 2d brigade; and Colonel\r\nMcReynolds, of the 1st New York Cavalry, 3d brigade, were called into\r\nconsultation. The critical condition of the command was perfectly\r\nunderstood. In pursuance of orders previously received, which looked to\r\nthe early evacuation of the place, most of the stores had been sent\r\naway. The communication with Martinsburg, from which supplies had been\r\nobtained always in a few hours, had been cut off; and it now appeared\r\nthat the stock of ammunition had been very nearly expended, and the men\r\nwere already on half rations. It was therefore resolved to retreat from\r\nthe forts at one o'clock in the morning (of Monday 15th June),\r\nabandoning everything except the horses, and such supply of ammunition\r\nas each man could take upon the march. There was some question as to the\r\nfeasibility of taking the field artillery; but as the enemy's pickets\r\nwere within two or three hundred yards of the rifle pits, and as the\r\nforts were located on a rocky ridge, which could not well have been\r\ndescended by the guns without arousing the enemy, it was finally\r\ndetermined to spike and leave them.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications had been constructed on the ridge, extending\r\nnorthwest from the town; and the guns in position commanded the\r\nMartinsburg road to the extent of their range. Probably on this account\r\nthe enemy had not made his appearance in that direction; and this road,\r\ntherefore, seemed to offer the only means of escape. The council of war\r\nresolved to march by this road to the point whence diverges a cross road\r\nto Summit Point, and thence by that place to Charlestown and Harper's\r\nFerry. The three brigades were directed to go out in the order of their\r\nnumbers, the 1st New York Cavalry, of the 3d brigade, being placed in\r\nthe extreme rear. Notwithstanding the great precautions taken to elude\r\nthe enemy immediately in front of the forts, the chief apprehension was\r\nthat these forces would follow and harass the column on its retreat.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock, on the morning of Monday, June 15th, with the most\r\nperfect silence, and in extreme darkness, the fortifications were\r\nevacuated, and the command of General Milroy commenced its march in the\r\norder and by the route designated. The bold and energetic resistance of\r\nthe day previous had led the enemy to expect a renewal of the contest on\r\nMonday morning. Hence he was completely deceived and eluded; and the\r\nhead of the retreating column had proceeded four and a half miles from\r\nWinchester, when suddenly, while it was yet quite dark, it encountered\r\nJohnson's division of Ewell's corps, eight or ten thousand strong,\r\nposted at the junction of the roads to Martinsburg and Summit Point. The\r\ncommanding general, expecting only an attack from behind, was near the\r\nrear when the firing began. He immediately hastened to the scene of\r\naction, and in riding up to the front, and passing Colonel McReynolds,\r\nsome distance ahead of his troops, ordered him to go back and hurry up\r\nhis brigade. The forces of the 1st and 2d brigades were at once thrown\r\ninto line of battle, the former on the left and parallel with the\r\nMartinsburg road, and the latter at right angles with the road, facing\r\nthe woods in which the enemy were posted. The first brigade, by a\r\ngallant charge, succeeded in driving the enemy from their guns; the\r\nsecond, led by General Milroy in person, was three times repulsed by\r\ngreatly superior numbers. Pending these successive charges, during which\r\nGeneral Milroy's horse was shot under him, he awaited the arrival of the\r\n3d brigade, and sent repeated messengers to order it up. His purpose was\r\nonly to engage the enemy long enough to enable the whole column to pass\r\naway under cover of the severe blow he had given the enemy in the first\r\ncharges of the two brigades engaged. But, unfortunately, the only part\r\nof the 3d brigade which could be found upon the field was the 1st New\r\nYork Cavalry, which had been drawn up in line of battle by Major Adams,\r\nwithout having received any orders from the brigade commander. The rest\r\nof the brigade had gone to the right in the early part of the conflict,\r\nand, with the exception of the 6th Maryland Volunteers, became\r\ndisorganized and scattered. Colonel McReynolds himself became separated\r\nfrom his troops, and reached Harper's Ferry alone, among the first who\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThus thwarted in his plans by the failure of the 3d brigade to respond\r\nto the orders given; the commanding general was compelled to continue\r\nthe retreat with only the regiments which were yet upon the field.\r\nGeneral Elliotts's forces, being in advance, mostly escaped. Colonel Ely\r\nhimself was captured with a considerable number of his men; and the\r\ndelay of the 3d brigade, giving the enemy the full advantage of his\r\nsuperiority in numbers, enabled him to cross the Martinsburg road in\r\npursuit, and cause the remaining part of the command to separate into\r\ntwo parts, one of which, under the commanding general, made its way to\r\nHarper's Ferry; and the other, pushed too far to the left, was compelled\r\nto retreat upon Hancock, and thence into Pennsylvania. The first of\r\nthese divisions pursued the Martinsburg road beyond the field of battle,\r\nand diverged thence through fields and by-roads to Harper's Ferry. The\r\n3d brigade, with the exception of the 1st New York Cavalry, left the\r\nMartinsburg road before reaching the position of the enemy, and, by\r\nmaking a detour back toward Winchester, effected its escape to\r\nCharlestown, not, however, without a considerable loss of men captured\r\nby the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained, from prisoners since taken by our army, that\r\nthe rebel force thus encountered at the junction of the Martinsburg and\r\nSummit Point roads, on the morning of the 15th June, had then just\r\nreached this position; and at the time when General Elliott drove the\r\nenemy from their guns, Johnson and his staff were nearly surrounded,\r\nbetween the 1st and 2d brigades of General Milroy's forces, and were in\r\nimminent danger of being captured. If the 3d brigade had taken part in\r\nthe action, in obedience to the orders given, doubtless this important\r\ncapture might have been made; and the retreat, which has been pronounced\r\na disastrous failure, would have been crowned with brilliant success.\r\nUpon such events, often hang the fortunes of men and armies!\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the derangement of plans, and the want of\r\ncoöperation in conducting this retreat, the result was by no means so\r\ndisastrous as has been generally supposed. Out of 6,900 effective men\r\nwho marched from Winchester, a little more than 6,000 escaped the enemy,\r\nand although scattered in different directions, were found to be on duty\r\nwhen recently the subject was investigated by order of Major-General\r\nSchenck.\r\n\r\nMost extravagant representations have been made as to the loss of stores\r\nand ammunition by this evacuation. But the inquiry has established that\r\na large part of the wagons had been previously sent away in safety, that\r\nvery few stores were on hand, and that the ammunition was nearly\r\nexhausted. The horses were all taken on the retreat, and notwithstanding\r\nsome confusion and disorder among the teamsters, were mostly saved to\r\nthe Government. The guns left in the fortifications, and the empty\r\nwagons, constituted the principal loss; and these, in comparison with\r\namounts of public property which during the war have been abandoned at\r\nmany other places, without comment or complaint, were truly\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nIn estimating this affair, it cannot be fairly characterized as either\r\ndisgraceful or particularly disastrous. The movements of Lee's army were\r\nwholly unknown in advance either to General Schenck, or to the\r\nGeneral-in-chief of the army. The little force at Winchester, without\r\nany warning, was called upon to encounter the advance of Lee's army in\r\noverwhelming numbers. Without at first knowing or suspecting the\r\ncharacter of the enemy, General Milroy held this gathering force at bay\r\nand in check for three days; and when finally surrounded and compelled\r\nto cut his way out, did so with a loss of less than one thousand of his\r\neffective men, of which number the killed and wounded were\r\ninconsiderable. It is known from our paroled officers, that during the\r\ninvestment and retreat, the enemy lost at least three hundred killed,\r\nand seven hundred wounded, while our casualties were not one fourth of\r\nthat number.\r\n\r\nLee's army having escaped the army of the Potomac, was on its way to\r\nPennsylvania. This check and delay of its onward march was important in\r\nits results. It was the first obstacle met by the invading host. It\r\nserved to reveal the movements and the concealed purpose of the enemy,\r\nand enabled our army to pursue and counteract his designs. Had there\r\nbeen no such obstacle, the rebel army would have swept on unopposed into\r\nMaryland, and would have had three, or at least two more days of\r\nunobstructed license to revel in the spoils he sought. He might have\r\nreached Harrisburg, if such was his intention; and, at all events, he\r\nwould have plundered and destroyed in a single day, far more than was\r\nlost at Winchester.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his testimony, General Schenck did not hesitate to say,\r\nthat if he had been left to his own judgment in the control of the\r\nforces within his department, he would have concentrated them all at\r\nWinchester, with the view to meet and check the contemplated advance of\r\nLee's rebel army, until the Army of the Potomac could have come forward\r\nto his relief. Undoubtedly this disposition of his command would have\r\nhad a controlling influence on the rebel campaign of last summer, in\r\nMaryland and Pennsylvania. The movements of both armies would have been\r\nmaterially changed, and the result must have been modified accordingly.\r\nThe invasion of the loyal States might have been altogether prevented,\r\nor it might have been rendered even more disastrous. Speculations of\r\nthis kind as to movements which could have been made, are not of much\r\nvalue, inasmuch as they cannot alter the irrevocable past. Military\r\noperations are subject to so many contingencies, that it is impossible\r\nto conjecture with any certainty what results might have followed a\r\ndifferent plan of campaign. Yet there could be no improvement in\r\nmilitary science, and no benefit from disastrous experience, unless the\r\nerrors of any particular movement may be pointed out and freely\r\ncriticized. If General Schenck's idea had been adopted, and preparation\r\nmade at Winchester to meet the advance of Lee's army, the movements of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac would have been conformed to that arrangement,\r\nwith coöperation between the scattered forces of the Middle Department\r\nand those under command of General Hooker. The campaign would have been\r\nin some measure under our control; whereas, in the actual circumstances,\r\nthe enemy passed without opposition, except at Winchester, into Maryland\r\nand Pennsylvania, and selected his own field of operations. It was most\r\nfortunate, though almost fortuitous, so far as our army was concerned,\r\nthat it had the good fortune to be posted as it was in the neighborhood\r\nof Gettysburg, with Cemetery Hill as the centre of our line. General\r\nMeade has all the credit and honor of having made the best disposition\r\nof his army, and carried it into the engagement with all the advantages\r\nof that magnificent position. But the selection of the battle ground was\r\nnot the result of any strategy on our part. Doubtless the enemy's\r\nignorance of the topography enabled Meade to occupy the favorable ground\r\nwhich gave him the great victory in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBoth Major-Generals Schenck and Milroy are volunteer officers, raised\r\nfrom civil life to their present high position. The former has\r\nheretofore been mostly known as a politician of the Whig school, long a\r\nmember of the national House of Representatives, and therein connected\r\nwith the navy rather than the army. He has again been returned to\r\nCongress by his district in Ohio, and it is understood that he will soon\r\nleave his position in the army, carrying his honorable wounds into\r\nanother field of service, where his usefulness to his country in this\r\ngreat crisis will not be diminished.\r\n\r\nGeneral Milroy has had the advantage of a military education, and has\r\nhad much of that experience and training which are necessary to make an\r\naccomplished soldier. He graduated at the University of Norwich,\r\nVermont--the same that sent from its academic halls the gallant and\r\nlamented General Lander, who died at an early period of the war.\r\nWhatever may be the character of that institution as a military school,\r\nunder the shadow of the great reputation of West Point, it has at least\r\nthe merit of having imparted to these two of its graduates an\r\nenthusiastic love for the profession of a soldier, and a perfect\r\nreadiness, in a good cause, to meet its privations and dangers. At the\r\ncommencement of the Mexican war, General Milroy raised a company in his\r\nnative State of Indiana, and commanded it in the field until the\r\nexpiration of its term of service. He was even more prompt in\r\npreparation for the present rebellion. Anticipating its occurrence, some\r\ntime before its commencement, he undertook the organization of a company\r\nat Rensselaer, Indiana; and, in spite of the ridicule of such an\r\nundertaking, he persevered, and presented his company, one of the first\r\nto respond to the President's earliest call for volunteers. Thus\r\nentering the service as a captain, he has rapidly risen through the\r\nintermediate grades to his present position. He is not yet forty-eight,\r\nthough his perfectly white hair would seem to indicate a greater age.\r\nBut his red beard and whiskers contrast strongly with the snow on his\r\nhead, and, together with a flashing bluish-gray eye, indicate the\r\nenergetic and ardent temperament of unconquerable youth. Though not\r\nlarge in person, he is tall and erect, with a fine, soldierly form. His\r\naddress is quick, and nervous to such a degree as to deprive him of even\r\nthe ordinary fluency of speech. His want of words to express the\r\nthoughts that evidently burn within him, together with a remarkable\r\ndiffidence among strangers, renders him incapable of making an\r\nimpression, at first, proportionate to his real merit. He has, however,\r\nalways enjoyed great popularity among his men, commanding their entire\r\nconfidence, and has never failed to endear himself to his intimate\r\ncompanions. His heart has been earnestly with the Union, in the work of\r\nits preservation, from the beginning of the war; and whatever may be the\r\ndisposition of the authorities toward him, his strong convictions and\r\nhis active temperament will hardly permit him to remain idle during the\r\ndeadly peril of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO SOUTHERN MOTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heard you not the din of battle,\r\n  Cannon's roar, and musket's rattle,\r\n  Clash of sword, and shriek of shell,\r\n  Victor's shot, and vanquished's yell?\r\n\r\n  Saw you not yon scene of slaughter,\r\n  Human blood poured out like water;\r\n  Northern valor, Southern pride,\r\n  Stern resolve on either side?\r\n\r\n  Cheering on his flagging men,\r\n  Rallying to the charge again,\r\n  Comes a bullet, charged with grief,\r\n  Strikes the brave Confederate chief.\r\n\r\n  Down he falls, amid the strife,\r\n  Horses trampling out his life:\r\n  Scarce can his retreating force\r\n  Find and save his mangled corpse.\r\n\r\n  Home they bore him to his mother--\r\n  He was all she had--none other:\r\n  Woful mother! who can borrow\r\n  Words to paint her frantic sorrow?\r\n\r\n  As she mourned her slaughtered brave,\r\n  Came and spake her aged slave,\r\n  Came, and spake with solemn brow:\r\n  'Missis, we is even, now.\r\n\r\n  'I had ten, and you had one;\r\n  Now we're even--all are gone:\r\n  Not one left to bury either--\r\n  Slave and mistress mourn together.\r\n\r\n  '_Every one of mine you sold_--\r\n  Now your own lies stark and cold:\r\n  To the just Avenger bow--\r\n  Missis! I forgive you _now_.'\r\n\r\n  Thus she spoke, that sable mother;\r\n  Shuddering, quailed and crouched the other.\r\n  Yea! although it tarry long,\r\n  PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR WRONG!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friday, _January 3d_.\r\n\r\nMy patience, or rather my impatience, has not been exposed to any very\r\nsevere trial: I have seen the prince royal twice. He recognized me; how\r\nchildish I was to doubt it? Why should I think him less skilful than\r\nmyself; and under what dress could I mistake him?\r\n\r\nOn New Year's day, just as I was writing in my journal, the palatine\r\ncame into my room, and said: 'Fanny, you have surpassed my expectations;\r\nyou have been perfect in everything; your dress, and still more your\r\nmanners, at the ball, have charmed every one; you have pleased\r\nuniversally, and even persons of the highest rank. I have just returned\r\nfrom court, where, with the senators and ministers, we presented our\r\nhomage to his royal majesty: his royal highness the Duke of Courland\r\ntook me aside to tell me that he had never seen anything comparable to\r\nyou. 'Were it not for the court etiquette,' added he, 'which forces me\r\nto pass the first day of the year with the king my father, I should go\r\nin person to present my congratulations to Mademoiselle Frances\r\nKrasinska.'\r\n\r\nWhen I heard these words spoken by the prince palatine, I thought my\r\nheart would burst within my bosom. The prince was kind enough to seem as\r\nif he had not noticed my confusion, and left me alone with my joy, my\r\ndelirium, my wild fancies.... I was not then mistaken: the prince royal\r\nwill come to see me. Yes; the prince palatine told me so; he has never\r\nseen anything comparable to me. This phrase haunts my memory like a\r\ndelicious strain of melody.\r\n\r\nDinner was soon after announced. I was gay--out of myself; the princess\r\nscolded me. After dinner we went out to make visits, and found no one at\r\nhome: everybody was out, offering the congratulations proper to the\r\nseason. Friends and acquaintances met in the street, and all said to one\r\nanother: 'I was just going,' or 'I have just been to see you.' The\r\ncarriages crossed and jostled one another in the streets, and a halt was\r\nordered whenever it was possible to recognize friends amid the crowd,\r\nwhen cards were reciprocally exchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen the night came, the footmen lighted the carriage lamps, and boys\r\nran before with torches; all these lights, vehicles, and liveries made\r\nup a charming spectacle--so gay and animated! There were a few\r\naccidents, but, God be praised, nothing happened to us. It was late when\r\nwe returned, and I was very tired: I soon fell asleep, but my sleep was\r\nno rest. I dreamed, I pondered, and I saw the future.... How many\r\nthings, how much weakness, and how much strength may exist in a woman's\r\nteeming brain!\r\n\r\nThe next day, precisely at twelve o'clock, after having made my toilet\r\nfor the day, I went to the reception room, where the princess was\r\nalready seated; I had just commenced to work at my embroidery, when a\r\nchamberlain entered hastily, and cried aloud: 'His royal highness the\r\nDuke of Courland.' The princess rose precipitately to receive him in the\r\nantechamber. At first I thought I would retire; but curiosity, or some\r\nfeeling, I know not what, overcame my fear, and I remained. He entered,\r\napproached my workstand, and asked after my health. Notwithstanding my\r\nembarrassment, I replied with considerable self-possession. He took a\r\nseat near my frame, and seemed interested in my work. I had so strong a\r\ndesire to appear calm that I succeeded in threading a fine needle with\r\nmy heavy silk; but God knows how I trembled....\r\n\r\nThe prince royal praised my skill, and found opportunities of saying\r\nmany kind and flattering things to me, although he spoke much more to\r\nthe princess than to myself; he remained about half an hour. I now know\r\nthat my dress did not change me in his eyes. As he left he told me he\r\nhoped to see me this evening at the ball given by the French ambassador,\r\nMarquis d'Argenson.\r\n\r\nAh! Barbara's wedding was nothing compared to the _fêtes_ in Warsaw:\r\nthere was as much luxury and magnificence, but the exquisite grace and\r\nchivalric courtesy here universal were wanting.\r\n\r\nThe country may try as it will, it is always a mere parody on the city:\r\nin the city, all are nearly alike; all are equally polished, and equally\r\namiable; no one is permitted to speak tiresome truths; the compliments\r\nare all ready made, and people only differ in their mode of speaking\r\nthem. From this general rule I must except the prince royal; his\r\nlanguage has another coloring, and his graceful speeches have an air of\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nBut he could not say much to me at the Marquis d'Argenson's ball. I was\r\nno longer a Virgin of the Sun, and etiquette is much more rigid at a\r\ndress ball than at a fancy ball; besides, all the women near us tried to\r\nhear what he was saying to me, which displeased me exceedingly; such\r\ncuriosity is disgusting in persons of high rank.\r\n\r\nThe princess is in an excellent humor; the prince royal danced only with\r\nher last evening; that is, she is the only lady advanced in years who\r\nhad that honor. The prince palatine is kinder than ever; he asks no\r\nquestions and offers me no advice. I am awaiting my sister's arrival\r\nwith the greatest impatience; how many things I will have to tell her!\r\n\r\nIt is not yet a week since I left school, and the time seems to me ages\r\nlong: so many events and such divers impressions crowd a lifetime into a\r\nfew days! New emotions have given birth to a new nature; my dreams as a\r\nyoung girl have been surpassed, or rather have become a serious reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sunday, _January 5th_.\r\n\r\nWould any one believe it? During the whole of yesterday I thought\r\nneither of balls, nor of fêtes, not even of the prince royal himself: my\r\nmind was exclusively filled with my sister. She came sooner than had\r\nbeen expected, and was taken ill immediately after her arrival. The\r\nprincess was sent for, and hastened to Barbara to remain all day. I\r\ndesired to accompany her, but was not permitted. Until midnight I was in\r\na horrible state of uneasiness; I sent to three churches to have masses\r\nsaid. Finally, at one o'clock, the princess returned; she told me that\r\nBarbara was doing well, and had given birth to a daughter. This morning\r\nI begged the princess to permit me to visit my sister, but she replied\r\nthat I could not do so, as it was not proper for a young girl to visit a\r\nlady in Barbara's situation. There was nothing to be said, and so I must\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nThe starost called here for a moment; he seemed very, very happy. They\r\nsay the little one is charming, red and white, and so plump; she is to\r\nbe called Angelica, to please our mother, who is so named. Oh! if I\r\ncould only see the dear child! I have all the honor of being an aunt,\r\nwithout any of the pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe prince royal sent to congratulate the princess upon the birth of the\r\nlittle girl, and he was kind enough to inquire after me by the same\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wednesday, _January 8th_.\r\n\r\nMy sister improves daily, but she does not yet leave her bed. I have\r\nseen the prince royal but once this week; he had gone hunting with the\r\nking; but yesterday he amply indemnified us by making us a visit of at\r\nleast an hour. How good he must be! how tenderly he loves his father!\r\nand when he spoke of his mother, his eyes were wet with tears. He seems\r\nexcellently well disposed toward the Poles; I do not think, so far as I\r\ncan judge, that a more noble and energetic soul could anywhere be found.\r\nAll that I had heard of him, all that I had written in my journal, is\r\nthe most exact truth. He is even far above all the praises bestowed upon\r\nhim; no one could describe the tone of his voice, his smile, or the\r\nexpression of his eye, so filled with deep and noble thought; I am not\r\nat all surprised at the empress's predilection for him. He has already\r\nsucceeded in winning the attachment of his people in Courland; he is\r\nseen once, and he pleases; again, and he is loved.... I believe that\r\nwere the king to die, he would be proclaimed king of Poland.\r\n\r\nAh, well! this prince, so much beloved, has distinguished me highly; I\r\ncan no longer doubt that I am pleasing to him; certain words have\r\nconfirmed the eloquence of his eyes.... Yes, indeed, I may be quite\r\nsure, since even the prince palatine himself has told me so.\r\n\r\nI believe that the princess takes a malicious pleasure in spoiling all\r\nmy happiness; she said to-day, at table, with quite an indifferent air,\r\nthat the prince royal had already been much pleased with many women, and\r\nthat, for him, the last was always the most beautiful.... How childish I\r\nam, to torment myself thus! Am I the only beauty in the world? The\r\nStarostine Wessel, Madame Potocka, and the Princess Sapieha are far more\r\nbeautiful than I, and then they understand how to add grace to their\r\nbeauty, while I am entirely devoid of the knowledge of any kind of art.\r\nYet, the prince royal assures me, that is my greatest charm.\r\nNevertheless, my color seems pale beside the brilliancy of those\r\nladies; their cheeks are rose tinted, and always rose tinted, while my\r\ncolor varies according to my emotions. Madame Potocka was charming at\r\nthe French ambassador's ball; the prince royal danced with her twice,\r\nand no one could avoid remarking her. But, in truth, what more can I\r\ndesire? My whole ambition was to see him, and to be noticed by him\r\nduring a few moments; my wishes have been gratified, and yet I long for\r\nmore, still more.... The heart has, then, infinite faculties for\r\nceaseless longing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sunday, _January 12th_.\r\n\r\nNow I ought to be completely happy. Last Thursday, at the Prince\r\nCzartoryski's ball, the prince royal danced with me alone. He came the\r\nday before to make us a visit, and yesterday, he sent his aid-de-camp to\r\ninvite us to a representation of the Italian opera Semiramide, which is\r\nto take place at the court.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time of the play, the prince paid attention to no one\r\nbut myself. I was presented to the king, who gave me a most gracious\r\nreception; he asked me for my parents, and especially for my mother. The\r\nstarost came to announce that the prince had concluded to stand\r\ngodfather to his daughter, and that he had chosen me for godmother.... I\r\nwill then hold the child at the baptismal font with the prince, and then\r\nI shall be of the same rank with himself. The will of God be done! The\r\nceremony will take place with great solemnity in the cathedral church of\r\nSt. John. Several other baptisms were to have taken place upon the same\r\nday, but they will be postponed through respect for the prince. The\r\nfirst society of Warsaw will be present at the ceremony; every one will\r\nspeak of it, and certainly the _Polish Courier_ will chronicle this\r\nimportant news. What will Madame Strumle and all the young ladies at the\r\nschool say? What will my parents, and all our court at Maleszow say?\r\nWhat will our little Matthias say?\r\n\r\nOh! that Matthias! How often I think of him! He is responsible for all\r\nmy torments, and all my uneasiness; without him, my reason would never\r\nhave abandoned me, nor would such wild hopes have sprung up within my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nScarcely one moment have I been able to rejoice over the approaching\r\nceremony; the princess has just told me that marriage is forbidden\r\nbetween persons who have stood together as godfather and godmother at a\r\nbaptism; I shuddered as I listened! Great God! what can all this mean? I\r\nno longer know myself. All within my soul is confusion and disorder: my\r\nown thoughts terrify me; I pass alternately from joy to sorrow;\r\ndelicious hopes smile upon me, and then I am overwhelmed by a strange\r\npresentiment of coming sorrow. I am in a state of continual agitation: I\r\ntremble, and long to quit the world, and then again feel drawn toward it\r\nby bonds so sweet and so strong....\r\n\r\nAt least I shall soon once more see my sister. That meeting will afford\r\nme a really happy moment; true consolation is to be found in sweet and\r\nconfiding affections. After the ceremony, we will go to my sister's; she\r\nis doing remarkably well; she sits up, but cannot yet leave her room.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wednesday, _January 15th_.\r\n\r\nThe baptism took place yesterday, and I saw my sister. How charming she\r\nis! She has grown paler and somewhat thinner. She is, as she always was,\r\ngood like an angel; and she is so happy! The prince royal quite insisted\r\nthat my name should be given to the little one, but Barbara would not\r\nagree to that; she said that we owed the preference to our mother's\r\nname. He has, however, obtained a promise from her that her second\r\ndaughter shall be named Frances.\r\n\r\nThe little one is lovely, but red as a crab; she cried during the whole\r\ntime of the ceremony: they say that is a good sign, and that she will\r\nprobably live to grow up. God grant it, for I love her already. I was\r\nso embarrassed, I had not the least idea how I ought to hold her in the\r\nchurch. My hands failed me; the prince royal aided me most kindly; how\r\ngood he is!\r\n\r\nI was as much surprised as pleased at finding myself standing before the\r\naltar at his side, in the presence of so numerous an assemblage, and at\r\nseeing my name inscribed on a great book with his: the prophecies of our\r\nlittle Matthias will doubtless receive no further fulfilment.\r\n\r\nEvery one congratulates me upon the honor I have had. The prince royal\r\nhas redoubled his kindness to me since the ceremony; his manner is more\r\nfamiliar; and he calls me now, 'My pretty gossip:' when he speaks of the\r\nchild, he says, 'our Angelica.' He has made the most magnificent\r\npresents to her ladyship the starostine and myself; his generosity\r\ntoward the poor and my sister's servants was truly regal.\r\n\r\nHe has promised the starost his interest with the king, to obtain for\r\nhim the castellanship of Radom. Alas for me! I can do nothing for my\r\nfamily; but I have embroidered a dress for Angelica which has cost both\r\ntime and labor; the prince royal told me he thought it in the best\r\ntaste. I will shortly embroider a cap for the dear little one.\r\n\r\nBut I am forgetting a piece of news of the greatest importance. Prince\r\nJerome Radziwill, the standard bearer of Lithuania, is preparing a grand\r\nhunt to amuse the king and the prince royal. He is expending the most\r\nenormous sums to surpass everything of the kind hitherto seen. He has\r\nfilled his park with all kinds of game, brought expressly from the\r\nforests of Lithuania. The hunt will begin to-morrow; the weather is\r\nfavorable; it is freezing hard, and the sledges will slide over the snow\r\nmost charmingly. The prince royal insists upon my being present at this\r\n_fête_. The four beauties of Warsaw will occupy the same sledge, driven\r\nby the prince royal himself. (I must here say that I am one of the four\r\nbeauties now in fashion.) We will all wear the same costume, differing\r\nonly in color. I have chosen crimson; Madame Potocka, blue; Madame\r\nSapieha, green; and Miss Wessel, orange. Our velvet dresses will be\r\ntrimmed with sable, and our caps will be made of the same material. I am\r\nsorry Barbara cannot see it all; but she has her Angelica, and that is a\r\nhappiness worth all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friday, _January 17th_.\r\n\r\nI was brought up in a castle with a brilliant court, and I have seen the\r\nroyal fêtes at Warsaw; but I never beheld anything comparable to the\r\nPrince Radziwill's hunt. We set out at nine in the morning, amid an\r\ninnumerable quantity of sledges and horses; our equipage was the most\r\nsplendid, and followed next after the king's. The prince wore a hunting\r\ndress of green velvet. I do not know whether it was his costume which\r\nrendered his appearance so striking, or his bearing which threw such a\r\ncharm about his dress; of one thing, however, I am sure, and that is,\r\nthat I never saw him look so well.\r\n\r\nWe first went a considerable distance beyond the church of the Holy\r\nCross; then we flew down the side of the hill on which Warsaw is built.\r\nIn the centre of the plain, near Szulec and Uiazdow (now Lazienki),\r\nPrince Radziwill has had a park made and an iron pavilion built. The\r\nsituation is admirable; the building is open upon all sides, and\r\ndefended against the wild beasts by bristling points of sharpened iron.\r\nAll the furniture is covered with green velvet. The king and the prince\r\nroyal took their places within the pavilion, while the guests occupied a\r\nlofty amphitheatre raised without; the little hills to the right and\r\nleft were crowded with curious spectators. At some distance from the\r\npavilion began long avenues, bordered with fine trees.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all had arrived, and had taken their destined places, the\r\nhunting horns were sounded. The prince's huntsmen let loose eight elks,\r\nthree bears, twenty-five wolves, and twenty-three wild boars; dogs\r\ntrained for the purpose drove the animals toward the king's pavilion.\r\nThe shouts of the huntsmen and the howlings of the animals were\r\ndeafening. The king killed three boars with his own hands; the prince\r\nroyal killed at least twenty of the creatures, and, not yet content, he\r\nfought a bear with a club, a proof of great strength and skill. I am to\r\nhave the bear's skin, the main trophy of the prince's hunt, as a carpet.\r\nThese amusements lasted until four in the afternoon; we then had a\r\ncollation. We counted eighty-four huntsmen and foresters belonging to\r\nPrince Radziwill; they were all richly dressed. Latin and Polish verses\r\nwere distributed among the guests. Everything was charming. Prince\r\nRadziwill desired thus to commemorate the anniversary of the king's\r\ncoronation. There will also be a grand ball this evening at Marshal\r\nBielinski's, to celebrate the same event.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sunday, _January 19th_.\r\n\r\nThe ball was superb. The prince royal was charmingly gay; the king had\r\ngiven him a star set with diamonds. The supper was splendid, exquisite;\r\nand the enforced abstinence of Friday by no means diminished the luxury\r\nand abundance; there were an infinity of dishes, but not a particle of\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nI danced a great deal, and have pains in my feet which cause me much\r\nsuffering; but I am sorry that I complained, for I shall now be obliged\r\nto keep my room for ten days to rest. The princess is quite uneasy about\r\nmy health. She fears lest so many balls and such late hours should be\r\ninjurious to me. In truth, I do not think my cheeks are as rosy as they\r\nwere a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nWe have received letters from Maleszow; my mother was kind enough to\r\nwrite to me herself. She begs me to take good care of myself, and, above\r\nall, to act prudently, and beware of heeding vain flatteries. She says:\r\n'Do not become vain or proud through the praises bestowed upon you.\r\nCaprice has more influence upon the world's judgment than either beauty\r\nor merit. If reason is lulled to sleep through the power of such\r\ndeceitful murmurs, the happiness of a whole life is in danger, and one\r\nmay suddenly fall from a great height, with all one's weight, upon the\r\nearth.'\r\n\r\nI hope my good mother's fears will never be realized, and, if my desires\r\nhave been too lofty and ambitious, I will in future endeavor to chain\r\nthem in the depths of my soul. My mother's letter caused me many tears;\r\nI carry it with me wherever I go, and read it often. God has endowed the\r\nwords of parents with the power of going directly to their children's\r\nhearts. Happy the young girl who has never left her father's house!\r\nNotwithstanding all my triumphs, I often regret our castle at Maleszow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WARSAW, Wednesday, _January 29th_.\r\n\r\nMy quarantine is finally ended, but I am sorry to say there have been\r\nfour balls during my seclusion. I particularly regret a masked ball,\r\nwhere I was to have made one in a Scotch quadrille with the three\r\ncelebrated beauties. Miss Malachowska took my place, and I was forced to\r\nremain alone, notwithstanding the entreaties of the prince royal and of\r\nmany others; but when the princess once says no, there is no use in\r\nattempting to induce her to change her mind, I confess I was really\r\nvexed, but it would have been very ungracious to have let it be\r\nperceived; at my age, one should be reasonable; besides, I ought not to\r\nregret anything, for the prince royal has often been to see me, and has\r\ntold me that he approved my resignation and the strength of my\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSince the baptism, the distance separating the prince royal, heir\r\napparent to the throne, from the Starostine Frances Krasinska, has been\r\ngradually decreasing; the prince royal desires me to treat him as my\r\nequal: what precious and inconceivable goodness! The hours he passes\r\nwith us are the most delightful that can be imagined; he talks of his\r\njourneys to St. Petersburg, to Vienna, to Courland, and amid the society\r\nsurrounding us, he even finds opportunities to say words to me which I\r\nalone can comprehend. The prince royal knows and appreciates all the\r\nintrigues which are mining our unfortunate republic, but, through\r\nrespect for his father, he dare not say what he thinks. Great God! If he\r\nshould one day be king!\r\n\r\nThe princess, who eagerly seeks a bad side to the best things, says that\r\nhis politeness has no other aim than to make a party for himself, and\r\nwhen he is master of the crown, he will forget or despise us. I do not\r\nbelieve this, and repel such a suspicion as the deepest injustice. The\r\nprincess would be very glad to see Lubomirski on the throne, but I doubt\r\nexceedingly the possibility of such an event.\r\n\r\nThe sisters canonesses have a soirée this evening, to which I am\r\ninvited. The superior, Miss Komorowska, is a very respectable personage.\r\nMadame Zamoyska, born Zahorowska, was the foundress of this community:\r\nshe copied it from that existing at Remiremont, in Lorraine. It serves\r\nas an asylum for young ladies who will not or who cannot marry; they\r\nlive there in retirement, but still receive visits. Madame Zamoyska\r\nbought the Marieville, in one of the main streets, on purpose to\r\nestablish this community of canonesses. Twelve ladies of the highest\r\nrank are received there, but eight young girls belonging to the lesser\r\nnobility are also admitted.\r\n\r\nThe last days of the carnival are finally at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ash Wednesday, _February 16th_.\r\n\r\nAfter such constant and fatiguing excitement, one grows tired of\r\npleasure and longs for rest. I am almost glad when I think the carnival\r\nis over. During the past three weeks I have led a purely external life,\r\nabsorbed in balls, dress, and visits. One must have tried this mode of\r\nlife to know how sad and tiresome it really is. My success, my\r\nhappiness, are envied by others, while I long only for solitude, only\r\nfor a few quiet moments, in which I may enjoy my own thoughts and\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nBarbara seems to comprehend my sufferings. I see her often, and certain\r\nwords which occasionally fall from her lips explain her fears for me.\r\nShe sees before me a destiny by no means in harmony with my tastes,\r\nrequirements, and faculties; she would wish for me a future such as her\r\nheart and her reason have made for her; she understands life, and has\r\nset me to dreaming of another happiness.... I begin to reflect.... But\r\nhow beautiful Madame Potocka looked at the masked ball yesterday\r\nevening! Her dress as a sultana became her astonishingly. Her beauty\r\nshone as a sun above that of all other women; every one admired her, and\r\nall coveted the honor of dancing with her. As for me, I could only dance\r\none Polonaise; I was attacked by so severe a pain in my foot that I\r\ncould not leave my seat, and I was forced to decline the invitations of\r\nthe prince royal and of several noblemen. Thank heaven, the carnival is\r\nover!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Saturday, _February 29th_.\r\n\r\nI am going to Sulgostow when I least expected to make such a journey,\r\nand must first write a few hasty lines. The starost and my sister called\r\nyesterday to say farewell. The prince palatine came to my room this\r\nmorning, and told me my brother and sister were very anxious I should\r\naccompany them home. 'It is very probable,' he added, 'that your father\r\nand mother will soon join you there.' I always yield implicit obedience\r\nto the will of the palatine, and made no resistance in this case: I will\r\ngo. The princess approves highly of my resolution. I will go, since they\r\ndesire it; and yet the prince royal is ignorant of my approaching\r\ndeparture, and there is no one whom I could ask to inform him of it: he\r\nwill hear it as one of the ordinary items of every-day news.\r\n\r\nIf I dared I would ask the princess to say farewell for me, and present\r\nmy regrets to him; but I should never have the courage to confide in\r\nher--and, besides, will my departure cause him any pain? Will a single\r\nthought, a single remembrance follow me, when there are so many\r\nbeautiful women in Warsaw?... Madame Potocka will still be here.... But\r\nI am called, and must hasten my preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sunday, _March 15th_.\r\n\r\nI returned to Warsaw two days ago. I do not know how it was, but I\r\nforgot my journal, and was forced to abstain from the consolation of\r\nwriting during my absence.\r\n\r\nI remained three weeks at Sulgostow. I tell it to my shame, but the time\r\nweighed upon my soul as a lengthened torture. I did not see my parents,\r\nas they are not expected there for four days yet, and the prince\r\npalatine came for me in such haste that we made the journey in one day;\r\nfresh horses awaited us at each stopping place, so that we did not lose\r\na single moment.\r\n\r\nThe prince royal came to see us the day after our arrival. He is much\r\nchanged; he seems sad or suffering. He gave me to understand that my\r\ndeparture had given him great pain, and he said with some bitterness,\r\nthat one should have some consideration for a friend.... A friend! this\r\nheartfelt word fell from his lips. Oh! how remorseful I felt for having\r\nmade this journey! And yet I made it against my own will.\r\n\r\nThe prince palatine maintains that all is for the best. I must confess I\r\ncan see no reason for making me suffer, and for afflicting the prince\r\nroyal; but I have made a promise to myself to obey the palatine blindly;\r\nI believe him to be destined to play a large part in all the events of\r\nmy life. The princess received me most kindly upon my return.\r\n\r\nI have embroidered a cushion for the cathedral, with I.H.S. upon it. I\r\nfound all that was needful for my work at Sulgostow, and I was so\r\ndiligent that I finished it before my departure. I worked fervently, for\r\nI was accomplishing a secret vow; God alone knows my intention, God\r\nalone can grant my prayers.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of Barbara's marriage was celebrated with great pomp at\r\nSulgostow. How many changes in the space of a year! Before Barbara's\r\nmarriage, I was always gay and always happy; that is to say, always\r\ncalm. I enjoyed my insignificant liberty; my life was like a cloudless\r\nsky; I experienced none of those moments of bliss which are yet a real\r\nsuffering, nor of those hours of torment possessing so strange a charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thursday, _March 19th_.\r\n\r\nThe prince royal was as gay and amiable yesterday as during the first\r\ndays of our acquaintance. He came in the morning and passed an hour with\r\nus; he could not remain longer, as he was obliged to accompany his\r\nfather on a hunting party to the forest of Kapinos: but he returned in\r\nthe evening when we least expected him; he came quietly, without any\r\nescort, and with an absence of ceremony, and an air of mystery which\r\nadded to the charm of his presence.\r\n\r\nThe chase was successful, and quite a singular event took place. The\r\nforest of Kapinos borders upon that of Zaborow; the proprietor of the\r\nlast-mentioned domain is said to be a gentleman of good family; he gave\r\nthe king a splendid reception when his majesty passed through his lands,\r\nand the king promised the gentleman a starosty, as a recompense for his\r\nfidelity, on condition that he would first permit him to kill a bear\r\nupon his territory. Several bears were killed, but the starosty seemed\r\nforgotten; the poor gentleman, always hoping and always disappointed,\r\nkilled a bear himself at the last hunt. He dragged it to the king's\r\nfeet, and said to him, 'Sire, ursus est, privilegium non est.'\r\n\r\nThe king laughed heartily at this sally, and promised him solemnly that\r\nhe should have the promised starosty.\r\n\r\nThe prince royal remained two hours with us: he is now freer, and can\r\nleave his father more easily, because his brothers, Albert and Clement,\r\nare in Warsaw. Every one says that Prince Clement is very good and very\r\npious; he has a decided vocation for the ecclesiastical state, and it is\r\npresumed he will take orders. It is a proof of great wisdom on the\r\nking's part to consecrate one of his sons to God; but it is fortunate\r\nthe choice did not fall upon Prince Charles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tuesday, _March, 24th_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding it is Lent, my days pass quite gayly. The prince royal\r\ncomes often to see us; he repeats unceasingly that the court etiquette\r\nweighs upon him; he is glad to be free from it: but to-morrow I am again\r\nto be separated from him. The princess is in the habit of making a\r\nretreat of a week before Easter, in order to prepare for her confession;\r\nall religious ladies do the same, and I must of course accompany the\r\nprincess to the convent of the Holy Sacrament.\r\n\r\nDuring a whole week we will see none but priests, we will read only\r\nbooks of prayer, and work only for the church or for the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Holy Thursday, _April 2d_.\r\n\r\nI have made my confession, and am now prepared to receive the holy\r\ncommunion. I never remember to have been so calm, or to have felt so\r\nmuch quiet in my soul. It is an inestimable blessing to be at peace with\r\nGod and with one's self. How solemn and how sweet are the ceremonies of\r\nour holy religion! What a happiness to have been brought up in the\r\nknowledge of its mysteries! I have an excellent confessor, the Abbé\r\nBaudoin; he is very popular among the ladies of the court, because he is\r\na Frenchman. But, popularity aside, he would still be the confessor of\r\nmy choice; he is a worthy and a holy man, possessing all the virtues\r\ntaught by Christ; one follows his counsels with respect; his views of\r\nreligion console and show one the way to heaven without forcing one\r\nentirely to quit the earth. I passed several hours with him, and he knew\r\nhow to reach my heart, even while condemning my faults. He caused me to\r\nfeel humiliated for my sins, without crushing me, or driving me to\r\ndespair; he showed me the futility of all human things, the sadness and\r\nemptiness of all pleasures arising from vanity and self-love.... Indeed,\r\nduring a few moments, I thought seriously of consecrating my life\r\nentirely to God, and of becoming a gray nun in the convent under the\r\nAbbé Baudoin's direction.\r\n\r\nI was measuring my cell, and counting the number of steps I could take\r\nin my new asylum; I thought my resolution nearly taken, when my maid\r\nentered and began to tell me some trifle concerning the prince royal's\r\nhuntsman!... The chain of my holy thoughts was immediately broken, and I\r\nstrove in vain to relink it; I could remember but one point, and that\r\nwas, that the Abbé Baudoin had told me it was possible to secure one's\r\nsalvation even while living in the great world, and that this difficult\r\nstruggle, when brought to a victorious conclusion, was as pleasing to\r\nGod as that virtue which had never dared the combat.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, should I throw myself into a world of sacrifices, whose\r\nextent is unknown to me, and perhaps beyond my strength? I will follow\r\nmy destiny, while maintaining the purity of my conscience. Yes, I swear\r\nnever to commit any action unworthy of the name of Krasinski. If I sin,\r\nalas! it is through too much pride; my desires are placed very high; the\r\nAbbé Baudoin does not blame me; he says that ambition is criminal only\r\nwhen it leads us from the path of virtue.... What God requires, is a\r\nheart prepared for every sacrifice--a will ready to yield all for His\r\nsake; and I feel that I possess this disposition; I experience an\r\nindefinable quietude, and my soul is comforted. This week has seemed to\r\nme a foretaste of heaven; I have seen no one but the nuns and my\r\nconfessor, the sole confidant of my thoughts and feelings, and the time\r\nhas passed rapidly and without tedium. To-day I am once more to find\r\nmyself in the great world. I am to witness the ceremonies of Holy\r\nThursday in the castle. I am very curious to see this religious\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Low the leaves lie in the forest; on the damp earth, brown and chill,\r\n  Gather near the evening shadows. Hark! the wind is sorrowing still.\r\n    Vanished are the pine-crowned mountains, hidden in a dusky cloud;\r\n  See the rain, it falleth ever from the wan and dreary sky:\r\n  Rusheth on the swollen streamlet, wildly whirling, foaming by;\r\n    And the branches, leafless waving, in the Fall wind low are bowed.\r\n\r\n  See, the golden-rod no longer bends its yellow-plumèd head,\r\n  By the roadside lies it faded--'mid the grasses--pale and dead;\r\n    While alone the stately mullein rears its brown and withered crest.\r\n  Quiet skies of early Autumn mirrors now the lake no more,\r\n  But its waters struggle fiercely, laden storm-clouds flying o'er,\r\n    And the rain it falleth ever, and the wind will never rest.\r\n\r\n  Once the hills were clad in scarlet: vanished all their beauty now;\r\n  Perished now the crown of glory that encircled then their brow;\r\n    Low the crimson leaves are lying, and the withered boughs are chill;\r\n  Faded are the purple daisies, and the little pool looks sad,\r\n  Missing now the gentle flowers that once made it bright and glad;\r\n    For the rain it falleth ever, and the wind is never still.\r\n\r\n  Closer fall the gloomy shadows, and the forests drearier seem,\r\n  Still the leaden clouds are flying, rusheth wilder yet the stream;\r\n    And the reckless wind is telling now a wild and fearful tale,\r\n  While the trees all listen trembling, and the mullein bows its head,\r\n  And the dusky lake grows angrier, and the dark pool mourns its dead;\r\n    For the rain it falleth ever, and the winds but louder wail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSIZES OF JERUSALEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is in the Royal Library at Munich a room called the Cimelian Hall,\r\nin which the manuscripts and works with binding richly ornamented in\r\ngold and precious stones are kept. Many a visitor to this hall has felt\r\ndeep interest as his eyes have rested upon an open manuscript, to be\r\nseen through the glass doors of its case, written with inverted strokes\r\nand adorned with various colored initial letters. The interest has risen\r\non learning that this contains the 'Assizes of Jerusalem,' of which\r\nthere are but few manuscripts in existence--one at Venice and several at\r\nParis. This work is in the old French language, and the frequent\r\nrecurrence on the open page of such words as _jurés_, _larcin_, _vol_,\r\n_meurtre_,[1] in connection with the word '_assises_,' leads the visitor\r\nto suppose that this may be a judicial report of remarkable criminal\r\ncases--a kind of 'Pitaval.'[2]\r\n\r\nBut these yellow leaves contain one of the most important documents\r\nconnected with the history of civilization which the night of the middle\r\nages has given us: it is indeed an invaluable inheritance from that\r\nperiod--nothing less than the laws of the kingdom of Jerusalem, as\r\nfounded by the Crusaders at the end of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Jerusalem! At the very mention of the name, there seems\r\nto pass over us a breeze from that charmed time when Christendom,\r\ninspired by its faith with heroic zeal, went forth to rescue from insult\r\nand ignominy the tomb of the Redeemer. Who does not feel a kind of\r\nlonging after that romantic splendor of the Orient, which impelled the\r\npeople of Europe to leave homes and families upon this great enterprise\r\nbeyond the sea? Who does not gladly lose himself in contemplating the\r\ntraditions of life and deeds, contests and poesy of those chivalrous\r\ntimes, and dream over again a short portion of that brief but beautiful\r\ndream of the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem?\r\n\r\nNor is it merely this feeling of romance which binds us to the law book\r\nof the Crusaders. It has important political and judicial significance.\r\nIn the kingdom of Godfrey of Boulogne lived mixed up together, formed\r\ninto a kind of variegated checkerwork, people of all lands and languages\r\nof the Occident--French, Italians, Spanish, English, and Germans. The\r\nsystem of law which united this mixed multitude was indeed the German,\r\nat least in its fundamental and leading forms and features, as this was\r\nbefore the time when the flourishing of the law school at Bologna had\r\nbrought again everywhere into use the Roman law. There is, however, a\r\nperceptible influence of the Roman law in this work, and indeed an\r\noccasional reference to it as an authority. It has, therefore, its\r\nimportance to jurists, but its general interest is deeper, disclosing,\r\nas it does, a view of a distant age, and of a land long since covered\r\nwith the charm and glory of song.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript is in the old French tongue, was evidently written by an\r\nItalian hand in the latter part of the fourteenth century, and bears the\r\ntitle: '_Livres des assises et bons usages dou réaume de Jerusalem._'\r\n\r\n'Assize,' primarily means an assembly of several wise men in the court\r\nof a prince for the making of laws; but it comes thence to mean that\r\nwhich they have determined upon as law, and is so used in the judiciary\r\nof the Christian Orient.\r\n\r\nWe shall see that the Munich manuscript does not fully make good its\r\nname. It is not in the proper sense a law book, but rather notes in\r\nregard to the judiciary of the kingdom, made by authors of unknown\r\nnames. There are internal evidences that the original compilation must\r\nhave taken place from 1170 to 1180 of the Christian era, that is, before\r\nthe recapture of Jerusalem, and is therefore from the best of sources.\r\nIt contains, however, but a single department of the judiciary system of\r\nJerusalem, and the deficiency must be supplied from the Venetian\r\nmanuscript. Still, however, there remains little to desire in regard to\r\nthe completeness of the sources from which we learn the contents of\r\nthese books of 'Assizes.'\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a notice of the law book of the Crusaders, it is\r\nnecessary to premise a brief statement of the political condition upon\r\nwhich this system of law was based, since it is only by knowing this\r\nthat we can understand the laws.\r\n\r\nWhen the Christian kingdom of Asia was in its bloom, it consisted of\r\nfour provinces, viz.: 1, the principality of Antioch; 2, the duchy of\r\nEdessa; 3, the principality of Syria or Jerusalem; and 4, the duchy of\r\nTripolis. These four formed the kingdom of Jerusalem, of which they were\r\nfeudal dependencies. The principality of Jerusalem was the home domain\r\nof the king of Jerusalem, as Hugh Capet, for instance, was duke of\r\nFrance and king in France.\r\n\r\nThe kings of Jerusalem, like those of France, surrounded themselves with\r\nfour crown officers, viz.: the seneschal, constable, marshal, and\r\nchamberlain, whose authority and influence were the same as those of the\r\nname in Europe.\r\n\r\nEach of the above-named divisions was again subdivided into baronies and\r\ngreater fiefs, the holders of which were called 'men of the kingdom.'\r\nThe lower vassals were designated by the name of 'liegemen.' Among them\r\nwere, however, included the immediate servants of the king, ranking with\r\nthe class from which higher officials are taken in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe king executed justice in a court constituted of peers, and called\r\nthe high court,[3] and the laws which governed its decisions were called\r\n'assizes of the high court.'[4]\r\n\r\nThose barons who held courts and administered justice to their vassals\r\nscattered over the land, of which there were twenty-two in the\r\nprincipality of Syria, based their decisions also upon these assizes;\r\nthey did not, however, sit in their own right as patrimonial judges, but\r\nby royal concession, and the king could at any time he chose preside\r\nover these courts, associating with himself any number of his liegemen\r\nto sit with him.\r\n\r\nBesides these noble vassals, called also the 'chivalry of the\r\nkingdom,'[5] there was a very considerable Latin population who held no\r\nfiefs, but still were perfectly free men, and were designated as\r\ncitizens.[6] We find in our work no statement of their political\r\nrelations; we only know that they had their own law, and that in the\r\nissue of the ordinances for the government of their towns or cities,\r\nthey had a right to participate, and were obliged, in case of need in\r\nthe land of Jerusalem, to furnish, as were also the clergy, a certain\r\nquota of foot soldiers.\r\n\r\nTo this Latin population justice was administered by a court of sworn\r\nburghers, presided over in Jerusalem itself by the viscount of the\r\nkingdom, and elsewhere by the viscounts or bailiffs of the several\r\ncities. Of these courts there were thirty-seven in the principality of\r\nJerusalem. This was called the lower court, or court of the burghers,\r\nand the laws which formed its rule of judgment, 'the assizes of the\r\nburghers' court.'\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the two above-named courts did not, however, extend\r\nover all subjects, since that of the clerical courts embraced matters\r\npertaining to the laity, which are now no longer regarded as\r\necclesiastical: for instance, the case of husband and wife treating each\r\nother with mutual blows; for it would seem that these connubial feuds\r\nwere not quite prevented, either by the gallantry of this time of\r\nchivalry, or by the feeling which had animated the rushing crowds when\r\nthey left Europe for the Orient, that they were going to a land elevated\r\nabove the range of terrene sins and troubles--perhaps to that they had\r\nheard called heaven.\r\n\r\nIn the seaports, the Italians and people of Marseilles enjoyed the right\r\nof being tried by judges of their own, and in accordance with the usages\r\nof their own countries; and as if to make this checkerwork quite\r\ncomplete, the Syrian Christians were allowed trial before the rajis or\r\npresidents of their several towns. In this latter respect a change was\r\nintroduced somewhat gradually, which was quite remarkable in view of the\r\nprevalent ideas of the times. Feudalism had tended to concentrate the\r\npower as much as possible in the same hands, without regard to the\r\ndifference of matter in question--that is, to divide labor by quantity,\r\nand not by quality. But here we find for the first time a division of\r\njurisdiction according to the _matter_, and in the later period of the\r\nkingdom, marine and commercial courts were established. The former,\r\ncalled 'courts of the chain'[7] (from the chain by which the entrance to\r\nthe harbor was closed), gave judgment in questions of freight or payment\r\nof sailors' wages, or in any questions which might arise between the\r\nship-owners and captains. The commercial court,[8] which, in addition to\r\nits own special functions, took the place of the properly Syrian courts,\r\nwas constituted of four Syrian and two Frankish judges, under the\r\npresidency of a Frank. This was an important measure, and indicated\r\ngreat progress in international commercial intercourse, since in other\r\nmatters the various nationalities of the kingdom were so strictly\r\ndistinguished that the Syrian could not be witness against the Greek, or\r\nthe Frank against the Armenian, or the Jacobite against the Nestorian,\r\netc. In commerce and trade, the assizes held not so strictly in relation\r\nto religion and national descent; for whether Syrian or Greek, Jew or\r\nSamaritan, Nestorian or Saracen, they were still men, as well as the\r\nFranks, and must pay or serve according to judgment rendered, just as in\r\nthe burghers' court, and hence it was determined that the court of\r\ncommerce should apply the assizes of the burghers' court.\r\n\r\nThe above is given as the basis upon which the legislation of the\r\nkingdom rested, and now we may best hear the assizes themselves in\r\nregard to the beginnings of this legislation. In the first chapter of\r\nthe assizes of the high court, as given us by John of Ibelin, we have\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     'When the holy city of Jerusalem was won from the enemies of the\r\n     cross, and restored to the true men of the Saviour, * * * when the\r\n     princes and barons who conquered it had chosen, as king and lord of\r\n     the kingdom of Jerusalem, Godfrey of Boulogne, * * * who was a man\r\n     of understanding, and anxious to place the said kingdom in a good\r\n     condition, and to have his people and all others who should come\r\n     and go and dwell in the kingdom, guided, kept, ruled, sustained,\r\n     held together, and judged according to justice and reason, he\r\n     chose, upon the advice of the patriarch of the holy city and church\r\n     of Jerusalem, and that of the princes, barons, and wisest men he\r\n     could find, prudent men, whose business it should be to inquire and\r\n     know from the people of various lands there present, what were the\r\n     customs of their respective countries. All that these men could\r\n     ascertain they wrote, or caused to be written, and laid before Duke\r\n     Godfrey, who assembled the patriarch and the other people\r\n     mentioned above, showed them the result, and caused the papers to\r\n     be read to them. With their counsel and acquiescence he took from\r\n     the report what seemed to him good, and made out from the same\r\n     assizes and customs, which should be held, applied, and observed in\r\n     the kingdom of Jerusalem.'\r\n\r\nOur author further tells us that both Godfrey himself and the later\r\nkings, in their diets of the kingdom, extended and improved these laws.\r\nThe diets were generally held at Acre, at the season of the arrival of\r\nthe pilgrims from Europe, as this gave opportunity to ascertain what was\r\nthe law of their several homes in relation to the matter in question;\r\nand it is even said that messengers were sent over the sea expressly for\r\nthis purpose. William of Tyre, the celebrated chronicler of the time,\r\nhas preserved to us an interesting case of this special legislation. He\r\nsays that after the conquest of the holy city, and return home of most\r\nof the pilgrims, the danger from the Saracens having become imminent,\r\nmany of the newly invested feudal tenants began to desert their fiefs,\r\nupon which Godfrey issued the following assize:\r\n\r\n     'Whoever shall hold such deserted fief in possession for one year,\r\n     shall be considered as having gained it by prescriptive right, and\r\n     shall be defended in its possession against the previous owner who\r\n     has deserted it.'\r\n\r\nThe same William of Tyre tells us of a diet held at Neapolis in Samaria,\r\nin the year 1120, 'at which, in order to banish from the land the\r\nimmoralities and crying abuses which had crept into it, there were\r\nissued comprehensive regulations, embraced in twenty-five chapters; and\r\nit seems from the form of the oath of the later kings that Amalrick I\r\nand his son Baldwin IV had undertaken a formal revision of the\r\nlegislation.' It is therefore probable that we retain very little of the\r\nsystem established _immediately_ upon the conquest. If we had no\r\nevidence of revisions and changes, the sad and unquiet times through\r\nwhich Godfrey had to pass would fully justify this conjecture.\r\n\r\nBut let us hear what tradition says in regard to the external condition\r\nof these laws:\r\n\r\n     'These assizes (vide chap. iv) were written each by itself in large\r\n     Gothic letters. The first letter at the beginning was illuminated\r\n     with gold, and all the rubrics and titles were written separately\r\n     in red, as well all the other assizes as those of the higher and\r\n     those of the burghers' court. Each sheet had the signature and seal\r\n     of the king, the patriarch, and the viscount of Jerusalem, and\r\n     these sheets were called 'Letters of the Sepulchre,'[9] because\r\n     they were kept in a great chest in the Holy Sepulchre. Whenever a\r\n     question arose in court in regard to an assize, making it necessary\r\n     to consult these writings, the chest was opened in the presence of\r\n     nine persons. The king must either be there personally or be\r\n     represented by a crown official, and then two vassals of the king,\r\n     the patriarch of Jerusalem, or in his place the prior of the Holy\r\n     Sepulchre, two canons, the viscount of Jerusalem, and two sworn\r\n     citizens. So the assizes were made--so they were kept.'\r\n\r\nThese statements have proceeded upon the supposition that this law book\r\nwas for the whole kingdom; but history has preserved facts which look to\r\nthe conclusion that this was law only for the principality of Syria. But\r\nwhen we consider that these assizes actually procured for themselves a\r\nrecognition beyond the bounds of the kingdom, and that no special law\r\nfor the other three grand divisions has ever been found, we shall be\r\nconstrained to regard this system of law as that of all the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe bloom of the Oriental kingdom of Jerusalem was but brief. On the 9th\r\nof October, 1187, Saladin captured the holy city, and the treasures of\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre fell into infidel hands. The fate of the _Lettres du\r\nSepulcre_ in this catastrophe is in dispute. Most think that they were\r\ndestroyed by the enemy; some, however, and among them Stephen of\r\nLusignan, whose work, entitled, 'Chorography and brief General History\r\nof the Island of Cyprus,' which was printed at Bologna in 1573, maintain\r\nthat they were saved and carried to Cyprus. It is certain that we no\r\nlonger possess the originals; but the authority of these assizes was not\r\nextinguished by that catastrophe, but on the contrary, their sway became\r\nwider with the extension of the Frankish rule.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the isle of Cyprus is most important. As in the year\r\n1193 this 'sweet land and sweet island' (as the poets of the time called\r\nit) was placed by Richard the Lion-hearted under the government of Guido\r\nof Lusignan, the assizes of Jerusalem went into force immediately as the\r\nlaw of the new kingdom. This effect was increased by the union of the\r\ntwo kingdoms which took place soon after, but was unfortunately of brief\r\nduration. Thus was preserved to this law book a flourishing period of\r\nlife long after the Christian kingdom in Asia was lost.\r\n\r\nThen, when in the year 1204 the Latin empire was established at\r\nConstantinople, the assizes of Jerusalem went into effect there. The\r\nfollowing is an account of this event:\r\n\r\n     'As there were many peoples about Constantinople which had not been\r\n     governed by the Roman law, and the situation of the conqueror\r\n     himself required new ordinances, and because indeed the empire\r\n     could not be governed otherwise than by the 'usages and assizes' as\r\n     they are in the Orient, the emperor Baldwin determined to send a\r\n     messenger to the king and patriarch of Jerusalem, praying them to\r\n     send to him a copy of their 'usages and assizes.' When these\r\n     arrived, they were read in the presence of all the barons, and it\r\n     was thereupon resolved to administer minister justice in accordance\r\n     with these, and especially those chapters adapted to times of\r\n     peace.'\r\n\r\nHence there are translations of the assizes to be found in modern Greek,\r\nand the dukes of Athens, princes of Thebes, and other lords of that\r\nregion, who appear in Shakspeare's comedies, applied this system of law,\r\nand perhaps many an obscure custom referred to in those plays might be\r\nexplained by this fact.\r\n\r\nIt was especially the customs preserved in the principality of Achaia\r\nwhich the Venetian government of Negropont subjected to an examination\r\nby twelve citizens, and which, with a few exceptions, particularly in\r\nthe parts relating to judicial combats, were sanctioned by the doge\r\nFrancesco Foscari.\r\n\r\nBut the most romantic chapter in the history of the extension of this\r\nlaw, is the account of its introduction into the Frankish principality\r\nof the Morea. This principality was wrested from the Byzantine empire,\r\nin the year 1213, by William of Champlitte, at the head of a band of\r\nadventurers, and passed by intrigue into the hands of the family Ville\r\nHardouin. An old chronicler of the times tells us that when the second\r\nprince of this family, Godfrey II, reigned in the Morea, an imperial\r\nsquadron landed at Pontikos, carrying the beautiful Agnes, with her\r\nsuite of ladies and knights, to James, king of Aragon, to whom her\r\nfather had promised her in marriage on receiving from that king the\r\npromise of an auxiliary corps for his army. Godfrey was a man who well\r\nunderstood human life. He appeared at the port, testified his high\r\nveneration for the princess, and invited her to rest herself from the\r\nvoyage in his land. The princess seems not to have regarded this journey\r\nto her unknown bridegroom as very pressing; she accepted the invitation,\r\nand on the second day Godfrey's friends suggested to him that he ought\r\nnot to let slip so fine a chance to secure a beautiful wife. His\r\ndecision was at once made. He presented himself as suitor to the\r\nprincess, and succeeded in convincing her that it would be much better\r\nfor her to marry him, whom she had seen and knew, than a man of whom she\r\nknew nothing, who might be crooked, or lame, or otherwise unworthy of\r\nher. She consented to be married at once. Her train of attendants\r\nreturned pleased to Constantinople, bearing the tidings to the emperor,\r\nher father, whose rage on receiving this intelligence may be imagined.\r\nThere was, however, but one thing to be done--he must bear it with the\r\nbest grace he could. The parties met afterward at Larissa. Godfrey\r\nresigned his crown to his father-in-law, received it back again as a\r\nfief from him, and was required to accept the assizes of Jerusalem as\r\nthe law by which he should govern it.\r\n\r\nThis system of law differs from others in this important respect, that\r\nthe highest nobility and bravest heroes of the Christian Orient were the\r\nmost zealous and successful jurists. We cannot give them a special\r\nnotice. The most distinguished was John of Ibelin, count of Jaffa,\r\nAscalon, and Rama, born about the year 1200. His attempts to restore the\r\nlost _Lettres du Sepulcre_ has succeeded so well that his work has,\r\nuntil recently, been regarded as identical with those lost books, and\r\neven _now_, when the laws of the kingdom of Jerusalem are spoken of, the\r\nwork of John of Ibelin is generally understood to be meant. It was this\r\nvery book which the barons of the kingdom of Cyprus, in 1368, when Peter\r\nI, by his arbitrary rule, had subverted justice, set up in a solemn\r\nassembly as the code of the kingdom. In order to make it as like as\r\npossible to the _Lettres du Sepulcre_, it was sealed in the same manner,\r\nplaced in a closed chest, and kept in the cathedral of Nicosia, and this\r\nchest was not allowed to be opened except in the presence of the king\r\nand four vassals.\r\n\r\nWhen in the year 1489 the republic of Venice obtained, through Catharine\r\nCornaro, possession of the isle of Cyprus, the republic bound itself by\r\na solemn act to observe these assizes. The copy which had been preserved\r\nat Nicosia was subsequently lost by some unknown event, and when in the\r\nmean time the French language had ceased to be the prevailing one, there\r\nwas a commission appointed in the year 1531 to make out a new text from\r\nthe best manuscripts which could be found. This revision of the assizes\r\nof Jerusalem was translated into Italian, and was still in use in 1571,\r\nmaking the period during which it was in force almost five centuries.\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced the external history of this system, we now turn to\r\nits material contents.\r\n\r\nNo one any longer regards the forming of a system of law as an\r\nindependent, arbitrary, or accidental thing. Every such must be a\r\nproduct and copy of the entire intellectual life of the age, and this\r\npiece of legislation is indeed a true mirror of the Christian world in\r\nEurope at the time; and the outline only rises more sharply, boldly, and\r\nclearly to view, because there is presented to us at the same time so\r\nrare a phenomenon in the march of civilization as the building up of a\r\nstate organization, for which there is no foundation in the land where\r\nit is to be established.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the spiritual elements fermented and boiled at that\r\ntime in the Occident--how the most shocking rudeness and barbarism\r\nthrove side by side with the most exalted religious enthusiasm--the\r\nlowest forms of materialism by the side of spiritual\r\nfanaticism--superstition, ignorance, and vile falsehood, side by side\r\nwith energy, valor, and generosity--all this is drawn with sharpest\r\nfeatures in the assizes.\r\n\r\nThe history shows us these men in their frantic cruelty, butchering the\r\ninhabitants of conquered Jerusalem, men, women, and children without\r\ndistinction, delighting in their torment, and then, smeared with their\r\nblood, moving in procession to the holy places, singing their Christian\r\nsongs of praise, all dissolved in tears of deepest emotion. They had\r\nleft Europe in swarms, many so ignorant as not to know whether the holy\r\nland which they sought lay on this earth or in those regions which they\r\nhad heard called heaven--so frenzied in their fanaticism as to forget\r\nthat they might still have bodily wants, and hence throwing away their\r\neffects, and yet so low in their ideas as only to enjoy physical things.\r\nSuch are very much the men for which these laws seem to have been made.\r\nUpon one leaf we read: 'That man is without sentiments of honor, though\r\nhe be of highest rank, who, being called to stand as counsel by the\r\nlowest vassal, before a tribunal of justice, declines to do so; for they\r\nare all alike the true followers of Christ;' and by the side of this\r\nthat most unchristian of all legal institutions, slavery, assumes a form\r\nso barbarous that the legislator does not blush to place slaves, though\r\namong them were Christians, on the same level with domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThis same irreconcilable opposition which appears in moral principles,\r\nshows itself again in the political foundation of the assizes.\r\nOriginating in the clash of arms, grown up in the contests and\r\nnecessities of war, on a soil where nothing but constant war could save\r\nit from annihilation, the system is purely martial--made for conflict\r\nand strife. And still it is but one side which shows this character;\r\nfor, in the midst of this precarious existence of the new kingdom, is\r\nseen an elevation of commerce till then unknown--a pursuit of trade for\r\nwhich feudal ideas had provided no place. As Schiller declared that the\r\nCrusaders laid the foundation of civil liberty in Europe, so we may say\r\nthat in the assizes of Jerusalem the narrow views in regard to civil\r\nlife, which controlled the west of Europe in the middle ages, were\r\nexploded. Here the idea of the modern state dawned, though of course and\r\nsingularly enough, side by side with its absolute antithesis, the feudal\r\nstate in its purest form.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient view, it was natural that any man should rule who had the\r\npower, and incomprehensible that any one should allow himself to be\r\nruled who could avoid it. Any other than a forced relation to a lord was\r\nnonsense to antiquity, and the moral duty of obedience was unknown.\r\n\r\nThe idea of voluntary obedience, however, having dawned and become\r\npenetrated with the light of Christianity, formed the first element of\r\nthe feudal system. No prescribed series of duties within the cold\r\nenclosure of legal forms bound mutually to each other the lord and his\r\nvassal. They were bound by the all-embracing feeling of fidelity. Hence\r\nthe Lombard law of feuds compares the relation to that of husband and\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nWhile on the one hand, in the youth of this institution, the virtues\r\nwhich spring from reciprocal fidelity and love developed themselves from\r\nthis relation--a relation inwardly and mutually binding lord and vassal,\r\nand resulting in holding together all the members of the state--so on\r\nthe other hand, where there is no restraint to insolence and arbitrary\r\ndespotism, except that found in the mere sense of moral obligation, they\r\ntranscend all bounds, and find their natural reaction in the resistance\r\nof the subject, destroying the very idea of a state. In the feudal\r\nsystem, however, it is not the state which guarantees, secures, and\r\ndefends the rights of the individual. Whoever claims protection and\r\njustice is referred to his immediate feudal superior, to whom alone, and\r\nnot to the state, as a whole, he owes duty. The state, as a moral\r\nperson--as a society--is entirely in the background.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the rarest phenomena which present themselves in the\r\nChristian laws of the Orient, that in connection with this state-life\r\nbased upon pure private right, the modern notion of society should have\r\nhad its rise. One of the first appearances of change was in the criminal\r\nlaw of the assizes. Not that this rose above the spirit of the times,\r\nfor it was barbarous in the extreme, impregnated throughout with the\r\nidea of literal retaliation--for instance, whoever secretly buried a\r\ndead body, must be buried alive--and again, it recognized scarcely any\r\npunishment but death and the most horrid mutilations, such as cutting\r\noff of nose, ears, tongue, hands, etc., and cannot, with all the\r\npalliations arising from the necessities of the Crusaders, be regarded\r\nas an improvement upon the preceding.\r\n\r\nBut among the genuine products of the middle ages, suddenly arose a\r\nprinciple which has become the basis of modern criminal law, though it\r\nwon its first recognition, and that with difficulty, centuries later.\r\n\r\nPunishment inflicted upon the guilty was at that time universally\r\nregarded as an atonement due to the injured person, but the assizes\r\ndeclare: 'Punishment is decreed, not in the interests of the injured,\r\nbut in those of the entire state.'\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this principle, the sufferer from theft, when he might\r\nhave taken the thief and voluntarily let him go, was punished by\r\nforfeiture of body and estate to the feudal lord, and the assizes\r\ndeclare that 'when no one in case of murder appears to make complaint,\r\nthe king, or the ruler of the land, or the lady of the city where the\r\ndead was found, shall do so, for the blood of the slain cries to\r\nheaven.'\r\n\r\nAs before intimated, there are two grand divisions of the assizes. Those\r\nof the high court contain a complete system of feudal law, of which\r\nindeed a fuller view could scarcely be found than the one above named by\r\nJohn of Ibelin. The feudal law of the Orient was like that of France of\r\nthat day, though peculiarities are everywhere to be met with as the\r\nresult of the constant state of siege in which Jerusalem was involved;\r\nand hence the fact that the feudal system, which had its birth in war,\r\nand led ever thither again, appears nowhere more clearly and fully than\r\nin these assizes.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the shortness of the period allowed by the\r\nstatute limiting titles and claims. Of the same class is the rule that\r\nwhen a fief falls to one, he cannot claim it unless he be present in the\r\nland and seek the investiture in his own person. Hence is explained the\r\noft-repeated maxim of the feudal lawyers of Jerusalem: _A mort ne peut\r\naucune chose escheir_; which means that in matters of inheritance,\r\nsubstitution is not valid, and each must derive his claim from the last\r\nholder of the fief--thus restricting the succession of minors, who would\r\nneed protection.\r\n\r\nIn this oriental law there was a peculiarity in regard to granting leave\r\nof absence to vassals. We have seen that the vassal was not allowed to\r\nleave home, lest his services should be lost to the state in a time of\r\ndanger. But a journey back to Europe might be necessary, and in this\r\ncase the two interests were united by an arrangement called _le\r\ncommendement du fief_, by which the vassal gave up his fief to his lord,\r\nwho received its income and secured the absent owner against the\r\nprovisions of the law limiting the claims of absentees to one year.\r\n\r\nFeudal duties were the same in the Orient as in the Occident, since\r\nfidelity is always and everywhere the same thing; but the greater perils\r\nwhich encompassed the Crusaders led to a more rigid exaction of the\r\nperformance of these duties.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the homage which the feudal tenant performs on entering\r\ninto this relation, the assizes say:\r\n\r\n     'If a man or woman pay homage to the chief feudal lord of the\r\n     kingdom, they shall, with their folded hands lying in his, say:\r\n     'Sire, I will be your vassal for this fief, and I promise to\r\n     protect and defend you for life and for death.' And the lord shall\r\n     answer: 'And I accept thee with God's faithfulness and my own;' and\r\n     he shall in faithfulness kiss him upon the mouth.'\r\n\r\nA special duty in the Orient was to redeem a feudal lord from captivity\r\namong the enemies of the cross, even by pawning or selling one's own\r\nfief or that obtained through a wife. The chief duty, however, even in\r\nthis case, was that of military service, and in the Venetian manuscript\r\nis to be found the rule by which this service was to be rendered.\r\n\r\nA peculiar case deserves here to be mentioned. It might happen that a\r\nman held tenures from two different lords. This was not in itself\r\ninadmissible, and he had only, in accepting the latter fief, to make a\r\nreservation of his fidelity to an earlier lord. He could then discharge\r\nhis duty to one by a substitute, and might even render service to one\r\nagainst the other. It was only forbidden personally to fight a feudal\r\nlord. John of Ibelin says:\r\n\r\n     'In such case the vassal shall appear before his lord, and shall\r\n     say to him, in the presence of his men: 'Sire, I am your man, but\r\n     with reservation of my duty to N. N. This N. N. now comes in arms\r\n     against you, and I regret that I cannot help you, because my lord\r\n     is on the other side, and I cannot bear arms against him, _where\r\n     his body is_; I must, therefore, report myself as _personally_\r\n     serving neither you nor him. I desire my people to serve you\r\n     against him who would rob you, and who now leads the contest\r\n     against you.''\r\n\r\nWomen to whom a fief or the guardianship of one should fall, could not\r\nof course render military service; but in place of this, they were\r\nobliged to marry--a punishment by most perhaps not deemed severe, except\r\nfor the fact that they could not freely choose their own husbands.\r\n\r\nJohn of Ibelin says that 'if a fief fall to a girl of twelve years or\r\nmore (if younger, she is to be held under a guardian, according to law),\r\nthe feudal lord can summon her to take a husband.' This may be done by\r\nthe lord in person, or by his authorized attorney, who thus addresses\r\nthe lady: 'My lady, I offer you, in the name of my lord (name given),\r\nthree knights (names all given), and call upon you in his name, within\r\nthe time of (time specified), to take one of the three whoso names have\r\nbeen given you.' This may not, after all, be a great hardship, for the\r\nladies of our time and land are not sure of three candidates to choose\r\nfrom. These three must of course have been of the lady's own rank, and\r\nhave given their own consent to the presentation of their\r\nnames--otherwise it would be no offer.\r\n\r\n     'If the lady thus warned shall not, within the prescribed time,\r\n     either choose one of the three candidates, or assign for not doing\r\n     so a reason acceptable to the court,'--for instance, that she was\r\n     more than sixty years old would be a valid reason, since if she had\r\n     a husband living, he would not be required to serve after that\r\n     age,--'she shall lose the fief for one year, after which time the\r\n     lord may challenge her again.'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the lord shall omit to make this demand, the lady\r\ncan serve a warning upon him, that he must, within three times fourteen\r\ndays, present her three eligible candidates for her choice in marriage,\r\nand if he shall fail to do so, she can then choose for herself. If the\r\nlord had failed, however, because he could not find the men who were\r\nwilling to run the risks of this candidacy, it is difficult to perceive\r\nwhat additional inducements the lady's efforts could furnish.\r\n\r\nSo much for the law of the chivalry of the kingdom, I now pass to that\r\nof the burghers.\r\n\r\nThe assizes of the burghers' court offer neither in matter nor in form\r\nso complete a system as that already noticed. On the contrary, it is but\r\na motley and confused jumble, more like a collection of decisions in\r\nconcrete cases than a proper law book. They are, however, exceedingly\r\nrich in interesting matter.\r\n\r\nThe character of this burgher class, and indeed its very existence, is a\r\nmost remarkable phenomenon; for this respectable class, occupying a\r\nposition almost on a level with that of the nobility, was several\r\ncenturies later in making its appearance in the Occident. The burgher\r\nwho struck a nobleman lost his hand, while the nobleman who struck a\r\nburgher lost his horse, and must pay one hundred sols. Later, however,\r\nthe burgher could commute his punishment with a fine of one thousand\r\nsols, and must pay one hundred sols as an indemnity, thus making the two\r\ncases nearly equal.\r\n\r\nThe term burgher has generally been understood to designate the\r\ninhabitant of a city, whose quiet and orderly life was passed in\r\noccupations of trade and industry; but _such_ burghers were surely not\r\nto be found in the kingdom of Jerusalem; for the burghers sprang from\r\nthe common people, of which the accounts of the Crusades made the chief\r\nportion of the army of the Crusaders to have consisted; and when we\r\nremember how little respect these showed for the princes in the\r\narmy--that they once chose Godfrey Burel out of their own number as\r\ntheir leader--we shall not be astonished that there arose from this\r\nclass of warriors a population who were not to be subjected to a\r\nhumiliating position in relation to the chivalry.\r\n\r\nA free and vigorous life shows itself in the whole system of law which\r\ngoverned these burghers. Here we meet, for the first time in the middle\r\nages, the principles of marine and commercial law, rising above the then\r\nrather limited views of the Roman law on those subjects, which in the\r\nGerman law books are not mentioned at all. We find among other things\r\nstrict personal arrest of delinquent debtors--a very ingenious provision\r\nagainst fraud--and a settlement of those cases of intervention which\r\nhave so troubled our jurists, by an application of the rule, 'The hand\r\nmust defend the hand,' as follows:\r\n\r\n     'Be it known that if any one lend his horse to another, and the\r\n     latter say to him: 'To-morrow I shall bring your horse back,' and\r\n     being allowed to take the horse away, he is apprehended by another\r\n     person for debt, this creditor may take the borrowed horse for his\r\n     debt.'\r\n\r\nThe two following laws give us something of an insight into the\r\ncondition of the kingdom of the Crusaders, the one in relation to\r\nservants, the other in relation to physicians:\r\n\r\n     'When it shall happen that a man or woman hire a man servant or a\r\n     chambermaid, reason requires that the man or woman who hires them\r\n     shall have power to dismiss them at will, because they are bound\r\n     for their wages only so long as they serve. But the servant or maid\r\n     cannot separate themselves from their master or mistress without\r\n     their consent until the termination of the engagement. But when the\r\n     servant or maid thus hired shall wish to go back over the sea,\r\n     reason requires that the man or woman grant them leave, because\r\n     they wish to cross the sea, and they shall pay them according to\r\n     the time of service. * * * When, however, servant or maid shall\r\n     depart _without_ such leave, they break faith and forfeit their\r\n     wages for the whole time of service. And if such servant be found\r\n     with any other person in the kingdom, his or her hand with which\r\n     they made promise to serve and afterward denied God and broke\r\n     faith, shall be pierced through with a red-hot iron.'\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     'When it shall happen that any one hire a servant or chambermaid,\r\n     become angry with him or her, and box their ears, and the latter\r\n     enter complaint to the court, reason requires that the man or woman\r\n     be _not_ subject to judicial proceeding for a simple boxing of the\r\n     servant's ears. But if the man or woman shall excessively beat the\r\n     servant or maid, or cause the same to be done, or shall inflict\r\n     upon them an open wound, and they shall enter complaint of the same\r\n     to the court, law and reason require that the servant or maid\r\n     receive justice the same as against strangers.'\r\n\r\nIn regard to physicians, the assizes provide as follows:\r\n\r\n     'If by any mishap I wound one of my slaves, or the same be wounded\r\n     by any other person, and I call a physician, who agrees with me to\r\n     heal him for a stipulated price, and then says to me on the third\r\n     day, after having well observed the wound, that he can heal it\r\n     without fail, and it come to pass, because he uses the lancet\r\n     unskilfully, or when he should not have used it at all, or because\r\n     when he should have cut the wound or swelling in the top or\r\n     lengthwise he cut it obliquely, and the patient die in consequence;\r\n     or when the slave's wound is in such place as to require warm\r\n     applications, for instance upon the brain or nerves, and the\r\n     physician always makes cold ones; or if my slave have a swelling\r\n     upon a part where emollients should be applied to mollify the sore\r\n     and cause suppuration and discharge, and the physician make always\r\n     warm and dry applications by which the sore is internally inflamed,\r\n     and he die of it; or if the physician do not attend him every day,\r\n     and he die in consequence, reason requires that he pay what the\r\n     slave was justly worth before he fell sick, or what the owner had\r\n     paid for him; for this is right and reasonable, according to the\r\n     assizes of Jerusalem. And the court shall expel that physician from\r\n     the city where he performed such malpractice. But if the physician\r\n     can show before the court that the patient drank wine or ate meat\r\n     which he had forbidden, or did anything else which he should not\r\n     have done at all, or at least not so soon as he did, reason\r\n     requires that, even though the physician could or should have\r\n     treated him differently, he should not be made to pay for him; for\r\n     it is more reasonable to suppose that death followed from the\r\n     patient's doing what was forbidden than in consequence of the\r\n     medical treatment. But if the physician make no prohibition in\r\n     regard to eating or drinking, he must still pay for him, for the\r\n     physician is justly bound, as soon as he sees a patient, to direct\r\n     what he shall eat and what he shall not eat, and if he do not do\r\n     this, and mischance occur, it should come upon him.'\r\n\r\n     'And if a physician be guilty of such malpractice in case of a\r\n     Frankish man or woman, reason requires that he should be hanged.'\r\n\r\nWe can see from this assize that a law sometimes effects the opposite of\r\nthat which was intended, and unreasonable provisions oppress the patient\r\ninstead of the physician. Amalrick I fell sick, and felt that he needed\r\nan aperient, but the Syrian physicians refused to prescribe such. He\r\nsent for the European physicians, and they also declined to take the\r\nhazard of prescribing. To obtain the prescription there was no\r\nalternative but to issue a royal rescript absolving the physicians\r\nbeforehand from the provisions of this assize. In the mean time,\r\nhowever, the favorable period passed by and the king died.\r\n\r\nIn regard to marriage--the most important of social institutions--the\r\nprovisions of the canon law are mainly reproduced, with the genuine\r\nGerman practice of joint possession of the property, as expressed in the\r\npassage: _Sachés que nul home n'est si dreit heir au mort come est sa\r\nfeme._ ('No one so properly as the wife inherits the property of a\r\ndeceased husband.')\r\n\r\nStill, however, oriental views left their traces upon this institution.\r\nThis appears in the facility with which a man could obtain a divorce\r\nfrom his wife, and in the jealous strictness in regard to conjugal\r\ninfidelity. Vitry says:\r\n\r\n     'The pullans'--a name analogous to that of creole in the West\r\n     Indies, given to the descendants of the Crusaders in the\r\n     Orient--'have gone so far in their oriental zeal, that they no\r\n     longer allow their wives to go to church, to processions, or to any\r\n     religious exercises.'\r\n\r\nWhen the council of Neapolis had provided cruel and barbarous\r\nmutilations for persons unfaithful to the marriage vow, King Amalrick\r\nissued the assize that 'the man who should detect his wife in the\r\ncommission of such offence, might without guilt kill both parties;' but\r\nhe added the very nice distinction, that 'if he killed _one_ party and\r\nspared the _other_, he should, as a murderer, be hanged without grace.'\r\nPerhaps this law may have been a device to save both parties; for a man\r\nwould naturally hesitate to undertake a work, failure to _complete_\r\nwhich would cost him his life.\r\n\r\nThe last means everywhere for establishing truth was the judicial\r\ncombat. There are found, by way of exception, in the assizes of the\r\nburghers' court, cases of the judgment of God by the fire test, in which\r\nthe defendant is acquitted of the charges against him, by holding in\r\nhis hand, without injury, for a given length of time, a red-hot iron.\r\nTorture was sometimes prescribed, and the so called abrevement (water\r\ntest) used. The assize says:\r\n\r\n     'If the accused confess the crime charged, he shall be hanged; if\r\n     he do not confess, he shall be drawn to the torture, and kept in\r\n     the water until he shall confess, and shall then be immediately\r\n     hanged. But if he continue three days without confessing or dying\r\n     under torture'--a thing not easily imagined--'he shall be\r\n     imprisoned one year, and then set free.'\r\n\r\nThe complainant must prove a charge of murder, high treason, or\r\nmanslaughter, by single combat with the accused. Women, old men, and\r\nnon-combatants might be represented by a so-called champion.\r\n\r\nJohn of Ibelin describes the combat as follows:\r\n\r\n     'The knights who engage in the combat for murder or manslaughter\r\n     must fight on foot and without helmet, with heads shorn around,\r\n     being dressed in red military coats, or shirts of red silk falling\r\n     down to the knees, the arms cut off above the elbow, red breeches\r\n     of cloth or silk, and shields higher by half a foot than their\r\n     heads, with two holes of the ordinary size, so that the antagonist\r\n     can be seen through them. Each shall have a lance and two swords,\r\n     one of the latter girded about him, the sheath drawn up to his\r\n     hips, the other fastened to the shield, so that he can have it when\r\n     needed.'\r\n\r\nOnly three days may intervene between the interchange of pledges and the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n     'When the combatants who shall have mutually pledged themselves to\r\n     the combat present themselves, they must appear on the appointed\r\n     day on foot, between six and nine o'clock in the morning, before\r\n     the palace of the lord, and call him, being clothed and equipped as\r\n     above, having also several shields and swords borne before them, in\r\n     order that, on entering the place of combat, they may select what\r\n     they need.\r\n\r\n     'And then the lord shall cause all the weapons to be examined by\r\n     his court, so as to know whether they are in order; and if one\r\n     lance is longer than the other, he shall shorten it, and he shall\r\n     have the two combatants well watched as they go to the place of\r\n     combat, that neither may run away; also that they receive no bodily\r\n     injury or annoyance, and be not insulted or derided; for the lord\r\n     must protect them against all this, since they are in his keeping.\r\n     When they shall have entered the place of combat, the feudal lord\r\n     shall station some of his people to watch the place, and one of\r\n     these shall say, in the presence of the others, to each of the\r\n     combatants: 'Select your weapons which ye desire in order to finish\r\n     the combat.' This they shall do, and the weapons selected shall be\r\n     kept in the place, and the rest carried away. Then shall each\r\n     combatant be made to swear that he carries about his person neither\r\n     talisman, nor charm, nor witchcraft, that he has had no such\r\n     provided for this combat, and that no other person has done this\r\n     with his knowledge, that he has neither given nor promised anything\r\n     to any one to procure the making of talisman, charm, or witchcraft,\r\n     in order to aid himself or damage his antagonist in this contest,\r\n     and that he bears about him no other weapons than those seen by the\r\n     court.\r\n\r\n     'Then shall they bring the combatants together upon the place of\r\n     combat, where there shall be a copy of the gospels. The accused\r\n     shall first swear upon his knees with his right hand upon the\r\n     gospels, and shall say: 'As I have not murdered the deceased, so\r\n     help me God and the holy gospel.' The complainant shall say that he\r\n     lies, and that he takes him up as a perjured person, and shall then\r\n     take him by the thumb, and shall swear: 'So let God and his holy\r\n     gospel help me, as the accused murdered the deceased.' And then\r\n     shall the guards station the combatants, one at each end of the\r\n     place, and the proclamation shall be made at all the four corners\r\n     of the field, that no one of whatever rank shall do or say anything\r\n     by which either party can be helped or hindered, and in case any\r\n     one shall do so, his person and goods shall fall to his feudal\r\n     lord. And if the corpse of the murdered person is present, it shall\r\n     be so placed as to be seen over the entire place of combat, and the\r\n     complainant, whether man or woman, in case of being represented by\r\n     a combatant, shall be there bound so as neither to benefit nor\r\n     injure either of the parties by word, or deed, or bearing, and\r\n     shall only pray to God, but not so as to be heard by either\r\n     combatant. * * * And the guard shall so arrange that the sun cannot\r\n     shine more in the face of one than of the other; and one of the\r\n     guards shall then say: 'Shall the command now be given? We have\r\n     made all ready.' And the lord shall answer: 'Let them come\r\n     together.' And they shall let them come together, and shall\r\n     withdraw themselves; and if one fasten upon the other, and they\r\n     wrestle and fall, the guards shall go to the place and as near to\r\n     them as they can, in order to be able to hear in case one shall cry\r\n     for grace; and if one cry and they hear, they shall say to the\r\n     other, 'Cease; it is enough.' And then shall the lord cause the\r\n     conquered party to be taken to the gallows and hanged by the neck'\r\n     (a grace scarcely worth crying for), 'or his corpse, in case he had\r\n     been killed without crying for grace. The weapons of the vanquished\r\n     man and those which the victor threw away belong to the lord.\r\n     Should it appear in the course of the contest that one of the\r\n     parties had other weapons than those which had been seen by the\r\n     court, the guards shall seize him, and the lord shall pronounce\r\n     sentence upon him as a murderer.\r\n\r\n     'And if any one, who is no knight, is accused of murder, it shall\r\n     be done as above, only that the combatants shall be armed otherwise\r\n     than as knights.'\r\n\r\nIf the vanquished man did not fight for himself, but as a substitute,\r\nhis lot was subject to some variation; if he fought for a woman, then\r\nnot _he_, but the _woman_, was to be hanged; if he fought for a witness\r\nwho had been accused of perjury in a civil suit, then the champion was\r\nto be hanged and the perjured man merely lost his right of testifying on\r\noath; in case of representing any of the principal parties in a criminal\r\nprocess, a vanquished champion and the person whom he represented were\r\nboth to be hanged; and in case of representing a witness in a criminal\r\ncase, the _vanquished champion the witness, and the complainant were all\r\nhanged_.\r\n\r\nIt is easily perceived that in such single combat the judgment of God\r\nwas not upon the main question, but upon the question which of the two\r\nhad committed perjury. So in case of the application of the single\r\ncombat in civil suits, which, however, could take place only when the\r\namount claimed was at least one mark.\r\n\r\nWhoever prosecuted a claim must establish it by at least two witnesses;\r\nand if he brought these, the defendant could not establish the contrary\r\nby better witnesses or documents, but must either submit, or convict the\r\nwitnesses of perjury. This was done as follows: When the first witness,\r\nkneeling, had taken the oath, the defendant stepped forward, took hold\r\nof the witness' thumb, and raised him up, declaring him a false and\r\nperjured witness, and that he was ready to maintain this with his life.\r\nThen followed the judicial combat as above.\r\n\r\nThe procedure was similar when any one would contest a judgment already\r\nrendered. The court itself must be solemnly accused of falsehood; the\r\ncomplainant must fight with _all_ the associate judges of the court, or\r\nhave his tongue cut off as a calumniator. Whoever in such case did not\r\nvanquish _all_ the judges of the court, and that, too, _on the same\r\nday_, must be hanged.\r\n\r\nThe obvious remark in relation to all the processes above described is,\r\nthat unless hanging was much more honorable then than now, however\r\nnumerous the capital crimes committed, probably few complaints were\r\nentered, very few witnesses accused of perjury, very few combatants\r\ncried for grace, even in the most desperate struggle, very few judicial\r\ndecisions were contested, and very few injured husbands used their right\r\nof punishing the unfaithful wife and her accomplice, since _all parties,\r\ninnocent and guilty, stood about equal chances of being hanged at the\r\nend_.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades furnish the subject of frequent popular disquisitions and,\r\nsketches, but the laws by which the Crusaders lived in their promised\r\nland have rarely, if ever, been popularly sketched in this country. This\r\nbrief notice may do something toward supplying this desideratum, and at\r\nthe same time toward reconciling the most poetic reader--the greatest\r\nadmirer of the institutions of chivalry--to having been born in this\r\nprosaic age, nearly a thousand years later. It may make such persons\r\nfeel that even 'the glorious uncertainty of the law' has some advantages\r\nover the judicial processes of the kingdom of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nBut I must not close my article, as some in similar cases have done,\r\nwithout informing the reader to whom he is indebted mainly for it. I\r\nhave myself often entered that hall in the Royal Library at Munich, and\r\nlooked with interest upon that manuscript of the Assizes of Jerusalem,\r\nbut I have never studied it. In the winter of 1858, however, I heard a\r\ncourse of popular lectures on various subjects, by a number of\r\ndistinguished men, before an audience of invited ladies and gentlemen,\r\nat the lecture room of Baron von Liebig's chemical laboratory. One of\r\nthese was delivered by Baron de Voelderndorff on the Assizes of\r\nJerusalem. On opening my box of books, after my return from Europe a few\r\nweeks since, I came across a volume containing the course of lectures to\r\nwhich I have referred. As my eye rested upon this one, I remembered the\r\ninterest with which I had listened to its original delivery, and\r\nresolved that the public should have a chance to feel something of the\r\nsame. This article is the fruit of that resolution, and though not\r\nstrictly a translation, may still be regarded as little more or less\r\nthan such, and the credit given wherever the reader shall deem it due.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Jurors, larceny, theft, murder.\r\n\r\n[2] Francis de Pitaval, born at Lyons, in 1673, gave this word to the\r\njudicial literature of Europe, by a work entitled 'Causes célébres et\r\nintêressantes.'\r\n\r\n[3] La haute cour.\r\n\r\n[4] Assises de la haute cour.\r\n\r\n[5] La chevalerie du royaume.\r\n\r\n[6] Bourgeois.\r\n\r\n[7] Cours de la chaine.\r\n\r\n[8] Cour de la fonde,--fonde signifying the place, probably, where\r\ntraders came together.\r\n\r\n[9] 'Lettres du Sepulcre.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO PROFESSOR S. F. B. MORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\nLOYALTY AND SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I address you in your quality of President of the Society for\r\nthe Diffusion of Political Knowledge, and with reference to your speech\r\nand your letter to Mr. Crosby, published in the tracts issued by your\r\nSociety. I should have done so sooner but that I hoped Mr. Crosby would\r\nhimself have taken the matter in hand; and though it is somewhat late in\r\nthe day, I venture to recall the public attention to what you have put\r\nforth, both because in a general view it is never too late to expose\r\nerror on matters of fundamental importance, and because, in this case,\r\nthere are some special reasons why it should be done, arising from your\r\npersonal position. If you were a mere hackneyed party politician, I\r\nshould not think it worth while to take any public notice of what you\r\nhave said.\r\n\r\nI should be glad to confine myself strictly to the question of the truth\r\nor error of what you have advanced, apart from its bearings on yourself\r\npersonally; but as most of what you have put forth is in the way of\r\nvindicating your loyalty and justifying your conduct at this time, I\r\nshall have to consider also its validity for your purpose. This is a\r\nnecessity of the case which I have not made. Before proceeding to your\r\nletter to Mr. Crosby, I shall first consider some matters in your\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nIn a crisis such as this, when the clutch of the wickedest rebellion the\r\nworld ever saw is grappling the throat of the national existence, you\r\nare openly in opposition to the action of the Government, and\r\napparently in sympathy with the rebels. Yet you claim to be loyal, and\r\nyou vindicate your claim in a very remarkable way. Loyalty with you is\r\nfidelity to the sovereign. That sovereign is the people. To that\r\nsovereign you profess to bear true allegiance, and therefore your\r\nloyalty is not to be impeached, however much you may oppose yourself to\r\nthe action of the authorities constituted by the sovereign. A singular\r\nsort of loyalty; very much of a piece, some may say, with the religion\r\nof the man who disobeys the bidding of those whom God bids him obey,\r\nbecause of his profound reverence for the supreme authority of God!\r\n\r\nYou, of course, deny this. You make the issue that the action of the\r\nconstituted authorities is contrary to the will of the sovereign--is, in\r\nfact, the exercise of usurped powers. You propose to appeal directly to\r\nthe sovereign for the determination of this issue; that is, you propose\r\nto bring the sovereign to be of the same mind with you, if you can. 'We\r\nmean,' you say, 'to use our rights of free discussion, and to look for\r\nthe answer to our appeal to the ballot box.' And you ask, 'Is it\r\ndisloyalty to appeal to the sovereign, or to exercise that portion of\r\nthe sovereign power which of right belongs to us, as part of the\r\npeople?'\r\n\r\nNow, there is certainly nothing necessarily disloyal in making and\r\ndiscussing before the people the issue you make, any more than there is\r\nanything necessarily villanous in a man's availing himself of his\r\nextreme legal rights before the courts: whether it be so in fact or not,\r\ndepends on the circumstances, on the spirit, purpose, and effect of the\r\nthing. But there is a great deal of nonsense (pardon me) in calling this\r\nan exercise of _that portion of the sovereign power which of right\r\nbelongs to you as part of the people_--nonsense which, if it were merely\r\nnonsense, and as palpable to everybody as it is to those who are\r\naccustomed to correct thinking and accurate expression on the subject,\r\nit would not be worth while to expose; but which, being taken for sound\r\nsense (as it is very likely to be by many of the people among whom you\r\nhave undertaken to diffuse political knowledge), becomes very pernicious\r\nnonsense, that ought not to be suffered to pass.\r\n\r\nA portion of the sovereign power belonging to you and your associates as\r\nindividuals! The sovereignty of the nation split up into fractional\r\nshares--each of you possessing (say) one thirty-millionth part of the\r\nintegral unit, and possessing it, of course, exclusively and therefore\r\nseparately, if you are to exercise it individually, even in the way of\r\nclubbing your respective shares as you propose! Heard ever any one the\r\nlike? Why, you might as well say that each individual in the nation\r\npossesses the entire sovereign power. As well say thirty million whole\r\nsovereigns, as thirty million fractional sovereigns. Equal falsehood,\r\nequal absurdity, either way.\r\n\r\nPolitical sovereignty is as incapable of division as it is of forfeiture\r\nor of alienation. It is the right and power which society--considered as\r\nthe state--has to do whatever is necessary to its existence and welfare.\r\nIt resides in the whole people as one body politic. It is not an\r\nattribute of individuals. Individual rulers are sometimes called\r\nsovereigns; but they cannot be such in the strict and just sense of the\r\nterm. It is simply impossible that any individual should possess in\r\nhimself the inherent, indefeasible, inalienable, and inviolable right\r\nand power to govern a nation; and it is no less impossible that you and\r\nyour associates, in your separate capacity as individuals, should\r\npossess any 'portion' of it, and therefore none 'of right belongs' to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI do not deny your 'rights of free discussion.' But I deny that they are\r\nsovereign rights, and that the exercise of them is an exercise of\r\nsovereign power. They are individual, personal rights, and that of\r\nitself determines the absurdity of calling them sovereign.\r\n\r\nBesides, in point of fact, they are rights which are practically valid\r\nfor you only in the will of the sovereign. Whether they are in their\r\nnature primordial or prescriptive rights, makes no difference as to this\r\npoint. The will of the sovereign is the only effectual guarantee of the\r\nnatural rights of individuals, and the only source of their political\r\nrights. The sovereign recognizes the former, confers the latter, and\r\nsecures both. There is not a particle of political right or power\r\npossessed or exercised by any individual in the nation which is not\r\nderived by grant from the sovereign power. A certain number of\r\nindividuals in the nation have, for instance, the right of voting at the\r\nprimary elections and for the determination of certain questions\r\nsubmitted to a popular vote. This is a delegated right, granted only to\r\na certain number of individuals, not as sovereigns or parcel sovereigns,\r\nbut as subjects of the state, acting, for certain definite purposes, and\r\nwithin certain prescribed limits, as agents of the sovereign power.\r\n\r\nSo with all other political powers exercised in the nation--whether\r\nlegislative, judicial, or executive; whether exercised by individuals or\r\nby constituted bodies: all stand in the will of the sovereign power; all\r\nare derived and delegated powers--ministerial, and not imperial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is easy now to see the pernicious influence which your doctrine about\r\nthe sovereign rights of individuals must have upon the unreflecting\r\nmasses who accept it as sound sense, and particularly upon those of them\r\nwho vote at the primary elections.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it generates a false and practically mischievous\r\nnotion of their relation to the other constituted authorities of the\r\nstate. You are yourself an example in point.\r\n\r\nYou ask whether it is a mistake or an exaggeration in you to 'say that\r\npresidents, and governors, and all the departments of State or Federal\r\nmachinery, are all subordinate to the people?'\r\n\r\nIt is certainly neither a mistake nor an exaggeration to say so,\r\nprovided by the people you understand the whole people, in their\r\nsovereign capacity as one body politic. But it is an egregious mistake,\r\nan absurd and mischievous falsehood, to say so, if by the people be\r\nunderstood those who vote in the primary elections--whether the\r\nconcurring majority of them or all of them. The people who vote are not\r\n_the_ sovereign people. In their capacity of voters they are--in common\r\nwith all the other functionaries of the Government--coördinate parts of\r\nthe indivisible organism of the State. The legislative, judicial, and\r\nexecutive functionaries of the Government--constituted directly or\r\nindirectly through the ministerial agency of their votes--when thus\r\nconstituted, hold their powers not _from_ the voters, but _through_ them\r\n_from_ the sovereign; and to that sovereign alone are they responsible\r\nfor the exercise of them. They are, therefore, not 'subordinate' to the\r\nvoters, either in the sense of deriving their powers from them, or in\r\nthe sense of being accountable to them, and there is no other sense of\r\nthe term that is not futile here. They are subordinate in both these\r\nrespects to the sovereign power of the nation; but so, too, are the\r\nvoters themselves; and the former no more than the latter.\r\n\r\nBut those who accept your instructions are not likely so to understand\r\nthis. They are not likely to be wiser than their teachers, and cannot\r\nperhaps be so safely trusted with the dangerous edge tools of false\r\ndoctrine. You tell them that all Government officials, in all\r\ndepartments, are subordinate to the sovereign people; and they are sure\r\nto understand it that they, the voters, are the sovereign people, and\r\nthat all the constituted authorities are subordinate to them in point\r\nof power--hold their powers from them alone, and are responsible to them\r\nalone--while they themselves hold their powers from themselves, and are\r\nresponsible only to themselves. Hence (and you yourself have in this\r\nspeech set them the example) we hear them talking of themselves as the\r\n'masters,' and Government officials as their 'servants,' just as though\r\nboth alike were not servants of one and the same sovereign master, whose\r\nright and power it is--within the sphere of the state, and for the just\r\nends of the state--to control every individual in the nation. There is a\r\nworld of mischief in the use of such words among the ignorant and\r\nunreflecting, and demagogues well know how to avail themselves of the\r\npower it gives them.\r\n\r\nThe pernicious tendency of your doctrine about the sovereign power and\r\nsovereign rights of individuals is seen in another and more general\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nPolitical sovereignty--residing, as we have seen it does, in the whole\r\npeople as the state, or as one body politic--is not an absolute\r\nsovereignty. It is limited to the just ends of the state--the\r\nmaintenance of social justice and the general security and welfare.\r\nThere is no sovereignty to do wrong. The state is so far a moral person\r\nthat its sovereignty cannot rightfully be exercised from mere will,\r\narbitrary caprice, or passion; but only dutifully, in just ways, and for\r\nits proper ends.\r\n\r\nBut the people whom you teach to consider as themselves individually\r\npossessed of a portion of the sovereign power, and (as they will think)\r\nso far sovereigns, have mostly no other idea of sovereignty than the\r\nabsolute right to have their own will and way in any way. Regarding\r\ntheir political rights as their own, inherent, personal possession and\r\nproperty, and not as public trusts, they are not likely to feel\r\nthemselves limited in the manner of exercising them by any sense of duty\r\nto the state. The stronger this false notion of rights, the feebler the\r\nsense of moral obligation in the exercise of them. Woe to the people to\r\nwhom rights are everything and duties nothing, or to whom the standing\r\nfor their own rights is the highest and most sacred political duty!\r\nAmong such a people, in times of high excitement, springs up a political\r\nfanaticism far less respectable in its origin, and far more dangerous to\r\nthe public welfare, than the philanthropic fanaticism which you denounce\r\nin language so nearly bordering on fanatic violence.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have been obliged to insist at such length upon the\r\nsimplest elements of political science and the theory of our Government.\r\nBut you have made it needful. You have put forth notions radically false\r\nand practically mischievous on fundamental questions; and you have done\r\nit in the way most calculated to impose on the minds of the ignorant and\r\nunthinking--by quietly assuming their truth. One wonders to see you\r\napparently so unconscious of the utter contradiction between that which\r\nyou take for granted and that which, in the general consent of\r\nrespectable writers and thinkers, is held to be settled beyond debate.\r\nThere is one at least among your associates (if I mistake not) who would\r\nbe ashamed to stand godfather to your assumptions in regard to\r\nsovereignty and sovereign rights.\r\n\r\nIt is important for one who is so fond as you are of making\r\ndistinctions, to see to it that they are just and valid. It is of\r\nimmense moment that one who builds so much on words should rest his\r\nstructure on the solid foundation of a correct and exact conception of\r\nthem. Words are often things, and sometimes things of tremendous\r\nconsequence, and none more so than those which enter into the grounding\r\nprinciples, of politics. No theoretical error but works practical\r\nmischief. No one should be more aware of this than he who undertakes the\r\n'diffusion of political knowledge' among the people of this country.\r\nThe false notions on sovereignty and sovereign rights which you have put\r\nforth, are precisely the ones to take root and bear evil fruit among the\r\nleast instructed and least thoughtful, the most passionate and\r\nunscrupulous of our people. In short, it is among the lowest and worst\r\nelements of our social life--among the sort of persons that swelled the\r\nmajorities in the Sixth Ward of Sodom--that you win find your most\r\nnumerous disciples and readiest coadjutors in your bad work of opposing\r\nthe constituted authorities of the state; and this at a time when every\r\ngood man and true patriot should think much more of duties than of\r\nrights, and be more willing to forego personal rights for his country's\r\ngood, than by factious assertion of them to weaken the arm of public\r\npower struggling to save the national existence.\r\n\r\nI shall go on in another letter to consider your utterances on the\r\ndistinction between the Government and the Administration, and your\r\nspecial pleas for hostility to the constituted authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION--CONSTITUTIONALITY.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I now proceed to consider your letter to Mr. Crosby, which I\r\ncannot help regarding as fitted to excite sentiments of mortification as\r\nwell as grief in the minds of all intelligent men and good patriots who\r\nin time past have known and honored you. What such as have not known or\r\ncared for you will be apt to think, I shall not undertake to say.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Crosby's questions was this: 'What appears to you the\r\nsufficient reason for a Christian citizen to ally himself with others\r\nfor the extreme and radical purpose of undermining and paralyzing the\r\npower of the Government at a crisis when unanimity of support is plainly\r\nessential not only to the welfare but to the very life of the nation?'\r\n\r\nThis is a plain question, and one may well wonder how it was possible\r\nfor you to suppose that you were fairly meeting it and effectually\r\nrebutting the charge it implies by raising the distinction you make\r\nbetween the Government and the Administration. The sense in which Mr.\r\nCrosby used the word Government is perfectly obvious; and if he had a\r\nright to use it in that sense--as he undoubtedly had--it seems to me it\r\nwas for you to answer it in its plain meaning; to answer the question he\r\nasked, and not another, which he did not ask. But you preferred to go\r\ninto critical analysis and to make sharp distinctions of words. Let us\r\nlook at the work you have made of it.\r\n\r\nYou tell Mr. Crosby that he has 'fallen into the prevalent error of\r\nconfounding the Government with the Administration of the Government,'\r\nand that 'they are not the same.' Now, they _are_ the same, when both\r\nwords are used to signify the same thing.\r\n\r\nYou say that 'the word government has, indeed, two meanings.' Webster\r\ngives a round dozen. In its political applications it has four. You add,\r\n'In order to relieve the subject from ambiguity'--though there is in\r\nthis case no ambiguity to relieve--'that the ordinary meaning of\r\ngovernment in free countries is that form of fundamental rules and\r\nprinciples by which a nation or state is governed,' etc. No doubt this\r\nis one of the meanings of the word. No doubt government, considered with\r\nreference to its quality or the manner of its constitution, does often\r\nsignify a system of polity, a determinate organization and distribution\r\nof the supreme powers of the state. But this is not its '_ordinary_'\r\nmeaning--either in the sense of its being the most correct and proper,\r\nor the most frequent use of the term. The other meaning to which you\r\nrefer--that which makes it 'synonymous with the administration of\r\npublic affairs'--is equally legitimate, and a great deal more frequent.\r\nThe word not only '_sometimes_' has this meaning, but has it, I presume\r\nto say, ten times oftener than it has what you call its 'ordinary\r\nmeaning,' and for the sufficient reason that there is occasion to speak\r\nten times of Government as an actual exercise of the supreme powers\r\nwhere there is to speak of it once as an abstract system of polity.\r\n\r\nBut you say that when the word is used in 'a meaning synonymous with\r\nadministration of public affairs, then '_the Government_' is\r\nmetonymically used for _administration_, and should not be confounded\r\nwith the original and true signification of the term _Administration_,\r\nwhich means the _persons collectively_ who are intrusted with the\r\nexecution of the laws, and with the superintendence of public affairs.'\r\n\r\nPardon me, but this strikes me as a singular combination of futilities\r\nand falsities. In the first place, when the word government is used\r\nsynonymously with administration, to signify in a general way the\r\nconduct of public affairs, there is nothing 'metonymical' in the case:\r\none word is not rhetorically put for the other; either word may be\r\nrightfully used to signify the same thing, that is, they are so far\r\nforth simply synonymous terms. In the next place, what in the world do\r\nyou mean by saying that the '_original and true_' signification of the\r\nterm administration is the _persons collectively_ who are intrusted with\r\nthe execution of the laws, and with the superintendence of public\r\naffairs? It is one of the meanings of the word indeed, and so a 'true'\r\none--though no more true than its other authorized meanings, but it is\r\nnot the 'original' one; on the contrary, it is secondary and derived.\r\nAnd finally, what earthly warrant have you for talking of 'confusion'\r\nbeing made when the _Government_ is used to signify 'the persons\r\ncollectively' by whom public affairs are conducted? It is just as\r\ncorrect to use the word Government in this sense, as it is to use the\r\nword Administration. Both words are rightfully so used; and you would\r\nhere, I suppose, be in no error in saying 'metonymically' used, if you\r\nhave a fancy for that epithet: _Administration_ is 'metonymically' _put\r\nfor_ the official persons and acts of the persons who have the direction\r\nof national affairs, and _Government_ is just _as often_ 'metonymically'\r\nput for the same persons and acts--and with _equal right_; for it is\r\nauthorized by established usage, which is the supreme law of language.\r\nBy what right, then, do you assume to limit the term government to\r\nsignifying a 'form of fundamental rules and principles,' or at least to\r\ninsist that when used synonymously with administration, it shall _not_\r\nbe used to signify the 'persons collectively' by whom the affairs of the\r\nnation are conducted; and when Mr. Crosby uses it--as he obviously\r\ndoes--in that sense, to talk to him of 'error and confusion?' When Lord\r\nRussell spoke the other day in the British Parliament of 'awaiting an\r\nexplanation from the American Government' in the matter of the Peterhof,\r\nand when the London _Times_ spoke of 'the Government at Washington being\r\nanxious,' you might as properly have taken them to task for the 'error'\r\nand 'confusion' of talking as if our 'form of fundamental rules and\r\nprinciples' could give an explanation, or feel disturbed in mind. Mr.\r\nCrosby had a perfect right to use the word in the sense in which he\r\nobviously did use it. He fell, therefore, into no 'error.' He\r\n'confounded' nothing; he did not identify different things, nor\r\nwrongfully put one thing for another.\r\n\r\nIn short, your distinction between the Government and the Administration\r\nfalls away into a sheer, absurd futility. And well if it escape a\r\nharsher judgment; for when you go about to make irrelevant distinctions\r\nin a plain case, where there is none to be made, and tax your\r\ncorrespondent (no matter in what soft phrase) with errors and\r\nconfusions when he was guilty of none--it will go nigh to be thought by\r\nmany an unworthy subterfuge, serving no other purpose than the\r\nfallacious one of shifting the question, and misleading dull minds.\r\n\r\nOf the same sort is what you further say in support of this futile\r\ndistinction. You talk of the Administration being '_utterly destroyed_\r\nwithout affecting the health of the Government,' of the Government\r\n'remaining intact, unscathed, while the Administration is _swept out of\r\nexistence_;' and you say 'every change of Administration, at every\r\nelection, exemplifies this great truth'!\r\n\r\nBy Government, I suppose you here unconsciously mean something different\r\nfrom what you had before defined as its 'ordinary meaning,' for you\r\nwould hardly talk of the 'life' and 'health' of an abstract scheme of\r\npolity, of a set of 'rules and principles.' I take it, therefore, that\r\nyou mean, or ought to mean, a living, acting something. Now imagine a\r\nGovernment without an Administration, with its Administration 'utterly\r\ndestroyed,' 'swept out of existence.' How long afterward would it\r\ncontinue to exist? One day? One hour? One moment? No; the 'life' of a\r\nGovernment implies the perpetual, uninterrupted exercise of the supreme\r\npowers of the state, and that depends upon the undying official life of\r\nliving administrative functionaries; and therefore to say, as you do,\r\nthat the Administration is 'utterly destroyed,' 'swept out of\r\nexistence,' every time new members are elected to fill the place of\r\nthose whose term of office has run out, is an absurd exaggeration of\r\nlanguage, and certainly serves no good purpose, but only affords to\r\nthose who are capable of being deceived by it a fallacious show of\r\nsupport to a distinction which I have proved to be irrelevant and futile\r\nin this case.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me it is not for you to talk about 'the prejudices and\r\nbefogged intellects' of those who are unable to see 'in the light' of\r\nyour notable 'explication' that 'opposition to the Administration'--such\r\nas you now make--'is not opposition to the Government.' And your\r\npretension 'to rally in support of the Government,' and to 'uphold and\r\nstrengthen' it, by such opposition, will, I am afraid, be looked upon by\r\nintelligent men and good patriots as absurd and impudent to the last\r\ndegree-an outrage, in fact, on language and on common sense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut enough for your verbal distinctions--a great deal too much, indeed,\r\nwere it not that if you can put forth such things in good faith, it is\r\nto be presumed that there may be others of easy faith enough, through\r\ndisloyal predisposition of feeling, to take them as sound and valid, and\r\nso find comfort in error and an evil course.\r\n\r\nTo come now to the real merits of the case. You denounce the\r\nAdministration, and seek to stir up popular disaffection to it, not for\r\nheartlessness, hesitation, and feebleness in prosecuting the war, but\r\nprecisely for whatever of earnestness, promptitude, and energy it\r\ndisplays--not, in short, for what it does not do, but for what it does\r\ndo, in striking down the rebellion. It is vain for you to justify your\r\nconduct by professions of allegiance to the sovereign people and loyalty\r\nto the Government. Why, it is the great will of the sovereign people (to\r\nwhom you profess such faithful allegiance) that the Government (to which\r\nyou profess such devoted loyalty) should be saved from destruction by\r\ncrushing to utter extinction the armed rebellion that seeks its\r\noverthrow. And the Administration--and I may include Congress, since the\r\naction of that body is also the object of your denunciation--is the\r\norgan of the sovereign people, carrying out its sovereign will in all\r\nthe acts you denounce. I do not say that the conduct of affairs has been\r\nin all respects satisfactory to the people. There have been too many\r\nthings that looked to them like want of heart, want of earnestness,\r\nwant of energy, want of wisdom, particularly in the earlier conduct of\r\nthe war--too many indications of a disposition, if not to protract the\r\nstruggle, yet to make this terrible crisis of the nation a time for\r\npolitical combinations and contractors' gains. They have seen these\r\nthings with grief and stern displeasure. But the acts you denounce meet\r\ntheir sovereign approval. They are in favor of all earnest and vigorous\r\nmeasures for subduing the rebels, and for repressing and punishing\r\ntraitorous sympathy with them, and treasonable aid and comfort to them.\r\n\r\nBut you denounce these acts as unconstitutional. To a bare, unsupported\r\nassumption it might be enough to say that the constitutionality of all\r\nthese acts has been again and again affirmed by authorities of far\r\ngreater weight than yours or mine--by scores of statesmen and judges of\r\nthe highest eminence in the land. But I will go a little into the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI assert that it is perfectly constitutional to repress an armed\r\nrebellion by force of arms. It is the sworn duty of the Administration\r\nunder the Constitution to do so. And all the acts you condemn come in\r\none way or another under powers delegated to Congress and to the\r\nExecutive. The constitutional right to make war carries with it the\r\nconstitutional right to employ all the means sanctioned by the laws of\r\nwar. This is the amply sufficient justification of each and every one of\r\nthe measures you denounce--the Emancipation Proclamation, the\r\nConfiscation acts, the suspension of _habeas corpus_, and the arrest of\r\ntraitorous abettors of the rebels.\r\n\r\nAs to the _Proclamation_--whether it is to be regarded as in its own\r\nproper effect conferring the _legal_ right to freedom, or whether it is\r\nto be taken simply as a notification to the rebels (and to the slaves\r\nalso, so far as it should get to their knowledge) of what the President,\r\nin his supreme military capacity, was about to order and enforce, as our\r\narmies might come into contact with the slaves--is a question not\r\nnecessary to determine here. But no intelligent man needs be told that\r\neven in a war with a foreign enemy, with honorable belligerents, it is\r\nalways a matter lying rightfully in the discretion of the commander of\r\nan invading army to proclaim and secure the emancipation of slaves; and\r\nin a rebellion like this it is the height of absurdity, or of something\r\nmuch worse than absurdity, to quarrel with the military policy of\r\ndepriving the rebels of the services of loyal men forced to dig trenches\r\nand minister supplies to them. What constitutional right have rebels--in\r\narms for the overthrow of the Constitution--to be exempted from the\r\noperation of the laws of war? Who but a rebel sympathizer would\r\nchallenge it for them?\r\n\r\nAs to the _Confiscation_ acts--it is enough to say that the Constitution\r\ngives Congress power 'to declare the punishment of treason.'\r\nConfiscation of property--as well as forfeiture of life--is a punishment\r\nattached to this great crime in the practice, I believe, of every\r\nGovernment that has existed. The rebels confiscate all the property of\r\nmen in the South loyal to the Union, on which they can lay their hands;\r\nand their practice can be condemned by us only on the ground that the\r\ncrime of rebellion makes all their acts in support of it criminal. But\r\nas you have no word of condemnation for the rebellion, so you have none\r\nfor their confiscation acts. You would throw the shield of the\r\nConstitution only over the property of rebels. Loyal men, however, are\r\nof opinion that as the hardship of paying the expenses entailed by this\r\naccursed rebellion must fall somewhere, it is but just it should fall as\r\nfar as possible on the rebels, rather than on us. If confiscation of\r\nrebel property chance to bear hard on the innocent children of traitors,\r\nit is no more than what constantly chances in time of domestic peace, in\r\nthe pecuniary punishment of crimes far less heinous than treason; and\r\nloyal men see no good reason why the hardship should not fall in part on\r\nthe children of traitors, rather than wholly (as in part it must) on our\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAs to the suspension of the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_:\r\nmany foolish and disloyal people, out of the folly and disloyalty of\r\ntheir hearts, talk as if the thing itself were something wicked and\r\nmonstrous; although the Constitution plainly provides that it may be\r\ndone, 'when, in cases of rebellion and invasion, the public safety may\r\nrequire it.' Who is to judge of the necessity, and who is to exercise\r\nthe power of suspending it, the Constitution does not declare; and in\r\nthe silence of the Constitution and in the absence of any legislation on\r\nthe point, the President might well presume that the discretion of\r\nexercising a power constitutionally vested somewhere, and designed to be\r\nexercised in emergencies of public peril, liable to arise when Congress\r\nmight not be in session, was left to him. At all events, he took the\r\nresponsibility of deciding that the public safety required its exercise.\r\nCongress has since justified his course, and legalized the power in his\r\nhands. The loyal people of the nation approve its action.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the constitutional right in certain cases to suspend the\r\nordinary privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ carries with it, of\r\ncourse, an equally constitutional right to make what you call 'arbitrary\r\narrests.' The very object of granting the power to vacate the privilege\r\nof the writ is to enable the Executive to hold in custody such persons\r\nas it may judge the 'public safety requires' the holding of--without its\r\npurpose being frustrated by judicial interference. But the power to\r\n_hold_ in custody is utterly nugatory, if there be no power to _take_\r\ninto custody. To suppose that the Constitution grants the one, but\r\ndenies the other, is to suppose it self-stultified by contradictory\r\nprovisions--and that in a case where the public safety in time of\r\nimminent peril is concerned. The only consistent and sensible view of\r\nthe Constitution is, that as the validity of the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nis the ordinary rule, and its suspension the extraordinary exception--so\r\nthe power to make arrests by civil process only is the ordinary rule,\r\nand the power to make arrests by military or executive authority is the\r\nextraordinary exception--both exceptions alike holding 'when, in cases\r\nof rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require.' In such cases\r\nthe ordinary guarantees of personal liberty are constitutionally made to\r\ngive way to the operation of the extraordinary powers demanded by the\r\nnecessities of the state. It has always been so in all Governments; and\r\nevery Government--unless it suicidally abnegate its highest function and\r\nsupremest duty, that of maintaining itself and securing the national\r\nsafety--must, in time of rebellion and civil war, possess such powers,\r\npowers to repress and prevent, in the first moment of necessity, what,\r\nif let go on, it might be too late to cure by judicial or any other\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe rebels arrest, imprison, or banish those who are disaffected to\r\ntheir cause. They have a right to do so, provided their rebellion itself\r\nbe justifiable; although they have made themselves objects of just\r\nexecration and abhorrence by the abominable atrocities of cruelty and\r\nmurder they have in thousands of instances perpetrated upon those whom\r\nthey knew or suspected to be faithful to the Union. Your sensibilities,\r\nhowever, are excited only in behalf of the traitors among us, who have\r\ndone more, and are doing more, to aid and comfort the public enemy, and\r\nto weaken the military power of the Government, than whole divisions of\r\nrebels in arms. While millions of good patriots stand amazed at the\r\nextraordinary and unparalleled leniency with which the Government has\r\nfor the most part dealt with these traitors--that is, _done nothing_\r\nwith them--you and your associates are fierce in your denunciations of\r\nits action in the few cases in which it has temporarily arrested them;\r\nand even the requiring of them to take the oath of allegiance as a\r\ncondition of release, has been made matter of bitter invective. What but\r\ndisloyalty to the national cause, what but sympathy with the rebels, can\r\nprompt such denunciations--made, too, with a view to stir up popular\r\ndisaffection to the Government?\r\n\r\nTo sum up: I have shown that all the acts you denounce are as perfectly\r\nconstitutional as they are just and necessary in principle, and\r\nsanctioned by the practice of all Governments.\r\n\r\nBut even if it were otherwise; even if the framers of the\r\nConstitution--never contemplating the possibility of such a crisis as\r\nthe present--had embodied in that instrument no provision of\r\nextraordinary powers for such an exigency--none the less would it be the\r\nduty and the right of Congress and of the Executive to adopt whatever\r\nmeasures they should judge the public safety to require. What the\r\nConstitution had not granted they would be bound, if necessary, to\r\nassume; and even if the Constitution stood in the way, they would be\r\nbound to go over it in order to save the national existence. It is one\r\nof those cases in which necessity gives sovereign right. It is doubtless\r\na very illegal thing to blow up people's houses, yet what civic\r\nmagistrate, not a fool, would hesitate to do it when nothing else could\r\narrest the conflagration of a city; and what court of law is there\r\n(outside of _Liliput_, where poor Gulliver was condemned to death for\r\nsaving the royal palace by an illegal fire engine) so foolish as to\r\nsustain an action against the magistrate in such a case? What must be\r\nthought, then, of the good sense and loyalty of those who would\r\ninterpose the Constitution to prevent the suppression of a gigantic\r\nrebellion, which puts the Constitution, the Government, and the national\r\nexistence in imminent peril of destruction? Who, that knows anything\r\nwhich a man of decent intelligence is bound to know, but knows that\r\n'_the salvation of the republic is the supreme law_?' On this principle\r\nthe old Revolutionary Congress went, when, without a particle of\r\ndelegated warrant from the several States, it assumed to act for the\r\nwhole people as a nation, and, among other things, invested Washington\r\nwith nearly dictatorial powers to carry on the war--a principle that\r\nWashington had already before acted on in more than one case of summary\r\ndealing with the Tories of his day. The sovereign sense of the nation\r\nsustained this assumption, and gave it the validity of supreme law. And\r\nI believe the nation would now sustain the Government in the assumption\r\nof any powers necessary to the putting down of the rebellion, even if\r\nample powers were not already granted in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHistory has no record of a conspiracy more treasonable, flagitious, and\r\ninfamous than that in which this rebellion originated; no record of a\r\nrebellion more foul, more monstrous, more wicked. The great heart of the\r\nnation is filled with just indignation and abhorrence. It understands\r\nand feels that every consideration of national interest and welfare, of\r\nnational honor and dignity, of justice, and fidelity to the great trust\r\nreceived from the fathers of the republic, alike forbid the nation to\r\nconsent to its own dismemberment, or to a compromise with rebels in\r\narms, and a surrender of the great principles involved in the\r\ncontest--principles which lie at the foundation not only of our national\r\nGovernment, but of all government, and all political order. It\r\nunderstands and feels that the preservation of the national Government,\r\nand of all the sacred interests bound up with it, is a necessity for the\r\nnation, is the one grand paramount obligation now resting upon it. Its\r\nstern determination is to carry on this war, at all costs and all\r\nhazards, so long as there is a rebel in arms. Hundreds of loyal leaders\r\nof the people--statesmen and jurists of the highest eminence, Southern\r\nborn as well as Northern born--have said, and only articulated the great\r\nvoice of the nation when they have said: '_Constitution or no\r\nConstitution, put down the rebellion, and save the national existence.\r\nTime enough then to inquire whether it was done under the Constitution,\r\nor outside of it, or over it._'\r\n\r\nAt the same time the people believe that the Constitution gives the\r\nGovernment ample powers to put down the rebellion, as they have also\r\ngiven it unlimited resources of men and money. It would not be true to\r\nsay that they have always been satisfied with the progress and success\r\nof the Government in the use of these powers and resources. There was\r\ndoubtless a time when the public feeling demanded a more clear and\r\ndecisive policy, and more vigor in the prosecution of the war. The\r\npeople would like to have had the whole military system of the country\r\nrevised and made more perfect. They would be better pleased if measures\r\nhad been seasonably taken by which we might have had a well-organized\r\nand well-drilled army of reserve, two hundred thousand strong.\r\nAppreciating, however, the circumstances of the country at the opening\r\nof the war, the gigantic magnitude of the rebellion, and the immensity\r\nand complication of the problems pressing on the Administration, they\r\nhave on the whole been disposed to be patient and trustful. And as long\r\nas they believe there is an honest, earnest purpose in the\r\nAdministration to extinguish the rebellion by force of arms, they will\r\nsustain it. What they would do if ever they should come to the\r\nconviction that the national existence is in peril through incapacity,\r\nselfish personal ambitions or treachery on the part of the\r\nAdministration, it is not necessary to predict. The conjuncture is not\r\nlikely to arrive. Of one thing, however, you may be sure: the great\r\nloyal body of the nation have no quarrel with Congress or with the\r\nAdministration for any of the measures that are the objects of\r\ndenunciation by you and your associates, and they hold the men who utter\r\nthese denunciations to be worse enemies to their country than the rebels\r\nin arms--morally far worse than the great mass of the misguided\r\nfollowers of the rebel chiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: A considerable portion of your letter is taken up with a\r\ndiscussion of the rebel Vice-President Stephen's declaration touching\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIn his speech at Savannah, Mr. Stephens, speaking of the new Government\r\nwhich the rebels had set up, says: 'Its foundations are laid, its corner\r\nstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the\r\nwhite man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his\r\nnatural and moral condition.'\r\n\r\nOne would think this was clear enough, and that it was doing no\r\ninjustice to its substantial purport to say that Mr. Stephens here makes\r\nslavery the corner stone of his new Government. You say, however, that\r\nthis is 'an egregious misapprehension,' that '_he has made no such\r\ndeclaration_.' 'Let us learn' (you go on) 'what he actually did say. His\r\nlanguage is this: 'The foundations of our new Government are laid, its\r\ncorner stone rests upon'--what? slavery? no--'upon the _great truth_\r\nthat _the negro is not equal to the white man_, that slavery,' which he\r\nthen defines to be 'subordination to the superior race, is his natural\r\nand moral condition.''\r\n\r\nThis is nice! How admirably your _italic_ emphasis upon the first\r\nclause, your intercalated comments, and the slight way of bringing in\r\nthe second clause, serves to bring out the full, undivided force of the\r\nwhole sentence! What a charming union of acuteness and moral nobleness\r\nit exhibits! Equally admirable for the same qualities is your\r\ndistinction between basing a government upon _slavery_ and basing it\r\nupon a _great truth_ about slavery. Mr. Stephens has said that the\r\ncorner stone of his new Government rests upon the _great truth_ that\r\nslavery is the natural and moral condition of the negro. He has not,\r\ntherefore, said that it rests on _slavery_! And so you think yourself\r\njustified, do you, in your emphatic assertion that 'he has made no such\r\ndeclaration'? You stand impregnable and triumphant--on the words! You\r\nstick to what is 'nominated in the bond'--the very Shylock of criticism!\r\n\r\nBut not satisfied with this, you strengthen the case by argument: Mr.\r\nStephens did not say so, or mean so, because he would have been very\r\nfoolish if he had--so must every one be that thinks he did. Mr.\r\nStephens's 'language' (you say) 'could not be applied to slavery; it\r\nwould be a strange misapplication of terms to call slavery a physical,\r\nphilosophical, and moral truth.' But irresistible as your logic is, did\r\nyou really suppose that the 'plain men' who (according to your motto) in\r\ntroubled times like these 'read pamphlets,' were any of them so stupid\r\nas to think that your wonderful distinction amounts to anything? Did you\r\nsuppose any man of decent intelligence would fail to see that it makes\r\nno practical difference--since slavery, as an institution, was to be the\r\ninevitable consequence of the _great truth_ about it--and that therefore\r\nMr. Stephens's declaration amounts substantially to saying that slavery\r\nwas to be the corner stone of his new Government; and so your assertion,\r\nthat 'he has made no such declaration,' is a paltry verbal quibble,\r\nunworthy of a sensible and fair-minded man.\r\n\r\nSo of your way of proving that the rebel Government have adopted no such\r\ncorner stone. It is like yourself, and unparalleled but by yourself.\r\nFirst, you allege that even if Mr. Stephens had said so, his individual\r\nassertion is no law for the Government; next, that 'there is not one\r\nword in the Constitution of the Confederacy that gives color to any such\r\nidea as slavery being the corner stone of their Government; on the\r\ncontrary, section ix, article i, _clearly repudiates it_.' You did not\r\nquote the article you refer to. Your 'plain men,' when they come to see\r\nit, will perhaps have an opinion on the question why you did not. The\r\narticle is as follows: '_The importation of African negroes from any\r\nforeign country other than the slaveholding States of the United States,\r\nin hereby forbidden, and Congress is required to pass such laws as shall\r\neffectually prevent the same._'\r\n\r\nNow did you really think that this article 'clearly repudiates' the idea\r\nof the rebels intending to have slavery for one of their fundamental\r\ninstitutions, or did you presume on the ignorance or stupidity of those\r\nyou have undertaken to instruct in political knowledge? The article\r\nitself contains no such repudiation, nor is there anything to warrant\r\nyour inference that such was its purport, and everybody that knows\r\nanything about it, knows that it is a gross misrepresentation of its\r\nreal object to say so.\r\n\r\nThe rebel Constitution was framed by delegates from the seven Lower\r\nSlave States. It was adopted February 8, 1861. Neither Tennessee nor\r\nVirginia nor any of the Border States had then joined the rebel\r\nConfederacy. Most of these States were opposed to the reopening of the\r\nAfrican slave trade from principle and sentiment. The material interests\r\nof Virginia were strongly opposed to it. The staple product of Virginia\r\nwas slaves. She lived only by breeding negroes for the market of the\r\nslave-consuming States of the Lower South. To reopen the African slave\r\ntrade would destroy the profits of her great staple. The price of\r\nnegroes would go down from _one thousand_ dollars to _two hundred_. It\r\nwas well known, however, that there had been for several years a clamor\r\nin the Lower States for the repeal of the law of the Union prohibiting\r\nthe African slave trade, that the determination to have the trade\r\nreopened '_in the Union or out of the Union_' had been publicly\r\nproclaimed in South Carolina, and that the matter of demanding it from\r\nthe Congress of the Union had been before the Legislature of that State,\r\non the recommendation of the Governor, three or four years before the\r\nbreaking out of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the rebel Constitution was framed. And however\r\nimportant to the slave-buying interest of its framers and of the people\r\nthey assumed to represent, the opening of the African slave trade may\r\nhave been felt to be, it was felt to be far more important at that\r\ncrisis to secure the accession of Virginia and the Border States to the\r\nrebel cause by prohibiting it. Hence the adoption of the article you\r\nrefer to without quoting, and of the next very significant article,\r\nwhich you neither quote nor refer to: '_Congress shall also have power\r\nto prohibit the importation of slaves from any State not a member of\r\nthis Confederacy._' The first of these articles, prohibiting the African\r\nslave trade, is a guarantee to the interests of the slave breeders if\r\nthey join the Confederacy; and the second a threat, that if they do not\r\njoin it, they may have no benefit from the prohibition in the first. Yet\r\nknowing all this, or bound to know it, you represent the prohibition of\r\nthe African slave trade in the rebel Constitution as a 'clear\r\nrepudiation' of the idea of slavery being intended to be a fundamental\r\ninstitution under their Government! Shame on you! It is a thousand miles\r\naway from having any such meaning or purpose; and I confess I am utterly\r\nunable to conceive how any man of decent intelligence could in good\r\nfaith make the representation you do. _Suppressio veri, allegatio\r\nfalsi._\r\n\r\nBesides, what object could you have? You vindicate the doctrine, 'the\r\ngreat truth,' by which (according to you, as according to Mr. Stephens)\r\nslavery as an institution is justified. You approve of slavery, or, as\r\nMr. Stephens euphistically terms it, the 'subordination of the negro to\r\nthe superior race.' You know that slavery _is_ a fundamental institution\r\nin the rebel scheme. Why then take pains to produce a contrary\r\nimpression, by resorting to such futile distinctions, such wretched\r\nquibbles, and such absurd logic? It seems to me nothing but a mania for\r\nverbal distinctions and sophistical special pleas can explain such a\r\ngratuitous self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nOr is it, possibly, that you thought you could persuade your 'plain men\r\nwho read pamphlets,' that in virtue of the sweet euphuism,\r\n'subordination to the superior race,' negro slavery at the South was in\r\nsome way to be divinely transformed, and, though called slavery, was not\r\nin fact to be slavery after the old former fashion? '_Subordination to\r\nthe superior race_'! It certainly merits the praise of Mr. Justice\r\n_Shallow_: 'It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said indeed,\r\ntoo; ... and it is good, yea, indeed is it: good phrases are surely, and\r\never were, very commendable. Very good; a good phrase!'\r\n\r\nBut _you_ knew it was to be the _same sort of subordination_ that has\r\nalways prevailed at the South. What is that? It is a subordination that\r\nis legally determined as follows: 'Slaves shall be deemed, held, taken,\r\nreputed, and adjudged in law to be '_chattels personal_ in the hands of\r\ntheir owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators, and\r\nassigns, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatever.' (South\r\nCarolina Laws, 2 Brevard's Digest, 229.) 'A slave is one who is in the\r\nfull power of a master to whom he belongs. The master may sell him,\r\ndispose of his person, his industry, and his labor. He can do nothing,\r\npossess nothing, nor acquire anything but what must belong to his\r\nmaster.' (Louisiana Civil Code, art. 35.) 'The slave is entirely subject\r\nto the will of his master.' (Idem, art. 173.)\r\n\r\nThis is the legal condition of the slave--the same in all the\r\nslaveholding States. The laws and decisions resting upon this principle\r\nof chattelhood and absolute ownership and dominion are too numerous to\r\ncite. They may be summed up in the words of Judge Crenshaw (1 Stewart's\r\nAla. Rep., 320): '_the slave has no civil rights_.' It is matter of\r\nsettled law, that he can make no contract; cannot form a legal marriage;\r\ncannot constitute a family--husbands and wives, parents and children,\r\nbeing liable (except in Louisiana) to be sold apart; cannot protect his\r\nwife's or daughter's chastity against the master's will; has no right of\r\nself-defence, but may be lawfully killed for resisting or striking his\r\nmaster or (in some States) any white man; has no appeal from his master;\r\ncan bring no action; cannot testify in courts; has no right to\r\neducation, but teaching him to read and write is penally prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe laws do not pretend to recognize and protect him as a person, except\r\nagainst murder and excessive cruelty; and these laws are nullified if\r\nthe master take care to kill or torture him apart from the presence of\r\nwhite witnesses; and even if there be legal witnesses, the murderer or\r\ntorturer can seldom be brought to punishment. 'A cruel and unreasonable\r\nbattery' on a slave by the master or hirer is _not indictable_. This is\r\nJudge Ruffin's decision. (2 Devereux's N.C. Rep., 265). This decision is\r\ncelebrated for the language in which it is announced, and the grounds on\r\nwhich it is rested.\r\n\r\n'_The power of the master_,' says the Judge, '_must be absolute to\r\nrender the submission, of the slave perfect_. I most freely confess my\r\nsense of the harshness of this proposition. I feel it as deeply as any\r\nman can. And as a principle of moral right, every person in his\r\nretirement must repudiate it. But in the actual condition of things it\r\nmust be so. There is no remedy. This discipline belongs to the state of\r\nslavery. They cannot be disunited without abrogating at once the rights\r\nof the master, and absolving the slave from his subjection. It\r\nconstitutes the curse of slavery to both the bond and the free portion\r\nof our population. But it is _inherent in the relation_ of master and\r\nslave. That there may be particular instances of cruelty and deliberate\r\nbarbarity where, in conscience, the law might properly interfere, is\r\nmost probable. The difficulty is to determine where _a court_ may\r\nproperly begin. Merely in the abstract, it may well be asked which power\r\nof the master accords with right. The answer will probably sweep away\r\nall of them. But we cannot look at the matter in this light. The truth\r\nis we are forbidden to enter on a train of general reasoning on the\r\nsubject. _We cannot allow the right of the master to be brought into\r\ndiscussion in the courts of justice. The slave, to remain a slave, must\r\nbe made sensible that there is no appeal from his master, that his power\r\nis, in no instance, usurped, but is conferred by the laws of man, at\r\nleast, if not by the laws of God._'\r\n\r\nSuch is slavery under the slave code. Men are sometimes better and\r\nsometimes worse than their laws. We need not wonder that volumes might\r\nbe filled with recitals of cruelties and atrocities of torture, ending,\r\nin many cases, only with the death of the victim. Nor need we wonder at\r\nthe more loathsome moral abominations so prevalent in Southern society,\r\nwhich degrade the whites even more than the blacks--of children begotten\r\nby masters upon the persons of their slave women--begotten in lust and\r\nsold for gain; of beautiful quadroons and octoroons sought and bought\r\nfor the base pleasure of their owners; of families, where the lawful\r\nwives and daughters of the master are served by slaves that are their\r\nown uncles, brothers, or sisters, born of slave women, yielding to the\r\nmaster's lustful will. _Amalgamation is a Southern, not a Northern taste\r\nand practice._ The most abominable case that has recently come to light,\r\nis that of the young slave mother, at New Orleans, of whose children her\r\nown father (a rich rebel) was the father! All these things are\r\ninevitably incident to a state of slavery, and there is no law against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuch is slavery--such is the institution you advocate as divinely\r\nordered, under the soft phrase, '_subordination to the superior race_'!\r\nAnd this is the way you speak of those whom you term radical\r\nAbolitionists: 'Look at the dark conclave of conspirators,\r\nfreedom-shriekers, Bible-spurners, fierce, implacable, headstrong,\r\ndenunciatory, Constitution and Union haters, noisy, factious, breathing\r\nforth threatenings and slaughter against all who venture a difference of\r\nopinion from them, murderous, passionate advocates of imprisonments and\r\nhangings, blood-thirsty,--and if there be any other epithet in the\r\nvocabulary of wickedness, do they not every one fitly designate some\r\nphase of radical Abolitionism?'\r\n\r\nI cannot help fancying that it will occur to some that by substituting\r\n_slavery-shriekers_ and _Bible-perverters_ in this sentence, it might at\r\nleast equally well describe Northern pro-slavery zealots. At any rate,\r\nyour language is the very extravagance of coarse pro-slavery fanaticism.\r\nI have never been of mind with those you term radical Abolitionists; but\r\nit seems to me that of the two fanaticisms, the anti-slavery fanaticism\r\nis the most respectable in principle, less selfish, and more generous in\r\nimpulse. I have all my life been disposed to leave the South in\r\nundisturbed possession of its constitutional pound of slavery flesh. But\r\nwhen the slaveholders showed an inveterate determination not to be\r\ncontent with that, but to _nationalize_ slavery, to carry it everywhere,\r\nand to make it the great element of political control throughout the\r\nnation, I felt no constitutional obligation to submit. And when the\r\nconspirators, foiled in their designs, rushed into open rebellion, I\r\nmade up my mind that slavery had best be destroyed--for only when it is,\r\nwill the conditions of true unity between the South and the North begin\r\nto exist--then only will the prosperity and peace of the nation be\r\nestablished on a permanent basis. This is now the opinion of a great\r\nmany of the best and wisest men at the South. I believe that slavery\r\nwill be destroyed in the progress and sequel of this war--to the\r\nultimate incalculable advantage of the South.\r\n\r\nOne word more: You have seen fit to quote Burke and Milton, for the sake\r\nof a fling at the _clergy_ who venture to discuss the questions of the\r\nday. I do not know how far some of your associates will be disposed to\r\nthank you. Perhaps their being on your side gives them a capacity not\r\npossessed by the others, and exempts them from the application of your\r\nrebuke. I have an impression that the culture and habits of thinking of\r\nthe members of the clerical profession do not particularly unfit them\r\nfor taking just and sound views on the questions that agitate the public\r\nmind, and that their position--cutting them off from all offices and\r\nemoluments that are the objects of ambition to party politicians--gives\r\nthem some special advantages for doing so. For myself, having all my\r\nlife been devoted to study and thought on the great principles of social\r\nand moral order, I feel myself as well qualified, at least, to offer an\r\nopinion, as though I had been devoted to the mechanical application of\r\nthe principles of physical science.\r\n\r\n  C. S. HENRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKLE, DRAPER, AND THE LAW OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n_FIRST PAPER._\r\n\r\n\r\nSo parallel are the lines of thought in Mr. Buckle's 'History of\r\nCivilization' and Professor Draper's 'Intellectual Development of\r\nEurope,' while they continue within the same limits in discussing the\r\nlaw of individual and social progress; and so exactly does the latter\r\nwork resume the consideration of this law at the point where the English\r\nwriter abandoned its further analysis, to commence to apply that which\r\nhe had made to the history of various nations, that one might almost\r\nsuppose the two authors had undertaken the task conjointly, and divided\r\nthe work between them.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of Mr. Buckle, in his introduction, to ascertain the\r\nsources of social, and, incidentally, of individual development--the\r\nfundamental causes of human progression; and subsequently to verify the\r\nprinciples established, by tracing, in general outlines, the rise and\r\nadvance of leading nations under their impulse. The basis upon which he\r\nstarted in his examination was this: 'That when we perform an action, we\r\nperform it in consequence of some motive or motives; that those motives\r\nare the results of some antecedents; and that, therefore, if we were\r\nacquainted with the whole of the antecedents, and with all the laws of\r\ntheir movements, we could with unerring certainty predict the whole of\r\ntheir immediate results.'\r\n\r\nFrom this proposition the historian concludes 'that the actions of men,\r\nbeing determined solely by their antecedents, must, under precisely the\r\nsame circumstances, always issue in precisely the same results. And as\r\nall antecedents are either in the mind or out of it, we clearly see that\r\nall the variations in the results--in other words, all the changes of\r\nwhich history is full, all the vicissitudes of the human race, their\r\nprogress or their decay, their happiness or their misery--must be the\r\nfruit of a double action; an action of external phenomena upon the mind,\r\nand another action of the mind upon the phenomena.'\r\n\r\nMr. Buckle gives it as the result of his investigations concerning the\r\nrelative influence of these two agencies: That external or physical laws\r\nhave been most powerful in the earlier ages of the world, and among the\r\nmost ignorant nations; that in proportion as knowledge increases, the\r\npower of this class of agencies diminishes, and that of mental laws\r\nbecomes more predominant; that these latter are therefore the great\r\nmotor forces of civilization, consisting of two parts, the moral and the\r\nintellectual, of which the latter are vastly superior as instruments of\r\nsocial advancement, stationary in their effects; finally, as the formal\r\nstatement of the laws of human development, he says:\r\n\r\n     '1st. That the progress of mankind depends on the success with\r\n     which the laws of phenomena are investigated, and on the extent to\r\n     which a knowledge of those laws is diffused. 2d. That before such\r\n     investigation can begin, a spirit of scepticism must arise, which,\r\n     at first aiding the investigation, is afterward aided by it. 3d.\r\n     That the discoveries thus made increase the influence of\r\n     intellectual truths, and diminish, relatively, not absolutely, the\r\n     influence of moral truths; moral truths being more stationary than\r\n     intellectual truths, and receiving fewer additions. 4th. That the\r\n     great enemy of this movement, and therefore the great enemy of\r\n     civilization, is the protective spirit--the notion that society\r\n     cannot prosper, unless the affairs of life are watched over and\r\n     protected at nearly every turn by the state and the church; the\r\n     state teaching men what they are to do, and the church teaching\r\n     them what they are to believe.'\r\n\r\nIn all these points the recent work of Professor Draper coincides with\r\nthat of the lamented English writer. The main object of the former is,\r\nhowever, to discuss a question more basic than those undertaken by the\r\nauthor of 'Civilization in England,' the consideration of which was by\r\nhim formally declined: namely, the question of a predetermined order of\r\ndevelopment lying back of all physical and mental phenomena. The opening\r\nsentences of the American book will sufficiently indicate the purpose of\r\nits pages:\r\n\r\n     'I intend, in this work, to consider in what manner the advancement\r\n     of Europe in civilization has taken place, to ascertain how far its\r\n     progress has been fortuitous, and how far determined by primordial\r\n     law.\r\n\r\n     'Does the procession of nations in time, like the erratic phantasm\r\n     of a dream, go forward without reason or order? Or, is there a\r\n     predetermined, a solemn march, in which all must join, ever moving,\r\n     ever resistlessly advancing, encountering and enduring an\r\n     inevitable succession of events?\r\n\r\n     'In a philosophical examination of the intellectual and political\r\n     history of nations, an answer to these questions is to be found.\r\n     * * * Man is the archetype of society. Individual development is the\r\n     model of social progress.'\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient for our present purpose to indicate the line of\r\nDr. Draper's argument, in seeking for a solution to the problem of\r\nprogress, and to sum up the conclusions to which he is ultimately led by\r\nhis investigations.\r\n\r\nIn the intellectual infancy of a savage state, man regards all passing\r\nevents as depending on the arbitrary volition of a superior but\r\ninvisible power. The tendency is necessarily to superstition. After\r\nreason, aided by experience, has led him forth from these delusions as\r\nrespects surrounding things, he still clings to his original ideas as\r\nrespects objects far removed, believing the stars to be inhabited by\r\nmysterious powers, or to be such themselves. Gradually he emerges from\r\nstar worship as he did from fetichism, still venerating and perhaps\r\nexalting into immortal gods the genii whom he once supposed to inhabit\r\nthe stars, long after he has ascertained that the latter are without any\r\nperceptible influence on him.\r\n\r\nHe is exchanging, by ascending degrees, his primitive doctrine of\r\narbitrary volition for the doctrine of law. As the fall of a stone, the\r\nflowing of a river, and the ordinary operations of nature familiar to\r\nhim have been traced to physical causes, to like causes are at last\r\ntraced the revolutions of the stars. In events and scenes continually\r\nincreasing in greatness and grandeur, he is detecting the dominion of\r\nlaw. This perception is extended, until at last it embraces all natural\r\nevents, until they are seen to be the consequences of physical\r\nconditions, and therefore the results of law.\r\n\r\n     'But if we admit that this is the case, from the mote that floats\r\n     in the sunbeam to multiple stars revolving round each other, are we\r\n     willing to carry our principles to their consequences, and\r\n     recognize a like operation of law among living as among lifeless\r\n     things, in the organic as well as the inorganic world? What\r\n     testimony does physiology offer on this point?'\r\n\r\nPhysiology, in its progress, has passed through the same stages as\r\nphysics. Living beings were once considered to be beyond the power of\r\nexternal influences, the various physiological functions being carried\r\nforward by a feigned immaterial principle, called the vital agent. But\r\nwhen it was discovered that the heart is constructed upon the recognized\r\nrules of hydraulics; the eye upon the most refined principles of optics;\r\nthat the ear was furnished with the means of dealing with the three\r\ncharacteristics of sound--its tympanum for intensity, its cochlea for\r\npitch, and its semicircular canals for quality; and that the air,\r\nbrought into the great air passages, calling into play atmospheric\r\npressure, was conveyed upon physical principles into the ultimate cells\r\nof the lungs, and thence to the blood; when these and very many other\r\nlike facts were brought into prominence by modern research, it became\r\nnecessary to admit that animated beings do not constitute the exception\r\nonce supposed, and that organic operations are the result of physical\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n     'If thus, in the recesses of the individual economy, these natural\r\n     agents bear sway, must they not operate in the social economy too?\r\n\r\n     'Has the great, shadeless desert nothing to do with the habits of\r\n     the nomade tribes who pitch their tents upon it--the fertile plain\r\n     no connection with flocks and pastoral life--the mountain\r\n     fastnesses with the courage that has so often defended them--the\r\n     sea with habits of adventure? Indeed, do not all our expectations\r\n     of the stability of social institutions rest upon our belief in the\r\n     stability of surrounding physical conditions? From the time of\r\n     Bodin, who nearly three hundred years ago published his work 'De\r\n     Republica,' these principles have been well recognized: that the\r\n     laws of nature cannot be subordinated to the will of man, and that\r\n     government must be adapted to climate. It was these things which\r\n     led to the conclusion that force is best resorted to for northern\r\n     nations, reason for the middle, and superstition for the southern.'\r\n\r\nThe importance of physical agents and physical laws in the social as\r\nwell as in the individual economy, is variously illustrated by Professor\r\nDraper, who points out the essential part they play in several\r\ndepartments of nature. To the merely mechanical inclination of the\r\nearth's axis of rotation toward the plane of her orbit of revolution\r\naround the sun, we owe the changing seasons and the method of life which\r\nis dependent on these. The alteration of that physical arrangement would\r\ninvolve a corresponding alteration in the whole life of the globe. So,\r\nagain, the possibility of existence upon the earth, in any way, depends\r\nupon conditions altogether of a material kind. It is necessary that our\r\nplanet should be at a definite mean distance from the source of light\r\nand heat, the sun; and that the form of her orbit should be almost a\r\ncircle, since it is only within a narrow range of temperature, secured\r\nby these conditions, that life can be maintained.\r\n\r\nIt is through natural agents also that the means of regulation are\r\nsecured in the present economy of the globe. Through heat, the\r\ndistribution and arrangement of the vegetable tribes are accomplished;\r\nthrough their mutual relations with the atmospheric air, plants and\r\nanimals are interbalanced, and neither permitted to obtain a\r\nsuperiority. The condensation of carbon from the air and its inclusion\r\nin the strata constitute the chief epoch in the organic life of the\r\nearth giving a possibility for the appearance of the hot-blooded and\r\nmore intellectual animal tribes. That event was due to the influence of\r\nthe rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nPassing from inorganic to organic forms, our author remarks that their\r\npermanence is altogether dependent 'on the invariability of the material\r\nconditions under which they live. Any variation therein, no matter how\r\ninsignificant it might be, would be forthwith followed by a\r\ncorresponding variation in the form.' At this point we are brought to\r\nthe far-famed 'development theory,' which, since the publication of the\r\n'Vestiges of Creation,' has been the scientific battle field of the\r\nnaturalists of the world. Professor Draper is, of course, a firm\r\nadherent of this theory. He continues:\r\n\r\n     'The present invariability of the world of organization is the\r\n     direct consequence of the physical equilibrium, and so it will\r\n     continue as long as the mean temperature, the annual supply of\r\n     light, the composition of the air, the distribution of water,\r\n     oceanic and atmospheric currents, and other such agencies, remain\r\n     unaltered; but if any one of these, or of a hundred other incidents\r\n     that might be mentioned, should suffer modification, in an instant\r\n     the fanciful doctrine of the immutability of species would be\r\n     brought to its true value. The organic world appears to be in\r\n     repose, because natural influences have reached an equilibrium. A\r\n     marble may remain forever motionless upon a level table; but let\r\n     the surface be a little inclined, and the marble will quickly run\r\n     off. What should we say of him who, contemplating it in its state\r\n     of rest, asserted that it was impossible for it ever to move?\r\n\r\n     'When, therefore, we notice such orderly successions, we must not\r\n     at once assign them to a direct intervention, the issue of wise\r\n     predeterminations of a voluntary agent; we must first satisfy\r\n     ourselves how far they are dependent upon mundane or material\r\n     conditions, occurring in a definite and necessary series, ever\r\n     bearing in mind the important principle that an orderly sequence of\r\n     inorganic events necessarily involves an orderly and corresponding\r\n     progression of organic life.\r\n\r\n     'To this doctrine of the control of physical agencies over organic\r\n     forms I acknowledge no exceptions, not even in the case of man. The\r\n     varied aspects he presents in different countries are the necessary\r\n     consequences of those influences.'\r\n\r\nWhether we advocate the doctrine of the origination of the human race\r\nfrom a single pair, or from different races at different centres, we\r\nare, in Dr. Draper's judgment, alike driven to the conclusion of the\r\ntransitory nature of typical forms, to their transmutations and\r\nextinctions. In the former case, we can only account for diverse races,\r\nhaving different shades of complexion, different varieties of skull,\r\netc., by the admission of the paramount control of physical agents, such\r\nas climate and other purely material circumstances; in the latter, we\r\ncan only account for the varieties visible among the different races\r\nthemselves on similar grounds.\r\n\r\nVariations in the aspect of man are best seen when an examination is\r\nmade of nations arranged in a northerly and southerly direction, the\r\ndifferences of climate being much greater in this direction than from\r\neast to west. These variations do not affect complexion, development of\r\nthe brain, and, therefore, intellectual power, only. But differences of\r\nmanners and customs, that is, differences in the modes of civilization,\r\nmust coexist with diversities of climate. An ethnical element is\r\ntherefore necessarily of a dependent nature; its durability arises from\r\nits perfect correspondence with the conditions by which it is\r\nsurrounded. Whatever can affect that correspondence will touch its life.\r\n\r\nWith such considerations the author passes from individuals to groups of\r\nmen or nations:\r\n\r\n     'There is a progress for races of men as well marked as the\r\n     progress of one man. There are thoughts and actions appertaining to\r\n     specific periods in the one case as in the other. Without\r\n     difficulty we affirm of a given act that it appertains to a given\r\n     period. We recognize the noisy sports of boyhood, the business\r\n     application of maturity, the feeble garrulity of old age. We\r\n     express our surprise when we witness actions unsuitable to the\r\n     epoch of life. As it is in this respect in the individual, so it is\r\n     in the nation. The march of individual existence shadows forth the\r\n     march of race existence, being, indeed, its representative on a\r\n     little scale. Groups of men, or nations, are distributed by the\r\n     same accidents, or complete the same cycle as the individual. Some\r\n     scarcely pass beyond infancy; some are destroyed on a sudden; some\r\n     die of mere old age. In this confusion of events, it might seem\r\n     altogether hopeless to disentangle the law which is guiding them\r\n     all, and demonstrate it clearly. Of such groups each may exhibit,\r\n     at the same moment, an advance to a different stage, just as we see\r\n     in the same family the young, the middle aged, and the old. * * *\r\n     In each nation, moreover, the contemporaneously different classes,\r\n     the educated and illiterate, the idle and industrious, the rich and\r\n     poor, the intelligent and superstitious, represent different\r\n     contemporaneous stages of advancement. One may have made a great\r\n     progress, another scarcely have advanced at all. How shall we\r\n     ascertain the real state of the case? Which of these classes shall\r\n     we regard as the truest and most perfect type?'\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with this problem, and to demonstrate the general\r\nnature of a movement having such diverse components, we must, continues\r\nProfessor Draper, select, from a family or a nation, or a family of many\r\nnations, such members or classes or states as most closely represent\r\nrespectively its type or have advanced most completely in their career.\r\nIn a state the leading or intellectual class is always the true\r\nrepresentative. It has passed gradually through the lower stages, and\r\nhas made the greatest advance.\r\n\r\nWe are next called to notice that individual life is maintained only by\r\nthe production and destruction of organic particles, death being\r\nnecessarily the condition of life; and that a similar process occurs in\r\nthe existence of a nation, in which the individual represents the\r\norganic molecule, whose production, continuance, and death in the\r\nperson, answers to the production, continuance, and death of a person in\r\nthe state. In the same manner that individuals change through the action\r\nof physical agencies and submit to impressions, so likewise do\r\naggregates of men constituting nations. 'A national type pursues its way\r\nphysically and intellectually through changes and developments answering\r\nto those of the individual, and being represented by infancy, childhood,\r\nyouth, manhood, old age, and death, respectively.'\r\n\r\nThis orderly process may, however, be disturbed by emigration, by blood\r\nadmixture, or by other exterior or interior occurrences, which would\r\ninvolve a corresponding change in the national characteristics and\r\nduration; perhaps result in the rapid and total disappearance of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nFor--and this brings us to the last point of analogy which Professor\r\nDraper gives between individual and national life--nations, like\r\nindividuals, die. Empires are only sandhills in the hourglass of Time;\r\nthey crumble spontaneously away by the process of their own growth.\r\n\r\n     'A nation, like a man, hides from itself the contemplation of its\r\n     final day. It occupies itself with expedients for prolonging its\r\n     present state. It frames laws and constitutions under the delusion\r\n     that they will last, forgetting that the condition of life is\r\n     change. Very able modern statesmen consider it to be the grand\r\n     object of their art to keep things as they are, or rather as they\r\n     were. But the human race is not at rest; and bands with which, for\r\n     a moment, it may be restrained, break all the more violently the\r\n     longer they hold. No man can stop the march of destiny. * * * The\r\n     origin, existence, and death of nations depend thus on physical\r\n     influences, which are themselves the result of immutable laws.\r\n     Nations are only transitional forms of humanity. They must undergo\r\n     obliteration as do the transitional forms offered by the animal\r\n     series. There is no more an immortality for an embryo in any one of\r\n     the manifold forms passed through in its progress of development.\r\n\r\n     'We must, therefore, no longer regard nations or groups of men as\r\n     offering a permanent picture. Human affairs must be looked upon as\r\n     in continuous movement, not wandering in an arbitrary manner here\r\n     and there, but proceeding in a perfectly definite course. Whatever\r\n     may be the present state, it is altogether transient. All systems\r\n     of civil life are therefore necessarily ephemeral. Time brings new\r\n     conditions; the manner of thought is modified; with thought,\r\n     action. Institutions of all kinds must hence participate in this\r\n     fleeting nature; and, though they may have allied themselves to\r\n     political power, and gathered therefrom the means of coercion,\r\n     their permanency is but little improved thereby; for, sooner or\r\n     later, the population on whom they have been imposed, following the\r\n     external variations, spontaneously outgrows them, and their ruin,\r\n     though it may have been delayed, is none the less certain. For the\r\n     permanency of any such system it is essentially necessary that it\r\n     should include with its own organization a law of change, and not\r\n     of change only, but change in the right direction--the direction in\r\n     which the society interested is about to pass. It is in an\r\n     oversight of this last essential condition that we find an\r\n     explanation of the failure of so many such institutions. Too\r\n     commonly do we believe that the affairs of men are determined by a\r\n     spontaneous action or free will; we keep that overpowering\r\n     influence which really controls them in the background. In\r\n     individual life we also accept a like deception, living in the\r\n     belief that everything we do is determined by the volition of\r\n     ourselves or of those around us; nor is it until the close of our\r\n     days that we discern how great is the illusion, and that we have\r\n     been swimming, playing, and struggling in a stream which, in spite\r\n     of all our voluntary motions, has silently and resistlessly borne\r\n     us to a predetermined shore.'\r\n\r\nThese lines were written before the commencement of our civil war. The\r\nfollowing sentence, taken from the postscript to the preface, gives\r\nthem, at this time, additional significance:\r\n\r\n     'When a nation has reached one of the epochs of its life, and is\r\n     preparing itself for another period of progress under new\r\n     conditions; it is well for every thoughtful man interested in its\r\n     prosperity to turn his eyes from the contentions of the present to\r\n     the accomplished facts of the past, and to seek for a solution of\r\n     existing difficulties in the record of what other people in former\r\n     times have done.'\r\n\r\nGuided by this law of development, Professor Draper sets out on his task\r\nof investigating the course of European progress. For the purpose of\r\nfacilitating this investigation, he divides the intellectual progress of\r\nthe nations examined, into five periods: 1, The Age of Credulity; 2, The\r\nAge of Inquiry; 3, The Age of Faith; 4, The Age of Reason; 5, The Age of\r\nDecrepitude; corresponding with the five divisions of individual life,\r\nas previously stated, from infancy to old age. The general line of\r\nexamination and its results may be stated by giving the opening\r\nparagraphs of his closing chapter:\r\n\r\n     'The object of this book is to impress upon its reader a conviction\r\n     that civilization does not proceed in an arbitrary manner, or by\r\n     chance, but that it passes through a determinate succession of\r\n     stages, and is a development according to law.\r\n\r\n     'For this purpose we considered the relations between individual\r\n     and social life, and showed that they are physiologically\r\n     inseparable from one another, and that the course of communities\r\n     bears an unmistakable resemblance to the progress of an individual,\r\n     and that man is the archetype or exemplar of society.\r\n\r\n     'We then examined the intellectual history of Greece--a nation\r\n     offering the best and most complete illustration of the life of\r\n     humanity. From the beginning of its mythology in old Indian\r\n     legends, and of its philosophy in Ionia, we saw that it passed\r\n     through phases like those of the individual to its decrepitude and\r\n     death in Alexandria.\r\n\r\n     'Then addressing ourselves to the history of Europe, we found that,\r\n     if suitably divided into groups of ages, these groups, compared\r\n     with each other in chronological succession, present a striking\r\n     resemblance to the successive phases of Greek life, and therefore\r\n     to that which Greek life resembles--that is to say, individual\r\n     life.'\r\n\r\nLooking at the successive phases of individual life, Professor Draper\r\nfinds intellectual advancement to be their chief characteristic. The\r\nanatomist discovers that the human form advances to its highest\r\nperfection through provisions in its nervous structure for intellectual\r\nimprovement. In like manner the physiologist ranks the vast series of\r\nanimals now inhabiting the earth in the order of their intelligence. The\r\ngeologist declares that there has been an orderly improvement in\r\nintellectual power of the beings that have successively inhabited the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe sciences, therefore, join with history, infers Professor Draper, in\r\naffirming that the great aim of nature is intellectual improvement;\r\nintellectual improvement in the individual, and hence, man being the\r\narchetype of society, intellectual advancement in the race.\r\n\r\n     'What, then, is the conclusion inculcated by these doctrines as\r\n     regards the social progress of great communities? It is that all\r\n     political institutions--imperceptibly or visibly, spontaneously or\r\n     purposely--should tend to the improvement and organization of\r\n     national intellect. * * *\r\n\r\n     'A great community, aiming to govern itself by intellect rather\r\n     than by coercion, is a spectacle worthy of admiration. * * * Brute\r\n     force holds communities together as an iron nail binds pieces of\r\n     wood by the compression it makes--a compression depending on the\r\n     force with which it has been hammered in. It also holds more\r\n     tenaciously if a little rusted with age. But intelligence binds\r\n     like a screw. The things it has to unite must be carefully adjusted\r\n     to its thread. It must be gently turned, not driven, and so it\r\n     retains the consenting parts firmly together. * * *\r\n\r\n     'Forms of government, therefore, are of moment, though not in the\r\n     manner commonly supposed. Their value increases in proportion as\r\n     they permit or encourage the natural tendency for development to be\r\n     satisfied.'\r\n\r\nIntellectual freedom should be secured in free countries, adds Dr.\r\nDraper, as completely as the rights of property and personal liberty.\r\nPhilosophical opinions and scientific discoveries are entitled to be\r\njudged of by their truth, not by their relation to existing interests.\r\n\r\n     'There is no literary crime greater than that of exciting a social,\r\n     and especially a theological odium against ideas that are purely\r\n     scientific, none against which the disapproval of every educated\r\n     man ought to be more strongly expressed. The republic of letters\r\n     owes it to its own dignity to tolerate no longer offences of that\r\n     kind.\r\n\r\n     'To an organization of their national intellect, and to giving it a\r\n     political control, the countries of Europe are rapidly advancing.\r\n     They are hastening to satisfy their instinctive tendency. The\r\n     special form in which they will embody their intentions must, of\r\n     course, depend to a great degree on the political forms under which\r\n     they have passed their lives, modified by that approach to\r\n     homogeneousness, which arises from increased intercommunication.'\r\n\r\nIn an all-important particular, concludes Dr. Draper, the prospect of\r\nEurope is bright. It approaches the last stage of civil life through\r\nChristianity. Universal benevolence cannot fail to yield better fruit\r\nthan has been secured in the past. There is a fairer hope for nations\r\nanimated by a sincere religious sentiment, who, whatever their political\r\nhistory may have been, have always agreed in this, that they were\r\ndevout, than for a people who, like the Chinese, now passing through the\r\nlast stage of civil life in the cheerlessness of Buddhism dedicate\r\nthemselves to a selfish pursuit of material advantages, who have lost\r\nall belief in a future, and are living without any God.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe large space given to the statement of the purpose and drift of 'The\r\nIntellectual Development of Europe,' will allow only a brief\r\nconsideration, in this paper, of the two great points presented by its\r\nauthor. These are, the question of the relative value of moral and\r\nintellectual truths in the progress of the human race; and the nature of\r\nthe law of individual and social development. Both Professor Draper and\r\nMr. Buckle affirm, and endeavor to support the affirmation with array of\r\nproof, that intellectual truths are more important and more concerned in\r\nthe march of society, in the advancement of mankind, than moral ones;\r\nand both conclude that the great object of life, its final achievement,\r\nis intellectual culture and mental unfoldment in the individual and in\r\nthe race. To the consideration of these points we will, therefore,\r\ndirect our attention.\r\n\r\nThe social, political, religious, and scientific development of the\r\nworld proceeds under the operation of two grand antagonistic principles.\r\nOne is the principle of Unity. The other that principle which is the\r\nopposite of unity, which we will call Individuality. The first tends to\r\nbring about coöperation, consolidation, convergence, dependence; the\r\nsecond to produce separation, isolation, divergence, and independence.\r\nUnity is the principle which tends to order; Individuality to freedom.\r\nThe desire of order is the animating sentiment of conservatism. The love\r\nof freedom is the vital essence of progress. Unity is the static, and\r\nIndividuality the motic force of human society. Both are inherent in the\r\nnature of things, and equally important as elements of a true social\r\norganization. Unity is allied to the affections, which are synthetic in\r\ntheir character; Individuality, to the intellect, which is mainly\r\nanalytical, critical, and disruptive in its tendency. Unity is\r\npredominant in religion, which is static in its nature; Individuality,\r\nin science, which is primarily disturbing. In the distribution of the\r\nmental faculties, Unity relates to the moral powers, and Individuality\r\nto the intellectual; the former being, as both Mr. Buckle and Professor\r\nDraper have shown, more stationary in their character than the latter.\r\n\r\nUnity is represented in social affairs by the institutions of community\r\nwhich tend to bind the people into a composite whole; Individuality, by\r\nthe personal independence which liberates from the conventionalities of\r\nassociation and creates social freedom. In the religious domain, Unity\r\nis represented by faith, which is allied to the emotional or affectional\r\nnature, and is predominantly concessive, unquestioning, and submissive;\r\nIndividuality, by the spirit of inquiry and investigation, which will\r\nonly believe after intellectual examination and satisfaction. In\r\npolitical affairs, Unity is represented by the principle of leadership,\r\nseen, in its one-sided and imperfect form, in despotic or monarchical\r\nrule; Individuality, by the democratic principle of political equality.\r\nIn science, the two principles have various analogues in different\r\ndepartments. In rational mechanics, unity is analogous to statics, and\r\nindividuality to dynamics. In astronomy, unity to the centripetal, and\r\nindividuality to the centrifugal force. Unity is allied to synthetical,\r\nand individuality to analytical chemistry. It will not be necessary to\r\nspecify further analogies. These two principles are everywhere present\r\nthroughout the universe; and it is through the mutual play of their\r\nopposite drifts, when rightly adjusted and balanced, that harmony is\r\nsecured, as in the revolutions of the planets; while disharmony is the\r\nresult, wherever it exists, of an undue preponderance, either of the\r\ntendency to unity, on the one hand, or of that to disunity or\r\nindividuality, on the other.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of this analysis, looking at the question solely from the\r\nstand point of abstract science, we should affirm that moral truth, as\r\nthe analogue or representative of the principle of unity, and as the\r\nconverging tendency, was exactly the equal and counterpart of\r\nintellectual truth, the analogue of the diverging tendency, represented\r\nby the principle of individuality. To assert the contrary, would be\r\nequivalent to averring that dynamics were more important agencies in\r\nmechanics than statics; that the centrifugal force was more essential to\r\nthe harmonious movements of the heavenly bodies than the centripetal,\r\nbecause the functions of statics and centripetal force are more\r\nstationary in their nature; or that the head was more important than the\r\nheart, which two parts are, in the human organism, the respective\r\nrepresentatives of intellect and affection, the basis of moral power.\r\n\r\nThe truth, in relation to all these particulars, will appear on closer\r\nexamination, if not already shown, to be this: _that the principle of\r\nUnity and the principle of Individuality must everywhere be represented\r\nin proximately equal proportions, in order to effect a just balance of\r\nconditions and to secure practical harmony_. Centralization and freedom\r\nmust everywhere coexist, and be equally operative. Conservatism is as\r\nimportant to society as progress. Conservatism overbalancing progress,\r\ndestroys society by stagnation, blotting out the individuality of the\r\nperson and moulding men into machine-like uniformity; progress\r\npreponderating over conservatism, destroys the community by disrupting\r\nbands of association before new methods are sufficiently understood, and\r\ngiving reins to a liberty whose untutored use can end only in anarchy\r\nand unbridled license. Conservatism and progress, the centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal forces of society, each being equally balanced, will result\r\nin a harmonization of social interests that will cause community to move\r\non its career as evenly as the planet moves in its graceful orbit. So\r\nin every other department, wherever these opposite principles are\r\nequally adjusted by allowing each full play, there results perfect\r\nconsonance and peace. Order and freedom in government; unity and liberty\r\nin church; individuality and mutuality in society; these are the\r\nelements, when alike operative, of security and success in their\r\nrespective domains, in individual and social life.\r\n\r\nTo secure the highest state of civilization, it is therefore essential\r\nthat there should be an equal activity of the intellectual and of the\r\nmoral or (as they may be more appropriately called) the religious\r\nfaculties: religion being, in its broadest sense, devotion--arising from\r\na conscientious feeling of duty or obligation--to that which appears to\r\nthe individual as the highest truth; and the faculties which are active\r\nin the exercise of this devotion being the moral or religious ones.\r\nViewed as a question of abstract science merely, the investigation might\r\nbe arrested at this point, with the conclusion that intellectual and\r\nmoral agencies were both indispensible to the progress of humanity, and\r\nthe right relations of society, and, therefore, equally important\r\nelements of social advancement. Additional proof will be given\r\nincidentally, however, of this general truth, in the consideration of\r\nthe special case of the relative value of these agencies in the past\r\nprogress of the nations.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the development of the world proceeds under the\r\noperation of the antagonistic principles of unity and individuality.\r\nUnity, as a prior idea to individuality, which latter arises from the\r\ndisintegration of that which was formerly one--had, historically, a\r\nprior development. The period of its paramount sway in the first grand\r\ndivision of time stretches from the dawn of history up to about the\r\ntwelfth century, or to the beginning of the revival of learning. The\r\nprinciple of individuality then began to be active, and has guided the\r\nsubsequent progress of civilization. At no time, nor in any nation,\r\nhowever, has either one of these principles been entirely inactive. One\r\nor the other has _preponderated_, and thus given distinct\r\ncharacteristics to its age. It is to these preponderating drifts that\r\nreference is made in the foregoing division, as specially marking\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe opposite tendencies of unity and individuality, and their successive\r\ndevelopment have been somewhat vaguely apprehended by Professor\r\nDraper,--who has not, however, perceived them as _principles_,--and have\r\nfurnished him with the periods into which he arbitrarily divides the\r\nprogressive epochs of social growth. If we change these divisions into\r\ntheir proper order--an order singularly disarranged by this author--we\r\nshall have substantially the representative periods in the historical\r\ndomain, of unity and individuality. The order in which these eras are\r\nplaced in 'The Intellectual Development of Europe' is, 1, Age of\r\nCredulity; 2, Age of Inquiry; 3, Age of Faith; 4, Age of Reason; 5, Age\r\nof Decrepitude. It is evident, however, as partially shown by Mr.\r\nBuckle, that the age of inquiry is uniformly subsequent to the age of\r\nfaith, and immediately precedes the age of reason. Comparing this\r\ndistribution, moreover, with the one given by Dr. Draper of the five\r\nstages of human existence to which he makes it correspond, we find\r\nchildhood given as the age of inquiry, youth of faith, and manhood of\r\nreason. The ages of inquiry and faith should, however, change places, in\r\norder to be congruous. In applying these periods to the history of\r\nGreece, the age of inquiry is made to extend from the rise of philosophy\r\nto the time of Socrates; and the age of faith to comprise the epochs of\r\nSocrates, Plato, and the Skeptics, up to about the time of Aristotle.\r\nBut in any such division as Dr. Draper attempts, the age of faith should\r\nprecede the rise of philosophical speculation, and the age of inquiry\r\nshould include the era of ethical as well as of physical investigation.\r\nIn the application to European history a similar error is made. The age\r\nof inquiry is given as the epoch of the rise of Christianity and the\r\nestablishment of the papal power; then follow the thousand years of the\r\nage of faith, the age of reason beginning a little before the time of\r\nGalileo. The time given to the age of inquiry should have been included\r\nin the age of faith, while the real European age of inquiry is the era\r\nof the restoration of learning, the development of modern languages, the\r\ninvention of printing, and the Reformation, an era which Dr. Draper\r\ndiscusses in a chapter entitled: 'APPROACH TO THE AGE OF REASON IN\r\nEUROPE. _It is preceded by the Rise of Criticism._' Certainly the epoch\r\nof the rise of criticism, of the Reformation, and of printing, is the\r\nage of inquiry, if any age is entitled to that name.\r\n\r\nChanging then the places of the age of inquiry and that of faith, we\r\nshall have, so far as the grand or European division is concerned, the\r\nepochs of credulity and faith, both essentially stationary elements,\r\nincluded within the stage of the development of the principle of unity;\r\nand those of inquiry and reason, both mainly productive of change,\r\nwithin the period of the reign of the principle of individuality.\r\nJudging now solely from our knowledge of the nature of these opposite\r\ndrifts, what should we expect to discover as the prevalent\r\ncharacteristics of their respective periods of supremacy? We should\r\nlook, during the time in which the principle of unity was developing its\r\npowers, for the predominant manifestation of all those elements of\r\nprogress which belong on the side of order, strength, stability,\r\npermanence, conservatism, community of interests, associative effort,\r\nuniformity in political and religious belief, moral activity; for all\r\nthose elements, in fine, which tend toward the unification of social\r\npower and interest, and toward progress by coöperation; and we should\r\nexpect a corresponding lack of tendencies of an opposite kind. On the\r\nother hand, during the era in which the principle of individuality\r\npredominated, we should be prepared to see a preponderating\r\nmanifestation of all those elements which tend to freedom, change,\r\ndisintegration of interests, antagonistic or competitive effort,\r\ndiversity in political and religious belief, intellectual activity; of\r\nall those drifts, in short, which relate to the individualizing of\r\nsocial power and interests, and to progress by antagonism; with\r\ncorresponding absence of the elements active in the preceding epoch.\r\n\r\nTurning now to Dr. Draper's storehouse of historical facts, do we find\r\nour expectations realized or disappointed?\r\n\r\nWe discover that during the age in which the principle of unity was\r\ndominant, vast, magnificent, opulent empires existed, consolidated,\r\nstable, powerful, orderly; but whose subjects possessed comparatively no\r\nfreedom, which resisted all effort at progression, denied to men\r\npolitical equality, and sought to prevent all desire of change. We see a\r\nreligious organization which bound the people in a single faith by a\r\ncommon creed; which fostered a spirit of brotherly sympathy; kept alive\r\nthe fire of holy zeal by pious ministrations; taught the universal\r\nbrotherhood of the human race; cultured the emotional nature of its\r\nworshippers; sought to eradicate pauperism, to abolish slavery, and to\r\ninculcate practical humility, treating peasant and king as equals before\r\nGod; endeavored to provide for the spiritual and material wants of\r\nmankind; to become the guardian of the weak, the educator of the\r\nignorant, the rescuer of the vicious, the comforter of the sorrowing,\r\nand the strong hand of protection between selfish or brutal power and\r\nthe lowly; which, however, resisted all efforts at intellectual freedom,\r\nshut its ears to the voice of science, strove to repress the rising\r\ndesires of the soul and keep it in perpetual bondage and darkness. We\r\nbehold, next, a social organization in which, as a general rule, though\r\nwith many exceptions, each individual held his fitting place, the\r\nstation for which he was best adapted by natural character and training;\r\nin which each rank recognized its obligations of deference toward\r\nsuperiors, and of guardianship toward inferiors, and fulfilled, in the\r\nmain, as they were then understood, the practical duties which these\r\nobligations created; in which the rich and powerful were the social\r\nfathers of the poor and humble, securing them from physical want and\r\nfrom the snares of designing men; but in which the spirit of\r\nindependence was not alive, the dignity of labor was denied, the\r\ndevelopment which results from competitive struggles unknown, and\r\neducation uncared for.\r\n\r\nBut the achievements of this stage of individual and social growth,\r\nthose which stand out as the illustrious and characteristic features of\r\nthe time, were its moral or religious accomplishments. The pages of\r\nhistory which detail the events of this epoch, are crowded with\r\nrelations of heroic devotion to the individual's highest ideal of truth,\r\nnot as occasional acts of life, but as the dominating purpose of\r\nexistence; of loyalty to men and women of superior powers; of\r\nself-sacrifice for the welfare of others. The sentiments of\r\nChristianity, which appeal mainly to the heart, took fast hold on the\r\nemotional and affectional natures of a simple people not yet developed\r\nin their intellectual faculties. A sense of responsibility for his every\r\naction rested heavily on every person. Men shut themselves in dungeons,\r\nscourged their flesh, lacerated their bodies, inflicted all manner of\r\ntorture on their frames, that they might purge away every evil desire,\r\nevery wrong propensity, and conquer their material elements into\r\nsubmission to the spiritual. Deeds of lofty self-abnegation, rarely if\r\never known to modern days, were then common. Stern virtue, as virtue was\r\nthen understood, was largely prevalent. The habits of life were devout,\r\nreverential, careful of sanctities, solemn and austere. Individuals and\r\ncommunity lived in the constant remembrance of being strictly\r\naccountable for the manner and actions of their lives. A moral and\r\nreligious atmosphere pervaded society, such as our modern levity can\r\nlittle understand. An atmosphere which impregnated every living being\r\nwho came within its scope, and hallowed their lives, so that the guiding\r\nand animating spirit of the day, among high and low, rich and poor,\r\nignorant and learned, was the conscientious desire of thinking, acting,\r\nand living as God wished and as their better natures approved; of being\r\npure in their purposes and holy in their deeds, as purity and holiness\r\nwere then conceived; of subduing and controlling their passions, and in\r\nall ways being devoutly scrupulous that everything they did was\r\ndictated, not by a desire to gratify a selfish impulse nor an ebullition\r\nof feeling, but by a conviction of duty under a sense of eternal\r\nresponsibility to God.\r\n\r\nThe moral and religious grandeur of the age could not avail, however,\r\nfor the highest purposes of civilization, in the absence of intellectual\r\nvigor and mental growth. Devotion itself made men bigots. Their love of\r\nGod, unaccompanied by right views of human liberty, induced cruel\r\npersecutions. Humanity had no hope in such developments alone, grand as\r\nthey were, and a new principle began its career, gradually supplanting\r\nthe first. What does our historian give as the facts of civilization\r\nsince the century preceding the Reformation, from which time the\r\ntendency to individuality has been predominant?\r\n\r\nThe great kingdoms and empires of the earlier days melted away under its\r\ninfluence. The divine right of kings, and the theory that power sprang\r\nfrom the ruler, gradually yielded to the democratic principle of\r\npolitical equality and the origination of power in the people. Civil\r\nliberty became the touchstone of good government, instead of\r\ncentralization of power and consolidation. General eligibility to\r\noffice grew into vogue in the place of the ancient mode, which\r\npractically limited the selection of statesmen and officials to a\r\nprivileged class, comprising the largest and most cultured minds of the\r\nnation. Freedom, and consequent diversity, in thought, in speech, and in\r\naction, became paramount considerations to coercion and resulting\r\nuniformity in these respects. The functions of rule were step by step\r\ncurtailed until they dwindled theoretically, and, to a large extent, in\r\nthe most advanced countries, practically, into two only--the protection\r\nof person and of property. That government is best which governs least,\r\ncame to be an axiom of political progress; and the paramount purpose of\r\ncivil organization is beginning to be regarded, not, as under the\r\nmonarchical sway, the preservation of order, but the liberty of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn ecclesiastical affairs, we see the integrality of the church\r\ndestroyed under the influence of the Protestant principle of private\r\njudgment, one of the first fruits of individuality. We perceive sects\r\ngradually subdividing into sects, until, instead of a unity of religious\r\nsentiment and a sympathy of religious action under the impulse of a\r\ncommon creed, an innumerable variety of religious denominations came\r\ninto existence, each embodying different beliefs in diverse articles of\r\nfaith, and refusing Christian fellowship with the others. In this\r\ntransition the gain has been great, and the loss has been great. The\r\nhuman soul has been liberated to the light of intellectual truth, and\r\nemancipated from the bands of ancient superstition. The blessings of\r\neducation, culture, mental development, and social expansion, have been\r\naccorded to the people. Gloomy asceticism has yielded to more hopeful\r\nviews of life. Dark and depressing theological dogmas have received more\r\ncheerful interpretations; and the design of creation, the nature of man,\r\nand the destiny of humanity are seen in more alluring colors. The\r\nexpectations of the future are no longer made terrible by visions of a\r\ndreadful God; but beneficence and goodness smile through all the\r\npurposes of a loving Father.\r\n\r\nAll this is gain, is strength, is progress. But what shall we say of\r\nthat fierce spirit of religious antagonism, which resulted from the\r\ndisruption of the unity of the church? Of that decline in power which\r\ncan only exist by consolidation of effort in sympathy of spirit? Of the\r\nloss of that capacity through powerful organization to influence men, to\r\nperform vast deeds of benevolence, superintend the spiritual and\r\nmaterial conditions of the indigent, provide for the comfort of the\r\npoor, check the encroachment of the strong on the weak, and hold\r\ncommunity in respectful awe by the force of its moral and religious\r\nsentiments? The cultivation of the intellectual faculties released the\r\nnations from the domination of a narrow-minded spiritual power; but it\r\ncaused men to forget, to a great extent, while in the hot pursuit of\r\nknowledge, that moral culture is equally as essential as mental. To the\r\nintellectual gain, during this period of development, we must add a\r\ncorresponding moral or religious loss. We miss, in modern life, the\r\never-present, all-pervading, conscious sense of high individual\r\naccountability which directed the thoughts, controlled the feelings, and\r\novershadowed the lives of the children of the former stage of progress.\r\nThe activities of intellectual and material existence absorb the energy\r\nof our era, and leave little inclination and less strength for the\r\ncultivation and expansion of the deeper faculties of man's nature. In\r\nall that side of religious progress which comes from the inculcation of\r\ntrue ideas concerning God, man, human destiny, and human duty; in all\r\nwhich belongs to the _intellectual_ side of religion, the side which\r\nenhances our knowledge of what should be done, we have far surpassed the\r\nnations and the people of the past. But in all that pertains to the\r\nemotional, the devotional, and especially to the _moral_ side of\r\nreligion, we are far behind them. The animating spirit of life, under\r\nthe predominating influence of the religious sentiment, was, as we have\r\nseen, a conscientious endeavor to live, in all ways, a life of purity,\r\nof virtue, and of implicit obedience to the highest dictates of truth,\r\naccording to the understanding of truth which then prevailed. To do that\r\nwhich they deemed right, no sacrifice was too great, no labor too\r\narduous, no suffering too severe. The deep, abiding, earnest,\r\ncontrolling spirit of the time, shone bright and glorious through all\r\nits ignorance, degradation, and superstition, a warning to our later and\r\nmore cultured age, that the triumphs of the intellect are not all that\r\nis requisite for the final achievements of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the individualizing tendency is no more perceptible on\r\nthe page of history, in political and religious affairs, than in the\r\nrelations of social life. The gradual advance in political ideas, as\r\nrelating to the liberty of the people, modified the oppressive\r\ntrade-caste systems of the older nations, and wholly abolished them in\r\nthe more advanced. Competitive industry introduced intelligence and\r\nself-reliance among the people. The doctrine of the equality of men\r\nelevated the spirit of the laborer, and dispersed, to a greater or less\r\nextent, as the doctrine made itself felt, that servile veneration which\r\nthe lower classes paid to the higher; the essential dignity of labor is\r\nbecoming acknowledged. To all these benefits, there have been,\r\nnevertheless, corresponding losses. Competitive industry has developed\r\nthe mental faculties of the people; but has also left the ignorant and\r\nthe weak still under the feet of the intelligent and the rich, while the\r\nrecognition of the doctrine of social and political equality has\r\neliminated from the community those distinctive classes who formerly\r\nconstituted themselves the supervisors and patrons of the indigent, and\r\nthe providers for their material wants. It is for this reason that the\r\nlowest orders of modern society exhibit relatively a condition of\r\nphysical misery unknown to the poor of former times. So, while the\r\ninherent and native dignity of manhood has cropped out, under the\r\nimpulse of this same idea of the equality of man, reverence for things\r\nto which reverence is due, respect for sanctities of whatever kind,\r\ndeference to superior worth in any sphere--these and other virtues which\r\nbelong on that side of truth which consists of the recognition of the\r\ninherent _inequality_ of man in mental, moral, and spiritual\r\ncharacteristics, are rapidly disappearing, giving place to that spirit\r\nof dead-levelism so peculiarly illustrative of the prevalent sentiment\r\nin this country, and so aptly denominated 'Young America.'\r\n\r\nIt is in the loss of this side of truth, this want of recognition of the\r\ninherent inequality in men, that one of the greatest elements of\r\nnational power has disappeared. That individuals differ in their\r\norganization and capacities one from another, and are hence, in this\r\nrespect, unequal, is a generally accepted truism. From this inequality\r\nit results that every man has some sphere in which he is superior to all\r\nothers, and in regard to the concerns of which he should be the\r\nvoluntarily recognized authority. But, except in the departments where\r\nmen are entirely ignorant, and hence are forced to acknowledge the\r\nsupremacy of others, there is, among the most advanced peoples, scarcely\r\nany recognition, of this great truth of voluntary deference to those who\r\nare entitled to superiority. Persons of only ordinary capacities, who\r\nread the newspaper, but who elsewise have had little time or inclination\r\nfor study, boldly argue abstrusest questions concerning military\r\nmethods, political economy, theology, or ethics, with students and\r\nthinkers, without the slightest suspicion that they have no _moral_\r\nright to enter into such a dispute, under such circumstances; their\r\ntrue position being that of learners. It is not wholly from a want of\r\nknowledge that such errors are committed. Men are mainly aware that\r\n_political_ equality does not mean equality of faculties and of\r\nfunctions. This assumption of a parity which has no existence, arises in\r\na large measure from a want of moral power; from a lack of that\r\nreligious development, so prevalent in the first state of progress,\r\nwhich made it possible to conquer pride, subdue egotism, cultivate\r\nhumility, defer to superiority, and enabled the individual in all ways\r\nto accept cheerfully his proper position in society, and cordially to\r\nrecognize that of every other, so far as he understood them. Political\r\nand social equality emancipate mankind from civil slavery, from social\r\noppression, from the forced domination of assumptive aristocracies, from\r\nthe pride of rank; they prohibit any imposition of authority which the\r\nindividual does not willingly accept; but they do not lift one iota of\r\nthat responsibility which rests upon every human being to honor the\r\ntruth wherever or whatever it may be. Truth demands that we recognize\r\nour superiors, in whatever sphere we may find them, and eagerly avail\r\nourselves of their advantages; that we recognize our inferiors, and give\r\nthem, if they will accept, of our store. That we in America are no\r\nlonger coerced into the acknowledgement of an assumed superior class,\r\nonly renders our obligation of voluntary deference more binding. The\r\nselfishness and recklessness which the principle of individuality has\r\ndeveloped in its course; the disregard of moral duties which it has\r\nengendered, promise only disaster and defeat to our national career,\r\nunless speedily counteracted by a development of the opposite tendency.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is in the sphere of intellectual growth, with its resulting\r\nscientific achievement and material prosperity, that we must look for\r\nthe greatest results of the period in which the principle of\r\nindividuality has preponderated. It is needless to undertake to detail\r\nthese here. Every department of human concern has felt their influence,\r\nand advanced under it. Through science, the world in which we live has\r\nbeen unfolded to our vision; the organism we inhabit made known; the\r\nhistory of the past revealed; and the destiny of our future forecast. To\r\nscience, the offspring of intellectual activity, we owe our increased\r\nfacilities for travel; the gradually accumulating comforts of life;\r\nextended commercial advantages; national growth; social amelioration;\r\nincreased power over the elements; and rapidly accumulating wealth. To\r\nmental development we owe civil freedom, social culture, and religious\r\nliberty; commerce, invention, arts, education, enterprise. The principle\r\nof individuality still guides the development of our day; science is\r\ndiscovering new resources; and practical applications are introducing\r\nnew elements of prosperity. The stage of unity has done its work; it\r\ngave us great elements of civilization, but not enough. The stage of\r\nindividuality, now swiftly advancing to its close, has furnished\r\nmagnificent contributions to progress, but could not achieve the highest\r\npoint. We are passing into a third era, which shall combine the good\r\nresults of each, and ultimate a nobler form of individual and social\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we may pause in our investigation and ask the conclusion.\r\nHave intellectual truths been more important in the past progress of the\r\nworld than moral ones? Let us sum up. We have seen that the early ages\r\nof the world were dominated by the principle of unity; that during its\r\ncareer the moral agencies preponderated, while the intellectual were\r\nsubordinated; that society, under the influence of these agencies,\r\ndeveloped to a higher degree than subsequently certain elements, such as\r\npolitical order, national stability, religious sympathy, moral\r\nresponsibility, associative labor, deference, reverence, and others,\r\nabsolutely essential to the highest well-being of a nation; that these\r\nelements, however, in the absence of those of an opposite or\r\ncounteracting nature, had a morbid rather than a healthful action, and\r\nkept humanity in darkness and stagnation, being inadequate to all the\r\nrequirements of social progress; that a new development then began,\r\nunder the impulse of a new and opposite principle, which evolved\r\nprecisely those tendencies the want of which had prevented the complete\r\nrealization of the highest purposes of national life; such were\r\nintellectual culture, political liberty, social equality, religious\r\nfreedom and others; that in the course of the development of these\r\nprinciples, likewise absolutely necessary to the complete organization\r\nof community, those which had been predominant under the operation of\r\nthe drift toward unity, became dormant; so that the results of the\r\nsecond stage of progression were, practically, the same as those of the\r\nfirst, namely, the evolution of magnificent principles, which in the\r\nabsence of their counterparts had not a healthful action, and were\r\nunavailable for the establishment of the highest civilization; and\r\nfinally, we have seen, from the nature of the two principles, that\r\nneither is adequate, alone, to the inauguration of a true social order,\r\nneither to develop the indispensable requisites which belong to its\r\nopposite, but that in every harmonious organization both must be\r\npresent, mutually functioning, interblending, and expanding.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the answer: The moral agencies have tried to secure the\r\nhighest social state without the aid of the intellectual, and have\r\nfailed. The intellectual agencies have sought to secure the same object\r\nwithout the aid of the moral, and have likewise failed. There is no\r\npossibility of establishing the _desideratum_ without the full and\r\nuninterrupted play of the moral faculties; no possibility of\r\nestablishing it without the full and uninterrupted play of the\r\nintellectual faculties; both have been equal factors in the history of\r\nthe past in an isolated way; both will be equal factors in a blended\r\nharmony in the history of the future. One is humanity's head, and the\r\nother humanity's heart. With the absence of either the nation is not yet\r\ncome into its birth; it is still an embryo.\r\n\r\nIn this exhibition of the nature and tendency of the principles of unity\r\nand individuality, we have also the means of correcting the error into\r\nwhich Professor Draper has fallen respecting the law of human\r\ndevelopment. He, together with Mr. Buckle, has failed to perceive that\r\nthe _static_ forces are as important to human growth as the _motic_. He\r\nwould reject the fruits of the stage of unity and be satisfied with the\r\nsplendid achievements of the intellectual era. Dazzled by the brilliancy\r\nof this later age he is not conscious that in securing the finer results\r\nof our riper civilization, we have left in abeyance the deeper, sterner,\r\nand more religious elements of life. He would urge us onward in our\r\nmerely intellectual career, unmindful of the lesson, which the pages of\r\nhistory logically teach, which the principles we have pointed out\r\nunerringly confirm, that intellectual development, religious liberty,\r\ncivil freedom, social equality, unbalanced and unregulated by the\r\ncentralization, consolidation, moral force, religious responsibility,\r\nand the tendencies which belong to the principle of unity, push\r\nirresistibly toward disintegration, and end inevitably in political\r\nrevolution, national disruption, and social anarchy. Toward that goal\r\nthe nations are now steadily setting under the operations of the\r\ntendency to individuality. In the direction which Dr. Draper points for\r\nsuccess and prosperity are only disaster and despair: 'The organization\r\nof the national intellect' has been and will be fruitless, unless\r\naccompanied by the organization of the national moral power. China has\r\nthe former in an inferior and stunted way, without the latter, and is\r\nfitly described by the historian as passing cheerlessly through the last\r\nstage of civil life. Had she been less selfish, had she felt deeply the\r\nmoral and religious obligation she owed to humanity, China had liberated\r\nthe intellectual faculties to a complete freedom under the\r\nsanctification of the moral agencies, and added to that permanence,\r\nwhich is _one_ of the chief factors of national success, the freedom\r\nwhich is the other.\r\n\r\nThe 'predetermined order of development' has not destined the peoples of\r\nthe earth to the melancholy fate of China. The climacteric of the\r\npresent stage of progress is rapidly approaching, is even now touching\r\nwith its finger the startled nations. When it shall have passed, the\r\nworld will enter upon the third and final stage of civil progress, in\r\nwhich the organized power, social order, moral grandeur, religious\r\nunity, and coöperative industry of the past epoch will be allied to the\r\ncivil liberty, social equality, intellectual culture, and practical\r\nactivity of the present. Under these combined influences humanity will\r\nstart upon a new career, whose achievements in literature, in science,\r\nin art, in religion, in practical activities, will make even the vast\r\naccumulations of our modern day seem to the future historian\r\ninsignificant accomplishments, 'a school-boy's tale, the wonder of an\r\nhour.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the American student of history his own country presents, at the\r\npresent time, a most mournful and convincing example of the inability of\r\nintellectual agencies to secure national stability or individual\r\nprosperity in the absence of moral strength. Here education has been\r\ngeneral, mental activity great, and literary culture prevalent. Here,\r\nnevertheless, during half a century a giant wrong has held paramount\r\nsway; dominating the sentiment, dictating the policy, controlling the\r\naction of the Government, and, at the same time, bending commercial\r\ninterests to its purpose, giving the law to public opinion, and\r\ndirecting the destiny of the republic. Not to any want of knowledge has\r\nthe reign of this tyrant been due. The slaveholding institutions of the\r\nSouth are mainly sustained by men of high mental development and large\r\nintellectual culture. The statesmen who staked the freedom of a race\r\nagainst the chance of political honor, were renowned for mental vigor.\r\nThe people who turned a deaf ear to the cry of the bondmen, are\r\ncelebrated throughout the world for their intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the nation was not intellectual, but moral. The 'selfish\r\npursuit of material advantages' had conquered, in the slaveowner of the\r\nSouth, and in the mercantile community of the North, the love of equity\r\nand the desire of right. Political ambition was stronger among the\r\nstatesmen of the North, than the instincts of mercy or the sense of\r\nreligious responsibility. Love of gain weighed heavier with the people\r\nof the United States than the love of God or of their fellowmen. In vain\r\nthe voice of warning has been sounded. In vain has the republic been\r\nurged to love mercy and to do justice. The country lay in a moral\r\nlethargy, from which no gentle means could rouse it, and the dread\r\nthunderbolt of war was launched to smite it into action. Through\r\nhumiliation and suffering; amid widows' tears and orphans' grief;\r\nthrough struggle and privation; by the stern baptism of blood, the\r\nnation is being awakened to its deficiencies, is being called to the\r\ndevelopment of higher virtues.\r\n\r\nThis latest lesson of history is solemn and impressive. Fruitlessly\r\nshall communities teem with material advantages and wealth; in vain\r\nshall peoples increase their industrial resources; futile the\r\nuniversality of education and the liberalizing results of intellectual\r\ngrowth; these shall endure but for a season, as the glitter on the\r\nwaves, unless the national life is grounded on religious devotion to the\r\nhighest truth, and is practically active in securing the social welfare\r\nof the brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURE-TROVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A day in the heart of summer,\r\n    A sky of that glorious hue\r\n  That dazzles and melts like the ocean,\r\n    In its fathomless, infinite blue!\r\n\r\n  The topmost leaves of the maple\r\n    Are stirred by a wondrous song,\r\n  That swells, and dies; then rising,\r\n    Still clearer floats along.\r\n\r\n  Oh, where have I heard that music?\r\n    Whence its familiar tone?\r\n  The beauty that thrills it, trembles\r\n    Not in the song alone:\r\n\r\n  It dwells in sunsets, that deepen\r\n    In the glory and gloom of night;\r\n  In waters that glance and sparkle,\r\n    In the hush of the lingering light.\r\n\r\n  Like the waves of a springing river,\r\n    That from silver fountains wells;\r\n  Higher, and fuller, and sweeter\r\n    That liquid melody swells.\r\n\r\n  Oh, the haunting, dim-shadowed expression,\r\n    That sighs on the breathless air!\r\n  If ever a soul were in music,\r\n    A soul is thrilling there!\r\n\r\n  That song, with its burden immortal,\r\n    I heard it long ago!\r\n  I know its every cadence,\r\n    That quivers and pulses so:\r\n\r\n  I claim it, bird of summer!\r\n    That wondrous song of thine;\r\n  Though thine its tuneful utterance,\r\n    Its melody is mine.\r\n\r\n  Then sing till, tranced in rapture,\r\n    The day forgets to wane;\r\n  And the winds of heaven are silent,\r\n    To hear that magic strain.\r\n\r\n  Sing till the pain of thy transport\r\n    O'erpowers each dying tone!\r\n  Thou canst not warble a measure\r\n    That is not all mine own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTER AND SPIRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Editor: In the July number of THE CONTINENTAL, I notice some\r\neditorial remarks upon a portion of my article 'Touching the Soul,'\r\nwhich appeared in the June number. For these remarks I am under\r\nobligation to you, as pointing out the looseness of my phraseology,\r\nwhereby I have failed to convey the idea I intended; for which looseness\r\nthe only excuse must be that my mind was occupied more with the thought\r\nthan with the expression, and the latter was so absorbed in the former\r\nas to have suffered in consequence. For it seems to me that the\r\nstrictures are due to misapprehension of the position assumed.\r\n\r\nTo commence with the assumed operation of spirit on the material world,\r\nas seen in the action of nature: Does not the theory that the mysterious\r\nproductive forces are in their own nature spiritual verge somewhat\r\nclosely upon the dogmas of pantheism? What else than this was the belief\r\nof the ancients, which placed a Naiad in every stream and a Dryad in\r\nevery tree? Does it not draw still nearer to Shelley's theory of a\r\n'Spirit of Nature,' which was his God, creating, shaping, and pervading\r\nall things? In a word, does not such a theory, in effect, place a god in\r\nevery object?\r\n\r\nSpirit acts independently of God. And here I would not be misunderstood.\r\nFor though God, as the Author of all spiritual being, may be said to be\r\nthe indirect cause of all spiritual action, since, if he had not created\r\nit, the action could not have resulted, yet He has created the soul to\r\nact upon its own promptings, and entirely independent of Himself,\r\nholding it, at the same time, to a strict accountability for all the\r\ndeeds done in the body. To deny this, is to deny the whole doctrine of\r\nfreewill agency, and with it that of all human responsibility, unless we\r\ngo to the other and blasphemous extreme of branding with cruelty and\r\ninjustice the entire system of revealed religion. In consequence, then,\r\nof this independent action of spirit, we see the soul of man constantly\r\ndeparting from its normal state, effecting evil as well as good, and\r\nguilty of action for which its Creator can in no wise be held\r\nresponsible. And upon this simple fact hangs the whole system of future\r\nrewards and punishments. If now we consider this force which we have\r\nbeen discussing to be spiritual in its nature, it is not for us to draw\r\nthe line between it and the soul of man. Spirit, so far as it touches\r\nour knowledge or experience, is one and the same thing the world over,\r\ndiffering only in degree of its qualities. If we concede to this force\r\nthe status of spirit, we must also concede to it that essential\r\ncharacteristic or faculty of spirit, _independent action_; and hence the\r\nCreator God could not be said to have any hand whatever in the works of\r\nthis spiritual force--in other words, in the creation of any of the\r\nfeatures of the physical world--further than in the original creation of\r\nthe spirit which underlies and produces them. But this position is in\r\ndirect variance with the teachings of Holy Writ, wherein we are told\r\nthat He maketh every flower to bloom, every leaf to grow, and without\r\nHim not even a sparrow falls to the ground. In fact, upon almost every\r\npage of the sacred book is recognized and taught the fact of the direct\r\nintervention of God, not only in human affairs, but also in every work\r\nof nature, however minute and insignificant.\r\n\r\nAnd as another result of this independent action, we should find this\r\nspiritual force, as in the case of the human soul, frequently departing\r\nfrom its normal state, deviating from the laws which now seem to control\r\nit, and multiplying so-called 'freaks of nature,' abnormal works in the\r\nphysical world, calculated to derange the comfort of mankind and render\r\nall things uncertain and insecure. In a word, it would be in the power\r\nof such a force, or combination and opposition of forces, to turn the\r\nearth again to its original chaos. With such a belief, then, we must\r\nassume that God has delegated the care of the material world to other\r\nhands of His own creation, and left the comfort and well-being of\r\nhumanity at the mercy of another spirit, no wiser and perhaps not even\r\nso far advanced in the scale of progress as itself.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that the mysterious productive forces of nature can\r\nin no wise be called spiritual. Certainly spirit 'animates, informs, and\r\nshapes the universe,' in the sense that all things are created and all\r\nagencies are kept in operation by an all-powerful God, who is himself\r\npure Spirit, but in no other sense; for God makes use of certain\r\nprinciples or laws to accomplish all things in this world of ours. That\r\nunknown force which vivifies the seed and produces the stalk, the blade,\r\nand the ear, which clothes the earth with verdure, and which underlies\r\nand induces all the works of nature, is not a thinking, reasoning\r\nspirit, like that which renders humanity godlike; but a principle--a\r\nlaw--a mere agency whereby the Almighty effects his designs, which is\r\nwholly controlled by him, dependent upon him for its very existence, and\r\nwhich in each individual instance ceases to be with the accomplishment\r\nof its end; a principle which humanity cannot comprehend, and with which\r\nhuman spirit can have no sympathy or connection except as it excites\r\nwonder and admiration. Under this view all the objects of nature are the\r\nproducts, not of spirit, but of law, which is itself the product of the\r\none great Creative Spirit whereby all things are. Even if we admit that\r\nso subtle is the connection between the spirit and the law, the law and\r\nthe material object, that matter may, after all, be said to be the work\r\nof and acted upon by spirit, yet it will be seen that even in this\r\ninstance, spirit does not act directly upon matter, but only through\r\ncertain intermediate agencies, of which more anon; while, in the matter\r\nunder discussion, the direct action of spirit upon matter is assumed by\r\nthe so-called spiritualists.\r\n\r\nAgain, in regard to the connection of the soul with the organized frame,\r\nnothing is better established than the mutual action and reaction\r\nbetween the mind and body. A volume of truth is contained in the simple\r\nand hackneyed phrase, _Mens sana in corpore sano_. A diseased frame is\r\nalmost invariably accompanied by depression of spirits and a\r\ndisinclination, if not an absolute disability for profound thought; and,\r\non the other hand, a diseased mind soon makes itself manifest to the\r\nouter world in an enfeebled and sickly frame. The merest tyro in\r\nmedical science recognizes the fact that in sickness no medicine is so\r\neffective as cheerfulness, hope, and a determined will; while not\r\nunfrequently the direst evil against which the physician has to contend\r\nis despondency. And many other instances might be given of this mutual\r\naction, which are unnecessary in this connection, since the point is\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\nYet, as regards the outer world, it is nevertheless true that the soul\r\ncannot directly perceive material objects, but only through the agency\r\nof the physical senses. In the matter of sight and sound, the atoms of\r\nthe elastic medium must first make a material and tangible impression\r\nupon the eye and ear, which impression is conveyed by the nerves to the\r\nbrain, where all human knowledge of the mystic process ceases. We only\r\nknow that there is an intimate connection between the nerves and the\r\nmind established in the brain--which is the fountain head of\r\nboth--whereby the mind receives this subtile impression and thereby\r\nbecomes cognizant of the object which is its original cause. The same\r\nthing is true of all the other senses. Destroy now any one of these\r\nbodily senses, and the soul at once becomes dead to all that class of\r\nimpressions which before were conveyed through that medium. Destroy the\r\nsight, and the mind can have no cognizance whatever of material objects\r\nsave through the sense of touch--for our knowledge of matter through the\r\nsenses of hearing, taste, and smell, is one of experience alone, which,\r\naided by sight and touch, has taught us in the past that where sound,\r\ntaste, or odor exist, there must be matter to produce these impressions.\r\nDestroy, then, if it were possible, this sense of touch, and our\r\nabsolute perception of objects is entirely lost--the connection between\r\nthe outer world and the perceptive faculties of the mind is dissolved\r\nforever. The truth of this position is seen in the fact that in a swoon,\r\nwhen all the senses are benumbed, the mind is utterly unconscious of its\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nAgain, to go to the other end of the chain--admitting that the force\r\nwhich resides in the material points and produces the vibration in the\r\nelastic medium is spiritual in its nature, do we not find that this\r\nforce never produces an impression upon the senses, and through them\r\nupon the mind, except through the intermediate agency of a material\r\nobject? The object itself must exist before the force can act, and hence\r\narises our confidence in the evidence of our senses. Were it otherwise,\r\nindeed, our whole life would be one of uncertainty, of innumerable\r\ndeceptions, a mere wandering about in a mist of delusions worse than\r\nthose of a maniac. And if this force could act upon our perceptions\r\nwithout a material point in which to reside, is it not reasonable to\r\nsuppose that it would occasionally so do, and that we should sometimes\r\nperceive effects for which we could find no cause in the material\r\nworld--no connection with matter? Yet in the whole range of human\r\nexperience no such thing is known. Even the phenomena which we call\r\noptical illusions arise from certain derangements of the atomic\r\nparticles of the medium through which the impression is conveyed.\r\n\r\nFrom this course of reasoning two plain deductions arise, either of\r\nwhich is disastrous to the spiritualistic theory. For if we deny, as I\r\nhave done, that this hidden, mysterious force is spiritual in its\r\nnature, we have in all our knowledge and experience no _instance_ of the\r\ndirect action of spirit upon matter. While, if we _acknowledge_ that\r\nfact, we have still no instance of spirit so acting upon the medium\r\nthrough which we receive our physical perceptions as to produce an\r\nimpression through the senses upon the mind, without the intervention of\r\na material point.\r\n\r\nIs it reasonable, then, to suppose that in this our age, for the first\r\ntime, a single solitary manifestation of this supernatural power should\r\noccur, as claimed by the spiritualists, unaccompanied by any analogous\r\ncontemporary or corroborative fact of the same or of a different nature?\r\nTo admit this is to admit one of three things: 1st, that both the\r\nphysical senses and spiritual constitution of humanity have undergone a\r\nsudden and wonderful change; 2dly, that the Almighty has entirely\r\naltered his mode of communication with mankind; or, 3dly, that the whole\r\nworld of spirits has been let loose to wander at will over the universe\r\nand space!\r\n\r\nBut admitting, as all must do, that there is in each individual human\r\norganism an intimate and mysterious connection, through the nerves and\r\nbrain, between the spirit and the senses, the fact that this is the only\r\nknown connection, direct or indirect, between matter and spirit, seems\r\nto me to argue that there is no other perceptible one. For, if there\r\nwere any such, designed in any way to affect our perceptions, mental,\r\nmoral, or physical, would it not, in some one of its phases, have been\r\nmade manifest through all the past ages of the world? That such a\r\nconnection has never been discovered is proof sufficient that no such\r\nwas ever intended by the Supreme Being to affect mankind in any way,\r\n_unless_ we admit that the spiritual and religious necessities of\r\nmankind, and, in fact, the very constitution itself of human spirit, are\r\nentirely different from what they have been in the ages gone by, and\r\nrequire not only a different pabulum, but also a different mode of\r\ndealing at the hands of the Almighty: in a word, that the very essence\r\nof religion is progressive.\r\n\r\nIf these positions be correct, the discussion is narrowed down to the\r\nconsideration of the relations of the spirit as connected with the\r\norganized frame. And this brings us to another very natural deduction.\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows the story of the wonderful clock whose inventor\r\nwas blinded by the order of his sovereign, that he might not be able to\r\nrepeat his work for any rival power; and how, many years afterward, when\r\nthe memory of his person had passed away from those who had known him in\r\nhis younger days, he groped his way back to the scene of his former\r\nlabors, and, guided by a lad to the tower which enclosed the already\r\nfamous work of art, under pretence of listening once more to its chimes,\r\nhe suddenly, with his scissors, severed a single small wire, and the\r\nwonderful performances were closed forever. No artist thereafter could\r\nbe found to restore the work, for none other than the inventor was\r\nacquainted with its mechanism, or could discover the secret of its\r\noperation. And so it remained a silent monument to the ingratitude of a\r\nsovereign and the revenge of a victim of the most barbarous cruelty. And\r\nyet the principle was still there uninjured, and as capable of operation\r\nas ever before, yet forever dead to that complicated mechanism, since\r\nthe single connecting rod was severed which bound the idea to its only\r\nmeans of action--the immaterial to the material--the soul to the body.\r\nThe mechanism too was as perfect as ever, in all its constituent parts,\r\nbut forever silent and inoperative from lack of connection with the idea\r\nupon which it depended. Side by side lay the principle and its means of\r\nmanifestation, separated only by the infinitesimal portion of space\r\nwhich divided the parts of the broken wire, yet as effectually separated\r\nas if worlds had rolled between them. Unite again these slender\r\nfragments, and both would again spring to life, unimpaired in their\r\nworkings, and as brilliant as ever; but without this restoration both\r\nmust remain forever dead.\r\n\r\nEven such is the connection between the soul and body. A system of\r\nslender wires--more slender by far than the most attenuated thread of\r\nhuman construction--connects the more than ethereal spirit with the\r\nwonderful mechanism of the human body. And so long as this intimate\r\nconnection is maintained intact we have the living, breathing,\r\nreasoning being, the image of his Creator, the most wonderful\r\nmanifestation of Almighty power. But once these slender wires are\r\nparted, and the soul separated from the body by death, the relation of\r\nthat man's spirit with the material world is dissolved forever. The\r\nsenses of the body are the only medium through which the soul can act\r\nupon or receive impressions from the world of matter, and between them\r\nand it, once so intimately associated, there is now a great gulf\r\nfixed--the gulf which separates time from eternity. Henceforth the body,\r\ndeprived of the lifegiving principle, its end accomplished, which was\r\nonly to serve as a temporary dwelling for the soul in its time of trial\r\nand probation, goes swiftly to decay, and returns to its original dust.\r\nBut the soul lives on for another world and a different stage of\r\nexistence, entirely free from the trials and sufferings and sorrows of\r\nthis. Its mission here is fully accomplished, and it has nothing further\r\nto do with the material. Only that Almighty Power which created it can\r\nrestore its association with a perception of matter, and that by\r\nreuniting the broken chord--the silver chord which bound it to its\r\nprison walls of clay. Henceforth it is to deal only with pure spirit and\r\nas pure spirit; it has a nobler destiny before it, and higher and more\r\nglorious objects to employ its powers and engross its emotions and\r\naffections than any that earth can afford; and to maintain that it can\r\nagain return and mingle in the affairs of a sordid world is to degrade\r\nit from its new and more glorious eminence--to drag it down from the\r\nsublime, the eternal, and the godlike, to the insignificant, the\r\nephemeral, and the human.\r\n\r\nYet it is not to be assumed that matter and spirit are _opposed_ to each\r\nother in any other respect than that of constitution--of construction,\r\nif the term is allowable. As in color white and black are the opposite\r\nextremes of a long line of causes and effects, and as one is the\r\nsynonyme for utter absence of the other, so, and so only, are matter and\r\nspirit opposite poles to each other; and we frequently use the terms\r\nethereal, _spiritual_, to denote the strongest contrast to the\r\nsubstantial, the material. And so, in just the degree in which any\r\nobject departs from the substantial and lacks the properties of the\r\nmaterial, do we say that it approaches the spiritual. Yet, even as in\r\nnature we find not only objects, but even forces, of entirely different\r\nand even opposite origin and construction working in perfect harmony, so\r\nmatter and spirit may exist together, and work in harmony, though acting\r\nindependently of each other, and incapable of producing upon each other\r\nwhat, for lack of a better word, we may call physical effects.\r\n\r\nIt was not attempted, in the article referred to, to disprove the\r\nphenomena of spiritualism by the above mode of reasoning, but simply to\r\ndeny and disprove the intervention of the supernatural in their\r\norigin--to show, in fact, that disembodied spirit can by no possibility\r\nhave anything to do with their production. That the phenomena certainly\r\nexist is not to be denied, and the only question which puzzles the\r\nphilosophical mind of the age is whence do they arise. If these\r\nmanifestations are due to the tricks of legerdemain, it is certain that\r\nthe jugglery is so cunningly devised and skilfully executed as hitherto\r\nto have baffled the detective ingenuity as well as the deep wisdom of\r\nthe most profound minds of the age. Philosophy is no nearer the solution\r\nof the question than at the beginning; yet as the process of inquiry\r\ngoes on, there is little doubt that the investigation will develop the\r\nlittle knowledge now possessed, and perhaps bring to light new facts in\r\nregard to the relation between matter and spirit as it exists in the\r\nbody. Possibly it may some day, in the far future, be discovered that\r\nthese phenomena are due to some at present undiscovered connection\r\nbetween the mind and will of the medium and the material objects of his\r\nimmediate surroundings. At present man's knowledge of the properties and\r\nworkings of the spirit within him is infinitesimal in quantity and\r\ndegree, and, if this inquiry shall, by making humanity better acquainted\r\nwith its immortal part, open new paths of research to human intellect,\r\nand add to the world's comparatively slender stock of knowledge of\r\nspiritual things, or of the natural forces which are constantly working\r\naround and within us, then will spiritualism, with all its errors and\r\nits dangerous tendencies, prove to have been one of the blessings of\r\nthis age.\r\n\r\nAnd, in passing, it may be well here to mention an incident, for the\r\ntruth of which the writer can vouch, and which may, perhaps, throw some\r\nlight upon this vexed question, or give a clue to some earnest searcher\r\ninto the cause of this mystery.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, being for the first time in his life in the city of\r\nCincinnati, where he had not a single acquaintance, and having long been\r\nanxious to test this spiritualistic second sight, on the evening of his\r\narrival muffled himself closely and attended a 'circle.' Summoning the\r\nspirit of a distant relation long deceased, he inquired first into his\r\nname, age, and residence; all of which were given correctly. Not a\r\nlittle startled with this result, he proceeded with his inquiries, and\r\nelicited the following information in regard to his family, viz.: that\r\ntwo of his brothers, named George and Henry, died before his own birth;\r\nthat of these two George was the elder, but Henry died first. Astounded\r\nat the accuracy of these replies, he waited to hear no more, but at once\r\nleft the circle, with his own faith quivering in the balance.\r\n\r\nOn returning to his home, he related these circumstances to an elder\r\nsister, within whose recollection the birth and death of these children\r\nhad occurred. She listened attentively to the close, and then quietly\r\ninformed him that both the spirits and himself were in error, for that\r\nHenry was the elder and George died first. As these questions of age and\r\ndate were the strongest points made by him in his spiritual\r\nconsultation, and the points most relied upon to test the accuracy of\r\nthe replies, this revelation at once upset all his doubts and fears, and\r\nrestored him again to the faith of his fathers. He himself had always\r\nbelieved the facts to be as he had heard them from the medium, they\r\nhaving, by some means, been reversed in his mind in the absence of any\r\nother knowledge in the premises than that derived from hearsay, and that\r\ntoo long gone by.\r\n\r\nNow, in this instance, the mind of the medium was clearly _en rapport_\r\nwith that of the inquirer, and hence all the errors of the latter had\r\nbeen closely followed. The facts were given not as they really were, but\r\nas they existed in the mind of the inquirer. In other words, his mind\r\nwas read by the medium as an open book. And while, in this case, this\r\nclose copying of error at once precluded the idea of supernatural\r\nagency, the facts are interesting as furnishing a new line of inquiry,\r\nby showing that, in this instance at least--and if in this, why not in\r\nothers?--the phenomena of spiritualism were closely allied to those of\r\nclairvoyance and mesmerism, and that the path of investigation into all\r\nthese mysteries may be pursued by one and the same course of reasoning.\r\n\r\nBut whether the cause of these mysteries is to be found in jugglery, in\r\nsome subtile connection between mind and matter, in animal magnetism, or\r\nin any other of the thousand new branches of natural or mental science,\r\nit must in the end be found--if found at all--to depend upon purely\r\nnatural laws--laws fixed and undeviating in the very constitution of\r\nthings, and which would have worked as well a thousand years ago as\r\nto-day. The supernatural is entirely excluded from the investigation,\r\nfor that is a world beyond humanity's ken, into which no mortal may\r\npeer. If the world of disembodied spirits have any connection whatever\r\nwith these wonderful and mystical phenomena, the question must ever\r\nremain as perplexing and mysterious as it is to-day.\r\n\r\nBut human intellect is progressive. Age after age brings man nearer to\r\nthe comprehension of the myriad wonders that surround him, though he\r\nmust ever remain, while fettered to the earth and blinded by the body,\r\nunable to grasp and comprehend the Infinite. And the time will come,\r\nperhaps not in this age, nor even in its successor, when this perplexing\r\nproblem shall be solved, and the hidden truths of to-day be as clear as\r\nthe noonday sun.\r\n\r\nAnd if not here, then hereafter. Ah! that hereafter! how much of\r\nspiritual knowledge it involves! how much of manifestation of eternal\r\ntruth and clearing up of mysteries! Into what a sea of knowledge does\r\nthe spirit glide when it departs from the body! Every wave in that\r\nillimitable ocean of space is freighted with wisdom, every sound is the\r\ntone of undying truth, every breath is redolent of divine wisdom. We\r\nwonder now at the wisdom of the sages of our own and of ages gone by--at\r\nthe learning, the profundity, the astonishing acquirements of the\r\nNewtons, the Lockes, the Bacons, the Franklins, and the Humboldts. But\r\nwhen we shall stand, in all the nakedness of pure, unfettered spirit,\r\nwithin the confines of the spirit land, and gaze with all the clearness\r\nof unveiled spiritual vision upon the wonderful mechanism of the\r\nuniverse and of the spirit world; when we see--as we shall see--laws and\r\nprinciples, and even abstract truths, as plainly as we now look upon the\r\nmaterial objects around us; when, indeed, nothing shall be hidden from\r\nour view, and questions which are now too intricate for the wisest minds\r\nto solve, and others which are now too profoundly mysterious for human\r\nintellect to comprehend or even conceive, shall seem as axioms which\r\nneed no argument, and which a child can perceive; when, finally, the\r\nmysteries of God himself are revealed to our progressive souls, then how\r\ncontemptibly insignificant will appear the learning of the wisest of\r\nearth's sages! how infinitesimal the wisdom of Solomon himself! For to\r\nsuch knowledge we must and shall attain; knowledge wisely barred from\r\nour attainment in this earthly existence, lest in our presumption we\r\nshould rebel against God, and, like Lucifer of old, endeavor to make\r\nourselves equal to Him who is the Author of our spiritual being. Yet in\r\nevery soul is implanted a yearning for this forbidden knowledge, an\r\nundying thirst, which can never be satiated in this life, for but a\r\nsingle draught of that wisdom and truth which flows like a sea about the\r\ngreat white throne. And it is this which makes me comprehend how even an\r\nunregenerated soul--and how much more the Christian--can long for that\r\nwhich we call death, but which is but the initiation into the mysteries\r\nof the Beyond. It is this which, even aside from religious aspirations\r\nand fears, wraps our departure in an awful sublimity. To die that we may\r\nKNOW--to give up the transitory, the perishing, the earthly, that we may\r\ngrasp the all-enduring, the imperishable, the divine; to pass from\r\nblindness to far-stretching, unimpeded sight! to be able at a single\r\nglance to count the very stars of heaven, and to see the network of laws\r\nwhich bind them in their places, and control, not only their motions,\r\nbut the minutest particulars of their internal organism; and, above and\r\ngreater than all, to comprehend the relation between the soul and its\r\nGod. Here is an existence worthy of spirit which is the image of its\r\nGod--an existence which will give full scope for the exercise of those\r\nfaculties which can only act so feebly here--the only existence for\r\nwhich any soul should pine. Strange that humanity should so shudder at\r\nthe thought of death! And stranger still, that the searcher for wisdom\r\nshould not seek it in the preparation for that future life where alone\r\ntrue wisdom can be gained.\r\n\r\nAnd as for questions such as this which we have been discussing, it is,\r\nafter all, enough for us to know that all will some day be revealed;\r\nenough for us to know that there are other duties incumbent upon us,\r\nother interests more vital to our spiritual well-being, than that of\r\npeering into these hidden mysteries, which do not at all concern our\r\npresent existence, which do not promote our present or future happiness,\r\nor help us forward on our eternal road.\r\n\r\n  EGBERT PHELPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE ABOVE.\r\n\r\nMATTER AND SPIRIT.--Our contributor, under this title, has entered upon\r\na boundless field of speculation, in which we have no thought of\r\nfollowing him to any considerable distance. A metaphysical discussion of\r\nthis character would scarcely be appropriate to the pages of THE\r\nCONTINENTAL; and our readers would doubtless find the controversy\r\nuninteresting, if not altogether unprofitable. We, however, cheerfully\r\ninsert the paper offered by Lieutenant Phelps, on account of the spirit\r\nof earnest piety and love of truth which seem to pervade it; and we\r\nshall confine ourselves here to the briefest possible comment which will\r\nenable us to make understood our grounds of dissent.\r\n\r\nWe demur to the suggestion that our ideas, as expressed in the July\r\nnumber, have necessarily any affinity to 'the dogmas of pantheism.' We\r\nthen wrote thus: 'It is spirit only that animates, informs, and shapes\r\nthe whole universe. Wherever law prevails (and where does it not?),\r\nthere is intelligence, spirit, soul, acting to sustain it, during every\r\nmoment of its operation.' Can anyone seriously question the correctness,\r\nand even the entire orthodoxy of this statement? In truth, we do not\r\nunderstand that our contributor himself denies it absolutely, but only\r\nin a qualified sense, as we shall presently show. Of course, it could be\r\nno other spirit than the Deity, to which our language would be\r\napplicable; and we do not see how it can in any way derogate from His\r\nattributes, to represent him as acting, by an exertion of spiritual\r\npower, to sustain and uphold his creation, during every moment of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNor can we comprehend the pertinence of our contributor's disquisition\r\non the great question of free will and necessity, as applicable to our\r\nideas of the relations existing between mind and matter. 'Spirit acts\r\nindependently of God,' says he. We might well question the truth of this\r\nassertion; but we may equally well admit it, so far as any inference may\r\nbe drawn against the positions we have assumed. The question is not\r\nwhether the soul of man is compelled to action according to the law of\r\nits creation, or is permitted by spontaneous choice to follow its own\r\nindependent will. This is not point of disagreement; for we have\r\nexpressed no opinion on this subject, nor upon any other which involves\r\nit. On the contrary, we took the question to be simply whether there can\r\nbe, in the nature of things, any relations of reciprocal influence and\r\nmutual coöperation between mind and matter. If this be not the question\r\nat issue, both our contributor and ourselves are engaged in a fruitless\r\nattempt to enlighten each other. We are well aware that his digression\r\nfrom the main argument to the disputed question of free will, is made\r\nfor the purpose of attempting to show that all spiritual agency must be\r\nlike that which he claims for the soul of man--that is to say, it must\r\nhave a free will, 'constantly departing from its normal state,' acting\r\nirregularly and according to the freaks of its own spontaneity. And\r\nbecause there is no such caprice and irregularity in the operation of\r\nthe laws of nature, the inference is drawn that they cannot be the\r\nevidences of spiritual power, in the forces which they govern.\r\n\r\nUpon this point there seems to be a radical difference of understanding\r\nbetween our contributor and ourselves. Be it pantheism, or whatever any\r\none else may choose to call it, we entertain the very simple belief that\r\nthe ultimate laws of nature, impressed upon the material world, are\r\nnothing less than the direct power of the Almighty upholding the\r\nuniverse, and controlling all its operations throughout all time from\r\nthe origin of the creation to its end, if it shall have one. We cannot\r\nlook upon the system of nature as a piece of machinery, wound up and set\r\na-going, and destined to run its appointed course, with only an\r\noccasional glance of its Author to interfere with its regular working.\r\nWe do not suppose that this constant exercise of power imposes any\r\nburden upon the Author of the creation; nor are we conscious of any\r\ndiminution of his glory, or any denial of his absolute personality, when\r\nwe consider him as being ever present in all his works, 'animating,\r\ninforming, and shaping them,' by the perpetual exertion of his\r\nomnipotent will.\r\n\r\nWe do not, by any means, understand our contributor as denying the\r\nagency of the Almighty in the establishment of general laws; but his\r\nview of the subject is totally different from ours. If we have not\r\nmisconceived his meaning entirely, he considers the laws of nature as\r\nsomething independent of the operations which they control--a _tertium\r\nquid_ interposed between the creator and his work. God is the author;\r\nlaw is the active agent; and material changes are the results. Law is\r\nnot spirit; and therefore matter is not moved and controlled by spirit.\r\nWe entirely disclaim any want of respect for our contributor and his\r\nthoughts; but we must express our surprise that he should resort to this\r\nclumsy and unphilosophical theory, in order to deny the direct agency of\r\nspirit in the operations of nature. Law is not separate and distinct\r\nfrom the phenomena which it regulates. It is only a rule or principle,\r\nas he himself admits, 'which ceases to be with the accomplishment of its\r\nend.' This rule or principle, which implies intelligence and will, must\r\nbe in the mind of the Author, who operates in accordance with it, and\r\nnot in the mere matter whose changes it controls. Yet our author\r\nstrangely says, 'all the objects of nature are the products, not of\r\nspirit, but of law, which is itself the product of the one great\r\nCreative Spirit whereby all things are.'\r\n\r\nBut let us admit that this extraordinary theory is sound, and that LAW\r\nis the active agent which controls all physical phenomena. Now this\r\nthing, called LAW, must be either spirit or matter, or a compound of\r\nboth. If it be spirit, then it acts upon matter directly; if, on the\r\ncontrary, it be itself matter, then spirit acts upon it; and, finally,\r\nif it be a compound of the two, then it affords still stronger evidence\r\nof reciprocal effects, which are decisive of the whole question in\r\ndispute. We are conscious, however, that this reasoning is almost\r\npuerile; for laws are mere abstractions, and not actual entities. They\r\nindicate the mode in which causes produce effects; in other words, they\r\nare signs of the intention and purpose with which the Great Spirit\r\ncarries on all his mighty works.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary, in order to sustain our position, to follow the\r\nsteps of our contributor, in his attempted investigation of the mode of\r\ncommunication between the human soul and the outer world, through the\r\nsenses. Many of his ideas might afford ground for interesting comment.\r\nBut the point in dispute is too distinct and circumscribed to require\r\nmany words for its elucidation. It is sufficient to say that in the\r\nprocess of perception through sensation, there must be some point of\r\ncontact, at which the mind and the material object perceived by it are\r\nbrought into the relations of mutual influence. Whenever a material\r\nobject is cognized, there is a direct effect of matter upon the mind.\r\nAnd so, likewise, in every case of voluntary muscular exertion, the\r\nmandate of the will is communicated through the nerves, and the spirit\r\nthus acts directly upon matter. No refinement of theory will avail to\r\nget rid of these obvious facts; for, whatever intermediate agencies may\r\nbe imagined by way of explanation, they leave the ultimate truth\r\nindisputable, that in some mysterious way, spirit and matter do\r\neffectually operate upon each other.\r\n\r\nWe are in no degree committed to the doctrines of modern spiritualism,\r\nand we shall not take issue with our contributor in his vehement protest\r\nagainst the belief that disembodied spirits ever visit 'the warm\r\nprecincts of the cheerful day,' and make themselves known to living\r\nmortals. An orthodox Christian, however, might have some hesitation, in\r\nview of certain passages of Scripture, in utterly denying the\r\n_possibility_ of such phenomena; and every reader of history and student\r\nof philosophy might well exclaim with Tennyson:\r\n\r\n                    'Dare I say\r\n    No spirit ever brake the band\r\n    That stays him from the native land\r\n  Where first he walked when wrapped in clay?'\r\n\r\nBut we are quite as far from having asserted the existence of such\r\npreternatural phenomena, and we shall surely not attempt to establish\r\nfacts of which we have no experience whatever. All that we have done has\r\nbeen merely to question the validity of that curt and summary argument,\r\nwhich assumes that matter and spirit are incapable of acting upon each\r\nother, and in this way cuts off all investigation.\r\n\r\nWe were somewhat disappointed and discouraged as we followed our\r\ncontributor into that passage in which he seems to think that after\r\ndeath, the soul of man is removed beyond all knowledge of material\r\nthings, and becomes incapable of ever perceiving their existence. It is\r\ntrue, this is but the logical deduction from his premises; and yet we\r\nfelt some emotions of terror--some shrinking from that great and\r\nimpassable gulf which he represents as then to be fixed between us and\r\nthe objects of our life-long acquaintance--'the gulf which separates\r\ntime from eternity.' But we were soon relieved; for in the conclusion of\r\nhis article he waxes eloquent upon the higher faculties with which the\r\nsoul will doubtless be endowed in its new state of existence, and with\r\napparent unconsciousness of all inconsistency, assumes the very opposite\r\nof the whole preceding part of his argument. 'But,' he exclaims, 'when\r\nwe shall stand in all the nakedness of _pure, unfettered spirit_,' 'and\r\ngaze with all the clearness of unveiled spiritual vision _upon the\r\nwonderful mechanism of the universe_,' etc. We might inquire of our\r\nauthor how, upon his principles, with merely spiritual vision, we can\r\nexpect to behold anything so gross and material as the mechanism of the\r\nuniverse; but we overlook and forgive the apparent inconsistency--we are\r\nwilling ourselves to be vanquished in the argument--for the sake of the\r\nnoble idea that we may hereafter 'pass from blindness to far-stretching,\r\nunimpeded sight,' and 'be able at a glance _to count the very stars_,\r\nand to see the network of laws which binds them to their places, and\r\ncontrols, not only their motions, but the minutest particulars of their\r\ninternal organism.' We are thankful, at all events, that, though matter\r\nand spirit may be so far apart in this our mortal state of existence, in\r\nthe spiritual world, at least, we shall not lose all memory and\r\nknowledge of the grand material creation, of which we have learned so\r\nlittle here, but shall still be able, with even clearer vision, to\r\nperceive and comprehend the works of God, and, in the light of a nobler\r\nunderstanding, to adore the unfathomable wisdom which the Omnipotent\r\nSpirit has displayed in the arrangements of the boundless universe--the\r\nmagnificent dwelling place of his creature man.\r\n\r\n  F. P. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRATERRITORIALITY IN CHINA.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory pays no more than a just tribute to commerce, when she accords\r\nto that agency important civilizing influences; yet it must be admitted\r\nthat it has frequently pursued a tortuous course, has often been\r\nunscrupulous in the means that it has employed, and has not always been\r\nreciprocal in its advantages. Like religion, it has been used as an\r\nopening wedge to conquest. As the establishment of a factory in Bengal\r\nprepared the way for the battle of Plassy, so the founding of a mission\r\nin Manilla led to the subjugation of the Philippines. Or as, in our day,\r\nopium breached the walls of China, so the Society of Jesus, by its labor\r\nin Anam, has caused the dismemberment of that empire. British commerce\r\ndemanded for its development successive wars. Gallican religion exacts\r\nfrom each dynasty the employment of the sword as an auxiliary of\r\npropagandism.\r\n\r\nThese aggressions have been facilitated by the assumption, on the part\r\nof Christian powers, of the exemption of their subjects from local\r\njurisdiction in Mohammedan and pagan countries. A factory or a mission\r\nis established, which, from the outset, is an _imperium in imperio_, and\r\nbecomes a permanent conspiracy which soon finds causes of complaint\r\nagainst the government of the land in which, without invitation, its\r\nmembers have become domiciled. Essentially this is filibusterism, more\r\ndangerous because more insidious than an armed invasion; it has caused\r\nnearly all the collisions which have occurred in oriental and occidental\r\nintercourse. If, in the discussions that have arisen on eastern\r\nquestions, this consideration of the subject had not been wholly\r\nignored, the courses pursued by western powers would be even less\r\ndefensible than they have been made to appear. No one can arrive at\r\ncorrect conclusions on questions affecting China, Japan, Siam and other\r\npagan states without an attentive consideration of the claims which\r\nthose weak countries have upon us in view of their being compelled to\r\njoin the family of nations, and render themselves amenable to\r\ninternational law, while they are debarred from the semblance of\r\nreciprocity.\r\n\r\nExtraterritoriality originated in the Levant. The mercantile\r\nestablishments that sprang up in Western Asia and Northern Africa, as\r\nMoslem power began to wane, partook of a semi-official character; being\r\nrecognized as an appendage of the diplomatic corps of that country, it\r\nbecame the practice to accord to the trading Frank the exemption from\r\nlocal jurisdiction which was accorded to the official representative of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nThis abdication of authority, on the part of those states, has been\r\neffected gradually, and the usurpation on the part of Christian powers\r\nhas only been perfected and secured by treaty in our own day. Great\r\nBritain, in her treaty with the emperor of Morocco (1760), agreed that\r\n'if there shall happen any quarrel or dispute between an Englishman and\r\na Mussulman, by which any of them shall receive detriment, the same\r\nshall be heard and determined by the emperor _alone_.'\r\n\r\nIn the following year we find the sublime Porte, in a treaty with\r\nPrussia, jealously guarding Turkish interterritorial rights, stipulating\r\nthat the Ottoman tribunals should take cognizance of cases arising\r\nbetween Prussian subjects and those of the Porte. All that the Porte was\r\nthen willing to concede, was the presence of the Prussian consul at\r\nsuch trials, and the privilege of adjudicating in disputes arising\r\nbetween his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn the treaty between France and Algiers (1764), it was agreed that\r\noffences occurring at _sea_, should be tried by the French consul, when\r\nthe offender was a Frenchman; and by the dey, when the offender was an\r\nAlgerine. And, at the same time, in her treaty with Morocco, France\r\nmerely secured the stipulation that 'if a Frenchman should strike a\r\nsubject of Morocco, he shall be tried only in presence of his consul,\r\nwho shall defend his cause, and he shall be judged impartially.' A\r\nFrench edict of 1778, in reference to the duties of consuls, alludes to\r\ntrials occurring in Constantinople, which clearly admit interterritorial\r\njurisdiction. The Republic, in 1801, also admitted that right on the\r\npart of Moslem states.\r\n\r\nAlgiers, in her treaty with Denmark (1792), expressly provides for\r\njurisdiction over the Danes in her dominion.\r\n\r\nRussia negotiated a treaty, in 1783, with the Porte, stipulating only\r\nfor the privilege of exercising jurisdiction through her ministers or\r\nconsuls, in cases of quarrels between Russians.\r\n\r\nSpain was content, in 1784, to secure from Tripoli the presence in a\r\nTripolitan court of a Spanish consul on the trial of a Spaniard.\r\n\r\nOur own country uniformly conceded to Barbary powers entire jurisdiction\r\nover our resident citizens. The treaty with Morocco (1787) reads: 'When\r\na citizen of the United States kills or wounds a subject of Morocco, or\r\nif a subject of Morocco kills or wounds a citizen of the United States,\r\nthe laws of the country are to be followed; equal justice, and the\r\npresence of the consul, being alone stipulated for.' And in the treaty\r\nwith Algiers (1816), we merely require that the 'sentence of punishment\r\nof an American citizen shall not be greater, or more severe, than it\r\nwould be against a Turk in the same predicament.'\r\n\r\nWith Tunis there was the same understanding. Again, in the treaty of\r\n1836, with Morocco, no claim is made for jurisdiction by us over our\r\ncitizens; the presence of the consul at a trial being deemed a\r\nsufficient guarantee for an equitable trial; showing, that up to that\r\ndate Morocco resisted the extraterritorial aggression to which the\r\nOttoman power had already yielded.\r\n\r\nSo far as appears from Marten's _Recueil des Traités_, the Sublime Porte\r\nwas the first to yield the point, suffering it to go by default,\r\nhowever, of exempting resident foreigners from local jurisdiction,\r\nrather than by a formal abdication of authority in a treaty. The\r\nearliest admission that we have met with, strange to say, occurs in the\r\nUnited States' treaty, negotiated with Turkey in 1830. 'If litigation\r\nand disputes should arise between subjects of the Sublime Porte and\r\ncitizens of the United States, the parties shall not be heard, nor shall\r\njudgment be pronounced, unless the American dragoman be present.\r\nCitizens of the United States, committing an offence, shall not be\r\narrested and put to prison by the local authorities, but they shall be\r\ntried by their minister or consul, and punished according to their\r\noffence, following in this respect the _usage_ observed toward other\r\nFranks.'\r\n\r\nWith Persia, in 1856, we stipulated only that the American consul shall\r\nbe present at the tribunal, when Americans are parties in a trial.\r\n\r\nOur earliest treaty in Eastern Asia was negotiated in 1833, with Siam,\r\nwith which power we agreed, 'that merchants of the United States,\r\ntrading in the kingdom of Siam, shall respect and _follow_ the laws and\r\n_customs_ of the country in _all_ points'--conceding not only\r\ninterterritoriality to the fullest extent; but making it the duty of\r\nAmerican traders to creep on all fours when in the presence of a high\r\nfunctionary of that kingdom, and to become orthodox Buddhists!\r\nInadvertently, no doubt, going farther than Joel Barlow, who thought it\r\nexpedient in his treaty with Tripoli (1797) to insert a sort of\r\ndisclaimer against Christianity, inserting in the treaty, 'the\r\nGovernment of the United States is not in any sense founded on the\r\nChristian religion,' a sort of offset, in accordance with the fashion of\r\nthe period, to the Austrian treaty of nearly the same date, which was\r\nnegotiated in the name of the 'Most Holy Trinity.'\r\n\r\nAs regards Mohammedan countries, it is not likely that grave evils will\r\nsoon arise from the exempting of foreigners from local jurisdiction;\r\nthere is yet so much vigor in the government of those states, and so\r\nmuch vindictiveness toward the giaour foreigners there will be deterred\r\nfrom those practices which render them a terror to the more servile\r\npeople of Buddhist countries. But the extension of the principle to\r\nEastern Asia has been extremely disastrous to the peoples of those\r\ncountries, and has not been unattended by inimical reflex influences on\r\nthe wrong doers of the West.\r\n\r\nTo understand the operation of extraterritorial jurisdiction, let us\r\nsuppose the principle to be applied to ourselves. A European merchant or\r\nsailor inflicts corporal chastisement on one of our citizens in\r\nBroadway, and the prestige which the foreigner enjoys, precludes\r\ninterference on the part of bystanders and police. If the New Yorker\r\nhappens to be desirous of obtaining redress, he must first discover and\r\nidentify the assailant, and next ascertain his nationality. [A Chinaman,\r\nin like circumstances, would find as much trouble in arriving at the\r\ntruth, as if he were to attempt the investigation of the assailant's\r\npedigree; he knows as little of our nationalities as we do of the forty\r\ntribes of Borneo.] Our persevering citizen succeeds at length in lodging\r\na complaint at the consulate of the offender. The consul is perhaps a\r\nfellow merchant of the defendant, or head of the firm to which the\r\noffender is consigned. The complainant is accommodated with a blundering\r\ninterpreter, and the case is tried according to the foreigner's code,\r\nwhich, on such occasions, is endowed with more than wonted elasticity.\r\nIf, contrary to all probability, the foreigner is convicted, the citizen\r\nhas the satisfaction of seeing the foreign assailant placed in\r\nconfinement on the consul's premises, or perhaps mulcted to a small\r\namount; and with this administration of justice, he and his country must\r\nbe content. Who does not see that such an abdication of authority on our\r\npart would lead to the perpetration of wrongs that would soon become\r\nunendurable, even if we were first to become a broken spirited people?\r\nAnd, considering the arrogance and recklessness of many foreigners in\r\nChina, and the pusillanimous character of the natives, what can be\r\nexpected but contempt and aggression on one side, and mistrust and\r\nfinesse on the other? What but a chronic discontent, wholly incompatible\r\nwith healthful commerce and peaceful intercourse, can be expected from\r\nsuch a state of things? Consider further that this occurs among a people\r\nof the highest antiquity, with a history and a civilization of which\r\nthey are justly proud; who, in political and moral science, were in\r\nadvance of Greece and Rome, at a time when those, whom they now\r\ndesignate 'barbarians,' really were so. When our ancestors were half\r\nnaked savages, the Chinese were a polished literary people. In calling\r\nattention to this subject we do so, not less in the interest of our\r\noriental clients than in that of our own lands; for our relations with\r\nthe empire of China will, with the growth of our power on the Pacific,\r\nassume such importance, that good policy demands that we should avoid\r\nany course likely to render hostile such a large portion of the human\r\nrace. Many years ago we deprecated Chinese emigration into California,\r\non the ground that, as _prolétaires_, they would degrade labor, and\r\nleave that State without its most important element of strength; yet to\r\nthe Chinese, in their own country, we would pursue a conciliatory\r\ninstead of a domineering course.\r\n\r\nHardly had the Portuguese doubled the Cape of Good Hope, when the\r\nChinese, who had but imperfectly resisted aggression from neighboring\r\ncountries, began to suffer annoyance from the 'barbarians from the\r\nWestern Ocean.' At an early day the Portuguese established a factory at\r\nthe mouth of the river on which Ningpo is situated. The factory became a\r\ncolony, and the colony a little state. 'At the origin of colonies,' says\r\nM. Cochin, 'we find in general two men, a filibuster and a missionary.\r\nTo go so far, one must have either a devil in his body, or God in his\r\nheart. When to these two men is joined a third--a ruler--all goes on\r\nwell; the first subjugates, the second converts, and the third\r\norganizes.' All these went to work in China: as elsewhere, affairs went\r\non well as regards filibuster, missionary, and ruler. Courts of justice,\r\nhospitals, seminaries, and military posts were established. Natives\r\njoined the colonists in large numbers, adopting the foreign dress,\r\ncustoms, and religion, without a moment's hesitation. If the Chinese had\r\nbeen as few in number as the Aztecs, a Portuguese dominion would soon\r\nhave arisen in Cathay; but the raids made by the colonists, the slaying\r\nof villagers, the violation and carrying off of women, the cruelty and\r\nrobberies of the Christians, became so intolerable that the whole region\r\nwas aroused, and the colonists exterminated. From that period Europeans\r\nwere rigorously restricted to the port of Canton, and the coast enjoyed\r\nquiet, except interrupted by an occasional buccaneer, until the present\r\ncentury, when the opium traffic brought violent men to every port.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese were not the only sufferers from trespassing upon the\r\nsoil of China. Twenty Japanese filibusters were boiled to death in the\r\nstreets of Ningpo, by order of an envoy of their country, who then\r\n(1406) happened to be in Peking. All their intercourse with foreigners\r\nseemed to confirm Chinamen in the belief that the barbarians were in\r\ntheir dispositions like wild beasts, unamenable to reason, and to be\r\ntreated accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith feelings of mutual mistrust and hostility, commerce was long\r\nconducted by Europeans and Chinese at Canton. The question of foreign\r\nexemption from local jurisdiction only came up for discussion in cases\r\nof homicide; but in every instance the Chinese insisted on their right\r\nto punish the murderer. Foreign resistance to the claim was based only\r\non the unwillingness of the Chinese to distinguish between killing by\r\naccident, in self-defence, or from malice. In the Chinese code such\r\ndistinctions exist; but life for life was the inexorable demand when a\r\nnative was slain by a foreigner; it was not, however, so much jealousy\r\nof foreign jurisdiction, as a desire of revenge, that actuated them, as\r\nwas shown on many occasions. Whenever foreigners tried and executed one\r\nof their number for a murder of a Chinaman, the mandarins and people\r\nwere satisfied. It was the practice of the local authorities to make a\r\nrepresentation to the emperor to the effect that such trials and\r\nexecutions were in obedience to their orders, the foreigners being their\r\nsubmissive agents. The real difficulties occurred when an accidental or\r\nextenuating homicide took place, or where there was insufficient proof\r\nof the guilt of the accused. The condign punishment of those convicted\r\ndid not meet the requirements of the Chinese authorities. They seized,\r\nand held as hostages, countrymen of the murderer, and demanded blood for\r\nblood, seeking not justice but revenge. The object was explicitly\r\nexpressed by the emperor Kienlung, in an edict (1749): 'It is incumbent\r\nto have life for life, in order to frighten and repress the foreigner.'\r\n\r\nFour years subsequent to the issuing of the edict of Kienlung, the\r\nCanton local government memorialized the emperor to disallow to\r\nforeigners the privilege of appeal, when sentenced to death. Except in\r\ntimes of insurrection no Chinaman can be executed until his death\r\nwarrant is signed by the emperor. In compliance with that memorial,\r\nforeigners, guilty of homicide, were outlawed. It was formally announced\r\nthat 'The barbarians are like beasts, and not to be ruled on the same\r\nprinciples as citizens. Were any to attempt controlling them by the\r\ngreat maxim of reason, it would tend to nothing but confusion. The\r\nancient kings well understood this, and accordingly ruled barbarians by\r\nmisrule. Therefore, to rule barbarians by misrule is the true way of\r\nruling them.' It suited the purpose of European residents at Canton to\r\ndescant upon the arrogance and inhumanity of the Chinese, as manifested\r\nby proceedings based upon those hostile edicts, while the provocations\r\nwhich explained and extenuated them were studiously concealed.\r\n\r\nConsidered apart from the misdemeanors of foreigners, the measures of\r\nthe Chinese authorities justified the appeal to arms by the nation,\r\nwhose interests were chiefly concerned in commercial dealings with that\r\nempire. The supremacy claimed by the Chinese over all countries\r\noccasioned frequent altercations between the mandarins at Canton and the\r\nEnglish officers who were in charge of the East India Company's factory\r\nin that city. Hostile collisions were, however, comparatively\r\nunfrequent, owing to the authority exercised over all British subjects\r\nby the East India Company, that body having authority to deport any of\r\ntheir countrymen who acted disorderly. Their proceedings in that way\r\ngave a tone to the entire foreign community, and as intercourse was\r\nrestricted to a single port, where the people were jealous, and\r\nmandarins vigilant, murderous affrays did not often take place; yet,\r\nwhen they did occur, the Chinese were resolute in claiming jurisdiction\r\nin each instance. In cases of assault, pecuniary recompense always\r\nsatisfied the complainant; and in business transactions mutual\r\nconfidence in each other's integrity rendered official intervention\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThus, except in cases of homicide, the foreign claim of exemption from\r\nlocal jurisdiction was tacitly admitted, and no inconvenience followed.\r\nBut where life was lost, even when both the murderer and his victim were\r\nforeigners, the right to try and execute the guilty was contended for,\r\nand in some cases admitted. Kienlung's demand of 'life for life' was\r\nalways made, an innocent victim being not less acceptable than the real\r\nculprit. On one occasion (1772), when a Chinaman was killed in the\r\nPortuguese settlement of Macao, an Englishman, demanded by the Chinese,\r\nwhom the Portuguese admitted to be guiltless, was by them given up, and\r\nby the Chinese strangled, to meet the claim of life for life. No regard\r\nwas had for those who by accident caused loss of life. In 1780 a native\r\nwas killed by the firing of a salute from an English vessel. The\r\nmandarins decoyed the supercargo and held him as a hostage until the\r\ngunner was delivered up. The innocent cause of the calamity was given up\r\nunder a promise from the mandarins that he should have a fair trial, and\r\nthat his life should not be endangered. He was immediately strangled. In\r\n1821 an Italian sailor, in the service of an American merchantman, was\r\nthe indirect cause of the death of a China boatwoman, who was by the\r\nside of his vessel. Trade was stopped until the poor man was delivered\r\nup; the committee of American merchants, in the examination of the\r\nsailor, protested against its irregularity. In sending the prisoner to\r\nbe strangled, they said, 'We are bound to submit to your laws, while in\r\nyour waters; be they ever so unjust, we will not resist them.' A\r\nplausible reason for a culpable act. They should have allowed the trade\r\nto stop, and quit the Chinese waters, rather than become parties to the\r\nmurder of the Italian.\r\n\r\nThe abrogation of the monopoly of the East India Company, and the rapid\r\nextension of the illicit traffic in opium, caused a great influx of\r\nforeigners into China, who often forced their way to ports where\r\nintercourse was prohibited; these were among the causes which prepared\r\nthe way for the war with Great Britain; but the question which\r\nprecipitated that war, was one touching Chinese jurisdiction over\r\ncontraband merchandise, smuggled into the empire in defiance of the\r\nefforts of the Chinese authorities to keep it out. Opium, the bane of\r\ntheir race, was stored up in the foreigners' vessels in Chinese waters.\r\nTo obtain possession of the fatal drug, they placed the foreigners in\r\nduresse. The opium war followed, and next the treaty of Nanking, which\r\nsecured all that Britain desired, save the legalization of the opium\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nNeither in the treaty of Nanking, nor the supplementary treaty, was the\r\nconcession of exemption of British subjects from local Chinese\r\njurisdiction formally expressed. Security to British subjects was\r\nguaranteed, while the British Government stipulated that they should\r\nkeep a ship of war at each port 'to restrain sailors on board the\r\nEnglish merchant vessels, which power the consuls may also avail\r\nthemselves of, to keep in order the merchants of Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies.'\r\n\r\nThat the Chinese regarded the principle of extraterritoriality as having\r\nbeen conceded, was shown by their ready assent to the insertion in the\r\nAmerican treaty of a clause formally abdicating sovereignty to that\r\nextent. Our treaty says: 'Subjects of China, who may be guilty of any\r\ncriminal act toward citizens of the United States, shall be arrested and\r\npunished by the Chinese authorities, according to the laws of China; and\r\ncitizens of the United States, who may commit any crime in China, shall\r\nbe tried and punished by the consul or other public functionary of the\r\nUnited States.' Provision was made for joint action between American and\r\nChinese officials in certain cases. It was also stipulated that there\r\nshould be no interference by the Chinese in any misunderstanding that\r\nmight arise between Americans and people of other foreign countries.\r\n\r\nIn the third treaty--that negotiated by the French--foreign exemption\r\nfrom Chinese law was yet more explicitly declared: 'Every Frenchman, who\r\nharbors resentment or ill will toward a Chinese, ought first to inform\r\nthe consul thereof, who will again distinctly investigate the matter,\r\nand endeavor to settle it. If a Chinese has a grudge against a\r\nFrenchman, the consul must impartially examine and fully arrange it for\r\nhim. But if any dispute should arise, which the consul is unable to\r\nassuage, he will request the Chinese officer to coöperate in arranging\r\nthe matter, and having investigated the facts, justly bring the same to\r\na conclusion. If there is any strife between French and Chinese, or any\r\nfight occurs in which one, two, or more men are wounded, or killed by\r\nfirearms, or other weapons, the Chinese will, in such cases, be\r\napprehended and punished, according to the laws of the Central Empire;\r\nthe consul will use means to apprehend the Frenchmen, speedily\r\ninvestigate the matter, and punish them according to the French law.\r\nFrance will in future establish laws for their punishment. All other\r\nmatters, not distinctly stated in this paragraph, will be arranged\r\naccording to this, and greater or lesser crimes committed by the French,\r\nwill be judged according to French law.'\r\n\r\nChina, stunned by the blows so unexpectedly inflicted by the barbarians,\r\nwhom she despised and thought herself able to exterminate, made no\r\nresistance to the demands made for extraterritoriality. As a Chinaman\r\ndoes not hesitate to commit suicide when excited and alarmed, so\r\nTaukwang quietly acquiesced in terms which were fatal to the\r\nindependence of his empire. When, subsequently, the English demanded\r\nfrom the Siamese similar conditions, those people, although feeble and\r\nservile, could not easily be made to brook the degradation. Sir John\r\nBowring, who negotiated the treaty with that state, says, in his Kingdom\r\nand Prospects of Siam, 'The most difficult part of my negotiation was\r\nthe emancipation of British subjects from subjection to Siamese\r\nauthority.' Who can wonder? The emancipation of the guests required for\r\nits complement the disfranchisement of the host! The fact that the\r\nSiamese were aware of the nature of the concession affords hope that\r\nthey will succeed in averting some of its mischievous consequences.\r\nSubsequently the Siamese made the same concession to Americans, thus\r\nabrogating our former self-stultifying stipulation.\r\n\r\nMr. Urquhart, in his work on Turkey and its Resources, expresses the\r\nopinion that the Ottoman empire and the Barbary States have acted\r\nunwisely in exempting resident Franks from jurisdiction; on which Mr.\r\nCushing, who negotiated our treaty, remarked, when attorney-general of\r\nthe United States: 'It may be unwise for them; but it will be time\r\nenough for them to obtain jurisdiction over Christian foreigners, when\r\nthese last can visit Mecca, Damascus, or Fez as safely and freely as\r\nthey do Rome and Paris, and when submission to local jurisdiction\r\nbecomes reciprocal.' When have Mohammedans or Pagans refused submission\r\nto rulers in Christian lands? As regards China, Christian travellers\r\nenjoy the same immunities there that are accorded to them in Europe or\r\nAmerica--they are safe and free; it is not easy, therefore, to frame a\r\nvalid reason for extraterritorial practice in that empire.\r\n\r\nNo less a jurist than John Quincy Adams, in a lecture on the British war\r\nwith China, delivered before the Massachusetts Historical Society\r\n(December, 1841), pronounced the cause of Britain 'righteous.' Mr.\r\nAdams, however, proceeded on the assumption that the real matter at\r\nissue was whether the assumption of Chinese supremacy should be admitted\r\nor not. He regarded the opium question as a mere incident in the\r\ncontroversy, and entirely overlooked the other question at issue, viz.,\r\nthe independence of China.\r\n\r\nLet us now observe the operation of the extraterritorial policy. Besides\r\nCanton, four other ports were opened for trade, and the grant is made to\r\nEngland of full sovereignty of the island of Hongkong, commanding the\r\nentrance of the Pearl or Canton river. If the Chinese had been able to\r\nrestrict its concession to the three treaty powers, England, United\r\nStates, and France, the baneful consequences might have been easily\r\ncontrolled, for these countries immediately empowered their consuls to\r\nexercise jurisdiction over their respective countrymen. In one respect,\r\nCongress fully met the demands made upon the country by the position\r\nwhich we with others had assumed in China. Laws sufficiently stringent\r\nwere enacted for the government of our citizens in that empire; but the\r\nconsular system, that was inaugurated to meet the new order of things,\r\nwas so defective, as to render those laws nearly inoperative. The\r\nsalaries attached to these offices being totally inadequate, competent\r\npersons could not be induced to accept appointments; or when accepted,\r\nthey were relinquished as soon as the incumbent became fully qualified\r\nby experience for the discharge of consular duties. Having to act as a\r\nmagistrate, some knowledge of law was requisite; and having peculiar\r\ndiplomatic duties to perform, considerable knowledge of Chinese polity,\r\nhistory, and customs was needed. The consequence was, as regards\r\nAmericans, such a lax administration of justice that our disorderly\r\ncountrymen were not subject to due restraint; and as American offenders\r\neasily eluded apprehension, or escaped punishment, lawless British\r\nsubjects often found it advantageous to claim to be American citizens,\r\ninsomuch as to cause irreparable damage to American character and\r\ninfluence. When the ports were first opened for trade, no people were\r\nregarded with as much favor as our countrymen; but since that period we\r\nhave lost ground, and our influence has been greatly impaired through\r\nthose causes.\r\n\r\nThe British consular system was made a service, its members being fairly\r\nremunerated and induced to make their occupation the profession of their\r\nlives; consequently the Government has at all times competent and\r\nreliable servants. British consuls, moreover, in their magisterial\r\ncapacity were a terror to evil doers, the means placed at their disposal\r\nfor repressing the unruly were ample; while the American consul, being\r\nunprovided with interpreters, and ignorant of the language, having no\r\nconstable or marshal, clerks or assistants of any kind, and having no\r\nplace wherein to confine a criminal, often failed to inspire respect.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, from the subjects of non-treaty powers that China was\r\ndestined to suffer most from her concession of extraterritoriality. Men\r\nof every clime and nation claimed exemption from her laws. Vagabonds,\r\nwhose government had no consular authority to restrain them, boldly\r\ndefied the local authorities, becoming a law unto themselves. Lawless\r\nadventurers from the gold regions of Australia and California personated\r\nthose nationalities; and the bewildered Chinese often despaired of\r\nsuccess in distinguishing even the names of the nationalities they were\r\ncalled to encounter. When discharging consular duties in Ningpo, the\r\nmandarins frequently consulted us, soliciting information on this\r\nsubject; they were apprehensive of offending one government or another,\r\nwhile seeking to afford protection to their own people.\r\n\r\nOne disastrous result of the war with England was the discovery by the\r\nChinese of the impotency of their rulers. No sooner had the lawless\r\namong them seen the ease with which a few foreigners dictated terms to\r\nthe hitherto formidable mandarins, than they took to the sea as pirates.\r\nIn a short space of time the coast became so infested by these\r\nmarauders, that Chinese junks dared not put to sea without being under\r\nthe convoy of a foreign, square-rigged vessel. A lucrative business soon\r\nsprang up in convoying. A foreign merchantman would sail in company with\r\na fleet of junks, and by his presence intimidate the Chinese pirate.\r\nGradually this business was monopolized by the Portuguese; the proximity\r\nof their Chinese possession, Macao, enabled them to fit out lorchas, or\r\ncoasting sloops, which, being manned largely by Manilla men, were able\r\nto serve as a cheap and effective navy for the Chinese mercantile\r\nmarine. Enjoying exemption from all control, these armed, irresponsible\r\nlorchamen early began to dictate terms to the Chinese mariners, and in a\r\nfew months the unfortunate Chinaman was puzzled which to avoid, the\r\npiratical junk or the buccaneering lorcha, the extortions of the latter\r\nbeing as damaging as the robberies of the former. He was no more at\r\nliberty to decline the protection of a Portuguese convoy, on the terms\r\nwhich the foreigner saw fit to impose, than to refuse the demands of the\r\nprofessed pirate.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese pirates, finding their occupation so much interfered with by\r\ntheir foreign rivals, turned their attention to the poor fishermen, whom\r\nthey mercilessly plundered. Foreign protection was invoked; and the\r\nprotection of this important branch of industry was committed to the\r\nunprincipled lorchamen. When junkmen and fishermen discovered that the\r\nextortions of the foreigner were damaging as the exactions of the native\r\npirate, they tried to make terms with the latter; but it was too late.\r\nIt was no longer optional with them to accept or refuse protection.\r\nBlack mail was levied upon all with the method and certainty of a\r\nrevenue service. This was not effected without violence and bloodshed;\r\nbut of this there were none to take cognizance. The outrages were\r\nperpetrated at ports or off coast, where there were no consuls. Hence\r\nanarchy reigned at all points beyond the precincts of the consular\r\nports.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of such a condition of things to extend; and it was not\r\nlong before the lawless foreigners, chiefly Portuguese, but with a\r\nmixture of English, Americans, and all other nationalities, carried\r\ntheir depredations to the villages on the islands and mainland. Robbery\r\nand murder at sea were succeeded by like crimes on land. Whole villages\r\nwere reduced to ashes; the men butchered, and the women violated; some\r\nbeing carried on board the lorchas and held to ransom. Chinese officials\r\nwere slain on attempting to resist the corsairs. Much of our surgical\r\npractice in China was due to these piracies and forays.\r\n\r\nAdventurers, who could not command a lorcha, fitted up native boats, and\r\nhoisting some foreign flag, carried on like depredations in the\r\nestuaries and rivers. Others went so far as to open offices in the small\r\ntowns for the sale of passes, which boats crossing from headland to\r\nheadland were compelled to show, in order to escape from greater\r\nexactions when under way. Not a small part of the wrongs thus\r\nperpetrated were by natives attired in foreign habiliments and under\r\nforeign direction. Such was the fear entertained of foreigners, that a\r\nbold and unscrupulous man could do anything with impunity. Take the\r\nfollowing occurrence as an illustration: At the mouth of the Ningpo\r\nriver is a small village of salt makers, at which the salt commissioner\r\nstations a deputy. This officer, after having been cruelly beaten, was\r\ndriven away by the Portuguese, who issued a proclamation authorizing\r\ntheir employés to collect the salt gabel in the name of the Portuguese\r\nconsul!\r\n\r\nIt is proper to remark that the transition from the protective to the\r\npiratical character of the lorchas was owing in some measure to the\r\nfatuous procedure of the mandarins themselves toward a formidable body\r\nof pirates, whose submission they purchased by conferring ranks and\r\nemoluments on the chiefs, and by giving employment to the whole fleet,\r\nconstituting them guardians of the coast. In transforming the wolves\r\ninto shepherds, a change of occupation was not attended by a change of\r\ncharacter. In their new capacity as legalized fleecers, they came into\r\ncollision with those of Macao; and what they lost as convoyers, they\r\naimed to gain as pirates.\r\n\r\nA general massacre of the Portuguese at Ningpo, by the Cantonese\r\npirates, served to mitigate the evil by calling the attention of the\r\nEnglish and Portuguese authorities to the anarchy which drew much of its\r\nsupport from Hongkong and Macao. The Portuguese were subjected to\r\ngreater restraint, and a greater degree of order was thereby secured.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to estimate the evil effects upon China of the possession\r\nof Hongkong and of Macao by the Portuguese. They are like corroding\r\nulcers in her side. Imagine Bermuda and Nassau just off Sandy Hook, with\r\nevery conceivable facility for smuggling into the port of New York;\r\nsuppose the contraband traffic to be fatal to the health and morals of\r\nour citizens, as well as prejudicial to our revenue, and then\r\nextraterritorial privilege giving immunity to many of the foreigners'\r\nmisdeeds; and the difficult position of Chinese authorities will be\r\npartially appreciated.\r\n\r\nIt was in part a question of jurisdiction that led to the second war\r\nwith England--the 'lorcha' war. But for the assumption, on the part of\r\nthe British, that the Chinese were in a measure a subjugated people, or\r\nnot in possession of full sovereignty, they could not have again invaded\r\nChina with any show of reason.\r\n\r\nOn the breaking out of hostilities there was a general demand, on the\r\npart of all mercantile powers, for the entire and unrestricted opening\r\nof the Chinese empire to all foreigners. At that juncture we felt called\r\nupon to remonstrate against such injustice toward an unoffending\r\ncountry. In a series of articles, published in the _North China Herald_,\r\nwe attempted to show that an unqualified compliance with the demands of\r\nchambers of commerce and the press would be inimical to foreign no less\r\nthan to Chinese interests: 'With one voice Christian nations demand the\r\nentire opening of China, and an extension of commercial advantages,\r\nregardless of Chinese rights in the matter. I believe that these rights\r\ncannot be infringed with impunity. China, it is true, must succumb\r\nbefore a requisite force; but the real difficulties of the aggressors\r\nwill only then commence. Let us consider the consequences of an\r\nunconditional compliance with the demands of foreigners. You shall see\r\nthe horrid barbarities, which have devastated the coast, reënacted in\r\nthe interior. You shall see the adventurers, who shoot down Chinamen\r\nwith no more malice or compunction than they shoot a pheasant, go\r\nfurther and travel faster than consul, merchant, or missionary. Murder,\r\nrobbery, rape, and the like, will be common wherever the arm of\r\nauthority is unfelt. Up her far-reaching rivers, along her interminable\r\nnetwork of canals, on the surface of her broad lakes, through her every\r\nnavigable water-course, China will be infested by desperadoes from all\r\nlands, scattering misery in every valley and throughout the great plain.\r\nThen will follow the assassination of the peaceful traveller; massacres,\r\nforeign intervention, blockades and wars, and the lasting impediments to\r\ncommerce and civilization which these disorders engender.'\r\n\r\nWe proposed, as a check to the evil, a system of passports, limiting the\r\nprivilege of travel or residence beyond consular ports to responsible\r\npersons--to those who could give some guarantee that the privilege\r\nshould not be abused. Lord Elgin and Baron Gros, the allied\r\nplenipotentiaries, accepted the plan, and proposed it to the imperial\r\ncommissioners. It is said that the commissioners eagerly seized the\r\nproposition, as, after the capture of Tien-tsin by the allied forces,\r\nthey saw that submission was inevitable, yet durst not propose to the\r\nemperor unconditional acquiescence with the conquerors' demands, and\r\nrepresented the proposed passport system as a condition which they had\r\nimposed upon the barbarians. Thus they were empowered to negotiate the\r\ntreaty of Tien-tsin, which averted a battle between that port and\r\nPeking, which neither party felt itself quite ready to commence.\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen additional ports, some in the heart of the empire, are now\r\nopen to the foreigner, and extraterritoriality obtains throughout the\r\nvast region subject to the sway of the Son of Heaven--which, with other\r\ncorresponding causes, seems to be effecting the dismemberment of that\r\nhoary empire. The regimen to which the oldest of nations is subjected,\r\nis fast placing it in the condition of the 'sick man' of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the aggressive character of the foreigner, and of the\r\ndesire of rendering extraterritoriality a means of subjugation, examine\r\nthe claims set up within the past few months by mercantile interests.\r\nChina, having surrendered her right over criminals in her territory, has\r\nbeen further called on to submit to British consular investigation and\r\nadjudication with the assistance of two assessors (British merchants),\r\nin all cases of seizure and confiscation by her customs authorities,\r\nwhenever hardship or injustice is alleged--the custom-house officers to\r\nbe cited before the consul to receive his judgment in the case!\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a foreign as well as a native Shanghai. This settlement,\r\nor city of foreigners, adjacent to Shanghai proper, occupies a\r\nconsiderable space of territory, and is a place of great wealth. Its\r\nwarehouses are palatial, it has beautiful public and private edifices,\r\nand is governed by a municipality chosen by property holders from among\r\nthemselves. Its police, streets, piers, race-course, and all the\r\nappurtenances of a city, are admirably arranged. Nowhere, in the whole\r\nempire, is there so much security for life and property; hence natives,\r\nwho can afford to hire, from foreigners, houses which have been erected\r\non this conceded ground, are glad to do so; it has consequently become a\r\nplace of resort for well-to-do natives, who thus become exempt from the\r\nextortion of the mandarins. Latterly the Chinese local authorities have\r\nundertaken to impose a tax upon these extraterritorial natives, which\r\ntheir foreign clients resist, although one of the reasons assigned by\r\nthe mandarins, for the levying of taxes on their people residing in the\r\nforeign settlement, is an increase of expenditure consequent on the\r\nemployment of the Anglo-Chinese flotilla.\r\n\r\nHappily the British Government has refused to enforce the claims of the\r\nmerchants, as regards the exemption of their contraband goods from\r\nconfiscation; and Sir F. Bruce, the British ambassador, and Mr.\r\nBurlingame, the United States ambassador, have admitted 'that the\r\nso-called foreign settlement of Shanghai is Chinese territory, and that\r\nthe fact of Chinese occupying houses, which are the property of\r\nforeigners, does not in any way entitle such foreigners to interfere\r\nwith the levying of taxes by Chinese officials.'\r\n\r\nNo additional evidence need be adduced to show that, in exempting\r\nresident foreigners from criminal and civil jurisdiction, the Chinese\r\nhave opened the way for endless complications, for ever-recurring\r\naggressions. What are the duties of our Government and people with\r\nregard to the Chinese, in view of the position in which those people are\r\nplaced? We hold that it is not our duty to abandon the concession, which\r\nthus imperils the existence of the Chinese empire. It is not clear that\r\nif all nations, having intercourse with China, were to agree to renounce\r\nthe privilege they have extorted, it would be best to suffer their\r\npeople to trust wholly to Chinese tribunals for protection. Cases could\r\nnot fail to arise demanding foreign interference, if foreigners were\r\npermitted to go to China at all. And since the re-sealing of the empire\r\nis out of the question, less evil is perhaps likely to accrue, as things\r\nnow are, than by a change of policy. There is so little regard for human\r\nlife among the Chinese, so much venality at the tribunals of justice,\r\nthat foreigners would be endangered in person and property, unless\r\nprotected by some extraordinary safeguards, perhaps even to the extent\r\nsecured by treaty. Assuming, then, as we do, this jurisdiction in China,\r\nwe incur a grave responsibility. It is incumbent on us loyally to fulfil\r\nthe obligations that we have assumed; to see that we do not, by a lax\r\nadministration of justice, encourage unprincipled men in violating\r\nChinese law. No new laws are required, but a faithful enforcement of\r\nthose already enacted. To accomplish this, we need to amend and improve\r\nour consular system. Consulates in China cannot be rendered efficient\r\nuntil they are filled by competent men, who shall hold their office\r\nduring good behavior, and to whom inducement should be made to spend the\r\nbest part of their lives in the service. We cannot, like the English,\r\nhold out the prospect of a retiring pension to one who serves the State\r\ntwenty years in that uncongenial climate; but we can refrain from making\r\nthose frequent changes which prove so detrimental to every interest\r\nconcerned. The consuls should either be acquainted with the Chinese\r\nlanguage, a work for a lifetime, or have an American interpreter. The\r\npractice of having a Chinese linguist is most damaging--the native\r\nlinguist being invariably a lying knave, who becomes consul _de facto_,\r\nwhom no native can approach without a bribe, which it is supposed goes\r\nin part to the consul. As the points where consuls are needed are\r\nnumerous, some of them being where the honorable merchantman from the\r\nUnited States rarely visits, it may seem that the expense would prove an\r\ninsuperable objection to the establishment of a full and efficient\r\nconsular system. This objection ought to have no weight. If we are not\r\nprepared to allow the Chinese to exercise jurisdiction over our\r\nwandering citizens, we are bound, at any cost, ourselves to discharge\r\nthat duty. And in view of the fact that American officials possess power\r\nof life and death over their fellow citizens, our Government should\r\nappoint a judicial officer, also holding office during good behavior, by\r\nwhom all grave cases should be tried. If we cannot afford to be just,\r\nlet us economize by abrogating the office of commissioner or ambassador\r\nto Peking. That is an office which, from its emoluments, must always be\r\ngiven, whichever party may be in power, as a reward for party services\r\nto one who will return or be recalled before he begins to understand his\r\nbusiness. A _chargé des affaires_, with our admiral on the station,\r\ncould attend to all needful diplomacy, and thus a saving could be made\r\nand carried to the credit of the consulates.\r\n\r\nFurther, as by express stipulation we debar the Chinese from\r\nadjudicating in quarrels which may arise between our citizens and the\r\npeople of other countries in China, we ought to take measures for the\r\nestablishing of a mixed tribunal to exercise jurisdiction in such cases;\r\nand there ought to be an arrangement by which countries which are\r\nproperly represented in China might investigate and adjudicate in\r\noffences committed by foreigners not properly represented in that\r\ncountry: a most dangerous class of persons, who enjoy the privilege of\r\nextraterritoriality, without amenability to any tribunal, and who by\r\ntheir misconduct place every foreign interest in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nAs with the advance of Christian civilization, society is more and more\r\ndisposed to accord the rights of manhood to men of every race; so, let\r\nus hope, nations will yet be found willing to forego the advantages that\r\ngreater power confers, no longer employing that power in oppressing or\r\nsubverting weak states.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The second number of a series of articles on Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.--THE ARTIST AND HIS REALM.\r\n\r\nThe Divine Attributes the base of all true Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nAristotle teaches that: 'The object of the poet is not to conceive or\r\ntreat the True as it _really_ happened, but as it _should_ have\r\nhappened. The essential difference between the poet and historian is not\r\nthat the one speaks in verse, the other in prose, for the work of\r\nHerodotus in verse would still be a history; that is, it would still\r\nrelate what had _actually_ occurred, while it is the province of a poem\r\nto detail that which _should_ have taken place.' Thus the human soul\r\nexacts in the finite creations of the poet that justice which it ever\r\ndivines, but cannot always see, because the end passes beyond its\r\npresent vision, in the varying dramas of human destiny written in the\r\nBook of the Infinite God.\r\n\r\nCarefully keeping in mind that the end of such divine dramas is not\r\n_here_, we see that, in accordance with the above views of Aristotle,\r\nthe _true_ is not that which _really_ occurs, but that which our\r\nfeelings and intellect tell us ought to occur. The actually occurring,\r\nthe _Real_, has always been confounded with the abstractly _true_, but\r\nthey are very different things. Virtue, morality, such as revealed by\r\nChristianity, and confirmed by reason, are certainly _true_; but in\r\nrelation to that which is, to the _real_, the _actual_, what man has\r\never yet succeeded in realizing the pure, high model set forth in the\r\nGospel? In accordance with the theory that the _Actual_ is the _true_,\r\nthe nature of a saintly hero, a self-abnegating martyr, would not be a\r\n_true_ nature; while the fact is, it alone is true to the purposes of\r\nits creation.\r\n\r\nSophocles, Raphael, Michael Angelo, Fra Angelico, etc., etc., did not\r\nmean by truth in the arts, the pure and simple expression of that which\r\n_really_ is, but the expression of that which is rarely found _in_ the\r\nactual, but is suggested by it. Aquinas makes an acute distinction\r\nbetween the intellect _passive_, which merely receives impressions from\r\nwithout, and the intellect _active_, which reasons upon and draws\r\ninferences from them. The senses can only give or know the _individual_;\r\nthe active intellect alone conceives the _universal_. Our eyes perceive\r\na triangle; but as we have this perception in common with the brutes, it\r\ncannot raise us above their level; and to take our rank as\r\nintelligences, as men, we must rise from the mere perception of the\r\nindividual triangle to the general idea of triangularity. Thus it is the\r\npower of _generalizing_ which marks us as men; and the senses have in\r\nreality nothing to do with the internal operation; they but receive the\r\nimpressions, and convey them to the active intellect. Thus to the\r\nimpressions given by the senses of _finite_ things to the passive mind,\r\nthe active intellect adds the idea of _infinity_. The eager soul, always\r\nlonging for the infinite, the absolute, then seeks to invest all with\r\nthat perfection which it divines in the Maker of all; the possibility of\r\nwhich conception of perfection is added or attached by the Creator to\r\nthe Real, as a supersensuous gift to those made in His own image. Such\r\nconceptions live ever firm and fair in the charmed world of the artist,\r\nfor his world is the Realm of pure Ideas.\r\n\r\nMuch may be quoted in proof of this view. Cicero says:\r\n\r\n     'When Phidias formed his Jupiter, he had no living model before his\r\n     eyes, but having conceived an idea of perfect beauty in his soul,\r\n     he labored only to imitate it, to produce it in the marble without\r\n     change.'\r\n\r\nRaphael says:\r\n\r\n     'Having found no model sufficiently beautiful for my Galatea, I\r\n     worked from a certain Idea which I found in my own mind.'\r\n\r\nFra Angelico furnishes a striking example of working from images found\r\nin the soul. He was an artist of very devout character, early devoting\r\nhimself and his art to God, saying: Those who work for Christ, must\r\ndwell in Christ. Always, before commencing a picture which was to be\r\nconsecrated to the honor of God, he prepared himself with fervent prayer\r\nand meditation, and then began in humble trust that '_it would be put\r\ninto his mind what he ought to delineate_;' he would never deviate from\r\nthe first idea, for, as he said, '_that_ was the will of God.' This he\r\nsaid not in presumption, but in faith and simplicity of heart. So he\r\npassed his life in imaging his _own ideas_, which were sent to his meek\r\nsoul by no fabled muse, but by that Spirit 'that doth prefer before all\r\ntemples the upright heart and pure;' and never before or since was\r\nearthly material worked up into soul, nor earthly forms refined into\r\nspirit, as under the hands of this devout painter. He became sublime\r\nthrough trusting goodness and humility. It was as if Paradise had opened\r\nupon him--a Paradise of rest and joy, of purity and love, where no\r\ntrouble, no guile, no change could enter; and if his celestial\r\ncreations lack force, we feel that before these ethereal beings, power\r\nitself would be powerless; his angels are resistless in their soft\r\nserenity; his virgins are pure from all earthly stain; his redeemed\r\nspirits in meek rapture glide into Paradise; his martyrs and confessors\r\nare absorbed in devout ecstasy. Well has he been named IL BEATO E\r\nANGELICO, whose life was participate with the angels even in this world.\r\nIs it not clear that Fra Angelico had found the Realm of the Artist; the\r\nfair and happy clime of the Ideal?\r\n\r\nOur readers must not confound the ideal with the imaginary: the ideal is\r\nrather that which the real requires to invest it with that beauty which\r\nit would have possessed had the spirits of Death and sin never thrown\r\ntheir dark shadows over God's perfect work. Let not the poet fear the\r\nreproach that his characters are too _ideal_; if harmoniously\r\nconstructed, but _true_ in the higher sense, such reproach is praise.\r\n\r\nMan rises spontaneously from the perception of the finite beauty of\r\ncreatures to the conception of the sovereign beauty of the Creator,\r\nwhich idea has indeed its first condition in the perception of the\r\nsenses; but it passes on until it extends its sphere through all our\r\nfaculties, all our moral life, until the distant vision of Absolute\r\nBeauty attracts us from the limited sphere of the senses to the realm of\r\nthe ideal. Thus the artist, that he may appease the insatiate thirst for\r\nAbsolute Beauty, which ever pursues him, strives to bring down upon\r\nearth the divine but veiled images, which he beholds in that fair clime.\r\n\r\nEvery work of art implies three acts of the intellect: an act, by which\r\nthe artist conceives the pure idea, the soul of his creation; an act, by\r\nwhich he conceives or invents the form in which he is to incarnate this\r\nidea, the body of his creation; and, lastly, a conception of the\r\nrelations between the pure idea and its material form, the rendering of\r\nthe body a fit vehicle and indwelling-place for the soul. Three\r\nacts--but an artist of _genius_ produces the three _simultaneously_;\r\nconsequently a marvellous life and unity mark all his works: an artist\r\nof mere talent must be contented simply with the production of new\r\ncombinations of form, since Genius alone can create artistic soul; while\r\nthe assiduous student, without any peculiar natural gift, is capable of\r\nthe third act, as it is only an intellectual exercise in which the\r\nscientific principles of art are skilfully applied to given forms.\r\n\r\nArtists are frequently considered as deficient in the faculty of Reason,\r\nwhereas no one was ever a great artist without possessing it in a high\r\ndegree, and mankind are rapidly becoming aware of this fact. It is true\r\nthey often jump the middle terms of their syllogisms, and assume\r\npremises to which the world has not yet arrived; but time stamps their\r\nrapid deductions as invincible, for genius dwells in the REALM OF THE\r\nIDEAL: the realm, not of contingent and phenomenal actualities, but of\r\n_eternal truths_. 'For the ideal is destined to transform man and the\r\nworld entire into its own image; and in this gradual and successive\r\ntransformation consists the whole progressive history of humanity.'\r\n\r\nGenius discerns the true and beautiful in itself, in the world of ideas,\r\nin God.\r\n\r\nTalent lies on a lower level. It is the power of manifesting to men,\r\nwhether by words, sounds, or plastic signs, the ideas already suggested\r\nby genius, or found by the reasoning faculties.\r\n\r\nGenius is intuitive and creative--talent, reflective and acute.\r\n\r\nShakespeare was a poet of unequalled genius--Milton, of unrivalled\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\nChopin is a composer of profound genius--Mendelssohn, of highly\r\ncultivated talent.\r\n\r\nMadame de Stäel was a woman of genius--Miss Edgeworth, one of talent.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett is a poet of genius--Tennyson, of talent.\r\n\r\nGenius descends from the Idea to the Form--from the invisible to the\r\nvisible: talent mounts from the visible to the invisible.\r\n\r\nGenius holds its objects with and by the heart; talent seizes and\r\nmasters them through the understanding. Genius creates body, soul, and\r\nfitness; talent combines new forms for the immortal souls already\r\ncreated by genius.\r\n\r\nTaste, in its highest grade, ranks above talent, and stands next to\r\ngenius; nay, it is sometimes known as _receptive_ genius. It is the\r\nfaculty of recognizing the Beautiful in the world of thought, art, and\r\nnature; in words, tones, forms, and colors. Taste is a higher faculty\r\nthan is generally supposed. Genius and Taste are the Eros and Anteros of\r\nart. Without his brother, the first would remain ever a child. Taste is\r\nthat innate and God-given faculty which at once perceives and hails as\r\ntrue, ideas, which it, however, has not the power to discover for\r\nitself. It should be educated and carefully fostered; but no amount of\r\ncultivation will give it where not already in existence, for it is as\r\ntruly innate as genius itself.\r\n\r\nIn its lowest form, it is the comprehension of the scientific principles\r\nof art, and the judging of artistic works in accordance with scientific\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as tact, is a curious social development of the same\r\nfaculty. Taste is the child of the mind and soul; tact, of the soul and\r\nheart. Both are incommunicable.\r\n\r\nThe word taste is frequently misapplied. Thus a man, with what is\r\nblunderingly called a classical taste, is incapable of aught but the\r\nclassic; that is to say, he recognizes in a new work that which makes\r\nthe charm of an old one, and pronounces it worthy of admiration. Put the\r\nright foot of an Apollo forward, instead of the left, and call it Philip\r\nof Pokanoket, and he will fall into ecstasies over a work at once so\r\ntruly national and classic. He would have stood dumb and with an\r\nuntouched heart, before the Apollo, fresh from the chisel of the\r\nsculptor. Such men have graduated at Vanity Fair, and are the\r\nold-clothesmen of art.\r\n\r\nThus the men of talent are almost invariably recognized and crowned in\r\ntheir own days; because they always deal with ideas in a measure already\r\nfamiliar to the multitude. But, alas for the sensitive child of genius!\r\nThe bold explorer of untrodden paths must cut away the underbrush that\r\nothers may follow him; he must himself create the taste in the masses,\r\nby which he is afterward to be judged. His bold, daring, and original\r\nconceptions serve only to dazzle, confuse, and blind the multitude; and\r\nas it requires time to understand them, to read their living characters\r\nof glowing light, the laurel wreaths of appreciation and sympathy, which\r\nshould have graced his brow and cheered his heart, too often trail their\r\ndeathless green in vain luxuriance round the chill marble covering the\r\nearly grave of a broken heart. Ah, friends! Genius demands sympathy in\r\nits impassioned creations; loving and laboring for humanity, it exacts\r\ncomprehension, at least, in return. Yet how very difficult it is for an\r\nartist to win such comprehension! And, by a strange fatality, the more\r\noriginal his compositions, the greater the difficulty. He must amuse the\r\nmen of the senses; satisfy the precision of the men of the schools; and\r\nsucceed in rendering intelligible to the uncultured masses the subtile\r\nlinks of ethereal connection which chain the finite, the relative of his\r\ncompositions, to the Infinite, the Absolute.\r\n\r\nFor it is a pregnant fact, with regard to the masses, that only so far\r\nas they can be made to _feel_ the connection of things with the\r\nAbsolute, can they be induced to appreciate them. For instance, tell\r\nthem that the stars attract in the direct ratio of their masses, in\r\ninverse ratio to the squares of the distance, and they may almost fail\r\nto understand you; but tell them, in the words of the Divine Book, so\r\nmarvellously adapted to their comprehension, that 'the stars declare\r\nthe glory of God,' and you are at once understood. Tell them they ought\r\nto love one another, because 'they are members of the same spiritual\r\nbody'--and, although, in this concise statement, you have declared to\r\nthem the internal constitution of the moral world, revealed the inner\r\nmeaning of the laws of order, of social harmony, of their own destiny,\r\nand of the progress of the race--you may utterly fail in awakening their\r\ninterest. But show them a Being who lived for this truth, whose life was\r\none of sacrifice and abnegation, who died for its manifestation--they\r\nare immediately touched, interested, because you have left the\r\nunsympathetic region of abstract formulas; you have given law a visible,\r\npalpitating, feeling, suffering, and rejoicing Body--you awaken their\r\nlove, their gratitude--they adore their godlike Brother, and now _feel_\r\nthemselves members of the one spiritual body.\r\n\r\nIt is this very possibility, on a lower plane, of thus clothing his\r\nthoughts with a visible body, which gives the artist an advantage over\r\nthe man of science, who presents the formula of the _law_ with the aid\r\nof the contingent finite idea, but without connecting it with its First\r\nCause. Confining itself to the limits of the thing examined, science\r\ntries to explain the finite rationale of its being; while art gives its\r\nformula by the aid of a material sign, a form or body, which contains or\r\nsuggests both limits of its double existence, viz.: the finite and the\r\ninfinite. For the true artist always connects the relative with the\r\nAbsolute, the second cause with the First; in the finite he seeks the\r\nInfinite--therefore he finds mystic and hidden truths in essential\r\nharmony with the soul of man. He is always returning to unity. The man\r\nof science, on the contrary, always beginning with the variable and\r\ncontingent facts of this world, is often lost in the wildering whirl of\r\nthe ever-moving and unceasing variety around him, finding it hard to\r\nlink his widely severed facts with the Supreme Unity, which gives to all\r\nits reason for being, its true worth. Variety and Unity--the created and\r\nthe Creator!\r\n\r\nIt is almost universally believed that there is more truth in science\r\nthan in poetry--a vulgar error refuted both by reason and common sense.\r\nPoetry, being the expression of the necessary with the Absolute, must,\r\nin consequence, be nearer truth than science, which has, for the most\r\npart, its starting point in contingent, variable, and fugitive facts,\r\nand either succeeds in seizing in an uncertain manner or fails to seize\r\nat all the one Idea imbosomed in such a multitudinous array of facts.\r\nThe whole creation is but the visible expression of the laws of our\r\nunseen God: the man of science mounts from the visible fact to the\r\nunseen Idea, while the poet descends from the idea to the fact, thus\r\nhumbly imitating the work of creation.\r\n\r\nIt was man who introduced disorder into the finite: regenerated through\r\nthe incarnation of the Divine, he must labor with all his powers to\r\nrestore it to its pristine order. He must remodel the physical world by\r\nhis industry, and task his intellect in the paths of science, that the\r\ntruths of nature may be developed, that the well-being of his body, his\r\nmaterial nature may be properly cared for: by his courage and endurance\r\nhe must alleviate all wrongs, and set free the oppressed; he must\r\nelevate his soul and ennoble his heart by a grateful attention to his\r\nreligious duties; he must increase and multiply his happy and helpful\r\nrelations with his brother men by a faithful and devout culture of the\r\nfine arts.\r\n\r\nThe Beautiful does not address itself principally _to_ the senses; but,\r\nby its exhibition of eternal laws, _through_ them to the soul, for the\r\n_manifestation of the Divine attributes is the mystic Heart of all true\r\nBeauty_.'\r\n\r\nTo give an example of the different appeals made by science and by art,\r\nlet us open alternately the pages of the poet and savant, let us take\r\nsome familiar thing, for instance, a common flower, and see what they\r\nwill tell us of its character, relations, and worth. The botanist notes\r\nthe distinctions of the flower, that his herbarium may be increased--the\r\npoet, that he may make them vehicles of expression, of emotion. The\r\nsavant counts the stamens, numbers the pistils, delineates the leaves,\r\nmarks the manner of growth, classifies, affixes a name, and is\r\nsatisfied;--the poet studies the whole character of the plant,\r\nconsidering each of its attributes as a vehicle of expression, an\r\nethical lesson; he notes its color, he seizes on its lines of grace or\r\nenergy, rigidity or repose, remarks the feebleness or vigor, the\r\nserenity or tremulousness of its hues, observes its local habits, its\r\nlove or fear of peculiar places, associating it with the features of the\r\nsituations it inhabits, and the ministering agencies necessary to its\r\nsupport. It becomes to him a _living_ creature, with histories written\r\non its leaves, and passion breathing in its tremulous stems. He\r\nassociates and identifies it with the history and emotions of humanity.\r\nFeeling that even these fragile flowers are symbolic of a moral world,\r\nhe crowns the bride with white roses, orange buds, or snowy myrtle\r\nwreaths, to typify that innocence and chastity are essential to a love\r\nthat is to last as long as life endures. He wreathes the redeemed with\r\nundying amaranth, unfading palms, to symbolize that their meek triumph\r\nis for eternity; while he places in the hands of the angels the\r\nsculptured chalice of the snowy lily, with its breath of incense and\r\nstamens of molten gold, as an imperfect type of the perfect purity,\r\nsweet peace, and glorious golden splendor of the Heavenly City.\r\n\r\nThe pages of the poets are full of beautiful lessons and tender\r\nillustrations drawn from the fragile flowers. We cite Lowell's lines to\r\none of our most common flowers:\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DANDELION.\r\n\r\n  Dear common flower that grow'st beside the way,\r\n    Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold,\r\n          First pledge of blithesome May,\r\n    Which children pluck, and, full of pride, uphold,\r\n  High-hearted buccaneers, o'erjoyed that they\r\n  An Eldorado in the grass have found,\r\n  Which not the rich earth's ample round\r\n  May match in wealth--thou art more dear to me\r\n  Than all the prouder summer blooms may be.\r\n\r\n  Gold such as thine ne'er drew the Spanish prow\r\n    Through the primeval hush of Indian seas,\r\n          Nor wrinkled the lean brow\r\n    Of age, to rob the lover's heart of ease;\r\n  'Tis the spring's largess, which she scatters now\r\n  To rich and poor alike with lavish hand,\r\n  Though most hearts never understand\r\n  To take it at God's value, but pass by\r\n  The offered wealth with unrewarded eye.\r\n\r\n  Thou art my tropics and mine Italy;\r\n    To look at thee unlocks a warmer clime;\r\n          The eyes thou givest me\r\n    Are in the heart, and heed not space or time:\r\n  Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee\r\n  Feels a more summer-like warm ravishment\r\n  In the white Lily's breezy tent,\r\n  His fragrant Sybaris, than I, when first\r\n  From the dark green thy yellow circles burst.\r\n\r\n  Then think I of deep shadows on the grass,--\r\n    Of meadows where in sun the cattle graze,\r\n          Where, as the breezes pass,\r\n    The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways,--\r\n  Of leaves that slumber in a cloudy mass,\r\n  Or whiten in the wind,--of waters blue\r\n  That from the distance sparkle through\r\n  Some woodland gap,--and of a sky above\r\n  Where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move.\r\n\r\n  My childhood's earliest thoughts are linked with thee;\r\n    The sight of thee calls back the Robin's song\r\n          Who, from the dark old tree\r\n    Beside the door, sang clearly all day long,\r\n  And I, secure in childish piety,\r\n  Listened as if I heard an angel sing\r\n  With news from heaven, which he could bring\r\n  Fresh every day to my untainted ears,\r\n  When birds and flowers and I were happy peers.\r\n\r\n  How like a prodigal doth nature seem\r\n    When thou, with all thy gold, so common art!\r\n          Thou teachest me to deem\r\n    More sacredly of every human heart,\r\n  Since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam\r\n  Of heaven, and could some wondrous secret show,\r\n  Did we but pay the love we owe,\r\n  And with a child's undoubting wisdom look\r\n  On all these living pages of God's book.\r\n\r\nWordsworth's 'Daisy' is very beautiful, and full of moral lessons:\r\n\r\n  In youth, from rock to rock I went,\r\n  From hill to hill, in discontent\r\n  Of pleasure high and turbulent,\r\n              Most pleased when most uneasy;\r\n  But now my own delights I make,--\r\n  My thirst at every rill can slake,\r\n  And gladly nature's love partake\r\n              Of thee, sweet Daisy!\r\n\r\n  When winter decks his few gray hairs,\r\n  Thee in the scanty wreath he wears;\r\n  Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,\r\n              That she may sun thee;\r\n  Whole summer fields are thine by right;\r\n  And Autumn, melancholy wight!\r\n  Doth in thy crimson head delight\r\n              When rains are on thee.\r\n\r\n  In shoals and bands, a morrice train,\r\n  Thou greet'st the traveller in the lane;\r\n  If welcome once, thou count'st it gain;\r\n              Thou art not daunted,\r\n  Nor car'st if thou be set at nought:\r\n  And oft alone in nooks remote\r\n  We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,\r\n              When such are wanted.\r\n\r\n  Be violets in their secret mews\r\n  The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose;\r\n  Proud be the Rose, with rains and dews\r\n              Her head impearling;\r\n  Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,\r\n  Yet hast not gone without thy fame;\r\n  Thou art indeed by many a claim\r\n              The Poet's darling.\r\n\r\n  If to a rock from rains he fly,\r\n  Or, some bright day of April sky,\r\n  Imprisoned by hot sunshine, lie\r\n              Near the green holly,\r\n  And wearily at length should fare;\r\n  He needs but look about, and there\r\n  Thou art: a friend at hand, to scare\r\n              His melancholy.\r\n\r\n  A hundred times, by rock or bower,\r\n  Ere thus I have lain couched an hour,\r\n  Have I derived from thy sweet power\r\n              Some apprehension;\r\n  Some steady love, some brief delight;\r\n  Some memory that had taken flight;\r\n  Some chime of fancy wrong or right,\r\n              Or stray invention.\r\n\r\n  If stately passions in me burn,\r\n  And one chance look to thee should turn,\r\n  I drink out of an humbler urn\r\n              A lowlier pleasure;\r\n  The homely sympathy that heeds\r\n  The common life our nature breeds;\r\n  A wisdom fitted to the needs\r\n              Of hearts at leisure.\r\n\r\n  Sweet flower! for by that name at last,\r\n  When all my reveries are past,\r\n  I call thee, and to that cleave fast,\r\n              Sweet, silent creature!\r\n  That breath'st with me in sun and air,\r\n  Do thou, as thou wert wont, repair\r\n  My heart with gladness and a share\r\n              Of thy meek nature!\r\n\r\nWith still deeper poetic feeling has that untutored bard of nature, poor\r\nBurns, written of this little flower:\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A MOUNTAIN DAISY,\r\n\r\n_On turning one down with the plough, in April, 1786._\r\n\r\n  Wee, modest, crimson-tipped flow'r,\r\n  Thou's met me in an evil hour;\r\n  For I maun crush amang the stoure\r\n                    Thy slender stem;\r\n  To spare thee now is past my power,\r\n                    Thou bonnie gem!\r\n\r\n  Alas! it's no thy neebor sweet,\r\n  The bonnie Lark, companion meet,\r\n  Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet,\r\n                    Wi' speckl'd breast,\r\n  When upward springing, blithe, to greet\r\n                    The purpling east.\r\n\r\n  Cauld blew the bitter biting north\r\n  Upon thy early, humble birth;\r\n  Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth\r\n                    Amid the storm\r\n  Scarce reared above the parent earth\r\n                    Thy tender form.\r\n\r\n  The flaunting flowers our gardens yield,\r\n  High sheltering woods and wa's maun shield\r\n  But thou, beneath the random bield\r\n                    O' clod or stane,\r\n  Adorns the histie stibble field,\r\n                    Unseen, alane!\r\n\r\n  There, in thy scanty mantle clad,\r\n  Thy snawie bosom sun-ward spread,\r\n  Thou lifts thy unassuming head,\r\n                    In humble guise;\r\n  But now the share uptears thy bed,\r\n                    And low thou lies!\r\n\r\n  Such is the fate of artless Maid,\r\n  Sweet floweret of the rural shade!\r\n  By love's simplicity betrayed,\r\n                    And guileless trust,\r\n  Till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid\r\n                    Low i' the dust.\r\n\r\n  Such is the fate of simple Bard,\r\n  On life's rough ocean; luckless starr'd,\r\n  Unskilful he to note the card\r\n                    Of prudent lore,\r\n  Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,\r\n                    And whelm him o'er!\r\n\r\n  Such fate to suffering worth is given,\r\n  Who long with wants and woes has striven,\r\n  By human pride or cunning driven\r\n                    To mis'ry's brink,\r\n  Till, wrench'd of every stay but Heaven,\r\n                    He, ruin'd, sink!\r\n\r\n  Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate,\r\n  That fate is thine--no distant date:\r\n  Stern Ruin's ploughshare drives, elate,\r\n                    Full on thy bloom,\r\n  Till crushed beneath the furrow's weight\r\n                    Shall be thy doom!\r\n\r\nWith our hearts full of love and tender sympathy with the author of this\r\nexquisite poem, let us now look among the botanists for a description of\r\nthe Daisy. We will find: 'Perenuius (Daisy, E.W. & P. 21), leaves\r\nobovate, crenate; scape naked, 1 flowered; or, Leucanthemum (Ox-eyed\r\nDaisy), leaves clasping, lanceolate, serrate, cut-toothed at the base;\r\nstem erect, branching.' (See Eaton's Botany.)\r\n\r\nAll honor to the savant! Untiring in his investigations, ardent in his\r\nresearches, the men of the senses are scarcely worthy to untie the\r\nlatchet of his shoe, but he is slow in acknowledging the _science of\r\nart_, and apt to look down upon the artist from his throne of power!\r\nBecause the artist deals with a different order of truths, unseen and\r\nbelonging principally to the world of feeling, the savant rarely does\r\njustice to the intense study requisite for the mastery of the mere form\r\nof art; the long, unrequited, and patient toil requisite for its\r\npractice, or the soaring and loving genius required to fill the form\r\nwhen mastered with glowing life. All honor to the savant! but let him\r\nnot fail to acknowledge the artist-brother at his side, who labors on\r\nfor humanity with no hope of learned professorships to crown his career,\r\nnor venerable diplomas to assure him of social honor and position. Let\r\nhim not be regarded as an idler by the wayside, nor let 'La Bohème' be\r\nany longer considered as his especial type and insignia! The useful and\r\nthe beautiful should stand banded in the closest fellowship, since Truth\r\nmust be the soul of both! Honor then the pure artist, while he still\r\nlives, nor keep the laurel only for his tomb!\r\n\r\nIn order to examine scientifically, the mind is generally forced to\r\nconsider its object as deprived of life; indeed, the functions of living\r\ncreatures cannot be fully analyzed without being first deprived of life.\r\nScience gives us its subject with the most rigorous exactitude, with the\r\nmost scrupulous fidelity; but, alas! often without that magical kindler\r\nof love and sympathy, life. Art gives us its subject with vivid\r\ncoloring, motion, palpitating life--often, indeed, by associative moral\r\nsymbolism adding a still higher life to simple being, filling it, as in\r\nBurns's lines to the Daisy, with a purer flame.\r\n\r\nScience daguerreotypes, art paints its objects. Science is necessarily\r\nabstract, discrete; art necessarily concrete. So true is this, that when\r\nart begins to decline, it manifests a tendency to pass from the concrete\r\nto the discrete, abstract; it becomes self-conscious, reflective,\r\nscientific. Body, form, is mistaken for soul, spirit. A discrete idea\r\nfails to move us, because it gives us only _successively_ the relations\r\nsubsisting between it and the First Cause, as its facts must be\r\nisolated, its elements decomposed, and presented to us in an inverse\r\norder to that in which they reveal themselves to the mind in the\r\nspontaneous and natural use of its powers. Science never appeals to our\r\nemotional faculties spontaneously; when it does speak to the heart, it\r\nis because the mind, linking together the successive ideas given by\r\nscience, at last seizes upon the UNITY of the whole, supplying by its\r\nown conceptions the voids of science. When the savant possesses the\r\ncreative power in a high degree, as did Kepler, he becomes prophet and\r\nartist. The concrete ideas of art appeal immediately to our feelings;\r\nemotions excited by them are spontaneous, because they aim at presenting\r\ntheir objects in all the splendor of their _living_ light. Only life\r\nproduces life; all our emotions and sympathies pertain to the suffering,\r\nthe acting, the living--and thus an artistic conception appeals to our\r\nentire being. What psychological analysis of youthful and feminine\r\nloveliness could move us as a Juliet?\r\n\r\nAnalysis and reflection suppose the suspension of spontaneity, that is,\r\nof the free activity of the soul. Spontaneity and reflection are the two\r\nmodes in which the spirit manifests its activity. Spontaneity is the\r\nliving power which it possesses of acting without premeditation, without\r\ncontingent ideas, of being influenced or determined by some power from\r\nwithout, the action thus produced blending the two primary elements of\r\nfeeling and thought. This is the distinctive mode of woman's being.\r\nReflection is that operation of the mind by which it turns its gaze in\r\nupon itself, and considers its own operations; it compares, analyzes,\r\nand constructs logical processes of thought. This is as natural to man,\r\nas spontaneity to woman. Now both of these modes are essentially\r\nnecessary to the well-being of the individual, the one is the complement\r\nof the other; the cultivation of the one should never be sacrificed to\r\nthat of the other. Teach woman to reason; develop spontaneity in man.\r\nBut as the whole course of our education is solely addressed to the\r\nreflective faculties, intended chiefly for their culture, how is\r\nspontaneity to be developed? Certainly not through abstract science; for\r\nit, with its formulas, occupied only with contingent and relative ideas,\r\naddressing itself solely to the faculties concerned with the elaboration\r\nof the relative, that is, to the reflective faculties--how can it avail\r\nfor the cultivation of spontaneity? It can be cultivated only through\r\nthe due direction of the emotional nature; but how is that to be\r\napproached? In the first place through the joys and sorrows, the events\r\nof daily life; a training of such importance that the Great Creator, for\r\nthe most part, retains it in His own hands: humanly speaking, only\r\nthrough the arts, which contain, at the same time, the scientific form\r\nof the finite, and the blissful intuition of the Infinite. As wisdom and\r\nlove mark the works of the Creator, so thought and feeling meet in the\r\ncreations of the artist, in the arts--but thought alone is concerned\r\nwith the formulas of science. Now, if spontaneity be more conducive to\r\nman's happiness than reflection, then poetry, literature, and the arts\r\nare of more importance to him than abstract science. If, in appealing to\r\nspontaneous emotions, they give the legitimate influence to the heart\r\nwhich it should possess, because under their influence thought and\r\nfeeling move in the proper _unity_ of their divinely linked being, then\r\nmust pure, creative, loving, and devout art at last take its rank, when\r\nspontaneity shall be regarded as the generatrix of reflection, above the\r\ncold and haughty pile reared by the reflective faculties alone, abstract\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe aspirations of man constantly sigh for the limitless; his soul\r\ncontains depths which his reason cannot fathom. How rapidly his surging\r\nideas come and go! What flashes of supernatural light--what fearful\r\nobscurity! Heaven and Hell war in his soul! Strange visions traverse his\r\nintellect, throwing their lurid light into the vague depths of his\r\nheart. His power to love and feel seems boundless--his power to know\r\nalmost at zero. What can he predicate even of himself, with his\r\nboundless desires for he knows not what--his fleeting emotions and\r\ninsatiable wishes! Ah! if the language of poetry, of music, of the\r\narts, came not to gift these passing images with external life, to fix\r\nthem in the wildered consciousness, they would surge away almost\r\nunmarked, like lovely dreams, scarcely leaving their dim traces in the\r\nmemory. For, with the generality of common minds, the actual is death to\r\nthe ideal! But art speaks; spontaneity is justified; our inner being, so\r\nvague before, stands revealed before us; the beautiful must be the true,\r\nthe chaos of the moral world is dispelled; we were created to _enjoy_\r\nthe attributes of God, which, finitely manifested, are Truth and Beauty;\r\nand His light moves over the perturbed chaos of our dim being! What can\r\nabstract science, with its cold and finite language, do for a soul\r\nathirst for an infinite happiness? Nothing, unless its first postulate\r\nbe God! Young people, generally, and women, in whom the love of Beauty\r\nis strongly developed, have almost a repulsion to the study of science.\r\nWherefore? Because it often seems to exile God from His own creation.\r\nLet Him desert Paradise, and it becomes at once a desert. The Infinite\r\nis the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley! Besides, the\r\nreflective reasoning faculties awaken late with those in whom the\r\nintuitive faculties and sensibilities attain an early development. Let\r\nwoman not despair. What use will there be for the reflective reason,\r\nwhen 'we shall know even as we are known,' and the vision in God shall\r\nmake the spontaneous bliss of immortality?\r\n\r\nThe habit of only seeing, only studying, only analyzing the finite, is\r\nvery apt to inspire the savant with a peculiar distrust of all\r\nspontaneous emotion. Ceasing to open his heart to that light from the\r\nAbsolute, which ought to quicken it into bloom, it learns to dwell only\r\nin the sterile world of abstract formulas. If he could find algebraic\r\nsigns for its expression, he would willingly believe in the immortality\r\nof the soul: the characters which he can never learn to comprehend, are\r\nprecisely those in which dwell the intuitions of the infinite. He piques\r\nhimself upon the precision of his language, not perceiving it has gained\r\nthis boasted prim exactitude at the expense of breadth and depth. All\r\nhonor to the savant! but let him keep the lamp of spontaneity ever\r\nburning in his soul. By its light the savage and the woman divine God;\r\nwithout it, he may weigh creation--and 'find Him not!'\r\n\r\nNothing can be more superficial than the intellects of men given over to\r\nformulas. They always imagine they can explore the depths of truth, if\r\nthey can succeed in detecting an inch of its surface. When they arrive\r\nat the term of their own ideas, they believe they have exhausted the\r\nabsolute. They frequently want feeling, because they have, in some way,\r\ndestroyed their own spontaneity--that inexhaustible source of living and\r\noriginal thought, individualized and yet universal, of ever-thronging\r\nand vivid emotions.\r\n\r\nThe most spontaneous writer of the present day is a woman; fresh,\r\nrugged, rich, and natural, as the wayside gold of the Dandelion above\r\ndescribed by Lowell--hence her sudden and great popularity with the\r\npeople. She feels strongly, and thinks justly, and fears not to say what\r\nthe great God gives her. May she continue to pour her 'wayside gold'\r\nthrough the literary waves of the 'Atlantic'--and still keep the molten\r\ntreasure bright and burnished for the service of our altar. Let her not\r\nfly too near the candles of the clergy, and thus sear her Psyche wings.\r\nNeed I name Gail Hamilton? Pardon the digression, courteous reader, and\r\nlet a woman greet a gifted sister as she passes on.\r\n\r\nLet me not be misunderstood in my estimate of the spontaneous and\r\nreflective faculties: they must _combine_ in any man _truly great_. If I\r\nhave dwelt on spontaneity, it is because it has not been sufficiently\r\nprized or cultivated. The savant must have the faculties of the artist,\r\nas had Kepler; the artist those of the savant, as had Michael Angelo and\r\nLeonardo da Vinci. Study, reflective power, logical ability, erudition,\r\nare _absolutely_ necessary; but one of their principal functions is to\r\nbe able to analyze aright the products of spontaneity; to give the soul\r\nthe consciousness and comprehension of the innumerable phenomena which\r\narise in it, in its varied relations with the world of ideas. The man\r\nwho is at the same time _spontaneous_ and _reflective_, is alone\r\n_complete_, be he artist or savant; he lives, yet is able to analyze\r\nlife. Of such mental character are indeed all men of true genius,\r\nwhether mechanicians, architects, philosophers, savants, or artists.\r\n\r\nThe truths surging dimly through the universal consciousness, find\r\ninterpreters in the men of genius; through them the moral and religious\r\nideas of an epoch take form, and crystallize themselves in poetry and\r\nthe arts--as the laws of the divine geometry are realized in the\r\ncrystallizations of minerals. Poetry and the arts may be regarded as the\r\n_sum_ of the absolute truths to the conception of which the masses have\r\nrisen at any given period in the life of a people.\r\n\r\nLamartine says:\r\n\r\n     'If humanity were forced to lose entirely one of the two orders of\r\n     truth--either all the mathematical or all the moral truths--it\r\n     should not hesitate to sacrifice the mathematical, for though it is\r\n     true if these were lost the world would suffer immense detriment,\r\n     yet if we should lose a single one of the moral truths, where would\r\n     man himself be? Humanity would be decomposed and perish!'\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that art has an incontestable superiority over\r\nscience in appealing to _all_, in addressing the masses in the language\r\nthey most readily understand, the language of feeling, imagination, and\r\nenthusiasm. It is not intended only for men of culture, of leisure; all\r\nclasses are to be benefited by its exalting influence. Men whose lives\r\nare almost entirely absorbed by occupations necessary for the comfort of\r\ntheir families, can scarcely be contented with the monotonous and\r\nwearisome spectacle of actual every-day life. Their cares are very\r\nexhausting, agitating the heart and mind with harassing emotions; while\r\nthe immortal soul thirsts for eternal happiness. Can it be doubted that\r\nsuch dim, vague, unsatisfied longings are the source of much immorality?\r\nMechanical operations, business speculations, commercial transactions,\r\nimportant as they may appear to the utilitarian, are far from responding\r\nto the requirements of the intellect, the imperious exactions of the\r\nheart. Such men pine unconsciously for a draught of higher life, they\r\ngrow weary of existence. Literature and the arts may come to their aid,\r\ncreating for them an ideal world in the midst of the actual, in the\r\nbosom of which they may find other emotions, interests, and images. They\r\nmay open, even in the desert of the most conventional life, an unfailing\r\nspring of ideas and emotions, at which the poor world-wearied spirits\r\nmay slake their mental and moral thirst. The wonders of commercial\r\nindustry cannot quite chain the minds of men to the material world--it\r\nis certain that the thirst for the ideal ever increases in exact\r\nproportion with the development of the race. The true and high task of\r\nthe artist, the poet, is to divine these wants of humanity, to cultivate\r\nthese inchoate aspirations for the infinite, to hold its nectar to the\r\ntoil-worn, weary lips, to soothe and elevate the restless spirits, to\r\ncultivate, in accordance with the essence of Christianity, this excess\r\nof moral and intellectual being, which the occupations of this weary\r\nearth-life cannot exhaust.\r\n\r\nBesides, is it not true that the very character natural to the artist is\r\npeculiarly fitted to exert a beneficial influence on a material and\r\ncommercial society? The pursuits of commerce are very apt to engender a\r\nspirit of utter indifference to everything except material well-being--a\r\nspirit of competition and mutual distrust most injurious to the\r\nhappiness of society; but the artist is proverbially careless of mere\r\npecuniary gain, and is always full of trust in his fellow men. In the\r\nvarious phases of excitement which are constantly agitating society, he\r\nlooks only for the manifestation of noble passions and great thoughts.\r\nIn the base smiles wreathing so many false lips, he sees but the natural\r\nexpression of kindness; when lips vow fidelity, he dreams of an\r\naffection based upon esteem, not upon a passing instinct, a sordid or\r\nsensual interest--he believes in a union of hearts. Breathing everywhere\r\naround him the high enthusiasm of his own truthful and loving soul, he\r\nknows nothing of those perfidious jealousies and bitter enmities which\r\ncreep and twist in the shade, always hiding under some fair mask; of\r\nthose coarse intellects opposed to every noble impulse, or of that proud\r\nand obstinate egotism which repels every generous emotion of the heart,\r\nbecause it knows that _feeling_ creates an _equality_ which is wounding\r\nto its haughty estimation of its own supposed merit.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the soul was not created for the accumulation of\r\nmoney, but to enjoy God. It is a free and living power, whose true\r\ncondition upon earth is the voluntary fulfilment of duty. It was made\r\nfor this by the God of love. Duty, love to God and man, is the Ideal of\r\nhuman life; and as art and poetry should be the expression of the\r\nhighest and most universal ideas of the human race, duty should not only\r\nbe the Pole star of the artist's own life, but its chastening purity\r\nshould preside over all his conceptions. A profane or unchaste work of\r\nart is a sacrilege against the most High; an insult to those divine\r\nattributes in whose image that artist himself was made, and which he\r\nmust constantly struggle to suggest or typify, that the work of his hand\r\nprove not a golden calf, an offence both to God and man. The moral ideal\r\nalways advances as we approach it. 'Be ye perfect as I am perfect,' is\r\nthe precept of the Master. This is the justification of the poet when he\r\nportrays men in advance of the common level of life. The _moral_\r\nBeautiful is the realization of _Duty_, which the poet should picture in\r\nits most sublime form. He may and should sing of the passions, but _Duty\r\nis the eternal pole star of the soul_! The susceptible heart of the\r\nartist must respect the majesty of virtue. Unless his escutcheon glitter\r\nwith the brilliancy of purity, he is not worthy to be one of the\r\nIllustrious Band whose high mission upon earth (with lowly reverence be\r\nit said) is the manifestation of the Divine Attributes. O Holy Banner,\r\nborne through the streets of the Heavenly City by saints and angels,\r\nwill the artist suffer thy snowy folds to be dragged through the mire of\r\ncrime? Shame to him when he dallies in the Circean Hall of the senses!\r\nInfamy when he wallows in the sty of sensuality!\r\n\r\nThe effort to apprehend and reproduce the Supernal Loveliness on the\r\npart of souls fittingly constituted so to do, has given to our race all\r\nthe marvels, the softening and elevating influences of the Ideal Realm.\r\nThe purest, the most exciting, the most intense pleasure is to be found\r\nin the _pure_ contemplation of Beauty. We may indulge in it without\r\nfear--no Hock and soda are required after its safe excitements! In this\r\ncontemplation alone do we find it possible to attain that pleasurable\r\nelevation, _that excitement of the soul_, which we recognize as always\r\ndependent upon our introduction into the Realm of the Ideal. This\r\nexcitement of the _soul_ is easily distinguished from the excitement of\r\nthe _mind_ consequent upon the perception of logical truths, the\r\nsatisfaction of the reason; or from passion, the excitement of the\r\n_heart_. The excitement of the _soul_ is strictly and simply the\r\ntemporary satisfaction of the human aspiration for the Supernal Beauty;\r\nand is quite independent of the search for finite truths for the\r\ngratification of the _intellect_; or of that of passion, which is the\r\nintoxication of the _heart_. For in regard to passion of the heart, its\r\nhome lies too near the senses to be entirely safe, and its tendency may\r\nbe to degrade;--while there may be high and useful truths which do not\r\nmove the _soul_ in the least.\r\n\r\nThe arts, then, always occupied with the reproduction of Beauty, gain\r\ntheir power over the soul of man by reminding him of the Divine\r\nAttributes. His thirst for the beautiful belongs to his immortality, for\r\nit never rests in the appreciation of mere finite beauty, but struggles\r\nwildly to obtain the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of\r\nthe glories beyond the grave, we struggle, by multiform combinations\r\namong the things and thoughts of time, to attain a portion of that\r\nloveliness whose elements pertain to Eternity alone; and thus, when by\r\npoetry or music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find\r\nourselves melted into tears, we are not moved through any excess of\r\npleasure, but through an impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp\r\n_now, wholly, here on earth_, those divine and rapturous joys of which,\r\nthrough the poem or through the music, we obtain but brief and\r\nindeterminate glimpses:\r\n\r\n  'Tears, idle tears, we know not whence they're flowing,\r\n  Tears from the depths of some _divine despair_.'\r\n\r\nTears of the created, the finite, for the Creator, the Infinite!\r\n\r\nEvery phenomenon of the material world is not a sign of the divine\r\nthought, when considered apart from its relations with other things, as\r\nevery isolated word in a language is not, in itself, a sign of our\r\nthought. There is something in the nature of things which constitutes\r\nthe visible sign the symbol of the Invisible. To reveal or suggest the\r\nAbsolute, it is not sufficient for the artist to combine fortuitously\r\nmere natural phenomena; he must be able to select those in which God has\r\nincarnated His Idea. Where is he to find a guide through this labyrinth\r\nof sounds, forms, tones, and colors?\r\n\r\nHe must strive to realize the ideas given him by the Creator; he must\r\nsurround us here with the memories of our lost Paradise; he must repeat\r\nto us the mysterious words and tones which God confides to his heart in\r\nhis lonely walks to the holy temple, in his solitary musings in the dim\r\nforests, or in his prayerful hours under the starlit heavens of the\r\nsolemn midnight.\r\n\r\n     'With whose beauty (of created things) if they being delighted took\r\n     them to be gods, let them know how much the Lord of them is more\r\n     beautiful than they: _for the first Author of Beauty made all those\r\n     things_.'--_Book of Wisdom._\r\n\r\n     'And they shall strengthen the state of the world; and _their\r\n     prayer shall be in the work of their craft_, applying their soul,\r\n     and searching in the law of the Most High.'--_Ecclesiasticus._\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the secret--gratitude and love are to be the teachers of\r\nthe artist. Naught save love will enable him to read the wondrous runes\r\nof God's creation; nothing but sympathy can catch the strange tones of\r\nmythic music; there is nothing pure, which can be painted, save by the\r\npure in heart. The foul or blunt feeling will see itself in everything,\r\nand set down blasphemies; it will see Beelzebub in the casting out of\r\ndevils; it will find its God of flies in every alabaster box of precious\r\nointment; in faith and zeal toward God it will not believe; charity it\r\nwill regard as lust; compassion as pride; every virtue it will\r\nmisinterpret, every faithfulness malign. But the mind of the devout\r\nartist will find its own image wherever it exists; it will seek for what\r\nit loves, and draw it out of dens and caves; it will believe in its\r\nbeing, often where it cannot see it, and always turn away its eyes from\r\nbeholding vanity; it will lie lovingly over all the foul and rough\r\nplaces of the human heart, as the snow from heaven does over the hard\r\nand broken mountain rocks, following their forms truly, yet catching\r\nlight from heaven for them to make them fair--and that must be a steep\r\nand unkindly crag, indeed, which it cannot cover.\r\n\r\nThe artist must direct his eyes to the spheres of Sovereign Beauty; he\r\nmust lend his ears to the harmonies of the Eternal World, that he may be\r\nable to decipher the symbolic signs which manifest the Being of beings,\r\nand recognize the voices which murmur His Name; for in humble reverence,\r\nyet joyful gratitude, it may be said that God Himself is the First,\r\nTrue, and Last Master of the Artist.\r\n\r\nPoetry and the arts have an end, ordained by Providence, with respect to\r\nthe extension of _social_ intercourse; a sacred duty to fulfil to\r\nhumanity at large. The signs of the times are startling; religions and\r\ngovernments seem driven by a whirlwind, and it is of vital importance\r\nthat everything should be cultivated which has any tendency to bring men\r\ntogether, to link multiform variety to unity; the national variety to\r\nits distinctive unity; the variety of these distinctive unities, these\r\nnational governments of all races and peoples, to one great Unity of\r\ngovernment, freedom, development, justice, and love. There seems to be\r\nbut little doubt that our own country is destined to become the _central\r\nheart_ of this marvellous _unity_. Is not the very war, now raging over\r\nher fair fields, a war for Union? A false element allowed to exist in\r\nour code of universal freedom, we mean slavery, like all Satanic\r\nelements, has struggled to bring division, faction, disintegration,\r\ndeath, in its train. It has convulsed, but awakened our country. Its\r\nreign is almost over; its powers to dissever and destroy are now being\r\nrapidly eliminated from a Constitution whose basic meaning is justice,\r\nequality, and love. The battle is waging in this vast area of freedom,\r\nnot for spoil, dominion, vengeance, or ambition, but simply for _Union_\r\neven with our enemies! Liberty, union, life, are parts and portions of\r\nGod's own law; slavery, dismemberment, death, belong of old to Lucifer.\r\nWhere God and Demon combat, can the strife be doubtful?\r\n\r\nWe suffer that we may be purified; but a Union broader, juster, and more\r\nbeneficent than any the world has yet seen, is to bud, bourgeon, and\r\nbloom from this bloody contest. The rose of love is yet to grow upon\r\nthis crimson soil, and brother yet to stand with brother to insure the\r\nunion of the world. The glory of our present struggle for the happiness\r\nof humanity, will yet be hailed by every living soul!\r\n\r\nThis is the unity sung by prophets, felt by poets, and foreshadowed in\r\nthe writings of statesmen, historians, and metaphysicians. Industry,\r\npolitics, commerce, science, and the arts, are the means which God has\r\nplaced at man's disposal to aid him in the accomplishment of this mighty\r\nwork. Man is _one_ in the fall of Adam; _one_ in the redemption of\r\nChrist. Individuality and solidarity are but man's variety and unity.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that a mere combination of commercial interests\r\ndoes but little for the heart; science, with its exact formulas, is\r\nalmost equally powerless; they form together but the bony skeleton of a\r\nlifeless union; poetry and the arts must clothe it with the soft and\r\nclinging flesh, quicken it with the throbbing heart, and warm it with\r\nthe loving soul of an all-embracing humanity; and it is, to say the\r\nleast, very remarkable how exactly this important task is in keeping\r\nwith the nature of the arts, because they alone express the _feelings_,\r\nthe _distinctive individualities_ of men and nations, while the sciences\r\nreveal only the 'impersonal' of the intellect. That a man may\r\ndemonstrate mathematical problems tells us nothing of his heart; if he\r\npaint a single violet rightly, it tells of truth, sympathy, and love.\r\nMen never leave in their scientific researches the traces of the\r\ndifferent phases of the soul, the _imprint_ of their own _personality_;\r\nthe sciences have everywhere the same character, because they contain\r\ndiscrete and abstract ideas, necessarily the same in all minds.\r\n\r\nIn the creations of art, on the contrary, _feeling_, the spirit of life,\r\nis added to the pure idea, and this new element of _individual\r\ncharacter_ introduced into the thought is, in its infinite subtlety,\r\nsufficient to produce the immense variety which exists in the poetic and\r\nartistic creations of different men, of different ages, and of different\r\nnations. And the reason of this is very simple; it is because the heart\r\nis the seat of _distinctive personality_. We never _love_ men for what\r\nthey _know_; we love them for what they feel and _are_. It is\r\nconsequently _feeling_ which is the principle of _union_ among men.\r\n\r\nThus it is through art and literature alone that national\r\nindividualities _really_ communicate with each other; it is through them\r\nthat what is _characteristic_ in each is made known to all; it is\r\nthrough them that embittered, long-seated, and deeply-rooted national\r\nprejudices must be dissipated; through them that the fusion of minds,\r\nviolently hostile to each other only because of their mutual ignorance\r\nand misconception of character, must eventually be effected. Before the\r\nmeans of constant intercommunication, daily becoming more rapid and\r\nperfect, shall have compassed the whole earth with their lines of\r\nlightning, before all nations shall be known to one another as\r\ninhabitants of the same city--the artists, through art and literature,\r\nwill have confided to the human heart of their brethren their own most\r\nsacred feelings, the hidden beatings of their life-pulse, so that when\r\nthe material barriers separating souls shall fall, when steam and iron\r\nshall subdue space and time, men of distant climes will no longer stand\r\nas strangers to one another, but meet with all the enthusiasm of near\r\nand dear friends long since initiated in all the holy and tender secrets\r\nof the home hearth; the due place of affection, honor, and gratitude\r\nready for all true souls at the sacred fireside of appreciative\r\nfraternal love.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the art marked and conditioned by the necessity of\r\nthe most _perfect unity_, the art almost exclusively intended for the\r\nexpression of and appeal to the feelings of the soul, the art without\r\nmaterial model of any kind, and consequently the most ideal and original\r\nof all, in which the pulse of time itself marshals the tones in order,\r\nsymmetry, and proportion, coloring them with the joys and woes, hopes\r\nand fears of humanity--should now be undoubtedly entering upon a new era\r\nof far higher and wider development. This fact contains a germ which is\r\nto blossom in the most brilliant bloom; the crowning flower in that\r\n_living unity_, which is, indeed, the '_manifest Destiny_' of our race.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly something exceedingly remarkable in the unitive\r\npowers of music. In the first place, its present popularization cannot\r\nfail to multiply the relations of men with one another, as each separate\r\ninstrument, like an arithmetical figure, has an _absolute_, as well as a\r\n_relative_ value. It may not be sufficient in itself to produce\r\n_harmony_; but when placed in UNION with others, it gains a double or\r\ntriple value, according to the part assigned it in a musical Whole. A\r\nsingle _jar_ in time or tune spoils the entire effect of the marvellous\r\nvariety and order, attained in the _utter oneness_ of any good musical\r\nwork. The desire to increase the limits of art, to multiply its\r\ndelicious emotions, will infallibly lead those who cultivate this\r\nethereal study to frequent reunions, in order that they may produce the\r\nBeautiful in more fulness, obtain a greater variety of effect and tone,\r\ncradled, as it must ever be in music, in the bosom of the strictest\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nMusic has its own trinity, composed of Rhythm, Melody, and Harmony.\r\n_Rhythm_ is the pulse of time; the tones register its heart beats and\r\nmanifest its soul, its _melody_; _harmony_ is the concurrent sympathy or\r\nantagonism elicited by its annunciation in the invisible realm in which\r\nit moves. Unity is first manifested in the rhythm; then, as the tones\r\n_consecutively_ follow each other, the succeeding one always born and\r\ngrowing immediately from the one just expiring, in the consequent\r\n_melody_; and lastly, as the tones progress _simultaneously_, hand to\r\nhand, and heart to heart, with the single line or passion of the melody,\r\nconditioned and responding to it in all its varied phases--(the\r\nindividual and collective, the soul and its surroundings)--the grand\r\ndiapason of harmony rolls on--and the magic _unity_ of music is\r\ncomplete! Hence, part of its power over men. But like all organic, basic\r\nlife-principles, its relations with the human spirit defy analysis. Its\r\nunitive influence cannot be denied, even by those who do not feel its\r\ncharm. Let them but consider that no public act of humanity implying the\r\n_primeval unity_ of the race, is considered complete without it, and\r\nthey must be convinced that it is pre-eminently the art of social union.\r\nWhen an entire nation collects as a band of brothers to resist\r\naggression, to repel invasion, it is music, the unitive art, which\r\nanimates them to seek death itself to resist wrongs which would burden\r\nall, its very rhythm keeping in massive _unison_, _together_, the tread\r\nof thousands, causing all hearts to throb in _one_ measure, and so\r\nregulating the most heterogenous masses that they move as it were as\r\n_one_ mighty man. And in all public acknowledgments of our collective\r\ndependence as _one_ race upon the _one_ God, music alone is considered\r\nsufficiently symbolic and tender to express the universal sense of\r\nhelplessness, of generic trust in His marvellous mercy.\r\n\r\nMusic blesses the innocent bride with the first chant of forever\r\n_united_, and consequently holy love. It hallows at the baptismal font\r\nthe introduction of the infant into the mystical _oneness_ of the\r\nchildren of Christ. Even at the grave it softens human sorrow by its\r\nheavenly whisperings of _eternal union_ in the bosom of Infinite love.\r\n\r\nFrance is ever ready to receive Italian, Sclavonic, and German artists\r\nwith characteristic and appreciative enthusiasm; and America applauds\r\nwith _naïve_ rapture that skill, as yet, alas! foreign to her native\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n  'I pant for the music which is divine,\r\n    My heart in its thirst is a dying flower;\r\n  Pour forth the sound like enchanted wine;\r\n    Loosen the notes in a silver shower;\r\n  Like an herbless plain, for the gentle rain,\r\n  I gasp, I faint, till they wake again.\r\n\r\n  'Let me drink of the spirit of that sweet sound--\r\n    More--oh, more--I am thirsting yet!\r\n  It loosens the serpent which care has bound\r\n    Upon my heart to stifle it;\r\n  The dissolving strain, in every vein,\r\n  Passes into my heart and brain.'\r\n\r\n  SHELLEY.\r\n\r\nArtists and litterateurs are the true representatives of the countries\r\nin which they live; because they alone reveal to us the secret\r\nthrobbings of the great national heart; and the warm and sympathetic\r\nfeelings which they excite in foreign climes, are _golden links_ drawing\r\nmore closely the ties of mutual understanding and affection, welding\r\nthem together in that generous _reciprocal_ esteem and comprehension,\r\nwhich is destined to _unite_ all climes and tongues.\r\n\r\n     'A touch of nature makes the whole world kin.'\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of life are widening and increasing. Societies are\r\nconstantly arising devoting themselves to the solacing of human misery;\r\neager sympathies are evinced by different countries in the sufferings of\r\ndistant lands; ready and substantial aid is gladly tendered in cases of\r\npestilence and famine; and religious intolerance and bigotry are raving\r\nthemselves to rest. Christ is more and creeds are less than of old. The\r\nfact that a free government is now in successful operation, in which\r\n(when one false element, slavery, shall be forever eliminated) the\r\nvoluntary annexation of new states and new countries would be but new\r\nties of strength, with the consentaneous and related facts above\r\nquoted, tend to prove that humanity is entering upon a new era; that it\r\nis not destined to trail its passionate and quivering wings much longer\r\nthrough the mire of mere materialism; but that newer and higher life is\r\nspreading _simultaneously_ through all its members; that the elevating\r\nlove of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, is hourly penetrating it\r\nmore deeply; that after its intellect shall have been trained by the\r\nsciences--its force increased by industry, commerce, and\r\nstatesmanship--its inmost heart will be developed by the Charities, now,\r\nas with the subtile Greeks, _one_ with the Graces--the arts for the\r\nmanifestation of the Beautiful. Everything tends to prove, even the wars\r\nnow waging for national entities, that the human race is approaching\r\nthat _promised_ phase of civilization, in which _all_ the elements are\r\nto combine in glorious _unity_, sound in witching harmony, and men, full\r\nof love to God and man, are to become living stones in the vast temple\r\nof the redeemed, _one_ through the loving heart of the Brother who died\r\nfor them all; _one_ through Him with the Infinite God, since in Him\r\nfinite and Infinite are forever _one_!\r\n\r\nA few words in the cause of those in advance of their times, and we\r\nattain the close of our first volume.\r\n\r\nIt is a startling fact, in the history of humanity, that the benefactors\r\nof the race have always been its martyrs and victims; dyeing every\r\nglorious gift which they have won for their brethren in the royal purple\r\nof the kingly blood of their own hearts. Is this, brethren, to last\r\nforever? Shall we never requite the dauntless Columbus, in the wide sea\r\nof Beauty? Of all men living, the artist most requires the boon of\r\nsympathy. The most susceptible of them all, the musician, plunging into\r\nthe unseen depths of the time-ocean to wrestle for his gems, feels his\r\nheart die within him, when he sees his fellow men turn coldly away from\r\nthe pure and priceless pearls which he has won for them from the stormy\r\nwaves and whirlpools of chaotic and compassless sound.\r\n\r\nAs the artists must be considered as the standard-bearers of that\r\nblissful banner of progress to be effected through the culture of the\r\n_sympathies_ of the race, unrolling that great Oriflamme of humanity, on\r\nwhich bloom the Heavenly Lilies of that chaste Passion of the Soul--_the\r\nlonging for the infinite_--let us acknowledge that we have failed to\r\nrender happy the great spirits no longer among us; and let us strive,\r\nfor the future, not to chill with our mistrust and coldness, not to\r\ndrive into the sickness of despair with our want of intelligent\r\nsympathy, the gifted living, who, as angels of a better covenant, still\r\nlovingly linger among us! Let us strive to learn the lesson set before\r\nus with such tenderness in the following eloquent words of Ruskin,\r\nfitting close as they are to the many which we have already collated and\r\ncombined with our work from his glowing pages.\r\n\r\n     'He who has once stood beside the grave to look back upon the\r\n     companionship now forever closed, feeling how impotent _there_ are\r\n     the wild love and keen sorrow to give one moment's pleasure to the\r\n     pulseless heart, or atone in the lowest measure to the departed\r\n     spirit for the hour of unkindness, will scarcely for the future\r\n     incur that debt to the _heart_ which can only be discharged to the\r\n     _dust_. But the lessons which men receive as _individuals_, they\r\n     never learn as _nations_. Again and again they have seen their\r\n     _noblest_ descend into the grave, and have thought it enough to\r\n     garland the tombstone when they have not crowned the brow, and to\r\n     pay the honor to the _ashes_ which they had denied to the _spirit_.\r\n     Let it not displease them that they are bidden, amidst the tumult\r\n     and glitter of their busy life, to listen for the few voices and\r\n     watch for the few lamps which God has toned and lighted to charm\r\n     and guide them, that they may not learn their sweetness by their\r\n     silence, nor their light by their decay.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning, the highest poet of our own century, has\r\nthus given us the artist's creed of resignation, closing her chant with\r\nhis sublime Te Deum:\r\n\r\n\r\nVOICE OF THE CREATOR.\r\n\r\n  ''And, O ye gifted givers, ye\r\n  Who give your liberal hearts to me,\r\n  To make the world this harmony,--\r\n\r\n  ''Are ye resigned that they be spent\r\n  To such world's help?' The spirits bent\r\n  Their awful brows, and said--'Content!\r\n\r\n  ''We ask no wages--seek no fame!\r\n  Sew us for shroud round face and name,\r\n  God's banner of the oriflamme.\r\n\r\n  ''We are content to be so bare\r\n  Before the archers! everywhere\r\n  Our wounds being stroked by heavenly air.\r\n\r\n  ''We lay our souls before thy feet,\r\n  That Images of fair and sweet\r\n  Should walk to other men on it.\r\n\r\n  ''We are content to feel the step\r\n  Of each pure Image!--let those keep\r\n  To mandragore, who care to sleep:\r\n\r\n  ''For though we must have, and have had\r\n  Right reason to be earthly sad--\r\n  THOU POET-GOD, ART GREAT AND GLAD!''\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIONS OF SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 'restoration' mania which now pervades Great Britain, however much\r\nit be declaimed against by certain hypercritical architects, is yet\r\ncertain to have at least one favorable result, in preserving to the\r\nfuture tourist the noblest monuments of the past. The abbeys and castles\r\nand tombs of England and Scotland are now so well cared for, that, ruins\r\nthough they be, they will last for centuries. And yet the observant\r\ntraveller can note, year by year, little changes, trifling alterations,\r\nwhich, though without great importance, are not destitute of interest;\r\nfor he who has once visited Melrose, will be interested to learn that\r\neven one more stone has fallen from the ruin.\r\n\r\nIt is intended, in the following pages, to review the present condition,\r\nand state the recent changes in the 'Lions of Scotland,' and\r\nparticularly in the localities with which the memories of Burns and\r\nScott--memories so dear, both to the untravelled and travelled\r\nAmerican--are most closely associated. Of the thousands of visitors who\r\nyearly flock to do mental homage at the tomb of Shakespeare, one out of\r\nevery ten is from the United States; and so a large minority of the\r\ntourists in Scotland, and particularly of those most deeply interested\r\nin Scotland's greatest bards, hail from the New World. The conclusion of\r\nthe war will probably be the signal for an unusual hegira from America\r\nto Europe; and these notes of the actual condition, in A.D. 1863, of\r\nScotland's famed shrines, may serve to whet the increasing appetite for\r\nforeign travel.\r\n\r\n'Bobby Burns' is buried at Dumfries, a rather dull town, which,\r\nfortunately for the tourist, has no notable church or ruin to be visited\r\n_nolens volens_. The place has, however, a Continental air, caused\r\nprincipally by the very curious clock tower in the market place; a\r\nquaint spire, in the background, adding to the effect of the\r\narchitectural picture.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the town is St. Michael's church--a huge, square box,\r\npierced by windows, and guarded by a big sentinel of a bell tower,\r\nsurmounted by another quaint spire. The graveyard is one of the oddest\r\nin the kingdom, presenting long rows of huge tombstones, twelve or\r\nfifteen feet high, usually painted of a muddy cream color, each one\r\nserving for an entire family, and recording the trades or professions as\r\nwell as the names and ages of the deceased. One of these enormous stones\r\nis in commemoration of the victims of the cholera in 1832.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the cemetery is the tasteless mausoleum of Burns--a\r\ncircular Grecian temple, the spaces between the pillars glazed, and a\r\nlow dome, shaped like an inverted washbowl, clapped on top. The interior\r\nis occupied by Turnerelli's fine marble group of Burns at the plough,\r\ninterrupted by the Muse of Poetry. At the foot of this group, and\r\ncovering the poet's remains, is the freshly painted slab, bearing these\r\ninscriptions:\r\n\r\n  IN MEMORY OF\r\n  ROBERT BURNS,\r\n  WHO DIED THE 21ST OF JULY, 1796,\r\n  IN THE 37TH YEAR OF HIS AGE:\r\n\r\n  AND\r\n\r\n  MAXWELL BURNS,\r\n  WHO DIED THE 25TH APRIL, 1799,\r\n  AGED 2 YEARS AND 9 MONTHS;\r\n\r\n  FRANCIS WALLACE BURNS,\r\n  WHO DIED THE 9TH JULY, 1803,\r\n  AGED 14 YEARS--HIS SONS.\r\n\r\n  THE REMAINS OF BURNS,\r\n  REMOVED INTO THE VAULT BELOW\r\n  19TH SEPTEMBER, 1815--AND HIS TWO SONS.\r\n\r\n  ALSO THE REMAINS OF\r\n  JEAN ARMOUR,\r\n  RELICT OF THE POET,\r\n  BORN 6TH FEBRUARY, 1765,\r\n  DIED 26TH MARCH, 1834;\r\n\r\n  AND ROBERT, HIS ELDEST SON,\r\n  DIED MAY 14, 1857,\r\n  AGED 70 YEARS.\r\n\r\nVisitors are allowed to enter the cheerful, if not elegant mausoleum,\r\nthough all it contains can be seen through the windows. All the\r\nmemorials of Burns, by the way, seem to be of the same tasteless\r\nstyle--the same wearisome imitation of the antique. The monument at Ayr,\r\nand that on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, are but additional examples.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Dumfries, let me allude to a very curious custom,\r\nobserved only in St. Michael's church, and even there beginning to fall\r\ninto desuetude. The Scotch, who are alike noted for snuff and religious\r\nausterity, are equally devoted to footstools. In many families, where\r\neconomy is the rule, one footstool--they are mere little wooden\r\nbenches--serves both for the fireside and the kirk. To facilitate\r\ntransportation, these benches are provided with little holes perforating\r\nthe centre of the seat, large enough to admit the ferule of an umbrella\r\nor cane; and thus, borne aloft on these articles, the little benches are\r\ncarried proudly above the shoulders of the bearers, like triumphant\r\nbanners. In order to avoid the noise arising from the clatter of these\r\nbenches as they are lowered into the pews, the congregation are\r\naccustomed to assemble some time before divine service begins.\r\n\r\nA similar custom once prevailed in the cathedral at Glasgow. In 1588 the\r\nkirk session decided that seats in the church would be a great luxury,\r\nand certain ash trees in the churchyard were cut down, and devoted to\r\nthe then novel purpose; but ungallantly enough, the women of the\r\ncongregation were forbidden to sit on the new seats, and were ordered to\r\nbring stools along with them. Tradition, however, fails to record\r\nwhether the Glasgow ladies carried their stools on the tops of\r\numbrellas, like their sisters of Dumfries.\r\n\r\nThe grave of Burns owes to its uncouth monument the unsatisfactory\r\nfeeling which it inspires in visitors. Alloway kirk is the place where\r\nthe remains of the favorite Scottish poet should lie. Instead of\r\nartificial temples, badly copied from a clime and nation with which he\r\nhad no sympathy or affinity, the young daisy and the fresh grass should\r\nmark his resting place.\r\n\r\n'Alloway's kirk haunted wall' is preserved with such faithful care, that\r\nthis year it looks very much the same as it did when Burns knew it. As a\r\nruin, apart from the interest with which the poet has invested it, it\r\npossesses nothing to attract attention. Two end walls, which once\r\nsupported a gable roof, and two low side walls, all without ornament of\r\nany kind--without gothic tracing or oriel wonders--without even\r\ngraceful ivy flung over its ruggedness--are all that remain of Alloway,\r\nif we except the old bell, which yet hangs in the little belfry; a sign\r\nboard below insulting visitors by requesting them not to throw stones at\r\nit!\r\n\r\nThe little churchyard of Alloway continues to be a burial place; but the\r\ngravestones seem, in many instances, sadly inconsistent with the\r\npoetical associations of the place. As at Dumfries, the business\r\noccupations of the deceased are mentioned; and we find here the family\r\ntombs of 'Robert Anderson, molecatcher,' of 'James Wallace, blacksmith,'\r\nand the like. David Watt Miller, who was buried here in 1823, was the\r\nlast person baptized in the old Alloway kirk--his tombstone recording\r\nthe fact. Near the entrance to the graveyard, and opposite the new\r\ngothic edifice which has taken the place of the old kirk, is the slab to\r\nthe poet's father and sister, thus inscribed:\r\n\r\n  'Sacred to the memory of WILLIAM BURNS, farmer\r\n    in Lochie, who died February 13, 1784, in\r\n    the 63d year of his age.\r\n\r\n  Also of ISABELLA, relict of JOHN BELL; his\r\n    youngest daughter, born at Mount Oliphant,\r\n    June 27, 1771; died December 4, 1858, much\r\n    respected and esteemed by a wide circle of\r\n    friends, to whom she endeared herself by her\r\n    life of piety, her mild urbanity of manner, and\r\n    her devotion to the memory of BURNS.'\r\n\r\nThe reader is aware that Alloway's kirk, the Burns monument, the cottage\r\nwhere the poet was born, the elaborate temple, erected to his memory,\r\nand Tam O'Shanter's brig, are all within a few rods of each other, at\r\nabout two miles' distance from Ayr. The view of the temple, kirk, and\r\n'brig,' from the opposite side of the stream, is worthy of Arcadia. The\r\ntemple is familiar from engravings; but the bridge, with its graceful\r\narch, draped by low-hanging ivy, is far more beautiful. Yet this\r\nexquisite scene is identified with one of Burns's coarsest efforts--one\r\nwhich, with all its vividness and humor, cannot be read aloud in the\r\nfamily circle. Fortunately, however, for the poet, his fame by no means\r\nrests on this unequal mixture of the humorous, the beautiful, and the\r\nvulgar; and instead of admiring Tam O'Shanter's bridge itself, it is\r\nmuch more pleasant to stand upon it, and gaze therefrom at the river\r\nwhich laves the 'banks and braes o' bonnie Doon'--at the fields\r\nbesprinkled with the 'wee, crimsoned-tipped flower'--at the cottages\r\nwhere once lived the 'auld acquaintance' of 'lang syne,' and where\r\noccurred the scenes of 'The Cotter's Saturday Night.' 'Highland Mary'\r\nhas crossed this bridge, and this sanctifies it far more than the\r\nimaginary terrors of Tam O'Shanter.\r\n\r\nAn hour's railway ride takes the tourist from the land of Burns to the\r\nscenes rendered sacred by the genius of Scott.\r\n\r\nAbbotsford, the favorite home, of course is still open to visitors, who\r\nare hurried though it with the most disgusting celerity, by the guide\r\nengaged by the family to 'do'--at a shilling a head--the hospitalities\r\nof the place. The home of Scott retains all the characteristics it did\r\nwhen he died; but is shown in such a heartless, museum-like manner, that\r\nthe visitor need not expect much gratification from the inspection.\r\n\r\nA few miles farther up the Tweed is Ashetiel, the former home of Walter\r\nScott, a place seldom seen by tourists, though here he wrote his finest\r\npoems. Some time ago I was invited to spend a night with a farmer who\r\nresides on the estate. Those who have read Washington Irving's graphic\r\ndescription of his visit to Abbotsford, will remember Mr. Laidlaw, of\r\nwhom he thus writes:\r\n\r\n'One of my pleasant rambles with Scott, about the neighborhood of\r\nAbbotsford, was taken in company with Mr. William Laidlaw, the steward\r\nof his estate. This was a gentleman for whom Scott entertained a\r\nparticular value. He had been born to a competency, had been well\r\neducated; his mind was richly stored with varied information, and he\r\nwas a man of sterling moral worth. Having been reduced by misfortune,\r\nScott had got him to take charge of his estate. He lived at a small farm\r\non the hillside above Abbotsford, and was treated by Scott as a\r\ncherished and confidential friend, rather than a dependant.' My worthy\r\nhost was the son of this old gentleman, who is still alive and in good\r\nhealth. Several years ago he emigrated to Australia, where he now\r\nresides, still taking a lively interest in literary affairs, and\r\nreading, though an octogenarian, all the new works, that are regularly\r\nsent to him by his son. The old gentleman was as intimately acquainted\r\nwith Hogg as with Scott, and my host remembers both these personages,\r\nthough he was but a boy when they died.\r\n\r\nEarly one September morning Mr. Laidlaw was kind enough to take me about\r\nthe grounds of Ashestiel, where 'Sir Walter' (they never add the name of\r\nScott, in speaking of him here) passed thirteen of the best years of his\r\nlife, and where he wrote the greater parts of 'Marmion' and the 'Lay.'\r\nWe walked over the dewy fields (romantic but damp), and down to the\r\nbanks of the Tweed, where I was shown a large outspreading oak, under\r\nwhich Sir Walter was wont to sit and frame his ideas into fitting words.\r\nUnder this tree, with Tweed rippling at his feet, he spent many an hour\r\nin communion with himself, quietly weaving those strains that have\r\nimmortalized him. From this place we passed on to the house\r\nitself--Ashestiel--now the residence of Sir William Johnstone, from\r\nwhose family Sir Walter had leased it during the building of Abbotsford.\r\nIt is a fine old building; but much altered and improved since it was\r\noccupied by Scott. Lockhart says of this place: 'No more beautiful\r\nsituation, for the residence of a poet, could be imagined. The house was\r\nthen a small one; but, compared with the cottage of Lasswade, its\r\naccommodations were amply sufficient. The approach was through an\r\nold-fashioned garden, with holly hedges, and broad, green terrace walks.\r\nOn one side, close under the windows, is a deep ravine, clothed with\r\nvenerable trees, down which a mountain rivulet is heard, more than seen,\r\non its progress to the Tweed. The river itself is separated from the\r\nhigh bank, on which the house stands, only by a narrow meadow, of the\r\nrichest verdure; while opposite, and all around are the green hills. The\r\nvalley there is narrow, and the aspect in every direction is that of\r\nperfect pastoral repose.' This picture still holds good, with the\r\nexception of the 'old-fashioned garden,' which has made way for a new\r\nlawn and carriage road. The proprietor was an intimate friend of Walter\r\nScott, and an India officer of merit, who has now returned to his old\r\nhome, having bidden farewell to the neighing steed and all the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of war.\r\n\r\nFrom the house I was conducted to another of Scott's haunts--a little\r\nwooded grassy knoll, still known by the name of 'Wattie's Knowe,' or\r\n'Sheriff's Knowe,' for Scott enjoyed both the familiar title of 'Wattie'\r\nand the official one of 'Sheriff.' It is a lovely spot, this Wattie's\r\nKnowe. The trees are old and gnarled; the grass is overrun with green\r\nmoss and graceful fern-leaves, and if you are quite still, you can hear\r\nthe murmur of Glenkinnon Burn, as it leaps over its pebbly bed, and\r\nhastens on to the Tweed. Here, between the branching trunks of a huge\r\nelm, Scott had fixed a rustic seat, to which he resorted nearly as often\r\nas to his favorite oak tree on the banks of the Tweed. While he resided\r\nhere, Abbotsford was building; and almost daily he would ride over to\r\nsuperintend its progress.\r\n\r\nMelrose is this year guarded with unusual vigilance. Hitherto visitors\r\nhave been allowed to pass hours in the ruin, at their leisure, and read\r\nthe wizard scene of the 'Lay of the Last Minstrel,' in the very\r\nlocality where it is supposed to have occurred. At present, however, a\r\nsable widow, of the most unimpeachable respectability, casts a\r\nmelancholy gloom over the place by the dejected yet resigned manner in\r\nwhich she unlocks the wooden gate and ushers strangers through the nave\r\nand transepts. Her orders, she says, are to allow no one to remain a\r\nmoment in the ruin without her superintending presence--which is safe,\r\nbut unpoetical.\r\n\r\nDryburgh, the ruin in which is the tomb of Walter Scott, is shown by an\r\nintelligent man who oversees the place. At the foot of Sir Walter's\r\ngranite tomb is that recently erected to the memory of 'the son-in-law,\r\nbiographer, and friend,' Lockhart. A bronze medallion likeness of the\r\neminent reviewer adorns the red polished granite of his tomb. The\r\nErskine family, the Haigs of Bemerside, and the earls of Buchan, are the\r\nonly families, besides Sir Walter's ancestors, the Haliburtons, who are\r\nallowed to bury in this ruin. It was of the Haigs that Thomas the\r\nRhymer, centuries ago, made a prediction to the effect that the line\r\nwould never become extinct--a prediction which threatens to fail, as two\r\nmaiden ladies now alone represent the family.\r\n\r\nThat 'proud chapelle,'\r\n\r\n  '----where Roslyn's chiefs uncoffined lie,'\r\n\r\nhas seen some notable changes of late. A few years ago, it contained\r\nonly tombs; but the present Earl of Roslyn recently fitted it up for a\r\ndivine service, according to the Church of England ritual, though the\r\naltar, the sedilia, the candles, the purple cloths, the painted organ,\r\nand other ecclesiastical decorations suggest an imitation of the Roman\r\nCatholic services, to which the chapel was formerly devoted. The people\r\nin the vicinity, who are all Scotch Presbyterians, do not attend these\r\nservices, the select congregation being formed by 'the quality'--the\r\ngentry and nobility, who have their country seats near by.\r\n\r\nThe readers of 'Marmion' will, of course, remember Norham and Twisell\r\ncastles. The former, as seen, from the railways, is a most uninviting\r\npile of rude masonry, worn and broken by time and decay; but a nearer\r\ninspection reveals many phases of interest. The castle stands on the\r\nsummit of a cliff, overhanging the Tweed, yet almost buried in rich\r\nfoliage. The outer walls are crumbled away, and overgrown with short\r\ngrass, forming a series of green mounds, which mark the graves of feudal\r\ngrandeur. The south, east, and west walls of the keep, however, remain\r\nstanding, a huge shell or screen of dull red stone, while to the north\r\nstretches a fragment of wall, along which it is easy to scramble to a\r\npoint overlooking the Tweed, the village of Norham, and the adjacent\r\nscenery. Pleasant and thrilling it is to lie here on this deserted ruin,\r\nand read that spirited opening canto! With what renewed brilliancy do\r\nthose chivalric lines bring back the long-past scenes of other days!\r\n\r\n  'Day set on Norham's castled steep,\r\n  And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,\r\n      And Cheviot's mountains lone:\r\n  The battled towers, the donjon keep,\r\n  The loophole grates where captives weep,\r\n  The flanking walls that round them sweep,\r\n      In yellow lustre shone.'\r\n\r\nAnd imagination can almost bring to the ear the welcome to Marmion:\r\n\r\n  'The guards their morrice pikes advanced,\r\n    The trumpets flourished brave,\r\n  The cannon from the ramparts glanced,\r\n    And thundering welcome gave.\r\n  A blythe salute in martial sort\r\n    The minstrels well might sound,\r\n  For, as Lord Marmion crossed the court,\r\n    He scattered angels round.\r\n  Welcome to Norham, Marmion!\r\n    Stout heart, and noble hand!\r\n  Well dost thou back thy gallant roan,\r\n    Thou flower of English land.'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'They marshall'd him to the castle hall,\r\n    Where the guests stood all aside,\r\n  And loudly flourished the trumpet call,\r\n    And the heralds loudly cried:\r\n  'Room, lordlings, room for Lord Marmion,\r\n    With the crest and helm of gold!\r\n  Full well we know the trophies won\r\n    In the lists at Cottiswold.\r\n  Place, nobles, for the Falcon Knight!\r\n    Room, room, ye gentles gay,\r\n  For him who conquered in the right,\r\n    Marmion of Fontenaye.''\r\n\r\nScott is already becoming old-fashioned, and his poems are not now\r\nsought after, as they were ten years ago; but any one who wishes to\r\nrevive all the boyish enthusiasm with which he first read 'Marmion,' has\r\nonly to take the book with him to the ruins of Norham and again read the\r\nglowing page!\r\n\r\nThe village of Norham is a quaint place dominated by the castle, and as\r\nhumble nowadays, with its little thatched cottages, as in the times when\r\nthe villagers were mere vassals of\r\n\r\n    'Sir Hugh, the Heron bold,\r\n  Baron of Twisell, and of Ford,\r\n    And Captain of the Hold.'\r\n\r\nA limpid stream runs down the principal street of Norham--a gutter,\r\nwhich in the sunlight gleams like a band of silver. Village damsels wash\r\npotatoes therein. Among the residents of Norham, by the way, is the\r\nhostess of the principal inn, who was in the train of Joseph Bonaparte,\r\nduring his stay in America, living in his household at Bordentown, New\r\nJersey. She claims to be a personal acquaintance of Napoleon III; but I\r\nhave not heard what strange wave of fortune stranded the friend of the\r\nEmperor of the French in the remote and unknown port of Norham.\r\n\r\nA curious family romance hangs about Twisell castle, also mentioned in\r\n'Marmion.' The present building, an immense quadrangular edifice, was\r\nbegun by Sir Francis Drake, who never had means to finish it. His heirs\r\ntried to complete the castle, which is now the property of a lady over\r\nseventy years old, residing in Edinburgh, who devotes all her spare\r\nmeans to the work. Indeed, the building of Twisell castle is a\r\nhereditary monomania in the family; but the estate belonging to the\r\nmagnificent structure is only forty acres in extent--utterly\r\ninsufficient to support such a castle with the household it will\r\nultimately need. As yet Twisell is a granite shell; no partitions are\r\nput up in the interior. Vast sums of money must be expended before it\r\ncan be made tenantable.\r\n\r\nBut I must forego any allusions to Crichton and Pantallon castles, the\r\nformer the place where Marmion was entertained, and the latter the spot\r\nwhere the bold chief dared\r\n\r\n    '----to beard the lion in his den,\r\n  The Douglas in his hall.'\r\n\r\nAnd I must also omit 'Newark's stately tower,' where the last minstrel\r\nsang his lay--and Branksome, the scene of the opening canto--and the\r\nscenery of Lomond and Katrine, rendered famous by the success of the\r\nLady of the Lake. All these, and many other localities, hallowed by\r\npoesy, can be easily visited by the enthusiastic tourist; but I prefer\r\nto devote my pen and space to the most neglected and most beautiful of\r\nthem all--to Lindisfarn, the Holy Isle.\r\n\r\nThough really in England, it is yet near enough to the border to be\r\nincluded among the Lions of Scotland. It lies on the coast, about a\r\ndozen miles south of Berwick-upon-Tweed, the nearest approach to it,\r\nbeing from the railway station of Beal. Here the visitor will find the\r\none-horse cart of the postmaster, offering the only conveyance to one of\r\nthe most romantic and retired spots in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nHoly Island, in circumference about eight miles, lies three miles from\r\nthe land; but is only an island at high tide. At other times, the\r\nreceding waters leave the sands bare, with the exception of two or three\r\nchannels, not more than six inches deep, and afford a passage for\r\nvehicles, marked by a long row of stakes, intended especially to guide\r\ntravellers in winter, when the snow falls thickly on the path. In summer\r\nthere is always a strong wind blowing over these sands, drying them\r\nfrom the salt water, forming picturesque patterns along the\r\never-changing ground, and dashing a thin veil of sand along the way. Woe\r\nto the unlucky wight who loses his hat in this place! With nothing to\r\nintercept it, the unfortunate headgear is at once taken by the wind and\r\nsent flying over the sandy plain, faster than human foot can run, far\r\nout to the island, and often over it to the sea beyond. The frolicsome\r\ndog, which generally accompanies the postmaster's cart, is the only hope\r\non which the hatless wretch can then rely; and usually this reliance is\r\nnot in vain.\r\n\r\nHoly Island contains a population of some 600 souls, mostly fishermen.\r\nNot a tree grows on the island; but at the south end, where a low\r\nvillage crouches down against the continual sweepings of the stormy\r\nwinds, are a few fields, fragrant with clover, and gleaming with\r\nbuttercups; and, in one of these fields, scarce a stone's throw from the\r\nbeating surf, stand the ruins of Lindisfarn Abbey, one of the earliest\r\nseats of Christianity in Great Britain, and one closely identified with\r\nthe traditionary career of St. Cuthbert. The front walls, portions of\r\nthe side walls, a diagonal arch richly ornamented, and the chancel\r\nrecently repaired to arrest further decay, remain to tell of its former\r\nbeauty. The area within the ruins is strewn with sea shells and pebbles,\r\nwhile about the bases, whence once sprang aloft the clustered pillars of\r\nthe nave, grow in rich profusion hardy yellow flowers. The sharp sea\r\nwinds have eaten into the stone in many places, reducing it to an\r\napparent honeycomb. No ripple of gentle streamlet falls on the ear; no\r\nluxuriant foliage offers its pleasant shade; no ivy drapery, stirred by\r\nthe summer breeze, floats from the decaying walls; but instead of these\r\ngentle attractions, which Tinter and Bolton and Valle Crucis offer, we\r\nhave at Lindisfarn the boom of the ocean surf and the biting freshness\r\nof the keen sea wind.\r\n\r\nScott thus describes Holy Island and Lindisfarn:\r\n\r\n  'The tide did now its floodmark gain,\r\n  And girdled in the saint's domain:\r\n  For, with the flow and ebb, its style\r\n  Varied from continent to isle;\r\n  Dryshod, o'er sands, twice every day,\r\n  The pilgrims to the shrine find way;\r\n  Twice every day, the waves efface\r\n  Of staves and sandalled feet the trace.\r\n  As to the port the galley flew,\r\n  Higher and higher rose to view\r\n  The castle, with its battled walls,\r\n  The ancient monastery's halls--\r\n  A solemn, huge, and dark-red pile,\r\n  Placed on the margin of the isle.\r\n  In Saxon strength that abbey frowned,\r\n  With massive arches broad and round,\r\n  That rose alternate, row on row,\r\n  On ponderous columns, short and low,\r\n    Built ere the art was known,\r\n  By pointed aisle, and shafted stalk,\r\n  The arcades of an alley'd walk,\r\n    To emulate in stone.'\r\n\r\nThe scenes of Sarrow and Ettrick vales, associated with the life and\r\ndescribed in the poetry of the Ettrick shepherd, deserve more attention\r\nfrom tourists than they usually receive. The single tomb in Ettrick\r\nkirkyard, the site of his birthplace near by, marked by a stone in the\r\nwall, bearing the letters J. H., Poet; Chapelhope, the scene of the\r\n'Brownie o' Bodsbeck,' 'Sweet St. Mary's Lake,' Mount Benger, and the\r\nnew monument recently erected on the shores of St. Mary's, representing\r\nthe poet seated on a rock, his plaid thrown loosely over his shoulders,\r\nand his shepherd's dog by his side--all these localities cannot fail to\r\ninterest those who know James Hogg, either by his works, or by his\r\ncharacter, so powerfully and singularly delineated in the pages of\r\n'Noctes Ambrosianæ.'\r\n\r\nBurns, the Ploughman--Scott, the Minstrel--Hogg, the Shepherd! How much\r\ndoes Scotland owe to the magic of their pens! Without them, her\r\nmountains and lakes and streams would never have known the presence of\r\nthat indefatigable, money-spending feature of modern life--the tourist;\r\nfor, without them, few indeed would be the Lions of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE TWO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We own no houses, no lots, no lands;\r\n    No dainty viands for us are spread;\r\n  By sweat of our brows, and toil of our hands,\r\n    We earn the pittance that buys us bread.\r\n  And yet we live in a grander state,\r\n    Sunbeam and I, than the millionaires\r\n  Who dine off silver or golden plate,\r\n    With liveried lacqueys behind their chairs.\r\n\r\n  We have no riches in bonds or stocks;\r\n    No bank books show, our balance to draw;\r\n  Yet we carry a safe-key, that unlocks\r\n    More treasure than Croesus ever saw.\r\n  We wear no velvets, nor satins fine;\r\n    We dress in a very homely way;\r\n  But, ah! what luminous lustres shine\r\n    About Sunbeam's gowns and my hodden gray.\r\n\r\n  When we walk together--(we do not ride,\r\n    We are far too poor)--it is very rare\r\n  We are bowed unto from the other side\r\n    Of the street--but not for this do we care.\r\n  We are not lonely; we pass along,\r\n    Sunbeam and I, and you cannot see\r\n  (We can) what tall and beautiful throng\r\n    Of angels we have for company.\r\n\r\n  No harp, no dulcimer, no guitar,\r\n    Breaks into singing at Sunbeam's touch;\r\n  But do not think that our evenings are\r\n    Without their music; there is none such\r\n  In the concert halls where the palpitant air\r\n    In musical billows floats and swims;\r\n  Our lives are as psalms, and our foreheads wear\r\n    A calm like the feel of beautiful hymns.\r\n\r\n  When cloudy weather obscures our skies,\r\n    And some days darken with drops of rain,\r\n  We have but to look in each other's eyes,\r\n    And all is balmy and bright again.\r\n  Ah! ours is the alchemy that transmutes\r\n    The dregs to elixir, the dross to gold;\r\n  And so we live on Hesperian fruits,\r\n    Sunbeam and I, and never grow old.\r\n\r\n  Never grow old: and we live in peace,\r\n    And we love our fellows, and envy none;\r\n  And our hearts are glad at the large increase\r\n    Of plenteous virtue under the sun.\r\n  And the days pass by with their thoughtful tread,\r\n    And the shadows lengthen toward the west;\r\n  But the wane of our young years brings no dread,\r\n    To break our harvest of quiet rest.\r\n\r\n  Sunbeam's hair will be streaked with gray,\r\n    And Time will furrow my darling's brow;\r\n  But never can Time's hand take away\r\n    The tender halo that clasps it now.\r\n  So we dwell in wonderful opulence,\r\n    With nothing to hurt us, nor upbraid;\r\n  And my life trembles with reverence,\r\n    And Sunbeam's spirit is not afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOTISM AND PROVINCIALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that memorable parliamentary battle between Webster and Hayne, the\r\nbroad nationalism of the former stands out in splendid contrast with the\r\nnarrow provincialism of the latter. Hayne's theme was small and\r\nsectional--it wanted bulk; hence, he continually intrudes himself in his\r\nsubject: the subject is half, and Hayne and Webster the other and more\r\nimportant half. Webster, on the contrary, is completely absorbed in the\r\nmagnitude of his subject; he forgets the very existence of such facts as\r\nWebster and Hayne, and considers only that the destinies of millions\r\nhang upon the great principles he is enunciating. Hayne is burdened with\r\nan inferior sense of personality, and never gets beyond the clouds;\r\nWebster's massive intellect shines out calm and bright as a fixed\r\nstar--far beyond the gross atmosphere of personal strife or sectional\r\nantagonism. Hayne looks through a glass dimly, and sees only South\r\nCarolina--a part; Webster, with his grand _coup d'oeil_ sweeps the\r\nhorizon, and his eagle glance takes in the entire Union as one perfect,\r\norganic whole. Hayne's logic, granting the premises, was a finished and\r\nsplendid piece of mechanism; Webster started from a deeper and broader\r\nvantage-ground of universal principle and intuitive truth, and by one\r\nterrible wrench, of his giant intellect, Hayne's premises fell from\r\nunder, and the labored superstructure of his logic went down in one\r\nconfused mass of ruin with its foundations.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks, in his late order, welcoming the return of our brave\r\nsoldiers from their two years' captivity in Texas, after recounting\r\ntheir heroic history, gives utterance to the following noble sentiment:\r\n'They refused to substitute the misguided ambition of a vulgar, low-bred\r\nprovincialism, for the hallowed hopes of a national patriotism.'\r\n\r\nA great truth, like 'a thing of beauty, is a joy forever.' We feel it as\r\nthe wine of life in our spiritual organisms, quickening thought,\r\nennobling our aims, fortifying virtue, and expanding our immortal\r\nstatures. Such a truth is contained in that pointed antithesis: 'A\r\nvulgar, low-bred provincialism, and the hallowed hopes of a national\r\npatriotism.'\r\n\r\nThe human soul, in its process of development, grows from the centre to\r\nthe circumference, from a part to the whole, from a unit to the\r\nuniverse. Its first conception is that of self-consciousness, and its\r\nfirst emotion that of self-love. As it expands its immortal germs, it\r\nbecomes conscious of its relation to objects outside of self; it seeks\r\nnew outlets of sympathy in love of parents and kindred--then of\r\npolitical communities, nations, and races; ever expanding the grand\r\ncircle of its sympathies as it grows more and more into a perfect image\r\nof the divine spirit of the universe.\r\n\r\nThis tendency of the soul to the universal is a sure index of its\r\nhighest moral and intellectual culture; it is one of the divine\r\ninstincts of our nature, and shines out as God's autograph upon the\r\ngreat representative minds of all ages. In Marcus Curtius, William Tell,\r\nGaribaldi, and our own loved Washington, it makes the cream of history\r\nand the highest poetry of nations. Its perfect manifestation is seen in\r\nthat grandest of all epics, 'Christ on the Cross,' wherein we behold a\r\nmost complete absorption of the self of the individual in the universal\r\nself of the race.\r\n\r\nThere are men with little, narrow souls, that never radiate beyond the\r\ncentre of self; they have no conception of pure, fixed, absolute\r\nprinciples, but are wholly governed by their local surroundings,\r\nprovincial prejudices, and the lower instincts of their nature. The\r\nlarge, liberal mind of the true patriot, however, can never be dwarfed\r\ndown to mere sectional standards, but, true to the law of its\r\nattraction, will ever point to the Pole-star of national unity and\r\nnational brotherhood.\r\n\r\nUniversality of soul, in the sense above adverted to, distinguishes the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race as the best government-builders of the world. England,\r\nby her subordination of the sectional to the national, by her reverence\r\nfor organic law and national unity, has survived the fiercest shocks of\r\nher civil convulsions, and built upon their ruins a more perfect and\r\nenduring fabric of government. In Southern latitudes, where the\r\ntemperament grows mercurial, and the emotional nature predominates, as\r\nin France and the Italian States, governments seem founded on _volcanic\r\nstrata_, liable to frequent and radical eruptions. In the hot Huguenot\r\nblood of South Carolina was kindled the first fatal spark that now\r\nthreatens to set our entire Union in a blaze of ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Christian draws nearer to the angels as he forgets self in the love\r\nof God and his kind; and that nation is the most prosperous, happy, and\r\npowerful that subordinates all selfish local interests, all sectional\r\nantagonisms, to the higher law of national unity and brotherhood, that\r\nholds 'the hallowed hopes of a national patriotism' as ever paramount to\r\nthe misguided ambition of a vulgar, low-bred provincialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     GALA DAYS. By GAIL HAMILTON, Author of 'Country Living and Country\r\n     Thinking.' Ticknor & Fields, Boston. For sale by D. Appleton & Co.,\r\n     New York.\r\n\r\nWho will not welcome another book from the pen of Gail Hamilton, nor\r\nname a 'gala day' indeed the one devoted to a perusal of these pleasant\r\npages? As Americans, we are very proud of Gail Hamilton. We regard her\r\nbooks as blessings to the community. We know of no familiar essays\r\ncomparable to hers; we prefer them greatly to those of Elia. Everything\r\nshe touches assumes a sudden interest, no matter how trivial in itself\r\nit may be. She pours sunshine over the pettiest details of every-day\r\nlife. We have known and felt all she tells us, lived it as life, and\r\ninstantaneously recognize it as truth; but who before has ever recorded\r\nit for us--nay, who could do it for us, save this gifted woman, who\r\naccepts all with a spirit so brave and true? How acute her analysis of\r\ncharacter! Every house has its own Halicarnassus. He is a typal man, as\r\nis shown in the fact that husbands, brothers, sons, and lovers are\r\nconstantly called 'Halicarnassus' by the ladies most closely associated\r\nwith them. Halicarnassus--tantalizing and antagonistic, slow to work and\r\nready to jeer, the plague and pest of the home hearth, but at the same\r\ntime its pride and joy, true and helpful in all real emergencies, though\r\nfull of irritating taunts and desperate indolence. Such books keep our\r\nspirits up in these days of national calamity and domestic losses. Their\r\ncharm is indescribable. Their style is sharp and brusque, but telling of\r\nwide culture; keen, but tender; clear as mountain brook, but varied and\r\nfull as a river. Gail Hamilton will write of the daily trifles of which\r\nlife is made, then boldly grapple with the highest truths; she mounts\r\nfrom the hut to the skies, and pours the light of heaven on all she\r\ntouches by the way. Humor and pathos, fun and earnestness, fiery\r\nindignation and loving charity, detailed truths and bold imaginations\r\nmeet in her singularly rich, graphic, natural, and original pages. We\r\nhave often heard fault found with them by the artificial, as fault is\r\nalways found with things fresh and natural; but for ourselves we would\r\nnot willingly lose a single line she has ever written. No affectation,\r\nno cant, no sickly feeling, no weakness, no inflation, no appealing for\r\npetty sympathy, no writing for the sake of seeming fine, does she ever\r\nindulge in. She coins words at will, for she writes from her heart and\r\nis no purist; but we feel them to be appropriate, and requisite to\r\nexpress the shade of thought in question: we may laugh at them at first,\r\nbut so natural and naive are they that we soon find them stealing into\r\nour own vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effect of such writings upon American women cannot be\r\noverestimated. They act as invigorating tonics, courses of beefsteak and\r\niron upon the somewhat too fragile loveliness, the exacting and\r\nfastidious fine-ladyism, the morbid helplessness, far too prevalent\r\namong them. Their ideal of womanhood has been wrong, narrow and\r\ncontracted, wanting in strength, breadth, and charity. Miss Muloch and\r\nGail Hamilton, while cherishing the sanctity of womanhood, are giving\r\nbroader views, higher aims, truer delicacy, and greater self-reliance to\r\ntheir plastic sex. Their lessons and examples are bracing as the sea\r\nbreeze, and soothing as air fresh from the piny mountain.\r\n\r\nGail Hamilton dares to call things by their right names; humbugs die and\r\nshams perish as her clear, deep eyes gaze upon them. She has the bravery\r\nof virtue, and battles courageously with wrong, selfishness, and\r\nweakness, though we always feel it is a woman's arm that strikes the\r\nblow, and the Halicarnassuses of earth are ready to kneel to receive\r\nit. But that she has explicitly forbidden all intrusion into her\r\nprivacy, we would say more about her. Meantime we frankly offer her our\r\nsympathy and humble admiration, our true and leal homage, our grateful\r\nappreciation of her strong, womanly, truthful, pure, and generous\r\nnature. Move on in peace, fair iconoclast of false idols, stripper of\r\ntinsel shrines, bringer of pleasant hours to the quiet home-hearth,\r\nvigorous painter of home tasks and duties; and may Halicarnassus feed\r\nupon your pungent and salty wit, drink the wine of your valiant and\r\npatriotic heart, and bask in the sunshine of your loyal and loving soul\r\nforever and ever!\r\n\r\n\r\n     OUR OLD HOME: A Series of English Sketches. By NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.\r\n     Boston: Ticknor & Fields, 1863. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New\r\n     York.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ticknor & Fields are daily doing their countrymen service by\r\npublishing good books, and thus increasing the means for promoting\r\ngeneral and solid culture. To them as well as to the gifted author are\r\ndue our thanks for this agreeable volume of truthful and instructive\r\nsketches. It is, in fact, the portfolio of a genuine artist. He tells us\r\nthat the picture to have been evolved from a combination of these\r\nfaithful outlines is now never to be completed. This is certainly to be\r\nregretted so far as artistic enjoyment is concerned; but, in regard to\r\nexact portrayal of subject matter, sketches are ofttimes more valuable,\r\nbecause more precise, than the finished work as seen through the haze of\r\nthe artist's imagination, wrought upon by the softening influences of\r\ntime, distance, and the necessary requirements of beauty in every such\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nAmericans, until recently, have been prone either to sneer\r\nindiscriminately at everything foreign, or to undervalue their own\r\ncountry and advantages, and find nothing tolerable which was not the\r\ngrowth of the eastern shore of the Atlantic. These tendencies are now,\r\nwe think, giving place to a calmer impartiality, a broader and more\r\nenlightened spirit of inquiry. Patriotism is no longer a mere matter of\r\nscoff among politicians, self-sacrifice the object of newspaper sneers,\r\n_our country_ a spread-eagle figure for a Fourth-of-July oration.\r\nAmerican men and women now know that in a good cause they can cheerfully\r\nresign fortune, and even bravely send forth to the battle field, or to\r\nthe still more fatal hospital, the dearest members of their household;\r\nand they hence feel lifted up above petty scoffs and political or\r\ncommercial jealousies. Having proven their continued manhood and\r\nwomanhood, they can look their brother men of whatever nation in the\r\nface, quietly yielding precedence where deserved, and as quietly\r\nclaiming their own dues. The spirit of Hawthorne's book is strictly in\r\naccordance with this growing feeling. Fanatics, either for or against\r\nEngland and the English, may find too much praise or too much blame; but\r\nthe impartial reader cannot fail to be impressed by the author's\r\nfairness, even by the keen-sighted appreciation of either virtues or\r\nfaults resulting from a sincere and long-seated affection.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on \"Outside Glimpses of English Poverty\" is written as if\r\nwith the heart's blood of the writer; and we may all of us ponder it\r\nwell, lest some day its graphic but melancholy outlines may only too\r\nvividly delineate the condition of our own poor. Let it teach every man\r\nof us to strive without ceasing to bridge the wide chasm almost\r\nnecessarily dividing rich and poor. Let us untiringly pour into that\r\nchasm love, pity, help, forbearance, our best of constructive thinking,\r\nbut last as well as first, love--Christian love--until vice and despair\r\nno longer find excuse in circumstance.\r\n\r\nWe are glad again to welcome within the ranks of American literature the\r\nauthor whose \"Twice-Told Tales,\" \"Manse Mosses,\" and \"Scarlet Letter\" so\r\nthrilled our youthful souls; and we hope the pressure of the times,\r\nweighing heavily upon him as upon all men of imagination who have\r\noutlived their first youth, may ere long be lifted, and his mind\r\nnaturally revert to the treatment of mystic themes he of all writers\r\nseems empowered to render dreamily interesting and suggestive.\r\n\r\n\r\n     METHODS OF STUDY IN NATURAL HISTORY. By L. AGASSIZ. Boston: Ticknor\r\n     & Fields, 1863. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a valuable work, supplying a want long felt by that class\r\nof intelligent students who, without the time or means to fathom the\r\ndepths of natural science, are yet desirous of obtaining accurate and\r\nreliable information regarding its foundation and general principles.\r\nThe public are deeply indebted to Professor Agassiz, for it is not every\r\nman of real science who is willing to step into the popular arena, throw\r\naside (in so far as possible) technicalities, and strive to impart to\r\nthe unlearned the valuable results of years of severe study,\r\nobservation, and thought. We are happy to see that the illustrious\r\nauthor enters \"an earnest protest against the transmutation theory,\r\nrevived of late with so much ability, and so generally received.\" The\r\nbook concludes thus: \"I cannot repeat too emphatically that there is not\r\na single fact in embryology to justify the assumption that the laws of\r\ndevelopment, now known to be so precise and definite for every animal,\r\nhave ever been less so, or have ever been allowed to run into each\r\nother. The philosopher's stone is no more to be found in the organic\r\nthan the inorganic world; and we shall seek as vainly to transform the\r\nlower animal types into the higher ones by any of our theories as did\r\nthe alchemists of old to change the baser metals into gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe subjects treated are: General Sketch of the Early Progress in\r\nNatural History; Nomenclature and Classification; Categories of\r\nClassification; Classification and Creation; Different Views respecting\r\nOrders; Gradation among Animals; Analogous Types; Family\r\nCharacteristics; The Characters of Genera; Species and Breeds; Formation\r\nof Coral Reefs; Age of Coral Reefs, as showing permanence of species;\r\nHomologies; Alternate Generations; The Ovarian Egg; Embryology and\r\nClassification.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SERMONS PREACHED BEFORE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES,\r\n     during his Tour in the East, in the Spring of 1862, with Notices of\r\n     some of the Localities visited. By ARTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY, D.D.,\r\n     Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the University of\r\n     Oxford; Honorary Chaplain in Ordinary to the Queen; Deputy Clerk of\r\n     the Closet; Honorary Chaplain to the Prince of Wales. Published by\r\n     Charles Scribner, 124 Grand street, New York.\r\n\r\nThese Sermons are dedicated to his Royal Highness Albert Edward, Prince\r\nof Wales, and are published at the request of the Queen of England,\r\nTheir interest depends in part on the circumstances and the occasion of\r\ntheir delivery; in part upon the charm of their own quiet, simple, and\r\nelegant style, their devout and tender spirit. The scenes in which these\r\ndiscourses were preached are among the most famous and familiar of the\r\nsacred and classical localities, the texts chosen being always in\r\naccordance with them, the sermons illustrating their history and\r\nconnecting their glorious Past with the Present of the illustrious\r\ntravellers. They were preached on the Nile, at Thebes; in Palestine, at\r\nJaffa, at Nablus, at Nazareth, at Tiberias; in Syria, at Rasheya, at\r\nBaalbec, at Ehden; on the Mediterranean, &c. Notices are appended of the\r\nspots visited during the tour of the young Prince in the East. We find\r\nin the table of contents: 'The Mosque of Hebron, The Cave of Machpelah,\r\nThe Tomb of David at Jerusalem, The Samaritan Passover, The Passover on\r\nMount Gerizim, The Antiquities of Nablus, Galilee, Cana, Tabor, The Lake\r\nof Genesareth, Safed, Kedesh-Naphtali, The Valley of the Litany, The\r\nTemples of Hermon, Baalbec, Damascus, Beirut, The Cedars of Lebanon,\r\nArvad; Patmos, its Traditions and connection with the Apocalypse.' These\r\nnotices are interesting and graphic. Places into which travellers have\r\nfound it impossible to penetrate, were rendered accessible to the heir\r\nof England's crown. The visit to the hitherto inaccessible Sanctuary,\r\nthe Mosque of Hebron--the Sanctuary, first Jewish, then Christian, now\r\nMussulman, which is supposed to cover the Cave of Machpelah, to which\r\ntheir attention had been directed by the great German geographer,\r\nRitter, and which has excited in modern times the keenest curiosity--is\r\nfull of instruction and interest. Since the time of Prince Edward and\r\nEleanor, this visit was the first paid by an heir of the crown of\r\nEngland to these sacred regions. We close our notice with a short\r\nextract from the pages of this pleasant book.\r\n\r\n'That long cavalcade, sometimes amounting to one hundred and fifty\r\npersons, of the Prince and his suite, the English servants, the troop of\r\nfifty or a hundred Turkish cavalry, their spears glittering in the sun,\r\nand their red pennons streaming in the air, as they wound their way\r\nthrough the rocks and thickets, and over the stony ridges of Syria, was\r\na sight that enlivened even the tamest landscape, and lent a new charm\r\neven to the most beautiful. Most remarkably was this felt on our first\r\nentrance into Palestine, and on our first approach to Jerusalem. The\r\nentrance of the Prince into the Holy Land was almost on the footsteps of\r\nRichard Coeur de Lion, and of Edward I, under the tower of Ramleh, and\r\nin the ruined Cathedral of St. George, at Lydda. Thence we had climbed\r\nthe pass of Joshua's victory at Bethhoron, had caught the first glimpse\r\nof Jerusalem from the top of the Mosque of the Prophet Samuel, where\r\nRichard had stood and refused to look on the Holy Sepulchre which he was\r\nnot thought worthy to rescue. Then came the full view of the Holy City\r\nfrom the northern road, the ridge of Scopus--the view immortalized in\r\nTasso's description of the first advance of the Crusaders. The cavalcade\r\nhad now swelled into a strange and motley crowd. The Turkish governor\r\nand his suite--the English consul and the English clergy--groups of\r\nuncouth Jews--Franciscan monks and Greek priests--here and there under\r\nthe clumps of trees, groups of children singing hymns--the stragglers at\r\nlast becoming a mob--the clatter of the horses' hoofs on the hard stones\r\nof that rocky and broken road drowning every other sound--such was the\r\nvaried procession, which, barbarous as it was, still seemed to contain\r\nwithin itself the representatives, or, if one will, the offscourings of\r\nall nations, and thus to combine the impressive, and, at the same time,\r\nthe grotesque and melancholy aspect which so peculiarly marks the modern\r\nJerusalem. Our tents were pitched outside the Damascus Gate, near the\r\nscene of the encampment of Godfrey de Bouillon, and from thence we\r\nexplored the city and the neighborhood.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     FREEDOM AND WAR: Discourses on Topics suggested by the Times. By\r\n     HENRY WARD BEECHER. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. For sale by D.\r\n     Appleton & Co.\r\n\r\nWe cannot more appropriately present this work to the notice of our\r\nreaders, than by quoting from the editor's introduction the following\r\npassage with regard to it: 'The title sufficiently expresses the rule by\r\nwhich the selection was made. That rule was to choose discourses on\r\nsubjects of present interest, and which, at the same time, should, as\r\nfar as possible, so handle those subjects as to have a more permanent\r\nvalue. They have also a certain significance from their order in time.\r\nNo other system will be found in the book, except a systematic purpose\r\nalways to discuss the subject apparently most important at the time. Its\r\ngeneral method is, to apply the principles of Christianity to the duties\r\nand circumstances of life; to insist on a sound and fearless Christian\r\nmorality in whatever men do; and to show the increased importance of\r\npractising that morality in times like these. It is believed that, in\r\nseeking to do this, the discourses are consistent and clear in teaching\r\nGod's almighty supremacy and his goodness and wisdom, faith in humanity\r\nand its future, the absolute necessity of national righteousness and of\r\nChristian equality, the substantial truth and excellence of the frame of\r\ngovernment of the United States, the substantial nobility and courage,\r\njustice and perseverance, of the real democracy of the country, and the\r\ncertain and ineffable splendor of our future, if only we are true to\r\nourselves, to humanity, and to God.' Few men have had such ardent and\r\ndevoted friends as Henry Ward Beecher; few such bitter and determined\r\nenemies. It were useless to tell his friends of the loyalty, patriotism,\r\nand ability of these remarkable Discourses; we heartily wish his enemies\r\ncould be persuaded to peruse them. We believe they would find the writer\r\nfar other than they deem him. We think they would find their prejudices\r\nmelting away, their dislike growing into admiration, and their own souls\r\nkindling from the fire of his ardent and broad humanity. No man's\r\nopinions have been more constantly misstated, none more generally\r\nmiscomprehended, than Mr. Beecher's. A man of large soul, of generous\r\nimpulses, he thinks as he feels, and writes as he thinks. His thoughts\r\nare original, his imagination glowing, his sympathies all-embracing, his\r\ncreed broad and flowing, his illustrations apt and graphic, his diction\r\nclear and bold, though often careless and sometimes almost grotesquely\r\nfamiliar;--all that he touches seems poured through his heart, and thus\r\nnever fails to reach the heart of his audience. He battles with the sins\r\nand evils of his time, and is perhaps as conservative as truth will\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW AND THEN.\r\n\r\nJohn Letcher, the present rebel Governor of Virginia, has lately\r\npresented himself in rather a new character by recommending in his\r\nmessage to the legislature of his State, a provision of law to pay for\r\nslaves lost by the war. When he was a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States, he was altogether incapable of\r\nappreciating any public liability to individuals. He was notorious for\r\nthe sleepless energy and vigilance with which he opposed all private\r\nclaims without regard to their merits. He seemed to set on the principle\r\nthat a valid demand against the government could not exist, and that no\r\nman who presented one could be honest.\r\n\r\nBy the rules of the House of Representatives certain days are set apart\r\ncalled 'objection days,' when the private calendar is called over, and\r\nall bills not objected to are laid by and passed without debate. Few,\r\nindeed, were the bills which, in Mr. Letcher's day, could stand this\r\nordeal. On these days he was in his glory; it was then that by the use\r\nof the magic words, 'I object,' he obtained his greatest triumphs.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, a plain old lady from a distant part of the\r\ncountry, was in the gallery looking down on the proceedings with intense\r\nanxiety. She was the unfortunate subject of a revolutionary claim, which\r\nhad long been pending without result, and by the advice of her friends\r\nshe had come all the way to Washington to give her personal exertions to\r\nits prosecution. By dint of untiring energy she had succeeded in having\r\nit passed through the Senate and sent down to the House. It had\r\nsuccessfully run the gauntlet of the House committee, and as the\r\ncalendar was now to be called, the simple-hearted old lady thought she\r\nwas at the end of her troubles. She watched the proceedings with great\r\ninterest, but soon began to show signs of apprehension and alarm at the\r\nmovements of Mr. Letcher. The clerk had been engaged for some time in\r\nreading the bills in their order, but not one of them had reached the\r\nconclusion of its reading before the fatal words, 'I object,' were heard\r\nto issue from the seat occupied by Mr. Letcher. Turning uneasily and\r\nhastily to a stranger sitting near, the good old lady with some\r\npetulance inquired, 'who is that bald-headed man that objects to all\r\nthese bills?' 'Bald, madam!' replied the gentleman, 'you're quite\r\nmistaken. He's not bald, but his hair hasn't grown any for a great many\r\nyears.' 'But who is he,' continued the old lady, 'and what makes him\r\nobject to everybody's bill.' With most provoking deliberation, the\r\ngentleman replied to the old lady's impatient queries: 'Madam, that is\r\nJohn Letcher; he is a Virginia gentleman, of one of the very first\r\nfamilies.' 'But what makes him object, I want to know that.' 'Madam,'\r\nreplied the gentleman, 'the peculiarity you mention is connected with a\r\nmost extraordinary fact in his history; you would indeed be surprised to\r\nlearn it.' 'Do pray tell me what it is, now won't you, sir?' 'He can't\r\nhelp it, madam; he's obliged to object. It is a necessity imposed upon\r\nhim from his birth.' 'La, mister, do pray tell me what it is. I'm dying\r\nto know.' 'Well, madam, you see now, this is objection day; Mr. Letcher\r\nwas born on objection day; he objected to being born on that day; but\r\nthis objection was unanimously overruled, and he became so enraged, that\r\nhe has objected to everything from that day to this.' Just at this\r\nmoment, the clerk read in a loud, clear voice: 'Number ----, a bill for\r\nthe relief of ----.' The old lady turned away from the stranger as she\r\nheard her own name called, just in time to see Mr. Letcher rise and\r\nutter the inevitable words 'Mr. Chairman, I object.'\r\n\r\nThe old lady sank back in her seat and covered her face with a red\r\nhandkerchief. The stranger gentleman leaned over sympathizingly, and\r\nsaid in a low voice, 'Madam, the first time his mother attempted to comb\r\nhis hair, he objected to having any hair; and now you see the\r\nconsequence.'\r\n\r\nBut the old lady was not to be defeated. She called on Mr. Letcher every\r\nday, from that time till the next objection day; and when her bill was\r\nabout to be called, Mr. Letcher took his hat and walked out of the\r\nHouse. The same gentleman happened to be present; he stepped up to the\r\nold lady and said: 'Madam, Mr. Letcher is now about to take the only\r\nthing he never objected to--he's gone to take a drink.'\r\n\r\nThe truth is Mr. Letcher objected to seeing the old lady again. She had\r\npromised to visit him daily until her bill passed; and the force of this\r\nobjection overcame the other; and so the bill which had been defeated by\r\nan objection, was now passed on account of one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PINE.\r\n\r\n    The Pine--the Pine--the mighty Pine--\r\n      The everliving--evergreen;\r\n    That boldly cleaves the broad sunshine,\r\n      Towering high with scornful mien;\r\n  And smileth not in summer's gladness,\r\n  And sigheth not 'mid winter's sadness;\r\n          Shedding no tear\r\n          O'er the dying year,\r\n      But groweth still bright,\r\n        And touched by no sorrow,\r\n      For he feareth no night,\r\n        And hopeth no morrow.\r\n\r\n    The proud--the cold--the mountain Pine,\r\n      The tempest driven--tempest torn--\r\n    That grandly o'er the wildwood line\r\n      The forest banner long has borne;\r\n  And he waileth never the waning flower,\r\n  For he knows no death but the storm-cloud's power.\r\n          Could he have grief\r\n          For a passing leaf?\r\n      So strong in his might,\r\n        Touched by no sorrow,\r\n      Fearing no night\r\n        And hoping no morrow.\r\n\r\n  _By the Rappahannock_,\r\n  August 7, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those hot days in summer, when life is rather emotional\r\nthan operative, and will lies locked in the ecstasy of sense. For a week\r\nthe heat had been incessant, and now at early morning the thermometer\r\nstood at 96 in the shade. We were a party of loungers thrown together by\r\nchance, in a small town of western Maryland, united in nothing but a\r\ndesire to escape the heat. The town lay in a little basin scooped out\r\namong circling mountains, which were veiled in almost perpetual\r\nvapors;--but this morning the vapors had parted, wreathing the mountains\r\nin light, delicately tinted circles, and disclosing a clear, glowing\r\nsky. To the east rose Table Rock, a black, frowning bowlder, resting, a\r\nmile and a half up the mountain, on a base so narrow, it seemed a breeze\r\nwould rock it into perilous motion; while to the southwest, lay\r\nFairmount, serene, stately, sloping upward with a symmetry which\r\narchitecture might vainly emulate. We determined upon an excursion to\r\nthe latter, and mounted our horses for the six-and-a-half miles ride.\r\nThe road was macadamized, and worn so firm and level, it reminded me,\r\nconstantly, of the stone walks in a granite quarry. Among our party was\r\na young man just returned from Europe surfeited with scenery and\r\nsight-seeing, but for the rest, we were commonplace Americans, eager to\r\nsee everything, and ready to go into ecstasies over everything which we\r\nsaw. It was in early July, and the foliage had not yet wilted from its\r\nmoist, bright greenness; the atmosphere was a wave of light, and the\r\nearth seemed no longer dust, dross, and atoms of decay, but surcharged\r\nand palpitating with sunshine. A dead calm pervaded the air, not a leaf\r\nfluttered, not a blade bent; nature was in a trance of heat and light.\r\nAs we ascended the mountains, we were sensible of a slight motion in the\r\nvapors, and a cool murmur in the trees; it was the first breath of the\r\nmountain air, swelling as we advanced to a spicy, exhilarating breeze.\r\nThe sea air is certainly more bracing, but I never experienced anything\r\nso soothing, as that wind wafted from cool mountain recesses. We left\r\nour horses at the inn, and proceeded on foot to the summit. We were on\r\none of the peaks of the Alleghanies, looking down into a valley, which,\r\nbelow, had appeared enclosed by mountains, but now disclosed a broad\r\nopening to the south, while eastward ran the Blue Ridge, so wrapped and\r\nsublimated by azure mists, that it seemed a line of cloud mountains\r\nprojected against the dazzling sky. As far as the eye could reach, the\r\nvalley was a Paradise, so soft and delicate in its exuberant verdure,\r\nthat the eye pained by the splendor of sky and air, was soothed without\r\nany cessation of delight; through its midst ran the Potomac, always\r\nlimpid, but under this burning sun of a silvery brightness, shaded and\r\nmellowed by the foliage around. The wind, which we found so grateful,\r\nhad increased steadily till it blew in strong gusts--a dense cloud\r\nspread over the west--while in the east, the sky faded to a chalky\r\nwhiteness, low thunders muttered in the mountains, and faint shudders\r\ncrept through the leaves; a line of fire curled up over the cloud, and\r\nin an instant, so vivid and swift were the electric bursts, the air\r\nseemed sheeted in flames. In a long residence on both lake and sea shore\r\nI remember no transition so startling, as this from a loveliness which\r\nwas beatific to a tempest which was appalling. But the storm was as\r\nbrief as its coming had been sudden, and, as the sun shone out over the\r\ndripping foliage, each leaf and blade reflected bright colors through\r\nits prismatic drops, the distant trees gleaming like sea spray in the\r\nlight. As we looked through purple vapors, floating from the purple\r\nheights of shadowy mountains, the window seemed mirroring the sensuous\r\nsplendors of an Italian landscape. In descending to the valley, we took\r\na winding road which led farther up toward the heart of the range. Here\r\nwere gorges opening up through the mountains, which baffle all\r\ndescription, and before which Art must despair. Such grouping! such\r\nluxury! so blended and irradiated with gossamer mists, it seemed easy to\r\nfancy, that in their depths lay hidden the happy fields of Pan. It is in\r\nthese mists which harmonize contrasts, in these tremulous motions which\r\nconceal angles and abruptness, that nature defies art; the subtlest art\r\nmay suggest, but cannot reproduce them. As we stopped, for a moment, at\r\nthe foot of the mountain, and looked up through the fragrant air to the\r\nsunset sky, and forward into the valley, mantling with slumbrous shade,\r\nour young friend from Europe exclaimed, 'I have seen to-day, what I had\r\nnever expected to see in America,--mountains as picturesque as those of\r\nWales, and a sky mellow and brilliant as that of Italy.' For me, I could\r\nnot help but feel that in American scenery lies the hope of American\r\nartists, and that the artist to whom Rome is denied, may receive even\r\nfuller inspiration from the sea and skies and heights of his native\r\nland! This was in 1859. There was then no token or presage of that other\r\nJuly day, when, under the very shadow of these mountains, an army\r\nthrilled with heroic impulse; when men, whose whole lives had been\r\nignoble, redeemed them by the most sublime daring; and those whose lives\r\nheld every promise yielded them with the most patriotic devotion; and\r\nthrough long sultry hours, men cheerfully endured the tortures of\r\nthirst, of wounds, and of lonely death agonies, sustained by a\r\nprescience of victory. Thus was the scene, which nature had made\r\nenchanting, rendered historic and immortal.\r\n\r\n  A. J.

No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfirst established, it has during that time acquired a strength and a\r\npolitical significance elevating it to a position far above that\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America. In proof\r\nof which, assertion we call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a single one\r\nhas had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six thousand_\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among the\r\nPines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary popularity_;\r\nand its conductors are determined that it shall not fall behind.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its circle of\r\naction, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle involved in\r\nthe great questions of the day. The first minds of the country,\r\nembracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,         Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,       Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,         Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,      Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,      Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n  PAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n  _Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n  SINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\n  Three dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147 miles\r\nby the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are produced\r\nin great abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre. with interest at 5 per ct. annually on the\r\n    following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash Payment                           $48 00\r\n  Payment in one year                     48 00\r\n     \"    in two years                    48 00\r\n     \"    in three years                  48 00\r\n     \"    in four years                  236 00\r\n     \"    in five years                  224 00\r\n     \"    in six years                   212 00\r\n     \"    in seven years                 200 00\r\n\r\n  40 acres at $10 00 per acre;\r\n  Cash payment                           $24 00\r\n  Payment in one year                     24 00\r\n     \"    in two years                    24 00\r\n     \"    in three years                  24 00\r\n     \"    in four years                  118 00\r\n     \"    in five years                  112 00\r\n     \"    in six years                   106 00\r\n     \"    in seven years                 100 00\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  Number 24. 25 Cents.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL\r\n\r\nMONTHLY.\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO\r\n\r\nLiterature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1863.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n  JOHN F.
