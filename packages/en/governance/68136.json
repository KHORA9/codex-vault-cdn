This is the heart\r\nof what may be called the Old West, which we now call the Middle West,\r\nusing the term to denote that great group of rich and powerful States\r\nwhich literally forms the heart of the country. It is a region whose\r\npeople are distinctively American in all their thoughts, in all their\r\nways of looking at life; and in its past and its present alike it is\r\ntypical of our country. The oldest men present can still remember the\r\npioneer days, the days of the white-tilted ox wagon, of the emigrant,\r\nand of the log cabin in which that emigrant first lived when he settled\r\nto his task as a pioneer farmer. They were rough days, days of hard\r\nwork, and the people who did that work seemed themselves uncouth and\r\nforbidding to visitors who could not look below the surface. It is\r\ncurious and amusing to think that even as genuine a lover of his kind,\r\na man normally so free from national prejudices as Charles Dickens,\r\nshould have selected the region where we are now standing as the seat\r\nof his forlorn “Eden” in Martin Chuzzlewit. The country he so bitterly\r\nassailed is now one of the most fertile and productive portions of\r\none of the most fertile and productive agricultural territories\r\nin all the world, and the dwellers in this territory represent a\r\nhigher average of comfort, intelligence, and sturdy capacity for\r\nself-government than the people in any tract of like extent in any\r\nother continent. The land teems with beauty and fertility, and but a\r\nscore of years after Dickens wrote it was shown to be a nursery and\r\nbreeding ground of heroes, of soldiers and statesmen of the highest\r\nrank, while the rugged worth of the rank and file of the citizenship\r\nrendered possible the deeds of the mighty men who led in council and in\r\nbattle. This was the region that brought forth mighty Abraham Lincoln,\r\nthe incarnation of all that is best in democratic life; and from the\r\nloins of the same people, living only a little farther south, sprang\r\nanother of our greatest Presidents, Andrew Jackson, “Old Hickory”――a\r\nman who made mistakes, like most strong men, but a man of iron will\r\nand incorruptible integrity, fearless, upright, devoted to the welfare\r\nof his countrymen, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, a typical\r\nAmerican if ever there was one.\r\n\r\nI commend a careful reading of Martin Chuzzlewit to the pessimists of\r\nto-day, to the men who, instead of fighting hard to do away with abuses\r\nwhile at the same time losing no jot of their buoyant hopefulness for\r\nthe country, insist that all our people, socially and industrially, in\r\ntheir private lives no less than as politicians, newspaper men, and\r\nbusiness men, are at a lower ebb than ever before. If ever any one\r\nof you feels a little downcast over the peculiarly gloomy view of the\r\npresent taken by some well-meaning pessimist of to-day, you will find\r\nit a real comfort to read Martin Chuzzlewit, to see what a well-meaning\r\npessimist of the past thought of our people sixty-five years ago; and\r\nthen think of the extraordinary achievement, the extraordinary gain,\r\nmorally no less than materially, of those sixty-five years. Dickens\r\ncan be read by us now with profit; Elijah Pogram, Hannibal Chollop,\r\nJefferson Brick and Scadder have their representatives to-day, plenty\r\nof them; and the wise thing for us to do is to recognize that these\r\nare still types of evil in politics, journalism, business, and private\r\nlife, and to war against them with all our hearts. But it is rank folly\r\nto regard these as the only, or the chief, types in our national life.\r\nIt was not of much consequence whether Dickens made such an error or\r\nnot, but it would be of great consequence if we ourselves did; for a\r\nfoolish pessimism is an even greater foe of healthy national growth\r\nthan a foolish optimism. It was not that Dickens invented characters\r\nor scenes that had no basis in fact; on the contrary, what he said was\r\ntrue, as far as it went; the trouble was that out of many such half\r\ntruths he made a picture which as a whole was absurd; for often a half\r\ntruth is the most dangerous falsehood. It would be simply silly to be\r\nangry over Martin Chuzzlewit; on the contrary, read it, be amused\r\nby it, profit by it; and don’t be misled by it. Keep a lively watch\r\nagainst the present-day Pograms and Bricks; but above all, distrust\r\nthe man who would persuade you to feel downhearted about the country\r\nbecause of these same Pograms and Bricks, past or present. It would be\r\nfoolish to ignore their existence, or the existence of anything else\r\nthat is bad in our national life; but it would be even more foolish\r\nto ignore the vaster forces that tell for righteousness. Friends,\r\nthere is every reason why we should fight whatever is evil in the\r\npresent. But there is also every reason why we should feel a sturdy and\r\nconfident hope for the future. There are many wrongs to right; there\r\nare many and powerful wrong doers against whom to war; and it would be\r\nbase to shrink from the contest, or to fail to wage it with a high, a\r\nresolute will. But I am sure that we shall win in the contest, because\r\nI know that the heart of our people is sound. Our average men and women\r\nare good men and women――and this is true in all sections of our country\r\nand among all classes of our countrymen. There is no other nation on\r\nearth with such vast natural resources, or with such a high standard\r\nof living and of industrial efficiency among its workers. We have as\r\na nation an era of unexampled prosperity ahead of us; we shall enjoy\r\nit, and our children will enjoy it after us. The trend of well-being\r\nin this country is upward, not downward; and this is the trend in the\r\nthings of the soul as well as in the things of the body.\r\n\r\nGovernment in its application is often a complicated and delicate\r\nwork, but the principles of government are, after all, fairly simple.\r\nIn a broad general way we should apply in the affairs of the national\r\nadministration, which deals with the interests of all our eighty-odd\r\nmillions of people, just the same rules that are necessary in getting\r\non with our neighbors in our several neighborhoods; and the nation as a\r\nwhole should show substantially the same qualities that we would expect\r\nan honorable man to show in dealing with his fellows. To illustrate\r\nthis, consider for a moment two phases of governmental action.\r\n\r\nFirst as to international affairs. Among your own neighbors, among your\r\nfriends, what is the attitude you like to see a man take toward his\r\nfellows, the attitude you wish each of your sons to take when he goes\r\nout into the world? Is it not a combination of readiness and ability\r\nto hold his own if anyone tries to wrong him, while at the same time\r\nshowing careful regard not only for the rights but for the feelings of\r\nothers? Of course it is! Of course the type of man whom we respect,\r\nwhom we are proud of if he is a kinsman, whom we are glad to have as a\r\nfriend and neighbor, is the man who is no milksop, who is not afraid,\r\nwho will not tolerate nor hesitate to resent insult or injury, but\r\nwho himself never inflicts insult or injury, is kindly, good-natured,\r\nthoughtful of others’ rights――in short, a good man to do business with\r\nor have live in the next house or have as a friend. On the other hand,\r\nthe man who lacks any of those qualities is sure to be objectionable.\r\nIf a man is afraid to hold his own, if he will submit tamely to\r\nwrongdoing, he is contemptible. If he is a bully, an oppressor, a man\r\nwho wrongs or insults others, he is even worse and should be hunted\r\nout of the community. But, on the whole, the most contemptible position\r\nthat can possibly be assumed by any man is that of blustering, of\r\nbragging, of insulting or wronging other people, while yet expecting to\r\ngo through life unchallenged, and being always willing to back down and\r\naccept humiliation if readiness to make good is demanded.\r\n\r\nWell, all this is just as true of a nation as of an individual, and\r\nin dealing with other nations we should act as we expect a man who\r\nis both game and decent to act in private life. There are few things\r\ncheaper and more objectionable, whether on the part of the public man\r\nor of the private man, on the part of a writer or of a speaker, an\r\nindividual or a group of individuals, than a course of conduct which\r\nis insulting or hurtful, whether in speech or act, to individuals\r\nof another nation or to the representatives of another nation or to\r\nanother nation itself. But the policy becomes infamous from the\r\nstandpoint of the interests of the United States when it is combined\r\nwith the refusal to take those measures of preparation which can alone\r\nsecure us from aggression on the part of others. The policy of “peace\r\nwith insult” is the very worst policy upon which it is possible to\r\nembark, whether for a nation or an individual. To be rich, unarmed, and\r\nyet insolent and aggressive, is to court well-nigh certain disaster.\r\nThe only safe and honorable rule of foreign policy for the United\r\nStates is to show itself courteous toward other nations, scrupulous not\r\nto infringe upon their rights, and yet able and ready to defend its\r\nown. This nation is now on terms of the most cordial good will with all\r\nother nations. Let us make it a prime object of our policy to preserve\r\nthese conditions. To do so it is necessary on the one hand to mete out\r\na generous justice to all other peoples and show them courtesy and\r\nrespect; and on the other hand, as we are yet a good way off from the\r\nmillenium, to keep ourselves in such shape as to make it evident to\r\nall men that we desire peace because we think it is just and right and\r\nnot from motives of weakness or timidity. As for the first requisite,\r\nthis means that not only the Government but the people as a whole shall\r\nact in the needed spirit; for otherwise the folly of a few individuals\r\nmay work lasting discredit to the whole nation. The second requisite\r\nis more easily secured――let us build up and maintain at the highest\r\npoint of efficiency the United States Navy. In any great war on land\r\nwe should have to rely in the future as we have relied in the past\r\nchiefly upon volunteer soldiers; and although it is indispensable that\r\nour little army, an army ludicrously small relatively to the wealth\r\nand population of this mighty nation, should itself be trained to the\r\nhighest point and should be valued and respected as is demanded by\r\nthe worth of the officers and enlisted men, yet it is not necessary\r\nthat this army should be large as compared to the armies of other\r\ngreat nations. But as regards the Navy all this is different. We have\r\nan enormous coast line, and our coast line is on two great oceans.\r\nTo repel hostile attacks the fortifications, and not the Navy, must\r\nbe used; but the best way to parry is to hit――no fight can ever be\r\nwon except by hitting――and we can only hit by means of the Navy. It\r\nis utterly impossible to improvise even a makeshift navy under the\r\nconditions of modern warfare. Since the days of Napoleon no war between\r\ntwo great powers has lasted as long as it would take to build a battle\r\nship, let alone a fleet of battle ships; and it takes just as long to\r\ntrain the crew of a battle ship as it does to build it; and as regards\r\nthe most important thing of all, the training of the officers, it takes\r\nmuch longer. The Navy must be built and all its training given in time\r\nof peace. When once war has broken out it is too late to do anything.\r\nWe now have a good Navy, not yet large enough for our needs, but of\r\nexcellent material. Where a navy is as small as ours, the cardinal\r\nrule must be that the battle ships shall not be separated. This year\r\nI am happy to say that we shall begin a course which I hope will be\r\nsteadily followed hereafter, that, namely, of keeping the battle-ship\r\nfleet alternately in the Pacific and in the Atlantic. Early in December\r\nthe fleet will begin its voyage to the Pacific, and it will number,\r\nfriends, among its formidable fighting craft three great battle\r\nships, named, respectively, the _Illinois_, the _Missouri_, and the\r\n_Kentucky_. It is a national fleet in every sense of the term, and its\r\nwelfare should be, and I firmly believe is, as much a matter of pride\r\nand concern for every man in the farthest interior of our country as\r\nfor every man on the seacoast. A long ocean voyage is mighty good\r\ntraining; and not the least good it will do will be to show just the\r\npoints where our naval program needs strengthening. Incidentally I\r\nthink the voyage will have one good effect, for, to judge by their\r\ncomments on the movement, some excellent people in my own section of\r\nthe country need to be reminded that the Pacific coast is exactly as\r\nmuch a part of this nation as the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nSo much for foreign affairs. Now for a matter of domestic policy.\r\nHere in this country we have founded a great federal democratic\r\nrepublic. It is a government by and for the people and therefore a\r\ngenuine democracy; and the theory of our Constitution is that each\r\nneighborhood shall be left to deal with the things that concern\r\nonly itself and which it can most readily deal with; so that town,\r\ncounty, city, and State have their respective spheres of duty, while\r\nthe nation deals with those matters which concern all of us, all of\r\nthe people, no matter where we dwell. Our democracy is based upon\r\nthe belief that each individual ought to have the largest measure\r\nof liberty compatible with securing the rights of other individuals,\r\nthat the average citizen, the plain man whom we meet in daily life,\r\nis normally capable of taking care of his own affairs, and has no\r\ndesire to wrong any one else; and yet that in the interest of all there\r\nshall be sufficient power lodged somewhere to prevent wicked people\r\nfrom trampling the weak under foot for their own gain. Our constant\r\nendeavor is to make a good working compromise whereby we shall secure\r\nthe full benefit of individual initiative and responsibility, while at\r\nthe same time recognizing that it is the function of a wise government\r\nunder modern conditions not merely to protect life and property, but\r\nto foster the social development of the people so far as this may be\r\ndone by maintaining and promoting justice, honesty, and equal rights.\r\nWe believe in a real, not a sham, democracy. We believe in democracy\r\nas regards political rights, as regards education, and, finally, as\r\nregards industrial conditions. By democracy we understand securing, as\r\nfar as it is humanly possible to secure it, equality of opportunity,\r\nequality of the conditions under which each man is to show the stuff\r\nthat is in him and to achieve the measure of success to which his own\r\nforce of mind and character entitle him. Religiously this means that\r\neach man is to have the right, unhindered by the state, to worship his\r\nCreator as his conscience dictates, granting freely to others the\r\nsame freedom which he asks for himself. Politically we can be said\r\nsubstantially to have worked out our democratic ideals, and the same\r\nis true, thanks to the common schools, in educational matters. But in\r\nindustry there has not as yet been the governmental growth necessary\r\nin order to meet the tremendous changes brought about in industrial\r\nconditions by steam and electricity. It is not in accordance with our\r\nprinciples that literally despotic power should be put into the hands\r\nof a few men in the affairs of the industrial world. Our effort must\r\nbe for a just and effective plan of action which, while scrupulously\r\nsafeguarding the rights of the men of wealth, shall yet, so far as\r\nis humanly possible, secure under the law to all men equality of\r\nopportunity to make a living. It is to the interest of all of us that\r\nthe man of exceptional business capacity should be amply rewarded;\r\nand there is nothing inconsistent with this in our insistence that he\r\nshall not be guilty of bribery or extortion, and that the rights of\r\nthe wageworker and of the man of small means, who are themselves honest\r\nand hard working, shall be scrupulously safeguarded. The instruments\r\nfor the exercise of modern industrial power are the great corporations\r\nwhich, though created by the individual States, have grown far beyond\r\nthe control of those States and transact their business throughout\r\nlarge sections of the Union. These corporations, like the industrial\r\nconditions which have called them into being, did not exist when the\r\nConstitution was founded; but the wise forethought of the founders\r\nprovided, under the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution,\r\nfor the very emergency which has arisen, if only our people as a whole\r\nwill realize what this emergency is; for if the people thoroughly\r\nrealize it, their governmental representatives will soon realize\r\nit also. The National Government alone has sufficiently extensive\r\npower and jurisdiction to exercise adequate control over the great\r\ninterstate corporations. While this thorough supervision and control\r\nby the National Government is desirable primarily in the interest of\r\nthe people, it will also, I firmly believe, be to the benefit of those\r\ncorporations themselves which desire to be honest and law-abiding. Only\r\nthus can we put over these corporations one competent and efficient\r\nsovereign――the Nation――able both to exact justice from them and to\r\nsecure justice for them, so that they may not be alternately pampered\r\nand oppressed. The proposal need be dreaded only by those corporations\r\nwhich do not wish to obey the law or to be controlled in just fashion,\r\nbut prefer to take their chances under the present lack of all system\r\nand to court the chance of getting improper favors as offsetting the\r\nchance of being blackmailed――an attitude rendered familiar in the past\r\nby those corporations which had thriven under certain corrupt and\r\nlawless city governments.\r\n\r\nThe first need is to exercise this Federal control in thoroughgoing\r\nand efficient fashion over the railroads, which, because of their\r\npeculiar position, offer the most immediate and urgent problem. The\r\nAmerican people abhor a vacuum, and is determined that this control\r\nshall be exercised somewhere; it is most unwise for the railroads not\r\nto recognize this and to submit to it as the first requisite of the\r\nsituation. When this control is exercised in some such fashion as it is\r\nnow exercised over the national banks, there will be no falling off\r\nin business prosperity. On the contrary, the chances for the average\r\nman to do better will be increased. Undoubtedly there will be much\r\nless opportunity than at present for a very few individuals not of the\r\nmost scrupulous type to amass great fortunes by speculating in and\r\nmanipulating securities which are issued without any kind of control or\r\nsupervision. But there will be plenty of room left for ample legitimate\r\nreward for business genius, while the chance for the man who is not\r\na business genius, but who is a good, thrifty, hard-working citizen,\r\nwill be better. I do not believe that our efforts will have anything\r\nbut a beneficial effect upon the permanent prosperity of the country;\r\nand, as a matter of fact, even as regards any temporary effect, I\r\nthink that any trouble is due fundamentally not to the fact that the\r\nnational authorities have discovered and corrected certain abuses, but\r\nto the fact that those abuses were there to be discovered. I think\r\nthat the excellent people who have complained of our policy as hurting\r\nbusiness have shown much the same spirit as the child who regards the\r\ndentist and not the ulcerated tooth as the real source of his woe. I\r\nam as certain as I can be of anything that the course we are pursuing\r\nwill ultimately help business; for the corrupt man of business is as\r\ngreat a foe to this country as the corrupt politician. Both stand on\r\nthe same evil eminence of infamy. Against both it is necessary to war;\r\nand if, unfortunately, in either type of warfare, a few innocent people\r\nare hurt, the responsibility lies not with us, but with those who have\r\nmisled them to their hurt.\r\n\r\nThis is a rapidly growing nation, on a new continent, and in an era of\r\nnew, complex, and ever-shifting conditions. Often it is necessary to\r\ndevise new methods of meeting these new conditions. We must regard the\r\npast, but we must not regard only the past. We must also think of the\r\nfuture; and while we must learn by experience, we can not afford to pay\r\nheed merely to the teachings of experience. The great preacher Channing\r\nin his essay on “The Union” spoke with fine insight on this very point.\r\nIn commenting on the New England statesman Cabot, whom he greatly\r\nadmired, he said that nevertheless “he had too much of the wisdom of\r\nexperience; he wanted what may be called the wisdom of hope.” He then\r\ncontinued in words which have a peculiar fitness for the conditions of\r\nto-day: “We apprehend that it is possible to make experience too much\r\nour guide. There are seasons in human affairs, of inward and outward\r\nrevolution, when new depths seem to be broken up in the soul, when\r\nnew wants are unfolded in multitudes, and a new and undefined good is\r\nthirsted for. These are periods when the principles of experience need\r\nto be modified, when hope and trust and instinct claim a share with\r\nprudence in the guidance of affairs, when in truth _to dare_ is the\r\nhighest wisdom.”\r\n\r\nThese sentences should be carefully pondered by those men, often very\r\ngood men, who forget that constructive change offers the best method of\r\navoiding destructive change; that reform is the antidote to revolution;\r\nand that social reform is not the precursor but the preventive of\r\nsocialism.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n ――Text in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\n ――Archaic and variable spelling has been preserved.\r\n\r\n ――Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved.",
