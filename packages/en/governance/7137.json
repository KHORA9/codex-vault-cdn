This is perhaps the first question\r\nfor proper consideration.  You and we are different races.  We have\r\nbetween us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two\r\nraces.  Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss; but this\r\nphysical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think.\r\nYour race suffers very greatly, many of them by living among us, while\r\nours suffers from your presence.  In a word we suffer on each side.  If\r\nthis is admitted, it affords a reason, at least, why we should be\r\nseparated.  You here are Freemen, I suppose?\r\n\r\n\"A VOICE--Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\"THE PRESIDENT--Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives.\r\nYour race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on\r\nany people.  But even when you cease to be Slaves, you are yet far\r\nremoved from being placed on an equality with the White race.  You are\r\ncut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoys.  The\r\naspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free; but on\r\nthis broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of\r\na single man of ours.  Go where you are treated the best, and the ban is\r\nstill upon you.  I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as\r\na fact, with which we have to deal.  I cannot alter it if I would.  It\r\nis a fact about which we all think and feel alike, I and you.  We look\r\nto our condition.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the existence of the two races on this continent, I need not\r\nrecount to you the effects upon White men, growing out of the\r\ninstitution of Slavery.  I believe in its general evil effects on the\r\nWhite race.  See our present condition--the Country engaged in War!  our\r\nwhite men cutting one another's throats--none knowing how far it will\r\nextend--and then consider what we know to be the truth.  But for your\r\nrace among us there could not be War, although many men engaged on\r\neither side do not care for you one way or the other.  Nevertheless, I\r\nrepeat, without the institution of Slavery, and the Colored race as a\r\nbasis, the War could not have an existence.  It is better for us both,\r\ntherefore, to be separated.\r\n\r\n\"I know that there are Free men among you who, even if they could better\r\ntheir condition, are not as much inclined to go out of the Country as\r\nthose who, being Slaves, could obtain their Freedom on this condition.\r\nI suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization\r\nis that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be\r\nadvanced by it.  You may believe that you can live in Washington, or\r\nelsewhere in the United States, the remainder of your life; perhaps more\r\nso than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the\r\nconclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a\r\nforeign country.\r\n\r\n\"This is, (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the\r\ncase.  But you ought to do something to help those who are not so\r\nfortunate as yourselves.  There is an unwillingness on the part of our\r\nPeople, harsh as it may be, for you free Colored people to remain with\r\nus.  Now if you could give a start to the White people you would open a\r\nwide door for many to be made free.  If we deal with those who are not\r\nfree at the beginning, and whose intellects are clouded by Slavery, we\r\nhave very poor material to start with.\r\n\r\n\"If intelligent Colored men, such as are before me, could move in this\r\nmatter, much might be accomplished.  It is exceedingly important that we\r\nhave men at the beginning capable of thinking as White men, and not\r\nthose who have been systematically oppressed.  There is much to\r\nencourage you.\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your\r\npresent comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the\r\nWhite people.  It is a cheering thought throughout life, that something\r\ncan be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject\r\nto the hard usages of the World.  It is difficult to make a man\r\nmiserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to\r\nthe great God who made him.\r\n\r\n\"In the American Revolutionary War, sacrifices were made by men engaged\r\nin it, but they were cheered by the future.  General Washington himself\r\nendured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British\r\nsubject, yet he was a happy man, because he was engaged in benefiting\r\nhis race, in doing something for the children of his neighbors, having\r\nnone of his own.\r\n\r\n\"The Colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time.  In a certain\r\nsense it is a success.  The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just\r\nbeen with me the first time I ever saw him.  He says they have, within\r\nthe bounds of that Colony, between three and four hundred thousand\r\npeople, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island, or\r\nDelaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our\r\nlarger ones.  They are not all American colonists or their descendants.\r\nSomething less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this Country.\r\nMany of the original settlers have died, yet, like people elsewhere,\r\ntheir offspring outnumber those deceased.\r\n\r\n\"The question is, if the Colored people are persuaded to go anywhere,\r\nwhy not there?  One reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of\r\nyou would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity.  I\r\ndo not know how much attachment you may have toward our race.  It does\r\nnot strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them.  But still\r\nyou are attached to them at all events.\r\n\r\n\"The place I am thinking about having for a colony, is in Central\r\nAmerica.  It is nearer to us than Liberia--not much more than one-fourth\r\nas far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by steamers.  Unlike\r\nLiberia, it is a great line of travel--it is a highway.  The country is\r\na very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources\r\nand advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with\r\nyour native soil, thus being suited to your physical condition.\r\n\r\n\"The particular place I have in view, is to be a great highway from the\r\nAtlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular\r\nplace has all the advantages for a colony.  On both sides there are\r\nharbors among the finest in the World.  Again, there is evidence of very\r\nrich coal mines.  A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country.\r\nWhy I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an\r\nopportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get\r\nready to settle permanently in their homes.\r\n\r\n\"If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad\r\nshow; and so, where there is nothing to cultivate, and of which to make\r\na farm.  But if something is started so that you can get your daily\r\nbread as soon as you reach there, it is a great advantage.  Coal land is\r\nthe best thing I know of, with which to commence an enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"To return--you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a\r\nspeculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the\r\ncountry, including the coal mines.  We have been mistaken all our\r\nlives if we do not know Whites, as well as Blacks, look to their\r\nself-interest.  Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody you\r\ntrade with makes something.  You meet with these things here and\r\neverywhere.  If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the\r\nquestion is, whether it cannot be made of advantage to you?\r\n\r\n\"You are intelligent, and know that success does not as much depend on\r\nexternal help, as on self-reliance.  Much, therefore, depends upon\r\nyourselves.  As to the coal mines, I think I see the means available for\r\nyour self-reliance.  I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you\r\nengaged, have provision made that you shall not be wronged.  If you will\r\nengage in the enterprise, I will spend some of the money intrusted to\r\nme.  I am not sure you will succeed.  The Government may lose the money,\r\nbut we cannot succeed unless we try; but we think, with care, we can\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n\"The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as\r\nsatisfactory condition as I wish.  There are contending factions in that\r\nquarter; but it is true, all the factions are agreed alike on the\r\nsubject of colonization, and want it; and are more generous than we are\r\nhere.  To your Colored race they have no objection.  Besides, I would\r\nendeavor to have you made equals, and have the best assurance that you\r\nshould be the equals of the best.\r\n\r\n\"The practical thing I want to ascertain is, whether I can get a number\r\nof able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to\r\ngo, when I present evidence of encouragement and protection.  Could I\r\nget a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children,\r\nand able to 'cut their own fodder' so to speak?  Can I have fifty?  If I\r\ncould find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and\r\nchildren--good things in the family relation, I think I could make a\r\nsuccessful commencement.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.  This is the\r\npractical part of my wish to see you.  These are subjects of very great\r\nimportance--worthy of a month's study, of a speech delivered in an hour.\r\nI ask you, then, to consider seriously, not as pertaining to yourselves\r\nmerely, nor for your race, and ours, for the present time, but as one of\r\nthe things, if successfully managed, for the good of mankind--not\r\nconfined to the present generation, but as:\r\n\r\n              \"From age to age descends the lay\r\n               To millions yet to be,\r\n               Till far its echoes roll away\r\n               Into eternity.\"'\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's well-meant colored colonization project, however,\r\nfell through, owing partly to opposition to it in Central America, and\r\npartly to the very natural and deeply-rooted disinclination of the\r\nColored free men to leave the land of their birth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, limited Military Emancipation of Slaves was announced and\r\nregulated, on the 22d July, 1862, by the following Executive\r\nInstructions, which were issued from the War Department by order of the\r\nPresident--the issue of which was assigned by Jefferson Davis as one\r\nreason for his Order of August 1, 1862, directing \"that the commissioned\r\nofficers of Pope's and Steinwehr's commands be not entitled, when\r\ncaptured, to be treated as soldiers and entitled to the benefit of the\r\ncartel of exchange:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\"WASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"First.  Ordered that Military Commanders within the States of Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nTexas, and Arkansas, in an orderly manner seize and use any property,\r\nreal or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several\r\ncommands, for supplies, or for other Military purposes; and that while\r\nproperty may be destroyed for proper Military objects, none shall be\r\ndestroyed in wantonness or malice.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  That Military and Naval Commanders shall employ as laborers,\r\nwithin and from said States, so many Persons of African descent as can\r\nbe advantageously used for Military or Naval purposes, giving them\r\nreasonable wages for their labor.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That, as to both property, and Persons of African descent,\r\naccounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show\r\nquantities and amounts, and from whom both property and such Persons\r\nshall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in\r\nproper cases; and the several departments of this Government shall\r\nattend to and perform their appropriate parts towards the execution of\r\nthese orders.\r\n\r\n\"By Order of the President:\r\n\r\n                         \"EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n                         \"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, 1862, Major General McClellan promulgated the\r\nExecutive Order of July 22, 1862, from his Headquarters at Harrison's\r\nLanding, Va., with certain directions of his own, among which were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"Inhabitants, especially women and children, remaining peaceably at\r\ntheir homes, must not be molested; and wherever commanding officers find\r\nfamilies peculiarly exposed in their persons or property to marauding\r\nfrom this Army, they will, as heretofore, so far as they can do with\r\nsafety and without detriment to the service, post guards for their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"In protecting private property, no reference is intended to Persons\r\nheld to service or labor by reason of African Descent.  Such Persons\r\nwill be regarded by this Army, as they heretofore have been, as\r\noccupying simply a peculiar legal status under State laws, which\r\ncondition the Military authorities of the United States are not required\r\nto regard at all in districts where Military operations are made\r\nnecessary by the rebellious action of the State governments.\r\n\r\n\"Persons subject to suspicion of hostile purposes, residing or being\r\nnear our Forces, will be, as heretofore, subject to arrest and\r\ndetention, until the cause or necessity is removed.  All such arrested\r\nparties will be sent, as usual, to the Provost-Marshal General, with a\r\nstatement of the facts in each case.\r\n\r\n\"The General Commanding takes this occasion to remind the officers and\r\nsoldiers of this Army that we are engaged in supporting the Constitution\r\nand the Laws of the United States and suppressing Rebellion against\r\ntheir authority; that we are not engaged in a War of rapine, revenge, or\r\nsubjugation; that this is not a contest against populations, but against\r\narmed forces and political organizations; that it is a struggle carried\r\non with the United States, and should be conducted by us upon the\r\nhighest principles known to Christian civilization.\r\n\r\n\"Since this Army commenced active operations, Persons of African\r\ndescent, including those held to service or labor under State laws, have\r\nalways been received, protected, and employed as laborers at wages.\r\nHereafter it shall be the duty of the Provost-Marshal General to cause\r\nlists to be made of all persons of African descent employed in this Army\r\nas laborers for Military purposes--such lists being made sufficiently\r\naccurate and in detail to show from whom such persons shall have come.\r\n\r\n\"Persons so subject and so employed have always understood that after\r\nbeing received into the Military service of the United States, in any\r\ncapacity, they could never be reclaimed by their former holders.  Except\r\nupon such understanding on their part, the order of the President, as to\r\nthis class of Persons, would be inoperative.  The General Commanding\r\ntherefore feels authorized to declare to all such employees, that they\r\nwill receive permanent Military protection against any compulsory return\r\nto a condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was now rapidly advancing, under the pressure of Military\r\nnecessity, and the energetic efforts of the immediate Emancipationists,\r\nto a belief that Emancipation by Presidential Proclamation would be wise\r\nand efficacious as an instrumentality toward subduing the Rebellion;\r\nthat it must come, sooner or later--and the sooner, the better.\r\n\r\nIndeed, great fault was found, by some of these, with what they\r\ncharacterized as President Lincoln's \"obstinate slowness\" to come up to\r\ntheir advanced ideas on the subject.  He was even accused of failing to\r\nexecute existing laws touching confiscation of Slaves of Rebels coming\r\nwithin the lines of the Union Armies.  On the 19th of August, 1862, a\r\nletter was addressed to him by Horace Greeley which concluded thus:\r\n\r\n\"On the face of this wide Earth, Mr. President, there is not one\r\ndisinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union Cause who\r\ndoes not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion, and at the\r\nsame time uphold its inciting cause, are preposterous and futile--that\r\nthe Rebellion, if crushed out to-morrow, would be renewed within a year\r\nif Slavery were left in full vigor--that Army officers, who remain to\r\nthis day devoted to Slavery, can at best be but half-way loyal to the\r\nUnion--and that every hour of deference to Slavery is an hour of added\r\nand deepened peril to the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the testimony of your embassadors in Europe.  It is freely\r\nat your service, not mine.  Ask them to tell you candidly whether\r\nthe seeming subserviency of your policy to the Slaveholding,\r\nSlavery-upholding interest, is not the perplexity, the despair,\r\nof Statesmen of all parties; and be admonished by the general answer.\r\n\r\n\"I close, as I began, with the statement that what an immense majority\r\nof the loyal millions of your countrymen require of you, is a frank,\r\ndeclared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the Laws of the Land,\r\nmore especially of the Confiscation Act.  That Act gives Freedom to the\r\nSlaves of Rebels coming within our lines, or whom those lines may at any\r\ntime inclose.  We ask you to render it due obedience by publicly\r\nrequiring all your subordinates to recognize and obey it.\r\n\r\n\"The Rebels are everywhere using the late Anti-Negro riots in the North\r\n--as they have long used your officers' treatment of Negroes in the\r\nSouth--to convince the Slaves that they have nothing to hope from a\r\nUnion success--that we mean in that case to sell them into a bitter\r\nBondage to defray the cost of the War.\r\n\r\n\"Let them impress this as a truth on the great mass of their ignorant\r\nand credulous Bondmen, and the Union will never be restored--never.  We\r\ncan not conquer ten millions of people united in solid phalanx against\r\nus, powerfully aided by Northern sympathizers and European allies.\r\n\r\n\"We must have scouts, guides, spies, cooks, teamsters, diggers, and\r\nchoppers, from the Blacks of the South--whether we allow them to fight\r\nfor us or not--or we shall be baffled and repelled.\r\n\r\n\"As one of the Millions who would gladly have avoided this struggle, at\r\nany sacrifice but that of principle and honor, but who now feel that the\r\ntriumph of the Union is indispensable not only to the existence of our\r\nCountry, but to the well-being of mankind, I entreat you to render a\r\nhearty and unequivocal obedience to the Law of the Land.\r\n                         \"Yours,\r\n                              \"HORACE GREELEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this letter, President Lincoln at once made the following memorable\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n                         \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n               \"WASHINGTON, Friday, August 22, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"HON. HORACE GREELEY\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--I have just read yours of the 19th inst. addressed to myself\r\nthrough the New York Tribune.\r\n\r\n\"If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may\r\nknow to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them.\r\n\r\n\"If there be any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I\r\ndo not now and here argue against them.\r\n\r\n\"If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I\r\nwaive it in deference to an old friend whose heart I have always\r\nsupposed to be right.\r\n\r\n\"As to the policy I 'seem to be pursuing,' as you say, I have not meant\r\nto leave any one in doubt.  I would save the Union.  I would save it in\r\nthe shortest way under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner the National authority can be restored, the nearer the Union\r\nwill be--the Union as it was.\r\n\r\n\"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the\r\nsame time save Slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\n\"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the\r\nsame time destroy Slavery, I do not agree, with them.\r\n\r\n\"My paramount object is to save the Union and not either to save or\r\ndestroy Slavery.\r\n\r\n\"If I could save the Union without freeing any Slave, I would do it--and\r\nif I could save it by freeing all the Slaves, I would do it--and if I\r\ncould save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"What I do about Slavery and the Colored race, I do because I believe it\r\nhelps to save the Union, and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not\r\nbelieve it would help to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the\r\ncause, and shall do more whenever I believe doing more will help the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and I shall\r\nadopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.\r\n\r\n\"I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty,\r\nand I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all\r\nmen everywhere could be free.\r\n                         \"Yours,\r\n                                   \"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of September, 1862, a deputation from all the religious\r\ndenominations of Chicago presented to President Lincoln a memorial for\r\nthe immediate issue of a Proclamation of Emancipation, to which, and the\r\nChairman's remarks, he thus replied:\r\n\r\n\"The subject presented in the Memorial is one upon which I have thought\r\nmuch for weeks past, and I may even say, for months.  I am approached\r\nwith the most opposite opinions, and advice, and that by religious men,\r\nwho are equally certain that they represent the Divine will.  I am sure\r\nthat either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and\r\nperhaps, in some respects, both.  I hope it will not be irreverent for\r\nme to say that if it is probable that God would reveal His will to\r\nothers, on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed He\r\nwould reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself\r\nthan I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence\r\nin this matter.  And if I can learn what it is, I will do it!\r\n\r\n\"These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be\r\ngranted that I am not to expect a direct Revelation; I must study the\r\nplain physical aspects of the case, ascertain what is possible, and\r\nlearn what appears to be wise and right!\r\n\r\n\"The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree.  For instance, the\r\nother day, four gentlemen, of standing and intelligence, from New York,\r\ncalled, as a delegation, on business connected with the War; but, before\r\nleaving, two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general\r\nEmancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them.\r\n\r\n\"You know also that the last Session of Congress had a decided majority\r\nof Anti-Slavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy.  And the\r\nsame is true of the religious people; why the Rebel soldiers are praying\r\nwith a great deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and\r\nexpecting God to favor their side; for one of our soldiers, who had been\r\ntaken prisoner, told Senator Wilson, a few days since, that he met\r\nnothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among,\r\nin their prayers.  But we will talk over the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n\"What good would a Proclamation of Emancipation from me do, especially\r\nas we are now situated?  I do not want to issue a document that the\r\nwhole World will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's\r\nBull against the Comet!  Would my word free the Slaves, when I cannot\r\neven enforce the Constitution in the Rebel States?  Is there a single\r\nCourt or Magistrate, or individual that would be influenced by it there?\r\nAnd what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon\r\nthe Slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved and which\r\noffers protection and Freedom to the Slaves of Rebel masters who came\r\nwithin our lines?  Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single\r\nSlave to come over to us.\r\n\r\n\"And suppose they could be induced by a Proclamation of Freedom from me\r\nto throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?  How can we\r\nfeed and care for such a multitude?  General Butler wrote me a few days\r\nsince that he was issuing more rations to the Slaves who have rushed to\r\nhim, than to all the White troops under his command.  They eat, and that\r\nis all; though it is true General Butler is feeding the Whites also, by\r\nthe thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there.\r\n\r\n\"If, now, the pressure of the War should call off our forces from New\r\nOrleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from\r\nreducing the Blacks to Slavery again; for I am told that whenever the\r\nRebels take any Black prisoners, Free or Slave, they immediately auction\r\nthem off!  They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground\r\nin the Tennessee river a few days ago.\r\n\r\n\"And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it!  For instance, when,\r\nafter the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from\r\nWashington, under a flag of truce, to bury the dead and bring in the\r\nwounded, and the Rebels seized the Blacks who went along to help, and\r\nsent them into Slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the\r\nGovernment would probably do nothing about it.  What could I do?\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would\r\nfollow the issuing of such a Proclamation as you desire?  Understand, I\r\nraise no objections against it on legal or Constitutional grounds, for,\r\nas Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, in time of War, I suppose I\r\nhave a right to take any measure which may best subdue the Enemy, nor do\r\nI urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of\r\ninsurrection and massacre at the South.  I view this matter as a\r\npractical War measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or\r\ndisadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n                *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"I admit that Slavery is at the root of the Rebellion, or, at least, its\r\nsine qua non.  The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to\r\nact, but they would have been impotent without Slavery as their\r\ninstrument.  I will also concede that Emancipation would help us in\r\nEurope, and convince them that we are incited by something more than\r\nambition.  I grant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North,\r\nthough not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine.\r\n\r\n\"Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the War,\r\nand then, unquestionably, it would weaken the Rebels by drawing off\r\ntheir laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not so sure we\r\ncould do much with the Blacks.  If we were to arm them, I fear that in\r\na few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the Rebels; and, indeed,\r\nthus far, we have not had arms enough to equip our White troops.\r\n\r\n\"I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and\r\ncontempt.  There are 50,000 bayonets in the Union Army from the Border\r\nSlave States.  It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a\r\nProclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the Rebels.  I\r\ndo not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as\r\nsix months ago--not so many to-day, as yesterday.  Every day increases\r\ntheir Union feeling.  They are also getting their pride enlisted, and\r\nwant to beat the Rebels.\r\n\r\n\"Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that we already\r\nhave an important principle to rally and unite the People, in the fact\r\nthat Constitutional Government is at stake.  This is a fundamental idea\r\ngoing down about as deep as anything!\r\n\r\n               *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections.\r\nThey indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in\r\nsome such way as you desire.\r\n\r\n\"I have not decided against a Proclamation of Liberty to the Slaves, but\r\nhold the matter under advisement.  And I can assure you that the subject\r\nis on my mind, by day and night, more than any other.  Whatever shall\r\nappear to be God's will I will do.\r\n\r\n\"I trust that in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I\r\nhave not in any respect injured your feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September, 1862, not only the Nation, but the whole\r\nWorld, was electrified by the publication--close upon the heels of the\r\nUnion victory of Antietam--of the Proclamation of Emancipation--weighted\r\nwith consequences so wide and far-reaching that even at this late day\r\nthey cannot all be discerned.  It was in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States of America, and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and\r\ndeclare that hereafter, as heretofore, the War will be prosecuted for\r\nthe object of practically restoring the Constitutional relation between\r\nthe United States and each of the States and the people thereof, in\r\nwhich States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again\r\nrecommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to\r\nthe free acceptance or rejection of all Slave States, so called, the\r\npeople whereof may not then be in Rebellion against the United States,\r\nand which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may\r\nvoluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of Slavery within\r\ntheir respective limits; and that the effort to colonize Persons of\r\nAfrican descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere,\r\nwith the previously obtained consent of the Governments existing there,\r\nwill be continued.\r\n\r\n\"That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\neight hundred and sixty-three, all Persons held as Slaves within any\r\nState or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in\r\nRebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and\r\nforever Free; and the Executive Government of the United States,\r\nincluding the Military and Naval authority thereof, will recognize and\r\nmaintain the Freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to\r\nrepress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for\r\ntheir actual Freedom.\r\n\r\n\"That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by\r\nProclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which\r\nthe people thereof respectively, shall then be in Rebellion against the\r\nUnited States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall\r\non that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United\r\nStates by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the\r\nqualified voters of such States shall have participated, shall, in the\r\nabsence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive\r\nevidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not in Rebellion\r\nagainst the United States.\r\n\r\n\"That attention is hereby called to an Act of Congress entitled 'An Act\r\nto make an additional Article of War,' approved March 31, 1862, and\r\nwhich Act is in the words and figures following:\r\n\r\n\"'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following\r\nshall be promulgated as an additional Article of War, for the government\r\nof the Army of the United States, and shall be obeyed and observed as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\n\"ARTICLE--All officers or persons in the Military or Naval service of\r\nthe United States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under\r\ntheir respective commands for the purpose of returning Fugitives from\r\nservice or labor who may have escaped from any persons to whom such\r\nservice or labor is claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be\r\nfound guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall be\r\ndismissed from the service.\r\n\r\n\"'SECTION 2.--And be it further enacted, That this Act shall take effect\r\nfrom and after its passage.'\r\n\r\n\"Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an Act entitled 'An Act to\r\nsuppress Insurrection, to punish Treason and Rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate property of Rebels, and for other purposes,' approved July\r\n17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:\r\n\r\n\"'SEC. 9.--And be it further enacted, That all Slaves of persons who\r\nshall hereafter be engaged in Rebellion against the Government of the\r\nUnited States or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto,\r\nescaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the\r\nArmy; and all Slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them, and\r\ncoming under the control of the Government of the United States; and all\r\nSlaves of such persons found on [or] being within any place occupied by\r\nRebel forces and afterward occupied by the forces of the United States,\r\nshall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever Free of their\r\nservitude, and not again held as Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"'SEC. 10.--And be it further enacted, That no Slave escaping into any\r\nState, Territory, or the District of Columbia, from any other State,\r\nshall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty,\r\nexcept for crime, or some offense against the laws, unless the person\r\nclaiming said Fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the\r\nlabor or service of such Fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful\r\nowner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present\r\nRebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto; and no person\r\nengaged in the Military or Naval service of the United States shall,\r\nunder any pretense whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the\r\nclaim of any person to the service or labor of any other person, or\r\nsurrender up any such Person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed\r\nfrom the service.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the\r\nMilitary and Naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and\r\nenforce, within their respective spheres of service, the Act and\r\nsections above recited.\r\n\r\n\"And the Executive will in due time recommend that all\r\ncitizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal thereto\r\nthroughout the Rebellion shall (upon the restoration of the\r\nConstitutional relation between the United States and their respective\r\nStates and people, if that relation shall have been suspended or\r\ndisturbed) be compensated for all losses by acts of the United States,\r\nincluding the loss of Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n\"Done at the city of Washington this twenty-second day of September, in\r\nthe year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\"By the President:\r\n\"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"WILLIAM H.  SEWARD, Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Proclamation, promising Freedom to an Enslaved race, was hailed\r\nwith acclamations everywhere save in the rebellious Southern-Slave\r\nStates, and in the Border-Slave States.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of Governors of Loyal States, held at Altoona,\r\nPennsylvania, to take measures for the more active support of the\r\nGovernment, an Address was adopted, on the very day that the\r\nProclamation was promulgated, which well expressed the general feeling\r\nprevailing throughout the Northern States, at this time.  It was in\r\nthese patriotic words:\r\n\r\n\"After nearly one year and a half spent in contest with an armed and\r\ngigantic Rebellion against the National Government of the United States,\r\nthe duty and purpose of the Loyal States and people continue, and must\r\nalways remain as they were at its origin--namely to restore and\r\nperpetuate the authority of this Government and the life of the Nation.\r\nNo matter what consequences are involved in our fidelity, this work of\r\nrestoring the Republic, preserving the institutions of democratic\r\nLiberty, and justifying the hopes and toils of our Fathers, shall not\r\nfail to be performed.\r\n\r\n\"And we pledge, without hesitation, to the President of the United\r\nStates, the most loyal and cordial support, hereto as heretofore, in\r\nthe exercise of the functions of his great office.  We recognize in him\r\nthe chief Executive magistrate of the Nation, the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Army and Navy of the United States, their responsible and\r\nconstitutional head, whose rightful authority and power, as well as the\r\nConstitutional powers of Congress, must be rigorously and religiously\r\nguarded and preserved, as the condition on which alone our form of\r\nGovernment and the constitutional rights and liberties of the People\r\nthemselves can be saved from the wreck of anarchy or from the gulf\r\n'despotism.\r\n\r\n\"In submission to the laws which may have been or which may be duly\r\nenacted, and to the lawful orders of the President, cooperating always\r\nin our own spheres with the National Government, we mean to continue in\r\nthe most rigorous exercise of all our lawful and proper powers,\r\ncontending against Treason, Rebellion, and the public Enemies, and,\r\nwhether in public life or in private station, supporting the arms of the\r\nUnion, until its Cause shall conquer, until final victory shall perch\r\nupon its standard, or the Rebel foe will yield a dutiful, rightful, and\r\nunconditional submission.  And, impressed with the conviction that an\r\nArmy of reserve ought, until the War shall end, to be constantly kept on\r\nfoot, to be raised, armed, equipped, and trained at home, and ready for\r\nemergencies, we respectfully ask the President to call such a force of\r\nvolunteers for one year's service, of not less than one hundred thousand\r\nin the aggregate, the quota of each State to be raised after it shall\r\nhave led its quota of the requisitions already made, both for volunteers\r\nand militia.  We believe that this would be a Leasure of Military\r\nprudence, while it would greatly promote the Military education of the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\n\"We hail with heartfelt gratitude and encouraged hope the Proclamation\r\nof the President, issued on the 22nd instant, declaring Emancipated from\r\ntheir bondage all Persons held to Service or Labor as Slaves in the\r\nRebel States, whose Rebellion shall last until the first day of January\r\nnext ensuing.\r\n\r\n\"The right of any person to retain authority to compel any portion of\r\nthe subjects of the National Government to rebel against it, or to\r\nmaintain its Enemies, implies in those who are allowed possession of\r\nsuch authority the right to rebel themselves; and therefore, the right\r\nto establish Martial Law or Military Government in a State or Territory\r\nin Rebellion implies the right and the duty of the Government to\r\nliberate the minds of all men living therein by appropriate\r\nProclamations and assurances of protection, in order that all who are\r\ncapable, intellectually and morally, of loyalty and obedience, may not\r\nbe forced into Treason as the unwilling tools of rebellious Traitors.\r\n\r\n\"To have continued indefinitely the most efficient cause, support, and\r\nstay of the Rebellion, would have been, in our judgment, unjust to the\r\nLoyal people whose treasure and lives are made a willing sacrifice on\r\nthe altar of patriotism--would have discriminated against the wife who\r\nis compelled to surrender her husband, against the parent who is to\r\nsurrender his child, to the hardships of the camp and the perils of\r\nbattle, in favor of Rebel masters permitted to retain their Slaves.  It\r\nwould have been a final decision alike against humanity, justice, the\r\nrights and dignity of the Government, and against sound and wise\r\nNational policy.\r\n\r\n\"The decision of the President to strike at the root of the Rebellion\r\nwill lend new vigor to efforts, and new life and hope to the hearts of\r\nthe People.  Cordially tendering to the President our respectful\r\nassurances of personal and official confidence, we trust and believe\r\nthat the policy now inaugurated will be crowned with success, will give\r\nspeedy and triumphant victories over our enemies, and secure to this\r\nNation and this People the blessing and favor of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that the blood of the heroes who have already fallen, and\r\nthose who may yet give their lives to their Country, will not have been\r\nshed in vain.\r\n\r\n\"The splendid valor of our soldiers, their patient endurance, their\r\nmanly patriotism, and their devotion to duty, demand from us and from\r\nall their countrymen the homage of the sincerest gratitude and the\r\npledge of our constant reinforcement and support.  A just regard for\r\nthese brave men, whom we have contributed to place in the field, and for\r\nthe importance of the duties which may lawfully pertain to us hereafter,\r\nhas called us into friendly conference.\r\n\r\n\"And now, presenting to our National Chief Magistrate this conclusion of\r\nour deliberations, we devote ourselves to our Country's service, and we\r\nwill surround the President with our constant support, trusting that the\r\nfidelity and zeal of the Loyal States and People will always assure him\r\nthat he will be constantly maintained in pursuing, with the utmost\r\nvigor, this War for the preservation of the National life and hope of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\"A.

SPRAGUE,\r\n\"F. H. PEIRPOINT,\r\n\"DAVID TOD,\r\n\"N. S. BERRY,\r\n\"AUSTIN BLAIR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome two months after the issue of his great Proclamation of Liberty,\r\nPresident Lincoln (in his Second Annual Message to Congress, December 1,\r\n1862), took occasion again to refer to compensated Emancipation, and,\r\nindeed, to the entire matter of Slavery and Freedom, in most instructive\r\nand convincing manner, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On the 22d day of September last, a Proclamation was issued by the\r\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith  submitted.\r\n\r\n\"In accordance with the purpose in the second paragraph of that paper, I\r\nnow respectfully recall your attention to what may be called\r\n'compensated Emancipation.'\r\n\r\n\"A Nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\r\nlaws.  The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\r\n'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but the\r\nEarth abideth forever.'  It is of the first importance to duly consider\r\nand estimate this ever-enduring part.\r\n\r\n\"That portion of the Earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the\r\nPeople of the United States, is well adapted to be the home of one\r\nNational family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more.  Its vast\r\nextent, and its variety of climate and productions, are of advantage, in\r\nthis age, for one People, whatever they might have been in former ages.\r\nSteam, telegraphs, and intelligence, have brought these to be an\r\nadvantageous combination for one united People.\r\n\r\n\"In the Inaugural Address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\r\nDisunion, as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two\r\nSections.  I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which,\r\ntherefore, I beg to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"'One Section of our Country believes Slavery is right, and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be\r\nextended.  This is the only substantial dispute.  The Fugitive Slave\r\nclause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the\r\nforeign Slave Trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\r\never be in a community where the moral sense of the People imperfectly\r\nsupports the law itself.\r\n\r\n\"The great body of the People abide by the dry legal obligation in both\r\ncases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think, cannot be perfectly\r\ncured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the\r\nSections, than before.  The foreign Slave Trade, now imperfectly\r\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one\r\nSection; while Fugitive Slaves, now only partially surrendered, would\r\nnot be surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\n\"Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\r\nrespective Sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and each go out of\r\nthe presence and beyond the reach of the other; but the different parts\r\nof our Country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face; and\r\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.\r\n\r\n\"'Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or\r\nmore satisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make\r\ntreaties easier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more\r\nfaithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? suppose\r\nyou go to War, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on\r\nboth sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old\r\nquestions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.'\r\n\r\n\"There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a National boundary\r\nupon which to divide.  Trace through, from East to West, upon the line\r\nbetween the Free and Slave Country, and we shall find a little more than\r\none third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated,\r\nor soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its\r\nremaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk\r\nback and forth without any consciousness of their presence.\r\n\r\n\"No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing\r\nit down on paper or parchment as a National boundary.  The fact of\r\nseparation, if it comes, gives up, on the part of the seceding Section,\r\nthe Fugitive Slave clause, along with all other Constitutional\r\nobligations upon the Section seceded from, while I should expect no\r\ntreaty stipulations would ever be made to take its place.\r\n\r\n\"But there is another difficulty.  The great interior region, bounded\r\nEast by the Alleghanies, North by the British dominions, West by the\r\nRocky Mountains, and South by the line along which the culture of corn\r\nand cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of\r\nTennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of\r\nDakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above ten million\r\npeople, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not\r\nprevented by any political folly or mistake.\r\n\r\n\"It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United\r\nStates-certainly more than one million square miles.  Once half as\r\npopulous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than\r\nseventy-five million people.  A glance at the map shows that,\r\nterritorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic.  The other\r\nparts are but marginal borders to it, the magnificent region sloping\r\nWest, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, being the deepest and\r\nalso the richest in undeveloped resources.  In the production of\r\nprovisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them, this great\r\ninterior region is naturally one of the most important in the World.\r\n\r\n\"Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which\r\nhas, as yet, been brought into cultivation, and also the large and\r\nrapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed\r\nwith the magnitude of the prospect presented.  And yet this region has\r\nno sea coast, touches no ocean anywhere.  As part of one Nation, its\r\npeople now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York,\r\nto South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\n\"But separate our common Country into two nations, as designed by the\r\npresent Rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is\r\nthereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not, perhaps, by\r\na physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\n\"And this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.\r\nPlace it between the now Free and Slave country, or place it South of\r\nKentucky, or North of Ohio, and still the truth remains, that none South\r\nof it can trade to any port or place North of it, and none North of it\r\ncan trade to any port or place South of it except upon terms dictated by\r\na Government foreign to them.\r\n\r\n\"These outlets, East, West, and South, are indispensable to the\r\nwell-being of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior\r\nregion.  Which of the three may be the best, is no proper question.\r\nAll, are better than either; and all, of right belong to that People,\r\nand to their successors forever.  True to themselves, they will not ask\r\nwhere a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there\r\nshall be no such line.\r\n\r\n\"Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to\r\nand through them, to the great outside World.  They too, and each of\r\nthem, must have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at\r\nthe crossing of any National boundary.\r\n\r\n\"Our National strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the\r\nLand we inhabit; not from our National homestead.  There is no possible\r\nsevering of this, but would multiply, and not mitigate, evils among us.\r\nIn all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands Union, and abhors\r\nseparation.  In fact it would, ere long, force reunion, however much of\r\nblood and treasure the separation might have cost.\r\n\r\n\"Our strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men;\r\nand it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever--with the passing of\r\none generation.\r\n\r\n\"In this view I recommend the adoption of the following Resolution and\r\nArticles Amendatory of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America, in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring).  That the following Articles be proposed to the\r\nLegislatures (or Conventions) of the several States, as Amendments to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, all or any of which Articles when\r\nratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures (or Conventions) to\r\nbe valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, namely:\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE--Every State wherein Slavery now exists, which shall abolish\r\nthe same therein, at any time, or times, before the first day of\r\nJanuary, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, shall\r\nreceive compensation from the United States, as follows, to wit;\r\n\r\n\"'The President of the United States shall deliver to every such State,\r\nbonds of the United States, bearing interest at the rate of per cent.\r\nper annum, to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of for each Slave\r\nshown to have been therein by the eighth census of the United States,\r\nsaid bonds to be delivered to such States by installments, or in one\r\nparcel, at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same\r\nshall have been gradual, or at one time, within such State; and interest\r\nshall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its\r\ndelivery as aforesaid.  Any State having received bonds as aforesaid,\r\nand afterward reintroducing or tolerating Slavery therein, shall refund\r\nto the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and\r\nall interest paid thereon.\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE--All Slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the\r\nchances of the War at any time before the end of the Rebellion, shall be\r\nforever Free; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal,\r\nshall be compensated for them, at the same rates as is provided for\r\nStates adopting abolishment of Slavery, but in such way that no Slave\r\nshall be twice accounted for.\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE--Congress may appropriate money, and otherwise provide for\r\ncolonizing Free Colored Persons, with their own consent, at any place or\r\nplaces within the United States.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed Articles at some length.\r\nWithout Slavery the Rebellion could never have existed; without Slavery\r\nit could not continue.\r\n\r\n\"Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment\r\nand of policy in regard to Slavery, and the African race among us.  Some\r\nwould perpetuate Slavery; some would abolish it suddenly, without\r\ncompensation; some would abolish it gradually, and with compensation;\r\nsome would remove the Freed people from us; and some would retain them\r\nwith us; and there are yet other minor diversities.  Because of these\r\ndiversities, we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"By mutual Concession we should harmonize and act together.  This would\r\nbe Compromise; but it would be Compromise among the friends, and not\r\nwith the enemies of the Union.  These Articles are intended to embody a\r\nplan of such mutual concessions.  If the plan shall be adopted, it is\r\nassumed that Emancipation will follow, at least, in several of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"As to the first Article, the main points are: first, the Emancipation;\r\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it--thirty-seven years;\r\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\r\n\r\n\"The Emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\r\nSlavery; but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\r\ndissatisfaction.  The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\r\nderangement--in fact from the necessity of any derangement--while most\r\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the\r\nmeasure will have passed away before its consummation.  They will never\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\n\"Another class will hail the prospect of Emancipation, but will\r\ndeprecate the length of time.  They will feel that it gives too little\r\nto the now living Slaves.  But it really gives them much.  It saves them\r\nfrom the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate\r\nEmancipation in localities where their numbers are very great; and it\r\ngives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be Free\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\"The plan leaves to each State, choosing to act under it, to abolish\r\nSlavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time,\r\nor by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period; and\r\nit obliges no two States to proceed alike.  It also provides for\r\ncompensation,--and generally, the mode of making it.  This, it would\r\nseem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor\r\nperpetual Slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the\r\ncompensation.  Doubtless some of those who are to pay, and not to\r\nreceive, will object.  Yet the measure is both just and economical.\r\n\r\n\"In a certain sense, the liberation of Slaves is the destruction of\r\nProperty--Property acquired by descent, or by purchase, the same as any\r\nother property.  It is no less true for having been often said, that the\r\npeople of the South are not more responsible for the original\r\nintroduction of this Property than are the people of the North; and when\r\nit is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and\r\nshare the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say\r\nthat the South has been more responsible than the North for its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\n\"If, then, for a common object, this Property is to be sacrificed, is it\r\nnot just that it be done at a common charge?\r\n\r\n\"And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\r\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the War alone, is it\r\nnot also economical to do it?  Let us consider it then.  Let us\r\nascertain the sum we have expended in the War since compensated\r\nEmancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether, if that\r\nmeasure had been promptly accepted, by even some of the Slave States,\r\nthe same sum would not have done more to close the War than has been\r\notherwise done.  If so, the measure would save money, and, in that view,\r\nwould be a prudent and economical measure.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing;\r\nbut it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one.  And\r\nit is easier to pay any sum when we are able, than it is to pay it\r\nbefore we are able.  The War requires large sums, and requires them at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"The aggregate sum necessary for compensated Emancipation of course\r\nwould be large.  But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds,\r\neven, any faster than the Emancipation progresses.  This might not, and\r\nprobably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years.  At\r\nthat time we shall probably have a hundred million people to share the\r\nburden, instead of thirty-one millions, as now.  And not only so, but\r\nthe increase of our population may be expected to continue, for a long\r\ntime after that period, as rapidly as before; because our territory will\r\nnot have become full.\r\n\r\n\"I do not state this inconsiderately.  At the same ratio of increase\r\nwhich we have maintained, on an average, from our first National census\r\nin 1790, until that of 1860, we should, in 1900, have a population of\r\n103,208,415.  And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that\r\nperiod?\r\n\r\n\"Our abundant room--our broad National homestead--is our ample resource.\r\nWere our territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly\r\nour population could not expand as stated.  Instead of receiving the\r\nforeign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the\r\nNative-born away.\r\n\r\n\"But such is not our condition.  We have two million nine hundred and\r\nsixty-three thousand square miles.  Europe has three million and eight\r\nhundred thousand, with a population averaging seventy-three and\r\none-third persons to the square mile.  Why may not our Country at some\r\ntime, average as many?  Is it less fertile?  Has it more waste surface\r\nby mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes?  Is it inferior\r\nto Europe in any natural advantage?\r\n\r\n\"If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how soon?\r\nAs to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to\r\nwhen it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Several of our States are already above the average of Europe\r\n--seventy-three and a third to the square mile.  Massachusetts has 157;\r\nRhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each, 80.\r\nAlso two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below,\r\nthe former having 63, and the latter 59.  The States already above the\r\nEuropean average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio,\r\nsince passing that point, as ever before; while no one of them is equal\r\nto some other parts of our Country in natural capacity for sustaining a\r\ndense population.\r\n\r\n\"Taking the Nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and\r\nratio of increase, for the several decennial periods, to be as follows:\r\n\r\nYEAR.  POPULATION. RATIO OF INCREASE\r\n\r\n1790   3,929,827\r\n\r\n1800   5,305,937   35.02 Per Cent.\r\n\r\n1810   7,239,814   36.45\r\n\r\n1820   9,638,131   33.13\r\n\r\n1830  12,866,020   33.49\r\n\r\n1840  17,069,453   32.67\r\n\r\n1850  23,191,876   35.87\r\n\r\n1860  31,443,790   35.58\r\n\r\n\"This shows an average Decennial Increase of 34.69 per cent. in\r\npopulation through the seventy years from our first to our last census\r\nyet taken.  It is seen that the ratio of increase, at no one of these\r\nseven periods, is either two per cent. below or two per cent. above the\r\naverage; thus showing how inflexible, and, consequently, how reliable,\r\nthe law of Increase, in our case, is.\r\n\r\n\"Assuming that it will continue, gives the following results:\r\n\r\nYEAR.  POPULATION.\r\n\r\n1870   42,323,041\r\n\r\n1880   56,967,216\r\n\r\n1890   76,677,872\r\n\r\n1900  103,208,415\r\n\r\n1910  138,918,526\r\n\r\n1920  186,984,335\r\n\r\n1930  251,680,914\r\n\r\n\"These figures show that our Country may be as populous as Europe now is\r\nat some point between 1920 and 1930--say about 1925--our territory, at\r\nseventy-three and a third persons to the square mile, being of capacity\r\nto contain 217,186,000.\r\n\r\n\"And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the\r\nchance by the folly and evils of Disunion or by long and exhausting War\r\nspringing from the only great element of National discord among us.\r\nWhile it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of\r\nSecession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population,\r\ncivilization and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it\r\nwould be very great and injurious.\r\n\r\n\"The proposed Emancipation would shorten the War, perpetuate Peace,\r\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\r\nthe Country.  With these, we should pay all the Emancipation would cost,\r\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n\"If we had allowed our old National debt to run at six per cent. per\r\nannum, simple interest, from the end of our Revolutionary Struggle until\r\nto-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each\r\nman of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it\r\nthen; and this because our increase of men through the whole period has\r\nbeen greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the interest upon\r\nthe debt.  Thus, time alone, relieves a debtor Nation, so long as its\r\npopulation increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\n\"This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly\r\ndue, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the\r\ngreat advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we\r\nnumber a hundred millions, what, by a different policy, we would have to\r\npay now, when we number but thirty-one millions.  In a word, it shows\r\nthat a dollar will be much harder to pay for the War, than will be a\r\ndollar for Emancipation on the proposed plan.  And then the latter will\r\ncost no blood, no precious life.  It will be a saving of both.\r\n\r\n\"As to the Second Article, I think it would be impracticable to return\r\nto Bondage the class of Persons therein contemplated.  Some of them,\r\ndoubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners and hence\r\nprovision is made in this Article for compensating such.\r\n\r\n\"The Third Article relates to the future of the Freed people.  It does\r\nnot oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as\r\nmay consent.  This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one\r\nhand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing, unless by the\r\nmutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American voters,\r\nthrough their Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor\r\ncolonization.  And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\r\nfree Colored persons remaining in the Country which is largely\r\nimaginary, if not sometimes malicious.\r\n\r\n\"It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace White\r\nlabor and White laborers.  If there ever could be a proper time for mere\r\ncatch arguments, that time surely is not now.  In times like the present\r\nmen should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be\r\nresponsible through Time and in Eternity.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true, then, that Colored people can displace any more White labor\r\nby being Free, than by remaining Slaves?  If they stay in their old\r\nplaces, they jostle no White laborers; if they leave their old places,\r\nthey leave them open to White laborers.  Logically, there is neither\r\nmore nor less of it.\r\n\r\n\"Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the\r\nwages of White labor, and, very surely would not reduce them.  Thus, the\r\ncustomary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed\r\npeople would surely not do more than their old proportion of it and,\r\nvery probably, for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to\r\nWhite laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and\r\nconsequently enhancing the wages of it.\r\n\r\n\"With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to White\r\nlabor is mathematically certain.  Labor is like any other commodity in\r\nthe market-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it.\r\nReduce the supply of Black labor by colonizing the Black laborer out of\r\nthe Country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and\r\nwages of White labor.\r\n\r\n\"But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\r\nwhole Land!  Are they not already in the Land?  Will liberation make\r\nthem any more numerous?  Equally distributed among the Whites of the\r\nwhole Country, there would be but one Colored, in seven Whites.  Could\r\nthe one, in any way, greatly disturb the seven?\r\n\r\n\"There are many communities now, having more than one free Colored\r\nperson to seven Whites; and this, without any apparent consciousness of\r\nevil from it.  The District of Columbia, and the States of Maryland and\r\nDelaware, are all in this condition.  The District has more than one\r\nfree Colored to six Whites; and yet, in its frequent petitions to\r\nCongress I believe it has never presented the presence of free Colored\r\npersons as one of its grievances.\r\n\r\n\"But why should Emancipation South, send the freed people North? people\r\nof any color, seldom run, unless there be something to run from.\r\nHeretofore, Colored people, to some extent, have fled North from\r\nbondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution.  But if\r\ngradual Emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither\r\nto flee from.\r\n\r\n\"Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can\r\nbe procured; and the freed men, in turn, will gladly give their labor\r\nfor the wages, till new homes can be found for them, in congenial\r\nclimes, and with people of their own blood and race.\r\n\r\n\"This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.  And,\r\nin any event, cannot the North decide for itself, whether to receive\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\"Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been\r\nany irruption of Colored people Northward because of the abolishment of\r\nSlavery in this District last Spring?  What I have said of the\r\nproportion of free Colored persons to the Whites in the District is from\r\nthe census of 1860, having no reference to persons called Contrabands,\r\nnor to those made free by the Act of Congress abolishing Slavery here.\r\n\r\n\"The plan consisting of these Articles is recommended, not but that a\r\nrestoration of the National authority would be accepted without its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\"Nor will the War, nor proceedings under the Proclamation of September\r\n22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan.  Its\r\ntimely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\"And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress\r\nprovides by law for compensating any State which may adopt Emancipation\r\nbefore this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly\r\nrenewed.  Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same\r\narguments apply to both.\r\n\r\n\"This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but\r\nadditional to, all others, for restoring and preserving the National\r\nauthority throughout the Union.  The subject is presented exclusively in\r\nits economical aspect.\r\n\r\n\"The plan would, I am confident, secure Peace more speedily, and\r\nmaintain it more permanently, than can be done by force alone; while all\r\nit would cost, considering amounts, and manner of payment, and times of\r\npayment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the\r\nWar, if we rely solely upon force.  It is much, very much, that it would\r\ncost no blood at all.\r\n\r\n\"The plan is proposed as permanent Constitutional Law.  It cannot become\r\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and\r\nafterward, three-fourths of the Slave States.  The requisite\r\nthree-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the Slave\r\nStates.  Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their\r\nseverally adopting Emancipation at no very distant day upon the new\r\nConstitutional terms.  This assurance would end the struggle now and\r\nsave the Union forever.\r\n\r\n\"I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed\r\nto the Congress of the Nation by the Chief Magistrate of the Nation.\r\nNor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you\r\nhave more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs.  Yet I\r\ntrust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will\r\nperceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may\r\nseem to display.\r\n\r\n\"Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\r\nthe War, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?  Is it\r\ndoubted that it would restore the National authority and National\r\nprosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely?  Is it doubted that we\r\nhere--Congress and Executive--can secure its adoption; will not the good\r\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?  Can we, can\r\nthey, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital\r\nobjects; we can succeed only by concert.\r\n\r\n\"It is not, 'Can any of us imagine better?' but,'Can we all do better?'\r\nObject whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs, 'Can we do\r\nbetter?  The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy\r\npresent.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise\r\nwith the occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act\r\nanew.  We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history.  We, of this Congress and\r\nthis Administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves.  No\r\npersonal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of\r\nus.  The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor\r\nor dishonor, to the latest generation.\r\n\r\n\"We say we are for the Union.  The World will not forget that we say\r\nthis.  We know how to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"The World knows we do know how to save it.  We even we here--hold the\r\npower, and bear the responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"In giving Freedom to the Slave, we assure Freedom to the Free-Honorable\r\nalike in what we give and what we preserve.  We shall nobly save, or\r\nmeanly lose, the last, best hope of Earth.  Other means may succeed;\r\nthis could not fail.  The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way\r\nwhich, if followed, the World would forever applaud, and God must\r\nforever bless.\r\n\r\n                              \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular Branch of Congress responded with heartiness to what Mr.\r\nLincoln had done.  On December 11, 1862, resolutions were offered by Mr.\r\nYeaman in the House of Representatives, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate Concurring), That\r\nthe Proclamation of the President of the United States, of date the 22d\r\nof September, 1862, is not warranted by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the policy of Emancipation as indicated in that\r\nProclamation, is not calculated to hasten the restoration of Peace, was\r\nnot well chosen as a War measure, and is an assumption of power\r\ndangerous to the rights of citizens and to the perpetuity of a Free\r\nPeople.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were laid on the table by 95 yeas to 47 nays--the yeas\r\nall Republicans, save three, and the nays all Democrats save five.\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 1862, Mr. S. C. Fessenden, of Maine, offered resolutions\r\nto the House, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Proclamation of the President of the United States,\r\nof the date of 22d September, 1862, is warranted by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the policy of Emancipation, as indicated in that\r\nProclamation, is well adapted to hasten the restoration of Peace, was\r\nwell chosen as a War measure, and is an exercise of power with proper\r\nregard for the rights of the States, and the perpetuity of Free\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were adopted by 78 yeas to 52 nays--the yeas all\r\nRepublicans, save two, and the nays all Democrats, save seven.\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of September 22d, 1862, was very generally endorsed and\r\nupheld by the People at large; and, in accordance with its promise, it\r\nwas followed at the appointed time, January 1st, 1863, by the\r\nsupplemental Proclamation specifically Emancipating the Slaves in the\r\nrebellious parts of the United States--in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, On the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a Proclamation was issued by\r\nthe President of the United States, containing, among other things, the\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"'That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\neight hundred and sixty-three, all Persons held as Slaves within any\r\nState, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be\r\nin Rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward,\r\nand forever Free;

It seemed as though they considered the most\r\nsacred promises and covenants of no account, and made only to be\r\ntrampled upon, when in the way of their Moloch.\r\n\r\nWe remember the bitter Slavery agitation in Congress over the admission\r\nof the State of Missouri, and how it eventuated in the Missouri\r\nCompromise.  That compromise, we have seen, they afterward trod upon,\r\nand broke, with as little compunction as they would have stepped upon\r\nand crushed a toad.\r\n\r\nThey felt their own growing power, and gloried in their strength and\r\narrogance; and Northern timidity became a scoff and by-word in their\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that from its very conception, as well as birth, they hated\r\nand opposed the Union, because they disliked a Republican and preferred\r\na Monarchical form of Government.  Their very inability to prevent the\r\nconsummation of that Union, imbittered them.  Hence their determination\r\nto seize every possible occasion and pretext afterward to destroy it,\r\nbelieving, as they doubtless did, that upon the crumbled and mouldering\r\nruins of a dissevered Union and ruptured Republic, Monarchical ideas\r\nmight the more easily take root and grow.  But experience had already\r\ntaught them that it would be long before their real object could even be\r\ncovertly hinted at, and that in the meantime it must be kept out of\r\nsight by the agitation of other political issues.  The formulation and\r\npromulgation therefore, by Jefferson, in the Kentucky Resolutions of\r\n1798, and by Madison, in the Virginia Resolutions of 1799, of the\r\ndoctrine of States Rights already referred to, was a perfect \"God-send\"\r\nto these men.  For it not only enabled them to keep from public view and\r\nknowledge their ultimate aim and purpose, but constituted the whip which\r\nthey thenceforth everlastingly flourished and cracked over the shrinking\r\nheads of other and more patriotic people--the whip with which, through\r\nthe litter of their broken promises, they ruthlessly rode into, and, for\r\nso long a period of years held on to, supreme power and place in the\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nIncluding within the scope of States Rights, the threats of\r\nNullification, Disunion and Secession--ideas abhorrent to the Patriot's\r\nmind--small wonder is it that, in those days, every fresh demand made by\r\nthese political autocrats was tremblingly acceded to, until patience and\r\nconcession almost utterly exhausted themselves.\r\n\r\nOriginally disturbing only South Carolina and Georgia to any extent,\r\nthese ambitious men, who believed in anything rather than a Republic,\r\nand who were determined to destroy the Union, gradually spread the\r\nspirit of jealousy and discontent into other States of the South; their\r\nimmediate object being to bring the Southern States into the closest\r\npossible relations the one with the other; to inspire them all with\r\ncommon sympathies and purposes; to compact and solidify them, so that in\r\nall coming movements against the other States of the Union, they might\r\nmove with proportionately increased power, and force, and effect,\r\nbecause of such unity of aim and strength.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of Southern discontent, and jealousy of the Northern States,\r\nwas, as we have seen, artfully fanned by the Conspirators, in heated\r\ndiscussions over the Tariff Acts of 1824, and 1828, and 1832, until, by\r\nthe latter date, the people of the Cotton-States were almost frantic,\r\nand ready to fight over their imaginary grievances.  Then it was that\r\nthe Conspirators thought the time had come, for which they had so long\r\nand so earnestly prayed and worked, when the cotton Sampson should wind\r\nhis strong arms around the pillars of the Constitution and pull down the\r\ngreat Temple of our Union--that they might rear upon its site another\r\nand a stronger edifice, dedicated not to Freedom, but to Free-Trade and\r\nto other false gods.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was to lead off, and the other Cotton States would\r\nfollow.  South Carolina did lead off--but the other Cotton-States did\r\nnot follow.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in these pages how South Carolina declared the Tariff\r\nActs aforesaid, null and void, armed herself to resist force, and\r\ndeclared that any attempt of the general Government to enforce those\r\nActs would cause her to withdraw from the Union.  But Jackson as we know\r\nthrottled the treason with so firm a grip that Nullification and\r\nSecession and Disunion were at once paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThe concessions to the domineering South, in Clay's Compromise Tariff of\r\n1833, let the Conspirators down easily, so to speak; and they pretended\r\nto be satisfied.  But they were satisfied only as are the thirsty sands\r\nof Africa with the passing shower.\r\n\r\nThe Conspirators had, however, after all, made substantial gains.  They\r\nhad established a precedent for an attempt to secede.  That was\r\nsomething.  They had demonstrated that a single Southern State could\r\nstand up, armed and threatening, strutting, blustering, and bullying,\r\nand at least make faces at the general Government without suffering any\r\nvery dreadful consequences.  That was still more.\r\n\r\nThey had also ascertained that, by adopting such a course, a single\r\nSouthern State could force concessions from the fears of the rest of the\r\nUnited States.  That was worth knowing, because the time might come,\r\nwhen it might be desirable not only for one but for all the Southern\r\nStates to secede upon some other pretext, and when it would be awkward,\r\nand would interfere with the Disunion programme, to have the other\r\nStates either offer or make concessions.\r\n\r\nThey had also learned the valuable lesson that the single issue of\r\nFree-Trade was not sufficiently strong of itself to unite all the\r\nSouthern States in a determination to secede, and thus dissolve the\r\nUnion.  They saw they must agitate some other issue to unify the South\r\nmore thoroughly and justify Disunion.  On looking over the whole field\r\nthey concluded that the Slavery question would best answer their\r\npurpose, and they adopted it.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless a full knowledge of the fact that they had adopted it,\r\nthat led Jackson to make the declaration, heretofore in these pages\r\ngiven, which has been termed \"prophetic.\"  At any rate, thenceforth the\r\nprogramme of the Conspirators was to agitate the Slavery question in all\r\nways possible, so as to increase, extend and solidify the influence and\r\nstrength of the Slave power; strain the bonds uniting them with the Free\r\nStates; and weaken the Free States by dividing them upon the question.\r\nAt the same time the Free-Trade question was to be pressed forward to a\r\ntriumphal issue, so that the South might be enriched and strengthened,\r\nand the North impoverished and weakened, by the result.\r\n\r\nThat was their programme, in the rough, and it was relentlessly adhered\r\nto.  Free-Trade and Slavery by turns, if not together, from that time\r\nonward, were ever at the front, agitating our People both North and\r\nSouth, and not only consolidating the Southern States on those lines, as\r\nthe Conspirators designed, but also serving ultimately to consolidate,\r\nto some extent--in a manner quite unlooked for by the Conspirators\r\n--Northern sentiment, on the opposite lines of Protection and Freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Compromise Tariff Act of 1833--which Clay was weak enough to\r\nconcede, and even stout old Jackson to permit to become law without his\r\nsignature--gave to the Conspirators great joy for years afterward, as\r\nthey witnessed the distress and disaster brought by it to Northern homes\r\nand incomes--not distress and disaster alone, but absolute and\r\napparently irreparable ruin.\r\n\r\nThe reaction occasioned by this widespread ruin having brought the Whigs\r\ninto power, led to the enactment of the Protective-Tariff of 1842 and\r\n--to the chagrin of the Conspirators--industrial prosperity and plenty to\r\nthe Free North again ensued.\r\n\r\nEven as Cain hated his brother Abel because his sacrifices were\r\nacceptable in the sight of God, while his own were not, so the Southern\r\nConspirators, and other Slave-owners also, had, by this time, come to\r\nhate the Northern free-thinking, free-acting, freedom-loving mechanic\r\nand laboring man, because the very fact and existence of his Godgiven\r\nFreedom and higher-resulting civilization was a powerful and perpetual\r\nprotest against the--abounding iniquities and degradations of Slavery as\r\npracticed by themselves.\r\n\r\nHence, by trickery, by cajoling the People With his, and their own,\r\nassurances that he was in favor of Protection--they secured the election\r\nin 1844 of a Free-Trade President, the consequent repeal of the\r\nProtective-Tariff of 1842--which had repaired the dreadful mischief\r\nwrought by the Compromise Act of 1833--and the enactment of the infamous\r\nFree-Trade Tariff of 1846, which blasted the manufacturing and farming\r\nand trade industries of the Country again, as with fire.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the great gold fields of California, and the enormous\r\namount of the precious metal poured by her for many succeeding years\r\ninto the lap of the Nation, alone averted what otherwise would\r\ninevitably have been total ruin.  As it was, in 1860, the National\r\ncredit had sunk to a lower point than ever before in all its history.\r\nIt was confessedly bankrupt, and ruin stalked abroad throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBut while, with rapid pen, the carrying out of that part of the Southern\r\nConspirators' Disunion programme which related to Free-Trade, is thus\r\nbrought again to mind, the other part of that programme, which related\r\nto Slavery, must not be neglected or overlooked.  On this question they\r\nhad determined, as we have seen, to agitate without ceasing--having in\r\nview, primarily, as already hinted, the extension of Slave territory and\r\nthe resulting increase of Slave power in the Land; and, ulteriorly, the\r\nsolidifying of that power, and Disunion of the Republic, with a view to\r\nits conversion into an Oligarchy, if not a Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the struggle over the admission of Missouri as a Slave\r\nState in 1820, under the Missouri Compromise, was to be revived by the\r\nConspirators, at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in 1836--only three years after the failure of Nullification\r\nin South Carolina, the Territory, of Arkansas was forced in as a Slave\r\nState, and simultaneously the Slave-owning henchmen of the Conspirators,\r\npreviously settled there for the purpose, proclaimed the secession from\r\nMexico, and independence, of Texas.  This was quickly followed, in 1844,\r\nby Calhoun's hastily negotiated treaty of annexation with Texas; its\r\nmiscarriage in the Senate; and the Act of March 2, 1845--with its sham\r\ncompromise--consenting to the admission of Texas to the Union of States.\r\n\r\nThen came the War with Mexico; the attempt by means of the Wilmot\r\nproviso to check the growing territorial-greed and rapacity of the\r\nSlave-power; and the acquisition by the United States, of California and\r\nNew Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which brought\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nThen occurred the agitation over the organization of  Territorial\r\ngovernments for Oregon, California, and New Mexico, and the strong\r\neffort to extend to the Pacific Ocean the Missouri-Compromise line of\r\n36  30', and to extend to all future Territorial organizations the\r\nprinciples of that compromise.\r\n\r\nThen came the struggle in 1850, over the admission of California as a\r\nState, and New Mexico and Utah to Territorial organization--ending in\r\nthe passage of Clay's Compromise measures of 1850.\r\n\r\nYet still the Southern Conspirators--whose forces, both in Congress and\r\nout, were now well-disciplined, compacted, solidified, experienced, and\r\nbigotedly enthusiastic and overbearing--were not satisfied.  It was not\r\ntheir intention to be satisfied with anything less than the destruction\r\nof the Union and of our Republican form of Government.  The trouble was\r\nonly beginning, and, so far, almost everything had progressed to their\r\nliking.  The work must proceed.\r\n\r\nIn 1852-3 they commenced the Kansas-Nebraska agitation; and, what with\r\ntheir incessant political and colonizing movements in those Territories;\r\nthe frequent and dreadful atrocities committed by their tools, the\r\nBorder-ruffians; the incessant turmoil created by cruelties to their\r\nFugitive-slaves; their persistent efforts to change the Supreme Court to\r\ntheir notions; these-with the decision and opinion of the Supreme Court\r\nin the Dred Scott case--together worked the Slavery question up to a\r\ndangerous degree of heat, by the year 1858.\r\n\r\nAnd, by 1860--when the people of the Free States, grown sick unto death\r\nof the rule of the Slave-power in the General Government, arose in their\r\npolitical might, and shook off this \"Old Man of the Sea,\" electing,\r\nbeyond cavil and by the Constitutional mode, to the Presidential office,\r\na man who thoroughly represented in himself their conscience, on the one\r\nhand, which instinctively revolted against human Slavery as a wrong\r\ncommitted against the laws of God, and their sense of justice and equity\r\non the other, which would not lightly overlook, or interfere with vested\r\nrights under the Constitution and the laws of man--the Conspirators had\r\nreached the point at which they had been aiming ever since that failure\r\nin 1832 of their first attempt at Disunion, in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThey had now succeeded in irritating both the Free and the Slave-holding\r\nSections of our Country against each other, to an almost unbearable\r\npoint; had solidified the Southern States on the Slavery and Free-Trade\r\nquestions; and at last--the machinations of these same Conspirators\r\nhaving resulted in a split in the Democratic Party, and the election of\r\nthe Republican candidate to the Presidency, as the embodiment of the\r\npreponderating National belief in Freedom and equality to all before the\r\nLaw, with Protection to both Labor and Capital--they also had the\r\npretext for which they had both been praying and scheming and preparing\r\nall those long, long years--they, and some of their fathers before them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too often repeated that to secure a Monarchy, or at least\r\nan Oligarchy, over which the leading Conspirators should rule for life\r\n--whether that Monarchy or that Oligarchy should comprise the States of\r\nthe South by themselves, or all the States on a new basis of Union--was\r\nthe great ultimate aim of the Conspirators; and this could be secured\r\nonly by first disrupting the then existing Republican Union of\r\nRepublican States.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the right of Secession had now long been taught, and had\r\nbecome a part of the Southern Slave-holders' Democratic creed, as fully\r\nas had the desirability of Slavery and Free-Trade--and even many of the\r\nNorthern Democrats, and some Republicans as well, were not much inclined\r\nto dispute, although they cared not to canvass, the point.\r\n\r\nThe programme of action was therefore much the same as had been laid\r\ndown in the first attempt in 1832:--first South Carolina would secede\r\nand declare her independence; then the other Slave States in quick\r\nsuccession would do likewise; then a new Constitution for a solid\r\nSouthern Union; then, if necessary, a brief War to cement it--which\r\nwould end, of course, in the independence of the South at least, but\r\nmore probably in the utter subjugation and humiliation of the Free\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen the time should come, during, or after this War--as come, in their\r\nbelief, it would--for a change in the form of Government, then they\r\ncould seize the first favorable occasion and change it.  At present,\r\nhowever, the cry must be for \"independence.\"  That accomplished, the\r\nrest would be easy.  And until that independence was accomplished, no\r\nterms of any sort, no settlement of any kind, were either to be proposed\r\nor accepted by them.\r\n\r\nThese were their dreams, their ambitions, their plans; and the tenacious\r\ncourage with which they stuck to them \"through thick and thin,\" through\r\nvictory and disaster, were worthy of a better cause.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the pretexts for Secession were \"Slavery\" and\r\n\"Free-Trade\"--both of which were alleged to be jeopardized in the\r\nelection and inauguration of Abraham Lincoln--yet, no sooner had\r\nhostilities commenced between the seceding States and the Union, than\r\nthey declared to the World that their fight was not for Slavery, but for\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nThey dared not acknowledge to the World that they fought for Slavery,\r\nlest the sympathies of the World should be against them.  But it was\r\nwell understood by the Southern masses, as well as the other people of\r\nthe Union, that both Slavery and Free-Trade were involved in the fight\r\n--as much as independence, and the consequent downfall of the Union.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, however, had made up his mind to do all he properly\r\ncould to placate the South.  None knew better than he, the history of\r\nthis Secession movement, as herein described.  None knew better than he,\r\nthe fell purpose and spirit of the Conspirators.  Yet still, his kindly\r\nheart refused to believe that the madness of the Southern leaders was so\r\nfrenzied, and their hatred of Free men, Free labor, and Free\r\ninstitutions, so implacable, that they would wilfully refuse to listen\r\nto reason and ever insist on absolutely inadmissible terms of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of his Administration, he did all that was\r\npossible to mollify their resentment and calm their real or pretended\r\nfears.  Nor was this from any dread or doubt as to what the outcome of\r\nan armed Conflict would be; for, in his speech at Cincinnati, in the\r\nAutumn of 1859, he had said, while addressing himself to Kentuckians and\r\nother Southern men: \"Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as\r\nbrave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a good cause, man\r\nfor man, as any other people living; that you have shown yourselves\r\ncapable of this upon various occasions; but man for man, you are not\r\nbetter than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are of us.\r\nYou will never make much of a hand at whipping us.  If we were fewer in\r\nnumbers than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were equal it\r\nwould likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers, you will\r\nmake nothing by attempting to master us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd early in 1860, in his famous New York Cooper Institute speech he had\r\nsaid \"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let\r\nus, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\"  He plainly\r\nbelieved to the end, that \"right makes might;\" and he believed in the\r\npower of numbers--as also did Napoleon, if we may judge from his famous\r\ndeclaration that \"The God of battles is always on the side of the\r\nheaviest battalions.\"  Yet, so believing, President Lincoln exerted\r\nhimself in all possible ways to mollify the South. His assurances,\r\nhowever, were far from satisfying the Conspirators.  They never had been\r\nsatisfied with anything in the shape of concession.  They never would\r\nbe.  They had been dissatisfied with and had broken all the compacts and\r\ncompromises, and had spit upon all the concessions, of the past; and\r\nnothing would now satisfy them, short of the impossible.\r\n\r\nThey were not satisfied now with Lincoln's promise that the Government\r\nwould not assail them--organized as, by this time, they were into a\r\nso-called Southern \"Confederacy\" of States--and they proceeded accordingly\r\nto assail that Government which would not assail them.  They opened fire\r\non Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nThis was done, as has duly appeared, in the hope that the shedding of\r\nblood would not only draw the States of the Southern Confederacy more\r\nclosely together in their common cause, and prevent the return of any of\r\nthem to their old allegiance, but also to so influence the wavering\r\nallegiance to the Union, of the Border States, as to strengthen that\r\nConfederacy and equivalently weaken that Union, by their Secession.\r\n\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, of the Border States\r\nthat were wavering, were thus gathered into the Confederate fold, by\r\nthis policy of blood-spilling--carried bodily thither, by a desperate\r\nand frenzied minority, against the wishes of a patriotic majority.\r\n\r\nVirginia, especially, was a great accession to the Rebel cause.  She\r\nbrought to it the prestige of her great name.  To secure the active\r\ncooperation of \"staid old Virginia,\" \"the Mother of Statesmen,\" in the\r\nstruggle, was, in the estimation of the Rebels, an assurance of victory\r\nto their cause.  And the Secession of Virginia for a time had a\r\ndepressing influence upon the friends of the Union everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of West Virginia to go with the rest of the State into\r\nRebellion, was, to be sure, some consolation; and the checkmating of the\r\nConspirators' designs to secure to the Confederacy the States of\r\nMaryland, Kentucky and Missouri, helped the confidence of Union men.  In\r\nfact, as long as the National Capital was secure, it was felt that the\r\nUnion was still safe.\r\n\r\nBut while the Confederacy, by the firing upon Fort Sumter, and thus\r\nassailing that Government which Lincoln had promised would not assail\r\nthe Rebels, had gained much in securing the aid of the States mentioned,\r\nyet the Union Cause, by that very act, had gained more.  For the echoes\r\nof the Rebel guns of Fort Moultrie were the signal for such an uprising\r\nof the Patriots of the North and West and Middle States, as, for the\r\nmoment, struck awe to the hearts of Traitors and inspired with courage\r\nand hopefulness the hearts of Union men throughout the Land.\r\n\r\nMoreover it put the Rebels in their proper attitude, in the eyes of the\r\nWorld--as the first aggressors--and thus deprived them, to a certain\r\nextent, of that moral support from the outside which flows from\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nThose echoes were the signal, not only of that call to arms which led to\r\nsuch an uprising, but for the simultaneous calling together of the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress of the United States in Extra Session--the\r\nCongress whose measures ultimately enabled President Lincoln and the\r\nUnion Armies to subdue the Rebellion and save the Union--the Congress\r\nwhose wise and patriotic deliberations resulted in the raising of those\r\ngigantic Armies and Navies, and in supplying the unlimited means,\r\nthrough the Tariff and National Bank Systems and otherwise, by which\r\nthose tremendous Forces could be both created and effectively operated\r\n--the Congress which cooperated with President Lincoln and those Forces in\r\npreparing the way for the destruction of the very corner-stone of the\r\nConfederacy, Slavery itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                  LINCOLN'S TROUBLES AND TEMPTATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels themselves, as has already been noted, by the employment of\r\ntheir Slaves in the construction of earthworks and other fortifications,\r\nand even in battle, at Bull Run and elsewhere, against the Union Forces,\r\nbrought the Thirty-seventh Congress, as well as the Military Commanders,\r\nand the President, to an early consideration of the Slavery question.\r\nBut it was none the less a question to be treated with the utmost\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nThe Union men, as well as the Secession-sympathizers, of Kentucky and\r\nTennessee and Missouri and Maryland, largely believed in Slavery, or at\r\nleast were averse to any interference with it.  These, would not see\r\nthat the right to destroy that unholy Institution could pertain to any\r\nauthority, or be justified by any exigency; much less that, as held by\r\nsome authorities, its existence ceased at the moment when its hands, or\r\nthose of the State in which it had existed, were used to assail the\r\nGeneral Government.\r\n\r\nThey looked with especial suspicion and distrust upon the guarded\r\nutterances of the President upon all questions touching the future of\r\nthe Colored Race.\r\n\r\n     [At Faneuil Hall, Edward Everett is reported to have said, in\r\n     October of 1864:\r\n\r\n     \"It is very doubtful whether any act of the Government of the\r\n     United States was necessary to liberate the Slaves in a State which\r\n     is in Rebellion.  There is much reason for the opinion that, by the\r\n     simple act of levying War against the United States, the relation\r\n     of Slavery was terminated; certainly, so far as concerns the duty\r\n     of the United States to recognize it, or to refrain from\r\n     interfering with it.\r\n\r\n     \"Not being founded on the Law of Nature, and resting solely on\r\n     positive Local Law--and that, not of the United States--as soon as\r\n     it becomes either the motive or pretext of an unjust War against\r\n     the Union--an efficient instrument in the hands of the Rebels for\r\n     carrying on the War--source of Military strength to the Rebellion,\r\n     and of danger to the Government at home and abroad, with the\r\n     additional certainty that, in any event but its abandonment, it\r\n     will continue, in all future time to work these mischiefs, who can\r\n     suppose it is the duty of the United States to continue to\r\n     recognize it.\r\n\r\n     \"To maintain this would be a contradiction in terms.  It would be\r\n     two recognize a right in a Rebel master to employ his Slave in acts\r\n     of Rebellion and Treason, and the duty of the Slave to aid and abet\r\n     his master in the commission of the greatest crime known to the\r\n     Law.  No such absurdity can be admitted; and any citizen of the\r\n     United States, from thee President down, who should, by any overt\r\n     act, recognize the duty of a Slave to obey a Rebel master in a\r\n     hostile operation, would himself be giving aid and comfort to the\r\n     Enemy.\"]\r\n\r\nThey believed that when Fremont issued the General Order-heretofore\r\ngiven in full--in which that General declared that \"The property, real\r\nand personal, of all persons, in the State of Missouri, who shall take\r\nup arms against the United States, or who shall be directly proven to\r\nhave taken an active part with their enemies in the field, is declared\r\nto be confiscated to the public use, and their Slaves, if any they have,\r\nare hereby declared Free men,\" it must have been with the concurrence,\r\nif not at the suggestion, of the President; and, when the President\r\nsubsequently, September 11,1861, made an open Order directing that this\r\nclause of Fremont's General Order, or proclamation, should be \"so\r\nmodified, held, and construed, as to conform to, and not to transcend,\r\nthe provisions on the same subject contained in the Act of Congress\r\nentitled 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary\r\nPurposes,' approved August 6, 1861,\" they still were not satisfied.\r\n\r\n     [The sections of the above Act, bearing upon the matter, are the\r\n     first and fourth, which are in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"That if, during the present or any future insurrection against the\r\n     Government of the United States, after the President of the United\r\n     States shall have declared, by proclamation, that the laws of the\r\n     United States are opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, by\r\n     combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course\r\n     of judicial proceedings, or by the power vested in the marshals by\r\n     law, any person or persons, his, her, or their agent, attorney, or\r\n     employee, shall purchase or acquire, sell or give, any property of\r\n     whatsoever kind or description, with intent to use or employ the\r\n     same, or suffer the same to be used or employed, in aiding,\r\n     abetting, or promoting such insurrection or resistance to the laws,\r\n     or any persons engaged therein; or if any person or persons, being\r\n     the owner or owners of any such property, shall knowingly use or\r\n     employ, or consent to the use or employment of the same as\r\n     aforesaid, all such property is hereby declared to be lawful\r\n     subject of prize and capture wherever found; and it shall be the\r\n     duty of the President of the United States to cause the same to be\r\n     seized, confiscated and condemned.\"\r\n\r\n                     *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4.

It did not satisfy them.\r\n\r\nNeither had they been satisfied, when, within one year and four days\r\nafter \"Slavery opened its batteries of Treason, upon Fort Sumter,\" that\r\nNational curse and shame was banished from the Nation's Capital by\r\nCongressional enactment.\r\n\r\nThey were not satisfied even with Mr. Lincoln's conservative suggestions\r\nembodied in the Supplemental Act.\r\n\r\nNor were they satisfied with the General Instructions, of October 14,\r\n1861, from the War Department to its Generals, touching the employment\r\nof Fugitive Slaves within the Union Lines, and the assurance of just\r\ncompensation to loyal masters, therein contained, although all avoidable\r\ninterference with the Institution was therein reprobated.\r\n\r\nNothing satisfied them.  It was indeed one of the most curious of the\r\nmany phenomena of the War of the Rebellion, that when--as at the end of\r\n1861--it had become evident, as Secretary Cameron held, that it \"would\r\nbe National suicide\" to leave the Rebels in \"peaceful and secure\r\npossession of Slave Property, more valuable and efficient to them for\r\nWar, than forage, cotton, and Military stores,\" and that the Slaves\r\ncoming within our lines could not \"be held by the Government as Slaves,\"\r\nand should not be held as prisoners of War--still the loyal people of\r\nthese Border-States, could not bring themselves to save that Union,\r\nwhich they professed to love, by legislation on this tender subject.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, they opposed all legislation looking to any\r\ninterference with such Slave property.  Nothing that was proposed by Mr.\r\nLincoln, or any other, on this subject, could satisfy them.\r\n\r\nCongress enacted a law, approved March 13, 1862, embracing an additional\r\nArticle of War, which prohibited all officers \"from employing any of the\r\nforces under their respective Commands for the purpose of returning\r\nFugitives from Service or Labor who may have escaped from\r\nany persons to whom such Service or Labor is claimed to be due,\" and\r\nprescribed that \"Any officer who shall be found guilty by Court-Martial\r\nof violating this Article shall be dismissed from the Service.\" In both\r\nHouses, the loyal Border-State Representatives spoke and voted against\r\nits passage.\r\n\r\nOne week previously (March 6, 1862), President Lincoln, in an admirable\r\nMessage, hitherto herein given at length, found himself driven to broach\r\nto Congress the subject of Emancipation.  He had, in his First Annual\r\nMessage (December, 1861), declared that \"the Union must be preserved;\r\nand hence all indispensable means must be employed;\" but now, as a part\r\nof the War Policy, he proposed to Congress the adoption of a Joint\r\nResolution declaring \"That the United States ought to cooperate with any\r\nState which may adopt gradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such\r\nState, pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its discretion, to\r\ncompensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\nchange of System.\"\r\n\r\nIt was high time, he thought, that the idea of a gradual, compensated\r\nEmancipation, should begin to occupy the minds of those interested, \"so\r\nthat,\" to use his own words, \"they may begin to consider whether to\r\naccept or reject it,\" should Congress approve the suggestion.\r\n\r\nCongress did approve, and adopt, the Joint-Resolution, as we know\r\n--despite the opposition from the loyal element of the Border States--an\r\nopposition made in the teeth of their concession that Mr. Lincoln, in\r\nrecommending its adoption, was \"solely moved by a high patriotism and\r\nsincere devotion to the glory of his Country.\"\r\n\r\nBut, consistently with their usual course, they went to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, fresh from the Presidential presence, and, with their\r\nears still ringing with the common-sense utterances of the President,\r\nhalf of them voted against the Resolution, while the other half\r\nrefrained from voting at all.  And their opposition to this wise and\r\nmoderate proposition was mainly based upon the idea that it carried with\r\nit a threat--a covert threat.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a warning, taking it in connection with the balance of\r\nthe Message, but a very wise and timely one.\r\n\r\nThese loyal Border-State men, however, could not see its wisdom, and at\r\na full meeting held upon the subject decided to oppose it, as they\r\nafterward did.  Its conciliatory spirit they could not comprehend; the\r\nkindly, temperate warning, they would not heed.  The most moderate of\r\nthem all,--[Mr. Crittenden of Kentucky.]--in the most moderate of his\r\nutterances, could not bring himself to the belief that this Resolution\r\nwas \"a measure exactly suited to the times.\"\r\n\r\n     [And such was the fatuity existing among the Slave-holders of the\r\n     Border States, that not one of those Slave States had wisdom enough\r\n     to take the liberal offer thus made by the General Government, of\r\n     compensation.  They afterward found their Slaves freed without\r\n     compensation.]\r\n\r\nSo, also, one month later, (April 11, 1862), when the Senate Bill\r\nproposing Emancipation in the District of Columbia, was before the\r\nHouse, the same spokesman and leader of the loyal Border-State men\r\nopposed it strenuously as not being suited to the times.  For, he\r\npersuasively protested: \"I do not say that you have not the power; but\r\nwould not that power be, at such a time as this, most unwisely and\r\nindiscreetly exercised.  That is the point.  Of all the times when an\r\nattempt was ever made to carry this measure, is not this the most\r\ninauspicious?  Is it not a time when the measure is most likely to\r\nproduce danger and mischief to the Country at large?  So it seems to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not now, nor would it ever be, the time, to pass this, or any\r\nother measure, touching the Institution of Slavery, likely to benefit\r\nthat Union to which these men professed such love and loyalty.\r\n\r\nTheir opposition, however, to the march of events, was of little avail\r\n--even when backed, as was almost invariably the case, by the other\r\nDemocratic votes from the Free States.  The opposition was obstructive,\r\nbut not effectual.  For this reason it was perhaps the more irritating\r\nto the Republicans, who were anxious to put Slavery where their great\r\nleader, Mr. Lincoln, had long before said it should be placed--\"in\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction.\"\r\n\r\nThis very irritation, however, only served to press such Anti-Slavery\r\nMeasures more rapidly forward.  By the 19th of June, 1862, a Bill \"to\r\nsecure Freedom to all persons within the Territories of the United\r\nStates\"--after a more strenuous fight against it than ever, on the part\r\nof Loyal and Copperhead Democrats, both from the Border and Free\r\nStates,--had passed Congress, and been approved by President Lincoln.\r\nIt provided, in just so many words, \"That, from and after the passage of\r\nthis Act, there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude in\r\nany of the Territories of the United States now existing, or which may\r\nat any time hereafter be formed or acquired by the United States,\r\notherwise than in punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been\r\nduly convicted.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, at last, was the great end and aim, with which Mr. Lincoln\r\nand the Republican Party started out, accomplished.  To repeat his\r\nphrase, Slavery was certainly now in course of ultimate extinction.\r\n\r\nBut since that doctrine had been first enunciated by Mr. Lincoln, events\r\nhad changed the aspect of things.  War had broken out, and the Slaves of\r\nthose engaged in armed Rebellion against the authority of the United\r\nStates Government, had been actually employed, as we have seen, on Rebel\r\nworks and fortifications whose guns were trailed upon the Armies of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the question of Slavery had ceased to be simply whether it\r\nshould be put in course of ultimate extinction, but whether, as a War\r\nMeasure--as a means of weakening the Enemy and strengthening the Union\r\n--the time had not already come to extinguish it, so far, at least, as the\r\nSlaves of those participating in the Rebellion, were concerned.\r\n\r\nCongress, as has been heretofore noted, had already long and heatedly\r\ndebated various propositions referring to Slavery and African\r\nColonization, and had enacted such of them as, in its wisdom, were\r\nconsidered necessary; and was now entering a further stormy period of\r\ncontention upon various other projects touching the Abolition of the\r\nFugitive Slave Laws, the Confiscation of Rebel Property, and the\r\nEmancipation of Slaves--all of which, of course, had been, and would be,\r\nvehemently assailed by the loyal Border-States men and their Free-State\r\nDemocratic allies.\r\n\r\nThis contention proceeded largely upon the lines of construction of that\r\nclause in the Constitution of the United States and its Amendments,\r\nwhich provides that no person shall be deprived of Life, Liberty, or\r\nProperty, without due process of Law, etc.  The one side holding that,\r\nsince the beginning of our Government, Slaves had been, under this\r\nclause, Unconstitutionally deprived of their Liberty; the other side\r\nholding that Slaves being \"property,\" it would be Unconstitutional under\r\nthe same clause, to deprive the Slave-owner of his Slave property.\r\n\r\nMr. Crittenden, the leader of the loyal Border-States men in Congress,\r\nwas at this time especially eloquent on this latter view of the\r\nConstitution.  In his speech of April 23, 1862, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, he even undertook to defend American Slavery under the\r\nshield of English Liberty!\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"It is necessary for the prosperity of any Government, for\r\npeace and harmony, that every man who acquires property shall feel that\r\nhe shall be protected in the enjoyment of it, and in his right to hold\r\nit.  It elevates the man; it gives him a feeling of dignity.  It is the\r\ngreat old English doctrine of Liberty.  Said Lord Mansfield, the rain\r\nmay beat against the cabin of an Englishman, the snow may penetrate it,\r\nbut the King dare not enter it without the consent of its owner.  That\r\nis the true English spirit.  It is the source of England's power.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"The idea of property is deeply seated in our minds.  By the\r\nEnglish Law and by the American Law you have the right to take the life\r\nof any man who attempts, by violence, to take your property from you.\r\nSo far does the Spirit of these Laws go.  Let us not break down this\r\nidea of property.  It is the animating spirit of the Country.  Indeed it\r\nis the Spirit of Liberty and Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThere was at this time, a growing belief in the minds of these loyal\r\nBorder-States men, that this question of Slavery-abolition was reaching\r\na crisis.  They saw \"the handwriting on the wall,\" but left no stone\r\nunturned to prevent, or at least to avert for a time, the coming\r\ncatastrophe.  They egged Congress, in the language of the distinguished\r\nKentuckian, to \"Let these unnecessary measures alone, for the present;\"\r\nand, as to the President, they now, not only volunteered in his defense,\r\nagainst the attacks of others, but strove also to capture him by their\r\narch flatteries.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\"--said Mr. Crittenden, in one of his most eloquent bursts, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives,--\"it is not my duty, perhaps, to defend the\r\nPresident of the United States.  * * * I voted against Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nopposed him honestly and sincerely; but Mr. Lincoln has won me to his\r\nside.  There is a niche in the Temple of Fame, a niche near to\r\nWashington, which should be occupied by the statue of him who shall,\r\nsave this Country.  Mr. Lincoln has a mighty destiny.  It is for him, if\r\nhe will, to step into that niche.  It is for him to be but President of\r\nthe People of the United States, and there will his statue be.  But, if\r\nhe choose to be, in these times, a mere sectarian and a party man, that\r\nniche will be reserved for some future and better Patriot.  It is in his\r\npower to occupy a place next Washington,--the Founder, and the\r\nPreserver, side by side.  Sir, Mr. Lincoln is no coward.  His not doing\r\nwhat the Constitution forbade him to do, is no proof of his cowardice.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Owen Lovejoy, the fiery Abolitionist, the very next\r\nday after the above remarks of Mr. Crittenden were delivered in the\r\nHouse, made a great speech in reply, taking the position that \"either\r\nSlavery, or the Republic, must perish; and the question for us to decide\r\nis, which shall it be?\"\r\n\r\nHe declared to the House: \"You cannot put down the rebellion and restore\r\nthe Union, without destroying Slavery.\"  He quoted the sublime language\r\nof Curran touching the Spirit of the British Law, which consecrates the\r\nsoil of Britain to the genius of Universal Emancipation,\r\n\r\n     [In these words:\r\n\r\n     \"I speak in the Spirit of the British law, which makes Liberty\r\n     commensurate with, and inseparable from, the British soil; which\r\n     proclaims even to the stranger and the sojourner the moment he sets\r\n     his foot upon British earth, that the ground on which he treads is\r\n     holy, and consecrated by the genius Of UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n     \"No matter in what language his doom may have been pronounced; no\r\n     matter what complexion incompatible with Freedom, an Indian or an\r\n     African sun may have burnt upon him; no matter in what disastrous\r\n     battle his Liberty may have been cloven down; no matter with what\r\n     solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of Slavery; the\r\n     first moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the altar and\r\n     the god sink together in the dust; his Soul walks abroad in her own\r\n     majesty; his Body swells beyond the measure of his chains, that\r\n     burst from around him, and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and\r\n     disenthralled by the irresistible genius of UNIVERSAL\r\n     EMANCIPATION.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd Cowper's verse, wherein the poet says:\r\n\r\n     \"Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n     Receive our air, that moment they are Free,\"\r\n\r\n--and, after expressing his solicitude to have this true of America, as\r\nit already was true of the District of Columbia, he proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Kentucky says he has a niche for Abraham Lincoln.\r\nWhere is it?  He pointed upward!  But, Sir, should the President follow\r\nthe counsels of that gentleman, and become the defender and perpetuator\r\nof human Slavery, he should point downward to some dungeon in the Temple\r\nof Moloch, who feeds on human blood and is surrounded with fires, where\r\nare forged manacles and chains for human limbs--in the crypts and\r\nrecesses of whose Temple, woman is scourged, and man tortured, and\r\noutside whose walls are lying dogs, gorged with human flesh, as Byron\r\ndescribes them stretched around Stamboul.  That is a suitable place for\r\nthe statue of one who would defend and perpetuate human Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then--after saying that \"the friends of American Slavery need not\r\nbeslime the President with their praise.  He is an Anti-Slavery man.  He\r\nhates human Bondage \"--the orator added these glowing words:\r\n\r\n\"I, too, have a niche for Abraham Lincoln; but it is in Freedom's Holy\r\nFane, and not in the blood-besmeared Temple of human Bondage; not\r\nsurrounded by Slaves, fetters and chains, but with the symbols of\r\nFreedom; not dark with Bondage, but radiant with the light of Liberty.\r\nIn that niche he shall stand proudly, nobly, gloriously, with shattered\r\nfetters and broken chains and slave-whips beneath his feet.  If Abraham\r\nLincoln pursues the path, evidently pointed out for him in the\r\nprovidence of God, as I believe he will, then he will occupy the proud\r\nposition I have indicated.  That is a fame worth living for; ay, more,\r\nthat is a fame worth dying for, though that death led through the blood\r\nof Gethsemane and the agony of the Accursed Tree.  That is a fame which\r\nhas glory and honor and immortality and Eternal Life.  Let Abraham\r\nLincoln make himself, as I trust he will, the Emancipator, the\r\nLiberator, as he has the opportunity of doing, and his name shall not\r\nonly be enrolled in this Earthly Temple, but it will be traced on the\r\nliving stones of that Temple which rears itself amid the Thrones and\r\nHierarchies of Heaven, whose top-stone is to be brought in with shouting\r\nof 'Grace, grace unto it!'\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the loyal Border-State men, through their chosen\r\nRepresentative--finding that their steady and unfaltering opposition to\r\nall Mr. Lincoln's propositions, while quite ineffectual, did not serve\r\nby any means to increase his respect for their peculiar kind of loyalty\r\n--offered him posthumous honors and worship if he would but do as they\r\ndesired.  Had they possessed the power, no doubt they would have taken\r\nhim up into an exceeding high mountain and have offered to him all the\r\nKingdoms of the Earth to do their bidding.  But their temptations were\r\nof no avail.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's duty, and inclination alike--no less than the\r\nearnest importunities of the Abolitionists--carried him in the opposite\r\ndirection; but carried him no farther than he thought it safe, and wise,\r\nto go.  For, in whatever he might do on this burning question of\r\nEmancipation, he was determined to secure that adequate support from the\r\nPeople without which even Presidential Proclamations are waste paper.\r\n\r\nBut now, May 9, 1862, was suddenly issued by General Hunter, commanding\r\nthe \"Department of the South,\" comprising Georgia, Florida and South\r\nCarolina, his celebrated Order announcing Martial Law, in those States,\r\nas a Military Necessity, and--as \"Slavery and Martial Law in a Free\r\nCountry are altogether incompatible\"--declaring all Slaves therein,\r\n\"forever Free.\"\r\n\r\nThis second edition, as it were, of Fremont's performance, at once threw\r\nthe loyal Border-State men into a terrible ferment.  Again, they, and\r\ntheir Copperhead and other Democratic friends of the North, meanly\r\nprofessed belief that this was but a part of Mr. Lincoln's programme,\r\nand that his apparent backwardness was the cloak to hide his\r\nAnti-Slavery aggressiveness and insincerity.\r\n\r\nHow hurtful the insinuations, and even direct charges, of the day, made\r\nby these men against President Lincoln, must have been to his honest,\r\nsincere, and sensitive nature, can scarcely be conceived by those who\r\ndid not know him; while, on the other hand, the reckless impatience of\r\nsome of his friends for \"immediate and universal Emancipation,\" and\r\ntheir complaints at his slow progress toward that goal of their hopes,\r\nmust have been equally trying.\r\n\r\nTrue to himself, however, and to the wise conservative course which he\r\nhad marked out, and, thus far, followed, President Lincoln hastened to\r\ndisavow Hunter's action in the premises, by a Proclamation, heretofore\r\ngiven, declaring that no person had been authorized by the United States\r\nGovernment to declare the Slaves of any State, Free; that Hunter's\r\naction in this respect was void; that, as Commander-in-chief he reserved\r\nsolely to himself, the questions, first, as to whether he had the power\r\nto declare the Slaves of any State or States, Free, and, second, whether\r\nthe time and necessity for the exercise of such supposed power had\r\narrived.  And then, as we may remember, he proceeded to cite the\r\nadoption, by overwhelming majorities in Congress, of the Joint\r\nResolution offering pecuniary aid from the National Government to \"any\r\nState which may adopt a gradual abolishment of Slavery;\" and to make a\r\nmost earnest appeal, for support, to the Border-States and to their\r\npeople, as being \"the most interested in the subject matter.\"\r\n\r\nIn his Special Message to Congress,--[Of March 6, 1862.]--recommending\r\nthe passage of that Joint Resolution, he had plainly and emphatically\r\ndeclared himself against sudden Emancipation of Slaves.  He had therein\r\ndistinctly said: \"In my judgment, gradual, and not immediate,\r\nEmancipation, is better for all.\"  And now, in this second appeal of his\r\nto the Border-States men, to patriotically close with the proposal\r\nembraced in that.  Resolution, he said: \"The changes it contemplates\r\nwould come gently as the dews of Heaven, not rending or wrecking\r\nanything.  Will you not embrace it?  So much good has not been done, by\r\none effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it is now\r\nyour high privilege to do!  May the vast future not have to lament that\r\nyou have neglected it!\"\r\n\r\n     [The following letter, from Sumner, shows the impatience of some of\r\n     the President's friends, the confidence he inspired in others\r\n     nearer in his counsels, and how entirely, at this time, his mind\r\n     was absorbed in his project for gradual and compensated\r\n     Emancipation.]\r\n\r\n                         \"SENATE CHAMBER, June 5, 1862.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR.--Your criticism of the President is hasty.  I am\r\n     confident that, if you knew him as I do, you would not make it.  Of\r\n     course the President cannot be held responsible for the\r\n     misfeasances of subordinates, unless adopted or at least tolerated\r\n     by him.  And I am sure that nothing unjust or ungenerous will be\r\n     tolerated, much less adopted, by him.\r\n\r\n     \"I am happy to let you know that he has no sympathy with Stanly in\r\n     his absurd wickedness, closing the schools, nor again in his other\r\n     act of turning our camp into a hunting ground for Slaves.  He\r\n     repudiates both--positively.  The latter point has occupied much of\r\n     his thought; and the newspapers have not gone too far in recording\r\n     his repeated declarations, which I have often heard from his own\r\n     lips, that Slaves finding their way into the National lines are\r\n     never to be Re-enslaved--This is his conviction, expressed without\r\n     reserve.\r\n\r\n     \"Could you have seen the President--as it was my privilege often\r\n     --while he was considering the great questions on which he has\r\n     already acted--the invitation to Emancipation in the States,\r\n     Emancipation in the District of Columbia, and the acknowledgment of\r\n     the Independence of Hayti and Liberia--even your zeal would have\r\n     been satisfied, for you would have felt the sincerity of his\r\n     purpose to do what he could to carry forward the principles of the\r\n     Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n     \"His whole soul was occupied, especially by the first proposition,\r\n     which was peculiarly his own.  In familiar intercourse with him, I\r\n     remember nothing more touching than the earnestness and\r\n     completeness with which he embraced this idea.  To his mind, it was\r\n     just and beneficent, while it promised the sure end of Slavery.  Of\r\n     course, to me, who had already proposed a bridge of gold for the\r\n     retreating fiend, it was most welcome.  Proceeding from the\r\n     President, it must take its place among the great events of\r\n     history.\r\n\r\n     \"If you are disposed to be impatient at any seeming\r\n     shortcomings, think, I pray you, of what has been done in a brief\r\n     period, and from the past discern the sure promise of the future.\r\n     Knowing something of my convictions and of the ardor with which I\r\n     maintain them, you may, perhaps, derive some assurance from my\r\n     confidence; I may say to you, therefore, stand by the\r\n     Administration.  If need be, help it by word and act, but stand by\r\n     it and have faith in it.\r\n\r\n     \"I wish that you really knew the President, and had heard the\r\n     artless expression of his convictions on those questions which\r\n     concern you so deeply.  You might, perhaps, wish that he were less\r\n     cautious, but you would be grateful that he is so true to all that\r\n     you have at heart.  Believe me, therefore, you are wrong, and I\r\n     regret it the more because of my desire to see all our friends\r\n     stand firmly together.\r\n\r\n     \"If I write strongly it is because I feel strongly; for my constant\r\n     and intimate intercourse with the President, beginning with the 4th\r\n     of March, not only binds me peculiarly to his Administration, but\r\n     gives me a personal as well as a political interest in seeing that\r\n     justice is done him.\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me, my dear Sir, with much regard, ever faithfully yours,\r\n                              \"CHARLES SUMNER.\"\r\n\r\nBut stones are not more deaf to entreaty than were the ears of the loyal\r\nBorder-State men and their allies to President Lincoln's renewed appeal.\r\n\"Ephraim\" was \"wedded to his idols.\"\r\n\r\nMcClellan too--immediately after his retreat from the Chickahominy to\r\nthe James River--seized the opportunity afforded by the disasters to our\r\narms, for which he was responsible, to write to President Lincoln a\r\nletter (dated July 7, 1862) in which he admonished him that owing to the\r\n\"critical\" condition of the Army of the Potomac, and the danger of its\r\nbeing \"overwhelmed\" by the Enemy in front, the President must now\r\nsubstantially assume and exercise the powers of a Dictator, or all would\r\nbe lost; that \"neither Confiscation of property * * * nor forcible\r\nAbolition of Slavery, should be contemplated for a moment;\" and that \"A\r\ndeclaration of Radical views, especially upon Slavery, will rapidly\r\ndisintegrate our present Armies.\"\r\n\r\nHarried, and worried, on all sides,--threatened even by the Commander of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac,--it is not surprising, in view of the\r\napparently irreconcilable attitude of the loyal Border-State men to\r\ngradual and compensated Emancipation, that the tension of President\r\nLincoln's mind began to feel a measure of relief in contemplating\r\nMilitary Emancipation in the teeth of all such threats.\r\n\r\nHe had long since made up his mind that the existence of Slavery was not\r\ncompatible with the preservation of the Union.  The only question now\r\nwas, how to get rid of it?  If the worst should come to the worst\r\n--despite McClellan's threat--he would have to risk everything on the turn\r\nof the die--would have to \"play his last card;\" and that \"last card\" was\r\nMilitary Emancipation.  Yet still he disliked to play it.  The time and\r\nnecessity for it had not yet arrived--although he thought he saw them\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n     [In the course of an article in the New York Tribune, August, 1885,\r\n     Hon.  George S.  Boutwell tells of an interview in \"July or early\r\n     in August\" of 1862, with President Lincoln, at which the latter\r\n     read two letters: one from a Louisiana man \"who claimed to be a\r\n     Union man,\" but sought to impress the President with \"the dangers\r\n     and evils of Emancipation;\" the other, Mr. Lincoln's reply to him,\r\n     in which, says Mr. B., \"he used this expression: 'you must not\r\n     expect me to give up this Government without playing my last card.'\r\n     Emancipation was his last card.\"]\r\n\r\nThings were certainly, at this time, sufficiently unpromising to chill\r\nthe sturdiest Patriot's heart.  It is true, we had scored some important\r\nvictories in the West; but in the East, our arms seemed fated to\r\ndisaster after disaster.  Belmont, Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and\r\nPittsburg Landing, were names whose mention made the blood of Patriots\r\nto surge in their veins; and Corinth, too, had fallen.  But in the East,\r\nMcClellan's profitless campaign against Richmond, and especially his\r\ndisastrous \"change of base\" by a \"masterly\" seven days' retreat,\r\ninvolving as many bloody battles, had greatly dispirited all Union men,\r\nand encouraged the Rebels and Rebel-sympathizers to renewed hopes and\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nAnd, as reverses came to the Union Arms, so seemed to grow\r\nproportionately the efforts, on all sides, to force forward, or to stave\r\noff, as the case might be, the great question of the liberation and\r\narming of the Slaves, as a War Measure, under the War powers of the\r\nConstitution.  It was about this time (July 12, 1862) that President\r\nLincoln determined to make a third, and last, attempt to avert the\r\nnecessity for thus emancipating and arming the Slaves.  He invited all\r\nthe Senators and Representatives in Congress from the Border-States, to\r\nan interview at the White House, and made to them the appeal, heretofore\r\nin these pages given at length.\r\n\r\nIt was an earnest, eloquent, wise, kindly, patriotic, fatherly appeal in\r\nbehalf of his old proposition, for a gradual, compensated Emancipation,\r\nby the Slave States, aided by the resources of the National Government.\r\n\r\nAt the very time of making it, he probably had, in his drawer, the rough\r\ndraft of the Proclamation which was soon to give Liberty to all the\r\nColored millions of the Land.\r\n\r\n     [McPherson gives a letter, written from Washington, by Owen Lovejoy\r\n     (Feb. 22, 1864), to Wm. Lloyd Garrison, in which the following\r\n     passage occurs:\r\n\r\n     \"Recurring to the President, there are a great many reports\r\n     concerning him which seem to be reliable and authentic, which,\r\n     after all, are not so.  It was currently reported among the\r\n     Anti-Slavery men of Illinois that the Emancipation Proclamation was\r\n     extorted from him by the outward pressure, and particularly by the\r\n     Delegation from the Christian Convention that met at Chicago.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, the fact is this, as I had it from his own lips: He had\r\n     written the Proclamation in the Summer, as early as June, I think\r\n     --but will not be certain as to the precise time--and called his\r\n     Cabinet together, and informed them he had written it and meant to\r\n     make it, but wanted to read it to them for any criticism or remarks\r\n     as to its features or details.\r\n\r\n     \"After having done so, Mr. Seward suggested whether it would not be\r\n     well for him to withhold its publication until after we had gained\r\n     some substantial advantage in the Field, as at that time we had met\r\n     with many reverses, and it might be considered a cry of despair.\r\n     He told me he thought the suggestion a wise one, and so held on to\r\n     the Proclamation until after the Battle of Antietam.\"]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, however, sufficient evidences exist, to prove that he\r\nmust have been fully aware, at the time of making that appeal to the\r\nsupposed patriotism of these Border-State men, how much, how very much,\r\ndepended on the manner of their reception of it.\r\n\r\nTo him, that meeting was a very solemn and portentous one.  He had\r\nstudied the question long and deeply--not from the standpoint of his own\r\nmere individual feelings and judgment, but from that of fair\r\nConstitutional construction, as interpreted by the light of Natural or\r\nGeneral Law and right reason.  What he sought to impress upon them was,\r\nthat an immediate decision by the Border-States to adopt, and in due\r\ntime carry out, with the financial help of the General Government, a\r\npolicy of gradual Emancipation, would simultaneously solve the two\r\nintimately-blended problems of Slavery-destruction and\r\nUnion-preservation, in the best possible manner for the pockets and\r\nfeelings of the Border-State Slave-holder, and for the other interests\r\nof both Border-State Slave-holder and Slave.\r\n\r\nHis great anxiety was to \"perpetuate,\" as well as to save, to the People\r\nof the World, the imperiled form of Popular Government, and assure to it\r\na happy and a grand future.\r\n\r\nHe begged these Congressmen from the Border-States, to help him carry\r\nout this, his beneficent plan, in the way that was best for all, and\r\nthus at the same time utterly deprive the Rebel Confederacy of that\r\nhope, which still possessed them, of ultimately gathering these States\r\ninto their rebellious fold.  And he very plainly, at the same time,\r\nconfessed that he desired this relief from the Abolition pressure upon\r\nhim, which had been growing more intense ever since he had repudiated\r\nthe Hunter proclamation.\r\n\r\nBut the President's earnest appeal to these loyal Representatives in\r\nCongress from the Border-States, was, as we have seen, in vain.  It\r\nmight as well have been made to actual Rebels, for all the good it did.\r\nFor, a few days afterward, they sent to him a reply signed by more than\r\ntwo-thirds of those present, hitherto given at length in these pages, in\r\nwhich-after loftily sneering at the proposition as \"an interference by\r\nthis Government with a question which peculiarly and exclusively\r\nbelonged to\" their \"respective States, on which they had not sought\r\nadvice or solicited aid,\" throwing doubts upon the Constitutional power\r\nof the General Government to give the financial aid, and undertaking by\r\nstatistics to prove that it would absolutely bankrupt the Government to\r\ngive such aid,--they insultingly declared, in substance, that they could\r\nnot \"trust anything to the contingencies of future legislation,\" and\r\nthat Congress must \"provide sufficient funds\" and place those funds in\r\nthe President's hands for the purpose, before the Border-States and\r\ntheir people would condescend even to \"take this proposition into\r\ncareful consideration, for such decision as in their judgment is\r\ndemanded by their interest, their honor, and their duty to the whole\r\nCountry.\"\r\n\r\nVery different in tone, to be sure, was the minority reply, which, after\r\nstating that \"the leaders of the Southern Rebellion have offered to\r\nabolish Slavery among them as a condition to Foreign Intervention in\r\nfavor of their Independence as a Nation,\" concluded with the terse and\r\nloyal deduction: \"If they can give up Slavery to destroy the Union, we\r\ncan surely ask our people to consider the question of Emancipation to\r\nsave the Union.\"\r\n\r\nBut those who signed this latter reply were few, among the many.\r\nPractically, the Border-State men were a unit against Mr. Lincoln's\r\nproposition, and against its fair consideration by their people.  He\r\nasked for meat, and they gave him a stone.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days before this interview, President Lincoln--alarmed by the\r\nreport of McClellan, that the magnificent Army of the Potomac under his\r\ncommand, which, only three months before, had boasted 161,000 men, had\r\ndwindled down to not more than \"50,000 men left with their colors\"--had\r\nbeen to the front, at Harrison's Landing, on the James river, and,\r\nalthough he had not found things quite so disheartening as he had been\r\nled to believe, yet they were bad enough, for only 86,000 men were found\r\nby him on duty, while 75,000 were unaccounted for--of which number\r\n34,4172 were afterward reported as \"absent by authority.\"\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs, in connection with the fact that McClellan\r\nwas always calling for more troops, undoubtedly had its influence in\r\nbringing Mr. Lincoln's mind to the conviction, hitherto mentioned, of\r\nthe fast-approaching Military necessity for Freeing and Arming the\r\nSlaves.\r\n\r\nIt was to ward this off, if possible, that he had met and appealed to\r\nthe Border-State Representatives.  They had answered him with sneers and\r\ninsults; and nothing was left him but the extreme course of almost\r\nimmediate Emancipation.\r\n\r\nLong and anxiously he had thought over the matter, but the time for\r\naction was at hand.\r\n\r\nAnd now, it cannot be better told, than in President Lincoln's own\r\nwords, as given to the portrait-painter Carpenter, and recorded in the\r\nlatter's, \"Six months in the White House,\" what followed:\r\n\r\n\"It had got to be,\" said he, \"midsummer, 1862.  Things had gone on from\r\nbad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on\r\nthe plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played\r\nour last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game!\r\n\r\n\"I now determined upon the adoption of the Emancipation Policy; and,\r\nwithout consultation with, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared\r\nthe original draft of the Proclamation, and, after much anxious thought,\r\ncalled a Cabinet meeting upon the subject.  This was the last of July,\r\nor the first part of the month of August, 1862.\"  (The exact date he did\r\nnot remember.)\r\n\r\n\"This Cabinet meeting took place, I think, upon a Saturday.  All were\r\npresent, excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at\r\nthe opening of the discussion, but came in subsequently.  I said to the\r\nCabinet, that I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them\r\ntogether to ask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a\r\nProclamation before them; suggestions as to which would be in order,\r\nafter they had heard it read.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lovejoy was in error\" when he stated \"that it excited no comment,\r\nexcepting on the part of Secretary Seward.  Various suggestions were\r\noffered.  Secretary Chase wished the language stronger, in reference to\r\nthe arming of the Blacks.  Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the\r\npolicy, on the ground that it would cost the Administration the fall\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, however, was offered, that I had not already\r\nfully anticipated and settled in my own mind, until Secretary Seward\r\nspoke.  He said in substance: 'Mr. President, I approve of the\r\nProclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue at this\r\njuncture.  The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our\r\nrepeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a\r\nstep.  It may be viewed as the last Measure of an exhausted Government,\r\na cry for help, the Government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia,\r\ninstead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the Government.'\r\n\r\n\"His idea,\" said the President \"was that it would be considered our last\r\nshriek, on the retreat.\" (This was his precise expression.)  \"' Now,'\r\ncontinued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the Measure, I suggest, Sir, that\r\nyou postpone its issue, until you can give it to the Country supported\r\nby Military success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now,\r\nupon the greatest disasters of the War!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln continued: \"The wisdom of the view of the Secretary of\r\nState, struck me with very great force.  It was an aspect of the case\r\nthat, in all my thought upon the subject, I had entirely overlooked.\r\nThe result was that I put the draft of the Proclamation aside, as you do\r\nyour sketch for a picture, waiting for a victory.\"\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to interrupt the President's narration to Mr.\r\nCarpenter, at this point, with a few words touching \"the Military\r\nSituation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter McClellan's inexplicable retreat from before the Rebel Capital\r\n--when, having gained a great victory at Malvern Hills, Richmond would\r\nundoubtedly have been ours, had he but followed it up, instead of\r\nordering his victorious troops to retreat like \"a whipped Army\"--[See\r\nGeneral Hooker's testimony before the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\nWar.]--his recommendation, in the extraordinary letter (of July 7th) to\r\nthe President, for the creation of the office of General-in-Chief, was\r\nadopted, and Halleck, then at Corinth, was ordered East, to fill it.\r\n\r\nPope had previously been called from the West, to take\r\ncommand of the troops covering Washington, comprising some 40,000 men,\r\nknown as the Army of Virginia; and, finding cordial cooperation with\r\nMcClellan impossible, had made a similar suggestion.\r\n\r\nSoon after Halleck's arrival, that General ordered the transfer of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac, from Harrison's Landing to Acquia creek--on the\r\nPotomac--with a view to a new advance upon Richmond, from the\r\nRappahannock river.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being slowly accomplished, Lee, relieved from fears for\r\nRichmond, decided to advance upon Washington, and speedily commenced the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of August, 1862, Stonewall Jackson, leading the Rebel\r\nadvance, had crossed the Rapidan; on the 9th the bloody Battle of Cedar\r\nMountain had been fought with part of Pope's Army; and on the 11th,\r\nJackson had retreated across the Rapidan again.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Pope having retired across the Rappahannock, Lee's Forces,\r\nby flanking Pope's Army, again resumed their Northern advance.  August\r\n28th and 29th witnessed the bloody Battles of Groveton and Gainesville,\r\nVirginia; the 30th saw the defeat of Pope, by Lee, at the second great\r\nBattle of Bull Run, and the falling back of Pope's Army toward\r\nWashington; and the succeeding Battle of Chantilly took place September\r\n1, 1862.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary at this time to even touch upon the causes and\r\nagencies which brought such misfortune to the Union Arms, under Pope.\r\nIt is sufficient to say here, that the disaster of the second Bull Run\r\nwas a dreadful blow to the Union Cause, and correspondingly elated the\r\nRebels.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, in transmitting to the Rebel Congress at Richmond,\r\nLee's victorious announcements, said, in his message: \"From these\r\ndispatches it will be seen that God has again extended His shield over\r\nour patriotic Army, and has blessed the cause of the Confederacy with a\r\nsecond signal victory, on the field already memorable by the gallant\r\nachievement of our troops.\"\r\n\r\nFlushed with victory, but wisely avoiding the fortifications of the\r\nNational Capital, Lee's Forces now swept past Washington; crossed the\r\nPotomac, near Point of Rocks, at its rear; and menaced both the National\r\nCapital and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nYielding to the apparent necessity of the moment, the President again\r\nplaced.  McClellan in command of the Armies about Washington, to wit:\r\nthe Army of the Potomac; Burnside's troops that had come up from North\r\nCarolina; what remained of Pope's Army of Virginia; and the large\r\nreinforcements from fresh levies, constantly and rapidly pouring in.\r\n\r\n     [This was probably about the time of the occurrence of an amusing\r\n     incident, touching Lincoln, McClellan, and the fortifications\r\n     around Washington, afterward told by General J. G. Barnard, then\r\n     Chief of Engineers on the staff of General George B.  McClellan.\r\n     --See New York Tribune, October 21, 1885.  It seems that the\r\n     fortifications having been completed, McClellan invited Mr. Lincoln\r\n     and his Cabinet to inspect them.  \"On the day appointed,\" said\r\n     Barnard, \"the Inspection commenced at Arlington, to the Southwest\r\n     of Washington, and in front of the Enemy.  We followed the line of\r\n     the works southerly, and recrossed the Potomac to the easterly side\r\n     of the river, and continued along the line easterly of Washington\r\n     and into the heaviest of all the fortifications on the northerly\r\n     side of Washington.  When we reached this point the President asked\r\n     General McClellan to explain the necessity of so strong a\r\n     fortification between Washington and the North.\r\n\r\n     \"General McClellan replied: 'Why, Mr. President, according to\r\n     Military Science it is our duty to guard against every possible or\r\n     supposable contingency that may arise.  For example, if under any\r\n     circumstances, however fortuitous, the Enemy, by any chance or\r\n     freak, should, in a last resort, get in behind Washington, in his\r\n     efforts to capture the city, why, there the fort is to defend it.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes, that's so General,' said the President; 'the precaution is\r\n     doubtless a wise one, and I'm glad to get so clear an explanation,\r\n     for it reminds me of an interesting question once discussed for\r\n     several weeks in our Lyceum, or Moot Court, at Springfield, Ill.,\r\n     soon after I began reading law.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Ah!' says General McClellan.  'What question was that, Mr.\r\n     President?'\r\n\r\n     \"'The question,' Mr. Lincoln replied, 'was, \"Why does man have\r\n     breasts?\"' and he added that after many evenings' debate, the\r\n     question was submitted to the presiding Judge, who wisely decided\r\n     'That if under any circumstances, however fortuitous, or by any\r\n     chance or freak, no matter of what nature or by what cause, a man\r\n     should have a baby, there would be the breasts to nurse it.'\"]\r\n\r\nYet, it was not until the 17th of September that the Battle of Antietam\r\nwas fought, and Lee defeated--and then only to be allowed to slip back,\r\nacross the Potomac, on the 18th--McClellan leisurely following him,\r\nacross that river, on the 2nd of November!\r\n\r\n     [Arnold, in his \"Life of Abraham Lincoln,\" says that President\r\n     Lincoln said of him: \"With all his failings as a soldier, McClellan\r\n     is a pleasant and scholarly gentleman.  He is an admirable\r\n     Engineer, but\" he added, \"he seems to have a special talent for a\r\n     stationary Engine.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, McClellan was relieved,--Burnside taking the command,--and\r\nUnion men breathed more freely again.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the subject of Emancipation.  President Lincoln's own\r\nwords have already been given--in conversation with Carpenter--down to\r\nthe reading of the Proclamation to his Cabinet, and Seward's suggestion\r\nto \"wait for a victory\" before issuing it, and how, adopting that\r\nadvice, he laid the Proclamation aside, waiting for a victory.\r\n\r\n\"From time to time,\" said Mr. Lincoln, continuing his narration, \"I\r\nadded or changed a line, touching it up here and there, anxiously\r\nwaiting the progress of events.  Well, the next news we had was of\r\nPope's disaster at Bull Run.  Things looked darker than ever.  Finally,\r\ncame the week of the Battle of Antietam.  I determined to wait no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\"The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on our\r\nside.  I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home (three miles out of\r\nWashington.)  Here I finished writing the second draft of the\r\npreliminary Proclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet\r\ntogether to hear it; and it was published the following Monday.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to note, in this connection, upon the same\r\nauthority, that at the final meeting of the Cabinet prior to this issue\r\nof the Proclamation, when the third paragraph was read, and the words of\r\nthe draft \"will recognize the Freedom of such Persons,\" were reached,\r\nMr. Seward suggested the insertion of the words \"and maintain\" after the\r\nword \"recognize;\" and upon his insistence, the President said, \"the\r\nwords finally went in.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, then, had gone forth the Fiat--telegraphed and read throughout\r\nthe Land, on that memorable 22d of September, 1862--which, with the\r\nsupplemental Proclamation of January 1, 1863, was to bring joy and\r\nFreedom to the millions of Black Bondsmen of the South.\r\n\r\nJust one month before its issue, in answer to Horace Greeley's Open\r\nletter berating him for \"the seeming subserviency\" of his \"policy to the\r\nSlave-holding, Slave up-holding interest,\" etc., President Lincoln had\r\nwritten his famous \"Union letter\" in which he had conservatively said:\r\n\"My paramount object is to save the Union, and not either to save or\r\ndestroy Slavery.  If I could save the Union without freeing any Slave, I\r\nwould do it--and if I could save it by freeing all the Slaves, I would\r\ndo it--and if I could save it by freeing some, and leaving others alone,\r\nI would also do that.\"\r\n\r\nNo one outside of his Cabinet dreamed, at the time he made that answer,\r\nthat the Proclamation of Emancipation was already written, and simply\r\nawaited a turn in the tide of battle for its issue!\r\n\r\nStill less could it have been supposed, when, on the 13th of September\r\n--only two days before Stonewall Jackson had invested, attacked, and\r\ncaptured Harper's Ferry with nearly 12,000 prisoners, 73 cannon, and\r\n13,000 small arms, besides other spoils of War--Mr. Lincoln received the\r\ndeputation from the religious bodies of Chicago, bearing a Memorial for\r\nthe immediate issue of such a Proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe very language of his reply,--where he said to them: \"It is my\r\nearnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter.  And if I\r\ncan learn what it is, I will do it!  These are not, however, the days of\r\nmiracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a\r\ndirect revelation.  I must study the plain physical aspects of the case,\r\nascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and\r\nright\"--when taken in connection with the very strong argument with\r\nwhich he followed it up, against the policy of Emancipation advocated in\r\nthe Memorial, and his intimation that a Proclamation of Emancipation\r\nissued by him \"must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's Bull\r\nagainst the Comet!\"--would almost seem to have been adopted with the\r\nvery object of veiling his real purpose from the public eye, and leaving\r\nthe public mind in doubt.  At all events, it had that effect.\r\n\r\nArnold, in his \"Life of Lincoln,\" says of this time, when General Lee\r\nwas marching Northward toward Pennsylvania, that \"now, the President,\r\nwith that tinge of superstition which ran through his character, 'made,'\r\nas he said, 'a solemn vow to God, that, if Lee was driven back, he would\r\nissue the Proclamation;'\" and, in the light of that statement, the\r\nconcluding words of Mr. Lincoln's reply to the deputation aforesaid:--\"I\r\ncan assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more\r\nthan any other.  Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do,\"\r\n--have a new meaning.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, when issued, was a great surprise, but\r\nwas none the less generally well-received by the Union Armies, and\r\nthroughout the Loyal States of the Union, while, in some of them, its\r\nreception was most enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nIt happened, too, as we have seen, that the Convention of the Governors\r\nof the Loyal States met at Altoona, Penn., on the very day of its\r\npromulgation, and in an address to the President adopted by these loyal\r\nGovernors, they publicly hailed it \"with heartfelt gratitude and\r\nencouraged hope,\" and declared that \"the decision of the President to\r\nstrike at the root of the Rebellion will lend new vigor to efforts, and\r\nnew life and hope to the hearts, of the People.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the loyal Border-States men were dreadfully exercised\r\non the subject; and those of them in the House of Representatives\r\nemphasized their disapproval by their votes, when, on the 11th and 15th\r\nof the following December, Resolutions, respectively denouncing, and\r\nendorsing, \"the policy of Emancipation, as indicated in that\r\nProclamation,\" of September 22, 1862, were offered and voted on.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the loyal Border-States men's bitter opposition, however,\r\nthe Resolution endorsing that policy as a War Measure, and declaring the\r\nProclamation to be \"an exercise of power with proper regard for the\r\nrights of the States and the perpetuity of Free Government,\" as we have\r\nseen, passed the House.\r\n\r\nOf course the Rebels themselves, against whom it was aimed, gnashed\r\ntheir teeth in impotent rage over the Proclamation.  But they lost no\r\ntime in declaring that it was only a proof of what they had always\r\nannounced: that the War was not for the preservation of the American\r\nUnion, but for the destruction of African Slavery, and the spoilation of\r\nthe Southern States.\r\n\r\nThrough their friends and emissaries, in the Border and other Loyal\r\nStates of the Union,--the \"Knights of the Golden Circle,\"--\r\n\r\n     [The \"Knights of the Golden Circle\" was the most extensive of these\r\n     Rebel organizations.  It was \"an auxiliary force to the Rebel\r\n     Army.\"  Its members took an obligation of the most binding\r\n     character, the violation of which was punishable by death, which\r\n     obligation, in the language of another, \"pledged them to use every\r\n     possible means in their power to aid the Rebels to gain their\r\n     Independence; to aid and assist Rebel prisoners to escape; to vote\r\n     for no one for Office who was not opposed to the further\r\n     prosecution of the War; to encourage desertions from the Union\r\n     Army; to protect the Rebels in all things necessary to carry out\r\n     their designs, even to the burning and destroying of towns and\r\n     cities, if necessary to produce the desired result; to give such\r\n     information as they had, at all times, of the movements of our\r\n     Armies, and of the return of soldiers to their homes; and to try\r\n     and prevent their going back to their regiments at the front.\"\r\n\r\n     In other words the duty of the Organization and of its members, was\r\n     to hamper, oppose, and prevent all things possible that were being\r\n     done at any time for the Union Cause, and to encourage, forward,\r\n     and help all things possible in behalf of the Rebel Cause.\r\n\r\n     It was to be a flanking force of the Enemy--a reverse fire--a fire\r\n     in the rear of the Union Army, by Northern men; a powerful\r\n     cooperating force--all the more powerful because secret--operating\r\n     safely because secretly and in silence--and breeding discontent,\r\n     envy, hatred, and other ill feelings wherever possible, in and out\r\n     of Army circles, from the highest to the lowest, at all possible\r\n     times, and on all possible occasions.]\r\n\r\n--the \"Order of American Knights\" or \"Sons of Liberty,\" and other\r\nCopperhead organizations, tainted with more or less of Treason--they\r\nstirred up all the old dregs of Pro-Slavery feeling that could possibly\r\nhe reached; but while the venomous acts and utterances of such\r\norganizations, and the increased and vindictive energy of the armed\r\nRebels themselves, had a tendency to disquiet the public mind with\r\napprehensions as to the result of the Proclamation, and whether, indeed,\r\nMr. Lincoln himself would be able to resist the pressure, and stand up\r\nto his promise of that Supplemental Proclamation which would give\r\ndefiniteness and practical effect to the preliminary one, the masses of\r\nthe people of the Loyal States had faith in him.\r\n\r\nThere was also another element, in chains, at the South, which at this\r\ntime must have been trembling with that mysterious hope of coming\r\nEmancipation for their Race, conveyed so well in Whittier's lines,\r\ncommencing: \"We pray de Lord; he gib us signs, dat some day we be Free\"\r\n--a hope which had long animated them, as of something almost too good\r\nfor them to live to enjoy, but which, as the War progressed, appeared to\r\ngrow nearer and nearer, until now they seemed to see the promised Land,\r\nflowing with milk and honey, its beautiful hills and vales smiling under\r\nthe quickening beams of Freedom's glorious sun.  But ah! should they\r\nenter there?--or must they turn away again into the old wilderness of\r\ntheir Slavery, and this blessed Liberty, almost within their grasp,\r\nmockingly elude them?\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait for an answer.  The 1st of January, 1863,\r\narrived, and with it--as a precious New Year's Gift--came the\r\nSupplemental Proclamation, bearing the sacred boon of Liberty to the\r\nEmancipated millions.\r\n\r\nAt last, at last, no American need blush to stand up and proclaim his\r\nland indeed, and in truth, \"the Land of Freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                            THE ARMED-NEGRO.\r\n\r\nLittle over five months had passed, since the occurrence of the great\r\nevent in the history of the American Nation mentioned in the preceding\r\nChapter, before the Freed Negro, now bearing arms in defense of the\r\nUnion and of his own Freedom, demonstrated at the first attack on Port\r\nHudson the wisdom of emancipating and arming the Slave, as a War\r\nmeasure.  He seemed thoroughly to appreciate and enter into the spirit\r\nof the words; \"who would be Free, himself must strike the blow.\"\r\n\r\nAt the attack (of May 27th, 1863), on Port Hudson, where it held the\r\nright, the \"Black Brigade\" covered itself with glory.\r\n\r\n     At Baton Rouge, before starting for Port Hudson, the color-guard of\r\n     the First Louisiana Regiment--of the Black Brigade--received the\r\n     Regimental flags from their white colonel, (Col. Stafford,) then\r\n     under arrest, in a speech which ended with the injunction:\r\n     \"Color-guard, protect, defend, die for, but do not surrender these\r\n     flags;\" to which Sergeant Planciancois replied: \"Colonel, I will\r\n     bring these colors to you in honor, or report to God the reason\r\n     why!\"  He fell, mortally wounded, in one of the many desperate\r\n     charges at Port Hudson, with his face to the Enemy, and the colors\r\n     in his hand.\r\n\r\nBanks, in his Report, speaking of the Colored regiments, said: \"Their\r\nconduct was heroic.  No troops could be more determined or more daring.\r\nThey made, during the day, three charges upon the batteries of the\r\nEnemy, suffering very heavy losses, and holding their positions at\r\nnightfall with the other troops on the right of our line.  The highest\r\ncommendation is bestowed upon them by all the officers in command on the\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York Times' correspondent said:--\"The deeds of heroism performed\r\nby these Colored men were such as the proudest White men might emulate.\r\nTheir colors are torn to pieces by shot, and literally bespattered by\r\nblood and brains.  The color-sergeant of the 1st Louisiana, on being\r\nmortally wounded (the top of his head taken off by a sixpounder), hugged\r\nthe colors to his breast, when a struggle ensued between the two\r\ncolor-corporals on each side of him, as to who should have the honor of\r\nbearing the sacred standard, and during this generous contention one was\r\nseriously wounded.\"\r\n\r\nSo again, on Sunday the 6th of June following, at Milliken's Bend, where\r\nan African brigade, with 160 men of the 23rd Iowa, although surprised in\r\ncamp by a largely superior force of the Enemy, repulsed him gallantly\r\n--of which action General Grant, in his official Report, said: \"In this\r\nbattle, most of the troops engaged were Africans, who had but little\r\nexperience in the use of fire-arms.  Their conduct is said, however, to\r\nhave been most gallant.\"\r\n\r\nSo, also, in the bloody assault of July 18th, on Fort Wagner, which was\r\nled by the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Regiment with intrepidity, and\r\nwhere they planted, and for some time maintained, their Country's flag\r\non the parapet, until they \"melted away before the Enemy's fire, their\r\nbodies falling down the slope and into the ditch.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from that time on, through the War--at Wilson's Wharf, in the many\r\nbloody charges at Petersburg, at Deep Bottom, at Chapin's Farm, Fair\r\nOaks, and numerous other battle-fields, in Virginia and elsewhere, right\r\ndown to Appomattox--the African soldier fought courageously, fully\r\nvindicating the War-wisdom of Abraham Lincoln in emancipating and arming\r\nthe Race.\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of this New Year's Proclamation of Freedom\r\nunquestionably had a wonderful effect in various ways, upon the outcome\r\nof the War.\r\n\r\nIt cleared away the cobwebs which the arguments of the loyal\r\nBorder-State men, and of the Northern Copperheads and other Disunion\r\nand Pro-Slavery allies of the Rebels were forever weaving for the\r\ndiscouragement, perplexity and ensnarement, of the thoroughly loyal\r\nout-and-out Union men of the Land.  It largely increased our strength in\r\nfighting material.  It brought to us the moral support of the World,\r\nwith the active sympathy of philanthropy's various forces.  And besides,\r\nit correspondingly weakened the Rebels.  Every man thus freed from his\r\nBondage, and mustered into the Union Armies, was not only a gain of one\r\nman on the Union side, but a loss of one man to the Enemy.  It is not,\r\ntherefore, surprising that the Disunion Conspirators--whether at the\r\nSouth or at the North--were furious.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Conspirator, Jefferson Davis, had already, (December 23,\r\n1862,) issued a proclamation of outlawry against General B. F. Butler,\r\nfor arming certain Slaves that had become Free upon entering his lines\r\n--the two last clauses of which provided: \"That all Negro Slaves captured\r\nin arms, be at once delivered over to the Executive authorities of the\r\nrespective States to which they belong, to be dealt with according to\r\nthe laws of said States,\" and \"That the like orders be executed in all\r\ncases with respect to all commissioned Officers of the United States,\r\nwhen found serving in company with said Slaves in insurrection against\r\nthe authorities of the different States of this Confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nHe now called the attention of the Rebel Congress to President Lincoln's\r\ntwo Proclamations of Emancipation, early in January of 1863; and that\r\nBody responded by adopting, on the 1st of May of that year, a\r\nResolution, the character of which was so cold-bloodedly atrocious, that\r\nmodern Civilization might well wonder and Christianity shudder at its\r\npurport.\r\n\r\n     [It was in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, by the Congress of the Confederate States of America, In\r\n     response to the Message of the President, transmitted to Congress\r\n     at the commencement of the present session, That, in the opinion of\r\n     Congress, the commissioned officers of the Enemy ought not to be\r\n     delivered to the authorities of the respective States, as suggested\r\n     in the said Message, but all captives taken by the Confederate\r\n     forces ought to be dealt with and disposed of by the Confederate\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2.--That, in the judgment of Congress, the proclamations of\r\n     the President of the United States, dated respectively September\r\n     22, 1862, and January 1, 1863, and the other measures of the\r\n     Government of the United States and of its authorities, commanders,\r\n     and forces, designed or tending to emancipate slaves in the\r\n     Confederate States, or to abduct such slaves, or to incite them to\r\n     insurrection, or to employ negroes in war against the Confederate\r\n     States, or to overthrow the institution of African Slavery, and\r\n     bring on a servile war in these States, would, if successful,\r\n     produce atrocious consequences, and they are inconsistent with the\r\n     spirit of those usages which, in modern warfare, prevail among\r\n     civilized nations; they may, therefore, be properly and lawfully\r\n     repressed by retaliation.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3.--That in every case wherein, during the present war, any\r\n     violation of the laws or usages of war among civilized nations\r\n     shall be, or has been, done and perpetrated by those acting under\r\n     authority of the Government of the United States, on persons or\r\n     property of citizens of the Confederate States, or of those under\r\n     the protection or in the land or naval service of the Confederate\r\n     States, or of any State of the Confederacy, the President of the\r\n     Confederate States is hereby authorized to cause full and ample\r\n     retaliation to be made for every such violation, in such manner and\r\n     to such extent as he may think proper.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4.--That every white person, being a commissioned officer, or\r\n     acting as such, who, during the present war, shall command negroes\r\n     or mulattoes in arms against the Confederate States, or who shall\r\n     arm, train, organize, or prepare negroes or mulattoes for military\r\n     service against the Confederate States, or who shall voluntarily\r\n     aid negroes or mulattoes in any military enterprise, attack, or\r\n     conflict in such service, shall be deemed as inciting servile\r\n     insurrection, and shall, if captured, be put to death, or be\r\n     otherwise punished at the discretion of the Court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5.--Every person, being a commissioned officer, or acting as\r\n     such in the service of the Enemy, who shall, during the present\r\n     war, excite, attempt to excite, or cause to be excited, a servile\r\n     insurrection, or who shall incite, or cause to be incited, a slave\r\n     to rebel, shall, if captured, be put to death, or be otherwise\r\n     punished at the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 6.--Every person charged with an offense punishable under the\r\n     preceding resolutions shall, during the present war, be tried\r\n     before the military court attached to the army or corps by the\r\n     troops of which he shall have been captured, or by such other\r\n     military court as the President may direct, and in such manner and\r\n     under such regulations as the President shall prescribe;

and for every one Enslaved by the Enemy or sold\r\n     into Slavery, a Rebel soldier shall be placed at hard work on the\r\n     public works, and continued at such labor until the other shall be\r\n     released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of War.\r\n\r\n     \"By order of the Secretary of War.  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.  E. D.\r\n     TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the mere announcement of the decision of our\r\nGovernment to retaliate, would put an instant stop to the barbarous\r\nconduct of the Rebels toward the captured Colored Union troops, but the\r\nhope was vain.  The atrocities continued, and their climax was capped by\r\nthe cold-blooded massacres perpetrated by Forrest's 5,000 Cavalry, after\r\ncapturing Fort Pillow, a short distance above Memphis, on the\r\nMississippi river.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of that Fort comprised less than 600 Union soldiers, about\r\none-half of whom were White, and the balance Black.  These brave fellows\r\ngallantly defended the Fort against eight times their number, from\r\nbefore sunrise until the afternoon, when--having failed to win by fair\r\nmeans, under the Laws of War,--the Enemy treacherously crept up the\r\nravines on either side of the Fort, under cover of flags of truce, and\r\nthen, with a sudden rush, carried it, butchering both Blacks and Whites\r\n--who had thrown away their arms, and were striving to escape--until\r\nnight temporarily put an end to the sanguinary tragedy.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the massacre was completed by the butchery and\r\ntorture of wounded remnants of these brave Union defenders--some being\r\nburied alive, and others nailed to boards, and burned to death.\r\n\r\n     [For full account of these hideous atrocities, see testimony of\r\n     survivors before the Committee on Conduct and Expenditures of the\r\n     War.  (H. R.  Report, No. 65, 1st S.  38th Cong.)]\r\n\r\nAnd all this murderous malignity, for what?--Simply, and only, because\r\none-half of the Patriot victims had Black skins, while the other half\r\nhad dared to fight by the side of the Blacks!\r\n\r\nIn the after-days of the War, the cry with which our Union Black\r\nregiments went into battle:--\"Remember Fort Pillow!\"--inspired them to\r\ndeeds of valor, and struck with terror the hearts of the Enemy.  On many\r\na bloody field, Fort Pillow was avenged.\r\n\r\nIt is a common error to suppose that the first arming of the Black man\r\nwas on the Union side.  The first Black volunteer company was a Rebel\r\none, raised  early in May, 1861, in the city of Memphis, Tenn.; and at\r\nCharleston, S. C., Lynchburg, Va., and Norfolk, Va., large bodies of\r\nFree Negroes volunteered, and were engaged, earlier than that, to do\r\nwork on the Rebel batteries.\r\n\r\nOn June 28th of the same year, the Rebel Legislature of Tennessee passed\r\nan Act not only authorizing the Governor \"to receive into the Military\r\nservice of the State all male Free persons of Color between the ages of\r\nfifteen and fifty, or such number as may be necessary, who may be sound\r\nin mind and body, and capable of actual service,\" but also prescribing\r\n\"That in the event a sufficient number of Free persons of Color to meet\r\nthe wants of the State shall not tender their services, the Governor is\r\nempowered, through the Sheriffs of the different counties, to press such\r\npersons until the requisite number is obtained.\"\r\n\r\nAt a review of Rebel troops, at New Orleans, November 23, 1861, \"One\r\nregiment comprised 1,400 Free Colored men.\"  Vast numbers of both Free\r\nNegroes and Slaves were employed to construct Rebel fortifications\r\nthroughout the War, in all the Rebel States.  And on the 17th of\r\nFebruary, 1864, the Rebel Congress passed an Act which provides in its\r\nfirst section \"That all male Free Negroes * * * resident in the\r\nConfederate States, between the ages of eighteen and fifty years, shall\r\nbe held liable to perform such duties with the Army, or in connection\r\nwith the Military defenses of the Country, in the way of work upon the\r\nfortifications, or in Government works for the production or preparation\r\nof materials of War, or in Military hospitals, as the Secretary of War\r\nor the Commanding General of the Trans-Mississippi Department may, from\r\ntime to time, prescribe:\" while the third section provides that when the\r\nSecretary of War shall \"be unable to procure the service of Slaves in\r\nany Military Department, then he is authorized to impress the services\r\nof as many male Slaves, not to exceed twenty thousand, as may be\r\nrequired, from time to time, to discharge the duties indicated in the\r\nfirst section of the Act.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this Act of, the Rebel Congress was passed only forty days before\r\nthe fiendish massacre of the Union Whites and Blacks who together, at\r\nFort Pillow, were performing for the Union, \"such duties with the Army,\"\r\nand \"in connection with the Military defenses of the Country,\" as had\r\nbeen prescribed for them by their Commanding General!\r\n\r\nUnder any circumstances--and especially under this state of facts\r\n--nothing could excuse or palliate that shocking and disgraceful and\r\nbarbarous crime against humanity; and the human mind is incapable of\r\nunderstanding how such savagery can be accounted for, except upon the\r\ntheory that \"He that nameth Rebellion nameth not a singular, or one only\r\nsin, as is theft, robbery, murder, and such like; but he nameth the\r\nwhole puddle and sink of all sins against God and man; against his\r\ncountry, his countrymen, his children, his kinsfolk, his friends, and\r\nagainst all men universally; all sins against God and all men heaped\r\ntogether, nameth he that nameth Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency of the Rebels, in getting insanely and murderously\r\nfurious over the arming of Negroes for the defense of the imperiled\r\nUnion and the newly gained liberties of the Black Race, when they had\r\nthemselves already armed some of them and made them fight to uphold the\r\nSlave-holders' Rebellion and the continued Enslavement of their race, is\r\nalready plain enough.\r\n\r\n     [The writer is indebted to the courtesy of a prominent South\r\n     Carolinian, for calling his attention to the \"Singular coincidence,\r\n     that a South Carolinian should have proposed in 1778, what was\r\n     executed in 1863-64--the arming of Negroes for achieving their\r\n     Freedom\"--as shown in the following very curious and interesting\r\n     letters written by the brave and gifted Colonel John Laurens, of\r\n     Washington's staff, to his distinguished father:\r\n\r\n                         HEAD QUARTERS, 14th Jan., 1778.\r\n\r\n     I barely hinted to you, my dearest father, my desire to augment the\r\n     Continental forces from an untried source.  I wish I had any\r\n     foundation to ask for an extraordinary addition to those favours\r\n     which I have already received from you.  I would solicit you to\r\n     cede me a number of your able bodied men slaves, instead of leaving\r\n     me a fortune.\r\n\r\n     I would bring about a two-fold good; first I would advance those\r\n     who are unjustly deprived of the rights of mankind to a state which\r\n     would be a proper gradation between abject slavery and perfect\r\n     liberty, and besides I would reinforce the defenders of liberty\r\n     with a number of gallant soldiers.  Men, who have the habit of\r\n     subordination almost indelibly impressed on them, would have one\r\n     very essential qualification of soldiers.  I am persuaded that if I\r\n     could obtain authority for the purpose, I would have a corps of\r\n     such men trained, uniformly clad, equip'd and ready in every\r\n     respect to act at the opening of the next campaign.  The ridicule\r\n     that may be thrown on the color, I despise, because I am sure of\r\n     rendering essential service to my country.\r\n\r\n     I am tired of the languor with which so sacred a war as this is\r\n     carried on.  My circumstances prevent me from writing so long a\r\n     letter as I expected and wish'd to have done on a subject which I\r\n     have much at heart.  I entreat you to give a favorable answer to\r\n                    Your most affectionate\r\n                                   JOHN LAURENS.\r\n\r\n     The Honble Henry Laurens Esq.\r\n     President of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HEAD QUARTERS, 2nd Feb., 1778.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Father:\r\n\r\n     The more I reflect upon the difficulties and delays which are\r\n     likely to attend the completing our Continental regiments, the more\r\n     anxiously is my mind bent upon the scheme, which I lately\r\n     communicated to you.  The obstacles to the execution of it had\r\n     presented themselves to me, but by no means appeared\r\n     insurmountable.  I was aware of having that monstrous popular\r\n     prejudice, open-mouthed against me, of undertaking to transform\r\n     beings almost irrational, into well disciplined soldiers, of being\r\n     obliged to combat the arguments, and perhaps the intrigues, of\r\n     interested persons.  But zeal for the public service, and an ardent\r\n     desire to assert the rights of humanity, determined me to engage in\r\n     this arduous business, with the sanction of your consent.  My own\r\n     perseverance, aided by the countenance of a few virtuous men, will,\r\n     I hope, enable me to accomplish it.\r\n\r\n     You seem to think, my dear father, that men reconciled by long\r\n     habit to the miseries of their condition, would prefer their\r\n     ignominious bonds to the untasted sweets of liberty, especially\r\n     when offer'd upon the terms which I propose.\r\n\r\n     I confess, indeed, that the minds of this unhappy species must be\r\n     debased by a servitude, from which they can hope for no relief but\r\n     death, and that every motive to action but fear, must be nearly\r\n     extinguished in them.  But do you think they are so perfectly\r\n     moulded to their state as to be insensible that a better exists?\r\n     Will the galling comparison between themselves and their masters\r\n     leave them unenlightened in this respect?  Can their self love be\r\n     so totally annihilated as not frequently to induce ardent wishes\r\n     for a change?\r\n\r\n     You will accuse me, perhaps, my dearest friend, of consulting my\r\n     own feelings too much; but I am tempted to believe that this\r\n     trampled people have so much human left in them, as to be capable\r\n     of aspiring to the rights of men by noble exertions, if some friend\r\n     to mankind would point the road, and give them a prospect of\r\n     success.  If I am mistaken in this, I would avail myself, even of\r\n     their weakness, and, conquering one fear by another, produce equal\r\n     good to the public.  You will ask in this view, how do you consult\r\n     the benefit of the slaves?  I answer, that like other men, they are\r\n     creatures of habit.  Their cowardly ideas will be gradually\r\n     effaced, and they will be modified anew.  Their being rescued from\r\n     a state of perpetual humiliation, and being advanced as it were, in\r\n     the scale of being, will compensate the dangers incident to their\r\n     new state.\r\n\r\n     The hope that will spring in each man's mind, respecting his own\r\n     escape, will prevent his being miserable.  Those who fall in battle\r\n     will not lose much; those who survive will obtain their reward.\r\n     Habits of subordination, patience under fatigues, sufferings and\r\n     privations of every kind, are soldierly qualifications, which these\r\n     men possess in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\n     Upon the whole, my dearest friend and father, I hope that my plan\r\n     for serving my country and the oppressed negro race will not appear\r\n     to you the chimera of a young mind, deceived by a false appearance\r\n     of moral beauty, but a laudable sacrifice of private interest, to\r\n     justice and the public good.\r\n\r\n     You say, that my resources would be small, on account of the\r\n     proportion of women and children.  I do not know whether I am\r\n     right, for I speak from impulse, and have not reasoned upon the\r\n     matter.  I say, altho' my plan is at once to give freedom to the\r\n     negroes, and gain soldiers to the states; in case of concurrence, I\r\n     should sacrifice the former interest, and therefore we change the\r\n     women and children for able-bodied men.  The more of these I could\r\n     obtain, the better; but forty might be a good foundation to begin\r\n     upon.\r\n\r\n     It is a pity that some such plan as I propose could not be more\r\n     extensively executed by public authority.  A well-chosen body of\r\n     5,000 black men, properly officer'd, to act as light troops, in\r\n     addition to our present establishment, might give us decisive\r\n     success in the next campaign.\r\n\r\n     I have long deplored the wretched state of these men, and\r\n     considered in their history, the bloody wars excited in Africa, to\r\n     furnish America with slaves--the groans of despairing multitudes,\r\n     toiling for the luxuries of merciless tyrants.\r\n\r\n     I have had the pleasure of conversing with you, sometimes, upon the\r\n     means of restoring them to their rights.  When can it be better\r\n     done, than when their enfranchisement may be made conducive to the\r\n     public good, and be modified, as not to overpower their weak minds?\r\n\r\n     You ask, what is the general's opinion, upon this subject?  He is\r\n     convinced, that the numerous tribes of blacks in the southern parts\r\n     of the continent, offer a resource to us that should not be\r\n     neglected.  With respect to my particular plan, he only objects to\r\n     it, with the arguments of pity for a man who would be less rich\r\n     than he might be.\r\n\r\n     I am obliged, my dearest friend and father, to take my leave for\r\n     the present; you will excuse whatever exceptionable may have\r\n     escaped in the course of my letter, and accept the assurance of\r\n     filial love, and respect of\r\n                         Your\r\n                              JOHN LAURENS]\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be objected that the arming of Negroes by the Rebels was\r\nexceptional and local, and, that otherwise, the Rebels always used their\r\nvolunteer or impressed Negro forces in work upon fortifications and\r\nother unarmed Military Works, and never proposed using them in the clash\r\nof arms, as armed soldiers against armed White men, the contrary is\r\neasily proven.\r\n\r\nIn a message to the Rebel Congress, November 7, 1864, Jefferson Davis\r\nhimself, while dissenting at that time from the policy, advanced by\r\nmany, of \"a general levy and arming of the Slaves, for the duty of\r\nsoldiers,\" none the less declared that \"should the alternative ever be\r\npresented of subjugation, or of the employment of the Slave as a\r\nsoldier, there seems no reason to doubt what should then be our\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, he recommended the employment of forty\r\nthousand Slaves as pioneer and engineer laborers, on the ground that\r\n\"even this limited number, by their preparatory training in intermediate\r\nduties Would form a more valuable reserve force in case of urgency, than\r\nthreefold their number suddenly called from field labor; while a fresh\r\nlevy could, to a certain extent, supply their places in the special\r\nservice\" of pioneer and engineer work; and he undertook to justify the\r\ninconsistency between his present recommendation, and his past attitude,\r\nby declaring that \"A broad, moral distinction exists between the use of\r\nSlaves as soldiers in defense of their homes, and the incitement of the\r\nsame persons to insurrection against their masters, for,\" said he, \"the\r\none is justifiable, if necessary; the other is iniquitous and unworthy\r\nof a civilized people.\"\r\n\r\nSo also, while a Bill for the arming of Slaves was pending before the\r\nRebel Congress early in 1865, General Robert E. Lee wrote, February\r\n18th, from the Headquarters of the Rebel Armies, to Hon. E. Barksdale,\r\nof the Rebel House of Representatives, a communication, in which, after\r\nacknowledging the receipt of a letter from him of February 12th, \"with\r\nreference to the employment of Negroes as soldiers,\" he said: \"I think\r\nthe Measure not only expedient but necessary * * * in my opinion, the\r\nNegroes, under proper circumstances, will make efficient soldiers.  * *\r\n*  I think those who are employed, should be freed.  It would be neither\r\njust nor wise, in my opinion, to require them to remain as Slaves\"\r\n--thus, not only approving the employment of Black Slaves as soldiers, to\r\nfight White Union men, but justifying their Emancipation as a reward for\r\nMilitary service.  And, a few days afterward, that Rebel Congress passed\r\na Bill authorizing Jefferson Davis to take into the Rebel Army as many\r\nNegro Slaves \"as he may deem expedient, for and during the War, to\r\nperform Military service in whatever capacity he may direct,\" and at the\r\nsame time authorizing General Lee to organize them as other \"troops\" are\r\norganized.\r\n\r\n     [This Negro soldier Bill, according to McPherson's Appendix, p.\r\n     611-612, passed both Houses, and was in these words:\r\n\r\n     A Bill to increase the Military Forces of the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n     \"The Congress of the Confederate States of America do Enact, That\r\n     in order to provide additional forces to repel invasion, maintain\r\n     the rightful possession of the Confederate States, secure their\r\n     Independence and preserve their Institutions, the President be and\r\n     he is hereby authorized to ask for and accept from the owners of\r\n     Slaves the services of such number of able-bodied Negro men as he\r\n     may deem expedient for and during the War, to perform Military\r\n     service in whatever capacity he may direct.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2.--That the General-in-Chief be authorized to organize the\r\n     said Slaves into companies, battalions, regiments, and brigades,\r\n     under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of War may\r\n     prescribe, and to be commanded by such officers as the President\r\n     may appoint.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3.--That, while employed in the Service, the said troops\r\n     shall receive the same rations, clothing, and compensation as are\r\n     allowed to other troops in the same branch of the Service.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4.--That if, under the previous sections of this Act, the\r\n     President shall not be able to raise a sufficient number of troops\r\n     to prosecute the War successfully and maintain the Sovereignty of\r\n     the States, and the Independence of the Confederate States, then he\r\n     is hereby authorized to call on each State, whenever he thinks it\r\n     expedient, for her quota of 300,000 troops, in addition to those\r\n     subject to Military service, under existing laws, or so many\r\n     thereof as the President may deem necessary, to be raised from such\r\n     classes of the population, irrespective of color, in each State, as\r\n     the proper authorities thereof may determine: Provided, that not\r\n     more than 25 per cent. of the male Slaves, between the ages of 18\r\n     and 45, in any State, shall be called for under the provisions of\r\n     this Act.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5.--That nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize\r\n     a change in the relation of said Slaves.\"]",
