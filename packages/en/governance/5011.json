This measure it was\r\ndesirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience and\r\na considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants\r\nof this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their\r\nfellow citizens. Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the state\r\nand decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,\r\nnow happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or health of the\r\nmembers, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by law to\r\nmeet. I submit, however, to your consideration whether a power to postpone\r\nthe meeting of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitution\r\nupon such occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.\r\n\r\nAlthough I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in\r\nEurope and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our\r\ncitizens from injustice and violence at sea, we have, nevertheless,\r\nabundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for\r\ninterior tranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons,\r\nprosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvements,\r\nand, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a\r\ncalm but steady determination to support our sovereignty, as well as our\r\nmoral and our religious principles, against all open and secret attacks.\r\n\r\nOur envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked--one in July, the\r\nother in August--to join their colleague in Holland. I have received\r\nintelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland, from whence they\r\nall proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of\r\nSeptember. Whatever may be the result of this mission, I trust that nothing\r\nwill have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion, on such equitable terms as may be compatible with\r\nthe safety, honor and interest of the United States. Nothing, in the mean\r\ntime, will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the\r\nattainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of\r\nwhich on many former occasions the people of the United States have given\r\nsuch memorable proofs, and the exertion of those resources for national\r\ndefense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the\r\nadjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary\r\nmeasures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the\r\nopening of your late extraordinary session. If that system was then\r\nprudent, it is more so now, as increasing depredations strengthen the\r\nreasons for its adoption.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France, and\r\nwhether the war in Europe is or is not to continue, I hold it most certain\r\nthat permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained. The state\r\nof society has so long been disturbed, the sense of moral and religious\r\nobligations so much weakened, public faith and national honor have been so\r\nimpaired, respect to treaties has been so diminished, and the law of\r\nnations has lost so much of its force, while pride, ambition, avarice and\r\nviolence have been so long unrestrained, there remains no reasonable ground\r\non which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or\r\ndefense will not be plundered.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States is essential, if not to their existence,\r\nat least to their comfort, their growth, prosperity, and happiness. The\r\ngenius, character, and habits of the people are highly commercial. Their\r\ncities have been formed and exist upon commerce. Our agriculture,\r\nfisheries, arts, and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it. In\r\nshort, commerce has made this country what it is, and it can not be\r\ndestroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and\r\ndistress. Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation.\r\nThe faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of\r\ncommercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens. Under this\r\nview of our affairs, I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if I\r\nforbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our\r\ncommerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the\r\nonly sure means of preserving both.\r\n\r\nI have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at\r\nthe opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable\r\ninformation of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty\r\nrespecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the\r\ndemarcation of the line of limits, but by the latest authentic intelligence\r\nSpanish garrisons were still continued within our country, and the running\r\nof the boundary line had not been commenced. These circumstances are the\r\nmore to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a manner\r\ninjurious to the United States. Still, however, indulging the hope that the\r\nanswers which have been given will remove the objections offered by the\r\nSpanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty, I have judged it\r\nproper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to run\r\nthe line of limits. Further information on this subject will be\r\ncommunicated in the course of the session.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier\r\nit is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate\r\nthe affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual\r\nhostilities against the United States. Great activity has been exerted by\r\nthose persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes\r\nresiding within the territory of the United States to influence them to\r\ntransfer their affections and force to a foreign nation, to form them into\r\na confederacy, and prepare them for war against the United States. Although\r\nmeasures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights, to\r\nprevent Indian hostilities, and to preserve entire their attachment to the\r\nUnited States, it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to\r\nthese measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such\r\npractices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity,\r\ncommerce, and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to\r\nascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river\r\nSt. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay in\r\n1796 October, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the\r\nadjacent shores and islands, and, being of opinion that actual surveys of\r\nboth rivers to their sources were necessary, gave to the agents of the two\r\nnations instructions for that purpose, and adjourned to meet at Boston in\r\nAugust. They met, but the surveys requiring more time than had been\r\nsupposed, and not being then completed, the commissioners again adjourned,\r\nto meet at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island, in June next, when we\r\nmay expect a final examination and decision.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty\r\nmet at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects\r\nfor debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from\r\ncitizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hitherto\r\nprevented any determinations, but the business is now resumed, and\r\ndoubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.\r\n\r\nSeveral decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses\r\nand damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or\r\ncondemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the\r\ncommissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty. The\r\nsums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government.\r\nA considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages, and not\r\ncaptured property, were the only objects in question, have been decided by\r\narbitration, and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have\r\nalso been paid.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty\r\nwith Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on\r\nthe claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of\r\ntheir vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic\r\nMajesty during the late war between Spain and France. Their sittings have\r\nbeen interrupted, but are now resumed.\r\n\r\nThe United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and\r\ndamages sustained by British subjects, upon the award of the commissioners\r\nacting under the 6th article of the treaty with Great Britain, and for the\r\nlosses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture\r\nof their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdiction\r\nof the United States and brought into their ports, or taken by vessels\r\noriginally armed in ports of the United States, upon the awards of the\r\ncommissioners acting under the 7th article of the same treaty, it is\r\nnecessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations.\r\n\r\nThe numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French\r\nRepublic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable\r\nexpenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their\r\ntribunals. The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been\r\ndisbursed by the consuls of the United States. By means of the same\r\ncaptures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign\r\ncountries, destitute of all means of subsistence, and the sick in\r\nparticular have been exposed to grievous sufferings. The consuls have in\r\nthese cases also advanced moneys for their relief. For these advances they\r\nreasonably expect reimbursements from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment. The\r\nprovisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are\r\nfound to be inadequate and ineffectual. Another provision seems necessary\r\nto be added to the consular act. Some foreign vessels have been discovered\r\nsailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers. It\r\nseldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception, because they\r\nhave no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects\r\nwhich by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere--the\r\nnational debts and taxes.\r\n\r\nSince the decay of the feudal system, by which the public defense was\r\nprovided for chiefly at the expense of individuals, the system of loans has\r\nbeen introduced, and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes\r\nsufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war the\r\nsums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of\r\nwhat have been called funding systems. The consequences arising from the\r\ncontinual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish\r\nus to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. The national defense\r\nmust be provided for as well as the support of Government; but both should\r\nbe accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes, and as little as\r\npossible by loans.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction be\r\nlaid before you.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWe are met together at a most interesting period. The situations of the\r\nprincipal powers of Europe are singular and portentous. Connected with some\r\nby treaties and with all by commerce, no important event there can be\r\nindifferent to us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not\r\nless for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor,\r\nsafety, and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of\r\nwisdom and firmness.\r\n\r\nIn all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn Adams\r\nDecember 8, 1798\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWhile with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensations of\r\nDivine Providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which\r\nseveral of our cities and towns have been visited, there is cause for\r\ngratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared and\r\nthat we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the seat of Government\r\nfor the discharge of our important duties. But when we reflect that this\r\nfatal disorder has within a few years made repeated ravages in some of our\r\nprincipal sea ports, and with increased malignancy, and when we consider\r\nthe magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and\r\nprivate business, whereby the national interests are deeply affected, I\r\nthink it my duty to invite the Legislature of the Union to examine the\r\nexpediency of establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws\r\nof the respective States; for these being formed on the idea that\r\ncontagious sickness may be communicated through the channels of commerce,\r\nthere seems to be a necessity that Congress, who alone can regulate trade,\r\nshould frame a system which, while it may tend to preserve the general\r\nhealth, may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of\r\nthe revenue.\r\n\r\nWhile we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate\r\nsufferers, we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Being our\r\nannual oblations of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary\r\nblessings of His providence. To the usual subjects of gratitude I can not\r\nomit to add one of the first importance to our well being and safety; I mean\r\nthat spirit which has arisen in our country against the menaces and\r\naggression of a foreign nation. A manly sense of national honor, dignity,\r\nand independence has appeared which, if encouraged and invigorated by every\r\nbranch of the Government, will enable us to view undismayed the enterprises\r\nof any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity\r\nand glory.\r\n\r\nThe course of the transactions in relation to the United States and France\r\nwhich have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made the subject\r\nof a future communication. That communication will confirm the ultimate\r\nfailure of the measures which have been taken by the Government of the\r\nUnited States toward an amicable adjustment of differences with that power.\r\nYou will at the same time perceive that the French Government appears\r\nsolicitous to impress the opinion that it is averse to a rupture with this\r\ncountry, and that it has in a qualified manner declared itself willing to\r\nreceive a minister from the United States for the purpose of restoring a\r\ngood understanding. It is unfortunate for professions of this kind that\r\nthey should be expressed in terms which may countenance the inadmissible\r\npretension of a right to prescribe the qualifications which a minister from\r\nthe United States should possess, and that while France is asserting the\r\nexistence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the\r\ndifferences which have arisen, the sincerity of a like disposition on the\r\npart of the United States, of which so many demonstrative proofs have been\r\ngiven, should even be indirectly questioned.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of observation that the decree of the Directory alleged\r\nto be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruisers on our\r\ncommerce has not given, and can not give, any relief. It enjoins them to\r\nconform to all the laws of France relative to cruising and prizes, while\r\nthese laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have\r\nso long, so justly, and so fruitlessly complained.\r\n\r\nThe law of France enacted in January last, which subjects to capture and\r\ncondemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter\r\nare of British fabric or produce, although the entire property belong to\r\nneutrals, instead of being rescinded has lately received a confirmation by\r\nthe failure of a proposition for its repeal. While this law, which is an\r\nunequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks, continues\r\nin force those nations can see in the French Government only a power\r\nregardless of their essential rights, of their independence and\r\nsovereignty; and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with\r\ntheir interest and honor but a firm resistance.\r\n\r\nHitherto, therefore, nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France which\r\nought to change or relax our measures of defense. On the contrary, to\r\nextend and invigorate them is our true policy. We have no reason to regret\r\nthat these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued, and in\r\nproportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable\r\nsituation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the full\r\ndevelopment of our energies and resources.\r\n\r\nBut in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the\r\nnecessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room to infer\r\nthat we abandon the desire of peace. An efficient preparation for war can\r\nalone insure peace. It is peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly\r\ncultivated, and harmony between us and France may be restored at her\r\noption. But to send another minister without more determinate assurances\r\nthat he would be received would be an act of humiliation to which the\r\nUnited States ought not to submit. It must therefore be left with France\r\n(if she is indeed desirous of accommodation) to take the requisite steps.\r\n\r\nThe United States will steadily observe the maxims by which they have\r\nhitherto been governed. They will respect the sacred rights of embassy; and\r\nwith a sincere disposition on the part of France to desist from hostility,\r\nto make reparation for the injuries heretofore inflicted on our commerce,\r\nand to do justice in future, there will be no obstacle to the restoration\r\nof a friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\nIn making to you this declaration I give a pledge to France and the world\r\nthat the Executive authority of this country still adheres to the humane\r\nand pacific policy which has invariably governed its proceedings, in\r\nconformity with the wishes of the other branches of the Government and of\r\nthe people of the United States. But considering the late manifestations of\r\nher policy toward foreign nations, I deem it a duty deliberately and\r\nsolemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with her or not,\r\nvigorous preparations for war will be alike indispensable. These alone will\r\ngive to us an equal treaty and insure its observance.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures of preparation which appear expedient, I take the\r\nliberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment. The beneficial\r\neffects of the small naval armament provided under the acts of the last\r\nsession are known and acknowledged. Perhaps no country ever experienced\r\nmore sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we\r\nhave derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense.\r\n\r\nWe ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our\r\nNavy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade. Such a\r\nnaval force as it is doubtless in the power of the United States to create\r\nand maintain would also afford to them the best means of general defense by\r\nfacilitating the safe transportation of troops and stores to every part of\r\nour extensive coast. To accomplish this important object, a prudent\r\nforesight requires that systematic measures be adopted for procuring at all\r\ntimes the requisite timber and other supplies. In what manner this shall be\r\ndone I leave to your consideration.\r\n\r\nI will now advert, gentlemen, to some matters of less moment, but proper to\r\nbe communicated to the National Legislature.\r\n\r\nAfter the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the\r\nNatchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commences\r\nhis observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which\r\nterminated the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude. From\r\nthence he proceeded to run the boundary line between the United States and\r\nSpain. He was afterwards joined by the Spanish commissioner, when the work\r\nof the former was confirmed, and they proceeded together to the demarcation\r\nof the line.\r\n\r\nRecent information renders it probable that the Southern Indians, either\r\ninstigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of\r\nsuffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title\r\nhad not been extinguished, have ere this time stopped the progress of the\r\ncommissioners; and considering the mischiefs which may result from\r\ncontinuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes,\r\nthe great expense attending it, and that the boundaries which the\r\ncommissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as\r\nthe Indian title has been extinguished, it will perhaps become expedient\r\nand necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty\r\nof amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and His\r\nBritannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under the name\r\nof the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, and forming a part\r\nof the boundary therein described, have finally decided that question. On\r\nthe 25th of October they made their declaration that a river called\r\nScoodiac, which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its northwestern quarter,\r\nwas the true St. Croix intended in the treaty of peace, as far as its great\r\nfork, where one of its streams comes from the westward and the other from\r\nthe northward, and that the latter stream is the continuation of the St.\r\nCroix to its source.\r\n\r\nThis decision, it is understood, will preclude all contention among the\r\nindividual claimants, as it seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch\r\nbound the grants of land which have been made by the respective adjoining\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nA subordinate question, however, it has been suggested, still remains to be\r\ndetermined. Between the mouth of the St. Croix as now settled and what is\r\nusually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable islands. The\r\ncommissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of\r\nthese islands, and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of\r\nFundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary, but it is\r\napprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty.\r\n\r\nSuch progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of\r\ncaptures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of\r\nthe 7th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the commissioners\r\nwill be able to bring their business to a conclusion in August of the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners acting under the 25th article of the treaty between the\r\nUnited States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of our citizens\r\nfor losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having\r\nbeen taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war\r\nbetween France and Spain.\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law for\r\naugmenting the military establishment, among these the desire of obtaining\r\nthe fullest information to direct the best selection of officers. As this\r\nobject will now be speedily accomplished, it is expected that the raising\r\nand organizing of the troops will proceed without obstacle and with\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary\r\nfor the service of the ensuing year to be laid before you, accompanied with\r\na view of the public receipts and expenditures to a recent period.\r\n\r\nIt will afford you satisfaction to infer the great extent and solidity of\r\nthe public resources from the prosperous state of the finances,\r\nnotwithstanding the unexampled embarrassments which have attended commerce.\r\nWhen you reflect on the conspicuous examples of patriotism and liberality\r\nwhich have been exhibited by our mercantile fellow citizens, and how great\r\na proportion of the public resources depends on their enterprise, you will\r\nnaturally consider whether their convenience can not be promoted and\r\nreconciled with the security of the revenue by a revision of the system by\r\nwhich the collection is at present regulated.\r\n\r\nDuring your recess measures have been steadily pursued for effecting the\r\nvaluations and returns directed by the act of the last session, preliminary\r\nto the assessment and collection of a direct tax. No other delays or\r\nobstacles have been experienced except such as were expected to arise from\r\nthe great extent of our country and the magnitude and novelty of the\r\noperation, and enough has been accomplished to assure a fulfillment of the\r\nviews of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI can not close this address without once more adverting to our political\r\nsituation and inculcating the essential importance of uniting in the\r\nmaintenance of our dearest interests; and I trust that by the temper and\r\nwisdom of your proceedings and by a harmony of measures we shall secure to\r\nour country that weight and respect to which it is so justly entitled.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn Adams\r\nDecember 3, 1799\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIt is with peculiar satisfaction that I meet the 6th Congress of the United\r\nStates of America. Coming from all parts of the Union at this critical and\r\ninteresting period, the members must be fully possessed of the sentiments\r\nand wishes of our constituents.\r\n\r\nThe flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land\r\nand by sea; the prosperity of our extended commerce, notwithstanding\r\ninterruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the\r\nworld; the return of health, industry, and trade to those cities which have\r\nlately been afflicted with disease, and the various and inestimable\r\nadvantages, civil and religious, which, secured under our happy frame of\r\ngovernment, are continued to us unimpaired, demand of the whole American\r\npeople sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity for the merciful dispensations\r\nof His providence.\r\n\r\nBut while these numerous blessings are recollected, it is a painful duty to\r\nadvert to the ungrateful return which has been made for them by some of the\r\npeople in certain counties of Pennsylvania, where, seduced by the arts and\r\nmisrepresentations of designing men, they have openly resisted the law\r\ndirecting the valuation of houses and lands. Such defiance was given to the\r\ncivil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts by judicial\r\nprocess to enforce the execution of the law, and it became necessary to\r\ndirect a military force to be employed, consisting of some companies of\r\nregular troops, volunteers, and militia, by whose zeal and activity, in\r\ncooperation with the judicial power, order and submission were restored and\r\nmany of the offenders arrested. Of these, some have been convicted of\r\nmisdemeanors, and others, charged with various crimes, remain to be tried.\r\n\r\nTo give due effect to the civil administration of Government and to insure\r\na just execution of the laws, a revision and amendment of the judiciary\r\nsystem is indispensably necessary. In this extensive country it can not but\r\nhappen that numerous questions respecting the interpretation of the laws\r\nand the rights and duties of officers and citizens must arise. On the one\r\nhand, the laws should be executed; on the other, individuals should be\r\nguarded from oppression. Neither of these objects is sufficiently assured\r\nunder the present organization of the judicial department. I therefore\r\nearnestly recommend the subject to your serious consideration.\r\n\r\nPersevering in the pacific and humane policy which had been invariably\r\nprofessed and sincerely pursued by the Executive authority of the United\r\nStates, when indications were made on the part of the French Republic of a\r\ndisposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two\r\ncountries, I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances by\r\na nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of our\r\ncountry dictated, and which its moderation had given it a right to\r\nprescribe.\r\n\r\nThe assurances which were required of the French Government previous to the\r\ndeparture of our envoys have been given through their minister of foreign\r\nrelations, and I have directed them to proceed on their mission to Paris.\r\nThey have full power to conclude a treaty, subject to the constitutional\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate. The characters of these gentlemen are\r\nsure pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with its honor or\r\ninterest, nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or\r\nfriendship to any other nation, will be stipulated.\r\n\r\nIt appearing probable from the information I received that our commercial\r\nintercourse with some ports in the island of St. Domingo might safely be\r\nrenewed, I took such steps as seemed to me expedient to ascertain that\r\npoint. The result being satisfactory, I then, in conformity with the act of\r\nCongress on the subject, directed the restraints and prohibitions of that\r\nintercourse to be discontinued on terms which were made known by\r\nproclamation. Since the renewal of this intercourse our citizens trading to\r\nthose ports, with their property, have been duly respected, and\r\nprivateering from those ports has ceased.\r\n\r\nIn examining the claims of British subjects by the commissioners at\r\nPhiladelphia, acting under the 6th article of the treaty of amity,\r\ncommerce, and navigation with Great Britain, a difference of opinion on\r\npoints deemed essential in the interpretation of that article has arisen\r\nbetween the commissioners appointed by the United States and the other\r\nmembers of that board, from which the former have thought it their duty to\r\nwithdraw. It is sincerely to be regretted that the execution of an article\r\nproduced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice should have been thus\r\nunavoidably interrupted. It is, however, confidently expected that the same\r\nspirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated will\r\nlead to satisfactory explanations.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the obstacles to the progress of the commission in\r\nPhiladelphia, His Britannic Majesty has directed the commissioners\r\nappointed by him under the 7th article of the treaty relating to the\r\nBritish captures of American vessels to withdraw from the board sitting in\r\nLondon, but with the express declaration of his determination to fulfill\r\nwith punctuality and good faith the engagements which His Majesty has\r\ncontracted by his treaty with the United States, and that they will be\r\ninstructed to resume their functions whenever the obstacles which impede\r\nthe progress of the commission at Philadelphia shall be removed. It being\r\nin like manner my sincere determination, so far as the same depends on me,\r\nthat with equal punctuality and good faith the engagements contracted by\r\nthe United States in their treaties with His Britannic Majesty shall be\r\nfulfilled, I shall immediately instruct our minister at London to endeavor\r\nto obtain the explanation necessary to a just performance of those\r\nengagements on the part of the United States. With such dispositions on\r\nboth sides, I can not entertain a doubt that all difficulties will soon be\r\nremoved and that the two boards will then proceed and bring the business\r\ncommitted to them respectively to a satisfactory conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress relative to the seat of the Government of the United\r\nStates requiring that on the 1st Monday of December next it should be\r\ntransferred from Philadelphia to the District chosen for its permanent\r\nseat, it is proper for me to inform you that the commissioners appointed to\r\nprovide suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the\r\nPresident and of the public offices of the Government have made a report of\r\nthe state of the buildings designed for those purposes in the city of\r\nWashington, from which they conclude that the removal of the seat of\r\nGovernment to that place at the time required will be practicable and the\r\naccommodation satisfactory. Their report will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the\r\nservice of the ensuing year, together with an account of the revenue and\r\nexpenditure, to be laid before you. During a period in which a great\r\nportion of the civilized world has been involved in a war unusually\r\ncalamitous and destructive, it was not to be expected that the United\r\nStates could be exempted from extraordinary burthens. Although the period\r\nis not arrived when the measures adopted to secure our country against\r\nforeign attacks can be renounced, yet it is alike necessary for the honor\r\nof the Government and the satisfaction of the community that an exact\r\neconomy should be maintained. I invite you, gentlemen, to investigate the\r\ndifferent branches of the public expenditure. The examination will lead to\r\nbeneficial retrenchments or produce a conviction of the wisdom of the\r\nmeasures to which the expenditure relates.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAt a period like the present, when momentous changes are occurring and\r\nevery hour is preparing new and great events in the political world, when a\r\nspirit of war is prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the\r\ninterests of the United States have any connection, unsafe and precarious\r\nwould be our situation were we to neglect the means of maintaining our just\r\nrights. The result of the mission to France is uncertain; but however it\r\nmay terminate, a steady perseverance in a system of national defense\r\ncommensurate with our resources and the situation of our country is an\r\nobvious dictate of wisdom; for, remotely as we are placed from the\r\nbelligerent nations, and desirous as we are, by doing justice to all, to\r\navoid offense to any, nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions\r\nwill secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities\r\nof war or national degradation. As to myself, it is my anxious desire so to\r\nexecute the trust reposed in me as to render the people of the United\r\nStates prosperous and happy. I rely with entire confidence on your\r\ncooperation in objects equally your care, and that our mutual labors will\r\nserve to increase and confirm union among our fellow citizens and an\r\nunshaken attachment to our Government.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn Adams\r\nNovember 11, 1800\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adjournment of Congress at their last session in\r\nPhiladelphia I gave directions, in compliance with the laws, for the\r\nremoval of the public offices, records, and property. These directions have\r\nbeen executed, and the public officers have since resided and conducted the\r\nordinary business of the Government in this place.\r\n\r\nI congratulate the people of the United States on the assembling of\r\nCongress at the permanent seat of their Government, and I congratulate you,\r\ngentlemen, on the prospect of a residence not to be changed. Although there\r\nis cause to apprehend that accommodations are not now so complete as might\r\nbe wished, yet there is great reason to believe that this inconvenience\r\nwill cease with the present session.\r\n\r\nIt would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to assemble for\r\nthe first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the Supreme\r\nRuler of the Universe and imploring His blessing.\r\n\r\nMay this territory be the residence of virtue and happiness! In this city\r\nmay that piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnanimity, that constancy and\r\nself-government, which adorned the great character whose name it bears be\r\nforever held in veneration! Here and throughout our country may simple\r\nmanners, pure morals, and true religion flourish forever!\r\n\r\nIt is with you, gentlemen, to consider whether the local powers over the\r\nDistrict of Columbia vested by the Constitution in the Congress of the\r\nUnited States shall be immediately exercised. If in your opinion this\r\nimportant trust ought now to be executed, you can not fail while performing\r\nit to take into view the future probable situation of the territory for the\r\nhappiness of which you are about to provide. You will consider it as the\r\ncapital of a great nation advancing with unexampled rapidity in arts, in\r\ncommerce, in wealth, and in population, and possessing within itself those\r\nenergies and resources which, if not thrown away or lamentably misdirected,\r\nwill secure to it a long course of prosperity and self-government.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a law of the last session of Congress, the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the temporary army have been discharged. It affords real\r\npleasure to recollect the honorable testimony they gave of the patriotic\r\nmotives which brought them into the service of their country, by the\r\nreadiness and regularity with which they returned to the station of private\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIt is in every point of view of such primary importance to carry the laws\r\ninto prompt and faithful execution, and to render that part of the\r\nadministration of justice which the Constitution and laws devolve on the\r\nFederal courts as convenient to the people as may consist with their\r\npresent circumstances, that I can not omit once more to recommend to your\r\nserious consideration the judiciary system of the United States. No subject\r\nis more interesting than this to the public happiness, and to none can\r\nthose improvements which may have been suggested by experience be more\r\nbeneficially applied.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce with the King of Prussia has been concluded\r\nand ratified. The ratifications have been exchanged, and I have directed\r\nthe treaty to be promulgated by proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which suspended the execution of the 6th article of our\r\ntreaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with Great Britain have not yet\r\nbeen removed. The negotiation on this subject is still depending. As it\r\nmust be for the interest and honor of both nations to adjust this\r\ndifference with good faith, I indulge confidently the expectation that the\r\nsincere endeavors of the Government of the United States to bring it to an\r\namicable termination will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary from the United\r\nStates to France were received by the First Consul with the respect due to\r\ntheir character, and 3 persons with equal powers were appointed to treat\r\nwith them. Although at the date of the last official intelligence the\r\nnegotiation had not terminated, yet it is to be hoped that our efforts to\r\neffect an accommodation will at length meet with a success proportioned to\r\nthe sincerity with which they have been so often repeated.\r\n\r\nWhile our best endeavors for the preservation of harmony with all nations\r\nwill continue to be used, the experience of the world and our own\r\nexperience admonish us of the insecurity of trusting too confidently to\r\ntheir success. We can not, without committing a dangerous imprudence,\r\nabandon those measures of self protection which are adapted to our\r\nsituation and to which, notwithstanding our pacific policy, the violence\r\nand injustice of others may again compel us to resort. While our vast\r\nextent of sea coast, the commercial and agriculture habits of our people,\r\nthe great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean, suggest the\r\nsystem of defense which will be most beneficial to ourselves, our distance\r\nfrom Europe and our resources for maritime strength will enable us to\r\nemploy it with effect. Seasonable and systematic arrangements, so far as\r\nour resources will justify, for a navy adapted to defensive war, and which\r\nmay in case of necessity be quickly brought into use, seem to be as much\r\nrecommended by a wise and true economy as by a just regard for our future\r\ntranquillity, for the safety of our shores, and for the protection of our\r\nproperty committed to the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe present Navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence by a\r\ngreat national exigency, has raised us in our own esteem, and by the\r\nprotection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our\r\nexpectations the objects for which it was created.\r\n\r\nIn connection with a navy ought to be contemplated the fortification of\r\nsome of our principal sea ports and harbors. A variety of considerations,\r\nwhich will readily suggest themselves, urge an attention to this measure of\r\nprecaution. To give security to our principal ports considerable sums have\r\nalready been expended, but the works remain incomplete. It is for Congress\r\nto determine whether additional appropriations shall be made in order to\r\nrender competent to the intended purposes the fortifications which have\r\nbeen commenced.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of arms within the United States still invites the\r\nattention of the National Legislature. At a considerable expense to the\r\npublic this manufacture has been brought to such a state of maturity as,\r\nwith continued encouragement, will supersede the necessity of future\r\nimportations from foreign countries.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the\r\nensuing year, together with an account of the public revenue and\r\nexpenditure to a late period, to be laid before you. I observe with much\r\nsatisfaction that the product of the revenue during the present year has\r\nbeen more considerable than during any former equal period. This result\r\naffords conclusive evidence of the great resources of this country and of\r\nthe wisdom and efficiency of the measures which have been adopted by\r\nCongress for the protection of commerce and preservation of public credit.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAs one of the grand community of nations, our attention is irresistibly\r\ndrawn to the important scenes which surround us. If they have exhibited an\r\nuncommon portion of calamity, it is the province of humanity to deplore and\r\nof wisdom to avoid the causes which may have produced it. If, turning our\r\neyes homeward, we find reason to rejoice at the prospect which presents\r\nitself; if we perceive the interior of our country prosperous, free, and\r\nhappy; if all enjoy in safety, under the protection of laws emanating only\r\nfrom the general will, the fruits of their own labor, we ought to fortify\r\nand cling to those institutions which have been the source of such real\r\nfelicity and resist with unabating perseverance the progress of those\r\ndangerous innovations which may diminish their influence.\r\n\r\nTo your patriotism, gentlemen, has been confided the honorable duty of\r\nguarding the public interests; and while the past is to your country a sure\r\npledge that it will be faithfully discharged, permit me to assure you that\r\nyour labors to promote the general happiness will receive from me the most\r\nzealous cooperation.",
