But\r\nto see it in all its regal beauty it should be aflame of a night,\r\nwith its innumerable gas jets; then it becomes in every sense of the\r\nword, a “mountain of light,” and shares the honors of the evening\r\nwith the “Pleiades,” “Orion,” and the “Milky Way.”\r\n\r\nThe Pharaoh who built the mighty pyramid of Egypt simply constructed\r\nhis own monument, and in the same way the architect of the dome, a\r\ncitizen of good old Philadelphia, has woven his name into a fragment\r\nof the web of Time. Thomas U. Walter--do you know him?--the man\r\nwho held this mighty tower in his brain, in all its perfection,\r\nlong, long before it ever saw the light of day. When you and I,\r\ndear reader, are not so much as a pinch of dust--when the names of\r\nWashington and Lincoln are as remote as the sages who lived before\r\nChrist--the great architects of the world will live, whether they\r\nsprung from the tawny mud of the Nile, the soil of classic Greece, or\r\nthe rich vegetable mould of the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1856 a dome had been constructed of brick, stone, and\r\nwood, sheathed in copper. Its height was 145 feet from the ground.\r\nThis was torn away to give place to the present structure, which is\r\ncomposed entirely of iron and glass.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the rebellion the labor of completing the dome\r\nwas progressing rapidly. Strangers visiting Washington will remember\r\nwhat seemed to look like acres of ground strewn with immense piles\r\nof iron. Facing the east and west fronts of the Capitol, immense\r\ntimbers were raised to fearful heights, to which pulleys and ropes\r\nwere attached that looked strong enough to lift the world. Weather\r\npermitting--for workmen had to lie by for either wind or rain--little\r\nblack objects might be seen crawling in and out, building up a nest\r\nafter the most approved waspish fashion. A closer inspection showed\r\nthese to be workmen. Now let Charles Fowler, esq., one of the firm of\r\nNew York builders, tell his story:\r\n\r\n  “I never had a comfortable night’s sleep during all the time the\r\n  work was going on. I lived in perpetual fear of some horrible\r\n  accident. We could not keep people out of the rotunda. Suppose\r\n  there had been a weak place in one of the timbers, a flaw in\r\n  an iron pin, a rotten strand in one of the ropes--and against\r\n  neither of these things could we entirely guard--there is no\r\n  knowing how many lives might have been lost.” “What precautions\r\n  did you take?” “We made everything four times as strong as it was\r\n  necessary to lift two tons of iron to a given height.” “Were any\r\n  lives lost?” “I only had three men killed in all the time. We had\r\n  stopped work for dinner one day, and when the workmen returned\r\n  they found one of their number dead on the ground. No one saw him\r\n  fall, but it was plain he had missed his foothold on the scaffold\r\n  and been precipitated to the ground. His head had come in contact\r\n  with some projecting beam. That was the end of him. Another lost\r\n  his life in the same way; but the third, poor fellow! it makes\r\n  my hair stand on end to think of it--a rope gave way and caught\r\n  him.” “The lightning hug of an anaconda?” “Yes, yes; that is it.\r\n  Poor Charlie! he never knew what hurt him. It chopped him up\r\n  in an instant. You don’t know how quick a big rope can do that\r\n  thing.”\r\n\r\nThe dome might have been completed in five years, but the Secretary\r\nof the Interior during the dark days of the rebellion stopped the\r\nwork, at a great pecuniary loss to the contractors. On the average\r\n200 men were employed in building the dome, including those who were\r\nworking on the castings in the foundry. The largest pieces of iron\r\nweighed two tons each.\r\n\r\nThe chief engineers employed were Gen. M. C. Meigs and Gen. Wm. B.\r\nFranklin. These engineers were detailed from the War Department\r\nbecause the building was Government property. Everything pertaining\r\nto this work is under the care of the engineer, and for its faithful\r\nexecution he is responsible. It is the engineer who accepts the plan\r\nof the architect and judges of strength and merit. It is the engineer\r\nwho makes the contracts and disburses the money. The word of the\r\nengineer is law. He is the autocrat in his own dominion, from whose\r\nfiat there is no appeal.\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, the dome is composed wholly of iron and\r\nglass, whilst the image which crowns it is made of bronze, designed\r\nby Crawford, and executed by Clark Mills. The weight of this\r\ngoddess is about 1,700 pounds. Everything included, the dome weighs\r\n10,000,000 pounds, which if turned into gold by the enchanter’s wand\r\nwould about pay the national debt.\r\n\r\nThis brief and imperfect sketch is gathered from glances from the\r\noutside. The interior of the dome from the floor to the rotunda\r\nrequires the pen of a genius to do justice to the so-called works\r\nof art found scattered in all directions. It is a long mathematical\r\ncalculation to find out how many square inches of canvas have been\r\nruined. A plaster caricature of our beloved Lincoln occupies the\r\ncenter of the floor, made by the tender hands of a youth of 17\r\nsummers. The fruit of genius, in all stages of the ripening process,\r\nits maturity forever arrested, lies gently decaying. It is enough to\r\nmake the cheek of an American blush, if the spectacle were not so\r\npitiful. A few gems gleam out of the rubbish. Exclusive of art, the\r\ndome of the Capitol cost the nation $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOLDIER’S BURIAL.\r\n\r\nLAST SCENE OF ALL PATHETICALLY DEPICTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 31, 1866_.\r\n\r\nA close observer in Washington is greatly surprised at the easy\r\ntransition from a state of war to that of peace. An intelligent\r\nperson might say there is no true peace. We will leave this\r\ndiscussion to the politicians, and say we are no longer awakened\r\nin the small hours of the night by the rumbling of the Government\r\nambulances bringing the wounded and dying from the battlefields to\r\nthe hospitals. We never shall forget that peculiar sound, unlike\r\nthat produced by any other vehicle. Perhaps it was the zigzag course\r\nthe driver often took to avoid any little obstruction in the street,\r\nwhich might jar and aggravate the wounded occupant, that made it\r\nseem so long in coming. But the movements were always slower than a\r\nfuneral march.\r\n\r\nBut sad as this procession seemed, painful almost beyond expression,\r\nthere was still a sadder sight. It was the same fashioned ambulance,\r\nwith “U. S. Hearse” marked in large letters on the side of it. Our\r\nears could never distinguish the movements of this from any grocer’s\r\nwagon. Sometimes we have been crossing a street, this solitary\r\nequipage would dash past, and if we were quick enough to catch a\r\nglance at the open end of it, we might see a stained coffin, perhaps\r\ntwo of them, with nothing to distinguish them but their manly\r\nproportions. No carriages, no mourners, no comrades, even, with\r\nreversed arms, all alone, save detailed soldiers enough to perform\r\nthe act of burial; even the “chaplain” often absent.\r\n\r\nHappening to meet an old soldier whom we knew just as the Government\r\nhearse was passing, said he, “I hope you don’t mind that; you see\r\nthat is only a part of the play. It don’t make much difference how\r\nyou drop the seed; the Lord will take care of the harvest.” In\r\nan instant religion stood stripped of its vaulted roof and broad\r\naisles--_Te Deums_, new bonnets, gewgaws and pew rent. Anxious for\r\nhis salvation, we inquired, “Do you ever go to church?” and thus this\r\nbronzed soldier answered, “Got too much faith to go very often. They\r\ndon’t ask a fellow to sit down. Got to stow away somewhere in the\r\nback gallery, or near the door, out of everybody’s way. And besides\r\nthat, I don’t want to go to their heaven. I ain’t got on the right\r\nkind of uniform to serve under their General. But hang it, Heaven is\r\nbig enough for us all--horses and dead rebs into the bargain.”\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday, as it were, the cloud, the vapor, the storm of war,\r\nthe wrath of the conflict, bleeding wounds, breaking hearts. To-day\r\nthe sun shines upon free, proud America, the most powerful nation on\r\nthe face of the earth--a nation that stands forth pure and undefiled,\r\nher late difficulties overcome, or will be just as soon as old Thad\r\nStevens reports the surgical operation a success. Fifteen able\r\ndoctors are at work, and have been ever since Congress has been in\r\nsession, and the country can rest assured that everything is going on\r\nas well as can be expected.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant place to visit, this Capitol of ours, on a\r\nsunshiny afternoon. ’Tis true that when once seated in the House of\r\nRepresentatives there is that feeling which one might be supposed to\r\nhave if hermetically sealed up in a huge can; but one is disabused\r\nof this feeling as soon as the greatness of the surroundings is\r\ncomprehended. There is no mistaking the Republican side of the House;\r\nthere is such a placid, self-satisfied look upon the faces of the\r\nmembers, as much as to say, “We have got it all in our own hands.”\r\nThe Democratic side is greatly in the minority, so far as numbers are\r\nconcerned; but they are a plucky set of men, mostly with thin lips,\r\nwhich they are in the habit of bringing tight together, reminding one\r\nof a certain little instrument made for torture; and woe to the House\r\nwhen an unfortunate Republican falls into the trap, for then follow\r\nlong, windy discussions of no mortal use to the country and amounting\r\nto only so much waste of time and money.\r\n\r\nThe gallery known as the “Gentlemen’s” is generally filled with\r\nmasculines who have little or nothing to do; but as they do not\r\nimpede the wheels of legislation, and are kept out of the way\r\nof mischief in the meantime, the country is obliged for their\r\nattendance. And now I come to the ladies who grace and honor with\r\ntheir presence the national Capitol. How shall I describe these\r\nbeautiful human butterflies in glaring hoops and gig-top bonnets,\r\ncurls and perfumery? If the eyes of the traveler ache to behold in a\r\nsolid mass the different strata of American society, let him visit\r\nthe national Capitol when Ben Wade is going to make a speech. Nobody\r\nfrom the White House! These ladies have a good old-fashioned way\r\nof staying at home. (Wonder if they dry their clothes in the East\r\nRoom as good queen Abigail used to do?) Carriages arrive at the east\r\nfront of the Capitol--solemn carriages; heavy bays--made more for\r\nstrength than beauty; driver with a narrow band around his hat, a\r\nlittle badge--just enough to show that he does not belong to “them\r\nindependent Jehus that lurk around Willard’s and the National.”\r\nDriver and footman blended in one piece of ebony; driver descends,\r\nopens the carriage door, and madame, the proud wife of a Senator,\r\ndescends, not with agility, for senatorial dignity brings years,\r\nrich, ripe, golden maturity, perfection of dress and manners, dark,\r\nrich silk, velvet mantle--none of your plebeian coats! The portals of\r\nthe great Capitol open and Madame le Senator disappears.\r\n\r\nNow come the wives of the wealthy members; not the leading ones, for\r\ngreat men seldom take time to get rich. Showy carriage, driver and\r\nfootman in gloves, an elegant carriage costume, an occasional flash\r\nof early autumnal beauty, oftener positively commonplace. And now\r\ncomes Jehu, who has left his “stand” before Willard’s or the National\r\njust long enough to turn an honest penny. Perhaps he is bringing a\r\nmember’s wife whose carriage costume outshines her neighbor, the\r\nowner of the footman in gloves. She wishes it understood that she is\r\nnot a resident of Washington; here temporarily, just long enough to\r\nkeep her husband from butting his brains out against reconstruction.\r\n\r\nShe disappears, and still the carriages are arriving and we see many\r\nheads of bureaus, the Army and the Navy represented, and a sprinkling\r\nof upper clerk’s wives. More carriages, and the demi-mondes flutter\r\nout, faultless in costume, fair as ruby wine, and much more\r\ndangerous. The carriages bring the cream, and the street cars the\r\nskim milk. But there is another way of going to the Capitol, which\r\nis quite as exclusive as in carriage, and does away with that clumsy\r\nvehicle. I am speaking of those who detest the street cars, and yet\r\nremember that carriages more properly belong to gouty uncles and\r\ninvalid aunts. It is to pick one’s way daintily over the pavement.\r\nSniffing the pure air and the fragrance of the dead leaves in the\r\nCapitol grounds--good anti-dyspeptic tonic. Try it and speak from\r\nexperience as we do. The allotted pages filled, au revoir.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S BIRTHDAY.\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL ADDRESS OF HONORABLE GEORGE BANCROFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 19, 1866_.\r\n\r\nThe 12th day of February has passed into history, wisely chronicled\r\nby one of the first historians of the age, and ere this the oration\r\nof the Honorable George Bancroft has been discussed in almost every\r\nhamlet in the land. It was an able effort, but nevertheless, one\r\nlonged for a little less history and a little more Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAll the great and wise men of the nation were gathered together, and\r\nthere was a man in the gallery busily employed in taking photographs.\r\nHereafter the wise men of the country will bear witness that the\r\nHonorable George Bancroft is a better writer than speaker. And here\r\nlet me record an historical fact. It is the memory of a delicious\r\nlittle nap indulged in by one of the Supreme Court Judges. Whether it\r\nwas the peculiar tones of the orator, like a dull minister’s voice of\r\na Sunday afternoon, or the sound of the rain pattering on the roof,\r\nor the shadows of so many great men falling aslant the judge’s mental\r\nhorizon which caused this somnolence I am unable to say; but he did\r\nsleep for a brief time, bringing great joy to many hearts, for it\r\nproved that those awful judges in black gowns are mortal like the\r\nrest of us and that dignity is something that can be laid aside like\r\nany other covering.\r\n\r\nBut I proceeded to the foreign ministers, who nobly came forward,\r\nlike martyrs, to mingle their sympathy with ours. And it was the\r\nheroic part of the ceremonies to see how manfully these aristocrats\r\nendured the castigation. What business had lords to accept cards\r\nof invitation unless they were willing to be told some unpleasant\r\ntruths? Did they suppose the great historian would dwell on the life\r\nand virtues of Abraham Lincoln and leave out the history of this\r\nmighty republic? The Marquis De Montholon, the representative of His\r\nMajesty Napoleon III, drew his expressive brow into a frown terrific\r\nin the extreme, and pulled his kid gloves in a manner which denoted\r\ngreat nervousness. But this may be owing entirely to the mercurial\r\ncharacter of the French nation.\r\n\r\nAnother foreign minister drew the cape of his overcoat up over his\r\nhead during certain portions of the oration. But it was not owing to\r\nany wish of stopping his ears--merely a preventive to cold-catching,\r\nas the doors were open and certain draft of air perambulated the\r\nhall, taking liberties with these great men just as if they had been\r\nnobodies. Her Majesty the Queen of England’s servant, Sir Frederick\r\nBruce, is one of the handsomest men of the age. I never look at such\r\na man without feeling that nature’s laws have been followed and\r\nperfected in such veritable lords of creation. Compare a lion to its\r\nmate, the songster of the forest with plain birds who prefer domestic\r\nduties to gadding about the woods, whistling all sorts of love-sick\r\ntunes, and who disputes where the palm of beauty is found? The most\r\nexquisite woman that was ever made is no more to be compared to the\r\nhandsomest man than the humble pea-fowl to his majesty the peacock.\r\nYet the peacock thinks his mate the most exquisite of all created\r\nthings, and what woman would be so unwise as to upset his opinions?\r\nI return to Sir Frederick Bruce, but would as soon attempt to paint\r\nthe moonbeams as to describe his personal appearance. He is a\r\nthoroughbred, just like Bonner’s “Silver Heels” and “Fearless;” skin\r\nas translucent as wine; hands and feet as small as a woman’s. Men are\r\nlike grapes, they need a little frost to sweeten and perfect them;\r\nand a man is never handsome until he has been rounded and polished by\r\nthe hand of Time. And this is confirmed by the additional instances\r\nof Chief Justice Chase and Honorable James Watson Webb, both of them\r\non the threshold of the winter of life, yet never before so perfect\r\nin manly beauty.\r\n\r\nThe two men who occupied the most prominent positions before the\r\noratory were His Excellency the President, and the Chief Justice of\r\nthe United States. I am not going to record their lives; the pen of\r\nthe historian will do that. I desire merely to say that they were\r\nrepresentative Americans, who rose from the humblest position to\r\nthe topmost round of the ladder of fame. And may it prove a solemn\r\nwarning to those mothers who are accustomed to apply the slipper to\r\nunruly urchins. I beg them to desist, lest they may be breaking the\r\nspirit or souring the disposition of some future President or Chief\r\nJustice of the United States.\r\n\r\nAmong the celebrities in the gallery I noticed the widow of Daniel\r\nWebster. But as I have given my opinion about the beauty of women, I\r\nshall make no departure from it, unless the ends shall justify the\r\nmeans. The wife of the Lieutenant General, Julia Dent Grant, occupied\r\na front seat in the gallery, just as she had a right to do. She wore\r\na pink hat, a red plaided scarf, and black gloves, and a little\r\nupstart woman who sat near me had the impudence to say the general’s\r\nlady “looked horrid.” She no doubt would have been put out for the\r\nabove expression but the gallery was so crowded that no officer could\r\nbe found at the proper time to discharge his duty.\r\n\r\nJust before the time arrived for opening this great historical\r\nmeeting Washington contained two sets of people besides the saints\r\nand sinners, and these were the envious and the envied. The envied\r\nwere the fortunate holders of tickets to the meeting, and the envious\r\nwere the great outsiders. But when the third hour of that memorable\r\nspeaking arrived the tables were turned. Members began to twist\r\naround as if they were schoolboys, the victims of pins which in\r\nsome unaccountable way had been put in the cushions of their chairs,\r\npoints upward. A celebrated New York politician treated himself\r\nto a newspaper; tobacco-boxes circulated freely and all sorts of\r\nexpressions came over the human countenance which are possible when\r\nmen get into positions where they are obliged to behave themselves\r\nand don’t want to. I will add, everything must come to an end, and so\r\ndid this great occasion.\r\n\r\nAs I have nearly filled the allotted space, I must only glance\r\nat the great ball at the Marquis De Montholon’s and say it was\r\nequal, but not superior, to the same kind of parties given by our\r\naccomplished countrywoman, Mrs. Senator Sprague. In both cases no\r\nexpense is spared in the entertainment of guests, and any amount of\r\ngreenbacks, duty in the shape of costly silks and laces; but I learn\r\nthat precious stones are more or less abandoned, since the shoddy and\r\npetroleum have learned to shine.\r\n\r\nThe shadows of Lent are upon us, and this fact crowded the\r\nPresident’s last levee to suffocation. It was exceedingly painful\r\nto notice the violation of good taste in some of my countrywomen by\r\ntheir appearance before the Executive and the ladies of the mansion\r\nin bonnet and wrappings. Unless ladies can conform to the usages of\r\ngood society they had better remain at home.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE POLITICAL.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JOHNSON GIVES EVIDENCE OF HIS OCCUPANCY OF THE CHAIR OF THE\r\nEXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 1, 1866_.\r\n\r\nIt is so well known that it is almost needless for me to repeat that\r\npolitics in Washington are shaken from center to circumference, and\r\nthe country seems astounded at the bearing of a little innocent\r\nspeech which emanated from His Excellency the President, from the\r\nbalcony of the White House. Didn’t Mr. Johnson take measures to\r\nprepare the minds of Congress and the people by his veto and still\r\nmore significant message? Didn’t he send his “Premier” to the great\r\nmetropolis to assure the people that “the war would cease in ninety\r\ndays”? If the people are astonished, who is to blame for it? Have\r\nthey forgotten the fact that they have a Southern President? Andrew\r\nJohnson is a man. Andrew Johnson is human. This is proved by his\r\nwise and decorous behavior on inauguration day, by his kindness of\r\nheart to the down-trodden, and by his willingness to grant pardons to\r\nthose who humble themselves so much as to ask it. Isn’t his adopted\r\nState shivering out in the cold, and his own flesh and blood by\r\nmarriage denied admittance to Congress--said flesh and blood holding\r\ncredentials in his hands the genuineness of which cannot for a moment\r\nbe doubted? But there is one way by which a great deal of trouble can\r\nbe saved the country and end the war which is surely coming upon the\r\nland. It is not a war of cold steel, but the clash of mental weapons,\r\nand it is feared that the party which can rally the most humbug is\r\nsure to win, just as they used to do in the good old Democratic days\r\nwhen Andrew Johnson sat in the Senate and had political sagacity\r\nto see in what direction power lay. Wasn’t he a “Dimmicrat” then?\r\nAnd isn’t he a Democrat to-day? Having no further use for the cloak\r\ncalled Unionism, he throws it aside. Shall we acknowledge that we\r\nhave been humbugged--acknowledge that we have been dolts, idiots?\r\nNo; rather let us uphold the President and the Constitution. Let\r\nus all turn Democrats--every man, woman and child in the land--and\r\nthen there will be nothing to fight for. But lest some unscrupulous\r\npoliticians may fail to profit by good advice, I hasten to call the\r\nattention of postmasters and custom-house officers who have lately\r\nbeen flying the star-spangled banner, and advise them to lower it\r\nimmediately; also to make haste and don a new political garment,\r\nmade by the first tailor in the land, else they will come to grief,\r\nfor already the Democrats, those long-neglected sufferers, are on\r\nthe wing for Washington, to be present at the distribution of the\r\nspoils, and those unfortunate Republicans who were so unwise as to\r\nvote for Andy Johnson deserve to be ousted, and the vacant places\r\nshould be filled by those returned rebels, for shouldn’t there be\r\nmore rejoicing over the one that is found than the ninety and nine\r\nwho never go astray?\r\n\r\nAnd would all this trouble have come upon the land if the men\r\nhad stayed at home managing business and the women had done the\r\nlegislating? Was a woman ever known to take a frozen viper to her\r\nbosom? This great triumph was left for man to accomplish. After the\r\nsad experience of masculine politicians, I trust they will be content\r\nto remain quietly at home and let wiser and weaker heads take the\r\naffairs of the nation into their hands, and our word for it Charles\r\nSumner and Thaddeus Stevens, the cause of this anguish, will have to\r\nhide their diminished heads. Sumner and Stevens are both unmarried\r\nmen; they have been bachelors ever since they were born, and this\r\nheadstrong course which they have taken, bringing anguish and woe\r\ninto every city and hamlet in the land, is owing to the want of\r\nthe softening and refining influence of woman. The President didn’t\r\nmention this fact from the balcony of the White House, but he no\r\ndoubt would have done so if Messrs. Clampit and Aiken (counsel for\r\nthe conspirators) had called his attention to it.\r\n\r\nIf some of my readers take exception to the political caste of the\r\nbeginning of this letter, I will say that nothing else is thought\r\nof in Washington, much less talked about, and it is surprising to\r\nsee the ladies conning newspapers that are devoted exclusively to\r\npolitics. Never, since the opening guns upon Sumter, has so much\r\nfeeling been expressed.\r\n\r\nThe solemnities of Lent are upon us, but, as the heads of the church\r\nwisely say that no fast need be indulged in if it endangers the\r\nhealth and life of the penitent--and fasting always does so--the\r\nfair Episcopalians of Washington, those of my acquaintance, take the\r\nseason of Lent to repair their constitutions which have been so sadly\r\nused in the whirl of gayety and the frivolity of fashionable life. I\r\nam glad the gay season is over. How comfortable to pack away ermine,\r\nand banish moire antiques to trunks seldom or never used, there to\r\nrepose until another season, in company with odors of “night blooming\r\ncereus” or some such delicate perfume. But the best use which can be\r\nmade of dresses which have done duty for one winter is to send them\r\noff by express to country cousins. But one must be careful what kind\r\nof country cousins one has, for any little generous act of this kind\r\nmight upset one’s cream for a whole summer. It is a solemn fact that\r\nladies have such sharp eyes that they can detect an old dress made\r\nnew instantly, and any woman who has the audacity, for the sake of a\r\nlittle well-meant but foolish economy, to humbug her friends of the\r\ncommunity in this way deserves the fate which is sure to be meted out\r\nto her--that of a little downward slide on the social scale. This\r\napplies to the extreme fashionables.\r\n\r\nBut there is another picture of Washington life. There are some\r\nwomen who come to Washington who bring with their presence the\r\nvery atmosphere of the State which has the honor of sending their\r\nhusbands here. They bring the old-fashioned country ways of living\r\nand thinking. They refuse to lower the necks of their dresses and are\r\nperfectly willing somebody should eclipse them. They even sit with\r\nold-fashioned knitting work in the evening, whilst their husbands\r\nare writing letters to their constituents, for all members do not\r\nkeep a private secretary. And I have always noticed that men who wear\r\nstockings of their wives’ knitting are the ones who stand firmest\r\nwhen the shock of battle comes.\r\n\r\nSpring is upon us. The winter has departed so gently that we almost\r\nforgot that he has been our guest for the last three months. And\r\nyoung Spring, with his balmy breezes, is here, for he brings none of\r\nhis boisterous, blowy gambols with which he regales our kinfolk in\r\nmore northern latitudes. The season has come suggestive of new-laid\r\neggs and frisky calves gamboling in the pastures, all unmindful of\r\nthe cruel knife. Oh, for a quiet week in the neighborhood of the\r\nQuaker City.\r\n\r\n      “Man made the town, but God made the country.”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEA FOR THE NEGRO.\r\n\r\nTHE PITIABLE CONDITION OF THE COLORED RACE DEPLORED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 9, 1866_.\r\n\r\nNational affairs are becoming a little more settled in Washington;\r\nat least it is hoped that the iron cloud has a silver lining. Mr.\r\nJohnson has assured a well-known politician that he shall make his\r\nfight entirely within the lines of the Union party; also that he has\r\nno office to bestow on “Copperheads.” This is the last manifesto\r\nthat has been issued from the White House to my personal knowledge.\r\nIt is true that politicians declare that they will not believe any\r\nmore of his assurances, because he is sure to contradict himself\r\nnext day. But isn’t it a historical fact that all great rulers have\r\nalways been fond of changes? Didn’t good Queen Bess have a new dress\r\nfor every day in the year? One day Mr. Johnson assumes a political\r\ngarb that brings great joy to the rebels, alias “Copperheads.” The\r\nnext day he dons a suit particularly soothing to the ruffled feelings\r\nof the Unionists. To-day he chooses to lay aside the Presidential\r\ngarb, which, by the way, is as heavy and irksome as a coat of mail,\r\nand assumes the garb of a humble citizen, and indulges in a few\r\npersonal insinuations; and shouldn’t we be thankful that the citizen\r\nisn’t lost sight of in the mighty ruler? Isn’t this a proof of the\r\nsoundness of American institutions? From the North, East, and West,\r\nfrom Tennessee, come scathing denunciations from the men who placed\r\nhim in power, aided and assisted by one Booth; but he bears it with\r\nthe dignity becoming his high position.\r\n\r\nI have not heard of any dismissals from office on account of\r\ndiffering with him in opinion, but some have been dismissed for\r\nexpressing them.\r\n\r\nAmong the number I notice Mrs. Jane Swisshelm, a woman not entirely\r\nunknown to fame. She has held an office in the War Department ever\r\nsince the Indian atrocities in her late home in Minnesota; but her\r\nout-spoken sentiments in the paper which she is editing here sealed\r\nher fate, and the Secretary of War caused a letter-envelope to be\r\nlaid upon her desk as potent in its designs as any other of the many\r\nwarlike and immortal plans which have issued from time to time from\r\nhis fertile brain, to his credit and honor, and the world’s benefit.\r\nAnd how fortunate for the country that we have a Tycoon who has the\r\nundaunted courage to resist the blighting influence of the so-called\r\ngentler sex, and is not above reaching forth his hand, thereby making\r\nwoman feel that he is not to be trifled with. Mrs. Swisshelm’s paper,\r\n_The Reconstructionist_, still survives, upheld by its unflinching\r\neditress, and if it fails to throw light upon reconstruction, it is\r\nbecause the President is blind and will not see, for her dismissal\r\nfrom office proves that she has not hid her light under a bushel. But\r\nit is rumored in political circles that she has been relieved from\r\noffice in order to go into the Cabinet, as there are Cabinet changes\r\nhinted at, more or less, every day.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful spring weather in Washington is totally marred by\r\nthe clouds of dust that sweep the length and breadth of our grand\r\navenues. I can compare it to nothing but those moving pillars of sand\r\nwhich bury travelers in the bosom of the great Sahara. ’Tis true one\r\ncan escape with life, but new bonnets and dresses are nearly if not\r\nquite ruined, and the sacrifice is about the same thing; for in the\r\nlatter case we realize the loss, whilst in the former our friends are\r\nthe only sufferers.\r\n\r\nBut the clouds of dust do not prevent our sooty neighbors from\r\nspading the gardens, and just now they are engaged in turning up\r\nthe soil with their blades in that gentle, easy manner which none\r\nbut a negro knows how to practice. Washington is a Southern city\r\nin every sense of the word. It may have been partially redeemed by\r\nYankee thrift during the war, but it is now fast sinking back to its\r\noriginal condition as it was in the days of the “old regime.” Slavery\r\nis dead, it is true, but the black man is not a citizen. He is the\r\nhumblest laborer in the vineyard. But hard as their lot appears,\r\nit is far preferable to hopeless slavery; and though thousands of\r\nlives of the present generation may be sacrificed upon the altar of\r\nfreedom, a new future awaits them; and if their Moses has changed his\r\nmind, or concluded that he has other work to do, they must bide their\r\ntime, and raise up a leader of their own race and color, for the Lord\r\nhas ordained that every people shall work out their own salvation.\r\nThis is not a political view of the subject, only a feeble woman’s,\r\nwho can do nothing for the freedman but utter shriek after shriek for\r\nhim, which has proved just as efficient as anything that has been\r\ndone in various quarters. Congress has done all it could do; the\r\nPresident has promised to be their “Moses,” and the negro persists in\r\nsuffering. Who is to blame for it? Do they not bring their sufferings\r\nupon their own heads? What business have they to be born? Isn’t it\r\na crime of the darkest dye? I leave this painful subject for wiser\r\nheads to explain, but should anything new transpire in regard to it,\r\nI shall make haste to inform my readers at the earliest moment.\r\n\r\nSince the grand speech from the White House one is astonished at the\r\nsudden development of a spirit which was supposed to have collapsed\r\nwith the rebellion. Great flaunting pictures of General Lee appear\r\nat conspicuous places to attract the attention of passers-by. He\r\nhas taken Washington at last. One prominent bookstore balances his\r\npicture by that of General Grant; but a certain other bookstore\r\nbetrays its ideas very ridiculously by a set of pictures--General\r\nWashington being in the center, Jeff Davis on one side and Jesus\r\nChrist on the other! Had the shopkeeper displayed the picture of our\r\nlamented Lincoln side by side with the assassin Booth my astonishment\r\nwould have been no greater. Does the community think treason a crime\r\nwhen such things are allowed in our midst? We hear of no more balls,\r\nlevees or receptions.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if the early days of the revolution were upon us again,\r\nas if we must prepare ourselves for events which possibly might\r\nbecome calamities in the end. New gypsy bonnets are displayed by\r\nmilliners, but we have not seen a face peeping out from one, either\r\nhandsome or ugly. And isn’t this a symptom of the earnestness of the\r\ntimes, just as straws show which way the wind blows? I did not mean\r\nto write a political letter; but there are times when we are caught\r\nin a storm, our eyes blinded with lightning, our ears filled with\r\nthunder; rain pouring, and no umbrella; mud deep, and no overshoes.\r\nWhen the storm subsides may we greet our readers under pleasanter\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT DRY TORTUGAS.\r\n\r\nSEEKING PARDON FOR THOSE IMPRISONED ON THAT ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 16, 1867_.\r\n\r\nThe reticence of General Grant covers the future with a haze of\r\nobscurity. Different Cabinet combinations appear before the public\r\nvision, like so many dissolving views of a midsummer night’s dream.\r\nThe President-elect appears at a dinner party and escorts one of the\r\ngentlemen home, and the latter fortunate individual is decided to be\r\nan embryo Cabinet minister, and the lobby cries, “Hail to thee, thane\r\nof Cawdor!”\r\n\r\nIt is very quiet in Washington, but it is the sultry calm which\r\nprecedes the storm. All are waiting for the secret which is locked\r\nin General Grant’s mind as securely as the genie was fastened in\r\nthe copper box under the seal of the great Solomon. In the meantime\r\nPresident Johnson is busy providing for his friends, as well as other\r\nunfortunates, who are not clamoring at the door of the Executive\r\nchamber in vain. Day after day, for months, a few fearfully bereaved\r\nwomen have haunted the White House. Among the number might have been\r\nfound the wife of Sanford Conover, alias Charles A. Dunham, who\r\nperjured himself on the trial of John Surratt, and since his sentence\r\nhas been serving out his term in State’s prison. Day after day this\r\npale-faced, indefatigable woman has been haunting Mr. Johnson;\r\nhaunting every man whom she supposed could have any influence in\r\nher behalf. At last her unwearying efforts have been crowned with\r\nsuccess. Judge Advocate Holt and Honorable A. C. Riddle (one of the\r\ncounsel on the trial) have said that Conover “without solicitation\r\ngave valuable information to the Government, which was used to\r\nassist the prosecution, and that he is entitled to the clemency of\r\nthe Executive on the principle that requires from the Government\r\nrecognition of such service, and that he has already served two years\r\nof his term.”\r\n\r\nAnother smitten woman’s feet have pressed the costly Wiltons of the\r\nExecutive Mansion as sorrowfully as Hagar’s did the parched sward of\r\nthe wilderness. It is the wife of Dr. Mudd, the man who was tried\r\nwith the other conspirators, and is now serving out his life term at\r\nthe desolate “Dry Tortugas.” During the last dreadful yellow fever\r\nepidemic, our officers on the island testify to the almost superhuman\r\nefforts of Dr. Mudd in behalf of the prisoners and soldiers. He\r\nseemed to have a charmed life among the dead and dying. There was\r\nno duty so loathsome that he shrank from it, and when he could do\r\nno more for the sufferers in life he helped to cover their remains\r\nwith the salted sands. Armed with this testimony of the officers, for\r\nmonths Mrs. Mudd has attended Andrew Johnson like a shadow.\r\n\r\nOne day last summer a personal friend of the President’s was admitted\r\nto the Executive presence. As he took the lady’s hand, he smilingly\r\nremarked: “I am sorry that I kept you waiting.”\r\n\r\nShe replied, “There is another lady who has been waiting longer than\r\nI have.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know her?” asked the President.\r\n\r\n“I never saw her before,” said the lady.\r\n\r\nThe President called a messenger, saying, “See who is in the\r\nante-room waiting.”\r\n\r\nA smile crept over the messenger’s face as he answered, “It’s only\r\nMrs. Mudd.”\r\n\r\n“Only Mrs. Mudd,” echoed the President, while a spasm of pain chased\r\nover his countenance. “That woman here again, after all I have said?”\r\nAt the same time the President put both hands to his face.\r\n\r\n“Why do you allow yourself to be so annoyed?” said the friend, using\r\nthe license which belongs to a woman’s friendship.\r\n\r\n“The President of the United States ought not be annoyed at\r\nanything; besides, I have no right to put any one out of this house\r\nwho comes to see me on business and behaves with propriety. Don’t let\r\nus talk about that; let us think of something else.”\r\n\r\nOf all forsaken places on this planet, there is none that will\r\ncompare in terror to the Dry Tortugas. By the side of it St. Helena\r\nis a kind of terrestrial paradise. Neither friendly rock, shrub,\r\ntree nor blade of grass is to be seen on its surface. It is a small,\r\nburning Sahara, planted in the bosom of the desolate sea, without a\r\nsingle oasis to relieve its savage face. The garrison and prisoners\r\nhave to depend on cisterns for their supply of water, and out of\r\nthe thirty-seven carpenters who, in the beginning of the rebellion,\r\nwent there with the corps of engineers to look after repairs, only\r\nfour returned alive, and two of these have been confirmed invalids\r\never since. When one of the carpenters was questioned to explain the\r\ngreat mortality, he said it was owing, at this particular time, to\r\nthe miserable quarters prepared for the workmen, and to the bad water\r\nthat was dealt out to them, of which, bad as it was, they could not\r\nget enough to supply their pressing wants. The island swarms with\r\ninsects that bite and sting; and if the soldiers on duty there were\r\nnot frequently relieved and sent to the mainland, mutiny and its\r\nattendant horrors would be sure to follow. When a criminal deserves\r\nto expiate ten thousand deaths in one, it is only necessary to send\r\nhim to the Dry Tortugas.\r\n\r\nFor several months people have been at work here upon certain\r\nnominations which have been sent to the Senate. Mrs. Anna S. Stephens\r\nhas not been only at work on the life of Andrew Johnson, which she\r\nhas foretold will end with the one immortal triumph (his escape\r\nfrom his impeachment foes), but she also succeeded in getting her\r\nson nominated as consul to Manchester, England. While the venerable\r\nmother has labored at the White House, the would-be consul’s wife, in\r\ncharming silks and costly gems, has sought introductions to leading\r\nmen who might have some influence with the stony Senate, if they\r\nonly chose to exercise it. It has become well known in Washington\r\nthat whenever a man feels ambition swelling in his bosom the best\r\nremedy is to send some interesting feminine diplomat to court, and\r\nif she does not succeed he will then know it was because the case\r\nwas hopeless from the beginning. In the good old days of Queen Bess,\r\ndiplomacy was almost altogether in the hands of the woman; then that\r\nwas certainly one of the most remarkable eras in the world’s history.\r\n\r\nJames Parton, the distinguished magazine writer, has been here for\r\nseveral days. He has been seen on the floor of the House, and also in\r\nclose consultation with many leading members of Congress, as well as\r\ndoorkeepers, messengers, pages, and all others who are supposed to be\r\nwise and serious when talked to in regard to a certain very delicate\r\nsubject. It is said that Mr. Parton is preparing an article upon the\r\nWashington lobby. It is said he is going to hold up the monster in\r\nthe broad light of day--this creeping, crawling thing, which, in more\r\nrespects than one, bears a strong resemblance to Victor Hugo’s devil\r\nfish; for while it is strong enough to strangle the most powerful\r\nman, if once fairly drawn under the surface in its awful embrace, yet\r\nif you attempt to pluck it to pieces, piecemeal, you are rewarded\r\nwith only so much loathsome quivering jelly.\r\n\r\nThis nation will never realize the debt of gratitude it owes the\r\nmen who are standing as sentinels at the doors of the Treasury. The\r\nCommittee on Claims are besieged by an army more terrible in its\r\ninvincibility than ever stormed the earthworks of fort or doomed\r\ncity. It is true, the arms used by the enemy are of a kind as old as\r\ncreation, whilst the flash of an eye answers to the old flintlock or\r\nmodern percussion cap. As yet these noble men have defended every\r\ninch of ground, and many of these fair Southern braves have withdrawn\r\ntheir claims for the present, waiting for another set of sentinels\r\nwho will replace those on duty now. But more of this anon.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nIOWANS ASSEMBLE AT THE RESIDENCE OF SENATOR HARLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 25, 1867_.\r\n\r\nLooking at society in Washington from a certain point of view, is\r\nlike gazing upon the shifting scenes of a brilliant panorama. But\r\none of the most delightful and home-like pictures consists of the\r\ndifferent persons temporarily sojourning here, and who have always\r\nretained the right of citizenship in their respective States, joining\r\ntogether under the name of an “association” for the interchange of\r\nfriendly sentiments as well as for the cultivation of fraternal love.\r\nIt is the business of the president of these meetings to keep a list\r\nof the names and residence of all who belong to the association, and\r\nstrangers coming to Washington can by this means find without trouble\r\ntheir acquaintances and friends. These Western associations are\r\nparticularly flourishing this winter. One week we are told that the\r\nIndiana Association has had a pleasant gathering, and the Honorable\r\nSchuyler Colfax and John Defrees, the Public Printer, the sun and\r\nmoon of the little planetary system, have risen and set together, and\r\nthe united social element clapped its hands with joy.\r\n\r\nAgain we read that Iowa, God bless her, with her solid Republican\r\ndelegation, and her war record as unblemished as a maiden’s first\r\nblush, has gathered her citizens together in Union League Hall, as\r\na hen gathered her chickens under her wing. It is at these social\r\nmeetings that the old home-fires are kindled anew in the hearts\r\nof the Iowa wanderers; and when the most profitless carpet-bagger\r\narrives he is treated nearly as well as the prodigal son. Sometimes\r\nit happens that the more prominent members “entertain” the\r\nassociation, or in other words, “Iowa” is the invited guest.\r\nOnly last night Iowa, as represented by the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, the Departments, as well as the strangers stopping\r\nhere through the inaugural ceremonies, were invited to the elegant\r\nmansion of Senator Harlan, where all were welcomed alike by the\r\nSenator and his accomplished wife. Here in the spacious parlors met\r\nthe different members of the outgoing with those of the incoming\r\ndelegation of that State; and here let it be recorded that neither\r\nCongressmen whose term of office expires on the 4th of March, could\r\nget himself decapitated by his constituents, but was obliged at the\r\nlast moment to commit political hari-kari.\r\n\r\nStanding a little apart from each other were the two bright\r\nparticular stars of the evening--Mrs. Harlan, the agreeable\r\nhostess, and Mrs. Grimes, the wife of the able Senator of historic\r\nfame, two representative women on the world’s stage to-day, and\r\nboth alike respected for their intrinsic worth, aside from the\r\nsenatorial laurels which they share. One could hardly realize, when\r\ncontemplating Mrs. Harlan, a brilliant, sparkling brunette, whose\r\nfeet have just touched the autumn threshold of age, in her faultless\r\nevening costume of garnet silk, point lace and pearls--“Wandering,”\r\nsay you? Yes, yes; one could hardly realize that this was the same\r\nMrs. Harlan who had remained all night in her ambulance on the bloody\r\nfield of Shiloh, with the shrieks of the wounded and dying sounding\r\nin her ears; and yet, out of just such material are many more\r\nAmerican women made.\r\n\r\nSelf-poised and dignified as a marble statue stood Mrs. Grimes,\r\nnoticeable only for the simplicity of her dress. Yet it was easy to\r\nperceive that it was the hand of an artist that had swept back the\r\ngolden brown hair from the perfect forehead and dainty ears. Quiet\r\nin her deportment, she seemed a modest violet in a gay parterre of\r\nflowers. A woman of intellectual attainments, she has few equals\r\nand no superiors here. This present winter she has mingled much more\r\nin general society than usual, and her graceful presence helps to\r\nscatter “the late unpleasantness” as the sun drives away the malarial\r\nmists of the night.\r\n\r\nAmong the most prominent Iowans present might have been seen the Hon.\r\nWilliam B. Allison, member of Congress from Dubuque, whom Lucien\r\nGilbert Calhoun, of the New York _Tribune_ “dubbed” the handsomest\r\nman in Congress. Who would dare to be so audacious as to oppose the\r\nlight current of small talk that ebbs and flows with an occasional\r\ntidal wave through the columns of that solemn newspaper? If the\r\n_Tribune_ says he is handsome, an Adonis he shall be; but as space\r\nwill not allow of a full description, it is only necessary to say\r\nthat he has large brown eyes, that usually look out in their pleased\r\nsurprise like Maud Muller’s; but the other day they opened wide with\r\nastonishment when they read in a popular newspaper that the same\r\nWilliam B. had been accused of receiving more than $100,000 for\r\nfavoring a certain railroad project. But the hoax was soon unearthed,\r\nand Mr. Allison found his reputation once more as clean as new kid\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to a man in whom the nation may have a pride, Geo. G.\r\nM. Dodge, of war memory, one of General Sherman’s efficient aids in\r\nhis march across the Southern country to the sea; serving honorably\r\nin Congress to the satisfaction of his constituents. He has resigned\r\nthe position that he may devote himself wholly to his profession, as\r\nchief engineer of the Pacific Railroad. Young, handsome, daring and\r\naggressive, he is Young America personified. He is the man of the\r\nday, as Daniel Boone was the man of the era in which he lived; and\r\nhis whole soul was embodied in words when he said, “I can’t breathe\r\nin Washington.”\r\n\r\nWe touch the honest, ungloved hand of the host of the evening,\r\nSenator Harlan, one of the superb pillars of the Republican party;\r\none who has stood upon principles as firmly as though his feet were\r\nplanted upon the rock of ages; but once he became Secretary of the\r\nInterior, and an angel from Heaven could not go into that sink of\r\npollution and come out with clean, unstained wings. If Senator Harlan\r\nlives in a respectable mansion in Washington it is because the\r\ninterest of the unpaid mortgage upon it is less than the rent would\r\nbe if owned by a landlord; and let it be remembered that Senator\r\nHarlan is the only man in the Iowa delegation who has a whole roof to\r\nshelter his head; that his house is the only place where citizens of\r\nIowa can gather together and feel at home. It was the noble idea of\r\nhospitality to the State that made the Senator pitch his tent outside\r\nthe horrors of a Washington boarding-house or a crowded hotel, and\r\nnot to “shine,” as the envious and malicious would have it. A thrust\r\nat Senator Harlan is a stab at every man, woman and child who knows\r\nhim best, and if it was for the good of this nation that the New\r\nYork _Tribune_ should be broiled like St. Lawrence on a gridiron,\r\nit would only be necessary to make it a Secretary of the Interior,\r\nwith the Indian Bureau in full blast, as it is to-day, and in less\r\nthan a single administration there would be nothing left of it but\r\na crumpled hat, an old white coat, and a mass of blackened bones.\r\nAs honest Western people, let us take care of our honest Western\r\nstatesmen. Let us have a care for the reputation of the men whom\r\nwe have trusted in war and in peace, and who have never yet proved\r\nrecreant to the trust.\r\n\r\nDear Republican: Let us dedicate this letter to our sister State,\r\nIowa, most honest, virtuous, best beloved niece of Uncle Sam. A\r\ngreeting to the Hawkeyes. May their shadows never grow less, and may\r\nher thousands of domestic fires that now dot every hill, slope and\r\nvalley be never extinguished until the sun and the stars shall pole\r\ntogether and creation be swallowed up in everlasting night.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBINGHAM AND BUTLER.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THESE CONGRESSIONAL GIANTS IN DEBATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 27, 1867_.\r\n\r\nScarcely has the day dawned upon the Fortieth Congress before it is\r\nour unpleasant task to chronicle its decline. As we say about the\r\nmonth that gave it birth, “it came in like a lion and goes out like\r\na lamb.” At the beginning of the session mutterings of impeachment\r\ngrowled and thundered in the political horizon, but for some\r\nunaccountable but wise reason it has all subsided, and the passing\r\naway is peculiarly quiet and lamb-like. It almost reminds one of\r\na young maiden dying because of the loss of a recreant lover. The\r\nJudiciary Committee are expected to sit all summer on the impeachment\r\neggs; but no woman is so unwise as to count the chickens before\r\nthey are hatched. It is said that Congress has tied the hands of\r\nthe President so that he is perfectly incapable of doing any more\r\nmischief, and the members go home, and leave Washington desolate.\r\nWashington is a live city. It has two states of existence, sleeping\r\nand waking. When Congress is in session it is wide awake; when\r\nCongress adjourns it goes to sleep, and then woe to the unfortunate\r\nletter-writer, for her occupation is gone--everything is gone--the\r\ngreat men, the fashionable women; the great dining-room in the\r\nprincipal hotels are all closed, small eating houses disappear; even\r\nstores of respectable size draw in their principal show windows,\r\nwhich proves to the world that they were only “branches” thrown out\r\nfrom the original bodies, which can be found either in Philadelphia\r\nor New York, and that the branches never were expected to take root\r\nin Washington. Only the clerks in office, the real honey bees in the\r\ngreat national hive, work, and work incessantly, and keep Washington\r\nfrom degenerating into an enchanted city, such as we read about in\r\nthe Arabian tales.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of writing Congress is expected immediately to adjourn.\r\nThe members are in their seats, with the exception of the Honorable,\r\nBen Butler, who at this instant has the floor. He is talking about\r\n“confiscated property,” and an observer can see that he has taken the\r\ncubic measure of the subject. He is interrupted every few moments,\r\nbut his equilibrium is not in the least disturbed. As his photographs\r\nare scattered broadcast over the land, a pen-and-ink portrait is\r\nunnecessary. But we will say that he is a disturbing element wherever\r\nhe “turns up,” or wherever he goes. It seems to be his fate to be\r\nall the time cruising about the “waters of hate.” No man in this\r\nbroad land is so fearfully hated as Benjamin F. Butler. We do not\r\nallude to the South, for that is a unit; but to other surroundings\r\nand associations. Some men are born to absorb the love of the whole\r\nhuman race, like the ill-fated Andre; others have the mystic power\r\nof touching the baser passions, and Honorable Benjamin F. Butler is\r\nmaster of this last terrible art. But it may be possible that he\r\nbears the same relation to the human family that a chestnut burr does\r\nto the vegetable world, and if we could only open the burr we might\r\nforget our bloody fingers and find ample reward for our pains.\r\n\r\nThese last days of a closing session have been marked by a war of\r\nwords waged between the Honorable John A. Bingham and General Butler.\r\nNow these little hand-to-hand fights are the very spice of politics\r\nwhen they happen between the opposite ranks. But when Republican\r\nmeasures lance with Republican, when the war is of a fratricidal\r\ncharacter, and brother gluts his hand in his brother’s blood, then\r\nit becomes the nation to take these unruly members tenderly by the\r\nhand and to mourn after the most approved fashion. It cannot be said\r\nthat Honorable James A. Bingham has the manners of a Chesterfield,\r\nbut we shall widely differ from letter-writers who call him\r\n“Mephistopheles.” There is nothing satanic about him. He is only a\r\nvery able man, terribly in earnest. When he puts his hand to the\r\nwheel he never looks back. Whatever he undertakes must be carried out\r\nto the bitter end. If he has seemed conservative, it was only that\r\nhe might not make haste too fast. He has been the useful brakeman in\r\nCongress this winter; never in the way when the locomotive was all\r\nright and the track was clear. Those wicked side-thrusts from General\r\nButler in regard to Mrs. Surratt have wounded him, and he chafes like\r\na caged tiger; but he can comfort himself with the idea that there\r\nis one the less of the so-called gentler sex to perpetrate mischief,\r\nand that a few more might be dealt with in the same summary, gentle\r\nmanner, if the wants of the community or the ends of justice seemed\r\nto demand it.\r\n\r\nJohn Morrissey is in his seat, and, to all appearances, he is on the\r\nroyal road to one kind of success. Everybody feels kindly towards him\r\nbecause he is so unpretending, and he has the magic touch which makes\r\nfriends. Quiet, gentlemanly, and unassuming, his voice is never heard\r\nexcept when it is called for or when it is proper for his reputation\r\nthat he should speak. If he would only slough off the old chrysalis\r\nlife--yea, cut himself adrift from those gambling houses in New\r\nYork, he might prove to the world that there is scarcely any error\r\nof a man’s life can not be retrieved. We trust that John Morrissey\r\nwill remember that Congress is a fiery furnace; that it separates\r\nthe dross from the pure metal; and that, in this wonderful alembic,\r\nmen’s minds and manners are tested with all the nicety of chemical\r\nanalysis. Also, that the cream comes to the top and the skim milk\r\ngoes to the bottom and will continue to do so unless a majority of\r\nthe members can prevail on old Mother Nature to add a new amendment\r\nto her “constitution.”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WEST END RECEPTION.\r\n\r\nTHE MODES AND METHODS OF A TYPICAL SOCIETY FUNCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 15, 1868_.\r\n\r\nA gradual change is coming over the face of events in Washington.\r\nThe old monarchy’s dying. Andrew Johnson is passing away. If it were\r\nsummer, grass would be growing between the stones of the pavement\r\nthat leads to the stately porch of the Executive Mansion, but the\r\nmotion of the political and social wheel of life is not in the least\r\nretarded. In many respects it would seem as if time were taking us\r\nbackward in its flight and that we were living over again the last\r\nluxurious days of Louis XV. If Madame Pompadour is not here in the\r\nflesh, she has bequeathed to this brilliant Republican court her\r\nunique taste in the shape of paint-pots, rouge, patches, pointed\r\nheels, and frilled petticoats; the dress made with an immense train\r\nat the back, but so short in front that it discloses a wealth of\r\nairy, fantastic, white muslin; the square-necked waist, so becoming\r\nto a queenly neck; the open sleeve so bewitching for a lovely arm.\r\nThis is the “style” which the fair belles of the capital have\r\nadopted. Our letters are meant to embody both political and social\r\nthemes; but, if the truth must be told, the business of the people\r\nof the United States is suffering for want of being transacted.\r\nOur great men are too busy with the tangled skein of the next\r\nadministration. Although half the present session has slipped away,\r\nscarcely anything has been accomplished. The real hard work is\r\nrepresented by the lobby, which is as ceaselessly and noiselessly at\r\nwork as the coral builders in the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler is trying to enlighten the nation upon the knotty\r\nsubject of finance. He seems to have taken the dilemma by the horns.\r\nIt is not decided which will get the best of it, but the people\r\ncan rest assured that General Butler will make a good fight. Like\r\nAndrew Johnson, he has only to point to his past record. It will\r\nbe remembered that the gallant General paid his respects to the\r\nstep-father of his country on New Year’s day. An eye witness of this\r\nhistorical event pronounced the “scene” extremely “touching” and\r\none long to be remembered by the fortunate beholders. A sensational\r\nwriter is engaged upon a new drama founded upon this theme. It will\r\nsoon be brought out upon the boards at the National Theater under\r\nthe high-sounding title of “Burying the Hatchet.” The writer of the\r\ndrama is at a loss whether to call this production comedy or tragedy.\r\nIt would be extremely comic, only the closing scene ends with Andy’s\r\nplumping the hatchet into the grave from sheer exhaustion, and the\r\nmoment afterward he glides away into obscurity like a graceful\r\nOphidian, or Hamlet’s ghost. The wily warrior is left master of the\r\nsituation; not at all shut up like a fly in a bottle, but still able\r\nto be of use not only to his constituents but to the masses of his\r\nadmiring countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut why talk politics when the social strata is so much more\r\ninteresting? It is the social star which is in the ascendent to-day.\r\nThe new Cabinet is discussed in shy little nods and whispers, between\r\nsips of champagne and creamy ices, in magnificent drawing rooms at\r\nthe fashionable West End. Aye, why not give our dear Chicago friends\r\na description of the most brilliant party of the season, which took\r\nplace at the handsome residence of a merchant prince and member of\r\nCongress, the Honorable D. McCarthy, of Syracuse, N. Y. As the guests\r\nwere brought together by card invitations, it follows that only the\r\ncream of Washington society was represented. To be sure there was a\r\ncrowd; but then, it is not so very uncomfortable to be pressed to\r\ndeath by the awful enginery of a foreign minister, a major-general\r\nand a Vice-President elect, or to find yourself buried alive by\r\ndrifts of snowy muslin or costly silk or satin, and your own little\r\nfeet inextricably lost by being entangled in somebody’s train, and\r\nyourself sustained in the trying position by being held true to the\r\nperpendicular by the close proximity of your next neighbor. This can\r\nbe borne by the most sensitive, owing to the delicate nature of the\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\nBetween the hours of 9 and 10, and many hours afterwards, carriage\r\nafter carriage rolled up to the stately mansion, lately occupied by\r\nour present minister to England. Two savage policemen guarded the\r\ngate, and the coming guests slipped through their fingers as easily\r\nas if they had been attaches of the whisky ring. Once out of the\r\ncarriage you found yourself standing upon the dainty new matting,\r\nfrom which your feet never departed until they pressed the Persian\r\ncarpet of the inner hall. All wrapped and hooded and veiled, you\r\nascended the broad staircase to find at the first landing an American\r\ncitizen, of bronze complexion and crispy hair, who led you to the\r\nladies’ dressing-room. Handmaidens of the African type instantly\r\nseized you and divested you of your outward shell or covering. A\r\ndainty French lady’s maid stood ready to give the last finish to\r\nyour toilet or to coax into place any stubborn, mulish curl, and\r\nto repair, if it was necessary, any little damage or flaw to your\r\notherwise faultless complexion. When you were “all right,” you\r\nfound your attendant cavalier awaiting you at the door to conduct\r\nyou, as well as himself, to the presence of the sun and moon of the\r\nevening, around whom all this growing planetary system revolved.\r\nA cryer at the door calls out the name of the cavalier and lady,\r\nin a stentorian voice. You shudder. This is the first plunge into\r\nfashionable life; but you come to the surface and find that you are\r\nface to face with the duke and duchess, in the republican sense of\r\nthe word. Your hand is first taken by Mr. McCarthy, who is a tall\r\nand elegant person, whom you also know to be one of the “solid\r\nmen” in Congress, as he certainly is without. You next touch the\r\nfinger tips of “my lady,” a noble matron in purple velvet, old point\r\nlace, and flashing diamonds. At her right hand stand her two pretty\r\ndaughters, with real roses in their cheeks, and real complexions,\r\ndelicate enough to have been stolen from milky pearls. No jewels but\r\ntheir bright eyes. No color in their faultless white muslin dress,\r\nexcept little flecks of green that underlie the rich Valenciennes.\r\nYou leave them, and smuggle yourself in the enclosures of a deep,\r\nold-fashioned window. The curtain half hides you while you gaze upon\r\na shifting, glittering panorama, more gorgeous than a midsummer\r\nnight’s dream. The air is laden with the perfume of rare exotics and\r\nthe fragrance of the countless handkerchiefs of cob-web lace. Just\r\nbeyond you at the right stands the servant of Her Majesty, Victoria\r\nof England. There is nothing to denote his rank or position in his\r\nplain citizen’s dress. A modest order, worn on his left breast,\r\ntells you that he is the successor of Sir Frederick Bruce; but in\r\npersonal appearance Sir Edward Thornton bears no resemblance to\r\nhis illustrious predecessor. He seems to be enjoying an animated\r\nconversation with a lady of rank belonging to his own legation.\r\nMonsieur the French Minister, exquisite, dandified, polished as a\r\nsteel rapier, is talking to the host of the evening. Count Raasloff,\r\nthe Danish minister, is exchanging compliments with Major-General\r\nHunter. Though all the grand entertainments in Washington are graced\r\nby many of the diplomats resident here, they seem to get through\r\nthe evening as if it were a part of their official duty. They cling\r\ntogether like any other colony surrounded by “outside barbarians.”\r\nThe marble face of a petite French countess never relaxed a line from\r\nits icy frigidity until she found herself stranded in the dressing\r\nroom up stairs, safely in the hands of the foreign waiting-maid.\r\nThen such chattering--the artificial singing birds in the supper\r\nroom were entirely eclipsed. But let us leave at once these cold,\r\nhaughty dames, who have nothing to boast of but the so-called blue\r\nblood in their veins. The world would never know they existed, unless\r\nsome pen-artist sketched their portraits. We have had no dazzling\r\nforeign star in society here since the departure of Lady Napier.\r\nOh! spirit of a fairy godmother, guide our pen while we touch our\r\nown American belles, the fairest sisterhood under the sun. “Who is\r\nthe belle of the ball room to-night?” every one asks. You must not\r\nbe told her name, reader, but you shall know everything else. Just\r\nimagine Madame Pompadour in the palmiest days of her regal beauty,\r\nstepping out of the old worm-eaten frame, imbued with life and clad\r\nin one of those white brocaded silks upon which has been flung the\r\nmost exquisite flowers by the hand of the weaver. Hair puffed and\r\nfrizzled and curled until the lady herself could not tell where the\r\nreal leaves off and the false begins. The front breadth of dress\r\nis not more than half a yard in depth, but the long-pointed train\r\nat the back could not be measured by the eye; a yard-stick must be\r\nbrought into requisition. There is a dainty little patch on her left\r\ncheek, and another still less charming on her temple. A necklace of\r\nrare old-fashioned mosaic is clasped around her throat, and a member\r\nof Congress from Iowa, who is said to be a judge, pronounces her\r\nto be the most beautiful woman in Washington. Oh! that newspaper\r\nletters did not have to come to an end. Room for one of Chicago’s\r\nfair brides, the only beloved daughter of Senator Harlan, Mr. Robert\r\nLincoln’s accomplished wife. She looked every inch the lily in this\r\nsisterhood of flowers. She wore heavy, corded white silk, with any\r\nquantity of illusion and pearls.\r\n\r\nSo far hath the story been told without a word about the feast. The\r\nland, the sky and the ocean were rifled, and made to pay tribute to\r\nthe occasion. Artificial singing birds twittered in the flowers that\r\nadorned the tables, while a rainbow of light encircled the same. This\r\nbeautiful effect was accomplished by the gas-fitter’s art, and this\r\nexquisite device came very near bringing Chicago to grief, for the\r\nHonorable N. B. Judd found himself at the end of the magic bow, but\r\ninstead of finding the bag of gold he just escaped a good “scorching.”\r\n\r\nAgain we touched the hand of the lady hostess, and then all was over.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE ARENA OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. NYE AND DOOLITTLE CROSS BLADES IN IDEAS AND ARGUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 26, 1868_.\r\n\r\nAgain the Senate chamber recalls the early days of the rebellion, or\r\nrather the last stormy winter before its culmination. The galleries\r\nare densely crowded; the voice of eloquence is heard ringing in\r\nclarion notes through the hall; but in place of the handsome,\r\nsneering face of Breckinridge as presiding officer, rare old Ben Wade\r\nrises, like a sun of promise, to light up the troubled waters, and\r\nto help warn the ship of the Republic off the rocky shore. Scarcely\r\na drop in the river of time since haughty Wigfall arose, and, with\r\nright hand clenched defiantly in the face of the Republican side,\r\nhis flaming eye resting upon Charles Sumner, declared that he owed\r\nno allegiance to the Government of the United States. It was the\r\nforked flames licking the marble column, for Senator Sumner sat calm\r\nand immovable as the figure of Fate. Gone, too, is Davis, the man\r\nof destiny; and Toombs, the swaggering braggart, with silver-voiced\r\nBenjamin, the only human being endowed with the same melodious,\r\nflute-like tongue that bewitched our dear first mother. And yet there\r\nis treason enough left to act as leaven in case Senator Doolittle\r\nand the President succeed in introducing it into the loaf of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nTo-day two of the most warlike as well as two of the most powerful\r\nmen in the Senate have been engaged in real battle; but instead of\r\nmuscle against muscle, the air has been filled with javelins of\r\narguments and ideas. Let the pen be content with describing the two\r\ncombatants--Senator Doolittle, of Wisconsin, and Senator Nye, of\r\nNevada.\r\n\r\nThe battle, like Massachusetts, speaks for itself. Senator Doolittle,\r\nthe President’s spirit of darkness, bears the same relation to\r\nthe human race that a bull-dog does to the canine species. His\r\narguments are tough and sharp as a row of glittering teeth, and\r\nwould do the same horrible execution if the President and small\r\nparty of barking Democracy at his heels were strong enough to tell\r\nhim “to go in and win.” Rather above the medium height, built for\r\nstrength, like a Dutch clipper, with close cropped hair and broad,\r\nprojecting lower jaw, it must have been an accident that made him\r\nlet go of the Republican platform, or he must have been choked off\r\nby a power entirely beyond his control. But now that he is fast\r\nhold of a different faith; no resolution of a Wisconsin senate, no\r\nbitter protest of an indignant, injured constituency, can shake him\r\none hair’s breadth. And to this powerful makeup a pair of glistening\r\nsteel-gray eyes, a presence easier felt than described, and you have\r\nplenty of material out of which to construct a triple-headed Cerebus\r\nstrong enough to guard the gates of--even the Executive mansion.\r\n\r\nHis antagonist, Senator Nye, of Nevada, has the finest head in the\r\nAmerican Senate. Mother Nature must have expended her strength and\r\nmeans in the handsome head and broad shoulders. It must have been\r\noriginally meant that he should stand six feet and an inch or two in\r\nhis stocking feet, yet by some of those accidents which never can\r\nbe guarded against, he is scarcely of the average height. His face\r\npresents one of those rare spectacles, those strange combinations, in\r\nwhich intellect and beauty are striving for supremacy.\r\n\r\nEyes of that indescribable hazel that light up with passion or\r\nemotion, like an evening dress under the gaslight. Nose chiseled with\r\nthe precision of the sculptor’s skillful steel, and a mouth in which\r\ndwells character, passion, and all the graces, neatly fringed by a\r\ndecent beard, as every respectable man’s should be. Hands small and\r\nbloodless, the usual accompaniment of the powerful brain of an active\r\nthinker. Last, but not least, there is enough electricity about him\r\nto send a first-class message around the world, with plenty left for\r\nall home purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Senate chamber is a painful place for the eye to rest this\r\nwinter. Its furniture, carpets, and many other etceteras are\r\nsuggestive of molten heat. There is a flaming red carpet on the\r\nfloor, and every chair and sofa blushes like a carnation rose. Red\r\nand yellow stare the unfortunate Senator in the face whichever\r\nway he turns. Even what little sunlight manages to sneak into\r\nthis celebrated chamber steals in clothed in those two prismatic,\r\nnightmare colors. When the galleries are packed, as they were to-day,\r\nthere is scarcely more air than in an exhausted receiver, and it is\r\nastonishing that so many delicate women can remain so many hours\r\nsubjected to such an atmosphere. And now that the galleries are\r\nsprinkled with dark fruit, thick as a briery hedge in blackberry\r\ntime; this, taken into consideration, with many other wise reasons,\r\nmay help to account for the large Democratic gain in the late\r\nelection returns.\r\n\r\nNever within memory, not even during the extravagance of the late\r\nwar, have so many costly costumes adorned the persons of our American\r\nwomen as the present winter in Washington. And the Capitol, with its\r\noriental luxuriance, seems a fitting place for the grand display.\r\nA handsome blonde, enveloped in royal purple velvet, without being\r\nrelieved by so much as a shadow of any other color or material,\r\nbrings the words of the Psalmist to all thoughtful minds: “They toil\r\nnot, neither do they spin (or write), yet Solomon in all his glory\r\nwas not arrayed like one of these.”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEAKER COLFAX.\r\n\r\nHIS AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER--OTHER CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 2, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe season of Lent has folded its soft, brooding wings over the weary\r\ndevotees of fashion in Washington. Luxuriant wrappers, weak tea, and\r\nsoft-boiled eggs have succeeded the Eugenie trains, chicken salad,\r\nand all those delicious fluids that are supposed to brace the human\r\nform divine. The penitential season of Lent is just as fashionable,\r\nin its way, as the brilliant season which preceded it. There is\r\nnothing left for the “Jenkinses” but “to fold their tents like the\r\nArabs, and as silently steal away.”\r\n\r\nBut as hardy native flowers defy the chilly frost, so Speaker\r\nColfax’s hospitable doors swing upon their noiseless hinges once a\r\nweek, and the famous house known as the “Sickles mansion” becomes a\r\nbee-hive, swarming, overflowing with honeyed humanity; and let it be\r\nrecorded that no man in Washington is socially so popular, so much\r\nbeloved, as Schuyler Colfax. General Grant, the man who dwells behind\r\na mask, is worshiped by the multitudes, who rush to his mansion as\r\nHindoos to a Buddhist temple; but Schuyler Colfax possesses the magic\r\nquality of knowing how to leave the Speaker’s desk, and, gracefully\r\ndescending to the floor, place himself amongst the masses of the\r\nAmerican people, no longer above them, but with them, one of them--a\r\nking of hearts in his own right; a knave also, because he steals\r\nfirst and commands afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that all adjectives descriptive of fashionable\r\nlife at the capital have long since been worn thread-bare. Why didn’t\r\nJenkins tell the truth and say, instead of “warm cordiality, elegant\r\ncourtesy,” pump-handle indifference and metallic smile? Why did he\r\nnot tell the dear, good people at home the truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, and say that madame the duchess practices smiles or grimaces\r\nbefore the glass, and serves the same up to her dear friends at her\r\nevening receptions? Why should not a smile fit as well as her corsets\r\nor kid gloves? Too much smile without dimples to cover up the defect\r\ndestroys the harmonious relation of the features. Not only that, but\r\nit invites every fashionable woman’s horror. It paves the way to\r\nwrinkles, the death-blows of every belle.\r\n\r\n“Look at my face,” says Madame B----, of Baltimore, the widow of\r\nroyalty, the handsomest woman of three-score years and ten in\r\nAmerica, addressing one who shall be nameless. “You are not half\r\nmy age, and yet you have more wrinkles than I; shall I tell you\r\nwhy?” “To be sure, Madame B----.” “I never laugh; I never cry; I\r\nmake repose my study.” Now, let it be added that this aged belle of\r\na long-since-departed generation on every night encases her taper\r\nfingers in metallic thimbles, and has done so for the last forty\r\nyears; consequently her hand retains much of its original symmetry,\r\nand the decay of her charms is as sweet and as faultless as the\r\nfalling leaves of a rose.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Colfax’s receptions, in one sense of the word, are unlike\r\nall others. No prominent man in Washington receives his thousands\r\nof admirers and says to them, after an introduction, “This is my\r\nmother!” She stands by his side, with no one to separate them,\r\nbearing a strong personal resemblance to him, whilst she is only\r\nseventeen years the older. At what a tender age her love commenced\r\nfor this boy Schuyler--nobody else’s boy, though he were President!\r\nShe has put on the chameleon silk, and the cap with blue ribbons,\r\nto receive the multitudes that flock in masses to do homage to her\r\nson. Pride half slumbers in her bosom, but love is vigilant and\r\nwide awake. There is no metallic impression on her countenance; a\r\ngenuine, heartfelt welcome is extended to all who pay their respects\r\nto her idol. So the people come and go, and wonder why Speaker\r\nColfax’s receptions are unlike others. Only a very few stars of the\r\nfirst magnitude in the fashionable world shone at the Speaker’s\r\nmansion last night. The Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from\r\nIowa was there, with his elegant, lavender-robed wife--a woman\r\nwho skims over the treacherous waters of society in Washington as\r\ngracefully and safely as a swan upon its native element. David Dudley\r\nField, of New York, was there--a tall, stalwart man, after the oak\r\npattern; and the fine faced woman, with gold enough upon her person\r\nto suggest a return to specie payment, was said to be a new wife.\r\nMark Twain, the delicate humorist, was present; quite a lion, as he\r\ndeserves to be. Mark is a bachelor, faultless in taste, whose snowy\r\nvest is suggestive of endless quarrels with Washington washerwomen;\r\nbut the heroism of Mark is settled for all time, for such purity\r\nand smoothness were never seen before. His lavender gloves might\r\nhave been stolen from some Turkish harem, so delicate were they in\r\nsize; but more likely--anything else were more likely than that. In\r\nform and feature he bears some resemblance to the immortal Nasby;\r\nbut whilst Petroleum is brunette to the core, Twain is a golden,\r\namber-hued, melting blonde.\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress were there. George Washington Julian was present;\r\ngreat, gifted, good, as he always is, proving to the world that even\r\na great name cannot extinguish him. Nature was in one of her most\r\ngenerous moods when she formed him, for he towers above the people\r\nlike a mountain surrounded by hills. He dwells in a higher atmosphere\r\nand sniffs a purer air than most Congressmen, and this may account\r\nfor his always being found in the right place, never doubtful. People\r\nknow just what George Washington Julian will do in any national\r\ncrisis. So he is left alone to score the measures of his conscience,\r\njust as the earth is left to her orbit, or the magnetic needle to the\r\npole.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH COURT OF IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF LEADING COUNSEL AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 14, 1868_.\r\n\r\nWith lightning leap the historical proceedings of the “High Court\r\nof Impeachment” have flashed all over the country. The bone and\r\nsinew of the matter have been given to the people, but the delicate\r\nlife-currents and details which go to make the creation perfect, if\r\nnot gathered by the pen, must be buried in the waste-basket of old\r\nFather Time. Decorum, dignity, solemnity, are the order of the day,\r\nand one might as well attempt a “glowing description” of a funeral as\r\nto weave in bright colors the opening scenes of the greatest trial on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nOutside the Capitol, in the crowd, the incidents are beyond\r\ndescription. Men are there from all parts of the country, pleading,\r\nswearing for admittance--offering untold sums for a little\r\ninsignificant bit of pasteboard. But the police, stony, frightful\r\nas the “head of Medusa,” shut the doors in their faces, inexorable\r\nas the fiat of the tomb. A limited number of honest, tender-hearted\r\nSenators are trying to smuggle in a few beloved “outsiders;” but the\r\npolice are instantly convened into a “court of impeachment,” and\r\nthe unfortunate Senator has to bow before the majesty of the law.\r\nA ticket is the only open sesame, and a bit of yellow pasteboard\r\nso dazzles the multitudes that even Andrew Johnson is forgotten\r\nfor a time. But the fortunate ticket-holder, when once beyond the\r\nhurly-burly outside, finds that an entrance to a different atmosphere\r\nhas been attained. It is like leaving the famished, parched plain\r\nat the mountain’s foot and climbing up into the cool region, almost\r\namong the eternal snows. The Senate chamber, always chilly in\r\ncomparison with the warm, leaping blood of the House, is now wrapped\r\nin judicial robes of coldest gray. When it is remembered that\r\nSenators were allowed four tickets and members half that number,\r\nit will readily be understood that even the aristocracy had to be\r\nskimmed to fill the galleries, and with the exception of a few\r\nnewspaper correspondents, the chosen ones belong to or are attaches\r\nof the proudest families in the land. And it is a most significant\r\nfact that women hold nearly all the tickets. They sail into the\r\ngentlemen’s gallery like a real “man of war,” shake out the silken,\r\nfeathery crinoline, rub their little gloved hands in an ecstasy of\r\ndelight, and while perching their heads significantly on one side,\r\ngaze sorrowfully at the few forlorn men stranded amongst their\r\nnumber, either through accident or to prove to the world that the\r\ngenus man under the most trying circumstances is not extinct. As the\r\nSenate clock points to the hour of 1, Senator Wade leaves the chair,\r\nand Chief Justice Chase, robed in his judicial drapery, enters at a\r\nside door and takes the vacant seat. Very soon the managers of the\r\nimpeachment file in, Bingham and Boutwell taking the lead. A table\r\nfor their accommodation has been prepared, and as they take their\r\nseats the silence seems like the dead, unbroken calm inhabited only\r\nby time and space. The moment has arrived for the utterance of the\r\nmost solemn words ever echoed in the Senate of the United States--the\r\nproclamation of the Sergeant-at-Arms calling a recreant President to\r\nstand forth and prove his innocence or else meet the just punishment\r\nof his crime. A momentary silence follows, and the counsel for the\r\naccused advance and take their seats. That which was uncertainty is\r\nnow a positive fact.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson will not meet the august tribunal face to face. There\r\nis to be a state dinner in the evening at the White House, and if\r\nfeasting can be thought of at such an hour, it may be possible that\r\nhe is engaged on the bill of fare. Louis XV was engaged with his\r\npowders and paint box, Dubarry, Pompadour, and venison, when the\r\nstorm was brewing that destroyed his family and swept the innocent\r\nwith the guilty off the face of the earth. The counsel, three in\r\nnumber, face the tribunal. Mr. Stanbery is the first of the number\r\nto speak. Keen and hair-splitting, he seems to think he is going to\r\ncarry the day by storm. He rather demands forty days for preparation\r\ninstead of requesting it. He is followed by Mr. Bingham, who confines\r\nhimself entirely to the law, without the least flourish of rhetoric\r\nor word painting. Very soon the Senate retires for consultation. Then\r\nan hour and a half are devoted to gossip in the gallery, and one\r\nhas time to sweep the rows of seats with an opera glass and glean\r\nall the handsome faces; and if the whole truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth must be told, old Mother Nature (the more shame on her) has\r\nbeen just as niggardly and mean in dealing out “magnificent eyes”\r\nand “voluptuous forms” to the creme de la creme as if she were only\r\nmanaging the family affairs of some poor nobody who has not a ghost\r\nof a chance for Congressional or any other honor in our beloved\r\ncountry. A limited number of large solitaire diamonds were visible;\r\nbut good taste excludes nearly all diamonds except in full dress.\r\nAs this was the highest court in the land amongst men, it might as\r\njustly be said that it was the highest court of culture, refinement,\r\nfashion, and good taste amongst the women. If all the elements which\r\nmake men great, just, and wise were found on the floor, it can as\r\ntruthfully be said that the galleries were never filled by so much\r\npurity, so much that goes to make woman the connecting link between\r\nmen and the angels. Who is that noble woman with the silver hair?\r\nThe mother-in-law of Edwin M. Stanton. The other whose face time has\r\nmellowed to autumnal sweetness and perfection? The mother of Senator\r\nTrumbull. No, no; that picture of delicacy and grace, arrayed in\r\nsilk tinted with the shade of a dead forest leaf, with dead gold\r\nornaments to match? Why, that is the queen of fashion--the wife of a\r\nSenator, the daughter of Chief Justice Chase.\r\n\r\nNo more time to notice those chosen amongst the women. The Senate has\r\nassembled, and General Butler has the floor. He takes the largest,\r\nmost comprehensive view of the case. He is going to make his mark\r\nupon the age, if he has not already. He seems the very incarnation of\r\nforce and will. He is followed by Judge Nelson of Tennessee, one of\r\nthe President’s counsel. Originally a preacher, I am told, he brings\r\nthe same kind of persuasion to bear upon the Senate that he would\r\nupon rebellious sinners. As the Senate do not look upon themselves\r\nin that light, it follows that something more substantial will have\r\nto be used; but, as the President has chosen each of his counsel for\r\ncertain personal qualifications, it is very probable that he expects\r\nnothing but flowery sentiment from him--the ornamental, instead of\r\nthe useful. Judge Curtis, the ablest of the President’s counsel,\r\nsaid but very little, seeming well content with Judge Nelson’s waste\r\nof words. Wilson, of Iowa, one of the ablest judicial minds in the\r\ncountry, made a few remarks, of which law was the cubic measure; and,\r\nafter some amendments and voting, the day and the people vanished;\r\nand thus ended one of the great historical days of the age.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. SENATOR WADE.\r\n\r\nTHE MAKER OF AND SHARER IN HER HUSBAND’S TRIUMPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 17, 1868_.\r\n\r\nA calm steals over the restless political waters, and whilst we are\r\nwaiting for the next act in the great drama let us draw near those\r\nwho, by the sudden turn of the wheel of fate, are lifted high above\r\nthe multitude. Never, even in the days of the French Revolution, have\r\nthe women performed more conspicuous parts in the national play of\r\npolitics than at the present time in Washington. It can truthfully\r\nbe said that there is nothing so malignant and heart-rending in its\r\neffects upon a good man as the burning desire to be President. God\r\nhelp the man when this iron has entered his soul, for this fiery\r\nambition drinks up every other sweet virtue, just as the July sun\r\nlicks up the purling brook and precious dew drop. It is not man alone\r\nwho is consumed by ambition; it is woman also, who, in this as well\r\nas in everything else, often takes the lion’s share. It was Eve who\r\nfirst ate of the fruit, and gave it unto Adam, and he did partake of\r\nit also. It is a woman who apparently has everything that the visible\r\nor invisible world has to bestow, and yet, like the princess in the\r\nfairy tale, deems her place incomplete unless a roc’s egg is hung in\r\nthe centre of the jeweled chamber. There is only one position at the\r\n“republican court” that this most elegant woman has not attained.\r\nShe has never “reigned” at the White House. Every other triumph has\r\npalled upon her taste, and if the nation would like the finest and\r\namongst the largest of diamonds in the country to glisten in the\r\nExecutive Mansion, and the most graceful and queenly woman of the\r\nday to eat bread and honey in the national pantry, they will hasten\r\nto withdraw their support from any military chieftain, and bestow the\r\nawful burden upon a man who at this very moment is staggering under\r\nas much as any faithful public servant can very well carry.\r\n\r\nCome, reader; let us leave the dusty highway of frivolity and\r\nfashion. Come into the cool, refreshing shade. You are in the\r\npresence of the woman who, in all human probability, will be the\r\none above all others of her sex to whom the argus eyes of this\r\ngreat nation will soon be directed. She is in the full meridian of\r\nmiddle life, tall and distinguished-looking, as one would imagine\r\na Roman matron might be in the days of Italian glory, and it would\r\nseem that she is precisely such a mate as her bluff and out-spoken\r\nhusband would select for a life-long journey in double harness.\r\nIt is evident that he must have chosen for qualities that would\r\nwear under the most trying circumstances; and the material must\r\nhave met his expectations, else why should they bear such a strong\r\npersonal resemblance to each other--the very same expression of\r\ncountenance--unless they have suffered and rejoiced together, and\r\nhand in hand tasted the bitter with the sweet?\r\n\r\nIt is well known in Washington that Mrs. Wade has not the least\r\nambition to shine in the fashionable world; that she has been heard\r\nto express her exceeding distaste for the formal reception; it has\r\neven been whispered by those who ought to know that she has the\r\nold-fashioned love for the click of the knitting needles; and the\r\nnation may yet find out that the reason why Senator Wade has always\r\nstood so firm for the right was because his feet have been clad in\r\nstockings of domestic manufacture, for this is no more astonishing\r\nthan had Archimedes the slightest point on which to place his fulcrum\r\nhe might have moved the whole world.\r\n\r\nFor many years Mrs. Wade’s name has been prominently identified\r\nwith the public charitable institutions at Washington as well as\r\nelsewhere. Says the secretary of the “News-Boys’ Home:” “It is her\r\nprivate benevolence that will longest be remembered, for it is yet to\r\nbe known when a worthy object was sent from her presence unrelieved.”\r\n\r\nWhen we remember her scholarly culture, her extensive reading, and\r\nher acquaintance with the best minds of the age, would it not almost\r\nseem that this second tragedy, this suicide instead of assassination\r\nat the White House, was the providential means taken to purify the\r\nhalls of legislation at the very fountain head? For if Senator Wade\r\ndrifts into the Executive chair, through no fault or effort of his\r\nown, bound by no promise to friend or foe, what hinders him from\r\nseizing the helm of the ship of state, and, with the aid of Congress,\r\nguiding her out of the breakers into the calm, still waters of\r\nRepublican prosperity and peace? As only a Hercules can perform this\r\nlabor, this may account for the succession, as well as for Senator\r\nWade’s clear head, broad shoulders, and stout heart; and when it\r\nhappens that there will accompany him to the Executive Mansion the\r\nsame social atmosphere that characterized the days of Mrs. Adams and\r\nMrs. Madison, will it not seem like a return of the honest simplicity\r\nof our forefathers, or like the long-delayed perfecting of the\r\nRepublic’s youthful days?\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE PRESIDENT’S LEVEE.\r\n\r\nDISGUSTING MANNERS OF A MEMBER OF THE FRENCH LEGATION--HANDSOME\r\nGENERAL HANCOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 24, 1868_.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in every country the foreign diplomats are\r\namong the last to desert the reigning dynasty. There was a new\r\nillustration of the fact in the presence of so many ambassadors from\r\nabroad at the Executive Mansion last night. Conspicuous among the\r\nnumber was a representative of the French legation, Parisian to the\r\ncore, Johny Crapaud in all his glory. Instead of a nosegay, Louis\r\nNapoleon’s decorations dangled from a stray button-hole; and when we\r\nsay that his white kids were immaculate, that his necktie eclipsed\r\nthe proudest triumph of Beau Brummel, and that he was as plain in\r\nform and feature as only a Frenchman dare to be, we have a complete\r\npicture of foreign diplomacy, one item excepted. This was a little\r\njeweled opera-glass, carried in his left hand, and when our country\r\nwomen with bare, dazzling shoulders came within a certain distance of\r\nthis august person, instantly the glass was leveled to an exact angle\r\nwith the parts exposed, and with no more fear or hesitation than\r\nthe doctor who brings the microscope to bear upon a bit of porcine\r\ndelicacy when the cry of trichinæ is heard throughout the land.\r\nThis may be the perfection of French taste and good manners, but it\r\nis simply revolting to the American. There is a difference between\r\nprivate life and the public stage; between a Canterbury danseuse and\r\nthe daughter of a Senator. It is because we have treated foreigners\r\nso kindly, so forbearingly, that they have learned to despise us.\r\n\r\nBetween the hours of 8 and 11 the Executive Mansion was thronged by\r\na crowd, in many senses of the word truly dramatic. There were those\r\nwho went to see the “show” and those who were there on exhibition.\r\nThere is no surer sign of deterioration in entertainments than the\r\nabsence of women, and last night the men outnumbered the gentler\r\nsex ten to one. No doubt these masculines were drawn there to show\r\ntheir sympathy or gratify their curiosity; but President Johnson\r\nseemed indifferent to all surroundings. His unreadable face was\r\nlighted up by smiles, and when Jenkins tells the world that he\r\n“received his friends with cordiality, and elegant hospitality,”\r\nhe will probably be telling as near the truth as Jenkins, by his\r\nprofession, is allowed to come. The President was flanked by his\r\nillustrious Cabinet, with one exception. The head was represented by\r\nthe so-called Secretary of State, and Secretary Thomas (ad interim)\r\nbrought this ingenious combination to an ignoble end. As the real\r\nSecretary of State was killed at or about the same time as our\r\nlamented Lincoln, it would seem that the present incumbent is allowed\r\nto tarry in order to prove to the world what a fearful thing it is to\r\noutlive a once useful, honorable and perfectly rounded life. Let this\r\ngreat, warm-hearted nation forgive him, and inscribe on his living\r\nheadstone: “Here lies the man who brought on his death by wanting to\r\nbe President.”\r\n\r\nSecretary McCulloch, sleek, oily, blonde-haired, helped to relieve\r\nthe background of the Presidential picture; and to look at him\r\none would hardly realize that he is the rock upon which so many\r\nofficeseekers’ hopes have been split; and yet there is a certain snap\r\nabout his mouth that would remind one of a tobacco-box shut up and\r\nput away for future use. A fine-faced, matronly woman clung to his\r\narm, clad in shimmering sea of green moire antique, with almost any\r\nnumber of milky pearls on her person, and strangers called her Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch. Father Gideon occupied the same position and appeared\r\nin the same attitude that he does in the great historical picture\r\npainted by Carpenter. Ever since he has come into possession of the\r\ngoose that lays the golden egg he has helped every President to a\r\nseat on his shoulders, just as Sinbad was aided by the “Old Man of\r\nthe Sea;” and if our next President becomes saddled, it is only\r\nthe seal of the great Solomon or more than mortal heroism that can\r\ncope with this naval magician, for to all appearance he is to be a\r\nnational fixture for all time to come. Secretary Browning is a medium\r\nsized, sunny-faced man, attractive as a streaked apple. He had a\r\nyouthful, pretty woman on his arm, and it was apparent to everybody\r\nthat if any one resigned his Department in order to attend to the\r\nPresident, or other important business, affairs would be looked after\r\nas faithfully as the Attorney-General’s, or with the same diligent\r\nroutine that stamps him an efficient Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hancock was there, the handsomest man a woman’s eyes ever\r\nrested upon in the military service. No matter about his record\r\nin New Orleans; no matter about the dubious reasons that brought\r\nhim to Washington. Queen Bess, one of the greatest women that ever\r\nlived, would have made him prime minister at once, and if Andrew\r\nJohnson wishes to emulate this illustrious woman, and add glory to\r\nhis declining reign, none but a Senate lost to the most exquisite\r\nemotions will interfere. Towering a whole head and shoulders above\r\nforeign ministers and all others in the room, one’s eyes must be\r\nraised to view the stars on his shoulders, just as they are lifted to\r\nthe flaming star that rests upon the strap of Perseus, proving him to\r\nbe one of the greatest generals in the heavens.\r\n\r\nHeretofore a President’s levee has been a fair sample of different\r\nlayers of society; this last one has been the exception. There were\r\nthe President’s few confidential advisers, and those allied to him\r\nthrough interest who remained in the room with him, dividing and\r\nsharing the honor which they must feel is slipping away. Secretary\r\nSeward received by the side of Mrs. Patterson. General Hancock\r\nheld his reception a short distance from the President; whilst the\r\npoliceman on duty and Marshal Gooding, who has to perform the task\r\nof introduction, looked as if they wished the farce was over. The\r\nEast Room seemed an immense bee-hive, swarming with black-coated\r\nhoneybees, and if the truth must certainly be told, the queens\r\nwere as scarce as in any other well-behaved, respectable hive. At\r\nprecisely 11 o’clock the Marine Band tied up their shining horns and\r\nscattered in the darkness, the guests vanished, and the Executive\r\nMansion was left to its uneasy dreams.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY CLEMMER AMES.\r\n\r\nTRIBUTE TO THE TALENTED CORRESPONDENT OF THE NEW YORK INDEPENDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 31, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day of the trial of the great impeachment case is\r\nmade memorable by the speech of Benjamin F. Butler. Whilst he\r\nwas completing his tower of brilliancy and logic, the lightning\r\nwas playing with the beginning of it, and when he had finished\r\nthe great cities of the Union were as wise as we who sat within\r\nthe sound of his voice. The struggle to obtain tickets equalled,\r\nif it did not exceed, the opening day of the trial, and the same\r\nelegant, aristocratic crowd filled the galleries, the women, as\r\nusual, outnumbering the men. The only really odious thing connected\r\nwith the trial is the ticket system. Suppose a crowd does gather\r\nin the Capitol, the most perfect order prevails, and there are so\r\nmany police on duty that it is very easy to protect the Senate and\r\npush back the waves of humanity. The grocer’s wife, the humblest\r\ncitizen, has just as much right to hear the impeachment trial as\r\nthe wife or the friend of a Congressman; and when the galleries are\r\nproperly filled, what hinders the police from meeting the late comers\r\nand turning their unwilling footsteps away? Anything that smacks\r\nof aristocracy or exclusiveness should instantly be put under the\r\nfeet of every American citizen. It is the masses who are the real\r\naristocracy, because they are the source of all power; and the moment\r\nour public servants dare to draw lines that in any way interfere with\r\nthis great, good-natured maelstrom, the least of this mass can put a\r\nstone in a sling which will do as good execution as the pebble of the\r\nimmortal David.\r\n\r\nSenator Wade has left the chair and Chief Justice Chase immediately\r\nsucceeds him. For an instant let us survey this cold, haughty,\r\nhandsome face. Not for a moment could one imagine fire coursing along\r\nhis veins. His lips move, but only inarticulate sound reaches the\r\ngallery. The New York _Independent_ must be mistaken when it says\r\n“he has become the friend of Andrew Johnson, the idol of the young\r\nDemocracy.” Ambition may consume him with its unquenchable fire, but\r\nwith the corpse of William H. Seward before his eyes he will never\r\ncommit suicide. The Senate chamber is as quiet as a vaulted tomb.\r\nThe orator of the day arises, and thousands of eyes are brought\r\nto a sudden focus. Benjamin F. Butler has the floor. History has\r\nassociated the name of Burke with Warren Hastings; and inseparably\r\nlinked must be the names of Butler and Andrew Johnson. Mr. Butler\r\nis not an orator. He did not attempt to impress a jury. He simply\r\nread a great speech to the whole country, expecting the people to\r\nread it after him, and weigh its arguments discriminately; to note\r\nthe strong points, and feel that Benjamin F. Butler had proved\r\nhimself equal to the task imposed upon him as a trusted servant of\r\nthe American people. In making up the gifts for this rare son, it\r\nmust be said that Old Mother Nature denied him beauty; but he had\r\nmanaged to outwit the fickle old dame and come out even with her at\r\nlast, for amongst the few beautiful women in the gallery Blanche\r\nButler, the petite daughter, was fairest amongst the fair. “What\r\na strong resemblance between the two!” you say. The crooked eyes\r\nare straightened, a little added to their size, and the same fire\r\nis flung into them both. In one case you have a pair of Oriental\r\nalmonds, seen nowhere outside of Correggio’s Madonnas. In the other,\r\nyou have eyes belonging to Benjamin Butler. The description ends.\r\nThere is nothing on earth out of which to manufacture comparison.\r\n\r\nIn the exclusive crowd which filled the galleries, it may be said\r\nthere were two grand divisions--the aristocracy and the press. The\r\nfirst named were elevated to their seats by their social relations;\r\nthe latter by the divine right of being anointed sovereigns in the\r\nworld of mind, born to their inheritance, like the Bourbons and\r\nHapsburgs. Conspicuous amongst the limited but strictly exclusive set\r\nmight be seen the delicate, _spiritual_ face of Mary Clemmer Ames, of\r\nthe New York _Independent_. She writes poetry; the newspapers tell\r\nus all that. She also writes stately, solemn prose. Sometimes it is\r\nbitter and pungent, as many of our public men know. How easy and\r\nsmooth the machinery of her mind must work! There are no sudden jars\r\nin the cogwheels of her brain, for her face is almost as smooth as\r\na dimpled babe’s. She is pure womanly, from the low, handsome brow\r\nto the taper fingers, and when the time comes that woman shall stand\r\nupon the true platform of equality and justice Mary Clemmer Ames,\r\nwith all the rest of the same sisterhood, will be remembered as the\r\nnoble pioneers whose united efforts alone achieved the great work.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of women in the world of mind, Anna E. Dickinson addressed a\r\nfashionable audience here last night, and as we have taken a solemn\r\noath to say nothing but honest words we must say that we don’t like\r\nto hear her talk. That she is brilliant and gifted, that Philadelphia\r\nhas reason to be proud of this talented child, it were useless to\r\ndeny. But God help the woman when honey no longer drops from her\r\nlips, when nothing but gall issues from the coral crevice! She gives\r\nthe Republican party no credit for what it has done, but only heaps\r\nabuse and scurrility upon it because it has not done more. She hurls\r\narguments at the heads with sledge-hammer blows, but she forgets\r\nto use woman’s strongest, surest, most fatal weapon--that jeweled,\r\nnameless, enchanted dagger, that, if found in the hand of the weakest\r\namong us, never fails of reaching the heart.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL.\r\n\r\n“AD INTERIM” THOMAS FLAYED BY GENERAL BUTLER--KINDNESS OF THE WIFE OF\r\nSENATOR WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 14, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe interest surrounding the impeachment trial deepens. The blows\r\nof the aggressive Butler are met and sometimes parried by the sharp\r\nrapier of Evarts or the stout claymore of Stanbery. The President has\r\nwisely chosen some of the subtlest minds in the country to defend\r\nhim, and it is almost worth the fruit of a lifetime to sit in the\r\npresence of such a court, the jury composed of the choicest men of\r\neach sister State, the lawyers upon both sides the picked men of the\r\ncountry, whilst some of the witnesses have a world-wide reputation,\r\nand the spectators, with but few exceptions, are rare exotics,\r\ngathered from the best hothouses in the land.\r\n\r\nThe sparring on both sides during Friday and Saturday was a perfect\r\nfeast to those who like to see mind meet mind--who enjoy the din and\r\ncrash of ideas; but what is the use of stirring up the cesspool into\r\nwhich Andrew Johnson has plunged, and for whom there is no earthly\r\nresurrection? Is not the country sick unto death of these poisonous\r\nexhalations? Andrew Johnson has broken the laws of the land. In the\r\nname of the humblest citizen, what can be offered in his defence?\r\n\r\nThe Sage of the _Tribune_ says, “Stick to the point, gentlemen; stick\r\nto the point,” and a placard to this effect should be paraded before\r\ntheir eyes in every loyal paper of the country. The President’s\r\nconversations with General Sherman and other officers are of no more\r\nimportance to the people of the United States than his delicate\r\nsemi-official talk with Mrs. Cobb. If we are to have one, why not\r\nthe other? Why not let the land shake its rocky sides, and one broad\r\ngrin stretch its awful mouth from Plymouth Rock to the silver sands\r\nof the Pacific slope? “Stick to the point, gentlemen; stick to the\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\nFor all future time General Lorenzo Thomas will be known only as “Ad\r\nInterim” Thomas. Even the newsboys cry, “Here’s your evening paper.\r\nTestimony of ‘Ad Interim.’” If the poet had only lived long enough to\r\nhave seen this man he would never have written, “Frailty, thy name\r\nis woman!” unless he had put in a clause intimating that sometimes\r\nDame Nature in her haste makes mistakes; for Nature intended Lorenzo\r\nThomas to be feminine. She gave him a slender waist and sloping\r\nshoulders, arched instep and taper fingers, and in place of a beard\r\nplanted a few seed on his chin; and long years of cultivation have\r\nonly proved that some productions of nature will not flourish on a\r\nforeign soil. If any more proof were necessary it is his testimony\r\nbefore the Senate on Friday, when he says: “Mr. Stanton put his arm\r\naround my neck, as he used to do, in a familiar manner, and says--”\r\nNo matter about that. As the heroic and honorable Secretary of War\r\nthus far has made no mistake, is it not to be inferred that he knew\r\nwhat was so deftly hidden from mortal view? The spiritual intercourse\r\nbetween the two must have been complete.\r\n\r\nIf anything more was wanting to touch a sympathetic chord in every\r\nwoman’s soul in the vast galleries, to bring her nearer in sympathy\r\nwith Lorenzo Thomas, it was the cruel, merciless way in which General\r\nButler laid bare the heart of this interesting witness. He brought\r\nhis little amiable foibles and weaknesses to light of day, just as\r\nthe surgeon brings out the queer things with the dissecting knife.\r\nThe galleries breathed easy when the tortures were over.\r\n\r\nIt was refreshing, at last, to see the soldierly form of General\r\nSherman advancing to the witness stand. There are some handsomer\r\nmen in the Senate chamber at this moment, but none of finer or\r\nmore exquisite workmanship. The high forehead and eagle eyes; the\r\nthin, quivering nostril, and square manly shoulders; the muscles of\r\nwire-drawn steel. Like an exquisite stringed instrument, he must be\r\nkept up to concert pitch, and then follows such ravishing melody; but\r\nout of tune, or with a string broken, horrible discord would be sure\r\nto follow. He may be the best of husbands and fathers, but it is very\r\nplain that Nature was intent upon fashioning a good soldier, a leader\r\namongst men, and in this particular instance she had made no mistake.\r\n\r\nReader, let your mind’s eye wander to the galleries. At the right of\r\nthe diplomatic seats sits a woman reminding us of an English duchess.\r\nShe is not delicate or sylph-like; on the contrary, nothing shall be\r\nsaid about avoirdupois. She is elegant and distinguished looking. Her\r\nblack, flowing drapery is moire antique; a costly camel’s-hair shawl\r\nis thrown carelessly back from her shoulders, and lilac plumes dance\r\nand flutter with every turn of her head; amethysts and diamonds hang\r\nsuspended from her ears, and her left hand sparkles with the weight\r\nof a moderate fortune. Would you know her title? It is the same whose\r\nname flew all over the country in connection with the Prince of Wales\r\nat the time the Gothamites feasted the Prince and provided him with\r\na partner also. It will be remembered that on that most important\r\nevening the floor fell into the cellar, and there are people of\r\nto-day who are no wiser than to say, “No wonder! No wonder!” In the\r\nsky of wealth and fashion in Washington, this queenly woman is a\r\nflaming star of the first magnitude; or, more properly speaking, she\r\nis the Pleiades, Hyades, and possibly the “big dipper” also.\r\n\r\nAnd now, reader, you are to know about the wife of a Senator who is\r\nnot in her coveted seat to-day, for the reason that she has given to\r\none of her husband’s constituents her ticket, and, therefore, like\r\nthe humblest amongst us, has to remain at home. Would you know this\r\npure type of womanhood, who says with her own lips, “We owe more\r\nto our constituents than to ourselves”? Would you know the woman\r\nwhose sincere pity goes unchallenged amidst all this frivolity and\r\nwickedness, and whose unostentatious charity would be as refreshing\r\nand as broadcast as the evening dew if the source of supply was as\r\nunfailing as her own generous heart? Scarcely a public institution\r\nof charity exists in Washington without her name on the roll call\r\nand she alone gathered the first thousand dollars that made the\r\n“Newsboys’ Home” a success.\r\n\r\nThere are holy places in the mosque of the Moslems where only the\r\n“faithful” can tread with unsandaled feet, and there are some human\r\nlives so purified and exalted that only the pen of the Recording\r\nAngel is worthy to transfix their fleeting lights and shadows,\r\ntheir struggles in their upward flight. Ah! reader, would you know\r\nwhy Senator Wilson lies so close to the heart of cold, haughty\r\nMassachusetts; why he has the least of this world’s goods of any man\r\nin Congress; why he fights so manfully for the poor and down-trodden;\r\nwhy he is one of the most popular and best-beloved men in the land?\r\nIt is because he is strengthened and solaced and the armor for life’s\r\nbattle is girded on at home.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. BENJAMIN F. WADE.\r\n\r\nCONSIDERED THE PROPER SIZE FOR PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 21, 1868_.\r\n\r\nThe dying throes of the rebellion end with the impeachment trial.\r\nWhilst Grant crushed the head of the reptile in Virginia, and\r\nSherman’s swarming legions cut the monster in twain, it is left for\r\na loyal Congress to deal with that part of the serpent which it is\r\nsaid “never dies till the sun goes down.” The death-dealing rattle\r\nof the Ku Klux Klan is borne to us on the breath of the soft south\r\nwind; the lonely cane-brake still echoes the hunted fugitive’s cry;\r\nthe hand of palsy grasps our Southern sister States; and the nation\r\nis heart-sick, well nigh unto death. But the warm glow of another\r\nsunrise is upon us. A new day already dawns in the East, and the\r\ncoming man stands before the people, whom destiny has called to be\r\nthe leader, and to guide the ship of state into a peaceful sea. All\r\nhail! Benjamin F. Wade, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts spared him room to be born, but the great West\r\nnourished him upon her broad bosom, and there his mind drank in the\r\ngrand landscape of dimpled lake and sunny, dew-kissed prairie, and\r\nthere he learned, irrespective of color or sex, devotion to his race.\r\n\r\nA self-made man like our own lamented Lincoln, looking out upon the\r\nworld with the same kind, brown eyes; but there the comparison ends.\r\nMr. Wade is not tall, ungainly, or awkward. Rather above the medium\r\nheight, broad shouldered, he was apparently built for use instead of\r\nornament, like a printing-press or a steam engine. Handsome, for the\r\nreason that not a weak place in form or feature shows itself; comely,\r\nbecause every point is purely masculine, with no trace of the other\r\nsex, unless his mother’s soul looks out of his brown eyes--for it is\r\nwell known that Mr. Wade is one of the kindest men in Congress, also\r\nwoman’s best and truest friend. It is for this alone that we stand in\r\nhis presence with uncovered head. It was Senator Wade who brought the\r\nbill before Congress giving to woman in the District of Columbia the\r\nright to hold her own property and earnings in direct opposition to\r\nthe rights of a dissolute husband. It was his personal efforts in the\r\nbeginning that changed the laws of Ohio in woman’s favor; and, to use\r\nhis own language: “I did not do it because they are women but because\r\nit is right. The strong have no business to oppress the weak.”\r\n\r\nSitting in his presence the other day, we ventured to remark, “How\r\ndid it happen, Mr. Wade, that you signed the petition of Mrs. Frances\r\nLord Bond, recommending her for a consulate? Would you really advise\r\nthe country to give a woman such a position?”\r\n\r\nThe spirit of mirth danced over his face as he replied, “I would sign\r\nany petition that reads as that did. It said, ‘if she could perform\r\nthe services better than any one else?’ I had a doubt in my mind\r\nabout that; but if she could do the work better than any one else I\r\nwould not prevent her because she is a woman.”\r\n\r\nThere has been a time within the memory of us all when a shuddering\r\nchill has crept up to the vitals of the nation. Then a plain,\r\nstraightforward honest man was lifted above all others, far up to the\r\nhighest pinnacle of power. As God gave him light to see the right, he\r\nled us through the smoke of battle, over the burning desert of war,\r\nand when the green oasis of peace was in view, he fell by the bullet\r\nof the assassin. Is it Fate, is it God, who reaches forth his hand\r\nand again lifts another straight-forward, unpretending man to the\r\nhighest place in the gift of the American people? As a Senator, who\r\nhad a purer record? In every crisis, on every national question, who\r\nfor a moment doubted where Ben Wade would be found? Who ever caught\r\nhim balancing on the top of the fence, if the seeds of life or death\r\nwere to be sown broadcast over the land? Admitting that he has none\r\nof the polish of Chesterfield; that he sometimes nails his sentences\r\nwith words noted for strength rather than for elegance and beauty\r\n(or that might be left out altogether); that he may not possess all\r\nthe classical culture that some of his brother Senators may boast;\r\nyet, as a people sore and heavy laden, let us thank our Maker for\r\nBenjamin F. Wade--kind, noble, honest citizen, great, not in himself,\r\nfor men themselves are paltry, but great, just like a mathematical\r\nfigure which stands to represent the distance of the sun. He may be\r\nrubbed out, like the digit on the big blackboard, but the principles\r\nembodied in him are as enduring as the mountains of granite of his\r\nown native State.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO NOTABLE WOMEN.\r\n\r\nMRS. KATE CHASE SPRAGUE AND MRS. OAKES AMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 23, 1868_.\r\n\r\nLike a rolling avalanche, impeachment gathers in size and velocity\r\nas it rushes on to its final resting place. The testimony has all\r\nbeen taken; the arguments have already commenced. Manager Boutwell\r\noccupied many hours yesterday in reading his arguments. This able\r\neffort will soon find its way into every household in the land,\r\nthere to be weighed and judged discriminately; but Manager Boutwell\r\nis no wizard or brownie, and therefore cannot go himself where his\r\nwords will fly. How does he look, and what could he see if he should\r\ntake his eyes off the printed page and glance hither and yon, to the\r\nright, to the left, or, with both at once, make a grand Balaklava\r\ncharge? Is it possible for a man to get to that point in his life\r\nwhen the mind’s fruit hangs in clustered perfection, like the juicy\r\npurple grape of mid-autumn?\r\n\r\nManager Boutwell is in the zenith of life, rather under the medium\r\nsize and compact, and when tested gives the true ring of the genuine\r\ncoin, or a perfect piece of porcelain, handsome enough for all the\r\npractical uses of life, but nothing startling or electrical about\r\nhim, like Benjamin Butler; and it would seem as if wily Massachusetts\r\nwas wide awake, as she has furnished two managers. But in case\r\nGeneral Butler should exhaust himself like fiery Vesuvius, behold\r\nthere is Boutwell, cool, solemn, eternal as the glacier-crowned Alps.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell is a good speaker, but his reading seems wearisome, and\r\nyet the galleries listen with attention; at least it is very quiet in\r\nthere--not a breath of air to spare.\r\n\r\nThere is a faint odor of exquisite perfume exhaling from hundreds of\r\nsnowy, cob-web handkerchiefs; dainty women scattered here and there,\r\neverywhere. Paris has Eugenie; Washington has Mrs. Senator Sprague,\r\nthe acknowledged queen of fashion and good taste. She occupies a seat\r\nat the left of the reader. Her costume is just as perfect as the\r\nlily or the rose. She is a lilac blossom to-day. Not a particle of\r\njewelry is visible upon her person. She has copied her bonnet from\r\nthe pansy or wood violet. A single flower, of lilac tinge, large\r\nenough for the “new style,” rests upon her head, and is fastened to\r\nits place by lilac tulle so filmy that it must have been stolen from\r\nthe purple mists of the morning. An exquisite walking dress of pale\r\nlilac silk has trimmings a shade darker, whilst lilac gloves conceal\r\na hand that might belong to the queen of fairies. Is she a woman\r\nor a flower, to be nipped by the frost; to be pressed between the\r\nleaves of adversity; or, alas! to grow old and wither? Impossible!\r\nShe is a flower of immortality; not perfect, it is true, as other\r\nletter-writers say, but she happens to be placed in a sphere where\r\nperfection is expected, and she is mortal like the rest of us. She\r\nshrinks from the hard and lowly task of visiting the wretched hut,\r\nthe sick, and the afflicted. So do Victoria and Eugenie, whose fame\r\nis wafted to us across the great water.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the queen sits another woman distinguished in\r\nWashington society. It is the wife of a millionaire--Mrs. Oakes Ames\r\nof Massachusetts. She is a handsome matron, in the early autumn of\r\nlife. She has no desire to shine in the fashionable world, and her\r\nsmiling face would only come out the brighter after an eclipse of\r\nthat kind. Her elegant parlors are headquarters for old-fashioned\r\nhospitality, and to those who possess the “open sesame” she is\r\nalways at home. But it is in Massachusetts that she finds her true\r\nsphere. There she is the wife of the baronet, the “Lady Bountiful of\r\nthe neighborhood,” surrounded by her husband’s tenantry or working\r\npeople. It is the “squire’s wife” who visits the lowly cottage,\r\nbringing sunshine and temporal relief. It is the “squire” who pays\r\nthe clergyman his salary, that his people may be saved through no\r\nloss of spiritual grace, and instead of going to London for the\r\nwinter they come to Washington. What! Gossips, you say; but it is an\r\nadmitted fact.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE NELSON.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT’S COUNSEL DURING THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 27, 1868_.\r\n\r\nAnother effort of the immortal mind has been inscribed upon the\r\nscroll of fame. Judge Nelson, of Tennessee, has spoken in behalf of\r\nthe President, and only the pen of genius can do justice to this\r\ndewy, refreshing speech as it fell upon the American Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen it is known that Judge Nelson dropped the cowl of the monk for\r\nthe lawyer’s pointed lance, it is not astonishing that he mistook\r\nthe Senate for a set of Tennessee sinners, and appealed to its\r\nfeeling instead of its judgment. This most interesting speech was\r\ninterspersed with poetry, borrowed for the occasion, to be sure, but\r\nof equal use and effectiveness--nevertheless, like mourning garments,\r\nborrowed from friendly neighbors; and yet the speech was destitute\r\nof all solemnity. A rich vein of humor coursed through it, and the\r\nSenate seemed to enjoy the repose so much needed after the strong\r\narguments of Mr. Boutwell.\r\n\r\nIt is said Andrew Johnson chose Nelson for these very qualities; but,\r\ngratifying as it may have been to the President, it did not find\r\nfavor in the minds of those who are friendly to the lost cause. A\r\ngenuine sneer curled itself up and nestled in all the hide-and-seek\r\nplaces in the delicate face of William M. Evarts, while stately Mr.\r\nGroesbeck seemed severely offended. Members of Congress folded their\r\nunseen tents and silently stole away; the Chief Justice uncoiled his\r\ndignity just enough to catch a breath of the fluttering breeze; and\r\nthe high court of impeachment was relieved as if by an unexpected\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nJudge Nelson was a semi-rebel--a sort of Tennessee neutral--during\r\nthe rebellion, and it has not been ascertained whether it was for\r\nthis reason that Andrew Johnson chose him for the defence; but it is\r\nnow known beyond a doubt that minister and lawyer are so ingeniously\r\nmixed in the judge’s composition that a third compound is the result,\r\nbearing no more resemblance to the first ingredients than soap bears\r\nto oil and alkali.\r\n\r\nMr. Groesbeck had the floor next--apparently a good, strong\r\nman, bearing the same relation to the human family that a fair,\r\nrosy-cheeked apple does to the remainder of the fruit in the orchard.\r\nLike Mr. Stanbery, he pleads illness. His voice seemed in the\r\nlast stages of collapse. It is very difficult to catch the hoarse\r\nsentences in the galleries. There is nothing flashing, brilliant, or\r\nelectrical in his speech, and if there were, it would be entirely\r\nlost, unless it rose, cloud-like, into the galleries. Hard, cold,\r\nflinty argument must be hurled upon the impassive Senate. Mr.\r\nGroesbeck seems to be aware of this fact, as he contends against the\r\nodds.\r\n\r\nThe gallery wears its usual high-toned, fashionable elegance. A\r\nreal hothouse of rare human exotics is gathered together, partaking\r\nof the same weaknesses and desires that animate creation in the\r\nhumbler spheres of life. Some of these exquisite butterflies have\r\na way of spreading their voluminous crinoline to the exclusion of\r\nsome unfortunate in want of a seat; but as soon as an acquaintance\r\nmakes an appearance, in the twinkling of an eye space is evolved\r\nfrom a minus quantity and immediately occupied, and the real honest\r\npossessor has no redress except in repeating an ave, or declaiming\r\nmentally the touching poem of “sour grapes.”\r\n\r\nAllowing it to be exceedingly gratifying, it is not good taste to\r\nbe eating in public. History tells us that a great monarch used to\r\ntake his emetics and vomit gracefully in the presence of the court,\r\nbut even royalty could not add dignity to, nor throw a rosy glamor\r\nover, one of Nature’s disgraceful freaks. And in the high court\r\nof impeachment no pink-lipped, amber-haired beauty can afford to\r\ndistort her features and wantonly assail the ears of her neighbors\r\nby cracking nuts with her pearly teeth. If a woman has neither youth\r\nnor beauty, and commits the same fatal error, “Angels and ministers\r\nof grace defend us!”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAITHFUL SERVANT.\r\n\r\nA COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LIFE WORK OF HON. THADDEUS STEVENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 28, 1868_.\r\n\r\nAfter the storm and cloud of an eventful life, Thaddeus Stevens\r\nlingers on the disc of the Western horizon, surrounded by the glory\r\nof departing day. As he stands the central figure in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, he likewise occupies the same place at the manager’s\r\ntable in the high court of impeachment. Like Lord Brougham, his\r\nintellectual powers seem to lose little by age, and his argument in\r\nbehalf of the House has none superior, if any equal to it. Short,\r\ncompact, conclusive, it was made up of the cream of the whole matter\r\nin the dispute. On the day of its delivery, as the Chief Justice\r\nceased speaking, the galleries were hushed into more than attentive\r\nsilence. Slowly the venerable speaker advanced to a chair on the\r\nplatform so as to be able to face the Senate, his position being\r\nat the same time such that he could be plainly seen by the crowd\r\nin the vast galleries, who were listening, intent on catching the\r\nfaintest word. He seemed to be impressed with the solemnity of the\r\nsurroundings, also to realize that the present effort was to be the\r\nlast great crowning work of his life. Slowly he rose, trembling, yet\r\nbrilliant as the flame that sometimes shoots upward when the taper\r\nburns low in the socket before it expires. His reading, at first low\r\nand tremulous, grew stronger and stronger until it reached every\r\nnook of the vast Senate chamber. As he sat in his easy chair, the\r\nbeholder could not help but feel that Thaddeus Stevens lives to prove\r\nto the world the immortality of the soul. He shows that the body is\r\nnot necessary to human existence. He shows that passion can live\r\nnotwithstanding the fire of life is nearly out; and though every\r\nwindow of his mansion of clay is broken, and through each rent and\r\ncrevice the storm of the outer world pours in, yet, like a couchant\r\nlion in his den, his mind is ready to spring upon an adversary; and\r\nin any work that devolves upon the servants of the country, Thaddeus\r\nStevens is ready to accept the royal share.\r\n\r\nAs every season of the year has its beauties, so has every season\r\nof life. Though it be winter, it is only the poor who sigh for the\r\nsummer heats. He who is rich in intellect, though he stands upon\r\nthe snows of age, partakes of the holiest and most elevated joys.\r\nFar up the mountain the traveler has ascended. Human life, with its\r\ncontentions and struggles, is spread out before him in the valley\r\nbelow. He can look down upon his fellow-man kindly, lovingly, for he\r\nsees the thorn and the bramble, the hidden ditch and the concealed\r\nstone, over which his brother may stumble and sometimes falls. But\r\nas he climbs higher and still higher, the valley, with its smiling\r\nriver and fairy dells, fades imperceptibly, the twilight of the upper\r\nworld surrounds him, and he sees, both above and below, in letters\r\nof living fire, the single word JUSTICE; and happy is he who, like\r\nThaddeus Stevens, has made this solemn word his song by day, his\r\npillar of fire by night, for eternal justice is the living God.\r\n\r\nA great many years ago, a Green Mountain boy was fairly embarked on\r\nthe ocean of life. No gaily-painted merchantman was at his command;\r\nonly a little life-boat, whose paddles were a pair of strong hands;\r\nno supplies, only those so deftly hidden away in the cunning recesses\r\nof his brain. In the beginning he said it is not good to be alone;\r\nso he fashioned himself a banner, inscribed with the golden letters\r\nof Universal Justice, Liberty, and Education. With this flag upon\r\nhis bosom, singlehanded and alone, he fought the ignorant prejudices\r\nof the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This childless bachelor\r\nsaid the State should be taxed to educate the children. Was it light\r\nfrom the Infinite shining upon Mr. Stevens that enabled him to see\r\ndeeper into the welfare of these children than their own parents\r\nor guardians? He met the most powerful opposition, but proved\r\nhimself as invulnerable as Achilles without a heel. He conquered.\r\nThe commonschool system of Pennsylvania owes its being to Thaddeus\r\nStevens, and unborn myriads may owe their success in life to this\r\ngreat benefactor.\r\n\r\nThere was weeping and wailing heard through the centuries. The\r\nstifled sob of slave mothers smote the air because their babes were\r\nsold into bondage, and though they might be living on the earth yet\r\nwere dead to them forever. The slave-pen lifted its atrocious head\r\nand flaunted its pestilential shadows within the call of the nation’s\r\ncapital. The auctioneer’s voice rang shrill and clear, going! going!\r\ngone! whilst the American Shylock advanced and paid for his pound of\r\nhuman flesh. The torturing chain and lash were held in the hand of\r\nthe overseer, and with no hope, no refuge, for the fugitive but the\r\ndeadly morass or more desolate canebrake, there to be followed by the\r\nkeen-scented bloodhound or his still more relentless foe. The people\r\nof Israel lay prostrate with faces buried in the dust, forgotten by\r\nthe nations of the earth, apparently forgotten by their God. But the\r\nclouds of wrath gathered, and at last overspread the whole land.\r\nThe youthful Republic saw, for the first time, a serious civil war.\r\nAlthough tried on many a battlefield before, it was in the great war\r\nfor the downfall of oppression that Thaddeus Stevens sprang into\r\nexistence as the “leader of the House.” It was in the vast arena of\r\nCongress, that awful place, where even more than average men are\r\nlost in its immensity, that Thaddeus Stevens shone with a steady\r\nunfaltering light--a sun with a solar system around him. It was not\r\nalone the untiring efforts of great generals, or the spilling of\r\nblood or the wasting of treasure, that saved the life of the nation.\r\nHe who helps to keep the fountain of legislation pure, who keeps the\r\nmantle of trust reposed in him by the people clean and free from\r\nthe speck or blemish at all times, whether it be war or peace, is\r\na nation’s benefactor. Let the nation’s head be uncovered in the\r\npresence of Thaddeus Stevens.\r\n\r\nIt is the work of a biographer to follow a great man through a long\r\nand well spent life; and it is extremely unfortunate that Mr. Stevens\r\nhas never been known to make the acquaintance of a Boswell, for how\r\nmuch that is crisp and readable must now be lost. It may be pleasant\r\nto know that he has sold his lots in the two cemeteries of which he\r\nwas an owner because colored people were refused burial in them;\r\nthough it may be possible that he feels that he shall have future use\r\nfor them. It is so natural to forget to say that a noble character\r\nhas any faults. But who remembers the spots on the sun? It is enough\r\nto know that we owe life to its benign influence.\r\n\r\nLong, long, will Mr. Stevens remain photographed upon the minds\r\nof those who now have the honor to behold him, as he sits in his\r\neasy chair day after day. Nature did not make him handsome, but she\r\nfashioned him with a bold, rugged outline, suggesting power and\r\nsublimity, like the solemn mountain or the surf-beaten cliff.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN A. BINGHAM.\r\n\r\nACQUITS HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN FORENSIC CONFLICT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _May 7, 1868_.\r\n\r\nNever, even during the late days of storm and darkness, has the sun\r\nset upon such scenes as were enacted on the last day of argument\r\nbefore the High Court of Impeachment. No more can it be said that the\r\nage of oratory has fled, for John A. Bingham has shown that there\r\nis a man amongst us who possesses the rare power of electrifying\r\nthe multitude: of making one vast sea of humanity throb with\r\noverwhelming emotion. I might as well attempt to “paint the sunbeams”\r\nas to give a description of his glowing words. From history he drew\r\nthe parallel between James the Second and our recreant President.\r\nMirabeau’s immortal answer to the king’s usher, “Go tell your master\r\nthat bayonets have no power over the will of the people,” seemed\r\nas if uttered anew by the spirit of the great Frenchman. Never in\r\nthe history of the world has any man been called to plead before\r\nsuch a bar, and for such a cause. No court has existed like it in\r\nthe world’s annals, and no such criminal has been called to answer.\r\nOnly the attributes of conceded genius sustained Mr. Bingham, and\r\nmade him strong for the work assigned to him. He seemed to feel that\r\nthis trial was not simply a means for the punishment of one daring\r\noffender, but that it was to prove the strength and stability of\r\nrepublican institutions for all time--to prove that the strongest\r\nare as imbecile before the majesty of the law as the beggar of the\r\nhighway.\r\n\r\nUpon the floor of the American Senate the majestic scenes of history\r\nare again repeated. One man stands out from the multitude, pleading\r\nthe cause of myriads against the aggressive encroachment of a wicked\r\nruler. Every inch of available space in the vast chamber contains a\r\nhuman being, and the silence of the grave prevails. Little by little,\r\nblow after blow, as the sculptor chisels the marble, the orator is\r\nbuilding a monument--one which is to stand through the centuries,\r\nlong, long after lithe, supple John A. Bingham is only a handful of\r\ndust. No link is missing in the chain; no dead sentiment clings to\r\nhis ideas; his perfect sentences are steeped at once in logic and\r\npoetry. It is the handwriting on the wall in letters of living fire.\r\nThe orator closes. A momentary silence like that which precedes\r\nthe hurricane’s crash, and there arises from floor to ceiling such\r\nconfusion which even the vigorous blows of the Chief Justice’s gavel\r\nare inadequate to suppress. It was like the voice of the gallant sea\r\ncaptain commanding the elements to be still. Then Senator Grimes\r\ncomes to the rescue, and moves that the galleries be cleared. Senator\r\nCameron hopes that the galleries will not be cleared, and that\r\nallowance will be made for the extraordinary occasion. Mr. Fessenden\r\nand Mr. Reverdy Johnson call Mr. Cameron to order, whilst Mr.\r\nTrumbull moves that not only the galleries be cleared, but that all\r\ndisorderly persons be arrested. At the same time the British minister\r\nand others in the diplomatic inclosure are seen apparently contesting\r\ntheir rights with the doorkeepers, whilst a flutter appears in the\r\nreporter’s gallery similar to that noticed in a flock of blackbirds\r\nwhen a handful of shot has been remorselessly distributed amongst\r\nthem. From his throne, which was only a plain, cane-seated chair,\r\nManager Bingham surveys the tumult. He who has sown the whirlwind\r\nsmilingly surveys the storm. He is weary and exhausted, and his cheek\r\nhas the pallor of the grave, but he feels that the applause was for\r\nhim. The uproar continues. At last the inexorable fiat is understood.\r\nThe galleries must be cleared upon the instant. So a surging tide\r\nof humanity pours out of every open door. Little knots of people are\r\nscattered here and there the whole length of the long corridors, all\r\ntalking about the one absorbing theme. Grand tableaux of excited\r\nmen are grouped in the rotunda, even the stairs have caught stray\r\nwhisps of surplus, standing humanity, all madly intoxicated with the\r\nenthusiasm of the hour. The world never seems weary of Boswell’s talk\r\nabout Dr. Johnson; and with the same desire to please, let it be told\r\nthat Mr. Bingham was asked how he felt after the proudest triumph\r\nof his life. Using his own words: “I don’t know how I feel; I only\r\nknow I have spoken enough to make thirty columns in the Congressional\r\nGlobe. God knows I have tried to do my duty; it is in the hands of\r\nthe Senate now. The great work of my life is done.”\r\n\r\nDay after day we see our neighbor, John A. Bingham, an unpretending\r\nman of simple tastes, and whose mind is a storehouse of classic\r\nculture. About the average height of his fellow-men, he is far more\r\nslender and graceful, and though not handsome according to the\r\nprescribed rules of beauty, yet like the High Court of Impeachment,\r\nwhich is a law unto itself, he looks like John A. Bingham, and there\r\nis nothing better by which he can be compared, estimated, or measured.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSON BURLINGAME.\r\n\r\nHIS TRIUMPHANT CAPTURE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE FLOWERY KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _June 20, 1868_.\r\n\r\nA new and startling drama is performing on the world’s stage. The\r\nOccident and the Orient are at last united. The oldest nation on the\r\nface of the earth is shaking hands with the youngest. Gray-bearded\r\nChina, after being hermetically sealed during the long ages, opens\r\nher arms to embrace Young America, and in the height of her good\r\nhumor includes the rest of the world. Another laurel is added to\r\nthe fame of America. A countryman of ours has shown what genius\r\nand courage can accomplish in the great field of diplomacy. Anson\r\nBurlingame has smitten the strongholds of China as Moses smote the\r\nrock in the wilderness, and the sweet waters flow forth in Washington\r\nin the shape of dozens of pig-tailed, almond-eyed, silken-clad\r\nOrientals, who charm by their picturesqueness, and who leave the\r\ngates of wonder standing ajar every day. To the eye of an ordinary\r\n“barbarian” one Chinaman looks as much like another as two pins\r\nfrom the same paper; but a very close inspection shows that the two\r\nmandarins are made of a little finer clay than the “suite.” There\r\nis just about the same difference as between their own exquisite\r\nporcelain and the modern French china.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fashionable shoes of their mother, the mandarins have\r\ninherited feet made expressly for Cinderella’s slipper, whilst their\r\ndelicate taper fingers vie with any high-born damsel’s in the land.\r\nThey are exceedingly attractive, but the sentiment they inspire is as\r\nstrange as themselves. It isn’t the usual homage that woman gives\r\nthe opposite sex, and their fluttering silken skirts and fans help to\r\nkeep up all sorts of illusions. They have brought a miniature China\r\nwith them, in the shape of all that goes to sustain life--their own\r\nservants, cooking utensils, favorite beverages, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Hotel had been turned into a Chinese pagoda, and\r\nMinister Burlingame and his elegant wife are the presiding seers,\r\nwhilst the multitude flock to offer incense at their shrines. Not\r\nan hour can they call their own; and though they are very weary\r\nthis exhausting weather, Mr. Burlingame says, “I am so glad to meet\r\nwith so much kindness from my countrymen.” It is this warmth--these\r\ngenuine, electric flashes of the soul--that melts all opposition.\r\nSince the birth of our young Republic how many wise and good men have\r\nbeen sent to China; but we must acknowledge that we never sent the\r\nright man before. All honor to the young pioneer who reflects so much\r\ncredit upon American diplomacy. It is a plain citizen of our Republic\r\nwho introduces the oldest monarchy to the whole civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question, “How did you bring it about?” “Bring it\r\nabout?” said he. “I studied Chinese character. I made them feel\r\nthat we meant them no harm. It has been the habit in times past,\r\nif any demand or request was made by foreign powers to the Chinese\r\nGovernment and the request was not favorably received, to dispatch\r\na gunboat to make a warm impression. This never was my course of\r\naction. I never resorted to force. I labored to make them feel that\r\nmy propositions were for our mutual good; and,” he continued, “I\r\nmust not forget to say how much influence women have in China; for\r\nif the two most influential women in the Empire had not favored the\r\nexpedition we should not have been seen in this part of the world. Of\r\nthese august ladies one was the Empress’ mother; the other the wife\r\nof the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burlingame did not say whether he met these ladies face to\r\nface; but, if he did, the birth of the Chinese embassy is no longer\r\na wonder, for even Queen Elizabeth, one of the greatest sovereigns\r\nthat ever lived, was never proof against those subtle, insinuating\r\ninfluences far easier felt than described.\r\n\r\nMr. Burlingame was cast in one of nature’s finest moulds. Towering\r\njust enough above the medium height to be called commanding, with\r\nproportions as symmetrical as a perfect tree in the forest, a face is\r\nadded that is strikingly classic, which attracts the eye for a moment\r\nonly, giving way to the spiritual impression.\r\n\r\nWhilst this Chinese panorama was unfolding, a graceful woman for a\r\nmoment was pictured on the canvas--Mrs. Burlingame, the only woman\r\nwho accompanies the party. There was a gleam of a pair of dark,\r\nlustrous eyes; a shadow cast by the heavy coils of black, wavy hair;\r\nsomething blue and filmy as Oriental gauze enveloped her fine figure;\r\na side door opened, and the vision was gone.\r\n\r\nStriking points of similarity exist between the old monarchy and\r\nthe young Republic. China is divided into provinces as our country\r\nis divided into States. Education is within reach of all. From the\r\nhumblest beginning merit can rise and divide the honors with the\r\nimperial blood. An inexorable fiat envelops China as with a network\r\nof bristling steel. It is the supreme law of the land. There is\r\nno appeal from its decree. It holds the highest and the lowest in\r\nits vise-like grasp. Like death, it respects no private claim. The\r\nEmperor is as impotent before it as the Chinaman who has not the\r\nwherewith to provide a dinner. This is the one great principle, the\r\nall-powerful cohesive force which has kept this vast Empire together\r\nfrom time immemorial. Let America try to forget the past, and in this\r\nrespect walk in the footsteps of the imperial China.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALENTED QUARTETTE.\r\n\r\nMADAME LE VERT, GAIL HAMILTON, VINNIE REAM, AND MRS. LANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January, 1869_.\r\n\r\nA reception at the governor’s mansion occupies that middle ground\r\nwhich may be supposed to be between a President’s levee and the\r\nprivate party given by a well-to-do Congressman. The governor\r\nmust invite everybody because he is everybody’s servant, like the\r\nPresident, only he has no White House and paid retinue of lackeys, no\r\nfuel and gas found, and no fifty thousand per year. On the contrary\r\n“he must find himself,” and this he will be obliged to do whenever\r\nthe enormous bills are paid. If one could have seen the crowds that\r\nfor four mortal hours filled the governor’s large dining-hall they\r\nwould have prayed for a repetition of the same miracle that took\r\nplace some eighteen hundred years ago, when the bread and fish could\r\nnot give out, and water was spoiled by being turned into wine.\r\n\r\nBut the worst comes. We have got a governor--none of your\r\nmilk-and-water kind--and who looks every inch a governor, as much\r\nas the great Napoleon looked like an emperor. We have so many\r\n“figure-heads,” which are the result of the appointing power, that\r\nwhen the real article turns up let us thank President Grant for his\r\nact, for it makes no difference to us whether he does the right thing\r\nby design or mistake. But the governor’s ball. Everybody was there.\r\nThe governor stood at the entrance of the broad door that led to the\r\nright of the hall, arrayed with the usual ministerial black-looking\r\nrobe, and acting only as a governor should. By his side stood my\r\nlady, tall, elegantly dressed in charming simplicity. She is still\r\nvery youthful to be called to occupy so prominent a place. Her dress\r\nwas simple white muslin with an overdress of black velvet, white\r\nruche at the throat with tiniest of rosebuds in the pleatings; no\r\njewels, no gewgaws. She must have taken Madame Thiers, the wife of\r\nthe early President of the French Republic, for her model, or, later\r\nstill, Madame MacMahon, not only the first lady but one of the most\r\nsensible women in France.\r\n\r\nThe governor’s mansion is admirably arranged for entertaining\r\nlarge companies. The rooms seemed to be fastened to the arc of a\r\ncircle. The guests entered the broad folding doors, followed on\r\nfrom room to room, and came out near the point where they started;\r\na turning wheel of glaring colors, a huge human kaleidoscope--what\r\nbetter comparison? We will suppose you are behind the governor, as\r\nMephistopheles is said to have stood behind Faust. But then you are\r\nonly a harmless correspondent, and the image is in the very worst\r\ntaste; and yet, even in newspaper comparisons, it is well to keep\r\nall the best things for one’s self. You are behind the shadow of the\r\ngovernor--invisible, you see nothing, but you feel a great deal. A\r\nturn of the wonderful kaleidoscope and there comes to view the great\r\nwarrior Tecumseh, sometimes called General Sherman, the Beau Brummel\r\nof fashionable life in Washington. Straight as one of those guns he\r\ncarried so successfully to the sea, and just about as useful at the\r\npresent day, yet very dear to us, because he is the best paid for\r\nthe least work of any man in the Union. And yet he was seen at the\r\nBurns Festival, as well as many other places, with Vinnie Ream on\r\nhis arm, and who knows what the veteran warrior may have suffered?\r\nVinnie is not large, neither is a Minie ball, and yet if either one\r\nshould hit the mark the most direful consequences might follow. When\r\nwe compare Vinnie Ream to the great men who work in stone she grows\r\nbeautifully less, but when we compare her with women she rises almost\r\nbeyond feminine proportions. She is a very small man, but a very\r\ngreat woman. Go ahead, Vinnie! Bust Tecumseh, or somebody else will!\r\nOur great men must be busted by some one, and women ought to have a\r\nhand in that kind of work. We intend to write a book about the famous\r\nwomen of Washington, and you, dear, persecuted, self-sacrificing\r\nlittle sprite, shall have almost the best place.\r\n\r\nAnother turn of the wheel. Who comes there? It is our tall, lordly\r\nspeaker of the House--our handsome would-be next President--polished\r\nas steel, and Colfaxian to the last degree, except the smile. But\r\nhe is our Speaker of the House, and, as Don Quixote said about his\r\nown Dulcinea, we challenge the world in his defence, and if an enemy\r\nchooses to break a lance they can do so at their own risk.\r\n\r\nHere comes Mrs. Blaine, frozen as a New England landscape in\r\nmidwinter. The salt mist of the gray sea! Ugh! ugh! Turn the\r\nkaleidoscope quick. The air is so cold the artificial flowers are\r\nnipped by the frost.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the sunny, laughing Gail Hamilton. Her warm face and\r\nyellowish hair would melt an iceberg. Even her dress is the color of\r\nsunbeams. Why is she not sent to open the Northwest passage? It is\r\ntrue Franklin, Kane, and Hall have failed, but that is because they\r\ndid not take along enough fire. And yet we could not spare Gail, for\r\nwhat single woman would be left to teach married ones how to manage\r\ntheir husbands? Who would teach us how to bring up our children in a\r\nbazaar-like way? It is true Gail Hamilton is not a mother, but this\r\nmay be her misfortune, besides she may not be old enough to assume\r\nsuch enormous responsibilities in a small way.\r\n\r\nA galaxy of stars blaze in the neighborhood of Gail Hamilton. The\r\nwoman in black with such elegant lace is Mrs. Lander, of histrionic\r\nfame. Queen Elizabeth on the stage! Queen Elizabeth in private life!\r\nThis is her court--dukes, lords, princes of republican blood. A wave\r\nof the jeweled hand and they are gone.\r\n\r\nA ship full-rigged, with a fair wind, in the offing. It is great\r\nand good Mrs. Ann S. Stevens, Philadelphia’s fair jewel; long may\r\nshe blaze. What a faultless costume! Quaker color, and such glorious\r\nlace. By her side stands her slender, amber-haired daughter, clad in\r\nwhite satin and tarletan, with pearls at her snowy throat and thin\r\nears; “blooded,” you may be sure of that.\r\n\r\nWho next? Octavia Le Vert, only child of Madame Le Vert--scarlet\r\nsatin gown, great, black Oriental eyes, exotic of the South.\r\nShe makes you think of a magnolia blossom, even the perfume in\r\nimagination stifles you. This is Madame Le Vert, sweet, loving,\r\ntrustful woman--hurt her? Not much, if you only knew how to avoid\r\nit. She steals your heart out of your bosom, you cannot tell how;\r\nyou only feel that you have missed something, you search for it and\r\nit is gone. Oh! these Southern women, so savage in war, so loving,\r\nso winning in peace. Our John used to say “you can’t trust ’em.” But\r\nwho wants to trust ’em. We never expect to marry a woman if life and\r\ndeath were staked on the result.\r\n\r\nAnother turn of the human kaleidoscope, lo! here is Congressman\r\nHarmer, of Philadelphia, with his handsome wife. What a superbly\r\nmatched pair. Quicker than electric flash the mind goes back to Eden,\r\nto the first Adam and the first Eve, and you are comforted with the\r\nproof that creation goes on in pretty much the same faultless way,\r\nmaking pairs, each half for the other. It is true there is often a\r\nmissing link, but that makes the union all the more beautiful by\r\ncomparison of the broken parts tossed helplessly on a sea of trouble.\r\nBut Mrs. Harmer, her dress must have been faultless, for alas,\r\nnothing is remembered but her fine figure and handsome face.\r\n\r\nGeneral and Mrs. Albright were there. Pennsylvania at large had to\r\nbe represented, and who could do this so well as this kind-hearted,\r\nable, and accomplished woman, with her husband to do all the heavy\r\nwork. She reminds one of a piece of sterling gold. In the course of\r\nyears she will lose no appreciable weight. How about increasing in\r\nvalue? She will increase just like this precious metal, for suppose\r\nwe drain the country for exports, and water the currency, and the\r\nbottom of the mines fall out? This is a fruitful subject, but no time\r\nto do it justice.\r\n\r\nBut there was a woman there whose gorgeous outfit reminded one of\r\nthe tales in the Arabian Nights. Her jewels were of the rarest and\r\nmost costly kind. With the exception of a necklace worn by a Peruvian\r\nbeauty, and the Russian gems which used to adorn Madame Bodisco,\r\nnothing has been seen lately at the capital so dazzling. A pendant\r\npearl, which hung from the centre of the enchanted string around her\r\nneck, was as large as the egg of a humming-bird. Oh, the diamonds,\r\nthe emeralds, and all the other precious stones! There was a mass of\r\nsilk, feathers, and lace, and no doubt a woman swaddled somewhere,\r\nbut she could not be seen for the imprisoned glory of those shining\r\nstones. She went away before 12 o’clock, else no doubt her godmother\r\nwould have turned her fine horses into mice. Who was she? Listen,\r\nnow; hold your breath! if we must tell--the wife of the correspondent\r\nof the New York _Herald_!\r\n\r\n“Who is that man, did you say?” This is he whom the cruel Don Piatt\r\nhas dubbed the “Mighty Mullet,” and yet the facetious Don may be\r\ntelling more truth than he intends, for, like the noiseless coral, he\r\nis at work rearing his strongholds all over the land. Think how many\r\nglorious tombstones he will have, pyramids that will last hundreds\r\nof years. He is our Ptolemy. Who dares dispute it? When asked his\r\nopinion of a celebrated beauty he replied: “If she only had a\r\nsouthern exposure and that attic story was removed and a French roof\r\nput in its place, she would be all right.” Architecturally speaking,\r\nI mean. A man never should have but one idea, if it is the right one,\r\nand a great architect should have nothing but a house in his head.\r\n\r\nBut the saddest part was when this great performance was drawing\r\nto a close. The writer, in company with Colonel Magruder, went down\r\nto the subterranean regions below. Such a sight met the eye of the\r\nspectator. Colonel Magruder said that nothing had ever been done in\r\ncomparison to it by the board of public works. “It is a matter of\r\nmoney. I can tell you that,” said he, “and no appropriation.” The\r\ntables still groaned under the fragments of the enormous feast. But\r\nthe caterers and waiters were in a fainting condition. For hours\r\nthey had gallantly stood at the plates, and still the coming of morn\r\nwould insure safety to the enemy advanced, and it was feared that\r\nonly besieged. The first three hours exhausted the vast stores of\r\nboth Wormley and Welcker. Willard sent word that no provisions could\r\nbe spared on account of the hop the same evening. Cake acknowledged\r\nthat he was probably safe, because the crowd had been at Belknap’s\r\nand the governor’s first, but as good luck would have it, there was\r\nabundance for all, but, not satisfied with the feast, some of the\r\nvandals in the shape of men destroyed the beautiful ornaments of\r\npyramids and other elegant et ceteras made for the eye alone, in\r\norder to carry off some good-for-nothing trophy. One would think such\r\nmanners must be found in some hungry contractor. But, no; let us beg\r\nthe workingman’s pardon. It is the same set of cormorants who manage\r\nto get into good society. The same men who disgraced themselves\r\nat Admiral Porter’s and at the costly entertainments given by the\r\nJapanese to the distinguished Americans at our capital. No one should\r\nbe allowed to enter the governor’s mansion or a Cabinet Minister’s\r\nwithout his card of invitation. This is the only way to exclude these\r\nwell-dressed harpies. And yet all this spoliation goes on for the\r\nwomen. “Angels and ministers of grace defend us!” This must be borne,\r\nhowever, because “women are the connecting link between men and the\r\nangels.” The governor’s ball--the story is not half told.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRAGONS OF THE LOBBY.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. GOULD, HUNTINGDON, AND DILLON AND THEIR COHORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February, 1869_.\r\n\r\nWinding in and out through the long, devious basement passage,\r\ncrawling through the corridors, trailing its slimy length from\r\ngallery to committee room, at last it lies stretched at full length\r\non the floor of Congress--this dazzling reptile, this huge, scaly\r\nserpent of the lobby. It is true, Senator Thurman is on hand fully\r\nequipped with his judicial arrows; but what is Thurman--dear old\r\nThurman--in the face of such a statesman. Philadelphia’s charming\r\ndaughter--fair, fat and forty--embraces him with eyes whose seductive\r\npowers have only been intensified by the years. A luscious, mellow\r\nbanana; a juicy, melting peach; a golden pippin, ripened to the\r\nvery core. From India’s coral strand comes the two thousand dollar\r\ncashmere wrap that snuggles close to her fair shoulders. Diamonds,\r\nbrilliant as the stars in Orion’s jewelled belt, adorn her dainty\r\nears, whilst silk, satin, velvet, feathers, and laces prove what a\r\nrailroad can do when its funds are applied in the proper direction.\r\n\r\nTo-day a remarkable set of men are engaged in digging, burrowing,\r\nand blowing up senatorial rock--men whose faces seem carved out of\r\nthe very granite that kissed of the Mayflower many years ago. Is it\r\npossible that all the iron endurance and savage aggressiveness so\r\nnecessary to make indomitable character has been entirely absorbed by\r\nthe railroad kings?\r\n\r\nIn the Senate wing, in a room so perfect in its appointments that\r\nit might be taken for a jewel casket, may be seen Jay Gould, the\r\nNapoleon of the hour. A small picture, but a great deal of time\r\nspent on the work. How elaborately and how exquisitely finished.\r\nAbout the height of the Little Corporal, but more delicate and\r\nslender. A rare head, well rounded, with ears such as all blooded\r\nanimals possess. Pallid in complexion, like every other mortal whose\r\nblood is pumped up into the brain to keep the huge mental fires\r\nblazing. Eyes radiant and piercing and hair tinted like the locks of\r\nthe Prince of Darkness. If Samson’s strength lay in his curls, Jay\r\nGould’s must be found in his nose, for it is a feature that betrays\r\nthe whole character of the man. As there is but one Jay Gould on the\r\nface of the earth, there is but this solitary nose, which is neither\r\nGrecian, Roman, aquiline nor pug, but a nose abundantly able to poke\r\ninto every earthly matter and manage to come out victorious in the\r\nend. His mouth is another extremely attractive feature--the kind,\r\nhowever, that is not given to talk. It is more useful as a dainty\r\nreceptacle for terrapin and champagne, though it may be considered a\r\nchasm of another dangerous kind, from which women are warned for all\r\ntime to keep modestly away.\r\n\r\nFor many months Jay Gould has kept one of the most beautiful women\r\nin Washington busily employed on the Congressmen, and, astonishing\r\nto relate, the Senators seem rather to enjoy it than otherwise.\r\nBefore Senator Ben Hill made his late exhaustive railroad speech--in\r\nfact, just before he arose on the Senate floor--a woman, the most\r\nnotorious of the lobby, had his ear. A Northern Senator may listen to\r\nthe “queen,” but it takes the courage of the sunny South, the rare\r\nchivalry for which that clime is noted, to permit the contact in the\r\nbroad, open light of the day, with the eye of the press of the whole\r\ncountry upon him.\r\n\r\nFloating in Congressional waters, but unlike his awful prototype\r\nwhich is securely fastened to the bottom of the sea, at all hours of\r\nthe legislative day may be seen the burly form of Huntington, the\r\ngreat, huge devil-fish of the railroad combination, bearing not the\r\nslightest resemblance to his elegant associates, so far as grace of\r\nmanner or personal appearance is concerned. Cast in the same colossal\r\nmould as William M. Tweed, with all the grossness exaggerated and\r\nall the majesty left out, he ploughs the Congressional main, a shark\r\nin voracity for plunder, a devil-fish in tenacity of grip; for once\r\ncaught in the toils of the monster for the helpless victim there is\r\nno escape. At the beginning of every session this representative of\r\nthe great Central Pacific comes to Washington as certain as a member\r\nof either branch of Congress; secures his parlors at Willard’s, which\r\nsoon swarm with his recruits, both male and female, until scattered\r\nin the proper direction by order of the commander-in-chief. What a\r\nmotley collection of camp followers. To the naked eye are visible\r\nex-senators and ex-members, discharged Capitol employees who are\r\nthoroughly informed as to the “ropes,” whose business it is to warn\r\nthose who have the privilege of the floor the auspicious moment\r\nfor a successful raid. Every weakness of a Congressman is noted,\r\nwhilst the wily Huntington decides whether the attack shall be\r\nmade with weapon of the male or female kind. Tall and broad, both\r\nround and square, a quivering mass of concentrated sensuality, bold\r\nenough to appear in public with the scarlet woman on his arm, a\r\nheroism which daunts the courage of the vilest of his own sex, not\r\ncontent with his already princely gains he now seeks, like the late\r\nJim Fisk, to lay a whole continent under his avaricious tribute.\r\nSaid a member of Congress: “He can draw his check for hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars; everything which is in the market he can buy.”\r\nDuring his life the time is too short for the people to learn how\r\nto checkmate him. He is to this age what Alexander, Hannibal, and\r\nthe great Napoleon were to the past. He governs, but not with cold\r\niron or steel; he uses keener and more subtle weapons. Instead of\r\nthe bullet which cleared the way in a former age, man’s honor is the\r\npoint which receives the poisoned poniard. What will be the fate of\r\nthe Republic when all national legislation is permitted to become\r\ndefiled? Within the memory of middle-aged men foreign ministers were\r\nnot allowed the privilege of the floor. These sacred aisles have now\r\nbecome headquarters for the kings of lobby, who are as much at home\r\nthere as the Senators of the widest fame.\r\n\r\nThis is Sidney Dillon, president of the Union Pacific, and one\r\nof the most superb creations to be found within the marble walls\r\nof Congress. What a princely presence and distinguished bearing,\r\ntowering far above the average of his sex in height, with features\r\nas classic and clear cut as a cameo gem. In action, the embodiment\r\nof an Achilles, and in repose as graceful as the statue of the Greek\r\nslave. Can it be possible there is warm, red fluid in his veins, or\r\na fountain of human kindness in his breast? As he stands mentally\r\nplaying with a Senator, he might easily be mistaken for something\r\nmore than human, yet neither horns nor tail are visible. What power\r\nhas he which the Congressmen appear to have not? Step a little\r\ncloser. No sound is heard issuing from his finely chiseled lips. He\r\nis speaking, but there is no expression at play with the classic\r\nfeatures. Solemn, icy, apparently immutable, he only needs the Hebrew\r\ncast of countenance to become the living personification of the\r\nWandering Jew. Unlike Jay Gould and Huntington, his work is seldom\r\ntrusted to women. Though one should approach him as fascinating as\r\nthe serpent of the Nile, as lovely as Venus, or as perfect as Hebe,\r\nthe Union Pacific would lean back on its everlasting snow-sheds\r\nand defy the powers of darkness and Mother Eve combined. Taken\r\nseparately, or all together, no such trio of men have ever appeared\r\non the Congressional floor at the capital and no such corporation has\r\never been known to exist in the whole civilized world.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT GRANT’S INAUGURAL.\r\n\r\nENTERING UPON THE DUTIES OF THE EXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 5, 1869_.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March the goddess of day arose with bedraggled garments\r\nand watery eyes; but as the sun advanced to her meridian the clouds\r\ntrembled and dissolved in mid air, and the atmosphere grew balmy as\r\nan infant’s breath, and at high noon all nature seemed decked in\r\nholiday mood to crown the eighteenth President of the United States.\r\n\r\nA magic card was the “open sesame” to the Capitol, and once inside,\r\nthe beholder was dazzled with a picture as gorgeous as anything ever\r\nbeheld in the far-famed halls of the Montezumas. Here were seen\r\nthe great, strong arms of the Government, as represented by both\r\nbranches of Congress, the Army and the Navy, and the Supreme Court.\r\nThe foreign ministers in their gay court dresses, bespangled with\r\ndecorations and shimmering with gold lace, gave the last finishing\r\ntouch of brilliancy to the scene upon the floor. The diplomatic\r\ngallery was filled with ladies through whose veins coursed the bluest\r\nblood of Europe, though in personal attractions they were equalled\r\nand in some cases totally eclipsed by the grace and beauty of the\r\nAmerican queens around them. Never has the Senate been filled with\r\na more aristocratic assembly, and yet an occasional pretty Treasury\r\ngirl’s face peeped out, proving some great man’s exquisite taste, as\r\nwell as that exclusiveness was not carried so far as to add the last\r\nfeather to the camel’s back.\r\n\r\nOne of the front seats had been reserved for the use of Mrs.\r\nGrant and the friends who might be with her, but she did not take\r\npossession of it, and it remained unoccupied during the entire\r\nceremonies. The seat retained for Mrs. Colfax and her friends was\r\nfilled by that lady and her relatives, while every available square\r\ninch of the room in the vast gallery reflected some root, branch,\r\nor favorite of the men in power to-day who represent the leading\r\nDepartments of the Government.\r\n\r\nAt precisely the hour of noon the buzz of whispered conversation\r\nwas hushed, and in came the “coming man,” the cynosure of all eyes,\r\nUlysses S. Grant, who was about to receive a new honor--the highest,\r\nthe holiest, within the gift of a sovereign people. He was plainly\r\nattired in citizen’s dress, nothing noticeable but his yellow gloves.\r\nMany of the audience would have said: “He seems as modest, diffident,\r\nand shy as ever.” Others would have seen a man of power, reticent,\r\nself-possessed, and as far removed from his near surroundings as the\r\nfirst Napoleon upon the eve of battle. He took his seat in front\r\nof the Vice-President’s desk, where he sat as immovable as though\r\nencased in armor, while the President pro tempore administered the\r\noath of office to Schuyler Colfax, and pronounced a requiem by simply\r\nsaying, “the Fortieth Congress is no more.” In clear, distinct tones\r\nMr. Colfax took the oath of office, and immediately entered upon his\r\nduties as Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the east front of the Capitol a different scene was enacting.\r\nAt a proper distance from the platform stood the rank and file of\r\nthe people, white, black, and intervening all shades, promiscuously\r\nmixed, a fair representation of the genuine glory of the Republic.\r\nFor long, long hours the multitude had stood upon the cold, wet\r\nearth, waiting for a passing glimpse of the last closing scene;\r\nbut their weary eyes were not to be feasted with dainty gold-laced\r\nforeign ministers and the great dignitaries of the land. It is true\r\nthe Senate chamber could not hold the masses, but the national\r\nsquare contains room enough for all, and is it not time these old\r\nrelics of another age were packed in the dust, like so many small\r\nclothes outgrown by the country? It is the royal people who are the\r\nsovereigns, and who has the right at any time to push them from their\r\nown marble temples with glittering bayonets? Soldiers are machinery\r\nto be used in time of war, and not engines of power in days of peace\r\nto thrust the cold steel into the breasts of loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nNo accident marred the festivities of the day. The long procession in\r\nits picturesqueness more than surpassed the public expectation. The\r\nsoldiers were there, clean and trusty as their own polished weapons,\r\nand among them might have been seen the “black boys in blue.” The\r\ngallant firemen were out in gala dress, their engines gaudily decked\r\nin holiday attire, and all the different organizations in and out of\r\nthe city seemed to vie with each other which should lend the most\r\nglory to the passing hour.\r\n\r\nJust as the choicest viands are served for dessert, it was meant that\r\nthe inaugural reception should eclipse all its predecessors as well\r\nas shine by itself after the manner of the mighty Kohinoor in the\r\ncrown jewels of England. The place selected for this festival seemed\r\nmost appropriate.\r\n\r\nIn the structure known as the Treasury building were gathered\r\nthousands of both sexes and the brilliant scene carried the spectator\r\nback to the middle ages. It was like some haughty chief in his feudal\r\ncastle, summoning together the proud nobility of the land. Nowhere\r\ncould be seen the simplicity of a republic. Only the crowns were\r\nwanting; everything else was there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant stood by the side of the new President in faultless dress\r\nof white satin and point lace, with pearl and diamond ornaments, and\r\njust beyond her stood the Vice-President and Mrs. Colfax, unassuming\r\nas a violet, in pink satin and illusion. Her ornaments were also\r\npearls.\r\n\r\nThe various committees had endeavored to make preparations for every\r\nemergency except the most important one; they had made no calculation\r\nfor numbers. When it was too late to remedy the error, the members\r\nof the committee discovered they had sold too many tickets; but\r\nthis must have leaked out beforehand, for very few leading men\r\nwere accompanied by their wives. In many cases they were seen with\r\ndaughters or other young people clinging to their arms, whose youth\r\nwould seem a shield against the fearful annoyance of the crowd.\r\nToward midnight the jam culminated. The interesting spectacle might\r\nhave been seen of two thousand people trying to get through a single\r\ndoor at the same instant into the supper room. It was the camel\r\nattempting once more to go through the needle’s eye. A short time\r\nafter this, there was a grand division of the guests, composed of two\r\nparties--those who had fared sumptuously and those who had been used\r\nlike Mother Hubbard’s darling:\r\n\r\n      “And when she got there the cupboard was bare,\r\n        And so the poor dog got none.”\r\n\r\nThree to one could sing the old faithful nursery song. A supper had\r\nbeen set aside in another part of the building for the President,\r\nVice-President and their friends, and rumor said that it was a most\r\nsuperb affair; but this only aggravated the famished ones who had\r\npaid their money for the substance and when about to grasp it had\r\ncaught only an empty bubble with “Inaugural Ball” stamped on the\r\nrainbow-tinted, soapy, globular nothing.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of the inaugural reception baffles description. The\r\ntearing up of the icebergs in the Arctic seas of a spring morning\r\nmight seem more solemn, but alas! alas! not half so enthusiastic and\r\ninteresting. The hats and coats of the gentlemen had been numbered,\r\nand then all thrown pell-mell together. As a matter of course when\r\na check was presented, the hunt commenced. For hours men waited, and\r\nthen were obliged to go home without hats or coats. In the meantime,\r\nthe ladies, weary of waiting, sunk down in graceful attitudes on\r\nthe carpeted floor, or else called their carriages and took their\r\ndeparture alone, leaving their escorts to follow as soon as the\r\nhat-and-coat trouble found solution.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun arose on the 5th of March, his rays gilded eight hundred\r\nfrantic men, who still stood doggedly at their posts, calling in vain\r\nfor their hats and coats; but as this letter has nothing to do with\r\nanything but the 4th of March, the kaleidoscope is finished with the\r\ndawn of a new day.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JOHNSON’S FAMILY.\r\n\r\nTRAITS OF THE FEMALE AND YOUNGER MEMBERS THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 9, 1869_.\r\n\r\nThe family of Mr. Andrew Johnson was the least ostentatious of any\r\nthat has yet inhabited the White House, and its members preserved at\r\nthe capital the simple manners of their former State. The retirement\r\nand quiet of their life was so great that many are curious to know\r\nof them, and a few words of description may be interesting to your\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nDuring her occupancy of the Executive Mansion Mrs. Johnson has\r\nlived almost as secluded as a nun. This has been in part owing to a\r\nbronchial difficulty and a consumptive tendency, with which she was\r\nfirst afflicted at the beginning of the rebellion. This physical\r\ntrouble was subsequently aggravated by the loss of her eldest and\r\nfavorite son, who was thrown from his horse and instantly killed,\r\nat the beginning of the war, whilst on his round of duty as surgeon\r\nof the First Regiment Tennessee Infantry. Very few American women\r\nhave suffered more than Mrs. Johnson in behalf of the Union. She has\r\nknown what it was to fill with her own hands the basket of bread and\r\nmeat that was to be stealthily conveyed to a hiding place in the\r\nmountains, to keep from starvation her daughter’s husband. It was\r\na chastened spirit she brought to the White House, and though her\r\npresence was seldom denied to personal friends, with the glitter and\r\npomp of state she had nothing to do.\r\n\r\nMrs. Andrew Johnson, whose maiden name was Eliza McCardel, was born\r\nin 1811, and will be fifty-eight years of age her next birthday.\r\nShe is two years younger than her husband, and not older, as the\r\nnewspapers are in the habit of telling the story. She was married\r\nin Greeneville, Tenn., when she was in the 18th year of her age.\r\nHer young husband at the time was not 20. The honeymoon was spent\r\nin teaching the future President the rudiments of education. Mrs.\r\nJohnson says she “taught him the letters, but he was an apt scholar,\r\nand acquired all the rest himself.” With the exception of a few\r\nmonths in the early part of Mrs. Johnson’s married life, her home\r\nhas always been in Greeneville, Tenn. It was here her five children\r\nwere born, three sons and two daughters, of whom Mrs. Patterson is\r\nthe eldest. This daughter’s name is Martha, and she was married to\r\nJudge Patterson in December, 1855. Soon after their marriage, Mr.\r\nPatterson--who was practicing law at the time--was appointed judge\r\nof the first judicial district of East Tennessee. During most of the\r\ntime of President Johnson’s administration he has occupied a seat in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnson’s second daughter (Mary) married Mr. Stover, in April,\r\n1852. Colonel Stover was one of the most gallant of those officers\r\nwho laid down their lives in the defence of the Union. Though he\r\nhad not the soldier’s honor to perish on the battlefield, his\r\nslow, painful death was in his country’s cause. Colonel Stover was\r\none of the leaders who headed the Union men of East Tennessee. He\r\nwas one of the first to enroll himself among the number who as an\r\norganization were known as the “Bridge-burners.” His patriotic course\r\nattracted the attention of the rebels at once, and without a moment’s\r\npreparation he was driven to the mountains of East Tennessee. During\r\nthe inclement months of November and December, 1861, and January,\r\n1862, he was a hunted fugitive, hiding in the holes and caverns of\r\nthe rocks. It was during this awful winter that Mrs. Johnson filled\r\nthe basket with meat and bread, when her daughter, the sorrowful\r\nwife, was so smitten with anguish that she had not the strength to\r\nperform the task. Every man who tapped at the door of the lonely\r\nfarmhouse was supposed to be coming to bring the news that the son\r\nand husband was hanging to a forest tree. Some of their neighbors\r\nhad been afflicted in this way, and this dread was the penalty paid\r\nfor Unionism in East Tennessee. During this fearful period, in which\r\nColonel Stover suffered from cold and starvation, the seeds of\r\nconsumption were planted in his constitution. At last, through the\r\nefforts of some old personal friends who were strong rebels, he was\r\nallowed to go home; but he brought with him a sharp, rasping cough.\r\nSoon after he was allowed to pass through the rebel lines, in company\r\nwith his family and Mrs. Johnson. He proceeded at once to Kentucky,\r\nwhere he raised a regiment which was afterwards known as the Fourth\r\nTennessee Infantry. No braver regiment served during the war, and\r\nbut very few did the country more effective service; but before this\r\ngallant band had time to distinguish itself in any great battle its\r\nbrave, energetic colonel had passed away at the early age of 35.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the rebellion Colonel Stover was living the\r\nindependent life of a farmer in affluent circumstances. His large\r\nfarm was well stocked with cattle, and his barns were filled. His\r\nhouse soon became known as a kind of resting and breathing place for\r\nthe fleeing Union fugitives. After the departure of the family the\r\nbuildings were destroyed. At his death his widow was left with three\r\nsmall children and a scanty subsistence. Mrs. Stover has never asked\r\nCongress to indemnify her for any losses.\r\n\r\nVisitors at the White House during the past two or three years may\r\nretain the memory of a dignified, statuesque blonde, with a few very\r\nfine points which a fashionable butterfly once said would make any\r\nwoman a belle if she only knew how to make the most of them. Mrs.\r\nStover never became a star in fashionable circles, and now that she\r\nhas left the gay capital, perhaps for a lifetime, she is remembered\r\nby those who knew her best as the charming companion of the domestic\r\nfireside, a true daughter and a judicious mother.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of Mrs. Johnson was killed. Not long after his\r\nreceiving his diploma as physician, he was appointed a surgeon in the\r\nFirst Tennessee Infantry. One bright spring morning, starting on his\r\nrounds of professional duty in the exuberance of youth, health, and\r\nspirits, he sprang upon the horse of a brother officer. He had gone\r\nbut a short distance when the high-mettled creature reared upon its\r\nhind feet suddenly; the young man was thrown backward suddenly, and\r\nfalling upon the frozen earth, was instantly killed. The concussion\r\nfractured his skull. Mrs. Johnson has grieved for this son as did\r\nJacob for his beloved Joseph, and not only the mother but the whole\r\nfamily have mourned with unusual poignancy his untimely death.\r\n\r\nRobert Johnson, the eldest living son, entered the army as a\r\nvolunteer while still a young boy; and was given a position among\r\nthe older men, on account of his father. It was at this time that he\r\nformed the fearful habit of intemperance. As soon as Mrs. Johnson\r\nwas settled at the White House, she sent for this son, hoping that\r\nhis responsible position as private secretary to the President and\r\nthe personal influence of his sisters and herself could reclaim him;\r\nbut alas! she found his new position, in its surroundings, a still\r\nheavier death weight to her hopes. Clever, genial “Bob,” the young\r\nman who had the ear of the President at any time, was everybody’s\r\nfriend. A crowd followed him wherever he went. The choicest viands\r\nof Willard’s and Welcker’s were set before him, and miniature rivers\r\nwere made to float with wine. Robert Johnson is now in an asylum,\r\nhoping and trying to overcome this vice. During the few months of\r\nhis sojourn in Washington he provoked no enmity and left many true\r\npersonal friends.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson, jr., the youngest child, who makes the fourth\r\nand last of Mrs. Johnson’s children, is a boy of 15, attending\r\nthe college for young boys in Georgetown, D. C. He is a slender,\r\nfinely formed youth, characterized by the same modest deportment\r\nusual to the family. His face bears a striking resemblance to Mrs.\r\nPatterson’s, but at present he is only noticeable on account of his\r\nfamily relations, and because he is the last child of his mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnson is unusually feeble at this time; but, weather\r\npermitting, she will soon leave with Mrs. Patterson for her distant\r\nhome in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATORIAL PEN PICTURES.\r\n\r\nFERRY AS A HEART-BREAKER--CONKLING AS A NOVEL READER--EATON AND\r\nANTHONY IN REPARTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 20, 1869_.\r\n\r\nLike the great flaming carbuncle on the mountain’s brow, the dome of\r\nthe Capitol dispels the darkness in Washington. It is night. The moon\r\npeeps out between scudding clouds, the elements howl like a spirited\r\nchild, but the Senate is in open session. The original resolution\r\nendorsing the President’s course has been torn in shreds by the\r\npoliticians, and such bitter partisans as Cameron of Pennsylvania,\r\nand Dawes of Massachusetts, have paired off and ran home, rather than\r\nremain on the battlefield to bury the dead or carry off the mortally\r\nwounded. Within the Senate chamber the faithful are gathered; Morton,\r\nAnthony, and Conkling to lead the rank and file. The Democracy are in\r\nmartial line, defending the independent sovereignty of the States,\r\nwith Andy Johnson at the head, ready to die for the Constitution. The\r\nmagnificent decorations which make the Senate chamber a marvel of\r\nbeauty in the day seemed touched with the fairy hand of enchantment\r\nat night. The incomparable rays of the sun are rivalled by the mellow\r\nbeams of artificial light, which sift through the stained glass\r\nabove. It falls on the golden stars of the tufted carpet. It makes\r\nan areola around the head of Senator Ferry, the young President pro\r\ntempore of the Senate, who sits in one of those graceful attitudes so\r\nbecoming to the bachelor of the period. Major Ben: Perley Poore says\r\nhe was born in Mackinaw, Mich., June 1, 1827, consequently he will\r\nsoon reach his forty-eighth birthday, and not long after will score\r\noff a half a century. The newspapers call him “young,” and it can be\r\nseen that time has dealt very gently with him. His beard is as yellow\r\nas the golden fleece and his chestnut locks have defied the frost.\r\nContent with himself, content with the world, is written all over\r\nhis manly person. Has he a heart? This is a question which none are\r\nable to answer, but nevertheless he has been proved to be the most\r\nadept “lady-killer” of his day, and a bill is soon to be introduced\r\nby Senator Spencer, a rival bachelor, to arrest, if possible, this\r\nwholesale destruction. Senator Ferry never fails to gather a harvest\r\nof hearts during their proper season. When each generation of girls\r\nattains that point on life’s journey when the affections are like\r\nthe mellow flush of a juicy peach he walks in the garden, when lo!\r\npresto! change! something is gone! The young statesman is not harmed.\r\nHis eye has a brighter light, his cheek a warmer flush, and the\r\nrenovation lasts until the season approaches for another seed time\r\nand harvest. One-half the mischief lies in the fact of his being a\r\nmember of the Young Men’s Christian Association, and the other to the\r\nexquisite bouquets which are furnished free to Congressmen from the\r\nNational greenhouse. When the bouquets arrive regardless of time and\r\nnumber, it is a sign of a funeral where the corpse is invisible and\r\nthe mourners dare not show their heads. This kind of man is always in\r\nlove, deep love with himself, and, though a woman were as wise as a\r\nJuno and lovely as Hebe, she could never upset his vanity.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeepers are curled up asleep on the cushions in the corners\r\nof the galleries. Many of the Republicans have left their seats, and\r\nare to be found chatting and smoking in the adjoining cloak-rooms.\r\nThe fragrance of dying Havanas ascend to the galleries, reminding\r\none of the days of the Randolphs and Jays, when men sat in their\r\nseats in the Senate with their hats on, and smoking their clay pipes\r\nin full view. The habit is not cured, but it is concealed, and this\r\nmust be one of the facts which marks the progress of civilization. A\r\ntall man arises to address the Senate. It is Kernan, the new Senator\r\nfrom New York. He has reached the mid-autumn of human life. It is\r\nhis first speech, and a bouquet of Senators cluster around him. The\r\nback of his head has a heavy covering of dark iron-gray hair, but\r\nhis fine, scholarly face is rimmed with a fringe of pure white,\r\nwhich at once stamps his individuality on the memory. His Creator\r\nnever designed him for an orator, but he gives us good, sound sense,\r\ndressed neatly in pure English. He does not speak to convince his\r\nopponents. He seems to realize that what he says will be heard by\r\nthe millions of people in the State of New York. His colleague,\r\nConkling, sniffs him from afar, as one mastiff does another, if it\r\nbe a stranger of the same tribe. Roscoe has been reading a pamphlet\r\nwith a yellow cover, which he holds daintily between his finger\r\nand thumb. If it were any other but our Roscoe, the “yellow cover”\r\nwould be a serious suspicion of “Braddon” or “Ouida,” but the fact\r\nis self-evident that the book was obtained because the binding is a\r\ncomplete match for his hair. Senator Conkling is the Apollo of the\r\nSenate. His beauty is the aqua-marine type. It resembles a very fine\r\ndiamond considerably off color, unless one is fond of flame; then\r\nthe delusion is perfect. If Senator Conkling was a planet, he would\r\nbe called Mars, not because of his rapid revolution around the great\r\ncentral power, but owing to that precious high-colored ingredient\r\nwhich was used so lavishly in his physical construction, and which\r\nserves to keep his pride burning like the lamp of the vestal virgins,\r\nthat neither time nor circumstances can put out.\r\n\r\nCome back to the Senators that cluster around the Speaker! All new\r\nmen except Allison, of Iowa, one of the most polite and genial men to\r\nbe found. Out of courtesy, alone, if nothing else, he listens to the\r\nmaiden speech of his peer irrespective of the fact of his politics.\r\nThe first man that heads the list is Wallace, of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhom the gods have blessed with a fine face but a finer form, and\r\nyet it is evident that the Creator took no special pains with his\r\nconstruction; for he has thickly sprinkled just such men in every\r\ntown of the State, cities of course excepted. Senator Wallace has\r\nreached the Senate chamber in the noon of life. The sun is stationary\r\nover his head. His face is not the kind that tells its own story.\r\nThe tempest of passion has swept over it, but left no signs of the\r\ntornado in its track. If he has had deep thoughts they have ploughed\r\nno furrows. In his battle with time so far he has won. As he has\r\nnever tried his wings, it is too soon to pronounce him a senatorial\r\neagle, but as he hails from Pennsylvania he may turn out an honest\r\nbird of prey.\r\n\r\nTo the right of Senator Wallace may be seen B. K. Bruce, of\r\nMississippi, a handsome man, whom the Creator cast in bronze.\r\nDarker by far than Douglass or Pinchback, but superior to either\r\nso far as beauty is concerned. Below the colossal, but above the\r\naverage size, with a pure type of the Anglo-Saxon features, thin\r\nquivering nostrils, and a mouth such as the colored women are known\r\nto admire. His mahogany person is every day swathed in the finest\r\nlinen and broadcloth, ornaments, diamond shirt-studs. The day he was\r\nelected the members of the legislature of Mississippi owned great\r\nquantities of scrip, worth less than sixty cents on the dollar. But\r\non that auspicious day some speculator bought the scrip and paid\r\nfor it at par; but Senator Bruce had nothing to do with it, because\r\nhe is a very rich man, and only white men have been known to bribe\r\nlegislatures. Senator Bruce says he intends to stand by the civil\r\nrights bill, and proves it by employing white men to wait on him,\r\nand furthermore declares that he has no objection to Mrs. Bruce\r\nassociating with the wives of white Senators so long as their moral\r\ncharacters are above reproach, and they have committed no more\r\nserious crimes than Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to General Burnside, whose fine person bears\r\nthe brand of the military aristocracy, just as the blue-blooded\r\nEnglishman is sometimes stamped duke; just the right size for a\r\ngeneral, and with plenty of intellect to represent so small a State\r\nas Rhode Island. His graceful whiskers are festooned on his dainty\r\ncheeks and curl like the tendrils of the grape on the wall. As a man\r\namong men he is the same as a banana among fruits. The frost of time\r\nhas sweetened and brought him to the highest state of perfection.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable of the new men is the one who is just\r\nrising from his seat. When sitting he does not attract particular\r\nattention; but when he attempts the perpendicular one mentally\r\nasks: “When is he going to stop?” Hail! Cameron of the illustrious\r\nfamily of that name--the successor of the festive and woman-loving\r\nCarpenter, of Wisconsin. “Ye banks and braes of bonnie doon” is\r\nwritten all over this grizzly Scotsman, who is composed entirely of\r\nbone and muscle, and destitute of meat as Mother Hubbard’s cupboard.\r\nWhat a superb specimen of the Highlander! If he could only be induced\r\nto wear his Tartan, bring his bagpipe and show the Senate what is\r\nmeant by bringing together the two wings of the Cameron clan. Oh,\r\nCarpenter! Carpenter! will the time ever come when Wisconsin will\r\nweep tears of blood because she so bitterly scourged thee?\r\n\r\nThe man who occupies a seat this side of Cameron is Jones, of\r\nFlorida. Another red man, but not of the Saxon type of Conkling. The\r\nclay from which he is made must have been formed of iron pyrites. A\r\nsmooth face, thickly strewn underneath with arteries and veins, in\r\nwhich the scarlet fluid comes and goes at the slightest behest of\r\nthe passionate will. Tall and broad above the average of men, and,\r\nso far as physical appearance is concerned, a fitting representative\r\nof the lovely State of magnolia and orange groves, the Mecca of the\r\ninvalids, and the luscious retreat of the happy alligator.\r\n\r\nAnd this is dainty, delicious Pinckney Whyte, of Maryland, whose\r\npedigree is as clean and well defined as Victoria of England, and\r\nwho, by the way, in some remote manner, claims kinship to him. How\r\ngood it must feel to have such blood in one’s veins, and yet Pinckney\r\nhas made no complaint to the Senate. If he has scrofula like old\r\nGeorge the Third, there is no visible sign of it, and the only\r\nevidence of insanity he has shown was when he consented to come to\r\nthe American Senate. In violation of the maxim that precious things\r\nare never done up in large parcels, he is fully up to the average\r\nsize, with a handsome face, and features as finely cut as those of\r\nan exquisite cameo. What thin ears and slender fingers! It is true\r\nhe has not tried his strength in the senatorial race, and it is\r\nnot known whether he will succeed in writing his name high on the\r\nscroll of fame, but he has a mission, a noble mission, in which he\r\nmust succeed, for his presence helps neutralize the effect of the\r\ncarpetbaggers; and even this small bit of the purest respectability,\r\nlike the yeast in dough, in time may come to leaven the whole lump.\r\n\r\nSenator Eaton, of Connecticut, is speaking. He plays the sovereignty\r\nof the States like Ole Bull’s whole opera, on one string; but Senator\r\nAnthony has tripped him by asking: “How can a State be ‘sovereign’\r\nwhen she can neither make treaties, coin money, or go out to stay\r\nall night without asking her father, who is all the time her Uncle\r\nSam?” Senator Eaton replies that he would answer that question to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Senator from the little State of Rhode Island,\r\nbut he is sick and cannot be interrupted in his patriotic argument,\r\nand he again declares the sovereignty of the State, because little\r\nRhody, Connecticut, and pretty Delaware are the peers and equals of\r\nPennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. Why? Because they are independent\r\nsovereigns, and command the same respect.\r\n\r\nIt is now almost midnight. Behold the conquering hero comes. It is\r\nAndy Johnson, the veteran warrior of Tennessee. For the first time\r\nhe arises to address the highest legislative body on the face of the\r\nglobe. There is an ominous silence. He is asked by a brother Senator\r\nif Monday, the next day of the Senatorial calendar, will not do. An\r\naffirmative answer is received, and the session of the night adjourns.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATOR SPRAGUE.\r\n\r\nA NEW CHAMPION OF A PANACEA FOR ILLS FINANCIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 14, 1869_.\r\n\r\nA new music reaches the ear of Washington. It is the voice of the\r\nworkingmen, with brass instruments in their hands, saluting their\r\nnew leader. All hail! Senator Sprague of Rhode Island. The man who\r\ntouches the pulse of the invalid with an earnest desire to do the\r\npatient good is called a kind physician. The man who feels the\r\nfeverish pulse of a suffering nation, sees the people rise in their\r\nawful majesty, and immensity, echoes, “Here! Here!”\r\n\r\nSenator Sprague has been studying the rise and decline of nations.\r\nHe reminds us that there is a vicious something which underlies\r\nthe basis of modern as well as ancient society, a nameless horror\r\nwhich picks the bones of a nation just as Victor Hugo’s devil-fish\r\nfinishes the last delicate morsel of what was once a man. It is the\r\nsame to the nation that the destructive worm is to the ship. It is\r\nthe accumulation of tubercular deposits in the national tissues. The\r\nfatal seed of dissolution is already planted, and the harvest, when\r\ngarnered, will be safely packed away in the frightful storehouse\r\nof death. With blanched face, in the distance, we shrink from the\r\nleprous patient, but upon closer examination we find the “sick man”\r\nis old Uncle Sam, and his old war wounds are still unhealed, though\r\nin a healthy condition, and none give him any trouble to-day except\r\nthe sabre cut of Finance. In the early part of the last winter\r\nGeneral Butler laid his hand on this tremendous wound. The nation\r\nquivered with hope and expectation, but Uncle Sam said, “Hands off,\r\nmy brave general; don’t you see just so much of my substance has\r\nbeen shot away? If a lobster loses one of its claws, will any patent\r\nmedicine make it grow again? Leave the lobster to the care of the\r\nkindly elements, and a new member, precisely like the old one, makes\r\nits appearance, beautifully, by degrees. The humblest reptile can\r\nteach the wisest man important wisdom.” When just so much substance\r\nhas been destroyed by fire and sword, is it not the folly of madness\r\nto try to replace it by “financial policy”? Is there no other way\r\nto make a dollar except to dig the metal out of the bowels of the\r\nearth, take it to the mint, and give it a legitimate birth? The\r\nsmallest child can understand the great “financial problem” as it\r\nexists to-day. Did General Butler enlighten us on the subject? We\r\nowe just so many gold dollars. As a lawyer he pointed out the way\r\nin which we could avoid a partial payment of our honest debts. The\r\npeople said to General Butler, “We like your sagacity as lawyer, but\r\nwe still believe that time is the best cure for all.” General Butler\r\nthen subsided on the finance question. A new champion has arisen to\r\npoint out a greener path over which to journey, as we march heavy\r\nladened. It is the youthful millionaire, Senator Sprague. His bill\r\nbefore the Senate can be summed up in exactly three words: “Make\r\nmore greenbacks.” This is the way to make money plenty? Why not? If\r\nSenator Sprague wants ten thousand yards of calico, he manufactures\r\nit. If the workingman wants more money, he is advised to manufacture\r\nthe same. It is a great deal easier to print a paper dollar than\r\nto earn the gold the paper is expected to represent. But Senator\r\nSprague was born into the manufacturing business, and, as it has\r\nbeen of such vast importance to him, is it a wonder that he advises\r\nthe same employment to others when he has reaped riches and honor,\r\nwhilst he is yet a growing man? Senator Sprague would also make the\r\nGovernment a kind of “Grand Lama”--a huge autocrat doing business\r\nfor himself, just like Astor, Vanderbilt and Stewart. He would have\r\nhim loan money; also, make him liable to sue and be sued. To be sure,\r\nthis would extinguish all millionaire upstarts. So far so good; but\r\nwould it not also add fresh fuel to the fires of corruption? What is\r\nthe whisky ring but a set of dishonest officials, acting in the name\r\nof the Government, covering their plunder with the garments of Uncle\r\nSam? Instead of diminishing the power to rob the people, Senator\r\nSprague advocates an additional supply of the grand army officials.\r\nThe flock of to-day may be compared to a cloud of locusts. “No!” say\r\nour legislators. Only a lunatic attempts to extinguish a fire by\r\nthrowing on more fuel. A good government should be like the azure\r\nvault of heaven, resting on all alike, protecting the poor man in his\r\ncabin, the rich man in his palace, if he has honestly acquired his\r\nwealth. It should fall upon the honorable citizen like a web woven\r\nby fairy fingers; upon the criminal, whether powerful or weak, like\r\nthe lariat flung by the unerring hand of the Indian hunter of the\r\npampas. Senator Sprague and the workingmen who endorse him propose to\r\ntake from the Government this most holy inheritance bequeathed us by\r\nour Revolutionary ancestors, baptized anew by the precious blood of\r\nthree hundred thousand lives, and set it up in all the great cities\r\nof the Union, as the golden calf was set up in the wilderness, and\r\nthe people, instead of being told to bow the knee, are advised to\r\nborrow. How will this help the poor man who has no security to give;\r\nor is the great national broker expected to lend without any security\r\nat all? No one disputes the fact that a great harassing debt annoys\r\nthe people. It might have been much less. With sorrow we remember the\r\nmillions that were flung into the sea by the incompetency of the late\r\nNavy Department; but with this folly our creditors have nothing to\r\ndo. It is for us to say that we will pay to the last farthing. Shall\r\nwe allow speculators in the name of Uncle Sam to use the people’s\r\nmoney and take the risk of being benefited in the end? Never! No,\r\nnever! It is proven beyond a doubt that if the tax on whisky and\r\ntobacco could be honestly collected and turned over to the Treasury\r\nDepartment it would liquidate every penny of the interest of the\r\npublic debt; other taxes would then gradually consume the principal.\r\nBut if we are in haste, as we ought to be, to pay our debts, let the\r\nnoble women of this country say, “No more of our gold shall drift\r\nseaward to bring us back jewels, silks, and knick-knacks.” Let the\r\ngraceful, elegant wife of Senator Sprague be content with a wardrobe\r\nwhich vies in costliness with that of an European princess. Thirty\r\nsilk walking dresses, all made to fit the same exquisite image, were\r\nwithin hearing of the workingmen’s serenade.\r\n\r\nIf, then, sharp Benjamin Butler has knocked a hole in his keel by\r\ncruising amongst the financial breakers, Senator Sprague, so much\r\nyounger, with much less experience, need not be ashamed to strike his\r\ncolors before he goes down. No man in the Senate has a better record\r\nthan this intrepid young Senator. We may question his good taste\r\nabout bringing his Rhode Island battle upon the floor of the American\r\nSenate, but this harms no one but himself. In the strife for honor\r\nand fame at a nation’s hands he has had two difficulties to overcome.\r\nThe talent of his early life has been obscured by his immense wealth;\r\nin later years he has dwelt in the blighting shadows of greatness.\r\n\r\nOur first recollection of the rebellion cluster around his head. When\r\nthe great coal mines of Pennsylvania tossed out their grimy workers,\r\nand they rushed to the defence of Washington, without stopping to\r\nchange their clothes or bid their wives farewell, William Sprague was\r\nat the scene of action, giving his time, money, all that a man has to\r\ngive, that these citizen-soldiers might have wherewith to preserve\r\nlife. With the boom of the first cannon this citizen of Rhode Island\r\nflung his soul into the struggle for the life of the Republic. Away\r\nup in the rocky ledges of the American continent is a magic spring\r\nof smallest proportions. If at a certain period of the world’s life a\r\nforeign substance, no larger than a man’s boot, had been thrust into\r\nit, the course of the mighty Mississippi would have been changed.\r\nWho can estimate the incalculable blessing to this nation produced\r\nby a single man coming forward at exactly the right moment with the\r\nreal bone and sinew of war in his hands. He bought the blankets, and\r\ntincups, and loaves of bread for the new recruits, whilst General\r\nJim Lane was guarding Abraham Lincoln. It is superfluous to recall\r\nhis meritorious conduct as an officer in every fearful trial which\r\nhas rocked our ship of state, for it is fresh within the memory of\r\nus all. It may be said that many speeches for polish and elegance\r\nof diction surpass those of the Senator from Rhode Island, but the\r\ninquiry naturally arises, is a man dear to our hearts for his words\r\nor his deeds? For both, we answer. But if the two are not always\r\nfound wedded like husband and wife, give us the substance, and whilst\r\nthe Creator is filling anew his generous order for more men, let us\r\nhumbly petition that he send a good round number no better, no worse,\r\nthan Senator Sprague.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEALED SISTERS OF MORMONISM.\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH ONE OF THE RIBS OF BRIGHAM YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 23, 1869_.\r\n\r\nThe dreamy twilight which envelops the city during every recess of\r\nCongress has settled upon Washington. During the small hours of\r\nthe morning the tardy Senators have folded their tents and to-day\r\nthey are stealing away. Spring, clean and fresh as a mermaid, trips\r\ndaintily along our broad highways. The flowers are opening their\r\npretty eyes; the zephyrs greet us sweet as the breath of love, and\r\nall nature conspires to lead the mind into the luxurious revels\r\nof an Oriental extravaganza. The modern Caliph, Brigham Young, of\r\nUtah, has sent his beloved Zobedie to Washington, and to-day at\r\n11 a. m. her shadow falls across the door of the White House, but\r\nwhether she gains the ear of President Grant your correspondent\r\nknoweth not. Several weeks ago the newspapers told us that a number\r\nof women, all so-called wives of Brigham Young, were en route for\r\nthe States. A party composed of the elite of the Salt Lake harems\r\nare in Washington. No single man has two wives in the expedition.\r\nBrigham Young has contributed his favorite, whilst both of his two\r\nsons, who help compose the party, have confined themselves to one\r\napiece. Two single women are added to this rare bouquet, but whether\r\n“sealed” or otherwise is known only to the “Prophet” or the saints.\r\nThe party is stopping near the corner of I and Fourteenth streets,\r\nunder the protecting care of Mr. Hooper, the Delegate from Utah\r\nTerritory. It has been said by those who thought they were acquainted\r\nwith Mr. Hooper that he does not profess the Mormon faith, but for\r\nthe information of those who may be curious about this interesting\r\nsubject it is safe to believe that Brigham Young has no more faithful\r\nfollower than this accomplished Delegate.\r\n\r\nJust at this magic hour when the light and the darkness were\r\nquarreling for supremacy we might have been found in the presence of\r\none of our own countrywomen, a woman born in the great State of New\r\nYork, educated, beautiful, elegantly attired, and yet there seemed\r\nto be no common platform upon which we could meet and converse, for\r\nour ideas ran in grooves as far apart as thought can separate. Had\r\nit been Victoria, we could have recalled the memory of the Blameless\r\nPrince, or alluded to the Alabama claims; had it been Eugenie, we\r\ncould have seized Pio Nono; or Mrs. President Grant, we could have\r\napplied for the “Nasby” postoffice. But, oh, tortured soul, it was\r\nLady Zobedie, the seventieth double of Brigham Young. What did it\r\nmatter? Though she is a rib nearest his heart to-day, a woman with a\r\nruddier cheek may crowd her aside to-morrow. Woman, is she living,\r\nbreathing, poised on the edge of a frightful precipice? Yes! But a\r\nwoman with the fire of life smoldering in the ashes; no rollicking\r\nflame. A woman who would leave a room colder for having passed\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nConversation darted hither and thither like Noah’s dove, who could\r\nfind no rest for the sole of her foot. The watery waste of speech\r\nwas all around us, but the Gentile was afraid and the Saint coldly\r\nindifferent. The Gentile ventured to ask if the queen was not pleased\r\nwith the prosperity of our country, and was it not astonishing, after\r\nsuch a prolonged civil war?\r\n\r\nShe “hadn’t been accustomed to think much about such things.”\r\n\r\n“How does Utah compare with this part of the world?” was the next\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n“Not much difference; the world is just about the same all over.”\r\n\r\n“I am told it is very expensive living after you leave Omaha.”\r\n\r\n“I never think about such things.”\r\n\r\n“Have you met Madame Daubigney, the great French traveler? I am told\r\nshe has a reputation in Europe next to the late Madame Pneiffer. She\r\nis in Washington, and expects to leave soon for Salt Lake.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she has been to see me two or three times, but I try to\r\ndiscourage her. I don’t believe in women lecturers and women artists.\r\nI am told she dabbles in both.”\r\n\r\nA fearful pause.\r\n\r\n“Have you called upon Mrs. Grant?”\r\n\r\n“No, I never call upon ladies, but I intend to pay my respects to the\r\nPresident. I wouldn’t like to tell them at home that I hadn’t seen\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThe Gentile kindly alluded to the fact that Joseph Smith was an old\r\nacquaintance of her family, and although her father differed with him\r\nin belief, yet, as a neighbor, he was trusted with many of his first\r\nrevelations. No response; the electric current of the mind would not\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOur meeting was like the greeting of two planets whose paths happened\r\nto intersect. We neared each other for a moment, only to separate,\r\neach flying from the other, and one, if not both of us, feeling the\r\nawful effects of human fanaticism when it comes between two citizens\r\nof the same Republic.\r\n\r\nThe lengthening shadows of night crept into the room. A street lamp\r\nbefore the open window had been lighted, and its rays fell upon the\r\nmarble features of this pale, amber-haired blonde, and the classic\r\ncast of her countenance might have answered for a model of beauty\r\nfor either the sculptor or the painter. But other shapes almost as\r\ntangible were there also. They were the demons of the dark ages come\r\nback to mock us. This seventieth wife with her fair face had touched\r\nthe sepulchre of the past, and grinning specters of the past were\r\namong us. The very air seemed to say for this silent woman: “If we\r\nwere strong and you were weak, woman should again take her place at\r\nthe foot of a ladder. Is the woman of to-day wiser or better than was\r\nRachel or Sarah?”\r\n\r\nBrigham Young has sent this woman abroad to be on exhibition like\r\nany other work of art. She is expected to make new converts. She\r\nis allowed to indulge her taste in silks, jewels and point lace.\r\nThe other wives are young, giddy, and commonplace. Their manners\r\nare just what must be expected from youth and inexperience, and\r\ntheir conversation, so far as two of them are concerned, was only\r\nnoticeable on account of its warmth of grammatical accuracy. All the\r\nMormons who come to Washington make us feel that they are by the\r\nside of us yet not annealed with the great body of the people. They\r\nhave a bitter hatred of the Gentiles, cloaked, though it may be, by\r\na frigid politeness. Mr. Hooper says: “Things seem strange to you,\r\nout our way, but it is quite as strange to us in this part of the\r\ncountry; but we don’t feel like meddling with your institutions.” He\r\nalso remarked that it was very strange that so many people seemed\r\ndesirous to settle out in that part of the world. He said it was the\r\npoorest, most unattractive portion of the American continent. It was\r\nfor this reason that the “chosen people” exiled themselves, planted\r\ntheir homes where nature has set a bitter, sterile face. The late\r\ncry of “We only ask to be let alone” is borne to us from the saline\r\nhills of Utah. We answer it with the scream of the locomotive. The\r\nPacific Railroad is the guillotine which will cleave the head of\r\nMormonism asunder, and polygamy, the last sad relic of barbarism, the\r\none single blemish which clings to our beloved Republic, is doomed.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAWAITING AUDIENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DENT AND ROBERT DOUGLAS AS BUFFERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 27, 1869_.\r\n\r\nJust as the monarch of a Persian story gives audience to the high\r\nand low, so does President Grant receive the people, precisely after\r\nthe fashion of an Oriental tale. It is not quite certain whether the\r\nPresident roams about the capital in the disguise of a dervish, as\r\ndid the good Caliph Haroun Alraschid in his beloved Bagdad, but of a\r\nSunday, if the weather be fine, he dashes up Fourteenth street, drawn\r\nby steeds, as fleet as the far-famed Arabian coursers, and a cloud of\r\ndust envelops his costly barouche as potent and insinuating as the\r\nflying sand in the desert.\r\n\r\nA day in the ante-rooms of the White House will prove to the most\r\nskeptical that the “Arabian Nights” are as authentic as Hawthorne’s\r\n“Twice-Told Tales.” The Eastern Hemisphere had her rise and decline\r\nbefore the sun of civilization kissed our rugged New England hills.\r\nThe Orient is asleep. The Occident fills the eyes of the world to-day.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant has a grand vizier. It is General Dent, late of the\r\nUnion Army. It is the business of General Dent to receive all who\r\nseek the presence of the President. When Andrew Johnson was Chief\r\nExecutive, all those waiting for an audience with power were left\r\nby themselves to pass the long hours in waiting. It is somewhat\r\ndifferent now. The large reception room over the front of the East\r\nRoom is fitted up with tables, as well as sofas and chairs, and all,\r\nfrom the humblest to the highest, are admitted to General Dent’s\r\npresence. In the coziest corner of the reception room, beneath the\r\nwindow which commands the uninterrupted view of the delightful\r\npark which fronts the mansion, may be found the broad, long table\r\nat which General Dent sits, with his accomplished assistants by his\r\nside. General Dent is in the meridian of life, rather below the\r\nmedium size, though the rich, dark-blue military garb in which he\r\nis encased diverts the mind from size altogether. Now add a face,\r\nneither handsome nor plain, but a benign, good countenance, through\r\nwhich the soul shines like flame through an astral shade, and you\r\nhave the picture of the man through whose hands you are to pass\r\nbefore you are consigned to the august presence of majesty. At the\r\nsame table, directly opposite General Dent, may be seen the assistant\r\nprivate secretary, Mr. Robert M. Douglas, eldest son of the late Hon.\r\nStephen A. Douglas. Those who can recall the form and features of\r\nthe departed Senator will see them reproduced, but, like the second\r\nedition of the same book, a little revised and somewhat corrected.\r\nMr. Douglas inherits the broad shoulders, crowned by the same massive\r\nhead, so well remembered by the nation. His North Carolina speech has\r\nmade him famous as a youth, and it seems certain at present that he\r\nwas created to prove the exception to the rule that a great man never\r\nbequeaths his talent to posterity. The social manners of Mr. Douglas\r\nare such as would endear him to a sovereign as haughty as Queen\r\nElizabeth, and just as soon as he culminates as private secretary it\r\nwill be for the honor of the foreign service to send him abroad. But\r\nat the present he can not be spared from a certain ante-room in the\r\nWhite House.\r\n\r\nAt the left of General Dent may be seen Mr. Crook, one of the few men\r\nleft who were bequeathed as servants to the people by our beloved\r\nLincoln. He has seen the inauguration of four Presidents and the\r\ninstallation of three different families in the White House. His mind\r\nis a storehouse of legend and story. He is still a young man, more\r\nthan comely in personal appearance, and distinguished by social\r\nmanners which admirably befit court life.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to that part of the story which bears such a strong\r\nresemblance to an Eastern tale. High and low, rich and poor, all\r\nshades, all colors, from the blanched cheek of the haughty Circassian\r\nbelle to the Ethiopian polished ebony, may be found waiting in the\r\nante-rooms of the White House. Yellow women are there, with skins\r\nlike dead gold, their large, soft, lustrous eyes reminding one of a\r\nMoorish picture. A dash of a carriage is heard on the stone pavement\r\nbelow. Two elegant women alight, in faultless traveling costume. They\r\nare shown by a messenger to the ante-room, and General Dent arises\r\nto receive them. One of them is exceedingly beautiful. “We have\r\ncalled,” says the beauty, “to pay our respects to the President.”\r\n“Any business?” inquires General Dent. The dainty upper lip curls\r\nperceptibly. “None whatever; we are traveling; we wish to see the\r\nPresident.” “Impossible, Madame,” the General replies. “All these\r\npeople you see are waiting to see the President on business. General\r\nGrant would be pleased to see you, but he has no time he can call his\r\nown.” The great, haughty eyes of the traveler wander about the room.\r\nAs the two are about to depart General Dent asks them if they would\r\nbe “shown about the building”? A dignified consent being given, the\r\ntwo stately swans sail away, piloted by the same messenger who showed\r\nthem up the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the inner temple tremble on their hinges, and the form\r\nof a ponderous Senator emerges from the presence of the sun of day.\r\nIt is Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts. He strides to a centre table\r\nand shakes hands with a distinguished group of men, composed of\r\nCole of California, Carpenter of Wisconsin, irrepressible General\r\nButler, and General Markland, the personal friend of General Grant,\r\nwho was nominated for Third Assistant Postmaster-General. Very soon\r\nMr. Gobright of the Associated Press joins hands with them; but the\r\nattention of all eyes is drawn in another direction. Two strangers\r\nare announced, and again General Dent arises to receive them. Two\r\nstrange beings,--the man wears the national costume of Burmah, the\r\npicturesque turban, and the high-colored shawl gracefully draped\r\nabout his person; the woman has spoiled her identity by adopting\r\ncertain portions of European dress. They are native Burmese, and have\r\nbeen studying in this country, but soon take their departure for\r\nBurmah, where they expect to act as missionaries. They have called to\r\nbid President Grant farewell, and are at once shown into his presence.\r\n\r\nEvery hour brings new arrivals. A colored delegation from Alexandria\r\nhas arrived. It was promised they should see the President at 1\r\no’clock. It is now past the hour, but still they wait patiently.\r\nIt seems to be the colored man’s fate to wait. There is a silent\r\ngrandeur about this resignation. It is like the march of the\r\ncenturies. Art has portrayed it in the face of the Egyptian sphynx.\r\n\r\nA few Senators have seen the President. General Butler has dashed\r\nin there where none of the rest are allowed to go. No one saw a\r\nmessenger depart with his card. He went in, disappeared for a moment\r\nonly, and now flings himself again amongst the throng. He takes a\r\ncigar from a side pocket and a barbarous arrangement of some kind\r\nfrom another. With the last thing he is going to kindle a fire. He\r\nstrikes the flint against the serpent, and something clicks like the\r\nlock of a gun. One! two! three! Civilization and Barbarism once more\r\nembrace and General Butler has lighted his cigar by the flame, and at\r\nthe same time, like the blaze of a comet, he has disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe weary, weary waiters! The sun begins to blink askance, and to\r\ncreep into western windows. A man says: “This is the tenth day I have\r\nwaited to see the President.” Some of the people who were always\r\nto be found haunting Andrew Johnson have transferred themselves\r\nto President Grant. These are the barnacles, or fungi, which every\r\nadministration inherits from its predecessor. A pale woman in weeds\r\nseems to shrink away behind the friendly covering of an open door.\r\nHer face is tear-stained. A feeble little child sits calmly by her\r\nside. There is much to attract sympathy to the woman. The joyousness\r\nof infancy seems to be trampled out of the innocent child. Little\r\nsickly bud, growing in the shadow of grief, God help thee!\r\n\r\nIn the space of one hour audience day will be over, and the\r\ndisappointed will go, to return again on the morrow.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN M. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nA FUND OF REMINISCENCES AT THE COMMAND OF THE JOURNAL CLERK OF THE\r\nHOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _November 6, 1869_.\r\n\r\nFor more than a score of years strangers visiting the House of\r\nRepresentatives may have noticed, at the right hand yet a little\r\nbelow the speaker, a dignified, majestic man, who says the least,\r\nyet, perhaps, we may say, does the most, for the country of any man\r\nwithin hearing of the Speaker’s voice. The name of this man is John\r\nM. Barclay, and without his presence, or another equally potent\r\nin his place, the House of Representatives might be likened to a\r\nlocomotive deprived of its beloved steam. The business of the House\r\ncan proceed with an indifferent Speaker, weakness and effeminacy in\r\nother officers can be borne; but the man whose business it is to keep\r\na faithful record of all that is done in the House has to get his\r\ncommission from his Creator, and then have it approved by the man who\r\nhappens to be elected Clerk of the House. It is Mr. Barclay’s duty to\r\nhand down the archives of the nation to other generations. For the\r\nlast twenty years his mind has been a river through which the work\r\nof the House of Representatives has found its way into history. In\r\nthis noisy, turbulent House it is his place to catch that which is\r\nproper and legitimate and fix it in permanent form for the benefit\r\nof the whole country. The Clerk of the House is the responsible\r\nfigure-head for this most important position, but Mr. Barclay is the\r\npower behind the throne. In the clamor for office, petitions few or\r\nnone are sent up for the one Mr. Barclay occupies. A man to take his\r\nplace must have a perfect understanding of parliamentary law. When\r\nthe House is in session, not for a moment must his attention wander\r\nfrom the points of discussion. The reporters in the gallery can enjoy\r\ntheir little siestas, give and take from each other; but Mr. Barclay\r\nmust depend upon himself. So long has he occupied this position, so\r\nadmirably has he performed his difficult duties, that he may now be\r\ncompared to an exquisite piece of machinery. He never gives offence.\r\nIn early years he was a Whig, in later a Republican; but so just is\r\nhe that partisan sentiments are entirely overlooked, and both parties\r\nin the House reverence him alike.\r\n\r\nThe usages and precedents of the British Parliament constitute the\r\nbasis of all parliamentary law amongst people who speak the English\r\nlanguage. Many years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote a book, which\r\nis called “Jefferson’s Manual of Parliamentary Practice.” It is\r\nformed of the precepts of the United States Constitution, and the\r\nregulations early adopted in the United States Senate, collated with\r\na digest of English Parliamentary practice. This book is a well-known\r\nauthority in this country. Mr. Barclay furnishes the House with a\r\nmanual containing a digest of its own rules, so much of Jefferson’s\r\nManual as governs the proceedings of the House, together with the\r\nprecedents of order, usages of the House, etc., which is really a\r\ncomplete and independent code by which the House is guided. The\r\nrules and laws of the House of Representatives of the United States\r\nare universally adopted for the government of all State and local\r\nconventions, and form the basis of the rules and practice of nearly\r\nall State legislatures. The influence of Mr. Barclay’s knowledge and\r\njudgment, therefore, in the parliamentary affairs of the country,\r\nwill be seen to be very great. A correspondent of much repute, in a\r\nletter some time ago, which has been widely copied, made the clerk to\r\nthe late Speaker, an estimable young man, entirely innocent of the\r\nprofundities and bewildering intricacies of parliamentary law, the\r\nactual monitor of Mr. Colfax--a mistake hardly necessary to correct.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay has seen the rise and decline of the reign of eight\r\ndifferent Speakers, Mr. Blaine being the ninth on the list. Of the\r\nSpeakers whose sceptres have withered, whose gavels have sounded for\r\nthe last time, Mr. Barclay gives Mr. Colfax the credit of being the\r\nbest parliamentarian, as well as the hardest and most persevering\r\nstudent of the law. Mr. Barclay has seen the proud honor of Speaker\r\nbestowed upon Robert C. Winthrop, Howell Cobb, Linn Boyd, N. P.\r\nBanks, James L. Orr, William Pennington, Galusha A. Grow, Schuyler\r\nColfax, and James G. Blaine.\r\n\r\nDuring the long years of treason and rebellion he was a silent\r\nwitness of the moral battles in the House. This warfare steadily\r\npreceded the smoke of the cannon and the surgeon’s glittering knife.\r\nIt is true Mr. Barclay stores up only the actual substance of the\r\nHouse; and yet how much he might reveal in regard to this august\r\nbody which is left out of the official record, as well as out of\r\n“Gobright’s Recollections of a Third Century,” and also the awful\r\ncolumns of the Congressional Globe.\r\n\r\nShould Mr. Barclay have kept notes of his long experience at the\r\nhelm of the House, what a book he could make. His calm, judicial\r\nmind would be sure to do justice to all parties. No reporter in\r\nthe gallery of “the gods” over his head--no statesman on the floor\r\nbelow--could give so many fascinating pages. He could describe the\r\nmen who sat in the House when Cobb was Speaker,--most of them now\r\ngathered to their fathers. He could tell us of the finished orator,\r\nJames McDowell, of Virginia, and of that great speech of his, in\r\n1850, which electrified the country; of George C. Drumgoole, of the\r\nsame State, calm and clear even in his potations; of the knight of\r\nlater strifes, the spotless patriot and pure rhetorician, Henry\r\nWinter Davis, of Maryland; of Hotspur Keitt, and handsome, hectoring\r\nBrooks, of South Carolina; of dandy Dawson, of Louisiana; of gifted\r\nbut self-destroying McConnell, of Alabama; of quick George W.\r\nYoung, of Tennessee; of young Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, when\r\nhe first came into the House, wearing a Byron collar; of haughty\r\nToombs; logical Stephens; jolly T. H. Bayly; quiet Mr. Aiken;\r\nnervous Clingman; dominating David Wilmot; brilliant D. K. Carter,\r\nand eloquent Henry M. Fuller. He could narrate many a side-scene in\r\nthe great drama, when the actors got behind the curtain and sported\r\nin their own green-room. He could show how the great struggle grew\r\nfrom words to blows, from blows to battles, and from battles to\r\ndefeat. With Cobb and Orr, and Banks and Pennington, and Grow and\r\nColfax, Barclay was on terms of equality and intimacy. He could\r\ndescribe the discomfiture of Barksdale when he lost his yellow wig;\r\nof Potter, when he answered Pryor and offered to fight him; of the\r\nquarrel between Cutting and Breckinridge; of Douglas in his prime,\r\nand of Adams in his decay; and of the whole procession of life, fun,\r\nfrolic, sorrow, failure, disgrace, and death; of the pages who grew\r\nto be generals, of the generals who became Congressmen, and of the\r\nCongressmen who longed to be President. Write us a book, Colonel\r\nBarclay. You are still in your prime. Take a reporter to your room,\r\nand let him interview you, if you won’t jot it off in your own\r\nclerkly hand; and if Congress don’t vote you a pension, or retire you\r\non a solid annuity, you and your posterity can live on the proceeds,\r\nand be honored in the inevitable credit it will confer on your name.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\nGRACE GREENWOOD, PHŒBE COUZINS, AND OTHER ADVOCATES OF THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 18, 1870_.\r\n\r\nThe National Woman Suffrage Convention was inaugurated last evening\r\nin Washington by a lecture on domestic life by Grace Greenwood.\r\nA respectable-sized audience, with young people largely in the\r\npreponderance, under the auspices of the Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociation, welcomed the authorities to the platform, and listened\r\nwith grace, respect, and occasional spice of applause, to the essay\r\nchristened “Indoors.” With a handsome, gallant preamble, Mrs.\r\nLippincott (better known to the world as Grace Greenwood), was\r\nintroduced, and her lecture went far to prove that women “indoors”\r\ncould accomplish far more for the benefit of the human race than on\r\nthe platform. There was intellect enough in the talented woman to\r\nfill Lincoln Hall, but unfortunately physical power was wanting. Not\r\nover one-third of those present were within hearing of the speaker’s\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nNature has set her face against women as public speakers unless\r\nthey have been trained for the stage, like Olive Logan. No woman’s\r\nvoice can bear the tension of an hour and a quarter without becoming\r\nhusky and even painful to the last degree, and the speaker of the\r\nevening was no exception to the rule. Grace Greenwood appeared upon\r\nthe platform in heavy black silk, with scarlet trimmings, which well\r\nbecame her dark autumnal beauty. She has a face of character, like\r\nFanny Kemble, which glows and pales according to the combustion\r\nwithin. She commenced her lecture by saying that “Horace Greeley has\r\nsaid that old-fashioned domestic life has taken its departure.” She\r\nsaid she hoped the time would come when the women would be developed\r\nmentally, morally, physically, but about that time the millennium\r\nwould appear. She said woman, though denied the privilege of an\r\nequal chance to earn her own living, yet had the same chance on the\r\nscaffold, and the same swing at death. From English literature she\r\nabstracted what purported to be a description of the ideal woman.\r\nThis creature was to be blessed with patience, a desire to stay at\r\nhome, little learning. By no means was she to know how to spell\r\ncorrectly; as an accomplishment she was to know how to lisp. Then she\r\ndrew a picture of Fanny Kemble as Lady Macbeth, a woman whose trained\r\nrobe would sweep the men who concocted such pictures off the stage.\r\nAt one time she intended to write a course of lectures to young men,\r\nbut she did not say what deterred her from doing so. She gave us a\r\nglowing description of home, but regretted that the homes of the\r\naristocracy were invaded by the “Jenkinses” and all the sacredness\r\ntherein laid bare. Among those she denominated as Jenkins were the\r\ndistinguished writers, George Alfred Townsend and Don Piatt. In\r\npainting the home she gave the “old maid” the most exalted position,\r\nand she decided that single life is not entirely bereft of comfort.\r\nThe marriage relation, its joys, its sorrows, its struggles, were\r\ndelineated with poetic fervor, and those who were fortunate enough to\r\nhear her pronounced the evening’s entertainment a success.\r\n\r\nTen o’clock, January 18, the hour and day appointed for the Woman\r\nSuffrage Convention, found Lincoln Hall decorated. Soon after a\r\nfew women came in; slowly the number increased until a small and\r\nappreciative audience had gathered. Very few men were sprinkled\r\naround, but quite enough to receive the anathemas that were to be\r\nshowered upon the whole sex. At just a quarter to 11 a side door from\r\nthe platform opened and some of the shining lights of the “cause”\r\ncame into view. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, majestic and beautiful as\r\na snowy landscape, came forward with that grace as indescribable\r\nas it is incomparable. An elegant black silk and a camel’s hair\r\nscarf made up her perfect costume. At her right sat Mrs. Pauline\r\nDavis, of Providence, R. I., another exquisite picture of the snow.\r\nShe was most daintily attired in blue satin and black velvet, and\r\nin the contemplation of this serene and noble picture the mind is\r\nreconciled to old age. Susan B. Anthony was there in black silk,\r\nwith soft white lace around her throat, but even lace, frothy as\r\nsea-foam, failed to relieve that practical face. Just what a gnarled\r\noak is amongst trees Susan B. Anthony is to her sex,--hard, obdurate,\r\nuncompromising. Josephine Griffin, best among women, was there at her\r\npost, one of the most earnest in the cause. Mrs. Wright, the sister\r\nof Mrs. Mott, brought a kind greeting from that venerable woman, who\r\nwas kept at home by age and other infirmities. But the ornament of\r\nthe platform was Phœbe Couzins, of St. Louis, a young law student\r\nof that distinguished city. Her elegant outfit was made of a light,\r\nneutral-tinted silk adorned with tiny flounces. A double-breasted\r\njacket of blue velvet, with jaunty Lombardy hat to match, upon which\r\na bird of paradise seemed to nestle from choice. Don’t we pity the\r\njudge when Phœbe shall plead before him! One flash from those eyes\r\nsurmounted by the arched brows--but, stop, the illusion is not\r\ncomplete, the rosy lips are wanting. Henry Clay had a large mouth,\r\nand it did not prevent his becoming a great lawyer.\r\n\r\nA description of Professor J. K. H. Wilcox, so prominently identified\r\nwith the “cause,” is necessary, in order to show why, in some\r\nrespects, the movement is retarded. This man is afflicted with a\r\nmild form of lunacy, after the form of George Francis Train, and,\r\nlike every other decoction of weakness, becomes sickening from its\r\ninsipidity. He is called professor, but the most minute inquiry\r\nfails to discover by what means he has earned this appellation.\r\nLike Train, whom he takes for his model, his object is notoriety,\r\nand it is safe to assume he will achieve a success. Professor Wilcox\r\nwas entrusted with a message to his countrymen from Clara Barton,\r\nwho is now residing abroad. A few simple words were sent to the late\r\nsoldiers by this good woman, but why the paper should be read at a\r\nwoman’s meeting only Professor Wilcox can disclose.\r\n\r\nBut if the solemn women who represent the “cause” have a desire to\r\nsee the world move they had only to look at the reporter’s desk and\r\nsee the large yellow envelopes marked “New York _Tribune_.” Behind\r\nthe papers might be seen Miss Nellie Hutchinson, who has earned the\r\ntitle of the “spicy little reporter of the _Tribune_.” Miss Nellie\r\nallows her hair to wander in “maiden meditation, fancy free.” Her\r\njaunty military suit, trimmed with gilt cord and buttons, shows at\r\nonce her determination to win a battle. She is said to be a strong\r\nadvocate for the “cause,” and writes it up just as much as the\r\n_Tribune_ will permit. As all valuable papers were handed to her by\r\nMiss Anthony from the platform, whilst your correspondent was left\r\nin the cold, she gives this fact as a slight proof of the kindness\r\nbestowed upon a lady who is engaged upon the _Tribune_. As the\r\nperusal of these papers was not shared by the correspondent of _The\r\nPress_, any omissions are requested to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn a few handsome words, Mrs. Stanton introduced Miss Phœbe Couzins,\r\nwho began her brief address by quoting, “Westward the Star of Empire\r\ntakes its way.” Then she told us that the East must look to her\r\nlaurels, else she would wake up and find them stranded on the shores\r\nof the Western rivers. Had Phœbe read the Scotch Parson in an old\r\nnumber of the _Atlantic Monthly_ on the subject of “veal,” she never\r\nwould have gone so far sky-rockety on the subject of the Territory of\r\nWyoming. Mrs. Stanton says the subject is settled out there once and\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paulina Davis read a letter from John Stuart Mill, in which he\r\nsaid he regretted not being able to respond to their kind invitation,\r\nbut that he thought Americans abundantly able to take care of the\r\ncause. He then eulogized his wife, and said she had been the means of\r\nconverting him.\r\n\r\nSenator Pomeroy, the only man from Congress in the hall, followed\r\nwith a few appropriate remarks. But considering that Mrs. Pomeroy\r\nwas at home, and did not countenance the meeting with her presence,\r\nit looked something like those electioneering dodges which the best\r\nof politicians sometimes indulge in. Senator Pomeroy said he was no\r\nnew convert to the “theme.” The Scotch parson advises young people\r\nnever to talk about “themes,” but as Senator Pomeroy is no longer\r\nyoung, the advice of the parson cannot be meant for him. The Senator\r\nsaid he would not compel a woman to vote; he would simply remove the\r\nimpediments in the way. He talked about “the mountains near where God\r\ndwells.” He said he had been waiting two months for petitions to be\r\nsent in. Mrs. Stanton interrupted him and said she had brought them.\r\nHe said he was for carrying woman suffrage into the fundamental laws\r\nof the land. He would let a Chinese vote, only a Chinese could not be\r\nnaturalized, and therefore could not vote. If a woman was convicted\r\nof crime, she must die. A woman had once been hung in Washington.\r\nThis is the new year for the rallying question. He only hoped this\r\nconvention would be a triumphant success.\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony then came forward and attempted to read a letter\r\nfrom a Jersey “Honorable,” but the writing was so poor that she could\r\nnot. Then she explained what the man meant, but by what process is\r\nknown only to Susan herself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cady Stanton came forward and said if the Republican party did\r\nnot come forth and champion the cause, the Democrats would, and\r\ntherefore infuse a new life into their decaying body. She also\r\ninstanced a case where a Democrat had paid the fare of all the ladies\r\nin the omnibus that morning coming from the depot to the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful prayer delivered at the opening of the session by the\r\nRev. Mr. May, from Syracuse, was worthy of a better cause. The few\r\nremarks which followed by the same man were more creditable to his\r\nheart than head; but he was sincere and honest, and one could not\r\nhelp but wish that more men like him could be found in the world.\r\n\r\nThe audience was made up mostly of women, but not the curled, dainty\r\nfashionables of the capital. Sad-faced, sorrowful women were there. A\r\npoor woman touched your correspondent on the arm, and asked if they\r\n“got places for women to work here.” Queenly Mrs. Davis was reading,\r\nregal in diamonds and point lace. The woman added, pointing to the\r\nspeaker, “Do you think she can help me?”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\nHOW SHE ENGINEERS THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 19, 1870_.\r\n\r\nThe hour having arrived for the opening of the last evening’s\r\nsession, and the great lights not appearing on the stage, it was\r\nmoved by Professor Wilcox and seconded that Mrs. Joseph Griffing be\r\nchosen temporarily to occupy the chair. The Hon. James M. Scovel, of\r\nNew Jersey, was asked to speak, and immediately began. He said it was\r\nthe coming question whether women shall have the ballot. He believed\r\nthe thing is right. His mother had said when she went to a village\r\nand saw men coming out of a house she knew that to be a tavern;\r\nwhen she saw women going in she knew that to be a church. It is not\r\nflattery that women want; it is their rights. The time had been in\r\nJersey when women had no more rights than lunatics and idiots, and it\r\nwas not much better to-day. He didn’t come there to make a speech; he\r\ncame there a convert. We shall have no peace until women can go side\r\nby side with men to the ballot-box. At this point Mr. Scovel retired,\r\nhaving proved to the rather slim audience that “stump speaking” was\r\nan accomplishment that sometimes made its escape from Jersey.\r\n\r\nAgain the irrepressible Wilcox appeared and read a letter which\r\nhe had received from the wife of O’Donovan Rossa, in answer to\r\nhis polite invitation to be present at the meeting. Madame Rossa\r\nregretted that unavoidable departure from the country prevented her\r\nattendance. She also added some nice things about liberty and her\r\ngood wishes for the speedy advancement of the cause.\r\n\r\nJust as the letter was concluded, Mrs. Stanton swept upon the\r\nstage, followed by the planets in her train. She came forward and\r\nintroduced Mrs. Wilbour, of New York. Mrs. Wilbour, stately in black\r\nvelvet, point applique, and diamonds, came forward and read a rather\r\nprosy, dry essay. Mrs. Wilbour has a voice for public speaking\r\nsuperior to most of her sex. She varied the old question by asking\r\nfor human rights instead of woman’s rights. She said it is urged that\r\nwoman has less force than man, and therefore, should not exercise\r\nthis inalienable right. She asked what should rule--force power or\r\nbeauty power? Brain not brawn rules this world. A small white hand\r\ncan move an engine, or wield a pen, an instrument stronger than the\r\nsword. All that gives harmony to the world is the beautiful. Religion\r\nbeautifies the soul. A preponderance of beauty is on the feminine\r\nside, but force is found on the masculine. Mrs. Wilbour talked about\r\nthe ballot as a little slip of paper. She might as well have spent\r\nher strength on the paper wadding instead of the deadly bullet that\r\nfollows it. After a time the sleepy essay came to an end.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton then came forward, introducing the Hon. A. G. Riddle,\r\none of the most distinguished lawyers of the District. She prefaced\r\nthe introduction by calling him a lawyer but an honest man. He\r\ngave us the argument; the audience were the jury, but no judge was\r\npresent to decide the case. Mr. Riddle said the question of the\r\nfinal relation of the sexes had come for final adjudication. These\r\nmasculines must look the question in the face. It is so broad you\r\ncan’t go around it. As Mr. Riddle has said the best things so far, it\r\nis to be regretted that so much of it has been lost.\r\n\r\nThe next speaker was Miss Couzins, of St. Louis. She said she felt\r\ngreat trepidation in coming forward when she found the great men\r\nat the national capital turning a cold shoulder for reasons of\r\npolicy, and the women given up to frivolity and fashion. She felt\r\nlike drinking inspiration from the West, where the leading people\r\nwere with her. She felt she was fighting a forlorn hope, but\r\nWashington fought a forlorn hope at Valley Forge, and won a victory.\r\nShe graphically delineated the saying of women being classified\r\nwith lunatics, idiots, slaves, etc. Women have a right to demand\r\nthat the laws shall be changed in order to insure their happiness.\r\nWomen had been subjected from the time of William the Conqueror.\r\nBible authority is quoted to oppose the ballot; but there was no law\r\nfound there for a man and a separate law for woman. Men say when a\r\nmajority of women desire the ballot they shall have it. She said if\r\nthe majority had rights the minority had also. Deeds of heroism were\r\nrelated. She said a monument was about to be erected in Washington,\r\ndedicated to the martyrs who fell in the late war. The women of St.\r\nLouis sent word to know if women were represented. They received the\r\nanswer: “No, but if the women of St. Louis would raise the money\r\nfor it, they should have a shaft placed near the monument, with the\r\nGoddess of Liberty on the top of it.” She alluded to the freed women\r\nof the South, forgetting however, to say that they, being an integral\r\npart, were uplifted with the race. At a very late hour, with the\r\ntermination of Miss Couzin’s speech, the evening session closed.\r\n\r\nThe second day’s session was opened with a prayer by the Rev. Mr.\r\nMay, of Syracuse, who thus far has assumed the spiritual direction of\r\nthe movement. Mrs. Griffing came forward and said the great object of\r\nthe meeting was to secure legislation by Congress. The press follows\r\nevery reform with its scandal. Christ has arisen from the dead, and\r\nthe women all over the country are making application. Will Congress\r\nadhere to the Constitution? She had hope and faith that Congress will\r\nhear us. No ray of divine life quickens Congress. Women, raise your\r\nvoices in prayer. A eulogy to Stanton was pronounced, whom she styled\r\nthe last of the trinity of martyrs--John Brown, Abraham Lincoln, and\r\nEdwin M. Stanton. She said that this discriminating word “male”\r\nshall be expunged from every law of the District.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the speech Professor Wilcox came forward and\r\nsaid that no effort had been put forth by the President to close\r\nthe Departments so that the clerks would be enabled to attend the\r\nwoman-suffrage convention. Mrs. Stanton said she had seen the\r\nPresident, and he had said he was too busy to attend the convention,\r\nso the cream of the movement was skimmed to confer with the ruler of\r\nthe Republic. This committee which is to beard the lion in his den is\r\ncomposed of Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony, Mrs. Wright, Mrs. Wilbour,\r\nMrs. Davis, Rev. Olympia Brown, Phœbe Couzins, Mrs. Beecher Hooker\r\nand several others. After this business matter was finished Miss\r\nAnthony came forward to excuse the absence of Miss Lillie M. Peckham,\r\nof Milwaukee, by saying she was detained at home by the sickness of\r\nher brother. This incident went to prove that strong-minded women\r\nhave sympathies and feelings like other people. A few letters from\r\nobscurity were brought forth, but did not add any brilliancy to the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the meeting Senator Pomeroy, who was on his way to\r\nCongress, called in to give a word of encouragement. He said it was a\r\nlong time before the movement could even get the ear of the public.\r\nMen were for making fighting the basis of suffrage. Who are those\r\nwho are called to bear arms? Would you disfranchise a man because he\r\nis over forty-five? The military power is subservient to the civil.\r\nThis is a government of law, not of force. Who feeds, clothes, and\r\nsupports the soldiers in the field, and thus secures our victories?\r\nServices were rendered by women in those hours who cannot vote. Women\r\nhave borne arms. In Northampton, Mass., near where the Senator was\r\nborn, was a tombstone on which was cut in the marble, “Her warfare is\r\naccomplished.” This stands there in time-honored memory to prove the\r\nmilitary qualities of the sex. There was an inequality in the basis\r\nof representation, and if the mothers, wives, and sisters were not so\r\nmuch better than we are, they would not have borne the deprivations\r\nof their rights. Remove the obstacle to education; open every hall\r\nto black and white, male and female. Remove the obstacles; repeal\r\nthe law; I am for the sixteenth amendment; a woman is a citizen, and\r\nshould have the power to legislate in the District of Columbia. There\r\nare places of employment not open to women. There are offices under\r\nthe government which women should have. We must “fight it out on this\r\nline,”--but the quotation was left unfinished, and the distinguished\r\nSenator sat down. But wishing to see the effect of his glowing words,\r\nhe moved that those women in the audience who wished to vote should\r\nraise their hands. Not a score of hands were to be seen.\r\n\r\nAt this unfortunate moment Mrs. Stanton came forward to the rescue\r\nof the bewildered Senator. “Allow me,” said this lieutenant-general,\r\n“to correct the Senator. Those who wish to vote are requested to sit\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\nThe command was instantly obeyed. Not a woman was seen to move. The\r\nSenator wiped the perspiration from his forehead and looked his\r\nthanks to the gallant chief of the staff, whose strategy had saved\r\nthe day. Afterwards those who did not wish to vote were requested\r\nto show their colors. A few women were noticed making themselves\r\nconspicuous, but the great mass were not to be deluded into giving an\r\nexpression either one way or another.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton then introduced Madame Anneke, a German woman who could\r\nnot talk English, but could talk the language of the heart--an\r\nimmense woman, whose weight would reach the hundreds. The stage\r\nshook under her powerful trampings. She made up for language in\r\npantomime. She drew her hands through her short hair as only a poet\r\ncan describe. She said she had waded fields of blood, but this had\r\nnot been her greatest trials. She had come from Wisconsin with a\r\nheavy load--the petition of many hundreds who wanted to vote. She had\r\ncome with credentials from “t’ousands and t’ousands.” She appealed in\r\nthe name of Germany--in the name of all Europe. The enfranchisement\r\nof women would be the enfranchisement of the whole human race.\r\n\r\nMadame Anneke then retired, giving place to a woman as lean as she\r\nwas fat--a Quaker woman from Philadelphia. This dear, good old\r\nQuakeress looked spiritual enough to be translated. She gave us some\r\ngood Quaker doctrine, such as Philadelphia knows all about, and her\r\nremarks, for this reason, are omitted. She was called Mrs. Rachel\r\nMoore Townsend.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Townsend the Rev. Olympia Brown came forward, the\r\nbrightest, freshest, strongest woman we have ever heard devoted to\r\nthe “cause.” She is a small woman, and looks exactly as one might\r\nimagine Charlotte Bronte--a picture of exquisite nicety, from the\r\ndainty point lace collar to the perfect fitting shoe.\r\n\r\nShe commenced her address to those who did not wish to vote: “You\r\nmay say you are in comfortable homes, with kind husbands and kind\r\nfathers, and you may wonder what these strong-minded women want.\r\nThe temperance question alone shows the want of the ballot for the\r\ndrunkard’s wife. Women have been patient too long, and therefore\r\nresponsible in a degree for the sin of drunkenness. I wish women\r\nwould stand up and say they would not encourage men who use\r\nintoxicating drinks and tobacco. We are seeking a nobler womanhood.\r\nIt is the duty of every mother to feel that she is responsible for\r\nthat society into which she sends her son. Our young lady should have\r\nsomething to look forward to. A young lady, upon leaving school, told\r\nher companion that she was sorry that school had ended, because she\r\nwould have nothing to do. ‘Can’t you stay at home and make pretty\r\nthings to wear?’ was the reply. This assertion and answer covered the\r\nwhole ground of young ladyhood.” When she first entered the world\r\nas a young woman, she consulted her minister as to what she should\r\ndo. He told her to sit down at home and amuse herself reading, and\r\noccasionally engage in a strictly private benevolence. The time will\r\ncome when women will go forth to make a name and a fortune just as\r\nmen do to-day. Women are told that Christ died for them; she would\r\ntell them that Christ lived for them. He taught women a life of\r\nearnestness, and she bade them go forth and follow his example. She\r\ncompared the workingmen of Europe to our own mechanics--the bone\r\nand sinew of the land. “What makes the difference between them? It\r\nis the ballot. When tanners can aspire to be President you can see\r\nwhat the ballot can do. If it does so much for the men, it will do\r\nequally as much for the women. We want every incentive to make women\r\nbrave, wise, and good. Let us learn not to fight with guns, but with\r\nour tongues. The warfare is not ended until the ballot is in our\r\nhands. Vermont will give women the ballot before the year is out,\r\nand Connecticut will soon follow, for I have moved down there to\r\naccomplish it. Only a perfected womanhood will satisfy the age.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stillman, the only man in the Rhode Island legislature who dared\r\nto stand up for woman suffrage, came forward, but want of time\r\nprevents an account of his speech.\r\n\r\nPhœbe Couzins followed him after the same style of her first speech.\r\n\r\nAfter she had finished Professor Wilcox came forward as the last\r\ncrowning glory of the day and moved that Harriett Beecher Stowe, in\r\nher dire extremity, have the sympathy of the convention. Mrs. Stanton\r\nsaid it was out of order, and the Professor exhaled.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISABELLA BEECHER HOOKER.\r\n\r\nFITTING REPRESENTATIVE OF A DISTINGUISHED FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 20, 1870_.\r\n\r\nWednesday’s evening session opened with the usual brilliant array of\r\ndistinguished women on the stage. Among the number might have been\r\nseen Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker, of Connecticut, another candidate\r\nfor immortality in this family so widely known to fame. Mrs. Hooker\r\nis the beauty of the Beecher constellation. She has a dreamy, poetic\r\nface, like the picture of Mrs. Browning, and the early snow has\r\nbeen sprinkled among her curls. Mrs. Hooker is orthodox, and draws\r\ninspiration from the old Calvinistic doctrines undefiled. She appears\r\ntimid almost to awkwardness. She says she intends to be a “speaker,”\r\nand an assertion from a member of this family, like some kinds of\r\npaper, is worth more than its face.\r\n\r\nIn the obscurest place on the platform sits the genius of the\r\nconvention, Jennie Collins, the factory girl of New England, with her\r\nsad, hungry face. You can only remember the eyes, which look as if\r\nthere was something fierce and awful behind them ready to spring out\r\nand bite.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is called to order by Mrs. Stanton, and is followed by\r\na few of her well-chosen words. She had hoped to have a company of\r\ndistinguished Senators and members, but unfortunately the Congressmen\r\nwere all hoarse. Two Senators had sent their regrets. Senator Ross\r\npleaded prior engagements, but sent his sympathy. Senator Carpenter\r\nregretted that official duties prevented his coming, accompanied with\r\nthe usual condolence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton proceeded to enlighten the audience on the sixteenth\r\namendment, which is simply striking the obnoxious word “male” out of\r\nevery statute of the land. She said the future great memorable day\r\nwould occur in March, because it was in this month that Mr. Julian\r\nhad offered this amendment to the Constitution. In changing the\r\nfifteenth amendment the voice of every person should be heard in the\r\nland. If women are not people, what are they? We are building a model\r\nRepublic and it needs a crowning glory. That glory is a perfected\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony arose and proposed a vote. Those who demand that\r\nCongress shall adopt the sixteenth amendment say “aye.” The ayes had\r\nit. Miss Susan said she had been interviewing members, but did not\r\nstop to tell the result. She said there was a factory girl on the\r\nplatform, Miss Jennie Collins, of Boston. The movement was not to\r\nbenefit those who had fathers and husbands, but those who had to earn\r\ntheir own living.\r\n\r\nMiss Collins was then introduced. She said she had not come to make\r\na speech, but to lay her offering at the feet of the imperial Susan.\r\nWe have a class of women who have not brains enough to comprehend a\r\ncomic almanac; but if you would have an opinion, go to the working\r\nwoman. She who has toiled knows her opinion. Why do girls not go into\r\nthe kitchen? Because no man will marry a woman from the kitchen;\r\nbut if she goes behind the counter a man will give her his arm. She\r\nsaid the Republican party had accomplished its mission, and was now\r\ndead. A new party was coming up from the people. The trades unions\r\nwill be heard from. These unions were formed around camp-fires to\r\nprotect each other, and they now girdle the land. She did not look\r\nto the politicians for aid; it must come from the working people.\r\nWhat helped the workingman? It was the ballot. Then why would it not\r\nhelp the working women as well? If the Southerner had whipped the\r\nslave woman, the New England stockholder would not stop the loom\r\nlong enough to do the whipping. She painted the hideous lives of the\r\n48,000 factory girls of Massachusetts. Her presence breathed the\r\nprint of the nails. She made you hear the whir of the machinery, and\r\nyou could feel the flakes of cotton falling like snow. Miss Collins\r\nabused General Grant, abused the Republican party, but the audience\r\nwas under her spell and did not raise a dissenting voice. A young\r\ngirl in the audience spoke loud enough to be heard by those around\r\nher, “Isn’t she a frightful woman?” It was the savage looking out of\r\nthe New England factory prison, and the picture is the strongest that\r\nhas been presented in the convention.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then announced that the Senate District Committee had\r\nagreed to meet the leading women of the movement on Saturday at 10\r\no’clock a. m.\r\n\r\nThe meeting now adjourned, and the distinguished women proceeded\r\nto the Arlington Hotel, where they had previously announced their\r\nintention of holding a reception between the hours of 10 and 12 p. m.\r\nThis midnight reception was held to accommodate members and Senators\r\nwho were supposed to be disengaged during these hours. But, alas!\r\nSenators one appeared, Pomeroy, of Kansas, whilst the gallant General\r\nLogan was the sole representative of the House.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton was queenly, as usual, in black velvet; Mrs. Hooker\r\nin gray moire antique; whilst Mrs. Wilbour eclipsed all the lesser\r\nlights in black silk, embroidered with golden grain. Diamonds\r\nglittered, wit and satire flashed, illuminating all the beholders;\r\nbut the grand dames, the philosophers, the politicians of the\r\ncapital were not there. If the strong-minded can talk better than\r\nthe fashionables, they must yet learn to “receive.” Mrs. Hooker held\r\nup her moire train as if she were keeping it from the mire. But this\r\nmust have been owing to the neat training in the “land of steady\r\nhabits.” Mrs. Stanton “is at home” in the masculine way of doing\r\nbusiness. To be sure she had talked sense, but she made one long for\r\na little nonsense; for something upon which the mind could rest after\r\nthe severe tension of the day.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan was dressed in black pants, not very much the worse for\r\nwear, while a claret overcoat, bound in black silk braid, was thrown\r\nopen before. What his boots lacked in polish was made up by a mental\r\nlustre which such insignificant things as bootblacks can neither add\r\nto nor take away. He moved about hither and thither with as much\r\napparent ease as he intends to move the capital. Senator Pomeroy\r\nwore his ordinary apparel with the exception of his hair. Nellie\r\nHutchinson of the _Tribune_ said the reception was a failure, and the\r\nreaders of _The Press_ can take her word for it.\r\n\r\nMeeting called to order with very few on the stage. The usual prayer\r\nwas omitted. Mrs. Stanton opened the battle. Daughters should be\r\nprepared for every emergency. Cultivate will power, and everything\r\nelse yields. She said she had visited fashionable women in their\r\nluxurious homes and when she talked to them of these great questions,\r\nthey said they had been so happy they had never thought of these\r\nthings. She would say to these women, Do you live in Chinese walls?\r\nHave you never read Victor Hugo’s “Les Miserables”? What sort of a\r\nsoul must people have if they can only feel what sacrifices their own\r\nflesh? She then told the drunkard’s story, but she always finishes a\r\nconvention with the same tale. When Mrs. Stanton tells this personal\r\nexperience she rises to the dignity of a great actress. The pauses,\r\nthe gestures, one learns by heart. Do the great and good men of the\r\nworld repeat themselves in the same way?\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony having somewhat recovered, read a letter from Hon. Jacob\r\nH. Ela, of New Hampshire, and he assured the convention that he was\r\nwith it hand and glove. During the evening a few members and Senator\r\nSherman were espied in the audience. Miss Anthony was interrupted\r\nin her speaking, and Senator Sherman was called on by name to come\r\nforward and answer how he stood on the sixteenth amendment. As he did\r\nnot seem inclined to give an opinion, Miss Anthony bade him, unless\r\nhe was for it, to say nothing at all.\r\n\r\nJudge Woodward (Democrat) was also seen, and his name was called\r\nout, but he arose from his seat and went quietly out. With the\r\nencroachment upon good taste (for certainly Congressmen have some\r\nrights which the public should respect) the convention has lived its\r\nbrief life, and left its mark upon the age.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING OF THE STRONG-MINDED.\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN SUFFRAGISTS TELL OF THEIR TRIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 21, 1870_.\r\n\r\nThe last evening’s session of the woman’s suffrage convention opened\r\nunder the most dazzling auspices. No movement of the kind at the\r\nnational capital has ever been so honored before. Quite a strong\r\nsolution of intellect, power, and fashion shaded its eyes before\r\nthe meteoric display. For the first time in convention, respectable\r\naudiences have seen spiritualism, long-haired masculine, and\r\npantaloon feminine banished from the stage. Just as a flame flashes\r\nup more brilliantly before it expires, the convention assumed a\r\nvermillion hue before its final dissolution.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton appeared clad in solemn black velvet, but the bright\r\nribbons nestling in her snowy curls, the girlish ornaments in exactly\r\nthe right place, strangled all thoughts of a funereal aspect.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilbour glimmered in the black silk of golden wheat memory, and\r\nMrs. Beecher was clad in royal purple; Phœbe Couzins smothered her\r\nmanifold attractions under a great white opera cloak, and Susan B.\r\nAnthony was just as twisted and knotty as ever.\r\n\r\nBut whilst the beautiful feminine element which Mrs. Wilbour has so\r\nfaithfully portrayed formed the background of the picture, the great\r\ncentral form of attraction was Professor Wilcox, otherwise known in\r\nthe capital as “the Knight of the Sorrowful Figure.” A description\r\nof his person, as he corruscated upon the stage, is copied from\r\nthe Washington _Chronicle_: “Professor Wilcox appeared upon the\r\nscene in wrappings of swallow-tail and patent leather. His polished\r\nfoundation was only eclipsed by the manifold attractions of the\r\nother extremity. His whiskers were trimmed to an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees, whilst his superb eyes rested in serene beneficence upon the\r\nfeminine elements that surged and rolled in grandeur on the stage.”\r\n\r\nAs the women were detained at home for the arrangement of their\r\ntoilettes beyond the hour appointed, Professor Wilcox moved that Mrs.\r\nGriffing address the meeting. This most estimable woman proposed\r\na substitute in the person of Madame Anneke, who came forward and\r\nsaid she could not talk, only “wid her heart.” She could not speak\r\nEnglish. “All my friends I embrace.” This last sentence must have\r\nbeen a metaphor, for although Professor Wilcox was in grappling\r\ndistance, nothing occurred which could shock the most delicate mind.\r\nMadame Anneke said that it had been told that Germany was not in\r\nfavor of this movement. This was a mistake. Germany was with us; all\r\nEurope too. Twenty years ago she had started a paper to advocate\r\nthe cause, but it stopped in two years because of her sickness. One\r\nhundred years ago a German philosopher said that women should have\r\nequal rights with men. A hundred years ago a good man had said the\r\nsame things which these women were telling the people to-day. But she\r\ncould say no more, she was going to act.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton then came forward and said Madame Anneke was going\r\nto travel all through the West for the “cause,” and this was what\r\nshe meant by the word act. If Madame Anneke can not talk English\r\nto Western barbarians, she can make up by acting on the stage. Her\r\nimmense rotundity, quivering like a huge caldron of jelly, will stir\r\nthe human heart to its profoundest depths, and it can safely be said\r\nby a Western woman who knows the taste of the home community that\r\nMadame Anneke will be able to attract audiences.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. May now came forward. He said that our late civil war was\r\nbrought on by the deprivation of the rights of four millions of the\r\npeople, and consequently certain things will follow like a natural\r\nlaw, the taking away of the rights of fifteen millions more. Woman\r\ncannot be denied her rights. She cannot be degraded without degrading\r\nthe other half of creation. God made man dual. How absurd for man to\r\nassume the right to all power; to take all power into his hands. Why\r\ndo not women take all the power to themselves? It would be just as\r\nreasonable. Barbarians subject the weak to the strong.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony now came forward and wanted to have a resolution\r\nintroduced into Congress to equalize wages. The motion was put and\r\ncarried with the exception of one male voice. Here was a chance for\r\nSusan to score the Adam, and the opportunity was not lost. No eagle\r\nfrom his eyrie ever pounced upon a chicken with more force than did\r\nSusan upon this masculine biped. Nobody knew whether the unfortunate\r\nhad a wife, but Susan assumed that he had, and that it was his intent\r\nand purpose to sneak away her wages. Susan finished him on the spot,\r\nand the audience applauded the heroic act.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton then rose and said a woman had just visited her who was\r\nconnected with the Washington public schools. For a long time she had\r\ntried to get her wages; that she was in debt, with all its attendant\r\nevils; that she had applied time after time for her dues, but they\r\nwere withheld, but that a school trustee had put his hand in his\r\npocket and offered the teacher forty dollars instead of forty-five,\r\nthe amount due. She instanced this as an atrocious advantage taken\r\nof a helpless woman. As she took her seat a man in a distant part of\r\nthe hall arose for an explanation. He painted the awful picture of\r\na depleted city treasury, of the inability of the school committee\r\nto get blood out of a stone, and thought the man did a most generous\r\nact to give the woman forty dollars and wait indefinitely for the\r\nforty-five. He said the man was touched by her necessities, and no\r\ndoubt cramped himself to do a good act, for the school committee are\r\npoor men.\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Mr. May again came forward to bring forth some\r\nmental gem that in his former speech had been forgotten. He wanted\r\nto say something about woman as an inventor. A woman had invented\r\nthe cotton-gin, but in this case she had been maliciously deprived\r\nof her rights. The audience listened patiently and his last talk\r\ncame to an end. Then Mrs. Charlotte Wilbour took the stand and read\r\none of her sleepy essays. But she made rather a handsome figure with\r\nthe gaslight dancing on the golden sheaves that bespangled her royal\r\ndrapery. Her costly fan was suspended from her waist by a heavy gold\r\nchain, and this, with the length of her long train, made her look\r\nanything else but “strong-minded.”\r\n\r\nWhen her essay came to an end, Mr. May arose for an explanation, but\r\nthe decorous, good humored audience had swallowed enough of Mr. May,\r\nand its stomach actually refused any more of the decoction. Stamp!\r\nStamp! Stamp! Motherly Mrs. Stanton came forward and said, “Be a good\r\nchild. Take it down; take it for the sake of free speech.” Mr. May\r\nbegan. Hissing, stamping. Again Mrs. Stanton’s sweet face beams on\r\nthe audience and says, “Why will ye?”\r\n\r\nMr. May began and said: “I shall stand here until you hear me, if\r\nstay till to-morrow morning.” Determination was written on that face,\r\nwith the broad lower jaw and mouth, which sprung together like the\r\nshutting of a steel trap. His arms were folded, and his whole person\r\nbreathed the spirit of the Egyptian sphinx. The audience felt the\r\npresence of its master, and yielded as good naturedly as it began the\r\nbattle. Mr. May told us something about a State’s prison, where there\r\nwere nothing but female convicts and female officers, but whether\r\nthis model prison is in his own State of New York or elsewhere\r\nescaped the ear of the writer, but it is safe to say if it is not in\r\nNew York it certainly ought to be there.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony now came forward and told a good story, a noble one,\r\nabout Olympia Brown. Four months Olympia traveled in Kansas in\r\nevery way except by railroad. She spoke every day of the four\r\nmonths, and oftener twice than otherwise. Generally she had met the\r\nkindest treatment, but sometimes not, for in every audience there is\r\ngenerally a fringe of humanity where there is more boot-heel than\r\nbrain. There was one district in Kansas where intelligent people\r\nlived, where for years they were unable to get a schoolhouse. They\r\ncould get no majority to vote upon the question, because the claims\r\nin the town were owned by single men, who did not want to vote to\r\nbe taxed, or else by non-residents who were never there to give a\r\ndecision one way or another. The father worked on year after year,\r\nbut all in vain. After the passage of the law giving woman the right\r\nto vote on the school question, the mothers arose at 11 o’clock at\r\nnight, voted, and got a schoolhouse. Why the women should be obliged\r\nto arise at 11 o’clock at night to vote, instead of waiting until\r\na respectable hour in the morning, Susan forgot to mention. Miss\r\nAnthony said once upon a time she was announced to speak in Brooklyn,\r\nat the same time with Miss Anna Dickinson. Just as she had changed\r\nher frock, and got ready for starting, the fickle Anna telegraphed\r\nthat she could not be there. There was no time to prepare for this\r\nunforeseen catastrophe, so she put on her bonnet and went over to\r\nBrooklyn--went into the vast hall, crowded with humanity, who had\r\ncome to see Anna, not her. Had the heavens opened and buckets of\r\nice-water been showered down upon her head she could have felt no\r\nworse. She looked around and there sat Henry Ward Beecher, and\r\nChapin, and a host of intellectual lights, which were enough to cook\r\nany woman’s marrow to the bones, and she was as bare of thought as\r\nNew York is of honesty. She applied a forcing pump to her mind, but\r\nstill the water of thought wouldn’t come; her brain was as dry as a\r\nsqueezed orange. What should she do? She looked around on the hungry\r\naudience, and at last her eyes rested on Henry Ward Beecher, and she\r\nfelt saved. Leaving her place on the platform, she advanced to the\r\ngreat preacher, and, laying her hand on his shoulder she said, “You\r\nmust help me; I can’t do it.” Susan did not tell us whether it was\r\nowing to her command or the pressure which she brought to bear on his\r\nshoulder that conquered him. At any rate, he came gallantly to her\r\nside; and never was such a rousing speech made by the great parson in\r\nall the days of his life. Then she said, “What did I tell this story\r\nfor? Something I am sure! Let me see. Oh, yes! I wanted to prove\r\nthat men and women needed to work together side by side. When one\r\nfails, the other can come to the rescue.” At this moment Susan gave\r\nevidence of having touched the bottom of her remarkable strength and\r\nvitality. The unmitigated drain upon her vital forces for three days\r\nof convention seemed to have done its work. Any other woman would\r\nhave fainted, but not Susan. She only said, “I think I’ll sit down.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton came forward and said she wanted to talk an hour to the\r\nyoung ladies about health and strength. Napoleon could not make a\r\nsoldier of a sick man. If girls are left with white hands and poverty\r\nan inheritance, as it often is when they are orphaned, the sin of it\r\nlies at the parents’ door. Educate women for ministers, and there\r\nwill be better theology preached. Let them study the law. Would it\r\nbring them more into notice than the public ball? There is no place\r\nwhere there are such temptations as in fashionable life, for nowhere\r\nare such sensuous men found. If marriage is contemplated, it is\r\nnot thought whether a man has character but whether he has wealth.\r\nShe said she had an interest in the perpetuity of the American\r\nConstitution. Women will never respect themselves, but will be ground\r\ndown until they learn self-support. She had personal knowledge of\r\nmany girls who wanted to do something for themselves, but the fathers\r\nstood by, saying, “Degrade women to go to the polls?” If a woman is\r\nso rash as to marry a man, should she be afraid to go by his side to\r\nthe ballot-box? She had six men in her family, and, excepting the\r\ntobacco, she found them very endurable. She thought men and women\r\nought to be together in every movement. A drunken man will try to\r\nact sober when women are around. Conversation is never so good when\r\nmen are alone; nor is it so elevating among women as when a few\r\nphilosophers or well-informed men are present.\r\n\r\nSenator Wilson arrives and is lustily cheered. He ascends the\r\nplatform and shakes hands with his personal friends. He said he did\r\nnot come to address an argument to this meeting; he did not come to\r\nadd his faith to the creed to be promulgated. Whenever he had a vote\r\nto give to any practical measure which should benefit this country it\r\nshould be given to men and women alike. But he came there to redeem\r\na promise to Miss Anthony, who really would not let him say “no.”\r\n“But I am with you. For the last thirty-four years I have tried,\r\nin private and in public, to emancipate a race. The work is done.\r\nComplete political equality is nearly accomplished; and what little\r\ntime may be allotted me I shall still go on with the work which has\r\ngiven four and a half millions freedom. I am with you in sentiment,\r\nfeeling, and all which relates to the work.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton having perceived several Congressmen in the hall,\r\ninvites them to the platform. They do not choose to come. Senator\r\nTipton is called by name, and rises and begs to be excused, and Mrs.\r\nStanton shows her weakness by excusing him.\r\n\r\nRachel Townsend, the Quakeress, takes the platform, and scores the\r\nfactory girl for her effective speech of the evening before. She says\r\nshe has a good word to say for Congress; a good word for President\r\nGrant, who has taken the colored man by the hand and raised him to a\r\nplace he never occupied before. He had placed the despised Quakers\r\nover the Indians and the Quakers had done what powder and bullets had\r\nfailed to do. Quaker women were amongst the Indians, Christianizing\r\nthem as much as the other sex.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jocelyn Gage was then introduced by a handsome preamble, in Mrs.\r\nStanton’s own style. She said Mrs. Gage was author of a pamphlet upon\r\n“Woman as an Inventor,” and that the pamphlet went to prove that\r\nwomen originated the cotton-gin. Mrs. Gage, however, did not tell the\r\naudience any new facts about woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe majestic, most queenly Pauline Davis criticised Senator Wilson\r\nbecause he had spoken of the black men and said nothing about the\r\nblack women.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then offered a resolution on the sixteenth amendment,\r\nand made just such a speech as only Susan can. She demanded that\r\nCongress submit the amendment. She commanded the Judiciary Committee\r\nof the District to present the bill before the House, and that it be\r\ndone quickly. She wanted something practical to work on. She said\r\nthere were black men so ignorant that when they went to the polls\r\nthey expected to have a mule given them at the same time. “Do you\r\nsuppose such women as Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Wright, and\r\nothers--I’ll say myself; yes, I’ll say we--have suffered hooting,\r\ndegradation, persecution, everything for all these years, and not\r\naccomplish what we have to do!” Vesuvius could be painted more easily\r\nthan Susan at this supreme moment. What is this invisible force?\r\nHeads were bowed until the whirlwind swept by. Susan went up like a\r\nrocket but came down like a stick, but it did not hurt her. She said\r\nshe was tired of harping on one string. She looked so weary. Oh! that\r\nSusan had a place softer than a pillow on which to lay that tired\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThere is no time to tell all the strong words this woman said,\r\nbecause it must be told that Mrs. Beecher Hooker tried to speak and\r\nfailed. Alas! for the Beechers. She said that Christ had come to\r\ndeliver woman. She had entered into this movement because undefiled,\r\npure religion was to be found there, I assure you. Few of us know the\r\nburden which Christianity brings. Let us take hold and work together.\r\nAt this moment she said so many earnest faces gazing at her made it\r\nimpossible to go on, and she withdrew her beautiful face, suffused\r\nwith the pure Beecher blood, the sweetest picture the family has had\r\nthe honor to present for many days.\r\n\r\nMiss Olympia Brown came to the rescue. It was like shifting a\r\npanorama; Olympia is beyond criticism in some respects. Her face\r\nglows with enthusiasm; she talks because she is in earnest, and\r\nnot for effect. She was followed by Miss Couzins, who could not be\r\ncompared with Olympia, and yet the former won the applause. But\r\nmen’s boots were heard in the uproar. Phœbe is pretty, and the rest\r\nfollowed. The hall was crowded with the best and strongest audience\r\nthat ever greeted the woman suffrage movement in Washington.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT A COMMITTEE HEARING.\r\n\r\nTHE LADIES PLEAD THEIR CAUSE AT THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 22, 1870_.\r\n\r\nAt a proper fashionable hour this morning the women delegates began\r\nslowly to gather in the moderately sized room occupied by the Senate\r\nCommittee on the District of Columbia. Last of all came the most\r\nprominent delegates. Mrs. Stanton went to a side table and laid down\r\nher dainty little bonnet and shook out her curls. Then she took her\r\nseat at the head of the table. Susan B. stood next, then Mrs. Beecher\r\nHooker, Pauline Davis, Josephine Griffing, Phœbe Couzins and Mrs.\r\nWright. The usual buzz of conversation was carried on whisperingly,\r\nfor the dignity of the Senate chamber extended to that floor. The\r\nsmall audience was of the most exclusive and aristocratic kind. The\r\nfactory girl had been sent off North early in the morning, lest her\r\nroar should alarm the Congressional doves. In the awful stillness\r\nmight have been seen wall flowers, to whose fragrance a whole nation\r\ncan testify. Grace Greenwood was there, in a lovely winter costume;\r\nbut there is no time to describe the attractive beauties of the scene.\r\n\r\nAfter a little Senators Hamlin, Patterson, Pratt, and other gentlemen\r\nconnected with the committee came in, and a general introduction and\r\nhandshaking took place. The committee of the Senate were arranged on\r\none side of the long table, and the House committee on the other,\r\nwhilst the head of it was left for each woman who should make her\r\nspeech. The solemn occasion was opened, as usual, by Mrs. Stanton.\r\n\r\nSenator Hamlin, who sat at the head of the Senate committee, and\r\nconsequently at the speaker’s right hand, turned his ear in a calm\r\nand patient attitude, with a suppressed merry twinkling of the eye\r\naltogether incompatible with the hour. Senator Pratt, of Indiana,\r\nlaid his head on the back of his chair, rolled his eyes heavenward,\r\nand looked as if he felt his genuine modesty more than ever. Mr.\r\nRice, of Arkansas, sat holding his chin, apparently fearful that\r\nunless taken just the right kind of care of it might drop down,\r\nleaving the floor open with all sorts of consequences. Judge Cook,\r\nof Illinois, folded his hands over his breast, seemingly as resigned\r\nas if for the last time, whilst Judge Welker, of Ohio, looked just\r\nas if he wanted to say “boo to a goose.” Just before Mrs. Stanton\r\nbegan Senator Hamlin read two petitions--the first signed by some\r\nof the women of the District, praying that suffrage be extended to\r\nthem, and another from Massachusetts, of the same purport. After he\r\nhad finished he calmly sat down, and told the women he was prepared,\r\nwith the other gentlemen, to hear what they had to say. Mrs. Stanton\r\ncame to time as usual, and began the story which all thoughtful\r\npersons have by heart who have heard her three times. She read it,\r\nhowever, and one sitting by her side could see slips of paper cut\r\nfrom newspapers pasted between portions of the manuscript, and it\r\nwas said these slips were taken from the time of the Revolution.\r\nThe essay began about eternal principles. That it was best to do\r\nright, and leave the rest to God. That Congress should legislate\r\nfor equality. The Republican party had put the word “male” into the\r\nFederal Constitution. The States had the right to regulate, but not\r\nto prohibit suffrage. It is despotism of the most odious kind to\r\nprevent woman from the exercise of those powers which God has given\r\nher. She said there was a proposition before Congress to change the\r\nwhole code of laws which govern the District of Columbia; and when\r\nthis was done the only way to regenerate and purify the spot was to\r\nremove disabilities, and let all vote--male and female, black and\r\nwhite. She wanted this mooted question of suffrage ended. She went\r\nover the ground of the late war, and said that woman had not been\r\na disinterested observer for the last hundred years; that she came\r\nover in the Mayflower, side by side with man in the old Revolution;\r\nand can woman now stand silent and see the selling of her birthright\r\nof liberty? The emancipated serfs of Russia were clamoring for more\r\nliberty, and they would get it, too. Do you intend to stand by these\r\nold landmarks, instead of advancing with a newer civilization?\r\nMrs. Stanton then proposed for the committee to ask any questions\r\nwhich they might think proper to do. An ominous silence followed.\r\nMrs. Stanton then said she did not choose to be represented by John\r\nMorrissey and two men in the New York legislature who could neither\r\nread nor write. Laws have been changing at woman’s instigation for\r\nthe last thirty years, which proves that woman knows what is good for\r\nher. We are obliged to build sidewalks and other improvements and\r\nhave we not a right to say how our money shall be expended? You have\r\nseen dogs in the street quarreling over a bone; if you throw them two\r\nbones the quarrel is over. The “drunken scene” was left out, like\r\neverything else which in a way could have a personal application.\r\n\r\nAfter some more talk Mrs. Stanton sat down, and Susan B.--bless\r\nher heart!--faced the Congressional guns. The great pumping power\r\nwhich this woman carries in her brain had lifted the blood into her\r\ncheeks, and her eyes blazed with the fire of early day. Lilac kid\r\ngloves covered her kind, strong hands and it was astonishing to us\r\nall to see how much she looked like a woman. She put her hands behind\r\nher as if it was best to have them in a safe place, and commenced\r\nby telling the gentlemen that they had it in their power to strike\r\nthe word “male” out of the Constitution. (Susan has a way of saying\r\nthe word “male” so that it sounds like the snapping of small arms.)\r\nIn the District the experiment was tried of giving colored men\r\ntheir rights, and it seems as if this is a fitting place for the\r\ninauguration of a grander experiment--that of doing for the woman\r\nwhat you did for the negro. It is only a long custom which you hate\r\nto break.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton now prompted Susan to speak of Kansas. She then told the\r\nstory of the schoolhouse, and it was ascertained that the reason why\r\nthe women had to rise at 11 o’clock at night to vote was because the\r\nmen had determined to settle the question that day. The men wrangled\r\nand could not come to a conclusion, so the women were called as the\r\nlast feather to break the camel’s back.\r\n\r\nA little time before Senator Sumner had come in and taken a seat at\r\nthe foot of the table. Susan now asked the Senator a question, and\r\nforgot and called him “Mr. Sumner,” just as if he was like other\r\nmen. But she was called to order by Mrs. Stanton, and made haste to\r\nrepair the wrong by begging his pardon and saying “Senator” with a\r\nsnap to it. She asked the Senator how it worked in Massachusetts by\r\nhaving women vote on the school question. The Senator said it worked\r\nwell. As there seemed no chance for an argument, she paused for fresh\r\ninspiration, but she was interrupted by Phœbe Couzins, and prompted\r\nto say something she had already said.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were parleying, Mrs. Pauline Davis took the floor and\r\nsaid a few words in a voice too low to be heard except by those at\r\nthe table. Before Miss Anthony sat down, Mrs. Beecher Hooker touched\r\nher by the arm and begged her not to be too severe. Susan said she\r\ndid not mean to be severe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker then took her seat at the head of the table, as her\r\nmodesty would not let her stand up before this august tribunal.\r\nMrs. Hooker leaned over the table and made the daintiest kind of a\r\npicture. Senator Hamlin straightened himself up and pulled down his\r\nvest. Senator Pratt opened his sleepy eyes to the widest extent, and\r\nSenator Sumner gave his undivided attention. Mrs. Hooker said that\r\nwoman looked to the Government for her rights. “I assure you, Christ\r\nuses the word thou shalt do this, and thou shalt do that, which means\r\nto apply to women quite as much as to men. The Bible says, ‘Honor thy\r\nfather and mother, and thy days shall be long in the land.’ How can\r\na son honor his mother when he chooses to use his young thoughts to\r\nlegislate for her whilst he is so much younger than she is. It cannot\r\nbe right.” She did not believe so much in woman’s rights as woman’s\r\nduty. At this moment her voice stole away from her like the dying\r\nnotes of a swan, and she removed to another seat, her white forehead\r\nbedewed with perspiration.\r\n\r\nMadame Anneke was now introduced, and commenced by saying: “Honorary\r\nSirs: Perhaps you will be kind enough to listen to my poor talk. I\r\ncome delegate from Wisconsin; from oder places too. You have lifted\r\nup the slaves, shentlemen, you hear t’ousand and t’ousand voices.\r\nIn Europe you hear the cry, help us, gentlemens, and den we help\r\nourselves.” After some more such logic, Madame Anneke ponderously\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nSenator Patterson now modestly proposed a question: Suppose a\r\ndifference of opinion should arise in the family, what will prevent\r\nthe mischief of discord?\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton, who had the cunning answer already to spring upon him,\r\nsaid there is already discord there. “I do not think this can make\r\nany more. There is always the superior mind in every family. If it\r\nbelongs to the man, he decides it; if to the woman, she does the\r\nsame. The smallest men are most tenacious of their rights.” Senator\r\nPatterson, seemingly afraid to be classed in this category, closed\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nJudge Cook now asked, “What evidence have you that the great body of\r\nwomen in the country want to vote?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton replied that in New York, where she had scattered tracts\r\nand otherwise labored, she had been rewarded with petitions signed by\r\n20,000 women.\r\n\r\nJudge Welker then asked, “How large a number want to vote in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton said they had just closed a convention attended by\r\nfifteen hundred persons who were enthusiastic on the subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. Davis then said: “People are tired of asking for this thing and\r\nthat thing. It is time that legislators knew their business without\r\nbeing petitioned.”\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then reiterated the glories of the late convention, and\r\nwent off into one of those spasmodic efforts practically impossible\r\nto any one but Susan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beecher again cautioned her, and told her not to forget the\r\nplace where she was. This brought Susan to terra firma.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gage then said she held a petition in her hand, signed by 3,000\r\npeople, but no one seemed inclined to take it away from her, and she\r\nquietly sat down.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Hannibal Hamlin then arose to correct Mrs. Stanton\r\nin what she had said about changing the laws for the District of\r\nColumbia; that no such bill was before the committee to which Mrs.\r\nStanton had alluded. There was a bill, but it was unlike the one\r\nreported in the newspapers. The District of Columbia was governed\r\nby laws made a hundred years ago, and the age had outgrown them. He\r\nbelieved they should be modified, and he advocated the change to be\r\nmade by the citizens, subject to the will of Congress. He only spoke\r\nfor himself and not for his associates.\r\n\r\nJudge Cook, of Illinois, chairman of the committee of the House,\r\nsaid that Congress was no place to bring up such a great question.\r\nThere is too much to do here already. We have no time--absolutely\r\nno time--for the consideration of the subject. At the same time he\r\nseemed to be looking about for a hole to escape.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker said that time should be made for such a subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton said, “Present the sixteenth amendment.”\r\n\r\nHonorable Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, chairman of the Senate\r\nCommittee, said, “We will take this question into consideration. When\r\nSaul went up into Damascus he said unto Paul, ‘I am almost persuaded\r\nto become a Christian.’” The reporters’ table was illuminated by\r\nsmiles, and one man was malicious enough to say a little Scripture\r\nreading would do the Senator good, for he meant Agrippa instead of\r\nSaul. Another answered that the Senator was figuratively speaking,\r\nand he might as well use one name as another.\r\n\r\nThe council was broken by the Congressional lions going stealthily\r\naway, but before they all had a chance to get out, Susan buttonholed\r\ntwo or three. “Sixteenth amendment” was distilled from her lips like\r\nhoney from flowers. Senator Sumner came around genial as a summer’s\r\nsun, yet it was noticed that during the whole ordeal he never opened\r\nhis lips, but endured all with the resignation of martyrdom. And thus\r\nthe meeting of the Amazon warriors passed away.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONORING THE PRINCE.\r\n\r\nRECEPTION TO THE VISITING SCION OF ROYALTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 26, 1870_.\r\n\r\nIn the very heart of the fashionable quarter of the capital may be\r\nseen a most unpretending two-story-and-a-half house, in the usual\r\nAmerican imitation of brown stone. A modest bay window keeps steady\r\ncompany with a classic little porch at the front entrance of the\r\nmansion. As you enter the building you find yourself in a moderately\r\nsized hall, and if you turn to the left you are ushered into a\r\ndrawing-room, octagonal in shape, and you perceive the vista opening\r\nto another of the same shape and size, leading to the third, which\r\ncompletes the suite of apartments thrown open at the entertainment\r\nof guests. These parlors are not extravagantly furnished. The walls\r\nare not covered with costly pictures; yet this establishment at\r\npresent is the cynosure of all eyes, because a prince of the royal\r\nblood of England finds shelter under its hospitable roof. The ugly\r\ntruth must be told. Great Britain does not consider the United\r\nStates a first-class mission, and she does not furnish her minister\r\nresident with a palace and et ceteras to match, as in Paris and other\r\ncontinental cities. But England does honor our Republic by sending\r\nMr. Thornton to represent her, one of nature’s noblemen, and plain\r\nMrs. Thornton, without a drop of blue blood in her veins. So Victoria\r\nhas sent her good-natured boy amongst us, and the wife of England’s\r\nminister is doing the handsome part by her guest.\r\n\r\nFor reasons already mentioned no very large entertainment can be\r\ngiven at the English embassy. A dinner party was given on Monday\r\nevening, at which were present the Cabinet and a portion of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, as well as General Sherman and Senator Sumner.\r\nDifferent sets of invitations were issued; or in other words, each\r\nwoman’s card was a separate affair from her husband’s. Only gentlemen\r\nwere entertained at dinner--the ladies came afterwards to the\r\nreception, which began at half past nine in the evening. Each woman\r\ninvited to the residence of the English minister to honor the Prince\r\nreceived a special card from Mrs. Thornton.\r\n\r\nThe dinner passed away like other dinners when gentlemen have it all\r\ntheir own way; but the reception was as brilliant as the presence of\r\nbeautiful and accomplished women could make it. The guests were first\r\nintroduced to Mrs. and Mr. Thornton, and they in turn presented them\r\nto their prince. Mrs. Thornton’s eyes sparkled as only an English\r\nwoman’s can with the son of her sovereign beside her.\r\n\r\nPrince Arthur is a medium sized youth, who has just reached the\r\ndoor-sill of adolescence. A soft yellowish down occupies the place\r\nwhere whiskers are intended to grow, and his thoroughly English face\r\nhas the peachy bloom which distinguishes the gentry of that famous\r\nisland. He bears a strong resemblance to the Prince of Wales, but\r\nwith indications of more force of character. His hands are as pink as\r\na sea shell, and anything else but aristocratic. At the reception he\r\nwas dressed in a suit of black cloth, high standing collar, handsome\r\ncravat, and polished patent leathers. Three emerald studs adorned\r\nhis faultless shirt front, and a sprig of violets dangled from a\r\nbutton-hole. He wore no gloves, but gave his bare, pink palms for an\r\ninstant to the keeping of American citizens. He was so kind, plain,\r\nand straightforward, that everybody forgave him for being a prince.\r\n\r\nAfter all had been introduced to the young lion, and many little\r\npleasant wisps of conversation had floated away, the company\r\nproceeded to the dining-room, where ices, fruits, and wines regaled\r\nthe guests. Mrs. Thornton and Baron Gerolt, the Prussian minister,\r\nled the way, followed by the Prince and Mrs. Fish, Minister Thornton\r\nand the Baroness Gerolt, Secretary Fish and Mrs. Belknap, Secretary\r\nBelknap and Mrs. Creswell, Chief Justice Chase and Madame Catacazy,\r\nthe wife of the Russian minister, and the most beautiful woman\r\nbelonging to the foreign legations; Mr. Robeson, the bachelor\r\nSecretary, and Philadelphia’s handsome Madame Potestael, and a host\r\nof other lights distinguished in the political and fashionable\r\nworld. The tables were elegantly decorated with flowers, while the\r\nvintage at the English minister’s is celebrated above all others in\r\nWashington. Conversation was varied by excellent music, contributed\r\nby the voice of Madame Garcia, of the Argentine Republic, assisted by\r\nBlacque Bey, the Turkish minister, who also took a prominent part in\r\nthe evening’s entertainment.\r\n\r\nAmong the guests were noticed General and Mrs. Tete, the new minister\r\nfrom Hayti. These members of the diplomatic corps are of mixed blood,\r\nthe African largely predominant. Mrs. Tete was dressed in a claret\r\ncolored silk, high in the neck, long sleeves, and without ornaments.\r\nShe has unassuming manners, though exceedingly courteous and high\r\nbred. She remarked to one of the company that she did not know how\r\nshe would be received in society in Washington, but so far she had\r\nmet with nothing but kindness. This evening in particular, she was\r\nmade to feel at home.\r\n\r\nThough the newspapers sparkle with descriptions of a dinner given\r\nat the White House in honor of Prince Arthur, there was no such\r\nentertainment. The state dinner which takes place every Wednesday at\r\nthe Executive Mansion occurred as usual, and Prince Arthur happening\r\nto be sojourning temporarily in Washington, whilst on his youthful\r\ntravels, our plain President simply laid an extra plate for his\r\nunexpected guest--unexpected, because all the other guests were\r\ninvited before the Prince reached the city, and these guests received\r\nno notice that Victoria’s son would be among them, and consequently\r\ncould not feel that they had been selected to meet royalty. Only\r\nthirty-six persons can be seated in the dining-room of the White\r\nHouse, therefore a “royal” entertainment is reserved for a future\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject of entertaining the Prince was mentioned before our\r\nPresident, he simply said: “I think if Ulysses was in London he would\r\nbe lucky if he got any dinner at Windsor Castle at all.” Whether\r\nit was owing to that sly strategy which put down the rebellion, or\r\nother causes equally potent, it did happen that some of the most\r\nsensible women in the nation were invited guests at this particular\r\nstate dinner. These women, these wives of members of Congress, are\r\nnot known to the fashionable world; they dare to live within their\r\nhusband’s means, and have been known to appear at a full dress\r\nreception in plain black silk dress, and without the usual quantity\r\nof false hair. In the veins of such women runs the blue blood of the\r\nRepublic, and their presence is as sweet as violets.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Prince Arthur in Washington has created very little\r\nexcitement, probably for the reason that every boy knows that he has\r\na far better chance of being President than the royal scion has of\r\nbeing king.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEVEE AT THE EXECUTIVE MANSION.\r\n\r\nCABINET LADIES TAKE PART IN ASSISTING MRS. GRANT\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 5, 1870_.\r\n\r\nA stranger attending a Presidential levee for the first time at the\r\ncapital has an opportunity to drain the cup of Washington society\r\nto its very dregs. Card receptions, such as are held at the homes\r\nof the Cabinet, Chief Justice Chase, and General Sherman, in a\r\ncertain sense are veiled under the sacred seal of hospitality, and\r\nthe newspaper correspondent dare not, cannot, without violating all\r\ndelicacy and good taste, make a pen picture of the men and women whom\r\nthe dear people at home like to know all about. A Presidential levee\r\nis altogether a different affair. It is public. It belongs to the\r\npeople. When we go to the Executive Mansion we go to our own house.\r\nOur sacred feet press our own tufted Wiltons. We recline on our own\r\nsatin and ebony. We are received graciously by our own well-dressed\r\nservants, and the people have a right to know, through the columns\r\nof _The Press_, the exact state of the situation. Whoever goes to a\r\nlevee at the mansion becomes public property, and has no more right\r\nto complain because he has been caught in the net of a newspaper\r\ncorrespondent than the fish who has swallowed the hook of an honest\r\nfisherman. The time has been when a levee at the White House was\r\nlike a social gathering in a modest village. The President not only\r\nshook hands with his guest, but also asked him to take a chair and\r\ninquired about the state of the crops “Down East.” The most precious\r\nrepublican simplicity has taken its departure with the Jeffersons\r\nand the Madisons; or rather it has necessarily been cast off with\r\nall the other swaddling-clothes of an infant Republic. A perfect\r\nriver of human life pours through the Executive Mansion. Human beings\r\nare packed together just as solid as sardines in a box, whilst the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Grant are obliged to take each separate atom by\r\nthe hand. After two hours of this kind of work, its ravage begins to\r\nshow its effect upon the person of the Chief Magistrate. His eyes\r\nbegin to have a far-off look, great drops of perspiration stand on\r\nhis forehead, and his thin, quivering nostrils rise and sink, like\r\nthe gills of a darling dolphin when taken out of the water. Sometimes\r\nthe President gasps; but this is usually thought to be a handsomely\r\nsuppressed yawn, and no matter how much he may desire to bring in his\r\nsuperb knowledge of military tactics, so far as it is known he has\r\nnever been guilty of a flank movement; he has only appeared as if he\r\nwould like to shoulder arms.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant stands a little way from the President--“fair, fat and\r\nforty.” She appears in grace and manner just as any other sensible\r\nwoman would who had been lifted from the ranks of the people to such\r\nan exalted position. It is true she shows the people her comely neck\r\nand shoulders, and, notwithstanding the wintry weather, makes no\r\nattempt to cover her shapely arms; but her gracious condescension is\r\nappreciated, and the exhibition is free to all.\r\n\r\nWho are the people who file past the President? Titled men and women\r\nof foreign countries; a large part of the community which romance\r\nwould call the “republican court;” and the mighty power sometimes\r\ncalled the sovereign people. Now it happens, as the stream flows\r\nonward through the Executive rooms, that particles of humanity are\r\nlodged in the same apartments that are honored with the presence of\r\nthe President and his wife.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished guests remain permanently in the room of\r\npower. The picture is made up of the Presidential party in the\r\nforeground, and back of them stand the Army, Navy, and Cabinet, as\r\nwell as the Vice-President of the United States. Of all the public\r\nmen in the nation few or none stand so near the national heart as\r\nSchuyler Colfax, and the reason assigned is because he has got a mind\r\nlike an elephant’s trunk. It picks up anything, from the largest man\r\nto the smallest woman, and his heart is big enough to give them all\r\nstanding room. If he is introduced to a manufacturer he knows what\r\nkind of articles the man sends to market. If a literary woman is\r\npresented to him she finds that she has been registered in exactly\r\nthe right place in his mind. He knows whether she writes about\r\nfashion, or, alas! alas! reports women conventions. Schuyler Colfax\r\nknows everything that is published in the newspapers. There is no\r\nroom in his mind for lumber. It is full of working material, and he\r\nis the fairest specimen of progressive Young America to be found on\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nMiss Nellie Grant is a prominent feature of the levees and receptions\r\nat the White House. She is just exactly at the age when the feathers\r\nof her wings are not quite well enough grown to admit of her flying\r\nas a woman, and yet they are far enough advanced to spoil her\r\nattractions as a child. Her costume is of the rarest and costliest\r\nkind, and she conducts herself as becomes the only daughter of a\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAn elegant woman is seen standing in the background, slender almost\r\nto fragility, arrayed in a trailing robe of black velvet. Her\r\npowdered head and Greek profile take you back to the days of Louis\r\nXIV, and you feel that Madame Pompadour or some other beauty of that\r\nperiod has stepped out of her picture frame and stands flesh and\r\nblood before you. This woman is Mrs. Cresswell, the accomplished wife\r\nof the Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of the crimson curtains stand the Marquis and Madame\r\nde Chambrun. The marquis is an attache of the French legation; the\r\nmadame is the granddaughter of General Lafayette, and one of the most\r\nattractive women in Washington. Nature meant to make her a blonde,\r\nbut forgot herself and kept on with the bleaching process. One\r\ncannot help in contemplation wondering whether her soul is as white\r\nand transparent as the casket. She inherits her grandfather’s love\r\nfor republican principles. The madame has been only a short time in\r\nthe country, but the marquis has been here, more or less, for quite\r\na number of years. It is said that he is writing a history of our\r\nRepublic. He has always been connected with the European press, and\r\nranks high as a literary man at home.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the marquis in the offing might have been seen Admiral\r\nGoldsborough, heavy and ponderous as one of his own war vessels, and\r\ncarrying nobody knows how many guns. He wheezed and puffed as if\r\nthere was something the matter with his machinery, but all persons\r\npresent seemed unaware of danger, and no sign of an explosion or\r\naccident took place. Mrs. Goldsborough accompanied her stately\r\nhusband, apparently a fitting consort in time of war or peace.\r\n\r\n“Ad Interim” Thomas was there in the brightest of military buttons\r\nand army blue. He looked as harmless as one of the wooden guns at\r\nManassas, and it was impossible to believe that he was the same “Ad\r\nInterim” that once shook the Republic from center to circumference.\r\nA fine looking woman clung to his arm, but whether it was Mrs. “Ad\r\nInterim,” or another the writer failed to discover.\r\n\r\nA handsome Virginia member of Congress was there who looked as if he\r\ncarried the regal blood of that proud Commonwealth in his veins. He\r\nhad the courtly bearing which history attributes to the Randolphs,\r\nbut, fearful that he might be a carpetbagger, his name was not\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nSecretary Boutwell was present, accompanied by his daughter, a good,\r\nsensible-looking New England girl, who bears the same relation to the\r\npicture made of her in _Harper’s Bazaar_ that any small circle does\r\nto a large one. She is her father’s hope and her mother’s joy, but\r\nshe is not Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Marine Band discoursed some very bad music, considering what is\r\nexpected of what ought to be the most perfect musical organization in\r\nthe country. The Marine Band has sadly deteriorated of late, and it\r\nwould be well for the people in power to make excellence in this, as\r\nwell as all other things, a distinction of national favor.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL ETIQUETTE.\r\n\r\nRULES THEREFOR AS DRAWN BY PRESIDENT WASHINGTON--THE EXISTING CODE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 10, 1870_.\r\n\r\nOriginally the word “etiquette” meant a mark or title affixed to a\r\nbag or bundle denoting its contents, but in the modern acceptation of\r\nthe word it is an account of ceremonies. It is a term applied to the\r\nforms which are observed toward particular persons, or in particular\r\nplaces, especially in courts, levees, and on public occasions.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the nation’s life our beloved forefathers thought\r\nthat all these forms which marked the distinction between classes or\r\nindividuals should be done away with at the same time with all the\r\nrest of the hollow mockeries which go to make a monarchical form of\r\ngovernment. Notwithstanding President Washington meant to practice\r\nrepublican simplicity at the headquarters of the nation, “courtly”\r\nways did creep into daily social intercourse. For instance, at Mrs.\r\nWashington’s receptions in both New York and Philadelphia the “first\r\nlady in the land” received precisely after the manner of Queen\r\nCharlotte’s drawing-room levees. The guests were arranged standing\r\nagainst the walls, and the President’s wife marched the rounds and\r\nsaid a kind word to all. When Mrs. Washington paid a morning visit,\r\na servant or usher was sent in advance, “who rapped smartly with his\r\nknuckles on the door” and announced, “Mrs. Washington is coming.”\r\n\r\nDuring these chaotic, unsettled days our far-seeing Washington\r\nrealized that some rules and just regulations must be formed, lest\r\nthe dignity of the Republic should be found trailing in the dust.\r\nHe saw that it was necessary to establish a rank without violating\r\nthe Constitution, which prohibits Congress and the States from\r\ngranting any title of nobility. Of so much importance to the country\r\ndid he consider this subject that he addressed letters to Messrs.\r\nAdams and Hamilton, asking their attention and advice upon certain\r\npoints of etiquette touching the deportment of the President of the\r\nUnited States. After mature reflection, the three wise men, Messrs.\r\nWashington, Adams, and Hamilton, fixed upon certain rules, which were\r\nafterwards endorsed by Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RULES.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring the members of society together in the first\r\ninstance, the custom of the country was established that residents\r\nshall pay the first visit to strangers; and among strangers, first\r\ncomers to later comers, foreign and domestic, the character of\r\nstranger ceasing after the first visit. To this rule there is a\r\nsingle exception--foreign ministers, from the necessity of making\r\nthemselves known, pay the first visit to the Cabinet ministers of the\r\nnation, which is returned.\r\n\r\nWhen brought together in society all are perfectly equal, whether\r\nforeign or domestic, titled or untitled, in or out of office. All\r\nother observances are but exemplifications of these two principles.\r\n\r\nThe families of foreign ministers arriving at the seat of Government\r\nreceive the first visit from those of the national ministers as well\r\nas from all other residents.\r\n\r\nMembers of the legislature and the judiciary, independent of their\r\noffices, have a right as strangers to receive the first visit.\r\n\r\nNo title being admitted here, those of foreigners give no precedence.\r\n\r\nDifference of grade among the diplomatic members gives no precedence.\r\n\r\nAt public ceremonies to which the Government invites the presence of\r\nforeign ministers and their families, a convenient seat or station\r\nwill be provided for them, with any other strangers invited, and the\r\nfamilies of the national ministers, each taking place as they arrive,\r\nand without any precedence.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the principle of equality, or of _pele-mele_, and\r\nprevent the growth of precedence out of courtesy, the members of\r\nthe executive will practice at their own houses and recommend an\r\nadherence to the ancient usages of the country--of gentlemen in\r\nmass giving precedence to the ladies in mass, in passing from one\r\napartment where they are assembled into another.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time these severe republican rules have been discussed\r\nand ameliorated to suit the growing aristocratic taste of the great\r\nmodern American Republic.\r\n\r\nIn later years a set of rules has been adopted which is called the\r\n“Code.” It is said all branches of the Government were appealed to in\r\norder to be suited, and the rules of the code were the result; but\r\nwhether President Monroe or some other dignitary of those days was\r\nthe author, the writer has no means of ascertaining.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CODE.\r\n\r\n_The President._--Business calls are received at all times and hours\r\nwhen the President is unengaged. The morning hours are preferred.\r\nSpecial days and evenings are assigned each season for calls of\r\nrespect,--one morning and evening a week being assigned for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nReceptions are held during the winter season, generally once a week,\r\nbetween 8 and 10 o’clock in the evening, at which time the guests are\r\nexpected in full dress, and are presented by the usher.\r\n\r\nThe President holds public receptions on the first of January and the\r\nFourth of July, when the diplomatic corps present themselves in court\r\ncostume, and the officers of the Army and Navy in full uniform. The\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Government are\r\nreceived between the hours of 11 and 12; after which the diplomatic\r\ncorps, officers of the Army and Navy, and civilians _en masse_.\r\n\r\nThe President accepts no invitations to dinner, and makes no calls\r\nor visits of ceremony; but is at liberty to visit without ceremony,\r\nat his pleasure. An invitation to dinner at the President’s must be\r\naccepted in writing, and a previous engagement cannot take precedence.\r\n\r\nThe address of the Executive in conversation is Mr. President.\r\n\r\n_The Vice-President._--A visit from the Vice-President is due to the\r\nPresident on the meeting of Congress. He is entitled to the first\r\nvisit from all others, which he may return by card or in person.\r\n\r\n_The Supreme Court._--The judges call upon the President and\r\nVice-President, annually, upon the opening of the court, and on the\r\nfirst day of January.\r\n\r\n_The Cabinet._--Members of the President’s Cabinet call upon the\r\nPresident on New Year’s day and the Fourth of July. First calls are\r\nalso due from them, by card or in person, to the Vice-President,\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, Senators, and the Speaker of the House\r\nof Representatives, on the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\n_The Senate._--Senators call in person on the President and\r\nVice-President on the meeting of Congress and the first day of\r\nJanuary; and upon the President on the Fourth of July, if Congress is\r\nin session. They also call in person or by card upon the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on\r\nthe meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives._--The Speaker calls\r\nupon the President on the meeting of Congress, the first day of\r\nJanuary, and the Fourth of July if Congress is in session. The first\r\ncall is also due from him to the Vice-President on the meeting of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n_The House of Representatives._--Members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives call in person on the President on the first day of\r\nJanuary, and upon the Speaker of the House on the opening of each\r\nsession. They also call, by card or in person, upon the President\r\non the Fourth of July, if Congress is in session, and upon the\r\nPresident, Vice-President, judges of the Supreme Court, Cabinet\r\nofficers, Senators, Speaker of the House, and foreign ministers, soon\r\nafter the opening of each session of Congress.\r\n\r\n_Foreign ministers._--The diplomatic corps call upon the President\r\non the first day of January, and upon the Vice-President, Cabinet\r\nofficers, judges of the Supreme Court, Senators, and Speaker\r\nof the House, by card or in person, on the first opportunity\r\nafter presenting their credentials to the President. They also\r\nmake an annual call of ceremony, by card or in person, upon the\r\nVice-President, judges of the Supreme Court, Senators, and Speaker of\r\nthe House, soon after the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\n_The Court of Claims._--The judges of the Court of Claims call in\r\nperson upon the President on the first of January and the Fourth\r\nof July. They also make first visits to the Cabinet officers and\r\ndiplomatic corps, and call by card or in person upon the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, Senators, Speaker, and members of the House, soon\r\nafter the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\n_The families of officials._--The rules which govern officials are\r\nalso applicable to their families in determining the conduct of\r\nsocial intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe above code answers the same purpose to social life in Washington\r\nthat the Constitution does to the whole country. So long as those\r\nengaged in the controversy stick to it they are safe. The moment\r\nthey leave it they are adrift. At present a severe war is waging\r\nbetween the Senators and Supreme Judges. We beg the pardon of these\r\nsensible men; we mean their families have armed themselves cap-a-pie,\r\nand a great smoke is ascending from the battlefield. The wives of\r\nthe Senators claim that the Senate created the Supreme Judges, and,\r\nto use the words of one of the brightest leading Senators, “Should\r\nthe creature outrank its creator?” The Supreme Judge is made by the\r\nSenator, and if he is guilty of misdemeanor, he is tried by the\r\nSenate, and if found guilty, is deposed from his high office by the\r\nsame. But once let a man get to be a Supreme Judge, and he stands as\r\nfirm on the pinnacle to which he has been raised as the rock of ages\r\non the bed of eternity.\r\n\r\nThen it is claimed that all those who stand in the direct line\r\nof succession to the President outrank all the others. Our wise\r\nforefathers meant that our Government should never fall to pieces\r\nfor the want of a “head.” So, if our military chieftain should go\r\noff like one of his own cannons, we should still have our precious\r\nSchuyler. If Vice-President Colfax should be snatched away from\r\nthe evil to come, we should have to comfort ourselves with Speaker\r\nBlaine. Alas! alas! if he should fall like the smart rap of his own\r\ngavel, Chief Justice Chase would be left on our hands, and death\r\ncould get no farther.\r\n\r\nThe “Code” says--and, by the way, it is just as good as the\r\nConstitution--that the Cabinet shall make first calls on the\r\nVice-President, Supreme Judges, Senators, and Speaker of the House,\r\nbut General Grant has taken these favored darlings to his bosom and\r\nallows them to do just as they please. He says: “The Cabinet is a\r\npart of my family; I want them looked upon as such.” So when the\r\nSupreme Judges, with Chief Justice Chase at their head, went to pay\r\ntheir respects to the President, on last New Year’s day, they found\r\nthe President surrounded by his Cabinet, and these haughty men were\r\nobliged to bow the knee. Now, there is nothing in nature so free from\r\nthe elastic qualities as the spine of a judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. As soon as time would allow, Chief Justice Chase\r\naddressed a letter to the Chief Magistrate, protesting against such\r\nunheard of and altogether unusual proceedings; but Ulysses smoked his\r\ncigar whilst he dictated one of those masterly papers of diplomacy,\r\nand the military secretary saw that it was safely delivered, and\r\nnothing more has been heard of it from that day to this.\r\n\r\nThe “Code” also says that the President accepts no invitation\r\nto dinner. This has heretofore been the custom, not because the\r\nPresident was a man, but because the man was a President, and,\r\ntherefore, it was necessary to give no citizen cause for complaint,\r\nfor if the President dines with one neighbor, why not with another?\r\nBesides, there are millions who would be glad to share their crust\r\nwith this man. Ulysses S. Grant proves to the world that he is not\r\nabove being a man because he has been elected President, and that\r\nhe has no objection to going out to dinner, provided the viands be\r\nsubstantial and all the beverages pure. But let it be understood,\r\nthe President does not scatter the bright light of his countenance\r\nindiscriminately, for only certain aristocratic dwellings are honored\r\nat dinner time by the presence of power.\r\n\r\nTwo receptions are held at the White House weekly,--one in the\r\ndaytime, the other in the evening. The first is held on Tuesday, and\r\nis called in the newspapers “Mrs. Grant’s reception.” It is held on\r\none of the Cabinet days, and, after the Cabinet consultation is over,\r\nthe President descends to the Blue Room and aids Mrs. Grant in her\r\narduous undertaking. Heretofore every President’s wife has received\r\nby herself, unless some guest happened to be stopping temporarily\r\nat the mansion. Mrs. Grant, however, has inaugurated a new order of\r\nthings. Several women, usually the wives of some of the members of\r\nthe Cabinet or of the Senators, are invited to the White House to\r\nlunch, and afterwards are detained to help do the pleasing work.\r\nImagine a room of blue and gold, satin and ebony, where art, to carry\r\nout everything, has not only drawn inspiration from the “Arabian\r\nNights’ Entertainment,” but at the same time has exhausted itself.\r\nThen picture our simple American dames, in costume that vies with\r\nVictoria’s and Eugenie’s on drawing-room days, each in her appointed\r\nplace, at the right or the left of the “first lady in the land,” we\r\ntrow no finer picture of a queen, surrounded by her “maids of honor,”\r\ncan be found in any monarchy on the face of the globe. These dainty\r\nreceptions are advertised in the _Chronicle_ to begin at 2 o’clock p.\r\nm., but alas! alas! it has happened to our positive knowledge that\r\nwhilst these dames were lingering over the Presidential lunch table 2\r\no’clock has come and gone, and in the meantime exasperated American\r\nwomen have doubled their pretty little gloved fist in the East Room,\r\nand some have whisked out of the mansion without stopping to pay\r\ntheir respects to the “first lady of the land.” In the name of the\r\nmasses of the people we ask, can our officials of to-day afford to\r\ndepart from that simple republican platform of etiquette laid down by\r\nthe immortal Washington? Can our public men, temporarily in power,\r\nsafely divorce themselves from that later code laid down by general\r\nfitness and substantial common sense?\r\n\r\nWhither are we drifting, in a social, republican point of view,\r\nwhen a Senator’s wife tosses her head and says: “Would you think it\r\npossible that the wife of a member has had the impertinence to ask\r\nme to come and spend an evening socially with her?” To a spectator,\r\nlooking on this small society side-show, it seems all the more\r\nridiculous, as the Senator-husband is so small that he is scarcely\r\never heard of either in the country or the Senate, whilst the member\r\nin dispute has a fame like the flag of our country.\r\n\r\nTo a neat little volume, called “Philip’s Washington Described,”\r\nwe are indebted for a copy of the “Rules” as laid down by General\r\nWashington, as well as the “Code,” which was meant to be a new\r\nedition of the “Rules,” revised and corrected.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PHIL SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\nTHE HANDSOME WARRIOR GRACES THE SPEAKER’S RECEPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 14, 1870_.\r\n\r\nNever since the inauguration of our Republic has social life in\r\nWashington assumed such brilliant hues as during the present winter.\r\nWith the departure of the Democratic dynasty, and the disappearance\r\nof the Southern queens of society, it has been thought that the\r\nsunshine of the “Republican court” would go out forever. But the\r\nextravagant magnificence of to-day eclipses all former years; and if\r\nMrs. Slidell or Mrs. Crittenden should revisit the haunts of their\r\nformer triumphs they would find the social kingdom in stronger hands\r\nthan their own. If the Southern woman ruled as queen, the haughty\r\nNortherner sways the sceptre of an empress. The Southern queen\r\npointed to her slaves; the empress of to-day wears a coronet of\r\ndiamonds, and only death can set her bondmen free.\r\n\r\nReception, ball, dinner, sociable--which shall be described first?\r\nThe Prince’s ball darted across the social sky like a meteor. It has\r\ncome and gone, and Washington’s fashionable women still survive. The\r\nNew York _Tribune_ says that one young lady refused to dance with the\r\nPrince because she invariably declined all round-dances. Then she\r\nrefused to be his partner in a quadrille, because it would keep dear\r\npapa and mama later than they had decided to stay. All this sounds\r\nvery nice in the newspapers, only it is a pretty fib and counterfeit\r\nand should never pass for the genuine.\r\n\r\nThe President’s levee and the Speaker’s reception bear a strong\r\nresemblance to each other. Everybody is admitted to Speaker Blaine’s\r\nthe same as the Executive Mansion. All the great men are there except\r\nthe President, and all the pretty girls, in their best clothes,\r\nare cast up on this fashionable beach by the social waves of the\r\npeople. If there is one sight in this wicked world, more pitiful than\r\nanother, it is to see a poor widow’s daughter, or an innocent young\r\nTreasury employee in her simple robes of muslin, apparently raised\r\nfor a brief time to the social platform of wealth and power. In no\r\nplace on the face of the globe can the two opposite social elements\r\ncome together as at a President’s levee or a Speaker’s reception.\r\nWealth is pitted against poverty; strength against weakness, and the\r\nresult sometimes is brought forth in a fruit more deceitful, bitter,\r\nand dusty than the apples of the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is the night of the Speaker’s social reunion. Carriages draw up\r\nbefore the handsome imitation brownstone residence. These vehicles\r\ndeposit the precious perfumed darlings--the aristocracy--the cream\r\nof society. Gay cavaliers dance attendance on these flounced,\r\nfrizzled, bejeweled butterflies. These cavaliers generally wear\r\nhats and overcoats which look as if they had been borrowed from the\r\nold-clothes man, or purchased at a bargain at the second-hand store\r\nhard by; but as no better place on the earth can be found for losing\r\none’s outside wrappings than these levees and receptions, the men\r\nshow their good sense by going prepared. The cars are freighted to\r\noverflowing. The ambitious young mechanic takes his young sweetheart\r\non his arm and pays his respects to the Speaker. The suite of parlors\r\nat the brown mansion are on the first floor, and through the broad\r\nopen doors, all newcomers can be inspected as they march to an upper\r\nstory to be divested of wrappings, and it is quite as unsafe to judge\r\nwhat is beneath the ugly waterproofs as to guess what is under the\r\ncaterpillar’s skin. Mirrors are provided in the dressing-room, where\r\njaded maid and faded matrons can assist nature to carry out her\r\nmost pressing needs. Boxes of pearl powder, brushes, combs, pins,\r\ndressing-maid are convenient, and if the last finishing touch of\r\nthe toilet is omitted, the lady of the mansion is not to blame. It\r\nmust be mentioned, however, that it is only the silk that powders in\r\npublic; muslin and merino are the spectators in the scene.\r\n\r\n“Belle, don’t you think one of my eyebrows is a little blacker than\r\nthe other?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I think they both need touching up.”\r\n\r\n“Too late now! Why didn’t you tell me before we left home? There,\r\ntake up my handkerchief and rub it off.”\r\n\r\nPretty little white-gloved hand goes through with the daintiest\r\nmanipulations, and the two eyebrows come out like Bonner’s fast\r\nteam. Out of the dressing-room, down the tufted stairs that smother\r\nfootsteps. There is something frightful about a human habitation\r\nwhere no footfall is ever heard. The eye is a glorious organ, but\r\nthe ear is the better friend. You enter the first parlor, which is\r\nthe beginning of the three _en suite_. It is elegantly furnished in\r\nexquisite taste. One of Bierstadt’s Rocky Mountain pictures has a\r\nconspicuous place on the wall. A Beatrice Cenci, in its voluptuous\r\nbeauty, suspended in another place, takes you back to old sensual\r\nRome, whilst a miniature world swings on its axis in a friendly\r\ncorner in a second room, with plenty of books to keep it company.\r\n\r\nNear the hall door of the first parlor stands the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and by his side may be seen his wife. If\r\nit is right to judge by personal appearance, they seem excellently\r\nmatched. Speaker Blaine is a handsome man in every sense of the\r\nword. There is just about the right amount of material used in his\r\nconstruction, and, as a general thing, it has been put in the proper\r\nplace. He has a large kindly eye that would not do to look into\r\nfor any great length of time, for the same reason that gazing into\r\nthe sea is apt to make one sick. All his other features have been\r\narranged artistically to match his Oriental eyes, and his form is\r\nas straight and symmetrical as a Maine pine tree. He shakes hands\r\nwith his numerous countrymen with a vigor, and if he did hold on an\r\ninstant longer than it was necessary to the little kid-gloved digits\r\nof the New York _World’s_ correspondent, it only proved that he was\r\nmortal like poor Adam, and that he was willing to touch any amount of\r\nevil for a woman’s sake.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blaine stood beside her husband with something brighter and\r\nbetter than mere physical beauty in her face. Few if any women at\r\nthe capital have a stronger countenance, and yet it is sweet and\r\nwomanly. Everything about her is toned down to softest neutral tints.\r\nIf she calls forth no thrill of admiration, she awakens no spirit\r\nof criticism. There are some colors in nature that are particularly\r\ngrateful to the eye. There are some women in the same sense that are\r\nparticularly grateful to all the senses. Their presence breathes\r\nrepose. When you get near them your mind takes off its armor, draws\r\nin its pickets, and prepares to go into winter quarters. Mrs.\r\nBlaine’s superb taste may be seen in her elegant, well appointed\r\nhome, in the world-renowned behavior of her husband, and just as he\r\nfills his most honored position, with dignified grace, she fills\r\nanother still higher--that of the American matron at home.\r\n\r\nMost noticeable of all the distinguished men who hover around\r\nthe Speaker is General Phil Sheridan. In an instant you perceive\r\nthat he is carved out of material from which Presidents ought to\r\nbe made. Judging from memory, he seems no taller than the late\r\nStephen A. Douglas, and in the same sense that Mr. Douglas was\r\ncalled the “Little Giant,” General Sheridan impresses you with the\r\nawful attribute of power. He has uncommonly broad shoulders for his\r\nheight, and an eye like the American eagle’s. As if to carry out this\r\npicture, the country knows that he is a solitary bird, without even\r\na mate to share his lone eyrie in wicked Chicago, and if matters do\r\nnot mend in this direction it would be well for the people to take\r\nthis most interesting situation into their own hands, and at the same\r\ntime put a man in his place who will not retreat in the face of the\r\nfeminine foe.\r\n\r\nA tropical exotic is seen in a distant corner. It is young Lopez, the\r\nson of the Dictator of Paraguay. “Shirley Dare,” a woman of taste,\r\nsays, he is “handsome.” To our eyes he is distinguished looking,\r\nnothing more. That peculiar flame born of mixed blood burns under\r\nhis swarthy skin; it flushes his cheek, reddens his lips, and shines\r\nin his eyes with the cold glitter of black diamonds. You picture him\r\nswinging in his hammock under South American skies, and yet it is\r\nwell to remember that he has not been in his native country for eight\r\nyears, and the probability is, if he should return, his father would\r\nsee in him a formidable rival, and in that case he would share the\r\nfate of all his illustrious relatives.\r\n\r\nColonel Parker, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, was there with\r\nhis white wife. It will be remembered that Colonel Parker belongs\r\nto the Indian tribe known as the “Six Nations.” It is said that he\r\ncomes from mixed blood. If this is the case, the Indian was put on\r\nthe outside, and the white blood was kept for the lining. He looks as\r\nmuch like an Indian as President Grant looks like a white man, and he\r\nis a very good representative of his race. His wife is fair, standing\r\nbeside him, and attracts attention because she has broken a law; but\r\nwhy should she be received in society for the same reason that puts\r\nthe poor Irish washerwoman, who links her fate with another race,\r\nbeyond the pale of association, only the newspapers can answer.\r\n\r\nAs yet no half breeds have made their appearance, which proves there\r\nis a destiny which has something to do with shaping our ends.\r\n\r\nFor the reason that the card receptions of Secretary Fish are held\r\nthe same evening, many of the ladies of the foreign legations\r\npay their respects to the Speaker and his wife before going to\r\nthe mansion of the Secretary of State. Whilst the toilette of the\r\nAmerican woman is quite as costly, it cannot be said to be as\r\nelaborate and far fetched as that of the European sisters. The\r\ndresses of these foreigners are usually made up of trimmings. The\r\neye is bewildered and lost in the multiplicity of flounces, fringes,\r\nlaces, ribbons, and all those things which, in moderation, ought\r\nto be dear to every woman’s heart. The stylish daughters of Baron\r\nGerolt, the Prussian minister, were there, and their costumes must\r\nhave been perfect according to the European standard. The whole\r\nupper surface of their pretty little heads was turned into a flower\r\ngarden; rosebuds were planted around the edges, and full blown roses\r\nblossomed in the center whilst long shoots and tendrils clung to\r\ntheir chignons as ivy nestles up to a damp wall. Their dresses were\r\ncomposed of that peculiar tint of silk called “ashes of roses,” and\r\nthe fringes and satin trimmings were deep rose pink. Oh, the weary,\r\nweary labor of making these butterfly wardrobes, and these dresses\r\nwere made by hand! No sewing machine had been used in the production.\r\nThe tiny short sleeves were put together like patchwork, and between\r\neach tiny piece of silk was a satin cord. There was just the same\r\nproportion of human work on the long trained skirts, on the little\r\nfractional waists; and yet these extravagant toilettes, worn by these\r\ndaughters of so-called lineage, only proved that in matters of dress\r\nthere is such a thing as gilding refined gold and painting the rose,\r\nbut this kind of work is always attended with the same consequences.\r\n\r\nA literary woman connected with the _Rural New Yorker_ was present,\r\nand dazzled the beholders with her handsome face, lemon-colored silk,\r\nand black lace. A sweeter face scarcely ever looks out of a picture;\r\nbut alas! alas! why did she not put herself into the hands of some\r\nstylish modiste, and yield the point as gracefully as a literary\r\nwoman knows how? There is nothing so damaging to a woman’s toilet as\r\nto begin a certain style and not have the stamina or force of mind to\r\ncarry it out. What is worse than a weak decoction of anything? If a\r\nwoman decides to adopt “Pompadour” it must be completion to the last,\r\nelse all is sacrificed. The reason that literary women sometimes fail\r\nin matters of taste in dress is because they do not give sufficient\r\nattention to the subject. The perfect arrangement of a woman’s\r\ncostume is one of the fine arts as much as carving a statue, painting\r\na picture, or writing an exquisite newspaper article.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDWINTER SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nHOW THE CABINET LADIES CONDUCT THEIR SEVERAL FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 15, 1870_.\r\n\r\nMidway between a President’s levee and a private entertainment lies\r\nthe social ground occupied by the card reception. It is semi-official\r\nin its character, because public position has much to do with general\r\ninvitations extended to the guests. It does not necessarily follow\r\nthat calls must have been exchanged between any of the parties in the\r\ncontest. A man is invited because he is a Senator, head of a bureau,\r\nor an upper clerk in either branch of Congress. At the same time each\r\nCabinet minister means to look after the social interests of his own\r\nState by gathering under his hospitable wings as many of its citizens\r\nstopping in Washington as his mansion will possibly admit, estimated\r\nby cubic measure.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the social season four out of the seven\r\nCabinet ministers have issued cards for three receptions each. These\r\ninclude Secretaries Fish, Belknap, Cox, and Postmaster-General\r\nCresswell. The receptions held at the magnificent mansion of the\r\nSecretary of State have been simply a continuation of those elegant\r\nentertainments for which his distant home was celebrated when he was\r\na citizen in private life. Only a man of great wealth can afford to\r\nbe an American “Premier.” All the foreign legations are gathered\r\naround his liberal American hearth, and is it not most consoling\r\nto our national pride to remember that it is broad and generous in\r\nevery sense of the word? Yet why our open-handed countryman should\r\nbe obliged to spend his private means to keep up the dignity of the\r\nRepublic only the people through their representatives can answer.\r\n\r\nElegantly unostentatious have been the receptions held at the\r\nhandsome residence of the three remaining ministers. In either\r\ncase no effort has been made of display. It would seem that these\r\nSecretaries have a just appreciation of the social bearings of their\r\npositions, and yet realize, with Mr. Dawes, that, in the face of the\r\nfinancial peril of the country, frugality and economy should be the\r\norder of the day.\r\n\r\nThe great reception triumph of the season has been held at the\r\nhistoric Seward mansion, at present the home of the Secretary of\r\nWar. Outside of the public buildings no house in Washington is so\r\nmemorable in associations as this plain, unpretending pile of brick\r\nand mortar. It is broad, old-fashioned, with rooms extending far\r\nback, and everything about it reminds one of the good old days of\r\none’s grandfather, and its severe simplicity is as refreshing as pure\r\nair when compared with the sensuous gingerbread work of the luxurious\r\nmodern mansion.\r\n\r\nThe reception of the War Secretary and his accomplished wife was\r\nhonored by the President of the United States, accompanied by the\r\nwell-known Dent family. The newspapers have much to say about the\r\n“Dents;” but a close inspection of their every-day lives, as well as\r\ntheir antecedents, proves that our Chief Magistrate might have fallen\r\ninto much worse hands. It is true they are numerous; but, as they did\r\nnot make themselves, this sin must be laid at another door. Besides,\r\nare they to blame because a President happened to drop into their\r\nnest? Is there a man or woman in the country with stamina enough to\r\nkeep them modest if they had a brother-in-law more potent than any\r\nking? Besides, these dozen or more brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law\r\nare exceedingly well behaved, considering the excellent opportunities\r\nwhich might be turned to mischief. A member of the Dent family has\r\nnever been known to be connected with the gold ring; has never been\r\nsummoned before a Congressional committee. It is true, they like to\r\nsnuggle under the warm wing of the President; but are not the great\r\narms of the nation long enough to embrace the whole brood?\r\n\r\nUp the very stairs that once echoed to the footsteps of the assassin\r\nPaine poured a stream of life composed of the creme de la creme of\r\nthe national capital. Members of the foreign legations, with their\r\nladies, were there; and this is unusual, as many of these haughty\r\nforeigners are seldom or never seen in Washington society except at\r\nthe mansion of the Secretary of State. The Cabinet, Supreme Bench,\r\nSenate, House of Representatives, distinguished members of the press,\r\nwere present; and, to give additional brilliancy to the scene, the\r\nArmy and Navy were largely represented, glittering in blue broadcloth\r\nand the usual golden trappings.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the first parlor stood the Secretary of War; at\r\nhis right hand might have been seen his fair young wife. With all due\r\nrespect to secrecy, it is whispered that Secretary Belknap is just a\r\nshade handsomer than any other man in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nHis exterior surface indicates the pure Saxon, and his eyes are\r\nthe color of that deep blue liquid which is obtained by dissolving\r\nindigo in sulphuric acid. He had the true soldier’s form, which is\r\ntall, broad, and deep, and his voice is as mellow as an organ’s. His\r\nstep has a ring when his foot touches the pavement, and his hand has\r\nthe true grip, whether it hauls a rebel colonel over the earthworks\r\non the battlefield, or touches the dainty finger-tips of a woman.\r\nIt is said that Secretary Belknap has a warm place in the Chief\r\nMagistrate’s heart, which proves that the feminine element does not\r\nenter into the construction of a President. General Belknap is a\r\nwarrior by inheritance as well as by practice, for ever since the\r\nbeginning of the Republic the long line of Belknaps have taken up\r\narms in defense of their country.\r\n\r\nThe fine young face of Mrs. Belknap, as she receives the host of\r\ndignitaries who have come to pay their respects to the great war\r\npower represented by her husband, is just as refreshing as pure water\r\nat the hillside. The bride of a year, a newcomer to the capital, she\r\nhas not had time to be spoiled by adulation. The genuine, kind ways\r\nof private life she bears unspotted to her high social position, and\r\nthe graceful manners which she brings with her from her Kentucky home\r\nremind us of the days of Mrs. Crittenden, when the distinguished\r\nwomen of that State were the fixed stars of society in Washington.\r\nMrs. Belknap wore upon this occasion the same superb dress which\r\ngraced the Prince’s ball, which proves that she does not intend to\r\nimitate those extravagant women who will not be seen twice in the\r\nsame toilette. If this independent trait in her character lessens her\r\nin the opinion of her feminine peers, let us hasten to tell her how\r\nmuch it endears her to the people. Mrs. Belknap shares the honors of\r\nbeauty with Mrs. Cresswell in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the War Secretary stood the President, with his\r\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Sharp, at his side. Marshal Sharp might have been\r\nin the vicinity, but as he is only a Dent by marriage, his presence\r\nor absence need not be noted. The President brought with him the\r\nsame “killing eye” which the New York _World_ so vividly described,\r\nyet another Dent sunned himself in its beams without the least sign\r\nof damage. Mrs. Grant remained at home, owing to indisposition, but\r\nMrs. Sharp performed her part with exceeding grace and good nature.\r\nShe wore a handsome blue silk dress, almost devoid of trimmings, with\r\nan elegant point lace shawl, and pearl jewelry. Mrs. Sharp is not\r\nnoticeable for beauty or the want of it. She has the average face of\r\nAmerican women, and her friends speak of her in the highest terms of\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nSecretary and Mrs. Fish were seen not very far removed from the\r\nPresidential party. If Mr. Fish was not the Secretary of the State,\r\nwe should call him jolly. He looks as if he breakfasts on reed birds,\r\ndines on terrapin, and floats his life barge on rivers of champagne.\r\nOh! the dainties, the flavors, the sweets that go to make up this\r\ngenial and generous man. In contemplating him, one realizes that it\r\nwould not be so very bad to be a South Sea Islander or an innocent\r\nFeejee. It must be because he is so palatable in personal appearance\r\nthat he makes such an admirable Secretary of State. How delicately\r\nhe has manipulated our complicated Spanish and Cuban affairs! how\r\ndiscreetly he manages the _Alabama_ claims! It is said, “There are as\r\ngood fish in the sea as were ever caught.” Secretary Fish, with the\r\nofficial hook in his mouth lives to fling the truth in the face of\r\nthe old adage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fish--ah! where shall words be found to describe the woman that\r\nawakens that exalted sentiment, and makes one long to call her mother\r\nor some other endearing name? She has an intellectual countenance,\r\nnoble enough to belong to a nun. Mrs. Fish has the mind, heart, and\r\nmanners to grace the White House, and no greater compliment can be\r\npaid to an American woman.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Mrs. Fish might have been seen standing many\r\nof the members of the foreign legations. Most noticeable were the\r\nponderous daughters of the Peruvian minister, Colonel Don Manuel\r\nFreyre. The weight of these South American damsels reaches far\r\ninto the hundreds. It is well for the country that Barnum has been\r\nlost in the Mammoth Cave else our relations with distant countries\r\nmight become hopelessly entangled. Considering how densely humanity\r\nwas packed in the parlors of the war mansion, these elephantine\r\nbeauties might have created a panic had a tramp or a promenade\r\nbecome necessary, but, fortunately for life and limb, this was not\r\nundertaken, and no accident occurred to mar the festivity of the\r\nscene. These accomplished South American ladies are considered\r\ngreat beauties in their country, for in the land of the Incas\r\nsuperabundant flesh is not considered in the way.\r\n\r\nIn a picturesque attitude, leaning against a doorway, might have been\r\nseen Mary Clemmer Ames, of the New York _Independent_. Aggressive\r\nliterary labor begins to work its way in tiny little grooves and\r\ndaintiest of channels on her poetical face. Mrs. Ames has written\r\nsome very fair poetry, which she is well aware of, and it has raised\r\nher to that sublimatic height to which common mortals seldom or never\r\nattain. Her costume was a credit to the New York _Independent_, for\r\nnothing more elaborate was to be seen in the rooms. To prove to the\r\nworld that literary women do know how to dress it is necessary to\r\ndescribe this star of the first magnitude. Mrs. Ames appeared at\r\nthe reception of the gallant War Secretary in purest white silk, en\r\ntrain, surmounted by a heavy pink satin overskirt. This overskirt\r\narrangement was the crowning triumph of her superb toilette. This\r\nupper skirt was scalloped, paniered, and squared with mathematical\r\nexactness, and rounded with poetic measures. It was lifted up at the\r\nproper corners; at the same time it floated free in Greek outlines\r\nafter the manner of ancient drapery. Nothing that an elegant pink\r\nsatin overskirt could do for a poetess was left undone. It might be\r\nsaid that this rose-colored cloud had accomplished its destiny, and\r\nought henceforth to be spirited to the Milky Way, there to shine in\r\nstarry glory forever, a warning to all those common mortals who have\r\na way of stretching their mouths every time they see a first-class\r\nliterary woman prepared for the altar of a social occasion. Mary\r\nClemmer Ames takes to rosebuds. Isn’t this surest evidence of the\r\npoetic talent? Rosebuds have stirred up more genius than all the\r\ncabbages which have been raised since the world began. A masculine\r\nbiped hovered in the vicinity of Mrs. Ames, but as it was plain that\r\nhe was no poet, a description of his person is omitted.\r\n\r\nIn another parlor were to be seen a galaxy of diamonds, with Mrs.\r\nFernando Wood attached to the back of them. The writer has never\r\nseen so many handsome gems assembled, except on the person of Madame\r\nBodisco, who used to wear the Russian family jewels at Washington.\r\nA necklace of great value sparkled at her throat, great clusters\r\ngleamed in her hair, her handsome arms were manacled with the same,\r\nbut she did not seem to mind being a prisoner, for when her jailor\r\nappeared in the person of the Hon. Fernando, she took his arm just\r\nthe same as if he were like other men.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Samuel Hooper, of Massachusetts, was there, the finest\r\nwintry picture on the floor. After the same manner of the Secretary\r\nof State, he looks as if the earth loved him and had brought him the\r\nchoicest offerings in her power. The sunshine of life has mellowed\r\nhis character. Altogether he is a New England elm, around which the\r\nivy of youth and affection loves to twine. Few men have so many\r\nstrong friends as Mr. Hooper, and none can be found in public life\r\nless harassed by enemies.\r\n\r\nFor hours this distinguished sea of humanity whirled and surged\r\nthrough the mansion. Waiters managed, by some secret known only to\r\nthemselves, to wedge their way through the dense throng and refresh\r\nthe guests with cakes and ices. A room was provided where coffee and\r\nchocolate were served, but no costly wine or any other beverage that\r\nintoxicates was seen at the reception of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nA glowering night prepared itself for the reception of the\r\nPostmaster-General. It rained, but as this part of the program\r\nconcerned nobody but the hackmen and the horses, and as no Professor\r\nBergh was present to look after the trials of his four-footed\r\nfriends, the reception came off with additional glory reflected from\r\nthe dark surroundings. In the midst of the pelting rain the carriages\r\ndrew up before the handsome residence of the Postmaster-General, in\r\nthe most fashionable quarter of the West End. Matting or drugget\r\nwas laid outwardly from the mansion. A policeman opened the door of\r\nyour carriage and held an extensive umbrella over your head while\r\nyou found your way into the entrance. That short walk was the most\r\nimpressive part of the evening’s entertainment. A cloud darker\r\nthan the heavens above lined either side of the open space. It was\r\nreflected from the dense crowd of colored people who had collected\r\nto inspect the guests, who for a moment were visible as they passed\r\nfrom the carriage to the mansion. This crowd of boys, girls and men\r\nseemed as indifferent to the pelting rain as the dumb creatures which\r\nnature clothes in her own curious fashion. Once within the vestibule,\r\nwe had light and music, celebrated men and brave women. In the usual\r\nplace at the entrance of the first parlor might have been seen the\r\nPostmaster-General, and not far removed his accomplished wife. The\r\nPostmaster-General has a commanding person, a broad, towering brow,\r\nand underneath it a pair of opal eyes which burn and glow with the\r\nusual brilliancy of that exquisite gem. The lower part of his face\r\ndenotes aggressive power, as well as that unmistakable pertinacity so\r\nnecessary in a public man. He has set his face against the franking\r\nprivilege, and the chances are that the Postmaster-General will win.\r\nNo man in the United States has been so tortured with applications\r\nfor office; and if he had the photographs of all the women who have\r\napplied to him for postoffices, and they were all laid in a row,\r\nsingle file, they would reach from Maine almost to California.\r\nConsidering Postmaster-General Cresswell’s troubles, he is the most\r\nremarkably well preserved man in Washington.\r\n\r\nMrs. Creswell is handsome, as well as one of the most graceful women\r\nat the capital. Since the absence of Mrs. Senator Sprague from\r\nfashionable society, if she must have a successor, Mrs. Creswell\r\nseems the most available candidate for the vacant place. As an\r\nexample of her exquisite taste she wore black velvet the evening of\r\nher reception, and no toilet is so “perfect at home.”\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no end to the rooms in this modern mansion. In\r\none place a soothing weed was prepared for the lords of creation,\r\nwhere they could steep themselves in smoke if they felt it to be\r\ndesirable. In another chocolate and coffee were dispensed in dainty\r\nlittle cups that must have been imported from Constantinople. In\r\nthe coffee-room might have been seen the genteel Montgomery Blair.\r\nHe had a certain calm look of resignation on his face, sphinx-like\r\nin the extreme, as if he had the strength to bide the time of half\r\na dozen administrations, if it was necessary, before the right one\r\nwould “turn up” for the Blair family. Ex-Secretary McCulloch was\r\nalso in the chocolate-room, surrounded by a bevy of pretty girls;\r\nbut his associates were no better than he deserved, for a better,\r\nkinder-hearted man is hard to find. Another room was devoted to\r\nsandwiches, cakes, and ices. In a corner of this room was seen an\r\nimmense punch-bowl, in which miniature icebergs were grating their\r\nsides. This punch-bowl contained lemonade colored with claret. An\r\nold lady whose veracity can be trusted, said there was just enough\r\nclaret introduced in it to counteract dreadful effects of the ice\r\nand the acid in the beverage; that one could drink a dozen glasses\r\nwithout the least painful effect. At any rate, great quantities of\r\nthis purple fluid disappeared, and no serious mischief followed.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the hundreds of elegant women present was “Shirley\r\nDare,” the Washington correspondent of the New York _World_. She was\r\nrobed in blue satin, which was extremely becoming to her refined\r\nface, milky complexion, and amber-tinted hair. Her dress throughout\r\nwas _comme il faut_ as one of her own fashion letters, and among all\r\nthe literary women who shine at the capital she is the one whom the\r\nwriter feels most like grasping by the hand. She is the true woman\r\njournalist, who accepts the situation, and is willing to fight the\r\nbattle of life on the woman’s platform. She believes that in our\r\nso-called weakness lies our strength, and that if women are only\r\na mind to wake up and go to work, the men will never put down the\r\nbrakes. The New York _World_ has sent her here upon as delicate and\r\ndifficult a mission as the females of olden times undertook when they\r\nwere sent out by their sovereigns to distant courts to take charge\r\nof certain branches of diplomacy. The _World_ ought to have provided\r\nthe wardrobe, the carriage, jewels, and other important et ceteras to\r\nmatch, and afterwards give her a duchy when she returns to New York\r\ncovered with scars and glory. A masculine reporter can slip unnoticed\r\nthrough the mazes of society; not so with a woman. She must be able\r\nto bear inspection. She must be prepared for any fate. What does a\r\nman know about society after he has bathed in it? He is unable to\r\nwrite a respectable society article. The great New York dailies have\r\ntried man after man at the capital, and have finally concluded there\r\nare some things which men cannot do. The newspapers now, in some\r\ndirections, acknowledge the supremacy of woman.\r\n\r\nGen. Fitz Henry Warren, late minister to Guatemala, was present,\r\naccompanied by his accomplished wife. Mrs. Warren is a kind of\r\nperiodical star in Washington society. A few years ago, when her\r\nhusband was Assistant Postmaster-General, she was one of the\r\nnoticeable women of the capital. She reappears again, bringing\r\nthe graceful manners of the old regime, to which is added that\r\nrare cultivation acquired only by residence abroad, and the best\r\ngifts garnered in the passing years. Very few American women have\r\nremarkable inclinations for intellectual pursuits, but Mrs. Warren is\r\nfound among the number.\r\n\r\nWending his way daintily, avoiding the long silken trains as if\r\nthey concealed serpents and scorpions, was seen handsome Senator\r\nCarpenter, of Wisconsin. Oh! that this letter had not reached such\r\na prodigious length, so that an inventory of his attractions might\r\nbe made public! Let it be summed up that he is everything he should\r\nbe and very little that he should not be. Few if any of the men at\r\nthe reception had a finer presence. Colonel John W. Forney was there\r\nalso. It was impossible to find out whether he was made for the\r\nreception, or the reception was made for him. At any rate, the fit\r\nwas excellent; but the same reason that prevents a description of\r\nSenator Carpenter prohibits dwelling upon this specimen of his kind,\r\nand these two last difficult subjects must be laid, for the time, on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR MELAH.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTIONARY IN CHARGE OF STATE DINNERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 8, 1870_.\r\n\r\nWith the termination of the present week we have the last state\r\ndinner at the White House. That event probably marks the close of the\r\nfashionable season. With the New Year these dinners are inaugurated,\r\nand every Wednesday of each week the President is expected to\r\nentertain a given number of Senators and Members. Thirty-six persons\r\nonly can be seated in the banqueting hall of the Executive Mansion,\r\nconsequently it is impossible that all the people’s representatives,\r\nduring one season, shall have the honor of crossing their feet under\r\nthe national mahogany. If the President would follow the custom of\r\nother nations, and invite only men to these official banquets, it\r\nwould happen that all, or nearly all, of our Congressmen would be\r\nthus honored yearly. But the fairer portion of creation is mixed\r\ningeniously in these highly important state matters. Consequently\r\nthe same number of public men are obliged to dine elsewhere. In the\r\ninfancy of the Republic the President had time to bestow upon his\r\nguests, as well as plenty of room, to entertain the nation’s limited\r\nnumber of Congressmen. In those days women were necessary to fill up\r\nthe chinks of conversation; at the same time no public man was left\r\nout in the cold for a whole year because his seat was taken. It has\r\nnow become a matter of great delicacy to choose who shall be invited\r\nto the White House, and who shall not; but no President has given\r\nless offence than the present Executive. It is, however, only amongst\r\nthe women, who are the social rulers at the capital, that any\r\nfeeling is expressed, for the Congressmen who declare state dinners\r\nto be “bores,” and those who escape the trial, consider themselves\r\nfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe “state dining-room” at the White House is a handsome apartment.\r\nA long table, rounded at the ends, extends through the middle\r\nof it, at which thirty-six can be comfortably seated. There is\r\nplenty of room besides for the servants to perform their duties\r\nadmirably. New mirrors and chandeliers have been added since the\r\nadministration of President Grant, but the carpets, upholstering,\r\nand papering have descended from Johnson’s regime. The exquisite\r\ntaste of Martha Patterson is seen on the daintily tinted walls, the\r\nfigures of the carpet so nicely adjusted to the size of the room,\r\nthe dark green satin damask at the windows, and the quaint chairs,\r\nunder her supervision, arranged to match. A clock as ancient as the\r\ndays of Madison adorns one of the marble mantels, whilst a pair of\r\nhydra-headed candlesticks, grim with age, descended from nobody knows\r\nwhose brief reign, grace the other. With the exception of a pair of\r\nmodern mahogany sideboards, the furniture seems to have belonged to\r\nthe eras of Washington or Jefferson, it is so solid and sombre. The\r\nWhite House was modeled after the palace of the Duke of Leister, and\r\nthe state dining-room, more than any other part of the building,\r\nis suggestive of a baronial hall. But if there is one thing more\r\nthan another from which the state dining-room suffers it is from a\r\ndearth of silver. “Steward Melah,” the silver-voiced Italian whom\r\nthe Government employs to look after this part of its business,\r\nactually wrings his hands with terror and dismay when he “sets” the\r\ntable for state occasions. “Why, madame,” says Melah, “there isn’t\r\nenough silver in the White House to set a respectable free-lunch\r\ntable.” Now, the incomparable Melah has been steward at the Everett\r\nHouse, Boston, the Astor, New York, the Stetson at Long Branch, the\r\nSt. Charles, New Orleans, and having served in these first-class\r\ncapacities it may be possible that his ideas are too exalted for the\r\nsame kind of work in the White House. It must be remembered that\r\nall these state dinners are paid for out of the President’s private\r\npurse. The President, however, had put this delicate matter into\r\nSteward Melah’s hands, and the Italian “gets up” a dinner according\r\nto the quality of the guests. These dinners cost from three to\r\nfifteen hundred dollars, though the average cost is about seven\r\nhundred. The state dinner of which Prince Arthur had the honor of\r\npartaking was composed of nine courses, and cost fifteen hundred\r\ndollars; but it is only when royalty is to be entertained that these\r\nfeasts assume such costly proportions. This modest sum does not\r\ninclude the wine and other beverages, for these come under a separate\r\n“item.” In no other administration has the Government appointed a\r\nman to spend the President’s money. Heretofore the “ladies of the\r\nWhite House” have looked after this part of the official business,\r\nand it will at once be seen what frugality is necessary in order to\r\nmake both ends of the Presidential year meet; but no man during the\r\nexistence of the Republic has ever been the recipient of so many\r\ncostly gifts as the Executive, and he reflects honor in return by his\r\nunexampled and reciprocal generosity.\r\n\r\nA rare work of art adorns the center of the long table in the state\r\ndining-room. It is several feet long, and perhaps two feet wide,\r\nand is composed of gilt and looking-glass. The foundation is a long\r\nmirror, and this is beached by a perpendicular shore three inches in\r\nheight, but of no appreciable thickness. Little fern-like upheavings\r\nmay be seen rising out of the tawdry gilt at equal distances apart,\r\nand these are used as receptacles for natural flowers. But, lest\r\nthe guests should look into this mirror, and see each other’s faces\r\nreflected, at moments, too, when the human mouth assumes anything\r\nbut poetic proportions, large vases of flowers are strewn on its\r\nglassy surface, and the mischief of the mirror is nipped in the bud.\r\nThe ornament is not merely ornamental; it is useful. It answers\r\nthe very purpose to help out a social ambuscade, for it can be so\r\narranged as to hide the President from any guest from whose presence\r\nhe is suffering, whether the said person comes under the head of\r\nenemy or friend. Conversation at a state dinner cannot be general.\r\nEach guest must depend upon his own neighborhood. The quality of the\r\nconversation depends entirely upon the kind of people who manufacture\r\nit. Mike Walsh terrified Mrs. Franklin Pierce at a state dinner by\r\ntalking about “going a fishing on Sunday.” A modern Congressman\r\nfilled up the official time between each mouthful by telling his next\r\nlady the exact things which his palate craved. He didn’t like “French\r\ndishes” but he was “fond of pork and beans, as well as ice-cream\r\nand canned peaches.” No doubt the word “Jenkins” will be flung at\r\nyour correspondent for these social criticisms; but gentleman is the\r\nhighest term which can be applied to a politician, and the people\r\nhave just as much right to a description of an official dinner as any\r\nother public event, especially when the Government employs a public\r\nfunctionary in the person of Steward Melah to see the dignity of the\r\nnation carried to the perfection point.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time an accomplished young American woman had the\r\nhonor to dine with the Czar of all the Russias. During the royal\r\nentertainment a plate of delicious grapes was passed around. It\r\nis true the young lady saw the golden knife which rested on the\r\nside of the basket, but as the fruit came to her first she had no\r\nway of learning its use; so she did just as she would have done in\r\nAmerica--she reached out her dainty fingers and lifted from the dish\r\na whole stem of grapes. What was her consternation to see the next\r\nperson, as well as all the other guests, take the golden knife and\r\nsever a single grape each, and transfer it to their plates. Had a\r\nyoung Russian lady in this country helped herself to a whole chicken\r\nthe error would have been precisely the same. It is true the young\r\nwoman committed no crime, but her feelings and those of her friends\r\nwould have been spared had she learned the etiquette of royal tables\r\nbefore she became an Emperor’s guest.\r\n\r\nA man who will go to a state dinner, eat with his knife, and remain\r\nignorant of the use of his finger bowl, should be expelled from\r\nCongress, and ever afterwards be prohibited from holding any place\r\nof trust under the Government. Who does not long for the good\r\nold “courtly” days of Hamilton and Jefferson? The writer of this\r\nletter has once during the winter had the supreme honor of seeing a\r\ngentleman of the old school hand a lady to her carriage. Oh! that\r\nan artist had been on the spot to photograph this noble picture.\r\nThe old man stood with hat uplifted; his right hand touched the\r\ntips of the lady’s fingers; the wind played with the scanty locks\r\nof his uncovered head, and there was a dignity and purity about his\r\nmovements that reminded one of the out-door service when the preacher\r\nsays “ashes to ashes.” The superb manners of the aged gentleman could\r\nonly be felt; they cannot be described.\r\n\r\nIt is the evening of the President’s state dinner. The guests are\r\nnot only invited, but expected to be punctually in their places at\r\n7 o’clock p. m. President and Mrs. Grant are already in the Red\r\nRoom waiting the company. The ladies have disrobed themselves of\r\nouter wrappings, and, like graceful swans, they sail slowly into the\r\npresence. Mrs. Grant is in full evening dress--jewels, laces, and all\r\nthe et ceteras to match. Her lady guests are attired as handsomely as\r\nherself, and the gentlemen are expected to wear black swallow-tail\r\ncoats and white neckties.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant leads the way with the wife of the oldest Senator\r\npresent on his arm--not the oldest Senator in years but the one who\r\nhas enjoyed the longest term of office. The President is followed by\r\nthe other guests, whilst Mrs. Grant, assisted by the husband of the\r\nwoman who honors the President by her exclusive attention, brings up\r\nthe rear, and after a slight confusion the guests are comfortably\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nWhen no parson is present the divine blessing is omitted, unless\r\nit be the Quaker thankfulness--the silence of the heart. In the\r\nbeginning of the feast fruit, flowers, and sweetmeats grace the\r\ntable, whilst bread and butter only give a Spartan simplicity to\r\nthe “first course,” which is composed of a French vegetable soup,\r\nand according to the description by those who have tasted it, no\r\nsoup, foreign or domestic, has ever been known to equal it. It is\r\nsaid to be a little smoother than peacock’s brains, but not quite\r\nso exquisitely flavored as a dish of nightingale’s tongues, and yet\r\n“Professor Melah” is the only man in the nation who holds in his\r\nhands the recipe for this aristocratic stew.\r\n\r\nThe ambrosial soup is followed by a French croquet of meat. Four\r\nadmirably trained servants remove the plates between each course, and\r\ntheir motions are as perfect as clockwork. These servants are clad\r\nin garments of faultless cut, which serve to heighten to the last\r\ndegree their sable complexion. White kid gloves add the finishing\r\ntouch to this part of the entertainment. The third “course” of the\r\ndinner is composed of a fillet of beef, flanked on each side by\r\npotatoes the size of a walnut, with plenty of mushrooms to keep\r\nthem company. The next course is dainty in the extreme. It is made\r\nup entirely of luscious leg of partridges, and baptized by a French\r\nname entirely beyond my comprehension. It will readily be seen that\r\na full description of the twenty-nine courses would be altogether\r\ntoo much for the healthy columns of a newspaper to bear, so we pass\r\nto the dessert, not omitting to say that the meridian or noon of the\r\nfeast is marked by the guests being served bountifully with frozen\r\npunch. As a general rule, wine is served about every third course.\r\nSix wineglasses of different sizes and a small bouquet of flowers\r\nare placed before each guest at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe dessert is inaugurated by the destruction of a rice pudding, but\r\nnot the kind which prompted the little boy to run away to the North\r\nPole because his mother “would have rice pudding for dinner.” It is\r\nnot the same dish which our Chinese brethren swallow with the aid of\r\nchop-sticks, but it is such a pudding as would make our grandmothers\r\nclap their hands with joy. Charles Lamb has made roast pig classic;\r\nProfessor Melah’s rice pudding is worthy to be embalmed in romance\r\nor story, or at least to be illustrated in _Harper’s Weekly_. This\r\nPresidential dish cannot be described except by the pen of genius,\r\ntherefore it can only be added that no plebeian pies or other pastry\r\nare allowed to keep its company. After the rice pudding, canned\r\npeaches, pears, and quinces are served. Then follow confectionery,\r\nnuts, ice-cream, coffee, and chocolate, and with these warm, soothing\r\ndrinks the Presidential entertainment comes to an end, and the host\r\nand his guests repair to the Red Room, and after fifteen minutes\r\nspent in conversation the actors in a state dinner rapidly disappear.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are discussing state dinners it may as well be remembered\r\nthat private citizens in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, in\r\nsome respects have equalled if not surpassed the White House in the\r\nelegance of their entertainments. In New York perfumed fountains\r\nexhale their liquid delights in the centre of the table, and this is\r\nas far ahead of that old mirror arrangement as the genuine surpasses\r\nthe imitation. No fault, however, should be found with Professor\r\nMelah, for as far as he goes, no officer of the Government performs\r\nhis duty better. At the same time it would be well for the Professor\r\nto remember that at an entertainment honored by the presence of women\r\nsomething besides the sense of taste and vision must be gratified.\r\nHe should imitate the Japanese in the perfection of his surprises.\r\nHe must make pastries out of which live birds will spring. Such a\r\ndish as this is none too dainty to set before President Grant and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Lincoln lived in the White House she dearly loved to have\r\neverybody know that she kept house in the Executive Mansion. If an\r\nentertainment was to be given she didn’t mind lending a helping hand,\r\njust as she would have done in that modest home in the “prairie\r\nland.” Martha Patterson saw that the milk-pans were kept sweet and\r\nclean, a matter of just as much importance in the White House as\r\nin the humblest wayside cottage; but now that this order of things\r\nwhich commenced with Martha Washington and ended with another Martha\r\nhas passed away, and the Government employs a man to look after this\r\nbeloved household, is it not a duty devolving particularly upon\r\nthe press to see that this officer performs his duty with military\r\nstrategy and perfection? Who has the authority to punish this man in\r\ncase the President’s digestive organs are impaired? Napoleon lost a\r\nbattle on account of a vicious dumpling. The greatest divorce case on\r\nrecord was founded on the following touching epistle: “Dear Mrs. B.:\r\nChops and tomato sauce. Yours, PICKWICK.”\r\n\r\nThere are no entertainments in England like the state dinners in\r\nthe United States. The Queen has her drawing-room receptions, which\r\nare not unlike the afternoon receptions of Mrs. Grant excepting the\r\nrigidity and frozen formality. A woman must have a court dress in\r\norder to be presented to Victoria; but a working woman in her serge\r\ncan take the President by the hand. The Queen asks whomsoever she\r\npleases, informally, to her palace, but she leaves “cabinet dinners”\r\nto her Prime Minister and the Speaker of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWomen are never included in these official dinners, but the same\r\nevening the wife of the minister or Speaker holds a reception, to\r\nwhich the families of the guest are invited, and the day closes with\r\nthe feeling that all have been entertained. It will be remembered\r\nthat Mrs. Thornton asked gentlemen only to meet the Prince at dinner,\r\nbut in the evening the ladies were assembled to honor the royal\r\nguest. At a regal entertainment only gold, silver, and glass are to\r\nbe seen on the tables. The King of little Hanover is said to have six\r\nmillion dollars’ worth of silver to set before his guests. The King\r\nof Prussia has for table ornaments mountains of silver from three to\r\nfive feet high, with deer climbing them, and huntsmen following, all\r\ncomposed of that precious metal. It is next to an impossibility for a\r\nmere traveler to be introduced to the King of Prussia. He cannot be\r\npresented through the American minister, as it is practiced in France\r\nand England. If the traveler is a distinguished citizen of this\r\ncountry the case is different, and Prussian majesty allows itself to\r\nbe approached. Men in official life are invited to dine at the royal\r\ntable in Prussia, but a woman in high life must await the coming of\r\na court ball, and then, if her rank is strong enough, she is shown\r\ninto the royal dining-hall and has the supreme honor of hearing\r\nhis majesty say: “How many wax candles do you think I am burning\r\nto-night?” The old King of Prussia was burning waxen tapers by the\r\nthousands, and he wanted his generosity appreciated. Century after\r\ncentury the etiquette of England and Prussia have followed in the\r\nsame groove. Certain rank has certain privileges as well defined as\r\nthe night and day. In France this stony rigidity is somewhat relaxed;\r\nbut the length to which this letter has already attained prevents any\r\nfurther allusion to the subject.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SENATORIAL SCENES.\r\n\r\nJOHN SHERMAN, ZACH. S. CHANDLER AND OLIVER P. MORTON IN THE LIME\r\nLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 12, 1870_.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the light of the sun eclipsed, or completely thrown\r\nin the shade, it is necessary to visit the Senate in night session.\r\nIn prosy daytime one’s senses are ravished by the bewildering beauty\r\nof the decorative art in this “chamber;” but thus seen only a magic\r\nhall pictured in the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainment” will compare\r\nwith the fairy-like beauty of the scene. Whence come the beams that\r\nsteep everything in a sea of liquid amber? No jetty flame is visible\r\nanywhere. The exquisite roof of stained glass gleams with a deeper,\r\nricher light than was ever borrowed from old Sol’s rays. In order\r\nto be disenchanted one must be told that innumerable little gas\r\njets cover the interior roof of the chamber, but the stained glass\r\nhides the ingenious contrivance from view. Who shall describe the\r\nsea of splendor that wraps and beautifies everything caught in its\r\nembrace? Under its influence grave Senators relax that stern gravity\r\nand austerity so becoming in a man upon whom half the dignity of\r\na sovereign State depends. During last evening’s session, Senator\r\nRamsey deliberately placed his hands behind him, apparently without\r\nmalice aforethought, marched across the floor, and patted Senator\r\nDrake on the head. But the most astonishing thing connected with\r\nthe performance consists in the fact that Senator Drake never\r\nquacked or even called the attention of the Senate to this strange\r\nproceeding. If in the course of legislation a Senator’s head must be\r\npatted, by what authority has a man the right to do so? Considering\r\nthe irascibility of Senator Drake, his behavior under the hand of\r\nSenator Ramsey was becoming in the extreme.\r\n\r\nIf there is a chestnut burr in the American Senate, it is found in\r\nthe person of Senator Drake, of Missouri. He bristles with sharp\r\npoints, like a porcupine. He is ever on the alert for his foes, and\r\nwhen found he hurls shaft after shaft, unmindful where he hits; yet\r\nthere is something so upright and true in the man that one forgets,\r\nas in the case of pricked fingers when a hoard of satin-backed\r\nchestnuts are brought into view.\r\n\r\nBut the shimmering rays of the evening light up a unique picture. In\r\nthe outer circle of Senatorial chairs may be seen the one occupied\r\nby the colored man from Mississippi. As yet it cannot be said that\r\na negro or black man has broken into Congress. Senator Revels has\r\nthe head of a bronze statue, and his hands are Anglo-Saxon. But the\r\ncruel weight of slavery has left its mark upon him. He brings to\r\nbear upon the tufted Wilton of the Senate chamber the plantation’s\r\nwalk. Slave idiom clings to his mellow, flute-like speech. He looks\r\nso lonely and forlorn in his seat, the first in the edge of the\r\ncharmed circle, just as if he had been washed there by some great\r\ntidal wave, which had retired, never more to return. Senator Revels\r\nis a good man, but not great, after the manner of Frederick Douglass;\r\nor keen as a Damascus blade, like Sella Martin, the editor of the\r\ncolored man’s national organ. And yet, in legislative attainments,\r\nhe compares favorably with the majority of the new Senators from the\r\nreconstructed States.\r\n\r\nThe Senators are talking about the “funding bill.” In the colloquy\r\nthe clear-cut face of John Sherman, of Ohio, comes to the surface.\r\nHe has put his shoulder to the mountain of finance, and how manfully\r\nhe tugs. Oh, the wear and tear to the understanding in the attempt\r\nto comprehend the money situation! A masculine biped whispers to\r\nhis next door neighbor, “Do you understand why they had a night\r\nsession?” Of course the little woman didn’t know. “It was to choke\r\noff all discussion and come to a vote. In the House they have a way\r\nof putting on the brakes, but in the Senate a man can talk and talk\r\nuntil he spins a cocoon out of his brain, through which he must eat\r\nin order to come back to common sense and terra firma. You see,”\r\ncontinued the man, “that the Senate is tired. It wants to get home;\r\nbut a few of the hardy swimmers will not give up the race.”\r\n\r\nSenatorial abandon takes possession of the hour. A Western Senator\r\nperambulates the floor, smoking a cigar, but there are very\r\nfew ladies in the gallery, and the cigar is daintily fragrant,\r\nconsidering its obnoxious origin. In the door of an adjoining\r\ncloak-room may be seen the broad, open face of Zachariah Chandler,\r\nand from its moon-like disc may be noticed small volumes of smoke\r\nescaping; but whether this fiery exhibition is the result of the\r\ndestruction of tobacco, or a mild volcanic eruption in a very\r\ndelicate region, there is no means of ascertaining.\r\n\r\nDuring the impatient conflict Charles Sumner is seen in his seat,\r\nsolemnly solemn as the sphinx. A woman whispers: “Did you ever see\r\nCharles Sumner smile? I did once, you ought to have seen it.” “Why?”\r\nasked her companion. “Because he looked so handsome. The smile\r\ntransfigured his countenance. I have liked his face ever since.”\r\n“May I never see him smile,” said the other woman. “I prefer to\r\ncontemplate this man in the Senate as I do the mountain in a picture,\r\nor as I would an Arctic landscape in a gloomy, sullen sea.”\r\n\r\nApparently weary of wielding the Vice-President’s sceptre, Schuyler\r\nColfax has slipped out of the honored chair to a lower seat, and\r\na Senator occupies his place. If a public man wants to be buried\r\nalive he can accomplish it by getting himself elected heir-apparent\r\nto the Executive. The Vice-President of the United States never\r\nhas a chance to read his name in the newspapers, and by the time\r\nhis four years are up the dear public have forgotten him. Oh,\r\nthe horror of riding on the topmost wave of popularity, and then\r\nsuddenly finding oneself plumped out of sight, actually buried under\r\na mountain of greatness. If the President would only die. But who\r\never knew a President to commit suicide, though he is perfectly aware\r\nthat another man has been actually prepared to take his place, and\r\nthat the people of this country will not suffer for the want of a\r\nPresident? The actual reason why the great body of American women\r\nare against woman suffrage is because they fear that some time in\r\nthe course of their natural lives they will be called on to act as\r\nVice-President. Schuyler Colfax was seen reading a newspaper at the\r\nfoot of his throne, and if he gets any comfort out of his position\r\nit must consist in holding the gavel suspended over the heads of the\r\nshining lights of the country. And yet there is no chance of bringing\r\nthese Senators to order, as in the case of the unruly members of\r\nthe House. The Senators are always in order; there is no chance\r\nof enjoyment for Schuyler Colfax except to crawl out of his seat\r\nand read a newspaper. And what does he find in that newspaper? Oh,\r\nsorrow and consternation! Dawes is ravishing the East with economical\r\ndelights, and Logan is cleansing the Augean stables of the House in\r\nwhich iniquity has herded ever since the Republic began. There are\r\ntwo positions which are alike, so far as the country is concerned,\r\nthe Vice-Presidency of the United States and that of a country\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\nIn the person of Senator Harlan, of Iowa, may be seen the presiding\r\nofficer of the hour. How admirably he becomes the sombre, dignified\r\nplace. Nature has cast this man in a noble mould. Broad forehead,\r\nclear gray eyes, and features as handsomely chiseled as if fresh\r\nfrom the hands of a first-class sculptor. Few men in the Senate have\r\nthe simple tastes of Senator Harlan. His personal presence would\r\nbe superb if it were not for the general appearance of threatened\r\ndisruption which marks his every-day attire. But, notwithstanding\r\nthe inclination of his coats to wear out under the arms and fringe in\r\nexactly the wrong place, no Senator at the capital is more beloved or\r\ntrusted by the people of his own State now residents of Washington\r\nthan Senator Harlan.\r\n\r\nThe funding bill still agitates the waters of legislation, and\r\nSenator Morton, of Indiana, arises slowly, leaning upon his cane.\r\nWhat subtle influence brings to the mind’s eye the picture of a tiger\r\nchained to a broken cage? Surely that powerful organization was made\r\nto last three-score years and ten. What a glorious casket! Away with\r\nthe cane! The pallor of his countenance is a part of the uncanny\r\nmockery of the night. There is no better speaker on the floor of the\r\nSenate. His thoughts flow fresh, clear, sparkling, like water from a\r\nhill-side spring. It is true, Indiana is a benighted State, morally\r\ndefective, as seen by her divorces; her territory swampy, with fever\r\nand ague a yearly crop. But which is the best harvest a State can\r\nyield? Why men, to be sure, and when this fact is considered Indiana\r\nneed not feel ashamed of herself.\r\n\r\nAt this hour of the evening the floor is thickly strewn with all\r\nsizes of fragments of paper. It rustles under the feet of the nimble\r\npages. Senator Wilson is opening his evening mail. He snaps the\r\nletter envelopes and hauls out the insides as gracefully as a bear\r\nscrapes honey out of a hollow tree. He is so earnest, and there is so\r\nmuch to do, and the sun will not stand still even for Massachusetts.\r\nHe takes the time to read the name only of his correspondents; the\r\nreading through these letters must be done by a private secretary.\r\nWhat a huge pile of papers menace him! Public opinion says he is a\r\nman of “practical talent.” Is not this the best gift bestowed upon\r\nman? Blessed, thrice blessed, is the State that has a man in the\r\nSenate connected by an electric cord to the least of her people!\r\n\r\nSenator Cameron is walking up the broad aisle, erect and stately as\r\na majestic pine in midwinter. This man is not one of the brilliant\r\nfigures of the Senate, but he is high like the mountains and deep\r\nlike the mines of the great powerful State he represents. Few, if any\r\nmen, carry greater weight in Senatorial legislation.\r\n\r\nSenators Conkling and Stewart may be seen in their respective seats,\r\nand these two men may properly be called the “blondes” of the Senate.\r\nIf these Senators were women they would have the whole masculine\r\nworld at their feet. It would seem as if the forces of nature\r\nconspired to keep them at a red heat, these men are steeped in liquid\r\nsunshine; their beards, at a distance, are the best kind of imitation\r\nof spun gold. Once a watery veined Senator was actually seen warming\r\nhis hands only a short distance from Senator Conkling’s head; but\r\nnotwithstanding this fact a handsomer man is seldom seen on the floor\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of strong-coming impatience. Senators pace the\r\nfloor as lions stride their dens. When will the interminable talk\r\ncease? No one heeds it. Senator Sprague is seen in a leaning attitude\r\nagainst the wall. The golden background helps to make a fitting\r\npicture of the young millionaire. His face has a marble pallor which\r\nthe rosy light of the chamber cannot dispel.\r\n\r\nVery few people are in the galleries. A few dusky faces may be\r\nseen at the right of the reporters’ seats. The diplomatic space is\r\nunoccupied. In the ladies’ gallery is the intellectual countenance of\r\nMrs. Secretary Cox. She is followed by a suite of pretty, youthful\r\nfaces. Mrs. Sprague is also present, superbly graceful as ever. This\r\nelegant woman is not only ornamental, but useful to the world. When\r\nshe is traveling amongst foreign nations her manners reflect honor on\r\nthe country that gave her birth.\r\n\r\nBut the gavel has sounded, and the night session ends.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBESON TEA PARTY.\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AWARDED THE PALM FOR ENTERTAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 22, 1870_.\r\n\r\nHumiliating as the task may be, it must be acknowledged that in\r\nevery race undertaken by the two sexes at the same time, for reasons\r\nwhich never can be explained, the men will manage to come out ahead\r\nin the exquisite art of millinery and dressmaking, where it would\r\nseem natural that woman’s nimble fingers and dainty tastes should\r\nrival the work of the fairies; yet stubborn facts bring us face to\r\nface with Monsieur Worth, the masculine milliner of Paris, who has\r\nstepped on to the throne, and by superiority of judgment has robbed\r\nwoman of her rightful heritage. “Ah!” said an American of rare taste,\r\njust returned from abroad, “you should have seen the dress prepared\r\nby this man for the Queen of Prussia. It was made of the simplest\r\nmaterial, being composed of grass and lace, but the lace was filmy\r\ntulle, almost as ethereal as the moonbeams, and the grass was soft\r\nand velvety, such as may be supposed to adorn the river banks in\r\nParadise. Over this faultless combination was flung a shower of\r\nseed pearls.” From whence did this man Worth get the pattern? He\r\nwent to Nature’s glorious book, just as all Earth’s children must\r\nwhen they seek inspiration. Dear reader, have you seen in the early\r\nmorning a handkerchief of cobweb glisten with pearly dew spread out\r\non the grass? Monsieur Worth has noticed this fairy work, and the\r\nhint enabled him to fashion a queen’s dress which was pronounced\r\nby competent judges to be the most faultless ever worn by royalty.\r\nDresses imported from Paris by the score may be seen in Washington\r\nsociety; but these costumes have not received the last touches of\r\ngrace from the hands of the great masculine dressmaker. Monsieur\r\nWorth has all the orders he can fill for such women as Eugenie,\r\nClothilde, the Queens of Prussia, Belgium, and others, without\r\npuzzling his dainty brains for the simple daughter of a Republic, who\r\nmay be somebody to-day but nobody to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThis letter is written, in all humility and sorrow, to prove that\r\nthe great social success of the season has been awarded (must the\r\ntruth be told?) to a man, and the citizen is known to the world as\r\nthe Secretary of the United States Navy. Whilst the President of the\r\nRepublic has tickled society with his levees, and the married men of\r\nthe Cabinet have held their receptions, Secretary Robeson, the jolly\r\nbachelor tar, has given a tea-party, and such a one as would make the\r\nWidow Bedott clap her hands with joy. No other woman in Washington\r\nin fashionable society would have dared ape the custom of other\r\ndays; but the gallant Secretary, after donning a mental armor as\r\ninvulnerable as ironclad, has sailed into the face of public opinion\r\nand won a victory as complete as McClellan’s capture of the wooden\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that at the tea parties given in the old times\r\nby the Widow Bedott the dear old snuff-taking stocking knitters\r\nassembled of an afternoon and talked their honest gossip by the light\r\nof the patient sun. But owing to the hard day’s work which has to be\r\nperformed by the Secretary of the Navy the company was not assembled\r\nuntil long after candle-light; but as candles are not as plentiful as\r\nthey used to be in the good old days of our grandmothers,--a modern\r\nsubstitute was found to light the mansion, by the flame of which\r\nevery wrinkle was visible on the faces of his guests.\r\n\r\nThirty persons attended the tea party, but the most astonishing\r\nfeature consisted in the fact that nearly one-half of the company\r\nwere men. It is true the Secretary is single and these men were\r\npossibly invited for protection sake; but what hindered him from\r\nstationing a squad of marines outside of his modest home, within easy\r\ncall, in case superior strength was needed? There is not a house in\r\nWashington fitted up so snugly and cosily as the home of the bachelor\r\nSecretary. Everything about it is suggestive of every-day comfort.\r\nInstead of heavy silken drapery at the windows, chintz, modest\r\nchintz, pure enough to smile on the dreams of a bachelor, shuts out\r\nthe sun’s too obtrusive rays. Chintz covers the luxurious sofas and\r\ntwines around the broad-shouldered, deep-chested chairs. All these\r\nhappy surroundings had much to do with the jolly comfort of the\r\nguests of the tea party. Two hours were spent dallying with music\r\nbefore the tea-room was disclosed. At the expiration of that time a\r\npair of folding doors were opened as if by magic, and in the offing\r\nmight have been seen a tea-table such as would have brought tears of\r\nenvy to Mrs. Potiphar’s eyes. It has been proved that the moon is\r\nmade of green cheese, and Secretary Robeson had a piece of it on his\r\ntea-table. Then there were muffins, crisp as a frosty morning, and\r\na pot of tea for which a war vessel had been dispatched with sealed\r\norders, and the captain, under threats of dismissal, was commanded to\r\nreturn within a given space of time, bringing from Japan the exact\r\nquantity of tea requisite for the occasion. It was also rumored, but\r\nthe writer cannot vouch for the facts, that the vessel brought over\r\na Japanese man to brew the tea, and, after the awful thing was done,\r\nthe miserable Jap committed hari-kari.\r\n\r\nBesides the pot of tea the table groaned under a huge weight of\r\ndainties too numerous to mention. Terrapins, quails, oysters, salmon,\r\nhoney sweet as that of the bees of Hybla, chickens broiled in the\r\nsame style as they are always cooked in Mrs. Southworth’s novels,\r\nconfectionery, and cream such as exudes from the Sacred Cow. But\r\nthis table was not to be approached except by those anointed for the\r\npurpose. In the room were sprinkled around tables of all sorts and\r\nsizes, from the dining cover, capable of supplying six to eight\r\npersons, to the modest light stand, which had been hastily abstracted\r\nfrom a chamber. The guests could seat themselves in any manner they\r\nchose, provided they kept away from the fountain of supply. At one\r\nof the little tables might have been seen a youthful pair in the\r\nhighest attitude of human enjoyment; there was just room enough for\r\nthemselves, and no more. It can safely be said that the bachelor\r\nSecretary did more in the match-making line that night than all\r\nthe manoeuvring mammas at the capital in the whole season. Some of\r\nthe tables accommodated four persons; others more or less. In the\r\nmeantime waiters performed their duty with the regularity of American\r\nwatches.\r\n\r\nBut if there is one person more than another at the capital that\r\ndeserves a national reputation it is the cook belonging to the naval\r\nestablishment of the United States. The sex of the person cannot be\r\nascertained, but this is of no mortal consequence so long as men and\r\nwomen are henceforth to stand on the same platform. Women have served\r\non the jury in Wyoming, which proves that the reputation of a person\r\nhas nothing to do with the sex. Secretary Robeson’s cook eclipses\r\nthe President’s Italian “Melah,” and Professor Blot is requested\r\nto keep away from Washington if he has any regard for his well\r\nearned laurels. Two festive hours were spent at Secretary Robeson’s\r\ntea-table. Conversation rolled as easily as a clean, smooth-bottomed\r\nwar vessel with a flowing sail and a rolling sea. When the guests\r\nfound themselves unable to hold any more tea they reluctantly wended\r\ntheir way back to the neglected parlors, where a band of music had\r\nbeen stationed to compose their sensibilities. It must not be omitted\r\nthat the wine and punch freely mingled with the tea, but this must\r\nbe looked upon as a modern improvement attached to a harmless old\r\nfashion. Dancing and the german completed the grand social success of\r\nthe season, and history will baptize it “A naval tea-party.”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELEGATES FROM THE SOUTHLAND.\r\n\r\nPLEADING THEIR CAUSE BEFORE PRESIDENT AND LEGISLATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 24, 1870_.\r\n\r\nBefore the late war a man’s life was unsafe south of Mason and\r\nDixon’s line, if he professed to believe in the abolition of slavery.\r\nThe same malignant spirit exists to-day. It is not safe to be a\r\nRepublican in many parts of the sunny South. In the sparsely settled\r\ndistricts men are shot and whipped for the offence of forming what\r\nare termed “Grant clubs.” Murder succeeds murder, and the offenders\r\nnever feel the hand of justice. Officers of the United States\r\nGovernment are assassinated in cold blood; but it is the helpless\r\nfreedman that is made to feel most the sharp edge of the situation.\r\nBefore the war, when this part of humanity had a money value, it\r\nwas different. The overseer on the plantation which belonged to the\r\nhusband of Fanny Kemble Butler said he generally managed “to work\r\n’em up once in seven years.” What has the freedman gained by the\r\nboon of liberty if he is still to be hunted and killed like the wild\r\nbeasts in the jungle? What hinders the Government from wiping out\r\nthe Ku Klux Klan of the South? Late Confederate soldiers have laid\r\naside the gray uniform, and now wear the mask of the inquisition,\r\nand their work is performed with the horrible secrecy of that\r\nmedieval conclave. General Grant has sent the Quakers to look after\r\nthe Indians. Why will not Congress enact a law to send General Phil\r\nSheridan and Colonel Baker on a mission after the Ku Klux to protect\r\nmillions who are as helpless as so many orphan children?\r\n\r\nWhen President Lincoln issued the proclamation of emancipation 5,000\r\nslaves were held in bondage by the Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians; or,\r\nin other words, three-fourths of a tribe of people held the other\r\nfourth as slaves. When the chattels of the Republic became free these\r\nbond people expected their freedom also; but this was denied them by\r\ntheir Indian masters because it was claimed that these masters owed\r\nno allegiance to the United States. A subsequent treaty was formed,\r\nfreeing the parties, containing two conditions: First, that the\r\nfreedman should have forty acres of land as their share and right in\r\nthe Territory, or in case they should leave the Territory they were\r\nto receive $110 each, and the Government was to reserve this amount\r\nof the Indian fund and pay it to those who chose to emigrate. The\r\nfreedmen desire to remain in the Territory, but the Indians will not\r\nallow them to occupy the land; will not permit them to have a right\r\nor privilege which an Indian is bound to respect. These patient\r\nmen and women, native Americans, born to the same heritage as the\r\nPresident of the United States, are slaughtered in cold blood. Oh!\r\nthere is no language strong enough to paint the hideousness of the\r\nIndian character. Was an Indian ever tame? These poor, forgotten\r\noutcasts of a distant Territory have sent a man to lay their sad case\r\nbefore Congress.\r\n\r\nA band of loyal Georgians are in Washington, praying that the power\r\nof the Government may be exerted for their protection. They have seen\r\nthe President, who did not hesitate to give them some kind, strong\r\nwords; but it remains to be shown whether Congress will hearken to\r\nthem. The delegation is composed mostly of colored men, with Governor\r\nRufus B. Bullock at their head. A meeting was called at Lincoln\r\nHall, by the citizens of the District, to show their sympathy for\r\nthe cause which these Southern men represent. Mayor Bowen presided;\r\nJohn W. Forney made the welcoming address; while Senator Thayer and\r\nRepresentative Maynard spoke some good, strong, manly words, which\r\nmust have brought the blush to Congress if Congress had been present\r\nto hear it. The great feature of the evening were the speeches made\r\nby the Southern men. Governor Bullock said little. Governor Scott\r\nof South Carolina, though unaccustomed to public speaking, made his\r\nshort sentences into arrows, and fired them at the audience with the\r\nprecision of a William Tell. Governor Scott has been a soldier. The\r\nexigencies of war stranded him on Southern soil. He has taken root\r\nthere, where he has grown into a goodly tree, and not a single Ku\r\nKlux has yet dared to lay the axe at the root of it.\r\n\r\nIt will always remain a secret “who struck Billy Patterson” and why\r\nthe noble governor of Georgia should be surnamed Bullock, for in\r\npersonal appearance he bears not the slightest resemblance to that\r\nfiery, untamed animal. It is true, he has a handsome shock of hair on\r\nhis head, but he is as destitute of horns as the administration is of\r\nknavery, and a better looking white man is seldom to be found.\r\n\r\nMost noticeable on the platform was Simeon Beard, chairman of the\r\nGeorgia delegation, a man whose superb oratory and strange personal\r\nappearance are most difficult to describe. Take away the prejudice\r\nof the race which, alas! descends to us in the same way as the color\r\nof our eyes or the length of our hair--a prejudice which education,\r\nprayer, or any other softening, refining influence of civilization\r\nnever can remove--rend this veil asunder, and we should see a man\r\nthat we could honor as President.\r\n\r\nSimeon Beard has the lithe, erect form, and the smooth, raven locks\r\nof the Indian. Both African and white blood course in his veins;\r\nhis complexion is that pale, rich brown--the same color with which\r\nnature loves to tinge the leaves in mid-autumn. But the spirit of\r\nsome animal long kept at bay looks out of his deepset eyes, and\r\nhis words burn as if they had been forged in a redhot furnace. He\r\nmade the audience feel the print of the nails in far-away Georgia.\r\nOnly a little longer will Frederick Douglass stand the acknowledged\r\nmouthpiece of the mixed races and the darker stratum which underlies\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSimeon Beard was followed by a Texan, Mr. Ruby, another member of\r\nthe proscribed family. How shall we describe this swarthy man, who\r\nappeared to be made up of sharp, glittering points, and who seems\r\nto bear the same relation to the human family that a dagger does\r\nto other weapons? He had the indescribable sway of the body of the\r\nchildren of the sunny climes. When his youthful face appeared it did\r\nnot seem possible that he had the essential requisites to address\r\nsuch an audience, but surprise gave way to admiration and applause.\r\nHe spoke in behalf of Georgia, asking nothing for Texas. “Why is\r\nit,” asked the speaker, “that the same atrocious state of affairs\r\ndoes not exist in middle and western Texas as in Georgia to-day?”\r\nLowering his voice until it hissed, “I’ll tell you; when a Union man\r\nwas killed a rebel was made to bite the dust. Only one man was shot\r\nin my neighborhood. He was a poor colored preacher who had started\r\na school. Some men disguised went in broad daylight and shot him in\r\nthe schoolroom. Mind ye, he was a poor man with no friends; but every\r\nman engaged in that day’s work was hunted down. We killed them as we\r\nwould so many reptiles (raising his voice until it sounded like a\r\nmusical instrument); that is the way we stamped out treason in our\r\npart of the world.”\r\n\r\nA colored man of polished education followed this fierce and war-like\r\nTexan. His words were admirably chosen. The glowing appeals flowing\r\nfrom the lips of Messrs. Beard and Ruby seemed like the virgin ore\r\ntorn from the rocks where it had been imbedded for ages. The smooth,\r\nhandsome sentences of Professor Langston fell from his tongue like\r\ncoin from the mint, each word having an appreciable value. Professor\r\nLangston is at present at the head of the law department in the\r\nHoward University. He was born in Maryland, of slave parentage,\r\nbut was emancipated at a very early age, and received a thorough\r\nclassical education through the indulgence of his paternal ancestor.\r\nAfter leaving college he studied law, and he now occupies one of\r\nthe most honorable positions in the country. Like all of his race\r\nat the capital, he takes the deepest interest in the welfare of\r\nthe freedmen farther South. The delegation earnestly asks that the\r\nBingham-Farnsworth amendment, which is tacked on to the last law of\r\nreconstruction, may be crushed in the Senate, as its passage would\r\nhand the loyal element to the tender keeping of the late masters of\r\nAndersonville and Salisbury.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURY TRIO.\r\n\r\nWYMAN, TUTTLE AND SPINNER GUARD THE TREASURY DEPOSITS--JEWELS IN\r\nSTORAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _December 28, 1870_.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time fabulous stories have been afloat in Washington\r\nconcerning the secret of the United States Treasury vaults. It has\r\nbeen whispered by certain snowy-locked clerks who have been noted\r\nfor years for strictest veracity that hidden away in the dust and\r\ndarkness of a certain vault might be found jewels that would vie\r\nwith or possibly eclipse those found in the diamond cave by Sinbad\r\nthe Sailor. Hidden away in the wooden boxes, it has been said that\r\npearls as large as pigeon’s eggs have nestled, their waxen beauty\r\nundisturbed by human eyes, whilst diamonds, both great and small,\r\nhave winked and blinked without awakening a shaft of feminine envy.\r\nIn this same vault it has been known that parcel after parcel has\r\nreposed, whilst hands that placed them there have crumbled into dust,\r\nand the mystery connected with them has been lost to this generation\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it must be mentioned that this particular vault\r\nis the ninth in the Treasury calendar, and it bears a resemblance\r\nto a bottomless pit, because heretofore anything under the head of\r\n“special deposits” placed therein has never been heard of again.\r\n\r\nAmongst other bits of dainty information, it may be chronicled that\r\nthe famous Field medal was placed here for safe keeping. Once while\r\nAndy Johnson was President an order came from “headquarters” to send\r\nthe medal to the White House for inspection. The medal left the\r\nbuilding, but was returned, unknown to some of the lawful custodians\r\nof the place.\r\n\r\nIt has been the habit from time immemorial to never disturb the ashes\r\nof the sepulchre; hence the Field medal rested, but no great harm\r\nensued. It is true, Andy’s reputation for a brief time was under a\r\npassing cloud, and the hardest worked man in the country was accused\r\nof not reading the newspapers; and here the mischief ends, because\r\nthe same plates were used to make a new medal, whilst the first one\r\nis worth its weight of precious metal, and only a small amount of\r\nhuman labor is lost.\r\n\r\nBut in order to have a thorough understanding of this mysterious\r\nconglomeration of metal, mortar and stone, a description of the\r\nmen who know the secret of the locks should be forthcoming. Nine\r\nlocks are concealed in the solid door, and each more desperate and\r\nsecret than the other. Three men only in the country understand\r\nthis wonderful combination, but as it is an established fact that\r\nno one ever dies or resigns in the Treasury, there need be no fear\r\nof a national calamity. United States Treasurer Spinner, Assistant\r\nTreasurer Tuttle, and Cashier Wyman are the men designated for the\r\nawful duty. As it would stretch this article to a most unreasonable\r\nlength to do anything like justice to the lives and duties of these\r\nfaithful public men, it is only necessary to say that General Spinner\r\nis the most honest, bluff, inflexible servant that the people ever\r\nemployed; that he gives out the same kind of metallic ring as one of\r\nhis own gold coins when properly tested. Assistant Treasurer Tuttle\r\nbears the same relation to the Treasury Department that one of Hoe’s\r\ncylinder presses does to a newspaper office, and that he is a rare\r\ncombination of faithfulness, strictest integrity, business talent,\r\nand hard work, is a fact never disputed in Washington. Cashier Wyman\r\nis the third man of the trio whose business it is to hold the awful\r\nkeys, and he guards the Treasury vaults just as Cerebus is said to\r\nstand sentinel over a remote region, though instead of three heads\r\nonly one is visible. Whilst Treasurer Spinner and his able assistant\r\nknow the secret of the locks, it is Cashier Wyman who daily performs\r\nthe necessary duties connected with them, and he who goes through\r\nthe awful door must pass his body, dead or alive. During the recent\r\ninteresting investigations it gave every indication of life.\r\n\r\nTreasurer Spinner says: “There is nothing in my Department that I’m\r\nnot willing the people should know all about, unless it is something\r\nunder seal turned over to me for safe keeping by the War Department.\r\nSome things are here subject to an order from the Secretary of War.\r\nI don’t know myself what is in the vault. I think the Secretary had\r\nbetter send some one, and, with others of this office, a thorough\r\nunderstanding can be had, and the authorities will know what is best\r\nto do in the matter.”\r\n\r\nOne gloomy afternoon the work of investigation began. The first\r\nobject that saw the light of day was a box as elfish as the one\r\ndragged from the sea by the fishermen, but instead of being made of\r\ncopper and fastened with the seal of the great Solomon, it was bound\r\nwith red tape and bore the waxen seal of some deceased Secretary\r\nof the Treasury. When opened it emitted an odor of dead roses. The\r\nfirst article lifted from the box was a heavy square bottle which\r\ncontained the attar of roses. A considerable quantity of the precious\r\nfluid had made its escape, but quite enough remained to perfume\r\nthe city, if this shall be considered necessary after the carnival\r\nhas passed away. There was no paper to indicate to whom this attar\r\nof roses belonged, but tradition says that some East Indian prince\r\nsent it to Martin Van Buren; that it had once been deposited at the\r\nPatent Office, and afterwards sent to the Treasury, in the year\r\n1848. The next bottle lifted from the paper wrappings contained\r\npearls. These were remarkably fine on account of shape, size, and\r\npurity of color. Two of the pearls were the largest the writer has\r\never seen. They were oblong in shape, and these two must have given\r\ncolor to the fancy “pearls as large as pigeon eggs.” As there was no\r\nway of counting these jewels, it was judged there might have been\r\none hundred and fifty altogether. The next article was a small vial\r\ncontaining diamonds. None of these were large, but they were very\r\nclear, and perfect in shape. It seemed as if they must have once been\r\na part of some royal necklace which had been stolen. As is usually\r\nthe case in calamities of this kind, the detectives only recover\r\nthe smaller stones. There might have been a thimbleful of diamonds.\r\nThieves evidently had been at work with the treasure, for in the next\r\narticle brought forth the golden lining of a snuff-box was missing.\r\nNext came a gold ornament which had once held together a pearl\r\nnecklace. The silken string and tassel attached to it showed its East\r\nIndian origin. This, it appears, was the article left to show that\r\nsome President or officer of the Government had been presented with\r\na pearl necklace. It had been placed on exhibition somewhere, and\r\nthieves made way with it; but in order to secure what was recovered\r\nbeyond all chance of future escape, the string and gold fastening\r\nwere laid in this box.\r\n\r\nThe next article was a tin box. There was no way to ascertain whether\r\nthe box was originally intended for pills or matches. There was every\r\nreason to believe that the original “Pandora’s box” had been found.\r\nBut on opening it there was discovered a sealed paper containing\r\ngems--thirteen small diamonds of the finest water and four large\r\npearls. A small piece of paper in a box had written upon it this\r\ninteresting bit of information: “These jewels had originally been\r\npresented to Martin Van Buren, but had been stolen from a case in the\r\nPatent Office on the night of November 8th, 1848.” These unfortunate\r\ngems convey the most useful lesson: If Mistress Van Buren had worn\r\nher jewels, instead of placing them where thieves break in and steal,\r\nshe would have set an illustrious example, and the country would\r\nhave been no poorer than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nThe second box opened contained counterfeit coins and dies. These had\r\nbeen deposited by M. C. Young, esq., and they had been received from\r\nagents employed to detect counterfeiters. These bore the date of May\r\n10, 1847. These counterfeit gold and silver coins could not deceive\r\nan infant of this generation. The first package opened contained\r\nConfederate bills, bonds, and small currency. The second package were\r\nthe spoils won by the United States in a law-suit. This bundle of\r\npapers was found to consist of bonds received from Messrs. Redin and\r\nFendall, per Henry May, amount $97,276.33, being the same received\r\nby them from Corcoran & Riggs on decree in case of the United States\r\nversus Gardiner. Bond to the State of Tennessee. Date of the oldest\r\ncoupon due, July 1, 1857. The treasurer gave Mr. May a receipt\r\ntherefor, and is directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to hold\r\nthese bonds until he shall decide as to entries, etc. Dated April 9,\r\n1855.\r\n\r\nThe third package was marked $24,963. Upon examination the mark and\r\nthe contents did not exactly coincide.\r\n\r\nThe fourth package contained bonds, loan of 1848, returned October\r\n10, 1857, marked $300.\r\n\r\nThe next in order came a box containing notes of the survey of the\r\nboundary between the United States and Mexico, under the treaty of\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo, from the junction of the Gila and the Colorado to\r\nthe Pacific coast, deposited by Brevet Captain Hardcastle, United\r\nStates Navy Topographical Engineers, June 11, 1852.\r\n\r\nFifth package, marked $3,059.64-100. On the outside wrapper was\r\nwritten: “Received of A. Smith, cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis\r\nby order of the Secretary of the Treasury the within uncurrent funds,\r\nwhich had been held by said bank on special deposit, consisting of\r\nuncurrent bank notes.”\r\n\r\nPackage No. 6 contained counterfeit State bank notes and legal\r\ntenders sent as specimens by M. J. E. D. Cousins, chief of police of\r\nSt. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\nPackage No. 7 contained Confederate bonds held subject to the order\r\nof the Secretary of War. Total amount, $12,050.\r\n\r\nPackage No. 8 contained the sad relics left by a defaulting Treasury\r\nclerk in his desk. The man’s name was E. French, and he was assistant\r\ndisbursing clerk in the Treasury extension. After he had absconded\r\nhis keys, papers, and money was safely lodged in the vault. The money\r\nconsisted of $50 in gold and $2.10 in silver.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA C. WOODHULL.\r\n\r\nHER MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS ON THE SUBJECT OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 11, 1871_.\r\n\r\nAt precisely the hour appointed Mrs. Woodhull was in her seat in the\r\ncommittee room, awaiting the appearance of the representatives of the\r\nlegislative body that had declared itself ready to hear anything or\r\neverything she had to say pertaining to why she should not be allowed\r\nall the “privileges and immunities belonging to citizenship.” To\r\nMrs. Woodhull alone, it is said, belongs the discovery of detecting\r\nthat, under the rulings of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to\r\nthe Constitution, women are entitled to the ballot. The members of\r\nthe Judiciary Committee are rather slow in getting to their seats.\r\nAt half past 10 Mr. Bingham might have been seen in his chair, his\r\nhands pinned closely to the back of it, and his expressive face\r\naglow with manly patience. On the opposite side of the table sat\r\nJudge Loughridge, of Iowa, leaning listlessly on his hand, his keen,\r\ngood-natured eyes alive with expectation. Judge Loughridge is fully\r\ncommitted to the movement, but as he is a single man, he is liable\r\nto be responsible for any amount of mischief. Mr. Cook, of Illinois,\r\nand Mr. Eldridge, of Wisconsin, only were in their places. As time\r\nwould not wait for laggard members, and the precious morning was\r\nslipping away, Mrs. Woodhull was reminded by Mr. Bingham that she\r\ncould proceed. At this time the room was sparsely filled, and nearly\r\nall present were women, friends to the movement, and the majority\r\nwere people from different States.\r\n\r\nAlmost hidden from sight in the deep recesses of a window might have\r\nbeen seen Nellie Hutchinson, of the New York _Tribune_, her piquant\r\nface and tangled hair as saucy and as refreshing as ever, and not\r\nfar removed from her was seen another pretty ornament of the press,\r\nin the person of Mrs. McChane, of the Philadelphia _Inquirer_. But,\r\narranged in a row behind Mrs. Woodhull were a number of women whose\r\nvoices have been heard throughout the length and breadth of the land.\r\nAt the head of the class stood Mrs. Beecher Hooker--her soft, fleecy\r\ncurls tied down with orthodox precision; the curling feathers of\r\nblue harmonizing with her peachy complexion. Her elegantly fitting\r\ncoat was embroidered with steel beads, but this had nothing to do\r\nwith the suffrage question. Susan B. Anthony snuggled beside her,\r\nclad in a smart new dress of black silk, with velveteen overskirt\r\nand fancy basque. Her spectacles clung to her nose, and she had that\r\nlonging, hope-deferred look which humanity always wears when it\r\nhas been centered for half a century upon a single idea. Then came\r\nPaulina Davis, her face surmounted by her beautiful snowy curls;\r\nthen Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing, the noblest woman in the land. Rev.\r\nOlympia Brown appeared modestly as the “Wall Street firm,” for both\r\nthe members were present, and distinguished from the other women in\r\nthe room by dress and other characteristics. The firm of Woodhull &\r\nClaflin are clad precisely alike, and call each other “sister.” Their\r\ncostume consists in what Miss Kate Stanton pronounces a “business\r\nsuit, because they are strictly business women.” These costumes are\r\nmade of blue naval cloth, skimp in the skirt. The basque or jacket\r\nhas masculine coat-tails behind, but the steeple-crowned hats are the\r\ntowering triumph of the most picturesque outfit. The high sugar-loaf\r\nhat has a brigandish dash to it, and the clipped hair underneath\r\nseems to have nipped all the feminine element originally possessed\r\nby this flourishing “firm.” Mrs. Woodhull arose and stood before\r\nthe tribunal. She is a medium-sized woman, with a sharp nose, and\r\nthin lips which closed tightly over her white teeth. She apologized\r\nfor any hesitancy in her manner, because it was the first time in\r\nher life that she had attempted public speaking. She then read her\r\nprinted memorial:\r\n\r\n  The memorial of Victoria Woodhull to the Honorable the Senate\r\n  and the House of Representatives, United States of America, in\r\n  Congress assembled, respectfully showeth:\r\n\r\n  That she was born in the State of Ohio, and is above the age\r\n  of twenty-one years; that she has resided in the State of New\r\n  York during the past three years; that she is still a resident\r\n  thereof, and that she is a citizen of the United States\r\n  as declared by the fourteenth article of amendment to the\r\n  Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n  That since the adoption of the fifteenth article of amendment\r\n  to the Constitution neither the State of New York nor any other\r\n  State, nor any Territory, has passed any law to abridge any\r\n  citizen of the United States to vote, as established by said\r\n  articles, neither on account of sex or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  That, nevertheless, the right to vote is denied to women citizens\r\n  of the United States by the operation of election laws in the\r\n  several States and Territories, which laws were enacted prior to\r\n  the adoption of the said fifteenth article, and which article is\r\n  inconsistent with the Constitution as amended, and therefore are\r\n  void and of no effect; but, which, being still invoked by the\r\n  said States and Territories, render the Constitution inoperative\r\n  as regards the right of women citizens to vote.\r\n\r\n  And whereas article six, section second, declares “That this\r\n  Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be\r\n  made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall\r\n  be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the\r\n  supreme law of the land; and all judges in every State shall be\r\n  bound thereby, anything in the constitution and laws of any State\r\n  to the contrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\n  And whereas no distinction between citizens is made in the\r\n  Constitution of the United States on account of sex, but the\r\n  fourteenth article of amendments to it provides that “No State\r\n  shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges\r\n  and immunities of the citizens of the United States nor deny to\r\n  any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\r\n  laws.”\r\n\r\n  And whereas Congress has power to make laws which shall be\r\n  necessary and proper for carrying into execution all powers\r\n  vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United\r\n  States, and to make or alter all regulations in relation\r\n  to holding elections for Senators and Representatives, and\r\n  especially to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions\r\n  of the fourteenth article.\r\n\r\n  And whereas the continuance of the enforcement of said local\r\n  election laws, denying and abridging the right of citizens to\r\n  vote on account of sex, is a grievance to your memorialists and\r\n  to various other persons, citizens of the United States, being\r\n  women.\r\n\r\n  Therefore your memorialists would most respectfully petition\r\n  your honorable bodies to make such laws as in the wisdom\r\n  of Congress shall be necessary and proper for carrying into\r\n  execution the right vested by the Constitution in the citizens of\r\n  the United States to vote without regard to sex.\r\n\r\n  And your memorialists will ever pray.\r\n\r\n    VICTORIA C. WOODHULL.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK CITY, _December 19, 1870_.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Woodhull had finished her memorial, Miss Susan B. Anthony\r\ntook the floor and told the committee that she had hurried as fast as\r\nrailroad and speed would allow her from Kansas, last winter, at this\r\ntime, in order to get a petition before this body, but after all she\r\nwas glad that Wall Street had spoken.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beecher Hooker now arose and said that after the subject had\r\nbeen presented to her in this light she had immediately written to\r\nMyra Bradwell, who was practicing law in Chicago, for a judicial\r\nopinion. She had also invited Mrs. Bradwell to come to this\r\nconvention and plead the case. Mrs. Bradwell declined on the plea of\r\nill-health, but at the same time she sent a written opinion of the\r\njudge of the Superior Court and had presented this to Mr. Riddle, one\r\nof the ablest lawyers in the country, and, at her request, Mr. Riddle\r\nwould now address the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Riddle arose and said he meant to say nothing save what would\r\nbear upon the case; however, he meant to say strongly what he\r\nintensely felt, and whoever would take the pains to examine the\r\nConstitution which he held in his hands would not attempt to gainsay\r\nthe facts contained therein. The right of suffrage is a natural\r\nright. The right of self-government pertains to all alike, the right\r\nto be exercised as all other rights. The right to dress is a natural\r\nright, and the right to consume food no matter how artificially\r\nprepared is another. What was necessary to bring the negro race\r\nto the enjoyment of their natural rights? It was simply to remove\r\nobstructions. Legislation can regulate the franchise but not prohibit\r\nit. Those who were content for women to vote must do it in one of two\r\nways--either get rid of the word “male” or define the meaning of\r\ncitizenship. A gifted woman has just given us an argument that can\r\nnot be refuted. This change has been wrought by an amendment to the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was interrupted by Mr. Cook, of Illinois, asking: “What\r\nclause of the Constitution would give us the right to allow Mrs.\r\nWoodhull the exercise of suffrage in New York?”\r\n\r\nMr. Riddle replied: “All persons who live under the Constitution are\r\ncitizens of the United States; those who framed it meant citizenship.\r\nWe have no half citizens.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker arose and said this term “citizen” had not been fully\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nMr. Riddle proceeded to say: “If you look into the dictionaries,\r\nyou will find it means an inhabitant of a city who is allowed the\r\nenjoyment of political rights. The fourteenth amendment claims that\r\nall born within the jurisdiction of the United States are citizens,\r\nand it also says no State shall make laws to abridge the privileges\r\nof citizenship. What does privilege or immunity mean? It means that\r\nNew York shall not do anything to abridge the privileges.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was again interrupted by Mr. Eldridge, of Wisconsin,\r\nasking, “Do you claim by this prohibition that the natural rights of\r\ninfants must not be interfered with, as well as idiots, who must come\r\nunder the law as you interpret it?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker answered, “That State may say when I may exercise it, but\r\nnot whether I may do so.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker’s lawyer then proceeded to read from law books some very\r\nsubstantial authority, but the writer could not see its application\r\nto the case. He then said two citizens of two different States had a\r\nlaw-suit. Delaware set out to know whether she had the right to rake\r\nthe oyster beds of New Jersey. In this suit the meaning of “citizen”\r\nwas thoroughly and carefully discussed, but Mr. Riddle did not let\r\nus know whether the Jersey oyster beds were raked. The eloquent\r\nspeaker went on to say that the right of self-government was older\r\nthan any amendment to the Constitution. The right of suffrage already\r\nexists, but it is not for Congress to define the full meaning of\r\nthe Constitution. The married woman’s fate is one of servitude. Her\r\nidentity is lost in that of her husband. She is his servant, and\r\nas such only is known to the law. If Mrs. Riddle were killed by an\r\naccident on the railway, I could only recover damages for my servant.\r\nBut, gentlemen, I leave the case in your hands after defining the\r\nword “citizen.” It is the natural person rounded and finished with\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker arose and said that it was not of so much consequence\r\nwhen the right came. For her part she would not allow men to vote\r\nuntil they were twenty-five years old. The one great power that\r\nkeeps a government alive is personal responsibility and personal\r\nliberty. She had heard people say that we could run our national\r\nmachine alone; but here comes the foreigner with his ignorance and\r\nhis ways so different from ours. When he first comes he expects to\r\nbe equal with the first in the country, but he sees his neighbor\r\nliving in a fine house, unaccustomed to labor, and the spirit of\r\nhatred is engendered. But at the polls, at least one day in the year,\r\nhe is equal to the greatest man in the whole land, and it makes a\r\nman of him. It teaches him to think that he is helping to frame the\r\nlaws under which we live. I used to think a man should be here ten\r\nor twenty years in order to understand our institutions, but now\r\nI would give him the ballot as soon as his naturalization papers\r\ncould be made out; and, gentlemen, when you limit manhood, you cut\r\nyour own throats. When, with God’s aid, the oak ribs were put in the\r\n_Mayflower_, he knew what was to be the result.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then arose and said few women have persecuted Congress\r\nas she had done, and she was glad that new, fresh voices were heard\r\nto-day. “But, gentlemen, I entreat you to take this matter up in\r\nCongress. You have let a petition, presented by the Honorable Mr.\r\nJulian, last winter, come to its death. When I went to Illinois last\r\nyear I told the people not to return Mr. Trumbull, for he had allowed\r\nthe same thing to take place in the Senate. I ask you, gentlemen, to\r\nreport this matter, so that I can lay off my armor, for I am tired\r\nof fighting. If Mr. Riddle had presented his argument in favor you\r\nwould not hesitate about your course. No woman has a fault to find\r\nwith the old Constitution. I begged you not to put the word ‘male’\r\ninto the amendment. I hurried from Kansas as fast as the locomotive\r\nwould bring me, but all in vain. I think that is General Butler I see\r\nsitting before me, though I never saw him before. I wish, General,\r\nyou would say ‘contraband’ for us. But, gentlemen, bring in a report\r\nof some kind, either for or against; don’t let the matter die a\r\nnatural death here. Make it imperative that every man in the House\r\nmust show whether he is for or against it.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker caught the last refrain as Miss Anthony sat down and\r\nsaid: “Pledge yourselves, gentlemen, that we should have a hearing\r\nin Congress;” but the gentlemen did not pledge themselves, and the\r\nmeeting between Mrs. Woodhull and her Co-workers and the Judiciary\r\nCommittee came to an end.\r\n\r\nMrs. General Farnsworth, wife of the member from Illinois, and Mrs.\r\nEly, of New Hampshire, represented the Congressional element of the\r\nHouse, but the Senatorial dames were unfortunately detained elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPREADING THE LIGHT.\r\n\r\nWOMAN’S RIGHTS DISCUSSED BY MESDAMES HOOKER, BLAKE, ANTHONY, AND\r\nOTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 12, 1871_.\r\n\r\nAfter the Judiciary Committee meeting adjournment, the leader of the\r\nwoman suffrage movement visited the Senate to hear Senator Sumner\r\non the San Domingo muddle; but two hours later found Lincoln Hall\r\ninvaded, and the inevitable ball set in motion, which Susan B.\r\nAnthony says never shall rest until woman is in the possession of\r\nevery right, both foreign and domestic. The sweet liquid voice of\r\nMrs. Hooker called the meeting to order, and the divine Olympia Brown\r\nprayed as only a woman can pray when she is thoroughly in earnest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paulina Davis was on the platform, one of the most queenly women\r\nin the court of intellect, and as beautiful and as exquisite as a\r\nwinter landscape. This woman is the possessor of great wealth, the\r\nhighest social position, and, to use her own words to describe her:\r\n“I care very little for dress; my tastes are very simple. But this\r\nmovement is very expensive. Last summer I paid the whole expense of a\r\nconvention in New York City. It cost me five hundred dollars. I don’t\r\nmind that, because in this way I think I am doing the greatest good.”\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony was in her place, for what would a woman suffrage\r\nconvention be worth without Susan to give it flavor? And then she is\r\nso patient and irrepressible, and has such a wholesome antipathy to\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nMiss Lillie Peckham represented the youth and audacity of Wisconsin,\r\nand Miss Kate Stanton the beauty and fire of her illustrious\r\nname. The people who had assembled to listen, proved, by personal\r\ninspection, to have grown higher in the social scale than those\r\nattending last year. Women were present who unmistakably were the\r\nheads of families--comely matrons who had left the pot boiling\r\nat home. Butterflies spread their wings there in the same way as\r\nthey would attend any other place of amusement, but the wives and\r\ndaughters of Congressmen for some reason stayed away.\r\n\r\nAfter the prayer, Mrs. Hooker introduced Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhull,\r\nwho commenced to say that she was not in the habit of speaking in\r\npublic meetings--a fact which her manner instantly proved. Although\r\nit would seem that a Wall-street experience would fit a woman to face\r\nthe worst, yet Mrs. Woodhull’s heart went pit-a-pat, and the blood\r\nrose and fell from her cheek as fortunes go up and down on ‘change.\r\nMrs. Woodhull read anew her petition to the Judiciary Committee, and\r\nthis being her solitary ewe lamb, after its presentation there was\r\nnothing left to do, and she quietly took a back seat.\r\n\r\nMrs. Devereaux Blake, of New York, was then introduced--a\r\nmedium-sized woman, rather pretty than otherwise, and very carefully\r\ndone up in handsome, fashionable clothes. Mrs. Blake, however, had\r\nnothing new to offer on the question under discussion. She rehashed\r\nthe subject of women carrying arms, and proved by the old argument\r\nthis was not a necessity; and then she told us of women’s sacrifices,\r\nand how, in extremest dilemma, they had sacrificed their hair. She\r\nsaid a woman’s life was love, and for this reason it was a great\r\nwrong to deprive her of that she loved best.\r\n\r\nAfter other weighty arguments of this kind this speaker melted away\r\nto give place to Miss Lillie Peckham, of Wisconsin. This young woman\r\ndid not attempt the difficult task of striking out a new path, but\r\ncontentedly ambled along over the old highway; but, nevertheless, she\r\nhad a very interesting, parrot-like way of expressing herself, and\r\nvery wonderful, because so difficult to imitate.\r\n\r\nAs the hour of adjournment drew near, Susan B. Anthony came forward\r\nand talked “business.” Oh, the inimitable, the delectable Susan; the\r\nwoman with a peculiar relish which one has to learn to love; the\r\nwoman of whom a very small piece goes a great way; the musk among\r\ndrugs; the acid in the Chemist’s laboratory! Susan has finished and\r\nthe meeting ends.\r\n\r\nThe evening session of the woman suffrage convention met at the\r\nCongregational Church on Tenth street. Before the hour appointed,\r\nthere was quite a gathering at the church, and the notables, as\r\nfast as they arrived, took their seats on the platform. With those\r\nassembled on the topmost round of expectation, the coming woman\r\nwas seen marching up the aisle, wearing the jolly form of Senator\r\nPomeroy. In the modest aspect of this distinguished man, one could\r\nsee the embryo of the first female President; and Senator Nye\r\nfollowing close behind showed that he meant to come in for the second\r\nbest time on record. All the lights of the morning were on the\r\nplatform except Tennie Claflin of the Wall-street firm. Miss Claflin\r\nmust be one of the most charming little brigands in Wall street,\r\nelse her peaked hat and chubby face tell a wrong story. Her merry\r\nbrown eyes twinkle like the peepers of Santa Claus or old Nick; and\r\nworst of all she keeps her mouth shut, and this proves the brewing\r\nof mischief. Tennie looks like one of the women in the picture of\r\nthe “Merry Wives of Windsor,” and she seems to be the one above all\r\nothers fitted to sustain her position in Wall street.\r\n\r\nSenator Nye arose to open the meeting. He said he had yielded to\r\nthe pressing invitation of a woman on the platform to preside at\r\nthe meeting, and had given a reluctant consent. He had never seen a\r\ngood reason why the mothers of voters should not vote. One thing is\r\ncertain, as mothers are elevated, so are the children; as women are\r\ndegraded, the rule holds the same. But he felt that he was out of\r\nplace in presiding over a meeting of ladies; that he was more in the\r\nhabit of being presided over by them.\r\n\r\nHe then introduced Miss Kate Stanton, of Rhode Island, as one of\r\nthe fairest daughters of the State. Senator Nye added that she had\r\nundertaken to work in a field where strong men often fail, but\r\nhe trusted, in her case, that she would meet with success. Miss\r\nStanton then came forward, half hesitating, her eyes brilliant with\r\nexcitement and true carnation in her cheek. This was the second\r\ntime in her life that she had faced an audience, and the ordeal was\r\nquite as much as she could bear. She commenced reading her lecture,\r\nand when she became accustomed to her own voice she glided along\r\ngracefully, as only a truly gifted woman can. Miss Stanton will be\r\none of the stars in the lecture field if she speaks equally well\r\non other subjects as the one at present under discussion. She has\r\na remarkably clear, fine voice, a most pleasing personal presence,\r\nan unusually cultivated mind, and the true vim of a young American\r\nwoman. It is true she did not give us any new ideas about woman\r\nsuffrage, but she treated the subject in a natural, girlish way; and\r\nif sentiment predominated, it seemed a halo around her head, for\r\nyoung people are romantic, and when they are otherwise, the gloss of\r\nyouth has gone forever. Miss Stanton’s great point in her so-called\r\nargument may be summed up in a few words. The laws made by man are\r\nfractional. The woman must be added to make the unit.\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Stanton’s logic was finished, Senator Nye introduced Mr.\r\nRiddle. The lawyer went over exactly the same ground traversed in\r\nthe morning before the Judiciary Committee. It is true he enlarged\r\nhere, cropped off there, but it was the same thing altogether. He\r\ncommenced by asserting that women were as broadly and deeply citizens\r\nas the men of this nation. That the right of government is a natural\r\nright. The right to govern is inherent in the people. That there is\r\nno right to be conferred, for there is nothing to confer; and that\r\nall who stand in the way would have to get out or else get crushed.\r\nMr. Riddle did not make his case clear, and the audience yawned in\r\nhis presence for applause.\r\n\r\nAfter he had finished, Mrs. Hooker arose and said she did not agree\r\nwith Mr. Riddle in his denunciation of men; that women equally were\r\nto blame for the state of things. “A great many women say they do\r\nnot wish the ballot, but I can prove to them that they do wish to\r\nvote. There are three vital questions equally dear to every woman’s\r\nheart: First, there is temperance. Are women indifferent to this?\r\nThen, there is education. Are not all women interested in the manner\r\nit shall be brought about, whether it shall be secular or religious,\r\nor whether education shall be compulsory or otherwise? And there\r\nis a third, of most absorbing interest, and this is chastity. The\r\nBible says, ‘The wages of sin is death.’ Sin is sin, no matter who\r\nis the sinner. In England, a country governed by a queen, has been\r\nthe battle-ground of great strife. It has attempted on behalf of the\r\nmilitary to pass laws that should make the passage of vice easy, and\r\nthe wages of sin not death. By some secret iniquity these laws passed\r\nParliament, and then the attempt was made to include the cities\r\nwith the military, but such women as Harriet Martineau and Florence\r\nNightingale, as well as those belonging to royal families, went to\r\nwork to prevent this great wrong. Petitions were gotten up, signed\r\nby thousands of the workingmen’s wives and daughters, and these\r\npetitions were brought to the feet of Parliament and they have, for\r\na time at least, prevented the wrong. France sends word to England\r\nthat her downfall in a great measure is owing to her social crimes.\r\nThis subject is now being agitated in our own country. St. Louis and\r\nCincinnati are shaking with doubts. Would you, women of America, have\r\nthe passage to iniquity and sin made easy for your husbands and sons?\r\nThese are the great questions upon you which we are obliged to think\r\nand speak.” When Mrs. Hooker finished, a kind of awe took possession\r\nof her hearers; and whilst this woman dwelt upon this last subject\r\nshe spoke with all the force of a Beecher and with the purity and\r\ndelicacy of an angel.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OPPOSING PETITION.\r\n\r\nSIGNATURES OF NOTABLE LADIES AGAINST GRANTING THE BALLOT TO WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 13, 1871_.\r\n\r\nA bitter contest is going on in Washington between the women who do\r\nwant their rights and those who do not. The following petition has\r\nbeen handed into the Senate, signed by a thousand of our countrywomen.\r\n\r\n  THE PETITION AGAINST WOMAN SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n  To the Congress of the United States, protesting against an\r\n  extension of woman suffrage:\r\n\r\n  We, the undersigned, do hereby appeal to your honorable body, and\r\n  desire respectfully to enter our protest against an extension\r\n  of suffrage to woman; and in the firm belief that our petition\r\n  represents the sober conviction of the majority of the women of\r\n  the country. Although we shrink from the notoriety of the public\r\n  eye, yet we are too deeply and painfully impressed by the grave\r\n  perils which threaten our peace and happiness in these proposed\r\n  changes in our civil and political rights to longer remain silent.\r\n\r\n  Because the Holy Scripture inculcates a different and for us a\r\n  higher sphere, apart from public life.\r\n\r\n  Because as women we find a full measure of duties, cares and\r\n  responsibilities devolving upon us, and we are therefore\r\n  unwilling to bear other and heavier burdens, and those unsuited\r\n  to our physical organization.\r\n\r\n  Because we hold that an extension of suffrage would be adverse to\r\n  the interests of the workingwomen of the country, with whom we\r\n  heartily sympathize.\r\n\r\n  Because these changes must introduce a fruitful element of\r\n  discord in the existing marriage relation, which would tend to\r\n  the infinite detriment of children, and increase the already\r\n  alarming prevalence of divorce throughout the land.\r\n\r\n  Because no general law, affecting the conditions of all women,\r\n  should be framed to meet exceptional discontent.\r\n\r\n  For these, and many more reasons, we do beg of your wisdom that\r\n  no law extending suffrage to women may be passed, as the passage\r\n  of such a law would be fraught with danger grave to the general\r\n  order of the country.\r\n\r\n  Should the person receiving this approve of the object in view,\r\n  his or her aid is respectfully requested to obtain signatures to\r\n  the annexed petition, which may, after having been signed, be\r\n  returned to either of the following named persons:\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Gen. W. T. Sherman, Mrs. John A. Dahlgren, Mrs. Jacob D.\r\n    Cox, Mrs. Joseph Henry, Mrs. Rev. Dr. Butler, Mrs. Rev. Dr.\r\n    Rankin, Mrs. Rev. Dr. Boynton, Mrs. Rev. Dr. Samson, Mrs B.\r\n    B. French, Miss Jennie Carroll, Mrs. C. V. Morris, Mrs. Hugh\r\n    McCulloch, all of Washington, D. C.; Mrs. Senator Sherman,\r\n    Mansfield, Ohio; Mrs. Senator Scott, Huntingdon, Pa.; Mrs.\r\n    Senator Corbet, Portland, Ore; Mrs. Senator Edmunds, Burlington,\r\n    Vt.; Mrs. Luke P. Poland, St. Johnsbury, Vt.; Mrs. Samuel J.\r\n    Randall, Philadelphia, Pa.; Mrs. Catharine E. Beecher, 69 West\r\n    Thirty-eighth street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  Please attach to this a paper for signatures.\r\n\r\nAmongst this proud array of titled names it will be noticed that it\r\nis not headed by our “first lady,” and that none of the wives of\r\nthe present Cabinet are enrolled amongst the same. When one of the\r\nleaders of this movement laid this petition before a Cabinet dame,\r\nasking her signature, this gracious lady answered, “I have all the\r\nrights I want; I find more than I can do in my own sphere of duties,\r\nbut this subject is too deep, and too broad to be acted upon, except\r\nafter the most serious reflection. Although I coincide with Catherine\r\nBeecher’s views, I think if we come out with our petitions we are\r\ndoing that which we so much condemn in the strong-minded. Besides, I\r\ndare not accept the responsibility of speaking for the poor and lowly\r\nof my own sex. Let them talk if they want to; this is a free country,\r\nand they have a right to be heard.”\r\n\r\nDuring one of the sessions of the convention, Mrs. Hooker alluded to\r\nthis petition, and said she was glad that women were beginning to\r\nthink. That anything was better than this apathy and indifference,\r\nfor just as soon as women began to think about the subject all doubts\r\nconcerning the success of the movement would be brushed away. She\r\nwas glad that Miss Murdoch had been heard upon the same subject.\r\nThese same strong-minded women had opened the platform to their sex,\r\nand they were willing that women should now come forward to help\r\nextinguish that power.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the last day’s session opened with every star of the\r\nmovement, both great and small, twinkling upon the stage, if we\r\nexcept one pale sister. This was the mischief, Tennie Claflin, of the\r\nWall-street firm. Susan B. Anthony, who means to be close-mouthed,\r\nhad opened her lips, and out came some useful information. She said\r\nthat Mrs. Woodhull had been up whispering in the President’s ear,\r\nbut just exactly what did take place at the White House would only\r\nbe known to those who were present. Mrs. Victoria Woodhull sat\r\nsphinx-like during the talk of Miss Anthony. General Grant himself\r\nmight learn a lesson of silence from the pale, sad face of the\r\nunflinching woman. Other women have talked during this convention,\r\nbut Mrs. Woodhull has read what she had to say from printed slips\r\nof paper. No chance to send an arrow through the opening seams of\r\nher mail. Apparently she has had little to do in this campaign, and\r\nyet everything has revolved around her. She reminds one of the force\r\nin nature behind the storm, and if her veins were opened they would\r\nbe found to contain ice. When money was needed to carry on this\r\nmovement, she headed the list with ten thousand dollars. She did this\r\nwithout the least emotion perceptible on her face unless it seemed to\r\nsay, “I have planted, but I can wait.”\r\n\r\nBut where was Tennie Claflin? The roguish, peaked hat and dainty\r\ncoat-tails were besieging the doors of Congress. Whilst women were\r\nwasting breath in the convention, she was anywhere and everywhere to\r\nbe found, where a worker ought to “turn up.” Oh, the irresistible\r\nTennie! Congress has never been so tried since Vinnie Ream succeeded\r\nin getting a stone contract, and if Tennie would be modest, and ask\r\nonly for ten thousand dollars’ worth of folly, she would win like her\r\npredecessor. If Tennie is bold, this quality in her is so original\r\nin its kind that it disarms criticism in the opposite sex, and Mrs.\r\nWoodhull must have chosen her for a partner for the same reason that\r\nshe whispered in the President’s ear.\r\n\r\nSenator Warner, of Alabama, presided at this session; but, as it is\r\nfeared that, sooner or later, he will become a woman, a description\r\nof his person may not be out of place. Originally he must have been\r\nas plump as a Baldwin apple; but the exigencies of the war and\r\nSenatorial duties must have had a trying effect upon him. Already\r\nsigns are visible of his shrinking in size, yet abundance of material\r\nis left for all family purposes. A pleasant sound issues from the\r\nside of his head, which Susan B. Anthony takes advantage of, at the\r\nsame time saying, “If men are not good for something in the ‘cause,’\r\npray what are they good for?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Halitz, a professor from one of the universities of Michigan,\r\naddressed the audience, and spoke in a very effective manner.\r\nOccasionally we heard the true click of the metal of oratory.\r\nShe is a small woman, but filled to the brim with the pluck of\r\ndetermination. She burdened the air with javelins of wit as well as\r\nanathema, and she sat down amidst a round of applause.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then arose and eulogized Mrs. Hooker because she\r\nbelonged to the Beecher family; and the State of Michigan on account\r\nof its universities. It had sent out more strong-minded women than\r\nany other State. She then proposed a good old-fashioned love-feast to\r\ndiversify the meeting.\r\n\r\nAn ominous silence prevailed for a little time; then Madame Ellis,\r\nclairvoyant and fortune-teller, proceeded to make herself heard in\r\na loud voice. She commenced by declaring herself a convert to the\r\ndoctrine, made so the previous night, but instead of reading the\r\nfuture fortune of the movement as laid in the horoscope of the stars,\r\nshe kept on talking as if she was only a common mortal. But she\r\nfinally reached the bottom of her mind and sat down, and Susan B.\r\nAnthony clapped her hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker then came forward and wanted Miss Susan to tell her\r\nexperience in Richmond. Miss Susan hesitated, for there was other\r\nwork to be done, but she finally began by saying that she saw twenty\r\nblack men in their seats on the floor of the legislature. She went\r\nthere to invite all the members to attend a meeting in the evening,\r\nwhere she was expected to speak. Some one of the legislature moved\r\nthat she might be invited to occupy the Speaker’s platform, but this\r\ncould not be accomplished unless the rules were suspended in order to\r\ntake a vote. A vote to suspend the rules was taken and lost--38 to\r\n29; but amongst those who voted in her favor was every black man upon\r\nthe floor. One of the white men upon the floor said if it had been\r\nFred Douglass, instead of a white woman, he would have got the place.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker read an extremely interesting letter from Mrs. Justice\r\nMorris, late justice of Wyoming Territory. According to this letter,\r\noffice-holding by a woman was a perfect success. Only one appeal was\r\ntaken from her decision, and that was decided in her favor. Mrs.\r\nMorris’s family consisted of a husband and three sons, and all these\r\nwere more willing to help her in official rather than in her domestic\r\naffairs. Mrs. Justice Morris was sixty years of age when she took\r\nupon herself the cares of official life.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPHOLDING THE BANNER.\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFRAGE CONVENTION AND ITS LEADING PARTICIPANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 14, 1871_.\r\n\r\nThe last evening’s session of the woman suffrage convention opened\r\nwith Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, on the stage. Although this\r\nSenator has greatest faith in Catharine Beecher’s views, it would\r\nbe in direct opposition to all the acts of his past life to turn a\r\ncold cheek to the appeal of loving humanity; so his broad, genial\r\nface stood out from its luminous background like the moon attended\r\nby its starry host. The first person introduced to the audience was\r\nMrs. Cora L. V. Hatch (now Tappan), and, judging by what followed,\r\nshe must have been entranced. It could not be ascertained whether\r\nor not her mental machinery had been wound up with the expectation\r\nthat it would run down at the end of a given period, but at any rate\r\nshe kept on ticking until Senator Wilson drew an instrument out of a\r\nside pocket, apparently for no other reason but to find out whether\r\nshe was gaining or losing time. Mrs. Hooker, in the meantime, looked\r\nanxious and weary, and Susan B. Anthony, like Banquo’s ghost, stalked\r\nacross the stage. This seemed to bring the “medium” to her senses,\r\nand she closed after it was known that she had been innocent of\r\nhaving anything to say.\r\n\r\nAs if to reward the audience for its late patience, Miss Anthony came\r\nforward to give it some food for thought. She said the object of this\r\nconvention is to prevail on Congress to decide on Mrs. Woodhull’s\r\ndefinition of the fourteenth amendment. “If we fail in this it is\r\nour intention to apply for registration in the different districts\r\nwhere we belong, and if we are refused this privilege, suits will at\r\nonce be commenced, and the case be followed up until it is decided by\r\nthe highest court in the land. But suppose we fail to obtain justice\r\nunder the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution, we\r\ncan go back to our good old sixteenth, and work until our undertaking\r\nis crowned with success.” She then read the name of a grand central\r\nworking committee, every name a well-tried, faithful servant of the\r\ncause. She said no name would be placed on that paper because she was\r\na Mrs. Senator This or a Mrs. Rev. That. The names were then read:\r\n\r\n  NATIONAL CENTRAL COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n  President, Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker, Hartford, Conn.;\r\n  Secretary, Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing, Washington, D.

Post,\r\n  Cheyenne, Wyo.; Mrs. Mary McCook, Colo.\r\n\r\n“The business of this committee is to go to work and get money to\r\ndefray the expense of printing documents. Congress will be asked to\r\nmake an appropriation to this end, but in case of disappointment from\r\nthat quarter we shall fall back on the national central committee.\r\nWe shall also ask the members to frank these documents, and we hope\r\nto fill Uncle Sam’s mail-bags with the same until they groan. Among\r\nall my acquaintances in Congress, I never found but one man who would\r\nallow me the use of his frank, and this was Brooks, of New York. Yes,\r\nCongressman Brooks. I know he is a Democrat, but I find Democrats\r\njust as much inclined to give us the ballot as the Republicans. And\r\nwhy should they not, for they are all of them nothing but men? She\r\nsaid the strongest kind of appeals would be made for money during the\r\ncoming campaign. Mrs. Victoria Woodhull had subscribed ten thousand\r\ndollars, and would any man in the country do the same?”\r\n\r\nMiss Lillie Peckham, of Wisconsin, was then introduced by Senator\r\nWilson. Miss Lillie confined her remarks closely to the labor\r\nquestion, and her efforts this time were a marked improvement upon\r\nthe last. She told her hearers all about the difficulties in the way\r\nof women when they attempt to enter the field of science and art.\r\nHarriet Hosmer had to go the length and breadth of this land before\r\nshe could find a college where she was allowed to study anatomy; Rosa\r\nBonheur was obliged to pursue her studies in the butcher shambles\r\nof Paris, and Myra Bradwell was not allowed to practice before the\r\ncourts of Illinois because she was a married woman, and as such could\r\nnot be recognized, in consequence of technicalities of the law. Ben\r\nButler had said that women should not hold clerkships under the\r\nGovernment because they were needed for wives in the far West; Mr.\r\nRodgers, of Arkansas, had introduced a law too infamous to mention.\r\nIn forcible terms she painted the narrow field in which women who\r\nhave no protectors must necessarily struggle and die. At the magic\r\ntouch of her voice thousands of lowly women left their wretched\r\nbasements and attics, folded their rags about them and stood on the\r\nstage. She went on to say, if the ballot improves the workingman’s\r\ncondition, in Heaven’s name why not the workingwoman’s? Are they not\r\nthe same flesh and blood, warmed by the same heat, frozen by the same\r\ncold, and subject to the same laws of life and death?\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Peckham had finished Miss Anthony came to the financial\r\npoint again, and appointed a committee of two persons to receive the\r\namount which any were disposed to give. Senators Wilson and Pomeroy\r\nmade their donation in the most modest possible way, and a few others\r\nfollowed the example, and this brought the woman suffrage convention\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that it was called and organized by three\r\nprominent women, and so far as it was a success it must be attributed\r\nto them. It is safe to say that the woman suffrage conventions at the\r\ncapital are steadily improving in social refinement and intellectual\r\nculture as they succeed each other year after year. Women with\r\npantaloons and men with long hair have taken the back seats, and if\r\npeaked hats and coat-tails are visible, these badges are confined\r\nexclusively to Wall street, and there may be a necessity for the\r\npeaked hats in this awful locality which the innocent world knows\r\nnothing about. Senators of the United States have presided at every\r\nsession, and quite a number of members have attended the meetings\r\nfrom time to time. Occasionally the head of a bureau has peeped out\r\nfrom the audience, and a slight sprinkling of clerks has been noticed\r\nnow and then, whilst the most perfect order has reigned from the\r\nbeginning to the end.\r\n\r\nWhen the question was asked Miss Kate Stanton, why the woman\r\nsuffragists did not bring all their weapons to bear upon the women of\r\nthe country, instead of wasting their ammunition upon the men, she\r\nreplied: “It is of no use; we must make the movement popular with the\r\nmen, and they will educate the women up to it.”\r\n\r\nOwing to the misfortune that some of the delegates from a long\r\ndistance did not reach Washington in time for the convention, a\r\nmeeting took place in the lecture-room of the Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociation building the following day. No business of importance\r\ntook place. Mrs. Brooks, a small, timid woman, undertook to give a\r\nreport of what was progressing in the West. But this she found was\r\ntoo much for her modesty, so she gave way for one of the masculine\r\ngender by the name of Jones, who feelingly gave the Western picture.\r\nMrs. Post, of Wyoming, gave her experience of voting, and this of\r\nnecessity was very interesting. She had “electioneered,” been to\r\ncaucus meetings and to the polls side by side with the men, and,\r\nso far as she knew, her womanhood was just as good as ever, and\r\nmatters had become greatly improved since woman suffrage was a fixed\r\nfact in Wyoming. Miss Anthony followed in one of her best speeches.\r\nMiss Peckham said that Senator Carpenter, of Wisconsin, was fully\r\ncommitted to the cause, and Mrs. Josephine Griffing was willing to\r\npledge herself for the District. Mrs. Pauline Davis eulogized Rhode\r\nIsland, and Mrs. Hazlett, of Michigan, spoke in her usual bright,\r\ncrispy way. She said she would present her name for registration\r\nunder the law of the fourteenth amendment, and had no fear as to the\r\nresult. Mrs. Dr. Lockwood moved a vote of thanks to the reporters\r\nof the Washington press for their courtesy, kindness, and ability\r\ndisplayed during the convention, and the meeting adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPIONS OF THE SUFFRAGE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nMRS. LUCRETIA MOTT, MRS. CADY STANTON, AND MRS. JOSEPHINE S. GRIFFING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 19, 1871_.\r\n\r\nStirring events are shaking the national capital. Scarcely have the\r\ncolored lights of the country folded their tents and stolen away from\r\ntheir convention before Washington is visited by another dazzling\r\nmeteoric shower. To-day, the great national woman’s rights convention\r\nhas met and occupies its position upon the world’s stage. Senator\r\nPomeroy, of Kansas, seems to be the central figure around which this\r\nplanetary system of women revolve. As early as 10 o’clock a. m. a\r\ngreat number of the so-called weaker sex were seen hurrying along\r\ntoward Carroll Hall, the place designated for the meeting. It was\r\nobserved by all that these early comers were not those sisters of the\r\ncommunity who wear silk and satin, and who fare sumptuously every\r\nday. They seemed to come from the even plain of society; they seemed\r\nto be the wives and daughters of the thrifty tradesmen and well-to-do\r\nmechanics. Some of them came in timidly, and took seats near the\r\ndoor, while others marched in boldly, being handsomely flanked\r\nor guarded by the “lords of creation.” Curiosity and suppressed\r\nmirthfulness characterized the appearance of the latter; at the same\r\ntime these men had provided themselves with newspapers, into which\r\nthey could plunge whenever it should seem the most convenient thing\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIn a little side room at the right hand of the platform were gathered\r\na handful of combustibles of sufficient strength and tenacity of\r\npurpose to move the world, if, like Archimedes, they had only a point\r\nupon which to place the fulcrum. This fulcrum appeared to them to\r\nbe the ballot. Before the patience of the medium-sized audience was\r\nentirely exhausted, Senator Pomeroy filed out of the side room,\r\nfollowed by the venerable Lucretia Mott, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\nMiss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing, and a host of\r\nlesser lights; some few of the latter shining on the platform by\r\nreflection alone.\r\n\r\nAs it may be possible that some of the readers of the _Republican_\r\nhave never seen Pomeroy, a brief description of the man so long\r\nidentified with this movement may not be out of place. It must\r\nfirst be acknowledged that he stood alone on the platform with this\r\nhandful of pioneer women by his side. We mean by this that no other\r\nCongressmen were gathered there. Though Senator Pomeroy has not\r\nadvanced to the snows of age, he has outlived the fiery turbulence of\r\nmanhood. Nature did not cast him in her finest mould, but she gave\r\nhim breadth of shoulder, and a brow broad and capacious enough for\r\nJupiter; a brown eye, which twinkles as steadily as a fixed star; a\r\ngood-sized American nose, and a mouth which has ever been devoted\r\nto the cause of the gentler sex, and which any woman of taste would\r\napprove. Senator Pomeroy called the meeting to order, and then\r\nremarked, “While one plants and another sows, it is God who giveth\r\nthe increase.”\r\n\r\nPrayer followed by the Rev. Dr. Gray, who committed the sad mistake\r\nof alluding to the scripture verse which says that woman was made\r\nof the rib of a man. As soon as the prayer was finished, a Mrs.\r\nDavis, of Philadelphia, undertook to take exception to the prayer,\r\nbut Mrs. Lucretia Mott said though the audience might differ in the\r\ntheological views, she questioned the good taste of discussing the\r\nsubject at this convention. This was oil to the troubled waters,\r\nand peace followed forthwith. A very mother in Israel seemed this\r\nvenerable woman, now advanced beyond her eightieth year. As she\r\nappeared before the audience in her prim Quaker garb, her voice,\r\npure and distinct as the notes of a bell, seemed more like the\r\ntones of a spirit issuing from some crumbling ruin than that of a\r\nrepresentative woman on the world’s stage to-day. Those who remember\r\nThaddeus Stevens in his last days will recall a striking resemblance,\r\nboth mental and physical, between these two individuals of a past\r\ngeneration, both belonging to the same State of the Union. Miss Anna\r\nDickinson is very much like Mrs. Mott, and it may be well to remember\r\nthat only the Quaker element, which centuries ago made it just as\r\nproper for the women to speak in public as the men, could produce two\r\nsuch marvels of oratory.\r\n\r\nFollowing in the wake of Mrs. Lucretia Mott, up rose the brilliant\r\nMrs. Cady Stanton, of the Revolution, one of the most beautiful and\r\nsocially gifted women of the day; also a very firebrand in the camp\r\nof the enemy. What the poet says about roses in the snow finds a\r\nliving embodiment in Mrs. Stanton. Have you never seen the heavens\r\naglow with purple and gold before the sunset? And who would exchange\r\nthese mellow beams for the pale, weak morning rays, or the sultry,\r\nstifling noon? Now add a voice of rare melody, sweet, persuasive,\r\nand enchanting as a flute, and you see a woman as potent in her way\r\nas Queen Elizabeth; an intellectual princess “to the manor born,”\r\nand who is fated to fill a niche in the history of our Republic. And\r\nnow, reader, you see before you a woman stern, solid, aggressive.\r\nHer whole personnel is suggestive of the power of nature, strength,\r\nforce. You can not help but feel that the good Dame Nature for once\r\nmade a blunder. She put a man’s head on a woman’s shoulders; the\r\nmassive brain and square brow, the large gray eyes that are set\r\nat cross purposes with each other, the clear cut, thinly chiseled\r\nlips, that, when brought together, seem to have the firm grip of a\r\nvise; a woman to command; a woman to suffer and die for opinion’s\r\nsake. Reader, you see Susan B. Anthony. You see the woman who would\r\ngo to the edge of a fiery caldron, or a Democratic convention, to\r\naccomplish a purpose. If there is a pillar of strength among woman,\r\nupon which the weak, the degraded, the down-trodden can lean, it\r\nmust be upon Miss Susan B. Anthony. If every State in the Union\r\nwere blessed with two such women, the existing factions between the\r\nsexes would suddenly expire. Miss Anthony is a fine public speaker,\r\nchoosing her words daintily from the pure Anglo-Saxon, and her voice\r\nis just the kind an orator would desire.\r\n\r\nAnother woman arises to address the audience. It is Mrs. Josephine\r\nS. Griffing, so long identified with the Freedmen’s Bureau. A\r\nfine-faced, sweet-voiced, elegant woman. You feel that she is\r\nthoroughly in earnest. You seem to know that she is the last one who\r\nwould seek notoriety. You feel that you are listening to a woman who\r\nhas to fight the battle of life for herself and little ones alone.\r\nIn the depths of your heart you realize that it is such as she\r\nwho breathe the breath of life into this unpopular cause; and her\r\nwell-chosen words sink into your soul like dew in the honeyed corolla\r\nof a flower. If space would admit, other pictures might be added, but\r\nthese shall be reserved for another day.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. GRANT’S TUESDAY AFTERNOONS.\r\n\r\nJESSIE BENTON FREMONT AMONG THE NOTABLES IN THE BLUE ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 31, 1871_.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable season at the capital is in the full meridian of\r\nglory. Every working day of the week is devoted by the beau monde\r\nto dissipation. Feminine faces seamed with the scars of sleepless\r\nnights are the rule, and plump, rosy cheeks the exception. All is\r\nglare, glitter and pomp, and nothing home-like and substantial.\r\nOne social gathering is like another, except that the women change\r\ntheir dresses; but the ideas afloat upon all occasions are precisely\r\nthe same. An exhibition of the weather takes place every day,\r\nconsequently one topic of conversation can not be exhausted. Another\r\nsubject, as Bret Harte would say, “never peters out.” Women who go to\r\nreceptions must be “dressed;” consequently the taste, the quality,\r\nthe cost of each other’s costumes afford endless food for comment.\r\nWhilst the season lasts there is no time for reading, sensible\r\nconversation, or reflection. The fashionable wife of a Senator has\r\nnot time to rest her corporeal frame before a fresh demand is made\r\nupon her nervous and vital forces. In other cities of the Union the\r\nmansions of the opulent and hospitable are thrown open because the\r\nhost and hostess desire to see their guests. In Washington this\r\norder of things is reversed. Entertainments are official instead of\r\nsocial, and the magnificent card reception of a Cabinet minister is\r\nas cold and formal as a President’s levee. Receptions of every kind\r\nseem to be cast in the same cruel and relentless mould. Whilst it is\r\nnot expected that President Grant should stop the ceremonies of a\r\nlevee to introduce Jones to Brown, it would seem that a Senator’s\r\nwife, at an afternoon reception in her own little, quiet parlor\r\nat a boarding-house or hotel, would make her two or three guests\r\nacquainted for the time being, even though these women were foes\r\never after. But no introductions take place. The hostess must be a\r\nwonderful woman to keep three shuttles of conversation going without\r\noccasionally breaking threads. On account of these difficulties many\r\nof the “leaders” in the gay season invite a few particular friends\r\nto help carry on the tasks of reception day. Mrs. Grant set the\r\nexample by inviting a number of ladies to preside at her “Tuesday\r\nafternoons.” But in order to make everything perfect the wife of the\r\nPresident orders the reserve force to come down at the last end of\r\nthe battle. This battalion consists of General Grant and as many of\r\nthe Cabinet officers as choose to follow, and if General Dent comes\r\ntrickling after in his yellow kids there is nothing left to be done\r\nexcept for the sun and moon to stand still until the performance is\r\nover. In order to fortify the ladies for the afternoon’s work Mrs.\r\nGrant provides a dainty lunch beforehand, in the family dining-room.\r\nA spotless cover of white linen is spread over the national mahogany.\r\nUpon this pearly foundation rest rare and fragrant hothouse exotics.\r\nFruits rifled from the trees of the tropics, luscious oysters from\r\nthe smiling Chesapeake, sardines from the limpid Mediterranean, and\r\npastry concocted by the “incomparable Melah” lend their charms to\r\ngrace the feast provided by our “first lady” for the maids of honor\r\nwhen they go to the White House to grace reception day. Being only\r\nmortal, like the rest of us, it does sometimes happen that Mrs.\r\nGrant and her accomplished assistants linger a little too long over\r\nthe nutritious chocolate and Bahei; consequently, callers assemble\r\nin the East Room and stamp their feet with impatience because the\r\nperformance does not commence.\r\n\r\nAt last the hour has arrived, the doors of the “Blue Room” are thrown\r\nopen, and the play begins. Daylight has been as carefully excluded as\r\nif it had thievish propensities. An immense chandelier hung in the\r\ncentre of the room throws a fitful glare over the enchanted scene.\r\nBlue and gold everywhere. Blue satin damask masks the walls; blue\r\nvelvet carpet under the feet; blue and gold upholstery scattered\r\nprofusely around. Baskets of natural flowers make the air fragrant\r\nwith faintest perfume. Mrs. Grant stands near the entrance, with\r\nGeneral Michler, master of ceremonies, at her left, and her maids\r\nof honor at her right. General Michler’s face lights up with real\r\njoy at the delightful prospect before him. Not a woman of the vast\r\nincoming throng, be she hag or beauty, but must come in contact with\r\nhim before she reaches the Mecca of her hopes. Mrs. Grant, one of the\r\nmost amiable and excellent of women, looks as if she meant to make\r\neverybody welcome, and she puts so much hearty good feeling into a\r\nhand-grasp that she would certainly lose caste in the fashionable\r\nworld if she was not safely intrenched behind an impregnable\r\nfortress. She is clad in a heavy, pearl-colored brocade, embroidered\r\nwith field flowers and modestly trimmed with point lace. Mrs. Grant\r\nhas never been accused of being a beauty, and yet there may be seen\r\nin her person a great many points which help to make the handsome\r\nwoman. She has a very fine figure, and an arm as beautiful as Mrs.\r\nSlidell’s (and the Greek Slave statue was modeled upon the plan of\r\nthis elegant Creole rebel). Mrs. Grant has an exquisite complexion,\r\nlovely hair, and a sincere, unaffected manner, which endears her to\r\nevery personal acquaintance. General Grant thinks her beautiful,\r\nand, as he is the highest authority in the nation, this question is\r\nsettled. Now let the country hold its peace.\r\n\r\nNext to the “first lady” stands the superb wife of the Secretary of\r\nState. She is clad in palest of lavender, richly ornamented with\r\nduchess lace. Mrs. Fish is a fine, queenly looking woman, of middle\r\nage. Time has gently touched her, for her figure is as erect, her\r\ncomplexion as faultless, and her eyes as bright as in the days of her\r\ngirlhood. A Long Island acquaintance of Mrs. Grant is also assisting\r\nto receive. She is rather pretty, and is becomingly dressed in pink\r\nsilk, underneath white muslin and lace.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Judge Dent is also lending a helping hand in the\r\nceremonies. She is a Southern woman by birth, and the mistress of\r\nall those charms for which the daughters of sunny climes are noted.\r\nShe is clad in lemon-colored silk, and her person makes a delightful\r\nplace for the eye to rest upon after long and severe wanderings.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the brilliant wife of General Horace Porter\r\nmakes up the group. She is a dazzling little woman, with pearly\r\nteeth, all her own. She may be an American, but she looks like a\r\nFrench woman. Her costume is made up of pink and blue, the two colors\r\nshaded with an artist’s brush. She is talking to some friend about\r\nthe “baby left at home,” which proves that Horace Porter is consoled\r\nin his difficult position by a very sweet wife and a thoughtful\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThe guests have begun to assemble, not only in scores, but hundreds.\r\nConspicuous in the throng, towering like a palm in an oasis, might\r\nhave been seen the majestic form of Sir John Rose, of Canadian fame.\r\nHis fine old English face seemed alive with festive animal spirits,\r\nsound health, and the good results of a long temperate life. He might\r\nhave been thinking of the solution of the fishery difficulties, but\r\nhis eyes did not betray the least fishy appearance as they rested\r\nupon the fair faces and fine forms of our countrywomen. He remained\r\nonly a short time, but was spirited away by some member of one of the\r\nforeign legations. About the time of the appearance of Sir John Rose\r\nthe President and Cabinet, with the exception of General Belknap,\r\ndescended from some unknown region and enlivened the brilliancy of\r\nthe afternoon. General Grant appeared in a plain working suit,\r\nand his manner from the first betrayed business. Whilst he seemed\r\nwilling to take every fairy by the hand, he was very careful at the\r\nsame moment to look in an opposite direction. It might be possible\r\nthat this was a mere political dodge to gain time to be prepared\r\nfor woman suffrage; at any rate, no delicate creature could have\r\nleft the Executive presence feeling that she had been particularly\r\nfavored, and the most perfect gossip present pronounced his manner\r\nnoncommittal, as usual. In close proximity to the Chief Magistrate\r\nmight have been noticed the slender scion of a famous stock, in the\r\nshape of the quaint form of Secretary Boutwell, of Massachusetts.\r\nThere seemed to be nothing dangerous in the appearance of the\r\ndistinguished financier except the immense size of his feet. However,\r\nto set the mind of the country aright in regard to the foundation of\r\nthe national finances, it is here declared, upon highest authority,\r\nthat Secretary Boutwell’s extremities are precisely like other men’s,\r\nbut the huge boots have been purposely built to frighten away female\r\napplicants for office, and bold impertinent Congressmen. Secretary\r\nBoutwell has a fine face, a gracious presence, and can be ornamental\r\nat times, as well as useful.\r\n\r\nFar away in the offing might have been seen a jolly “iron-clad” who\r\nis well known in Washington society as the gallant Secretary of the\r\nNavy. No telescope was necessary to see him cruising about, with\r\nhis main-sail handsomely squared, and his jib-boom set in the right\r\ndirection. All at once he changes his course and bears down upon a\r\nmodest little craft that seems entirely unaware of danger. Ugh! it is\r\nall over! No lives lost! They have bespoken each other on the wild\r\nwaters of conversation, and each hurries forward to a different port.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished women who paid her respects to Mrs.\r\nGrant, and honored the large assembly, was Mrs. Jessie Benton\r\nFremont, the better part of the great “Pathfinder,” of Pacific\r\nRailroad fame. General Fremont may have found a great many wonders\r\nin his terrific exploration, but the best thing he ever did find is\r\n“Jessie,” and if he is ever crowned with immortal bays, it will be\r\nbecause in their youth they ran away. Although Mrs. Fremont is below\r\nthe average height of her countrywomen, she has a royal presence and\r\na queenly face. Neither paint, powder, nor any other artifice of\r\nthe age conceals or enhances the mischief time has wrought with her\r\nfeatures, and her head is crowned with an abundance of snowy hair,\r\nbut her countenance is lighted up by a pair of brilliant eyes, and\r\nthe dimples that enchanted the “Pathfinder” still remain.\r\n\r\nHow shall we manage to get space in _The Press_ to describe the wives\r\nof Congress? Every adjective and adverb in the dictionary might be\r\nused and the work not then be accomplished. One most noticeable fact\r\nin relation to the receptions of the winter is the wearing of last\r\nyear’s costumes. Very few new dresses are seen, and black silk was\r\nworn by nine-tenths of the ladies who went to Mrs. Grant’s reception.\r\nA very few trains were seen, but walking-dresses were the rule and\r\nlong dresses the exception. A great many hats were worn, but the most\r\nelegant toilettes were finished by bonnets. Mrs. Hunter, wife of the\r\nMajor-General, wore a black silk dress and a white satin bonnet;\r\nand Mrs. Cresswell, wife of the Postmaster General, wore the usual\r\nhabiliments of the season. It will be noticed that the taste of\r\nAmerican women is becoming more chaste and refined. Visiting suits\r\nare sombre; rich high colors are reserved for the evening. But more\r\nof this anon.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDYING SCENES OF THE FORTY-FIRST CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nVINNIE REAM SECURES AN ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION FOR HER STATUE OF\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 2, 1871_.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of appropriation bills legislative work appears\r\nto have come to an end. The mildew of dissolution is approaching,\r\nand for the moment the whole strength of the House seems to be in a\r\nseething state of excitement preparatory to the organization of a\r\nnew Congress. When it became lawful for a new Congress to assemble\r\nwithin an hour after the death-knell of the old, a blow of utter\r\ndemoralization was aimed at the short session of the national\r\nlegislature. This law was made to Checkmate Andy Johnson; and like\r\nmany patent medicines, it may be excellent for some particular\r\ndisease, but its action upon all the other organs is mischievous and\r\nweakening, in its tendency at least.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-first Congress had 121 members who quietly slip back\r\ninto private life. It is their last few days at the Capitol, and\r\nthey decide upon having a good time, leaving the drudgery to the\r\nnew Congress. These members will not agree to night sessions. It\r\nis impossible to assemble a quorum, and during the days the least\r\npossible work is accomplished. In order to show the country how a\r\nlarge mountain can bring forth a small mouse, yesterday the rules\r\nwere suspended in order to put into the appropriation bill the amount\r\nnecessary for the public buildings in different parts of the country.\r\nThe yeas and nays were called, but owing to those intellectual antics\r\nwhich members know so well how to perform, the root of the matter\r\ncould not be reached. The vote was taken eleven times, and after\r\nall this manoeuvring the whole matter was laid upon the table. Over\r\nseven precious hours of the time was wasted and the country has\r\nnothing to show for it except its depleted purse. During the last\r\nshort session of Congress a majority of the members feel little or no\r\nresponsibility, if they are to be judged by their deportment and work.\r\n\r\nThe officers to be elected in the new Congress are Clerk,\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, Postmaster, and Doorkeeper. Pennsylvania is in\r\npossession of the Clerk’s office, and there seems to be little or no\r\nopposition to the present accomplished officer. New York holds fast\r\nto the Doorkeeper, and at this point of the proceedings there seems\r\nlittle cause for alarm. The great struggle, however, is going to be\r\nbetween the contestants for Postmaster and Sergeant-at-Arms. The\r\npresent Postmaster has all the strength of the House, because he has\r\nproved himself a worthy and efficient officer, but Sergeant Sherwood\r\nought to have the place, because he would make one of the handsomest\r\nofficers in the House, where beauty is at a discount; besides he\r\ntakes good care of his widowed mother, and he has but one shapely leg\r\nand no wife to comfort him in case he is defeated. If women were on\r\nthe floor of Congress, Sergeant would be elected without a dissenting\r\nvoice, and a mild hint is feelingly insinuated that every man on the\r\nfloor shall vote exactly as if he expected at some future time in his\r\nlife to become the connecting link between woman and the angels.\r\n\r\nBut whilst the old Forty-first Congress is prostrated with a\r\nparalytic stroke a great cry is heard from the hungry South. It is\r\ndeclared that the New England and Western States are represented in\r\nthe leading offices of the House, but nowhere is the voice of the\r\nsugar-cane heard. Louisiana and Tennessee have both lifted up their\r\neyes, and refused to be comforted unless room is found for one or\r\nthe other in the national council. At the same time, between the\r\ngroans of the dying monarch, merriment and feasting are heard. The\r\npresent New Hampshire Sergeant-at-Arms is busily engaged in tickling\r\nthe palates of helpless Congressmen. Across Capitol square, in a\r\nhouse of modest pretension, a table is spread which would make the\r\nPresident’s “incomparable Melah” clasp his hands with joy. It has\r\nbeen proven beyond a doubt that the vote of Congressmen often lies in\r\nthe stomach, and with this end in view New England has been searched\r\nfor chaste white pullets to make chicken salad as thorough in its\r\naction as a bottle of Spaulding’s glue. And yet, in the very midst\r\nof the feasts, a member with a stomach as capacious as a cotton-gin\r\nhas shown alarming symptoms. His limbs have begun to tremble, and his\r\nknees act like the arch in carnival time. His mouth is seen to open\r\nwithout apparent cause, and a sound issues therefrom: “I say, Ordway!\r\nAny more chicken salad? I don’t like to bet on the champagne. You can\r\nhave my vote (hic). Free country! Free carriages! Hip! hip! hooray!”\r\n\r\nThe House is still in session. The sonorous voice of the reading\r\nclerk opens the appropriation bill and reads: “To Joseph S. Wilson,\r\nfor the valuable scientific Museum at the General Land Office,\r\n$10,000.”\r\n\r\nAt this point of the proceedings Mr. Kelsey, of New York, declares\r\nthat Mr. Wilson is not entitled to one cent of it. Mr. Kelsey affirms\r\nthat Mr. Edmunds, the predecessor of Mr. Wilson, sent a circular to\r\nsurveyors, registers, and receivers of land offices throughout the\r\ncountry, thus officially authorizing them to collect the specimens\r\nof which this mineral and geological cabinet is composed. Mr. Kelsey\r\nlikewise declared that Professor Hayden, formerly of the Interior\r\nDepartment, had donated to the Land Office his collection, gathered\r\nduring the time he was connected with the Department. In 1868 Mr.\r\nWilson sent a circular into the country, after the manner of his\r\npredecessor, and all specimens weighing less than four pounds were\r\nallowed to be sent through the mails free. These articles were\r\narranged by a clerk and labeled by the same, and put in paper cases,\r\nat an expense of a little more than $9,000 to the Government. After\r\nthis plain statement of the case, Mr. Kelsey subsided, yet the House\r\nvoted $10,000 to Joseph S. Wilson for superintending this work less\r\nthan three years, in addition to his own salary. Mr. Sargent, of\r\nCalifornia, said in extenuation of his vote that Mr. Wilson had been\r\na faithful public officer for forty years, and although he had a\r\nperfect knowledge of the land system he didn’t own a single acre, and\r\nthat he was now compelled to apply for copying for members of his\r\nfamily or to rent rooms for lodgings to support the same; and now,\r\ninstead of pensioning an old and faithful public servant, as is done\r\nin every civilized country except our own, it is sought to rob him of\r\nthe acknowledgment of meritorious service.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle that the Government is responsible for the\r\npecuniary condition of those it employs, General Banks moved that\r\nVinnie Ream should be paid an additional five thousand dollars\r\nfor her immortal statue of Lincoln. In the most feeling manner he\r\nreferred to the years of patient toil which the young artist had\r\nbestowed upon the model. In language of a statesman he depicted\r\nthe woman, and the beauty and purity of the marble of which the\r\ncelebrated statue is composed. All the strong points of the case\r\nwere handled with a master’s dexterity, and General Banks suddenly\r\ncollapsed before the scorching corruscations of his own mind. General\r\nButler then arose and declared himself safe on the woman question.\r\nHe had no objection to Vinnie Ream’s rosy lips and bright eyes, so\r\nlong as they continued to be Congressional property, but he dare not,\r\neven for her sake, pick the national pockets in the daytime; and he\r\ntherefore gave way to Mr. Dawes, the most economical man in Congress,\r\nwho seemed to be exceedingly annoyed that his gallantry should be\r\nheld up as a target for the shafts of less scrupulous Congressmen.\r\nMr. Dawes protested against this bold proposition of General Banks;\r\nbut a disinterested observer could perceive by the drooping of his\r\neyelids, and the ready, flute-like tones of his voice, that a woman\r\nwas in some way mixed up with the case, and that he was battling as\r\nonly a man can with the waters of demoralization. Another Congressman\r\nwas about to make a speech against giving Vinnie the additional five\r\nthousand, but before he had time to open his lips he was seized by\r\none of the monsters of the lobby and hurried to a spot where a view\r\nof Vinnie’s modest studio greeted his vision. Filmy lace shrouded\r\nthe tall gaunt windows. The clear little doves which the inimitable\r\nartist had brought from Rome were cooing and kissing, and baskets\r\nof flowers were slowly steeping in the beams of amber sunshine. The\r\nmember fell on his face and wept, at the same time General Banks and\r\nthe motion were carried.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAISE FOR DEPARTING LEGISLATORS.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF GEORGE W. JULIAN’S SERVICES TO THE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 7, 1871_.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-first Congress of the United States has passed into\r\nhistory. It will simply be remembered on account of its negative\r\nqualities. It has done little good to its friends, and less harm to\r\nits enemies. It attempted reconstruction, but this was too large\r\na pill for so small a throat, so the whole matter has been stowed\r\naway in Ben Butler’s committee room, where it is expected that it\r\nwill be kept in the very best state of preservation. No law has been\r\nenacted to protect the Southern Unionist, whilst the bloody Ku Klux\r\nand fierce highwayman hold possession of every inch of the late\r\nConfederate soil. Is not the word “liberty” a mockery when every\r\nprominent Republican in certain districts of the country has to go\r\narmed to the teeth? when women, for expressing their sentiments, are\r\ntaken from their beds at midnight and cruelly flogged by fiends with\r\nhuman forms and masked faces? With a Republican administration and\r\na Congress made up of a majority of the same element, why are not\r\nlife and free expression of opinion protected everywhere? Who is to\r\nblame for murder, rapine, and violence? Who is to blame for the pall\r\nwhich is slowly settling down upon the forces of the late grand army\r\nof the Republic? Is it not madness to talk about universal suffrage\r\nand universal amnesty when life and property are no more safe than\r\nin the South American republics? Why should we attempt to annex more\r\nterritory, when, apparently, we have not the strength to keep the\r\npeace within our own domain? If Congress denies the President power\r\nto send the military wherever the laws are defied, let him bring the\r\nsame influence to bear upon it as in the San Domingo business, and\r\nthe matter will be settled in less time than it takes to cook this\r\nnational pie. Where is the coming man or woman who will have the\r\npower and strength of mind to blot out Mason and Dixon’s line, and\r\nwho will make this nation feel that it had no North, no South, no\r\nEast, no West, but that it is one conglomerate whole, like a huge\r\nglacier or a mountain boulder?\r\n\r\nThe Forty-first Congress will be remembered because some of the\r\nlargest minds and best men in the country with its departure will\r\nstep back into the ranks of private life. It is a national loss when\r\nsuch men as George W. Julian can be found no longer on the floors of\r\nCongress. As chairman of the Committee on Public Lands he has saved\r\nmillions of dollars for the Government. Firm as adamant, he has stood\r\nbefore the waves of corruption, whilst the humblest and weakest have\r\nalways found in him a firm friend. It is true, he is one of the\r\nwarmest advocates of woman suffrage, and for this reason, perhaps\r\nmore than any other, the womanhood of this country should give this\r\nimportant subject a most thorough investigation, for when a great and\r\ngood man like Mr. Julian advises what is good for us let us listen\r\nand not be afraid. Mr. Julian is not only immense in physical size,\r\nbut he also has a colossal mental organization. At all times he is\r\nan ardent searcher after knowledge and truth. Not a great many years\r\nago Mr. Julian lost a most beautiful and accomplished wife, and very\r\nsoon after a boy of rare promise. How the strong man writhed beneath\r\nthis double blow! For months he seemed more like a stone statue than\r\na living man. Meeting him one day and noticing that look of the grave\r\non his face, the writer ventured to say, “If there is any truth in\r\nspiritualism, she may be very near you.” “If there is any truth in\r\nspiritualism I will know it,” replied Mr. Julian. After a separation\r\nof months we met again. “Any tidings from the unknown bourne?” “None!\r\nNone whatever. I have patiently investigated. It is all chaff! chaff!\r\nI have not been able to gather a single kernel of wheat. God will\r\ntake care of us all in his own way. I think I am learning the lesson\r\nof submission, and this is the hardest task man is ever set to learn.”\r\n\r\nMr. Julian was an Abolitionist in the days when nothing could be more\r\ndisgraceful; when urchins, with boys of a larger growth, pelted the\r\nunfortunate advocate of such ideas with eggs no longer fresh laid.\r\nDuring the long bitter years of the rebellion Mr. Julian worked with\r\nuntiring energy, not only in his seat on the floor of the House, but\r\nwherever he was needed he proved himself to be the soldier’s friend.\r\nHe has served twelve years in Congress, and during all this time\r\nhe has never been identified with any legislative measure except\r\nsuch as reflects credit on his judgment and the Republican party.\r\nIf he has not achieved immortal renown during his last term as a\r\nmember, it is because the Forty-first Congress has been in a mildewed\r\ncondition from the beginning to the decline. Mr. Julian has just\r\npassed the noon of life, but the flush of morning still shines in his\r\ncountenance, and on bright, sunny days he may be seen wending his way\r\ntoward the Capitol, his fine face aglow with honest, kindly feeling,\r\nand his majestic form towering a whole head above the majority of his\r\ncountrymen. Let the country he has so long and honorably served bid\r\nhim a momentary adieu, with the expectation that he will respond at\r\nany future time when the services of a man are required who needs a\r\nreputation like that of Cæsar’s wife. The nation’s loss is Indiana’s\r\ngain, and if the benighted State is to be regenerated, the result\r\nwill be brought about through the unremitting toil of such men as\r\nGeorge W. Julian.\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth of Ohio has recalled Judge Welker and Judge\r\nLawrence, two of the soundest Republicans and safest men in the\r\ncountry. As one of the most prominent members of the Committee for\r\nthe District of Columbia, Judge Welker has had no easy task to\r\nperform. All matters of importance pertaining to the District have\r\nbeen brought to his notice, and all complaints for which it was\r\nsupposed that Congressional legislation could provide a remedy have\r\nbeen poured into his ears unsparingly. If any abuses were found to\r\nexist at the national lunatic asylum the presence of Judge Welker was\r\ninstantly sought. This man has been six years in Congress, and during\r\nthis time no man can show a better record. He has never been caught\r\nin the snares of the lobby, and he goes back to his constituents\r\nwith clean, spotless hands. It is rumored that Ohio intends to make\r\nhim a governor, and if the best material is needed for the sacrifice\r\nnothing better can be found. Judge Welker is a self-made man, and\r\nthat may help to account for his firm, steel-like qualities. It would\r\ntake the sum total of twenty-five ordinary Congressmen to make a man\r\nequal in every moral aspect to Judge Welker; and when it can be said\r\nthat he is made of colors that will not wash, and that neither man,\r\nwoman, nor child ever pinned their faith to him and was disappointed,\r\nnothing further is necessary descriptive of his character.\r\n\r\nIn figure this late Congressman is rather below the medium size, with\r\na finely formed head, crowned with heavy luxuriant curls, in exchange\r\nfor which a woman would almost sell her birthright. Now add a pair of\r\ndeep, dark eyes, so transparent that you can often catch a glimpse of\r\nthe soul within, and you have the leading points that indicate the\r\nman known as Judge Martin Welker.\r\n\r\nJudge Lawrence has been a brave man on the floor of Congress, and no\r\nmember has inspired the lobby with greater terror. He has always been\r\nthe sworn foe of railroad schemes, ocean subsidies, corporations, and\r\nmonopolies. How vigilantly he has watched the late appropriation\r\nbills; and he never seemed to realize that there was any difference\r\nbetween Uncle Sam’s pocket and his own. How thoroughly he has\r\nattended to the affairs of his constituents. If he has sometimes been\r\naccused of selfishness, Ohio has never had reason to complain, for if\r\nhe has sinned in this respect it has all been done for her sake. Mr.\r\nLincoln declared during the late rebellion that Massachusetts, Ohio,\r\nand Iowa controlled the destiny of this nation. If this is conceded,\r\nit is because of the strength of the Congressional delegation of\r\nthese respective States. Ohio has been trying the experiment of\r\n“rotation in office,” and for the next two years the old Buckeye\r\nState will be out at sea on her trial trip. It is true some of the\r\nold officers are left at their posts, and if no storms arise the ship\r\nwill probably return in safety.\r\n\r\nIowa, not content to let well enough alone, has recalled two-thirds\r\nof her late delegation. No longer will the eye of the gallery be\r\ndazzled by him who has been termed the handsomest man in Congress.\r\nAlas! alas! William B. Allison is no more in the seat he lately\r\noccupied. Never again will the large brown eyes be seen wandering\r\nuneasily from floor to ceiling, seeking some soft, receptive\r\nspot, whereon to languish and die. Mr. Allison’s Congressional\r\nreputation rests upon the fact that to all appearances he has been\r\nthe bosom friend of Representative Hooper, of Boston. It is not\r\nknown positively whether Mr. Allison will return to Iowa and resume\r\nthe practice of law, or whether he intends to be stuffed and sent\r\nto Boston to occupy a conspicuous ornamental place in Mr. Hooper’s\r\ngorgeous library. As soon as a decision is reached the people shall\r\nbe apprised.\r\n\r\nMr. Loughridge, of Iowa, also goes out. He will chiefly be remembered\r\nas favoring the minority report on the woman suffrage question in\r\nthe Judiciary Committee. Judge Loughridge agrees with Mrs. Woodhull\r\non the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution, and\r\nthinks women are already entitled to vote.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has made a great clearing in the ranks of her\r\nRepresentatives. One-half of the late members of the Forty-first\r\nCongress are re-elected. But this includes the late Hon. John Covode.\r\nAccording to the record, eleven of the old members are in their\r\nseats and thirteen new men are to try their hands at the raw work of\r\nlegislation. The most prominent men who retire are Charles O’Neill,\r\nof Philadelphia, and Daniel J. Morrell, of Johnstown, both able men\r\non the floor. Mr. O’Neill has been in Congress eight years, winning\r\nfresh honors with every succeeding year, and just at the present\r\ntime, when he has attained the zenith of Congressional usefulness, he\r\nslips back into the calm waters of private life. If Philadelphia can\r\nstand the affliction there is no one else to complain. Hon. Charles\r\nO’Neill looks as if he had just laid aside all care and trouble and\r\nwas about to commence the world again.\r\n\r\nChicago recalls the stately Mr. Judd, one of the most courtly\r\nand elegant men in Congress. Few men are stronger than he is in\r\nlegislative matters; but a man of polished manners is remarkable\r\nbecause the House of Representatives is not noted for its laws of\r\ngenteel propriety. And then it is so strange that Chicago should be\r\ndistinguished for its grace or courtly qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Shelby M. Cullom goes also, but then it is said that he\r\nwill return next winter as Congressman for the State at large. The\r\ngreatest wit in Congress, Proctor Knott, retires to the shades of\r\nLebanon, Kentucky. Who will forget his memorable speech on the\r\nrailroad to Duluth and the paving of Pennsylvania avenue? We know\r\nnothing about his qualities as a legislator, but blessings be on the\r\nhead of a man that can make us laugh.\r\n\r\nRogers, of Arkansas, actually yields up the legislative ghost.\r\nRogers, the man who wanted all the women of the Treasury blown out\r\nexactly as the flame of a lamp is served. “Poor Rogers,” Susan B.\r\nAnthony calls him. If the delectable Susan meant poor in flesh, she\r\nwas right, for Rogers resembles a bear immediately upon waking up\r\nafter taking its long delicious winter snooze.\r\n\r\nThis letter comes to an end because no more ex-Congressmen to-day can\r\nstep across the vestibule of our mind.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK MAN IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF A NUMBER OF SOLONS OF AFRICAN DESCENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 11, 1871_.\r\n\r\nAt the third session of the Fortieth Congress appeared the first\r\ncolored man on the floor of the United States Congress. The name of\r\nthis man was Willis Menard, and he hailed from New Orleans, La. Mr.\r\nMenard came to Washington as a contestant for a seat in the House,\r\nbut his rival gained the victory. This man was allowed the floor\r\nin order to make his defence, and awarded $2,500 with which to pay\r\nthe damages. Mr. Menard’s maiden speech reflected great credit upon\r\nhimself and the newspaper with which he was connected, but it failed\r\nof the desired effect, and he soon after took his departure for more\r\nsunny climes. Mr. Menard was a handsome quadroon, and it is said that\r\nhe derived a certain smooth, sinuous voice from his Creole ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe next candidates for Congressional fame were Jefferson F. Long\r\nand Joseph H. Rainey. These were the first colored men who obtained\r\na foothold in the House. These men came from their respective States\r\narmed with the proper documents, and without further notice or\r\ntrouble slipped into their seats in the outside row, the farthest\r\nfrom the Speaker. It is not known whether by design or accident it\r\nhappened that their seats were chosen so very near the door. At any\r\nrate they were in the very best position that could be obtained to\r\nflee in case the wily Logan should attempt capitol moving, or the\r\nfiery eloquence of a Butler or Banks should communicate flames to\r\nthe nervous surroundings. How quaint these two strange youthful\r\nfaces appeared by the side of wrinkles, frost and snow. Black\r\nmen? No! White men? No! But tinted a shade the Eternal knows how\r\nto mix. Jefferson F. Long, of Macon, was born in Crawford County,\r\nGeorgia. With great difficulty he obtained the rudiments of an\r\neducation. He was engaged in the business of a merchant tailor when\r\nhe was elected, and his term of office closed with the Forty-first\r\nCongress. It always takes the first two years to learn the trade of\r\na member, consequently Mr. Long could not accomplish much during his\r\napprenticeship, but he proved himself as apt at the business as the\r\naverage white man, and he gained the respect and good-will of his\r\nfellow workmen. He will be remembered as one of the first two colored\r\nmen elected to Congress; and the Forty-first Congress will be famous\r\nonly because, for the first time in the country’s history, a race\r\nwhich forms an integral part of the nation had a hearing through\r\ntheir own people. The Forty-first Congress is scored in history by a\r\ncolored mark which will deepen and broaden as the Republic runs its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nJoseph H. Rainey was born in Georgetown, S. C. His parents were\r\nnatives of the same city, but by their industry obtained their\r\nfreedom. He was never allowed to attend school, but in some way he\r\nmanaged to gather the rudiments of an education. This knowledge\r\nwas vastly augmented and improved by travel in the West Indies\r\nand elsewhere. During the war he was obliged to work on the rebel\r\nfortifications, but he managed to escape and did not come back\r\nuntil the close of the war, and then he returned to Georgetown. He\r\nwas elected a delegate to the State constitutional convention in\r\n1868, and was a member of the State Senate in 1870, which position\r\nhe resigned to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of B. F.\r\nWhittemore, of cadet fame.\r\n\r\nMr. Rainey is one of the five colored members of the Forty-second\r\nCongress. In features and complexion he is far more like an Asiatic\r\nthan an African. In size he has attained sufficient height for\r\nexceeding grace, and then he has a voice like a flute, and the\r\nsmooth, soft velvet ways of the Orientals. It is true, he has kind of\r\nan innocent habit of putting his hands in the place where a revolver\r\nor bowie knife is usually kept; but then he says, “We all have to go\r\narmed in the South, ready at a moment’s warning to sell our lives if\r\nit is necessary. No Republican of any prominence is safe.” Perhaps\r\nno man in the country has had so strange and eventful a history\r\nas Mr. Rainey. Born a slave, though early free, reared amidst the\r\ndegradation of this despotism, debarred from the light of learning,\r\nyet he takes his seat in Congress before a line indicative of age has\r\nmarked his countenance, representing the town and district in which\r\nhe was born. He seems to have fallen into his seat as noiselessly\r\nas a snowflake touches the earth. He sits by General Butler.\r\n_Contraband! Contraband!_ The problem is solved.\r\n\r\nJosiah T. Walls, the member from Florida, was born in North Carolina,\r\nof free parents, and looks as if he were about 28 years of age. He\r\nwas educated in Philadelphia, and served in the Union Army, leaving\r\nschool to fight the battles of his country. After the war Florida\r\nbecame his home, and he was first chosen to the house and afterwards\r\nto the senate of the State. He resigned his seat in the State senate\r\nin order to come to Congress. It is said that Mr. Walls is of Indian\r\nextraction, but in appearance he resembles a bright mulatto, of\r\ngood features and average height. In personal raiment he is not\r\neclipsed by any Congressman, and he may be seen in his seat, clad\r\nin polished broadcloth, spotless linen, and dainty blue necktie. A\r\nsnowy handkerchief of pineapple origin, peeping from his pocket,\r\nphotographs the taste of an exquisite gentleman. General Butler\r\nbeing absent from the House when the seats were chosen, Mr. Walls,\r\nfortunate in the choice of a good one, tendered it to the warrior, by\r\nwhom it was accepted.\r\n\r\nRobert C. De Large, of the Charleston district, is here in place of\r\nthe Hon. C. C. Bowen, whose numerous wives are becoming as famous\r\nas Brigham Young’s. He presents an aspect of as much intellectual\r\nstrength in his personal appearance as nine-tenths of the members on\r\nthe floor. Mr. De Large was born free in South Carolina, received\r\nthe scanty rudiments of an education, but being a man of great\r\nforce of character, he knew how to make the most of his advantages.\r\nDuring the war he worked on the rebel fortifications. He has always\r\ntaken an active part in politics, and was appointed clerk in the\r\nFreedmen’s Bureau. He was also a member of the constitutional\r\nconvention, and subsequently a member of the legislature, where he\r\nwas chairman of the committee on ways and means. Mr. De Large has\r\nacquired distinction as a parliamentarian. In person this Congressman\r\nbears very little resemblance to the African race. His mother was a\r\nHaytien, and he inherits a rich olive skin. In stature he is rather\r\nbelow the medium size, and his exceeding grace of manner might be\r\nimitated to the advantage of more experienced Congressmen. Mr. De\r\nLarge is 28 years old.\r\n\r\nBenjamin S. Turner, of Alabama, was born in North Carolina, in 1825,\r\nbut removed to the State he represents in 1830. He was born a slave\r\nand remained so until the proclamation of Abraham Lincoln. Under\r\nthe most trying and difficult circumstances he learned to read. His\r\nmaster’s children taught him to repeat the letters of the alphabet,\r\nbut it was a long time afterwards before he knew the relation between\r\nthe name and the printed character. He says he was mostly educated\r\nby reading the New York _Herald_, though occasionally, once in a\r\nvery long time, he managed to get hold of a New York _Tribune_. Mr.\r\nTurner was first elected tax gatherer of Dallas County, where he was\r\nrequired to furnish a bond of $45,000. This he was enabled to do, but\r\nhe did not enjoy the office, and so he resigned. He was then elected\r\na member of the city council of Selma, and carried his district by\r\nover 5,000 majority. Soon after he was elected to Congress. In person\r\nMr. Turner is above the average height, with all indications of\r\nimmense muscular power. His figure might answer for a handsome statue\r\nof Hercules cast in bronze. If a man must have dark blood in his\r\nveins, it is well to be stained in the bright color of this Southern\r\nmember. If the human eye is the window of the soul, what a defiant\r\nspirit crouches behind the fierce, sharp orbs of Mr. Turner. Then he\r\nhas a way of biting off his words and spitting them out, as if they\r\nhad a bitter instead of savory taste. Although a slave, it is easy to\r\nsee that he was never made to kiss the rod. Coming to the stationery\r\nroom of the House the first day of the Forty-second Congress, he\r\nrequested that certain sundries be sent to his rooms, at the same\r\ntime offering to pay for them. He was told that members were allowed\r\na certain amount, which was charged to them; all over this was paid\r\nfor. Said he, “I am well aware of that. If the Government allows me\r\nanything I will get it at the right time, but I’ll pay for what I\r\nhave; I keep no open accounts with any man.” And the jaws closed with\r\nall the force produced by two hundred years of bondage. Mr. Turner is\r\na strong man in his way, but whether his qualities are such as will\r\ngive him distinction in Congress time alone must decide.\r\n\r\nRobert B. Elliot, the colored man who represents the proud capital of\r\nthe late hot-bed of secession, differs in many ways from the other\r\ntawny members. He is not only a genuine African, without a drop of\r\nwhite blood to lessen the darkness, but he is a carpetbagger of the\r\nMassachusetts persuasion. The first gun fired at Sumter opened the\r\nway for this most astonishing spectacle of the nineteenth century.\r\nOh, the long, bitter, savage struggle between Massachusetts and\r\nSouth Carolina! The Palmetto State flung down the glove when her\r\nguns opened on Sumter. As fast as steam could travel Massachusetts\r\nhad her soldiers in Washington to pick it up. Cotton and rice went\r\nunder. Codfish and mackerel prevailed, whilst one man in the inky\r\ncovering of Robert B. Elliot represents both Massachusetts and\r\nSouth Carolina on the floor of Congress. A shadowy halo of romance\r\nsurrounds this man, and it is very hard to sift the truth from the\r\nhundred tales that are afloat concerning his origin and history. It\r\nis said that he was educated in England and that he is familiar with\r\nmany languages, but none, so far, as we can understand, have heard\r\nhim converse in anything but his supposed mother tongue. Mr. Elliot\r\nhas been a resident of South Carolina since the war. He has a fine\r\nEnglish education, and is a lawyer by profession. At one time he\r\nwas editor of the _South Carolina Leader_, which he conducted with\r\nability and considerable eclat. It is thought by a great many that\r\nhe will lead the colored men in Congress. This may be so, but it\r\nis well to remember that the fiery blood of the South flows in Mr.\r\nTurner’s veins, and the probabilities are that the feuds between\r\nMassachusetts and South Carolina will not be allowed to die for the\r\nwant of proper material to feed the flame. Mr. Elliot was a member of\r\nthe Republican convention, also a member of the legislature, where\r\nhe was chairman of the committee on railroads. At the present time\r\nthe subject of railroads is of vast importance to the people of South\r\nCarolina. There is no possible way of making a thing of beauty and\r\na joy forever out of Mr. Elliot. If he were a British commissioner\r\nor an African prince it would be all the same. Nature has fixed him\r\nup according to her best ideas of a man, and it is evident that she\r\ndid not consult him or any other mortal in the matter. The New York\r\n_Tribune_ says he is very fine looking “when his face lights up.” If\r\nthis is so, there is nothing to prevent him from procuring a patent\r\nilluminator and becoming the handsomest man in Congress, unless\r\nGeneral Butler steals a march on him and appropriates everything of\r\nthe kind to be found for his own use. Mr. Elliot is reputed to be a\r\nman of considerable wealth and much refinement; but you can no more\r\njudge of his age than you could that of a porcelain egg.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE GRACE OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nHER MAJESTY’S REPRESENTATIVES ON THE JOINT HIGH COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 17, 1871_.\r\n\r\nTo the modest suburban building temporarily occupied by the State\r\nDepartment the eye of the country is directed. A cozy suite of rooms\r\nare set apart in this same pile of brick and mortar, where a body\r\nof men called the joint high commission meet in order to discuss\r\nthe little “unpleasantnesses” which have occurred from time to time\r\nbetween two governments which have both pretended to be united\r\nto each other by the most natural and fraternal ties. It is not\r\nthe object of this letter to disclose any of the secrets that are\r\ncaressed and embraced within those awful doors, vigilantly guarded\r\nby locks and keys, but some of the ceremonies and forms observed, as\r\nwell as the dress and bearings of those in authority, may not come\r\namiss to the general reader.\r\n\r\nAs early as 10 in the morning carriages are seen rapidly approaching\r\nthe State Department. After depositing the distinguished human\r\nfreight the carriages disappear. We have the joint high commission\r\nwithin the building. It may be thought that these men all enter the\r\nsame room, consult and measure red tape together. Far from any such\r\nnonsense. The British commissioners go into a room by themselves; the\r\nAmerican commissioners betake themselves to another; and each country\r\ntalks to itself some two hours, more or less. Then the commissioners\r\nof both countries adjourn to a room in the same building, where a\r\nmodest lunch of crackers and cheese is spread.\r\n\r\nThen the joint high commission throat is deluged with the choicest\r\nwines that have outlived the perils of an ocean voyage. This\r\nperformance safely over, the commissioners of both countries adjourn\r\nto the same room, where Earl de Grey discourses for the British lion,\r\nand Secretary Fish speaks in behalf of the American eagle, while the\r\nremainder of the joint high commissioners keep “whist” as hunters in\r\nsearch of the flying game. It will readily be seen that the English\r\ncommissioners have simply their instructions to carry out. There is\r\nno free discussion between the members of both sides. Each side is\r\nheard through its mouthpiece, and it is safe to say that no fault can\r\nbe found with the awful dignity of the joint high commission.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between the hours of 4 and 5 in the afternoon this\r\ndistinguished assembly adjourns, and every evening in the week a\r\ndinner party is waiting somewhere for the Englishmen. The writer\r\nheard Sir Stafford Northcote say that the “social duties of the\r\ncommission were becoming the hardest part of the work.” Just as\r\nthe Hon. Reverdy Johnson was wined and dined in England, the royal\r\nscions of nobility are treated here. One evening they are invited to\r\nGeneral Sherman’s to see the Supreme Judges; another evening we have\r\nsome other great and mighty man to show. Washington is determined\r\nto astonish these men, if excellent dinners will do it; besides it\r\nsounds well to point out to a morning visitor the very chair upon\r\nwhich some of the bluest blood of England has graciously reclined.\r\nJust as Queen Elizabeth used to select the right man for the right\r\nposition, her Majesty’s Government has made choice of the right\r\nmaterial for the right place. Like a wise woman, Victoria did not\r\ntrouble herself about beauty, but chose her men as the mother advised\r\nher daughter when selecting a husband--for qualities that would\r\nwear. In the first place, she looked around for a great lawyer on\r\ninternational affairs, and selected her famous subject, Sir Montague\r\nBernard, the present professor of international law at Oxford. Sir\r\nMontague Bernard has written a great many pamphlets on international\r\nlaw, besides a lecture on diplomacy, and the history of British\r\nneutrality during the late civil war. If by any sort of alchemy a man\r\ncould be evolved from that immaterial something that goes to make\r\nEnglish law, Mr. Bernard is the man. There seems to be just enough\r\nbody about him to confine his international matter, with nothing left\r\nto love, hope, or die with. With a firm set mouth and peculiar voice!\r\nHow one longs to lift up the lids of his mind and see the click and\r\nplay of the awful machinery!\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the Earl de Gray, the spokesman of the commission.\r\nAn editorial in _The Press_ has already given the titles which the\r\ncenturies had constructed for this bit of earthy matter when it\r\nshould come along. The Earl has inherited four titles, two from\r\nhis father and two from his uncle, with large estates attached to\r\neach. The reader is requested to study Dr. Mackenzie’s article for\r\nall useful information, with the exception that the Earl was not\r\ndescribed as Knight of the Garter. It may be owing to Dr. Mackenzie’s\r\nextreme delicacy in the matter, which is certainly most creditable\r\nto his refined and sensitive sex; but when a member of the joint\r\nhigh commission and a man who is said to belong to one of the first\r\nfamilies of England appears at the White House, at a dinner given in\r\nhis honor, with a garter tied around his left leg in plain sight of\r\nthe ladies present, without any effort on his part to conceal the\r\nsame, in spite of Dr. Mackenzie’s diffidence, this matter should\r\nbe carefully unwound. Earl de Gray wore to the President’s dinner\r\nbreeches that came to his knees, and these were met by black silk\r\nstockings that, whilst they concealed, did not hide his finely\r\nshaped lower extremities that leave off where his feet begin. The\r\nstocking on his right leg kept its place apparently without exterior\r\nfastenings; but the left was confined by a striped garter in black\r\nand white, held together by a chaste and modest buckle. It is\r\ntrue one of the lady guests was heard to inquire of another if she\r\nsupposed that his lordship had lost its mate, and when she was told\r\nthat the noble Earl had received this from the hand of his gracious\r\nsovereign, because an English woman had dropped hers in the dance,\r\nand that he wore it in deference to this sublime act, tears filled\r\nthe eyes of the inquirer and she could only talk of the Earl’s great\r\ntenderness the remainder of the evening. The Earl de Grey married\r\nhis cousin, who is a late lady of the bed chamber to the Princess of\r\nWales. His only living child, Lord Goderich, is a young man, 19 years\r\nof age, and he accompanies the commission to this country. There\r\nis nothing in the personal appearance of Earl de Grey to indicate\r\nthat the root of the family has pierced the mould below the times of\r\nHenry the First. He is a small man, with a head so large that he is\r\ninclined to look top heavy, with features that would attract little\r\nor no attention if they belonged to a Congressman. If he possesses\r\nancestral pride, he must have left it in bonnie England, for he is\r\ndistinguished above his associates for republican simplicity of\r\nmanners. Socially speaking, no words are equal to the situation, and\r\naccording to the description of our late countryman, Earl de Grey\r\nmust possess the elegant and dignified ways of Washington Irving. The\r\nEnglish nobleman was formerly a member of Parliament, was afterwards\r\nappointed Under Secretary of War, in June, 1859, and Secretary of\r\nState for War, in 1863, and subsequently for India, and retired in\r\n1866, where he has rested until he was resurrected to do duty with\r\nthe joint commission.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. Sir Stafford Northcote, Henry of Hayne, County Devon,\r\nPrivy Councillor, Knight of the Bath, Doctor of Civil Law, Member\r\nof Parliament from North Devon, Secretary of State for India, late\r\npresident of the board of trade, is the eighth baronet of that name,\r\nand succeeded to his title the 17th of March, 1851. The book says,\r\n“the great antiquity and high respectability of this family are\r\nclearly proved, by an ancient and copious pedigree, preserved in\r\nthe College of Arms, accompanied by a great number of family deeds,\r\nfines, wills, etc., to several of which are affixed their seals or\r\narms, which pedigree is continued down to the visitation of 1620,\r\nin the reign of King James the First.” It will readily be seen that\r\nit is a great blessing to any humble mortal to be born an English\r\nnobleman. Earth, sky, and water interest themselves in his favor.\r\nOffices of emolument and power hang ripe on the tree, awaiting the\r\ntime when he shall be old enough to shake gently the branches. Sir\r\nStafford has titles enough to take one’s breath away, but this fact\r\nis gleaned from various sources of information. There is no danger\r\nfor some time of the baronetcy becoming extinct, as Sir Stafford has\r\nseven sons. Sir Stafford represents the Tory element of England, and\r\nis devotedly attached to the Crown. He is a fine type of the pure\r\nSaxon, and with the exception of Sir Edward Thornton the handsomest\r\nman of the number, if his size could be increased; but it is\r\nnoticeable in this commission that the older the family from which\r\nthe man sprung the smaller the size, which proves that even dust will\r\nwear out.\r\n\r\nLord Tenterden, as near as can be ascertained, comes from a new\r\nfamily, his father being the first nobleman of the line. The name\r\nof Tenterden does not figure much in books of knight errantry,\r\nconsequently the reader’s attention is directed elsewhere in order\r\nto study this important subject. My lord secretary to Her Majesty’s\r\nhigh commission is rather a fine looking man, with large eyes, and a\r\nbeard which conceals the entire lower part of his face. He may have\r\na mouth somewhere concealed in the jungle of his mustache, but there\r\nis no evidence, so far as we have seen, of any such aperture. He is\r\nsaid to have a thorough understanding of English yachts, and it is\r\nthought in Washington that he is on excellent terms with His Majesty\r\nthe Prince of Wales. It is his duty to record the doings of the high\r\ncommission, but as he brought along a man to do the work, his place\r\nmay be considered quite as ornamental as useful. But when he comes to\r\ndinner parties the right man is found for the right place. With what\r\nopen arms his dear American cousins have received him! How they have\r\ncrammed him with shad and canvas-back! Alas! alas! he must feel like\r\na fat turkey at Thanksgiving time.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Thornton is well known in this country as the English\r\nminister resident, and no man connected with the foreign legations is\r\nmore respected and beloved by our people. He came here an untitled\r\nman, having served for many years in various diplomatic positions in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. At the time Prince Arthur was in this\r\ncountry he came more immediately under the eye of his sovereign, and\r\nshe was so pleased with the treatment of her son, and remembering at\r\nthe same time her great obligations to him as a subject, that she\r\nknighted him, and now we have in the place of plain Mr. Thornton,\r\n“Sir Edward;” and well he becomes the title, not that he is any\r\ndifferent from plain Mr. Thornton, for Nature made him a nobleman\r\nin the beginning, but the Queen, with her poor eyes, could not see\r\nit until a royal sprig was a guest under his hospitable roof. After\r\nall, the Queen only loaned him a title. It is buried when Sir Edward\r\nbecomes ashes. His boy will be plain Mr. Thornton, and all the better\r\nfor that. Minister Thornton, like the late Sir Frederick Bruce,\r\nhas a most distinguished personal presence, owing to his majestic\r\nheight and graceful manners. Then he retains that exquisite purity\r\nof complexion for which the English belles are celebrated, and our\r\nAmerican climate, so conducive to parchment and wrinkles, labors upon\r\nhis handsome face in vain.\r\n\r\nSir John A. MacDonald is another of Her Majesty’s commissioners\r\nwhose title dies with the man. Sir John’s father was a merchant in\r\nKingston, Canada, who came to America when this son was only 6 years\r\nof age. When only 15 years old the latter left school and began the\r\nstudy of law. When 21 years old he was admitted to the bar; soon\r\nafter he turned his attention to politics, and in 1844 was elected\r\nmember for Kingston in the second parliament of United Canada. When\r\ntwo years and a half in Parliament he was appointed a member of\r\nthe cabinet. During the time of our civil war there was agitation\r\nin regard to the dismemberment of Canada. Sir John was one of the\r\nstrongest advocates for the union of the provinces. He was also a\r\nleading participant in the secularization of the church property,\r\nwhich dissolved the connection of church and state in Canada, and\r\nin the adjustment of the troublesome seigniorial rights. In one of\r\nhis addresses he said: “The fraternal conflict now unhappily raging\r\nin the United States shows us the superiority of our institutions,\r\nand of the principle on which they are based. Long may that\r\nprinciple--the monarchical principle--prevail in this land. Let there\r\nbe no ‘looking to Washington,’ as was threatened by a leading member\r\nof the opposition last session; but let the cry with the moderate\r\nparty be: ‘Canada united as one province and under one sovereign.’”\r\n\r\nSir John has received his title for his devotion to the interests of\r\nthe Crown, as exemplified in the various delicate duties assigned to\r\nhim. In person he is above the medium height, with a regular cast\r\nof features; and he has that frank, ingenuous manner not usually\r\nconceded to such polished men of the world. Sir John is the only\r\nmember of the English part of the commission who brings his wife.\r\nHe tarries in the shadow of the aristocratic Arlington, but the\r\nremainder of the commission are quartered at the superb Philip\r\nmansion on K street, opposite Franklin Square, where, with a large\r\nretinue of servants, dogs and horses, the fire of an English home is\r\nkept burning. This house is one of the largest and finest private\r\nresidences in Washington. The extensive drawing room has a waxed\r\nfloor, relieved in sundry places by exquisitely finished velvet\r\nrugs. Pictures of English landscapes look down from the lofty walls.\r\n“I didn’t know they had such comfortable houses in this country,”\r\nsaid one of the royal blood. “It must have been made expressly for\r\nour use,” chimed another. It is simply an elegant American home,\r\nplanned by an English-born American citizen, who, out of deference to\r\nhis late countrymen, resolved that they should carry away from his\r\nadopted country something sweet and savory in the shape of pleasant\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISSERTATION ON DRESS.\r\n\r\nPROPER PROCEDURE FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 18, 1871_.\r\n\r\nIn a social way the doors of the White House have closed for the\r\nseason. The beginning of Lent has heretofore marked the abrupt\r\ndecline of the star of Fashion, but this year the days of folly\r\nhave been lengthened, in consequence of the necessity of extending\r\nhospitalities to the British part of the joint high commission.\r\nRecent receptions may be compared to autumnal flowers trying to bloom\r\nafter the coming of frost. The carpets at the Executive Mansion begin\r\nto show the result of the wear and tear of a winter’s campaign, and\r\na dingy pall seems to wrap all the other surroundings. Mrs. Grant\r\nlooks weary and worn, and, though her manner is kind and engaging as\r\never, it is plain to see that she will be glad when this universal\r\nhandshaking is over. One becomes thoroughly exhausted in vain attempt\r\nto feel satisfied with the foam and froth of Washington’s fashionable\r\ndissipations. The same envy, heart burnings and petty jealousies\r\nexist here as in monarchical courts. There may be a small quantity\r\nof genuine comfort in a modern dinner party at the capital, and yet\r\nthere is room for grave doubts. Suppose you are invited to a dinner\r\nat the White House; you must remember that every rule and regulation\r\nis prescribed. When you receive your invitation you know exactly what\r\nchair you will occupy at the table. Soon after your arrival you will\r\nreceive a card which will inform you which “lady” you are ordered to\r\ntake to dinner. This woman sits by your side. You are obliged to be\r\ncivil whether you are inclined to be or not. You are expected to say\r\nsolid, substantial things after the soup. You are expected to avoid\r\neverything weak and watery after the fish. Sly and delicate humor\r\nmust be sandwiched between every course. Suppose this woman, though\r\ngood enough in her way, is exactly the one you would flee from if the\r\nwind was fair, and the coast clear? There are women in Washington of\r\nrare conversational powers; queenly in manners, and kind of heart;\r\nbut they are scarce, and the number can be counted without using any\r\nnumber beyond the digits.\r\n\r\nThere is to be a fashionable crush or reception at the Cabinet\r\nminister’s home. In order to keep it within the bounds of mathematics\r\ncards of invitation have been issued. Is it possible that a Cabinet\r\nminister means to pack his house so densely? Every available inch\r\nof standing room is occupied. The stairs resemble seats in an\r\namphitheatre, with its tier of heads, one rising above another.\r\nThe lights in the showy chandeliers burn with that dim blue flame\r\nsometimes noticed in mines down deep in the earth. There is a\r\nfaint, deathly odor of undying perfumes. The music sounds as though\r\nit were afar off in the heavy atmosphere. If the mansion were a\r\nprison, and the inmates therein wretches of high and low degree,\r\ncould the imagination picture a more horrible situation? But let it\r\nbe remembered that this medley is made up of silk, satin, lace and\r\njewels, snowy shoulders and distinguished men. Everybody is polite\r\nand refined; wit sparkles, women laugh, and if one must be pressed\r\nto atoms, no more charming death could be devised. Did the Cabinet\r\ndame invite all these people to her hospitable mansion? Nay! Never!\r\nShe scattered abroad a suitable number of invitations. Some of the\r\npeople who received these cards took the liberty to ask a friend,\r\nor perhaps more; and thus it will readily be seen that if many of\r\nthe invited guests take such liberties the company is doubled, and\r\nsometimes quadrupled by the license usurped by what is called\r\n“fashionable society in Washington.” The writer has known of an\r\ninstance where a member of Congress and his wife received cards for a\r\nCabinet reception. They attended, accompanied by nine guests by their\r\nown invitation. The time will come when such entertainments must\r\nbe done away with. None but men of immense wealth can accept such\r\npositions unless they have the fearlessness to emulate the simple\r\nlife of George S. Boutwell. And yet how can an honorable, high-minded\r\nman accept legions of civilities and never have anything to offer in\r\nreturn?\r\n\r\nThe social fabric of Washington is reared upon the foundation\r\nprepared for it by George and Martha Washington. It was good and\r\nexcellent for those days, when the wise and prudent Martha, and the\r\nwives of the Cabinet ministers, could return the visits of their\r\nfriends in a single day. More than three-quarters of a century have\r\ngone, and society after that style is ready for the sickle. Last\r\nwinter the wives of the Cabinet ministers met in solemn council and\r\ndecided that visits would not be returned for the reason that the\r\nsun and moon could not be made to stand still, and the days were not\r\nlong enough for the hundreds of demands made upon them. The most\r\nbeautiful, gifted, and accomplished woman in Washington shortened\r\nher days in order to meet the insane, exorbitant demands made upon\r\nher by the tyrant Fashion. Mrs. Belknap once said to the writer: “It\r\nwould not matter so much if I omit visiting a Senator’s wife, but it\r\nwould pain me exceedingly if any person thought they were neglected\r\non account of their obscurity. If I get well, this matter must be\r\nexplained, and I know the people will understand it.”\r\n\r\nHeretofore the ladies who move in what is called Washington society,\r\nwith the exception of Mrs. Grant, have been expected to return their\r\ncalls. For the first time in social history, the Cabinet dames,\r\nwho are a law unto themselves, have decided otherwise. In a little\r\ntime the wives of the Senators will enact the same law, for they\r\nare already beginning to feel their chains, and some of the boldest\r\nassert that life is too solemn and earnest to be wasted in a giddy\r\nwhirlpool of dissipation.\r\n\r\nAmong the accomplished women no longer seen upon the topmost wave of\r\nsociety may be mentioned Mrs. General Williams, better known as Mrs.\r\nStephen A. Douglas, and the elegant wife of Senator Sprague. Both\r\nhave known what it is to reign as “Queen of Beauty and Fashion,” and\r\nboth have retired before the noon of life to the substantial comforts\r\nand enduring peace to be found only in the smooth waters of domestic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect entertainments of the winter have been given at\r\nthe handsome mansion of Senator Chandler. A card reception at a\r\nSenator’s residence partakes more of the nature of a private party,\r\nconsequently painfully crowded rooms are avoided. For this reason the\r\nfinest toilettes of the winter are brought out, because they can be\r\nworn without danger of serious damage. The costliest dresses of the\r\nwinter have been sported by Mrs. John Morrissey and Mrs. Fernando\r\nWood. Mrs. Morrissey wore a black thread-lace dress, over heavy white\r\nmoire, with solitaire diamonds only for ornament, at the Corcoran\r\nball. Mrs. Morrissey has never been seen in general society in\r\nWashington. A party given by the Chinese embassy, and Mr. Corcoran’s\r\nentertainment planned to complete the Washington monument, as well\r\nas to make the beau-monde merry and glad, are the only social places\r\nknown to the writer where the Hon. John Morrissey and his pretty,\r\nunobtrusive wife have been seen.\r\n\r\nThe rarest dress noticed this winter has been worn by Mrs. Fernando\r\nWood. Take up your finest collar, my lady reader--“old point,” by\r\nthe way. Now imagine a whole dress, with any quantity of ferns and\r\npalms running over it--waist, sleeves, skirt, all complete--with\r\npink silk underneath. Could anything more exquisite in the shape of\r\na dress be conceived? Stop a moment. Let us see! It certainly bears\r\ninspection. Let us move away and examine it as one would a picture.\r\nWe are writing for a newspaper, and the truth must be told. It looks\r\nat this distance as if Mrs. Wood had rolled herself up regardless of\r\nexpense in one of her own parlor window-curtains.\r\n\r\nIt is true that silk is worth its weight in silver the world over.\r\nWe might as well talk of cheap silver as cheap silk. When we buy a\r\nheavy dress for a small sum of money we are paying for dye-stuff, and\r\nthe dye-stuff we buy very soon destroys the silk. But costly as the\r\narticle is with which we love to decorate ourselves, it is within the\r\nreach of every industrious single woman in the country. It is worn\r\nas every-day apparel by the fashionable women of Washington. When a\r\ndress becomes too well known, or has lost its freshness, it is taken\r\nfor every-day wear. This is a great mistake for more than one reason.\r\nBy making silk so common it detracts from its elegance and beauty.\r\nThe only difference between a woman in full dress and when she is\r\nnot--in the first instance she wears a clean garment, and in the\r\nlatter, one that has seen the vicissitudes of life. Oh! blessed are\r\nthe charms of the laundry. Better all cotton than all silk.\r\n\r\nBecause silk is so common, fashion has decided that the superior\r\nexcellence or elegance of a woman’s wardrobe must consist in her rare\r\nand costly laces. But against this extravagant innovation good taste\r\nhas set her face. A moderate amount of lace adds additional charms\r\nto a handsome dress, but when we come to make the entire garment\r\nof the material the effect is lost. Queen Augusta, of Germany, who\r\nranks next to Eugenie in matters pertaining to the toilet, prefers\r\ntulle dresses to wear over her silks and satins. Sometimes these\r\nare ornamented with field grasses, at least this was the case in\r\nher younger years. In latter days her tulle garments are trimmed\r\nwith pearls. The most exquisite taste delights in simplicity. The\r\nmore barbarous a nation the more it revels in gorgeous and costly\r\nornament; but when every American woman lays her earrings aside\r\nforever the tranquillity and peace of the Republic is assured.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING OF OCCIDENT AND ORIENT.\r\n\r\nRECEPTION OF THE IMPERIAL EMBASSY OF JAPAN BY PRESIDENT GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 4, 1872_.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting ceremony has taken place which marks an epoch in\r\nthe civilization of the world. To-day the Occident and the Orient\r\nhas an official greeting. The fluttering petticoats of the East\r\nhave bowed before the scant, ungraceful pantaloons of the West, and\r\nhistory records the performance. The event was stately and solemn,\r\nand nothing occurred to mar or disturb the feelings of those present,\r\nexcept the cold and disdainful way in which the press was treated.\r\nThese scions of republican royalty were kept outside, whilst such\r\ncrumbs of information fell to our lot as the powers that be chose to\r\nbestow.\r\n\r\nBefore the magic hour of 12, for the royal time of day was chosen,\r\nten of the Japanese highest in power, accompanied by Mr. Mori, the\r\nJapanese minister, descended from their carriages and in single file\r\nmarched slowly into the Executive Mansion. Previously everything had\r\nbeen prepared for their reception. The broad halls and the great\r\nvestibule had been reduced to excruciating neatness. The air was\r\nladen with the odor of tropical exotics. Above the central part of\r\nthe great ottoman, in the Blue Room, arose a pyramid of flowers\r\ncomposed of Japanese lilies, birds of paradise, and the long,\r\ndreamy, pendant leaves of the Eastern fern. Daylight, which was not\r\nconsidered quite good enough for such an occasion, had been carefully\r\nexcluded, like the press, but, like this mighty engine, it managed to\r\nstruggle in, or at least enough of it for all practical purposes.\r\n\r\nWhilst all these things were in preparation Secretary Fish came\r\nrushing in and seized an unfortunate servant, who had accidentally\r\nput the right flower-pot in the wrong place. This was quickly\r\nadjusted and the Secretary left the place. Then Mrs. Secretary\r\nFish, swathed in pearl-colored silk, trimmed with the costliest\r\nlace, sailed through the rooms. A lackey followed her with fear and\r\ntrembling. As near as could be ascertained in the distance, the hair\r\non his head stood upon end. All at once dulcet sounds were heard,\r\n“Take it away.” The servant stood terror-bound until the lady said:\r\n“Too much mignonette. We cannot be too careful. Perfume is a good\r\nthing in the right place. The danger is, everything is becoming too\r\ncommon.” The flower-basket was removed, and the rooms were pronounced\r\nall ready for the ceremony.\r\n\r\nFirst of all Secretary Robeson sailed in, and following in his\r\nwake were the heads of the Navy Department, in their brilliant\r\nregimentals. As these were not the men who distinguished themselves\r\nin the late war, the people have no care to hear about them. But\r\ntheir shining shoulder-straps and other finery helped to make the\r\noccasion brilliant, the same as a shoal of dolphins at sea on a hot\r\nsummer’s day. Secretary Robeson looked as handsome and happy as could\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nThen came Minister Boutwell, in white choker and pale pearl-colored\r\nkids, closely followed by that interesting old greenback known as\r\nGeneral Spinner. Then Spinner was brought up by the heads of the\r\nTreasury Department, and they stretched out until it seemed as if it\r\nwas intended they should represent the “crack of doom.”\r\n\r\nThen came the handsome Saxon Secretary of War, with his officers,\r\nfollowed by Cresswell and the Post Office, and Attorney-General\r\nWilliams and his “heads.” The heads of the Attorney-General’s office\r\nare men who have blossomed, fruited and now ought to be gathered and\r\nput in the cellar for future use. Delano, of the Interior, was there\r\nwith his force, the most dignified magnate present.\r\n\r\nSpilled around promiscuously were Judge Holt, Cameron, Casserly, with\r\nnose at an angle of forty-five degrees; Banks, with a new shade to\r\nhis hair, called “Paris in Ashes;” Professor Henry, with any amount\r\nof electricity in his pockets; Speaker Blaine and Colfax--dear\r\nColfax! who came out and said he felt sorry for the press; he knew\r\nhow it was himself before greatness was thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, the Japanese. The President had fixed\r\nhimself in the right place in the East Room. To his left were\r\nthe great men of his Empire. To his right were the ten Eastern\r\nrepresentatives. The first five stood a little forward of the other\r\nfive, because they preceded them in rank. The first five were dressed\r\nsomewhat different from the remainder. They wore garments which are\r\nnever allowed to be upon their persons except in the presence of a\r\nruler of a great nation, and when engaged upon the highest diplomatic\r\nduty. This dress consisted of a blue silk skirt, embroidered with\r\nwhite, which reached almost to the floor, just allowing the queer,\r\nsandaled feet to become visible. This was surmounted by a black\r\nsilken tunic fastened at the waist, which did not allow the arms to\r\nbe of much use. The head was covered by a courtier’s hat of device\r\nindescribable, with a long metallic ribbon-like streamer falling down\r\nthe back. A stranger costume can hardly be conceived. Those of lesser\r\nrank wore the same skirt and tunic, but the headgear seemed to be\r\nmade of patent leather, banded with soft white material, an excellent\r\ninvention for a masquerade. The great ambassador, in a sing-song way,\r\nread from his parchment, whilst General Grant and all the others\r\nlistened. Then our President read something to the Japanese, Mr. Mori\r\nstanding and looking quietly on. Then President Grant introduced\r\nhis Cabinet. There was no-handshaking. The Americans snapped their\r\nheads in the usual jerky way, but the Japanese gave them the graceful\r\nsalaam of the East. An Oriental only knows how to bow.\r\n\r\nAfter everything official was concluded, then the Japanese allowed\r\ntheir hands to be touched by the Western barbarians. The Cabinet\r\nat this point offered their arms to the fluttering silks, and each\r\nMinister took a Japanese into the presence of Mrs. Grant, where the\r\npress had no desire to go. We claim there are certain inalienable\r\nrights. For the preservation of these we will endure all that heroism\r\nrequires, and for comfort and support we look to the people.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC GREET THE JAPANESE.\r\n\r\nUNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES EASTERN ROYALTY IS WELCOMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 6, 1872_.\r\n\r\nIt has already been truthfully stated that several thousand dollars\r\nof the people’s money have been set aside with which to entertain\r\nour Oriental guests. Last night’s experiment proved to be a superb\r\nsuccess. The Masonic Temple’s insignificant proportions were dwindled\r\nto Lilliputian size in the vain effort to make it resemble some\r\ngorgeous Eastern landscape. In the vain pursuit of this Quixotic\r\ndream General Myers purchased pink and white tarletan by the rod and\r\nfurlong; carpenters nailed it to the ceiling, to the roof overhead,\r\nand to every other available spot worth mentioning. Where there was\r\nno place for tarletan, the gallant general plastered the stars and\r\nstripes. A couple of fountains were placed in the upper part of the\r\nroom, and it was said Japan in miniature was represented on its\r\nwatery surface, but no persons present would have found it out unless\r\nthey had been told previously that this was the original program.\r\nHanging baskets were attached to the ceilings by long strings, a\r\nthreatening menace to the brains below, whilst birds in cages were\r\nsuspended in such a way as to cause serious alarm as to personal\r\nsafety. Then cards of invitation were issued, calling the faithful\r\ntogether between the hours of 9 and 11 o’clock. At 9 o’clock the\r\nwriter stood within the enchanted hall of the Masonic Temple. The\r\nsight was sorrowful if it was not imposing. The imperial chandeliers\r\nhad not been lighted. Carpenters were hard at work nailing tarletan\r\nto finish out the eastern sky. Workmen were hurrying with tables and\r\nflower pots and other et cetera of the landscape. Humbler hands\r\nwere scrubbing the floor, whilst one or more men were finishing\r\nup the corners with an unpoetical mop. In the centre of all this\r\ngrandeur stood the Secretary of State, supported by General Banks;\r\nonly a short distance from them, to the left, were the wives of these\r\ndistinguished officials. As the landscape was to be heated after the\r\nEsquimaux style, that is, by hanging lights and the warmth of human\r\nbodies, the damp floors had to be dried by opening the windows of\r\nthe magnificent temple. Through these yawning holes came the Arctic\r\nblasts. Mrs. Fish wrapped her royal ermine mantle around her; Mrs.\r\nBanks drew the folds of her opera cloak close. It had previously been\r\nagreed that those ladies who had elected themselves “to receive”\r\nshould get to the temple precisely at half past 8 to put the last\r\nhalf dainty touches to the brilliant surroundings. It was a few\r\nmoments after 9, and only Mrs. Fish and Mrs. Banks and a newspaper\r\nintruder, who was bound to tell the truth, unless she chose the\r\nmajesty of silence!\r\n\r\nA new actress in the drama--all ripples, laughter, and girlish\r\nabandon--Mrs. Colfax--came bouncing into the “eastern scene.” She\r\nhad thrown aside her wrappings in the dressing-room, and appeared\r\nclad in rich white silk court-train over a black silk petticoat, and\r\na white pom-pon in her hair. Her neck and arms were bare, and in\r\nthrough the open windows came the biting winds. The lithe, elastic\r\nframe shuddered like a jaunty yacht caught in the jaws of a terrific\r\nnor’wester, but succor was close at hand in shape of covering, and\r\nthe pearly shoulders disappeared from view. Next came Mrs. Governor\r\nCooke, magnificently arrayed in filmy lace and light green. If\r\nthe fountains in the corner had been larger and she had been more\r\nsylph-like the play of Undine might have been performed.\r\n\r\nAt last the tarletan was tacked, the last pot of flowers planted, the\r\nfloor mopped, the last bird--cage hung, the gas-jets lighted, and\r\nthe reception ladies had disposed themselves on the sofas. Let it\r\nbe remembered there were no other seats in the room. The door swung\r\nopen on its noiseless hinges, and in walked the precious Japanese\r\nmen, who had got themselves up in “Melican fashion” to please us\r\nrude barbarians of the West. How poor, weak, and shammy everything\r\nmust have seemed to their almond-shaped eyes! Flower-pots and pink\r\ntarletan, a bit of bright carpet, a cold, damp floor, a wintry\r\natmosphere faced them. As they walked through the narrow path which\r\nopened in the throng and led to the upper end of the hall, they\r\nsaw seated before them women no longer young and some of them far\r\nadvanced into that period which is called the “sere and yellow leaf\r\nof age,” with shoulders exposed below the point of modesty (if there\r\nis any such place in that delicate region), arms bare above the\r\nelbow! What a lesson it must have conveyed to our visitors! And yet\r\nthese women tried to look beautiful!\r\n\r\nThe foreign ministers, with their wives and daughters, had drawn\r\nthemselves into the usual diplomatic knot. There was the tall and\r\nqueenly Lady Thornton, elegant in pink silk and Chambrey gauze; and\r\nSir Edward Kingly as a knight of old; and pretty Madame Roberts,\r\nthe wife of the Spanish minister, in quaint costume, regardless\r\nof expense; magnificent Mademoiselle Freyre, the daughter of the\r\nPeruvian minister, who was the most gorgeously and costly appareled\r\nof any woman in the temple. A moderate fortune of diamonds nestled in\r\nher hair, whilst bust, arms and ears sparkled like the cave wherein\r\nwas caught unfortunate Sinbad the Sailor.\r\n\r\nAbout the banquet? It fell below the “Oriental landscape” attempt. It\r\nwas spread under the directions of A. G. Jiraudan. We never heard of\r\nthis man before, and yet he will be remembered for his stale boned\r\nturkey and hard crusts. In place of ice cream we were treated to\r\ndoubtful frozen custard. The salad might have been made of lamp oil,\r\njudging by its flavor. The coffee was such as contractors furnished\r\nthe army during the late war, and water was denied the last resting\r\nplace of a goblet. We drank it from the humble plebeian glass in the\r\nshape of a mug without a handle.\r\n\r\nFancy Sir Edward Thornton carrying this cup to his aristocratic lips\r\nat an entertainment given to royalty! Will not motherly Philadelphia\r\nor her sister city New York open the doors of hospitality and\r\nretrieve Washington from her niggardly disgrace? Not that the people\r\nof the capital are in fault, but a grave charge lies somewhere. Let\r\nexposure do its work.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL F. B. MORSE.\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL SERVICES HELD AT THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 17, 1872_.\r\n\r\nBecause we have no Westminster Abbey, or other royal sleeping\r\nplace when genius passes away, we have memorial services held at\r\nthe capital of the nation, under the shadow of the dome and the\r\nGoddess of Liberty. No man since the Saviour was born has ever\r\nhad such obsequies follow him to the grave as the plain citizen\r\nof a Republic who has just passed away. The ceiling of the House\r\nof Representatives had been pierced, and numerous wires were seen\r\nsuspended from the wall, and these ended below the Speaker’s desk,\r\nwhere an electric instrument was placed that transferred to those\r\npresent that throb of sympathy which alone makes the world akin. The\r\nvoices of seventy cities of the Union were heard speaking in the Hall\r\nof Representatives, for Professor Morse had given to each a tongue\r\nof flame. Click, click, click; from the bed of mighty waters came\r\nthe sob of the Old World. London sent her condolence, dated many\r\nhours subsequent to our time. April the sixteenth was dead and gone\r\nin England, but on the wings of the lightning came the intelligence\r\nof an unborn day. From Europe, Egypt, China, flashed sympathy with\r\nthis nation because a simple American citizen had gone to his eternal\r\nhome. In the self-same spot where all this tribute was paid to his\r\nmemory he had once stood--poor, obscure, and alone, working out the\r\nsolemn problem which should revolutionize the world.\r\n\r\nOn the floor of the House of Representatives might have been seen\r\npolitical strength, the judicial ermine, poet, painter, scholar,\r\nand humble citizen, and from the galleries looked down the womanly\r\nelement of the Republic. First of all came President Grant, with his\r\nsquare, immovable face. At his side walked Secretary Fish, whose\r\ncomeliness will ever furnish a theme for song and story. Then came\r\nSecretary Belknap, with a presence sufficiently warm and attractive\r\nto keep the whole Cabinet from spoiling for the want of caloric; then\r\nclear-cut Secretary Boutwell. Behind the Cabinet might have been\r\nseen the ponderous Supreme Judges, and their presence proved that\r\nthe Creator worked regardless of material when he constructed these\r\nexcellent men. On the Speaker’s stand stood the men whose speeches\r\nwere to honor the great man whose memory was to be embalmed. Speaker\r\nBlaine sat in his accustomed seat, with Vice-President Colfax at his\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Blaine touched his desk with his gavel, and silence fell upon\r\nthose congregated there. Then softly upon the ear sounded the silver\r\nvoice of Professor Morse’s aged pastor in solemn prayer, a simple\r\npetition, such as men utter when their feet have almost reached the\r\nother shore. After the Marine Band had been heard, Sunset Cox made\r\nsome remarks, and these were followed by a lengthy biography from\r\nSenator Patterson, which was altogether too long to be read when so\r\nmuch that was equally interesting was to follow.\r\n\r\nFernando Wood gave the most interesting account of the struggle\r\nand despair, but final triumph, of Professor Morse in his attempts\r\nto make the Government aid him in his undertaking. Mr. Wood is the\r\nonly man in Congress who was a member of that body at the time the\r\ninventor was pleading his cause. Professor Morse first laid his plans\r\nbefore his own Government, and they were rejected. He then went\r\nabroad, was absent two years, going, as did Columbus, from court to\r\ncourt, obscure, unheard, unnoticed. All undaunted, he came home, to\r\ntry for the last time to bring his wonderful discovery before the\r\nworld. It was this period of his life that the Hon. Fernando Wood\r\nbrought so vividly before the audience. With the mind’s eye the vast\r\ncongregation could see a threadbare, dejected man traversing the\r\nstreets of Washington, modestly attempting to electrify Congress\r\nwith a flash of his own genius. At last, when he was slowly settling\r\ninto the depths of despair, he had the supreme happiness of learning\r\nthat in the very last hours of a session a modest amount had been\r\nappropriated to carry out his apparently insane undertaking.\r\n\r\nFacing the speakers of the evening hung a portrait of the departed.\r\nIt was surrounded by a white groundwork, inlaid with an inscription\r\nin green letters: “What God hath wrought.” It was the picture of a\r\nman in the winter of life, with hair and beard of snow; a face not\r\nclassically made, but with fine, manly features, that must have\r\nglowed with indestructible beauty when lit up by the enthusiastic\r\ngenius within.\r\n\r\nSamuel F. B. Morse has gone the way of all the earth. He lived to\r\nknow that his name had been spoken by the intellectual world from\r\npole to pole. No more honor could be bestowed upon his ashes; and his\r\nmemory is embalmed in the soul of his country.\r\n\r\nOne of the speakers of the evening said that Professor Morse was born\r\nthe same year that Benjamin Franklin died, and the lives of the two\r\nmen seemed like joining a broken thread. And this reminds the writer\r\nof a man who might have been seen in that audience who to-day is\r\ntrying on the same field to get Congress to help him to demonstrate\r\nto the people that wires and batteries and Atlantic cables are only\r\nso much waste matter; that from given points anywhere on the world’s\r\nsurface that same lightning which Franklin brought to earth with\r\nhis kite can be harnessed to do his bidding. He has got his patent,\r\nhis invention, and his faith. As with Morse, Congress is afraid to\r\n“establish a precedent,” and so another inventor goes begging his\r\nway, perhaps to immortal fame.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PROMENADE.\r\n\r\nA SATURDAY HOLIDAY WITH ITS STROLLERS AND EQUIPAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 22, 1872_.\r\n\r\nSpring, though laggard, has at last smiled upon Washington. Once\r\nmore the bosom of Mother Earth has yielded up the frost and the\r\nbaby vegetation wears a smiling face. No longer the cold, bitter\r\nwinds smite the wayfarer, for the king of the season has tempered\r\ntheir edge. Saturday afternoon at the capital is a holiday. Congress\r\nusually adjourns from Friday until Monday. Not always the Senate,\r\nbut the House, which is a much harder-worked body, necessarily must\r\nhave a short respite for breathing time, although it is claimed by\r\nthe members that the last day of the week is the hardest of them all.\r\nA Senator who holds his position for six years can afford to take\r\nmore or less ease; but a member who has only two years to serve,\r\nif he has any ambition or talent, is about the hardest-worked man\r\nin the nation. He has the superhuman effort to perform of making\r\nhimself felt in Congress; at the same time he must manage to keep\r\nthe peace at home. The majority of them know there are men in their\r\ndistricts as gifted as themselves, who are working out the problem\r\nof rotation in office. So when Saturday afternoon comes they try to\r\nforget their troubles whilst riding up and down Pennsylvania avenue,\r\nwith the smoke of cigars issuing from their lips; but only the women\r\nsuffragists envy this deceitful happiness.\r\n\r\nSmoothly the carriage moves over the faultless pavement. Some of the\r\nmembers are wealthy enough to own their own “turnouts,” but these\r\nseem to have simply been purchased for their comfort, for there is\r\nscarcely anything about them suggestive of display. The carriage\r\nof Mrs. Secretary Fish is of the plainest and most comfortable\r\ndescription. It might have belonged to some Knickerbocker relative\r\nof a past generation, so prim and respectable it seems. Even the\r\nwheels have an aristocratic roll, entirely unlike the little plebeian\r\nsatin-lined concerns of the _parvenues_ which have been called into\r\nexistence in the same way that Cinderella’s fairy god-mother changed\r\nthe nut-shells and mice.\r\n\r\nWhen the Avenue was first lined with Nicholson pavement the carriages\r\nof the “first families” were seen rolling over it. In those days\r\nthe “thoroughbreds” belonging to the President were seen stretching\r\ntheir graceful limbs in contrast to the fast-trotting bays owned by\r\nSir Edward Thornton. The carriages of the foreign ministers were\r\nthen displayed in all their glory. The most magnificent were usually\r\noccupied by the South American ministers. The representative of Peru\r\ncould be seen in the daintiest affair, lined with white satin. The\r\nbody of the carriage is rounded and the top opened in the centre,\r\nand when thrown back it seemed to disclose a huge bird’s nest, and\r\nthe white satin in the distance bore a striking resemblance to eider\r\ndown. Altogether it looked like a portable nest filled with the\r\nrarest birds of a tropical clime, whilst coachman and footman in the\r\nmost gorgeous livery completed one of the handsomest pictures of a\r\nSaturday afternoon.\r\n\r\nAnother elegant establishment might have been noticed--a luxurious\r\ncarriage, with its light-bay prancing thoroughbreds attached. On\r\nthe creamy cushions, with their costly white lap-robe, was seated\r\na solitary woman in the earliest stages of the winter of life. She\r\nusually wore a white carriage costume--nothing but white from the\r\nsnowy ostrich tip to the Paris kids that encased her slender fingers.\r\nWho is it? A wealthy New York widow, too wise to be ensnared by\r\nfortune hunters, and not a remarkably shining target for arrows of\r\nthe other kind.\r\n\r\nIn those days not so very far remote the carriage of Senator Chandler\r\nmight have attracted attention, especially if the superbly dressed\r\nmadame and her accomplished daughter were securely inclosed within.\r\nBut, alas! alas! the _creme de la creme_ no longer patronize the\r\nNicholson pavement. This is given up to the blonde-haired beauties,\r\nfast youths, and tipsy Congressmen. The sunny side of the Avenue has\r\nbecome the fashionable promenade. What a changing human kaleidoscope!\r\n\r\nHere comes Secretary Robeson with his substantial bride. One feels\r\nlike lowering the mainsail of conversation in time to salute the\r\njolly consort and tender as they go sailing down the river of human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis is the Hon. Eugene Hale, of Maine, with his graceful new wife.\r\nWould the ladies know how the richest heiress in Washington is\r\nattired? In plain black cashmere and a simple straw hat.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the Hon. Benjamin F. Butler, one of our most famous\r\ncitizens, but so changed for the better that his nearest friends\r\nscarce recognize him. The time has been when General Butler was\r\ndubbed “belligerent,” but this must have been when he was in the\r\nactive fermentation of life. To-day the dregs have settled to\r\nthe bottom. The froth and scum were all whisked off in that last\r\nMassachusetts campaign. Nothing but the rich, generous body remains.\r\nEven the famous Don Piatt can find no peg to hang a fault on;\r\nbesides, the General is growing handsome, for the beauty of the\r\nspirit lights up the countenance, and this is the truest type of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nA slender and exceedingly graceful man hurries by--a gentleman whom\r\nthe wicked types made us call in our last letter “Sunset Cox.” We\r\nnever applied any such appellation to this gentleman, and for this\r\nreason we call attention to this correction. We have no personal\r\nacquaintance with the Hon. S. S. Cox, but men, like greenbacks,\r\npass in Washington for just about what they are worth. There is\r\nnothing about this Congressman to remind one of sunset, unless it\r\nis the brilliant coloring of his mind. This is the term which envy\r\nand malice have fastened upon him; and this uncourteous term cannot\r\nbe made to foreshadow his decline. Although he has not reached the\r\nnoontide of life, he is one of the readiest debaters, one of the most\r\neloquent and pleasing speakers, a fascinating writer, and in every\r\nsense of the word an accomplished man. If this is “sunset,” may we\r\nhave a little more of it in Congress, for we believe in men instead\r\nof parties, and when women vote we shall not stop to ask “Is he a\r\nRepublican?” “Is he a Democrat?” but we shall propound the awful\r\nquestion, “Who is the man?”\r\n\r\nYonder comes Mrs. Cresswell, clinging to the arm of the\r\nPostmaster-General--a pretty, petite woman, but not quite strong\r\nenough to stamp her impression on the age. And yet women who have\r\nonly social qualities upon which they can rely are remembered long\r\nafter their thrones are crumbled into dust.\r\n\r\nTo-day Mrs. Crittenden, of Kentucky, has her shrine in Washington.\r\nHer manners are quoted like the speeches of Clay or Webster. “Tell\r\nme,” inquired the writer of an elderly lady who was blessed with an\r\nexcellent memory, “what made Mrs. Crittenden so famous?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure I cannot tell, unless it was because she treated the\r\npoorest slaves as though they were ladies and gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nAN INTERVIEW IN THE WORKSHOP OF THE VETERAN STATESMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 15, 1873_.\r\n\r\nThis article is not written with the attempt to portray that which\r\nmakes Charles Sumner the central figure of the American Senate. No\r\nwoman possesses the gift to explore his mind. Yet there may be those\r\nwho read _The Press_ who feel an interest in the material part of\r\nhis nature, and who would like to know something about his every-day\r\nlife--how he looks, how he appears, and the impression he makes upon\r\nthe womanhood of the day. The so-called gentle sex are convened in\r\nsecret now, and men are not supposed to hear what we say. We will\r\nexamine Charles Sumner in the same way that we would a picture,\r\nwhilst his fine house and exquisite surroundings may be called the\r\nframe. Stand a little way off, because light is needed, and remember\r\nhe is seen to the best advantage in what he terms his “work-room.”\r\n\r\nAn easy chair high enough to support the head is drawn before the\r\nopen grate, and its capacious depths reflect the majestic figure\r\nof Mirabeau, but the face was designed by his Maker expressly\r\nfor Charles Sumner. It is one of the best living pictures that\r\nforeshadows the exceeding grace of autumn. The sense of harmony in\r\nits highest embodiment is fulfilled; but the vision is neutral-tinted\r\nwith all the scarlet glory left out. Even the long dressing-gown with\r\nits heavy tassels is soft, bluish-gray.\r\n\r\nIn scanning the features you realize that the artist has been trying\r\nto follow the classical order of art. You see it in the royal head\r\ncrowned by its abundant gray hair, in the oval face, and the clear\r\neyes which, if you watch closely, you can catch a glimpse of the\r\nsoul within. Observe the Greek nose, and finely moulded lips, which\r\nare never used except to make the world wiser and better. Now add the\r\nmanners of an English lord and an improvement on the polish of the\r\nChesterfieldian age, and we have the picture of the simple American\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe difference between spending a morning with Charles Sumner or\r\nlearning about him through the newspapers is like quenching our\r\nthirst at a fountain at Saratoga or procuring some of the elixir at\r\na drug store. It may be that your apothecary is honest, and that you\r\nare imbibing genuine Congress water, and then again perhaps you are\r\nthe victim of misplaced information. With his permission, let us\r\nmake a visit to that model “work-room,” because Charles Sumner will\r\ntake us into the company of the famous people of the world. He will\r\ntell us about meeting George Eliot at a dinner party, or about his\r\nbeing on the same ship with George Sand. Then we can say to him with\r\nenthusiasm: “Tell us about this wonderful George Eliot. How old is\r\nshe? Whom does she look like, and don’t you think her the greatest\r\nintellect represented by the womanhood of the present day?”\r\n\r\n“I think her a great woman, perhaps the greatest, but time must\r\ndecide all things connected with fame. I have a picture amongst my\r\nengravings very much like her, so much so that it would answer very\r\nwell for her portrait.”\r\n\r\nThe picture is found. It represents Lorenzo de Medici, and is ugly to\r\nthe last degree.\r\n\r\n“Not like that. No! It cannot be possible that her face is as wide\r\nas it is long; that these are her eyes, that her nose, that her\r\nmouth--why, this is the face you see looking out of the moon!”\r\n\r\n“It may be a plain face,” says Mr. Sumner, “but then it is so strong\r\nand noticeable, a face once seen that will never be forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“But her hair is cut short like a man’s.”\r\n\r\n“That is a matter of taste. You see at a glance that she lacks\r\nvanity, which is another sign of a great woman. I also met Mr. Lewes,\r\nher husband, at the same time. He is noted for his German studies,\r\nbut he is not so eminent as his wife.”\r\n\r\n“About her age, Mr. Sumner?”\r\n\r\n“That is a very hard point to settle, but without flattery I should\r\nthink her beyond 50.”\r\n\r\n“Beyond 50, and still writing the best love stories that the world\r\nenjoys?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Genius never grows old.”\r\n\r\n“But about George Sand?”\r\n\r\n“I met this famous woman many years ago on a steamer. We were\r\ngoing from Marseilles to Genoa. Among the passengers this woman in\r\nparticular attracted my attention, because she held by the hand a\r\nvery beautiful child. I have never observed such hair on a child’s\r\nhead. It was the real gold in color, and fell to his knees, not in\r\ncurls, but in waves. The lady wore the Spanish costume. I now recall\r\nher Spanish mantilla. She was short, we might call her thick-set, not\r\nhandsome, yet holding her child by the hand. I had a curiosity to\r\nfind out her name. She was accompanied by a tall, slender gentleman.\r\nThey kept aloof from the other passengers, and seemed to find\r\nsociety enough in each other. Upon inquiry I found her to be the\r\ncelebrated George Sand. At that time she was a topic of conversation\r\neverywhere. She made a very distinct impression on my mind. She was\r\ncomparatively a young woman. On board the same ship I was interested\r\nin two other passengers. This time it was quite an aged couple. The\r\nold gentleman carried his gold-headed cane and bustled around as if\r\nit was his mission to entertain everybody. One would almost think\r\nthat he thought himself in his own house and the people around him\r\nhis guests. His aged wife was at his side, helping in the good work.\r\nI noticed a respect shown them which age alone cannot always command.\r\nI soon learned the man to be one of Charles the Tenth’s Ministers,\r\nI am not quite certain which, but I think his minister of finance. I\r\nshall always remember the extreme courtesy and politeness of these\r\nold people and their endeavors to make everybody happy around them.”\r\n\r\n“Did they talk to George Sand?”\r\n\r\n“No! for the lady and her cavalier kept to themselves, and did not\r\nseem to need any exertions in their favor.”\r\n\r\nIn the conversation about the private lives of writers, a query came\r\nup of this kind: “Will a woman of good judgment marry a man fifteen\r\nyears younger than herself?”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to refer you to Mr. Disraeli. I know that to have been\r\na very happy marriage. I met Mr. Disraeli and his wife at Munich,\r\nwhen they were on their wedding tour. At the principal hotel we met\r\nat the breakfast table. Mr. Disraeli sat by the side of his newly\r\nmade wife. He might have been, or at least looked, about 30 years\r\nold. His intensely black hair smoothed to perfection. At that time\r\nhe had become famous as an author. Everything seemed noticeably new\r\nabout him. Mrs. Disraeli appeared like a kind-hearted, middle-aged\r\nEnglish woman, and Disraeli seemed the one to carry the idea that he\r\nhad drawn the prize. Time has shown how devoted they were to each\r\nother. In the last few months we hear of his walking by her side and\r\nsupporting her tenderly. She must have been nearly, if not quite,\r\n80. In my opinion Disraeli is one of the most remarkable men of this\r\nage when we remember the obstacles he had to overcome to reach the\r\nposition he occupies in England. The prejudice which exists there\r\nagainst his Jewish faith alone is enough to chill the most ambitious.”\r\n\r\nA book was drawn from a side table which had been printed in 1460.\r\nIt was in the German language, and, with one exception, it is as\r\nperfect as a book published yesterday. Its binding would shame our\r\nbest modern work.\r\n\r\n“This,” said the man in gray, “reminds me of a conversation I once\r\nhad with Macaulay, as well as an incident of my school-boy days. The\r\nmaster once said to the scholars, ‘Can any of you tell me in which\r\nyear printing was invented?’ No answer. ‘Remember, children, it was\r\nthe year which contains the figure 4 three times.’ The small brains\r\nwere greatly puzzled. At last one little fellow answers ‘1444’. When\r\nI grew older I tried to ascertain the proof of this; but I have\r\nnever been able to find which year printing was invented. It was\r\nsomewhere about 1450, and, from all I can learn, I am inclined at\r\ntimes to think the Dutch instead of the Germans made this discovery.\r\nI remember a long talk I had with Macaulay on this subject. I\r\nwas on the side of the Dutch; he was for the Germans. At last he\r\nproposed that we should adjourn to the British Museum and search the\r\nauthorities, and have this weighty matter decided. I did not go,\r\nbut I have always regretted it. We all remember Macaulay’s Essay on\r\nMilton. I think it ranks with the best of his writings; yet he told\r\nme that he regretted nothing so much as its publication; and this\r\nproves the incompetency of authors to judge their own works.”\r\n\r\nWe spoke about the changing seasons of human life, and the writer\r\nasked the statesman a question which lies very near to every woman’s\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n“Is beauty confined to one period of our existence? Infancy and\r\nchildhood are only promises; the summer is something more; but give\r\nme the golden reality of October or the bracing chill of a December\r\nlandscape if the intellectual powers are not on the wane.”\r\n\r\n“I have known beauty to go with the years, but this I fear is the\r\nexception, not the rule. One of the handsomest women I ever knew was\r\nthe mother of Lord Brougham. At the time I met her she must have been\r\nover 80 years of age. I was then quite a boy, and abroad for the\r\nfirst time, and met with the kindness to be invited to the castle of\r\nthis nobleman. The manners and figure of Mrs. Brougham betrayed none\r\nof the decrepitude of age. I never shall forget her extreme kindness\r\nand efforts to entertain a young American. I remember that amongst\r\nother things she brought the bag which her son wore at the time he\r\nwas Lord High Chancellor. This bag is worn around the neck of this\r\nexalted officer of the British Government. It is an elaborate affair,\r\nmade of silk, gold lace, and embroidery. When the Lord Chancellor\r\ngoes into the official presence of his sovereign this bag rests upon\r\nhis breast, and it contains the petitions which the loyal subjects\r\ndesire to be laid before the throne. Every new Chancellor must have a\r\nnew bag, and these are always retained as the precious heirlooms of\r\nthe family. The great seal of England is always kept in the bottom of\r\nthis bag. Lord Brougham’s mother related an incident connected with\r\nthis small affair of silken embroidery:\r\n\r\n“‘When my son Henry was in the presence of the King this bag was\r\ncrammed full of petitions, and he became very tired taking them out.\r\nAt last he said, “I hope this bag will soon be emptied.”\r\n\r\n“‘“Empty it of everything except the great seal of England,” said his\r\nmajesty.’”\r\n\r\nBut the picture which illustrates the man is not completed, and\r\nnewspaper letters must come to an end.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN’S INFLUENCE FOR GOOD.\r\n\r\nSHAPING LEGISLATION FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 29, 1873_.\r\n\r\nBefore the present form of government was inaugurated, Washington,\r\nin every respect, resembled a gambling or watering spa. A session of\r\nCongress might be termed “the season.” It was called a city through\r\ncourtesy, because in reality it was only a straggling, awkward\r\nvillage. The brute creation traversed its streets, whilst forlorn\r\npedestrians picked their way over disjointed sidewalks. The greater\r\nproportion of its people were made up of “birds of passage.” The\r\ncitizen proper, if caught, was found to belong to one or the other\r\nof the two extremes of the social scale. He might be of the line of\r\nLord Baltimore, with the blue blood of a foreign aristocracy coursing\r\nthrough his attenuated frame; but the chances are that he was some\r\npoor artisan or shopkeeper, who picked up a precarious living\r\nexisting on the double-distilled crumbs which fell from Uncle Sam’s\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nWashington had no such electric life as Philadelphia enjoys, imparted\r\nto her by her commerce and manufactures. When Congress expired, the\r\ncity, like a lazy bear, snuggled down to its long, snoozey sleep, and\r\nwhen waking-time came, like poor Bruin, it found nothing left but its\r\nclaws. In its famished condition it took a great many strangers and\r\nCongressmen to fill the aching void. But gone are the lawmakers and\r\nCredit Mobiliers! Vanished the bare shoulders and Paris frippery! But\r\nWashington, newly baptized and regenerated, takes her place in the\r\nlong line of sister cities whose foundations are securely laid by the\r\nstrong hands of her permanent citizens.\r\n\r\nYesterday our new legislature met for the third time. The hall\r\nconsecrated to the delegates and members of the council was filled\r\nwith well-dressed, fine-looking men, adorned with shining beavers\r\nand immaculate boots. They occupied all available space on the\r\nfloor; they poured over long flights of stairs, and spread out in a\r\nbroad expanse of human life on the pavement below. “These,” said a\r\nbystander, “are taxpayers of the District,” and the response came\r\nquick, “This is the real Washington, wide-awake!”\r\n\r\nIn an upper room of the same building at the same hour the council\r\nmeet. This nice little body is called together by the governor,\r\na president is then elected who presides during the session, and\r\naltogether considerable honor is evoked from a small outlay, and in\r\nthe meantime the siestas and summer comforts of the principal heads\r\nof the government need not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nBelow, in the house of delegates, the excitement deepens. The\r\nopposing candidates seem to have equal strength. The fight is all\r\nwithin the limits of one party. The three Democrats look around as\r\ninnocently as if they were not inwardly praying for the fate of\r\nthe Kilkenny cats to overtake their opponents. Two women are seen,\r\neach with a delegate fastened securely by the buttonhole. They\r\nare both genuine ladies--one being the wife of a leading United\r\nStates Senator, the other known in Washington and elsewhere for\r\nher disinterested labors in behalf of the poor and unfortunate of\r\nher own sex. What does it all mean? One of the gentle lobbyists is\r\ninterrogated:\r\n\r\n“We have two men up as candidates for speaker; one is a good husband\r\nand father. He is with us in all our works of reform. He believes in\r\ndoing as much for women as for men. The other is bad--just as bad as\r\nhe can be. He loves women because they are women.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that every man’s fault?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! but just look at him. He believes in keeping us women\r\ndown, denying us the rights which the Creator designed for us.”\r\n\r\n“If we are to judge men by their looks I cannot see where the other\r\ncandidate has the advantage. They both look as if they didn’t exactly\r\nrealize the difference between women and peaches.”\r\n\r\nThe woman continued: “I know one to be a good man, and I am going to\r\nwork for him. Excuse me, here comes one of the doubtful delegates. I\r\nmust speak to him.”\r\n\r\nThe delegate is arrested in his onward flight, and proves to be one\r\nof the ablest men in the house, as well as an accomplished gentleman.\r\n\r\n“I learn, Mr. H----, that you are going to desert us?”\r\n\r\n“Desert the ladies?--never!”\r\n\r\n“I mean that you are going for Shepherd?”\r\n\r\n“That is another thing. I have thought the matter over seriously, and\r\nwhilst I don’t approve of all the deeds done by the board of public\r\nworks, upon the whole I must give them my hearty support.”\r\n\r\n“But you know my candidate is a good man.”\r\n\r\nThe tall, handsome biped looked down on the little woman, and his\r\neyes twinkled whilst he said: “We are all good men.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the other candidate came up--the poor, bad man who had\r\nno woman like Mungo Park to bring him milk and grind him corn.\r\n\r\n“You know, Mr. Shepherd, that I have opposed you from the start. I\r\nhave been doing all I could; I don’t deny it.”\r\n\r\nThe great, sharp, white teeth close over the red under lip, as if a\r\nlaugh must be strangled regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\n“I know it; but I cannot understand your opposition. I love the\r\nladies; I always have.”\r\n\r\n“That may be; but you opposed our movement. When you were editor of\r\nthe _Republican_ you made fun of me.”\r\n\r\n“But you must know an editor cannot oversee everything that goes into\r\nhis paper.”\r\n\r\n“But the tone of the paper I complain of.”\r\n\r\n“I do not oppose the movement of reform, but I earnestly object to\r\nthe manner in which you intend to bring it about! but I must go. I\r\nhope you will think better of me,” and the jolly figure and winning\r\nface disappears.\r\n\r\nThe delegate who spoke so earnestly in favor of the board of public\r\nworks pauses to be introduced to the Senator’s wife. As he is about\r\nto depart the writer asked his opinion in regard to woman coming to\r\nsuch a place to influence “legislation.”\r\n\r\n“I rather like it.”\r\n\r\n“Do not let your gallantry get the better of truth. For my part I\r\noppose it, for this reason, we accomplish nothing. Every Samson on\r\nthis floor ought to have had his ambrosial locks sheared before he\r\ncame here. Would the old Scriptural giant have held still in public\r\nwhilst that sly puss, Delilah, was engaged in her artistic work?\r\n\r\n“I cannot think of anything that would tempt me to be found here to\r\ninfluence legislation. I came with my pen to make a picture for _The\r\nPress_, just as I shall go to the Virginia hills, with my pencil and\r\nportfolio, when the weather becomes fine.”\r\n\r\n“This is a serious subject; but I am inclined to ask the women to\r\ngo with us wherever we are obliged to go. I have had a good deal to\r\ndo with politics since the new government was inaugurated, and we\r\nhave had some pretty stormy times. We have had our meetings broken\r\nup with howls and hootings, and it seemed as if anarchy had come.\r\nOne night we called a meeting in one of the worst wards of the city,\r\nwhere we had all along been able to accomplish little or nothing.\r\nI knew something out of the ordinary way must be done. So a short\r\ntime before the call was made I gave out that upon such an evening\r\nthere would be a meeting at a certain church in the neighborhood;\r\nthat a portion of the gallery would be set aside for the ladies.\r\nThe colored men were especially invited to bring their wives and\r\ndaughters. I then called upon my political friends and told them how\r\nmatters stood, and urged them to tell their wives what we were trying\r\nto do. The ladies, God bless them! put on their Sunday bonnets and\r\ngood dresses and came out; the colored women did the same, and the\r\nmeeting in that ward was the event of the season. Everything passed\r\noff pleasantly, and we went home better men.”\r\n\r\n“According to your story, not quite all of you are good men.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; in the presence of some women we are all good men; the night I\r\nhave been talking about proves it.”\r\n\r\nAll this took place before the gavel sounded. When the last blow\r\nfell, Edwin L. Stanton arose in his seat and called the assembly\r\ntogether. From various directions came twenty-two men differing in\r\nrace, color, condition, and servitude. The tall, haughty Caucasian,\r\nwith his thin nostril and flowing beard, was followed by the inky\r\nAfrican so lately held in bondage; but the procession was finished\r\nby the chain which the Almighty has forged to bind the white parent\r\nto the black one in the shape of a man in bronze. In the solemn\r\nstillness a semi-circle was formed, and twenty-two right hands\r\npointed upward whilst Justice Carter administered the oath to support\r\nthe Constitution. Whilst the Judge was reading, the circle began\r\nto melt, and when he came to the part which relates to the taking\r\nof bribes in exchange for votes, every white man and black man had\r\ndisappeared. But that most solemn obligation was to be subscribed to\r\nby a solitary mortal who stood like a fixed star in his place. Down\r\non your knees to the man who stands by the _right_! God help us! It\r\nwas the man in bronze.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING REUNIONS.\r\n\r\nATTRACTIVE GATHERINGS OF THE NATION’S CELEBRITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 11, 1874_.\r\n\r\nOn a vein leading off the great artery of Seventh street may be seen\r\na modest mansion of four stories, yet better known and more highly\r\nappreciated in this curious city than far more pretentious piles of\r\nbrick and mortar. For more than a quarter of a century the occupant\r\nof that point of the compass has clung to this spot and proved to\r\nthe country that the character and qualities of an American citizen,\r\nindependent of his opinions, decide his standing in the community.\r\nBelonging to the old Democratic regime, yet always opposed to\r\nslavery, like President Grant, he conceived the idea that it was\r\nbest “to unload to save the party.” When a member of Mr. Buchanan’s\r\nCabinet, he wrote a letter to Secretary Toucey, which should be\r\nprinted to-day, to show the people that the country is safe in the\r\nhands of men of high character, irrespective of race, color, creed or\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nLet us modestly ask what draws the intellectual cream to the modest\r\nhouse 707 H street? The press, artists, scholars, travelers, the\r\nPresident, members of the Cabinet, and the portable brains of\r\nboth branches of Congress; the real heads of the Departments; the\r\ncultivated and most highly appreciated of our Washington citizens,\r\ngo there as the “faithful” enter a Mahommedan mosque. The eye is not\r\ndazzled with satin and ebony. The feast or collation is invisible.\r\nWould you know the secret, reader? The master and his daughter are\r\nthe magnets, and this is the explanation. A certain human quality\r\nis possessed by the Hon. Horatio King unlike the usual gems which\r\ncomprise our national crown jewels. He is the only instance of the\r\nkind since our Government was founded where a man began with the\r\nlowest clerkship, salary $1,000 per year, and was promoted step by\r\nstep, without political influence, simply by the force of integrity\r\nof character, until he stood on the last round, a full-fledged\r\nCabinet minister. It was his mind that moulded, in a great measure,\r\nour foreign postal relations as they existed a few years ago. In\r\nmanner he reminds one of the late William H. Seward, possessing in a\r\nremarkable degree the same simplicity, dignity, and grace. Now add\r\nthe courtliness of the English nobleman without the condescension,\r\nand the role is filled. This delightful compound makes the highest\r\ntitle a citizen can win. It is called the true American gentleman.\r\n\r\nAnd the daughter, Mrs. Annie King, for though a widow she retains\r\nthe family name. Who remembers Miss Harriet Lane when she presided\r\nat the White House, her regal manners, her queenly beauty, her high\r\ntone of character? The sun by day or the moon by night would as soon\r\nbe a subject for the scandalmonger as the accomplished niece of the\r\nPresident. Have we any such women left in Washington? It is true they\r\nare rare, but they are here, just as diamonds of the first water are\r\nfound in remote parts of the earth. The portrait of Mrs. King bears\r\na striking resemblance to those of Miss Harriet Lane taken when\r\nshe was “the leading lady of the land.” Mrs. King is the favorite\r\n“American lady” with the foreign legations. Her residence abroad made\r\nher familiar with the French language, which she speaks as fluently\r\nas English. Some great writer has said “that all we have to show for\r\nthe civilization of five thousand years is the difference between a\r\nwigwam and a lady’s parlor.” Let us beg to differ with the man who\r\nwrote that. At least, before the writer gave such a final decision\r\nabout civilization, he should have come to Washington and attended a\r\nPresident’s levee, a Cabinet crush, and then beached himself high and\r\ndry at 707 H street.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the French painter,\r\nGerard, who was a resident of Paris, opened his salon and held what\r\nhe termed “reunions.” To these gatherings came all that was refined,\r\nelegant, and distinguished at this gayest of capitals. Gerard’s salon\r\nconsisted of a floor of four rooms, with an ante-room. At 12 o’clock\r\nhe gave his guests a cup of tea and the same everlasting cakes, says\r\nMadame Ancelot, the whole year round. Monsieur Gerard had no help\r\nfrom his wife so far as the entertainment was concerned, for she took\r\nher seat at a whist table and kept it until the last guest was gone.\r\nBut Gerard’s “reunions” became known all over Europe, for the man had\r\nthe talent to draw all that was celebrated in literature, science,\r\nand art to his humble headquarters. “From Madame de Stael down to\r\nMlle. Mars, from Talleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo down to M. Thiers,\r\nthere were no celebrities, male or female, that during thirty years\r\n(from 1805 to 1835) did not flock to Gerard’s house, and all, no\r\nmatter how different might be their characters or position, agreed in\r\nthe same opinion as to their host.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Gerard termed his modest entertainments “reunions,” and this\r\nmust be the original from whence the Hon. Horatio King took the name.\r\nTransplanted, it flourishes at our own crude capital.\r\n\r\nAt the last Saturday evening “reunion” Grace Greenwood in her\r\ninimitable way, gave us dramatic readings in costume. Her\r\npersonations exceeded anything the writer has seen either on the\r\nstage or in private life. Charlotte Cushman, Fanny Kemble, Scott\r\nSiddons, last but not least, our own Grace Greenwood, make all the\r\nstars of the first magnitude that we have now in this particular\r\nheaven of genius. Attorney-General Williams says that “he looks upon\r\nGrace Greenwood as the best writer and the most gifted woman in the\r\ncountry.” This decision is legal, and may be considered final. Years\r\nago the great and good Horace Mann said that she was not only the\r\nmost gifted, but that she was “the most beautiful woman he had ever\r\nseen;” and his passion for her in youthful days was as pure as though\r\nshe had been a disembodied spirit. It is so rare that beauty and\r\ngenius are wedded to one soul. In the opinion of the writer, Grace\r\nGreenwood is a handsomer woman at 50 than in the “long ago.” It is\r\nthe difference between the budding green of April and the garnered\r\nglory of September. If her portrait was taken as she stands before\r\nus to-day and hung in the Corcoran gallery, the spectator would say,\r\n“This must be a Roman matron who lived before the pall of the Middle\r\nAges darkened the earth.” How does she look? A brunette of the purest\r\ntype, with clear-cut features, sorrowful, inquiring eyes, that shine\r\nas though a quenchless flame burned somewhere in the solitude of her\r\nown soul. There are some pictures which are burned into the human\r\nmind. We shall never forget her personation of “Over the Hills to the\r\nPoor House,” one of Carleton’s poems. The poverty-stricken outfit,\r\nthe worn carpet-bag, the iron-bowed spectacles, the gray hair. When\r\nthe propriety of “readings” was canvassed at Plymouth Church, Henry\r\nWard Beecher said, “Object to it! I never object to one of the best\r\nsermons that can be preached.” From the highest to the humblest of\r\nthat goodly company scarce a dry eye was to be seen. Then she told us\r\nwhat Miss Tattle, from Buttonville, saw at a “Rejective Session of\r\nthe Senate.” This was followed by that which proves man to have been\r\nthe only “created laughing animal.”\r\n\r\nAmong those who enjoyed the delightful evening were Mrs. Senator\r\nStewart, the daughter of ex-Senator Foote, as all the world knows who\r\nreads the newspapers. Mrs. Stewart has recently returned from abroad\r\nand brought back with her the polish of Continental Europe. Perhaps\r\nshe has returned with only that which she took away, for she has the\r\nsame frank, winning address that used to distinguish Madame Slidell,\r\nand which is seen in the highest state of perfection in Madame Le\r\nVert, who was also present.\r\n\r\nWhat is that quality which makes the Northern and Southern women\r\nso unlike? It cannot be tasted. It cannot be described. It is the\r\nsame kind of difference which exists between a white, mealy Northern\r\npotato and a Southern yam; a Baldwin apple and a banana in the\r\nNorthern woods and Southern jungle--but only a man’s descriptive\r\npowers can do this subject justice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Attorney-General Williams was there, most talked about,\r\nmost superb woman, in some respects, in Washington. One of your\r\nCleopatras. Such a creation requires a separate paper, just as some\r\ngems must have a solitaire setting. And there was Mary S. Nealy,\r\nso well-known in letters and art at the capital. There was Mrs.\r\nAmes, the amiable and accomplished daughter of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, as well as the widow of the late Admiral Dahlgren, who by\r\nthe way, is fast earning a place in literature by her perseverance\r\nand talent. Possessing an ample fortune, a leader in the fashionable\r\nworld whenever she chooses to reign, yet, like Lady Jane Grey, she\r\nchooses the solitude of the scholar, and delights in the labor of her\r\npen. But newspaper letters must come to an end, because there is no\r\nspace to write what might be said about the gentlemen who were there.\r\nAttorney-General Williams and Senator Stewart alone are as much as\r\none newspaper can carry, if all their good deeds are related. So this\r\nwill end with a little paper which Mr. King read between the “acts.”\r\nHe said it had been “picked up in the hall,” in all probability where\r\nhe dropped it.\r\n\r\n      “THE GRACES.\r\n\r\n      “By grace divine we come together here,\r\n      To pass the time in pleasure and good cheer;\r\n      To study all the graces that adorn\r\n      The maiden fair or widow ‘all forlorn,’\r\n      The grace of speech, of music, and of song,\r\n      The grace of conversation, short or long.\r\n      But name the _graces_, these and all the rest,\r\n      _Grace_ Greenwood is the grace we love the best.”\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nA FIELD DAY IN THE SENATE AND STELLAR ATTRACTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 26, 1874_.\r\n\r\nYesterday was termed what is called a “field day” in the Senate. The\r\nopposing forces which go to make up the intellectual aggregate of\r\nthis highest legislative body met in combat, and the whole nation is\r\nwide awake as to the result. Two men, both claiming to be Republican\r\nSenators, both as ambitious as the Evil One when he led Christ to the\r\nmountain-top, engaged in an intellectual hand-to-hand fight, but let\r\nit be recorded that Senator Morton alone lost his amiable temper. But\r\nwho ever saw a chained tiger that did not lose his temper? Physically\r\nspeaking, no two men could appear more dissimilar. When Carl Schurz\r\nis seen sitting in his seat he does not impress the spectator with\r\nthe idea of a tall man. But when he rises you wonder when his head\r\nwill stop going up towards the clouds. After he has “towered” to\r\na certain altitude, and all the links and kinks and hinges seem\r\nstraightened, he gives his shoulders another twist upward, as much\r\nas to say, “Shades of the mighty Schiller! if one only could touch\r\nthe top of space!” Then there is a shake of the long, brown, curling\r\nlocks as a lion tosses his mane, for all the royal animals of\r\ncreation use similar signs and symbols. The mouth opens. It is not a\r\ngrowl. The ear is greeted with the sweetest and softest strains of\r\nthe human voice. Who has ever read Oliver Wendell Holmes’ description\r\nof those velvet and flute-like tones that ravish the soul like the\r\nheavenly melodies of Beethoven? Carl Schurz has a voice like the wind\r\nsighing through the sugar cane, and his classical English floats\r\nin a sea of rhythmical measure. In manner this distinguished German\r\norator would not attract notice for either awkwardness or grace. The\r\npersonality of the man is lost, because the mind is fully engaged in\r\nfollowing his subtle thread of argument, which is fairly embroidered\r\nwith pearls of thought. “I love America! I believe in her people!\r\nI have faith in her great future! But America must be honest. She\r\nmust be true to everlasting principle. Parties, fashions, men, pass\r\naway, but incorruptible integrity, whether applied to nations or\r\nindividuals, remains the same in all ages, from the beginning to the\r\nend of time.”\r\n\r\nThese words, as near as the writer can remember, were meant to bear\r\nupon the inflation of the currency. He wishes to have our greenbacks\r\nfixed upon a foundation so that our money will have a permanent\r\nvalue. In other words, he says a dollar of the national currency is\r\nworth eighty-eight cents to-day; six months hence it may be worth\r\nseventy cents value in gold or silver. He believes that a nation\r\nlike this ought to fix our money in such a shape that the people\r\ncannot be at the mercy of the sharpers of Wall street and Boston.\r\nWhy should the great American Republic have a fluctuating currency?\r\nIs it because our greenbacks are only promises to pay, and that the\r\nRepublic may become a defaulter in the end, therefore the nation’s\r\nnotes are in a certain way just like the private citizen’s? This\r\nmighty problem of finance requires a kind of statesmanship which has\r\nnot been brought into the arena of politics during this session of\r\nCongress. Carl Schurz says if we make more currency that which we\r\nalready have will be depreciated.\r\n\r\nWhilst Carl Schurz was addressing the vast audience, Senator Morton\r\nhad turned in his seat so that he sat facing the orator. Not a word\r\nthat fell from the speaker’s lips were lost to this highly gifted\r\nproduct of the great State of Indiana, most noticeable and in one\r\nsense the most interesting member of the United States Senate. We\r\nhave all read the story in the “Arabian Nights,” where the men of\r\na certain city had become so powerful and so very naughty that the\r\ngenii had to do something that would not destroy the men for all\r\nusefulness yet would prevent any outbursts of wickedness or folly.\r\nSo he touched them all with the enchanter’s wand at some point below\r\nthe shoulder blades. Instantly the men lost the power of locomotion.\r\nWhilst the upper part of their persons were alive, the lower became\r\nblack marble. But what Senator Morton has lost in one extreme, he has\r\ngained in another, for to-day he is the strongest man who attempts to\r\nlead in his faction of the Senate. There is something about his head\r\nwhich bears a striking resemblance to the portraits of Webster, and\r\nhe is thought to be one of the most forcible speakers in the Senate.\r\nHis arguments are hurled at his opponent as cannon balls fly to kill\r\nthe enemy. But if he has a hard, rugged, sharp side to his intellect,\r\nthere is another as fascinating as that said to be possessed by Aaron\r\nBurr or Mirabeau. Men may not agree with this opinion, because they\r\nnever can see that point of his character which is revealed to women\r\nalone. Men see only the surface of men. It is left to women to go\r\ndown into the depths and bring up the pearls and coral.\r\n\r\nAbout the audience that listened to Senators Schurz and Morton.\r\nThere was a large delegation from the House, composed of those who\r\nhave apparently taken the deepest hold of the slippery question of\r\nfinance. Benjamin Butler was there, flushed, worried, and apparently\r\nsomewhat worn in his encounter with the committee of Boston,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nHe had just had a conference with them in regard to the collectorship\r\nof Boston in his committee room, and told them “hands off,” and yet\r\nhe was not happy. They, too, had come over from the House to listen;\r\nsharp, keen Puritans, determined as so many bloodhounds. But the\r\nnation realizes that when Massachusetts is torn by her own intestine\r\nbroils the rest of the world is safe, the Centennial will flourish,\r\nand no possible harm can follow.\r\n\r\nFew men have attracted the notice of the Senate and secured that\r\nclose attention as did Carl Schurz in his effort of yesterday. Even\r\nSenator Sumner laid aside his pen and pushed back his large pile\r\nof papers, apparently giving himself up to the fascination of the\r\nhour. Senator Mitchell, of Oregon, sat leaning back upon a sofa in\r\na distant corner. He had resigned his Senatorial seat for the time\r\nto benefit a prominent member of Congress. As he appeared, with the\r\ngorgeous walls of the Senate for a background, no finer picture\r\ncould be found for an artist’s copy. Tall, elegant, and graceful,\r\nwith a singular purity of complexion, his head crowned by a glory\r\nof chestnut hair, such as the ancient painters used to delight to\r\ntransfer to their canvas, large deep blue eyes, such as Raphael gave\r\nhis Madonnas. “Fell into trouble with women,” said the newspapers.\r\nWill water fall when the clouds are moist? Will labor seek the\r\nneighborhood of capital? Alas! Will a duck swim? Senator Mitchell is\r\nnot to blame because he is the handsomest specimen in the Senate. He\r\ndid not make himself. Suppose he made mistakes or committed mischief\r\nbefore the sense of right and justice was crystallized in his mind?\r\nWho knows anything about the temptations placed before Adonis? What\r\ndid Adam do when Eve gave him the apple and told him it would do\r\nhim good? It is true the Oregon legislature have never discussed\r\nthe subject of apples, but they sent Senator Mitchell back indorsed\r\nby the highest authority of the State, and he has only to take hold\r\nof legislation with heart and soul, and live the same pure and\r\nconsistent life that he has in the last few years, and the country\r\nwill honor him as one of her most distinguished sons.\r\n\r\nWho is that leaning back in all that negligent abandon so becoming\r\nthe occupant of that particular chair? It is the silver Senator of\r\nNevada--the successor of Jim Nye. “Why, the man that wants my place,”\r\nsays Jeems, “has a silver mine; do you think I can beat that?” Well,\r\nthere he is, the monarch of the silver mine, watching with closest\r\nattention the eloquent speaker. Everything about him looks as if\r\nit had a standard value. If he should happen to trip and fall a\r\nmetallic ring would be heard, just as if a new coin was thrown upon\r\nthe pavement. A fine-looking man, rather below the medium height, but\r\nthe most perfect specimen of high and costly living to be seen in\r\nthe Senate. One can imagine him looking at the world and saying, “I\r\nam bound to get all the comfort. My house shall be a palace, my bath\r\nshall be champagne!” As yet he has done nothing to make himself felt\r\nas an integral part of this august body, but is prized at the capital\r\nbecause he is pleasing in manner, he is a United States Senator,\r\nand last but not least, he is a dashing widower with a silver mine\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON CAPITOL HILL.\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE NAVY YARD--THE CARROLL AND BUTLER RESIDENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _September 24, 1874_.\r\n\r\nThe exclusive aristocracy of Washington is found in that part of the\r\ncity known as Capitol Hill. Upon the emerald heights crowned with\r\ngardens and flowers, the proud old families of ancient lineage occupy\r\ntheir ancestral acres almost under the dome of our beloved Capitol.\r\nWhilst standing on the brow of “the Hill,” if the eye is directed\r\nsouthward, the baronial home of the Carrolls scourges the vision with\r\nits monastic severity. A wall as round as the arm of beauty encircles\r\nthe extensive grounds, and the haughty old castle within is a\r\nperpetual aggression to the paint, parvenu, and pretence that spread\r\nitself at the “West End.” The spirit of holiness seems to envelop\r\nthis elegant home. At certain hours of the twenty-four the dainty\r\noccupants emerge to go upon their rounds of daily charity. Like so\r\nmany nuns, yet a part of the world, they bear the same relation\r\nto modern society at the capital as the old French regime to the\r\nBonaparte reign. Earlier blossoms of the family tree have worn the\r\nproudest coronets of England; and these lovely silver-haired sisters\r\nare characterized by the same courtly refinement and queenly grace.\r\nTo the north, but within a stone’s throw of the Capitol, may be seen\r\nthe pile once known as the city home of General Washington. Within\r\nthe remembrance of the child of a dozen summers it remained as the\r\ngreat statesman left it, except it had succumbed to the gnawing tooth\r\nof Time. The high plateau upon which it was built had in a great\r\nmeasure crumbled. The windows were mostly broken and the chimneys\r\nwere beginning to fall. But the hand of modern Progress seized it\r\nand a pretentious building, made up of the old walls, now marks the\r\nsite; too large for a boarding-house and too small for a hotel,\r\ndestitute of kitchens and servants’ quarters, useless as a mansion,\r\nbut splendid as a tomb. But nothing in the great laboratory of Nature\r\nis lost, for the ghostly brick and mortar serves to mark the hallowed\r\nspot sacred to the memory of the Father of his Country, and no Mount\r\nVernon corporation can pen cows within the precious enclosure and\r\npeddle pale fluid at so much per gallon or so much per glass.\r\n\r\nOn Capitol Hill may be found Christ Church, where Washington and\r\nother early Presidents worshipped. The bricks of which it is\r\nconstructed were baked on English soil and tossed over the stormy\r\nAtlantic. The antique building has none of the fancy airs of the\r\nmodern cathedral, but it is built square and unpretending, an\r\noutward emblem of the spirit of those who gave it birth. It was\r\nmade as a defence against the elements whilst the inmates were\r\nholding communion with the Most High. In the large, square pews\r\nsat Washington and Lafayette, whilst the gallant Hamilton held the\r\nslip-door that the “first lady of the land” might enter there.\r\n\r\nScarcely three blocks from the church is situated the navy yard, in\r\nmany respects the most attractive point in Washington, because it\r\nis the great headquarters of the maritime power of the Republic.\r\nInside the grounds the visitor is treated with a sight of wonderful\r\nnaval trophies. Here are the guns captured off Tripoli when boarded\r\nby the brave Decatur, and here not long ago might have been seen\r\nsome of the same kind of iron pots with the lid on that went down\r\non Cape Hatteras with twenty poor fellows aboard. Holmes, Whittier,\r\nLongfellow, ahoy! Who will give us the story of the _Monitor_? the\r\ntriumph in the James River? the tragedy off the stormy cape?\r\n\r\nAt the navy yard the great war vessels come in on purpose to go into\r\ndry dock and have all their corporeal troubles removed. The most\r\nmajestic object in nature is the awful face of the mountain. The\r\nmost sublime picture in art is a great war vessel lifted from the\r\nwater and placed on the land. Look at the enormous hull, with its\r\nribs of oak, sheathed with copper; the lofty masts almost piercing\r\nthe clouds; and yet these little pigmies, scarce six feet high, put\r\nher points together. Certainly one is not to blame for asking if the\r\nLord is as small in proportion to his created works. What artist will\r\ngive us a picture of the great war vessel that was driven four miles\r\ninland by a tidal wave, at the Island of St. Thomas? Think of a ship\r\nburied on the land, just as though it were a mortal, and had a soul\r\nto be saved! “Cut the ropes, and every man for himself!” rang out the\r\nshrill command of the captain above the roar of the elements. “In an\r\ninstant,” says an eye witness, “the solid wall of water was upon us.\r\nOh, moment of supreme and mortal horror; we felt we were going into\r\nthe jaws of hell!”\r\n\r\nThe last ship which left the navy yard, most beloved by the writer,\r\nwas the ill-fated _Polaris_, of Arctic fame. It seems but yesterday\r\nsince the decks were trod by those who will see her no more. “Taste\r\nthat pemmican,” says Captain Hall; “don’t it melt in your mouth like\r\na peach? There is nothing better after you cross the circle unless\r\nit is a tallow candle. That is the place where the Esquimaux will\r\nsleep, small quarters, but everything is packed, even to the ice,\r\nas you go towards the pole. This is my snuggery room for two. That\r\nis for the doctor or a companion in case I don’t like to be left by\r\nmyself. I want you to see the nose of the ship. Seven feet of solid\r\nwood, finished with iron, to munch the ice. See the extras that have\r\nbeen sent us. That parlor organ is just the thing to cheer the men in\r\nwinter quarters.” “Have you no fear, Captain?” “I am going to find\r\nthe open Polar Sea, and Captain Buddington will take care of the\r\nship.” As he said this a grave shadow flitted over his face. There\r\nwas a vacant look in his deep blue eyes, as if the soul had stepped\r\nback from the windows of vision. At this moment all that was mortal\r\nof the ill-fated explorer was photographed on the memory forever.\r\n\r\nThe navy yard covers about 37 acres, and, besides the workshops,\r\ncontains the officers’ quarters. The newspapers announce that the\r\nfashionable festivities of the season are to be inaugurated the first\r\nof next month by a series of Monday morning hops at the navy yard.\r\nCan anything be more bright and attractive? Imagine the smooth-shaven\r\nsward dotted with historic relics of mighty achievements, and\r\nornamented with the same cannon balls that Henry Ward Beecher seduced\r\ninto his boyish hat, the darling “middies” in bright buttons and\r\nsmart blue coats, with all their delightful ocean pranks. Is it a\r\nwonder the girls’ hearts are gone before they are quite sure they\r\nhave any? Besides, a sailor makes love in a different way from an\r\nordinary landlubber. Time is short on shore, and the moments must not\r\nbe spent in dallying. It is a kiss and a blow, and the blow means\r\nmatrimony; and God help the woman who has a sailor husband or lover.\r\nA person was once heard to say, “My parents were married twenty-seven\r\nyears, and my father was a commodore in the Navy; twenty-two of those\r\nyears my mother spent alone on the land, for in those days no woman\r\nwas allowed on a United States war vessel. When I was a little child,\r\nI remember a tall, bearded, rough-looking man, who used to come once\r\nin a great while to our house, and mother would call, ‘Children, come\r\nand see your father!’ The only time I was glad to look at him was\r\nwhen he brought us a parrot.”\r\n\r\nLeaving the navy yard, you stroll to other parts of Capitol Hill, and\r\nsoon become aware why the noble Capitol was planted on the heights,\r\nand why the adjacent grounds towards the east were chosen as the\r\nhomes of the early aristocracy. Here Nature has lavished her most\r\nprecious gifts. Our magnificent Capitol is the public building which\r\ndwarfs all others by comparison. Its superb front faces the homes on\r\nthe hill. Its rear, from polite necessity, must be forever turned\r\ntowards that western end, where speculation runs riot, and fortunes\r\nhave been made in a single night.\r\n\r\nOne never tires writing about the Capitol. It is pronounced the\r\nfinest architectural creation in the world, and the most costly, with\r\nthe exception of a palace in Lisbon. It represents the accumulated\r\ngrandeur of human taste, as it has been handed down in stone through\r\nthe centuries. From the Egyptian Pyramids it borrows its overpowering\r\nmassiveness, chastened and etherealized by the tone of the Greeks.\r\nAfter the Roman Temple of Jupiter Stator it takes its pillared\r\nporticoes, Corinthian in order, but here the resemblance to ancient\r\narchitecture ends. The antique temples were open courts, and the\r\nporticoes were the useful part of the building. Before the letters\r\nof the alphabet were invented philosophers stood on the portico of\r\nthe temple and taught the people. We have covered our open court\r\nwith a roof, and put our instructors and lawmakers inside. What have\r\nthey done? They have abolished the franking privilege, and wrested\r\nfrom the Government their back pay, but they will not send the\r\npublic books to the people, therefore our modern Jupiter Stator is\r\na fraud. One-half a million volumes have to-day accumulated at the\r\nCapitol. The vaults of this stupendous building are packed tier upon\r\ntier until space can nowhere be found. Already the broad aisles are\r\nchoked, and the great highway is becoming impassable. Books! books!\r\nlike the madman’s fiends, are above, around, and everywhere. Twenty\r\nbags full were sent to Congressman Dawes last week, and they are no\r\nmore missed than so many leaves from the forest. In a brief time the\r\nCapitol will be stuffed with its own garbage, like a huge turkey in\r\nChristmas time, and the economical Congressmen will be driven to the\r\nporticoes outside. Then will return the pristine glory of ancient\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nWe have no Anaxagoras or Petrius, but we have General B. F. Butler,\r\na greater Roman than them all. As a last leap up the ladder of fame,\r\nthis distinguished Congressman has decided to become an aristocrat\r\nand an old settler, and to this purpose he has bought a delightful\r\nsite on Capitol Hill, and is building a residence worthy of the\r\nconstructor. This costly creation may be called a stone triplet,\r\nas three houses will be born at the same time. The first faces the\r\neast, but its northern side salutes the Capitol. It is said this\r\nis intended for a grand “club house,” but the gambling will be\r\nexclusively confined to politics. All this is in anticipation of the\r\ngrand hurdle race which will probably come off in 1876. The second\r\nhouse remains a mystery. The last has already been rented to the\r\nCoast Survey for a library. Henceforth Capitol Hill claims General\r\nB. F. Butler. He is our Congressional cloud by day and our political\r\nfire at night. There is a great deal of legislative chaff, and only a\r\nfew grains of wheat. Capitol Hill has drawn her solitary ration and\r\nis satisfied.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGETOWN ARISTOCRACY.\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS, MADAME BODISCO, MRS. SOUTHWORTH, AND GOVERNOR COOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _October 20, 1875_.\r\n\r\nRecently some stones have been unearthed in Georgetown of great value\r\nto the student of antiquated taste. These slabs bear a date so remote\r\nthat most of the letters have been eaten away by the teeth of Time,\r\nbut sufficient remains to identify the Bell family, who occupied\r\nGeorgetown Heights in the early part of the last century. Far back\r\nin the shadowy past the clear ringing tongue of this English Bell\r\nmight have been heard as it poured its melody in the ear of an Indian\r\nprincess, who soon after became his wife. The first nest of the\r\nyoung pair was a tent; afterward a quaint English cottage snuggled\r\non the woody heights. Below them moved the silvery waters of the\r\nsolemn Potomac. To the east stretched their vast possessions, which\r\nembraced all the land within the scope of vision which lay between\r\nthe cottage and the rising sun. Here Madame Bell, attended by her\r\npale-face consort, led the fashions without rivals and with none to\r\ndispute her sway. Over the stormy Atlantic came the winged schooners,\r\nbringing rich brocades for this dusky queen. Her costumes were half\r\nenlightened, half barbaric, like many of the styles of to-day. The\r\ndescendants of these ancient Georgetown aristocrats have been slowly\r\nundergoing the bleaching process, and the past hundred years had\r\nalmost obliterated the last trace of Indian lineage, and yet within\r\nthe memory of the present generation “white trash” have been noticed\r\nin this vicinity bearing the name of Bell, and carrying in their\r\nlithe forms and eagle eyes the last superb touch of the grace of\r\nIndian origin. But, true to the savage instinct, these were the first\r\nmen to seize the deadly musket in the Southern cause, and the late\r\nbattlefields of the South are made richer by the bones of the last of\r\nthe first aristocracy of Georgetown.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bells came the Peters, a haughty Virginia family, whose\r\nslave call was answered by hundreds of inky men. Georgetown Heights\r\nin those early days was called the Tudor estate, in memory of the\r\nroyal line of England. Tudor Place stretched itself between the\r\nHeights and the Washington Navy Yard, but in the course of time this\r\nvast estate was broken up. This was prior to the Revolution. The\r\nPeters family were related to the Washingtons and Lees. Washington\r\nPeters is the most prominent descendant of this aristocratic family,\r\nbut the last fragment of the estate has passed away from him, and he\r\nlives at Ellicott’s Mills, on a farm, a man almost eighty years of\r\nage, the last to retain the haughty bearing of the proud old family,\r\nthe last of his race whose hand has rested on the yoke of a slave.\r\n\r\nThe shifting panorama shows us Protestant Thirkel, who, through the\r\ninfluence of Archbishop Carroll, of Baltimore, gave the extensive\r\ngrounds now occupied by the Georgetown College and Convent to the\r\nRoman Catholic Church some time during the latter part of the last\r\ncentury. Little is known of the social standing of the Thirkels, but\r\nthey were a family of wealth, and their tombstones are institutions\r\nof learning.\r\n\r\nComing down to the last fifty years, we find the aristocracy of\r\nGeorgetown strongly flavored with merchants and tradespeople. The\r\nLinthicum mansion, which is said to be one of the finest, was built\r\nand owned by a hardware merchant, but he, too, has passed away like\r\nall the old residents who gave tone to the elegant society which\r\nruled during the administration of Polk and Buchanan. During the\r\nPresidential reign of these two men the social queen of the capital\r\nlived in Georgetown, the city of her birth and education. She was the\r\ndaughter of an obscure but highly respected merchant, and was married\r\nat the early age of sixteen to the Russian Minister Bodisco, whose\r\ndiplomatic position at once lifted his lovely wife to the highest\r\nround of the social ladder, whilst his vast wealth was used to give\r\nthis wifely jewel the most costly setting. From over the sea came\r\nthe flashing gems that had adorned the savage throats of a hundred\r\ngenerations of Bodisco Russians--diamonds only eclipsed by those\r\nof world-wide fame. In those somewhat primitive days the working\r\npeople used to line the roadway to see Madame Bodisco pass from her\r\nmansion to the White House on occasion of reception or levee. If the\r\nweather permitted, she was visible to all in her open carriage--far\r\nmore beautiful than the famous Eugenie, and with the same inimitable\r\ntact and grace. Creamy white satin and costly old lace was the\r\nfavorite costume, and when adorned with jewels worth more than a\r\nmillion, mounted policemen followed in her train. The poor people\r\nsaid, “Old Bodisco is afraid some one will steal his wife,” but he\r\nwas simply protecting her, Russian fashion. But this American girl\r\nwas something more than a figure to be adorned with stones. With\r\nthat superb tact which only a Josephine knew how to practice, she\r\nunited the contending social elements. She thawed the frozen ocean\r\nof diplomatic ceremony and bade the foreign fortress open its doors\r\nto her countrywomen as well as herself. It is true she had standing\r\nat her right hand the incomparable Harriet Lane, of the White House,\r\nwho held the last royal scepter of this extinct line. History rarely\r\nrecords the fact that distinguished leaders are beautiful, but\r\npopular acclamation gave to both these women the fairest crown. Alike\r\nin style of type, both opaline blondes, perfect in form and feature,\r\nwith Titian-tinted flesh and golden hair, such as the old masters\r\ngave their beloved Madonnas, they held their emblems of power\r\nwith a firmer grasp than did Marie Antoinette, a woman of the same\r\nmould. In the days which marked the magnificence of the Bodisco and\r\nLane regime, beauty and grace were not punished as under the Grant\r\ndynasty. George H. Williams, of Oregon, would have been Chief Justice\r\nof the Republic to-day had his wife been one of the “ugly sisters.”\r\n“They pared their heels and they pared their toes,” but the Prince\r\ndid not dare defy the “Sisters.” Underneath the political drift lies\r\nthe stony social strata which decides the character of the products\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of civil war a society mildew fell upon Georgetown.\r\nNeighbors and old friends looked upon each other with mutual\r\ndistrust. As a general rule most of the fighting element rolled\r\nsouthward. In a few instances a house might be found divided against\r\nitself. Once a Georgetown mother appeared before Abraham Lincoln to\r\nbeg for the life of her son, who had been caught as a guerrilla with\r\narms in his hands. “My eldest son,” said the mother, “is a trusty\r\nofficer in the Union army; my youngest, my darling, was one of\r\nMosby’s guerrillas.” “Miserable mother!” said the great President.\r\n“God help you, for I cannot. I know who you are! This is the third\r\ntime your boy has been caught; mercy is beyond me!” and the man with\r\nstreaming eyes supported the faltering steps of the wretched woman\r\nbeyond the threshold. At this period social life was dead, apparently\r\nbeyond resurrection.\r\n\r\nMrs. Southworth, the noted novelist, and a prominent resident of\r\nGeorgetown, nailed the stars and stripes over the front gate,\r\nsaying, “Whoever comes to my door will have to pass under that.”\r\nWith patriotic zeal she gave her only daughter, Lotta, to be the\r\nwife of a gallant Union captain, and her only son, who was studying\r\nand not strong enough to go into the field, was attached as medicine\r\nboy to one of the hospitals. But these deprivations were not enough\r\nsacrifice. Either in camp or hospital she caught the smallpox. “I\r\ncannot prevent the soldiers from taking the smallpox,” said the great\r\nnovelist, “but I can suffer with them; there is some consolation in\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nAlas, the social wave has receded, apparently never to return.\r\nWeddings, even, were under the ban; but with peace came a violent\r\nreaction which threw the sediments of society to the surface, and\r\nHenry D. Cooke, first governor of the District, came prominently\r\ninto view. It was never intended that he should be anything but a\r\nfigure-head for governor. When he was relieved from the cares of\r\nstate it was but natural that he should turn to a field of action\r\nwhere there would be little or no competition. A leader of the\r\n_ton_! Why not? Old issues were dead; besides, if he traveled in\r\nthis path Shepherd and Babcock would let him alone. Only a few moons\r\nprevious to his being crowned governor his station in life was as\r\nhumble as that of Sancho Panza--a modest clerk at the capital, with\r\nno higher aim than to make his salary cover the family needs. But\r\nat this particular epoch in our critical history Salmon P. Chase,\r\nthen Secretary of the Treasury, thought he spied an open way to the\r\nWhite House. “Money,” said the statesman, “much money will pave\r\nthe track.” So he gave the enchanted keys of the people’s pocket\r\nto his distant kinsman, Jay Cooke, and together they were to cook\r\nthe political pie. It would take the pen of Victor Hugo to describe\r\nthe huge financial bubble which hung so long suspended by a single\r\nhair. It made the little clerk first governor of the District,\r\nunited with the fact that he was “Shepherd’s man.” “He won’t give us\r\ntrouble,” said Alexander, and Grant broke a solemn pledge which he\r\nmade to the people of the District to give him a crown. Politically\r\nGovernor Cooke had no more weight than an Alaska Indian, but socially\r\nthe resident governor gave Georgetown a new lease of life. But the\r\nfew dying snails of the old aristocracy drew coldly within their\r\nshells like the monarchists under the Bonaparte reign. “Who is this\r\n_parvenu_ and his upstart wife? Who are the Cookes?” said the proud\r\nold spirit. The question was soon answered. In one of the grandest\r\nof the proud old mansions might have been found the new governor,\r\nsurrounded by all that was costly and luxurious in nature or art.\r\nThe atmosphere of the large drawing-rooms was heavily laden with the\r\nfragrance of choice exotics, and foreign birds sang in the cages\r\nwhich hung in the emerald bloom. The richest Axminster covered the\r\nfloors; silk, satin and embroidery ornamented rosewood and ebony;\r\npictures and statuary were all as profuse as they were costly or\r\nextravagant. If refined taste did not prevail the defect was covered\r\nby Oriental splendor. Two thousand dollars per month was put into\r\nthe hands of the steward to furnish this small private family with\r\nordinary marketing, and this did not include the wines and staple\r\ngroceries. Every day the courses were laid as if for a dinner party,\r\nwith preparations for any number of the ordinary unexpected guests.\r\nFleet horses stood in the stable, with coachman and footman awaiting\r\ncall. A son of the illustrious house was married and a railroad car\r\nis chartered to bring the distant guests, and this, added to the\r\nexpense of the wedding breakfast, costs the aristocratic governor the\r\nsum of $10,000, a large fortune for any young man of 21. An official\r\nreception is given in mid-winter, and $1,500 is paid for the single\r\nitem of roses alone. Is not this truthful history as wonderful as\r\nany tale found between the covers of the Arabian Nights? From the\r\nnarrow walls of a cheap tenement and sixteen hundred a year to all\r\nthe gilded trappings of royalty! Yet only one-eighth of the profits\r\nof Jay Cooke’s concern was received by the governor as his share of\r\nthe public plunder. The old, old story--the few robbing the many. The\r\n“court” traveling with its paint pots and the working men left to\r\nstarve. Henry D. Cooke can no longer be called the “social leader.”\r\nHis title has been taken away, and he has given up the mansion, but\r\nhe has saved enough from the wrecked concern to establish his son\r\nand name-sake in the banking business. The son of the President is\r\na member of the firm, whilst Mr. Sartoris has just stepped over to\r\nEngland to raise the wherewith to join this “national” enterprise.\r\nMrs. Cooke is also independent for life. The passerby of Fifteenth\r\nstreet, opposite the Treasury, can almost any day see a portly, jolly\r\nman lounging like a genteel loafer. That is Henry D. Cooke, late\r\nclerk, governor, banker, and leader of the fashion of Georgetown.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATORS EDMUNDS AND CARPENTER.\r\n\r\nSOME INSIGHT INTO LIFE SENATORIAL--SAFEGUARDS OF THAT AUGUST BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 7, 1876_.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Hon. Abram S. Hewitt, accompanied by other New York\r\ncitizens, will appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee\r\nto urge the adoption of the bill to incorporate the United States\r\nInternational Commission, and provide for the same being held in\r\nthe city of New York in 1883. The bill had already been introduced\r\nin the Senate by Senator Kernan, and championed by Senator Wallace,\r\nof Pennsylvania, who always looks after legislation which will\r\nbenefit the Pennsylvania Central Railroad. Senator Carpenter argued\r\nthat it was in violation of the Constitution for Congress to aid a\r\ncorporation in any such way; that it was a precedent which would\r\nentail any amount of trouble in the future. Other great cities would\r\ncome up with their projects, asking Congress to assume responsibility\r\nand bestow financial aid. Senator Wallace argued that it had already\r\nbeen done for the city of Philadelphia; which was answered by Senator\r\nCarpenter in his own inimitable way. Leaving his seat, a step brought\r\nhim into the broad aisle, where he stood directly in front of the\r\nVice-President, and raising his voice to a key which penetrated all\r\nsurrounding space within the Senate walls, he replied, “Stealing has\r\nprecedent after precedent; but shall we argue for this reason it is\r\nright to steal?” After a brief but ringing appeal in behalf of the\r\nassaulted Constitution, this superb and polished orator left the\r\nfloor. In many ways Senator Carpenter is one of the most able men\r\nin Congress, with the mark of genius more pronounced, or rather,\r\nmore noticeable in his case, than in any other man in the Senate.\r\nOne of the surest evidences of genius (for genius is God-given,\r\nwhilst talent can be acquired) is the carrying through the years to\r\nthe last all the qualities of each period of existence--the blind\r\nenthusiasm, the winning folly of the child united to the grand\r\npowers of maturity. In genius the character never crystallizes.\r\nIt is changeable, yet strangely invariable, and in many more ways\r\nresembles the indestructible elements. Senator Carpenter has a way\r\nof tying his collar, crushing down his hat, and bounding into the\r\nSenate with the same kind of abandon which resembles the action of\r\na boy, while his laugh has all the music of youthful glee. His life\r\nhas been a prolonged enjoyment of the admiration of women, because in\r\nhim all ages, from romping girl to icy age, find something to adore.\r\nA handsome man when in perfect health is Senator Carpenter, but at\r\npresent he is a good deal of a shadow as compared to his former self.\r\nUpon the principle that a high-pressure engine sooner wears itself\r\nout, so these men made on the Carpenter plan rarely live to old age.\r\nIt is the fret and wear of the invisible organization that finally\r\nwrecks the physical, and there is no earthly picture so painful as\r\nthese men who have reached the snow line, when the sun of life,\r\naccording to the years, should be in full meridian of glory. Turning\r\nto the Congressional Directory, it is recorded that Senator Carpenter\r\nhas reached the age of 56, not so young after all. Is it the boyish\r\nmask that has deceived; or have Blaine and Edmunds been afflicted\r\nwith the weakness which is always pardonable in woman, and recorded\r\nthe wrong figures? Can it be possible that he is a half a dozen\r\nyears in advance of Blaine, and nearly the same in regard to Senator\r\nEdmunds?\r\n\r\nBut here are two Senators whose lives are passed on the same\r\nhigh-pressure plan, for such is the penalty which exalted ambition\r\nmust pay. Not a solitary measure passes the Senate that is not licked\r\ninto shape by the insinuating tongue and all-prevailing mind of\r\nvigilant Senator Edmunds. Others may toil like the marble-cutters\r\non a statue, but when the breath of life is to be blown into the\r\nnostrils, the great artist must be on hand to pinch a soul into the\r\ninexorable stone. The casual observer would not pronounce Senator\r\nEdmunds handsome according to the Greek or modern standard, but he\r\nhas the exact appearance which one, in imagination, would picture a\r\nRoman Senator before the empire was in its decline. We can realize\r\nin this Senator the highest ingredient of New England civilization.\r\nHis solemn visage seems a reflection of that sombre landscape, the\r\nsavage grandeur of the sea, the majestic mountains tipped with snow.\r\nHis sleepless efforts to keep the Senate records clean embody the\r\nPuritan’s idea of justice, that rarest product of the seed planted by\r\nthe _Mayflower_. It is that awful something which nerves the hand of\r\nthe fisherman on that stormy coast united to the most intellectual\r\nculture condensed into a single blade, and it is keen enough to cut a\r\nship’s cable or a single hair. When Belva Lockwood, the woman lawyer,\r\nwas trying to reach the bar of the Supreme Court through the Senate,\r\nher fear centered on Senator Edmunds. She said, “I know I shall\r\n‘pass’ if I can win his support.” So she sent a messenger to plead\r\nher cause. “My vote,” said Senator Edmunds, “will not be recorded\r\nagainst Mrs. Lockwood because she is a woman. I think her a very poor\r\nlawyer! If I had my own way, only those thoroughly trained in the law\r\nshould be admitted to practice in the Supreme Court.”\r\n\r\nSenator Edmunds has a social record at the capital without a flaw,\r\nwhich proves that men can live pure, clean lives like women; or else\r\ndo the next best thing--conduct themselves in such a pious manner\r\nthat they are never found out. But in taking the moral estimate\r\nof a man his avoirdupois weight should be carefully taken, and he\r\nshould be judged in a great measure by the way it is divided. These\r\nbloodless New Englanders and fiery Southerners in Washington should\r\nbe tried by judges capable of tempering justice with mercy upon the\r\nprinciple that tears are in the eyes of the court when he sentences\r\na starving man for stealing a loaf of bread. Senator Edmunds treats\r\nwomen in the most refined and courteous way, just enough frigid to\r\nbe dignified; but if he chooses to descend to a limited quantity of\r\nsmall talk, everything he says is valuable enough to be printed in\r\nthe newspapers. This man has been made selfish and otherwise spoiled\r\nby the “buzzing of the Presidential bee.” If he should ever reach the\r\nWhite House, of which there is not the slightest danger, no one would\r\nbe half so astonished as himself. He has reached the highest point of\r\nhis ambition--to be the leader of his party in the Senate, to fill to\r\nthe fullest measure the idea of an American Senator; and whilst like\r\nthe late Charles Sumner, he can grasp the great legislative matters\r\nof state, unlike him he can take up the little things. Not a sparrow\r\ncould fall on the Senate floor without his notice.\r\n\r\nBut the saddest sight is apparent when a brilliant member is torn\r\nup by the roots in the House, and is immediately transported to the\r\nSenate. It is like removing a plant from the heat and moisture of a\r\nconservatory to an atmosphere found almost anywhere in the temperate\r\nzone. Senators Dawes, Lamar and Blaine are striking examples of this\r\nkind of transubstantiation. Who can ever forget the brilliant career\r\nof Senator Dawes when he occupied the proud position of “leader of\r\nthe House”? In this branch of Congress, argument, wit and repartee\r\nhave a specific value, and enable the possessor to mount the ladder\r\nof fame; but in the Senate oratory is at a discount, whilst wit or\r\nargument may be compared to a clown at a funeral. Speeches are looked\r\nupon as talk to distant constituents, to which the Senators must\r\nlisten in order to make them “official.” The Senate chamber during\r\na “speech” is a subject worthy of study. An air of resignation is\r\nborn into this cold, selfish world, destined to last until the\r\ntorture is over. Usually most of the Senators make their escape\r\ntemporarily. Burnside and Anthony generally retire to the committee\r\nroom of “Revolutionary Claims,” a snug nest right under the eaves,\r\nwhere the sparrows build their homes. This dainty spot is presided\r\nover by Major Ben: Perley Poore, clerk of the committee, and one of\r\nthe daintiest morsels to be found at the Capitol done up in manly\r\nform. There is a cupboard in the Revolutionary room, which is the\r\nexact opposite to “old Mother Hubbard’s.” Lest the reader forget, the\r\npoetry is quoted in full:\r\n\r\n      “Old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cupboard,\r\n        To get her poor dog a bone;\r\n      And when she got there, the cupboard was bare,\r\n        And so the poor dog got none.”\r\n\r\nIn this far-away, almost forgotten nook, where the musty archives\r\nof the old Revolutionary war lie mouldering, this solemn sepulcher\r\nis made alive by the spicy odors of fast-evaporating fluids, or the\r\ndelicate aroma of pineapple cheese. Sometimes, during the lunch\r\nhours, crabs and oysters go there without any volition of their own.\r\nAbout the same time the courtly old Thurman becomes so revolutionary\r\nthat he wends his way to the radical snuggery under the roof. He will\r\nprobably be joined on the way by Don Cameron, the young Scottish\r\nchief, but this combination may be a union like the late Electoral\r\nCommission, to produce a lasting peace. But it is astonishing to\r\nfind how sweet and delicious these old Senators become when they\r\nare almost ripe enough to fall from the legislative tree. To go to\r\nthe committee room of Revolutionary Claims is one way to kill the\r\ntime during a “speech.” Sometimes the Senators adjourn to the cloak\r\nrooms, throw themselves on the luxurious sofas, and steep their\r\ncrippled senses in well-colored meerschaums or a choice cigar.\r\nOthers, more nervous, repair to the marble baths, the like of which\r\nhave never been seen since Rome had her fall. So far as the writer\r\ncan ascertain, a Senatorial bath has never been witnessed by the\r\nreportorial eye. It is the only sublime spectacle which has eluded\r\nthe correspondents. The old Roman Senators employed the most skilful\r\nartists to portray them associated with the baths, and this will\r\nprobably follow in due time in the great Western empire. If a Senator\r\nremains in the chamber during a speech, he is deeply absorbed in\r\nreading or writing.\r\n\r\nHow can a man make himself felt in the Senate? His voice only reaches\r\nhis constituents or those who have a personal interest in the measure\r\nor man. His fine oratorical efforts fall as those of Demosthenes on\r\nthe turbulent sea. He must stand, like Senator Edmunds, for years\r\nat the mouth of the pit, and watch that nothing goes in dangerous\r\nto the liberties of a free people. He must watch the aggressive\r\nencroachments of an infamous lobby. The great railroad and other\r\ngigantic corporations have their paid agents here to buy up all the\r\nsmall-fry Congressmen, as well as to notify the monopolists all over\r\nthe country of any adverse legislation in advance. A paid Indian\r\nlobby is always here to keep the Indian affairs from being turned\r\nover to the War Department. The War Department never employs a lobby.\r\nAn army officer has never been known to ask for the Indian business,\r\nexcept in the general protest that the soldiers should not be sent\r\nout to be scalped and mutilated for the crimes committed by the\r\nIndian agents. When a Senator is found to be faithful to the trust\r\nconfided to his keeping, we should guard him as the apple of our eye.\r\nWe should protect his good name from the assaults of the malicious,\r\nfor when a Senator is found immovable the lobby attempts his\r\ndestruction. It will be remembered that it was the lobby thugs that\r\ntried to strangle Senator Blaine on the eve of the last Presidential\r\nnomination. The storm is gathering again, but how can a man defend\r\nhimself against his invisible foes? It is not because Blaine is hated\r\nso much; it is because other men are preferred so much the more.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE OF MRS. GRANT.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE LADY OF THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _December 13, 1879_.\r\n\r\nWading through a mass of newspaper correspondence concerning life at\r\nthe White House during the administration of General Grant, it is\r\ninvariably found that language most vivid and eloquent is used alike\r\nby friend and foe. The admirers find everything to order for highest\r\npraise, whilst the enemy finds nothing too dark and threatening with\r\nwhich to paint the pen pictures. By figures taken from authentic\r\nsources, it is shown that the expenses incurred for supporting the\r\nWhite House, irrespective of the President’s salary, was increased\r\n$27,550 per year on the average under General Grant in excess of\r\nthe amount consumed under Abraham Lincoln. This vast yearly sum\r\nwas not used for decorative purposes, unless the military staff\r\nwith its brass buttons may be considered that way. General Badeau\r\nwas the historian whose duty it was to save the sands of history,\r\nact as chief custodian of the Presidential literary preserves,\r\nand at the same time keep all poachers away. Military rule was as\r\nrigidly enforced as in the tented field. It not only surrounded the\r\nPresident, but wrapped the whole household in its starry fold.\r\n\r\nIt seems but yesterday since the writer stormed this peculiar citadel\r\nto gain an audience with “the first lady of the land.” After passing\r\nthe skirmish line of messengers and doorkeepers, the first real lion\r\nencountered was General Dent. This gentleman has often been described\r\nas made of “fuss and feathers,” a “military martinet,” but the writer\r\nfound only a genial, pleasant gentleman. Most of his military life\r\nhad been spent on the frontier, and what seemed “fuss” was only\r\nthe embarrassment which came from being transplanted from almost\r\nobscurity to one of the most trying subordinate positions at the\r\nWhite House. He was not only high chamberlain, head usher, but also\r\nbrother-in-law to the President, and this last position made him the\r\ntarget for more witty newspaper paragraphs than any other member of\r\nthe Presidential household.\r\n\r\n“Want to see Mrs. Grant, do you? What for, just to pay your respects?”\r\n\r\n“Not altogether for that, though the respects will be included.”\r\n\r\n“Newspaper woman! eh?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think Mrs. Grant wants to be written up in the newspapers.\r\nShe ain’t that kind of a woman.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, General! I shall take no advantages of Mrs.\r\nGrant’s courtesy or kindness, but the people will wish to know\r\nsomething of the ‘lady of the White House,’ and how can I make up one\r\nof the ‘pictures’ unless I am permitted to dip my pen at the fountain\r\nhead?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you see her at her receptions? I think she sees ladies\r\nSaturday afternoons.”\r\n\r\n“I never describe dress. I want to tell the people something about\r\nthe woman inside the clothes.”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to turn you over to General Badeau!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a bell was touched and a lackey, minus the military\r\nbuttons, appeared.\r\n\r\n“Show this lady to General Badeau’s room.”\r\n\r\nOver the tufted carpet, through vestibule and broad hall, until the\r\nright door was reached. A smart knock, which was answered by “Come\r\nin!”\r\n\r\nThe man with the military buttons looked up from the mass of papers\r\nat which he appeared to be at work, and the servant at my side simply\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I am requested by General Dent to show this lady to your room.”\r\nThe servant immediately disappeared through the open door. General\r\nBadeau glanced at the writer from head to foot, his eyes instantly\r\nreverted to the papers, and his mouth, which had never opened,\r\nseemed fastened like those of the sphinx. The situation to the\r\nwriter became extremely painful, not knowing whether to retreat or\r\nadvance; but in an instant it was decided to stand firm without\r\nflinching a muscle, and await the enemy’s fire. At this moment\r\nGeneral Badeau’s assistant kindly inquired if the lady would “have\r\na seat?” The seat was occupied and the foreign sphinx kept at work\r\non his papers. In the meantime the photograph of this foreigner was\r\nburned into the writer’s brain. Short and thick set, with the animal\r\nneck of a gladiator squatted upon his square shoulders, every visible\r\npoint about the man indicating his peasant origin, the grim, gray\r\ncomplexion, the small, dead, steel-blue eye and neutral color of\r\nhair, a nose which had just escaped a hook, and a mouth which nature\r\ndenied lips, but left it an ugly slit in the face, like a wound which\r\ncould not be made to heal.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment became almost unendurable, the silence horrible,\r\nbut the writer sat with folded hands “determined to fight it out\r\non that line if it took all summer.” As a cannon swings on the\r\ngun-carriage, the bore of this military arrangement was brought to\r\nbear upon the countenance of the writer.\r\n\r\n“Did you wish to speak to me?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I came to the White House to see Mrs. Grant. General Dent\r\nhas consigned me to your care. What are you going to do with me?”\r\n\r\n“You wish to see Mrs. Grant? That is not so easy a matter. Would you\r\nallow me to know the nature of your business? We do not allow Mrs.\r\nGrant to be subjected to annoyance.”\r\n\r\n“I have not the slightest intention to annoy Mrs. Grant. I have no\r\nfavors to ask, or axes to grind. I should never have ventured over\r\nthe threshold of the White House had I understood military law. I\r\nwas accustomed to meet Andy Johnson as though he were still an\r\nunpretending citizen of the Republic; and Mrs. Patterson allows the\r\nintimacy of a personal friend.”\r\n\r\n“What shall I call your name?”\r\n\r\nA card was handed the General and he read aloud “Mrs. Emily Briggs.”\r\n\r\n“Allow me to say a word,” said General Badeau’s assistant. “If I\r\nam not mistaken, I think this is ‘Olivia,’ correspondent of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_ and other prominent newspapers.”\r\n\r\nThe writer bowed in simple recognition. The General raised his\r\neyebrows with another supercilious glance at the writer’s person, and\r\nwithout the slightest notice of the interruption simply answered, “In\r\nthat case I shall have to turn you over to General Porter.”\r\n\r\nSome more footfalls over the tufted floors and the office of General\r\nPorter was reached, but the change was like that of the living\r\nskeleton into the fat woman and mud into polished marble; of charcoal\r\ninto diamonds.\r\n\r\nGeneral Porter was standing in the council chamber which leads to\r\nthe room where the immortal eye sees the invisible throne. It is the\r\nexecutive headquarters; where may be found during business hours the\r\nAmerican citizen who sways the sceptre over all that is superbly\r\nimportant on the Western Continent. General Porter stood, the central\r\nfigure of a group of young officers, all handsome enough for a\r\ntableau scene in a church charitable performance, with a grace of\r\nmanner which seemed meant purposely to obliterate the remembrance of\r\nthe ferocity of former experience. General Porter inquired how could\r\nhe serve the lady “who had honored him with a call?” The business\r\nmade known, “Certainly,” said General Porter, “I feel at liberty to\r\nsay that Mrs. Grant will be pleased to see you. Possibly she may not\r\nbe engaged at present.” A messenger was despatched and soon returned\r\nwith an answer. “I must show you the way myself,” said General\r\nPorter, “and if you have not met Mrs. Grant I must introduce you\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nAnd this “open sesame” was never changed during the eight years that\r\nGeneral Grant occupied the White House. Owing to some difficulty with\r\nher eyes, Mrs. Grant was obliged to have a private secretary attend\r\nto her letters and assist her in any work which would be impaired\r\nby defective vision, and having married into the army a soldier\r\nsecretary was preferred to one of her own sex, who might in the\r\nbeginning prove to be a perfectly seaworthy vessel, but after all,\r\nwithout any warning, spring a leak.\r\n\r\nDuring these days a gentleman in New York made up his mind that\r\nhe would publish a book with the high-sounding title, “The Ladies\r\nof the White House from Washington to Grant.” The writer was sent\r\na communication, asking for a paper on these subjects to contain\r\npersonal reminiscences, etc. Under this stimulant the author of the\r\nforthcoming papers called upon General Dent to make inquiry about the\r\nearly life of his sister. On his recollections the incidents were\r\nput together, but before they were mailed Mrs. Grant’s presence was\r\nsought, the manuscript spread out for reading and correction. Mrs.\r\nGrant listened with a most amused expression on her face. At the\r\nconclusion she remarked, “Did brother Fred tell you all that?”\r\n\r\n“He did, Mrs. Grant?”\r\n\r\n“Then brother Fred does not know me! Let me tell you about Fred.\r\nYou know I am a Southern woman, was born and brought up on a\r\nplantation. Our brothers were much older than we three sisters, and\r\nas soon as they were old enough father sent them away to school. We\r\nhad a governess at home. Our mother directed our education, took\r\na deep interest in everything we learned, just as I believe every\r\nmother should who has daughters. When the boys used to come home\r\nat vacations we used to hide our dolls and playthings, for the\r\nboys would break them up. Brother Fred finished his education at a\r\nmilitary school, and was sent away to the frontier on duty, and has\r\nhad such a hard life that I prevailed on Mr. Grant to let him come\r\nand be near father and the rest of us for a little time. Father will\r\nnot be with us but a few days longer. Now, don’t send that manuscript\r\naway, because it is not my true life. This brother knew nothing about\r\nme the years when he was away.”\r\n\r\nThe book was never published, possibly because some of the papers\r\nnever reached New York.\r\n\r\nAfter Eugenie was deposed from the throne of fashion as well as that\r\nof the empire of France, _The Press_ requested that the writer should\r\nascertain where the ladies of the capital would look for future\r\nmodels. The subject was one of interest, because Madame Demorest was\r\ntrying to set up the golden calf in the great emporium of New York.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Mrs. Grant, “that the American ladies are capable of\r\ninventing their own fashions. How this is to be brought about I don’t\r\nexactly know, but I am quite sure I shall never set the fashions. Mr.\r\nGrant is a poor man. Ask the ladies of the Cabinet. Mrs. Fish has\r\nremarkable good sense.”\r\n\r\nAnother time the writer had heard Mrs. Grant lament her inability\r\nto use the eight sewing machines which had been sent from different\r\nsources to the White House; what to do with all the patchwork quilts\r\nwrought by humble hands.\r\n\r\n“I do not feel it is right to give them away, but where can they be\r\nstored? Only last week Mr. Grant had a leather picture sent all the\r\nway from Oregon. Senator Williams presented it in person. There is no\r\nplace for it on the walls. I am sure I never saw a leather picture\r\nbefore. To keep it from being harmed I have had to put it under the\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\nA very warm friendship existed between Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Wilson,\r\nthe wife of the Senator of that name from Massachusetts. Mrs. Wilson\r\nwas one of the noblest and most angelic of characters. A soldier who\r\nhad been one of the staff officers of General Banks had excited her\r\ndeepest sympathy. He had been dangerously wounded in five different\r\nbattles and his case was on record in the surgeon-general’s office\r\nas a marvel that under the circumstances the man could exist. Mrs.\r\nWilson took his case in hand for advancement in some direction and\r\nreported the case to Mrs. Grant.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing I would not do to help the soldier,” said the\r\nPresident’s wife, “if it lay within my power, if my word or my\r\nefforts would effect it, but I made a resolution that no circumstance\r\nshould arise which would induce me to ask Mr. Grant for an office.\r\nIsn’t Mr. Wilson one of the pillars of the Senate? Mr. Grant is\r\nworried all day. There must be one place where he can have quiet.”\r\n\r\nThis last incident the writer relates as written down from the lips\r\nof the late Mrs. Wilson. Mrs. Wilson said at the time: “Mrs. Grant is\r\nright, and I mean to let Henry alone after this.”\r\n\r\nWhen the only daughter (Miss Nellie) attended school like other young\r\ngirls of a dozen years of age, the afternoon came and her lesson was\r\nunlearned. The carriage came to the door for the incipient young\r\nlady, but the teacher dismissed it with the request that it should\r\nreturn at the end of a half hour. The half hour came and glided\r\naway with the lesson still unlearned. The carriage came again and\r\nwas dismissed. At the end of the second half hour the lesson was\r\ncommitted, and Miss Nellie was permitted to go. The next day at the\r\nusual hour the young lady arrived, accompanied by her mother. The\r\nteacher began to fear she had lost her most cherished pupil, but Mrs.\r\nGrant came to thank her for performing her duty.\r\n\r\n“Teach her,” said Mrs. Grant, “that she is only plain, simple Nellie\r\nGrant, subject to the same rules which govern all the scholars. This\r\ncourse will have my sincere approbation.”\r\n\r\nThrough the wife of Rev. J. P. Newman, the pastor of the church which\r\nthe General and Mrs. Grant loved so well, the writer learned of the\r\nunostentatious charity, the benevolent deeds which this pure-minded\r\nwoman has kept from the world. Mrs. Newman said: “This material\r\nshould be used after Mrs. Grant has gone, when loving friends can\r\nspeak of these truths without wounding her delicacy.” But how can a\r\npaper be made up for publication of Mrs. Grant’s life in the White\r\nHouse and leave out the key to one of the most perfect and lovely of\r\nwomanly characters. From the historic days of Martha Washington no\r\nwoman called to this highest social position has wielded the sceptre\r\nwith more dignity, good sense and grace. Amidst the clashings of\r\nthe female cabinet, which in every sense of the word has as much\r\nsignificance as its counterpart, as the result is often the loss\r\nof an official head, Mrs. Grant was as serene as Victoria on her\r\nthrone--not sustained by birth and traditionary precedent, but upheld\r\nby the noble qualities which makes the American woman in her highest\r\nperfection the peer and often the superior of every reigning queen on\r\nthe earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT REAPER.\r\n\r\nGATHERS A NUMBER OF THE BEAUX AND BELLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _December 31, 1876_.\r\n\r\nWithin the space of three brief years society at the capital has\r\nentirely changed in tone and character. The great drawing-rooms that\r\nwere thrown open to receive guests from all parts of the civilized\r\nworld are now closed forever, whilst a new set of people are pressing\r\nforward to blaze in the social sky as stars of the first magnitude.\r\nGlancing at the banquet halls, deserted, one sees with astonishment\r\nthe path cut by the reaper Death. It requires no stretch of the\r\nimagination to call to mind the grand old home of the “West End”\r\nso long occupied by Admiral and Mrs. Powell (the latter lately\r\ndeceased), where all that was most cultivated and refined in what\r\nis known as “Washington society” gathered to do honor to this late\r\nAmerican queen. Mrs. Powell was the peer of Dolly Madison, the bosom\r\nfriend of Mrs. Polk and Mrs. Tyler, and her remarkable vivacity and\r\npiquant wit lost none of its charm in advancing years. This made her\r\nold age just as attractive to youth as to people in the full bloom of\r\nlife. So it may be truthfully said that this society belle never saw\r\nher scepter waning. It is true that only the ladies connected with\r\nthe Army and Navy have the opportunity to officially perpetuate their\r\nreign. Our Republican court is so constructed that no matter how much\r\na woman’s success may prove to be, like her husband, she must “step\r\ndown and out,” sacrificed on the guillotine of “rotation in office.”\r\n\r\nThe closing of the Steele mansion, which became for a great many\r\nyears the “headquarters” of elegant hospitality, was caused by the\r\ndeath of both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin Steele within ten days of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wise, the daughter of Edward Everett, made her home most\r\nattractive to the elite of the capital, for, in addition to\r\ninheriting to a large degree much of the talent enjoyed by her gifted\r\nfather, a long residence abroad had given her the advantage of every\r\nsocial acquirement. But she, too, has joined the “innumerable throng.”\r\n\r\nCapt. Carlisle Patterson, late head of the Coast Survey, was a\r\ngentleman whose hospitality was boundless, so much so that his\r\nfortune at his death was found to have melted away. But whilst he\r\nlived what a grand good time he had.\r\n\r\nThe Myer mansion, for so many years occupied by the English legation,\r\nbut purchased by the late head of the Signal Bureau, was closed by\r\nthe last summons of its master. During his life this fairy dwelling,\r\nwith its works of art, was thrown open and enjoyed by those who feel\r\nthey “ne’er shall look upon its like again.” No doubt finer houses\r\nwill be built, and the Bonanza kings will import the ancient ruins of\r\nGreece and Rome, but every year our receptions are growing colder,\r\nand our “drawing rooms” resemble those held in the monarchical\r\npalaces of the Old World.\r\n\r\nComing back to the closed habitations, the homes of Justices Hunt and\r\nSwayne pass before the mind’s eye--the first closed by affliction,\r\nthe latter by death. And long will linger in the minds of our\r\nold residents the unostentatious hospitality of the late George\r\nW. Riggs, banker, and whose “business house” was felt to be the\r\nsafest in Washington, though avaricious. Mr. Riggs was known to be\r\nclean-handed, and he inspired the public to believe that his bank was\r\nas solid as the foundation of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd who will forget the kingly hospitality of our late Mayor Wallach,\r\nso superbly assisted by his accomplished wife? The death of the\r\nex-mayor, followed so soon by the death of Mrs. Wallach’s father,\r\ncloses this mansion indefinitely.\r\n\r\nComing to the houses occupied by what is termed in Washington\r\n“official society,” deserted within the time specified, memory\r\nrecalls the costly dwelling occupied and owned by the late Senator\r\nChandler. “Old Zach,” as he was familiarly called, had no taste for\r\nsociety proper, but he had great respect for his wife’s feelings,\r\nand when she gave the order that he should stand in the proper place\r\nwith his huge hands encased in white kid gloves and welcome the\r\ncoming guest it was done with the same vim and audacity with which\r\nhe would conduct a campaign. One grasp of his solid palm would put\r\nthe visitor at ease, if the ardor could be made to last through the\r\ncooling process of passing the gauntlet of the handsome hostess. Mrs.\r\nChandler conducted society matters on the Victoria plan, everything\r\nperfect, superb and grand, but the thermometers always indicated the\r\nfreezing point, unless “dear old Zach” was around to warm matters up\r\nand infuse a little life and spirit.\r\n\r\nSenator Carpenter, with all his faults--the mould was broken when he\r\nwent away--on the floor of the Senate could be a statesman, but in\r\nsociety he had all the rollicking abandon of a school boy. Who can\r\nforget the charming Carpenter home, the little spinning-wheel in the\r\nparlor, at which sat the sole daughter of the house, with the flax\r\nslipping through her slender fingers? Ah, pretty tableaux! Gone,\r\nnever to return!\r\n\r\nNailed to the stony turret of the celebrated Shepherd mansion floats\r\nthe yellow flag of the Orient. Within its rocky battlements may be\r\nfound that which represents in the highest sense Imperial China.\r\nThe solid walls around this legation must remind the occupants of\r\nthe famous one of their native country. It is very painful to those\r\nwho have basked in the prodigality of the Shepherd hospitality to\r\nfind them gone, and the magnificence usurped by Eastern pagans--one\r\nhundred thousand dollars’ worth of furniture, carpets and “silken\r\nhangings.” It would take the space of a column to describe this\r\nmodern dwelling from cellar to turret, and leave out the terrapin,\r\nwhite grasses and champagne. “Boss Shepherd,” rather Alexander\r\nthe Second, just now is in eclipse. We can afford to wait until\r\n“Batipolas” has been well stirred up, then the Shepherd will return\r\nto his flock, who, it is said, were once well sheared. But in the\r\nmeantime our wool will grow, and if we must have a king give us one\r\nof the Shepherd kind.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the most elegant and superbly furnished Washington homes\r\nthe “Bryans” departed, to form new associations in far-off Colorado.\r\nAt the Bryan fireside used to gather the most distinguished people\r\nknown in science, literature and art. The only daughter of the\r\nhouse is one of Healy’s most promising pupils, and it is safe to\r\nsay that Miss Bryan is the finest portrait painter of either sex of\r\nher own age in this country. This compliment is not paid her by the\r\nwriter, who is unable to judge upon so important a point, but it is\r\nthe decision of men who have studied art, both at home and abroad.\r\nThe only son, a very young man, is already a successful lawyer,\r\nand serving his adopted State in her legislature. These instances\r\nare given to show that children reared at the capital amidst the\r\nsurroundings of the most luxurious wealth need not necessarily be\r\nspoiled.\r\n\r\nThe closing of the “Kilbourne mansion” and the departure of the wife\r\nand two beautiful daughters to foreign lands, which happened in the\r\ninterim, like the flitting of the Bryans, created a loss which has by\r\nno means been repaired. “The Kilbournes” have returned, but not to\r\nthe classic home which grew stone by stone under the supervising eye\r\nof its late artistic mistress. Beneath its hospitable roof, evening\r\nafter evening, were gathered the elite of the foreign legations,\r\nwith members of the Army and Navy and others most distinguished in\r\nthe world of literature and art. A landscape painter of no mean\r\nability, and a writer such as would secure her a position on any of\r\nour leading newspapers, Mrs. Kilbourne made her elegant home the most\r\nattractive to journalists beyond any other at the national capital.\r\n\r\nWhilst death has been so busy with our own people, the diplomatic\r\ncircle has not been spared. Count Lita, the “society man” of the\r\nFrench legation, has passed away, and his place remains vacant. Count\r\nLita owed his position to the relations which his sister-in-law\r\nsustains to the present King of Italy, the husband of the beautiful\r\nQueen Margharita. Instead of keeping quiet upon such a delicate\r\npoint, it was a matter of great pride with the late count. It seems\r\nthe sister-in-law looks after what might otherwise be an obscure\r\nand impoverished family. Whenever the newspaper correspondents have\r\ntouched upon the theme “foreign legations,” we are reprimanded by the\r\nofficials of the State Department and given to understand that these\r\npeople are not a part of our body politic, but is that a reason why\r\nthey should be permitted to be social slivers in our flesh? The late\r\nRussian minister, who got into debt at Newport, and then yelled for\r\nthe Russian flag to protect him from his milk woman and the butter\r\nman, came to Washington and Mrs. Russian Minister asked why she was\r\nso neglected socially by American women. She was told that American\r\nladies would not call upon the “lady of the White House” if it was\r\npublic belief that she was living with the President without the\r\nmarriage ceremony being performed. Mrs. Minister straightened up,\r\nsaying, “I am illegitimate, my husband is illegitimate, our children\r\nare illegitimate. Now, what are you Americans going to do about it?\r\nIs it any of your business?” She was informed that American women\r\nwould not accept the situation socially if the Czar should issue a\r\nukase, so she gathered up her “illegitimates” and has disappeared,\r\nwhilst the imperial dominion of the Czar at Washington is unbroken by\r\nwoman’s voice, except the little pipers of the small attachés.\r\n\r\nThe late home of the Freyres, the Peruvian minister, was noted for\r\nits superb hospitality. The family was composed of Señor and Señorita\r\nFreyre and the four daughters; but it took eight cooks to provide\r\nfor their wonderful table. Whilst six would be hard at work in the\r\nkitchen the other two would be scouring the markets of the capital to\r\nsecure terrapin, reed-birds, canvasback and all other dainties for\r\nwhich this famous locality is noted. As a natural consequence, they\r\ngrew so enormous in size that only two could occupy a carriage at a\r\ntime, so it took three carriages, or a funeral procession, to land\r\nthe family in church, and they were all such devoted Catholics that\r\nno religious rites were omitted. The very baby of the family weighed\r\nover three hundred pounds. But it happened, as it always will, that\r\ntoo many reed-birds brought this family to grief. Sickness seized the\r\nfather and eldest daughter and both died within a very short time\r\nof each other. Whilst the father lay on his death-bed, he sent for\r\nan American lawyer who had once been a Cabinet minister of General\r\nGrant, to help him make his will. After devising ample fortunes to\r\nhis wife and the four daughters, he began: “Five thousand Spanish\r\ndollars to my son Don Manuel;” five thousand to another, giving the\r\nname; five thousand to another, until eleven sons and daughters had\r\nbeen remembered. He then brought this astounding will to a close by\r\nsaying, “These are not the children by my wife, but my children, by\r\nmy God.” One of our citizens would probably have died under the same\r\ncircumstances and bravely kept his lips closed to the last. So let\r\nus honor the sincerity and courage of the man. His widow has lost\r\nher vast fortune by the late turmoil in Peru and is now living very\r\nquietly in Florence, Italy.\r\n\r\nOur last diplomatic scandal relates to Victoria’s new protégé, the\r\nEnglish “envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary,” the Hon.\r\nLionel Sackville-West. If he were not Victoria’s “Knight of the\r\nGarter,” it would not be so sad. Now it appears that when Lionel\r\nwent to Spain as a young attaché he became desperately enamored with\r\na ballet-dancer. “He loved not wisely, but too well.” The proud\r\nSackville-Wests would have none of it. They declare to this day that\r\nLionel is a bachelor Simon pure, and so he is inscribed on the awful\r\nbook of the peerage. It is not understood whether the ballet-dancer\r\nhas put on angel plumage, but it is known that she left a brood of\r\nlittle chick Sackville-Wests, which the Honorable Lionel is willing\r\nto gather under his wings as a hen doth her chickens. His eldest\r\ndaughter is with him--his acknowledged child--and here lies all\r\nthe trouble. If he would only ignore her, or wait, as the Peruvian\r\nminister did, till he hears the toot of the last trump, Victoria\r\nand “Washington society” would wink at his little “escapades.” But\r\nthe British minister shows that he has a will of his own and a mind\r\nof his own, with the Prince of Wales to stand between him and his\r\nvirtuous sovereign. The capital is becoming alive with men who manage\r\nto elude the snares of matrimony, whilst the foreign legations--words\r\nfail not because the source is exhausted, but newspaper articles must\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSING SCENES IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nPEN PICTURES OF BLACKBURN, GARFIELD, RANDALL AND LESSER LIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 4, 1879_.\r\n\r\nPrematurely crushed before half its most important work was\r\nperformed, the Forty-fifth Congress of the Republic has ceased to\r\nlive. Its dying hours were marked with scenes of almost riotous\r\nconfusion, reminding one of the exciting days of “secession times.”\r\nIt is only when each great party has almost an equal number of\r\ncombatants in Congress that a hand-to-hand battle takes place. To-day\r\nthe men whose official career ends for the present in the House were\r\nthe plumed leaders in the strife. In the advance were Foster, of\r\nOhio; Hale, of Maine, and Durham, of Kentucky. To carry out the idea\r\nof death, flowers were strewn on the desks of departing members,\r\nand on the Speaker’s table uprose a pyramid of floral display. Not\r\nan inch of standing room was visible. Even the diplomatic gallery\r\ncontained an unusual number of distinguished foreigners, whilst that\r\npart designated as the “members’ gallery” was crowded to overflowing\r\nby the acknowledged leaders of the social world of which politics\r\nmake a part.\r\n\r\nOn a front seat in a central position sat Mrs. Hayes, conspicuous\r\namong the silks, satins, and jewels by the extreme simplicity of her\r\nattire, and lack of pretense of all that pertains to the aristocratic\r\nand exclusive. The black and shining bands of hair were drawn close\r\nand prim over the temples; the large gray eyes that warm or freeze\r\naccording to the will of the possessor; the shapely nose above the\r\ncold, thin lips, finished with a chin indicating strong points of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nNeither natural roses nor lilies bloomed in the members’ gallery.\r\nPale, sallow, worn-out women came who proved to the lookers-on what\r\na season of fashionable folly will do if permitted to have matters\r\nall its own way. But if real charms were lacking, the loss was\r\nfortunately replaced by wise manipulations of the artist. The “paint\r\npots” so vividly pictured by the immortal Vicar of Wakefield had been\r\nbrought into requisition, and Olivia and Sophie were as well prepared\r\nas ever for future triumph and conquest. The diplomatic gallery was\r\ngraced by the Brazilian, Dutch and Belgian ministers, and by the\r\npretty, modest daughters of Secretary Evarts, attended by some of the\r\nhandsome officials of the Department of State. Asia was represented,\r\nhalf and half, in the person of Yung Wing, of China, and his American\r\nwife. What a strange pair? He is a genuine son of the land of\r\nConfucius, with his dark-yellow skin drawn smooth like parchment over\r\nhis dome of thought; inky hair and eyes, and with all those strange\r\nhieroglyphic signs of mystery stamped on his sphinx-like face. Madame\r\nYung Wing seemed to enjoy her novel position, as she leaned back\r\nenveloped in all that finery which her marital captivity enables\r\nher to wear. This mingling of the races, to the honor of American\r\nwomen let it be recorded, happens only in the extremes of our social\r\nsystem--among the very highest or lowest--the diamonds or the dirt.\r\n\r\nThe gallery to the right of the Speaker is a study for the artist.\r\nEvery part of this broad land is represented. The Boston girl is\r\nthere, with a voice that reminds you of the higher notes of Ole\r\nBull’s supernatural violin. The most beautiful women of the continent\r\nspring from the land of the setting sun, descendants of the belles\r\nof the “blue grass region,” grown and ripened under the cool sun\r\nand peculiar atmosphere of Colorado and California. There they sit,\r\nmothers and daughters, as luscious to the eye as a basket of their\r\nown inimitable pears and transparent grapes. The women of the Sunny\r\nSouth were there. Slender, willowy creations, that remind you of\r\nDamascus blades. As full of passion as a fagot of wood with sticks,\r\neach one carries an invisible goad to prod the statesman if he even\r\nthinks of “compromise.” Stronger than ever are the women entrenched\r\nin the rulings of the House. Opposite the Speaker might have been\r\nseen Africa--reflected from the seats in all tints, from ebony to\r\n“Alderney cream.” Ever since the gallery doors were thrown open\r\nto this race the space is occupied. The cushioned seats have been\r\nremoved, but day after day of the session sees the same row, as\r\nthough the House were a great school in which the spectators are\r\npupils. Few colored women are to be seen, and the crowd seemed made\r\nup of those who have no employment, but who go to Congress to bask in\r\nthe artificial heat and enjoy the tropical magnificence to be felt on\r\nevery side.\r\n\r\nThe gavel falls on the Speaker’s table like the blacksmith’s blows on\r\nthe forge. A muttering silence follows. General Butler has left the\r\nRepublican side and rolls over to the Democratic. He glances down on\r\nthe diminutive figure of Aleck Stevens in his rolling chair, pauses a\r\nmoment as though he were going to speak, apparently changes his mind,\r\npasses on, then sinks into a chair with a staunch Democrat on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe semi-silence is broken, and the Honorable Charles Foster, of\r\nOhio, is on his feet. His face is very white, but his black eyes\r\nburn like the wolf’s in the cave when it was pursued by General\r\nIsrael Putnam. No man in the House commands more respect than the one\r\nwho has the floor. “Hear! hear!” In a moment the House was made to\r\nunderstand that Charley, as usual, had a political panacea to apply\r\nto the blistered situation; but his plan is hurled back by Atkins, of\r\nTennessee, and then the struggle to fasten the responsibility of an\r\nextra session begins.\r\n\r\nRapidly the hour hand describes the passage which marks the circle\r\nlying between 11 o’clock and 12. “Only a moment,” begs Atkins, “to\r\nput myself right before the country!” Hale, of Maine, intercedes\r\nfor a moment in which he “may set the Republican party all right,\r\nand fix the responsibility for all the calamities which may follow\r\nfuture Democratic legislation.” Anxious eyes glance at the clock.\r\nOnly twenty-five minutes left. A voice is heard pleading that the\r\ncrowd of ladies, composed largely of those who include members in the\r\n“family,” be permitted to occupy the floor. Speaker Randall asks if\r\nthere is any objection. None being raised, in an instant the doors\r\nbecome sluiceways through which pour a flood of feminine humanity.\r\nThis element spills itself in every direction; sinks into crevices\r\nmade vacant by retreating forms of members. In vain Speaker Randall\r\nasserts “the ladies are not to occupy the chairs within the circle.”\r\nThe timid ones slink back, but a few charming ones stick, and strange\r\nto say the members seem to like it. Conger, of Michigan, beckoned\r\nhis pretty daughter Florence to a seat beside him. In an instant\r\nthe vinegar and aggressive spleen disappeared from his countenance,\r\nproving that the ugly face he wears in Congress is only a mask. One\r\naged sinner, at least one old enough to know better, slipped his arm\r\naround the back of a chair, and though no apparent damage was done\r\nit was enough to prove the crookedness of the legislative mind. The\r\nflirtations on the floor occupied very little time, and divided the\r\nspace consumed in receiving messages from the Senate. All at once a\r\ntall man rises in the gallery, and says audibly to the people around:\r\n“A half dozen men on each side do the business; all the rest are\r\ndrummers!” After this mercantile speech, the stranger subsides. In\r\nthe midst of the excitement a burly form is seen entering a doorway,\r\nand a face lights up the surroundings as a beacon flame flings its\r\nbeams far out on a turbulent sea. Haul down the canvas; let go the\r\npumps; it is ex-Secretary Robeson, at last safely beached. Republican\r\nsympathy clings to him because he has no money, and thought it his\r\nduty to repair our war vessels so long as the port holes showed no\r\nsigns of decay.\r\n\r\nLeaning carelessly back, but in an attitude of inimitable grace\r\nstands Joe Blackburn of Kentucky, the “blue grass” boy who will be\r\nentered in the coming session for the Speaker’s race. Possessed of\r\nremarkable points of physical beauty, few men in Congress in this\r\nrespect can be called his peers. Tall and slender, made up entirely\r\nof bone, nerve and muscle, he seems the embodiment of life’s fiercest\r\nforces. The energy of his mind is in keeping with the casket, and his\r\nchances for the Speakership at the present time seem best of all.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield disturbs the stifling air by offering a resolution\r\nof thanks to Speaker Randall, who receives it with that becoming\r\nmodesty he knows so well how to assume. In a voice tremulous with\r\nemotion, in a few well chosen words, Honorable Sam. Randall announces\r\nhis labor and his arduous duties done; and for the last time the\r\ngavel descended, the curtain fell, whilst the Forty-fifth Congress\r\nentered that silent bourn from whence no traveler returns.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MATRIMONIAL REGISTER.\r\n\r\nLIST OF ELIGIBLES OF THE SENATE AND CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _December 24, 1879_.\r\n\r\n      “They don’t propose! They won’t propose!\r\n        For fear perhaps I’d say yes!\r\n      Just let ’em try it, for heaven knows\r\n        I’m tired of single blessedness!”\r\n\r\nAt the moment of writing the waters of social life are becalmed in\r\nWashington. Very little is doing in matrimonial business and mothers\r\nwith marriageable daughters are advised to hold on to the stock in\r\nhand (unless there is danger of spoiling), as an advance is expected\r\nas soon as a batch of single Congressmen arrive, and this interesting\r\nevent will probably happen soon after the holidays. General Ben\r\nButler is already here, and though he has shed his late Congressional\r\nskin and is no longer interesting on this account, he still has the\r\nchance to be governor of Massachusetts; but aside from this honor,\r\nany respectable matrimonial agency would give him a clean bill of\r\nsale the moment the right kind of a purchaser can be found. It is\r\nsaid the gallant General has a “blind eye,” but even with this fact\r\nin a woman’s favor it will be necessary to approach him as carefully\r\nas though he were gunpowder or an “infernal machine,” and be well\r\nprepared for the explosion which would be sure to follow. But it must\r\nbe remembered that all the valuable things of the earth are obtained\r\nat great personal sacrifice and often with loss of life. Just as the\r\nbiggest pearls are fished from the deepest waters, the greatest men\r\nare brought to the right point with a corresponding loss of female\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\nSenator Sharon! “Lo! the conquering hero comes” on the breath of\r\nthe wind, at the same time hitched behind a fiery locomotive. He is\r\nalready done up in broad-cloth and fine linen, and is probably at\r\nthis hour sleeping in his own “special car” as he rushes over the\r\nsteel roadway with which dear old Oakes Ames spanned the continent.\r\nWhat a picture of Oriental magnificence, with his almond-eyed,\r\ndark-haired daughter at his side! What a flutter among the dames of\r\nthe grand West End! In his presence a small bore of the Army and\r\nNavy, a “swell” of an upper clerk, or even an obscure Congressman\r\npales as the stars are wiped out by the effulgence of a full-blown\r\nsun! “But he ain’t handsome!” Shut up, you ill-bred child! Handsome\r\nis that handsome does! Didn’t Senator Sharon spend $40,000 on the\r\nGrant reception, and owns a house so large that people get lost in\r\nit? It takes as long to explore it as it does the Mammoth Cave! “What\r\ndoes he come here for, mamma?” “Why, to show his heathen Chinee, and\r\nsee if his glass shoe will fit any Cinderella at the capital.” “They\r\npared their heels and they pared their toes,” but the special car\r\ngoes back to the Pacific slope empty and tenantless, in one sense,\r\nas it came. The ripple subsides, to rise at each approach of the\r\n“special car,” and so the play goes on.\r\n\r\nSenator Booth, of California, is another matrimonial venture worth\r\nlooking after, but he has already been toughened by several winter\r\ncampaigns in Washington, until it is declared by those that ought\r\nto know that a sigh drawn fresh and pure from the deepest and most\r\ncapacious female bosom and applied to the right place will have\r\nno more effect than a Holman liver pad administered for lockjaw,\r\nwhilst a glance from the most brilliant eye falls like a sunbeam on\r\nan alligator’s back. Managing mammas have given up whist parties on\r\nhis account, because he is far more “whist” than the count. But the\r\nSenator is in a tolerable state of preservation, considering the\r\nnumber of sieges he has endured, and bids fair to return to the sand\r\nlots of California no worse for the tender wear and tear to which he\r\nhas been so cruelly subjected.\r\n\r\nIf there are any tears to shed, prepare to shed them now! Step\r\nsoftly! blind your eyes! This is Senator Ferry, of Michigan, he who\r\nhas convulsed the heart of woman, lo! these many years. Mothers\r\nhave plotted, widows intrigued, girls have cried for him, all to\r\nno purpose. It has taken subtle cunning to elude the snares spread\r\nfor his gentle, trusting being, but Senator Ferry has been equal\r\nto the trial and has come out of the fiery flames handsome and\r\njubilant as ever. Whilst the years come and go and at the same\r\ntime snatch the hairs from his brother Senators’ heads, leaving\r\ncrowsfeet all along the track, Senator Ferry defies the “Old Man\r\nof the Sickle,” and is just as capable of cracking a young girl’s\r\nheart to-day as when in the morning of his manly strength, before\r\nthe stars sang together. As soon as Congress assembles a committee\r\nwill be appointed to investigate the source of his mighty power, as\r\nit is not intended that one red-bearded Senator shall get more than\r\nhis share. As Senator Ferry usually buys up all newspapers which\r\nprint advertisements of him, this is intended as a cheap way to get\r\nrid of a solid edition of _The Times_, but the article will only\r\ncall for the usual liberal rate which it pays to its most valued\r\ncorrespondents.\r\n\r\nThe next names registered on the books of the matrimonial register\r\ncome under the head of “twins,” and such a pair of twins have never\r\nbeen seen since Gemini and Pollux took their places in the heavens\r\nin order to chase the “big bear” around the polar star. Possibly\r\nSenators Burnside and Anthony have been condensed into twins, because\r\nRhode Island is too small a State to hold them singly and apart. At\r\none time Senator Burnside came very near scaring off all the girls\r\nby wearing a gray night-cap in the daytime, but he immediately\r\nrallied and gave a lunch party and explained to the “wee darlin’s”\r\nthere wasn’t the slightest danger in it. The girls remonstrated,\r\nbut without avail, until Senator Anthony declared that he wouldn’t\r\nbe twin to a night-cap, even though it was the color of the\r\nside-whiskers, unless the gender could be changed. There is always\r\nan incipient battle going on between the two, similar in object and\r\nmanner as those in which the late Siamese twins indulged, but this\r\nis done simply to amuse each other and at the same time keep the\r\nthoughts of the female sirens out of their united minds; besides it\r\ntakes Senator Anthony all his spare time to keep Senator Burnside\r\nout of mischief. Since the Senatorial night-cap has been laid aside\r\nall sorts of mental eggs have been hatching in his brain, and some\r\ntime ago one of these eggs turned into an immense black horse and\r\ntwo-wheeled vehicle, adorned by a real tiger skin. This chariot was\r\ndriven by a Jehu black as the wings of night, and had not Senator\r\nBurnside sat by the sable driver the people of the capital would have\r\nbelieved that the whole contrivance was a phantom, such as Washington\r\nIrving used to paint with his magic pen. “I told him,” said Charlie\r\nFoster, “that he must not drive so fast. That his black beast was\r\na dray horse and not a ‘roadster.’” But the immense black animal,\r\nthe two black wheels, the sable driver, with the tiger skin flying,\r\nthundered up and down the Avenue, a target for the witty Stilson\r\nHutchins, whose paragraphs on the subject were looked for in the\r\n_Post_ with keener relish than the most aromatic coffee. Thin-skinned\r\nAnthony could stand it no longer and the black horse disappeared from\r\nCongressional history. It has never been ascertained whether it was a\r\nreal horse or one of those uncanny creations “conjured” by means of\r\nthe “black art,” but as everything about it was black and all in the\r\nhighest style of art, it is safe to pronounce it black art until a\r\nbetter word can be invented. Just as long as Senator Burnside is in\r\nthe Senate Senator Anthony will have his hands full. In the meantime\r\nmatrimonial schemes will be laid over as unfinished business, and\r\nthis is peculiarly trying, for the loss to some fair woman in not\r\nbeing allowed to cling to Senator Anthony is more painful than pen\r\ncan describe.\r\n\r\nAs altogether too much space of this valuable paper has been given\r\nto the irreclaimable old single-tops of the Senate, it is high\r\ntime the gay and festive “House” should be reached; but, alas! if\r\nthis is done, the “catchables” of the Cabinet will be overlooked,\r\nand what will Mrs. Hayes say? The writer knows very little about\r\nGeneral Devens, but it has been ascertained that he was not imported\r\nfrom England, but belongs to an entirely different breed, whilst\r\nPresident Hayes claims all the honor of original discovery. At any\r\nrate, it is well known that he was picked up on the codfish shores\r\nof Massachusetts in a remarkable state of preservation. General\r\nDevens is blue-blooded to the last degree, and it is claimed that a\r\nlarge portion of the fluid that runs in his veins was imported in\r\nthe _Mayflower_, and this accounts for the small quantity of it.\r\nWhilst there is enough for all Cabinet purposes and to occasionally\r\namuse Mrs. Hayes, the illuminating power seems to require some such\r\ntinker as the hero of Menlo Park to bring it to the required point of\r\nperfection. Like Edison’s electric light, though it “shines,” there\r\nis very little heat, and a girl complains that in his presence she\r\nalways has a cold nose, but it is declared that he shall not go out\r\nof the Cabinet on this account, and the probabilities are that he has\r\ncome to stay.\r\n\r\nListen to the mocking-bird! Trills, quavers, semi-quavers,\r\ndemi-semi-quavers, a flute, a flageolet, a dulcimer! It is only\r\nthe voice of Carl Schurz, but it is a whole opera concealed in his\r\nthroat. Creation has contrived a few voices whose intonation in\r\nspeech is the highest and most triumphant music. Such sounds come\r\nout of the mouth of a shell. It is heard in the patter of a fairy\r\ncascade. It is the hissing ring of the rain as it kisses the bosom\r\nof the dimpled deep. Nature’s pure, sweet, unadulterated chimes--not\r\nspoiled by “foreign master” or any other training. Born in a castle,\r\nthe son of a gamekeeper; half aristocrat, half peasant; haughty as\r\na king; humble as the lowliest who seek his favor; least understood\r\nbecause his intellect includes both large and small gifts culled from\r\nthe whole vast domain which governs the law of humanity--daughters\r\nadmire him, mothers fear him, fathers hate him. Why? Because he is\r\nnot only a man, but somewhat more! During office hours he attends\r\nto business precisely like other Cabinet officers, with even more\r\naccuracy and attention, but, his work done, the uncanny orgie begins.\r\nHe has the power to draw the most weird and unearthly music out of\r\nhis piano. The yells of the cats before they were made into “strings”\r\nare revived with added ferocity. All the sounds of nature are\r\nimitated. He is never weary and never lies down, but he has been seen\r\nto uncoil, throw his head back, open his lips and show his white,\r\nglistening fangs. Then somebody is sure to get hurt. When Mother\r\nNature begins to pull the string to let down the curtain of night, a\r\ndark, slender horse, bearing upon its back a tall, sinuous form, may\r\nbe seen flying in a northeasterly direction. Nothing more solemn and\r\nghoul-like can be imagined. To the awful northeast lies “Edgewood,”\r\nmost sentimental of earthly pilgrimages. Cemeteries here and there\r\nblot the highway. The lonely road stretches on, unlit by flash except\r\na “Jack o’ lantern,” which leads the way for the dark horse of the\r\nsmoking flank. Once Senator Conkling was taking an airing in this\r\ndirection for his poor health’s sake and met the “horseman.” It\r\nwas more than his nerves could bear. Edgewood is now deserted, the\r\ncemeteries are all quiet, and the “vision” is left to its own mad\r\ncareer. Any woman who meditates “designs” on Carl Schurz should first\r\ncultivate a love for sulphur and practice with an electric battery\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nThe House may safely be called an ocean of matrimonial possibilities.\r\nWhen mothers say “there are as good fish in the sea as ever were\r\ncaught,” they have direct reference to the House, the lurking-place\r\nof so much that is sweet, shy and forbidding. Here, at almost any\r\nhour of the Congressional day, may be seen “sporting” a whole shoal\r\nof bachelor Greenbackers; but their backs are no more green than\r\ntheir fellow members, unless the verdant tint may be noticed with\r\nwhich all Congressmen are more or less afflicted. Here bachelor Le\r\nFevre spouts like a great sperm whale; and one speculates on the\r\nquantity of oil he would “turn out,” and feels sad to think he was\r\nnot discovered before the coal oil regions, for in that case he\r\nwould have proved of vast service to the world. At present he is\r\nostensibly engaged in storming the departments to find places for his\r\nconstituents, but the real truth shows that he is only exhibiting his\r\nhandsome person to the Treasury girls as a target, and each one is\r\nallowed a given number of shots at the mark. As the space allotted\r\nby _The Times_ to its most valued correspondents has been filled to\r\nthe brim and just a little slopped over, it is announced that the\r\nnext article will take up dear, precious Charley O’Neill. It will\r\ntreat of the sentimental damage wrought at the capital by this “broth\r\nof a boy,” for if all his “doin’s” could be made visible to mortal\r\neye, the old Keystone State would blot out the memory of its late\r\nCentennial glory and at the same time give General Grant a rest.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACHELORS AND WIDOWERS.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSMEN SPEER, CLYMER, ACKLEY AND O’NEILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 15, 1880_.\r\n\r\n      “Birdie, oh, come and live with me;\r\n      You shall be happy--you shall be free.”\r\n\r\nContrary to all precedents of the past, the coming of Congress has\r\nhad little or no effect on the matrimonial market, although it is\r\nconfidently believed that Charley O’Neill is holding a vast amount\r\nof “stock.” Notwithstanding the danger and difficulties of carrying\r\nthis weight, he has decided to enact the role of the immortal Don\r\nQuixote, and has already planted the banner of his famous predecessor\r\non the soil of the capital of the New World. But lest Philadelphia\r\ntake umbrage at this unnatural exploit, as it looks like spurning\r\nthe city of his beloved soul, he wishes it understood that had he\r\nfixed Philadelphia as a starting-point he would have been confined\r\nby the meshes of the Camerons, whereas Washington, being the centre\r\nof civilization, offers facilities that cannot be breached until\r\nthe farthest limit of the whole country is reached. As matters now\r\nstand, there isn’t a maid or widow at the capital whose heart is not\r\npit-a-pat, and even married women are providing against a morning\r\nof storm which might close in perpetual sunshine. Already the first\r\ncelebrated battle has been fought, and contrary to the usage of\r\nancient chivalry. But as this is a different age, and bottom side\r\nthe globe as to Spain, it must not be expected that ancient rules\r\nwill be followed. When Charley O’Neill attacked the windmills the\r\nother day in the House it was found that he had hit Sam Randall in\r\ndisguise. When he learned that he had got the wrong pig by the ear,\r\nhe soon scattered his forces and comforted himself by thinking, if\r\nhe had not destroyed a windmill of which Philadelphia would be well\r\nglad to be rid, the skirmish at least had been fought in the “Cave\r\nof the Winds,” and if not up to the standard of “knight errantry,”\r\nhad sufficient of the Quixotic flavor to answer every modern purpose.\r\nFor the present he has decided to save the expense of a “Squire,”\r\nunless Congress will make an appropriation. Besides, Sancho Panza\r\nwould be in the way if he were the true metal of the Spanish sort.\r\nBut to remove this difficulty a private secretary has been found\r\nwho will open his tender missives; escort distressed damsels to\r\nthe theatre; gorge himself at “society lunches,” and sigh like a\r\n“lying trooper” when the proper parties are around. Charley O’Neill\r\nwants Philadelphia to know that most of his mischief is performed\r\nby proxy, and when he returns he will be none the worse for wear.\r\nOn account of the slippery pavements he will not be provided with a\r\n“Rosinante,” but not to disappoint his constituents he has determined\r\nto get upon his “high horse” on the floor of Congress whenever a\r\npestiferous Democrat shows his hand. A magnificent belle of the\r\n“West End” has offered him a plume for his hat, but he disdains\r\nsuch marks of frivolity and declares that he will appear only in\r\nthe simple armor of an American citizen. This consists of a clean\r\nwhite shirt, a neat broad-cloth coat--which under no circumstances\r\ncan be “swallow-tail”--Wanamaker pantaloons and patent-leathers.\r\nThe hat--a soft felt hat--capable of almost any expression. When he\r\nenters the Capitol in this harmless disguise the sensation would\r\nbe indescribable if the attention was not divided by the roar of\r\nKelley, he who has played the role of lion ever since his celebrated\r\ninterview with Bismarck, which settled the bi-metallic squabble in\r\nboth hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe editor of _The Times_ is notified that a column could be\r\nfurnished concerning Charley O’Neill, the Quaker City’s favorite\r\nson, and the article would be as crisp and tender as young radishes\r\nin spring, but will it pay to build up a reputation that will last\r\nas long in the future as Don Quixote has in the past? Whilst _The\r\nTimes_ is solving the important problem, the dainty and delicate\r\nAcklen shall be served up. Congressman Acklen, of Louisiana, is\r\none of the youngest and handsomest “bachelors” in the House, and\r\nwhilst attending strictly to his Congressional duties he has been\r\nfortunate enough to get mixed up in more “scrapes” in which women\r\nhave a part than any half dozen members put together. Last winter he\r\nfigured at Welcker’s in what might be termed a “celebrated case,”\r\nor would be if the bottom facts could be found. His partner in the\r\nmelee was a beautiful golden-haired widow from New York. Telegrams\r\nflew all over the country; there was a suspension of the rules of\r\nthe House. The principal witness, an army officer, who appeared to\r\nhave conscientious scruples, fearing an “investigation,” escaped to\r\nCanada. The widow published a card in the papers, announcing that\r\nCongressman Acklen had “offered” to marry her, but she refused to\r\nbe comforted in that way. This performance healed the young widow’s\r\nreputation. Mrs. Welcker published a card also, saying nothing of the\r\nkind ever occurred at her house. This saved the honor of the hotel.\r\nAt the same time a kind of Chinese din was kept up, which proved that\r\nthe army officer left suddenly to avoid “a debt of honor,” whilst\r\nthe widow ran away to California and set the whole Russian fleet on\r\nfire, which happened to be temporarily stopping in the San Francisco\r\nharbor. In the meantime Congressman Acklen occupied his seat in the\r\nHouse, “the observed of all observers,” looking as innocent as a\r\nThomas cat whose whiskers are scarcely bereft of the cream. He had\r\nall the sympathy of his brother members, because they felt certain he\r\nwould learn their caution in time; but, sad to relate, he had hardly\r\nset foot in his beloved New Orleans before he tripped and fell\r\ninto another “scandal.” It would consume too much of the valuable\r\nspace of _The Times_ to record this part of his history, but it can\r\nall be found in any of the files of last year’s Louisiana papers.\r\nBut he is here again, as clean and bright as ever, and to prove his\r\nrestoration he has left the unhealthy moral atmosphere of the “West\r\nEnd” and rented a mansion on the pure heights of Capitol Hill, where\r\nevery spot is hallowed by the virtuous Father of his Country. To be\r\naway from temptations of all kinds he has taken an aged widow for\r\nhousekeeper, with her two beautiful grown daughters, just to keep the\r\nsex in mind. In this way he puts down scandal, and he is never seen\r\ngoing to his own house except at the proper hours of the day. Just as\r\nthe banana and the orange, by their lusciousness, show their tropical\r\norigin, Congressman Acklen proves by his appearance that he is the\r\n“Son of the Sunny South.” Hardly beyond the middle size, beautifully\r\nmoulded, with raven hair and scarlet lips, he impresses the beholder\r\nwith his curious intensity and concentration, just as the diamond\r\nflashes out its liquid fire; but he is a real “lady-killer” in the\r\nlongest, broadest, deepest sense of the word, and he is only 30 years\r\nold, and refuses to be sobered by the holy bands of wedlock; but\r\nthe edge of his wickedness is being borne away by the attrition of\r\nnational notoriety and the fast-increasing fastidiousness of his own\r\ntaste, and yet his reputation rather endears him than otherwise to\r\nfashionable “society.”\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has more bachelors in the House than its proper quota as\r\ncompared to other States; but this may be the harmless way which the\r\n“Old Keystone” takes to get rid of her extra rubbish. Hiester Clymer\r\nis here, apparently cold, hard, and indestructible as Allegheny\r\ngranite, and he strikes those with whom he is brought in contact\r\nby the same feeling awakened at the touch of rugged sublimity. The\r\ngrandeur of the mountain! The solemnity of the sea! Who would dare to\r\nlaugh and jest in his presence? The writer has been informed by some\r\nof his brother members that he has a remarkably sweet and winning\r\nmanner to the few privileged to occupy the chambers of his soul; and\r\nwe should remember the rough, brown husk of the nut is no indication\r\nof the kernel. High-toned and kingly in manner on the floor, always\r\nthe right word in the right place. For nearly if not quite a dozen\r\nyears, for we write from memory only, his stalwart form has been a\r\nlandmark in the Pennsylvania delegation, or a sort of Democratic\r\nwharf against which the spray and foam of the Republican ocean has\r\nmadly dashed in vain. In reputation, so far as women are concerned,\r\nhis character is the reverse of Congressman Acklen; but suppose he\r\nhad been contrived on a sugar plantation, done up in a creole skin,\r\nforged, as it were, under the very eyelids of the tropics? What then?\r\nShouldn’t Pennsylvania get down on her stony old knees and thank\r\nheaven that her Congressmen are not made like Southern men?\r\n\r\nAs if to correct the acidity of the delegation, Congressman Herr\r\nSmith is added on, just as the last lump of sugar is put in to\r\nperfect the coffee cup. Whilst having all the virtues, he is believed\r\nto have none of the vices, and his moral character at the capital\r\nis always quoted No. 1; risks few and readily taken. Society knows\r\nlittle or nothing about him, but the quantity, small as it is, may\r\nbe set down to his decided advantage. He has the reputation of being\r\nrich, but there is little show or ostentation. He is always in his\r\nseat, always at work, apparently with nothing but his constituents’\r\ninterests at heart. It would be better for our sex if it were\r\notherwise, but no delicate-minded woman would think of disturbing the\r\nserenity of his soul, and he keeps so far away from the other kind\r\nthat an accident never can happen. No one doubts but at some period\r\nof his life the ocean of sentiment in his bosom has been traversed by\r\ngulf streams of romance, and he, too, like Whittier, can sing: “The\r\nsaddest of all, it might have been.” Blessed be the spiritual hand\r\nthat touches the human heart-strings only to awaken the divinest\r\nmelody, and thrice blessed is he who knows how to avoid those pits in\r\nthe soul whose black depths reflect bitterness, satire, and irony.\r\nSide by side in every great mind the Creator has ranged the awful\r\ncaldrons of good and evil. Congressman Smith knows how to thread the\r\nmazy way with pleasure to himself and honor to all concerned.\r\n\r\nAs it has been the intention to give the South the same fair showing,\r\napples and oranges, hardy roses, and magnolias, Georgia comes in with\r\na Congressman who, though never a “bachelor,” is a festive widower of\r\nfive months’ duration. “Emory Speer, Athens, Georgia,” is engraved on\r\nhis cards, and considering what should be termed his “recent grief”\r\nit would seem very wrong to embalm him in the papers. But he gives\r\npublic parties at his hotel, leads off in the “german,” flirts with\r\nthe girls, and is not that sufficient reason to believe that he is\r\nnot the kind who enjoys the luxury of grief without some sort of\r\nmitigation? Possibly he may have taken this dashing way to cover his\r\nsorrow, but the young ladies believe that he is in dead earnest, and\r\nif it were not for his five children and lack of permanent fortune\r\nhe would be considered already one of the “catches” of the season.\r\nHe was a Confederate soldier when only 16 years of age, served all\r\nthrough the late war, studied law with Ben Hill and became his\r\nsuccessor when he was promoted to the Senate. Singularly handsome\r\nin person and winning in manner, volatile and boyish to the last\r\ndegree, he is not to be judged by the hard, stern law to which we\r\ncold-blooded Nor’westers bow the knee. At any rate, he is sincerity\r\nitself, and probably he may be a big child in disguise. Who knows\r\nwhen the threshold of manhood or womanhood has been passed? There\r\nis a character in Hawthorne’s “Marble Faun” always supposed to be\r\nromance. But here in Congress is the case that fits it. Who dare sit\r\nin judgment on a fellow-mortal? He that is wisest is the most humble,\r\nand those who are dearest will give us a rest.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOTANIC GARDEN.\r\n\r\nSOME SIDE GLANCES AT THE EXPENDITURES FOR THAT INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 18, 1880_.\r\n\r\nAlthough a fraction only of the single men in Congress have cut a\r\nfigure in these papers, a little deviation takes place this week\r\nto show the people what it costs to keep Congressmen armed with\r\nbouquets, for these are the weapons in modern use which bring down\r\nthe game which is best worth bagging. But it must not be thought by\r\nthe reader that the vast greenhouses at the capital, kept in being\r\nat government expense, are appropriated entirely by the bachelor\r\nCongressmen. On the contrary, married Senators and members leave\r\ntheir orders through a page. This has been proved time after time by\r\na Congressman’s wife receiving a bouquet with a card attached bearing\r\nanother woman’s name; but as her husband’s, in fact no male signature\r\nof any kind appears she immediately seeks her mirror in proof of\r\nanother conquest. True, she realizes that her youthful hey-day is\r\nover; that mutton has taken the place of lamb-chop (Ben: Perley\r\nPoore is the authority for declaring that “all men prefer it”),\r\nbut she knows that some mutton always stays tender, and when this\r\nkind can be found even Ben: Perley Poore or Senator Conkling will\r\nnot disdain it. But coming back to the national greenhouses, which\r\nare as distinct from the Agricultural Department as the different\r\nCabinet portfolios; in other words, the Botanic Garden sustains the\r\nsame relation to Congress as the conservatory of any mansion to its\r\nsolitary owner. The Republic furnishes another garden and immense\r\nconservatory for the exclusive use of the White House; and when it\r\nis seen how hundreds of thousands of dollars of the public funds go\r\nfor the luxury of flowers alone, it will not be wondered that the\r\ngrowth of “imperialism” is going ahead with breakneck speed, for it\r\nis very sweet and lovely when all jobs and bills can be squared by an\r\n“appropriation.”\r\n\r\nA spectator standing on the western terrace of the Capitol sees an\r\ninnocent tract of land enclosed by a most costly fence. Broad avenues\r\nand romantic walks disturb the monotony of the closely-shaven velvet\r\nsward; while trees rare as oriental sandal wood have been brought\r\nfrom every portion of the earth’s surface to adorn this domain of\r\nrepublican royalty. Almost hidden by the fence and far removed\r\nfrom the vulgar eyes of the common herd outside, the magnificent\r\nBartholdi fountain spurts its fair life away. Instead of putting\r\nthis exquisite fountain at the intersection of Pennsylvania avenue\r\nand Seventh street, or even at the foot of the Capitol, now turned\r\ninto a graveyard by the mouldy genius of Admiral Porter, it has\r\nbeen smuggled into the low grounds of the Botanic Gardens for the\r\nexclusive use of romantic Congressmen who, when wandering slowly\r\nwith women who incline to be fast, turn their modest faces toward\r\nthe genius of Bartholdi in the hope that the soothing play of the\r\nimmortal fountain will at once arrest any demonstration not of the\r\nstraight-laced kind. To the rear the greenhouses assert themselves\r\nwith a grandeur of architectural beauty which the Government funds\r\nalone can bestow. To get a foretaste of Paradise, or to recall the\r\nglory of the Garden of Eden, it is only necessary to wander through\r\nthe mazes of lovers’ paths with which the Congressional greenhouses\r\nare profusely intersected. From the foot of the most northern crag\r\nkissed by the fiery aurora borealis to the molten girdle that clasps\r\nAfrica’s burning waist the vegetable glory of the earth has been\r\nwrested to minister to Congressional comfort. In the pursuit the\r\ntrackless sea has been plowed alike by war vessels and merchantmen.\r\nThe most interesting spot connected with the greenhouses is the\r\n“propagating garden,” where all sorts of curious experiments are\r\ntried. Not content to let each flower produce after its own kind,\r\nall sorts of horticultural black art is invoked to produce mongrel\r\ntypes, which come from a curious propagating performance, which even\r\na Congressman cannot understand. Sometimes the gardener succeeds in\r\ndoubling the leaves of a single flower, to the loss of all sweetness\r\nand perfume, just as we have seen the thing happen when the flowers\r\nwere human instead of vegetable. Striped roses and lilies are\r\nobtained in place of the good, old-fashioned solid colors. To produce\r\nthese freaks, or to make old Mother Nature change her every-day\r\nprogram, appropriations are made that would astonish the people,\r\nconsidering the surroundings of most of the Congressmen before they\r\nare born into official life.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, or nearly half a century ago, the beaux in Congress\r\nconcluded it would be a good thing to have bouquets fashioned for\r\ntheir buttonholes at the public expense. Flowers in those primitive\r\ndays were obtained with much trouble and expense, so the initiatory\r\nsteps to free flowers was taken by an appropriation of $5,000 to be\r\nused in this way: “For conveying the surplus water of the Capitol\r\nto the Botanic Garden, making a basin, and purchasing a fountain\r\nfrom Hiram Powers.” Before the year was ended it was found that\r\n$5,000 would not relieve the Capitol of its surplus water, and\r\nan additional appropriation was made the same year of $3,614.04.\r\nFrom 1836 to May, 1850, nothing was taken from the public funds\r\nfor flowers. In place of nosegays to titillate the Congressional\r\nnostrils these rough old forefathers used snuff, but this was\r\nalso provided at Government expense and the modest snuff-boxes on\r\neither side of the Vice-President’s chair, and those to be found\r\nin the House, will remain for all time as simple reminders of the\r\nhabits of our modest ancestors in comparison to the ravages of the\r\nCongressional greenhouses as they stand in the pillory of public\r\nopinion to-day. With the departure of dear old Thurman the last of\r\nthe old-time snuff-takers disappears. The last wave of his ancient\r\nbandana heralds the Senatorial coming of one of the most aggressive\r\nmovers on the stronghold of all the appropriations. In 1850, $5,000\r\nwas taken from the public funds and in 1851, $750 only. A rest came\r\nhere until 1855, when $1,500 was taken to build a house in which to\r\nstore the plants brought from Japan, and during the same year $12,000\r\nwas taken at one time and $3,000 at another to fix up the grounds\r\nof the Botanic Garden and put them in proper order. In 1856 the\r\ngrounds still wanted to be fixed to the amount of $5,650 at one time\r\nand $11,000 at another of the same year, and the “grounds” hardly a\r\nscant half-dozen acres in extent; in fact, only two squares long,\r\nbut not two whole squares deep. Following up the official figures it\r\nis found that $6,000 more was expended on the Botanic Garden, taken\r\nfrom another appropriation, making for the year 1856, $22,650. This\r\nit was claimed was paid for “draining the grounds in the vicinity\r\nof the national greenhouses.” In 1857--$2,600 at one time, $5,000\r\nat another, but all the same year, and from another appropriation\r\n$3,360, making in all $10,960 for the year 1857. In 1858, $2,600 at\r\none time, $3,360 at another, making the round sum of $5,960. The\r\nyears 1859 and 1860 only required a thousand each for the bouquets,\r\nand during the war, to the credit of Congress let it be recorded, not\r\na dollar was sunk in the Botanic swamp so far as can be ascertained\r\nin the Congressional records. But in 1866 the rage for flowers broke\r\nout afresh, and it required $2,500 to stop the wound, which continued\r\nwhen the vast sum of $25,057.90 was required to build the bouquets\r\nto the right proportion--a sum which exceeded the President’s yearly\r\nsalary the same year. In 1867 it took $35,000; in 1868, $41,784.05,\r\netc., etc. The figures alone stretch out until the crack of doom. Let\r\nit be understood that such men as that pure statesman Garfield held\r\nthe strings of the public purse and helped on these appropriations.\r\nGeneral Garfield is promoted to the Senate; Thurman, the statesman,\r\nremanded to private life.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the last of the large appropriations was made, and this\r\nrepresented $16,925. About this time the Republican party began\r\nto weaken, and with it the innocent taste of lovely flowers. It\r\nmust not be understood these vast sums represented the flowers at\r\nso much apiece; but it always happened that the Botanic Garden\r\nwas crying for tools, more greenhouses, fertilizers, brick walls,\r\niron fences, glazing and painting. Its pathways were in a constant\r\nstate of eruption; its gates always hanging on broken hinges.\r\nSeneca stone was constantly giving out and always in peremptory\r\ndemand. The substantial fences were always going out of fashion and\r\nneeded to be replaced as often as a woman’s headgear. The call for\r\n“tubs, pots, packing materials, labels, seeds, envelopes, grading,\r\nrepairing, sewers, horse hire and manure,” ascended to heaven like\r\nthe cry of the young ravens for food. Could Garfield, chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Appropriations, withstand these demands on the\r\npublic funds? During these historic days of fat appropriations\r\nthe Woodhull sisterhood attempted to establish a “colony” at the\r\nCapitol. Brisbane, of pneumatic fame, succeeded in getting a\r\n$15,000 appropriation to sustain life whilst he should dig a ditch\r\nfrom the Capitol to the Government printing office. The colony was\r\nbeing planted, the ditch was being dug all at the same time, and\r\nextra flowers were needed for the Christian statesmen in Congress\r\nto reclaim the “colony,” or at least make it so fragrant that the\r\ncitizens of the District could endure the new innovation sustained\r\nby Congressional influence and protected by the sacrifices of the\r\nChristian statesmen. Flowers in the missionary cause were needed, and\r\nParson Garfield, chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, stood\r\nat the mouth of the public purse and dealt out the shining thousands\r\nas Aladdin showered the sequins brought him by the genii invoked by\r\nhis wonderful lamp. To the credit of a Democratic Congress let it\r\nbe recorded that no vast sums have been “appropriated” to keep the\r\nbouquet business in full bloom. If the Confederate brigadiers wear\r\nthe “society” bouquet, they pay for them as they do their cigars.\r\nIt is declared by those who ought to know that the Botanic Garden\r\nis on the road to swift decay; that it has little or no support,\r\nexcept from the water which flows from the Congressional baths, and\r\nconsidering the source, it is astonishing what excellent results have\r\nbeen achieved. Sam Randall declares that so long as the greenhouses\r\ncan be made to flourish in this way he will not “object” to the\r\ncleanliness if it will prevent an “appropriation;” besides the\r\nbouquets derived from such a source are almost sentimentally equal\r\nto the flower which the maiden sent her lover that had been “watered\r\nwith her tears.”\r\n\r\nFor many years the luxurious accessories of the toilet have been\r\non the free list in the Senate. Thousands of dollars are invested\r\nyearly in soap, tooth brushes, infant powder, perfumery, brandy and\r\nwhiskey, combs, Turkish toweling, lemons, and tea. And this is one\r\nof the safest investments of the public funds. What right has the\r\nnation to elect Senators if they cannot afford to keep them clean?\r\nIsn’t cleanliness next to godliness; and isn’t this purity of the\r\nbody about as close to the Creator as the average Senator attempts\r\nto reach? Free flowers have been the only free luxuries in which the\r\nless aristocratic branch had the same right, and is it a wonder that\r\nit required more than $41,000 in a single year to make the sweets go\r\naround?\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE RECEPTIONS COMPARED.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS PREVAILING UNDER THE LINCOLN, GRANT, HAYES AND JOHNSON\r\nREGIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 6, 1880_.\r\n\r\nA residence at the national capital which spans the social rule from\r\nthe days of queenly Harriet Lane to the present “first lady” at the\r\nWhite House affords an opportunity to note the different changes and\r\npeculiar innovations inaugurated by those whom fate or accident has\r\ncalled to wield the most powerful social scepter to be found upon\r\nthe face of the globe. The public need not be told that the wife of\r\nour President has more real political power than Queen Victoria.\r\nTrue, she does not ride “in state,” drawn by eight cream-colored\r\nhorses to open Parliament in person, but she waits carefully in an\r\nante-room, and when Cabinet sessions are over seizes upon the head\r\nof any of the Departments, and then and there, like a Catharine or\r\nElizabeth, makes known her command. Mrs. Abraham Lincoln inaugurated\r\nthis excellent plan of doing business, because the exigencies of the\r\nwar wholly occupied the mind and time of the President, and it became\r\nnecessary for the “first lady” to look after the minor affairs of the\r\ncountry at this particular date. To prove exactly what the writer\r\nmeans, the case of the first Commissioner of Agriculture is called\r\nup. Several crafty men put their heads together and decided to call\r\ninto being a “Bureau Of Agriculture.” Its different departments were\r\nto be “run,” each one by its particular head, independent of the\r\nother. It was to be a cluster of little kingdoms with a nominal head\r\nthat should be empty of ideas, possessing only one requisite, that\r\nof managing Mrs. Lincoln and the appropriation of the public funds.\r\nThese shrewd men made the good old Quaker Newton believe that he was\r\namong the greatest men of the universe, and while he was busy talking\r\n“spiritualism” to our “first lady,” escorting her with his old time\r\nchivalry and grace to the humble homes of the “mediums,” the head men\r\nof his department were scattering the worthless seeds broadcast over\r\nthe country and making up those absurd reports which have brought\r\nridicule on one of the most important branches of the public service\r\ndown to the present time.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive and gorgeous receptions which the writer\r\never attended was given by the President and Mrs. Lincoln toward the\r\nlast of this important term. The White House looked old, worn, and\r\ndingy, for this preceded the golden splendor of the Grant regime, but\r\nthe brilliancy and magnificence was made up by the scarlet uniforms\r\nof the Marine Band with the gilt buttons and shoulderstraps of the\r\nbrave defenders of the Union, who clustered about the capital in\r\nthose historic days. The same struggling tide of humanity inundated\r\nthe doors of the Executive Mansion, but at every turn a soldier was\r\nstationed to keep the crowd within the limit of Mrs. Lincoln’s law.\r\nBayonets glittered over the daintily dressed heads and bare shoulders\r\nof the beautifully dressed ladies who declared that “mob law” was now\r\ninaugurated and “they should never visit the White House again, until\r\na change.” But if the guests felt insulted at the presence of the\r\nbayonets what was their astonishment upon going into the “presence”\r\nto find a genuine crown on Mrs. Lincoln’s head. It was made of gilt,\r\nbut looked precisely like those which are found on the heads of\r\nthose distinguished women about whom we read in Agnes Strickland’s\r\n“Lives of the Queens of England.” The stones or gems were wanting,\r\nbut the tinsel and gilt were all there. There was only time allowed\r\nto note that dear old Abraham looked down at the little “bobbing”\r\nwoman at his side as he might at a frolicsome kitten, then a cold\r\nsteel bayonet pressed the writer’s shoulder, while the military gruff\r\nvoice added: “Pass on! pass on!” Afterwards it was ascertained that\r\nthe “crown” was a harmless head-dress invented by a Philadelphia\r\nmilliner, and that Mr. Lincoln ridiculed it so severely that its\r\ndebut and withdrawal all took place the same night. It was Mrs.\r\nLincoln who arranged that a division of society should be made after\r\nthe guests have entered the White House. She had a door set apart\r\nfor the Judges of the Supreme Court, Senators, Army and Navy, and\r\nforeign ministers. Members of Congress were herded with the common\r\npeople, and actually forced through the same door. When Mrs. Julia\r\nGrant succeeded to the sceptre she realized that any distinction of\r\nthis kind would make any administration unpopular; so she decided\r\nthat all persons who entered the front door of the mansion were\r\nentitled to the same social privilege, and all doors should be alike\r\nto the guests. But to get over the difficulty and please royalty as\r\nwell as democracy, Mrs. Grant discovered a side door, a sort of sneak\r\nentrance, where those who wished to avoid the crowd could pass in,\r\ntake up their positions in the rear of the “throne,” and glare upon\r\nthe struggling crowd of humanity as it passed by in single file.\r\n\r\nWith astonishment the writer learned by personal experience that Mrs.\r\nHayes has revived Mrs. Lincoln’s law as to the aristocracy of the\r\ndoors. Last Saturday for the first time at a public reception the\r\nwriter entered the White House. Seeing an immense crowd struggling to\r\ngo through one door, and kept back by the police, while at another in\r\nclose proximity only now and then a few were permitted to pass, upon\r\ninquiry it was learned that a door was set apart for the privileged\r\nfew. As the hour was about to expire and it was found that if we\r\nwaited our “turn” with the crowd there would be no view of republican\r\nroyalty that day, at least, it was learned that a fat man in another\r\npart of the mansion had the power to let even a common person slip\r\nthrough the aristocratic door, and by means of that bribery which the\r\n“minions of the press” know so well how to bestow, access was gained\r\nthe “presence” and a picture was hung on the walls of memory, to\r\nlast us as long as the soul floats down the great river of eternity.\r\nIn the same room the writer had gazed at a wonderful kaleidoscope.\r\nInstead of bits of colored glass, it was men and women shifting about\r\nin the hands of Time, beginning with the rare beauty and unstudied\r\ngrace of Harriet Lane as she stood by the side of President Buchanan,\r\nfollowed by Mrs. Lincoln and her tinsel crown, succeeded by the\r\ndaughters of Andy Johnson, who said, “We are plain people from the\r\nmountains of Tennessee; too much, we fear, is expected of us.” Then\r\nJulia Dent Grant, who possesses the wonderful power of conciliating\r\nall the distracting elements which help unite social and political\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIt is a historic fact that the White House is modeled after the\r\npalace of the Duke of Leister. This accounts for the lofty walls so\r\ndecorated and beautiful in frescoes that they resemble in intention,\r\nif not in genius, the noble creations wrought by Raphael and Michael\r\nAngelo. As the eye descends from the ceiling it rests upon the inlaid\r\nfloor, but this is covered with carpeting so thick that the tramp\r\nof a regiment would be noiseless as phantom wings. Ebony furniture\r\nwith richest satin upholstering, candelabra which reach from floor\r\nto mantel, holding waxen candles all ready to light, pictures on\r\nthe walls, huge baskets of flowers, with decorated pots of greenery\r\nscattered everywhere. In a row, like school girls in a class, stood\r\nthe wives and daughters of the Cabinet officials, with Mrs. President\r\nHayes at the head. That it was strictly “official” was proved by the\r\norder observed in their positions. Just as the departments are ranked\r\nthe women stood. State, then Treasury, War, Post Office, Interior\r\nand Attorney-General. Mrs. Hayes may safely be called a “handsome\r\nwoman,” and there will none be found brave enough to dispute the\r\npalm. A brunette of the purest type, with large, brilliant eyes that\r\nconvey the idea of surface but not depth--like a transparent window\r\nthat opens into space--a rather low, Greek forehead, over which is\r\nbanded that shining mass of satin hair. If the glossy coronet could\r\nbe improved by wave or bangs; but the dark, rich brunette complexion\r\nforbids this modern fashion, and Mrs. Hayes is an artist in one\r\nor more ways. Clad in rich, ruby satin and silk combination, the\r\ncorsage square and low, as Pompadour invented to call attention to\r\nher charms, no fault can be found with Mrs. Hayes, for her dress\r\nis as costly and showy as any worn by the celebrated beauties who\r\nflourished in the Cabinet during the Grant reign. Mrs. Hayes has\r\ninvented a way to shake hands which ought to be known to the official\r\nworld, as it saves this useful member from crushing annihilation.\r\nNever give your fingers to the crowd, and, instead of allowing your\r\nown hand to be seized, grasp the unruly enemy by the hand as far as\r\nthe unfortunate thumb will permit you to go, one vigorous squeeze,\r\nand the torment is over. All this is done on the same principle of a\r\ncollision at sea. It is the vessel that is hit that sustains all the\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nA plain, dignified, matronly woman stood next to Mrs. Hayes. A\r\nlace cap--Quaker-like in its simplicity--rested on her snowy hair,\r\na self-trimmed black silk dress (for Mrs. Evarts has not wholly\r\ndiscarded mourning for a beloved son) made one of the simplest\r\ntoilettes to be found in the crowded throng. A whole head and\r\nshoulders above Mrs. Evarts stood Mrs. Secretary Sherman--one of\r\nthose creations which can be compared to the lilies of the field\r\nin purity of style and stately grace--occupying the middle ground\r\nbetween blonde and brunette, her tawny hair, with its natural wave\r\ngathered in the low, Greek coil, without comb or ornament of any\r\nkind. A simple black dress, relieved at the throat with illusion\r\nruchings, she seemed the personified embodiment of one of Tennyson’s\r\npoems:\r\n\r\n      “Tall and divinely fair.”\r\n\r\nNot a beautiful woman, but one created with so much harmony that\r\nthe whole mortal statue would have to be pulled apart to remedy\r\nthe defect. Mrs. Sherman would make a most admirable “first\r\nlady”--the very best of all the candidates now in the field--for\r\nin all the years of her husband’s official life at the capital her\r\nunostentatious charity, her kindly deeds to the worthy and deserving,\r\nhave enshrined her as a patron saint in many a widow’s heart.\r\n\r\nImagine an English duchess who has inherited the rare beauty which\r\ndescends with hereditary rank. Why are the English nobility the\r\nfinest specimens of personal beauty? It is because its members leave\r\nnothing undone to perfect the physical proportions of the race. Of\r\nEnglish origin, Mrs. Ramsey brings to the Cabinet any amount of that\r\nmaterial which this administration lacked most. It has already been\r\nwhispered by those who ought to know that Governor Ramsey was not\r\ncalled to the war office because of his bloody record, but it was\r\nmade necessary by the deficiency in the social Cabinet, for while\r\na large number of these society leaders were equal to handshaking,\r\nthey were not quite strong enough to prevent masculine yawns between\r\nthe courses at official dinners. The coming of Mrs. Ramsey into the\r\nfield, even at this late day, if it does not win the battle, will\r\nat least prevent a complete rout. Mrs. Ramsey’s long residence at\r\nthe capital, her superior intelligence and winning ways, is doing\r\nmuch to retard the criticism which ended with the retirement of her\r\npredecessor, for it is openly declared that Secretary McCrary was\r\nhocus-pocused into a “jedge” because “Mrs. Hayes could stand it no\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nNext to Mrs. Ramsey stood Mrs. Postmaster-General Key, who, in the\r\nlanguage of the Emperor Napoleon, would be pronounced the greatest\r\nwoman, as he told Madame de Stael “it is she who has the largest\r\nnumber of children.” And yet Mrs. Key is robbed of her laurels, for\r\nwhile she has only ten olive branches, Mrs. Evarts has eleven, or\r\ndid have when the Hon. William M. Evarts became Secretary of State.\r\nMrs. Key is large and substantial-looking, without any particular\r\ngenius in the style of dress, as her trying gown of red waist and\r\nyellow sleeves sufficiently proved. It is only youth and beauty\r\nthat can wear theatrical costumes with becoming effect, but when a\r\nmiddle-aged woman can be found to take the risk her courage should be\r\napplauded and her wounds artistically dressed.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Mrs. Key stood Miss Agatha Schurz, the eldest daughter\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior, rather more than pleasing in form\r\nand feature, but entirely destitute of that indescribable something\r\nwhich makes her father one of the historical characters of his time.\r\nThe youthful girl who stood by the side of Miss Schurz might have\r\nbeen the niece of Attorney-General Devens, but as there is no proof\r\non this point the subject is omitted.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Grant who first invited other ladies to receive with\r\nher, and in those primitive days it was often the wives of the army\r\nofficers. Mrs. General Babcock was almost always at her side. Mrs.\r\nGrant was very “near-sighted,” and Mrs. Babcock had the faculty of\r\nrelieving any embarrassment which might come from this misfortune.\r\nLadies whose husbands had never been in public life, except in\r\nthe different professions, were seen by the side of Mrs. Grant or\r\nartistically grouped a little way off. The receptions of Mrs. Grant\r\nreminded the beholder of the picture of “Eugenie and her maids in\r\nwaiting.” True, Mrs. Grant did not possess the beauty of the charming\r\nSpaniard, but her “suite” would compare favorably in dignity, beauty,\r\nand grace with the same number of women found near any throne in\r\nEurope. Mrs. Grant grouped her assistants as exquisite flowers of\r\ndifferent color and perfume are gathered in a bouquet, making a\r\ntableau worth spreading on canvas. Mrs. Hayes stretches a straight\r\nline, that reminds one of a Bible class in a Methodist meeting, or\r\nwould if it were not for the Pompadour corsage and canary-colored\r\nsleeves, and yet all this is permissible in the strictly fashionable\r\nchurches of the day.\r\n\r\nIs “society” improving at the capital? Alas, no! There are no social\r\ncentres where gifted men and accomplished women meet to exchange\r\noriginal ideas. A few literary societies flourish, where a few\r\nfriends gather to listen to some worn-out “theme” and bitterly\r\ncomplain of being “bored” afterwards. The brilliant men like\r\nWebster, Clay and Calhoun, Ben Wade and Thad Stevens have no genuine\r\nsuccessors. Why? Because politics takes the place of statesmanship,\r\nand our public men have to work so hard to keep their heads above the\r\nmuddy pool there is no time to gather and disseminate the rich fruit\r\nof thought, consequently there is a short crop and the inevitable\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICE-PRESIDENT ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nHOW HE WIELDS THE GAVEL OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 1, 1880_.\r\n\r\nIt is a day of indescribable excitement in the Senate, vividly\r\nrecalling the stormy times of secession, Andy Johnson’s impeachment,\r\nor the famous Electoral Commission. Standing-room on the floor or in\r\nthe galleries can nowhere be found. Even the vast lobbies are crowded\r\nwith a struggling mass of humanity, such as rarely gathers in the\r\nnational temple which glorifies Capitol Hill. A face new and strange\r\nto the Washington public surveys the throng from the Vice-President’s\r\nchair and taps with uncertain hand the official gavel. The private\r\nsecretary of the late Vice-President stands at his left to prompt him\r\nas to the names of the Senators he is to recognize, for as yet he has\r\nnot had time to become familiar with their features or names. At his\r\nright may be seen one of the trusty clerks of the Senate to make sure\r\nthat no official commission or omission shall follow. It is apparent\r\nto all that only experience is necessary to make Vice-President\r\nArthur a model presiding officer. Except a little perplexity, there\r\nis the ease and grace of a man instead of the noiseless machinery\r\nwhich constitutes a well-preserved fossil. What the yellow, juicy,\r\nrosy-checked peach, with the fur rubbed off, jolting to market, is to\r\nthe vegetable world, Vice-President Arthur sustains the same relation\r\nto the fruit of humanity. There is something about his presence\r\nsuggestive of strawberries and cream, and yet this fact seems to be\r\ncompletely ignored by the Senate, for the turbulence goes on just the\r\nsame. He sits in an attitude of grace worthy the painter’s brush or\r\nthe pen of the poet. Fully six feet in height, broad-shouldered, but\r\nrounded and smoothed into curved lines which not only rival but excel\r\nthose of Cupid. A cold, haughty face is often seen, but warm, proud\r\nfeatures are rarely found; but here we have the exception. A high\r\nforehead towers above the brown velvety eyes; a nose a little too\r\nshort for classic perfection; but a firm, manly mouth, with plenty of\r\ndecision stamped on it, with a width of jaw that means business in\r\nany work it undertakes. Never since the days of Breckinridge has so\r\nhandsome a man wielded the Vice-President’s gavel, and whilst this\r\nfact may have no significance in a political sense, in a social way\r\nthere is no estimating the heights to which it may aspire or depths\r\nwhere it may be cast down. It is a great comfort to be able to rest\r\nthe vision on a diamond that has few, if any, flaws, and these not\r\nperceptible except to the finest judges of the gems.\r\n\r\nIn a direct line, exactly opposite the Vice-President, may be seen\r\nSenator Conkling, more winning in personal appearance than of yore.\r\nThe gorgeous tints or high colors of early manhood have been toned\r\ndown, softened, and spiritualized. Tranquillity is pictured on the\r\nbosom of the river, but we all know the channel is running at the\r\nsame rate per minute and no time will be lost in its motion toward\r\nthe sea. Stronger than most men, stronger than women, it is the\r\ninexorable law that the larger absorbs the smaller quantity. The kids\r\nthat would not be eaten must keep out of the way. He glances now\r\nand then at Mahone, who sits only three chairs away, as a spoiled\r\nchild might at “puss in boots,” whilst this little man, apparently\r\nall hair and claws, helps carry out the perfect illusion. Let us\r\nlook at this “balance of power,” as the other Confederate brigadiers\r\npolitely call him. At the first glance it seems altogether probable\r\nthat the hair has been snatched off seven-tenths of the Senate to\r\ncrown this one small man. His beard in length and density might be\r\nmistaken for that of the Wandering Jew. He has obtained the clothes\r\nof a much larger man, and they constitute a series of wrinkles from\r\nshoulders to heels. He does not inspire the beholder that he is a\r\nfraction of humanity, but that he is an uncanny contrivance, which,\r\nif not opened with the greatest caution, will work irreparable damage\r\nto those nearest concerned. There is neither joy nor comfort on the\r\nface of the Republicans as they survey this new addition to their\r\nranks, while there is calm submission, if not positive elation, on\r\nthe Democratic side at the situation.\r\n\r\nDon Cameron appears weary, as if tired with it all. A man must have a\r\npeculiar organization to thrive in the Senatorial atmosphere. It is a\r\ngladiator’s ring, where intellectual combat is the order of the day.\r\nWoe to him that is not endowed with weapons of the keenest and most\r\npolished kind. Though a Senator can pipe his slogan on a thousand\r\nhills at home and carries a bonanza mine in each pocket, it will not\r\nadd a feather to his Senatorial strength. Men endowed with business\r\ntalent, even of the highest order, can find neither congenial nor\r\nagreeable work in the Senate. Only a natural orator or debater like\r\nBlaine or a great lawyer like Edmunds find their native element in\r\nthe stormy waters of the Senate; and even Blaine was far more at home\r\nin the other wing of the Capitol, where his talents at all times\r\nshone as a star of the first magnitude. It is no sign of the lack of\r\nability because a Senator does not rank high, but rather a lack of\r\nthe peculiar and exceedingly rare qualities which make Senatorial\r\nsuccess secure.\r\n\r\nOf the new Senators Pennsylvania must be awarded the prize in point\r\nof beauty, for Senator Mitchell bears away the palm without a\r\ndissenting voice. In the grounds of one of the nabobs at Saratoga\r\nthere may be seen the statue of a Roman gladiator, such as lived in\r\nthe times of Nero. It is “stalwart” to the last degree. Imagine the\r\nold statue Americanized--that is, toned down in its roughest corners,\r\nsmoothed away--a little less muscle, a little more nerve, daintier,\r\nwith a dash of Greek symmetry, and you see the handsome Mitchell of\r\nPennsylvania. His hair is abundant, his eyes a twinkling hazel that\r\nrise and set with the arrival and departure of the dry goods in the\r\ngallery, but with a modesty that is simply indescribable.\r\n\r\nConger, dear old Conger, is here, cooled down to the polite frigidity\r\nwhich constantly pervades the Senate. He wears a white choker of such\r\nelevated height that it grinds away at his ears in the same way that\r\na horrid glacier wears away the face of the mountain. A new suit of\r\nthe finest broadcloth, of satin sheen, conceals limbs of the Adonis\r\nkind, though this last statement is more a matter of faith than\r\nactual proof. That “horn” which the wicked Stilson Hutchins was so\r\nfond of attacking with cruel squibs in the Washington _Post_ appears\r\nto have gone where the woodbine creepeth, for it is heard of no more.\r\nIt is rumored in private circles at the Capitol that Senator Conger\r\nis one of the most romantic and sentimental of men, and Governor\r\nFoster declares that it is the only case on Congressional record\r\nwhere a man is known to be madly infatuated with his own wife. When\r\nMrs. Conger would enter the gallery of the House it was immediately\r\nknown that Mr. Conger would soon attract all eyes by his graceful\r\nmotions and mellow “horn.” Some wretch of a Congressman would call\r\nout: “Now, boys, we are in for it,” and there have been seen no such\r\nscenes of suffering chivalry since Don Quixote attacked the windmills\r\nin behalf of his beloved Dulcinea. But far be it from the head and\r\nheart of the writer to mock at this pure and exalted flame. Rather\r\nlet us stand in the presence of this man with uncovered head who\r\nbrings to our aching vision a new Garden of Eden, when Adam was good\r\nbecause there was but one Eve, and the serpent did the mischief.\r\n\r\nIn the gallery assigned the families of the Republican Senators sits\r\nKatharine Chase Sprague--cold, stately, and statuesque as a lily,\r\nor a bit of marble in human form. The heavily fringed waxen lids\r\nfall over the sorrowful eyes--those large, dark almond orbs, such\r\nas glorify the Orient. There are faces all around, but she seems as\r\nmuch alone as Cleopatra in her barge floating down the dusky Nile. A\r\nblue turban with a single bird’s wing for an ornament sits jauntily\r\non her auburn hair; not out of place, because youth, beauty, and\r\nsweetness still linger in form and face. There is not the slightest\r\nattempt at display in her simple toilet--a dark dress, severe in its\r\nsimplicity, a scarf of scarlet silk folded gracefully around her\r\nthroat. She has given no thought to her personal appearance, but has\r\ncome evidently to observe the intellectual combat which has drawn\r\ntogether so large a percentage of the citizens of Washington. The\r\nwriter recalls the impeachment trial of Andy Johnson when “society”\r\nappeared in the Senate galleries and when Katharine Chase Sprague\r\nwas the acknowledged queen. Her toilet is recalled for the readers\r\nof _The Press_, and to-day it may be found recorded in the old files\r\nof this paper, for the writer was one of the “staff correspondents”\r\nat the time, whose duty it was to make “pen pictures” of the\r\nday. A Parisian suit of royal purple velvet, perfect in all its\r\nappointments. The detail escapes our memory, but the bonnet never\r\nwill. It was made in Paris to accompany the suit, and when placed\r\non her head it conveyed the idea of a single Marguerite. Imagine a\r\npurple violet large enough to be placed on the head, the leaves bent\r\nin bonnet shape. At the time the writer felt that her eyes rested\r\nupon the most graceful, distinguished, and queenly woman that she had\r\never seen in the Capitol or elsewhere on the face of the globe. The\r\nwriter has no personal acquaintance with Mrs. Sprague, but described\r\nher then, as she does to-day, as she would a picture or a poem. When\r\nit was published in the newspapers that she was engaged during the\r\nSenate session sending notes to a Senator on the floor the writer sat\r\nin the gallery, but saw no notes given to a page or delivered on\r\nthe floor. Year after year the writer has noticed this accomplished\r\nwoman sitting in the gallery from time to time, apparently deeply\r\ninterested in the debates, without the slightest levity or the\r\nsmallest departure from the most rigid decorum. In later years she\r\nis rarely seen without one or more of her children. History is full\r\nof martyred women who have been used to crush obnoxious men. When\r\nKatharine Chase Sprague was the daughter of the Chief Justice and the\r\nwife of a United States Senator she appeared in the social heavens\r\nwith the calmness and precision of a fixed star. Sunshine friends\r\nhave deserted her, but the star does not waver in its course. It\r\nis the same haughty Katharine, despoiled of her throne, as true a\r\nwoman to-day as when surrounded by her fawning flatterers. It is the\r\nflatterers of the Tuileries that have changed, and not the Empress\r\nEugenie.\r\n\r\nOutside the Senatorial circle of chairs may be noticed “a sea of\r\nupturned faces.” A dash of bronze reflects the last representation\r\nof African blood on the floor of the United States Senate. In the\r\nDarwinian political aggression the weaker must give way to the\r\nsurvival of the fittest, and the feebler race will be heard no more.\r\nAmong the dusky faces in the “men’s gallery” may be seen Pinchback of\r\nLouisiana, excluded from the floor where Patterson of South Carolina\r\nstands. Pinchback tried to obtain a position with other distinguished\r\nmen on the floor, but was remanded to the gallery among the scores\r\nof black men that compose the dark cloud that is always to be seen\r\nsou’west just above the Senators’ heads. It angered him beyond\r\nconception. Fierce passion flamed on his burning cheek and darted in\r\nlightning glances from his keen black eyes. Could he have invoked\r\nthe power to turn himself into a huge stiletto he would have buried\r\nhimself to the hilt in the Senate breast. Oh! the blessed relief of\r\nresponsibility! His Creator made him, endowed him with the elements\r\nof fearful wrath, subjected him to scorn, because his white soul\r\nis wrapped up in a yellow covering! Peace, be still, sorely tried\r\nand beloved brother, in whose veins mingle the blood of the haughty\r\nAnglo-Saxon with that of another race. The body perishes, but the\r\nsoul circles on forever and forever.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATE CHASE SPRAGUE.\r\n\r\nA DINNER WITH THE QUEEN OF AMERICAN ARISTOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _April 15, 1880_.\r\n\r\nDuring the penitence of Lent, and all the succeeding time which\r\nCongress honors the capital with its presence, society of the\r\nfashionable form assumes a bleached or faded appearance. In a great\r\nmeasure this is brought about by the absence of the swallow-tail\r\nand white-necktie element. The assemblings are largely feminine, of\r\nnecessity, from the fact that Congress, about to depart, is wholly\r\nengrossed with its “unfinished business.” So the courtly dinner of\r\nstate and the official reception is superseded by the aristocratic\r\nlunch and “high teas.” At these purely exclusive gatherings may\r\noccasionally be found musty old relics of the Army and Navy on the\r\nretired list, whose records and shoulderstraps are fast perishing\r\nwith official mildew and dry rot; or perhaps a supreme or district\r\njudge, for enough of this masculine seasoning should be found at\r\nleast to flavor the social pot. But it frequently happens these\r\nlunches are attended by women alone, the hostess intending to bring\r\ntogether only those who are supposed to be agreeable to each other,\r\nat least so far as it is possible to bring these repellent atoms\r\ninto a compact mass, and oh! how delightful! Our ancestors used to\r\ncall the same kind of meetings “schools for scandal,” for no two or\r\nmore women ever did come together beyond the hearing of masculine\r\nears without by the merest accident a secret would be told; and in\r\nWashington, where every spot is sacred to the death of some poor\r\nsecret, it is unnecessary to follow this delicate subject to an\r\nignominious end.\r\n\r\nAll the readers of the _Journal_ are invited in fancy to a high-toned\r\nlunch at Mrs. Kate Chase Sprague’s, at her beautiful home in the\r\nWest End. Mrs. Sprague has said to the correspondents that she has\r\nno objection to newspaper comment if it treats her justly and in\r\nthe spirit of courtesy; so her lunch is described for not only the\r\nabove reason, but because no woman in Washington excels her as lady\r\n“to the manner born,” or can surpass her in those graces which make\r\nher the reigning queen in her own home. If fortune has deserted her\r\nin a great measure, all the unique, costly, and superb trappings\r\nare here. A few terrapin, a few bottles of champagne are all that\r\nis necessary to bring the old millionaire days back, unless it be\r\nthe presence of the young war governor of Rhode Island (God bless\r\nhim). We shall never forget the day that he came to the capital,\r\ndusty and travel-worn, with his thousand men which he had equipped\r\nand brought to President Lincoln in person. The capital was cut off\r\nfrom the North by both railroad and telegraph, and the rebel hosts\r\nwere gathering in Alexandria, as we thought, to burn and sack the\r\ncity. Governor Sprague did not go to a hotel, but camped in the\r\nmarket-place with his men. The first time the writer saw Governor\r\nSprague he was drinking water from a tincup and eating baker’s bread\r\nand cold meat with his regiment; and, when we realized that this\r\nroyal prince of finance was willing to sleep on the ground and drink\r\nfrom the tincup to preserve the Union, an adoration was born which\r\nneither time nor misfortune can chill.\r\n\r\nBut, coming out from the sanctuary of sacred memories to the\r\nlunch, for, after all, it is with to-day we must deal, for the\r\npast is just as remote as the future. It is 12 o’clock, high noon.\r\nAn elegant table may be seen in the center of one of the most\r\nperfect dining-rooms at the national capital. There is much in the\r\nsurroundings to recall to the cultured mind thoughts of the royal\r\nas well as republican days of sunny France. Some ancient Gobelin\r\ntapestry, handed down from the palace when it was occupied by Queen\r\nMarie Antoinette, is suspended from the walls, whose threads may yet\r\nhold her imprisoned sighs. Beautiful screens, works of highest art,\r\nextend or shorten the space according to the caprice of the fair\r\nmistress. Exquisite paintings adorn the wall; elaborate service of\r\nsilver and gold ornament the sideboard; a Parisian clock measures the\r\ntime in musical chimes; Persian rugs conceal the polished, inlaid\r\nfloor. Without exception it is the daintiest spot to partake of an\r\ninnocent bowl of crackers and milk to be found in all Washington.\r\nUpon the table is first laid a thick heavy cloth, made expressly\r\nfor the purpose to deaden all sound in case a knife or spoon meet\r\nan accident; though a dozen forks should fall they would not be\r\nheard except for their own dashing. The sound-cloth is now covered\r\nby Irish damask, soft and sheeny as satin; and around it clusters\r\neight perfect chairs. These seats are chosen for ease quite as much\r\nas beauty, because the sitting will last all the way from three to\r\neight hours. Flowers alone occupy the center of the table, and these\r\nare so artistically arranged that each guest is visible to every\r\nother. On the table before each chair may be seen two knives of\r\ndifferent sizes, and a pair of forks, dessert and teaspoons, sherry\r\nand champagne glasses, and a thimble-sized gold salt cellar. An\r\nelaborate castor, on the sideboard, furnishes pepper, celery-flour\r\nand all other condiments; but these are served in good time, at the\r\nexact moment wanted, by the white-gloved, machine-like Ethiopian, who\r\nunderstands a glance from the Princess’s eye and does not have to be\r\nregulated by means of the English language.\r\n\r\nThe mistress leads the way and takes her stand at the head of the\r\ntable, with her ebony assistant at her right. The guest who is to sit\r\nin the most honored place is called and seated by the waiter, the\r\nnext place is filled in the same way, and this is continued until the\r\ncircle is completed. This consumes but a few moments of time, the\r\nright people are brought side by side, and in such a way as to prove\r\nthe remarkable tact of the fair hostess, and all confusion has been\r\navoided. After all, this lunch turns out to be a dinner in disguise,\r\nfor the first course consists of French bouillon, which is only a\r\nvery rich and nutritious beef tea. The Hoosier housewife who is bold\r\nand aggressive enough to attempt a Kate Chase Sprague lunch must look\r\nout that no fat swims on the top of the bouillon, for the fat had\r\nmuch better be in the fire, as its presence indicates plebeianism.\r\nNothing can be found too handsome and costly in which to serve this\r\nbeef tea. If there are no golden bowls in the house, the next best\r\nare such as are found in the Sprague mansion. These wonderful gems\r\nhave been brought on the backs of mules over the Ural mountains from\r\nthe heart of Persia. It is declared by some that these bowls are\r\nmade of the dust of broken garnets, gathered by the emerald hunters\r\nwhen they are in quest of gems in the great Himalaya range. They are\r\nmanufactured expressly for the palace of the Shah; but during the\r\ngreenback regency a few found their way to the table of an exalted\r\nofficial, and in this way have become heirlooms in a distinguished\r\nfamily. These Persian bowls have never been insulted by coming in\r\ncontact with beans, or even Potomac oysters. Only clover-fed beeves,\r\nof the amiable short-horn variety, slaughtered on the Jewish plan,\r\nand treated by a skillful French cook, are permitted to be introduced\r\nto these jeweled caskets. During the sipping of this delectable stew,\r\nwhich must be as noiseless as a cat licks cream, the Shah of Persia,\r\nhis advent as a literary character, his strong points of wickedness\r\nas a man are discussed, as well as the mineral and vegetable\r\npossibilities of the venerable but distant kingdom. Even old Haroun\r\nAl Raschid and his disguises come in. No chance for the conversation\r\nto languish whilst the Persian bowls are on the table. The bouillon\r\nis kindly assisted by different kinds of dainty crackers, “Havenner’s\r\ncream” being the favorite, with French bread. But one must be very\r\ncareful, whilst toying with the spoon, not to sip too much beef tea,\r\nelse the space which might be filled with more eatable matter is all\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\nThe Persian bowls are gone! Ah! who would believe it? one-half\r\nhour--or as long as it takes a Buckeye or Hoosier to eat an average\r\ndinner. So the next course is hurried on. This consists of oyster\r\npatties, served on plates, each one different, each a hand-painted\r\nportrait by a skillful French artist, and manufactured at the\r\nSèvres porcelain works, near Paris. All are costly enough to hang\r\nas pictures and works of art on the wall. A commonplace Washington\r\nsociety woman is eating her pattie from the honored head of dear old\r\nLafayette. Another scans the face of Napoleon I, and finds a striking\r\nresemblance to Congressman Blinks, from the Michigan district, if\r\nhe would only clear out the brush of his whiskers and mow down the\r\ntall grass of his moustache. Sherry, clear as limpid amber and\r\ncolored like a meerschaum pipe, has kept company all the time with\r\nthe Persian bowl as well as the medallion plates. These plates were\r\npurchased from one of the sales of royal pottery brought about by the\r\ndecay of a branch of one of the reigning families of the old world.\r\n\r\nThe next course of sweet breads is brought in on plates designed\r\nby the hostess as a present to the late Chief Justice of the\r\nUnited States--a love offering from a most devoted daughter to\r\nan illustrious sire. It was made without regard to cost, at the\r\ncelebrated pottery near Paris, at the same time and place a set was\r\nbeing made for the Prince of Wales. No two plates are alike, but\r\neach one is embellished with a gorgeous bouquet. The violet and\r\nearly gentian, the sweet but humble wild flowers trodden under foot\r\nin the hoyden days of girlhood, away off in the old Ohio home, have\r\nbeen caught and stamped in this imperishable form from the idolator\r\nto the idol. What pictures of the old home-life are called up like\r\nfast-dissolving phantoms, but as genuine creations in the invisible\r\nworld as the exquisite works of art before the mortal vision. The\r\nwhite, waxen eye-lid of the fair hostess droops until the long silken\r\nfringe sweeps the cheek. The spirit of hush! be quiet, falls upon\r\nthe guest, which the hostess alone knows how to remove. The gulf is\r\nvisible, like a hideous skull at a feast, between the days of the\r\nyoung millionaire wife, designing gifts for the Chief Justice, and\r\nthe cold bereavements and change of fickle fortune of to-day.\r\n\r\nBegone, dull care, with the sweet-bread course! Thy sweetness is\r\nbitter and unsavory! The first of the season! Virginia mountain lamb\r\nwith green peas from Florida. The mountain lamb is served on another\r\n“work of art,” all different, no two plates alike, and this one is\r\npictured with a single flower. It is a royal pink just culled from\r\nthe parent stem and thrown carelessly down. One feels like picking\r\nit up just for one sniff at the perfume before it is smothered in\r\nSouthern peas. Now comes champagne, clear and beaded, resembling\r\nthe fluid in all probability in which Cleopatra dissolved the\r\npearls. A course now follows which is a cross between a custard and\r\ncharlotte russe--an infinitesimal ocean of cream between banks of\r\nsnowy paste. After this more meat, vegetables, salads on different\r\nbits of porcelain with a history, until the ices and fruits are\r\nreached. These are served on daintiest of majolica ware or odd bits\r\nof crockery, fished from all the uncanny quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\nOnly think of being pinned to one spot from three to eight hours,\r\nforced to be civil and polite at least, if not working for the title\r\nof “agreeable diner-out.” Oh, for the blessed privilege, if one must\r\nbe so tortured, to get as uproariously drunk as did the great Daniel\r\nWebster, with the privilege of rolling under the table like him to\r\nsnore it off. All the nations of the earth who have spent hours\r\neating and guzzling at table have come to that point where decline\r\nbegins. England’s roast beef and ale, and sensual time at the table\r\nhas culminated in Ireland’s horrors and Beaconsfield’s fall. The\r\nPresident’s salary was doubled on account of these dyspeptic state\r\ndinners. Congress should at once make a law placing the social\r\nexpectations of official life on precisely the same basis as that\r\nof the private citizen. This is a Republic. We employ our officials\r\nto do certain work for which we pay them. They should be made to\r\nunderstand they are servants, and not masters.\r\n\r\nA large lobby is engaged to get Congress to build a new White House,\r\nbecause the present one is not large enough “to entertain.” Could we\r\nbuild a house large enough for this purpose, for why should the few\r\nbe invited and the great mass of voters left out in the cold? Each\r\nState is asked to build houses and furnish them for their Senators\r\nin order that these gentlemen may “entertain.” Who will pay for the\r\noyster patties, the porcelain and champagne when the great new White\r\nHouse dots Meridian Hill, and the States enter into competition for\r\nthe grandeur of the Senatorial castle? The human body should be\r\ncared for because it is the finest created physical object to be\r\nseen by the light of the blessed sun, besides being a receptacle of\r\nthe different sizes of soul as they come imported; but, as a nation,\r\nwe should not permit in the care of this mortal mould that kind of\r\nlegislation which begins in spider webs and ends in chains.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucy Hayes moved into the White House she tried hard to reform\r\nthe precedents, but Secretary Evarts was too much for her. He painted\r\nthe Russian bear howling because the minister from that barbarous\r\nfrozen land might, without wine, get a cake of ice in his stomach,\r\nand then what would the Czar say? Prince Alexis came to Washington\r\nto attend the inauguration, walked up and down Pennsylvania avenue\r\nwith two bull pups at his side, because Secretary Evarts, or any\r\nother human being (except royalty), were thought not good enough\r\nto be there. Dogs were preferred to Secretary Evarts; but it may\r\nbe possible that Alexis could put the proper estimate on the State\r\nDepartment, and at the same time do justice to the bull pups.\r\nThe American people should not feel aggrieved, or pull a single\r\nfeather from the tail of the national eagle because the government\r\nat Washington has been fearfully “snubbed.” When the Prince of\r\nWales was in this country he planted a tree at Mount Vernon, and\r\nwas as sorrowful as Mark Twain at the tomb of Adam; but Alexis\r\ncame over and gave us a taste of the genuine Romanoff flavor. But\r\nthis could be borne, because we could have called out the Army and\r\nNavy and charged on the bull pups, but instead of managing in this\r\nway, Secretary Evarts took possession of the kitchen of the White\r\nHouse, forced Lucy Hayes to stultify her convictions, and instead\r\nof making the Executive Mansion the reflection of the purity and\r\nwisdom of a Christian, sensible, high-toned woman, he brought the\r\nwornout bestiality of monarchical Europe as represented by its agents\r\nhere, and made our administration conform to it. Is it a wonder the\r\nbull pups take precedence? Nations, like individuals, must respect\r\nthemselves. When another good woman like Lucy Webb Hayes, united to\r\na great one, such as Queen Elizabeth or Empress Catherine, finds\r\nherself wife of the President of the United States, our impotent\r\nand costly plenipotentiary foreign missions will be abolished.\r\nEstablished as long ago as feudalism was in its cradle, when it was\r\nnecessary to have spies in every court of Europe to bolster up each\r\ndespotic dynasty, what sympathy, or how can a Republic consistently\r\napprove such positions?\r\n\r\nLet us have a sprinkling of honest commercial consuls wherever\r\nthey are needed on the earth’s surface; pay them a generous living\r\nsalary, and the instant they are found coquetting with “fees,” cut\r\noff their official heads. The Augean stables cleaned by Hercules\r\nneeded purification no more than our white-gloved, daintily-perfumed\r\nState Department. When it is remembered that the handful of men sent\r\nout from their respective governments to attend to business, who\r\nare dignified with the sounding title “foreign legations,” are only\r\npolite to our officials, but “snub” all the sovereign people, are\r\nthe ones who, while they sneer at us, set all our fashions, dictate\r\nour manners, steal our rich American girls, and, through Secretary\r\nEvarts, order champagne at the White House. This would be unbearable\r\nexcept for the bull pups that were imported to supersede Secretary\r\nEvarts. This proves that every cloud hath a silver lining; for the\r\npups were as white as the glistening ice of the Neva.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal_ comes now regular; I am very much pleased with it.\r\nIt is what I call a live paper. Hon. Edward McPherson, late of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_, was at my house the other evening, and he said\r\nit was the best paper published in the West. I was very glad to hear\r\nhim say so, because he has excellent judgment, and it is a great\r\nhonor to be connected with an able newspaper.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLACK OF A LEADER.\r\n\r\nSOCIETY WITHOUT A RULING SPIRIT TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _February 18, 1881_.\r\n\r\nIt takes the most exquisite kind of courage to paint truthful views\r\nof life as it is pictured on the social boards at Washington. If\r\nthe well-known society writers would furnish the newspapers with\r\nfaithful kaleidoscopes of the “day’s doings” they would be banished\r\nor, like Othello, they would “find their occupation gone.” It is the\r\nsmall sins of “high life” which weaken the constitution of society;\r\nlack of moral courage, love of finery, gilt and glitter, envy and\r\njealousy, and the enjoyment of slander. When the most beautiful and\r\naccomplished leader at the capital became the shining mark at which\r\nthe quivering arrows of condemnation were hurled, have any of the\r\nwomen who used to bask in the sunshine of her queenly hospitality\r\nsaid one word in her defense? One would suppose that after years\r\nof smiling and caressing this monster of society, after lavishing\r\ntens of thousands of dollars upon it, one brave, strong utterance,\r\none loving word might come back in return. Where are the women\r\nwho have smirked and basked in the shadows of the dead and dying\r\nadministrations? What niche will their minds fill in history? We have\r\nrailroad kings and bonanza emperors and money grabbers in place of\r\nstatesmen, by the score; but where are the drawing rooms such as Lady\r\nBlessington’s, or the famous salon of Madame de Stael, which has an\r\nexistence to-day far more substantial than the daily receptions at\r\nthe capital. Instead of cultivating their minds the “society women”\r\nat Washington are expending the last show of vitality in the adorning\r\nof their bodies. Flitting from one “palatial mansion” to another,\r\nfrom “sunny morn to dewy eve,” these human butterflies make no more\r\nimpression on the world at large than the moths which they so much\r\nresemble. Whilst as a general rule the society women have politicians\r\nfor husbands, it does not always follow that all the politicians have\r\n“society” wives. Such accomplished women as Mrs. George F. Edmunds,\r\nof Vermont, or Mrs. Thomas F. Bayard, of Delaware, will always be\r\nfound, and, like the men at the pumps, will keep the old worm-eaten\r\nhulk of Washington society from going to the bottom.\r\n\r\nSince the retirement of the superb Katharine Chase Sprague “society,”\r\nin a blundering way, manages to get along without an acknowledged\r\n“head.” If the beautiful and accomplished woman is found, the immense\r\nwealth is lacking, for no woman can be a successful “leader” unless\r\nshe has beauty, brains, and money. To a great extent beauty can be\r\nspared, because its loss can be made up by the artistic skill which\r\nthe brain power will utilize. Just as a general must have the sinews\r\nof war to carry on a vigorous campaign, a society leader must be\r\nthoroughly equipped, for if the means to accomplish a certain result\r\nare somewhat different the end amounts to just about the same. The\r\ncoming of the bonanza wives is watched with the most intense anxiety.\r\nThe question is asked: “Has she the qualities to command or will\r\ninefficiency and cowardice consign her to the ranks?” A member of\r\nCongress was regretting his inability to be present at the Art Club\r\nreception. He said he “had reason to believe that in such an assembly\r\nhe could find a relief or change from the political treadmill where\r\nhe was forced to be at his post every day.” When his attention was\r\ncalled to the stately card receptions of almost every night, he\r\nreplied: “I hate them; there is nothing there but clothes.” These\r\nwere the words from no brain-distorted, dyspeptic Bostonian, but a\r\nWestern man, in the full sap of existence, who would naturally be\r\nsupposed to cling to the woman who could show the handsomest amount\r\nof shoulder to the square inch. Both General Garfield and Senator\r\nBlaine have declared that relief comes to the tired, over-worked\r\nbrain by changing the train of thought, and not by dabbling in\r\ninanity. This proves that the doll’s occupation is gone. The woman\r\nof the nineteenth century must shake from her dormant brain the dust\r\nof ages and develop her power in precisely the same ratio as man\r\nmakes the most of his. Almighty God has made the orbit of the sexes\r\nparallel, but they can never intersect.\r\n\r\nAll that which comes under the head of “formal ceremony” at the\r\ncapital, such as state dinners at the White House, are faithful\r\ncopies of foreign courts, or rather the tattered fragments of the\r\nmanners of old baronial time under William the Conqueror, when the\r\nfeudal chiefs were served first and their retainers were permitted\r\nto scramble on the floor for the bones. It is true the bones are\r\nnot thrown under the White House table, for the world grows neater\r\nin its old age; but should a President entertain Victoria at dinner\r\n“etiquette” or the spirit of the old barbarians declares the\r\nPresident must be helped first. Instead of the American gentleman\r\nat his own table, where the example of private life should be the\r\nmodel for the public manners of a Republic, we have just enough of\r\nthe old leaven of monarchy working that any child can smell the odor\r\nafter a short stay in Washington. Nothing more terrible socially can\r\nbe conceived than one of these cold, formal state dinners at the\r\nWhite House. It is not a company made up of breathing, living men\r\nand women, but is the masculine bones of the awful Department of\r\nState, with the feminine anatomy clutched for a brief hour from the\r\nhighest judicial ermine. It is the ponderous Treasury Department,\r\nwith its legs crossed under the Presidential mahogany. In preceding\r\nadministrations the victims were allowed to drown their sorrows in\r\nwine, and by the time the fifth or sixth course came ’round the War\r\nand Navy Departments were prepared for the most desperate action\r\non sea or shore. Only from twelve to nineteen inches table room is\r\nallowed a guest, and the steward of the White House, instead of the\r\ntailor, decides on the breadth of the anatomy. To the great credit of\r\nthe State of New York it has been found that Secretary Evarts could\r\nbe wedged in between a couple of Supreme Judges without diminishing\r\nthe size of the table in the least, but he refuses to be a third\r\nparty to this kind of an alliance, because there is no precedence of\r\nthe kind to be found in the archives of the State Department.\r\n\r\nThe size of the White House table is perfectly prodigious, and when\r\ncovered with the china dishes ordered by Mrs. Hayes the effect\r\nis paralyzing to sensitive nerves. No chance is given the poetic\r\nimagination to revel in ambrosial sips and taste the heavenly\r\nmanna. If your soul is soaring to empyrean heights, you are dragged\r\nearthward by seeing pictured on the plates the ugly refuse of the\r\ndainties with which you are supposed to be tickling your palate. When\r\none swallows an oyster, who wants to be reminded of the huge, ugly\r\nshell, a faint suggestion of a coffin? Who desires to see a shining,\r\nscaly fish, with its pink gills already to pulsate, and be made to\r\nremember that the fish died that you might roll one little sweet\r\nmorsel under your tongue? Who can bear to be reminded when tasting\r\na sweet, fresh new-laid egg, that looks as if it might have fallen\r\nfrom the sky, that an ungainly old hen scratching for worms was the\r\norigin of that egg? The pictures taken from the ruins of Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum may be more sensual, but in no sense can they be called\r\nmore earthly or barbaric. All things beautiful should be spiritually\r\nsuggestive. If the new White House china was the property of private\r\nlife incalculable mischief might be the result, but the crafty\r\nCabinet ministers and aged Supreme Judges have outlived delicate\r\nand lasting impressions, and after the first slight shock no serious\r\ntrouble will be apt to follow; but it would be well to let Lucretia\r\nGarfield know that if the “pitchers go to the well once too often”\r\nor a grand collision of plates and platters should take place, such\r\na calamity would be accepted by the nation like the late war--a sore\r\ntrial at the time but in the long run a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\nIf it takes so many scratches of the pen to get over the celebrated\r\nchina “designed by the highest artistic talent at home,” how shall\r\nwe manage to get the reader through the three hours that it takes\r\nto manage the great state gastronomic feast? It is best told in the\r\nlanguage of one of the guests:\r\n\r\n“I was led out by Secretary Evarts. I don’t think he would have\r\nselected me if he could have been allowed his choice. You have to go\r\nin the order of the Cabinet. Three hours so close to the great New\r\nYork criminal lawyer! I thought I should faint! I cast my eyes down\r\nthe table at my husband; he was below me on the other side of the\r\ntable and he looked ‘blue.’ I was just thinking what he could find\r\nto say to the strange women on each side of him, for he never talks\r\nto me, when I would be interrupted by one of Evarts’ questions that\r\nwould make me feel that I was on the witness stand. I can talk fast\r\nsometimes, but I felt if I spoke except to answer him it would be\r\nsure to be wrong, and I would disgrace the Cabinet. I managed to get\r\nthrough some way and afterwards found out that I was liable to be\r\ntaken into state dinners by Secretary Evarts as long as we were in\r\nthe Cabinet. I tried to prevail on my husband to resign, to which he\r\nagreed as soon as some other good place could be found for him.”\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet dinners are modeled on the same plan as the state\r\ndinners, and the misery endured is in proportion to its size and\r\nduration. The torture consequent upon the formal dinners made a hero\r\nand a place in history for dear old Sam Ward. Of course, his dinners\r\nwere as much above those of the White House as Sam exceeded the\r\nsteward in brilliancy of conception of dainty cuisine. Sam’s culinary\r\nreputation rests on a ham boiled with three red clover heads, and\r\nwhen put into the oven to “brown” it was treated to a baptism of\r\nchampagne. The three heads of red clover have been proved to be\r\na fraud. Nothing was ever served on Sam’s table that was half as\r\ndelicious as himself. He is familiar with nine different languages,\r\nthree of which he spoke with all the fluency of his mother tongue.\r\nHe has been seen to put his arm around a foreign minister with all\r\nthe grace and affection with which a lover embraces his sweetheart.\r\nIs it strange that this man became an idol to the public men whose\r\nconstitutions were impaired by the dyspeptic dinners of “high\r\nsociety?” Extremes meet, and overfeeding is far more disastrous in\r\nits remote results than a mild course of starvation. Sam Ward managed\r\nthat his guests should never be satiated. The oyster patties, like a\r\nlittle woman, would be so perfect, though small, that the next course\r\nwould be anxiously awaited. “Two dessert spoonfuls of soup with a\r\nthimbleful of choicest sherry, that is my foundation for a dinner,”\r\nsays the immortal Sam. Only people of ability were permitted to\r\ngather around his board, and it was the brilliant conversation more\r\nthan the viands that made it appear “a feast fit for the gods.” If a\r\ndinner was to be given to the Spanish minister the proper number of\r\nagreeable people who speak Spanish could always be found for a small\r\nparty. Could anything be more grateful to a stranger in a strange\r\nland than to hear his home language spoken by his host with the ease\r\nand fluency of a native; to have the conversation adroitly turned\r\nto the subjects which lie nearest to the Spanish heart; to drink\r\nthe blood of the grape brought all the way from Castile or Arragon?\r\nIs it a wonder with Sam’s arm around his diplomatic waist that he\r\nwould feel as did Mungo Park in Africa when he heard the negro woman\r\nsinging at the foot of the tree that sheltered him:\r\n\r\n      “No wife to catch him fish and grind him corn”?\r\n\r\nWhen one of the foreigners died it is said that he left Sam Ward\r\na fortune. If his cuisine was not always perfect the host himself\r\nmade up the imperfection. He had the power to throw his guests out\r\nof their shells and by this means adding any amount of heat to the\r\nsocial atmosphere. The last time Sam Ward was seen he was marching\r\nacross the Capitol Rotunda, his short, full arm around another man’s\r\nwaist, looking as much like a fat Philadelphia capon as Charlie\r\nO’Neill. His round, chubby, boyish face and duck legs bore not the\r\nslightest resemblance to the lobby. He is the brother of Julia Ward\r\nHowe, the author of the battle hymn of the Republic. The same kind\r\nof spiritual essence that enters this poem made the dinners famous,\r\nbut let no man attempt the same high art. The solitary vase has been\r\nbroken, but the odor is left and clings to it still.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEN HILL AND ROSCOE CONKLING.\r\n\r\nMANNERISMS OF THESE FAMOUS SENATORS AND A NUMBER OF THEIR COLLEAGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _May 14, 1881_.\r\n\r\nOver the great public squares is spread a royal carpet of greenest\r\nverdure. Miles and miles of trees occupying the city “parking” are\r\nflaunting their tender leaves in the dazzling sunshine; the fruit\r\ntrees are a mass of powdery blossom, whilst violets and lilacs fill\r\nthe market space with delicious perfume. The cold North blast has\r\nceased to blow, and from the sunny South comes the dallying wind,\r\nladen with the breath of magnolia and orange blossom; but a cloud\r\nwhich has no silver lining envelopes the National Capitol--lo! as\r\nan iron shroud. No precedent in history arises to permit us to\r\njudge the future by the past. Within the memory of the writer armed\r\nlegions with glittering bayonets slept upon the cushioned seats of\r\nthe Senate chamber, whilst the gallant Colonel Ellsworth, of Zouave\r\nfame, spread his soldier’s blanket on the floor. A war as bitter and\r\nunrelenting is being fought, but the cold sharp steel is invisible.\r\nIt is the same old fight which shook the Middle Ages from center to\r\ncircumference when the sovereign of millions threw down the gauntlet\r\nto his feudal chiefs. Senator Conkling could not have sustained his\r\nopposition to the President for a single day if the battle of New\r\nYork did not include every State in the Union. It was the charge\r\nof little Rhody on the “big N.” It was to decide whether the two\r\nstalwart Senators, like Anthony and Burnside, weighing more than\r\none hundred and eighty pounds each, were not able to look after the\r\npolitical welfare of a State so small that it almost requires a\r\nmicroscope to find it on the map. Conkling was the great general,\r\nstationed in the rear, planning the campaign. Men of the Dawes\r\ncalibre conduct active operations in the field. To amuse the public\r\nfiring is kept up between the Democrats and Republicans, but the real\r\nwar, which means death to one or the other of the combatants, is\r\nbetween the Senate and the White House.\r\n\r\nTo get a thorough understanding of the machine politician he must be\r\njudged entirely by his acts, as a personal acquaintance warps the\r\njudgment and destroys what might be a first-class opinion, because\r\nthe feelings are called into play. Beginning with the pages, who\r\nskip and flit like butterflies on the Senate floor, all unite in\r\nthe worship of Senator Conkling. He never has to clap his hands to\r\nbring a page, for the moment he begins work that would require the\r\nservice two or three of these lynx-eyed dots are at his elbow, all\r\nanxious for the honor to serve him. The writer asked a bright little\r\npage why the boys were so willing to do his bidding. He replied: “He\r\nnever said a cross word to a page in his life. He says: ‘My little\r\nman, will you do this kindness for me?’ Then we all run!” Just what\r\nthe sunshine is to the physical world this something which goes from\r\nevery man and woman in a greater or less degree is what acts upon\r\nhumanity. It is not love, because it is devoid of passion. It is a\r\nforce that cannot be estimated or measured and it is given to only a\r\nvery few in any age. The great Napoleon possessed it in the largest\r\ndegree of any man in modern times.\r\n\r\nA tall Texan comes from the “Lone Star” State and is seen in all\r\nthe prominent places in Washington. Once observed, he cannot be\r\nforgotten, for he is of giant proportions. Colossal is the word, for\r\nevery limb and feature has been adjusted to the proper scale, as if\r\ndesigned by Randolph Rogers or Vinnie Ream-Hoxie. Handsome is a word\r\nnot strong enough for justice, but is used because Richard Grant\r\nWhite or the Chicago _Tribune_ has invented nothing better. The\r\ntall Texan was prowling about the Capitol, and whether by accident\r\nor design, the writer knows not, the Texan and Senator came together\r\nin the dark shadows of the lobby which leads to the Marble Room. An\r\nintense, anxious expression lighted up the features of the Texan as\r\nhe neared the New York Senator. As they came in close contact Senator\r\nConkling raised his arm, placed his hand around the man’s waist and\r\nlifted it to the lofty shoulder, and whilst he drew the colossal\r\nfigure towards him looked up into his face and said, “You would not\r\nask me to do that.” No quiver of disappointment was visible. The two\r\npoliticians had met. Size had nothing to do with it. Matter went down\r\nbefore mind and the Darwinian theory was vindicated.\r\n\r\nNotable among the men who were prominent in the House are those who\r\nmigrated to the Senate wing and find themselves frozen stiff in\r\ntheir seats and motionless as so many dead flies. If by accident\r\ntheir bloodless lips are unsealed one day they only live to regret\r\nit the next. Conger, whose “horn” is in danger of being forgotten,\r\nsits glued to one spot and helps make an admirable picture for the\r\ngalleries. Daintiest of snowy linen covers a breast which is known to\r\nconceal the most ecstatic emotions, whilst the costliest broadcloth\r\nserves the purpose of drapery. All that he requires is the addition\r\nof spices to make him a mummy that would far eclipse those of\r\nEgyptian magic.\r\n\r\nDon Cameron sits in his seat, and if he were a woman he would be\r\ncalled “interesting.” In other words, he may be summed up as pale,\r\nsad, and extremely nervous. The iron crown which he inherited from\r\nhis tough old Highland father is too heavy for tender temples and\r\nweaker brain. The people of Pennsylvania can afford to bide their\r\ntime, for when the Winnebago Chief is gathered to his fathers\r\nCameronism is wiped off the face of the State as clean as though\r\nit were a wheatfield in the path of the tornado; but if the old\r\nKeystone is not represented by brains in the National Senate she has\r\nbeauty, and the poet sings, “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” It\r\nis not necessary for Senator Mitchell to make himself felt--he should\r\nbe seen, and then no fault can be found.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is like an immense cave and unless a man has an intellect\r\nlike a calcium light there is no chance for him; the tallow dips\r\nsputter for a moment, make themselves ridiculous, then go out in the\r\nicy gloom. Except for the warriors, both Union and Confederate, the\r\nlive element would be entirely wanting. The “Tall Sycamore of the\r\nWabash” will never let himself be forgotten, and he reminds one of an\r\noasis in the Senate desert--land of the delicious date and towering\r\npalm.\r\n\r\nMost winning, dearest to the heart of woman, are the Senate knights\r\nof the “lost cause.” There is a deference and courtly grace which\r\nthey bestow on the so-called weaker sex which the cold Northman may\r\ncounterfeit, but never succeed as an original. Whilst the men of\r\ncolder latitude approach woman as though she were made out of the\r\nsame kind of stuff as themselves, the Southerner makes her feel that\r\nshe stands on a higher mark in the ascending scale and that if she\r\nis not quite “winged” she is almost an angel. Even Hon. Ben Hill\r\ncan so deftly manage a woman that she cannot tell whether she is\r\nbeing pummeled or caressed, as our one solitary interview with this\r\nillustrious statesman will prove. In an article which was published\r\nsome months ago in _The Times_, when a pen picture was being painted\r\nof the lobby, a paragraph was inserted which said, “The queen paused\r\nin her triumphal march to speak with Senator Hill.” In vain the\r\nwriter pleaded that a Senator was not to blame because the “queen”\r\nhad seized him. He declared that he had been “maligned” for the\r\nreason that he avoided all women the day he made speeches, therefore\r\nit could not be true. Again the writer pleaded that he was no more to\r\nblame for his seizure by the queen of the lobby than a big sunflower\r\nwhen a bumblebee pitches into its heart. His head could not be\r\nreached by argument nor his heart by petition. He said the article\r\nhad been copied in a Georgia paper and used against him in the\r\ncampaign; at the same time he artlessly confessed his love for his\r\nwife and his loathing for the “queen of the lobby.” If that Georgia\r\neditor has a soul will he publish our heartfelt desire to cleanse\r\nany spot which we have unintentionally cast on the Senator’s record?\r\nThese Southern men are singularly clean-handed where so many fall.\r\nThey put the pure woman on a pedestal and worship her, and if there\r\nare any bad ones they are carried off to their lairs and devoured and\r\nnobody hears of them any more.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT GARFIELD’S CABINET DAY.\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF THE OFFICIAL FAMILY--A SOLDIER’S DISAPPOINTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _August 22, 1881_.\r\n\r\nA long residence in Washington proves the sad fact that “court life”\r\nat the capital of a Republic is precisely the same as in a monarchy,\r\nexcept in the change of its duration. As the time to accomplish\r\nresults is so very brief the odious process becomes more patent and\r\nless care is taken to hide all the art and skill practiced by the\r\nparasites who surround the Executive and who change his nature in\r\na very brief time unless, like “Old Hickory” or Abraham Lincoln,\r\nhe cannot be veneered by his surroundings because the identity is\r\ntoo strong. When a citizen enters the White House as the political\r\nhead of the nation he never hears another familiar word. From the\r\naugust Secretary of State to the scullion in the kitchen, it is “Mr.\r\nPresident.” Not only the inclination downward of the head with the\r\nbending muscles of the knees, but even the voices of the old friends\r\nbecome humble in tone and deferential in spirit. Cringing servants\r\nin the shape of Congressmen--in fact, all other mortals who have\r\nfavors to crave--creep and crawl before the face of majesty. By and\r\nby the strong and designing of either sex elbow all the rest away,\r\nand form a cordon around the Executive, coloring all in the shape\r\nof everything which reaches his ears and eyes until he is no longer\r\nhimself and is as blind as a bat hung to the walls of the Mammoth\r\nCave.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the above assertion the writer will give the readers of\r\n_The Times_ a description of the last day at the White House before\r\nthe attempt was made upon President Garfield’s life. It was Friday,\r\nthe last “Cabinet day” in the annals of this administration. It was\r\nthe first day of July, hot and sultry beyond description. The breeze\r\nwhich swept through the open doors of the mansion came like the\r\nbreath from an open oven. The spray from the fountain turned into\r\nvapor in its ascending flight and reminded the beholder of boiling\r\ngeysers in a volcanic plain. Inside the White House a crowd had\r\ncongregated to improve the opportunity of the last chance before\r\nthe President should depart on his summer tour. Both branches of\r\nCongress, Army and Navy, governors of States and Territories, with\r\nthe odds and ends of humanity all unknown to fame, were collected in\r\nan indescribable, whirling kaleidoscope. At times the stairs leading\r\nto the “throne room” would be turned into a cataract, but instead\r\nof animalcules in the water it was humanity in the air. The stairs\r\nonce free from the descending mass would be instantly filled with the\r\nsame kind of material in an upward flight, to remain until hope was\r\ndead, and the first result would be enacted again. It was understood\r\nthat the President would see the people between the hours of 10 and\r\n12, although it was “Cabinet day.” But, alas, the “people” meant the\r\nCabinet officers, for not content with seeing their chief at the 12\r\no’clock council, it appeared that each had a little private business\r\nof his own. At 10 o’clock, or rather five minutes after, the coupe of\r\nthe Treasury Department deposited Secretary Windom, apparently fresh\r\nfrom the hands of his laundress, faultlessly attired in thinnest\r\nof summer covering, on the Executive porch. The fragrance of a\r\nperfumed bath still clung to his handsome person and nothing could\r\nbe compared to it but heaven’s own dew clinging to a morning-glory.\r\nWith mischief dancing in his hazel eyes and a wave of his fragrant\r\nhand to the little woman whose duty it is to press his official name\r\nbetween leaves of lavender, he disappeared. Then came Lincoln--“Bob”\r\nthe people call him, not tall like his late father, but stalwart of\r\nlimb and broad of shoulder, a strong, handsome face, which lights\r\nup with the same expression which we all remember who had the honor\r\nof standing in the presence of Abraham Lincoln. A moment and he\r\nis gone. And now comes Postmaster-General James, looking neither\r\nto the right nor the left, with his eyes bent, as usual, in one\r\ndirection. Built on the narrow-gauge plan, long, slim, shallow and\r\nslender, ophidian and dazzling, one listens for the death-dealing\r\nrattle. Cold chills begin to creep along the great nerve centers.\r\nHe glides up the stairs. Thank heaven, he has gone. A moment later\r\nand a prominent governor says: “Garfield never knows what that man\r\nis bringing about.” Stand aside! He’s little, but how he can sting!\r\nIt is MacVeigh--a Scottish chief. The tartan plaid, bare legs and\r\npibroch are invisible. Round, dense and compact as a bullet, with the\r\ncharacteristics of Scotland which mark him as surely as the furze\r\nthat each season adorns the heather. American-born generations may\r\nstand between him and his ancestors, but he is no more changed than\r\nan English walnut would be transplanted to the Western continent.\r\n\r\nSquare, heavy-rigged, sitting low in the water, bearing down under\r\nfull sail, determined to reach the port in time--this is Secretary\r\nKirkwood. His clothes are thin and fleecy, but more sheepy-looking\r\nthan cloud-like. He perspires! One is reminded of great drops of\r\nrain pattering on a shingled roof, only the noise must exist in the\r\nimagination. Homely and plain as a crooked apple tree, and yet the\r\nvery shade where it would be delightful to linger. Only a rough\r\nshell, containing the sweetest of kernels. After 11! The clock hands\r\npoint to the hour of 12. A moving tableau enters the broad corridor\r\nfrom a side door. Secretary Blaine is the central figure. On his\r\nright walks Sir Edward Thornton, in full court dress, dazzling in\r\ndecorations and gold lace. He has come to take formal leave of the\r\nPresident, as he has been called home by his Queen. On the left of\r\nthe Secretary walks his eldest daughter, proudly--Miss Alice Blaine.\r\nShe is clad in pure white, unrelieved by color. A broad-brimmed\r\nchip hat on the back of her head frames her oval brunette face, and\r\nwith her youth and grace she is a striking addition to the picture.\r\nSecretary Blaine looks troubled and worried. The shadows have grown\r\ndarker under his eyes, while the other portions of his face are far\r\nmore pallid than of yore. His step is less elastic, but the heat must\r\nbe considered. The doors close and the curtain falls.\r\n\r\nIt should have been mentioned before that the officials who guard the\r\nfront doors of the White House have the power to assign people to\r\ndifferent rooms in the order which may seem to them best. Those whom\r\nthey consider of most consequence are permitted to go up the stairs,\r\nwhilst the “rabbles,” so called from want of honorary prefixes to\r\ntheir names, must remain below. This is applicable to Cabinet day.\r\nWhen the fortunate arrive up stairs the winnowing process goes on\r\nagain. The highest privilege is to be permitted to enter the room or\r\nheadquarters of Mr. J. Stanley Brown, a youth of 22 summers, whose\r\nvelvet cheeks, destitute of hirsute ornament or manly decoration, is\r\nsufficient evidence of his guileless innocence and his willingness\r\nto obey the will of others. Mr. Rose, who had been the President’s\r\nprivate secretary for years when he was a Congressman, was found to\r\nhave opinions of his own, and it did not suit those who have matters\r\nin hand to have that kind of material to manage.\r\n\r\nWhilst Dr. Bliss has shown the country that he does not believe in\r\nhaving too many doctors around, Swaim and Rockwell are the men who\r\nkeep guard at the chamber door of the President and will not permit\r\na friendly face to pass. As proof the following fact is given to the\r\nreaders of _The Times_: When Mrs. Garfield visited New York, before\r\nher late illness, she invited her warm personal friend, Miss Ransom,\r\nto accompany her. The two intended to visit the art galleries\r\ntogether. Mrs. Garfield wished to have Miss Ransom’s opinion on\r\na picture of Alexander Hamilton that had lately been resurrected\r\nand come to light, after lying for many years among the rubbish.\r\nMrs. Rockwell also went along. When the names of the august female\r\nPresidential party were made up to be given to the press Colonel\r\nRockwell instructed the correspondent to leave out Miss Ransom’s\r\nname, saying that “no names must be mentioned but Mrs. Garfield\r\nand Mrs. Rockwell.” All the old trusted friends of the Garfields\r\nare thrust aside, whilst Swaim and Rockwell guard the doors. The\r\nisolation and cruelty towards the President is not the work of the\r\ndoctors, for they are only intent on killing off each other, and if\r\nthe country could be relieved of this surplus material the nation\r\nwould have cause to rejoice.\r\n\r\nBut coming back to the White House, among those permitted to wait\r\nup stairs was the gallant Colonel Buell, who had come to Washington\r\nafter an eighteen months’ campaign in the field after the murdering\r\nVictoria and his savage band. He waited until the Cabinet meeting\r\nwas over, and it was well on to 4 o’clock. “Better on an Indian\r\ntrail in the wilderness than the trail of a President, if this is\r\nthe experience,” he said. Did President Garfield know that this\r\nbrave, gallant soldier awaited audience at his door? The writer\r\nbelieves not. Did the soldier depart with his face crisped with\r\ndisappointment? He did. Who saw the President? One woman of all\r\nthe women who hung around like the lost souls around the gates of\r\nParadise. This was Mrs. General Morgan L. Smith, the woman who began\r\na suit in the New York courts for $25,000 damages for refusing\r\nto pay her for giving a decision of the Supreme Court in advance\r\nof its being known through the regular news channel. Mrs. Morgan\r\nSmith informed the writer that her interview with the President was\r\nperfectly satisfactory. The joy stamped on her beautiful face was\r\nsufficient proof. The soldier walked sad and dejected away, but from\r\nthe window of the Executive Mansion a woman’s eyes filled with tears\r\nfollowed his retreating footsteps; and from the holiest depths of her\r\nheart ascended the prayer that God would shield and protect him, and\r\ngive his brave soul and strong arm the strength to protect the lone\r\nsettlers from the murderous savages that infest our remote frontier.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW YEAR RECEPTION.\r\n\r\nTHE DIPLOMATS AND THE PUBLIC PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO PRESIDENT ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 2, 1882_.\r\n\r\nAccording to immemorial usage, the broad doors of the Executive\r\nmansion opened their portals to receive the gorgeous pageant that\r\ninaugurates the President’s first official reception of the New\r\nYear. Thoroughly renovated and partially refurnished, the old\r\nhistoric building appears like an antiquated belle rejuvenated by\r\nthe modern accessories of the toilet. Oriental designs, artistically\r\narranged, give the surroundings a magnificence never attained since a\r\nformer White House mistress died. The Red Parlor, where the foreign\r\nlegations assembled previous to their presentation to the President,\r\nhas been recently furnished in modern style and with exquisite taste.\r\nFrom the lofty windows fall cascades of ruby velvet and real lace.\r\nThe furniture is upholstered in ruby plush, and the prevailing tints\r\nof the Persian rugs, which cover a large proportion of the floor,\r\nhave been chosen to harmonize with the ruby surroundings. Potted\r\nplants, but not in profusion, were used to ornament the tall mantels\r\nand pedestals purposely placed for their reception.\r\n\r\nAnother marked feature was the absence of the police until the\r\nimmense unofficial crowd began to pour through the corridor. Then the\r\nnecessity of keeping the living river within its proper bounds became\r\napparent to the crowd itself, and good nature and kind words for the\r\nPresident were heard on every side.\r\n\r\nA New Year’s reception at the White House forms a picture on the mind\r\nnever to be forgotten. Precisely at the hour appointed the foreign\r\nlegations began to assemble and in a brief time the Red Room was\r\nfilled to overflowing with representatives of the different civilized\r\nnations of the globe. The gorgeous costumes worn by these people can\r\nonly be compared to the plumage of birds which infest the tropical\r\nforests. The appearance of the English diplomat is among the most\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nThe French minister, M. Maxime Outrey, appeared in the usual court\r\ndress which the French Republic has adopted. In the dim light\r\nits hue could not be detected except that it was very dark, with\r\nsemi-military appearance. The pants were ornamented with a broad\r\ngilt band up the side, with a limited quantity of gilt embroidery.\r\nHis chapeau, which he carried, looked like that worn by Napoleon\r\nI. Monsieur Outrey seemed particularly engaged in playing oak to\r\nthe vine, for on his arm clung winsome Madame Outrey, clad in a\r\nlong-trained black velvet dress. When the old minister was balancing\r\nhis dignity before the red fez of Turkey, the madame, in the sweet\r\nlanguage of her native land, had asked after all the seraglios on the\r\nbanks of the Bosphorus. But the most charming face and figure which\r\nshone in the diplomatic throng belonged to Miss Sackville-West, the\r\ndaughter of the new English minister. In the absence of her father\r\nshe appeared with one of the attaches of the legation. Imagine a\r\nslight, girlish figure, yet perfect in development as a rose in full\r\nbloom, with a face cast in the most aristocratic mould, low brow,\r\nfull, large, almond-shaped eyes, classic nose, the saucy, short\r\nupper lip and wonderfully chiseled chin, all animated by the highest\r\ngrace of expression. If the haughty Victoria has ever looked upon\r\nthis dainty subject she will not bear too heavily on the lineage of\r\nthe Sackville-Wests. Miss West was clad in a heavy dark green satin\r\nwalking dress, with a simple Fanchon bonnet to match, and amidst all\r\nthe pomp and splendor her presence brought the same sweet emotions\r\nwhich come to mind with an English daisy.\r\n\r\nIn picturesque effect imperial China glowed in the Red Room like\r\na fireplace in the dark. An imposing figure, clad in a blue satin\r\npetticoat, surmounted by a cap, from which trailed gracefully that\r\nwhich might have been clipped from Pegasus. It is said this Chinese\r\nminister is of the highest rank ever sent out of his own country,\r\nhis person more fully representing the permanency, the fixity of\r\npurpose, of his imperial master than any of his predecessors. Closely\r\nfollowing the mandarin comes South America--land of political turmoil\r\nand earthquakes. All these ministers appear to be the descendants of\r\nCortez. A genuine Spanish grandee is represented by Señor Don Simon\r\nCamancho, from Venezuela. He is unaccompanied, as Mrs. Camancho still\r\ntarries in New York.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to leave the Red Room with its striking figures for\r\npen portraits, but the “throne room” must be reached. You pass the\r\nthreshold which leads from red to blue. The first impression is\r\nrepublican simplicity. An official of the State Department stands at\r\nthe left of President Arthur and presents the passing throng. The\r\ndean of the diplomatic corps is the first to enter, followed very\r\nclosely by all that is official from other lands. Towering above\r\nhis associates stands President Arthur, in personal appearance and\r\nattitude every inch a ruler, with all the stately courtesy of James\r\nBuchanan, the native dignity and warmth of manner of Abraham Lincoln,\r\nand a grace which is all his own. He was clad in a simple black\r\nfull-dress suit.\r\n\r\nAt the right of the President stood his new Secretary of State,\r\nslender, attenuated, but spirituelle and refined. Near by is\r\nSecretary Folger. Imagine a man of perfect proportion and exactly\r\nthe right size, with a face so classic that it might be carved, with\r\niron-gray hair, and this is Attorney-General Brewster.\r\n\r\nA long line of ladies had been invited by President Arthur to help\r\nhim receive. The innovation of numbers was inaugurated by Mrs. Julia\r\nGrant, when she presided at the White House. It is not known whether\r\nMrs. Grant meant to emulate Eugenie surrounded by her court, yet the\r\neffect is somewhat the same. The leading lady who modestly stood at\r\nthe head is Mrs. Frelinghuysen, dressed in black silk, without the\r\nslightest pretense of doing anything but her duty. How tired and\r\nworn every feature of her face seemed, turned into an interrogation\r\npoint, which asked, what does it all amount to any way? Then came\r\nthe wife of the Attorney-General. Mrs. Brewster wore a royal robe of\r\nruby velvet. Another lovely face was that of the wife of the young\r\nSecretary of War. Mrs. Lincoln wore Spanish lace over old gold satin.\r\nAlthough the youngest of the cabinet circle, Mrs. Lincoln’s whole\r\nchildhood was associated with official society at the capital. Room\r\nonly for one more of the stars that compose President Arthur’s galaxy\r\nof assistants--Mrs. Senator Logan, most queenly in appearance of all.\r\nSlightly taller than the others, with a face lighted with flashing\r\nblack eyes and snowy hair rolled back in Martha Washington style,\r\nwith rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, a veritable picture of “roses in\r\nthe snow.” The saddest picture is Mrs. Blaine in the background,\r\nbereft of her official crown, disappointment peeping out of her face\r\ncovertly, as the picket guard watches for the foe.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court marches by, but some of its members are absent.\r\nAfterwards file by the veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic,\r\nwearing a badge which indicates devotion to a cause. Now a cold, sad\r\nwave comes down the long corridors following the gay throng which has\r\njust passed. It is the Oldest Inhabitants Association--encased in the\r\nfrozen armor of age. There is a brush. A sigh that seems to breathe\r\nfrom everything around. It is gone. The beautiful ladies who stood by\r\nPresident Arthur are gone, because all that is “official” has drifted\r\nby. There is a muffled sound--the crowd, the strangers, the citizens\r\nof the District are coming. Policemen begin to appear, they are\r\nstrewn around as though a siege were about to begin, but President\r\nArthur shows not the least sign of weariness; he shakes every offered\r\nhand. “Where are the ladies who were to receive with the President?”\r\nis anxiously asked. “Gone to their own receptions,” is answered from\r\nsomewhere. A bit of a woman appears leading a little child. It is\r\nsuch a tiny speck, but its sweet face peeps out from its fleecy hood\r\nas an angel’s might from under the mist. There are no grand dames\r\naround--only the people. President Arthur takes the little one in his\r\nhands, then he lifts it high, and gives the humble little tot a kiss.\r\nIt was so exquisitely done that it seemed the work of inspiration.\r\nWith this incident the ceremonies came to a close, whilst the Marine\r\nBand was playing its choicest airs, composed by its talented leader\r\nto inaugurate the new year.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE TRIAL OF GUITEAU.\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF THE JUDGE, JURY, AND AUDIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 5, 1882_.\r\n\r\nA strange tale comes floating down the surface of the centuries.\r\nIts strange points assimilate with those associated with the\r\nunique criminal trial of to-day. During the period that the Roman\r\ninquisition was at the zenith of its power, a Catholic priest\r\ninvented an instrument of torture. It was in the shape of an iron\r\nroom, long and narrow, and with seven small windows looking toward\r\nthe rising sun. By means of noiseless machinery the space contracted\r\nso that the wretched prisoner would see by the first light of\r\ndawn that a window had disappeared. The torture of the infernal\r\nmachine could be lengthened or shortened according to the mercy of\r\nthe executioner. But on the last day, or rather night, the iron\r\nbedstead would assume the form of a box, and as the sun appeared in\r\nthe east the muffled tones of a bell would fall on the ear of the\r\ndoomed, whilst the lid would fall, and after the clang there would\r\nbe heard the fastening of screws if insensibility had not previously\r\nintervened. To prevent the existence of this instrument being known,\r\nthe Doge of Venice seized its unfortunate inventor and put him into\r\nthe machine, that everything connected with it should be destroyed,\r\neven to the inventor. Just as the Catholic priest created an\r\ninstrument of torture and destruction, Guiteau has woven a web from\r\nwhich there is no escape.\r\n\r\nThe mercy or weakness which Judge Cox is accused of exercising toward\r\nthe prisoner is the same sort of kindness which the executioner\r\nhad for the Catholic priest. The windows of the iron cage are a\r\nlittle longer in disappearing. A thoughtful spectator watching the\r\ncountenance of Judge Cox will see that he carries all the weight\r\nof responsibility which goes with the judicial ermine. Cool, calm,\r\ninflexible, he seems to realize that his course in this celebrated\r\ncase will be put on record to stand as long as the archives of the\r\nRepublic. No opportunity has been given for the defense to obtain a\r\nnew trial; no chance for ill-timed sympathy to accuse him of want of\r\nclemency or withholding that which is decreed the humblest citizen on\r\ntrial for his life. In this most trying position in which a man could\r\nbe placed, Judge Cox has filled all the requirements of the case in\r\na manner which unbiased, unprejudiced posterity will applaud.\r\n\r\nComing to the jury, taken altogether, a clearer-headed set of men\r\ncould not be found. If the writer was on trial for her life and\r\nallowed the privilege to select a jury, a large proportion of those\r\nnow serving would be chosen for this painful and thankless duty. One\r\nof the jurymen has had honors paid him accorded only to the most\r\ndistinguished men of the world. He has been met at the threshold of\r\nthe Winter Palace of the Czar of Russia, the great Nicholas, standing\r\nwith a silver salver in one hand, upon which was placed corn bread,\r\nand a golden chair in the other, the seat of which was hollowed out\r\nto hold salt. He has sat at the same table with the Emperor, amidst\r\nall the splendor and pomp of the Russian court. This gentleman\r\n(Mr. Heinline) was engineer of the monitor that carried Assistant\r\nSecretary Fox, of the Navy, when he went to take President Lincoln’s\r\ndispatches to the crowned heads of Europe during our late war. In\r\ncharge of this wonderful war craft, he received as much attention\r\nand in one sense more than Mr. Fox, for the Czar, like his ancestor,\r\nPeter the Great, had unbounded respect for the science of mechanics.\r\nDuring the lifetime of the monitors only the highest talent was\r\nemployed to manage their machinery. Cool and brave must be the men\r\nwho went to sea in these iron pots, and who would not choose such a\r\njuryman? And yet fate or accident has determined this man should\r\nbe one to bring his strength of mind to decide in the matter of the\r\nassassin’s responsibility. It would make this article too long to\r\nmake sketches of the different jurymen, but all enjoy the respect\r\nof those who know them best, so far as the writer has been able to\r\nascertain. Few men, whether their crimes have been heavy or light,\r\nhave been so fortunate as the assassin. No mortal hand was extended\r\nto help Guiteau in the selection of a jury. To the credit of all the\r\ncitizens of the District, not a man was chosen that did not bewail\r\nhis fate and hope that something would prevent his selection. It was\r\nclaimed at the time that no jury could be impaneled because all had\r\nexpressed opinions as to the guilt of the prisoner; but whether the\r\nassassin was insane or otherwise placed the trial in a different\r\nlight, and only the repulsion remained in the minds of the people of\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nIt is cruel slander on the women of the District when it is claimed\r\nit is “the same old set” of theater-goers that have gone to the\r\nGuiteau trial every day. A very few faces, less than a dozen, have\r\nbeen daily attendants, but these are the suspected adventuresses\r\nwho come to Washington in advance of Congressmen to get the winter\r\nnests well warmed. They stop at the leading hotels, where they behave\r\nwith that becoming modesty that secures them from molestation. When\r\nthe real work of the Congressional season begins they flit to the\r\ndifferent “boudoirs” in some of the most respectable quarters of\r\nthe city where carriages going and coming attract not the slightest\r\nnotice. The women wear “seal skin” and have all the attractive airs\r\nof “official life.” Excitement they must have, and the Guiteau trial\r\nis an excellent preliminary to the winter festivities.\r\n\r\nIt is this class of female adventuresses who dog the footsteps of\r\nthe virtuous Congressmen as well as the other kind. They even have\r\nthe “cheek” to attend private receptions uninvited, and claim to be\r\non intimate terms with those who compose our most refined circles\r\nof “official society.” When these women are excepted it will be\r\nfound that the surging crowd that fills the court room is composed\r\nof strangers visiting the national capital. Our ladies had a desire\r\nto look once upon a man who could murder a President, but the desire\r\nwas gratified with one visit. A glance at the newspapers will prove\r\nthat this pardonable curiosity pervaded all ranks of the people. Even\r\nclergymen have been seen in the small space allotted to spectators of\r\nthis criminal trial.\r\n\r\nAll the “star” actors or actresses who have appeared on the stage\r\nin Washington since the trial began came to the court room--the\r\nFlorences, Mary Anderson, Lotta, and a troupe of lesser lights which\r\nhave escaped the writer’s memory. All seemed seeking to try to\r\nsolve the problem, whether the assassin is insane, and, with scarce\r\nan exception, all believe, as did Frederick the Great of Prussia,\r\nthat cranks “are responsible.” When Frederick ruled his subjects\r\nassassination became a familiar crime, while insanity became the\r\nbridge which carried the criminals to safety; but the far-seeing,\r\nirrepressible Emperor thought it would be a good plan to crush out\r\nthis kind of dangerous material by the extreme penalty of the law,\r\nand the result was that fanaticism did not bloom out any more in\r\nthis kind of way. Whilst “experts,” or those who have had experience\r\nin the management of insane people, can give their belief, that has\r\nlittle to do with the actual and proper settlement of the question\r\nas to the responsibility of the “crank.” An honest man or woman\r\nwho has been insane, yet restored to health, should be the ones to\r\ndecide this most important point. Shakespeare settled the subject\r\nwhen he asked “Who can minister to a mind diseased?” Now, this most\r\nsuperior of human beings did not dare to answer his own inquiry. If\r\nthe “experts” could take hold of a broken mind as the surgeons do of\r\na shattered limb, possibly they might cure it; but if a human soul by\r\nsome inscrutable means, like a ship at sea, finds its bottom covered\r\nwith barnacles, or a terrible rent in the hold, torn by a hidden\r\nrock, only the Builder can plunge into the vast ocean of mystery and\r\nmend the sinking wreck.\r\n\r\nTaking the testimony of the “experts,” Dr. Gray seemed wisest and\r\nbest informed, and he was very careful not to commit himself. He\r\nconscientiously let the jury know how very little we know about\r\ninsanity, but he did bear out the fact that a mind a little off\r\ncolor, or what is vulgarly called a “crank,” for the want of a better\r\nterm, is not relieved of responsibility and should be punished for\r\ncrime committed the same as other criminals.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prisoner has been allowed better food and has had\r\nthe stimulant of excitement imparted by his trial, there is a change\r\ngradually stealing over his features, which, rightly interpreted,\r\nmeans despair. His naturally pale face has assumed a kind of ashen\r\nhue which makes a sombre background for the lightning play of the\r\nfierce passions with which he is continually interrupting the court.\r\nThere are no particular points to mark this man. He is like the great\r\nmasses of the human family who resemble each other almost as much as\r\ndo the leaves of the forest.\r\n\r\nThere is something very touching in the appearance of Mr. Scoville,\r\nbrother-in-law and counsel for the assassin. He seems to have\r\nadvanced ten years in age since the trial began. He has grown very\r\nmuch thinner, and a painful, eager, anxious expression is stamped on\r\nhis otherwise kindly face. And the sister, who comes so regularly and\r\nshares the odium and disgrace of the brother! It is said her husband\r\nwas very much averse to having anything to do with the trial, but\r\nwhen so many lawyers refused he yielded to the earnest entreaties of\r\nhis wife. But instead of becoming an object of loathing to the ladies\r\nof Washington, like her brother, the assassin, her womanly devotion\r\nis appreciated. It is true she has not been crowned with laurel or\r\nwelcomed to hospitable boards, but woman’s heart at Washington beats\r\nin sympathy with this sister, for no place can be so vile that it is\r\nnot purified and uplifted by the presence of the same spirit that\r\nqualified Mary to become the mother of Jesus.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Guiteau, the brother, has also won the respect of the\r\ncommunity. He is trying to make the public understand that only an\r\nidiot or mad man would be guilty of the crime which a brother has\r\ncommitted. He feels the disgrace so deep and burning that all facts\r\nconnected with the assassin’s life should come to light. Unlike his\r\nsister, he has pity, but no affection, and if he can be made to\r\nbelieve his brother is responsible, he, like Mr. Scoville, under the\r\nsame circumstances, will be among the first to approve the carrying\r\nout of the extreme penalty of the law.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTIC EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN DE LONG’S DEPARTURE--THE POLARIS AND HER COMMANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 7, 1882_.\r\n\r\nSince the cablegrams of James Gordon Bennett to the authorities\r\nat Washington, no further news has been received of the ill-fated\r\nsurvivors of the _Jeannette_, who are now supposed to be traversing\r\nthe frozen waste of Northern Siberia in dog sledges to reach once\r\nmore a welcome home. Sad as the fate of all those who have undertaken\r\nto penetrate the secrets which Nature keeps eternally locked in her\r\nArctic jaws, the moment a new expedition for the same purpose is\r\nmentioned, the spirit of adventure stirs within the naval breast, and\r\nmore officers and men are found to offer their services than would\r\nman a fleet.\r\n\r\nWhen Commander De Long, of the _Jeannette_, drew the awful prize in\r\nthe lottery of Arctic exploration, his ambition rose to fever heat.\r\nSo much so that in a measure it dried away the tears of his almost\r\nheart-broken wife, who felt the fate of Lady Franklin wrapping her\r\nmind as a dead body swathed in a winding-sheet. Just before Commander\r\nDe Long left the capital, husband and wife decided to go to the White\r\nHouse and receive the Executive prayers and blessings ere the doomed\r\nvessel should unfurl her sails. Arriving at the proper morning hour,\r\nthey waited and waited until patience was gone, when a messenger\r\nreturned bringing the sad intelligence that “The President could not\r\nbe seen, but Mrs. Hayes would soon be at leisure.” Another period\r\nof precious time passed, when the rustling of silk was heard in a\r\ndistant corridor, and at last a huge bouquet “hove” in sight, with a\r\nremarkably smiling lady behind it. Without giving Captain De Long an\r\nopportunity to get a word in edgewise, Mrs. Hayes seemed determined\r\nto let the visitors know that she had mastered the situation and\r\nknew all about it; but imagine the consternation of the brave naval\r\ncommander to find that he had been mistaken for a charlatan who had\r\ninvented what he believed to be a method of freezing out yellow fever\r\non board of ships irrespective of the vessel’s latitude.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Hayes, her soul palpitating with devotion to her\r\nfifty million loving subjects, “if you have only succeeded in ridding\r\nthe world of yellow fever.”\r\n\r\n“Breakers ahead!” thought the embryo explorer, whilst the little wife\r\nwas struck dumb to think her captain, whose name was to be enrolled\r\nwith Franklin, Kane, Hall and others, and which will last in the\r\nworld’s archives so long as civilization remains on top, should be\r\nthe victim of a mistake. It is not known whether Commander De Long\r\npiloted Mrs. Hayes from the tropical regions of the yellow fever to\r\nthe Arctic barriers of the North Pole, but it is certain that both\r\nhusband and wife left the Executive mansion wiser if not happier than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nA good sharp taste of Arctic adventure can be obtained by gazing\r\nupon a picture of the _Polaris_, of the late Hall expedition as\r\nshe lay locked in her frozen bed in the cruel polar sea. The\r\nartist has caught the icy atmosphere, with all its bleak, horrible\r\nsurroundings. If the _Polaris_ remains undisturbed by beast or\r\nsavage, the centuries will roll by, leaving the vessel intact, like\r\nthe mastodon, now extinct, but preserved by the glaciers of Siberia.\r\nA fiery enthusiasm took possession of the late Capt. C. F. Hall,\r\nand he came to the capital to plead his cause before Congress, as\r\ndid Columbus before Ferdinand and Isabella. This same kind of flame\r\nis what lights up the path of progress, and keeps civilization from\r\ngoing down to the tomb. It made Isabella sell her jewels, and it\r\nforced our Congress to give Captain Hall an ear, and the consequence\r\nwas the purchase by the Government of an ice vessel of the Delaware,\r\n_Periwinkle_ by name. She was brought to Washington, where Secretary\r\nRobeson caused her very ribs to be taken out and others of the\r\ngreatest strength put in the place. To finish all, he added to the\r\nlong rakish sailing body an iron nose. In nautical language seven\r\nfeet of “dead wood,” or solid timber, protected the forward part of\r\nthe ship and this was strengthened by a plating of iron. Her sides\r\nwere from twenty inches to two feet in thickness, whilst she had\r\njust twice the number of iron bolts in her carcass that are used\r\nfor ordinary vessels for whaling purposes. Nearly every dollar of\r\nthe appropriation was used in the purchase and strengthening of the\r\nships, leaving nothing for ornament; but everything in the shape of\r\ncomfort and luxury was contributed by the wealthy citizens of Boston,\r\neven to musical instruments, which were to pierce the solitudes with\r\ncultured airs. The _Polaris_ was rigged as a foretop-sail schooner,\r\nand was able to sail and steer without aid from her engine. The\r\nengine could burn either coal or oil, but it was not expected to\r\nbe of much use in extreme northern latitudes, as the danger was\r\nimminent of breaking the paddle-wheels on the ice; and the propeller\r\nwas arranged in such a way that it could be lifted on deck through a\r\nshaft or “propeller-well.” But if the propeller was broken a new one\r\nwas provided. The cargo was made up of duplicate articles to insure\r\nits progress and safety. Most wonderful life-boats were provided.\r\nOne in particular attracted attention because it was made for sledge\r\njourneys. It was constructed of hickory and ash, and folded up\r\nlike an umbrella, thus occupying one-eighth of the space as when\r\nopened for use. It takes only two or three minutes to spread this\r\nboat on the water. Its weight was two hundred and fifty pounds. A\r\nlife-preserving buoy was placed on the outside of the stern of the\r\n_Polaris_, and in case a man fell overboard it could instantly be\r\nlowered by touching a spring somewhere near the pilot-house. By\r\ntouching another spring an electric light was elevated two feet above\r\nthe buoy, and this would light up the water for yards around.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was loaded with pemmican, dessicated vegetables, canned\r\nmeats and fruits. The pemmican was the life of the expedition.\r\nThe latter is an ugly brownish compound to the eye, disgusting to\r\nthe taste in civilized regions; but an old whaler says: “It is an\r\nentirely different article in the Arctic regions. When exposed to\r\nthe intense cold it becomes pale straw color, and melts in the mouth\r\nlike a peach, only ten thousand times more delicious.” It is said\r\nto be worth a journey to the North Pole to be able to eat pemmican\r\naccompanied by raw walrus liver.\r\n\r\nAll this frozen knowledge is vividly retained in the writer’s mind,\r\nbecause it was her experience to sit at the same table with Captain\r\nHall at the National Hotel during the time the vessel was being\r\nfitted out for her last voyage. This enthusiast had already spent\r\nfive years of his life with the Esquimaux and looked upon it as the\r\nhappiest period of his existence. There seemed to be a delightful\r\nthrill in his mind when he would relate his escapes from freezing.\r\n“One night,” said the Captain, “I had gone to pay a visit to an\r\nEsquimaux lodge. I had gone to bed and was enjoying the most sublime\r\ndreams. It seemed as if the whole sky in every quarter was blazing\r\nwith auroral lights, when all at once I felt myself trampled on,\r\nrudely shaken and beaten with small fists. For a time I could not\r\ncollect my mind or understand what it all meant, but as soon as\r\nconsciousness asserted itself I learned that my kind friends had\r\ndiscovered that I was freezing to death. The lodge was colder than\r\nthe one I had been accustomed to, and I had foolishly decided to\r\nsleep alone, but I had been watched as a mother looks after her\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“How did you get through the night, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“After that experience I was willing to share the beds with the\r\nEsquimaux, their favorite dogs included. The proprieties of civilized\r\nlife are entirely wiped out in the Arctic regions. It is merely the\r\nanimal fighting for existence.”\r\n\r\n“But what good will come from this vast expenditure of precious blood\r\nand treasure?”\r\n\r\n“The stars and stripes must float from the icy pinnacle of the North\r\nPole. Congress has given me the means, and with God’s help I’ll nail\r\nour banner there.”\r\n\r\nNow that we have so many brave men battling for their lives on their\r\nreturn from the ill-fated _Jeannette_, the writer thought the readers\r\nof _The Times_ might wish to see recalled a picture of the _Polaris_,\r\nwith her intrepid commander, whose bones have been left to crumble in\r\nthe awful “ice field,” for soil there is none to be reached with pick\r\nand shovel--only a snow grave.\r\n\r\nThe _Polaris_ left her moorings at the Washington navy yard with\r\nnothing omitted which would detract from her success. Captain\r\nBudington, the old whaler upon whom devolved the safety of the\r\nvessel, left nothing undone. It was this indomitable seaman who\r\nfloated the fragment of Captain Hall’s crew home on a cake of ice.\r\nThe experience of this little band reads like one of Hans Andersen’s\r\nfairy tales. The cruise of the _Jeannette_ makes a good advertisement\r\nfor the New York _Herald_, but what has the Government or nation\r\ngained by its outlay in the Bennett scheme? Hereafter the fools must\r\nnot be permitted to fall into the _Herald’s_ trap if the Government\r\nis expected to pay the greater part of the bills. Judging the future\r\nby the past, an incipient Arctic explorer should be treated as a\r\nlunatic and be placed where the contagion can be treated with the\r\nfreezing process such as Mrs. Hayes understood so well.\r\n\r\n  OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Several occurrences of the name ‘Phoebe’ have been changed to\r\n  ‘Phœbe’ for consistency.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained: for example,\r\n  mid-winter, midwinter; broad-cloth, broadcloth; god-mother,\r\n  godmother; corruscated; pom-pon; geegaws; traditionary; sublimatic.\r\n\r\n  Pg 7: ‘superb porportions’ replaced by ‘superb proportions’.\r\n  Pg 37: ‘so betwitching for’ replaced by ‘so bewitching for’.\r\n  Pg 45: ‘to a Budhist’ replaced by ‘to a Buddhist’.\r\n  Pg 47: ‘some resemblence to’ replaced by ‘some resemblance to’.\r\n  Pg 53: ‘exceding distaste’ replaced by ‘exceeding distaste’.\r\n  Pg 56: ‘Presidental picture’ replaced by ‘Presidential picture’.\r\n  Pg 60: ‘a strong resemblancce’ replaced by ‘a strong resemblance’.\r\n  Pg 61: ‘platform of equalty’ replaced by ‘platform of equality’.\r\n  Pg 88: ‘tarleton, with pearls’ replaced by ‘tarletan, with pearls’.\r\n  Pg 117: ‘Inteview with One’ replaced by ‘Interview with One’.\r\n  Pg 118: ‘the Saint coldy’ replaced by ‘the Saint coldly’.\r\n  Pg 159: ‘an have we not’ replaced by ‘and have we not’.\r\n  Pg 163: ‘Susan bottonholed’ replaced by ‘Susan buttonholed’.\r\n  Pg 172: ‘_Harper’s Bazar_’ replaced by ‘_Harper’s Bazaar_’.\r\n  Pg 184: ‘corresspondent, it’ replaced by ‘correspondent, it’.\r\n  Pg 235: ‘favor you you would’ replaced by ‘favor you would’.\r\n  Pg 279: ‘and appropirates’ replaced by ‘and appropriates’.\r\n  Pg 301: ‘lies somewere’ replaced by ‘lies somewhere’.\r\n  Pg 347: ‘one day to kill’ replaced by ‘one way to kill’.\r\n  Pg 366: ‘the artifical heat’ replaced by ‘the artificial heat’.\r\n  Pg 384: ‘to tintillate the’ replaced by ‘to titillate the’.\r\n  Pg 390: ‘Afterwards is was’ replaced by ‘Afterwards it was’.\r\n  Pg 401: ‘of the Tuilleries’ replaced by ‘of the Tuileries’.\r\n  Pg 408: ‘doops until the’ replaced by ‘droops until the’.\r\n  Pg 437: ‘could be impanneled’ replaced by ‘could be impaneled’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Olivia Letters, by Emily Edson Briggs",
