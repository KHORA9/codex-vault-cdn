(SIKH TEMPLE) STOCKTON,\r\nCALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1930\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nDALIP SINGH SAUND\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE PRESS OF\r\nWETZEL PUBLISHING CO., INC.\r\nLOS ANGELES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dedicated to\r\nmy beloved friend Dr. Bhagat Singh Thind_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work was undertaken at the request of THE PACIFIC COAST KHALSA\r\nDIWAN SOCIETY, commonly known as the SIKH TEMPLE at Stockton,\r\nCalifornia. The original plan was to write a comprehensive reply to\r\nKatherine Mayo’s book MOTHER INDIA, which was changed later to one of\r\nproducing a handbook on India for general use by the American public.\r\nIn view of the momentous changes of worldwide interest, which have\r\ntaken place in India during recent years, the need for such a book was\r\nquite imminent. And it was only fitting that THE PACIFIC COAST KHALSA\r\nDIWAN SOCIETY, in its role as the interpreter of Hindu culture and\r\ncivilization to America, should undertake its publication.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago, India, like other countries of the Orient, was a\r\nfar Eastern problem. To-day, if rightly judged, it has already become a\r\nnear Western issue. Except for the few scholars of oriental history and\r\nliterature, who occupied themselves diligently in exploring the hidden\r\ntreasures of Hindu civilization, the name of India was an unknown thing\r\nto the rest of the American world. For the average man and woman in\r\nthe United States the affairs of that oriental country were too remote\r\nan issue for them to notice. With the advances made by science during\r\nrecent times, however, different parts of the world have become so\r\nnear together, and their business and cultural relations have grown so\r\ndesperately interlaced, that the affairs of one section of the globe\r\ncannot, and should not, remain a matter of comfortable unconcern for\r\nthe other. It has been my aim in the preparation of this book to answer\r\nthe various questions that commonly arise in the minds of the American\r\npeople regarding the cultural and political problems of India. And if I\r\nhave succeeded in bringing about a better understanding of India by the\r\npeople of America, I consider myself amply repaid.\r\n\r\nWherever feasible I have made free uses of striking passages and\r\nphrases from the writings of several authors. Since these were copied\r\nfrom my notes gathered during a course of study extending over several\r\nyears, it has not always been possible for me to trace the source, for\r\nwhich I wish to be humbly excused.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my sincerest appreciation to my beloved wife for\r\nher untiring assistance in the preparation of the manuscript and the\r\nreading of the proofs. I wish also to thank my friend Mr. Anoop Singh\r\nDhillon for valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, California.\r\nMarch, 1930.\r\n\r\nDALIP SINGH SAUND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                               PAGE\r\n   I.

INDIAN NATIONALISM--ITS ORIGIN AND GROWTH        190\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWOMAN’S POSITION IN INDIA. IS SHE BOND OR FREE?\r\n\r\n     “_Where women are honored,_\r\n     _there the gods are pleased;_\r\n     _but where they are dishonored,_\r\n     _no sacred rite yields reward._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, in the year 200 B. C., wrote Manu, the great law-giver of\r\nIndia--India, whose mind was full grown when the western nations were\r\nyet unborn; India, whose life rolled on while the West, like the\r\ndragon fly, lived and died to live again. While Europe was still in a\r\nstate of primitive barbarism, the Indo-Aryans of _Bharat_ (India) had\r\nreached an elevated state of moral and spiritual perfection; and in\r\nthe realm of intellectual culture they had attained an eminence which\r\nhas not yet been equalled by the most advanced of western countries.\r\nNot only had they a perfect alphabet and a symmetrical language, but\r\ntheir literature already contained models of true poetry and remarkable\r\ntreatises on philosophy, science, and ethics when the forefathers\r\nof the modern western nations were still clothed in skins and could\r\nneither read nor write. In their firm grasp of the fundamental meaning\r\nand purpose of life, and in the organization of their society with a\r\nview to the full attainment of the fruits of life, namely, “to take\r\nfrom each according to his capacity, and to give to each according to\r\nhis needs,” they had attained to a high degree of excellence, which has\r\nbeen recognized by the greatest of both western and oriental scholars.\r\nSays Max Müller, the noted scholar of oriental languages:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country\r\n     most richly endowed with all the wealth, power, and beauty that\r\n     nature can bestow--in some parts a very paradise on earth--I\r\n     should point to India. If I were asked under what sky the human\r\n     mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has\r\n     most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has\r\n     found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention\r\n     even of those who have studied Plato and Kant--I should point\r\n     to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we,\r\n     here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on\r\n     the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the\r\n     Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in order\r\n     to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more\r\n     universal, in fact more truly human, a life not for this life\r\n     only, but a transfigured and eternal life--again I should point to\r\n     India.”[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, of the culture of this ancient people of India Sir\r\nMonier-Williams, sometime Boden Professor of Sanskrit in the University\r\nof Oxford, famous translator of Sanskrit drama, and author of many\r\nworks on history and literature, speaks from an intimate knowledge of\r\nIndia derived from long residence in the country when he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Indeed, I am deeply convinced that the more we learn about the\r\n     ideas, feelings, drift of thought, religious and intellectual\r\n     development, eccentricities, and even errors of the people of\r\n     India, the less ready shall we be to judge them by our own\r\n     conventional European standards--the less disposed to regard\r\n     ourselves as the sole depositories of all the true knowledge,\r\n     learning, virtue and refinements of civilized life--the less prone\r\n     to despise as an ignorant and inferior race the men who compiled\r\n     the laws of Manu, one of the remarkable productions of the\r\n     world--who composed systems of ethics worthy of Christianity--who\r\n     imagined the _Ramayna_ and _Mahabharata_, poems in some respects\r\n     outrivalling the Iliad and the Odyssey--who invented for\r\n     themselves the sciences of grammar, arithmetic, astronomy, logic,\r\n     and six most subtle systems of philosophy. Above all, the less\r\n     inclined shall we be to stigmatize as benighted heathen the\r\n     authors of two religions, however false, which are at this moment\r\n     professed by about half the human race.”[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a civilization has built up the enormous literature of the Hindus\r\nembodied in the _Vedas_, _Upnishads_, the epic poems of _Ramayna_\r\nand _Mahabharata_, and the immortal works of Kalidasa, a literature\r\ncomprising in itself an achievement of the human mind which may be\r\nconsidered sublime, and of which any civilization, ancient or modern,\r\nmay feel justly proud. The poetical merit of Kalidasa’s _Sakuntala_\r\nis universally admitted, and it ranks among the best of the world’s\r\nmasterpieces of dramatic art. Its beauty of thought and its tenderness\r\nin the expression of feeling are exquisite, while its creative fancy is\r\nrich, and the charm of its spirit is full. Says Goethe:\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Wouldst thou the life’s young blossoms and the fruits of its decline,_\r\n_All by which the soul is pleased, enraptured, feasted, fed,--_\r\n_Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sweet name combine?_\r\n_I name thee, O_ Sakuntala, _and all at once is said_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epic poems of _Ramayna_ and _Mahabharata_ consist of stories\r\nand legends which form a splendid superstructure on the teachings\r\ncontained in the earlier scriptures of the _Vedas_. By relating what\r\nthe men and women of those times thought, said, and did, these poems\r\nillustrate in a highly instructive manner the general character and\r\nculture of the early Hindus. The stories contained in these poems,\r\nwhich, in fact, rival the best known epic poems of the world, tell\r\nus of the thoughts and beliefs, hopes and fears, joys and sorrows of\r\nthe people of this earliest recorded period. Through these stories\r\nwe learn the fundamental concepts which governed the religious and\r\nsocial life of the early Hindus; in them are revealed also the basic\r\nmoral and spiritual laws which controlled the actions, “not only of\r\ngods and supernatural men, but of ordinary men and women of India.”\r\n“They explain--by showing the degrees of danger incurred by such\r\nvices as anger and pride, deception and faithlessness, intemperance\r\nand impiety--the evil consequences of moral transgressions from both\r\nman-made and supernatural laws; and at the same time they emphasize the\r\nbeauty of such virtues as patience and self-control, truthfulness and\r\npurity, obedience and filial love.”[3]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the fascinating and elevated nature of its lofty\r\nidealism, we shall quote two passages from _Ramayna_. In the first,\r\nRama, the ideal king, has determined to execute the will of his late\r\nfather by staying in the forests as an exile for fourteen years. Sita,\r\nhis wife and the heroine of the story, begs her lord and husband to\r\nallow her to accompany him in his exile to the forests and offers a\r\npicture highly expressive of pious conjugal love. Sita says:\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Thou art my king, my guide, my only refuge, my divinity._\r\n_It is my fixed resolve to follow thee. If thou must wander forth_\r\n_Through thorny trackless forests, I will go before thee, treading down_\r\n_The prickly brambles to make smooth thy path. Walking before thee, I_\r\n_Shall feel no weariness: the forest thorns will seem like silken robes;_\r\n_The bed of leaves, a couch of down. To me the shelter of thy presence_\r\n_Is better far than stately palaces, and paradise itself._\r\n_Protected by thy arm, gods, demons, men shall have no power to harm me._\r\n_Roaming with thee in desert wastes, a thousand years will be a day;_\r\n_Dwelling with thee, e’en hell itself would be to me a heaven of bliss._”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second selection Rama is heard answering to the entreaties of\r\nBharata, who has tried in vain to dissuade him from carrying out his\r\ndesign. The following is Rama’s answer to the messenger of Bharata:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The words which you have addressed to me, though they recommend\r\n     what _seems_ to be right and salutary, advise, in fact, the\r\n     contrary. The sinful transgressor, who lives according to the\r\n     rules of heretical systems, obtains no esteem from good men. It\r\n     is good conduct that marks a man to be noble or ignoble, heroic\r\n     or a pretender to manliness, pure or impure. Truth and mercy are\r\n     immemorial characteristics of a king’s conduct. Hence royal rule\r\n     is in its essence _truth_. On truth the world is based. Both sages\r\n     and gods have esteemed truth. The man who speaks truth in this\r\n     world attains the highest imperishable state. Men shrink with fear\r\n     and horror from a liar as from a serpent. In this world the chief\r\n     element in virtue is truth; it is called the basis of everything.\r\n     Truth is lord in the world; virtue always rests on truth. All\r\n     things are founded on truth; nothing is higher than it. Why,\r\n     then, should I not be true to my promise, and faithfully observe\r\n     the truthful injunction given by my father? Neither through\r\n     covetousness, nor delusion, nor ignorance, will I, overpowered by\r\n     darkness, break through the barrier of truth, but remain true to\r\n     my promise to my father. How shall I, having promised to him that\r\n     I would thus reside in the forests, transgress his injunction, and\r\n     do what Bharata recommends?”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _Mahabharata_ again we find proof of the high esteem in which the\r\nmanly virtues of truthfulness, charity, benevolence, and chivalry\r\ntowards women were held by the ancient Hindus. The most important\r\nincident in the drama (Mahabharata), namely, the death of Bhishma,\r\noccurred when this brave and virtuous man, in fidelity to his pledge\r\nnever to hurt a woman, refused to fight, and was killed by a soldier\r\ndressed in a woman’s garb.\r\n\r\nThe drama is full of moral maxims, around each one of which the poet\r\nhas woven a story in a beautiful and elegant manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n     “If Truth and a hundred horse sacrifice were weighed together,\r\n     Truth would weigh the heavier. There is no virtue equal to Truth,\r\n     and no sin greater than falsehood.”\r\n\r\n     “For the weak as well as for the strong, forgiveness is an\r\n     ornament.”\r\n\r\n     “A person should never do to others what he does not like others\r\n     to do to him, knowing how painful it is to himself.”\r\n\r\n     “The man who fails to protect his wife earns great infamy here,\r\n     and goes to hell afterwards.”\r\n\r\n\r\n       “_A wife is half the man, his truest friend;_\r\n       _A loving wife is a perpetual spring_\r\n       _Of virtue, pleasure, wealth; a faithful wife_\r\n       _Is his best aid in seeking heavenly bliss;_\r\n       _A sweetly-speaking wife is a companion_\r\n       _In solitude, a father in advice,_\r\n       _A mother in all seasons of distress,_\r\n       _A rest in passing through life’s wilderness._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese great epic poems have a special claim to our attention because\r\nthey not only illustrate the genius of a most interesting people, but\r\nthey are to this day believed as entirely and literally true by the\r\nvast population of India. “Huge congregations of devout men and women\r\nlisten day after day with eager attention to recitations of these old\r\nnational stories with their striking incidents of moral uplift and\r\ninspiration; and a large portion of the people of India order their\r\nlives upon the models supplied by those venerable epics.”\r\n\r\nThe subjection of woman was accepted as a natural thing by the entire\r\nWest until very recent times. Woman was held in the eyes of the law\r\nas no better than a slave, and she was considered useful in society\r\nmerely to serve and gratify man, her master. Truly, such a condition\r\nforms a dark page in the history of the race. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nin her foreword to Mill’s _Subjection of Women_, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “In defense of these expressions [subjection and slavery used in\r\n     Mill’s essay] and the general character of the essay, it must be\r\n     said that the position of women in society at that time [1869]\r\n     was comparable to that of no other class except the slave. As\r\n     the slave took the name of his master so the woman upon marriage\r\n     gave up her own and took that of her husband. Like the slave, the\r\n     married woman was permitted to own no property; as, upon marriage,\r\n     her property real and personal, and all she acquired subsequently\r\n     by gift, will, or her own labour, was absolutely in her husband’s\r\n     control and subject to his debts. He could even will away her\r\n     marriage portion and leave her destitute. The earnings of the\r\n     slave belonged to the master, those of the wife to the husband.\r\n     Neither slave nor wife could make a legal contract, sue or be\r\n     sued, establish business, testify in court, nor sign a paper as a\r\n     witness. Both were said to be ‘dead in law’.\r\n\r\n     “The children of the slave belonged to the master; those of the\r\n     wife to the husband. Not even after the death of the husband was\r\n     the wife a legal guardian of her own children, unless he made her\r\n     so by will. While living he could give them away, and at death\r\n     could will them as he pleased. He dictated the form of education\r\n     and religion that they should be taught, and if the parents\r\n     differed in religion, the wife was forced to teach the husband’s\r\n     faith. Like the slave, if the wife left her husband she could take\r\n     nothing with her, as she had no legal claim to her children, her\r\n     clothing, nor her most personal possessions.\r\n\r\n     “The law in many lands gave husbands the right to whip their wives\r\n     and administer other punishments for disobedience, provided they\r\n     kept within certain legal restrictions. Within the memory of those\r\n     living in Mill’s day, wife-beating was a common offense in England\r\n     and America, husbands contending that they were well within their\r\n     ‘rights’, when so doing.\r\n\r\n     “ ... Education, always considered the most certain sign of\r\n     individual advancement, was either forbidden or disapproved, for\r\n     women. No colleges and few high schools, except in the United\r\n     States, were open to women. Common schools were less usual for\r\n     girls than for boys and the number of totally illiterate women\r\n     vastly exceeded the number of illiterate men. Religion was\r\n     recommended to women as a natural solace and avenue of usefulness,\r\n     but they were not permitted to preach, teach, or pray in most\r\n     churches, and in many singing was likewise barred! The professions\r\n     and more skilled trades were closed to them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat such a state of things was ever tolerated in the advanced\r\ncountries of Europe and America seems to us of India incredible. But\r\nit is, nevertheless, true. As in the case of other social laws, the\r\nsubjection of woman was the result of the fundamental ideals (or the\r\nlack of ideals) which governed the western society of those times. Men\r\nwere still in that low state of development in which “Might was Right,”\r\nand in which the law of superior strength was the rule of life. No\r\npretension was made to regulate the affairs of society according to any\r\nmoral law. The physical law which sanctioned traffic in human slaves,\r\nat the same time sustained the bondage of the weaker sex.\r\n\r\nWe now live in an age where the law of the strongest, in principle\r\nat least, has been abandoned as the guiding maxim of life. It is\r\nstill very widely practised in individual as well as in national\r\nrelationships, but always under the guise of higher social and\r\ncultural ends. The law of force as the avowed rule of general conduct\r\nhas given place to ideals of social equality, human brotherhood, and\r\ninternational goodwill. How far such ideals are being actively followed\r\nby the different peoples of the world remains to be determined; but\r\ntheir profession as the symbol of good culture, at least, is universal.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of woman in the West is thus a very recent\r\nachievement. Yet it is rightly considered by most thinkers the\r\ngreatest single step forward in the advancement of the human race. Its\r\ntremendous importance in the future development of the race is realized\r\nnow by all classes of people over the entire world. In fact, the social\r\nstatus of woman in any society is regarded by most people, and properly\r\nso, as the test of its civilization.\r\n\r\nThrough what hardships and dangers, privations and humiliations ran the\r\nthorny and uphill path of the early leaders of the women’s suffrage\r\nmovement. The deeds of true nobility and heroic determination that\r\nwere performed by the pioneers of women’s emancipation are very little\r\nknown to the average man and woman of the present day. How numerous\r\nand difficult were the obstacles placed in the way of these pioneers\r\nby their brow-beating opponents, how bitter was the nature of their\r\npersecutions, how mean and foul the character of the insults offered\r\nthem, and blind and obstinate the attitude of the governing class to\r\ntheir simple demand for justice are little realized by those who enjoy\r\nthe legacy left by those liberators.\r\n\r\nThe high idealism which inspired the movement of the militant\r\nsuffragettes in England is manifest in their every word and action.\r\nTheir methods of peaceful, silent, dignified, conscious and\r\ncourageous suffering, contrasted with the treacherous, cowardly,\r\nshameful, unmanly, and brutal attacks of their opponents, have\r\nreceived considerations of high merit from all sections of honest and\r\nfair-minded men the world over. Virtuous women belonging to the highest\r\nstations in life and possessing qualities of rare courage, purity, and\r\nself-denial were attacked in the most cowardly fashion by bands of\r\nstrong-bodied hooligans, “felled to the ground, struck in the face,\r\nfrog-marched, and tossed hither and thither in a shameless manner.”\r\n“The women speakers were assaulted with dead mice and flocks of live\r\nmice, and flights of sparrows were let loose into their meetings. Paid\r\ngangs of drunken men were dispatched to the women’s gatherings to sing\r\nobscene songs, and drown the voices of the speakers with the rattle of\r\ntin cans and the ringing of bells. Bands of suffragettes were attacked,\r\nstruck down unconscious, and driven out over wet roads covered with\r\ncarbide by gangs of Liberal volunteers. Suffragette leaders were\r\nimprisoned in the jails of England in groups of hundreds at a time and\r\nwere meted out the fancy punishment of forcible feeding through a tube\r\ninserted into the stomach, a process which causes intense and lingering\r\npain.”[4] This barbarous treatment excited at once the horror and\r\nindignation of the whole civilized world. Yet all these brutalities\r\nwere carried on under the very nose, in fact, at the direction of the\r\nfull-fledged Liberal members of the British cabinet.\r\n\r\nAt a campaign meeting held in Swansea where the suffragettes attempted\r\nto ask Mr. Lloyd-George questions regarding his attitude on the problem\r\nof woman franchise, he is reported as having used such language as,\r\n“sorry specimens of womanhood,” “I think a gag ought to be tried,”\r\n“By and by we shall have to order sacks for them, and the first\r\nto interrupt shall disappear,” “fling them ruthlessly out,” and,\r\n“frog-march them.” At another meeting held in Manchester, February\r\n4th, 1906, where Mr. Winston Churchill spoke, on asking a very simple\r\nquestion, the fourteen year old daughter of Mrs. Pankhurst, Adela, was\r\nsavagely attacked, thrown down, and kicked by several men.\r\n\r\nThe unwholesome and bitter experiences of the peaceful and gentle\r\nsuffragettes at the two election campaigns in May, 1907, are described\r\nby Miss Sylvie E. Pankhurst as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “After these stormy meetings the police and hosts of sympathisers\r\n     always escorted us home to protect us from the rowdies. Just as\r\n     we reached our door there was generally a little scuffle with a\r\n     band of youths who waited there to pelt us with sand and gravel as\r\n     we passed.... At Uppingham, the second largest town, the hostile\r\n     element was smaller than at Oakham, but its methods were more\r\n     dangerous. While Mary Gawthorpe was holding an open-air meeting\r\n     there one evening, a crowd of noisy youths began to throw up\r\n     peppermint ‘bull’s eyes’ and other hard-boiled sweets. ‘Sweets\r\n     to the sweet,’ said little Mary, smiling, and continued her\r\n     argument, but a pot-egg, thrown from the crowd behind, struck her\r\n     on the head and she fell unconscious....”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what happened on October 16th, 1909, at an open-air gathering\r\nnear Dundee, where Mr. Winston Churchill was to speak:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “ ... Standing in the road were some thirty or forty men, all\r\n     wearing the yellow rosettes of official Liberal stewards, and as\r\n     the car (containing four prominent suffragettes) slowed, they\r\n     rushed furiously towards it, shouting and tearing up sods from the\r\n     road and pelting the women with them. One man pulled out a knife\r\n     and began to cut the tires, whilst the others feverishly pulled\r\n     the loose pieces off with their fingers. The suffragettes tried to\r\n     quiet them with a few words of explanation, but their only reply\r\n     was to pull the hood of the motor over the women’s heads and then\r\n     to beat it and batter it until it was broken in several places.\r\n     Then they tore at the women’s clothes and tried to pull them out\r\n     of the car, whilst the son of the gentleman in whose ground the\r\n     meeting was being held drove up in another motor and threw a\r\n     shower of pepper in the women’s eyes.... The only excuse for the\r\n     stewards who took part in this extraordinary occurrence is that\r\n     many of them were intoxicated.”[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the most pitiful part of the business was that such conduct seemed\r\nto be regarded by its perpetrators as engaging pieces of gallantry.\r\n\r\nWhile a recitation of these incidents might be continued indefinitely,\r\none more will suffice to show with what contempt and dishonor the\r\nwestern world has treated its women. On August 2, 1909, a great\r\nLiberal fete was held at Canford Park, near Poole in Dorsetshire. There\r\nwere sports and games and Mr. Churchill was to deliver an address on\r\nthe budget. Annie Kenney with three companions attended the fete, and\r\nthe story of what took place is best told in her own words. She says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “As we entered the Park together we saw two very young girls being\r\n     dragged about by a crowd of Liberal men, some of whom were old\r\n     enough to be their fathers. They had thrown a pig net over them,\r\n     and had pulled down their hair. We heard afterward that these\r\n     girls came from a village near by, but the Liberals suspected them\r\n     to be Suffragettes and ordered them out of the Park. ..., but they\r\n     were crowded round us and the language they used is not fit for\r\n     print.... They were calling out to each other to get hold of me\r\n     and throw me into the pond which was very near ..., but as soon\r\n     as my back was turned they started dragging me about in a most\r\n     shameful way. One man who was wearing the Liberal colours pulled a\r\n     knife out of his pocket, and to the delight of the other staunch\r\n     Liberals, started cutting my coat. They cut it into shreds right\r\n     from the neck downwards. Then they lifted up my coat and started\r\n     to cut my frock and one of them lifted up my frock and cut my\r\n     petticoat. This caused great excitement. A cry came from those\r\n     Liberals, who are supposed to have high ideas in public life, to\r\n     undress me. They took off my hat and pulled down my hair, but I\r\n     turned round upon them and said that it would be their shame and\r\n     not mine. They stopped then for a minute, and then two men, also\r\n     wearing the Liberal colours, got hold of me and lifted me up and\r\n     afterwards dragged me along, not giving me an opportunity to walk\r\n     out in a decent way.”[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroism and rare genius of Mrs. E. Pankhurst and her associates\r\nin the suffragette movement will be acknowledged by their friends and\r\nfoes alike. Through their sufferings they have bequeathed to women of\r\nthe western world the priceless heritage of Freedom, and thus pushed\r\nthe progress of the human race a long step forward. Mrs. Pankhurst\r\npossessed, undoubtedly, a firm character, a lofty mind, a generous\r\nheart, strong and vigorous good sense. We shall call the emancipator\r\nof English womanhood a great woman, using that word not as a cheap,\r\nunmeaning title but as conveying three essential elements of greatness,\r\nnamely, unselfishness, honesty, and boldness. She who sacrificed\r\neverything for the voice of justice and submitted herself and her three\r\nyoung daughters to cruel indignities and hardships of jail life for\r\nthe sake of her fellow creatures was an unselfish, an honest, a bold\r\nwoman,--was a great woman--in the best sense of the word. And at this\r\ndistant time as a proof of our honest affection and admiration for her\r\ngoodness and virtue, we can afford to express a feeling of mingled\r\nsorrow and joy at her prolonged sufferings and final success.\r\n\r\nIn India, on the contrary, in the development of their wonderful\r\ncivilization men and women have played an equal part. The two sexes\r\nhave worked side by side in every branch of their spiritual endeavor,\r\nand women have attained the same eminence as men in higher learning.\r\nThe Vedic hymns mention both men and women as divine revealers of Truth\r\nand as spiritual instructors of mankind. In fact, The Rig Veda, the\r\nearliest scriptural record of the world, contains hymns revealed by\r\nwomen; and the Hindu god, Indra, is described as being initiated into\r\nthe knowledge of the Universal Spirit by the woman Aditi. Furthermore,\r\nthe Upnishads, the philosophical portion of the Veda, frequently\r\nmention the names of women who discoursed on philosophical topics\r\nwith the most learned men philosophers of the times. Women scholars\r\nwere often appointed arbitrators and umpires in important philosophic\r\ndebates, and the names of the two women philosophers, Gargi and\r\nMaitreyi, are familiar to all students of Hindu philosophy. In other\r\nwords, the paths of intellectual culture were equally open to men and\r\nwomen, under exactly similar circumstances. In fact, the very spirit of\r\nsuch equality is inculcated in the minds of the people from both their\r\nlaw and their religion that made no distinction between the sexes in\r\nthe award of honors for merit. The law-givers of India, taking their\r\nlessons from the Vedas, established the fundamental equality of man and\r\nwoman by defining the relation of the sexes thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Before the creation of this phenomenal universe, the first born\r\n     Lord of all creatures divided his own self into two halves, so\r\n     that one half should be male and the other half female.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only in the direction of scholarly pursuits, but in the\r\npractical business affairs of the world also, the women of India\r\nhave distinguished themselves eminently as legislators, ministers,\r\ncommercial leaders, and military commanders. Men, women, and children\r\nthroughout India are familiar with the story of Queen Chand Bibi, who\r\ndefended Ahmedanagar during the long siege by the Grand Moghul; poets\r\nalso have sung of her valor and administrative wisdom. Another instance\r\nof the recognition of the ability of women is the story of Nur Jahan\r\n(Light of the Universe), the beautiful queen of the Moghul Emperor,\r\nJahangir, who guided the affairs of her husband’s vast territories\r\nin a highly efficient manner for a period of nearly ten years.\r\nFurther, and well known to all students of history, is the story of\r\nMumtaz-i-Mahal, Emperor Shah Jahan’s consort, who assisted him in his\r\nworks of administration and in the construction of the famous buildings\r\nof his period. This woman, described as a person of unexampled\r\ndignity, delicacy, and charm, during her life-time was the “light of\r\nhis eyes,” and after death the perpetual source of inspiration to the\r\nbereaved Emperor. On her death-bed, Mumtaz, the beloved companion of\r\nhis life’s happy days and mother of his six children, asked of Shah\r\nJahan that a memorial befitting a queen be placed over her grave. In\r\ncompliance with this request, and as a token of his unceasing love for\r\nthe deceased queen, the Emperor constructed on her grave the famous\r\nTaj Mahal--a monument which by its beauty has made immortal the love\r\nit commemorates. The most beautiful building in the world stands as a\r\nmemorial to man’s love for his wife--an unconquerable love, unbroken\r\nand unsatisfied. Says Sir Edwin Arnold:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “He has immortalised--if he could not preserve alive for one brief\r\n     day--his peerless wife.... Admiration, delight, astonishment blent\r\n     in the absorbed thought with a feeling that human affection never\r\n     struggled more ardently, passionately and triumphantly against the\r\n     Oblivion of Death. There is one sustained, harmonious, majestic\r\n     sorrowfulness of pride in it, from the verse on the entrance\r\n     which says that ‘the pure of heart shall enter the Gardens\r\n     of God’, to the small, delicate letters of sculptured Arabic\r\n     upon the tombstone which tell, with a refined humility, that\r\n     Mumtaz-i-Mahal, the ‘Exalted of the Palace’, lies here, and that\r\n     ‘Allah alone is powerful.’”[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroic command of her own forces by the Rani (Queen) of Jhansi\r\nduring the Indian War of Independence in 1857 is a familiar and more\r\nrecent example of a woman entering into practical affairs. Clad in a\r\nman’s uniform, she rode at the head of her troops, and died a brave\r\nand patriotic death in the battlefield. The name of Rani Jhansi is\r\nmentioned among the renowned heroes of the country, and as a special\r\ntribute to her loving memory her picture in a general’s uniform is\r\nkept in many homes. Indian society is not opposed to the active\r\nparticipation of its women in the higher affairs of their national\r\nlife. If the positive declarations of a group of western critics to\r\nthe contrary were true, the action of Rani Jhansi would be condemned\r\ninstead of being so universally applauded as it is now by even the most\r\northodox of old Hindu ladies.\r\n\r\nThroughout the long history of India, then, women have not been\r\nhampered by any man-made restrictions from serving in the country’s\r\nreligious life, from fighting on its battlefields, and from holding\r\npower in its councils. In the present generation we find women again\r\ntaking an active and important part in the affairs of the country.\r\nThey have the fullest freedom for self-expression, of which they\r\nseem to have availed themselves in a highly creditable and fitting\r\nmanner, without sacrificing the admiration and respect of the men. In\r\ntimes of their country’s need they have given proofs of patriotism\r\nby self-sacrifice which speaks the language of love and devotion to\r\nmotherland. With a voluntary desire to coöperate, the men of India have\r\ngiven to the women of the country a large share in its councils, and\r\nhave invited them to their national conferences of importance. In the\r\ninner and more weighty deliberations of its leaders their influence is\r\nevident, and on all occasions of national demonstration the women of\r\nIndia are represented.\r\n\r\nShrimati Lajiavati--a frail, delicate figure, but a beautiful model of\r\nwomanly courage and dignity--has won for herself in the Punjab a place\r\nwhich is closely akin to worship. She founded, and is now managing as\r\nits principal, the Arya Samaj Kanya Mahavidyala (girls’ school) in\r\nJallundhar City, Punjab. Another example of India’s modern women, who\r\nstands high in her countrymen’s esteem, is Shrimati Ramabai Ranade.\r\nHer work as the secretary of Seva Sadhan, a society for social service\r\nwork among the women of the country, has been amply recognized. During\r\nthe debate over the women’s suffrage bill in the Bombay Legislative\r\nCouncil, one honorable member remarked amid the greatest applause of\r\nthe season: “There is no Council which would not be honored, graced,\r\nand helped by the presence of such a woman as one who is known to us\r\nall, Mrs. Ramabai Ranade.” Mrs. Margaret E. Cousins, describing her\r\ninterview with Mrs. Ranade, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I asked her, ‘What do you think of the future of women in India?’\r\n     ‘It is full of hope and promise’, she replied, and in doing so\r\n     spontaneously took my hand and pressed it. It touches a Westerner\r\n     when her Eastern sister does that. It bridges gulfs and knits the\r\n     human sisterhood together. Like Mirabai of the poet’s intuition she\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Wears little hands_\r\n       _Such as God makes to hold big destinies._\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Her hands revealed her soul, for in their touch was soft\r\n     sweetness and strong vitality which still inspire me, and which\r\n     promise the blessing of her remarkable powers of service to\r\n     humanity for years to come.”[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the Indian whose heart does not beat with joy at the mention\r\nof Mrs. Sarojini Naidu? Who does not remember with feelings of proud\r\nexultation the name of this beloved and revered sister--she who is the\r\nsymbol of patriotism and a flower of womanly beauty and culture, from\r\nwhose elevated soul radiate grace, charm, and affection, and who is\r\nthe object of her countrymen’s adoration? In 1925, in recognition of\r\nher manifold virtues, the people of India exalted her to the highest\r\nposition at their command; she was unanimously elected President of the\r\nIndian National Congress.[9] _In the entire history of mankind no woman\r\nhas been more highly honored by her countrymen than has Mrs. Sarojini\r\nNaidu._ Read her poems and you will find the heart of a woman forever\r\nseeking the satisfaction of hungry love:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “_Hide me in a shrine of roses,_\r\n     _Drown me in a wine of roses,_\r\n     _Drawn from every fragrant grove!_”\r\n\r\n\r\nListen to her musical eloquence on the nationalist platform of India,\r\nand you will hear the cry of a patriot’s heart groaning under the load\r\nof its country’s humiliation from the merciless foreign yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Our arts have degenerated, our literatures are dead, our\r\n     beautiful industries have perished, our valor is done, our fires\r\n     are dim, our soul is sinking.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA more striking proof of the confidence and respect which the men of\r\nIndia bear towards their women was given during the debates on women’s\r\nsuffrage bills in the provincial legislative councils of the country.\r\nThe Southborough Franchise Committee, which was formed to study the\r\ngeneral conditions in the country with a view to granting the franchise\r\nto the people of India, in its report to the British Government of\r\nIndia (1919) had expressed its decision against granting the franchise\r\nto Indian women. This decision was upheld by the British Government\r\nof India in the statement, “In the present conditions of India we\r\nagree with them [the Southborough Committee] that it is not practical\r\nto open the franchise to women.” To this decision of the Government\r\nSir C. Sankaran Nair, the Indian member of the Executive Council,\r\nentered a strong protest, based on the strength of the evidence which\r\nwas presented before the Southborough Committee in favor of granting\r\nfranchise to women. His contention, furthermore, was upheld by the\r\nresolution passed at two successive sessions of the Indian National\r\nCongress (Calcutta 1917 and Delhi 1918). This resolution expressed in\r\nan unequivocal manner the opinion of the Indian nation on the important\r\nquestion of woman franchise as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Women possessing the same qualifications as are laid down in any\r\n     part of the [Reform] Scheme shall not be disqualified on account\r\n     of sex.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA tremendous agitation was staged in India after the publication of the\r\ndispatch of the Government of India, unfavorable to women’s rights. As\r\na result of this agitation a provision was made whereby the provincial\r\nlegislatures were given the power to admit or exclude women from\r\nfranchise at their individual options. True to their traditions and\r\nfollowing the teaching of their ancient as well as their modern seers\r\nthe majority of the provinces have already granted the franchise to\r\nwomen on the same basis as to men. This experience is unequalled in the\r\nentire history of mankind. Everywhere else where the women enjoy any\r\nrights to vote or possess property, they have had to fight a battle\r\ninvolving prolonged hardships and outrageous indignities imposed upon\r\nthem by the indignant and oftentimes barbarous ruling sex. India is\r\nthe only civilized country of the world in which women in modern times\r\nhave been granted franchise on an equality with men without a single\r\ndemonstration of insult or disrespect directed against its aspiring\r\nwomanhood. If for no other reason, the respect which the people of\r\nIndia have shown to the desire of their women for the franchise,\r\nshould entitle them to a high place in the scale of civilization.\r\n\r\nMrs. Margaret E. Cousins is an international figure in the woman’s\r\nsuffrage movement, in which cause she has suffered imprisonments\r\nin both Ireland and England. She is also the founder and Honorary\r\nSecretary of the Women’s Indian Association with its fifty branches\r\nspread over the country, and has lived for twelve years among the women\r\nof India with relations of intimate friendship. Mrs. Cousins is not in\r\nany sense of the word addicted to indiscriminate flattery, but she says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Turning then to India one finds that though the percentage\r\n     of education is appallingly low, the tradition of Indian law\r\n     leaves women very free to take any position for which they show\r\n     themselves capable. No Indian political organisations were at any\r\n     time closed to women. Women have at every stage of Indian history\r\n     taken high positions in their country’s public service. Springing\r\n     from their religious philosophy there is fundamentally a belief\r\n     in sex equality, and this shows itself when critical periods\r\n     demand it. This has been clearly shown during the movement of the\r\n     past ten years for self-government. Women have had their share\r\n     in all the local Conferences and in the National Congress. No\r\n     one who was present can easily forget the sight of the platform\r\n     at the Calcutta Congress of 1917 when three women leaders, Mrs.\r\n     Annie Besant, President of the Congress, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu,\r\n     representative of the Hindu women, and Bibi Ammam, mother of the\r\n     Ali brothers and representative of the Muslim women, sat side by\r\n     side, peeresses of such men leaders (also present) as Tilak,\r\n     Gandhi and Tagore, and receiving equal honor with them.”[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a distinct contribution towards the solution of the world’s social\r\nproblems, the _East Indians_, by allowing woman the exercise of her\r\nown free will and the entire responsibility of all her actions, have\r\nestablished the fact that a woman left completely to herself with\r\nopportunity to develop freely her instincts and faculties, may equal\r\nman in reason, wisdom, and uprightness, and may surpass him in delicacy\r\nand dignity.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu religion has always stood for the absolute equality of woman\r\nwith man. In matters religious as well as secular the Hindu woman has\r\nbeen considered the equal of man before the law since the origin of\r\nthe Hindu nation. The admission of women into American universities\r\nbegan only in recent times, while her partial equality in the sight\r\nof law, not yet quite complete, is less than twenty years old. But in\r\nIndia women have enjoyed such rights and many more since the beginning\r\nof its recorded history. To the western readers who have been very\r\ninjudiciously fed upon missionaries’ tales about India, with their\r\ncolorful pictures of the brutality of the heathen towards his women\r\nfolk, this statement may seem incredible. But it is an undisputed fact\r\nof history that since the beginning of Hindu law, woman in India has\r\nheld more legal rights to acquire knowledge, to hold office, and to\r\npossess property than her sisters in America are having today. She\r\nwas never barred from the national institutions of higher learning\r\nbecause of sex, and in the development of her intellectual, moral, and\r\nspiritual qualities she was not hampered by any social or religious\r\nlaws whatsoever. She has stood before law as an exact equal of man\r\nwith the same rights to possess property, the same rights to go\r\nbefore courts of justice and to ask the protection of law. The system\r\nof coeducation prevailed in the ancient universities of Nalanda and\r\nTakhshashila. It is a familiar fact known to all western scholars that\r\n_Sakuntala_, the heroine in Kalidasa’s drama of that name, pleaded her\r\nown case before the court of King Dushyanta. Indian women have fought\r\non battlefields alongside of men, have taken leading parts in their\r\nhistoric and philosophic debates, have revealed spiritual truths for\r\nthe _Vedas_, and have received, as personifications of the Deity, the\r\nworship from adoring millions. Above all else, the Indian women have\r\nruled over the hearts of their husbands and children throughout the\r\nages with a power that is born exclusively of purity in character, and\r\nthe spirit of self-sacrifice and love. They have held their dignity\r\nwith a poise which does the female sex a great credit.\r\n\r\nDoes Hindu religion sanction, then, the bondage of woman, and is\r\nwife-beating permitted in Indian society? Is the Hindu wife considered\r\nmerely as an instrument of pleasure, and is her whole ambition in life\r\nto be a passive and obedient servant of the husband?\r\n\r\nThe maxims which guide the conduct of Hindu society were laid down by\r\nthe great Law-giver Manu, in the year 200 B. C. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Where female relations live in grief, the family soon perishes;\r\n     but that family where they are not unhappy ever prospers.”\r\n\r\n     “A woman’s body must not be struck hard, even with a flower,\r\n     because it is sacred.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a nation which regularly listens to readings from epic poems of\r\nRamayana and Mahabharata morning and night on every day of the year,\r\nand on whose lips the praises of Sita, the ideal wife (heroine in\r\nRamayana), dance forever, should be carried away by the desire of\r\nill-treating its womankind, as is actually believed by most westerners,\r\nis simply inconceivable. Sita’s equal as a model of womanly chastity,\r\nuprightness, kindness, and devotion has not been known in the history\r\nof mankind. The story of her exile with her husband, King Rama, her\r\nfidelity, and her spirituality is known to every child born in India;\r\nwhile her character is set as an example before all Hindu women in the\r\ncountry. With such ideals as these constantly before their minds, and\r\nthe moral influence of the peaceful, chaste family life always around\r\nthem, women of any nation will develop within themselves a power which\r\nit will be impossible for any group of men, however foul and vicious,\r\nto resist. And it must be remembered that the men of India, slow as\r\nthey are in catching the militaristic spirit of the competitive western\r\nlife, are to an exceptional degree spiritual and religious in their\r\ngeneral behavior. Sir Monier-Williams says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Religion of some kind enters largely into their [East Indian]\r\n     everyday life. Nay, it may even be said that religious ideas and\r\n     aspirations--religious hopes and fears--are interwoven with the\r\n     whole texture of their mental constitution. A clergyman, who has\r\n     resided nearly all his life in India, once remarked to me that\r\n     he had seen many a poor Indian villager whose childlike trust in\r\n     his god, and in the efficacy of his religious observances--whose\r\n     simplicity of character and practical application of his creed,\r\n     put us Christians to shame.”[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, in describing the general character of the Hindu women and\r\ntheir family life, he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Hindu women must be allowed full credit for their strict\r\n     discharge of household duties, for their personal cleanliness,\r\n     thrift, activity, and practical fidelity to the doctrines and\r\n     precepts of their religion. They are generally loved by their\r\n     husbands, and are never brutally treated. A wife-beater drunkard\r\n     is unknown in India. In return, Indian wives and mothers are\r\n     devoted to their families. I have often seen wives in the act of\r\n     circumambulating the sacred _Tulsi_ plant 108 times, with the sole\r\n     object of bringing down a blessing on their husband and children.\r\n     In no other country in the world are family affection and\r\n     reverence for parents so conspicuously operative as in India. In\r\n     many households the first morning duty of a child on rising from\r\n     sleep is to lay his head on his mother’s feet in token of filial\r\n     obedience. Nor could there be a greater mistake than to suppose\r\n     that Indian women are without influence.”[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Max Müller--_What India Can Teach Us_.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir Monier-Williams--_Modern India and the Indians_, page 353.\r\n\r\n[3] Oman--_The Great Indian Epics_.\r\n\r\n[4] E.

These\r\nwriters have tried to show that child marriage is the result of a law\r\nof the Hindu religion, which, according to them, strictly enjoins the\r\nparents to enforce the marriage of their daughters at a tender age\r\nunder penalty of heavenly vengeance. They say that the law enjoins that\r\ngirls shall be married before the age of puberty, and, as a result,\r\nthe majority of Hindu girls become mothers nine months after reaching\r\npuberty. One such writer[13] picks a few lines from the Hindu poet\r\nTagore’s essay in Keyserling’s _Book of Marriage_, and, mutilating its\r\ntext by clever omissions, misquotes it to prove the poet a defender of\r\nchild marriage. This unholy attempt of the author to misrepresent the\r\nnoted poet and philosopher deserves strong censure. In this chapter we\r\nshall discuss the facts about marriage in India and its allied subject\r\nof child marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu religion strictly forbids child marriage. The following\r\nquotation from the Rig Veda explains the ideal of marriage:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Woman is to be man’s comrade in life, his _Sakhi_, with the\r\n     same range of knowledge and interests, mature in body, mind and\r\n     understanding, able to enter into a purposeful union on equal\r\n     terms with a man of equal status, as life partner, of her own free\r\n     choice, both dedicating their lifework as service to the divine\r\n     Lord of the Universe, both ready to fulfil the purpose of married\r\n     life from the day of marriage onward.”[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe western method of marriage through courtship is, however, not the\r\nrule in India. Though the courtship method is being widely copied among\r\nthe educated classes in the country, the prevailing custom of marriage\r\nis still through the choice of parents. In earlier times marriage\r\nby the _Svayambara_ system, in which the maiden freely selected her\r\nfuture mate from a group of suitors, was commonly practised. This\r\npractice was discontinued, however, with the invasion of India by the\r\nforeigners because of the desire of the Indians to keep the pure Aryan\r\nstock uncontaminated by foreign blood. Since that time the boys and\r\ngirls are mated through the choice of their parents. This custom may be\r\ndefended on wide social and eugenic grounds. The contention is that the\r\ncomplete dominance of sentiment and individual desire in the courtship\r\nmethod of marriage, is harmful to social discipline, and is, as a rule,\r\ndetrimental to the race. Marriage is a sacred bond and must be based\r\non an ideal of the spiritual union of the souls, and not on the lower\r\ndesires for sense pleasures.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the reader to understand fully the principles\r\nunderlying Hindu marriage it will be necessary to acquaint him with\r\nthe fundamental characteristics which form the basis of the social\r\nstructure of group life in India. One distinctive feature in the study\r\nof India is the collective character of its communal life. Hindu\r\nsociety was established on a basis of group morality. Society was\r\ndivided into different classes or communities; “and while no absolute\r\nethical code was held binding on all classes alike, yet within a given\r\nclass (or caste) the freedom of the individual must be subordinated\r\nto the interest of the group. The concept of duty was paramount.”[15]\r\nSocial purpose must be served first, and the social order was placed\r\nbefore the happiness of the individual, whether man or woman.\r\n\r\nIn India the origin of marriage did not lie in passion. Marriage was\r\nentered into, not to satisfy desire on the part of either man or\r\nwoman, but to fulfill a purpose in life. It was the duty of every\r\nindividual during life to marry and propagate for the continuation of\r\nthe race. His marital union did not depend upon the caprice of his\r\nwill; it was required of him as a social obligation. No individual’s\r\nlife was considered complete without an offspring. To both man and\r\nwoman marriage was the most conclusive of all incidents in life; it was\r\nthe fulfillment of one’s whole being. Marriage was not sought as the\r\nsatisfaction of human feelings but as “the fulfilment of a ritual duty\r\nto the family in its relation to the Divine Spirit.” “The happiness\r\nand fruition of family life were sought not in the tumults of passion,\r\nbut in the calm and ordered affection of a disciplined and worshipful\r\npair.” That strong sexual passion which has been so beautifully\r\nsanctified by the grace of poetry and hallowed by the name of romantic\r\nlove, and which is the source of immense force and power in many a\r\nyoung life in the West, is called by the Hindu idealist “an earthly\r\ndesire and an illusion.”\r\n\r\nLove as an expression of sentiment is transitory. People who once\r\nfall in love may after some time and for similar reasons fall out of\r\nlove. Hence if the ideal basis for the union of the sexes is to be\r\nmutual passion, an arrangement must be provided so that simultaneously\r\nwith a break in the fascination on either side, the marriage between\r\nthe parties shall come to an end. Yet under the existing conditions\r\nover the entire civilized world it would not be possible to make the\r\nmarriage laws as lax as that. So long as such an arrangement remains\r\nuntried, and so long as there is any truth in the statement that human\r\nhearts are to a high degree fickle, it must follow that successful\r\nmarriages should have other sources of lasting satisfaction than\r\nromantic love. On observation, we find that most marriages, which were\r\nentered into on the strict principle of mutual love, hold together from\r\nhabit, from considerations of prudence, and from duty towards children\r\nlong after lovers’ joy has totally disappeared from the lives of the\r\ncouple. The glimmer of first love very soon fades into nothingness.\r\nCloser acquaintance brings to light faults which the lover’s eyes in\r\ndays of romance had stubbornly refused to see. Unless the parties\r\nare possessed of sensitive souls, unless after a serious search for\r\na foothold they find a basis of common interest and common hobbies,\r\nand unless their mutuality of temperament is found adequate for\r\nfriendship, there is left for their future relationships no happiness.\r\nWhy, then, excite one’s imagination in the beginning, and permit\r\noneself to be deluded by such obviously foolish hopes?\r\n\r\nThe Hindu system of marriage reverses these considerations. There,\r\nmarriage is a form of vocation, a fulfillment of a social duty, it is\r\nnot the enjoyment of individual rights. In its ethics, designed for\r\nthe communal basis of life, individual desire and pleasures must be\r\nsubordinated to the interest of group morality. “Thus the social order\r\nis placed before the happiness of the individual, whether man or woman.\r\nThis is the explanation of the greater peace which distinguishes the\r\narranged marriage of the East from the self-chosen marriage of the\r\nWest; where there is no deception there can be no disappointment.”[16]\r\n\r\nIn this manner the champions of the system justify the Indian method of\r\nmarriage, in which marriages are arranged by the parents or relatives.\r\nBut, however ably its partisans may defend the old system, and in\r\nwhatever glowing colors they may exhibit its spiritual values, it\r\nmust go sooner or later. With changing times the ideals that govern\r\nIndian society have changed also. Men and women of the present day are\r\ndemanding their individual freedom after the fashion of their brothers\r\nand sisters in the West. Rightly or wrongly, they feel a desire to\r\nexpress themselves according to the spontaneous dictates of the\r\nheart. Simultaneously with the industrialization of the country the\r\nrestraints put upon the individual from outside through the medium of\r\nsocial and religious laws are fast disappearing. The younger generation\r\nof the Indian nation appears more concerned for rights than for duties.\r\n\r\nThose who care may lament over the past, but we shall welcome the\r\nchange with joy, because it brings new light and new hope into the\r\nstereotyped and set system of Indian life. Marriage in human society is\r\nafter all nothing but a plunge into the unknown ocean of the future.\r\nIts ultimate outcome alone can tell whether the entrants were destined\r\nto sink or swim.[17] Marriage has been a lottery in the past, and it\r\nwill remain so in the future, unless our lives are so modulated as\r\nto give to the forces of the spirit a larger and a freer scope. It\r\nis impious blasphemy to seek to stifle the celestial senses, instead\r\nof guiding and harmonizing them. It is hoped, however, that in their\r\nnew role as imitators of the West, men of India will not change their\r\nattitude of tenderness, confidence, respect, and delicacy towards the\r\nfemale sex; and that the women of India will retain the calmness and\r\ndignity of their attitude, the self-respect and poise of their inner\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAll classes in India idolize motherhood. Among no people in the world\r\nare mothers more loved, honored, and obeyed than among Indians. It\r\nmight be interesting to point out that a pregnant woman in India\r\nhas nothing of which to be ashamed or which she wishes to hide.\r\nShe is considered auspicious and must be accorded high respect and\r\nconsideration. We sometimes believe that the East Indian’s high\r\ngood humor and calm in life are the fruits of the Indian mother’s\r\nunusual cheer and hope during the period of pregnancy. How unlike\r\nthe attitude of the Indian is to the westerner’s silly notions of\r\nbeauty, fine shape, and grace wherein pregnancy is made an object of\r\nmore or less open ridicule. Would that the women of America and other\r\nwestern countries would forsake their restlessness and nervousness and\r\nlearn from their humbler eastern sisters the art of possessing poise,\r\ncomposure, and serenity! Would that they would imitate the eastern\r\nmother’s delicate benevolence, generosity of heart, loftiness of mind,\r\nand independence and pride of character!\r\n\r\nThis subject of marriage is so important a matter to India that we\r\ndesire to elucidate still further the ideals underlying it. We shall\r\nquote at length from Keyserling’s _Book of Marriage_ an essay by\r\nTagore, than whom no one is better fitted to speak. Says Tagore:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Another way for the better understanding by the European of the\r\n     mentality underlying our marriage system would be by reference to\r\n     the discussions on eugenics which are a feature of modern Europe.\r\n     The science of eugenics, like all other sciences, attaches but\r\n     little weight to personal sentiment. According to it, selection by\r\n     personal inclination must be rigorously regulated for the sake of\r\n     the progeny. If the principle involved be once admitted, marriage\r\n     needs must be rescued from the control of the heart, and brought\r\n     under the province of the intellect; otherwise insoluble problems\r\n     will keep on arising, for passion recks not of consequences, nor\r\n     brooks interference by outside judges.\r\n\r\n     “Here the question arises: If desire be banished from the very\r\n     threshold of marriage, how can love find any place in the wedded\r\n     life? Those who have no true acquaintance with our country, and\r\n     whose marriage system is entirely different, take it for granted\r\n     that the Hindu marriage is loveless. But do we not know of our own\r\n     knowledge how false is such a conclusion?\r\n\r\n     “ ... Therefore, from their earliest years, the husband as an\r\n     idea is held up before our girls, in verse and poetry, through\r\n     ceremonial and worship. When at length they get this husband, he\r\n     is to them not a person but a principle, like loyalty, patriotism,\r\n     or such other abstractions which owe their immense strength to the\r\n     fact that the best part of them is our own creation and therefore\r\n     part of our own being.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poet then offers his own personal contribution to the discussion of\r\nthe marriage question generally and concludes thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “This _shakti_, this joy-giving power of woman as the beloved, has\r\n     up to now largely been dissipated by the greed of man, who has\r\n     sought to use it for the purposes of his individual enjoyment,\r\n     corrupting it, confining it, like his property, within jealously\r\n     guarded limit. That has also obstructed for woman herself her\r\n     inward realization of the full glory of her own _shakti_. Her\r\n     personality has been insulted at every turn by being made to\r\n     display its power of delectation within a circumscribed arena. It\r\n     is because she has not found her true place in the great world\r\n     that she sometimes tries to capture man’s special estate as a\r\n     desperate means of coming into her own. But it is not by coming\r\n     out of her home that woman can gain her liberty. Her liberation\r\n     can only be effected in a society where her true _shakti_, her\r\n     _ananda_ (joy) is given the widest and highest scope for its\r\n     activity. Man has already achieved the means of self-expansion in\r\n     public activity without giving up his individual concerns. When,\r\n     likewise, any society shall be able to offer a larger field for\r\n     the creative work of woman’s special faculty, without detracting\r\n     from her creative work in the home, then in such society will the\r\n     true union of man and woman become possible.\r\n\r\n     “The marriage system all over the world, from the earliest ages\r\n     till now, is a barrier in the way of such true union. That is why\r\n     woman’s _shakti_, in all existing societies, is so shamefully\r\n     wasted and corrupted. That is why in every country marriage is\r\n     still more or less of a prison-house for the confinement of\r\n     women--with all its guards wearing the badge of the dominant male.\r\n     That is why man, by dint of his efforts to bind woman, has made\r\n     her the strongest of fetters for his own bondage. That is why\r\n     woman is debarred from adding to the spiritual wealth of society\r\n     by the perfection of her own nature, and all human societies are\r\n     weighed down with the burden of the resulting poverty.\r\n\r\n     “The civilization of man has not, up to now, loyally recognized\r\n     the reign of the spirit. Therefore the married state is still one\r\n     of the most fruitful sources of the unhappiness and downfall of\r\n     man, of his disgrace and humiliation. But those who believe that\r\n     society is a manifestation of the spirit will assuredly not rest\r\n     in their endeavors till they have rescued human marriage relations\r\n     from outrage by the brute forces of society--till they have\r\n     thereby given free play to the force of love in all the concerns\r\n     of humanity.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the Hindu poet’s explanation of the ideals underlying the\r\ninstitution of marriage in the communal society of the Hindus. One\r\nfeels through his closing lines the poet’s sorrow at the sight of\r\nthe misery caused by a wrong conception of marriage throughout the\r\ncivilized world. The poet cherishes, however, the fond hope that a day\r\nof the reign of spirit will dawn over the world, when mankind will\r\nrecognize the necessity of giving to the forces of love a free play in\r\nthe wide concerns of life.\r\n\r\nMarriage in India involves two separate ceremonies. The first ceremony\r\nis the more elaborate, and judging from the permanent character of its\r\nobligations, the more important. It is performed amid much festivity\r\nand show. The bridal party, consisting of the bridegroom with his chief\r\nrelatives and friends, goes to the bride’s home in an elaborate musical\r\nprocession. There the party is handsomely feasted as guests of the\r\nbride for one or more days, according to the means of the host. The\r\ngroom furnishes the entertainment, which consists of music, acrobatic\r\ndancing, jugglers’ tricks, fireworks, and so forth. The day is spent\r\nin simple outdoor amusements like hunting, horseback riding, swimming,\r\nor gymnastic plays, the nature of the sport depending upon the\r\nsurroundings. In the evening, by the light of the fireworks, and in the\r\nmidst of a large crowd of near relatives and spectators, the ceremony\r\nof the “union,” namely, the spiritual unification of the near relatives\r\nof the bride and the bridegroom, is staged in a highly picturesque\r\nmanner. In order of their relation to the bride and groom--father of\r\nthe bride with the father of the bridegroom, first uncle of the one\r\nwith the first uncle of the other, and so forth--the near relatives\r\nof the future couple embrace each other and exchange head-dresses as\r\na symbol of eternal friendship. Each such pledge of friendship is\r\nbeautifully harmonized with a song and a blessing from the daughters\r\nof the village. Later in the evening, the girls lead the guests to the\r\nbridal feast, singing in chorus on their march the “Welcome Home.”\r\n\r\nMarriage in the Indian home is thus an occasion of great rejoicing.\r\nThe atmosphere that prevails throughout the entire ceremony is one of\r\nextreme wholesomeness and joy. Nothing could surpass the loveliness\r\nand charm that surrounds the evening march to the bridal feast. The\r\npretty maidens of the village, who are conscious of their dignity as\r\npersonifications of the Deity and are inspired with a devoted love for\r\ntheir sister bride, come in their gay festival dresses, with mingled\r\nfeelings of pride and modesty, to lead the procession with a song;\r\ntheir eyes moistened with slowly gathering tears of deep and chaste\r\nemotion, and their faces wrapped in ever changing blushes, give to\r\nthe whole picture a distinctive flavor of an inspiring nature. On the\r\nfollowing morning the couple are united in marriage by the officiating\r\npriest, who reads from the scriptures while the husband and wife pace\r\ntogether the seven steps. The vow of equal comradeship which is taken\r\nby both the husband and the wife on this occasion reads thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Become thou my partner, as thou hast paced all the seven steps\r\n     with me.... Apart from thee I cannot live. Apart from me do thou\r\n     not live. We shall live together; we each shall be an object\r\n     of love to the other; we shall be a source of joy each unto the\r\n     other; with mutual goodwill shall we live together.”[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony being over, the bridal party departs with the\r\nbride for the bridegroom’s home. On this first trip the bride is\r\naccompanied by a maid, and the two return home together after an\r\novernight’s stay. The bride then remains at her parental home until\r\nthe performance of the second ceremony. The interval between the two\r\nceremonies varies from a few days to several years, depending mainly\r\nupon the ages of the married couple and the husband’s ability to\r\nsupport a home.\r\n\r\nThis dual ceremonial has been the cause of a great deal of confusion\r\nin the western mind. To all appearances the first ceremony is the\r\nmore important as it is termed marriage. After it the bride begins to\r\ndress and behave like a married woman, but the couple do not begin\r\nto live together until the second ceremony has also been performed,\r\nand these two acts may be separated from each other by a considerably\r\nlong period. In other words the so-called marriage of the Hindu girl\r\nis nothing but “an indefeasible betrothal in the western sense.” The\r\ncustom of early marriage (or betrothal, to be more exact) has existed\r\nin some parts of the country from earlier times, but it became more\r\ncommon during the period of the Mohammedan invasions into India. These\r\nforeign invaders were in the habit of forcibly converting to Islam\r\nthe beautiful Hindu maidens, whom they later married. But no devout\r\nMohammedan ever injures or thinks evil towards a married woman. His\r\nreligion strictly forbids such practice. Thus, to safeguard the honor\r\nof their young daughters the Hindus adopted this custom of early\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s marriage, however, makes no change in her life. She\r\ncontinues to live with her parents as before, and is there taught under\r\nher mother’s supervision the elementary duties of a household. She is\r\ninstructed at the same time in other matters concerning a woman’s life.\r\nWhen she becomes of an age to take upon herself the responsibilities of\r\nmarried life, the second marriage ceremony is finished and she departs\r\nfor her new home.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the standard of education among East Indian women as\r\ncompared with that of other countries is appallingly low. We shall\r\nleave the discussion of the various political factors which have\r\ncontributed to this deplorable state of things for a later chapter.\r\nFor the present it will be sufficient to point out that even though\r\nthe Indian girl is illiterate and unable to read and write, she is not\r\nuninstructed or uninformed in the proper sense of the word education.\r\n\r\nShe knows how to cook, to sew, to embroider, and to do every other kind\r\nof household work. She is fully informed concerning matters of hygiene\r\nand sex. In matters intellectual her mind is developed to the extent\r\nthat “she understands thoroughly the various tenets of her religion and\r\nis quite familiar with Hindu legends and the subject matter in the epic\r\nliterature of India.”\r\n\r\nMy mother was the daughter of a village carpenter. She was brought up\r\nin the village under the exclusive guidance of her mother and did\r\nnot have any school education. Mother, in her turn, has reared seven\r\nchildren who have all grown to be perfectly healthy and normal boys and\r\ngirls. Even though we could easily afford a family doctor, we never had\r\none. Mother seemed to know so much about hygienic and medical science\r\nthat she did not need a doctor. Her little knowledge she had acquired\r\nfrom her own mother; it consisted of a few simple rules, which she\r\nobserved very faithfully. As little children, we were required to clean\r\nour teeth with a fresh twig, to be individually chewed into a brush,\r\nevery morning before breakfast, and to wash the mouth thoroughly with\r\nwater after each meal. For the morning teeth cleaning we were supplied\r\nwith twigs from a special kind of tree which leaves in the mouth a\r\nvery pleasant taste and contains juices of a beneficial nature. Also,\r\nchewing a small twig every morning gives good exercise to the teeth and\r\nfurnishes the advantage of a new brush each time. We were told that\r\ndirty teeth were unmannerly and hurt a person’s eyesight and general\r\nheath. A cold water bath once a day and washing of both hands before\r\nand after each meal were other fundamental requirements.\r\n\r\nFor every kind of family sickness, whether it was a headache, a\r\nfever, a cold in the head, or a bad cough, the prescription was\r\nalways the same. A mixture of simple herbs was boiled in water and\r\ngiven to the patient for drinking. Its only effect was a motion of\r\nthe bowels. It was not a purgative, but had very mild and wholesome\r\nlaxative properties without any after reactions. Fasting during\r\nsickness was highly recommended. In nearly every month occurred\r\nsome special festival day on which the whole family fasted. This\r\nfast had a purifying effect on the systems of growing children. As\r\nanother precautionary measure, my mother prepared for the children,\r\nevery winter, a special kind of preserve from a bitter variety of\r\nblack beans, which is supposed to possess powerful blood-purifying\r\nproperties. With the exception of quinine during malarial epidemics, we\r\nwere never given any drugs whatsoever. These simple medicines, combined\r\nwith a fresh vegetable diet for every day in the year, constituted my\r\nmother’s only safeguards against family sickness. And from my knowledge\r\nI know that her system worked miraculously well.\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy it is customary to surround the young girl with every\r\nprecaution. She returns to her parental home in order to secure freedom\r\nfrom sexual intercourse during that period. In the months before my\r\neldest sister bore her first child, I remember how she was instructed\r\nnot to permit herself to be excited in any way. Pictures of the ideal\r\nwife, _Sita_, and of national heroes and heroines were hung all over\r\nthe house for my sister to look at and admire. She was freed from all\r\nhousehold responsibilities in order that she could devote her time to\r\nreading good stories from the Hindu epics. Every kind of irritant,\r\nlike pepper and spices, was rigidly excluded from her diet, and after\r\nthe child was born she refrained from injudicious combinations of food\r\nuntil the child was a year or more old.\r\n\r\nEvery night at bedtime my mother had a new story to tell the children,\r\na story which she herself had heard at bedtime when she was young.\r\nThese stories were drawn from the great Hindu epics, and there was\r\nalways a useful maxim connected with them. The tale was told to bring\r\nhome to the growing children some moral maxim like truthfulness,\r\nfidelity to a pledge once given, conjugal happiness, and respect for\r\nparents. In this manner the children in the most ignorant homes become\r\nfamiliar with the ethical teachings of their nation and with the\r\nhypotheses underlying their respective religions. Almost everyone in\r\nIndia down to the most ignorant countrywoman understands the subtle\r\nmeaning of such intricate Hindu doctrines as the laws of _Karma_, the\r\ntheory of reincarnation, and the philosophy of _Maya_.\r\n\r\nAs was stated earlier in this chapter, much misinformation about the\r\nso-called child marriage has been spread by ignorant missionaries,\r\nand has been eagerly swallowed by most western readers. It may be\r\nwell to observe here that the two expressions “child marriage” and\r\n“early marriage” are very widely apart in meaning. The psychological\r\nimpressions conveyed by the two expressions are distinctly different.\r\nIf the first ceremony of the Hindu marriage is to be taken as meaning\r\nmarriage, what is practised in India perhaps more than anywhere else\r\nin the world is _early marriage_ and not child marriage. Even at that,\r\nearly marriage is essentially wrong in principle. Its usefulness in\r\nearlier times, when it was first recommended by the Hindu lawgivers as\r\na necessary measure to preserve the communal life of the nation, cannot\r\nbe denied.\r\n\r\nLike many other laws of those times, it has outlived its usefulness,\r\nand through the influence of many corruptions which have been added\r\nto the practice during ages, it has become a curse to the country.\r\nThis fact is frankly admitted by the leaders of modern India. In the\r\nwritings and speeches of the most prominent among them the custom of\r\nearly marriage has been condemned as a “deadly vermin in Hindu social\r\nlife,” and a “ghastly form of injustice.” Beginning with the days of\r\nthe eminent Hindu reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the whole literature\r\nof social and religious reform in India is full of loud and emphatic\r\ndenunciations of early marriage.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the untiring, self-sacrificing efforts of Hindu\r\nreformers a great measure of success has already been achieved. The\r\nHindu girl’s age of marriage has been steadily increasing during the\r\nlast fifty years. According to figures from the official Census Report\r\nof India (1921) only 399 out of every 1000 girls were married at the\r\nend of their fifteenth year. In other words, 60 per cent of Indian\r\ngirls remained unmarried at the beginning of their sixteenth year.\r\nMoreover, in the official records of India every girl who has passed\r\nthrough the first ceremony of her marriage is included in the married\r\nclass. If we allow a little further concession on account of the warmer\r\nclimate of India, which has the tendency to lower the age of maturity\r\nin girls, we shall concede that the present conditions in India in\r\nrespect to early marriage are not strikingly different from those in\r\nmost European countries. At the same time it must not be forgotten that\r\nin India sex life begins invariably after marriage, and never before\r\nmarriage. Those familiar with the conditions in the western countries\r\nknow that such is not always the rule there.\r\n\r\nOne evening the writer was talking in rather favorable terms to a small\r\ngroup of friends about the Hindu system of marriage. While several\r\nnodded their habitual, matter-of-fact, courteous assent, one young\r\nlady (Dorothy), a classmate and an intimate friend, suddenly said in\r\nan impatient tone, “This is all very foolish. By using those sweet\r\nexpressions in connection with the Hindu family life you do not mean to\r\ntell me that marriage between two strangers, who have never met in life\r\nbefore, or known each other, can be ever happy or just. ‘Felicity,’\r\n‘peace,’ ‘harmony,’ ‘wedded love,’ ‘idealization of the husband’--this\r\nis all bunk. That _you_ should approve the blindfold yoking together\r\nfor life of innocent children in indefeasible marriage, is outrageous.\r\nThe system is shocking; it is a sin against decency. It is war against\r\nthe most sacred of human instincts and emotions, and as such I shall\r\ncondemn it as criminal and uncivilized.” Yet the young lady was in no\r\nsense of the word unsympathetic or unfriendly to India. She is, and has\r\nalways been, a great friend and admirer of India.\r\n\r\nDorothy is not much of a thinker, but she is very liberal and likes to\r\nbe called a radical. You could discuss with her any subject whatsoever,\r\neven Free Love and Birth Control, with perfect ease and lack of\r\nrestraint. She is twenty-five years of age and unmarried. She has been\r\n“in love” several times, but for one reason or the other she has not\r\nyet found her ideal man. She would not tell this to everybody, but to\r\none of her boy friends, “whose big blue eyes had poetic inspiration\r\nin them,” and who seemed to be fine and good and true in every way,\r\nbetter than the best she had ever met before, and whom she loved quite\r\ngenuinely, she had given herself completely on one occasion. This\r\nhappened during a week-end trip to the mountains, and was the first\r\nand last of her sexual experience. She said it was the moral as well\r\nas the physical feast of her life. Later she saw him flirting in a\r\ndoubtful manner with a coarse Spanish girl, which made him loathsome in\r\nher eyes. Gradually her love for him began to dwindle, until it died\r\noff completely, leaving behind, however, a deep mortal scar in her\r\nspiritual nature. For a period, Dorothy thought she could never love\r\nany man again, until she began to admire a young college instructor in\r\na mild fashion. He is, however, “so kind and intelligent and different\r\nfrom the rest,” with a fine physique and handsome face--his powerful\r\nforehead setting so beautifully against his thick curly hair--that she\r\ncalls magnificent. It matters little that he is married, because she\r\nwrites him the most enchanting letters. Dorothy’s love for the handsome\r\nprofessor is platonic. She says it will exist forever, even though\r\nshe entertains no hope of ever marrying him. Yet while she talked\r\nabout her latest “ideal,” a stream of tears gathered slowly in her big\r\nluminous eyes. They were the tears of hopeless resignation. Dorothy is\r\nbeautiful, and possesses rare grace and charm of both body and mind.\r\nShe is well situated in the business world, and is not in want of men\r\nadmirers. But yet she is unhappy, extremely unhappy. She has had the\r\nfreedom, but no training to make proper use of it. While she was still\r\nin her early teens she started going on picnic parties with different\r\nboys. Under the impulse of youthful passion she learned to kiss any\r\none and every one in an indiscriminate fashion. This destroyed the\r\nsanctity of her own moral and spiritual nature, and also killed, at the\r\nsame time, her respect for the male sex. Sacredness of sex and respect\r\nfor man being thus destroyed in her early years, she could not easily\r\nfind an ideal husband in later life. If she had been a stupid creature\r\nwith no imagination and no deep finer feelings she would have fallen\r\nsuddenly in love anywhere--there to pass the rest of her humdrum and\r\njoyless existence in an everlasting stupor. Surely Dorothy did not\r\nremember her own tragedy when she condemned the lot of the Hindu girls\r\nin such vehement manner. Vanity is an ugly fault, yet it gives great\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nUnlike India, where from their very childhood girls are initiated\r\ninto matters of sex, and where the ideal of acquiring a husband and a\r\nfamily is kept before their minds from the beginning, American boys\r\nand girls are brought up in utter ignorance of every thing pertaining\r\nto sex. Sex is considered as something unclean, filthy, and nauseous,\r\nand so unworthy of the attention and thought of young children. And yet\r\nthere is no country in the world where sex is kept more prominently\r\nbefore the public eye in every walk of daily life than in America.\r\n_The first impression which a stranger landing in America gets is of\r\nthe predominance of sex in its daily life._ The desire of the American\r\nwoman to show her figure to what Americans call “the coarse eye of\r\nman,” expresses itself in short skirts and tight dresses. “American\r\nmovies are made with no other purpose in view than to emphasize\r\nsex.” A college professor was recently told by one of the six biggest\r\ndirectors of motion pictures in Hollywood, through whose hands passed\r\na business amounting to millions of dollars, that in making a motion\r\npicture sex must constantly be borne in mind. The story must be based\r\non that knowledge, scenes selected with this view, and the plot\r\nexecuted with that thought in mind. Vaudeville shows, one of America’s\r\nnational amusements, are nothing but a suggestive display of the\r\nbeautiful legs of young girls, who appear on the stage scantily dressed\r\nand touch their foreheads with the toes in a highly suggestive manner.\r\n\r\nThe writer was told by an elderly American lady that the American\r\nnational dances had a deep religious connotation. A spiritual thought\r\nmay exist behind American music, and its effect on the American\r\nyouth may be quite uplifting, but certainly such dances as the one\r\ncalled “Button shining dance,” in which a specially close posture is\r\nnecessary, was invented with no high spiritual end in view. A wholesale\r\npublic display of bare legs to the hips, and a close view of the rest\r\nof their bodies in tight bathing suits may be seen on the national\r\nbeaches. Young couples lie on the sands in public view closely locked\r\nin seemingly everlasting embraces.\r\n\r\nWhile all this may be very pure, innocent, harmless, and even uplifting\r\nin its hidden nature, its outward and more prevalent character\r\nindicates an almost vicious result of the ideal of bringing up the\r\nnation’s youth improperly instructed in matters of sex and its proper\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this anomalous condition in America resulting\r\nfrom the misinstruction regarding sex by its youth on the one hand,\r\nand the most exaggerated prominence given sex in its national life is\r\nparticularly disastrous and excessively humiliating. Using the word\r\nmoral in its popular conventional meaning, it may be very frankly said\r\nthat the morals of the American youth are anything but exemplary.\r\nJudge Ben B. Lindsey, who is fully authorized to speak on the subject\r\nfrom his experience as head of the Juvenile court in Denver for over\r\ntwenty-five years, and who is one of the keenest contemporary thinkers\r\nin America, has stated facts in his book, _The Revolt of Modern Youth_,\r\nwhich are appalling. He writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The first item in the testimony of the high school students is\r\n     that of all the youth who go to parties, attend dances, and ride\r\n     together in automobiles, more than 90 per cent indulge in hugging\r\n     and kissing. This does not mean that every girl lets _any_ boy hug\r\n     and kiss her, but that she _is_ hugged and kissed.\r\n\r\n     “The second part of the message is this. At least 50 per cent\r\n     of those who begin with hugging and kissing do not restrict\r\n     themselves to that, but go further, and indulge in other sex\r\n     liberties which, by all the conventions, are outrageously improper.\r\n\r\n     “Now for the third part of the message. It is this: Fifteen to\r\n     twenty-five per cent of those who begin with the hugging and\r\n     kissing eventually ‘go the limit.’ This does not, in most cases,\r\n     mean either promiscuity or frequency, but it happens.”[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis situation is alarming, and the leaders of the country must take\r\nimmediate notice of it. When fifteen to twenty-five girls out of every\r\nhundred in any country indulge in irresponsible sexual relationships\r\nbetween the ages of fifteen and eighteen, that country is not in a\r\nhealthy moral condition. The effect of these early sexual intimacies\r\nbetween young girls and boys is ruinous to their later spiritual\r\ngrowth. How the situation may be remedied is a serious problem, which\r\nis not the task of any foreigner, however honest and friendly, to solve.\r\n\r\nIt may be of value to point out here how the Hindu thinkers sought\r\nto control this situation. We quoted above the frank opinion of an\r\nAmerican college girl regarding the Hindu system of marriage. The\r\nill opinion of the Hindu system of marriage held by most westerners,\r\nsprings, however, not from their knowledge of the situation, but from\r\nits very novelty, and from the dissociation of the name romance from\r\nits system. The western method of marriage emphasizes freedom for\r\nthe individual, and as such its fundamental basis is both noble and\r\npraiseworthy. From the exercise of freedom have developed some of the\r\nfinest traits of character; freedom, in fact, has been the source of\r\ninspiration for the highest achievements of the human race. But freedom\r\nin sex relationship without proper knowledge transforms itself into\r\nlicense, as its exercise in the commercial relationships of the world\r\nwithout sympathy and vision develops into tyranny. An illustration of\r\nthe former consequence may be seen in the disastrous effect of the\r\nwrong kind of freedom on the morals of the American youth; the slums\r\nof the industrial world are the results of the _laissez faire_ policy\r\nwhen it is allowed to proceed unchecked, on its reckless career.\r\n\r\nIn India marriage is regarded as a necessity in life; in the case of\r\nwoman it is the most conclusive of all incidents, the one action to\r\nwhich all else in life is subsidiary. From marriage springs not only\r\nher whole happiness, but on it also depends the fulfilment of her very\r\nlife. Marriage to a woman is a sacrament--an entrance into the higher\r\nand holier regions of love and consecration--and motherhood is to her\r\na thing of pride and duty. From childhood she has been trained to be\r\nthe ideal of the husband whom marriage gives her. Dropping longingly\r\ninto the embrace of her husband with almost divine confidence in\r\nhis protection and love, she begins to look at the whole universe\r\nin a different light. “Are the heavens and the earth so suddenly\r\ntransformed? Do the birds and trees, the stars and the heavens above,\r\ntake on a more brilliant coloring, and the wind begin to murmur a\r\nsweeter music?” Or is it true that she is herself transformed at the\r\ngentle touch of him who is henceforth to be her lord?\r\n\r\nSo limitless is the power of human emotion that we can create in\r\nour own imagination scenes of a joyful existence, which, when they\r\nare finally realized, bring about miraculous changes in us almost\r\novernight. This miracle is no fiction; it is a reality. An overnight’s\r\nblissful acquaintance with her husband has altered the constitution of\r\nmany a girl’s body and given to her figure nobler curves. I have seen\r\nmy own sister given in marriage, a girl of 18, a slender, playful, fond\r\nchild with barely a sign of womanhood in her habits and carriage;\r\nand after a month when I went for a visit to her home I found it\r\ndifficult to recognize my own sister. How suddenly had the marital\r\nunion transformed her! In the place of a slender, sprightly girl was\r\nnow a plump woman with a blooming figure, seeming surcharged with\r\nradiant energy; in the place of a straight childish look in the eyes\r\nthere was a look of happiness, wisdom, understanding that was inspiring\r\nand ennobling. The atmosphere around my sister, once a girl, now a\r\nwoman, was of such a divine character and her appearance expressed\r\nsuch exquisite joy that I fell spontaneously into her arms, and before\r\nwe separated our eyes were wet with tears of joy. Seeing my sister so\r\nbeautiful and so happy, I was happy; and in her moment of supreme joy\r\nher brother, the beloved companion of early days, became doubly dear\r\nto her. Some moments in our lives are difficult, nay, impossible to\r\nforget. This experience was of so illuminating a nature that it is\r\nstill as vivid in my mind as if it had happened yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is very simple. In the mind of my sister, as in the\r\nmind of every other Indian girl, the idea of a husband had been\r\nuppermost since her very childhood. Around his noble appearance, fine\r\ncarriage, and handsome expression she must have woven many a beautiful\r\nstory. Each time she saw one of her girl friends given in marriage\r\nto a “flower-crowned bridegroom, dressed in saffron-colored clothes,\r\nriding in procession on a decorated horse,” and accompanied by music\r\nand festivity, she must have dreamed. And then when the ideal of her\r\nchildhood was realized, no wonder she found in his company that height\r\nof emotional exaltation which springs from the proper union of the\r\nsexes and is the noblest gift of God to man. The American girl thinks\r\nmy sister married a stranger, but she had married an ideal, a creation\r\nof her imagination, and a part of her own being.\r\n\r\nThe wise Hindu system which keeps the idea of a husband before the\r\ngirls from their childhood will not be easily understood by the\r\nconventional western mind. Those who consider sex as something “unclean\r\nand filthy” and have formed the conviction that its thoughts and its\r\nvery name must be strictly kept away from growing children must learn\r\ntwo fundamental truths. In the first place, nothing in sex is filthy or\r\nunclean; on the other hand, sex is “the purest and the loveliest thing\r\nin life and if properly managed is emotionally exalting and highly\r\nuplifting for our moral and spiritual development.”[20] Secondly, to\r\nimagine that by maintaining a conspiracy of silence on the subject\r\nof sex one can exclude its thought totally from the lives of growing\r\nchildren is to betray in the grossest form ignorance of natural laws.\r\n\r\nIn India, however, sex is considered a necessary part of a healthy\r\nindividual’s life; it is a sacred and a lovely thing; and, as such,\r\nit is to be carefully examined and carefully cultivated. The sexual\r\nimpulse is recognized as the strongest of human impulses, and any\r\nattempt to thwart it by outside force must result in disaster to the\r\nindividual and in ruin to social welfare. To overcome sex hunger by\r\nkeeping people ignorant of it is the meanest form of hypocrisy. To deny\r\nfacts is not to destroy them. It is not only stupid but cowardly to\r\nimagine that one could make people moral and spiritual by keeping them\r\nignorant and superstitious. Show them the light, and they will find\r\ntheir own way. Teach children the essentials of life, encourage in them\r\nthe habit of independent thought, show them by example and precept the\r\nbeauties of moral grandeur, and they will develop within themselves the\r\ngood qualities of self-respect and self-restraint which will further\r\ninsure against many pitfalls. Says the Hindu proverb: “A woman’s best\r\nguard is her own virtue.” Virtue is a thing which must spring from\r\nwithin and can never be imposed from the outside.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere in the Hindu household and the attitude of the elder\r\nmembers of the family to each other is of such a nature that the boys\r\nand girls gradually become aware of the central facts of nature. In\r\nfact, no attempt is made to hide from the children anything about their\r\nlife functions. The subjects of marriage and child birth are freely\r\ndiscussed in the family gatherings. Children are never excluded when\r\na brother or sister is born, and no one tells them stories of little\r\nbabies brought in baskets by the doctors or by storks. Whenever the\r\ngrowing children ask curious questions about physiological facts, they\r\nare given the necessary information to the extent that it will be\r\nintelligible to them.\r\n\r\nThe experience in India has clearly demonstrated the fact that if young\r\nboys and girls are properly instructed in the laws of nature, and if\r\nthe knowledge is backed up by the right kind of moral stimulus and\r\nidealism, these young people can be relied upon to develop invincible\r\npowers of self-restraint and self-respect. Such boys and girls will\r\nhave noble aspirations and will grow into fine-spirited men and women\r\nof healthy moral character and of unquestionable poise.\r\n\r\nThe writer has no desire to eulogize the Hindu system of marriage, or\r\nto disparage the Occidental. An attempt has been made to diagnose the\r\nprevalent consequences of two systems. The Hindu customs certainly\r\nneed modification in view of the rapid economic and social changes;\r\nthe western system displays a deplorable lack of adjustment to new\r\nconditions in those countries. The writer merely asks the reader to\r\nremember that just because a system is different, it need not be\r\noutrageous.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Katherine Mayo.\r\n\r\n[14] Quoted from Cousins--_Awakening of Asian Womanhood_, page 40.\r\n\r\n[15] Coomaraswamy.\r\n\r\n[16] Coomaraswamy--_Dance of Siva_, page 88.\r\n\r\n[17] Tagore.\r\n\r\n[18] Quoted from Cousins--_The Awakening of Asian Womanhood_, page 38.\r\n\r\n[19] Pages 56, 59, 62.\r\n\r\n[20] Ben B. Lindsey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CIVILIZATION AND ETHICS OF INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of Hindu culture is its femininity. While the\r\nnorthern branch of the Aryan family represented by the European group\r\nhad to undergo hard struggle with unyielding nature on account of a\r\nbarren soil and the severity of cold climate, which developed in them\r\nthe masculine qualities of aggressiveness, force, and exertion, the\r\nsouthern branch of the Aryan family, who migrated into the smiling\r\nvalleys of the Indus and the Ganges, found in their new home abundance\r\nof physical comfort. The extreme fertility of soil and the warm\r\nclimate made existence easy and left them leisure for speculation and\r\nthought--conditions which have tended to make the people of India\r\nemotional, meditative, and mystic. The bounty of nature released them\r\nfrom struggle, and the resulting freedom from material cares and\r\nsecurity of existence developed in the Hindu character the benevolent\r\nqualities of tolerance and thankfulness.[21]\r\n\r\nThe peace-loving nature of the Hindu mind shows itself in its early\r\nventures into the study of the higher and deeper problems of life.\r\nWhen they began to inquire into the secrets of the universe and its\r\nrelationship to human life with a view to discovering the mystery of\r\nour existence on this planet, they were dominated solely by an absolute\r\nand unqualified love of truth. “They never quarreled about their\r\nbeliefs or asked any questions about individual faiths. Their only\r\nambition was to acquire knowledge of the universe,--of its origin and\r\ncause,--and to understand the whence and whither, the who and what\r\nof the human soul.” The early pioneers of Hindu thought lay down for\r\nrest on the open, fertile plains of the Ganges during the fragrant\r\nsummer nights of India, and their eyes sought the starry heavens above.\r\nThen they looked into themselves, and must have asked, “What are we?\r\nWhat is this life on earth meant for? How did we come here? Where\r\nare we bound for? What becomes of the human soul?” and many another\r\ndifficult question. The answer that the Hindu sages of old gave to\r\nthese difficult questions is to be found in the one simple rule of the\r\nUnity of All Life: One Supreme Being is the source of all joy; He is\r\nthe master of all knowledge; He is eternal, stainless, unchangeable,\r\nand always present as a witness in every conscience; He alone is real\r\nand lasting, and the rest of this material universe is _maya_, a mere\r\nillusion. Human soul is made of the same substance as the Supreme soul.\r\nIt is separated from its source through ignorance. Through succeeding\r\nincarnations it strives to reach its ultimate goal, which is its\r\nidentification with the Supreme Being. That is the final end of all\r\nhuman effort--the realization of the Self--which accomplished, man’s\r\nexistence becomes one with the rest of the Universe, and his life\r\nthereafter is one of limitless love. His soul unites with the Universal\r\nsoul and he has obtained his _Moksha_ (_salvation_). He begins to see\r\n“All things in self and self in All.”\r\n\r\nThis idea of spiritual freedom, which is the release of the self\r\nfrom the ego concept, forms the foundation of Hindu culture, and has\r\ninfluenced the whole character of India’s social and religious ideals.\r\nLet us try to explain it a little more clearly. The recognition of\r\nthe unity of all life assumes the existence of one God, “one source,\r\none essence and one goal.” The final purpose of life is to realize\r\nthis unity, when the human soul becomes one with the Universal Spirit.\r\nIgnorance is the cause of all evil, because it forever hides from\r\nus the true vision. The wise man continually strives to overcome\r\nignorance through the study of philosophy and through self-restraint\r\nand renunciation. He seeks to achieve knowledge of Self, in order\r\nthat he may see God face to face. Then he will attain _Moksha_\r\n(salvation). Until he has realized the absolute Truth, he must hold\r\non to the relative truth as he sees it, which is accomplished through\r\nthe exercise of such virtues as universal love, faith, devotion,\r\nself-sacrifice, and renunciation.\r\n\r\n“Despising everything else, a wise man should strive after the\r\nknowledge of the Self.”\r\n\r\nHuman life on this earth is a journey from one village to the other.\r\nWe are all pilgrims here, and this abode is only our temporary home\r\nand not a permanent residence. Instead of being continually in search\r\nof material wealth, of power, of fame, and of toiling day and night,\r\nwhy should we not regard life as a perpetual holiday and learn to rest\r\nand enjoy it? Would it not be better if we had a little less of work,\r\na little less of so-called pleasure, and more of thought and peace? It\r\ndoes not take much to sustain life; vegetable food in small quantities\r\nwill maintain the body in good health, and the shelter of a cottage is\r\nall that a man requires. That he should build palaces and amass riches\r\nproves his lack of knowledge; that he should try to find happiness\r\nfrom the ruin of the happiness of his fellow beings, the inevitable\r\nconsequence of the building up of great fortunes, is absurd. Nothing\r\nis real except His law and His power. Human life, like a bubble on\r\nthe surface of a mighty ocean, may burst and disappear at any moment.\r\n“There is fruit on the trees in every forest, which everyone who likes\r\nmay pluck without trouble. There is cool and sweet water in the pure\r\nrivers here and there. There is a soft bed made of the twigs of the\r\nbeautiful creepers. And yet wretched people suffer pain at the door of\r\nthe rich.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     “A man seeking for eternal happiness (moksha) might obtain it by a\r\n     hundredth part of the suffering which a foolish man endures in the\r\n     pursuit of riches.”\r\n\r\n     “Poor men eat more excellent bread than the rich; for hunger gives\r\n     it sweetness.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the doctrine of Maya has taught the people of India that all\r\nmaterial things are illusion.\r\n\r\nThus, guided by the vision of Universal Spirit, which sustains the\r\nentire creation, and saved by the right comprehension of the doctrine\r\nof Maya, the Hindus have developed a civilization in which people are\r\ninspired largely by the ideals of human fellowship, by love and by\r\nspiritual comfort. The wisdom of the Hindu’s retiring, passive attitude\r\ntoward life will not readily be acknowledged by his sturdy, aggressive,\r\nand combative brothers in the western world. The Occidental’s\r\nnecessities of life have assumed such immense proportions, and social\r\nrelations have become so intricate and insecure, that a man’s whole\r\nlife is spent in making sure of mere existence, and in providing\r\nagainst the accidents of the future. Such is the deadening influence\r\nof the continual hurly-burly of every-day life around him, that he has\r\nbegun to regard life as synonymous with work. He has never himself\r\ntasted the sweetness of security and peace, and when he hears anyone\r\nelse discuss it, he is likely to brand the doctrine as dreamy, unreal,\r\nand impractical. “But is it surely wise to destroy the best objects of\r\nlife for the sake of life? Is the winning of wealth and the enjoying\r\nof pleasure always a superior choice to that of spiritual freedom?” To\r\nlove leisure, ideals, and peace has been the criterion of Hindu wisdom.\r\nThose who have closely studied the history of the Hindu nation know the\r\nillumination, the peace, the joy, the strength that its lessons bring\r\ninto the lives of those simple, virtuous people.\r\n\r\nHindu civilization has been, on the whole, humane and wholesome, and\r\nthe life of the people of India has been one of unalloyed usefulness\r\nand service to humanity. India has always been the home of various\r\nreligions and its people have always been divided into innumerable\r\nfaiths. At no period of its long history, however, has religious\r\npersecution been practised by any class of people in the country.\r\n“No war was ever waged in or outside of India by the Hindu nation in\r\nthe name of religion. India has never witnessed the horrors of an\r\ninquisition; no holy wars were undertaken, and no heretics burned alive\r\nfor the protection of religion.” In the entire history of the Hindu\r\nnation, not a drop of blood has ever been shed in the name of religion.\r\nTo those who have read the accounts of the bloody tortures and the\r\nmassacres that have been enacted for the sake of religion among the\r\nChristian nations of the world, this _is saying much_.\r\n\r\nThe hobby of the Hindu is not Catholicism, Presbyterianism, Methodism,\r\nor any other form of ism known to the western world; his interest\r\ndoes not lie in Hinduism, Buddhism, or Sikhism. His passion is for\r\nreligion. “He loves not _a_ religion; _he lives for religion_.” It was\r\nhis love of religion which an old English missionary found among the\r\ninhabitants of a small village in Northern India. Tired from walking\r\nin the hot summer sun, this wandering friar lay down under the cool\r\nshade of a banyan tree for rest, and fell asleep. How long he slept and\r\nwhat brilliant dreams of His Master Lord Christ’s mercy this humble\r\nmendicant had, no one knows. When in the late afternoon he opened his\r\neyes, he saw a beautiful young girl gently fanning his face, while her\r\nlittle brother stood near, carrying in his arms a basket of choice\r\nfruits and a jug of fresh, cool water. As the old friar’s eyes finally\r\nmet the maiden’s kindly gaze, he exclaimed: “At last after all these\r\nweary travels I have found a Christian people!”\r\n\r\nReligion to the Hindu is not one among the many interests in life. It\r\nis the all-absorbing interest. The thought of a Universal Brotherhood\r\ntaught in his religion guides every social, commercial, and political\r\nact of his life; while the hope of divine sanction inspires his efforts\r\nin the intellectual and spiritual spheres. Religion is not the mere\r\nprofession of a certain theological faith, whose ritual may be observed\r\non appointed occasions and then be forgotten till time again comes for\r\nworship and prayer. Religion is the “Yearning beyond” on the part of\r\nman, and when once its essence is realized, the spirit must influence\r\nevery interest of the individual’s life. This is the way in which\r\nreligion is understood in India. “It is not a matter of form, but of\r\nmind and will. To the Hindu, it is more religious to cleanse the soul\r\nand build a good character than to mutter prayers and observe a strict\r\nritual. Morality should form the basis of religion, and emphasis should\r\nbe laid, not on outward observance, but on inward spiritual culture.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     “By deed, thought, and word, one should do good to (all) living\r\n     beings. This Harsha declared to be the highest way of earning\r\n     religious merit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of life is the realization of Self, to which all other\r\ninterests must be completely subordinated. The material things of the\r\nworld are but a means to this end; and the end being religion, its\r\nthought must not be lost sight of in arranging the details of life.\r\nHence, religion pervades the entire fabric of Hindu society. Study\r\nIndian art, law, ethics, and political economy; everywhere you will\r\nfind the same thought of God and his all-embracing mercy underlying\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the holy Jesus, who taught the doctrine of\r\nnon-resistance and whose Sermon on the Mount is resplendent with love\r\nfor humanity, has inspired many a Gandhi in the East. It has, however,\r\nbeen the cause of much bloodshed and slaughter. Under its banner\r\nslavery was sustained until the economic conditions throughout the\r\nworld made its abolition inevitable and imperative. The negro-traffic,\r\ninvolving human brutality which makes us shudder and horrors which\r\nfreeze our blood and leave us aghast, was carried on by Christian\r\npeople with the express sanction of the most holy See and her august\r\nlieutenants of God. As late as the end of the nineteenth century\r\nChina was subdued in the name of Christian religion. The immediate\r\nprovocation of the Boxer War was the murder of two white missionaries\r\nin the interior of China. What deeds of chivalry the soldiers of\r\nthe western nations, who were sent to China for the defence of\r\nChristianity, did, are recorded by Mr. Gowen in his _An Outline History\r\nof China_ thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “But in Tung Chow alone, a city where the Chinese made no\r\n     resistance and where there was no fighting, five hundred and\r\n     seventy-three women of the upper classes committed suicide rather\r\n     than survive the indignities they had suffered. Our civilization\r\n     of which we boast so much is still something of a veneer.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Hindu requires him to practise love toward his\r\nfellowman, tenderness toward animal life, and toleration of religious\r\ndiversities with other people. He believes that the Christians,\r\nthe Mohammedans, and the Jews may be as good men in their human\r\nrelationships as he and be on as straight a road to heaven as he is.\r\nHe does not question the divine revelation of the holy books of other\r\nreligions, nor does he deny “that Christ was the Son of God, and\r\nMohammed the Prophet of God.” All that he wishes in this life is that\r\nhe should be allowed to worship his Deity as he chooses. Says Krishna\r\nin Bhagvat Gita, the Bible of the Hindus: “Whosoever come to Me,\r\nthrough whatever form, through that I reach him; All men are struggling\r\nto reach Me through various paths, and all the paths are Mine.”\r\n\r\n“There is in the Hindu religion a doctrine called _Ahimsa_, namely,\r\nnon-injury to any form of life, which transcends any ethical ideal\r\nknown to the western ethics. The idea finds expression in the Society\r\nfor Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Animals.” The Hindu religion\r\nis the only religion in the world which forbids the eating of animal\r\nflesh. If all life is of one essence, if the animal pleading for life\r\nsuffers as truly as man under the same conditions, is it fair to kill\r\nthe animal for the sake of a simple pleasure? This gentle doctrine of\r\nharmlessness has helped to develop in the Hindu character the noble\r\nvirtues of benevolence and universal love. The Hindu may lack the\r\nso-called “manly virtues”; his spiritual nature may be shocked to hear\r\nthat perfectly civilized men and women kill animals for sport, that\r\nthey go on pleasure excursions on the ocean to shoot the flying fish.\r\nThe fish is harmless, and when shot merely falls into the ocean; merely\r\nin shooting it lies the sportsman’s amusement. Which of the two extreme\r\ndoctrines is right, we shall leave the reader to judge for himself.\r\nBut the general doctrine of “harmlessness” must commend itself to the\r\nenlightened moral sense of the West. A right comprehension of this\r\nprinciple will assist greatly in getting rid of the curse of cruelty\r\nand war.\r\n\r\nTwo features in the Hindu character which stand out most conspicuously\r\nare truthfulness and chivalry towards women. The name for truth in the\r\nSanscrit language is _satya_, which means _to be_. “So truth in the\r\nHindu’s language means that which is. It may not necessarily be the\r\nsame as that which is believed by the majority of people. Again, the\r\nhighest praise given to the gods in the Veda is that they are truthful\r\nand trustworthy. We know that people will ascribe to their gods the\r\nsame qualities which are held in highest regard among themselves.\r\nThe whole literature of ancient and modern India is full of episodes\r\nproclaiming the virtue of truth. Rama’s answer to Bharata in the epic\r\npoem of _Ramayna_ [quoted on page 13] is typical of the Hindu’s regard\r\nfor truth. In Mahabharata again we find the same devotion to a pledge\r\nonce given. Bhisma, for example, was willing to suffer death rather\r\nthan to disregard his pledge never to hurt a woman. The poets of the\r\nVedas, the sages of Upnishads, and the writers of the law books were\r\nall inspired by feelings of profound love and reverence for truth. The\r\nwhole literature of India is vibrant with the same keynote--highest\r\nregard for truth.”[22] A perusal of the accounts of the character and\r\nculture of the people of India left by foreign travelers in ancient and\r\nmodern times shows that the traveler was most deeply impressed in each\r\ninstance by the Hindu’s love of truth. Let us examine a few of these\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese traveler Hiouen-thsang writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Though the Indians are of a light temperament, they are\r\n     distinguished by the straightforwardness and honesty of their\r\n     character. With regard to riches, they never take anything\r\n     unjustly; with regard to justice, they make even excessive\r\n     concessions.... Straightforwardness is the distinguishing feature\r\n     of their administration.”[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan historian, Idris, writes thus in his Geography (11th\r\ncentury):\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The Indians are naturally inclined to justice, and never depart\r\n     from it in their actions. Their good faith, honesty, and fidelity\r\n     to their engagements are well known, and they are so famous for\r\n     these qualities that people flock to their country from every\r\n     side.”[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nMarco Polo, the Venetian explorer, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “You must know that these Abraiaman (Brahman) are the best\r\n     merchants in the world, and the most truthful, for they would not\r\n     tell a lie for anything on earth.”[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir W. H. Sleeman, K. C. B., who resided in India nearly\r\na quarter of a century, and who was during this period employed in\r\nvarious capacities in which he came in direct contact with hundreds of\r\npeople every day, writes of the Indians thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I have had before me hundreds of cases in which a man’s property,\r\n     liberty, or life depended upon his telling a lie, and he has\r\n     refused to tell it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt another place while speaking about the Indian merchants Major\r\nSleeman says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I believe there is no class of men in the world more strictly\r\n     honorable in their dealings than the mercantile classes of\r\n     India. Under native government a merchant’s books were appealed\r\n     to as ‘holy writ,’ and the confidence in them has certainly not\r\n     diminished under our rule.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally we shall quote from a speech made by Sir Guy Fleetwood Wilson\r\nin 1913 when he was retiring from the high office of Finance Member of\r\nthe Indian Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I wish to pay a tribute to the Indians whom I know best. The\r\n     Indian officials, high and low, of my department, through the\r\n     years of my connection with them, have proved themselves to be\r\n     unsparing of service and absolutely trustworthy. As for their\r\n     trustworthiness, let me give an instance. Three years ago, when it\r\n     fell to my lot to impose new taxes, it was imperative that their\r\n     nature should remain secret until they were officially announced.\r\n     Everybody in the department had to be entrusted with this secret.\r\n     Any one of these, from high officials to low-paid compositors of\r\n     the Government Press, would have become a millionaire by using the\r\n     secret improperly. But even under such tremendous temptation no\r\n     one betrayed his trust.”[24]\r\n\r\n\r\nComment after these unequivocal testimonies of eminent foreign\r\nchroniclers of India is unnecessary. Where else in the world could\r\nthe experience of the Finance Member Sir Guy Wilson be repeated? If\r\neveryone who visited the country was equally impressed by the truthful\r\ncharacter of the Hindus there must surely be meaning in the statement\r\nthat the Hindus are honest, truthful, and straightforward. Foreign\r\ntravelers have visited other lands during various historical periods,\r\nbut nowhere else were they so singularly impressed by the integrity of\r\nthe people as in India. But we are not obliged to look into ancient\r\nhistories to establish the Hindu’s honesty and love for truth. Go\r\nto-day into any town of India. Walk in the business section of Bombay,\r\nCalcutta, or Karachi and there you will find transactions amounting\r\nto hundreds of thousands carried on day after day without a receipt\r\ntaken or given. An entry in the ledger books of both parties is all\r\nthat is held necessary in such cases. In my own family, low-paid\r\nhousehold servants drawing salaries up to a couple of hundreds a year\r\nwere intrusted in the course of their duties with the handling of many\r\nthousands of dollars. And there was no least feeling of hesitation\r\nor anxiety on the part of the family, not because the servants were\r\nbonded, but because they were trusted.\r\n\r\nA people who respect truth so highly must be lovers of learning. At\r\nevery period in the history of India, a genius has been recognized and\r\naccorded assistance, even if his thesis ran contrary to the popular\r\nprejudice of the day. Whether a new sage lifted his head in the field\r\nof religion, or a thinker in the philosophical or scientific field was\r\nborn, he was always allowed an opportunity to express himself under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances. He did not have to fear persecution on\r\naccount of his ideas. So long as he had a message to offer to mankind,\r\nhe was assured an audience. “_Freedom of thought has always prevailed\r\namong all classes of people in India._”\r\n\r\nChivalry toward women, which has been named as another outstanding\r\nfeature of Hindu character, has already been discussed in a previous\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nTo review in detail the achievements of Hindu civilization would\r\nrequire volumes. India’s contributions to the world’s study of\r\nphilosophy, science, religion, and social organization are legion.\r\nWhile the continent of Europe was still in a state of barbarism, the\r\nHindus invented the sciences of grammar, arithmetic, and astronomy.\r\nThey were already masters of a perfect alphabet, of a polished\r\nlanguage, and of the most complete systems of law and social ethics\r\nthat the world has ever seen. When the forefathers of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nraces roamed in forests with painted bodies, the Hindus had an\r\nextensive literature, an established religion, and a developed\r\ncivilization. In fact, India has ever been esteemed as the birthplace\r\nof the most natural of natural religions, as the nurse of sciences,\r\nas the inventress of fine arts, and as a fertile home for all forms\r\nof genius. Her lawgivers evolved the most wonderful fabric of social\r\norganization, and composed systems of ethics worthy of the highest\r\npraise; her philosophers invented six most profound systems of\r\nphilosophy famous for their subtlety of thought and acuteness of logic;\r\nand her religious teachers formed the two greatest religions of the\r\nworld, which are to this day professed by more than half of the human\r\nrace. Even in the domain of natural sciences Hindus have advanced to\r\na high state of development, a fact which is little realized by most\r\npeople. Says Sir Monier-Williams:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Indeed, if I may be at all allowed the anachronism, the Hindus\r\n     were Spinozites more than two thousand years before the existence\r\n     of Spinoza; and Darwinians many centuries before Darwin; and\r\n     evolutionists many centuries before the doctrine of evolution had\r\n     been accepted by the scientists of our time, and before any word\r\n     like ‘evolution’ existed in any language of the world.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hindus belong to a race of mankind which has outlasted all the\r\nnations of the earth. “Before the days of Abraham India had achieved\r\na great civilization. Other civilizations had lived and died. Egypt,\r\nBabylon, and Assyria--each came and went. After India had been\r\nflourishing for more than two thousand years, Greece appeared and\r\npassed on. The vast Roman Empire, dominating half the earth, paid huge\r\ntribute to the art and industry of India, then closed its day while the\r\nHindu people continued to develop magnificent achievements in science,\r\nliterature, art, architecture, law and government, philosophy and\r\nreligion.” Lord Curzon, whose judgment undoubtedly was not biased in\r\nfavor of India, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “India has left a deeper mark on the history, philosophy and\r\n     religion of mankind than any other terrestrial unit of the\r\n     universe.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have thus shown that as a nation the people of India have devoted\r\ntheir efforts more to the development of the spiritual side of life\r\nthan the material. Unlike the aggressive and combative character of\r\nwestern civilization, the prominent features of Hindu culture are a\r\npassive and reflective attitude toward life. Compared with the record\r\nof her sister nations in the West, the history of the country has been\r\nhappier, less fierce, and more peaceful and stable; the inhabitants\r\nhave been more careful and thoughtful, passive and tolerant.\r\n\r\nTwo great civilizations of the world--India and China--separated only\r\nby a long border, have flourished for centuries, and not once in their\r\nentire history have they been at war with each other. They early\r\nrealized the truth that the object of human life is not possession of\r\nimmense wealth and dominion over weaker races for the sake of physical\r\ncomforts. The aim of human effort, as they saw it, should be the\r\ndevelopment of the “mental, moral, and spiritual powers latent in man.”\r\nThe Hindus evolved for themselves the idea of a God that was omnipotent\r\nand all-merciful, of a human soul that was part of the Universal soul\r\nand must be pure, of a life that has the divine spark in it and must\r\nbe boundless and consecrated to the service of all. Truthfulness,\r\ngenerosity, kindness of heart, gentleness of behavior, forgiveness,\r\nand compassion were taught in India as everyday precepts long before\r\nany such thing as ethics existed in any other part of the world. Their\r\ninsistence upon kindness and charity are marks of true virtue; their\r\nbelief that ethics must form the basis of religion and a moral life is\r\nthe criterion of religious mind; their realization that all men are\r\nbrothers and that a virtuous slave is better than a corrupt master,\r\nmark the Hindus as a race of highly intelligent and moral people.\r\n\r\nMany of these statements may not be novel, but they have for us\r\na significant appeal in the fact that “they were thought out and\r\nenunciated many centuries ago, and that they reflected life, not as\r\nit might be imagined in a Utopia, but as it was actually lived by the\r\ncommon people in the small villages and towns of India.”\r\n\r\nThus wrote Manu, the great law-giver of India:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “That man obtains supreme happiness hereafter who _seeks to do\r\n     good to all creatures_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Max Müller.\r\n\r\n[22] Max Müller.\r\n\r\n[23] Quoted from Max Müller.\r\n\r\n[24] Quoted from _Sister India_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CASTE SYSTEM OF INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caste system of India is the most widely discussed subject all over\r\nthe world; it is also the least understood. It is really surprising how\r\nlittle people outside of India know about the institution of caste,\r\nas it was originally evolved and perfected to form the basis of the\r\ncountry’s social, political, and economic structure. Even students\r\nof Hindu philosophy and arts have but a very dim perception of the\r\nmeaning of caste. You cannot talk about India for five minutes to any\r\nperson without being confronted with the questions: “How about your\r\ncaste system? Isn’t it true that the upper classes refuse to marry the\r\nuntouchables, and even to come into any kind of physical contact with\r\nthem? Have not the Brahmans of India always lorded over the classes\r\nfor their own benefit? Wouldn’t they seize the power again for their\r\nown benefit if the English left India today? Don’t you see that we\r\nhave given freedom to the negroes in this country? They have the\r\nsame political rights as white men to vote and to hold office in our\r\ngovernment. They can come into our homes and do the cooking for us and\r\nwe feel no repulsion for them. Would you permit such association of the\r\nclasses in India? This equality of spirit is democracy, and until India\r\ngives up her old aristocratic habits and changes to the new democratic\r\nideals of the age, she will never be free politically, morally, or\r\nspiritually--talk what you will of your spirituality and ethics.”\r\n\r\nI have heard such sermons over and over again from Americans of\r\nevery status in life. College professors and their wives, university\r\nstudents, teachers, ministers, shirt dealers, insurance agents,\r\nstreet-car conductors, bootblacks, and railroad porters have asked me\r\nsimilar questions. In reply, I do not deny that one class of people\r\nis called “untouchables” and that no other class will intermingle or\r\nintermarry with them. I question most seriously, however, the truth of\r\nthe premise of the second statement. Brahmans have not always ruled the\r\ncountry with purely selfish motives. The priestly class has wielded\r\nimmense influence in India’s political and social life at different\r\nperiods of its history, but they have used their power mostly for the\r\nadvancement of its culture and arts. To the Brahmans we owe in general\r\nthe elaboration and systematization of Hindu philosophy. The vast\r\ntreasures of Hindu literature and fine arts were both produced and\r\npreserved by the same class, who for unknown ages have been the sole\r\nrepositories of knowledge in India. They have abused their authority at\r\nseveral periods, but on such occasions a great reformer like Buddha or\r\nNanak always appeared among the Hindus and gave the corrupted priests\r\nfresh warning for their mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Brahmans was at its lowest when the British acquired\r\nIndia, and the Brahmans have found in the English rulers of the\r\ncountry great champions, who have succeeded first in demoralizing\r\nthem and then in assisting them to demoralize in turn the rest of\r\nHindu society. England with its mighty governing hand of steel is the\r\nstrongest bulwark of aristocracy in India. And those who say things\r\nto the contrary either do not know the facts or they deliberately\r\nmisrepresent them. We shall explain later how the subtle methods of our\r\nforeign rulers work.\r\n\r\nLastly, I do not deny that India needs a reorganization of its\r\nantiquated social system in order to fit properly into the modern\r\nworld. Her caste regulations have given to her numerous races and\r\nclasses only the negative benefits of peace and order at the expense of\r\nthe positive opportunities of expansion and movement. If India is to\r\nlive, and if it hopes ever to occupy its proper place among the family\r\nof nations, it must cut out of its system the cancer of untouchability.\r\nHowever manifest are the evils of India’s rigid caste system and the\r\nnecessity of its immediate overhauling, the contrast with America seems\r\nso unjust. With typical complacency, the Americans declare that there\r\nis no caste in the United States. Yet the American negro, although he\r\nhas a right to vote and to hold office, has absolutely no opportunity\r\nto make use of these privileges. A child of ten has more chance of\r\nbeating the world’s heavyweight champion in a prize-fight than an\r\nAmerican negro with the highest moral and educational qualifications\r\nhas of becoming a governor of the smallest state in the Union. The\r\nworld knows that in most states the law prohibits marriage between\r\nwhites and negroes, while society everywhere will, in its own direct\r\nand emphatic American way, ban the union of a white girl to a negro.\r\nIt is also true that in most states negro children are taught in\r\nseparate schools, and that on Sunday colored people must go for prayer\r\nto separate churches. In the South, the center of the negro population\r\nin the United States, negroes must travel in separate carriages\r\non railroad trains and use separate waiting rooms at the stations.\r\nIt is also a matter of history that on the average more than sixty\r\nnegroes are lynched in America every year by mobs for crimes, which if\r\ncommitted under similar conditions by white persons, would be punished\r\nthrough the regular course of law.\r\n\r\nThis condition in the United States does not justify the injustice of\r\ncaste in India or anywhere else in the world, but it may help to give\r\nthe sharp critic of the Hindu system a milder temper in his judgment by\r\nreminding him that human nature everywhere has its virtues and faults.\r\nWe shall now proceed to examine the origin and the function of the\r\ncaste of India.\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit word which has been wrongly translated into caste is\r\n_Varna_, which means color. Thus the derivation of the term shows that\r\nthe original classifications in Hindu society were made on the basis\r\nof color or race.[25] When the Aryans first migrated into India, they\r\nfound themselves face to face with hordes of savage tribes belonging to\r\ninferior and aboriginal races. The position of those Aryan forefathers\r\nwas analogous to that which later confronted the immigrants of Europe\r\ninto the continents of America and Australia. While these latter\r\ninvaders have sought to simplify their race problems by exterminating\r\nthe original inhabitants of these countries, the early Hindus under\r\nsimilar conditions accepted the inferior races as units in their social\r\nstructure and gave them a distinct place in the scale of labor, the\r\nnature of their functions being strictly determined according to\r\ntheir qualification. Even in our present stage of advancement we find\r\nthat caste prevails throughout the civilized world. Its ugly symptoms\r\nare most prominent in America, Australia, and the white colonies of\r\nAfrica. In the United States, the lynching of negroes in the South and\r\nthe strict anti-Asiatic regulations of the state of California, and\r\nin Australia the “Keep Australia white at all cost” spirit among the\r\npopulation,--both of these show how deeply the spirit of race hatred\r\nhas penetrated into the system of the dominant white races of the\r\nworld. In the state of California, which is the center of oriental\r\npopulation in America, law prohibits the Asiatics (Japanese, Chinese,\r\nHindus) from owning property and even from temporarily leasing lands\r\nfor farming purposes. Another statute rules against marriage between\r\nwhites and mongolians. The anti-Asiatic land lease regulations of\r\nCalifornia have given a severe blow to the oriental population of\r\nthe state. The Japanese, Chinese, and Hindu immigrants to the United\r\nStates were chiefly agriculturists. In the early days of California\r\nthese frugal, honest, hard-working people contributed materially to the\r\ndevelopment of agriculture. And the fact cannot well be denied that the\r\nintensely hot regions of the Imperial Valley and the mosquito-ridden,\r\nswampy northern counties were brought under cultivation almost\r\nexclusively through the initiative of the Japanese and Hindu farmers of\r\nCalifornia. The Chinese, in conjunction with the other oriental races,\r\nhad much to do in developing the largest asparagus growing region in\r\nthe world, represented by the deltas of the Sacramento Valley. Imperial\r\nValley is today the richest vegetable growing colony in the world.\r\nThe northern counties produce the finest qualities of California rice\r\nin immense quantities, while the Delta asparagus has made California’s\r\nname famous throughout the world as the producer of the choicest\r\nqualities of both white and green asparagus. But the simple, peace\r\nloving, industrious, and retiring Asiatics who toiled to make the name\r\nof agricultural California great are barred by law from making even an\r\nhonest, meager living through farming on a small scale. And all because\r\nof the caste of race! As one of the state senators exclaimed not long\r\nago: “_We must keep California safe from the yellow peril._” To which\r\nan eminent Hindu publicist humorously replied: “I have seen no danger\r\nof a yellow peril in California except that of the ‘Yellow Cabs’.”\r\n\r\nWhen a small group of immigrants in any land find themselves surrounded\r\nby an endless environment of barbarous tribes, we grant that the\r\nsituation is critical. The small group of Aryan immigrants in India,\r\nhowever, unlike the American colonists, who exterminated most of the\r\noriginal inhabitants of the country, sought to assimilate the barbarous\r\ntribes, and hence found themselves confronted with a difficult problem.\r\nThey were inspired with the desire to preserve the purity of their\r\nsuperior race and culture on the one hand, and to assimilate in their\r\nsocial system the aboriginal races as well as they could, in order to\r\nsave them from annihilation. On the other hand, they felt it necessary\r\nto safeguard their race by refusing to intermarry with people on a\r\nlower scale of civilization. The Aryan forefathers of India, by giving\r\nto the original population of the country a distinct place in its\r\nsocial life, however low, have preserved them on the one hand from\r\nextermination and on the other from slavery of person. “Was this not\r\nthe very solution which suggested itself to the American emancipator\r\nLincoln, when at a much later date he faced the same problems under\r\nsimilar conditions? That adjustment of their racial differences that\r\nhad been declared wise and that had been practised by the Hindus many\r\nthousand years ago, was at last acknowledged by the leaders of the\r\nwestern world as the only salvation from their difficult situation.” In\r\nthe meantime, whole populations had been obliterated, and generation\r\nafter generation of human beings had been subjected to the tortures of\r\nslavery,--to injustice and suffering of the most loathsome kind.\r\n\r\nBefore we judge the Hindu too harshly for refusing to drink the same\r\nwater as the non-Aryans and to eat food cooked by their hands, we must\r\nremember that most of the aborigines of India were carrion eaters and\r\nwere more unclean than their Aryan neighbors. The Aryan would not\r\nperform any act of life without previously taking his morning bath; he\r\nwas scrupulously clean in all his habits. He felt, therefore, that it\r\nwas merely a hygienic precaution not to allow the filthy barbarians\r\naccess to his person or his house. But it is the nature of caste to\r\nconvert temporary inhibitions into permanent barriers. In so far as\r\nthe early Hindu sociologists safeguarded the superior Aryan culture by\r\nlaying down strict rules--such as the refusals to intermarry and to\r\ndrink the same water--,they were in the right. Therein they recognized\r\nthe diversity of races and the necessity of keeping separate the\r\nmost highly developed and the least civilized. “But they erred most\r\ndangerously in not grasping the fact that differences between human\r\nbeings are not fixed like the physical barriers of mountains, but are\r\nmutable and fluid with life’s flow.”[26] “It is the law of life to\r\nchange its shape and volume through the impact of environment.” “Was\r\nit not expected that contact with the civilized Aryans would develop\r\namong the aboriginal inhabitants of India the wholesome qualities of\r\ncleanliness, honesty, peace, and love characteristic of an advanced\r\nrace?”[26] To have thus bound in an iron frame the growing body of a\r\nhealthy people was not only an intellectual blunder, but a spiritual\r\ncrime. As a result, India, which is fundamentally one nation, is now\r\ntorn into innumerable castes and communities. And this is the cause of\r\nher degradation and ruin. India, which should be the mightiest nation\r\nof the world today, on account of her ancient culture and history and\r\nthe nobility and height of her spiritual idealism, is now fallen. If\r\nthere exists anywhere the law of Karma, the Hindus of the present age\r\nare atoning for the sins of omission of their ancient forefathers. The\r\ngreat, great, great grandchildren of those who denied their fellow\r\nhumans the natural rights of humanity have been cast out of the world’s\r\nprogressive life as the black pariahs of the race. In a recent decision\r\nof the United States Supreme Court, which has ruled out the natives\r\nof India as ineligible to the citizenship of America, the Honorable\r\nJustice remarked: “Hindus of the high caste belonging to the Aryan\r\nor Caucasian race, are not white persons.” Those Hindus who pride\r\nthemselves as _twice-born Brahmans_ should take notice of this language.\r\n\r\nLet those who wish clamor loud about their Nordic superiority or\r\nBrahmanic purity. What is needed in the world today is not the purity\r\nof the race so much as the purity of the human soul and its motives.\r\nHow far the soul of the western people is clean I would not say, but\r\nbeing myself a Hindu, I do know that the soul of India is black. By\r\ndenying to their fellow brethren their rightful position as human\r\nbeings, the upper classes of India have sinned most atrociously against\r\nthemselves and their gods. “Where the touch from a fellow human being\r\npollutes and his shadow corrupts, there the gods can never reside, or\r\ntruth prevail.” The laws of nature are immutable. You may err against\r\nthem for a short time, but you cannot afford to ignore their existence\r\nforever. In the ultimate reckoning nature will fall upon you in a mad\r\nfury and wreak for your mistakes a terrible vengeance. Thus, those who\r\nset out to humble and degrade others are in turn humbled themselves.\r\n“In the act of tyranny, the tyrant loses sight of his ideals and\r\ndevelops the pride of power, which is another name for the lowering of\r\nhis soul. Like a man under the influence of liquor, he may feel for the\r\ntime powerful and strong; yet from the moment an individual loses hold\r\nof truth, the insanity of cruelty and injustice starts its deadly work,\r\nwhich will end in his ruin and death.”[27]\r\n\r\nIf the Hindus wish to survive, they must first humble themselves before\r\nthe members of the lower classes against whom they have long sinned\r\nso terribly. They must purify their souls and promise to sin no more.\r\nUnless they can do this, it is foolish to expect national freedom, and\r\nit is idle to desire it. Those who will not grant freedom to those\r\nbelow them, are themselves not fitted to have freedom.\r\n\r\nThe high-born Hindu should think over the situation in which he finds\r\nhimself today. When he despises the Mohammedans and the lower caste\r\nHindus to such an extent that the mere physical touch from the most\r\nhighly cultured and clean of their kind will spoil the cooking of the\r\nwretchedest of the so-called high-caste, how in the name of God, man,\r\nor the devil can he expect them to love and serve him? The entire\r\nhistory of mankind does not afford one instance in which an oppressed\r\nclass has fought to protect the honor or power of its oppressors. It\r\nis idle to hope that the oppressed classes of India will ever consent\r\nto shed their life-blood to win the freedom of their country. They may\r\nat some time make immense sacrifices in the service and at the bidding\r\nof such a universal soul as Gandhi, or perhaps unite to drive out an\r\nintensely hated foreigner like the British. True liberation, however,\r\ncan be brought to the nation only through the spiritual unity of its\r\npeoples; under the present social regulations the hope of such a union\r\nis not only visionary but idiotic.\r\n\r\nMy misguided Hindu brethren of India should remember what the followers\r\nof Nanak, the Sikhs, have already done, and what the Arya Samajists are\r\ndoing now in the Punjab. They can do the same and much more! If they\r\nneed a leader to guide them, they can find no one holier or wiser in\r\nthe whole world today than Mahatma Gandhi, who will show them the light\r\nas soon as they are ready to see it. Gandhi, the Mahatma (the Great\r\nSoul), the leader of millions, has adopted an untouchable girl into\r\nhis family, whom Mrs. Gandhi is bringing up with their own children in\r\ntheir home. This action has made Gandhi no smaller in the sight of God\r\nor man. Will it make other Hindus smaller if they come forward and say\r\nto their brethren: “Come, brothers, we embrace you. We shall forget the\r\npast and be one again. Children of the same Father, we are all equal\r\nbefore His law. There shall be, in future, no high or low among us.\r\nBrahman and Sudra, Mohammedan and Parsi, we shall join hands and strive\r\nto bring our motherland back to its former vigor.” Then and then alone\r\nwill the regeneration of India be possible.\r\n\r\nWe find that quite early in the country’s history Hindu society fell\r\ninto two main divisions, the Aryans and the non-Aryans. The former\r\nwere again divided into three orders represented by priests, warriors,\r\nand Aryan farmers or merchants; while the non-Aryans constituted the\r\nservant class or the Sudras. The division of society into the three\r\npriestly, warrior, and merchant classes is a natural one. We find its\r\nparallel in ancient Persia, where the division of the community into\r\npriests, warriors, and husbandmen is shown in the Avesta. “In fact, the\r\ncaste sentiment prevails in greater or less degree in all monarchical\r\ncountries of the world. In mediæval Europe the sentiment of caste grew\r\nso strong that it found expression in literature and law.”\r\n\r\nThe work of society in India was distributed among the four castes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Brahmans, the priestly class, were the teachers of the rest of\r\nmankind. Their function was to study the Vedic scriptures and various\r\nbranches of knowledge such as science and philosophy. They were to\r\noffer spiritual guidance and to assist all other classes in the\r\nperformance of religious rites and ceremonies. Everyone depended\r\nupon them for favor with the gods, for they were believed to be\r\nspecially favored to interpret the Veda. As a tribute to the Brahmans’\r\nspirituality and learning, they were respected and loved by the other\r\nclasses. Their simple physical needs were amply provided for, so that\r\nthey were absolutely free from any form of material care. Within the\r\nrealm of their appointed duties they were the free, intellectual lords\r\nof the Universe. This rule applied to the entire class of scholars and\r\nreligious teachers, and not to any chosen group among them. A parallel\r\nstate of intellectual freedom could be reached in the modern western\r\nworld if _all_ of its professors and religious instructors were born\r\nwith independent means. The Brahmans’ threefold function of teaching,\r\nstudying, and renunciation inspired among the masses of mankind the\r\nfeelings of reverence and affection for them. “A Brahman’s body was on\r\nthat account regarded as sacred, and to hurt him in any way was the\r\nheaviest sin; while to kill a Brahman was an unpardonable sin which\r\ncould not be expiated even by penance through an unlimited number of\r\nsuccessive rebirths.”\r\n\r\nWhile the priestly class thus received the love and homage of the\r\npopulace, they at the same time enjoyed many immunities and exemptions.\r\nFrom certain punishments a Brahman was always exempt, and his high rank\r\nsecured him pardon for numerous crimes. On the other hand, special\r\nrules were laid down for his class in order to preserve its sanctity.\r\n“He could never drink, eat meat, or enjoy the coarser pleasures of\r\nlife.” In fact, the law codes of the different castes specify that for\r\ncertain offences a Brahman should be punished many times more than\r\na man belonging to the lower classes. This severity was due to the\r\nbelief of the law-givers of India that “greater knowledge demanded\r\ngreater restraint, and that with the raise in a person’s status his\r\nresponsibility must also rise.” The rule for a Brahman as given by\r\nVasistha is this: “Those are true Brahmans who, well-taught, have\r\nsubdued their passions, injure no living being, and close their fingers\r\nwhen gifts are offered them.” Again, the same teacher has said that a\r\nBrahman by birth is not a true Brahman but a slave unless he lives a\r\nvirtuous and clean life devoted to study and restraint. Says Manu, the\r\ngreat law-giver of India: “A Brahman who does not live as a Brahman\r\nis no better than a slave.” He could be made an outcast and demoted\r\nsocially into a lower rank.\r\n\r\nThus we find that while on the one hand their higher status won for\r\nthe Brahmans respect and reverence from the populace, on the other\r\nhand their better position imposed upon them special restraints. It is\r\ndifficult for us to realize the wisdom of this dictum, yet the Hindu\r\nlaw which prohibited its intellectual classes from possessing property\r\nand otherwise amassing wealth was one of the most profoundly wise laws\r\nin the social history of man. Looked at in conjunction with the text\r\n“that a householder obtains high merit in this life and hereafter by\r\ngiving food, drink, and raiment to Brahmans,” the dictum against the\r\nacquiring of wealth by the Brahman class will appear not only wise but\r\nhighly just. “Here was a class of scholars, leaders of mankind, who\r\nwere safe from the two great evils which are the curse of their noble\r\nprofession--the anxiety of making a livelihood and the temptation to\r\nacquire fortunes.”\r\n\r\nLest it be supposed that the scholars of India lived on the charity\r\nof other classes, a condition which is not regarded in the West as\r\nhonorable, it may be added here in the form of a corollary that charity\r\nin India has an altogether different meaning from that in the West.\r\nThe motives behind such acts in India and the western countries are\r\nquite different. According to Hindu theology, the giver of a gift and\r\nnot the recipient is the beneficiary. Absolutely no sense of pride or\r\nself-importance is attached to the bestowing of gifts. Such deeds are\r\nalways accompanied by a sense of deep humility and thankfulness in the\r\nheart of the householder. “It is the _dharma_, which may be translated\r\nas the _man-ness of man_, of every householder to provide handsomely\r\nfor the needs of a Brahman, and he does this from a sense of religious\r\nand social duty as well as from a desire for a religious blessing.”\r\nIt is as much the householder’s duty and joy in life to accommodate a\r\nBrahman as it is the hope and delight of every mother to comfort her\r\nchild. To assist a strange scholar in his work is considered no more\r\nan act of charity in India than is the support of a son at college\r\nin Europe or America. The experiences of Mrs. Margaret E. Noble, an\r\nEnglishwoman of literary eminence, who went to India for a study of\r\nits philosophy, are illustrative of the Hindu psychology in this\r\nmatter. She relates in her book _The Web of Indian Life_ the story of\r\nher residence in the Hindu section of Calcutta. After news reached\r\nthe neighborhood that she had come to India as a student, she found\r\nin front of her door one morning a jar of fresh milk and a basket of\r\nprovisions left by some unknown visitor. This experience was repeated\r\nalmost every day of the year until her departure. Yet the donors of\r\nthese simple presents never made themselves known to Mrs. Noble, nor\r\nwas she ever questioned by anyone of her neighbors regarding her views\r\non Hindu life. They did not care whether she was friendly or hostile\r\nto them in her judgments. The fact that she had come among them as a\r\n_student_ was sufficient reason for them to provide for her. _India is\r\nthe only country in the world where poets and priests never starve._\r\n\r\n2. _Khashatriyas_ or the royal and military class were the rulers of\r\nthe country, and their duty was to protect the other classes. The\r\nKhashatriyas constituted the knightly caste of India. They were brave\r\nand chivalrous. The enjoyment of the senses and of pleasures subject to\r\nsuch laws as may protect the weak from the strong were the legitimate\r\nrewards of this class. Many a deed of extreme heroism committed by this\r\nclass under the noble impulse to protect justice or to serve Cupid is\r\nrelated in the epic history of India.\r\n\r\n“Chivalry taught them the lessons of gaiety and enjoyment. They learned\r\nto admire and desire beauty. Unlike the austere ascetic Brahmans,\r\npassion and pleasure in the company of woman was sought by the gallant\r\nsuitors of the warrior class. Women were often objects of jealousy, and\r\nthey always exercised great power through their beauty and charm. Fine,\r\nfull-blooded creatures they were, who knew how to get and give love.\r\nBoth men and women loved superbly and passionately. Their passions were\r\nstrong and consuming and their thirst for love great.” Theirs was a\r\nlove about which a poet sung:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “_Give me your love for a day,_\r\n     _A night, an hour;_\r\n     _If the wages of sin are death,_\r\n     _I am willing to pay._\r\n\r\n     _Oh! Aziza, whom I adore,_\r\n     _Aziza, my one delight,_\r\n     _Only one night--I will die before day,_\r\n     _And trouble your life no more._”\r\n                        (LAWRENCE HOPE.)[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The _Vaishya_ or the merchant and husbandman class constituted the\r\nbody of the people. Theoretically they were the equals of the other\r\nclasses of the Aryan family; but “practically this class together\r\nwith the fourth caste, namely the Sudras, formed the majority of the\r\npopulation, whose duty it was to support and serve the two upper\r\nclasses.” They managed the business life of the country and were\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of the other classes. They tilled the\r\nsoil and managed the entire commercial and industrial affairs of the\r\nland. This class was again subdivided into various groups according to\r\ntheir profession. This classification of the middle class of India on\r\nthe basis of occupation was founded upon a thorough understanding of\r\nthe laws of heredity--“the purpose being to develop the best qualities\r\nthrough heredity transmission. Thereby an attempt was made to develop\r\nfurther the brain of the scholar, the skill of the craftsman, and the\r\ningenuity of the trader through the cumulative influence of careful\r\nselection from generation to generation.” By thus shutting different\r\ntrades and professions into air-tight compartments the Vaishya deprived\r\nthemselves of the benefits of the infusion of young blood into the old\r\nsystem. While on the one hand it had the wholesome effect of reducing\r\nthe evils of competition to the minimum, on the other it has gradually\r\ntended “to turn arts into crafts and genius into skill.”\r\n\r\n4. _Sudras_ or the servant class constituted the entire aboriginal\r\nnon-Aryan population of the country, whose function was to do\r\nmechanical service in the household life of the community. According\r\nto Manu the highest merit for this class was to serve faithfully the\r\nother three classes. The Sudras performed the most degrading tasks, and\r\nwere allowed to come into contact with the Aryan population only as\r\nmenials. On account of their filthy habits these aboriginals were not\r\nallowed a close approach to the persons of the higher classes--hence\r\nthe origin of the term “untouchable.” Yet the fact stands that even\r\nthe “untouchables” are members of the Hindu family group. At marriages\r\nand other festivals gifts are freely exchanged between them and the\r\nupper classes. For a householder it is equally important to participate\r\nin the ceremonies of the village “untouchables” and his own cousins.\r\nI remember very clearly how as a young boy I was instructed by my\r\nmother to bow each morning before every elder member of the family, nor\r\nforgetting the servants, or Sudras.\r\n\r\nBhagavad Gita, the Bible of the Hindus, lays down the following rules\r\nfor the different castes of India:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The duties of the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, as also\r\n     of Sudras, are divided in accordance with their nature-born\r\n     qualities. Peace, self-restraint, austerities, purity,\r\n     forgiveness, and uprightness, knowledge, direct intuition,\r\n     and faith in God are the natural qualities of the Brahmin.\r\n     Of the Kshatriyas, bravery, energy, fortitude, dexterity,\r\n     fleeing not in battle, gift and lordliness are the nature-born\r\n     qualities. Agriculture, protection of cows, merchandise, and\r\n     various industries are the nature-born duties of the Vaishyas.\r\n     Conscientiousness in menial service is the nature-born duty of the\r\n     Sudras. A man attains perfection by performing those duties which\r\n     he is able to do.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis division of duties among the different castes “in accordance with\r\ntheir nature-born qualities” needs special notice. We find here that\r\nthe original distinctions between different classes were made on the\r\nbasis of their natural qualifications. “The purpose of the early Hindu\r\nsociologists was to design a society in which opportunity was allowed\r\nto everyone for only such experience as his mental and spiritual\r\nstatus was capable.” In the beginning, castes were not fixed by iron\r\nbarriers, nor were the occupations and professions of the people\r\nhereditary. There was freedom for expansion, and everyone enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of rising into the higher scales of social rank through a\r\ndemonstration of his power and ability to do so. It is a curious fact\r\nof Hindu history that nearly all of its incarnations,--namely, Buddha,\r\nRama, Krishna--belonged to the second or military caste. But the Hindu\r\ncastes had already lost their flexible natures as early as the sixth\r\ncentury B.C., when Buddha once again preached the doctrines of equality\r\nto all classes of people. Through the influence of Buddhist teachings\r\nand for over a thousand years during which Buddhism reigned over\r\nIndia, artificial hereditary caste divisions among peoples were almost\r\nentirely demolished and forgotten. “Buddha gave to the spirit of caste\r\na death-blow. He refused to admit differences between persons because\r\nof their color or race. He would not recognize a Brahman because he\r\nwas born a Brahman. On the other hand he distinguished between people\r\naccording to their intellectual status and moral worth.”[29] He who\r\npossessed the qualities of “peace, self-restraint, self-control,\r\nrighteousness, devotion, love for humanity, and divine wisdom” was\r\nalone a true Brahman. To the Buddhist, caste was less important than\r\ncharacter. His Jataka tales preached this doctrine in a simple but\r\nhighly eloquent manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “_It is not right_\r\n     _To call men white_\r\n     _Who virtue lack;_\r\n     _For it is sin_\r\n     _And not the skin\r\n     That makes men black._\r\n     _Not by the cut of his hair,_\r\n     _Not by his clan or birth,_\r\n     _May a Brahmin claim the Brahmin’s name,_\r\n     _But only by moral worth.”_[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 600 A. D. however, when Buddhism declined and the Brahmans\r\nregained their power, caste was once again established on the old\r\nhereditary lines. Since that time the influence of the vicious system\r\nhas prevailed, except when it was checked by such teachers as Chaityna\r\nwho have regularly appeared at critical periods of the country’s\r\nhistory. Nanak’s influence in modern times has been the strongest in\r\nbreaking down the barriers of caste. He was born near Lahore (Punjab)\r\nin the year 1469 A.D. and became the founder of the Sikh religion. He\r\nrecognized the equality of all human beings, irrespective of their\r\ncolor, rank, or sex. In one of his most popular verses he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “One God produced the light, and all creatures are of His\r\n     creation. When the entire universe has originated from one source,\r\n     why do men call one good and the other bad?”\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in the present day the followers of Nanak are a tremendous force\r\nin demolishing caste. In a recent general assembly of the Sikhs\r\nheld at Amritsar (the official headquarters of the Sikh religion)\r\nit was announced that at all future gatherings of the community,\r\nand in all of its free kitchens everywhere, cooks belonging to the\r\n“untouchable” class shall be freely employed and even given special\r\npreference. As a beginning of this policy the usual pudding offering\r\nof the Sikhs was distributed by “untouchable” men and women to a\r\ngroup of nearly twenty thousand delegates at the convention. Prior\r\nto this, resolutions condemning “untouchability” had been passed on\r\ninnumerable occasions at social service conferences; but never before\r\nhad the ages-old custom been trampled upon, in a practical way, by any\r\nother community belonging to the Hindu religion. May this auspicious\r\nbeginning inaugurate a triumphant conclusion. It is sincerely hoped\r\nthat the leadership of Gandhi and the virile followers of Nanak in\r\nremoving the curse of “untouchability” will soon be recognized by the\r\nentire Hindu community. This alone could insure the enthusiastic Hindu\r\nnationalists political economic freedom for their country. Had it not\r\nbeen for the selfishness of the Brahmans during the mediæval period,--a\r\nselfishness which has tended to segregate the Hindus into different\r\nsections through the strict caste restrictions of various types,--India\r\nwould occupy today the vanguard of the world’s progress instead of\r\nthe rear. In spite of her present weakness India possesses, however,\r\nwithin herself a marvelous reserve force which will enable her to pass\r\nthrough this crisis. While the haughty West, which has always delighted\r\nin taunting the Hindus for the latter’s caste, has not even begun to\r\nexamine her problem of race-conflict, India is already on its way to\r\nsolving her own caste problem. Gradually, as the younger generation\r\namong the Hindus gains more power, “untouchability” and its allied\r\ndiseases will disappear. Personally, I believe that the leaders of\r\nIndia are headed in the right direction, and that soon equality among\r\nmembers of the different castes will be established in the country as\r\na permanent part of its social structure.\r\n\r\n“In the Hindu system, once the people were divided into different\r\ncastes, equality of opportunity for all prevailed within their\r\nown castes, while the caste or group as a whole had collective\r\nresponsibilities and privileges.” Each caste had its own rules and\r\ncode of honor; and so long as a man’s mode of living was acceptable\r\nto his caste-fellows, the rest of the community did not care about it\r\nat all. On the other hand, a man’s status in the outside world or his\r\nwealth made no change in his rank within the caste. I shall offer an\r\nillustration from my own experience. During the mourning week after the\r\ndeath of a near relative of His Royal Highness, the ruling Prince of\r\nthe native State of Kashmir, Her Royal Highness gave a state reception\r\nto the sympathizing friends. Whereas she greeted the wives of the two\r\nhighest officials in the State, the English Resident and the Prime\r\nMinister, with a nod of the head from her seat, Her Royal Highness\r\nhad to receive standing the humble housekeeper in my brother’s home,\r\nbecause the latter belonged to the same caste as the ruling prince.\r\n“Society thus organized can be best described by the term Guild\r\nSocialism.”\r\n\r\nAnother distinctive feature in the study of its caste is the communal\r\ncharacter of Hindu life. Hindu society was established on a basis of\r\ngroup morality. No set of rules were held binding on all classes alike,\r\nbut within a given caste the freedom of the individual was subordinated\r\nto the interest of the caste. Men lived not for their own interests\r\nor comfort, but for the benefit of the community. It was a life of\r\nself-sacrifice, and the concept of duty was paramount. The good of\r\ncaste, of race, of nation stood first, and that of the individual\r\nsecond. Social welfare was placed before the happiness of the\r\nindividual. “For the family sacrifice the individual, for the community\r\nthe family, for the country the community, for the soul all the world.”\r\n\r\nWhich of the two ideals, the communism of the Hindu or the\r\nindividualism of the Westerner is the better? Says Rabindranath Tagore:\r\n“Europe may have preached and striven for individualism, but where else\r\nin the world is the individual so much of slave?”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it must be remembered also that all ideals are\r\ngood only so far as they assist the individual to develop his full\r\nmanhood, and the moment they begin to hamper him in his natural growth\r\nand thwart his own will they lose their value. So long as the caste\r\nregulations of the Hindus assisted them in their spiritual development,\r\nthey were justified. But the moment they began to lose their original\r\ncharacter and became an oppression in the hands of the priestly\r\nclasses, who used their authority to stifle the nation’s spirit, they\r\nhad lost their usefulness and invited the ridicule and censure of all\r\nintelligent thinkers.\r\n\r\nWhere finer feelings of fraternal human-fellowship prevailed over\r\nself-interest and individual gain, in such a community no voice cried\r\nin vain at the time of distress. When deaths in the family left small\r\nchildren parentless, or sickness and misfortunes made homes penniless,\r\nthe protection of other members of the caste was always available for\r\nthose in need. Orphans and helpless members within the caste were taken\r\ninto the homes of caste brothers and carefully brought up and fed\r\nwith the rest as members of the family. Here the lucky and the unlucky\r\nwere brought up side by side. Thus there has never arisen in India\r\nthe necessity of orphanages and poorhouses. As was said by an eminent\r\nEnglish writer:[31] “For to the ripe and mellow genius of the East it\r\nhas been always clear that the defenceless and unfortunate require a\r\n_home_, not a barrack.”\r\n\r\nLet us now review the entire subject of caste thus: The Aryan invaders\r\nof India found themselves surrounded by hordes of aboriginal and\r\ninferior races. Under similar conditions the European invaders of\r\nAmerica and Australia exterminated the original population by killing\r\nthem off, or converted them into human slaves; the Hindu Aryans\r\navoided both of these inhumanities by taking the native inhabitants\r\nof the land into their social life. They gave these inferior peoples\r\na distinct place in the scale of labor, and assigned to them the\r\nduties of menial service, for which alone they were qualified at the\r\ntime. Further, to safeguard their superior culture, the Aryan leaders\r\nlaid down strict rules against intermarriage with their non-Aryan\r\nneighbors. And as these aboriginals were filthy in their habits and\r\nmostly carrion-eaters, it was also ordained as a measure of hygienic\r\nprecaution that the Aryans should not be allowed to drink the same\r\nwater or eat food cooked by non-Aryan hands. This was the beginning of\r\nuntouchability.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with this racial division rose a functional division\r\namong the Aryan population separating it into three orders of priests,\r\nwarriors, and husbandmen. This constituted the four-fold division of\r\nthe Hindu caste system--the Aryan inhabitants of the land forming the\r\nfirst three castes of Brahmans, Khashatriyas, and Vaishyas, while the\r\nnon-Aryans constituted the fourth caste of servants or Sudras. At first\r\nthese divisions into different castes were flexible and persons in the\r\nlower castes were allowed to rise into the ones higher by virtue of\r\ntheir merit. We find that most of the historic religious teachers of\r\nthe Hindus, namely, Rama, Krishna, and Buddha, came from the second\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the castes began to lose their flexible nature,\r\nand before the birth of Buddha in the year 600 B. C. they had already\r\nacquired a hereditary character. The teachings of Buddhism had the\r\ntendency to break down the hereditary barriers of caste, and during a\r\nthousand years of its reign the people of India had forgotten their\r\ncaste boundaries. “Around 600 A. D. Buddhism began to decline and the\r\nBrahman priests gained fresh prestige. They set up the different castes\r\non the old hereditary lines once again, and, except for a few local\r\nbreaks through the appearance of such leaders as Nanak in Punjab and\r\nChaityna in the South, the spirit of caste has prevailed throughout\r\nHindu India since the decline of Buddhism.” The greatest champion of\r\nthe lower classes who has appeared in recent times is the peaceful\r\nleader of India’s silent revolution, Mahatma Gandhi. He has spoken and\r\nwritten against untouchability and its allied evils more bitterly and\r\nlonger than against other vital political and economic wrongs of the\r\ncountry. He has told his countrymen time and again that India’s soul\r\ncannot become pure so long as untouchability stays amongst the Hindus\r\nto defile it. And as a proof of his own sincerity in the matter he has\r\nadopted in his own family an untouchable girl whom he calls the joy of\r\nthe household.\r\n\r\nThe evils of caste are quite manifest. It has tended to divide the\r\nHindu community into various groups and thus destroyed among them\r\nunity of feeling which alone could insure national strength. Lack of\r\nunited power opened the way for foreign invasions, which, again, has\r\nresulted in dragging India down from her former place of glory to her\r\npresent state of humiliation and ruin. Yet alongside with the many\r\nevils of India’s caste system several advantages have accrued from\r\nit. Its existence has tended to make the people of India conservative\r\nand tolerant. With the institution of caste they felt so well\r\nfortified within themselves that they did not fear the influx of new\r\nideas into their midst. India offered a safe and welcome home to the\r\noppressed minorities from other lands. The Parsis and Jews came and\r\nsettled there. They were not merely tolerated but welcomed by the\r\nHindus, because the latter, assured of their own wonderful powers of\r\nresistance, had nothing to fear from outside influences. The Hindu\r\ncaste system may be described as “the social formulation of defence\r\nminus all elements of aggression.” Since the beginning of her history\r\nIndia has been subjected to numerous invasions, but she has stood\r\nagainst them successfully. In the cultural sense India, instead of\r\nbeing conquered, “has always succeeded in conquering her conquerors.”\r\nThe invaders belonging to different civilizations and races have come\r\nand disappeared, one after the other; but India still survives.[32]\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Hindus’ scheme of the division of labor care was taken to\r\nassign to every man his task and remuneration in such a manner as to\r\navoid all unnecessary friction among the different classes. Its value\r\nwill be readily recognized by those who are familiar with the evils\r\nof modern industrialism, arising from the intense hatred within the\r\ndifferent classes.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be said to the credit of Hindu sociologists that, at\r\nleast, they had the courage to face the problem of race-conflict with a\r\nsympathetic mind. The problem was not of their creation. The diversity\r\nof races existed in India before these new Aryan invaders came into\r\nthe country. The caste system of the Hindus was the result of their\r\nsincere endeavors to seek a solution of their difficult problem. Its\r\nobject was to keep the different races together and yet afford each one\r\nof them opportunity to express itself in its own separate way. “India\r\nmay not have achieved complete success in this. But who else has? It\r\nwas, at least, better than the best which the West has thought of so\r\nfar. There the stronger races have either exterminated the weaker ones\r\nlike the Red Indians in America, or shut them out completely like the\r\nAsiatics in Australia and America.” “Whatever may be its merits,” says\r\nTagore, “you will have to admit that it does not spring from the higher\r\nimpulses of civilization, but from the lower passions of greed and\r\nhatred.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Max Müller.\r\n\r\n[26] Tagore.\r\n\r\n[27] Tagore.\r\n\r\n[28] Quoted from Otto Rothfield--_Women of India._\r\n\r\n[29] E.

He is the author of the\r\nNon-violent Non-coöperation movement, adopted by the Indian National\r\nCongress as a weapon of passive resistance wherewith to win India’s\r\nfreedom. In March, 1922, because of his public activities in India\r\nas a leader of this movement, Gandhi was convicted on the charge of\r\npromoting disaffection towards the British crown, and was sentenced\r\nto six years’ incarceration. He was released from prison, however, in\r\n1924 by a special order of the British Labor Government. Since that\r\ntime he has remained the most powerful and beloved public figure in the\r\nnationalist movement of India.\r\n\r\nHis movement has aroused great interest among the different peoples of\r\nthe world. But the information given to the outside public has been so\r\nvague and disconnected that it has led to very erroneous conclusions.\r\nSo much of pure nonsense in the form of praise and ridicule of Gandhi\r\nand his activities has been passed around that it has become difficult\r\nfor the earnest student to separate the real from the fictitious.\r\nTherefore it is only fitting that we should make a careful study of the\r\nman and his message.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of scholars, students, missionaries, travelers,\r\nand writers have studied him carefully enough to enable them to\r\nform a reliable opinion. Irrespective of their missions, opinions,\r\nand designations, these investigators all agree as to the magnetic\r\npersonality of Gandhi and to the purity of his private and public\r\nlife. “His sweet, subtle sense of humor, and his profound confidence\r\nin the ultimate triumph of truth and justice as against falsehood and\r\noppression never fail to influence and inspire everyone who comes his\r\nway.” Even the very judge who, seven years ago, sentenced him to six\r\nyears’ incarceration could not resist the temptation to call him “a\r\ngreat patriot and a great leader,” and to pay him the tribute: “Even\r\nthose who differ from you in politics look up to you as a man of high\r\nideals and as leading a noble and even saintly life.”\r\n\r\nGandhi, born at Ahmedabad (India) in October, 1869, had all the\r\nadvantages of an early education under careful guidance. His father,\r\nKaramchand Gandhi, a wealthy man and a statesman by profession,\r\ncombined in himself the highest political wisdom and learning together\r\nwith an utter simplicity of manner. He was respected throughout Deccan,\r\nin which (province) he was prime minister of a native state, as a\r\njust man and an uncompromising champion of the weak. “Gandhi’s mother\r\nwas an orthodox Hindu lady, with stubborn religious conceptions. She\r\nled a very simple and dignified life after the teachings of the Hindu\r\nVedas.” She was a very jealous and affectionate mother and took a deep\r\ninterest in the bringing up of her children. Gandhi, the favorite\r\n“Mohan” of his parents, was the center of all the cares and discipline\r\nof his loving relatives. He inherited from his father a determination\r\nof purpose and the tenacity of a powerful will, and from his mother\r\na sense of religious and moral purity of life. After graduating from\r\na native school in his home town, he was sent to England to finish\r\nhis education. He fitted himself for the bar at the University of\r\nLondon, and on his return to India was admitted as an advocate of\r\nthe High Court of Bombay. While still in London, Gandhi acquired the\r\nhabit of passing the best part of his days in solitude. From the\r\ntemptations of the boisterous London life he could find escape only\r\nwhen he sat alone by his window, violin in his lap, and thought of\r\nan unconquered spiritual world in his mind. A product of the early\r\nfavorable circumstances and all the advanced education, Gandhi is thus\r\na highly cultured gentleman with finished manners. He possesses a happy\r\ntemperament with but a tinge of melancholy pervading his life and\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nAs a patriot and leader of an oppressed people struggling for freedom,\r\nGandhi belongs in the category of the world’s great liberators with\r\nsuch men as Washington, Lincoln, and Mazzini. As a saintly person who\r\nhas dedicated his life to preaching the gospel of love and truth, and\r\nwho has actually lived up to his preachings, he ranks among such of the\r\nworld’s great sages as Buddha, Jesus, and Socrates. On the one hand a\r\ndangerous political agitator, an untiring and unresting promoter of\r\na huge mass revolution; yet on the other an uncompromising champion\r\nof non-violence, a saint with the motto, “Love thine enemies,” Gandhi\r\nstands unique, supreme, unequalled, and unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nHis theory of a non-violent mass revolution aiming at the dethronement\r\nof a powerful, militaristic government like the British Bureaucracy in\r\nIndia, though strange and impractical at first thought, is yet very\r\nsimple and straightforward.\r\n\r\n“Man is born free, and yet,” lamented Rousseau, “he is everywhere\r\nin chains.” “Man is born free, why should he refuse to live free?”\r\nquestions Gandhi. Freedom is man’s birthright. With unlimited liberty\r\nin thought and action man could live in perfect peace and harmony on\r\ncondition that all men would rigidly observe their own duties and keep\r\nwithin their own rights. “But men as they are and not as they should\r\nbe, possess a certain amount of animal nature. In some it is subdued,\r\nwhile in others, let loose, it becomes the cause of disturbance and\r\ndislocates all freedom.” To safeguard against the encroachment of such\r\nnatures on the “natural rights” and privileges of others, men have\r\norganized themselves into groups called states. “By so doing, each\r\nvoluntary member of this state foregoes some of his personal rights\r\nin exchange for certain individual privileges and communal rights to\r\nbe secured under its protection. The government of a country is thus\r\na matter of voluntary choice by its people and is organized to carry\r\non such functions as shall conduce to the highest good of the maximum\r\nnumber.” When it becomes corrupt, when instead of protecting its\r\nmembers from every form of evil and disorder, it becomes an instrument\r\nof the forces of darkness and a tool of corruption, citizens have\r\nan inalienable right to demand a change in the existing order. They\r\nmight first attempt peaceful reform, but should such attempts come to\r\nnought, the right of revolution is theirs. It is indeed their right\r\nto refuse their coöperation, direct or indirect, with a government\r\nwhich has been responsible for the spiritual decadence and political\r\ndegeneracy of their country. Gandhi explains his attitude thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “We must refuse to wait for the wrong to be righted till the\r\n     wrong-doer has been roused to a sense of his iniquity. We must\r\n     not, for fear of ourselves or others having to suffer, remain\r\n     participators in it. But we must combat the wrong by ceasing to\r\n     assist the wrong-doer directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n     “If a father does an injustice, it is the duty of his children to\r\n     leave the parental roof. If the head-master of a school conducts\r\n     his institution on an immoral basis, the pupils must leave school.\r\n     If the chairman of a corporation is corrupt, the members must\r\n     wash their hands clean of his corruption by withdrawing from it;\r\n     even so, if a government does a grave injustice, the subject must\r\n     withdraw coöperation, wholly or partially, sufficiently to wean\r\n     the ruler from his wickedness. In each of the cases conceived by\r\n     me, there is an element of suffering whether mental or physical.\r\n     Without such suffering, it is impossible to attain freedom.”\r\n\r\n                          *       *       *\r\n\r\n     “The business of every god-fearing person is to dissociate himself\r\n     from evil in total disregard of consequences. He must have faith\r\n     in a good deed producing only a good result; that in my opinion\r\n     is the Gita doctrine of work without attachment. God does not\r\n     permit him to peep into the future. He follows truth although the\r\n     following of it may endanger his very life. He knows that it is\r\n     better to die in the way of God than to live in the way of Satan.\r\n     Therefore whoever is satisfied that this Government represents\r\n     the activity of Satan has no choice left to him but to dissociate\r\n     himself from it....”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a period of more than twenty-five years, Gandhi coöperated with the\r\nBritish Empire whenever it was threatened and stood in need. Though\r\nhe vehemently criticized it when it went wrong, yet he did not wish\r\nits destruction until his final decision of non-coöperation in 1920.\r\n“He felt, that in spite of its abuses and shortcomings, the system was\r\nmainly and intrinsically good.” Gandhi joined in the World War on the\r\nside of the Allies. When the war started, he was in England, where he\r\norganized an Ambulance Corps from among the group of his compatriots\r\nresiding there. Later on, in India, he accepted a position in the\r\nBritish Recruiting Service as an honorary officer, and strained himself\r\nto the breaking point in his efforts to assist Great Britain.\r\n\r\n“Gandhi gave proofs of his loyalty to the Empire and of his faith\r\nin British justice by valuable services also on the occasion of the\r\nAnglo-Boer war (1899) and the Zulu revolt (1906). In recognition of\r\nhis services on the two latter occasions he was awarded gold medals,\r\nand his name was each time mentioned in the dispatches. Later, on his\r\nreturn to India, he was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal by Lord\r\nHardinge in recognition of his humanitarian services in South Africa.”\r\nThese medals he determinedly, though regretfully, returned to the\r\nViceroy of India on August 1, 1920. The letter that accompanied them\r\nbesides other things contained this statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Your Excellency’s light-hearted treatment of the official crime,\r\n     your exoneration of Sir Michael O’Dwyer, Mr. Montague’s dispatch\r\n     and above all the shameful ignorance of the Punjab events and\r\n     callous disregard of the feelings of Indians betrayed by the House\r\n     of Lords, have filled me with the gravest misgivings regarding\r\n     the future of the Empire, have estranged me completely from the\r\n     present Government and have disabled me from tendering, as I have\r\n     hitherto whole-heartedly tendered, my loyal coöperation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHis statement in court at the time of his conviction in March, 1922,\r\nwhen he pleaded guilty, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “From a staunch loyalist and coöperator, I have become an\r\n     uncompromising disaffectionist and non-coöperator.... To preach\r\n     disaffection towards the existing system of government has became\r\n     almost a passion with me.... If I were set free, I would still do\r\n     the same. I would be failing in my duty if I did not do so.... I\r\n     had to submit to a system which has done irreparable harm to my\r\n     country, or to incur the mad fury of my people, bursting forth\r\n     when they heard the truth from my lips.... I do not ask for mercy.\r\n     I am here to invite and to submit to the highest penalty that can\r\n     be inflicted upon me for what in law is a crime, but which is the\r\n     first duty of every citizen.... Affection cannot be manufactured\r\n     or regulated by law.... I hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected\r\n     towards a government which, in its totality, has done more harm to\r\n     India than any previous system.... It is the physical and brutal\r\n     ill-treatment of humanity which has made many of my co-workers and\r\n     myself impatient of life itself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief distinction between Gandhi and other liberators, the chief\r\ndifference between him and other leaders was that he wanted his\r\ncountrymen to love their friends, and yet not to hate their enemies.\r\n“Hatred ceaseth not by hatred; hatred ceaseth by love” was his sole\r\nplea to his fellowmen. He enjoined them to love their oppressors, for\r\nthrough love and suffering alone could these same oppressors be brought\r\nto see their mistakes. Thus, following his public announcement of\r\nthe non-coöperation policy he embarked upon an extensive tour of the\r\ncountry. Wherever he went he preached disaffection towards the existing\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nGandhi’s whole political career is inspired by a deep love for his\r\nsuffering countrymen. His heart burns with the desire to free his\r\ncountry from its present state of thraldom and helpless servitude.\r\nIndia, the cradle of civilization and culture, for ages the solitary\r\nsource of light and of wisdom, whence issued the undying message of\r\nBuddhist missionaries, where empires flourished under the careful\r\nguidance of distinguished statesmen, the land of Asoka and Akbar, lies\r\nto-day at the tender mercy of a haughty conqueror, intoxicated and\r\nmaddened by the conquest of a helpless people. “Her arts degenerated,\r\nher literatures dead, her beautiful industries perished, her valor\r\ndone,” she presents but a pitiful picture to the onlooking world.\r\nGandhi, the heroically determined son of India, feels the impulse\r\nto save his motherland from the present state of “slow torture,\r\nemasculation, and degradation,” and suggests to his countrymen the\r\nuse of the unique yet powerful weapon of peaceful non-coöperation.\r\nThrough this slow process of “self-denial” and “self-purification” he\r\nproposes to carry his country forward till the goal of its political\r\nemancipation and its spiritual freedom is fully realized. Political\r\nfreedom might be secured by force, but that is not what Gandhi wishes.\r\nUnsatisfied with mere freedom of the body, he soars higher and strives\r\nfor a sublimer form of liberty, the freedom of the soul. To the\r\nquestion, “Shall India follow the stern example of Europe, and fight\r\nout its struggle for political and economic independence?” Gandhi\r\nreplies with an emphatic and unqualified “No.” “What has Europe’s\r\npowerful military and material organization done to insure its future\r\npeace?” Romain Rolland answers: “Half a century ago might dominated\r\nright. To-day things are far worse. Might is right. Might has devoured\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nNo people, no nation has ever won or ever can win real freedom through\r\nviolence. “Violence implies the use of force, and the force is\r\noppressive. Those who fight and win with force, ultimately find it both\r\nconvenient and expedient to follow the line of least resistance; and\r\nthey continue to rely upon force in time of peace as well, ostensibly\r\nto maintain law and order, but practically to suppress and stifle\r\nevery rising spirit. The power may thus change hands, yet leave the\r\nevil process to continue without a moment’s break. Non-violence does\r\nnot carry with it this degeneration which is inherent in the use of\r\nviolence.” Gandhi is highly eloquent on this score when he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “They may forget non-coöperation, but they dare not forget\r\n     non-violence. Indeed, non-coöperation is non-violence. We are\r\n     violent when we support a government whose creed is violence. It\r\n     bases itself finally not on right but might. Its last appeal is\r\n     not to reason, nor the heart, but to the sword. We are tired of\r\n     this creed and we have risen against it. Let us ourselves not\r\n     belie our profession by being violent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“One must love one’s enemies while hating their deeds; hate Satanism\r\nwhile loving Satan” is the principal article of Gandhi’s faith, and\r\nhe has proved himself worthy of this lofty profession by his own\r\npersonal conduct. Through all the stormy years of his life he has stood\r\nfirm in his noble convictions, with his love untainted, his faith\r\nunchallenged, his veracity unquestioned, and his courage undaunted. “No\r\ncriticism however sharp, no abuse however bitter, ever affected the\r\nloving heart of Gandhi.” In the knowledge of his life-long political\r\nassociates (members of the Indian National Congress and of other such\r\norganizations), Gandhi has never, even in moments of the most violent\r\nexcitement, lost control of himself. When light-hearted criticisms\r\nhave been showered on his program by younger and more inexperienced\r\ncolleagues, when the bitterest sarcasms have been aimed at him by older\r\nassociates, he has never revealed by so much as a tone of his voice the\r\nslightest touch of anger or the slightest show of contempt. _His limit\r\nof tolerance has not yet been reached._\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years of his political life in India when he guided\r\nthe destines of his countrymen as leader of a great movement, Gandhi\r\nagain gave unmistakable proofs of the vastness of his love for mankind.\r\nThat his love is not reserved for his compatriots alone, but extends\r\neven to his bitterest enemies, he revealed clearly throughout the most\r\ncritical period of his life. His enemies, the British bureaucrats,\r\ntried to nip his movement in the very bud by using all the power\r\nat their command to discredit him in the eyes of his countrymen\r\nand of the world outside. Calumnies were heaped upon him from all\r\nsides. He was called a “hypocrite,” an “unscrupulous agitator,” a\r\n“disguised autocrat.” The vast number of his followers were branded\r\nas “dumb-cattle,” and hundreds of thousands of them were flogged,\r\nimprisoned, and in some cases even shot for no other offense than that\r\nof wearing the coarse hand-spun “Gandhi cap” and singing the Indian\r\nnational hymn. Even in such trying moments he remained firm in his\r\nfaith, and loyal to his professions. Evidence as to the undisturbed,\r\npeaceful condition of his mind and spirit is amply furnished by the\r\nfollowing statements which he gave to the Indian press in those\r\nturbulent days:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Our non-violence teaches us to love our enemies. By non-violent\r\n     non-coöperation we seek to conquer the wrath of English\r\n     administrators and their supporters. We must love them and pray to\r\n     God that they might have wisdom to see what appears to us to be\r\n     their error. It must be the prayer of the strong and not of the\r\n     weak. In our strength must we humble ourselves before our maker.\r\n\r\n     “In the moment of our trial and our triumph let me declare my\r\n     faith. I believe in loving my enemies.... I believe in the power\r\n     of suffering to melt the stoniest heart.... We must by our\r\n     conduct demonstrate to every Englishman that he is as safe in\r\n     the remotest corner of India as he professes to feel behind the\r\n     machine gun.”\r\n\r\n                          *       *       *\r\n\r\n     “There is only one God for us all, whether we find him through the\r\n     Bible, the Koran, the Gita, the Zindvesta or the Talmud, and He\r\n     is the God of love and truth. I do not hate an Englishman. I have\r\n     spoken much against his institutions, especially the one he has\r\n     set up in India. But you must not mistake my condemnation of the\r\n     system for that of the man. My religion requires me to love him as\r\n     I love myself. I have no interest in living except to prove the\r\n     faith in me. I would deny God if I do not attempt to prove it at\r\n     this critical moment.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that all this was at a time when Mr. Gandhi\r\nheld undisputed sway over the hearts of his three hundred million\r\ncountrymen. Setting aside all precedence his countrymen unanimously\r\nelected Gandhi dictator of the Indian National Congress with full power\r\nto lead the country in emergencies. A word from him was sufficient to\r\ninduce the millions of India to sacrifice their lives without regret or\r\nreproach. No man ever commanded the allegiance of so great a number of\r\nmen, and felt at the same time so meek.\r\n\r\nThrough the successive stages of “self-denial” and “self-purification”\r\nhe is gradually preparing his countrymen for the final step in his\r\nprogram, the civil disobedience. Once the country has reached that\r\nstate, if his program is carried through, the revolution will have been\r\naccomplished without shedding a drop of blood. Henry David Thoreau\r\nonce wrote: “When the officer has resigned office, and the subject\r\nhas refused allegiance, the revolution is accomplished.” That will\r\nbe the dawn of day, hopeful and bright. The forces of darkness and\r\nof evil will have made room for those of light and of love. But this\r\nwill not come to pass unless Gandhi’s policy is literally adopted, and\r\nultimately triumphs. He explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The political non-violence of the Non-coöperators does not stand\r\n     the test in the vast majority of cases. Hence the prolongation of\r\n     the struggle. Let no one blame the unbending English nature. The\r\n     hardest fiber must melt before the fire of Love. When the British\r\n     or other nature does not respond, the fire is not strong enough.\r\n\r\n     “If non-violence is to remain the policy of the nation, we are\r\n     bound to carry it out to the letter and in the spirit. We must\r\n     then quickly make up with the English and the Coöperators. We must\r\n     get their certificate that they feel absolutely safe in our midst,\r\n     that they regard us as friends, although we belong to a radically\r\n     different school of thought and politics. We must welcome them to\r\n     our political platform as honored guests; we must receive them on\r\n     neutral platforms as comrades. Our non-violence must not breed\r\n     violence, hatred, or ill-will.\r\n\r\n     “If we approach our program with the mental reservation that,\r\n     after all, we shall wrest power from the British by force of arms,\r\n     then we are untrue to our profession of non-violence.... If we\r\n     believe in our program, we are bound to believe that the British\r\n     people are not unamenable to the force of affection, as they\r\n     undoubtedly are amenable to the force of arms.\r\n\r\n     “Swaraj is a condition of mind, and the mental condition of India\r\n     has been challenged.... India will win independence and Swaraj\r\n     only when the people have acquired strength to die of their own\r\n     free will. Then there will be Swaraj.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGandhi has been bitterly assailed by both friends and foes for having\r\nconsented to render assistance to the cause of the World War in\r\ncontradiction to his own teachings of non-resistance. Gandhi has been\r\naccused of inconsistency and even his most ardent admirers often fail\r\nto reconcile his doings during the war with the doctrine of “Ahimsa”\r\n(non-violence to any form of life). In his autobiography he has tried\r\nto answer these objections, which we shall now examine. He writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I make no distinction, from the point of view of _ahimsa_,\r\n     between combatants and non-combatants. He who volunteers to serve\r\n     a band of dacoits, by working as their carrier, or their watchman\r\n     while they are about their business, or their nurse when they are\r\n     wounded, is as much guilty of dacoity as the dacoits themselves.\r\n     In the same way those who confine themselves to attending to the\r\n     wounded in battle cannot be absolved from the guilt of war.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement shows that his reasons for going into the war were\r\ndifferent from those of the Quakers, who think it is an act of\r\nChristian love to succor the wounded in war. Gandhi, on the contrary,\r\nbelieves that the person who made bandages for the Red Cross was as\r\nmuch guilty of the murder in war as were the fighting combatants.\r\nSo long as you have consented to become a part of the machinery of\r\nwar, whose object is destruction, you are yourself an instrument\r\nof destruction. And however you may argue the issue you cannot be\r\nabsolved from the moral guilt involved. The man who has offered\r\nhis services as an ambulance carrier on the battlefield is helping\r\nthe war-lords just as much as his brother who carries arms. One is\r\nassisting the cause of the war-lord by killing the enemy, the other by\r\nhelping war to do its work of murder more efficiently.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of the argument I once had with a very conscientious\r\nfriend of mine, who is a stubborn enemy of war and yet who recalls the\r\nfollowing incident in his life with a sorrowful look in his face. One\r\nday while he was living in London, a young friend of his came to say\r\nhis farewell before leaving for the front. Poison gas had been just\r\nintroduced into the war as a weapon. The combatants were instructed to\r\nprocure gas masks before departing, but the supply was limited, and his\r\nyoung soldier friend had to go without a gas mask. He left his permit,\r\nhowever, with the request that my friend should get the mask when the\r\nnext supply came in and send it to his regimental address. Two days\r\nlater the gas mask was mailed to this boy soldier at the battle front.\r\nBefore it reached there, however, the soldier was already dead. On the\r\nfirst day after the arrival of the regiment, it was heavily gassed by\r\nthe enemy, and all of those who had gone without the protective masks\r\nwere killed. The parcel was returned to my friend at his London address\r\nwith the sad news that his friend was here no more. He was bitterly\r\ndisappointed that the mask had not reached the beloved young man in\r\ntime to save his life. I interpret the whole affair in this way: In\r\nsending a gas mask to this English soldier, my pacifist friend was\r\nconspiring, however unconsciously, to kill the Germans. He wanted to\r\nsave his friend from death, but did he realize that at the same time he\r\nwas wishing more deaths on the enemy? He was, in fact, helping to save\r\none young man in order that this young man might kill more young men on\r\nthe other side. How does Gandhi justify his action in joining the war,\r\nthen? We shall let him speak once again. He writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “When two nations are fighting, the duty of a votary of _ahimsa_\r\n     is to stop the war. He who is not equal to that duty, he who has\r\n     no power of resisting war, he who is not qualified to resist war,\r\n     may take part in war, and yet whole-heartedly try to free himself,\r\n     his nation, and the world from war.\r\n\r\n     “I had hoped to improve my status and that of my people through\r\n     the British Empire. Whilst in England, I was enjoying the\r\n     protection of the British fleet, and taking as I did shelter under\r\n     its armed might, I was directly participating in its potential\r\n     violence. Therefore if I desired to retain my connection with the\r\n     Empire and to live under its banner, one of three courses was open\r\n     to me: I could declare open resistance against the war, and in\r\n     accordance with the law of Satyagraha, boycott the Empire until it\r\n     changed its military policy, or I could seek imprisonment by civil\r\n     disobedience of such of its laws as were fit to be disobeyed, or I\r\n     could participate in the war on the side of the Empire and thereby\r\n     acquire the capacity and fitness for resisting the violence of\r\n     war. I lacked this capacity and fitness, so I thought there was\r\n     nothing for it but for me to serve in the war.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far Mr. Gandhi’s explanation can answer the objections of his\r\ncritics we shall leave our readers to judge for themselves. The\r\nquestion is debatable, and admits of differences of opinion. If his\r\nargument does not carry conviction with other believers in the doctrine\r\nof non-resistance, Gandhi will not be surprised or offended. What an\r\neminent pacifist friend of mine wrote me after she had read the answer\r\nof Gandhi may be summed up thus:\r\n\r\nGandhi’s argument is entirely wrong. When she was asked to help the Red\r\nCross, she was also told that she had the protection of the army and\r\nthe navy. To this she replied that she did not wish the protection of\r\nthe army and the navy. As a conscientious objector to war, she felt it\r\nher duty to resist war to the best of her ability and power. When she\r\nstood against war with her full might, instead of being a mere cog in\r\nthe wheel of war, she was like a loose bolt in the machinery. Thus in\r\nher resistance “she was a positive force against war.”\r\n\r\nSuch in brief is the man Gandhi. As a specimen of the praise and\r\naffection that have been heaped upon him from all quarters, we shall\r\nin conclusion give the sketch of Gandhi from the artistic pen of his\r\nhonest admirer, Mr. Romain Rolland:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Soft dark eyes, a small frail man, with a thin face and rather\r\n     large protruding eyes, his head covered with a little white\r\n     cap, his body clothed in coarse white cloth, barefooted. He\r\n     lives on rice and fruit and drinks only water. He sleeps on the\r\n     floor--sleeps very little, and works incessantly. His body does\r\n     not seem to count at all. His expression proclaims ‘infinite\r\n     patience and infinite love’. W. W. Pearson, who met him in South\r\n     Africa, instinctively thought of St. Francis of Assisi. There is\r\n     an almost childlike simplicity about him. His manner is gentle\r\n     and courteous even when dealing with adversaries, and he is\r\n     of immaculate sincerity. He is modest and unassuming, to the\r\n     point of sometimes seeming almost timid, hesitant, in making an\r\n     assertion. Yet you feel his indomitable spirit. Nor is he afraid\r\n     to admit having been in the wrong. Diplomacy is unknown to him,\r\n     he shuns oratorical effect or, rather, never thinks about it, and\r\n     he shrinks unconsciously from the great popular demonstrations\r\n     organized in his honor. Literally ‘ill with the multitude that\r\n     adores him’ he distrusts majorities and fears ‘mobocracy’ and the\r\n     unbridled passions of the populace. He feels at ease only in a\r\n     minority, and is happiest when, in meditative solitude, he listens\r\n     to the ‘still small voice within’.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nINDIA’S EXPERIMENT WITH PASSIVE RESISTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we discussed the character and spirit of Mahatma\r\nGandhi into whose hands has fallen the duty of leading a country\r\nof 300 million people through a political revolution. It must be\r\nunderstood, however, that Gandhi is the leader of the revolution and\r\nnot its creator. Modern thinkers universally admit that individuals or\r\nsmall groups of reformers do not make revolutions. “Agitators or men\r\nof genius and ability in a backward community might stir up sporadic\r\nrevolts and cause minor disturbances, but no human agency can ever\r\ncreate mass revolutions. A successful revolution requires a state of\r\npolitical and social evolution ready for the desired transformation.\r\nThe history of the world’s important political and social revolutions\r\nfurnishes sufficient evidence in support of this theory.”[33] The\r\ninsurrection of the slaves headed by the able Spartacus, in spite of\r\ntheir early admirable victories, could not overthrow Roman domination.\r\nThe early attempts of the proletarian revolutionists, supported as\r\nthey were by leaders of genius and daring, were doomed to failure.\r\nIndia’s revolt against English rule in 1857 was ably led, yet it\r\ncould not succeed. In all these cases the same argument holds. The\r\ntime was not ripe for the desired change. In the present case, Gandhi\r\nhas been eminently successful because India was prepared beforehand\r\nfor a mass revolution. Passive resistance, or no passive resistance,\r\nthe Indian revolution was bound to come as a necessary consequence\r\nof the country’s long continued political oppression and economic\r\nexploitation. The people were already growing desperate when a united\r\nmass uprising was precipitated by the English government’s brutal\r\nactions of 1919. During the war the English parliament had promised a\r\nmeasure of self-government to the people of India as a reward for their\r\nloyalty to the Empire. Early in 1919, when the country was agitating\r\nfor the promised self-government, the English government of India\r\nforcibly passed against the unanimous opposition from all sections of\r\nthe people, special repressive measures in order to check the spread\r\nof nationalism in India. Peaceful demonstrations directed against the\r\nnewly passed bills were organized all over the country. Once again the\r\ngovernment acted harshly in using inhuman methods in the form of public\r\nflogging, crawlings and so forth, in the effort to suppress the rising\r\nspirit of freedom throughout the land. Just at this time Gandhi came on\r\nthe stage, and proposed to his countrymen the use of passive resistance\r\nfor the accomplishment of their political revolution. His resolution\r\nof non-violent non-coöperation was officially adopted by the Indian\r\nNational Congress, and the nation in its fight for freedom pledged\r\nitself to non-violence. What are passive resistance and non-violent\r\nnon-coöperation?\r\n\r\n“The ethics of passive resistance is very simple and must be known to\r\nevery student of the New Testament. Passive resistance in its essence\r\nis submission to physical force _under protest_. Passive resistance\r\nis really a misnomer. No thought is farther away from the heart of the\r\npassive resister than the thought of passivity. The soul of his ideal\r\nis resistance, and he resists in the most heroic and forceful manner.”\r\nThe only difference between his heroism and our common conception\r\nof the word is in the choice of the weapon. His main doctrine is to\r\navoid violence and to substitute for physical force the forces of\r\nlove, faith, and sacrifice. “Passive resistance resists, but not blow\r\nfor blow. Passive resistance calls the use of the physical weapon in\r\nthe hands of man the most cowardly thing in life.” Passive resistance\r\nteaches men to resist heroically the might and injustice of the untrue\r\nand unrighteous. But they must fight with moral and spiritual weapons.\r\nThey must resist tyranny with forbearance, hatred with love, wrong with\r\nright, and injustice with faith. “To hurl back the cowardly weapon of\r\nthe wicked and the unjust is useless. Let it fall. Bear your suffering\r\nwith patience. Place your faith in the strength of the divine soul\r\nof man.” “The hardest fibre must melt before the fire of love. When\r\nthe results do not correspond, the fire is not strong enough.” “The\r\nindomitable tenacity and magic of the great soul will operate and\r\nwin out; force must bow down before heroic gentleness.” This is the\r\ntechnique of passive resistance.\r\n\r\nThe actual application of this principle to politics requires\r\nexplanation. Individuals or groups have a right to refuse submission\r\nto the authority of government which they consider unjust and brutal.\r\n“The people of India,” says Gandhi, “have been convinced, after long\r\nand fearful trials, that the English government of India is Satanic.\r\nIt is based on violence. Its object is not the good of the people, but\r\nrapine and plunder. It works not in the interests of the governed, and\r\nits policies are not guided by their consent. It bases itself finally\r\nnot on right but on might. Its last appeal is not to the reason, nor\r\nthe heart, but to the sword. The country is tired of this creed and it\r\nhas risen against it.” Under these conditions the most straightforward\r\ncourse to follow is to seek the destruction of such an institution. The\r\npeople of India can destroy the thing by force, or else they can refuse\r\ntheir coöperation with its various activities and render it helpless;\r\nthen refuse their submission to its authority and render it useless.\r\n\r\nJust consider the case of a country where all government officers\r\nresign from their offices, where the people boycott the various\r\ngovernmental institutions such as public schools and colleges, law\r\ncourts, and legislatures; and where the taxpayers refuse to pay their\r\ntaxes. The people can do all this without resort to force, and so\r\nstop the machinery of the government dead, and make it a meaningless\r\nthing without use and power. To quote Thoreau once again: “When the\r\nofficer has resigned office, and the subject has refused allegiance,\r\nthe revolution is accomplished.” This is exactly what the people of\r\nIndia have set out to do by their present policy of passive resistance.\r\nHowever simple the theory may be, the practice of it is difficult\r\nand perilous. When a people resort to these peaceful means for the\r\naccomplishment of political revolution, they must be prepared to\r\nundergo unlimited suffering. The enemy’s camp will be determined\r\nand organized; from it will issue constant provocations and brutal\r\nexhibitions of force. Under these difficult circumstances, the only\r\nchance for the success of the passive resister is in his readiness\r\nfor infinite and courageous suffering, qualities that in turn imply a\r\npowerful reserve of self-control and an utter dedication to the ideal.\r\nEvidently to prepare a nation of 300 million people for this tremendous\r\ntask must take time and require great patience and courage. To quote\r\nGandhi:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Non-coöperation is not a movement of brag, bluster, or bluff.\r\n     It is a test of our sincerity. It requires solid and silent\r\n     self-sacrifice. It challenges our honesty and our capacity for\r\n     national work. It is a movement that aims at translating ideas\r\n     into action.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of India are moving on the road to freedom with dignity.\r\nThey are slowly nearing their goal. On their way the passive resisters\r\nare learning their lessons from bitter experience, and are growing\r\nstronger in faith every day. That they are headed in the right\r\ndirection and are quietly pushing forward we do know in a definite way,\r\nbut when they will emerge victorious we cannot say. To help the reader\r\nto catch the subtle spirit behind this movement, we shall quote a few\r\nmore lines from the pen of its leader:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I am a man of peace. I believe in peace. But I do not want peace\r\n     at any price. I do not want the peace that you find in stone. I do\r\n     not want the peace that you find in the grave; but I do want peace\r\n     which you find embedded in the human breast, which is exposed to\r\n     the arrows of the whole world, but which is protected from all\r\n     harm by the power of the Almighty God.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wearing of home-spun cloth by all classes of people, rich and\r\npoor alike, is one of the most important items in the non-coöperative\r\nprogram. Yet every time I have tried to justify it before my American\r\nfriends, I have received as response a shrug of the shoulders. Not only\r\nthe layman, but serious students of economics have replied: “That is\r\ngoing back into mediæval ways. In these days of machinery home-spinning\r\nis sheer foolishness.” Yet one does not have to be an economist to know\r\nthat “labor spent on home-spinning and thus used in the creation of\r\na utility, is better spent than wasted in idleness.” The majority of\r\nthe population of India lives directly upon the produce of the soil.\r\nThey remain in forced idleness for a greater part of the year. There\r\nare no industries in the country, cottage or urban. So the people have\r\nnothing to occupy them during their idle months. Before the English\r\nconquest, agricultural India had its supplementary industries on which\r\nthe people could fall during their idle time. But these industries have\r\nbeen completely destroyed by the English fiscal policy for India, which\r\nwas formulated with the desire to build England’s own fabric and other\r\nindustries upon the ruins of India’s industries. The country produces\r\nmore cotton than is needed for its own use. Under ordinary conditions\r\nthis cotton is exported out of the country, and cloth manufactured in\r\nthe mills of England is imported into the country for its consumption.\r\nFor want of a substitute people are forced to buy this foreign cloth.\r\nAnd they are so miserably poor that the great majority of them cannot\r\nafford one meal a day. Nothing could be more sensible for these people\r\nthan to adopt home-spinning during their idle hours. This will help to\r\nsave them, partially at least, from starvation. Let me quote Gandhi on\r\nthis subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I claim for the spinning-wheel the properties of a musical\r\n     instrument, for whilst a hungry and a naked woman will refuse to\r\n     dance to the accompaniment of a piano, I have seen women beaming\r\n     with joy to see the spinning-wheel work, for they know that they\r\n     can through that rustic instrument both feed and clothe themselves.\r\n\r\n     “Yes, it does solve the problem of India’s chronic poverty and is\r\n     an insurance against famine....\r\n\r\n     “When spinning was almost compulsorily stopped nothing replaced\r\n     it except slavery and idleness. Our mills cannot today spin\r\n     enough for our wants, and if they did, they will not keep down\r\n     prices unless they were compelled. They are frankly money-makers\r\n     and will not therefore regulate prices according to the needs of\r\n     the nation. Hand-spinning is therefore designed to put millions\r\n     of rupees in the hands of poor villagers. Every agricultural\r\n     country requires a supplementary industry to enable the peasants\r\n     to utilise the spare hours. Such industry for India has always\r\n     been spinning. Is it such a visionary ideal--an attempt to revive\r\n     an ancient occupation whose destruction has brought on slavery,\r\n     pauperism and disappearance of the inimitable artistic talent\r\n     which was once all expressed in the wonderful fabric of India and\r\n     which was the envy of the world?”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of India have made mistakes in the past, and they\r\nwill probably make others in the future. But that in sticking to\r\nnon-violence they are fulfilling the noblest ideal ever conceived by\r\nman, and in staying loyal to the spirit of passive resistance they\r\nare following a truer and a richer light will not be questioned. Will\r\nhumanity at large see the wisdom of passive resistance? To me in our\r\npresent state that seems very doubtful. It will be easy to convince the\r\ncommon man of the virtue and wisdom of non-violence. But unfortunately\r\nthe reins of our destiny are not in the hands of common people. Those\r\nwho hold the power over the nations of the world have other interests\r\nto look after than the common interests of the average man. They are\r\npledged to the service of other masters whose welfare is not the\r\nwelfare of the whole race. “The world is ruled at the present day by\r\nthose who must oppress and kill in order to exploit.” So long as this\r\ncondition continues, there is little hope for the reformation of human\r\nsociety. We must all suffer because we would not learn.\r\n\r\nMankind will not always refuse to listen to the voice of reason. A\r\ntime will come when the great masses all over the world will refuse to\r\nfight, when exploitation and wars will cease, and the different groups\r\nof the human race will consent to live together in coöperation and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the might of passive resistance was furnished during\r\nthe conflict between the British Government of India and the Akali\r\nSikhs over the management of their shrines. This incident shows to what\r\nheights of self-sacrifice and suffering human beings can reach when\r\nthey are under the spell of noble idealism. Sikhs are a virile race of\r\nfighting people. They are all members of a religious fellowship and\r\nform nearly one-sixth of the population of the province of Punjab\r\nin the northwest part of India. They constitute by themselves a very\r\nimportant community, which is closely bound together by a feeling of\r\ncommon brotherhood. They all go by the name of Singh, meaning the\r\nlion, and are rightly proud of their history, which though brief in\r\nscope of time, is yet full of inspiring deeds committed by the Sikh\r\nforefathers in the defense of religious freedom and justice during the\r\nevil days of a few corrupt and fanatic Moghul rulers of India. As a\r\nrule Sikhs belong to the agriculturist class and both men and women are\r\nstalwart and healthy-looking. Their men are distinguished by their long\r\nhair and beards. They are born with martial characteristics and are\r\nnaturally very bold and brave in their habits. Once aroused to sense of\r\nduty towards the weak and the oppressed, they have always been found\r\nwilling to give their lives without remorse or regret. Sikhs constitute\r\na major portion of the military and police forces of India and of\r\nseveral British colonies. Those tourists who have been in the East will\r\nrecall the tall, bearded Sikh policemen of the British principalities\r\nof Shanghai and Hongkong. Since the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, Sikhs have\r\nalways been regarded as the most loyal and devoted subjects of the\r\nBritish Crown in India. “On the battlefields of Flanders, Mesopotamia,\r\nPersia, and Egypt they have served the Empire faithfully and well.\r\nTheir deeds of heroism were particularly noticed during the most trying\r\nmoments of the World War.”\r\n\r\nBefore the British acquired the province in 1849 Sikhs were the rulers\r\nof the Punjab. During the period of their rule Sikh princes had made\r\nrich grants of land and other property to the historic temples and\r\nshrines of their religion. Because of the introduction of irrigation\r\ncanals some of these properties have acquired immense values in recent\r\nyears, their annual incomes in several cases running up to a million\r\nrupees or more.\r\n\r\nThe Sikhs have always regarded the temple properties as belonging\r\nto the community. And when it was brought to the notice of their\r\nprogressive leaders that the hereditary priests at some of the historic\r\nand rich Sikh centers had become corrupt and were wasting the temple\r\nmoney in vicious pleasures, the Sikhs organized the Central Shrine\r\nManagement Committee. The object of the committee was to take away\r\nthe management of all important Sikh shrines from the corrupt priests\r\nand to vest it in the community. The committee was first organized in\r\nNovember, 1920, and its members were elected on the basis of universal\r\nfranchise open to both sexes. The method of procedure followed by the\r\ncommittee was that of arbitration. A local sub-committee, consisting\r\nof the leading Sikhs in the neighborhood, was formed to watch over the\r\naffairs of every shrine. This sub-committee was to act in coöperation\r\nwith the temple priest, who was henceforth to be a subordinate and not\r\nthe sole master. Whenever the priests agreed to arbitrate the matter in\r\na fair manner, they were allowed free use of their residence quarters\r\nand were awarded liberal salaries for household expenses. By this\r\nmethod the Central Shrine Committee in a short time became masters of\r\nsome of the very rich and important Sikh shrines.\r\n\r\nWhile in several of the smaller places such transfer of ownership was\r\naccomplished through peaceful means, in some of the bigger temples\r\nthe community had to undergo heavy losses in life. For instance at\r\nNanakana Sahib, the Jerusalem of the Sikhs, a band of one hundred\r\nunarmed followers of the Central Committee were surrounded by a band\r\nof armed hirelings of the priest. They were first shot at, then\r\nassaulted with rifle butt-ends, and later cut into small pieces or\r\nburnt alive after being previously soaked with kerosene oil. The priest\r\npersonally supervised this whole affair of daylight butchery which did\r\nnot finish until the last one of the Sikhs had been consumed by the\r\nbloody bonfire. Later it was discovered that the priest had prepared\r\nfor the bloodshed long before, and that he had hired the armed ruffians\r\nand barricaded the temple premises after consultation with the local\r\nEnglish Justice of the Peace. The leading dailies of the country\r\nopenly stated that the English civil commissioner was a co-partner in\r\nthe crime, but the government took no notice of the fact. The Hindu\r\npopulation was not surprised that the priest who had murdered one\r\nhundred innocent, inoffensive, devout Sikhs escaped capital punishment\r\nin the British courts or that in his prison he was surrounded with all\r\nthe princely luxuries of his former palace.\r\n\r\nGuru Ka Bagh is a historic Sikh temple, situated at a distance of\r\nnearly eight miles from the central headquarters of the Sikhs in the\r\ncity of Amritsar. Through an agreement drawn between the Central\r\nShrine Committee and the temple priest on January 31, 1921, Guru Ka\r\nBagh had come under the management of a local board assisted by the\r\npriest. Six months later, presumably at the suggestion of the civil\r\ncommissioner, the priest burned all the temple records and drove the\r\nrepresentative of the Central Committee out of the temple premises;\r\nwhereupon the Central Committee took full charge of the temple. They\r\nwere in uncontested possession of the premises until trouble started,\r\na year later, from the arrest of five Akali Sikhs, who had gone out to\r\ncut firewood from the surrounding grounds attached to the Guru Ka Bagh.\r\nA formal complaint was obtained by the civil commissioner from the\r\nousted priest to the effect that in cutting wood for use in the temple\r\nkitchen the Akalis were trespassing on his property rights. The cutting\r\nof wood on the premises went on as usual until the police began to make\r\nwholesale arrests of all so-called trespassers.\r\n\r\nThis procedure continued for four days till the police found out\r\nthat large numbers of Akalis (immortals) were pouring in from all\r\nsides, everyone eager to be arrested in protecting the rights of his\r\ncommunity. Then the police began to beat the Akali bands with bamboo\r\nsticks six feet long and fitted with iron knobs on both ends. As soon\r\nas Akalis, in groups of five, started to go across for cutting wood,\r\nthey were assaulted by the police armed with these bamboo sticks and\r\nwere mercilessly beaten over their heads and bodies until they became\r\nunconscious and had to be carried away by the temple ambulance workers.\r\n\r\nThe news of this novel method of punishment at once spread throughout\r\nthe country like wild fire and thousands of Sikhs started on their way\r\nto Amritsar. The government closed the sale of railroad tickets to all\r\nAkali Sikhs wearing black turbans, which constituted their national\r\nuniform. The various highways leading into the city of the Golden\r\nTemple, Amritsar, were blocked by armed police. But after a call for\r\nthem had been issued at the official headquarters of the Central Shrine\r\nManagement Committee, nothing could stop the Akalis from crowding into\r\nthe city. Where railroads refused passage they walked long distances\r\non foot, and when river and canal bridges were guarded against them,\r\nboth men and women swam across the waters to reach their holy temple\r\nat Amritsar. In the course of two days the huge premises of the Golden\r\nTemple were filled with Akalis of every sort and kind--boys of twelve\r\nwith feet sore with blisters from prolonged walking, women of all\r\nages--and still many were fast pouring in.\r\n\r\n“Among them were medaled veterans of many wars who had fought for\r\nthe English in foreign lands and won eminent recognition, and had\r\nnow rushed to Amritsar to win a higher and nobler merit in the\r\nservice of their religion and country. They had assembled there to be\r\nruthlessly beaten and killed by the agents of the same government for\r\nwhose protection they had fought at home and across the seas.” These\r\nold warriors, disillusioned by their English friends, who were now\r\nconspiring to take from them the simple rights of worship in their own\r\ntemples, had not lost their independence and courage. They had always\r\nbeen the first to leap before the firing guns of the enemy on the\r\nbattlefields of England; they were first again here to throw themselves\r\nat the feet of their Central Shrine Committee, willing to sacrifice\r\ntheir lives at its bidding. All were eager, one more than the other,\r\nto offer themselves for the beating at Guru Ka Bagh.\r\n\r\nSeeing that their efforts to stop the Akalis from gathering at Amritsar\r\nhad been wholly unsuccessful, the Government issued strict orders\r\nagainst any person or group of persons from proceeding to Guru Ka Bagh.\r\nSizing up the whole situation, the assembled leaders of the community\r\nrepresented in the Central Shrine Committee at once resolved on two\r\nthings. First, the community would contest its right of peaceful\r\npilgrimage and worship at Guru Ka Bagh and other temples until the\r\nlast among the Sikhs had been killed in the struggle. Secondly, they\r\nwould steadfastly adhere to the letter and spirit of Mahatma Gandhi’s\r\nteachings of non-violence. Thirdly, they decided to send Akalis to Guru\r\nKa Bagh in batches of a hundred each, in direct defiance of the orders\r\nof the British Government. Before starting on the march, each Akali\r\nwas required to take an oath of strict non-violence; that he would not\r\nuse force in action or speech under any provocation whatsoever; that\r\nif assaulted he would submit to the rough treatment with resignation\r\nand humility; that whatever might be the nature of his ordeal he would\r\nnot turn his face backward. He would either reach Guru Ka Bagh and go\r\nout for chopping wood when so instructed, or he would be carried to the\r\ncommittee’s emergency hospital unconscious, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nThe first batch started towards Guru Ka Bagh on August 31, 1922, after\r\npreviously taking the vow of non-violence. The Akalis were dressed in\r\nblack turbans with garlands of white flowers wrapped around their\r\nheads. On their way, as the Akalis sang their religious hymns in\r\nchorus, they were met by a band of policemen armed with bamboo sticks.\r\nSimultaneously the Akalis sat down and thrust their heads forward to\r\nreceive blows. An order was given by the English superintendent, and\r\non rushed the police with their long bamboo rods to do their bloody\r\nwork. They beat the non-resisting Sikhs on the heads, backs, and other\r\ndelicate parts of their bodies, until the entire one hundred was maimed\r\nand battered and lay there in a mass unconscious, prostrate, bleeding.\r\nWhile the volunteers were passively receiving blows from the police,\r\nthe English superintendent sportively ran his horse over them and back.\r\nHis assistants pulled the Sikhs by their sacred hair, spat upon their\r\nfaces, and cursed and called them names in the most offensive manner.\r\nLater, their unconscious bodies were dragged away by the long hair and\r\nthrown into the mud on either side of the road. From the ditches they\r\nwere picked up by the ambulance workers and brought to the emergency\r\nhospital under the management of the Central Shrine Committee.\r\n\r\nIn this way batches of one hundred, pledged to the principle of\r\nnon-violence, were sent every day to be beaten by the police in this\r\nbrutal fashion and then were picked up unconscious by the ambulance\r\nservice. After the tenth day Akalis were allowed to proceed freely on\r\ntheir way. But the beatings in Guru Ka Bagh at the stop where wood for\r\nkitchen use had been cut, continued till much later. After a few over\r\nfifteen hundred non-resistant and innocent human beings had been thus\r\nsacrificed, several hundred of whom had died of injuries received and\r\nmany others had been totally disabled for life, the Government withdrew\r\nthe police from Guru Ka Bagh and allowed the Sikhs free use of the\r\ntemple and its adjoining properties.\r\n\r\nIt was an acknowledgment of defeat on the part of the British\r\nGovernment and a definite victory for the passive resisters.\r\nNon-violence had triumphed over brute force. The meek Sikhs had\r\nestablished their moral and spiritual courage beyond a doubt. Those who\r\nearlier had laughed at Gandhi’s doctrines now began to reconsider their\r\nopinions and wondered if it were not true that the soul force of man\r\nwas the mightiest power in the world, more powerful than the might of\r\nall its armies and navies put together. “Socrates and Christ are both\r\ndead, but their spirits live and will continue to live.” Their bodies\r\nwere destroyed by those who possessed physical force, but their souls\r\nwere invincible. Who could conquer the spirit of Socrates, Christ, or\r\nGandhi when that spirit refused to be conquered? At the time of the\r\nGuru Ka Bagh incident the physical Gandhi was locked behind iron bars\r\nin a jail of India, but his spirit accompanied every Sikh as he stepped\r\nacross the line to receive the enemy’s cowardly blows.\r\n\r\nThe amazing part of this whole story is the perfect peace that\r\nprevailed throughout its entire course. The program of passive\r\nresistance was carried to completion without one slip of action on the\r\npart of the passive resisters. No community in the whole length and\r\nbreadth of India is more warlike and more inflammable for a righteous\r\ncause than the Sikhs; and nothing is more provoking to a Sikh than an\r\ninsult offered to his sacred hair. Yet in hundreds of cases their\r\nsacred hair was smeared with mud and trampled upon, while the bodies of\r\nnon-resisting Sikhs were dragged by their hair in the most malicious\r\nmanner by the police; but the passive resisters remained firm in their\r\nresolve to the last and thereby proved their faith both in themselves\r\nand in their principles.\r\n\r\nThose who have not grasped the subtle meaning of passive resistance\r\nwill call the Akali Sikhs cowards. They will say: “Well, the reason\r\nwhy the Akalis did not return the blows of the police was because they\r\nwere afraid; and it was cowardice and not courage that made them submit\r\nto such insults as the pulling of their sacred hair and so forth. A\r\ntruly brave person, who has a grain of salt in him, will answer the\r\nblows of the enemy under those conditions and fight in the defense of\r\nhis honor until he is killed.” Although we do not agree with the first\r\npart of our objecting friend’s argument, we shall admit the truth of\r\nhis statement that it takes a brave man to defend his honor at the\r\nrisk of death itself. Yet we hold that the Akali who, while defending\r\nhis national rights, voluntarily allowed himself to be beaten to death\r\nwithout thoughts of malice or hatred in his heart against anybody was a\r\nmore courageous person than even the hero of our objecting friend. Why?\r\nTo use Gandhi’s illustration: “What do you think? Wherein is courage\r\nrequired--in blowing others to pieces from behind a cannon or with a\r\nsmiling face approaching a cannon and being blown to pieces? Who is the\r\ntrue warrior--he who keeps death as a bosom-friend or he who controls\r\nthe death of others? Believe me that a man devoid of courage and\r\nmanhood can never be a passive resister.”\r\n\r\nLet us stretch the point a little further in order to make it more\r\nclear. During the martial law days at Amritsar in 1919, the commanding\r\nofficer ordered that all persons passing through a certain lane, where\r\npreviously an Englishwoman had been assaulted by a furious mob, should\r\nbe made to crawl on the bellies. Those living in the neighborhood had\r\nsubmitted to this humiliation at the point of British bayonets. Later,\r\nwhen Mahatma Gandhi visited the lane, he is reported to have made a\r\nspeech from the spot which may be summarized thus: “You Punjabees, who\r\npossess muscular bodies and have statures six feet tall; you, who call\r\nyourselves brave, submitted to the soul-degrading crawling order. I am\r\na small man and my physique is very weak. I weigh less than a hundred\r\npounds. But there is no power in this world that can make _me_ crawl\r\non my belly. General Dyer’s soldiers can bind my body and put me in\r\njail, or with their military weapons they can take my life; but when\r\nhe orders me to crawl on my belly I shall say: ‘Oh foolish man, don’t\r\nyou see, God has given me two feet to walk on? Why shall I crawl on my\r\nknees, then?’” This is an instance of passive resistance. Under these\r\ncircumstances, would you call Gandhi a coward? You must remember this\r\ndistinction between a coward and a passive resister: a coward submits\r\nto force through fear; while a passive resister submits to force _under\r\nprotest_. In our illustration of the crawling order those persons who\r\nhad submitted to the order because they were afraid of the punishment\r\ninvolved if they disobeyed it were cowards of the first degree. But\r\nGandhi would be a passive resister, and you would not call him a\r\ncoward, would you?\r\n\r\nLet me give you a sample of the sublime heroism displayed by the Akalis\r\nat Guru Ka Bagh. In one instance the policeman’s blow struck an Akali\r\nwith such violence that one of his eyeballs dropped out. His eye was\r\nbleeding profusely, but still he walked forward towards his goal until\r\nhe was knocked down the second time and fell on the ground unconscious.\r\nAnother Akali, Pritipal Singh, was knocked down eight times. Each time\r\nas soon as he recovered his senses, he stood on his feet and started\r\nto go forward, until after the eighth time he lay on the ground wholly\r\nprostrate. I have known Pritipal Singh in India. We went to school\r\ntogether for five years. Pritipal was a good boy in every way. He was\r\nthe strongest person in our school and yet the meekest of all men. He\r\nhad a very jolly temper, and I can hear to this day his loud ringing\r\nlaugh. Inoffensive in his habits, he was a cultured and a loving\r\nfriend. When I read his name in the papers and later discovered how\r\ncruelly he suffered from the injuries which finally resulted in his\r\npremature death, I was indeed sorrowful. That such a saintly person as\r\nPritipal Singh should be made to go through such hellish tortures and\r\nthat his life should be thus cruelly ended in the prime of youth was\r\nenough to give anyone a shock. But when I persuaded myself that with\r\nthe passing of that handsome youth there was one more gone for truth’s\r\nsake, I felt peaceful and happy once more.\r\n\r\nLest the reader be at a loss to know what this whole drama of horrible\r\ntortures on the one hand and supernatural courage on the other was all\r\nabout, we shall give the gist of the whole affair as follows:\r\n\r\nAt the time when the issue was precipitated in Guru Ka Bagh the Central\r\nShrine Management Committee had already acquired control over many\r\nof the rich Sikh shrines, and become a powerful force in the uplift\r\nof the community. The committee was receiving huge incomes from the\r\nvarious shrine properties, which it proposed to spend on educational\r\nand social service work. Those at the helm of affairs were profoundly\r\nnationalistic in their views. Naturally, the British Government began\r\nto fear their power, which it desired to break through suppression.\r\nHence the issue at Guru Ka Bagh was not the chopping of fuel wood. The\r\nghastly motive of the Government was to cow the Sikhs and crush their\r\nspirits through oppression. How it started to demonstrate its power\r\nand how shamefully it failed in its sinister purpose has already been\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nMany other examples of the victory of soul force over brute strength\r\ncould be cited from the recent history of India. I chose the Guru Ka\r\nBagh affair as the subject of my illustration for two reasons. In\r\nthe first place, it was the most simple and yet the most prominent\r\ndemonstration of the holiness and might of passive resistance; and\r\nsecondly, the drama was performed in my own home town by actors who\r\nbelonged to my own community and were kith and kin to me in the sense\r\nthat I could know fully their joys and sorrows, their hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[33] Hyndman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nJALLIANWALLA MASSACRE AT AMRITSAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall relate briefly the story of what occurred in\r\nPunjab during the troubled days of 1919. These incidents, popularly\r\nknown as “the Punjab wrongs,” led to far-reaching consequences in the\r\nrelationship between England and India, and knowledge of them is very\r\nnecessary for a proper understanding of what has happened in India\r\nsince. We shall begin with the beginning of the World War and follow\r\nthe various incidents in the sequence of their occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge now that the people of India\r\nsupported the British Empire throughout the period of the war in a very\r\nliberal and enthusiastic manner. “India’s contributions to the war both\r\nin its quota of man-force and money were far beyond the capacity of its\r\npoor inhabitants.” Leaders of all states of opinion joined hands to\r\nassist the Empire in its time of need. It has been stated before that\r\nGandhi overworked in the capacity as an honorary recruiting officer\r\nuntil he contracted dysentery, which at one time threatened to prove\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nIndia was “bled white” in order to win the war. But for her support in\r\nmen and money England would have suffered greatly in prestige. Except\r\nfor Indian troops the German advance to Paris in the fall of 1914 might\r\nnot have been checked. The official publication, “India’s Contribution\r\nto the Great War,” describes the work of the Indian troops thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The Indian Corps reached France in the nick of time and helped\r\n     to stem the great German thrust towards Ypres and the Channel\r\n     Ports during the Autumn of 1914. These were the only trained\r\n     reinforcements immediately available in any part of the British\r\n     Empire and right worthily they played their part.\r\n\r\n     “In Egypt and Palestine, in Mesopotamia, Persia, East and West\r\n     Africa and in subsidiary theatres they shared with their British\r\n     and Dominion comrades the attainment of final victory.”[34]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the issue of the war still seemed doubtful, the British\r\nParliament, in order to induce the people of India to still greater\r\nefforts in their support of the Empire, held out definite promises of\r\nself-government to India after the war as a reward for their loyalty.\r\nMr. Montague, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, made the\r\nfollowing announcement on August 20, 1917:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The policy of His Majesty’s Government with which the Government\r\n     of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing\r\n     association of Indians in every branch of the administration and\r\n     the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view\r\n     to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India\r\n     as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that\r\n     substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as\r\n     possible, ...”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text of the above announcement was widely published in the\r\nentire press of India. Then followed the famous message of President\r\nWoodrow Wilson to the Congress with its definite pledge of\r\n“self-determination” to subordinate nations. This helped to brighten\r\nstill more India’s hopes for home-rule.\r\n\r\nNaturally, after the Armistice was signed, the people of India expected\r\nthe fulfilment of the war promises. “But the British Government,\r\nanticipating that soon after the war ended there would be a loud clamor\r\nin the country for home-rule, gave instead of self-government the\r\nRowlatt Act, which was designed to stifle the nationalistic spirit in\r\nits infancy.” The act gave unlimited power to the police to prohibit\r\npublic assemblies, to order indiscriminate searches of private homes,\r\nto make arrests without notification, and so forth. “Its main purpose\r\nwas in such a manner to strengthen the authority of the police and\r\nto enable them to root out of the country every form of liberal and\r\nindependent thought.” The plans of the British Bureaucracy were,\r\nhowever, defeated in their entirety, because the passage of the act did\r\nnot go through the Legislative Assembly as smoothly as was expected.\r\nThe whole country cried out in one voice against the Rowlatt Act, but\r\nit was passed by the British Government of India in the teeth of the\r\n_unanimous_ opposition of _all_ elected as well as government appointed\r\nIndian members of the Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nThis was once again followed by mass meetings and parades in protest,\r\npetitions to the British Parliament, delegations to the Viceroy, and a\r\nnation-wide demonstration against the Rowlatt Act. But the Government\r\naltogether ignored the sentiments of the country in this matter, an\r\nattitude which in turn helped to inflame the masses still more.\r\n\r\nGandhi considered the existence of the act on the statute books of\r\nIndia a national humiliation, and in protest he ordered the people of\r\nIndia to observe April 6, 1919, as a day of fast and national _hartal_.\r\n_Hartal_ is the sign of deep mourning, during which the whole business\r\nof the country is stopped and the people wander about the streets in\r\ngrief and lamentation. It was observed in ancient times only at the\r\ndeath of popular kings or on the occasion of some other very serious\r\nnational calamity.\r\n\r\nThe response to Gandhi’s appeal for the _hartal_ was very general. It\r\nwas surprising how quickly the sentiment of national consciousness had\r\nspread throughout the country. Overnight Gandhi’s name was on the lips\r\nof everybody, and even the most ignorant countrywomen were talking\r\nabout the Rowlatt Act. I remember that on the afternoon of April the\r\n6th, while I was walking toward the site of the mass meeting in my\r\ntown, the like of which were being held all over India, and at which\r\nresolutions of protest against the Rowlatt Act were passed, I saw a\r\ngirl of six nearly collapse on the street. After I had picked her up,\r\nand she had rested from the heat of the sun, I asked her who she was\r\nand where she was going. The little girl replied: “I am the daughter of\r\n_Bharat Mata_ (Mother India) and I am going to the funeral of Daulat\r\n(Rowlatt). Mahatma Dandhi (Gandhi) has called me.”\r\n\r\nThe day passed quite peacefully except for slight disturbances in a few\r\nplaces. But the excitement throughout the country, particularly in the\r\nPunjab, was very great. The situation was so tense that Gandhi sent\r\nhis strong admonitions of non-violence to his people in a continual\r\nstream. The activity at Amritsar started when, on the morning of April\r\n10th the English Commissioner invited Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal,\r\nthe two popular young leaders of the city, to his residence and ordered\r\ntheir deportation to some unknown place. When it became known that\r\ntheir leaders had been treacherously removed the citizens went on a\r\nsudden _hartal_, and a huge mob began to gather in front of the main\r\ncity gate. The mob soon organized itself into a procession, which\r\nstarted to move toward the District Commissioner’s residence to request\r\nthe restoration of Doctors Kitchlew and Satyapal. While crossing the\r\nrailroad bridge, the procession was met by armed police who soon\r\ncaused six casualties among the peaceful, unarmed mob. The mob soon\r\nturned back and fell upon the city in a wild fury. It divided itself\r\ninto different groups and expended its rage by setting fire to the\r\ncity hall, two English banks, and a local Christian church. Two bank\r\nmanagers, the only Englishmen present in town on that day, were cruelly\r\nmurdered. An English nurse who happened to be passing through a narrow\r\nstreet was also assaulted by the mob, but was soon rescued by the\r\ncitizens and carried to a place of safety. Later on, this benevolent\r\nChristian lady greatly endeared herself to the people of Amritsar by\r\nrefusing to accept any other indemnity for the assault than the price\r\nof her wrist watch which was lost in the scramble.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the news of Amritsar reached the other towns in the\r\nprovince, similar outbreaks of popular frenzy occurred in many places,\r\nwith this difference however, that at no other place besides Amritsar\r\nwere English residents injured. There were casualties on the side of\r\nthe mob everywhere, but none on the side of the English. On April 11th\r\nthe authority of the civil government was withdrawn, and martial law\r\nwas declared in most sections of the province of Punjab.\r\n\r\nThus did the trouble begin that resulted in the massacre of Amritsar.\r\nOn that fatal day, April 13th, a mass meeting had been announced to\r\ntake place in Jallianwalla Bagh, an open enclosure in the heart of the\r\ncity of Amritsar. As it happened, April 13th was also the Baisakhi day,\r\nwhich is observed all over India as a day of national festival. Large\r\ncrowds of country people had gathered into the city on that account.\r\nOn the morning of the 13th, General Dyer, the commanding officer\r\nof the city, issued from the headquarters an order prohibiting the\r\nJallianwalla Bagh meeting, and notices to that effect were posted in\r\nseveral places in the city. It should be mentioned here that unlike the\r\ntowns of America, there were in Amritsar at the time no universally\r\nread daily papers which could convey the Commanding Officer’s order\r\nall around in the short interval between its issue and the time of the\r\nmeeting. Under these circumstances General Dyer’s prohibitory order\r\ncould reach only a small fraction of the people in the city.\r\n\r\nNow let us come to the scene of the meeting. People began to assemble\r\nin Jallianwalla Bagh at 3 o’clock. There were old men, women who\r\ncarried babies in their arms, and children who held toys in their\r\nhands. They were all dressed in their holiday gala-dresses. “While\r\na few had come there to attend the meeting knowingly, the majority\r\nhad just followed the crowd and drifted in the Bagh out of simple\r\ncuriosity.” Whatever may have been its nature otherwise, it is\r\ncertain that the crowd at the Jallianwalla was not composed of bloody\r\nrevolutionists. Not one of them carried even a walking stick. They had\r\nassembled there in the open inclosure peacefully to listen to speeches\r\nand perhaps at the end to pass a few resolutions. At four o’clock the\r\nmeeting was called to order, and the speeches began. No more than forty\r\nminutes of this peaceful gathering, and the audience were listening\r\nin an attentive and orderly manner to the speaker who stood on a\r\nraised platform in the center, when General Dyer walked in with his\r\nband of thirty soldiers and suddenly opened fire on the crowd without\r\ngiving them any warning or chance to disperse. There was a sudden wild\r\nskirmish in the inclosure. People began to run toward all sides to save\r\ntheir lives; those who fell down were run over by the rest and crushed\r\nunder their weight. Others who attempted to escape by leaping over the\r\nlow wall on the east end were shot dead by the fire from the general’s\r\nsquad. As the crowd centered near the only escape from the unfinished\r\nlow wall, the general directed his shots there. He aimed where the\r\ncrowd was the thickest, and inside of the fifteen minutes during which\r\nhis ammunition lasted he had killed at least eight hundred men, women,\r\nand children and wounded many times that number.\r\n\r\nIt was already late afternoon when General Dyer, his ammunition having\r\nrun out, departed to his headquarters without providing any kind of\r\nsuccor or medical aid to the wounded who lay bleeding and helpless at\r\nthe scene of slaughter. Before the people of the neighborhood recovered\r\nfrom their consternation, it had already begun to get dark. As one\r\nof the rules of martial law strictly forbade walking in the streets\r\nof Amritsar after dark, it was impossible for any person or group of\r\npersons to bring organized relief to the wounded at Jallianwalla. The\r\nhorrible agonies of those that lay in the Bagh disabled and deserted\r\nwere heard with grim patience all through the night by the faithful\r\nwife Rattan Devi, when she sat there “in the midst of that ghastly\r\nhuman carnival” holding in her lap the dead body of her beloved\r\nhusband. She had run to the scene after the shooting in a mad search\r\nfor her husband. After she had looked underneath a dozen heaps of dead\r\nbodies and stumbled over many others, her eyes were drawn to the spot\r\nwhere her husband’s dead body lay flat on the ground. Rattan Devi’s\r\nhusband was already dead and beyond human aid. The devoted wife could\r\nnot restore the dead man to life, but how could she afford to leave his\r\nlifeless body in the stark neighborhood over night? She was too weak to\r\ncarry it home all by herself and there was no aid available. So she sat\r\nthere through the night holding a dead man in her lap.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of that night of suffering were related by Rattan Devi in\r\nher evidence before the Indian National Congress sub-committee, in\r\nwhich she described “the fearful agony of dying human beings, who kept\r\ncrying for drinks of water all through the night.” No friendly aid came\r\nto these departing souls in their last hours of deep distress. Afraid\r\nof General Dyer’s deadly vengeance their fellowmen had stayed away,\r\nwhile dogs from the neighboring streets wandered freely inside the Bagh\r\nto feast on the bleeding human bodies.\r\n\r\nAt the following session of the Indian National Congress which was held\r\nat Amritsar, I myself saw at its exhibition twenty pairs of little\r\nshoes, belonging to babies from a few months to a year old. These had\r\nbeen picked up in the Jallianwalla Bagh by various persons after the\r\nshooting, and they belonged to twenty innocent babies in their mothers’\r\nlaps who had been completely obliterated in the mad scramble that had\r\naccompanied the shooting. All that was left of these children was those\r\ntiny shoes. May God bless the souls of the dear little ones and many\r\nothers who fell victims to the haughty general’s bloody mood on the\r\nthirteenth of April, 1919, at Jallianwalla Bagh.\r\n\r\nLater, when General Dyer was cross-examined before Lord Hunter’s\r\nCommittee, which was appointed by the British Parliament to report on\r\nPunjab disturbances, he testified to the following:\r\n\r\n1. That there was no provocation on the part of the people of Amritsar\r\nfor the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre either on the day of the shooting\r\nor immediately before it. He had the situation well in hand and the\r\natmosphere was quite calm and peaceful.\r\n\r\n2. That his order prohibiting the meeting was issued the morning before\r\nthe meeting and reached only a fraction of the people in Amritsar on\r\nthat festival day of the thirteenth.\r\n\r\n3. That when he arrived on the scene of the meeting with his squad, he\r\nfound the people listening to the speaker in a calm manner and there\r\nwas no show of resistance offered to him. On the other hand, on seeing\r\nhim enter the premises, the audience began to run off in all directions.\r\n\r\n4. That he opened fire at the assembled meeting without giving the\r\npeople any warning or chance to disperse, and he continued firing while\r\nhis ammunition lasted--all the time directing his shots at places where\r\nthe crowd was the thickest.\r\n\r\n5. That he had brought a machine gun with him, which he had to leave\r\noutside because the lane was too narrow for it to enter. And he\r\nadmitted that the casualties would have been much greater if he had\r\nbeen able to use the machine gun.\r\n\r\n6. That his reason for the massacre at the Jallianwalla was to teach\r\nthe people a lesson, and he did not stop shooting after the crowd had\r\nbegun to disperse because he was afraid they would laugh at him. The\r\ngeneral wanted to show the people the might of the British rule.\r\n\r\n7. That he did not think to or care to provide succor to the wounded at\r\nJallianwalla. It was not a part of his business.\r\n\r\nReproduced below is a part of General Dyer’s testimony before Lord\r\nHunter’s committee:\r\n\r\n“Q. When you got into the Bagh what did you do? A. I opened fire.\r\n\r\nQ. At once? A. Immediately. I had thought about the matter and don’t\r\nimagine it took me more than thirty seconds to make up my mind as to\r\nwhat my duty was.\r\n\r\nQ. How many people were in the crowd? A. I then estimated them roughly\r\nat 5,000. I heard afterwards there were many more.\r\n\r\nQ. On the assumption that there was that risk of people being in the\r\ncrowd who were not aware of the proclamation, did it not occur to you\r\nthat it was a proper measure to ask the crowd to disperse before you\r\ntook that step of actually firing? A. No, at the time I did not. I\r\nmerely felt that my orders had not been obeyed, that martial law was\r\nflouted, and that it was my duty to immediately disperse by rifle fire.\r\n\r\nQ. When you left Rambagh [his headquarters] did it occur to you that\r\nyou might have to fire? A. Yes, I had considered the nature of the duty\r\nthat I might have to face.\r\n\r\nQ. Did the crowd at once start to disperse as soon as you fired? A.\r\nImmediately.\r\n\r\nQ. Did you continue firing? A. Yes.\r\n\r\nQ. What reason had you to suppose that if you had ordered the assembly\r\nto leave the Bagh, they would not have done so without the necessity\r\nof your firing and continuing firing for any length of time? A. Yes, I\r\nthink it quite possible that I could have dispersed them perhaps even\r\nwithout firing.\r\n\r\nQ. Why did you not have recourse to that? A. They would have all come\r\nback and laughed at me, and I should have made what I considered a fool\r\nof myself.\r\n\r\nQ. And on counting the ammunition it was found that 1,650 rounds of\r\nammunition had been fired? A. Quite right.\r\n\r\nQ. Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to\r\ngo in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns? A. I think,\r\nprobably, yes.\r\n\r\nQ. In that case the casualties would have been very much higher? A. Yes.\r\n\r\nQ. I take it that your idea in taking that action was to strike terror?\r\nA. Call it what you like. I was going to punish them. My idea from the\r\nmilitary point of view was to make a wide impression.”\r\n\r\nDuring the course of its history mankind has witnessed many massacres\r\nof a bloody and ruthless nature, but in every case before a massacre\r\noccurred, there was a provocation of some kind. Jallianwalla Bagh\r\nstands out unique in this respect--that it was an unprovoked,\r\npremeditated and pre-arranged, coldblooded massacre of at least eight\r\nhundred innocent men, women, and children, who were assembled in a\r\npeaceful meeting on the day of their national festival, with no thought\r\nof evil in their minds nor any desire to offer resistance of any sort\r\nor kind to anybody.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the story is that what had happened at\r\nJallianwalla Bagh on the thirteenth of April was considered so trivial\r\nand unimportant a matter that it took four months for the news to reach\r\nofficial London. After the report of Lord Hunter’s committee had been\r\npublished, and all the horrible details of the massacre were fully\r\ndisclosed, General Dyer was retired from the military service on full\r\npension. But on his return to England he was handed a purse of ten\r\nthousand pounds sterling, which amount had been raised by voluntary\r\nsubscription by the English people to recompense the general for his\r\nheroic work at Jallianwalla Bagh. Such was the reaction of the English\r\nnation to the massacre.\r\n\r\nGandhi’s interpretation of General Dyer’s “heroism” is, however,\r\ndifferent. He writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “He [General Dyer] has called an unarmed crowd of men and\r\n     children--mostly holiday-makers--‘a rebel army.’ He believes\r\n     himself to be the saviour of Punjab in that he was able to\r\n     shoot down like rabbits men who were penned in an enclosure.\r\n     Such a man is unworthy of being considered a soldier. There was\r\n     no bravery in his action. He ran no risk. He shot without the\r\n     slightest opposition and without warning. This is not an ‘error of\r\n     judgment’. It is a paralysis of it in the face of fancied danger.\r\n     It is proof of criminal incapacity and heartlessness.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will be in a position now to understand the meaning of\r\nMahatma Gandhi’s letter to the Viceroy of India, dated August 1,\r\n1920, and quoted on page 114 in which Gandhi gave his reasons for his\r\ndecision not to coöperate with the British Government of India. It\r\nmay be recalled that one of Mahatma Gandhi’s reasons was the “callous\r\ndisregard of the feelings of Indians” betrayed by the House of Lords.\r\nIt must be remembered here also that the massacre of Jallianwalla\r\noccurred on April 13, 1919, and it was exactly a year and three months\r\nlater that Mahatma Gandhi made his decision to boycott the British\r\nGovernment. During this interval he had persistently hoped for a change\r\nin the British attitude.\r\n\r\nThe massacre at Jallianwalla was only one part of the awful Punjab\r\nstory. What occurred at Amritsar and other towns in the province during\r\nthe martial days of 1919 was even more shameful and unworthy, “on\r\naccount of the outrage of human dignity it involved.” The issuing of\r\ncrawling orders and the throwing of bombs from aeroplanes over peaceful\r\ntowns constituted in part the doings of the military and police during\r\nthe unfortunate days of martial law. Nor was that all. Mrs. Sarojini\r\nNaidu, the first woman president of India, said while speaking on the\r\n“Punjab wrongs” before a large London audience (Kingsway Hall, June 3,\r\n1919):\r\n\r\n\r\n     “My sisters were flogged, they were stripped naked; they were\r\n     outraged.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of the English officials during the martial law period in\r\ninventing fancy punishments showed itself conspicuously in the town of\r\nKasur where, according to the findings of the Congress sub-committee,\r\n\r\n“1. School boys and men were whipped, ‘with no particular object,’ and\r\nthere was no question of any martial law offense. Prostitutes were\r\ninvited to witness the ceremony.\r\n\r\n2. People were made to mark time and climb ladders.\r\n\r\n3. Religious mendicants were washed with lime.\r\n\r\n4. Those who failed to salute Europeans were made to rub their roses on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n6. Public gallows were erected which were later abandoned. In all,\r\neighteen persons were hanged in the Punjab during the martial law\r\nregime, many of whom were totally innocent.”\r\n\r\nWe shall give below the evidence of Gurdevi, the widow of Mangal Jat,\r\nbefore the Congress sub-committee on what had occured at Manianwalla:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “One day, during the Martial Law period, Mr. Bosworth Smith\r\n     gathered together all the males of over eight years at the\r\n     Dacca Dalia Bungalow, which is some miles from our village, in\r\n     connection with the investigations that were going on. Whilst the\r\n     men were at the Bungalow, he rode to our village, taking back with\r\n     him all the women who met him on the way carrying food for their\r\n     men at the Bungalow. Reaching the village, he went around the\r\n     lanes and ordered all women to come out of their houses, himself\r\n     forcing them out with sticks. He made us all stand near the\r\n     village Daira. The women folded their hands before him. He beat\r\n     some with his stick and spat at them and used the foulest and most\r\n     unmentionable language. He hit me twice and spat in my face....\r\n\r\n     “He repeatedly called us she-asses, bitches, flies and swines and\r\n     said: ‘You were in the same beds with your husbands; why did you\r\n     not prevent them from going out to do mischief? Now your skirts\r\n     will be looked by the Police Constables’. He gave me a kick also\r\n     and ordered us to undergo the torture of holding our ears by pass\r\n     our arms round the legs, whilst being bent double.\r\n\r\n     “This treatment was meted out to us in the absence of our men who\r\n     were at the Bungalow.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCowardice, thy name is Bosworth Smith! Moral degradation in a human\r\nbeing could not go any lower than this. Search the entire history\r\nof mankind, and you will fail to find the equal of this act in its\r\nferocity and barbarism. How curious! The world believes still that\r\nEngland’s mission in India is that of civilizing a backward people.\r\n\r\nThe Jallianwalla massacre and other “Punjab wrongs” gave a great\r\nimpetus to the nationalist movement in India. What the Indian National\r\nCongress had failed to accomplish in its steady work of thirty-two\r\nyears, the Punjab persecutions and humiliations did in the course of\r\na few months. It has helped to arouse in the minds of the people of\r\nIndia a powerful national consciousness. It has been truly said that\r\nthe blood of the martyrs at Jallianwalla Bagh has made the heart of all\r\nIndia to bleed.\r\n\r\nThose who ask the question, “Why does India revolt?” may find a part of\r\ntheir answer in the word “Jallianwalla Bagh.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[34] Page 221. Quoted from Lajpat Rai’s _Unhappy India_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWHY IS INDIA POOR?\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly two hundred years ago India was the richest country in the world.\r\nToday it is the poorest. The gorgeous palaces of its kings with their\r\nenormous treasures were the objects of admiration and wonder for the\r\nother nations of the world. Its flourishing industries and its highly\r\nlucrative trade excited the greed and envy of the merchant classes\r\neverywhere. Its merchant ships laden with cargoes of valuable spices,\r\nsilken and cotton manufactures, and precious jewels sailed into the\r\nharbors of England and other countries of Europe. How the maritime\r\nnations of the world vied with each other to possess the trade of the\r\nEast Indies and fought over concessions in the Empire of the mighty\r\nMoghuls is a matter of common knowledge to all students of history. It\r\nwas the fame of India that excited the imagination of Columbus when he\r\nset out westward on his historic voyage; it was only by accident that\r\nhe discovered America. He had undertaken his voyage in search for a new\r\nroute to the fabulous riches of India, so that America really owes her\r\ndiscovery to the fame of that ancient land. Pick up any standard work\r\non mediæval history or classical literature and you will find that the\r\nriches of India and the splendor of the courts of its kings had become\r\nproverbial among the nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThat fame of East Indian wealth which had inspired the careers of many\r\na European explorer, military commander, and financial genius had\r\ntotally disappeared long before the end of the nineteenth century; with\r\nthe disappearing of the Indian kings the splendor of their courts had\r\nalso vanished; with the extinction of the Indian fabric industries her\r\nflourishing trade had ceased; and simultaneously with the loss of its\r\nhandicrafts and independence the prestige and prosperity of the nation\r\nhad come to an end. As early as the year 1900 A.D. India had begun to\r\nbe regarded by the historians as the poorest country in the world.\r\nHer daily per capita income was fixed at three quarters of a penny\r\n(equivalent to one and nine-sixteenths cents), and it was estimated\r\nthat the dawn of the twentieth century found among the inhabitants of\r\nIndia one hundred and sixty million people who did not know what it\r\nwas to have one square meal a day. The percentage of literacy, which\r\nincluded a knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic, had dropped\r\nfrom thirty-three per cent in 1757 to less than four per cent in 1900.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of this astounding change in the condition of an\r\nancient people like the East Indians? How did it happen that the same\r\nperiod which witnessed a sudden rise in the prosperity of most other\r\nnations of the world found in the Hindu nation an equal or even more\r\nsudden fall? What was the cause of the ruin of India’s famous silk\r\nand cotton industries and of the loss of its political and economic\r\nindependence? How did India drop from the highest rank to the lowest,\r\nfrom the proudest position to the humblest?\r\n\r\nFor this state of things in India writers have offered different\r\nexplanations, several of which are so weak in nature that they would\r\nnot stand even a superficial examination. The downfall of the country\r\nhas been variously attributed to the low, immoral character of its\r\npopulace and the selfishness and cowardice of their leaders, to a large\r\nincrease in its population, to the inertia and extravagance of its\r\nagricultural class, to the rigorous caste system, and to the hatred and\r\nanimosity which separates the different classes of its people. Some of\r\nthese evils were responsible in some measure for the political downfall\r\nof India, but the reason for India’s economic ruin must be sought for\r\nelsewhere. I maintain that the political subjugation of the country by\r\nEngland, and the pursuance by the latter of a fiscal policy dictated\r\nexclusively by the interests of British industries at the expense\r\nof the native claims, forms the basis of India’s poverty and of its\r\nconsequent “ills and woes.”\r\n\r\nWe shall first examine, in order, the various reasons for the country’s\r\npoverty which have been given by others, and which I believe to be\r\nunsatisfactory. Later I shall attempt to prove the truth of my thesis,\r\nthat the cupidity of English financial and industrial lords has been\r\nthe direct cause of India’s ruin.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages much has been said concerning the moral\r\ncharacter of the people of India. Those who have lived among them and\r\nhave studied their habits and ideals at first hand know what heights\r\nof moral and spiritual purity the inhabitants of that ancient land\r\nonce attained. Even in their present condition after generations\r\nof political subjection and economic poverty, both of which have a\r\ntendency to degrade the character of a people, it can be confidently\r\nsaid that the people of India, when measured by any moral, ethical,\r\nor cultural standard, will equal if not surpass any other people\r\nthroughout the entire world. In order to judge the moral condition of\r\nthis race at the time when their prosperity began to disappear, we\r\nshall let those speak who knew them at first hand.\r\n\r\nWarren Hastings, whose name has been immortalized through his\r\nimpeachment by Edmund Burke, had spent the best part of his life in\r\nIndia. Starting his career as a low-paid assistant of the East India\r\nCompany, he had risen to the position of Governor-General of India. No\r\none knew the people of that country better than did Warren Hastings,\r\nbecause of all foreigners he had the best opportunity to come in close\r\ncontact with them. Yet he was no unqualified friend of India, as was\r\nfully disclosed during his impeachment by the House of Commons in\r\nEngland. Twenty-eight years after his retirement from India, Warren\r\nHastings gave the following testimony before the British Parliament:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I affirm by the oath I have taken that this description of them\r\n     [that the people of India were in a state of moral turpitude] is\r\n     untrue and wholly unfounded.... They are gentle, benevolent, more\r\n     susceptible of gratitude for kindness shown them than prompted\r\n     to vengeance for wrongs inflicted, and as exempt from the worst\r\n     properties of human passion as any people on the face of the\r\n     earth.”[35]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been affirmed that overpopulation is the great cause of India’s\r\nbackwardness. But is India really over-populated? Has its population\r\nincreased very largely during the last two hundred years? When we\r\ncompare the census reports of the various countries of Europe, we find\r\nthat several of them, England included, are more densely populated than\r\nIndia. If we compare England and India, we shall find that the increase\r\nin population in the latter has been no greater than that in the former\r\nsince their political connection. In fact, since the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century the population of India has actually decreased, while\r\nthat of England and several other countries of Europe has increased.\r\n\r\nThat the agricultural class of India is a race of thrifty,\r\nhard-working, abstemious, and experienced farmers who understand\r\nthoroughly the art of tilling the soil, has been attested by many\r\nforeigners, who had the opportunity to study their habits at close\r\nrange. The quality of their knowledge of the farming profession and\r\nthe extent of their initiative and perseverance may be judged from\r\nthe achievements of Hindu farmers in California. Here was a class of\r\nagricultural people who had found it hard to make a decent living in\r\nthe “land of five rivers,” the Punjab. The Punjab is famous for its\r\nfertile soil and has an irrigation system which is regarded as the\r\nbest in the world. Yet its agricultural population is in a state of\r\nsemi-starvation because of top-heavy taxation and other unprogressive\r\nfeatures of the country’s administration. The moment these farmers from\r\nthe Punjab were settled in the favorable environment of California they\r\nmade a success of farming which is acknowledged by friends and foes\r\nalike. At the present time the anti-Asiatic laws of California prohibit\r\nHindus from farming, but it is a matter of common knowledge that Hindu\r\nfarm labor is paid higher wages in most sections than is American\r\nlabor, because the Hindus are “steady,” “hardworking,” “informed,” and\r\n“dependable.”\r\n\r\nIgnorance and sluggishness do not keep the Hindu farmer in a worse\r\ncondition than is his own class in other countries; the small area of\r\nhis holdings, excessive taxation, and lack of capital are continually\r\ndragging him backward. Eighty per cent of the people of India depend\r\nupon agriculture for their sole support. They live on the soil and\r\nby the soil. In former times India was also the home of flourishing\r\ncottage industries, that helped to increase the income of its enormous\r\nrural population. The invasion by English manufactures, caused by the\r\nselfish English fiscal policy for India, has completely uprooted the\r\nfabric industries of the Indian villages, a change which in turn has\r\ndriven the entire people to the land for their livelihood, thereby\r\nbringing the total ruin of their economic prosperity.\r\n\r\nLack of moral stamina in the people, overpopulation, ignorance or\r\nsluggishness of the agricultural class are thus not the real causes of\r\nIndia’s poverty. The economist who wishes to determine the cause of any\r\ncountry’s poverty will have to ask himself the same questions which\r\nthe Hindu historian, R. C. Dutt, asked in regard to India a quarter\r\nof century ago. “Does agriculture flourish? Are the finances properly\r\nadministered, so as to bring back to the people an adequate return for\r\nthe taxes paid by them? Are the sources of national wealth widened by a\r\nGovernment anxious for the welfare of the people?”\r\n\r\nIf it is true that in the same ratio as English power advanced in India\r\neconomic prosperity of the country began to decline, we might as well\r\ninquire into the nature of British rule in India. We shall restrict\r\nour inquiry to the answers of the following two questions: “Why\r\nEngland acquired India?” and “Why England holds India?” It is a fact\r\nthat England first came in contact with India through the medium of a\r\ntrading company, whose object in establishing its trade stations in\r\nthe Eastern country was profit-making. It is asserted that the British\r\nrulers of India have been guided in their work of governing the country\r\nby altruistic and humanitarian motives of a high quality. To what\r\nextent this claim of the English nation is founded on facts we shall\r\nexamine presently. In any case such humanitarian principles as may\r\nhave inspired the English rule in India, were of a much later origin.\r\nThe primary reason for which England established its connections with\r\nits Eastern dependency was one of pure commercial greed. At the time\r\nwhen the East India Company was organized in England the people of\r\nEurope had not been trained in the use of such terms as “altruism” and\r\n“civilizing the backward peoples.” These high-sounding epithets are\r\nproducts of much later times. The minds of the Directors of the East\r\nIndia Company were ruled by thoughts of large dividends and big profits.\r\n\r\nThe simple facts of the case are that the British went over to India as\r\ntraders in order to make profit out of India. They found the people\r\nof that vast and prosperous country divided among themselves, and\r\nscenting the favorable opportunity, they set out cleverly to capitalize\r\nthe weakness of the natives for their own gain. Yet according to the\r\nstandards of the times nothing in their behavior was unusual or wrong.\r\nThe world had never actually been ruled by altruism. The East India\r\nCompany set the greedy, but innocent and confiding princes and peoples\r\nof India one against the other, and using the natives as their tools,\r\nbecame masters of the land. They have ever since held them under the\r\nlash as chattels and slaves, “hewers of wood and drawers of water” for\r\nMother England. “Divide and rule” has been their constant motto. “Teach\r\nand liberate” has never crossed their minds. Such phrases have been\r\ninvented by shrewd politicians merely to amuse and satisfy a class of\r\nidealistic people in England and abroad who fall innocent victims to\r\nartfully told lies. Such slogans were never intended as rules of state\r\npolicy. Study carefully the tragic result of this long and laborious\r\nprocess of “liberating” a traditionally cultured and civilized people,\r\nand you will be convinced of the truth. The motto of “Divide and rule,”\r\non the other hand, they used mercilessly to emasculate a nation of\r\nhelpless people, whom they made the innocent victims of their lust and\r\ngreed. For the details of this early exploitation and “treading under\r\nfoot” of the people of India read Edmund Burke’s impeachment of Warren\r\nHastings. Thus he closed his immortal condemnation of the barbarities\r\nof his own people on the soil of India:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I impeach Warren Hastings to high crimes and misdemeanors. I\r\n     impeach him in the name of the Commons’ House of Parliament,\r\n     whose trust he has betrayed. I impeach him in the name of the\r\n     English nation, whose ancient honor he has sullied. I impeach\r\n     him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has\r\n     trodden underfoot, and whose country he has turned into a desert.\r\n     Lastly, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and\r\n     oppressor of all!”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. Digby, another Englishman, who lived in India for over\r\ntwenty years as a member of the Indian Civil Service, gives valuable\r\nhistorical and economic data on the subject of English Imperialism in\r\nIndia, in his book ironically entitled _Prosperous British India_. The\r\nbook is a scholarly work on history and economics and deserves the\r\nperusal of all thoughtful students. Mr. Digby shows that\r\n\r\n1. Since the beginning of the English rule in the country the per\r\ncapita income of the people of India has been gradually diminishing.\r\nThe daily per capita income was\r\n\r\n\r\n     in 1850    2 pence\r\n     in 1880   1½ pence\r\n     in 1900    ¾ pence.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. That in 1900, proportionately to income, the Indian subject of\r\nthe British Crown was taxed more than four times higher than was his\r\nScottish fellow-subject, and three times higher than his English\r\ncompeer. He quotes the following figures from the _Statesman’s\r\nYearbook_, 1900-1:\r\n\r\n\r\n               Proportion of Taxation to Income\r\n\r\n       Scotland with £45        India (outside 1,000,000\r\n       per head as average,     well-to-do people) with\r\n       one-seventeenth.         12s. per head as average,\r\n                                nearly one-fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. In 1900 thirty-four and one-fifth days’ income of every inhabitant\r\nof India was carried to England in the form of home charges. “Was ever\r\nsuch a crushing tribute exacted by any conqueror at any period of\r\nhistory?”\r\n\r\n4. Since the British have been in the country famines have been more\r\nfrequent, more widespread, and more deadly. “In the first quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century there were reported only four famines in the\r\ncountry, all of which were local. In the last quarter of the same\r\ncentury there occurred twenty-two famines which were general and spread\r\nall over the land.”\r\n\r\nA great nation was held a slave, was looted and routed, and yet the\r\nworld never heard of such a thing as British injustice in India.\r\nBut, let us ask, how was this great injustice perpetrated, this huge\r\nexploitation continued? This question is eminently sane and pertinent,\r\nand should be truthfully answered.\r\n\r\nThe English people were too intelligent not to profit by the experience\r\nof past conquerors and rulers over foreign races. As a result, they\r\ndid not evidently hold India down, but they kept her down. First, they\r\ndisarmed the natives totally. This procedure prevented armed rebellion,\r\nand the world was saved the news of consequent repressions. In other\r\nwords, the English did not kill the people of India; they killed their\r\nspirit. They robbed them of their land and of their daily meals,\r\nand made them submissive and weak. The English novelist, Thackeray,\r\ndescribed as follows the early stages of English rule in India:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “It is very proper that, in England, a great share of the produce\r\n     of the earth should be appropriated to support certain families in\r\n     affluence, to produce senators, sages, and heroes for the service\r\n     and the defense of the State, or, in other words, that great\r\n     part of the rent should go to an opulent nobility and gentry,\r\n     who are to serve their country in Parliament, in the army and\r\n     navy, in the departments of science and liberal professions. The\r\n     leisure, independence, and high ideas, which the enjoyment of this\r\n     rent affords has enabled them to raise Britain to the pinnacle\r\n     of glory. Long may they enjoy it;--but in India, that haughty\r\n     spirit, independence, and deep thought, which the possession of\r\n     great wealth sometimes gives, ought to be suppressed. They are\r\n     directly adverse to our power and interest. The nature of things,\r\n     the past experience of all governments, renders it unnecessary to\r\n     enlarge on this subject We do not want generals, statesmen, and\r\n     legislators; we want industrious husbandmen....\r\n\r\n     “Considered politically, therefore, the general distribution of\r\n     land, among a number of small proprietors, who cannot easily\r\n     combine against Government, is an object of importance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis policy was followed in India with unwavering resolution and fatal\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt is an unfortunate fact of recorded history which no well-informed\r\nperson may ignore, that under British rule the sources of national\r\nwealth in India have been narrowed in many ways. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury India was a great manufacturing as well as a great\r\nagricultural country. How its greatness disappeared totally, and it was\r\nleft as a very poor agricultural country only, has been explained by\r\nmany English and Indian writers. The decline of Indian industries has\r\nbeen attributed to the pursuance of a policy of commercial greed on the\r\npart of the British manufacturers. The English historian, H. H. Wilson,\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The British manufacturer employed the arm of political injustice\r\n     to keep down and ultimately strangle a competitor with whom he\r\n     could not have contended on equal terms.”[36]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall not tax the patience of our readers with irritating details of\r\nthe ways in which this arm of political power was actually employed.\r\nBut as a specimen we shall relate some of the incidents which helped to\r\nbuild the cotton fabric industry of England at the expense of India.\r\nIt was the time of the home and cottage industries, when individuals\r\nor small groups of hand weavers owned their establishments and worked\r\ntheir business on a coöperative plan. The English merchants found\r\nthey could not compete with the highly skilled and efficient Indian\r\nweavers; so they resolved to eliminate them altogether. This is what\r\nthey did. The agents of the East India Company went to the village with\r\nthe county magistrate (himself an employee of the Company, because the\r\nCompany was then the Government), and called together all the weavers\r\nof the village. The agent offered loans and advances to those weavers\r\nwho would work for the Company. When the weavers refused to accept\r\ntheir offers, the agents of the Company forcibly tied the money in the\r\nnapkins of the weavers, as a sign of their acceptance. The agents then\r\ndrove the workers back to their homes until such time as the Company\r\nshould demand their services. Thus they were forced to leave their own\r\nlooms and to work in the Company’s factories. There they were paid such\r\nlow wages that many of them fled from their homes, and hundreds and\r\nthousands of others cut their thumbs and forefingers in order to render\r\nthemselves immune from this forced labor.\r\n\r\nBy such means and others equally unfair “the prosperous class of Indian\r\nweavers was made tradeless and homeless, and many were driven into\r\nthe jungle to starve and die.” At the same time England completed the\r\nprocess of ruining the trade of India by charging an excise duty of\r\n65% to 75% on Indian manufactures imported into England and admitting\r\nEnglish-made goods into British India free of duty. These statements\r\nare not exaggerated. This procedure actually happened, and data\r\ngathered by the English themselves is freely available. But should the\r\naccount be doubted when such and worse things happen in our own day\r\neverywhere?\r\n\r\nAll the high offices of governmental control, civil and military, were\r\ngiven over to Englishmen, and Indians were employed as menials and\r\nclerks. To be explicit: during the first one hundred and twenty-five\r\nyears of British rule in India not one Indian sat on the provincial or\r\nnational executive councils of the country. Until after the World War\r\nno Indian held the commission of a lieutenant colonel in the British\r\narmy of India. If during this period India was not governed for the\r\ngood of the Indians, it is no wonder. How full of meaning are the words\r\nof John Stuart Mill:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The government of a people by itself has a meaning and a reality;\r\n     but such a thing as government of one people by another does not,\r\n     and cannot exist. One people may keep another for its own use, a\r\n     place to make money in, a human cattle-farm to be worked for the\r\n     profits of its own inhabitants.\r\n\r\n     “It is an inherent condition of human affairs that no intention,\r\n     however sincere, of protecting the interests of others, can make\r\n     it safe or salutary to tie up their hands. By their own hands only\r\n     can any positive and durable improvement of their circumstances in\r\n     life be worked out.”[37]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. Digby remarks on this account:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Thus England’s unbounded prosperity owes its origin to\r\n     her connection with India, whilst it has, largely, been\r\n     maintained--disguisedly--from the same source, from the middle of\r\n     the eighteenth century to the present time. ‘Possibly, since the\r\n     world began, no investment has ever yielded the profits reaped\r\n     from the Indian plunder’ (Brooks Adams).\r\n\r\n     “What was the extent of the wealth thus wrung from the East\r\n     Indies? No one has been able to reckon adequately, as no one\r\n     has been in a position to make a correct tally of the treasure\r\n     exported from India. Estimates have been made which vary from\r\n     five hundred million pounds sterling to nearly one billion pounds\r\n     sterling. Probably between Plassey (1757) and Waterloo the\r\n     last-mentioned sum was transferred from Indian hoards to English\r\n     banks.... Modern England has been made great by Indian wealth,\r\n     wealth never proffered by its possessor, but always taken by\r\n     the might and skill of the stronger. The difference between the\r\n     eighteenth and twentieth centuries is simply that the amount\r\n     received now is immensely larger and is obtained ‘according to\r\n     law’....”[38]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me quote Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, the “nightingale of India,” as to\r\nthe effect of British rule in India: “Our arts have degenerated, our\r\nliteratures are dead, our beautiful industries have perished, our valor\r\nis done, our fires are dim, our soul is sinking.”\r\n\r\nAll this has actually happened. Yet the world believes that England’s\r\nmission in India is unselfish and holy, that she is there to save\r\nthe souls of a demoralized people and to educate an ignorant and\r\nunprogressive nation. The nations have been made to believe that\r\nwithout her influence there would be social and religious tyranny in\r\nIndia, and that the weak would be left without a champion. The facts,\r\nhowever, read differently. The people are poor and weak. They are\r\nto a degree fanatic, and local conflicts occur occasionally between\r\nreligious groups. But do the English rulers of India prevent these\r\ndivisions or do they foster them? This is the important question.\r\n\r\nThe English are our masters. They make their laws as stringent as they\r\nplease; they hold their grip as tight as they wish. They say to us:\r\n“People of India, you are weak. Weakness is recognized in our system\r\nas a crime. Therefore you are doomed.” So they show the power in their\r\nhands and use it as they will. But when they say to us: “People of\r\nIndia, cease to quarrel and live in peace,” they are not only cruel but\r\nunjust and hypocritical, for the quarrels are their own creation, and\r\nour divisions they recognize as their main support. Says the Premier of\r\nEngland, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “As the red patches advanced over the map of India, sections\r\n     pulled themselves together to resist, but no power then existing\r\n     could develop that Indian cohesion which was necessary if the\r\n     new trading invader was to be hurled back. We were not accepted,\r\n     but we could not be resisted. India challenged, but could not\r\n     make her challenge good.... Moreover, we were not a military\r\n     conquering power imposing tribute and hastening hither and thither\r\n     in our minds. The invasion was not of hordes of men seeking new\r\n     settlements, nor of military captains seeking spoil, but of\r\n     capital seeking investment, of merchants seeking profit. It was\r\n     necessarily slow; it divided to rule, and enlisted Indians to\r\n     subdue India.”[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will now be ready to concede that England acquired\r\ncontrol over India and has succeeded in holding her mastery over the\r\ncountry through the policy of “Divide and rule.” He may grant also that\r\nthe existing fabric industries of India have been destroyed by the\r\nunfair use of political power in the interest of the growing British\r\nmanufactures. Then followed the invasion of the power loom in Europe\r\nwhich completed the ruin of India’s cotton industry. In the first\r\nplace India had been impoverished to such an extent that she could\r\nnot find the necessary capital to utilize the latest inventions; and\r\nwhen at last she did succeed in setting up steam mills their progress\r\nwas nipped in the bud through the imposition of an excise duty on all\r\nhome manufactures. Here was an evident inversion of the natural order\r\nof things. When machinery began to be introduced into the country,\r\na protective tariff was required to assist the infant industries.\r\nInstead, the foreign rulers of India imposed an excise duty on cotton\r\nfabrics, while foreign fabrics continued to be admitted free of duty.\r\n\r\nA similar mischievous policy was adopted in regard to the agricultural\r\nindustries of India. A government which has the welfare of the nation\r\nin mind tries in every way to improve the condition of the governed by\r\nincreasing their sources of income. It grants its farmers subsidies,\r\nhelps them to improve the quality of their crops, and extends their\r\nmarkets. What it exacts from them in the form of taxes is expended in\r\nthe improvement of their general condition. “It identifies itself with\r\nthe nation, and grows richer with it.”\r\n\r\nIn India from the time when the East India Company became the rulers\r\nof the country, this natural process has been reversed. These foreign\r\nrulers of India regarded their possessions as a “human plantation,” and\r\ntheir policy was to extract from the people all that was possible in\r\norder to swell the profits of the Company’s stockholders in England.\r\nTaxes on agricultural land were placed at the highest possible point\r\nin the beginning, and were then increased at every successive revenue\r\nsettlement. The over-assessment and collection of taxes with the most\r\ncallous disregard for the material condition of the farmers, plunged\r\nthe country into misery. Soon they began to flee from their houses\r\ninto the jungles, leaving the country desolate. India was visited by\r\nthe most horrible famines, and while natives died in the streets from\r\nhunger, the Company’s agents had the gratification of reporting an\r\nincreased collection from land taxes. It is estimated that the famine\r\nof 1770 carried away with it one-third of the entire population of\r\nBengal, and yet in the following year the land revenue of Bengal was\r\nraised and actually collected in cash.\r\n\r\nThe two letters which were written from the Company’s Government in\r\nIndia to its directors in England in the years 1771 and 1772 are of\r\npeculiar interest in this matter.\r\n\r\nDated 12th February, 1771: “Notwithstanding the great severity of the\r\nlate famine and the great reduction of people thereby, some increase\r\nhas been made in the settlements both of the Bengal and the Behar\r\nProvinces for the present year.”[40]\r\n\r\nDated 10th January, 1772: “The collections in each department of\r\nrevenue are as successfully carried on for the present year as we could\r\nhave wished.”[40]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that in making a collection of an increased\r\nrevenue, following a devastating famine, a great deal more ingenuity\r\nwas needed. Every sort of advantage was taken of the distress of the\r\npeople. Their crops were monopolized, and in most cases the seed for\r\ntheir next year’s crops was sold to realize the Company’s revenue. The\r\nhereditary owners of the lands were driven away from their holding, and\r\ntheir properties were transferred to the highest bidders for the land\r\nrevenue collection.\r\n\r\nA comparison between the land taxes claimed by the previous rulers of\r\nIndia and by the East India Company may be made from the following\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\nThe total land revenue collected by the last Mohammedan ruler of Bengal\r\nin 1764, the last year of his administration, was £817,533; within\r\nthirty years the British rulers collected an annual land revenue of\r\n£2,680,000 in the same province. During this interval the country\r\nhad been visited by two of the most terrible famines of its history.\r\nColonel Briggs wrote in 1830: “A land tax like that which now exists in\r\nIndia, professing to absorb the whole of the landlord’s rent, was never\r\nknown under any Government in Europe or Asia.”[41]\r\n\r\nAside from the heavy assessment of the Government there were, more\r\ndisastrous still, the extortions and premiums of the Company’s\r\nservants. Besides serving in the pay of the Company, each young clerk\r\nor old veteran officer was ambitious to make a sudden fortune to be\r\ncarried with him to England. Nearly everyone of the Company’s servants\r\ncarried on his private trade. This evil was stopped, however, by Clive\r\nin later years. English traders used all the tools at hand to take\r\nimproper advantage of their customers and of rival native traders.\r\n\r\nA typical case of this injustice occurred during the controversy over\r\nexcise duty in the Province of Bengal between its Nawab, Mir Kasam,\r\nand the Company’s servants. The English victory at Plassey (1757) had\r\ngreatly enhanced the prestige of the Company. In exchange for its\r\nprotection, the Nawab of Bengal granted to the East India Company the\r\nright to carry on its export and import trade, free of duty, within his\r\nterritory. This right the Nawab granted to the trade of the Company\r\nand not to the private trade of the officials of the Company. In spite\r\nof the repeated complaints from the Nawab, however, the Company’s\r\nservants continued to carry on their private business without the\r\npayment of any duties into the treasury of the Nawab. This arrangement,\r\nof course, helped the private traders to rear colossal fortunes in a\r\nvery short period, but the Nawab’s treasury soon felt severely the\r\nloss of its revenue. Moreover, the suffering of the native merchants\r\nwho had to pay heavy duties on their goods and thus found it difficult\r\nto compete with these law-breaking traders, reached a critical state.\r\nOverwhelmed from all sides, and finding his complaints to the Company’s\r\nagents unheeded, the generous Nawab in a moment of noble and royal\r\nindignation abolished all inland duties. By this act he personally\r\nlost a large income from his revenues, but he placed his subjects on\r\nequal terms with the employees of the East India Company. What followed\r\nwill be scarcely believed by our readers. The Executive Council of\r\nthe Company at Calcutta protested against this action of the Nawab as\r\na breach of faith towards the English nation. “The conduct of the\r\nCompany’s servants upon this occasion,” says James Mill in his history\r\nof India, “furnishes one of the most remarkable instances upon record\r\nof the power of interest to extinguish all sense of justice, and even\r\nof shame.” “There can be no difference of opinion,” writes another\r\nEnglish historian, H. H. Wilson, “on the proceedings. The narrow-minded\r\nselfishness of commercial cupidity had rendered all members of the\r\ncouncil, with the two honorable exceptions of Vansitart and Hastings,\r\nobstinately inaccessible to the plainest dictates of reason, justice\r\nand policy.”[42] More comment upon this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nHere was a class of officials in India who regarded the country, which\r\nthey had been called upon to govern in the name of God Almighty, as\r\nno other than a fishing pool. They declared that the purpose of their\r\ngovernment was to restore order in place of chaos, and justice instead\r\nof corruption. But when one of the native princes, inspired by nobility\r\nof heart, ordered a cancellation of his own revenues in order to\r\nbenefit his subjects, the government of the Company flared up in a rage\r\nand called his act of unselfish benevolence a breach of faith against\r\nthe English nation. Edmund Burke was after all right when he spoke\r\nabout the East India Company’s officials thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “ ... The Tartar invasion was mischievous, but it is our\r\n     protection that destroys India. It was their enmity, but it is our\r\n     friendship. Our conquest there, after twenty years, is as crude as\r\n     it was the first day. The natives scarcely know what it is to see\r\n     the grey head of an Englishman; young men, boys almost, govern\r\n     there without society, and without sympathy with the natives. They\r\n     have no more social habits with the people than if they still\r\n     resided in England; nor, indeed, any species of intercourse but\r\n     that which is necessary to making a sudden fortune, with a view\r\n     to a remote settlement. Animated with all the avarice of age, and\r\n     all the impetuosity of youth, they roll in one after another,\r\n     wave after wave, and there is nothing before the eyes of the\r\n     natives but an endless, hopeless prospect of new flights of birds\r\n     of prey and passage, with appetites continually renewing for a\r\n     food that is continually wasting. Every rupee of profit made by\r\n     an Englishman is lost forever to India” (Edmund Burke in a speech\r\n     made in the House of Commons in 1783).”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Plassey (1757) the English control over India began to expand\r\nrapidly, and the East India Company acquired the real nature of\r\na government instead of a mere trading company. Gradually as the\r\npolitical power of the Company grew in India and abuses crept in, the\r\nEnglish Parliament undertook to control all Indian affairs through\r\nappointed representatives. This policy was carried out in so far that\r\non the eve of the Sepoy Mutiny (1857), which led to the transfer of the\r\nGovernment of India to the British Sovereign, the English Parliament\r\nalready supervised the India affair through a cabinet minister and\r\na council board in England, and a governor-general appointed by the\r\nBritish cabinet in India.\r\n\r\nThe resentment of the people of India against the British rule and\r\nits consequent political and economic humiliations found its tragic\r\nexpression in the rebellion of 1857, commonly known as the Sepoy\r\nMutiny. The masses of the country led by the native army burst forth\r\nin mad fury against the yoke of their foreign rulers. The rebellion\r\nstarted in the United Provinces and at once spread like wildfire\r\nthroughout the British territories. Once again the British played the\r\nnatives against each other. The rebellion, which at one time threatened\r\nthe complete overthrow of the British power in the country, was crushed\r\nwith the assistance of Sikh regiments from Punjab. The suppression of\r\nthe rebellion involved a terrible loss of life, and some of the deeds\r\nof horror which were committed by the infuriated English soldiery\r\nremain as fresh in the minds of the Indian people to this day as they\r\nwere in 1857. The last of the Moghul emperors was deposed and all of\r\nhis heirs were fired from the mouths of cannon. Thousands of rebels\r\nwere hung, and their dead bodies were left hanging from the branches of\r\ntrees in order to excite terror in the minds of the populace. Kaye and\r\nMalleson’s _History of the Mutiny_ gives the most horrible account of\r\nthe butchery which the English officers carried on during the bloody\r\ndays after the Mutiny in the most indiscriminate and barbarous fashion.\r\nThe authors of this memorable account of the Mutiny state: “Already\r\nour military officers were hunting down the criminals of all kinds,\r\nand hanging them up with as little compunction as though they had been\r\npariah-dogs, or jackals, or vermin of a baser kind.” So ferocious was\r\nthe temper of the white soldiers, and so strongly had the fierce hatred\r\nagainst all “who wore the dusky livery of the East” possessed them,\r\nthat on one occasion in the absence of tangible enemies they turned\r\non their own camp-followers and murdered a large number of their loyal\r\nand unoffending servants. Sir Charles Ball writes: “Every day we had\r\nexpeditions to burn and destroy disaffected villages and we had taken\r\nour revenge. We have the power of life in our hands and I assure you,\r\nwe spare not.” Innocent old men and helpless women with sucking infants\r\nat their breasts felt the weight of the white man’s vengeance just as\r\nmuch as the vilest malefactors. It is recorded that in several places\r\ncow’s flesh was forced by spears and bayonets into the mouths of Hindu\r\nprisoners because the English knew that the Hindu so abhors cow’s flesh\r\nthat he will rather die than eat it. Kaye and Malleson write:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Afterwards the thirst for blood grew stronger still. It is on\r\n     the records of our British Parliament, in papers sent home by the\r\n     Governor-General of India in Council, that the aged, women and\r\n     children, are sacrificed, as well as those guilty of rebellion.\r\n     They were not deliberately hanged, but burnt to death in their\r\n     villages--perhaps now and then accidentally shot. Englishmen did\r\n     not hesitate to boast, or to record their boastings in writings,\r\n     that they had ‘spared no one’, and that ‘peppering away the\r\n     niggers’ was very pleasant pastime, ‘enjoyed amazingly’. It has\r\n     been stated in a book patronized by high class authorities,\r\n     that ‘for three months eight dead-carts daily went their rounds\r\n     from sunrise to sunset to take down the corpses which hung at\r\n     crossroads and market-places’, and that ‘six thousand beings’ had\r\n     been thus summarily disposed of and launched into eternity.”[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the Sepoy Mutiny an act was passed in the British Parliament\r\nby virtue of which the government of India was transferred from the\r\nEast India Company to the British Crown. The English King thus became\r\nthe ruler of India, but the people of India paid the price of purchase.\r\nThe shareholders of the Company were recompensed for this change, and\r\nthe amount paid to them was added to the national debt of India. The\r\ngovernment of the country changed hands, but virtually no change was\r\nmade in the policy. Even in the times of peace that followed the public\r\ndebt of India continued to increase. The new rulers were determined\r\nto promote English industries at the expense of Indian manufacturers\r\njust as had been done under the rule of the Company. India remained\r\nhenceforth a colony of the Empire for the production of raw materials\r\nat very low prices in the English factories. The manufactured goods\r\nwere afterwards re-shipped to India for the native consumption. The\r\nposts of dignity and high emolument in the government service continued\r\nto be regarded by the Englishman as his sole monopoly. No confidence\r\nwas placed in the natives; they were given no positions of authority,\r\nand were excluded from offices of responsibility as much as possible.\r\nIn other words, the interests of Indians were completely subordinated\r\nto those of the Englishmen. “The roads to wealth and honor were closed\r\nto the natives. The highest among them were considered unworthy of\r\nthose places of trust in the state employments which were held by\r\nyoung English boys fresh from school. The springs of Indian industry\r\nwere stopped, and the sources of the country’s wealth were dried up.”\r\n\r\nAs a result of the direct British rule over India the public debt of\r\nthe country rose from £51,000,000 in 1857 to £200,000,000 in 1901.\r\nThe agricultural class of India, moreover, the backbone of national\r\nprosperity in a country whose main occupation is agriculture, had\r\nbecome so poor that in one district in 1900 85% of the land revenue\r\nwas directly paid to the Government officials by money-lenders, the\r\nlandowners being wholly unable to meet their obligations. It was\r\nestimated by the leading medical journal of the world (_The Lancet_,\r\nJune, 1901) that during the last decimum of the nineteenth century\r\nnineteen millions of British Indian subjects had died of starvation,\r\nand one million from plague. And yet at the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury according to the financial arrangements of the country half\r\nof its total revenue was sent out of India to England each year. This\r\nincluded the upkeep of the India office in London, pensions to retired\r\nofficials residing in England, and interest on public debts.[44]\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind the reader will not wonder that India is\r\npoor. Place any other country in the world under the same conditions.\r\nLet her government be carried on by a foreign power with the complete\r\nexclusion of the sons of the soil from positions of responsibility;\r\nlet her fiscal policy be determined by the parliament of a rival\r\ncommercial nation without a single representative of the governed\r\nnation sitting in its councils; let its industry be crippled or\r\ndestroyed by a malicious use of political power by its foreign rulers;\r\nlet its agriculture be subjected to a heavy and uncertain land tax; let\r\nhalf its total revenue be carried away annually to a foreign land; and\r\nyou will not be surprised if the most prosperous nation in the world\r\nsinks in the course of a few years to the lowest depths of poverty and\r\ndegradation.[45]\r\n\r\nA nation prospers if its government is wisely administered in the\r\ninterest of the people, if the sources of wealth are widened, and if\r\nthe proceeds from taxation are spent for the uplift of the people and\r\namong the people. It is impoverished if its government is carried on\r\nby an outside power for the purpose of exploitation; if the sources\r\nof its wealth are narrowed from the crippling of its industries, and\r\nif its revenues are largely remitted out of the country without an\r\neconomic return. Americans stand in awe before the single monopoly\r\nof the Standard Oil Company. They are appalled by the magnitude and\r\ntyranny of its power. They should remember that the Standard Oil\r\nmonopoly is a pigmy before the British monopoly of India. England has\r\nexercised for nearly two hundred years exclusive and undivided control\r\nover the affairs of India. She has had power to shape the destinies of\r\nthree hundred million people according to her will, being responsible\r\nto no one but herself. She has held not only the government of India,\r\nbut its commerce, its finances, and its industry. In conclusion let\r\nus repeat the poignant remark quoted earlier, “The national wealth of\r\nIndia did not sprout wings and fly away. It had to be carried away.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Quoted from R. C. Dutt, _Economic History of British India_.\r\n\r\n[36] Quoted from R. C. Dutt.\r\n\r\n[37] Quoted from R. C.

India’s fundamental unity as a\r\nnation has been denied often by prominent scholars, while its historic\r\nand cultured oneness has really never been acknowledged by the English\r\nrulers of the country. Sir John Strachey remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “This is the first and most essential thing to learn about\r\n     India--that there is not and never was an India, or even any\r\n     country of India, possessing, according to European ideas, any\r\n     sort of unity, physical, political, social, or religious; no\r\n     Indian nation, no ‘people of India’ of which we hear so much.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that Sir John Strachey is profoundly wrong in his assertion\r\nthat India is not a nation in the “physical, political, social, or\r\nreligious” sense. On the contrary, it can be proved easily that\r\ngeographically, historically, culturally, and spiritually India is\r\nfundamentally one. Cut off from the north and the east by the snow-clad\r\nHimalayas, and surrounded on the south and the west by the mighty\r\nIndian Ocean, India is geographically, one country. Every part of the\r\ninterior is freely accessible from all sides. No natural boundary lines\r\nwithin the country divide it into different parts; nor do any high\r\nmountains obstruct the free passage from one part of the country to\r\nthe other. In fact, India is a physical unit, much more distinct than\r\nany other country in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the history of India, from the ancient Vedic period to\r\nmodern times, we find again the whole of the Indian peninsula, from\r\nBengal to Gujrat, and from Ceylon to Kashmir, mentioned always as one\r\nmotherland. “The early Vedic literature contains hymns addressed to\r\nthe Motherland of India. The epic poems speak of the whole of BHARAT\r\nas the home-land of Aryans.” We hear nowhere any account of separate\r\nnationalities within the country. The literature of India is full of\r\nthoughts about Indian nationality; but there is no mention of separate\r\nBengal, Madras, Gujrat, or Punjab nations, based upon geographic\r\ndivisions. Powerful emperors in ancient as well as modern times have\r\nruled over the entire peninsula in peace and security. “In fact, the\r\nbelief in the unity of India was so strong in ancient times that\r\nno ruler considered his territories complete until he had acquired\r\ncontrol over the entire peninsula.” Asoka ruled over the whole of\r\nIndia in perfect harmony. Akhbar’s power spread to the farthest ends\r\nof the land. And when, later on, the different governors of the border\r\nprovinces rose in revolt and refused allegiance to the successors of\r\nAkhbar, it was the great distance from the capital that suggested\r\nrevolt to the population of these distant provinces, and not a feeling\r\nof separate nationality.\r\n\r\nCulturally, again, India is one nation. In their daily habits, their\r\nethical standards, and their spiritual responses the Indians of\r\nevery religion and locality are fundamentally alike. “Their family\r\nlife is founded on the same bases; their modes of dress and cooking\r\nare the same. Their very tastes are similar.” They respect the same\r\nnational heroes and worship the same ideals. They have the same hopes\r\nand aspirations in this life and in the hereafter. As a result,\r\ntheir mental and spiritual behavior is similar. In fact, they are\r\nfundamentally one in mind and in spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is true that more than one dialect is spoken in the country. Until\r\n1920 the business of the Indian National Congress itself was carried\r\non in the English language because no other language was common to\r\nthe whole of India. It was really tragic that a people who were\r\nso profoundly proud of their national heritage and who aspired to\r\npolitical freedom were obliged to use at the meetings of their national\r\nassemblies an utterly foreign language. That the variety of languages\r\nwas in fact a very slight difficulty was demonstrated at the session\r\nof the Indian National Congress in 1920. From the Congress platform at\r\nAmritsar in 1919 Mahatma Gandhi had announced that at all subsequent\r\nmeetings the business of the Congress would be conducted in the Hindi\r\nlanguage, which is spoken by more than a third of the population of\r\nthe country. Teachers were sent immediately to different parts of the\r\ncountry to instruct the people in the Hindi language and when the\r\nCongress convened again in 1920 its business was carried on in Hindi.\r\nDelegates from Bengal, Madras, and Bombay made their speeches in Hindi\r\nas fluently as those from the United Provinces and the Punjab. Every\r\none felt satisfied at the change. A miracle had happened; _India had\r\nacquired a common tongue in the course of a year_.\r\n\r\nThe population of India is composed of many different peoples, who\r\ncame to the country originally as invaders, and later settled there\r\nand became a part thereof. Through the process of assimilation and\r\nadaptation extending over generations, the original Afghan, Mongol, and\r\nPersian conquerors of India have lost their peculiar characteristics,\r\nand become one with the rest of the population in their language,\r\nideas, and loyalties. The position of these foreign types in India is\r\nexactly analogous to peoples of different nationalities, who migrated\r\nfrom Europe into America in the early times. The interval of a single\r\ngeneration was usually sufficient to transfer the loyalties of European\r\nimmigrants from their native countries to the United States. The\r\ndifference between India and the United States in this respect is\r\nmerely that the Indian must go back many more generations to reach his\r\nimmigrant than must the American.\r\n\r\nThe chief barrier in the way of spiritual unity among the people\r\nof India, is religion. Hinduism and Mohammedanism are the dominant\r\nreligions of the country. The main portion of the population is Hindu,\r\nbut seventy millions of Mohammedans are scattered over the whole\r\ncountry in small groups. The Mohammedans came to India originally as\r\ninvaders and conquerors, and now occupy a position in the country\r\nof mixed authority and subjection. Wherever they form the majority\r\ngroup, they dominate the followers of other religions; while in\r\nother places they are held down as minorities. Since the beginning\r\nof their contact the Hindus and the Mohammedans of India have never\r\nagreed. Intervals of peace and harmony between the two communities\r\nhave occurred occasionally during the reigns of benevolent emperors\r\nlike Akhbar and Shah Jahan; but their hearts were never joined in\r\ntrue companionship even before the beginning of English influence.\r\nThe modern rulers of India have helped to strengthen the differences\r\nbetween the Hindus and the Mohammedans in so far that the animosities\r\nbetween the two religious groups were no less bitter in 1918 than they\r\nwere three hundred years ago. Since the days of Gandhi’s leadership,\r\nhowever, a great deal has been accomplished in building up a feeling\r\nof genuine comradeship and love between the Hindus and Mohammedans of\r\nIndia. When the Moslems all over the world were in a state of deep\r\ndistress at the Khilafat issues after the Severes treaty, the Hindus\r\nof India made common cause with the Moslems of the world. Khilafat was\r\nincluded in the Congress program as one of India’s main issues. This\r\nliberality helped to win the hearts of the Mohammedan population of\r\nIndia toward their Hindu compatriots, and the Hindu Gandhi was idolized\r\nby both religious groups, as leader and savior. It was an auspicious\r\nbeginning of friendship between these two isolated factions in India,\r\nand ever since it has been enthusiastically followed up by the younger\r\ngeneration of the country. It may be confidently expected that as the\r\nyouth of India acquire influence in the affairs of the country, the\r\nfriction between the Hindus and the Mohammedans will cease, and their\r\nage-long battles based upon superstition and error will come to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorse still in their ethical and spiritual significance are the\r\ndifferentiations between the caste groups among the Hindus. Numerous\r\nsocial reform societies are working at the present time to remove the\r\nbarriers of caste within Hindu society; and until the work of building\r\nup a human fellowship among the different caste and religious groups\r\nof India, based upon the highest moral teachings of the Hindu sages,\r\nis completed, the political as well as spiritual regeneration of the\r\ncountry will remain an idle dream.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the cultural sense, on account of the sameness\r\nof feelings and instincts, the Hindus, Mohammedans, Sikhs, Parsis,\r\nBengalis, Mahratas, and Madrasis are fundamentally alike. Yet the\r\nbitterness between these warring elements of the country had grown\r\ninto such immense proportions at one time that a communal feeling of\r\nneighborhood and human decency among them seemed inconceivable. Two\r\nhundred years ago, when the English first began to acquire control\r\nover the country, the people of India were divided into perfectly\r\nhostile groups; and no power then existed which could bring together\r\nthese warring factions. Among the causes that have secretly conspired\r\nto develop a spirit of unity among the different religious and social\r\ngroups of India, the foremost has been British imperialism in the\r\ncountry. Britain gave to India, in the first place, a long reign of\r\npeace. This enabled the people of different parts of the country to\r\nhave a more direct and steady intercourse than was possible in earlier\r\ntimes. The English also gave to the higher classes of India a knowledge\r\nof English history and classical literature, whose study breathed\r\ninto the minds of the educated Indians a love of liberty. Acquaintance\r\nwith the spirit of European nationalism created a desire for Indian\r\nnationality. A national consciousness soon sprang into existence and\r\nfound expression through the medium of the Indian National Congress.\r\n\r\nGreater than everything else, however, in its direct consequences of\r\nuniting the people of India into one nation has been the universal\r\nantagonism toward British rule. As the tyranny of foreign rule\r\ngradually began to be felt, hatred against it increased. The different\r\nfactions in the country were forced to unite for the purpose of\r\ndriving out of the country the arrogant intruders. Whatever else may\r\nbe doubtful, one thing is certain about India: “The sentiment of\r\nantagonism toward British rule and of resentment against its iniquitous\r\ncharacter is both universal and profound.”\r\n\r\nThe principal grievances against English rule are its alien character\r\nand its exploitation of the country’s wealth. Mahatma Gandhi calls it\r\n“Satanic,” because it is founded not upon the consent of the governed\r\nbut upon the military strength of the ruler. “It is based not on right\r\nbut on might. Its last appeal is not to reason or to the heart but to\r\nthe sword.” Gandhi writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “I came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection\r\n     had made India more helpless than she ever was before, politically\r\n     and economically.... The government established by law in British\r\n     India is carried on for this exploitation of the masses. No\r\n     sophistry, no jugglery in figures can explain away the evidence\r\n     the skeletons in many villages present to the naked eye. I have\r\n     no doubt whatsoever that both England and the town-dwellers of\r\n     India will have to answer, if there is a God above, for this crime\r\n     against humanity which is perhaps unequalled in history.”--Gandhi,\r\n     _Speeches_, pp. 753-4.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe said just now that one of the main grievances against English rule\r\nin India is its alien character. It may be asked: “Why should the\r\nalien origin of a rule itself be such a strong argument against it?”\r\n“Is it not true that England has given to India peace and efficiency\r\nin government? That constitutes the chief function of governments\r\neverywhere, and the rule which has successfully achieved this purpose\r\njustifies its existence. If it is true elsewhere, it should be true in\r\nIndia also.” Our questioner may be both profoundly right and profoundly\r\nwrong. However, the acceptance or rejection of a foreign lordship by\r\nthe heart is a matter of such subtle sentiment, that the only way to\r\nexplain its meaning to the reader is to create a situation where he\r\nshall be called upon to judge in the matter.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that by some trick of fortune Japan obtained mastery\r\nover America. Let us grant, at the same time, that the Japanese rule\r\nover America was more efficient than the American rule, and in the\r\nlight of our modern knowledge it is not beyond the limit of probability\r\nto imagine that Japanese efficiency in government could be greater than\r\nAmerican efficiency. How would our reader feel about the situation?\r\nWould he be willing to discard his own indigenous native government\r\nfor the sake of a more efficient rule under the Japanese Mikado?\r\nWhat would be his reaction if he saw his own “stars and stripes”\r\nreplaced by the Imperial flag of Japan? Certainly, he would not feel\r\nat ease about the matter. The condition of the native of India under\r\nBritish authority is exactly similar in cause and consequence. In\r\nits fundamental aspect the rule of a country by an alien power is\r\nessentially wrong in principle. It is unnatural and hence utterly\r\nimmoral. Whether it is the Japanese in Korea, the United States of\r\nAmerica in the Philippine Islands, or the English in India--it is\r\nall unnatural and immoral. There can never be any ethical, moral, or\r\nspiritual justification of an other than native rule in a country.\r\n“The government of a people by itself,” says John Stuart Mill, “has a\r\nmeaning and reality; but such a thing as government of one people by\r\nanother does not, and cannot exist.”\r\n\r\nSo far there have existed only two principles for the government of\r\nany country in the world, one is the government of a country by its\r\nchosen representatives, who are held responsible to their constituents,\r\nand are necessarily required to rule the country in the interests of\r\nthe governed. This system was described by an American emancipator as\r\n“government of the people, by the people, for the people.” When we\r\nlook back over the histories of the different countries of the world,\r\nwe find that, without a single exception, the countries which have\r\nadvanced in their material and cultural possessions, during the past\r\ntwo hundred years, have been those whose governments were based on the\r\nprinciple of “government of the people, by the people, for the people.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the modern world we find that the governments of the United States\r\nof America, England, France, and Germany are typical for their\r\nrepresentative characters. It goes without saying that the progress\r\nwhich these nations have made during recent times would not have been\r\npossible under any other system of government. Take the case of any\r\nof these countries, America for example; you will find that “America\r\nhas been made great by the democratic character of its governmental\r\ninstitutions. Its colossal achievements in the mechanical arts, the\r\nhigh advancement in its cultural and artistic life, the mammoth\r\nnature of its commercial and industrial progress, the magnitude of\r\nits educational equipment, its institutions of learning and research,\r\nand its high standard of living--all these owe their origin to the\r\nbeneficent character of the American government,” whose foundation\r\nwas laid upon the noble principles contained in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “ ... That all men are created equal; That they are endowed by\r\n     their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these\r\n     are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure\r\n     these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their\r\n     just powers from the consent of the governed; ...”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still another principle (or lack of principle) on which the\r\ngovernment of a country could be based. This occurs where the country\r\nis governed by an alien power, which derives its authority not from the\r\nconsent of the governed, but from some outside source. As a natural\r\nconsequence of this system the rulers of such countries are not\r\nconcerned with the benefits to be derived by the ruled country. In such\r\ncases the interests of the subject nation are completely subordinated\r\nto those of the master country. “The commerce of the ruling power is\r\nexpanded at the expense of the ruled; the industries of the governing\r\ncountry are enhanced at the cost of the extinction of those of the\r\ngoverned.” “The material, cultural, and moral life of one people is\r\nenriched at the expense of the life sources of a more helpless and\r\nunfortunate people.” The process begins with the impoverishing of the\r\nsubject nation through a system of economic exploitation of its wealth\r\nresources by the dominant powers. Poverty in its turn degrades the\r\ncharacter of the people, and the nation becomes morally flabby. The\r\ndegeneration of an impoverished and suppressed people is assisted by\r\nthe deteriorating influence of the other policies of the foreign ruler,\r\nsuch as the disarming of the subject people, the introduction in their\r\nmidst of an alien system of education so designed as to form in its\r\nhigher classes a group of miseducated “snobs” and to create in the\r\nupper sections of the country contempt for its past history and culture.\r\n\r\nThis kind of government has existed in India for the past two hundred\r\nyears. To begin with, England carried away all the tangible wealth\r\nof the country “in the form of indemnities, grants, and gifts from\r\nits princes, and assessments and taxes from the people.” At the\r\nsame time the industries of the country were destroyed, and its\r\ncommercial prosperity was checked by a selfish policy of enriching the\r\nmanufacturing classes of England at the expense of those in India.\r\nThe entire population of the country was disarmed as the next step.\r\nThus were the natures of the people degraded, their martial spirit was\r\ncrushed, and “a race of soldiers and heroes converted into a timid\r\nflock of quill-driving sheep.”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of an utterly alien system of education was still\r\nanother step in rooting out of the country the remnants of national\r\nhonor and pride. According to the scheme of English education in the\r\ncountry, formulated by Lord Macaulay, English was made the medium of\r\ninstruction for all branches of study. English history and English\r\nliterature received preference over Indian history and Indian\r\nliterature. The text-books for schools and colleges were prepared by\r\nEnglish agents of the government; and from them sentiments of love and\r\nadmiration for Indian civilization and culture on one hand, and respect\r\nfor the character and behavior of its princes on the other, were\r\nrigidly excluded. In its place the English kings, the English people,\r\nthe English religion, the English government, the English institutions,\r\nin fact everything English was held up as ideal. According to the\r\nhistory texts, whenever a battle was fought between the English and\r\nthe native princes, the former were always in the right and the latter\r\nforever in the wrong. The English were always the victorious, and the\r\nnatives always the beaten party. Mir Jafar, the arch-traitor of the\r\ncountry, was a noble and worthy prince, while Mir Kasam, the benevolent\r\nprotector of his subjects against the injustice of the East India\r\nCompany’s agents, was a hypocrite and a debauché. The reason for the\r\nexaltation of Mir Jafar and the execration of Mir Kasam is, however,\r\neasily understood. Mir Jafar was the commander-in-chief of the army\r\nof Siraj-ud-Daulah, who stood against the forces of Lord Clive on the\r\nbattlefield of Plassey. At a suggestion of bribery from Clive, Mir\r\nJafar led the whole of his army over to the side of the enemy, and thus\r\nsecured for the English the victory of Plassey, which was the beginning\r\nof their real power in the country. On the other hand, Mir Kasam was\r\ncontinually fighting against the encroachments of the East India\r\nCompany over his own territories and the rights of his subjects. Which\r\nof the two princes was a real man and a worthy hero among his people,\r\nMir Jafar or Mir Kasam? Mir Kasam, according to every kind of moral and\r\nethical standard of nobility and courage; Mir Jafar, according to the\r\ncorrupt standards of British Imperialism in India.\r\n\r\nAfter the Indian youths had finished their scanty education, the future\r\nthat lay before them was of a very uninviting nature. As all the high\r\noffices in the service of the country were monopolized by the English,\r\nthe only positions left for the educated classes of Indians were\r\nthose of low-paid clerks and assistants in the government offices. No\r\nprospect of fame, or wealth, or power opened before them. There was no\r\ngreat stimulus for the pursuit of higher knowledge. The young scholars\r\nno sooner began to know their positions in the world than they realized\r\nthe uselessness of great attainments. Of what use was their learning if\r\nthey were not to have employment as responsible public administrators\r\nof their country and so use their knowledge in the service of India?\r\nThe extent of the exclusion of the native inhabitants of the country\r\nfrom offices of dignity and high emoluments in the government service\r\nmay be realized from the following figures. According to the figures of\r\n1913, out of 2,501 civil and military offices in British India carrying\r\nmonthly salaries of 800 rupees ($266.00) or more, only 242, less than\r\nten per cent were held by Indians; out of the 4,986 appointments\r\ncarrying a monthly salary of 500 rupees ($166.00), only 19 per cent\r\nwere held by Indians; and out of the 11,064 appointments carrying a\r\nmonthly salary of 200 rupees ($66.00) only 42 per cent were held by\r\nIndians. Conditions have not changed much since 1913.[46]\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the American reader to realize fully the magnitude\r\nof injustice involved in the wrong policies of the English government\r\nin India regarding the country’s systems of education and public\r\nemployment, we shall use our previous illustration once more. Let it be\r\nsupposed that simultaneously with the consolidation of Japanese power\r\nin America it was ordered by the Mikado that henceforth the Japanese\r\nlanguage should form the sole medium of instruction in the schools and\r\ncolleges throughout the United States. The American children would be\r\nrequired to learn the Japanese language before reaching school. The\r\ntexts given to the youths of the country to study and digest would be\r\nbooks written and published in Japan, from which the names of such\r\nnational heroes as Washington and Lincoln were excluded, but in which\r\nthe praises of Japan were sung in high chorus. Shakespeare, Milton,\r\nEmerson, Longfellow, and Hawthorne would be excluded from the American\r\nschool curriculum, and Japanese literature substituted in its place.\r\nThe business of all governmental departments would be conducted in\r\nJapanese, and its official circulars and reports would be printed in\r\nJapanese. All the higher posts in the service of the country would\r\nbe reserved for the Mikado’s own countrymen. The president and his\r\ncabinet; supreme, district, and superior court judges; the governors of\r\nthe states,--all would be appointed in Tokyo from among the Japanese\r\nin favor with the government of the Mikado. Native-born Americans\r\nwould be employed only as stenographers, postmen, grammar school\r\nteachers, and street car conductors, and then only at starvation wages.\r\nBuddhism would be made the state religion of America. What would any\r\nself-respecting American say if all this were done to his country?\r\nWhat would he do when his children and his grandchildren raised a cry\r\nagainst the injustice done to their country and its manhood, and this\r\ncry was drowned by the declaration of the Japanese imperialists that\r\nJapan was carrying the Yellow Man’s burden in the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of a deep and passionate resentment felt by the people\r\nof India regarding these matters was expressed by the late Mr. G. K.\r\nGokhale thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “A kind of dwarfing or stunting of the Indian race is going\r\n     on under the present system. We must live all our lives in an\r\n     atmosphere of inferiority, and the tallest of us must bend, in\r\n     order that the exigencies of the system may be satisfied. The\r\n     upward impulse, if I may use such an expression, which every\r\n     schoolboy at Eton or Harrow may feel, that he may one day be a\r\n     Gladstone, a Nelson, or a Wellington, and which may draw forth\r\n     the best efforts of which he is capable, that is denied to us.\r\n     The height to which our manhood is capable of rising can never\r\n     be reached by us under the present system. The moral elevation\r\n     which every Self-Governing people feel, cannot be felt by us.\r\n     Our administrative and military talents must gradually disappear\r\n     owing to sheer disuse, till at last our lot, as hewers of wood and\r\n     drawers of water in our own country, is stereotyped.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the world sees the spectacle of an indignant India in\r\nrevolt against the English rule, it should not be surprised. It is only\r\nnatural that the English should resent the attempts of the Indians\r\nto secure their independence. It is hoped, however, that the other\r\nnations of the world will not feel hostile against the battle cry of\r\nthe Indians against the British oppression in their country. If the\r\nEnglish imperialists try to prove the virtue of their rule in India,\r\nplease remember that the question is not whether the English rule is\r\ngood or bad, but whether the principle underlying it is right or wrong.\r\nNo self-respecting American citizen desires to see Japanese lordship\r\nestablished in his native land; he would call a condition intolerable\r\nin which the Japanese held all the positions of power in the government\r\nof his country. The full-blooded inhabitants of India feel in much\r\nthe same way about the British supremacy in India. The reason of this\r\nattitude of both American and Indian nationalists is the same. The\r\nself-respect of an honest man revolts against foreign domination. The\r\neyes of Modern India have been opened, and her people realize “that\r\nthey are men, with a man’s right to manage his own affairs.” As was\r\nexpressed by Mrs. Annie Besant in her presidential address before the\r\nIndian National Congress in 1917: “India is no longer on her knees for\r\n‘boons’; she is on her feet for Rights.”\r\n\r\nThe first voice of organized Indian nationalist opinion demanding\r\nreform in the British government of India, was heard in 1885. In\r\nthat year the first session of the Indian National Congress was held\r\nin Bombay. The Congress began as a gathering of a small group of\r\nprogressive nationalist leaders from different parts of the country.\r\nGradually, as its function became known, the ranks of the congress\r\nwere swelled by delegates from all sections of India, and soon its\r\nresponsible character as the representative organ of Indian progressive\r\nopinion on political matters was recognized in both England and India.\r\n\r\nThe Congress began its career as a critic of British policies in\r\nthe country. It submitted a request to the English nation for an\r\ninquiry into Indian affairs and presented claims for reforms in the\r\nirresponsible and autocratic character of the British Government in the\r\ncountry. As time passed and the real nature of English rule began to be\r\ndisclosed, the Indian nationalists became “bolder in their criticisms\r\nand more ambitious in their claims for reform.” Except for minor\r\nconcessions granted through the courtesy of a few sympathetic viceroys\r\nnothing positive in the direction of the better government of India was\r\naccomplished by the Indian National Congress until the Morley-Minto\r\nreforms of 1909. Yet in spite of its enormous difficulties, arising\r\nfrom the stubbornness of British bureaucracy in India and the cold,\r\nunconcerned attitude of the English Parliament towards Indian claims,\r\nthe Congress had done excellent work in arousing the educated classes\r\nof the country to a realization of their political wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe Indian nationalist movement received a great impetus during the\r\nharsh reign of Lord Curzon as the high-handed Viceroy of India. One of\r\nthe acts of Lord Curzon was the partition of Bengal in 1905,--“an act\r\nwhich aroused in the entire population of Bengal a violent outburst of\r\npopular disapproval.” The purpose of the English Viceroy in dividing\r\nthe province into two portions was to destroy the unity of Bengal, and\r\nto sow at the same time seeds of bitter Hindu-Muslim feuds. But the\r\nBengalee youths were determined not to accept the dismemberment of\r\ntheir ancient land of Bengal, and the entire province was in a state\r\nof anarchy for a period of six years. In spite of the attempts of the\r\nEnglish to quiet the agitation, it gradually spread all over India\r\nuntil at last the hated act was repealed by royal proclamation at the\r\nDelhi coronation Durbar in 1911.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Morley-Minto reforms, sponsored by John Morley,\r\nthe noted biographer of Gladstone and at that time Secretary of State\r\nfor India, and Lord Minto, the Viceroy of India, had become law by\r\nthe India Council Act of 1909. The reforms were accepted by a few\r\nmoderate leaders as “generous,” but on the whole public opinion in\r\nIndia regarded them as inadequate and petty. For the first time seats\r\nin the executive councils of the provinces as well as those in the\r\nIndian government were thrown open to Indians. The provincial and\r\ncentral legislative councils were enlarged and made to include more\r\n“elected” Indian members. Henceforth the provincial councils were to\r\ncontain a majority of “non-official” “elected” members as distinguished\r\nfrom the “official” and “non-official nominated” members, the official\r\nbeing the officers of the Government who sat in the councils as\r\nex-officio members and the non-official nominated who were nominated\r\nto their positions as council members by the governor of the province\r\nfor provincial councils and by the Viceroy in the case of the central\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the reformed councils, however, were limited. “The\r\ncouncils,” says Prof. Parker T. Moon, “could pass resolutions subject\r\nto the British Parliament’s overriding authority; they could discuss\r\nthe budget and other measures; they could criticise and suggest. They\r\ncould not oppose and propose, but neither depose nor dispose. They\r\ncould not overthrow the administration, or tighten the purse strings.\r\nThey were, in short, experimental debating clubs.”[47]\r\n\r\nThose who had put their confidence in the Morley-Minto reforms were\r\nsoon disappointed. The real nature of the new councils as mere\r\n“debating clubs” was discovered and found unsatisfactory. The people of\r\nIndia had demanded the right to control the affairs of their country’s\r\ngovernment, and they had been granted merely the right to discuss and\r\nto criticize, with no authority whatsoever to alter the policies of\r\nits officials. The helplessness of the Indian members in the Councils\r\nwas proved after the World War during the agitation over the Rowlatt\r\nBills. The uproar against this piece of repressive legislation was so\r\nstrong that all Indian members of the Central Legislative Council,\r\nincluding those who were nominated by the government, voted against\r\nits passage. But in spite of the solid opposition from Indian members\r\nin the Council and an unprecedented revulsion against the Bills among\r\nall classes in the country, they were made law by the Viceroy. That\r\nlegislation was a “direct slap in the face of nationalist India.” It is\r\na matter of common knowledge that it led to the _satyagraha_ of Mahatma\r\nGandhi, which in turn crystallized into the non-violent non-coöperation\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nAfter the reforms of 1909, the Indian National Congress continued to\r\narouse the masses of the country to a national consciousness and to a\r\ndemand for representation in the government of the country. In 1914\r\nall groups of Indians joined in a spirit of loyalty to assist the\r\nBritish Empire during the World War. India made heavy contributions to\r\nthe war-time needs of England in both man-power and money power; as a\r\nrecompense for her loyalty the people of India were promised liberal\r\nhome rule after the war. In the meantime the Indian National Congress\r\nand the All-India Moslem League (founded in 1912 by the Mohammedans of\r\nIndia) had agreed to present the joint claims of all communities in the\r\ncountry for home rule. The scheme formulated by these two organizations\r\nat Lucknow in 1916, and known as the Congress-League Scheme, had for\r\nits aim the attainment of _Swaraj_ (home rule) within the British\r\nEmpire. They proposed a plan by which India within a period of fifteen\r\nyears should acquire the same rights as the self-governing colonies of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the war, the Secretary of State for India, Mr.\r\nMontague, was sent to India by the British Parliament for the study\r\nof the conditions of the country with a view to launching a scheme\r\nof wider influence for its people. A joint report prepared by the\r\nSecretary, Mr. Montague, and the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, was\r\npublished in 1918, and after slight modifications was passed by the\r\nBritish Parliament as the Act of 1919.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Montague-Chelmsford reforms were an improvement over\r\nthe reforms of 1909, all sections of the Indian people except a\r\nfew isolated moderates at once declared them to be unsatisfactory.\r\nBesides enlarging the existing councils and providing for more elected\r\nmembers in them, the reforms of 1919 introduced the new principle of\r\n“dyarchy” into the provinces. The various departments of the provincial\r\ngovernment were known as “reserved” or “transferred.” The control of\r\nthe “reserved” departments remained in the hands of the governors,\r\nwho were not responsible in any way to the legislatures. These\r\nincluded law, order, justice, and police. The class of “transferred”\r\nsubjects included among others education, agriculture, and public\r\nhealth. Their control was placed in the hands of ministers elected\r\nby and responsible to the provincial legislatures, which contained a\r\nmajority of elected members. The system of “dyarchy” in the provincial\r\ngovernments, however, was not a success. No sooner had the new scheme\r\nbegun to function than difficulties over the budget arose between\r\nthe ministers in charge of different departments. The ministers of\r\ntransferred subjects were given the privilege of managing their\r\ndepartments according to popular demand, but they were not provided\r\nwith the funds necessary to make possible the proposed reforms. “The\r\nstrings of the purse were still held by an outside power,” a condition\r\nwhich made work of these responsible ministers wholly ineffective. “In\r\ndefiance of Lincoln’s principles regarding the fate of a house divided\r\nagainst itself,” comments Prof. Moon, “the British Government made\r\nit a principle to divide the administration of India. India was to\r\nbe ‘half free, half slave.’ Autocracy and self-government were to be\r\ntwin columns supporting British imperialism. It is interesting to note\r\nthe subjects which were reserved as of interest to Great Britain--the\r\nrepression of disorder was a prime interest. Ingenious as it was, the\r\nscheme was by no means an unqualified success.”[48]\r\n\r\nYet it must be admitted that the reforms of 1919 were never given\r\na fair trial by the people of India. Before the time came for the\r\ninstallation of the new councils, the Indian nation had already\r\nlaunched upon its career of non-violent non-coöperation against the\r\nBritish Government. How the agitation against the Rowlatt Bills led\r\nto martial law in the Punjab and to the massacre at Amritsar, which\r\nin turn drove Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress to the\r\npolicy of boycott against English rule, has already been explained in\r\na previous chapter. One of the items in the non-coöperation program\r\nof the Congress was the boycott of councils, and as a consequence\r\nof this item all the responsible nationalist leaders withheld their\r\nnames and support from the council elections. When after the arrest\r\nof Mahatma Gandhi in 1922, one wing of the Indian nationalists under\r\nthe leadership of Mr. C. R. Das, decided to go into the councils,\r\nthey did so with the purpose of breaking them up. The avowed object\r\nof followers of Mr. Das, who were henceforth called the “Swarajists,”\r\nwas to capture the councils with a view to breaking the machinery\r\nof the government from within by obstructing its business at every\r\nstep. Even though the “Swarajists” finally did succeed in holding the\r\nmajority seats in different legislative councils of the country, and\r\nin causing considerable annoyance to the government officials by their\r\nobstructionist methods, yet they were far from being able at any time\r\nto halt the government machinery.\r\n\r\nThe point at issue between India and England is this: India has\r\noutgrown its old habit of submission. It does not bend its knee to beg\r\nfor reforms and concessions. It is standing on its feet and demanding\r\nits rights, and the methods it is using to secure the rights of the\r\npeople to govern themselves are of its own creation. The surprising\r\nthing in this whole affair is not that India has lost faith in the\r\nBritish sense of justice and has decided to boycott its English rulers;\r\nthe amazing thing is that it took the people of India so long to find\r\nout the truth about England’s interests in the country and their own\r\nwelfare. It is a sad commentary upon the genius of Indian leadership\r\nthat it took the Indian National Congress thirty-five years to\r\ndiscover the path of non-coöperation towards _Swaraj_ (home rule). To\r\nexpect from the English nation, which rewarded General Dyer for his\r\nmassacre of 800 unarmed civilians with a purse of £10,000 ($50,000),\r\na grant of self-government was stark nonsense. And yet until the new\r\npath was struck out by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, Indians of all shades\r\nof opinion persevered in their belief that freedom could be acquired\r\nby begging. Mahatma Gandhi was the first man among Indians to realize\r\nthe fact that freedom is never got by gifts of the rulers, but on the\r\ncontrary is won by the might of the ruled. Freedom is a thing which\r\ncannot be given to a nation from outside; the ability to acquire it\r\nmust be developed from within.\r\n\r\nIt is really amazing how old habits stick with beings long after\r\ntheir uselessness has been established. A case of this occurred in\r\nIndia after the incarceration of Mahatma Gandhi in 1922. The Mahatma\r\nhad started the country on the lines of non-coöperation, and they\r\nwere proceeding quite successfully, when he was suddenly arrested and\r\nsentenced to six years’ imprisonment. Soon after he had disappeared\r\nfrom the scene of the Congress, there sprang up in its midst a new\r\nparty which at once resolved to go back into the councils, as if they\r\nhad not had enough experience with the council business in previous\r\ntimes. What prompted the “Swarajists” to this action has always\r\nremained unintelligible to me. Did they really believe that they\r\ncould conquer the English bureaucracy of India through speeches in\r\nthe council chambers, or frighten them into submission through their\r\nobstructionist terrors? If they did, it was a typical case of the\r\ntriumph of hope over experience. If ever anyone made the English rulers\r\nof the country quake in their shoes it was Gandhi. He did not do this\r\nby the politician’s tricks. He who fights against the English nation\r\nwith those weapons works against heavy odds, because the English are\r\nalready past masters in the art of diplomacy. The bureaucrats were\r\nterrified by Gandhi because he used the weapon of passive resistance,\r\nwhich was native to himself and his countrymen but foreign to the\r\nBritish militarists. The rulers of the country were completely baffled\r\nby Gandhi’s methods. They simply did not know what to do. If it had\r\nbeen an armed insurrection of a rebellious nation, they possessed\r\nenough military force to suppress it with success; but their best\r\nstrategists failed when they had to encounter a mass of three hundred\r\nmillion disobeying and yet non-resisting people, who had risen in\r\nsudden revolt against their established authority at the bidding of a\r\nsaintly leader.\r\n\r\nGandhi’s non-violent non-coöperation still forms the creed of the\r\nIndian National Congress. The masses all over the country have been\r\nmade conscious of the loss of their national dignity under the rule of\r\nthe British; the blood of the martyrs at Jallianwalla Bagh has made the\r\nheart of India bleed; and it is hoped that before the present agitation\r\nin the country is slackened, India will have achieved its national\r\nfreedom, and have become able once more to offer its contribution of\r\nart, beauty, and culture to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nOther outside influences besides the injustices of the British rule in\r\nthe country, that have conspired together to strengthen the nationalist\r\nmovement of India during the twentieth century, were the Japanese\r\nvictory in the Russo-Japanese war, and the lowering of the white man’s\r\nprestige in the minds of all Eastern nations during and after the World\r\nWar. The crushing defeat of the Russian forces at the hands of the\r\nEastern islanders during the Russo-Japanese war broke forever the spell\r\nof the invincibility of white man’s arms against Eastern foes; and this\r\nincident gave a great impetus to the nationalistic movements in all\r\ncountries of the East.\r\n\r\nAgain when during the World War native regiments from the different\r\ncolonial possessions of the fighting powers were gathered in the\r\nbattlefields of Europe to witness the “white man’s holocaust,” their\r\nrespect for his supposed superior civilization disappeared. At the same\r\ntime the World War weakened the potential powers of the imperialistic\r\nwhite nations, thereby increasing considerably the chances of success\r\nfor the rebellious peoples in the East. The high-sounding sentiments\r\nof “Self-determination” for weaker nations, and “a world made safe for\r\ndemocracy” uttered by the allied statesmen, during the period of war,\r\nhad, ever since the ending of the World War on Armistice Day, quickened\r\nthe hopes not only of India but of other dependent nations as well to\r\nseek in every direction for the realization of the ideals expressed by\r\nthese eloquent orators of the allies. What will the end be?\r\n\r\n                      *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince this was written some developments of a momentous character\r\nhave taken place in the political situation of India, of which an\r\nappropriate notice may conveniently be taken here.\r\n\r\nAt the 1928 session of the Indian National Congress held at Calcutta\r\na scheme of self-government, jointly prepared by all parties in\r\nIndia, was presented to the British Parliament for enaction into\r\nlaw. This scheme, known as the Nehru Report, was accompanied by an\r\nultimatum to the effect, that if Dominion Status equivalent to that\r\nof other self-governing dominions of the Empire like Canada and South\r\nAfrica was not granted to India by the British Parliament before the\r\nmidnight of December 31st, 1929, the Indian National Congress would\r\nhenceforth declare complete independence as its immediate goal. Since\r\nno satisfactory response was made to this ultimatum by the British\r\nParliament within the prescribed time limit, the Indian National\r\nCongress at its annual session held at Lahore during the last week of\r\n1929 committed itself to complete independence and a severance of all\r\nrelations with the British Government. The Independence resolution of\r\nMahatma Gandhi was carried by an overwhelming majority of 2,994 votes\r\nagainst only 6. January 26th, 1930, was chosen by the Indian National\r\nCongress as the day of Indian Independence. It was observed by all\r\nIndians, in India and abroad, amidst spectacular demonstrations, during\r\nwhich the national flag was hoisted with ceremony, and the Declaration\r\nof Independence read to the masses. Resolutions of approval were passed\r\nat nearly 750,000 meetings, and pledges of support given to the Indian\r\nNational Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, by the\r\nenthusiastic crowds, everywhere. At a later date the All-India Congress\r\nCommittee consisting of 300 members transferred its authority to guide\r\nthe policies of the Congress to a working committee of ten chosen\r\nleaders of the people, who in turn have expressed their implicit faith\r\nin the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.\r\n\r\nAfter all efforts at reconciliation with the British Government had\r\nfailed, Mahatma Gandhi embarked on his campaign of Civil Disobedience\r\non March 9th, 1930. On that day he left his home at Ahmedabad with\r\na batch of 79 volunteers to reach Jalalpur, a village on the ocean\r\nshore and 150 miles distant, where he and his followers will start\r\nmanufacturing salt in open defiance of the British Government’s\r\nmonopoly of salt manufacture in India. This will be symbolic of\r\nGandhi’s program of Civil Disobedience. On this historic journey Gandhi\r\nand his followers have been greeted with tremendous enthusiasm by the\r\ngeneral populace, who have gathered in numbers of hundreds of thousands\r\nand lined Gandhi’s march all along his journey.\r\n\r\nThe plan of Gandhi is very simple. He, with his batch of volunteers,\r\nwill start manufacturing salt at Jalalpur. Since this involves the\r\ndisobedience of the civil authority of the British Government, it will\r\nbe compelled to arrest Gandhi and his followers. The volunteers in case\r\nof their arrest will be replaced by other batches of equal numbers. In\r\nthis way the campaign will continue until one of the parties withdraws.\r\nThe Government will either succeed in breaking up the power of Gandhi’s\r\nfollowers or yield to the demands of nationalistic India. On the one\r\nhand Gandhi has openly defied the British Government to arrest him, and\r\non the other hand he has strictly enjoined his followers to maintain a\r\nspirit of non-violence. In a recent statement to the press he declared\r\nthat he was not afraid so much of the wrath of the British Government\r\nas of the mad fury of his own countrymen bursting forth into open\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nGandhi’s march to Jalalpur has aroused universal enthusiasm all\r\nover the country. Huge demonstrations are taking place everywhere.\r\nIndication of the British Government’s policy of repression has\r\nshown itself already in the arrest of Gandhi’s chief lieutenant, Mr.\r\nVallabhai Patel, and the mayor of Calcutta, Mr. Sen Gupta. The masses\r\nhave so far maintained the spirit of non-violence. Gandhi has given\r\nto the British Government of India the choice between a peaceful\r\nsettlement and violence. He has been able so far to hold his countrymen\r\nin a calm mood of peaceful agitation. If he is arrested and the\r\nGovernment starts repression with its customary display of violence,\r\nthe revolution in India may take a different course. In such a case the\r\nresponsibility will be all England’s.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] Quoted from Lajpat Rai.\r\n\r\n[47] _Imperialism and World Politics_, page 300.\r\n\r\n[48] _Imperialism and World Politics_, page 303.",
