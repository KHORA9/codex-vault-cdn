TO THE X. CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOMBARD CONQUEST AND ITS RESULTS.\r\n\r\nBefore tracing the beginnings of renewed municipal life in Northern\r\nItaly, we must consider the conditions of land and people, which first\r\nrendered possible and then fostered the spirit of local independence\r\nof which such beginnings were the natural expression. To do this we\r\nmust commence our researches with the first domination of the Lombards\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nIn detail the story of the conquest of Northern Italy by the Lombards\r\nunder Alboin, in 568, hardly differs materially from that of the\r\ninroads of other barbarian tribes of the north on the fertile plains\r\nof Italy. The causes were the same. Where the distinction is to be\r\nfound from other such invasions, is in the results of the Lombard\r\noccupation, and in the different methods which the Lombards adopted so\r\nas to render their power and their possessions permanent. Let us look\r\nat the character of this invading host, which sweeps like a tide, at\r\nonce destroying and revivifying, over the exhausted though still\r\nfertile plains of the Po and the Adige. Are we to call it a moving\r\npeople or an advancing army? Are we to call its leaders (_duces_, from\r\n_ducere_ to lead), heads of clans and families, or captains and\r\ngenerals? Finally, is the land to be invaded, or is the land to be\r\nsettled? To all these questions the only answer is to be found in the\r\nconception of the absolute union of both the kinds of functions\r\ndescribed. A people is moving from a home whose borders have proved\r\ntoo narrow for its increasing numbers; an army is conquering a new\r\nhome, where plenty will take the place of want, and luxury of\r\nprivation. It is not an army marching at the command of a strongly\r\ncentralized power to conquer a rich neighbor, and force a defeated\r\nenemy to pay it service or tribute. It is a body which, when it has\r\nconquered as an army, will occupy as a people; when it is established\r\nas a people, will still remain an army. The sword was not turned into\r\nthe ploughshare; but the power to wield the sword had given the right\r\nto till the land, and soon the power to hold the land was to give the\r\nright to wear the sword. It was the conquest of a highly civilized\r\nagricultural people--whose very civilization had reduced them to a\r\nstage of moral weakness which rendered them totally unfit to defend\r\nthemselves--by a semi-barbarous people, agricultural also, but rude,\r\nuncivilized, independent, owning no rulers but their family or\r\nmilitary chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors took possession of the country simply as they would\r\ntake possession of a larger farm than they had before owned. Their\r\nriches were only such as served for the support of men--herds, land,\r\nwine and corn. They needed cultivators for their large farm, so\r\ninstead of destroying every one with fire and sword, they spared those\r\nof the weak inhabitants of the land who had survived the first\r\nonslaught, in order that they might make use of farmers to cultivate\r\ntheir new possessions. In most cases they did not make slaves of them,\r\nbut tributaries; and after the land had been portioned evenly among\r\nthe soldiers of the invading host, the original holders of the land\r\ntilled it themselves, under a system somewhat kindred to the metayer\r\nsystem as to-day existent in Tuscany and elsewhere, paying, according\r\nto the usual custom adopted by the northern conquerors of Italy,\r\none-third of the produce[1] to their new masters. The whole\r\norganization of society was on a purely military basis; the soldiers\r\nof the conquering army, although they became landed proprietors, none\r\nthe less retained their character and name of soldiers. Hence when\r\nthese crude forms of social life began to crystallize into the\r\ncarefully marked ranks of the feudal system, the \"_milites_\"[2] formed\r\nthe order of gentlemen, the smaller feudatories, who gave land in fief\r\nto their vassals--generally the old inhabitants--while holding their\r\nown nominally from the \"_duces_,\" or dukes, the representatives of\r\ntheir former leaders in war, who held their tenure direct from the\r\nking or chief.\r\n\r\nAs the object of this paper is particularly to trace the origin and\r\nearly sources of municipal life in Northern Italy, let us turn and see\r\nwhat were the effects on the already existing towns, of the inroads of\r\nthese hordes of northern barbarians. At the outset I must state\r\nemphatically that all our sources of information as to the\r\ninstitutional history of this obscure period are exceedingly vague,\r\nmeagre and unsatisfactory. The progress of events we can follow with\r\nmore or less accuracy from the mazy writings of the early chroniclers;\r\nwe can get a fair idea of the judicial and the legislative acts of the\r\nruling powers by studying and comparing the different codes of laws\r\nthat have come down to us; but in a study of the internal municipal\r\nlife of these early ages, the student meets again and again with\r\nincreasing discouragement, and soon finds himself almost hopelessly\r\nlost in a tangle of doubts and inferences.\r\n\r\nIn the almost total want of direct evidence, from casual mention\r\ngleaned from the writings of the chroniclers, and from occasional\r\nreferences in the law codes to municipal offices and regulations,\r\nenough indirect evidence must be sought, to enable us, by the aid of\r\nour powers of reasoning, if not of our imagination, to build up some\r\nhistory, defective though it be, of municipal life, down to the time\r\nwhen the internal growth and importance of the cities rendered them\r\nsufficiently prominent political factors to have their deeds and their\r\nprogress chronicled. Besides, if we consider the modes by which the\r\ncommunes slowly rose to independence, it will easily be seen that to\r\nhave every step of this slow and almost secret advance chronicled and\r\ngiven to the world, would have been entirely contrary to the policy of\r\nthe cities. These hoped to gain by the neglect of their rulers, and\r\nwhile clinging pertinaciously to every privilege ever legally granted,\r\nto claim new ones constantly, putting forth as their sole legal title\r\nthat slippery claim of precedent and time-honored custom. In that age,\r\nbooks of reference to prove such claims would have been found alike\r\ninconvenient and unnecessary. All the city folks wished was to be\r\nforgotten and ignored by their superiors, as any notice vouchsafed\r\nthem was sure to come only in the restraint of some assumed privilege\r\nor the curtailing of some coveted right.\r\n\r\nHence the principal cause of the poverty of record through all this\r\nperiod of slow if steady growth; and the disappointed investigator\r\nmust in some measure console himself with such a reason. It may be\r\nasked, what of the various local histories of different towns, whose\r\nauthors seldom fail to give highflown accounts of their native cities,\r\neven in the remotest and darkest ages of their history? To this\r\nquestion there is a double answer: in the first place the uttermost\r\ncaution must be enjoined in using such material; not only in\r\nseparating fact from baseless tradition of a much later period, but in\r\nmaking large allowance for the heavy strain which a strong feeling of\r\nlocal patriotism, or civism, puts upon the conscience of the author.\r\nIn the second place it must be remembered that most of such histories,\r\nor at least of the monkish or other records from which they derive\r\ntheir source and most of their material, were written to the glory or\r\nunder the auspices of some dominant noble family or ecclesiastical\r\ninstitution, to whose laudation in ages past and present the humble\r\nauthor devotes all the resources of his mind, and I am afraid far too\r\noften of his imagination.\r\n\r\nLet us now cast a glance at the exhausted civilization of the towns of\r\nNorthern Italy, where the formal shell of Roman organization still\r\nremained, after the vigor and life which had produced it had long been\r\ndestroyed. To describe the condition of the Roman _municipia_ at the\r\ntime of the Teutonic invasions is but to tell a part of the story of\r\nthe fall of the Roman Empire. The municipal system, which from the\r\nnames and duties of its officers would seem to represent a surprising\r\namount of local independence in matters of administration, even a\r\ncollection of small almost free republics, had lost all its strength\r\nand all its vital power by the grinding exactions of a centralized\r\ndespotism, which was compelled to support its declining power by\r\nstrengthening the very forces which were working its destruction, at\r\nthe expense of destroying those from which it should have gained its\r\nstrength. The stability of every state rests ultimately on the wealth\r\nand character of its citizens, and any government which exhausts the\r\none and degrades the other in an effort to maintain its own unlimited\r\npower has its days numbered. Under the despotic rule of the later\r\nemperors the municipalities had lost all their power, though in theory\r\ntheir rights were unassailed. The _curia_ could elect its magistrates\r\nas of old, and these magistrates could legislate for the _municipium_,\r\nbut by a single word the imperial delegate could annul the choice of\r\nthe one and the acts of the other.\r\n\r\nThe economic condition of the people amounted to little short of\r\nbankruptcy; the possession of wealth, in landed property especially,\r\nhaving become but a burden to be avoided, and a source of exaction\r\nrather than of satisfaction to the owner. The inequalities of burdens\r\nand of rank were great. The citizens were divided into three classes:\r\n(1) the privileged classes, (2) the Curials, (3) the common people.\r\nThe first, freely speaking, were those who had in a manner succeeded\r\nin detaching themselves from the interests of the _municipium_ to\r\nwhich they belonged; such were the members of the Senate, including\r\nall with the indefinite title of _clarissimi_, the soldiers, the\r\nclergy, the public magistrates as distinguished from the municipal\r\nofficers. The second consisted of all citizens of a town, whether\r\nnatives--_municipes_--or settlers--_incolae_--who possessed landed\r\nproperty of more than twenty-five _jugera_, and did not belong to any\r\nprivileged class: both these classes were hereditary. The third, of\r\nall free citizens whose poverty debarred them from belonging to either\r\nof the preceding divisions. On the second of these classes, the\r\nCurials, fell all the grinding burdens of the state, the executing of\r\nmunicipal duties, and the exactions of the central government.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for me to trace here the development of that\r\nfinancial policy which resulted in the ruin, I may say the\r\nannihilation of this order. Suffice it to say that it formed the\r\ncapital fund of the government which exhausted it, and when the source\r\nof supply was destroyed, production ceased, and with it, of course,\r\nall means of governmental support. Where the extinction of this\r\n\"middle class\" touches the point of our inquiry is in affording an\r\nexplanation of a circumstance in the history of the Lombard\r\nsubjugation of the Italian towns, which without consideration of this\r\nfact would appear almost incomprehensible. I refer to the utter\r\npassivity of the inhabitants, not only in the matter of resistance to\r\nattack, which the greater strength and courage of the invaders perhaps\r\nrendered useless, but in what is more surprising, the fact that after\r\nthe easy conquest was completed, we hear nothing of the manner in\r\nwhich the people adapted themselves to the totally new condition of\r\nlife and of government to which they were subjected. Even if we can\r\nunderstand hearing nothing of what the people did, at least we should\r\nexpect to hear what was done with it, what it became. The story of its\r\nresistance might be short and soon forgotten, but the story of its\r\nsufferings, of its complaints, of struggle against the entire change\r\nin the order and character of its life, should be a long one.\r\n\r\nBut of this no record, hardly mention even appears. When the central\r\ngovernment falls and the last of its legions are destroyed or have\r\ndeparted, there seems to be no thought of any other element in\r\nsociety. If the evidence of the law codes did not tell us that a Roman\r\npopulation existed, history would record little to indicate its\r\npresence. Not only is even the slightest trace of nationality effaced,\r\nbut the merging of the old conditions of life into the new seems of\r\ntoo little consequence to merit even an allusion. This state of\r\naffairs, as said above, is caused by the annihilation, by the despotic\r\npower of the central government, of that middle class which in times\r\nof prosperity formed the sinews of the state. Of the other classes,\r\nthe privileged class, with the exception of the clergy, fell of course\r\nwith the government which supported it, and the common people\r\npossessed no individuality, no power, and hardly any rights. Such,\r\nthen, was the condition of the towns at the time of the Lombard\r\ninvasion, a condition of such abasement and such degradation as\r\nliterally to have no history; a condition which indeed can truthfully\r\nbe said to merit none.\r\n\r\nHistory tells the story of every great nation on the face of the earth\r\nin three short words, growth, supremacy, decline. Vary the theme as\r\nyou may in the countless histories of countless peoples; subdivide the\r\ncourse of its progress as you will, allowing for different local\r\ncauses and different local phenomena, the true philosophy of history\r\nteaches that no real departure from this natural development is\r\npossible. But what if by the violent intervention of some new and\r\nentirely foreign force, another development and another life is given\r\nto the inanimate ashes of the old? What if some nation, fresh from the\r\nwoods and fields of the childhood of its growth, come with\r\noverwhelming yet preserving strength and infuse new blood into the\r\nwithered veins of its predecessor? This is the problem we now have\r\nbefore us. How many writers of Italian history have entitled this\r\nchapter in its development \"A new Italian Nation formed\"! It is not\r\nthe old glories of Rome, which had been Italy, returning; it is a new\r\nItalian nation formed. Each word tells a story of its own. It is not\r\nthe old galvanized to a second life; it is the new superimposed,\r\nviolently if you will, upon it. We do not hear of Athens or of Rome,\r\nof an Alexander or of a Caesar, of a city or of a man. It is an\r\n\"Italian nation.\" It is the individualism of the independent spirit of\r\nthe North, which \"forms\" a nation from the exhausted remains of the\r\ndevelopment of centralization of the South. The new idea of distinct\r\nnationality among races of kindred stock was already at work, even\r\nthough it did not reach a formal expression till the Treaty of Verdun,\r\nmore than two hundred and fifty years later.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to imply that we must in any measure ignore the passive\r\nforce and influence of the old forms on the new. The old veins receive\r\nthe new blood; the new torrent, overrunning everything at first with\r\nthe strength of its new life, will find again, even if it deepen, the\r\nchannel of the old river: a vanquished civilization will always subdue\r\nand at the same time raise its barbarous conquerors, if they come of a\r\nstock capable of appreciating civilizing influences. In the present\r\ncase this means that the men of the North brought the new ideas that\r\nwere to form modern history, and let their growth be directed and\r\nassisted, while they were yet too young to stand alone, by some of the\r\nframework which had been built up by the long experience of their\r\nSouthern neighbors.\r\n\r\nTo focus this thought on the immediate subject of our present study,\r\nthis I think is the only and true solution of the tedious question, so\r\nmuch discussed by the two opposing schools of thought: whether the\r\ngovernment of the Italian communes was purely Roman in its forms and\r\nin its conception, or purely Teutonic. The supporters of neither\r\ntheory can be said to be in the right. You cannot say that the average\r\ncity government was entirely Roman or entirely Teutonic, either in the\r\nlaws which guided it, or in the channels by which these laws were\r\nexecuted and expressed. I think much time and much learning have been\r\nspent on a discussion both fruitless and unnecessary. We cannot err if\r\nwe subject the question to a consideration at once critical and\r\nimpartial.\r\n\r\nThe widely differing opinions eagerly supported by different writers\r\non this point, form a very good example of the deceiving influence of\r\nnational feeling on the judgment in matters of historical criticism.\r\nFor, on the one hand, we find many German writers ignoring entirely\r\nthe old framework of Roman organization, and recognizing only the new\r\nTeutonic life which gave back to it the strength it had lost; on the\r\nother, a host of lesser Italian writers who magnify certain old names\r\nand forms, and mistake them for the substance, making all the new life\r\nof Italy but the return of a past, which belonged to a greatness that\r\nwas dead. Many there are of this school in Italy, where you will often\r\nfind to-day a commune of three hundred inhabitants, with its one or\r\ntwo constables wearing the imperial badge, \"_Senatus Populusque\r\nAlbanensis_\" or \"_Verulensis_,\" as the case may be. Truly a suggestive\r\nanachronism! It is true that in remote ages especially, when the\r\nrecords of history are few and uncertain--and the period we are\r\nconsidering in this paper can almost be called the prehistoric age of\r\nmunicipal institutions in Northern Italy--much can be learned and much\r\ntruth inferred from the evidence of a name. But this is a species of\r\nevidence we can never be too cautious in using, as the temptation is\r\nalways to infer too much rather than too little.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I will try to sift the evidence obtainable,\r\nwith the impartiality of one trammeled by the support of no particular\r\ntheory; always bearing in mind, however, one fact, all-important in a\r\nstudy where so much depends on nomenclature, namely, to give that\r\nshade of meaning and that amount of weight to any term which it\r\npossessed in the age in which it was used, carefully distinguishing\r\nthis from its use in any earlier or later age. The importance of this\r\ncaution will be soon seen when we come to discuss the origin of\r\ncorporate life in the communes, where many have been misled by\r\nattaching to the words _respublica_ and _civitas_, for example, so\r\ncontinually recurring in the old laws and charters, a meaning which\r\nwas entirely foreign to the terms at the period of their use. With\r\nthis warning, we will turn to a consideration of the first effects of\r\nthe inroad of the northern barbarians on the cities, whose exhausted\r\nand defenseless state has already been pointed out.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief characteristics of the Teutonic tribes which overran\r\nItaly during the fifth and sixth centuries, was an innate hatred of\r\ncities, of enclosing walls and crowded habitations. Children of the\r\nfield and the forest, they had their village communities and their\r\nhundreds, their common land and their allotted land, but these were\r\nsmall restrictions on their free life, and left an extended\r\n\"air-space\" for each individual and his immediate household. Homestead\r\nwas not too near homestead, each man being separated from his neighbor\r\nby the extent of half the land belonging to each. The centralization\r\nof population in city life was a thing undreamed of, and an idea\r\nabhorred, alike for its novelty and for the violence it did to the as\r\nyet untrained instincts of the people. The strong, independent\r\nindividualism of the Teutonic freeman rebelled against anything which\r\nwould in any way limit his freedom of action: \"ne pati quidem inter se\r\njunctas sedes,\" says Tacitus.[3] An agriculturist in his rude way, he\r\nlived on the land which supported him and his family, and feeling no\r\nfurther need, his untrained intelligence could form no conception of\r\nthe necessities and the advantages of the social union and\r\ninterdependence of a more civilized state of society; nor could he\r\ncomprehend the mutual relations of the individual to the immediate\r\ncommunity in which he lived.\r\n\r\nHe could understand his own relation to and dependence on the state as\r\na whole; alone he could not repel the attacks of neighboring tribes,\r\nalone he could not go forth to conquer new lands or increase the\r\nnumber of his herds. But why he should associate with others and so\r\nlimit the freedom which was his birthright, for other purposes than\r\nthose of attack and defense, of electing a leader for war, or getting\r\nhis allotment of land in peace, was altogether beyond the horizon of\r\nhis comprehension. He was sufficient unto himself for all the purposes\r\nof his daily life; to the product of his own plough and hunting-spear\r\nhe looked for the maintenance of himself and his family, and the loose\r\norganization which we may call the state existed simply so as to\r\nenable him to live in comparative peace, or gain advantage in\r\nwar--perhaps the first example of the new power in state-craft which\r\nwas to revolutionize the political principles of the world; the\r\nindividual lived no longer simply to support the state, but the state\r\nexisted solely to protect and aid the individual.\r\n\r\nIf all this be true of the Teutonic nations in general, in the earlier\r\nstages of their development, particularly true is it of the\r\nLombards,[4] a wild tribe of the Suevic stock, whose few appearances\r\nin history, previous to their invasion of Italy, are connected only\r\nwith the fiercest strife and the rudest forms of barbarism. History\r\nseems to have proved that tradition has maligned the Vandal; the Goth\r\ncan boast a ruler raised at the centre of Eastern civilization and\r\nrefinement; but the Lombard of the invasion can never appear as other\r\nthan the rude barbarian rushing from his wild northern home, and\r\nforcing on a defenseless people the laws and the customs suited to his\r\nown rugged nature and the unformed state of society in which he lived.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, there is little cause for wonder that the\r\ninvading Lombard directed his fury with particular violence against\r\nthe corporate towns, whose strength was not sufficient to resist the\r\nattacks of his invading host. Like all other Teutonic tribes the\r\nLombards were entirely unskilled in the art of attacking fortified\r\ntowns; hence the only mode of siege with which they were acquainted\r\nwas that of starving out the inhabitants, by cutting off all source of\r\nsupply by ravaging and destroying the surrounding country. This fact,\r\nunimportant as it may seem at the first glance, materially affected\r\nthe whole course of the later history of some of the Italian cities.\r\nBy this means we are enabled, even at this early epoch, to divide them\r\ninto two classes. First, those cities which, after a more or less\r\nshort resistance, yielded to the rude tactics of the barbarians and\r\nwere made subject by them, for example Milan and Pavia.[5] Second,\r\nthose cities like Venice and Ravenna,[6] which, by means of a\r\nconnection with the sea which the invaders could not cut off, were\r\nenabled to gain supplies by water, and so resist all efforts of the\r\nbesieging host to capture them. They never fell completely under the\r\nLombard yoke, and either retained a sort of partial autonomy or\r\nyielded allegiance to some other power. It is the cities of the former\r\nclass that are the subject of this investigation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of these inland towns at the time of the invasion was,\r\nas we have seen, weak in the extreme. The defenses, where they\r\nexisted, were of a character to afford little protection, and the bulk\r\nof the inhabitants were so enervated from a life of poverty and\r\noppression that they were almost incapable of offering any resistance\r\nin their own defense. They were reduced to such a condition as to be\r\nonly too grateful if their rough conquerors, after an easy victory,\r\ndisdainfully spared their lives, and left them to occupy their\r\ndismantled dwellings.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the almost universal method of procedure. The\r\nLombards did not in any sense, at first, think of occupying the\r\nconquered cities; for the reasons already given they despised, because\r\nthey could not yet comprehend, the life of the civilian. They\r\ncontented themselves with pulling down the walls, razing the\r\nfortifications, and destroying every mark which would make of the city\r\nanything but an aggregate of miserable dwellings. The inhabitants were\r\nfor the most part spared, and left to enjoy, if the term can be used\r\nfor such an existence, what the conquerors did not think worth the\r\nhaving. These felt the fruits of their victory to lie in the rich\r\narable lands of the surrounding plains, and here they settled down,\r\neach in his own holding, portioned out by lot to every soldier; the\r\ntown being considered but as a part of the _civitas_ or district, if I\r\nmay use the term, of the _dux_ or overlord, from whom the several\r\n_milites_, or landholders of the surrounding territory, had their\r\ntenure, and who himself held directly from the king.\r\n\r\nIt is the very insignificance of the municipal unit at this time that\r\nmakes it so difficult to determine anything accurate of its position.\r\nIt existed, but little more can be said of it; indeed, even this\r\nstatement might be questioned, if we make that term signify a\r\ncorporate existence, as will be seen further on when we come to\r\ndiscuss the question of the unbroken corporate existence of the towns.\r\nIn a feudal age, or in an age of incipient feudalism, obligation,\r\neither claimed from an inferior or yielded to a superior, is a good\r\nindex of rank and importance. Until we find the cities fulfilling\r\ncertain obligations required by a higher power, we can learn little to\r\ntell of their condition or of their internal history. On the other\r\nhand, when we find the time come for fulfilling certain obligations,\r\nwe can safely argue that the cities have acquired certain functions\r\nwhich put them in a position to meet the obligations which their\r\ngrowing importance has caused to be exacted of them. To trace these\r\nsteps accurately and satisfactorily is impossible, but by the aid of\r\ncollateral evidence a rough idea of the epochs at least of their\r\nprogress can be gained.\r\n\r\nFor this first period, then, we see the towns reduced to the lowest\r\ndepths of wretchedness and disintegration; critically speaking hardly\r\nexisting, but simply holding together. In studying institutions and\r\ntracing the course of their development, we must always remember that\r\nthe uninterrupted continuance of their history may depend as much on\r\nthe moral force of their existence as on the more limited and defined\r\nfact of their accurate and legal recognition by others. In every\r\nsociety a state of fact must in time become a state of law, as wise\r\nlegislation is more the recognition by law of existing conditions than\r\nthe formulating of new codes. So the towns, even at the period\r\nimmediately succeeding their conquest by the Lombards, though their\r\ncorporate existence cannot be claimed, nevertheless cannot be said in\r\nany measure to have ceased to exist; for as collections of individuals\r\nand of dwellings they were there, with an individuality uneffaced\r\nthough as yet unrecognized.\r\n\r\nIt was a period of utter stagnation, of suspension of life, but the\r\nsource remained intact, from which, by the evolution of events and the\r\nprogress of time, seeds were to spring that only needed external\r\npressure to force them into a growth, slow indeed but certain, and in\r\nthe end fruitful. A transition period we might call it. The theory of\r\nRoman universal domination, by relegating to the central power all the\r\n_political_ functions of the municipality and leaving it only its\r\n_civic_ ones, and these in later imperial times grudgingly and with an\r\nimpaired independence, had left it simply an administrative instead of\r\na political division of the state. In the flush of triumph the rough\r\nhand of the barbarian overthrew the framework of administration, and\r\nat first failed to recognize the necessity of replacing it by any\r\nother. The passivity of the conquered inhabitants--the cause of which\r\nhas already been explained--was such that a long period elapsed before\r\nthey realized that to regain in some measure the position of local\r\nindependence that they had lost, and to free themselves from the\r\nshackles of dependence on the rural communities in which they were\r\nplaced--a dependence forced upon them by the natural development of\r\nthe new state system of their Teutonic conquerors--some common effort\r\nat organization was needful, for purposes at least of self-defense.\r\nThat this effort came from the town itself, from the people and not\r\nfrom the external power of the ruler or overlord, is the fact which\r\nfirst makes the history of these municipalities interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are two facts, however, which, even at this early date, begin to\r\ninfluence the internal history of the communes. These are the\r\ninfluence which the Church,[7] through its bishops, began to attain in\r\nthe civil affairs of the country; and the idea beginning to gain\r\ncurrency that the locality where a number of individuals, however\r\nwretched in state, were collected together, would afford a safer\r\nrefuge than the open country to the oppressed, the homeless and the\r\noutcast. I will briefly consider the latter first, as of less\r\nimportance, though not unconnected with the former.\r\n\r\nIn the period of great confusion in all relations of property which\r\nensued from the Lombard military system of small independent\r\nlandholders and a few great overlords, with a nominal royal ownership\r\nof title, and before the feudal system was established, with its iron\r\nrules in regular working order, constant inequalities of wealth and\r\nconsequent changes in the relative positions of individuals were sure\r\nto ensue. In practice if not in theory, might makes right in such a\r\nstate of society. The weaker goes to the wall, and the stronger gains\r\nin strength by his downfall. Besides, it was long before the roving\r\nand predatory instinct of the barbarian was moderated; and his weaker\r\nneighbor was the natural prey of the more powerful landholder, an\r\nexample not unfrequently set by the king himself. Now, if the weaker\r\nparty remained to brave the attack and was conquered, he was reduced\r\nto a state of villeinage or of dependence more or less complete. If on\r\nthe other hand he wished to escape this change of condition, where was\r\nhe to find refuge? The only safe asylum in those days of rapine and\r\nviolence was that offered by the Church and its precincts. The church\r\nof the greatest importance in the district, in this early age when no\r\nwalled monasteries existed, would without doubt be that situated\r\nwithin the limits of the nearest town. To this haven then comes the\r\noutcast, hastily collecting his family and all of his wealth of a\r\nportable character; the country loses a small landed proprietor, but\r\nthe town gains a citizen, a freeman, a member of the upper class.\r\n\r\nOf course many of the fugitives who sought asylum in the towns were as\r\nlow as the great numbers of the semi-servile population, but much that\r\nwas new and of a better character and intelligence, and even a large\r\namount of property, which later gave birth to commercial and other\r\ninterests, were introduced by members of the higher classes fleeing\r\nfrom their more powerful neighbors. Also the human instinct of seeking\r\nfellowship in misfortune probably assisted in increasing the numbers\r\nwhich in times of trouble flocked towards the towns as a haven of\r\nrefuge and a place to seek support. To see how they were in a measure\r\nenabled to attain these results, we must now consider the first of the\r\ntwo facts mentioned above, that is, the power in civil affairs gained\r\nby the bishops.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lombards of the conquest, in their hatred of everything which\r\nsavored of the old Roman civilization, overthrew all the established\r\noffices of city government to replace them with others of barbarian\r\nname and origin, or to leave them unfilled altogether, among the\r\ntime-honored officers of the Roman rule was one whose powers were\r\neverywhere recognized, even if at present it is a little difficult to\r\ndefine with precision his duties. I refer to the _defensor urbis_.\r\nThis office came into prominence when Roman despotism found that it\r\nwas overreaching itself by grinding down the defenseless _curiae_\r\nbelow the margin of productiveness. The duties of the _defensor_ were,\r\nas his name implies, to protect the powerless inhabitants of the\r\ncities against the exactions of the imperial ministers. He enjoyed\r\nmany important privileges of jurisdiction, and these were materially\r\nincreased by the legislation of Justinian; and soon the _defensor_\r\nbecame an important officer of the municipality.[8] What particularly\r\nconcerns us is that he was the only municipal officer who was elected\r\nnot by the votes of the _curia_ alone, but by those of the whole\r\npeople forming the _municipium_, including the bishop and his clergy.\r\nNow in the period just preceding the invasion of the barbarians, the\r\nclergy alone possessed any energy and influence; so into their hands\r\nfell the control of this new institution, and consequently all that\r\nremained of life in the municipal system.\r\n\r\nAs in city matters these conditions remained unaltered after the\r\ncoming of the Lombards, what was more natural than that the bishops\r\nshould retain their moral position of defenders of the people, even if\r\nwe admit that the form of the office fell with the old administration?\r\nTo these considerations we may add two important facts: that the\r\noffice of bishop was for a long time the only one in the election to\r\nwhich the people--and by this term I mean the people as a whole, not\r\nthe _populus_ of the old laws and charters--had any voice whatever;\r\nand that the bishop, from his spiritual position as pastor of the\r\nflock, and from his civil position as having great legal influence in\r\nthe town and being probably the only man of superior intellect\r\ninterested in the internal affairs of the community, was the proper\r\nand most effectual mediator between the people and their temporal\r\nrulers. Hence arose that important influence of the bishops which was\r\nto have so perceptible an effect on the subsequent development of the\r\nprinciples of liberty in the communes.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate properly, and to give the true value to this power in\r\nits later progress, we must remember one thing: that it did not have\r\nits origin by any seeking of power by either the Roman or the\r\nAmbrosian church as a body, in any concerted effort to extend the\r\necclesiastical power at the expense of the civil. It came from the\r\nspontaneous effort of the pastor, the natural and at that time the\r\nonly protector of the people, trying to save his flock from the\r\nextortion and the injustice of their temporal rulers. In addition to\r\nthis it must be remembered that at that time the office of the bishop\r\nwas the only one where even the shadow of the democratic idea was\r\npreserved, the only one where the lowest of the people, theoretically\r\nat least, had a voice in the election. In later times, when the feudal\r\nsystem becomes established in its completeness, the position of the\r\nbishop undergoes a great change, as his relations to the state and to\r\nsociety become more complex in their character; and his importance in\r\nthe community, while it at first increases, in time surely diminishes,\r\nunder the influence of his double relation of lord and vassal to some\r\nhigher temporal power. When he in his turn becomes the possessor of\r\npolitical power as a great baron or as head of a _civitas_, his\r\ninterests, and consequently his influence, are concerned with\r\nintriguing and with efforts for his own political advancement, in many\r\ncases leaving but few traces of the old relation of \"defender of the\r\npeople.\" It is, however, of importance to note that this decline in\r\nhis prominence in civil life is commensurate with the diminished need\r\nby the people of his protection, owing to the steady increase in the\r\nsecurity and independence of their position.\r\n\r\nTo sum up briefly the chief characteristics of the early and obscure\r\nperiod which we have been considering, I think we can truly call it a\r\ntransition period, and its history a tottering bridge from the dead\r\nRoman municipal system of the past, to the new state and city life of\r\nthe future; from a state of society where, as we have seen, the city\r\nhad changed from a political to an administrative division, to one\r\nwhere the city was to prepare itself again to claim, and eventually,\r\nby the growth of internal resources, to gain the lost function of\r\nsovereignty. The condition of the people during this time we have seen\r\nto be wretched in the extreme; the dismantled city but a bunch of\r\ncomfortless dwellings; its inhabitants but a semi-servile population,\r\nwith a small admixture of refugees of a better class; the city\r\noccupying but a subordinate place as part of the rural holding within\r\nwhose limits it stood; whatever of wealth it contained an easy if not\r\na legitimate prey to the turbulent spirits, whose mutual contests kept\r\nthe surrounding country in a continual state of disturbance. The only\r\nmen of any influence in the community we have seen to be the bishops,\r\nwho, while steadily gaining in rank and power, stood forth as\r\ndefenders of the people. During all this time, however, the new sap\r\nbrought by the northern conquerors has been slowly but steadily\r\nentering into and forming the constitution of the people. The chaste\r\nand uncorrupted Northmen have by means of legitimate intermarriage\r\nwith the best of the enervated inhabitants of the land, raised up an\r\nalmost new race, who combine in their nature the humanizing effects of\r\nthe old civilization with the love of independence and the temperate\r\nvirtues of the northern conquerors, a race willing to benefit by the\r\nexperience of the past, and resolved to carve out for itself a new and\r\nindependent future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SOURCES OF MUNICIPAL UNITY IN LOMBARD AND FRANKISH TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second part of this paper we have to consider a period of\r\ndevelopment rather than one of transition, of growth rather than of\r\nchange. We have before us the task of tracing the advance from a\r\nperiod of barbarism to one when the feudal system had obtained an\r\nalmost complete domination over the social system of Europe.\r\nConsidering the principles which lay at the base of the society of new\r\nEurope, this system is a natural, indeed an unavoidable evolution from\r\nthe stage of barbarism and social disorganization. The confusion in\r\nall social and economic relations consequent on the combination of the\r\nold and the new elements in European life, had led to a state of\r\ndisintegration that could not continue. A new regulative force was\r\nrequired which would at the same time have power sufficient to control\r\nthe various warring elements with which it had to deal and reduce them\r\nto some sort of harmony, and yet which would not in its nature be in\r\nopposition to the decentralizing spirit and the idea of individual\r\nindependence, which formed the most marked characteristic of the\r\ndominant element of the new society. Feudalism sprang from the midst\r\nof barbarism not by a sudden birth, but by a growth at once natural\r\nand necessary: natural, because it was but a regulation by law of\r\nconditions produced by the character of the people and their mode of\r\nlife; necessary, because the progress of civilization was carrying\r\nsociety ahead of the stage of anarchy and barbarism in which the\r\noverthrow of the old regime had left it.\r\n\r\nThe economic changes which were produced by the transition to the new\r\nprinciples represented by the feudal system, are as great and in their\r\nway as important as the political ones. When we say that feudalism\r\nrepresents the transfer of the dominant power from a central head to\r\nscattered members, from the capital to the castles, we speak of it in\r\nits most prominent, its political character. But we must not forget\r\nthat this transfer also meant a great economic change in the\r\norganization of society: that it meant a transfer of the seat of\r\neconomic importance from the city to the country; the spirit of the\r\ntimes requiring, especially in the earlier stages of the development\r\nof the institution, that the seat of wealth should follow the seat of\r\npower. I note this now because we shall soon have occasion to consider\r\nhow important a factor, in the earliest period of the development of\r\nthe cities, their entire lack of prominence in both political and\r\neconomic affairs was to prove itself. Under the old Roman system, as\r\nwe have seen, the city was the important unit: Rome was a subduer and\r\nan upbuilder of cities. Under the new Teutonic element the land is\r\nwhat is brought into prominence, and the possessor of it into power.\r\nThe dominant member of society is the landowner and not the citizen.\r\nIn ancient society the \"citizen\" need own no land; in the modern\r\nsociety of the feudal age, the \"gentleman\" could not be such without\r\nowning land.\r\n\r\nThis opposition between the citizen, the burgher, and the landowner,\r\nthe baron, leads us to a conclusion of the utmost importance to the\r\nwhole study of city life during the middle ages. We note the universal\r\nprevalence of the _forms_ characteristic of the feudal system, and\r\nfrom this we conclude that its _principles_ were as universally\r\nadopted. Now this is to a certain extent an error. There were certain\r\ninstitutions which from the very nature of their origin and of the\r\nprinciples on which they were based, must have been, at once in their\r\nidea and in their structure, opposed to the fundamental principle of\r\nfeudalism. The Roman Church, for example, conformed itself to the\r\nforms and customs of this system, but never lost its structural unity\r\nand centralization, ideas founded on principles which stood in direct\r\nopposition to those of feudalism. So it was, though perhaps in a less\r\ndegree, with the cities. Though adapting themselves in many ways to\r\nfeudal forms, here the idea of democracy was as strong in its\r\nopposition to the dominant principle of feudalism, as ever was that of\r\ncentralization in the Church. The people, in their own conception at\r\nleast, stood out as an organic unity, and they considered their rights\r\nand duties as matters which concerned them collectively, not\r\nseparately, as the commonwealth, not as individuals. Of course it was\r\nlong before any such opposition assumed a definite form and shape,\r\nbefore even the people became conscious of its existence; but what I\r\nwish to point out is, that it was there in fact from the beginning,\r\nand must have formed a structural part of the development of city life\r\nin the middle ages.\r\n\r\nIn outlining the course of the history of institutions, it is seldom\r\nthat we are so fortunate as to find definite landmarks by which we can\r\naccurately mark the chronological course of their development. The\r\ngiving of definite dates for the progress of ideas is in most cases\r\nboth misleading and illusory, as, except in instances of violent\r\nrevolution, changes are apt to be gradual, rather than immediate and\r\narbitrary. But we can indicate the periods of progress by comparing\r\nthem with the contemporary political changes, and roughly designate\r\ntheir eras by the dates of prominent political events. In doing this,\r\nhowever, we must always remember that the dates given, while definite\r\nfrom a political standpoint, are in most cases, from an institutional\r\nstandpoint, only indicative of a more or less extended period of\r\nchange. This fact being recognized, let us proceed to examine the\r\nchanges introduced into Italy by the Carlovingian rulers, and the\r\ncondition of the society upon which these changes were engrafted.\r\n\r\nWhen in the year 773-774, Charlemagne, in pursuance of his idea of\r\nuniversal empire, and aiding the Pope as \"Patricius\" of Rome, entered\r\nLombardy with his army, took Pavia after a siege of six months, and\r\nshut up Desiderius in a monastery, he found in Lombard society a well\r\ndefined, if not a perfectly developed system. In all their relations\r\nwith other nations, the evidence of history proves the Franks to have\r\nbeen a conquering rather than a colonizing race; consequently we may\r\nexpect to find that in their conquest of Lombardy, they rather gave\r\nher only new rulers without materially interfering with the condition\r\nof the inhabitants or altering their mode of life. The institutions of\r\nthe Frankish nation were similar, in many important matters identical,\r\nwith those of their neighbors across the Alps; so the changes\r\nintroduced into the Lombard system by the Carlovingian rule are, with\r\na few exceptions, not such as affect the integral structure of\r\nsociety, but for the most part only such as refer to the character and\r\nposition of the central or ruling power.\r\n\r\nI say with a few exceptions, for among these very exceptions are to be\r\nfound certain alterations in the government of the cities, introduced\r\nchiefly by the necessities of the system of central government\r\nestablished by Charlemagne, but also partly by the claims of\r\nindividuality, which at this time first began in the cities timidly to\r\ncall for recognition. The very relation of the cities with the central\r\npower seems to me to be a much more important factor in their growth\r\nduring this period than is generally supposed; for it not only secured\r\nto their inhabitants better chances of justice and protection from the\r\npowerful local rulers, but, bringing them, through certain officers,\r\ninto direct connection with the head of the state, added not a little\r\nto their moral importance, a condition which in a growing community is\r\nalways closely followed by an increase of material importance.\r\nAccording to their size they were the seats of courts of varying\r\ndegrees of importance, and from them as centres proceeded the acts of\r\nroyal officers, both ordinary and extraordinary. Ticinum was the\r\ncapital, where in Lombard times the king had his palace.[9]\r\n\r\nFor a satisfactory study of the development of the municipal\r\ninstitutions we need a thorough understanding of the organization of\r\nsociety at this time, and especially of the relations which the\r\nmunicipal and rural communities bore to one another and to the\r\ngovernment. I will endeavor to give, therefore, a description of\r\nLombard society about the close of the eighth century, as brief as is\r\nconsistent with a clear understanding of these relations, and as\r\ncomplete as the great difficulties of the subject will permit,\r\npointing out, whenever they are authentically traceable, the changes\r\nintroduced in consequence of the Carlovingian conquest.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach in Lombard history the period when the power of the\r\nnative kings was first overthrown by foreign arms, we are no longer\r\nconfronted by many of the problems which necessarily formed an\r\nimportant part of the earlier portions of our investigation. I mean\r\nthe problems which arise in a state of society where the mass of\r\nindividuals forming it is made up of two elements, a conquering,\r\ndominant one, and a conquered, subject one. During the two centuries\r\nelapsed since the Lombard barbarians conquered Italy, the two races,\r\noriginally so different in their ideas and in their character, so\r\nopposed in their customs and in their nature, have been slowly but\r\nsurely blending together, on the strength of common environment and by\r\nthe necessities of mutual relations: so that by the last half of the\r\neighth century, we can truly say that national differences, as such,\r\nhave disappeared, and left behind them a single race, a combination\r\nbut still a unity. We no longer have to deal with a double\r\nnationality, with the northern conquerors and their southern victims,\r\nwith the oppressed and their oppressors. In considering the\r\ndevelopment of the institutional life of the people, we need no longer\r\nseek for differences, but may assume the easier task of tracing\r\nsimilarities. In a word, we no longer speak of Lombards and of Romans,\r\nbut describe all that remains of both by the new word _Italians_.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this enquiry to trace the various steps\r\nor indicate the various influences, the civilizing effect of the\r\nChurch, the restraining power of the law, by which this complete\r\namalgamation of two distinct races became an accomplished fact; we\r\nneed only to note that the unity of the race was achieved. Even\r\nMacchiavelli recognizes this fact and, speaking of the time of the\r\nCarlovingian conquest, in the brief review of the history of all Italy\r\nwhich forms the first part of the first book of the \"Florentine\r\nHistory,\" he truly says that, after two hundred and twenty-two years\r\nof occupation by the Lombards, \"they retained nothing of the foreigner\r\nsave the name.\"[10]\r\n\r\nBut we must always bear in mind that it was not a process of\r\nabsorption of one race by another, but a process of combination, of\r\namalgamation; a levelling process, by which some members of the\r\nconquered people, by natural and economic causes, were raised to the\r\nlevel of their superiors; and on the other hand, some of the\r\nconquerors, by reason of similar causes, fell to the rank of the\r\nsubject population. By manumission and by the various forms of\r\nvassalage more or less honorable, and by gaining some economic\r\nimportance by trade and other means, many of the descendants of the\r\nRoman population gained admission to the ranks of the Arimanni, and\r\nobtained the full franchise by the possession of landed property. By\r\nforfeitures, consequent poverty and ultimate pauperization, many of\r\nthe Lombard stock lost their rank and their lands and entered the same\r\nstate of vassalage with the great body of the people. We see evidences\r\nof this change, this levelling up and levelling down, all through the\r\nmilitary code of Liutprand, and in the later one of Aistulf can even\r\nmore distinctly trace its progress; and without entering into further\r\ndetail, we can definitely state that, by the time we are now\r\nconsidering, all traces of distinct race-origin had disappeared in the\r\nmass of the people, and the only safe distinction that we can draw is\r\nto say that among the families of the dukes and greater nobles, the\r\nLombard stock was preserved comparatively pure, and that the serf\r\npopulation was, generally speaking, of Roman descent.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       KING\r\n          +--------------+--------------+\r\n          |              |              |\r\n        COUNTS         DUKES         GASTALDS\r\n                         |\r\n          +--------------+--------------+\r\n          |              |              |\r\n        CUTANEI       SCABINI       SCULDAHIS\r\n     (LATER BARONS)\r\n      | | | | |\r\n      | | | | +-------------------------------+\r\n      | | | +-------------------------+       |\r\n      | | +-------------------+       |       |\r\n      | +-----------+         |       |       |\r\n      |             |         |       |       |\r\n     ARIMANNI       |         |       |       |\r\n                 MASNADA      |       |       |\r\n                            ALDII     |       |\r\n                                    SERFS     |\r\n                                            SLAVES\r\n\r\n     The above table, while its divisions must not be taken too\r\n     literally, will, I think, give some indication of the\r\n     estimation in which the various classes of society were\r\n     held. It is too early yet in the development of the feudal\r\n     system to say that the derivation lines show the course of\r\n     an absolute feudal tenure, and they are not meant for that\r\n     purpose, but simply to indicate the succession of the\r\n     inequalities of rank.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the territorial divisions of the country at this\r\nperiod, we find them practically unchanged. The _civitas_ still stands\r\nas the sectional unit; the territory with its city still represents\r\nthe administrative division of the state. It is fundamental to a\r\ncorrect understanding of the early development of communal\r\ninstitutions that we should have a thorough knowledge of the meaning\r\nof this term _civitas_; of the extent of its application and of its\r\nlimitations. I used the words \"territory with its city\" in defining\r\nthe administrative division of the state, and perhaps this term\r\ndescribes the _civitas_ better than any single word would do. In the\r\nRoman municipal system we have the city with its surrounding\r\nterritory, over which extends the jurisdiction of the _curia_; in the\r\nLombard system we have the territory, the land, in some part of which\r\nis located a city, a fortified place.\r\n\r\nThis is to my mind the important point which settles satisfactorily\r\nthe vexed question of the dominance or the disappearance of Roman\r\ninfluences. The institutions of the Lombards were similar in character\r\nto those of the other Germanic races, and the continuance of any\r\noverruling municipal influence among them would have done violence\r\nalike to their traditions and to the nature of their race. The old\r\nmunicipal predominance as a system disappeared, the old municipal\r\ndivisions and many of the minor forms and offices as a fact remained.\r\nIt is these latter which give some color to the arguments of writers\r\nlike Savigny,[12] who endeavor to maintain the continuance of the old\r\nRoman _curia_. They find evidence of the continuance of old\r\nboundaries, of many old names and many old executive functions, and\r\nfail to appreciate that the principle which lay back of and was making\r\nuse of these old forms as convenient channels for the expression of\r\nits power and of its control, was an entirely new one, based on ideas\r\nfundamentally opposed to those of the civilization it had conquered.\r\nThis slight warning is necessary so as to avoid any error in the\r\nconception of the significance to be attached to the geographical\r\nlimits of the divisions of territory we are considering.\r\n\r\nThe word _civitas_ has the same signification as _comitatus_, when\r\nthat word was used with the meaning of a territorial division; and\r\nincluded all the territory, with its lands, its villages, its\r\nfortified places and its city, which came under the jurisdiction of a\r\n_dux_ or _judex_, or in Frankish times of a count, when we are\r\nstrictly justified in giving it the more familiar name of _county_.\r\nFrom this we trace the Italian word _contado_, by the steps _comitatu,\r\ncomitato, contato, contado_. The land division here indicated is\r\nindifferently called in the Lombard records _territorium, fines,\r\ncivitas_, or _judiciaria_. The identity of all these terms admits of\r\neasy proof from all the documents, public and private; and numberless\r\ninstances could be cited showing an interchange of terms in describing\r\nthe same locality.\r\n\r\nI will mention in illustration of this fact the rather neat example of\r\na document of the year 762, published by Brunetti[13] in his Codice\r\nDiplomatico Toscano, in which three of these terms are used\r\ninterchangeably in the space of a few lines. It is a contract by which\r\na certain Arnifrid, an inhabitant of Clusium--the modern Chiusi--who\r\n\"in clusino territorio ... natus fuit,\" pledges himself to live on a\r\ncertain property, and says \"nullam conbersationem facias nec in clusio\r\nnec in alia civitate habitandum, nisi.... &c.,\" and promises to pay\r\nfifty _solidi_ if \"pro eo quod ipsa pecunia demittere presumbsero aut\r\nde judiciaria vestra suaninse exire voluero.\" The contract is \"Actum\r\nin civitate suana.\" We here see the words _territorium_ and _civitas_\r\nboth applied to the territory of Chiusi, and the words _judiciaria_\r\nand _civitas_ both applied to the territory of Siena, and we only need\r\nto remember that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to\r\neach other, to recognize the identity of the terms. If we look at\r\ndocument number eight in the same collection,[14] we will further see\r\nthe territory of Chiusi referred to as \"fines clusinas.\"\r\n\r\nHand-in-hand with the growth of episcopal organization we see another\r\nterm coming into use in connection with the same land division, and\r\nthis also is an administrative one, but of the church simply, and only\r\nmade use of by conversion or carelessly when applied to a civil area.\r\nI mean the _districtus_, which term is properly applicable only to the\r\njurisdiction of a bishop, and designates the limits of his episcopal\r\npower, that is, his diocese. The reasons for this term being used in\r\nlater times occasionally for the civil division, the _civitas_, are\r\ntwofold. They result, firstly, from the confusion which arose between\r\nmatters of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, when political power\r\nwas given to a large number of the bishops, and when they united to\r\ntheir religious duties as pastor, the judicial and sometimes even some\r\nof the military duties of _comes_ and _judex_. And secondly, in the\r\nimportant fact that in almost all cases the boundaries of a bishop's\r\ndiocese coincided more or less exactly with the limits of the\r\nauthority of the state officers; so that the division which should be\r\ncalled a _civitas_ or _territorium_ from the point of view of civil\r\ngovernment, should be called a _districtus_ from that of\r\necclesiastical government.\r\n\r\nWhere we find at once the most important and, if not rightly\r\nunderstood, the most perplexing traces of the survival of the old\r\nRoman municipal system, is in this matter of territorial boundaries.\r\nAccording to the Roman system, as we have seen, the city was the\r\nimportant administrative unit, and each city was surrounded by a belt\r\nof rural lands, more or less large according to the size and\r\nimportance of the city itself. This of course resulted in a division\r\nof the whole country into a number of districts whose boundaries were\r\ndefinitely marked, perhaps even jealously guarded. Now, when the\r\nLombards took possession of the country, while they rejected the\r\nprinciple of the municipal unit, as foreign to the character and\r\ninstincts of their race, they could not fail to see the practical\r\nutility of using, and the actual difficulty of overthrowing, a system\r\nof land division which custom and authority had united in rendering\r\nalike definite and convenient. What was the result? They made use of\r\nthe old boundary lines, leaving their limits, as far as we can judge,\r\nuntouched, and substituted as the fundamental principle of their\r\nadministration, in place of the Roman idea of the _municipium_, the\r\nthoroughly Teutonic idea of the _civitas_ or country district.\r\nCoincident with these time-honored boundaries which served to mark the\r\nlimits of the jurisdiction of the duke and the _judex_, are to be\r\nfound those of the ecclesiastical power, of the bishop's diocese.\r\n\r\nThis statement is confirmed by the many charters, immunities, etc.,\r\naddressed to the episcopal authorities; and direct proof of it may be\r\nhad by reference to the controversy which arose in the first half of\r\nthe eighth century between the bishops of Arezzo and Siena, which\r\ndispute was based on the fact that for reasons definitely stated these\r\ntwo dioceses formed an exception to the general rule. The strength of\r\nthe proof lies in this exception, which had a well-known cause for its\r\norigin. Some of the documents[15] in the case, of the year 715, show\r\nthat the bishop of Siena claimed for his jurisdiction certain churches\r\nwhich belonged to the diocese of Arezzo, basing his claim solely on\r\nthe ground that these churches were situated in the _territorium_ of\r\nSiena. The bishop of Arezzo, on the other hand, claims them as part of\r\nhis diocese, on the ground that they had formed part of it ever since\r\nthe beginning of Lombard rule in Italy; and--which is the part of\r\nimportance to us--gives as the only reason for their having been\r\nattached to the diocese of a neighboring _territorium_, the fact that\r\nat that early date there was no bishop in the _territorium_ of Siena.\r\nThat a claim of such a character should have been based on the\r\nargument of the natural coincidence of the boundaries of _territorium_\r\nand diocese, is sufficient proof of the identity of these limits at\r\nthat age. In a bull of the year 752,[16] Pope Stephen II. decides to\r\nadhere to the already existing diocesan divisions, and adjudges to the\r\nbishop of Arezzo the churches \"quae esse manifestum est sub\r\nconsecratione et regimine praefatae S. Aretinae Ecclesiae, territorium\r\nvero est prefatae nominatae Civitatis Senensis.\"\r\n\r\nWe see then the perpetuation of the old Roman land divisions in the\r\nnew commonwealth through the medium of the _civitas_ and the diocese.\r\nHow long these divisions remained intact and what were the causes and\r\nthe extent of their final overthrow, forms part of the history of the\r\nlater development of the Italian communes. Here I will simply indicate\r\nthe fact, that among the reasons which led in most instances to a\r\ndeparture from this system of land boundaries, are to be found some of\r\nthe most important causes for the development of freedom and\r\nindependent jurisdiction among the cities. It is to the destruction of\r\nthis identity of interests and of government which existed between\r\ncountry and city, that is owed the ultimate predominance of the\r\nlatter, and its regaining its ancient position of a self-centered\r\nunity; although in its new form we find this depending on the\r\nprinciple of individual liberty, instead of being based on the\r\nprinciple of government by a central power. Whether this emancipation\r\nfrom the bonds of a rural dependence was brought about by the practice\r\nlater entered upon, of breaking up the counties into a number of\r\nsmaller units with the so-called \"rural counts,\" each ruling over a\r\n_castellum_ or fortified village; or by the fact that many of the\r\nbishops obtained political as well as religious control over a city\r\nand a limited area of the surrounding country, generally extending\r\nonly three or five miles beyond the city walls; or whether this\r\nfreedom was the result of the spontaneous growth of civic and economic\r\nlife within the city itself; or finally, whether it came from a\r\ncombination of all these and many minor causes, is a question\r\nwhich--for the early period of the development at least--the progress\r\nof our investigation will answer for itself.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be impossible for us to understand thoroughly the\r\nrelations of the city under Lombard and Frankish rule to the central\r\nand to the local government, unless we know somewhat of the local and\r\nstate officers who exercised jurisdiction within the territorial\r\nlimits just described. By a consideration of their special powers and\r\nof their special duties, we must learn all that we can know with any\r\ndegree of certainty with regard to the position of the city in these\r\ntimes. With this in mind, let us first examine the office whose\r\nfunctions it is at once the most difficult and the most important for\r\nus to understand in all its bearings--that of the _Judex_. We must\r\nconsider it not only in the relation which it bears to the higher\r\ngrade of officers, the Lombard duke and the Frankish count, but also\r\nin its relation with the lower officials who severally enjoyed more or\r\nless of the powers attached to its possession, namely, the gastald,\r\nthe sculdahis, the scabino, and even the rural counts and the bishop.\r\nAnd in tracing its development we must note the influence it bore on\r\nthe growth of the municipal idea, and also its connection with the\r\npolitical jurisdiction, commonly combined with it in the person of a\r\nsingle official.\r\n\r\nIn considering the institutions of a comparatively crude state of\r\nsociety, such as existed in Europe in the early middle ages, it is\r\nmisleading if not impossible to differentiate to any great extent the\r\nvarious functions and kinds of power which were commonly centered in\r\nthe same individual. Consequently the only safe way to give a clear\r\nidea of the position and the powers of the _judex_, is to give a\r\ndescription of the various offices to which judicial authority was\r\nattached, in degrees more or less complete, corresponding to the\r\nsocial and political importance of the person exercising this\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn the Lombard system, at the head of each _civitas_, as lord and as\r\njudge, was the _dux_, or duke. His title and his office being but the\r\nrelic of his original high position of leadership in the army of the\r\ninvasion, when his command was only subject to that of the king, the\r\nleader-in-chief of the army-nation and head of the military\r\nconstitution, he held directly from the king, attended the royal\r\n_placita_ as the king's vassal, and held _placita_ of his own within\r\nhis own jurisdiction, and over which he presided in person. Beyond the\r\nduties of his own particular jurisdiction his chief office was to\r\nassist the king by his presence and his counsel, when the king gave\r\nhis judgments at the annual assembly in March, at the capital Ticinum.\r\nThe importance of this concurrence of the _judices_ in all the king's\r\ndecrees and official acts is illustrated by the fact that cases are\r\nrare in which this concurrence remains unmentioned. The usual practice\r\nis to introduce in the prologue which is commonly attached to the laws\r\ngiven out during each year of the king's reign, after the mention of\r\nthe date \"Kalendiis Martiarum,\" some such expression as \"cum nostris\r\nJudicibus\";[17] or \"ad nos conjungerentur Judices\";[18] or \"per\r\nsuggestionem Judicum\";[19] to which is sometimes added the formula\r\n\"omniumque consensum,\"[19] or \"cum reliquis nostris Langobardis\r\nfidelis.\" That legislation was not considered valid until such consent\r\nand advice was obtained, we can see from the prologue to the laws\r\nissued in the thirteenth year of the reign of Liutprand, in which he\r\nrefers to certain important \"causae\" which had come under his\r\njurisdiction, and for which additional legislation was necessary, the\r\nlaws already existing failing to reach them. To meet the exigency new\r\nlaws are enacted, but the king especially states that the cases must\r\nremain in abeyance until the new laws are confirmed by the _judices_\r\nat the next assembly in March. In speaking of these \"causae\" in the\r\nabove-mentioned prologue to the laws, he says: \"Proinde providimus eas\r\nusque ad suprascriptum diem Kalendii Martiarum suspendere dum usque\r\nnostri ad nos conjungerentur judices,\" etc.[20] This attendance at the\r\nroyal _placita_ represents the most important of the legislative\r\nduties of the _judex_ outside of his own jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOf other duties which caused him to leave the seat of his authority,\r\nthe only ones we need here consider are his military duties; and with\r\nregard to these it will be sufficient to point out that the _judex_\r\nwas the leader in war of the vassals and lesser lords, and indeed of\r\nall the inhabitants of the _judiciaria_ who were entitled or\r\ncompelled, by the forms of their tenure, to bear arms. Ample proof of\r\nthis is to be found throughout the law codes, but we need not pause to\r\ncite such confirmation, if we remember the natural evolution of the\r\noffice of _dux_ from his position in the original Lombard military\r\nsystem. As a good example of this military leadership we may refer to\r\nthe provisions of the twenty-ninth law in the sixth book of the laws\r\nof Liutprand.[21]\r\n\r\nWhat is of the greatest importance to us, however, in bringing out the\r\nrelations of the cities to the rest of the community in Lombard and\r\nFrankish times, is the position of the _judex_ as duke and as count\r\nwithin his own _judiciaria_, that is, within the _civitas_ of which he\r\nwas both lord and judge. It was through him, or perhaps I should say\r\nchiefly through him, that the city was at this period connected with\r\nthe state; and it was principally by the exercise of the functions of\r\nhis office that the city formed a part of the state. His official\r\nresidence, in the majority of cases, and his courts, were situated\r\nwithin the city's limits; thus making the official machinery of\r\ngovernment a part of the city life, and causing the city to become an\r\nactual if not a legally recognized part of the constitution of the\r\nstate. As far as this investigation is concerned, this represents the\r\nprominent feature of the power and position of the head of the\r\n_civitas_. We must be careful, however, to avoid any confusion of\r\nideas as to the importance which it gave to the city as a municipal\r\nunit or as a corporation. It was in no way what we could call a\r\nmunicipal government, even admitting a rather loose interpretation of\r\nthe term, as the supporters of the theory of the survival of the Roman\r\ncurial system would have us believe.[22] The _judex_ may be called\r\n\"the highest municipal officer among the Lombards,\" and this\r\ndesignation still be correct, though perhaps misleading. He was the\r\nhighest officer of the locality, and his official duties were for the\r\nmost part carried on within the city; but the leading fact we must\r\nkeep prominently before us is, that he was the head of the whole\r\n_civitas_, and not in any sense of the city as such: and further, that\r\nhis powers over the rural portions of the _civitas_ were in no sense\r\nadded to any purely municipal powers he may have possessed; but, on\r\nthe contrary, if we are to draw any distinctions, the municipality\r\nformed a part of the land division. That the whole _civitas_ was\r\ncommonly named after the largest town contained within its borders,\r\nand that the seat of power was generally placed within the city walls,\r\nare facts too evidently brought about by motives of convenience and\r\nexpediency and by the force of old association, to lead to any\r\nconfusion in appreciating the proper place of the city. Where there\r\nwere to be found buildings suitable for the residence of the _dux_,\r\nand where was located the largest collection of individuals, was\r\nmanifestly the most appropriate place for holding the courts and\r\nsettling the disputes of the inhabitants of the whole _civitas_, and\r\nthis formed a natural centre for the machinery of government. But\r\nevery inhabitant of the _civitas_ had equal rights with the townsman\r\nproper, and, as in the old Greek [Greek: polis], the most remote\r\ncountryman dwelling on the borders of the _civitas_, if he possessed\r\nthe franchise, was as much a citizen of Padua, Siena or Milan, as if\r\nhe dwelt within the walls of the city which gave its name to the whole\r\n_civitas_.\r\n\r\nA consideration of these facts brings out two important points, which\r\nI will briefly indicate before passing on to a little more detailed\r\ntreatment of the powers and the duties of the _judex_. In the first\r\nplace it has been made clear that at the time under discussion nothing\r\nthat could correctly be called a \"municipal system\" existed in\r\nLombardy, and the city, _as such_, had no independent existence or\r\nindependent relations with the state. And secondly, it cannot but be\r\nmanifest that the position that the city did occupy as actual, if not\r\nnecessarily as legal, centre from which issued all the administrative\r\nfunctions of the district, the residence of the chief authority and\r\nthe seat of his courts, would have a marked tendency to increase\r\nslowly, perhaps imperceptibly at first, the importance of its position\r\nat once in the _civitas_ and in the state, and at the same time to\r\nimprove the character of its inhabitants and in time increase their\r\nwealth. That this ultimately came about the development of the later\r\nindependent communal life is a proof, and the tardy steps by which\r\nthis was attained but serve to show the difficulties consequent on so\r\nslight and so feeble a beginning.\r\n\r\nThe obscurity which promptly descends on the brain of the intelligent\r\nreader who endeavors to gain a clear idea of the state of society or\r\nof the administration of government in these early ages of Italian\r\nhistory, makes the careful student very skeptical of any precise\r\npresentation he may find of them, and causes him to be particularly\r\ncautious and proportionately diffident in making, himself, any very\r\ndefinite statements concerning them. If he be a wise man and wish to\r\nmake his investigation of some use to others, he frequently says \"it\r\nseems probable,\" and he particularly avoids mentioning dates which are\r\nfixed and immovable. If this may be said of all matters not belonging\r\nsimply to the narrative portions of history at this period,\r\nparticularly true is it of the different functions attributed to\r\nvarious officers of local government, whose very titles we sometimes\r\nhave to infer from their duties, and whose duties we often have to\r\ninfer from their titles.\r\n\r\nTo these the _judex_, though the most prominent, cannot be said to\r\nform an exception. That he was the head of the district judicial\r\nsystem has in part been already shown, and will come out more clearly\r\nwhen we come to define the powers of some of his subordinates. His\r\nleadership in war we have seen to be but the natural continuance of\r\nhis original office; and that as _dux_ he was to be ranked among the\r\nfirst nobles of the land, the \"optimates,\" the \"viri illustres,\" we\r\ncan see from the following passage in the laws of Liutprand, when in\r\nthe prologue to the third book already quoted, he gives forth the\r\nedict with the judges as \"una cum illustribus viris optimatibus meis\r\nex Neustriae et Austriae et Tusciae partibus vel universis nobilibus\r\nLangobardis.\"[23] Although the position of the _duces_ as nobles of\r\nthe land never altered, their power relative to that of the king\r\nsuffered many modifications. The ducal power--\"principes\" of\r\nTacitus--preceding among the Lombards that of the king, we see the\r\ndukes exercising much greater control in the earlier stages of the\r\nmonarchy: even, on the death of Clefis--576--actually establishing a\r\nsort of aristocratic republic, under the leadership of thirty dukes,\r\nwhich lasted for ten years; after which time, on the event of a\r\ndangerous war with the Greeks and the Franks, Authari, the son of\r\nClefis, gained the throne by election; the dukes giving up to him,\r\nsays Paulus Diaconus,[24] the half of their estates for the support of\r\nhis dignity, retaining, however, the rest, not as servants of the\r\nking, but as \"principes\" of the people, an important distinction.\r\nAgiluf--591 to 615--originally duke of Turin, met with much opposition\r\nfrom the power of the dukes; but when we come to the time of\r\nRhotari--636 to 652--we find their power already declining, and in the\r\neighth century, as for example under Liutprand--712 to 736--the laws\r\nshow them reduced to the position of the other _judices_, but still\r\nrepresenting a high aristocracy whose consent was, as we have seen,\r\nnecessary to all acts of the king.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the functions of the _dux_ as _judex_ was\r\nholding the _Curtis Regia_ or _Curtis Ducalis_, in the largest city or\r\n\"urbs\" of every _civitas_. Here, in conjunction with his subordinates,\r\nhe heard all cases which did not go up to the king for judgment, and\r\nhere was centered the fiscal administration of the _civitas_. To\r\ndescribe in detail the composition of these _curtes_, their\r\njurisdiction and methods of procedure, would require a whole chapter\r\nof no mean proportions, and however interesting in itself, would be\r\nout of place in the present investigation. All that it is needful for\r\nus to consider is the relation of these _curtes_ to the municipalities\r\nin which they were located. Of their location within the city walls\r\nthe proofs to be found in numbers of the old documents are to me\r\nconclusive. I will give a few examples, however, commencing with two\r\nfrom the documents which have already been quoted from Brunetti,\r\nrelating to the dispute between the bishops of Siena and Arezzo. In\r\nthe first of these[25] we see that in the year 715, the king's\r\n_majordomus_ Ambrosius interferes \"in Curte a Domini Regis\" at Siena,\r\nin opposition to the local bishop and gastald; and in the second[26]\r\nwe find the royal notary Gunthram forbidding a fresh examination of\r\nwitnesses \"in Curte Regia Senensis.\" In a document of the next\r\nyear[27]--716--we find \"Ebugansus, Notarius regiae Curtis,\" taking\r\npart in the procedure in a case between the bishops of Pistoia and\r\nLucca; and a little later, in the year 756, is mention of an exchange\r\nof property between \"civitis regia lucencis\" and the church situated\r\nin that city.[28] In the \"Opusculum de Fundat. Monast. Nonantulae,\"\r\npublished by Muratori,[29] we find a donation by King Aistulf to that\r\nmonastery: \"prope castellum Aginulfi, quod pertinet de curte nostra\r\nlucense, et duas casas masaritias de ipsa curte\"; and \"granum ilium,\r\nquod annue colligitur de portatico, in Curte nostra, quae sita est in\r\nCivitate Nova.\"[30] In Carlovingian times Charles the Bald, in the\r\nyear 875, in the \"Chronica Farfense,\"[31] appears as saying, \"in Curte\r\nnostra infra Castrum Viterbense\": elsewhere \"curtis regie Viturbensis\"\r\nis spoken of[32]: and later, in 899, Berenger gives to the bishop of\r\nFlorence \"terram ... pertinentem de curte Regis istae Florentiae\"[33]:\r\nand finally, not to multiply examples, I will mention a privilege of\r\nKarloman's, published by Ughelli[34], by which he gives to the bishop\r\nof Parma certain regalia: \"id est curtem regiam extructam infra\r\ncivitatem Parmam cum omne officio suo,\" etc. From even these few\r\ninstances we can see the connection between the _Curtis Regia_ and the\r\ncity which gave its name to the _civitas_, a connection the importance\r\nof which we must not fail to appreciate, in consideration of the great\r\ninfluence which it exercised in the future development of the\r\nmunicipal unit from a beginning so insignificant.\r\n\r\nOf some importance in connection with the early history of the cities\r\nare the questions which arise in relation to the fiscal duties and\r\nprivileges of the _curtes regia_ and its officers. In it was centered\r\nthe fiscal administration of the kingdom; and its officers, in the\r\nvarious grades from the _dux_ downward, received and were responsible\r\nfor the revenues of the state. So prominent a part belonged to this\r\nform of the functions of the _curtes_ that it is quite common to hear\r\nthe revenues themselves, by a transposition of terms, called by that\r\nname, or by that of _palatium_, a word sometimes found even for the\r\n_curtes regia_ in their proper general sense; but this, from what I\r\nhave been able to gather concerning its legitimate use, should\r\nproperly be applied only to the residence, or by conversion the\r\nrevenues of the king himself[35]. What is of interest to us in this\r\nmatter is the fact that the _curtis regia_ fell heir to the _publicum_\r\nor communal property of the old Roman _curia_, when these were\r\noverthrown by the Lombard conquest.\r\n\r\nIn considering this phase of civil administration under the Lombard\r\nsystem, we are again brought face to face with the old question of the\r\nsurvival or non-survival of corporate existence among the cities. For\r\nif it could be proved that the municipality in its corporate capacity\r\nretained the communal property and administered it, there would appear\r\nto be good grounds for the assertion of the continuance of some form\r\nof quasi-independent municipal government; but if, on the other hand,\r\nit were found that the property of the municipality passed to the new\r\nhead of local administration or to the central power, it would be\r\nevident that the continuance of the municipal system as such was a\r\nlogical impossibility; for, deprived at once of its property and of\r\nits revenues, it would have had no vitality to keep it from a speedy\r\nend.\r\n\r\nIn investigating a question of this nature from the sources at our\r\ndisposal in a period of history so obscure, we cannot expect to find\r\nany definite statements sufficiently precise to set at rest at once\r\nall opposition and discussion; but after considering the character of\r\nthe people we are investigating and studying their institutions, and\r\nafter a careful examination of the laws and records which form the\r\nsources of our information, we are, I think, in a position to be able\r\nto give a sufficiently decided opinion as to whether a particular set\r\nof facts or conditions could possibly have existed in a state of\r\ndevelopment and in a society of a given character. Thus it is in\r\nregard to the matter in hand. From the numberless cases in which the\r\n_publicum_ is mentioned in the documents from which we draw our\r\nmaterials, it seems to me possible for a critical examiner to come to\r\nbut one conclusion, if, as is quite essential, he take into\r\nconsideration the unmistakable spirit of these writings, and if he\r\ngive a legitimate interpretation to the various terms employed. To\r\ncite in direct proof any individual instance is, perhaps, impossible;\r\nbut indirect evidence is forthcoming in abundance, and of a character\r\nto be, to me at least, entirely conclusive. The conclusion reached is,\r\nthen, that the king and the dukes were the successors of the old\r\n_curia_ in the possession and the administration of all properties and\r\nrevenues, taxes and fines formerly belonging to the organized\r\ncorporations of the Roman municipalities, and that the _curtes regiae_\r\nwere the channel through which these were collected, divided and\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\nThe grounds on which this assertion is based are the continual\r\nrecurrence of examples of functions of a fiscal character being\r\nexercised by the head of the _civitas_ and his officers, and by them\r\nalone; and it appears to me that it could only be by a complete\r\nmisunderstanding of the spirit of the early writings, and by a\r\ncomprehensive misapplication of the terms used in them, that these\r\nfunctions could be referred to any other power. These functions of the\r\nadministration may be grouped under three main heads, viz: 1. Fines\r\nand forfeitures, which, of course, played a very prominent part under\r\nthe Teutonic system of composition for offenses of a criminal nature;\r\n2. Taxes and privileges, by which is meant feudal rights, dues, etc.;\r\nand 3. Buildings and lands belonging to the crown or to the head of\r\nthe _civitas_ as a public officer.\r\n\r\nOf the fines and forfeitures paid into the _publicum_, we find that a\r\npart went to the royal treasury and a part to the _judex_, and in some\r\ncases to the informer or the prosecuting officer; and at different\r\ntimes we find these proportionate amounts definitely defined--as, for\r\ninstance, in the time of Charlemagne two parts went to the king and\r\none part to the count who acted as _judex_;[36] this we know from two\r\nof the Lombard laws of that emperor.[37] In one of these,[38] speaking\r\nof those who evaded military service, he says: \"Heribannum comes\r\nexactare non praesumat: nisi Missus noster prius Heribannum ad partem\r\nnostram recipiat, et ei,\" the Count, \"suam tertiam partem exinde per\r\njussionem nostram donet.\"[39] We even find evidence of quite a large\r\namount of liberty used by the _duces_ in the ultimate disposal of\r\nproperty coming under their jurisdiction by forfeiture, the more\r\npowerful making use of it precisely as if it were private property.\r\nFor example, in the Chronica Farfensis[40] appears a case judged by\r\nHildeprandus, _dux_ of Spoleto, in the year 787. A certain nun named\r\nAlerona, for having married a man named Rabennonus, \"secundum legem\r\nomnis substantia ipsius ad Publicum devoluta est\"; a little later\r\nRabennonus, for having killed a man, \"medietas omnis illius\r\nsubstantiae ad Publicum devoluta est.\" In consequence, in poetic\r\njustice and for the good of his soul and the king's, Hildeprandus\r\nquite arbitrarily presents \"omnem praedictam illorum substantiam,\r\nqualiter secundum legem juste et rationabiliter, ad Publicum devoluta\r\nest,\" to the Monastery of Farfa \"pro mercede Domnorum nostrorum Regum\r\net nostra.\" Here, as in many other cases, we see the _dux_ making\r\ngifts of property belonging clearly to the _publicum_, to persons\r\nfavored by him and for his own benefit. Such a condition of affairs\r\nwould certainly never have existed had public property been\r\nadministered by authority other than that of the _dux_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the revenues falling under the second of the rough\r\ndivisions we have indicated--taxes and privileges--it is easier to see\r\nwhy differences of opinion should have arisen; for here, especially in\r\nmatters relating to the collecting of taxes and dues, we are\r\nconfronted with the names of a large number of lesser officials and\r\nsubordinates of the _judex_, some of which are undoubtedly taken from\r\nthe like officers existing in the old Roman curial system. But this\r\nsurvival of names, and in some instances of offices, need cause us no\r\nalarm, for it coincides exactly with the theory presented, namely, a\r\ncontinuance of many of the old _forms_ of administration controlled by\r\nan entirely new _principle_ of government. There are certain minor\r\nfunctions necessary for the support of the state which must be carried\r\non in much the same manner, whatever be the character of the governing\r\npower--certain subordinate offices whose duties must be performed\r\nunder a republic or under a despotism. Taxes may be collected by\r\nwidely differing methods under the two systems, but there must always\r\nbe the tax collector and the tax assessor. We can, however, see at a\r\nglance the weakness of any argument which contends that because the\r\nname and even the general duties of the tax gatherer were the same in\r\neach case, that the whole system of administration of the taxes or of\r\nthe community were necessarily identical or even closely allied in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt is here we see the weakness of those writers who insist upon the\r\ncontinuance of the Roman _curia_ in the municipalities of the Lombard\r\nkingdom. They seize upon a few names, relics of Roman rule, and from\r\nthem generalize a complete system of taxation and administration. That\r\nthe existence of any such system is alike contrary to fact and to the\r\nwhole nature of the Lombard people, any critical and impartial study\r\nof the sources of government revenues at this time will make clear. It\r\nwould be out of place to burden a paper of this character with the\r\nresults of a minute investigation into the fiscal relations of the\r\nrulers and the people when this has no immediate connection with the\r\ndevelopment of municipal government; but I will state that a careful\r\nexamination of all available sources, including documents and\r\nstatutory enactments, both public and private, reveals, to my mind, a\r\ntheory and a system of raising the revenues of the state closely\r\nallied in both principle and detail to feudal forms and feudal ideas,\r\nand having little in common save the names of a few of its officers,\r\nwith the ancient methods of collecting the taxes peculiar to the Roman\r\nmunicipal constitution.[41]\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the collectors of the revenues were called\r\n_telonarii_, or _actores, exactores_ or _actionarii_, etc., and the\r\ntaxes they collected were the usual feudal dues, fines, forfeitures,\r\ncompositions for service, etc. The nomenclature of these various\r\nofficers and of the different duties they had to levy, varying as it\r\ndid with regard to locality, and more especially with regard to\r\ntime--the Franks introducing an entirely new set of names for\r\ninstitutions often identical in character to those displaced--presents\r\nan amount of confusion which, fortunately, it is not necessary for us\r\nto endeavor to penetrate; but, having stated the foregoing general\r\nconviction with regard to the fiscal system, we will now pass on to a\r\nconsideration of some of the lesser offices held within each _civitas_\r\nby the deputies and subordinates of the _dux_. These, of course, were\r\nconnected, in degrees more or less close, with the different _curtes\r\nregiae_, and with the _placita_ held in the various _civitates_\r\ncommonly about three times in the year. Some of the officers, like the\r\n_vice-comes_ found to have existed in many localities, are simply\r\ndeputies of the _dux_, or representatives of his person, and hold\r\ntheir office simply by virtue of his will and under a somewhat\r\narbitrary tenure; others, like the gastald, the _sculdahis_, and later\r\nthe _scabinus_, represent offices which formed an integral part of the\r\nconstitution of the government, and appointment to which, whether made\r\nby the _dux_ or by the central power, involved a necessary duty of a\r\ndeterminate character. An accurate determination of the relative\r\npositions of these various minor officials, of the extent of their\r\njurisdiction and of its limitations, presents one of the most\r\ndifficult problems which the student of these dark ages of history is\r\ncalled upon to solve. The peculiar character of the sources from which\r\nwe have to derive all our information makes it quite possible for all\r\nwriters on the subject to disagree with regard to details, and leaves\r\na wide margin for discussion even on the important characteristics of\r\nthe various offices. Avoiding as much as possible the points of\r\ncontroversy, I will endeavor to give the general features of the more\r\nimportant of these offices, the conclusions given in each case\r\nresulting from an examination of the different theories held and of\r\nthe sources on which these are based.\r\n\r\nThe officer who seems to have ranked next in importance to the _dux_\r\nwithin the limits of the _civitas_ is the gastald, who goes\r\nindifferently by the name of _gastaldus, castaldius_, or _gastaldio_.\r\nHis powers were of a judicial character, and he shared with the _dux_\r\nthe title of _judex_; but whether he enjoyed the full prerogative of a\r\n_judex civitatis_, or whether his judicial functions were of a more\r\nlimited character and referred exclusively to matters of a fiscal\r\nnature belonging to the _curtis regia_ or the _camera_ of the king, is\r\na question to which the evidence to be gathered from the law codes\r\ngives no decided answer.[42] It seems probable, however, from the\r\nimportance seemingly attached to the holders of this title in the many\r\ncases in which they are mentioned in the old laws and documents, that\r\ntheir jurisdiction was of a broader character than would be implied by\r\na restriction to purely fiscal functions; in fact, that it approached\r\nmore nearly to the power of the _dux_ and _judex civitatis_, though\r\nbeing in some way of less extent or possibly supplementary to it.\r\nPerhaps the distinction would come out more clearly if we said that\r\nthe office was characterized by its relations to the fiscal functions\r\nof the state, but that its duties and privileges appear not to have\r\nbeen restricted to affairs of that nature. It is certainly true that\r\nvery many instances occur in which the duke and the gastald are\r\nalluded to, whether in laws or in contracts, in precisely the same\r\nterms and in positions which would seem to indicate an almost perfect\r\nequality of dignity. As, for example, in a meeting between Liutprand\r\nand Pope Zacharias, described by Anastasius Bibliotecharius,[43] where\r\ndukes and gastalds are together reckoned among the _judices_: here the\r\nking goes to meet the pope \"cum suis judicibus,\" and gives him as an\r\nescort \"Agripandum ducem Clusinum, nepotem suum, seu Tacipertum\r\nCastaldium et Remingum, Castaldum Tuscanensem.\" In spite of this\r\napparent equality, however, it seems to me nearer the truth to\r\nconsider the position of the gastald as an inferior one to that of the\r\n_dux_, especially in Lombard times, before that official was replaced\r\nby the _comes_ of the Carlovingians.\r\n\r\nThe important point which it is necessary to emphasize in this\r\nconnection is the fact that the gastald held his tenure, not from the\r\n_dux_ as his subordinate, but from the king in person, and for this\r\nreason can more fitly be compared with the later count than with the\r\n_dux_ of the Lombards. Consequently it is in the matter of tenure that\r\nI think is to be found the difference in power between the two\r\nofficers. In addition to his official authority, the _dux_ was\r\npossessed of a power and an influence entirely his own, derived quite\r\nas much from the number of his vassals and his position in the\r\n_civitas_ as from the grant he received from the king. At home he was\r\na powerful lord, and though he, of course, owed fealty and service to\r\nthe king, he was by no means a king's servant, like his successor the\r\nCarlovingian count. The gastald, on the other hand, was eminently a\r\nservant of the central power; and whether or not he was engaged\r\nexclusively in looking after the fiscal interests of the masters who\r\nemployed him, he had no power and no influence except such as he\r\nderived from the source of his authority. He was a king's minister and\r\nnothing more, and we can easily appreciate that the amount of power he\r\nwas enabled to exercise could never exceed the amount of influence in\r\nlocal affairs possessed at any particular time by the central\r\ngovernment, whose representative he was.\r\n\r\nBut the very nature of the source from which the power of his office\r\nis derived is what connects it vitally with the subject of our\r\nenquiry. We have seen the _dux_ as head--in the earliest times almost\r\nindependent head--of the whole _civitas_, including rural and city\r\njurisdiction. We have seen him as an official, depending from the\r\nking, it is true, and holding the king's _placita_ and executing the\r\nlaw, but also holding _placita_ of his own; appearing as a powerful\r\nlocal lord, and exercising almost arbitrary power in the regulation\r\nand the distribution of the public property of the commonwealth over\r\nwhich he ruled; in fact, a descendant of the old _duces_ of the\r\nLombard barbarian host, who, perhaps, even antedating the royal\r\noffice, held their power and their position as princes and chosen\r\nleaders of the people, rather than as appointees or dependents of any\r\nhigher authority. In the gastald, on the other hand, we have an\r\nofficial of an entirely different type--one not belonging to a\r\npowerful class of lords or leaders which traces its origin to the\r\nspontaneous choice of the people or army, but one who gets his\r\nappointment at the will and in the interests of the central\r\ngovernment, and is commissioned to exercise certain functions of the\r\nadministration as an assistant to, perhaps even as a check on, the\r\npower of the local head.\r\n\r\nSuch an official was naturally located at the place where the district\r\ncourts held their sessions, and where the fiscal duties which he\r\nespecially had in charge were most easily executed. As we have seen in\r\nthe case of the _dux_, convenience points to the _urbs_ of each\r\n_civitas_ as a natural centre, and consequently here again we find the\r\noffice of gastald as another agent in bringing the municipal division\r\ninto prominence; but doing this, we must always remember, simply from\r\nthe fact of convenience or fitness, and not in any sense as a matter\r\nof constitutional necessity. Like that of the _dux_, the jurisdiction\r\nof the gastald was exercised over the remotest farm of the _civitas_\r\nas much as over the palace in the city: _de jure_, the city gained\r\nnothing by the circumstance of its being the centre of the\r\nadministration of any office; but, _de facto_, the holding of such a\r\nposition can easily be seen to have been an important element in its\r\ngrowth and development.\r\n\r\nThis fact is even of greater importance in the case of the gastald\r\nthan in that of the _dux_, because, on account of the elimination of\r\nthe character of local ruler, which was indissolubly attached to the\r\noffice of the latter, the gastald brought local affairs into direct\r\nrelation with other parts of the social system of the kingdom,\r\nespecially connecting them with the king or centre of the whole. Such\r\na connection, as may be inferred from what has just been said, while\r\nlegally true, of course, of the whole _civitas_, had practically the\r\neffect of bringing the cities chiefly into relation with the rest of\r\nthe Lombard constitution; and, consequently, some writers point to the\r\noffice of gastald as the connecting link between municipal life and\r\nthe new state life of the Teutonic system. This statement seems to me\r\nto be true except in so far as it makes the gastald the only\r\nconnecting link. For we have already seen the _dux_ holding the same\r\nrelation, only in a less direct manner, owing to the intrusion of\r\nother interests belonging to his position; and we shall shortly have\r\nto consider the _scabinus_, another local officer, who, under\r\nCarlovingian rule, accomplished even more in this direction than the\r\ngastald. I do not wish to fail in appreciation of the important\r\ninfluence of this office in the development of the slowly growing idea\r\nof individuality in the cities of Lombardy, only to point out that it\r\nwas not the only \"connecting link\" between the municipal units and the\r\nstate as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn passing to a brief characterization of a few of the subordinate\r\nofficers, I must not omit to mention the fact that the gastald had\r\nalso certain military functions attached to his office. When called\r\nupon by the king he took command in the army, together with the minor\r\nofficers who were under him in his jurisdiction, such as the\r\n_sculdahis, saltarius_,[44] etc. We have confirmation of this in the\r\nconstitution \"promotionis exercitus\" of Lewis II.,[45] which says \"ut\r\nnullum ab expeditione aut Comes aut Gastald, vel Ministri eorum\r\nexcusatum habeant\"; and in the life of Gregory II., Anastasius\r\nBibliotecharius[46] tells that at the overthrow of the _castrum_ of\r\nCumae with the help of that pope, \"Langobardos pene trecentos cum\r\neorum Gastaldione interfecerunt.\" In military affairs the command held\r\nby the gastald seems to have been lower than that of the _dux_, the\r\nleader of all the troops furnished by the _civitas_. A right of appeal\r\nto the _dux_ existed for the _exercitalis_ who was oppressed by the\r\ngastald, as shown by the twenty-fourth law of Rhotaris,[47] which\r\nsays: \"Si Gastaldius exercitalem suum contra rationem molestaverit,\r\n_Dux_ eum soletur.\" In a case of oppression by the _dux_, the gastald,\r\non the other hand, could bring the matter before the king.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the changes introduced by the Carlovingian rule,\r\nlet us cast a hasty glance at a few of the minor officers who acted as\r\nsubordinates of the _judex_ in administering the affairs of the\r\n_civitas_. As their relations to the urban portion of the Lombard\r\nkingdom, which is the special object of our study, were either slight\r\nin themselves or else so closely connected with those of their\r\nsuperiors as not to merit any particular description, I will merely\r\nmention the names of a few of them and indicate their duties. The\r\nofficer who came next in rank to the _judex_, and who, in a\r\nsubordinate capacity, assisted him especially in administering the\r\njudicial affairs of the _civitas_, was in Lombard times called the\r\n_sculdahis_, and in Carlovingian times the _centenarius_. Under him\r\nwere the _saltarius_ and the _decanus_. The _sculdahis_ acted as a\r\nlocal officer under the _judex_, having limited judicial, police and\r\nmilitary powers. His jurisdiction was confined to the small fortified\r\ntowns and villages of the _civitas_, where he administered justice and\r\ncollected fines, forfeitures, etc., in much the same manner as did the\r\n_judex_ in the largest town of the _civitas_; his judgments, however,\r\nwere not final, but always subject to appeal to a higher authority:\r\n\"Si vero talis causa fuerit, quod ipse Sculdahis minime deliberare\r\npossit, dirigat ambas partes ad judicem suum.\"[48] There were several\r\n_sculdahis_ in one _judiciaria_, and cases were often tried before\r\nmore than one,[49] though each of the smaller local units seems to\r\nhave had such an officer. Paulus Diaconus[50] speaks of \"elector loci\r\nillius, quem sculdahis lingua propria dicunt, vir nobilis,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThese rural divisions seem sometimes to have been called _sculdascia_,\r\nfor we have a diploma of Berengar I., of the year 918, given to the\r\nmonastery of Sta. Maria dell' Organo,[51] where is mentioned \"pratum\r\njuris imperii nostri pertinens de Comitatu Veronensi, de Sculdascia\r\nvidelicet, que Fluvium dicitur\"; and in a document published by\r\nUghelli,[52] in speaking of the bishops of Belluno, \"Sculdascia\r\nBelluni\" is used. In Frankish times the _centenarius_ held the same\r\nposition as the _sculdahis_ of the Lombards: his jurisdiction was\r\nsimilarly limited to minor offences; all cases involving capital\r\npunishment, loss of liberty, or delivering of _res mancipii_, being\r\nhanded over to the count's court according to the legislation of\r\nCharlemagne.[53] The _decani_ and _saltarii_ were subordinates of the\r\n_centenarii_ and _sculdahis_. They both presided over smaller local\r\ndivisions than the _sculdascia_, and acted as deputies. In the laws of\r\nLiutprand,[54] speaking of a runaway slave, we are told that \"si in\r\nalia judiciaria inventus fuerit, tunc decanus aut saltarius, qui in\r\nloco ordinatus fuerit, comprehendere eum debeat et ad sculdahis suum\r\nperducat, et ipse sculdahis judici suo consignet.\" The _saltarius_\r\nseems to have been originally a sort of guardian of forests, \"custos\r\nsaltuum\"[55] or \"silvanus\";[56] and the name of the _decanus_, like\r\nthe Frankish _centenarius_, is a survival of the old decimal division\r\nof the army and people. These minor officers, as well as other\r\nsubalterns of the _judex_, are often met with under the common name of\r\n_actionarii_, which includes also the different sorts of _exactores_,\r\n_adores_, _advocati_, and all the lesser officials of the _fiscus_.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this investigation I have already referred to, and in\r\na certain measure characterized, the changes introduced into the\r\nLombard system of government consequent on the kingdom being absorbed\r\ninto the great empire of Charlemagne. I have said that, owing to the\r\nsimilarity of institutions between the Franks and the Lombards, the\r\nchanges made consisted rather in differences in the manner of\r\nenforcing the control of the central power than in any alteration in\r\nthe institutional life of the people, but that there were certain\r\nexceptions to this general rule, which, in their mode of operation,\r\nthough not in the intention of their author, materially affected,\r\nindeed greatly accelerated, the growth of individual life among the\r\ncities. We must now consider the nature of these exceptions.\r\n\r\nUnder the Lombard system we have seen the administrative unit of the\r\nstate to be the _civitas_, with its administrative head, the _dux_, at\r\ndifferent times enjoying a greater or less degree of independence from\r\ncontrol of the central power. We have seen the _dux_ lord as well as\r\njudge in his own jurisdiction, and standing as the successor of the\r\nmilitary leader chosen by the people, instead of holding the position\r\nof king's servant; this place being more properly filled by the\r\ngastald, who cared for the fiscal interests of the central power,\r\nwhose appointee he was. Such a form of government, it can be readily\r\nseen, left no room for any strong development of the principle of\r\ncentralization, and no scope for the exercise of any decided power or\r\neven of general supervision by the central authority. The heads of the\r\n_civitates_ were the king's _judices_, it is true, and assembled to\r\nassist him in judgments at his general _placita_ in the March of each\r\nyear; but they bear the character also of local lords of no mean\r\nimportance, and in some cases possessed of no inconsiderable amount of\r\npower. Such a degree of individual influence--perhaps I should\r\nexaggerate if I called it individual independence--was, however,\r\nlittle suited to the idea of a universal centralized empire, which was\r\nthe forming principle of the government of Charlemagne. While\r\nrecognizing the necessity of retaining the fundamental institution of\r\na division of the state into _civitates_, and of governing it by means\r\nof the heads of these divisions, he wished to eliminate from these\r\nofficers all the characteristics of local magnates, and to reduce them\r\nto the more easily controlled position of servants, and dependents of\r\nthe king. This object he accomplished most satisfactorily by changing\r\nthe dukes or local lords into counts or king's men, by appointing a\r\nCount of the Palace for Italy, and by extending to that kingdom the\r\nperfectly organized system of central control by means of the _Missi\r\nDominici_, with the workings of which in the other parts of his great\r\nempire the student of history is too well acquainted to need any\r\ndescription here.\r\n\r\nThe immediate changes in the life of the people consequent on the\r\nintroduction of this system were not considerable, if we except a\r\ngreat improvement in public order and a marked advance in the\r\nequitable administration of justice; but it needs no great foresight\r\nto see that the ultimate effects on the position held by the municipal\r\nunits in the community could not fail to be important and\r\nfar-reaching. The new officer, the count, stripped of all the\r\nimportance that his predecessor, the duke, had enjoyed as lord of the\r\ncountry over which he ruled, was placed in each city to govern, in the\r\nking's name, it and its _territorium_. As long as the empire of\r\nCharlemagne retained its integrity, and as long as the reins of\r\ncentral government were held by a strong hand and the control it\r\nexercised was felt to be positive and real, the change in the\r\ncharacter of the local governor was of little moment; but as soon as\r\nthe power of the central government weakened--during the inglorious\r\nreigns of the immediate successors of the great emperor--its hold on\r\nthe administration of the local units slackened immediately; and in\r\nproportion as the vitality of the new central control diminishes, we\r\nsee appearing the effects which must always result when the strong\r\nhand of an active central power is removed from a system of\r\nadministration which had been based on the exercise of such a power.\r\nThese effects are the increased importance--I may now say the\r\nincreased independence--of the local units; of these local units\r\nthemselves as distinguished from the heads who rule over them.\r\n\r\nThe change had made these units more organic parts of the state than\r\nthey had ever been before: we have seen them first made prominent by\r\nbeing the seats of the rulers of the _civitas_, and now we are to see\r\nthem gain a more significant advance by coming into relation with the\r\nhead of the state directly, instead of through the personal power of\r\ntheir lord. For the local ruler has yielded his individual\r\npre-eminence to the central government; and when this fails to\r\nmaintain its authority, in any community whose inhabitants are capable\r\nof fostering the seeds of independence once sown, it is difficult if\r\nnot impossible for a successor to repossess himself of the privileges\r\nwhich have been forfeited. In any state where the seat of central\r\nauthority is distant or its power only exercised feebly and at\r\nintervals, the local units secure much greater independence and\r\nimportance, through the very necessity of performing many functions\r\nleft unheeded by the ruler of all; and if the people are self-reliant\r\nin character, they will in time develop a sort of self-government\r\nwhich, although it would not at first think of questioning the\r\ntheoretical right and overlordship of the central power, will\r\neventually brook but little interference with its modes of procedure\r\nand with its exercise of functions, which the lapse of time has\r\ntransformed from enforced duties into jealously guarded privileges.\r\n\r\nThis is the keynote of the later history of the Italian cities. This\r\nit was, and not any real lack of patriotism, which made them choose a\r\nGerman emperor instead of an Italian king. There was no room at that\r\ntime for the idea of Italian unity, as we now understand it: the\r\nnature of the people alone would have rendered such a thing\r\nimpossible, even if we leave out of account the fact that Italy was\r\nthe meeting-ground of the two great powers of the mediaeval world, the\r\nPope and the Emperor. Italy then must have had two masters, or have\r\nbeen the slave of one. The same spirit of civic independence which\r\ncaused the development of Ancient Greece by preventing the universal\r\nrule of one power, caused the Italians, under different conditions, to\r\npit one master against another to attain the same end. Even Liutprand,\r\nthe old historian of the tenth century, recognized this. In the first\r\nbook of his \"Historia\" he says: \"The Italians wish always to serve two\r\nmasters, in order to restrain one by means of the terror with which\r\nthe other inspires him.\"[57] By means of holding in their hands the\r\nbalance of power they hoped to rule their rulers; and to attain this\r\nobject was the only reason which ever prompted the cities to unite\r\nwith any degree of harmony. Local independence was what they aimed at,\r\nand their shrewdness showed them the only possible means in that age\r\nof securing it.\r\n\r\nThese results could hardly have been attained if society had remained\r\nsuch that the prominence of the local divisions was dependent on the\r\nprominence of the respective heads of these divisions; but the\r\ncharacter of their local rulers once changed, and their powers in a\r\ngreat measure absorbed by the act of a strong central power, when that\r\npower fell to pieces it was much easier for the local divisions, as\r\nsuch, to increase their independence, and to utilize the advance they\r\nhad made, by means of their more direct relation to the central power,\r\nto gain a position which they would enjoy in spite of the efforts\r\nalike of that power and of their old rulers. Such a position would not\r\nbe reached except by means of great struggles and by passing through a\r\nperiod of great disintegration and of fierce internal strife between\r\nopposing factions, such as in the history of the Italian communes is\r\nrepresented by the dark period between the fall of the last of the\r\nCarlovingians and the election of the first German emperor as king of\r\nItaly; but once attained, the character of the people who accomplished\r\nit would ensure its permanence, as long as they retained those\r\nprinciples of independence which had made them victorious in the\r\nstruggle. After this short discussion, in which we have traced the\r\nultimate effects of the action of Charlemagne in changing the dukes\r\ninto counts, let us look at another feature in the field of city\r\ngovernment introduced by him, the new office of the _scabinus_ or city\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of judicial procedure among the Teutonic\r\nnations, judgment in criminal cases was given in the open court or\r\n_placitum_, where, besides the regular judges, all or any of the\r\nfreemen within its jurisdiction were supposed to concur in the\r\njudgment and sentence. How far this method of arriving at judicial\r\ndecisions was carried out in practice depended largely on custom and\r\nother local influences, and consequently varied greatly in different\r\ncountries and with different nations. I do not propose to enter into\r\nthe discussion[58] of the existence of these \"judicators\"[59] in\r\nLombardy in the eighth century, but will only say that it is certain\r\nthat before the Frankish conquest there did not exist a class of men\r\nwhose business it was to assist the judge in disposing of cases. If\r\nthrough ignorance of the law or for other reasons he was unable to\r\ncome to a decision, \"si vero talis causa fuit, quod ipse ...\r\ndeliberare minime possit,\"[60] he could call some of the freemen to\r\nassist him: \"advocis [advocet] alios ... qui sciunt judicare,\"[61]\r\netc., but this seems, in later times at any rate, to have been a\r\nprivilege to be used at discretion, and the persons summoned were not\r\nregularly appointed officers of the court. The Lombard codes are\r\nsilent with regard to these indicators; but Savigny,[62] in his\r\nargument to prove their existence, claims that mention is made of them\r\nin two decisions of Liutprand of the years 715 and 716, and brings as\r\nadditional evidence a _placitum_ of 751[63] in which Lupo, duke of\r\nSpoleto, gives judgment \"una cum judicibus nostris ... vel aliis\r\npluribus astantibus,\" etc. It is of more importance for us, however,\r\nto determine the reasons for the introduction into Italy by\r\nCharlemagne of the new office of the _scabinus_, than to lose\r\nourselves in a complicated discussion of the theoretical predecessors\r\nof these officers.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this new feature into city government seems to\r\nhave been the result of an attempt to correct certain abuses in the\r\nexercise of power by the duke or head of the courts of the _civitas_.\r\nThe duke had the right, as we know, to summon all the freemen in his\r\njurisdiction to his _placita_, and to fine them according to the law\r\nif they failed to answer his summons. The fines collected in this\r\nmanner formed a substantial part of the revenues of the _judex_\r\nimposing them, and consequently arose the abuse, which seems to have\r\nbeen a great cause of complaint in the eighth century, that the\r\nfreemen were summoned to attend _placita_ at frequent intervals during\r\nthe year, when there was no business of any importance to transact,\r\nand when the sole object of the summons was to furnish an excuse for\r\nimposing the fine. An attempt to remedy this injustice was made when\r\nthe number of _placita_ which any one _judex_ could hold during the\r\nyear was limited by law to three,[64] and the dates for these\r\ndefinitely determined. But the abuse does not seem to have been\r\nsatisfactorily corrected till the time when Charlemagne formally\r\nsubstituted for the body of the freemen, who in theory were supposed\r\nto attend the _placita_ and assist in the judgments, a limited number\r\nof men who, as regularly constituted judges, either assisted the\r\n_judices_ or made judgments of their own, as the case might be. These\r\nofficers were the _scabini_, whose position we are now investigating.\r\n\r\nAll of the best authorities agree that no authentic allusion to the\r\noffice in Italy is to be found prior to the establishment of Frankish\r\nrule. The word _scavinus_ or _scabinus_ sometimes occurs, but in every\r\ncase the document containing it has been proved spurious on other\r\ngrounds. For instance, Brunetti[65] publishes a donation of the bishop\r\nSpeciosus of Florence, to the monastery of the cathedral, purporting\r\nto belong to the year 724, in which a certain \"Alfuso scavino\" is\r\nmentioned; but it has been proved that the monastery was only founded\r\nin the year 760, and though it may, at a later date, have received the\r\ndonation, the significancy of the use of the term vanishes. The first\r\nauthenticated use of the name of the new judge seems to be in a\r\n_placitum_ of Charlemagne of the year 781.[66] In this the parties to\r\na suit are mentioned as having already appeared before the \"Comitem et\r\nsuos Escapinios.\" Eight years later, in a _Praeceptum_ of\r\nCharlemagne,[67] commission is given to the _comes_ Tentmann \"superque\r\nvicarios et Scabinos, quos sub se habet, diligenter inquirat.\"\r\n\r\nNow that we have indicated the origin and noted the first appearance\r\nof the new officer, let us examine his position and his duties. I am\r\nmuch more willing to allow to the _scabinus_ the title of \"city\r\nofficer,\" than to the _dux_ or even the count. We have seen the latter\r\nas one of the important connecting links joining the city to the\r\nstate, bringing the city into relationship with the constitution of\r\nthe kingdom and making it a part of it; but we have been unwilling to\r\ncall the count or _dux_ the _legal_ head of the city, as such, that is\r\nto allow him the title of the first city officer. But with the\r\n_scabinus_ the case is different. His mode of appointment, and the\r\ncharacter of the functions he performed, ally him with the city proper\r\nand with city people. His duties and his interests were more confined\r\nto the city than those of any of the other judges, and when he\r\naccompanies the count to the general _placita_ of the king, he seems\r\nto go in the capacity of a representative of the city, and more in the\r\ncharacter of a city magistrate than any officer we have yet\r\nconsidered. His duties were almost entirely of a judicial character,\r\nand his powers seem to have been as broad in their extent as those of\r\nthe other judges. That he had the power of imposing capital\r\npunishment, and that the other officers of the law could not change\r\nbut only execute his orders, appears from the following passage:[68]\r\n\"postquam Scabini eum [latronem] adjudicaverint, non est licentia vel\r\nVicarii ei vitam concedere.\" Muratori[69] maintains that he also had\r\nthe right of holding certain _placita_ of his own, and cites in proof\r\ntwo _placita_ of Lucca of the years 847 and 856, where we find: \"Dum\r\nnos in Dei nomine Ardo, Adelperto et Gherimundo Scabini adsedentes in\r\nlucho Civitate Lucana,\" etc.; and \"dum resedisset Gisulfus Scabinus de\r\nVico Laceses, per jussionem Bernardi Comiti ... ubi cum ipso aderat\r\nAusprand et Audibert Scavinis.\" In the first of these there is no\r\nmention whatever of the count, and in the second \"Gisulfus Scabinus\"\r\nacts with his associate _scabini_ \"per jussionem Comiti.\" But even if\r\nwe allow to the _scabini_ the right of holding _placita_, these must\r\nhave been of a lower grade than those of the counts or of the _missi\r\nregii_; for to the _mallum_ of the latter an appeal was allowed from\r\nthe judgment of the _scabini_, as we see from the law of\r\nCharlemagne,[70] which says that: \"Si quis caussam judicatam repetere\r\nin mallo praesumserit ... a Scabinis, qui caussam ipsam prius\r\njudicaverint, accipiat.\" Generally speaking, however, it seems\r\nprobable that their jurisdiction included all cases arising within the\r\ncity limits, which could be dealt with in the regular _placita_ of the\r\ncounts, and which were not of sufficient importance to be referred to\r\nthe king in person, his representative the Count of the Palace, or his\r\ndelegates the _missi regii_.\r\n\r\nWhen the count went up to the general yearly _placitum_ of the king,\r\nas the representative of the _civitas_, according to the laws of\r\nCharlemagne he was to be accompanied by a certain number of the\r\n_scabini_; and these seem to have accompanied him not solely in the\r\ncharacter of legal advisers, but also in a certain measure as\r\nrepresentatives of the cities in which lay their jurisdiction: they\r\nare by no means what the exaggeration of Sismondi[71] calls \"des\r\nmagistrats populaires ... qui representaient la bourgeoisie\"; but they\r\ncertainly stood for the interests of the people, in a greater degree\r\nthan any of the ruling powers we have as yet considered. Their number\r\nis variously stated in the laws of different kings, and their actual\r\nnumber seems seldom to have come up to the standard of legal\r\nrequirement. Lewis the Pious requires twelve to accompany each count\r\nwhen summoned by the emperor: \"veniat unusquisque Comes et adducat\r\nsecum duodecim Scabinos\";[72] but concedes that if so many could not\r\nbe found in the city, their number should be filled out from the best\r\ncitizens of the town: \"de melioribus hominibus illius civitatis\r\nsuppleat numerum duodenarium.\"[73] According to Charlemagne,[74] no\r\none should come with the count to a king's _placitum_ unless he had a\r\ncase to present, \"qui causam suam quaerit, exceptis scabinis septem,\r\nqui ad omnia Placita esse debent.\" And again: \"Ut nullus ad placitum\r\nbanniatur ... exceptis scabineis septem, qui ad omnia Placita praeesse\r\ndebent\";[75] and seven seems to have been the usual number expected,\r\nand their attendance was compulsory; though sometimes only two appear,\r\nand in a few cases none at all.\r\n\r\nOf all matters relating to this office, the one which is of most\r\ninterest to us, and the one which most clearly shows the difference\r\nwhich was designed to exist between it and that of the other judges,\r\nwas the manner in which the office was obtained. In this procedure we\r\ncan trace almost distinctly that the object of the central power which\r\nestablished it was to secure greater justice and greater freedom to\r\nthe subjects who came under its jurisdiction. The fact was recognized\r\nby the new government that the power of the local heads was too great\r\nto suit the principle of universal central control, which was the\r\nkeynote of Charlemagne's system of administration, and was exercised\r\nin too arbitrary a manner; and that some check was necessary to curb\r\nthe spirit and limit the independence of these local lords of the soil\r\nand the city who had little consideration for their inferiors, and who\r\nmight at any time become a source of danger to their superiors. Such a\r\ncheck was found, in regard to the central authority, in the _missi\r\nregii_, and in reference to the general public, in the _scabini_ or\r\ncity judges.\r\n\r\nIn the old Lombard constitution we have seen the gastald, chiefly,\r\nhowever, in the matter of judicial decisions, exercise a controlling\r\ninfluence on the arbitrary action of the duke; but as the power of the\r\ncount varied from that of the duke, so that of the _scabinus_ differs\r\nfrom that of the gastald, only perhaps in a greater degree. At the\r\ntime when the count assumes the place of his predecessor the duke, the\r\n_scabinus_ displaces the gastald, although he cannot be said to have\r\nassumed exactly the same position as the latter, nor to have filled it\r\nin precisely the same way. The _scabinus_ did not have, of course, any\r\ndirect limiting control over the actions of the count; for any such\r\npower in the hands of a body of lesser officers would have been alike\r\ncontrary to the spirit of feudalism which characterized the age, and\r\nimpossible to its forms; but being the principal judicial\r\nfunctionaries of the district, into their hands fell most of the cases\r\nwhich formerly went to the _placita_ of the count; and while the wish\r\nof the great emperor, that even the meanest subject of the realm\r\nshould receive impartial justice at their hands, might have failed in\r\nits effect, its fulfilment was made more sure by the method prescribed\r\nfor the election of the officers whose duty it was to execute it.[76]\r\n\r\nIn describing the method by which the _scabini_ gained their office, I\r\nam in some doubt as to the proper terms to be employed. I have just\r\nmade use of the word \"election,\" but cannot let it stand without some\r\nqualification. It was not an election in the strict sense of the word\r\nas we now understand it, but it was as near an approach to a popular\r\nchoice as was possible in the age in which it existed. The citizens of\r\na municipality did not nominate and elect by their votes a popular\r\nmagistrate, as some writers would have us believe; for such a\r\nproceeding would have been an anomaly in the eighth century under the\r\nrule of a Frankish emperor. But the people had a voice, and from the\r\nfrequent mention of their intervention it would seem an important\r\nvoice, in the selection of those who were to be their judges, and who\r\nwere to assist in representing them in the royal assembly. The\r\noriginal appointments were made by some higher power, in most cases\r\nthe _missi regii_, the direct representatives of the king; but these\r\nwere made not arbitrarily, but always \"cum totius populi consensu.\"\r\nThis was the important point; it was so far a popular office that the\r\nfree consent of the people was always necessary to make valid the\r\nappointment of any incumbent. According to the ideas and customs of\r\nthe eighth century, such a method of procedure would represent a\r\nfairly popular election; for we know well that in the times of the\r\ngreatest freedom, the Teutonic idea of a popular vote never went\r\nbeyond the mere expression of assent or dissent by the assembled\r\nfreemen. The initiative was always left to the king or chief who\r\nconducted the meeting, just as much as it was in the ancient assembly\r\nheld on the classic plains of Troy. In a capitulary[77] of Charlemagne\r\nof the year 809 it is decreed: \"ut Scabini boni et veraces cum Comite\r\net populo elegantur et constituantur\": and more specific directions\r\nare given by Lothar I. in the year 873, in case of a _scabinus_ found\r\nto be an unjust judge. He says:[78] \"ut Missi Nostri ubicumque malos\r\nscabinos invenerint ejiciant, et totius populi consensu in loco eorum\r\nbonos eligant.\" From this latter example we see that the _missi_ had\r\nthe power of dismissal \"for cause,\" as well as of nomination. In fact,\r\nthe king and his ministers, in the interests of impartial justice,\r\nkept constant watch on the acts and judgments of the _scabini_, and a\r\nlaw of Lothar I. tells us that \"quicumque de Scabinis deprehensus\r\nfuerit propter munera, aut propter amicitam injuste judicare\" should\r\nbe sent up to the king to render an account of the manner in which he\r\nhad fulfilled the duties of his office.\r\n\r\nSuch then were the duties, the privileges and the restrictions of the\r\nfirst magistrate to whom we could venture to ascribe any of the\r\nattributes of a popular judge: a representative of the people at the\r\nassembly of their ruler; a judge of their suits and of their misdoings\r\nat home, and a check on the arbitrary power of their lord and feudal\r\nsuperior,--we can readily appreciate that the existence of such an\r\nofficer within the city must have exercised some influence in giving\r\nto its inhabitants a greater sense of security, and consequently of\r\nimportance, even if we cannot claim that in the earliest stages of\r\nmunicipal development it gave birth to any definite ideas of personal\r\nfreedom or of municipal independence. But it can easily be seen that\r\nit formed another and an important factor in that idea whose progress\r\nwe wish to trace, of a slowly growing feeling of individuality in the\r\ncity as such, the municipal unit as conceived apart from the still\r\nlegally recognized unit, the entire _civitas_. We have seen the count\r\nthe representative of this idea as far as its actual connection with\r\nthe constitution of the state was concerned, but it was the _scabinus_\r\nwho was to represent it to the consciousness of the people, and to\r\nassist them in rediscovering the lost conception of a municipal unity.\r\n\r\nIt would be incomplete to conclude this account of the various\r\nofficers of government, without some mention of the position held by\r\nthe bishops at this period. As it has been our duty throughout this\r\npaper to study the municipalities of Italy as only preparing to assume\r\na position of individuality eventually leading to independence, so it\r\nis with regard to the bishops. While their social influence, as\r\npointed out in the first part of this paper, was always notable, their\r\npolitical power, which formed one of the important steps in the\r\nprogress of the communes towards a separate existence, has its birth\r\nat a time which is beyond the limits of this investigation. Not until\r\nthe overthrow of the Carlovingian dynasty left Italy the prey of\r\ncontending factions, and the crown passing quickly from hand to hand\r\nmade each applicant anxious to gain the support of the more prominent\r\nelectors, did the bishops obtain that legally constituted political\r\npower which, by breaking up and in many cases destroying the rule of\r\nthe counts and great nobles in the cities, was the means of bridging\r\nover the wide gulf which lay between the idea of a district under the\r\nalmost absolute rule of a great lord, and a civic autonomy governed by\r\nits own independent citizens. Even, however, if we are not yet to\r\nportray the bishop in a position of high political importance, we may\r\nbriefly consider his social power and influence, and, as we have done\r\nwith the cities themselves, indicate the steps by which he was enabled\r\nultimately to gain such an exalted position.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the bishop to the inhabitants of the cities during\r\nthe period we are considering were pretty nearly such as described in\r\nthe first part of this paper. He stood forth as protector of the weak\r\nand the oppressed; as mediator between an unfortunate prisoner and an\r\nunjust judge who was seeking his private interest rather than\r\nfollowing the spirit of impartial justice; or between a downtrodden\r\nvassal and the almost unlimited power of his feudal superior. He\r\nlessened the severity of harsh judgments, he protested the imposition\r\nof unjust fines and penalties. In very many cases he was even\r\nappointed by the king or his representatives as co-judge to assist the\r\n_judex_ or the _missus_ in hearing cases where oppression or injustice\r\nwas to be feared. But it is important for us to avoid confusing this\r\nkind of jurisdiction with that which he enjoyed in the century after\r\nhe had attained the power and the office of count, and had combined\r\nthe religious functions of head of the diocese with the secular ones\r\nof political ruler of the city. Any judicial authority possessed by\r\nthe bishop at this earlier period was not in virtue of any political\r\nposition he himself held, but came to him entirely in what might be\r\ncalled an extraordinary manner, that is, by delegation from the king,\r\nfor definite specified occasions. As an example of this extraordinary\r\ndelegated jurisdiction, I will refer to a document in the Archivio of\r\nthe Canons of Arezzo[79] of the year 833, relating to the judgment of\r\na dispute between \"Petrum Episcopum Arretinum et Vigilium Abatem\r\nMonasterii Sancti Antemi,\" situated in the territory of Chiusi, over a\r\nprivilege ceded to that monastery by Lewis the Pious in 813.[80] The\r\nbishop of Arezzo gained a favorable decision from a court constituted\r\nof some _judices_, _missi_ of the emperor, and of the bishops of\r\nFlorence, Volterra and Siena, Agiprandus, Petrus and Anastasius.\r\nAccording to the terms of the document with regard to the composition\r\nof this court, the bishops sitting in it were \"directi a Hlotario\r\nmagno Imperatore\"; and their powers are several times referred to as\r\nbeing \"juxta jussionem et Indiculum Domni Imperatoris.\" Here, as in\r\nall other similar cases, we see plainly that there is no indication of\r\nany purely personal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThat the influence of the bishop in affairs of state at this period\r\nwas only of an individual, extra-official character can be seen also\r\nfrom the fact that the king considered the bishops themselves to be\r\nunder his judicial jurisdiction in all secular matters, just as the\r\nlesser clergy came under the jurisdiction of the _judices_:[81] and\r\nfurther, that after the election to a church, the decision of the\r\n_judex_ must confirm the choice of the community in order to render it\r\nvalid.[82] All disputes also between bishops and their clergy, between\r\nmembers of the body of clergy, and between these and members of the\r\nlaity, were settled by the royal authority;[83] and what is most\r\nsignificant, there was a universal and freely used right of appeal for\r\nthe clergy or laity from the decision of a bishop to the person of the\r\nking, who seems to have exhibited no hesitation in modifying or\r\nreversing sentences, even in matters relating to purely clerical\r\ndiscipline.[84]\r\n\r\nEven in the time of the Franks, when the consideration shown to the\r\nchurch and its representatives was much greater than under any of the\r\nLombard kings, we find Charlemagne,[85] on suspicion of infidelity to\r\nhis government, having sent to him and retaining as prisoners the\r\nbishops \"Civitatis Pisanae seu Lencanae\" and Pottoni, Abbot of the\r\nmonastery of Volturno; and Lewis the Pious[86] sends into exile\r\n\"Ermoldo Nigello Abatis,\" and in the year 818 several other bishops,\r\nincluding Anselmus \"Mediolanensis Archiepiscopus,\" \"Wolfoldus\r\nCremonensis\" and \"Theodolphus Amelianensis.\"[87] None of these\r\nrestrictions and limitations, however, although they arose chiefly\r\nfrom the strong opposition always existing between the local temporal\r\nrulers of the people and their spiritual rulers, could hinder the\r\nbishops from occupying that important position of mediators and of\r\nprotectors of the people which we have ascribed to them.\r\n\r\nTurning now to a consideration of the earliest steps which may be said\r\nto have cleared the way for the political power of the bishops, we are\r\nmet by a subject which, though of great interest in itself, is not\r\nsufficiently a part of this investigation for us to do more than\r\nindicate the lines of its progress. This subject is the development of\r\nthe practice of giving certain immunities and privileges to churches\r\nand monasteries, adopted by the Frankish kings, faithful sons of the\r\nchurch, and then followed by all their royal and imperial successors.\r\nIn considering the important influence exercised by these immunities\r\non the development of the espiscopal power and the effects of this on\r\nthe growth of the communes, there are two essential facts which we\r\nmust always keep prominently in mind. In the first place we must\r\nremember that the granting of immunities was a question of privilege\r\nto particular individuals or ecclesiastical institutions, and not a\r\nuniversal grant which affected in an equal degree all the dioceses of\r\nthe realm. This led to the marked differences in rank and importance\r\nwhich existed between the various bishoprics, and in the tenth\r\ncentury, when the temporal power became in many cases an adjunct to\r\nthe spiritual, caused some bishops to become powerful temporal\r\nprinces, while others, unable to gain this pre-eminence, remained\r\nsimply spiritual heads of their respective dioceses. So in the contest\r\nbetween the counts and the bishops we find the latter only victorious\r\nin certain cases, and consequently having only certain of the cities\r\nunder their jurisdiction; a fact which is illustrated as late as the\r\nPeace of Constance, where in the ninth article the cities are still\r\ndivided into episcopal and non-episcopal cities.[88] In the second\r\nplace we must keep clearly before us an important fact, the truth of\r\nwhich any chronological account of the development of the principle of\r\nimmunity would easily demonstrate, namely, that with the advance of\r\ntime and with the growth of that principle, the changes which took\r\nplace in the different sorts of immunities were not simply those of\r\ndegree, but essentially and principally those of _kind_.\r\n\r\nA descendant of Charlemagne may have granted to some monastery or\r\nbishopric a greater alleviation of some of the fiscal burdens borne by\r\nit under his immediate predecessor, but a successor of Berenger when\r\nhe granted a _privilegium_ did not simply perform the negative benefit\r\nof alleviating burdens; he endowed the head of the bishopric--probably\r\nin return for some service he had received at his hands or expected to\r\nreceive--with the positive benefit of the political headship and\r\npossession of some city or district of a former count. I mean by this\r\nthat the earlier immunities--and in these are included all given\r\nduring the period we are discussing--were all of them what are termed\r\nsimple or ordinary immunities; that is, those which deal with\r\nexemption--whether from burdens for which the receivers would\r\notherwise be liable, or from jurisdiction to which they would\r\notherwise have been subjected--of what may properly be called the\r\nprivate possessions of the churches concerned. They had nothing to do\r\nwith the privileges of a later time, by which a power to exact burdens\r\nwas granted and a positive jurisdiction over others allowed: that is,\r\npublic functions bestowed rather than private rights conceded.\r\n\r\nThat a distinction of such a character was a difference of kind and\r\nnot of degree is so plainly apparent that it is unnecessary to dwell\r\nlonger upon it, and it only remains for us to consider briefly the\r\nchronology of some of the changes that took place. If we adhere\r\nstrictly to the proper signification of the terms used, the\r\ndevelopment can be somewhat succinctly described by the simple\r\nenumeration of the three characteristic features of its progress, viz.\r\n_protection, exemption, privilege_ that is jurisdiction or temporal\r\npower; and the three periods which are covered respectively by the\r\nprominence of these ideas can be roughly stated to be: for the first,\r\nthe reigns of Charlemagne and his successors down to the time of\r\nCharles the Bald--including any indication of this idea which we may\r\nfind during the reigns of the last rulers of the first Lombard\r\nkingdom; for the second, the reigns of Charles the Bald, Karloman, and\r\nCharles the Fat; and for the third, the full development of the\r\nepiscopal power in the tenth century, down to the period of its final\r\ndecline, and the rise of actual municipal government within the\r\ncommunes.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether immunities of any importance were granted even\r\nby the latest kings of the Lombards, before the invasion of the\r\nFranks. Under the first Lombard monarchy the church held a very\r\nsubordinate position with regard to the state, and if privileges were\r\ngranted to any of its members, they had attached to them no greater\r\nmeaning than the simple extension to them of the _mundibrium_ of the\r\nking, such as was often allowed to private individuals; that is, they\r\nwere simply grants of royal protection, and were not similar to the\r\nlater grants which included both protection and privilege.[89]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Frankish rule under Charlemagne, marked\r\nconsideration immediately appears for the church and its\r\nrepresentatives. Not alone is ample protection granted to many of the\r\nchurches of the kingdom, but to it is added the important function of\r\nexemption. The greatest evil endured in those days by the\r\necclesiastical authorities was exactions levied on their property and\r\noppression exercised on their dependents by the dukes and counts under\r\nwhose jurisdiction lay the temporal possessions of the churches and\r\nmonasteries. Consequently the aim of every bishop and of every abbot\r\nwas to obtain for the possessions of his diocese or his convent an\r\nexemption more or less complete from the civil administration of the\r\nneighboring secular ruler. For a long time there was no thought in the\r\nmind of the bishop of gaining for himself the functions of temporal\r\njurisdiction, but simply that the power of the count should be\r\nrestrained with regard to church property, that is, that he should not\r\nbe able to exercise his judicial control over lands belonging to the\r\nchurch, except by the express permission, \"per licentia data,\" and\r\nwith the concurrence of the bishop himself. This and nothing more is\r\nwhat is meant by all of the charters of exemption granted by the\r\nCarlovingian rulers, down to the time of Charles the Bald, when, as we\r\nshall presently see, a change was introduced.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless for me to cite examples of such charters, for\r\ntheir number is countless, and reference may be made to any of the\r\ngreat collections of mediaeval documents for confirmation of what has\r\njust been said; for during the reigns of the earlier Carlovingians,\r\nthe strong reverence for the church and respect for its officers which\r\ncharacterized the Frankish nation from the beginning led to the\r\nextension of these privileges to much the greater number of the\r\nchurches in the realm. Not all churches enjoyed such grants, and not\r\nall those accorded were of the same liberal character, but the number\r\ngiven and the amount of liberty to the church thereby bestowed was\r\nsufficient to give to the clergy that degree of importance which\r\nultimately culminated in making them the great lords that we find them\r\nin the tenth century. To give an idea of the tenor of these documents,\r\nI will, however, quote a few lines from the earliest one that has come\r\nunder my notice in Carlovingian times, namely a diploma of the year\r\n782, issued to Geminiano II., bishop of Modena, and preserved in the\r\narchives of that city. Here we find that: \"Nullus judex publicus ad\r\ncausas audiendum, vel freda exigendum, seu mansiones aut paratas\r\nfaciendum, nec fidejussiones tollendum neque hominibus ipsius\r\nepiscopatus distringendum,\" etc. This is sufficient to show the\r\ncharacter of exemption from secular jurisdiction.[90]\r\n\r\nThe next forward step in the advance of the bishops to temporal power\r\nwas made probably about the time of Charles the Bald; though under his\r\ntwo immediate predecessors, Lothaire[91] and Lewis II.,[92] we already\r\nsee indications of an extension of the quality of exemption to include\r\nfreedom from the payment of all public dues and the bearing of all\r\npublic burdens.[93] It was precisely the introduction of this element\r\nof exemption from public burdens which marked the change in the nature\r\nof the immunities granted from the time of Charles the Bald, down to\r\nthe period when the element of jurisdiction and real temporal power\r\nwas introduced under Guido and Berenger. Up to this time, the grounds\r\non which similar charters had been sought had been protection from the\r\noppression of the counts, and had resulted, as we have seen, in the\r\ngranting of simple charters of protection which were of no very great\r\nsignificance. But now it is exemption from public burdens, etc., that\r\nis made prominent, in addition to a complete severance from all\r\njurisdiction and control of the secular power of the _civitas_ in\r\nwhich the bishop's see and domains are situated. That this concession\r\nalso was sought by the bishop on the plea of protection for his\r\ndependents from oppression and exaction, does not diminish its\r\nimportance; for it is easy to see that the line which separates\r\nrecognized right of protection from recognized right of jurisdiction\r\nis one easily effaced, and defense from the tyranny of a foreign power\r\ncan with little difficulty be transformed into domination by the\r\nprofessed defender.\r\n\r\nThat this was the order of development consequent on these changes is\r\nproved by the temporal dominion gained by the bishops in the next\r\ncentury; and the steps of its growth marked by numerous immunities\r\ngranted by Charles the Bald, Karloman[94] his successor, and Charles\r\nthe Fat, the last of the Carlovingians in Italy. As a good example of\r\nthe complete development of this advance gained by the bishops, I will\r\nmention a charter given by Charles the Fat to John, bishop of Arezzo,\r\nin the year 879, in which he confirms to him all the property and the\r\nrights of that see, and takes him under his protection, \"sub\r\nimmunitatis suae defensione\": he then goes on to explain what this\r\nterm meant, giving a full account of the extent to which a bishop's\r\nproperty was exempted from the jurisdiction of the _judex publicus_,\r\nand protected from the imposition of burdens and exactions.[95]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the growth of the episcopal power, and the most\r\nimportant of all, is the progress from exemption to privilege, to\r\njurisdiction; and occurs after the return of the kingship of Italy to\r\nthe hands of native kings.[96] It means the full development of the\r\nbishop into the temporal ruler, and as such belongs properly to the\r\nhistory of the tenth century, and consequently is beyond the limits of\r\nthe present paper.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered individually and separately, in the course of\r\ntheir development, the different elements which, when combined and\r\nmodified by the various changes described, contributed to form the\r\nsolid foundation upon which the fabric of the future independent life\r\nof the cities was to be built. We have been dealing exclusively with\r\ninstitutions, and the manner in which their growth has been\r\naccomplished. For it is in the institutional life of a people, and in\r\nthe change and development it undergoes, that are to be found those\r\nelements which form the basis for all future changes, whether simply\r\nin the form of its government or in the structure of its social\r\nsystem. If once a clear picture is gained of the structural parts\r\nwhich form the institutional framework of any particular development,\r\nand a truthful presentation of these forming principles is proved and\r\nestablished, a detailed account of the material expression of them is\r\na matter of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nI have not, in this paper, attempted to describe the actual condition\r\nof any particular municipality, or even presented a picture which\r\ncould represent the material existence of the cities as a whole. Such\r\na picture would only be a necessary part of a study of institutions\r\nwhen the city itself was the unit to be investigated, and not of one\r\nwhose chief object is to prove that the city as such had no\r\nconstitutional existence, but simply formed a part of another\r\ninstitutional unit. When we reach a period in which the city stands\r\nout as an object of study in itself, and when we do not have to trace\r\nits history only by learning that of other institutions which included\r\nand overshadowed it, then the practical life of the people within its\r\nwalls becomes of the greatest importance, even to the smallest detail\r\nof civic law or city custom; and then, and not till then, begins what\r\ncould properly be called a study of municipal institutions.\r\n\r\nDuring the three centuries that we have been investigating, the study\r\nof the Italian municipalities has been, as we have seen, but the study\r\nof other institutions of which the municipality formed only a part. No\r\nattempt has been made to do more than prove the origin and trace the\r\nearliest development of those principles, which in their maturity were\r\nto gain for the municipal unit that position where the study of its\r\nown structure would become an object of interest, entirely apart and\r\ndistinct from any of its surroundings. It has been shown that the city\r\ndid not inherit any such position from its immediate predecessor the\r\nRoman _municipium_, which we have learnt to consider as overthrown,\r\nfrom a constitutional standpoint as annihilated; but that the new\r\nprinciple introduced into state life by the northern conquerors of\r\nItaly, the principle of administration by county rather than by urban\r\ndivisions, relegated the city to an inferior place as part of a rural\r\nholding, instead of leaving it the centre of a circle of rural\r\ndependencies. Having demonstrated the absence of all constitutional\r\nrecognition of the municipal unit as such, I have attempted to show\r\nhow a condition of such legal insignificance became generally a\r\ncondition of actual importance; how from a position of such negative\r\ninterest, the advance of the city was commenced along a road which was\r\nultimately to restore it its old pre-eminence, even adding to this in\r\ntime the almost forgotten attribute of sovereignty. The motives for\r\nthis advance we have seen to be no higher ones than convenience and\r\nexpediency, which made the _urbs_ of every _civitas_ the natural\r\ncentre of its local administration, thereby in fact, if in no way by\r\nlaw, restoring to it some of the elements of individuality, if not of\r\npre-eminence, which it had lost. The means employed we have seen to be\r\nthe functions of the various officers of state: the _dux_, the count\r\nand the gastald, who connected the city with the state, and the\r\n_scabinus_ and the bishop, who represented this connection to the\r\nconsciousness of the people. We have noted the marked effects produced\r\non the development of a more popular feeling, by the changes\r\nintroduced by the great emperor of the Franks; which, by diminishing\r\nthe power of the local lords, accomplished a double benefit; on the\r\none hand by saving the people from the arbitrary rule of a feudal\r\nsuperior; on the other, by causing the city to become more of a\r\ndependence and more of a support to the state as a whole. And finally\r\nwe have left the city prepared, on the return of another dynasty of\r\nnative kings, to accept, at least in a large number of cases, the\r\ndomination of another kind of lord, a spiritual one; who was to serve\r\nas a medium for breaking up the power of the old lords of the\r\n_civitas_, and from whom it would be an easier task for the commune of\r\nthe future to wrest the power and the sovereignty which was to make it\r\na free and independent autonomy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES REFERRED TO IN THE TEXT AND FOOT-NOTES.\r\n\r\n_Anastasius Bibliothecarius_: Vitae Romanorum Pontificum. v.\r\n_Muratori_: Script.

Lang., Lib. II., c. 32. v.\r\n_Muratori_: Script. Rer. Ital., T. I., p. 436. The Gothic system was\r\nto take one-third of the land itself from the conquered people; the\r\nLombards on the other hand took one-third of the produce, \"_frugum_.\"\r\n\r\n[2:] With the growth of society and the increase of population, the\r\n_milites_ gain added power, and become the \"_catanei_,\" the barons of\r\nthe period, or as some are pleased to call them, the \"rural counts.\"\r\n\r\n[3:] _Tacitus_: Germania, cap. xvi.\r\n\r\n[4:] The Sagas say the Lombards came originally from Scandinavia.\r\nTheir name is commonly derived from \"Long-beard,\" but more probably\r\ncame from words signifying \"a long stretch of land.\" Their first\r\nappearance in history is during the first century of the Christian\r\nera, in the region of Magdeburg. All trace of them is then lost till\r\nthey reappear in the fifth century on the banks of the Oder; they then\r\ngo south to the river Theiss. They are in a constant state of war with\r\nthe Gepidae, a tribe nearly as fierce as themselves, which strife is\r\nsupposed to have been fomented by the eastern emperors. In the year\r\n567 the Lombards, under their king Alboin, together with the Avars,\r\nbegin to move into Pannonia from Dacia and the region of the Don.\r\nKunnemund, the king of the Gepidae, is killed, and his conquered\r\npeople merged in the race of their conquerors. In the next year, still\r\nvictorious, they overrun Northern Italy.\r\n\r\n[5:] Some of these cities were enabled to hold out for a considerable\r\nperiod. Pavia was not taken till 572.\r\n\r\n[6:] To these seaports some of the functionaries of the inland towns,\r\nespecially among the clergy, were able to effect their escape. For\r\ninstance, the Archbishop of Milan fled to Genoa, and the Archbishop of\r\nAquileja to Venice.\r\n\r\n[7:] The Christianity of the Lombards of the invasion was of the Arian\r\nform. Autari, who reigned from 584 to 591, married Theodolinda of\r\nBavaria, and she first introduced orthodox Christianity. At the death\r\nof Autari she married Agiluf (591-615) duke of Turin, who was an\r\nArian, but who pursued a mediative policy. During his reign a double\r\necclesiastical system, with orthodox and Arian bishops side by side,\r\nwas maintained.\r\n\r\n[8:] Justinian gave him the right to exercise, in reference to each\r\ncity, the functions of the governor of the province, during the\r\nlatter's absence; and granted him jurisdiction in all cases not\r\ninvolving a larger sum than 300 _aurei_. He had a certain amount of\r\nauthority in criminal matters, and two apparitors were attached to his\r\nperson. The _defensores_ had two guarantees for their power and their\r\nindependence. 1. They had the right of passing over the various\r\ndegrees in the public administration, and of carrying their complaints\r\nat once before the praetorian prefect; this freed them from the\r\njurisdiction of the provincial authorities. 2. They were elected by\r\nthe general body of the inhabitants of the _municipium_.\r\n\r\n[9:] _Paulus Diaconus_: Lib. V., 7, 17, 18.\r\n\r\n[10:] His words are: \"Erano stati i Longobardi dugento ventidue anni\r\nin Italia, e di già non ritenevano di forastieri altro che il\r\nnome.\"--_Nicolò Macchiavelli_: Istorie Fiorentine, Lib.

See a\r\n_privilegium_ granted to the nuns of the Posterla di Pavia by Lothar\r\nI. in the year 839, in which it appears that any one infringing its\r\nprivileges must pay seventy pounds of the best gold, to be applied\r\n\"medietatem Palatio nostro, et medietatem parti ejusdem monasterii.\"\r\nVid. _Muratori_: Antiq. Ital. Diss. XVI., Tom I., P. I., p. 233. Also\r\nseveral diplomas of Charles the Fat, and others make use of the same\r\nterm. The word _camera_ for _fiscus_ as the imperial treasury, was\r\nprobably not used before the time of Lewis II.; the first authentic\r\nuse of it in that sense being probably a diploma of that monarch of\r\nthe year 894, where he says that one hundred pounds of gold are to be\r\npaid \"medietatem Imperiali Camere et medietatem suprataxatae\r\nAngilberge.\" Vid. _Muratori_: loc. cit. p. 234.\r\n\r\n[36:] From _Otto of Freising_, De Gest. Freder., Lib I., cap. 31, we\r\nknow that the same distribution took place in Hungary, which was\r\ndivided into seventy _comitates_; \"et de omni justitia ad Fiscum\r\nRegium duas lucri partes cedere, tertiam tantum Comiti remanere.\"\r\n\r\n[37:] _Charlemagne_: Leg.

The feudal character of these will be apparent to\r\nthe reader. Following the rough division indicated in the text, we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\nI. Under heading \"_Fines and Forfeitures_\":\r\n\r\n  1. Forfaturae:\r\n        Forisfacturae,\r\n        Multae (Mulcte),\r\n        Freda,\r\n     _e.g_. Leudis (Leudum) for homicide.\r\n     Penalties and compositions for crime.\r\n\r\n  2. Scadentiae:\r\n        Excadentia,\r\n        Bona caduca.\r\n     _Publicum_ falls heir to various classes of individuals. Cf. Leg.\r\n        _Rhotari_, No. 158 et al.\r\n\r\n  3. Lagan (Laganum).\r\n     Seizure of shipwrecked goods by the state. Examples more\r\n       common after year 1000 A. D.\r\n\r\nII. Under the head of \"_Taxes and Privileges_\":\r\n\r\n  1. _Onera Publica_, or Angariae (Perangariae), Factiones publicae.\r\n     _a_. Heribannum: Penalty for avoidance of military service.\r\n          Cf. _Charlemagne_, Leges, No. 23 et al.\r\n     _b_. Heribergum: Hospitality to _Missi_ of emperor or king. Cf.\r\n          _Charlemagne_, Leges, No. 128 et al.\r\n     _c_. Mansionaticum (Mansiones, Evectio): Lodging for king and\r\n          his ministers.\r\n     Conjectum was a pro rata tax on a district so as to meet the\r\n       expense. Cf. _Lud. Pius_, Leg. Nos. 54, 24, et al. loc.\r\n     Tractoria gave specification of what should be provided in each\r\n     case. For Formula, v. _Marcolfo_, Lib. I.\r\n     _d_.

Pedagium: General word for _tolls_ on streets, roads,\r\nbridges, etc.\r\n      [Greek: alpha]. Pontaticum, for bridges.\r\n      [Greek: beta]. Portaticum, for gates.\r\n      [Greek: gamma]. Platiaticum, for license to sell in market.\r\n      [Greek: delta]. Casaticum, for houses.\r\n      Cf. _Otho_ II., Diploma to Monast. Volturno a. 983, et al. loc.\r\n    _b_. Ripaticum: General word for tolls and taxes for transport by\r\n     water. Cf. Diploma of Berenger II. v. _Ughelli_, Italia Sacra,\r\n   Tom. V. Also a Privilegium of Charlemagne, anno 787. v.\r\n_Ughelli_, Italia Sacra, Tom. V., a. 787. This privilegium\r\nconfirms the laws of Liutprand, and shows how much the\r\ninhabitants of Como had to pay in various places in moving salt\r\ndown the rivers of Lombardy.\r\n      [Greek: alpha]. Paliscitura,\r\n      [Greek: beta]. Trasitura,\r\n      [Greek: gamma]. Navium ligatura.\r\n      Wharfage dues.\r\n      [Greek: delta]. Portonaticum, harbor dues.\r\n      [Greek: epsilon]. Curatura, probably a tax on certain\r\nmerchandise.\r\n      [Greek: zeta].

Under head of \"_lands owned by Crown or Publicum_\":\r\n\r\n  1. _Terra Censualis_. Holder of t.c. owed these duties:\r\n    _a_. Glaudaticum,\r\n    _b_. Escaticum,\r\n    _c_. Herbaticum,\r\n    _d_. Datio,\r\n    _e_. Alpaticum,\r\n    _f_. Agrarium.\r\n    Payments for right to pasture cattle and swine on public lands.\r\n      Cf. Chron. da Volturno, a. 972. Chron.

Pascuarium, payment for sheep pastured on the public land.\r\n    _i_. Boazia, tax levied on every pair of oxen; probably not\r\n      developed before XII. century.\r\n\r\nThe taxes and so forth mentioned in this list are by no means all that\r\nwere levied, but are a fair representation of them. After the year\r\n1000 their feudal character is even more strongly marked.\r\n\r\n[42:] This statement, while true of all integral parts of the Lombard\r\nkingdom, must, however, be modified in regard to the great duchies of\r\nSpoleto and Beneventum, which were under a different system of\r\ninternal government from the kingdom of Lombardy proper--were, in\r\nfact, small tributary kingdoms under great dukes enjoying practically\r\nroyal powers. The Duchy of Beneventum seems to have been divided into\r\n_gastaldata_, divisions of territory similar to the _civitates_ of\r\nLombardy, but presided over by a gastald instead of by a _dux_ or\r\n_comes_. In the charter of division made between the dukes of\r\nBeneventum and of Salerno in the year 851--v. _Muratori_, Ant. Ital.\r\nDiss. X.--are mentioned \"integra gastaldata, seu ministeria Tarentum,\r\nLatinianum, Cusentia, etc.\" And, at an earlier date, _Paulus\r\nDiaconus_--De Gest. Long., Lib. V., cap. 29--tells of a certain\r\n\"Alzeconis Dux de Bulgaris,\" to whom Grimoald, Duke of Beneventum,\r\ngives \"ad habitandum ...

A priest named\r\nGunthram says: \"Nec cumquam ab episcopum Senensem coridicionem\r\nhabuimus, nisi, si de seculares causas nobis oppressio fiebat,\r\nveniebamus ad judicem Senensem, eo quod in ejus territorio sedebamus.\"\r\n\r\n[82:] _Brunetti_: Cod.

For which vid. _Muratori_: Ant. Ital. Diss. LXX., Tom.

I., Pars\r\nII., p. 192) publishes a diploma to the monastery of Novantulanum,\r\nnear Modena, purporting to be by Aistulf and of the year 753; and (in\r\nAnt. Ital. Diss. LXXI., Vol. III., P. II., p. 256) another by\r\nDesiderius to the monastery of Santa Giulia di Brescia, which seems to\r\ngrant exemption and protection if not privilege. But in the first the\r\nformula employed is so exactly similar to that of the later Frankish\r\ndocuments issued for the same purpose, as immediately to excite\r\nsuspicion; and in the second, Muratori himself finds something\r\nradically wrong with the chronology.\r\n\r\n[90:] An even better example can be found among Charlemagne's\r\ndiplomas, by referring to one granted by him to the church of Reggio,\r\nand published by _Ughelli_: Italia Sacra, Tom. V., Appendice.\r\n\r\n[91:] See a charter given by Lothaire to Pietro, bishop of Arezzo in\r\n843, the year of the Treaty of Verdun, v. _Muratori_: Ant. Ital.

Lomb.).\r\n\r\n[93:] Certain \"dona,\" however, supposed to be voluntary, were always\r\nexcepted. See a diploma of Louis of the year 854 to the monastery of\r\nSt. Gall in Germany, where it describes the usual \"dona\" for _all_\r\nmonasteries as \"Caballi duo cum scuteis et lanceis.\" v. _Muratori_:\r\nAnt.
