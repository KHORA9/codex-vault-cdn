But the particular situation of her circumstances at the time\r\nwhen these acquisitions fell into her hands, enhanced the real and\r\nintrinsic value of them to Britain. Oppressed by a grievous debt, the\r\nannual interest of which, exceeding four millions and a half sterling,\r\nwas levied by taxes, which raised the price of each manufacture, her\r\ncommerce labouring under such disadvantages was daily sinking into\r\ndecay; whilst a considerable part of this annual interest being paid to\r\nforeigners, created such a drain of specie, as the balance of her trade\r\ncould not supply; so that, in proportion as her expence increased, the\r\nmeans of defraying it diminished; and she was every year approaching\r\ntowards a state of national poverty and bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances did Britain acquire the sovereign dominion of\r\nBengal, and of other rich manufacturing and trading countries in India;\r\nwhich, at the time they fell to her, were capable of not only defraying\r\nevery charge of their own government and defence, but over and above\r\nthat, of yielding annually to the sovereign a sum equal to 1,300,000 l.\r\nsterling, as can be readily demonstrated. Nor do we include in this sum\r\nthe benefit which Britain had been accustomed to receive, in her\r\ncommercial capacity, by her trade with those countries: the sum here\r\nspecified would have arisen purely in consequence of dominion: and,\r\nwhether transmitted from those countries in merchandize or in money,\r\nwould at last have arrived at the public treasury in specie: and would\r\nthus have served to alleviate the burden of those taxes, that are\r\npressing every branch of her domestic commerce to ruin. And, if Britain\r\nhad bestowed the smallest attention on the political government of those\r\ncountries, she might have continued to draw from them the abovementioned\r\ntribute sum _in perpetuum_, without any danger of draining or\r\nimpoverishing them: nay it is certain, that under a just, equitable and\r\nwell ordered government, their commerce and agriculture might have been\r\nextended to a degree, that would have enabled them to afford a still\r\nlarger annual tribute to the sovereign. The possession of this Indian\r\ndominion is likewise so particularly secured from domestic and foreign\r\ndanger, by the extraordinary submissive disposition of the natives, the\r\nsingularly defensible situation of the country, and the naval\r\nsuperiority of Britain, that, by a very trifling expence of men, and no\r\npecuniary charge, she might have maintained it against all enemies. So\r\nthat Britain might have derived from this dependent dominion resources\r\nsufficient to relieve her from all her difficulties and distresses.\r\n\r\nThis is what Britain might have done: and this was not simply possible,\r\nit was easy of execution. But if we enquire what Britain hath done, we\r\nshall find that, instead of applying these resources by a proper care\r\nand attention to the purpose, for which it would seem the all-wise\r\ndispensation of Providence had at this critical conjuncture bestowed\r\nthem upon her, she hath indolently and desperately thrown them from her,\r\nand left them to the will of blind chance. For surely it may with\r\npropriety be said, that the government of Britain consigned all these\r\nresources to the guidance of blind chance, or rather to certain\r\ndestruction, when it scrupulously withheld its own care, and implicitly\r\nconfided the sovereign charge of governing and defending this foreign\r\ndominion to a Company of Merchants, so evidently unequal to such a\r\ncharge, that, instead of being surprized that these countries should now\r\nat last be impoverished and ruined, we have reason to be astonished,\r\nthat they have supported, for such a length of time, the complicated\r\nevils of tyranny and anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of committing this sovereign charge to the Company have\r\nbeen long foreseen, and likewise foretold, by some who were acquainted\r\nwith the nature of their government: but the power and influence of\r\nthose who were sharing amongst them the plunder of those wretched\r\ncountries, blasted the credit of their representations: until at last,\r\nthe effects being felt at home, it hath become impossible to totally\r\nsuppress the truth. Nay even now, that these men are forced to partly\r\nacknowledge the ruinous situation of this foreign dominion, yet have\r\nthey still the assurance to mislead the public judgment, by representing\r\nthe Company as the only party concerned in the consequence: though it is\r\ncertain, that this Indian concern, which hath been leased or farmed out\r\nby Government to the Company, is of the very highest importance to the\r\npublic interest, as having been for many years the principal support of\r\nnational opulence and credit, as well as of commerce and revenue. For,\r\nin the article of opulence, the private fortunes acquired in those\r\ncountries by the servants of the Company, ever since the time that their\r\npower prevailed over the native government, that is ever since 1757,\r\nhath created an annual influx of specie to Britain of about 700,000 l.\r\nand the dedomagement paid to Government by the Company, since the\r\nassumption of the dewanny in 1765, is a farther influx of 400,000 l. the\r\ndrawback on teas is reckoned about 200,000 l. and the Company hath\r\nincreased her dividend since the last mentioned period 200,000 l. though\r\nonly one half of this last sum may be reckoned to remain in the country,\r\nthe other half being paid to foreign proprietors. These four sums,\r\nmaking together 1,400,000 l. have been yearly drawn from India in\r\nconsequence of dominion: and, whether sent from thence in merchandize,\r\nin bills, or in specie, have produced so much money to Britain: and\r\nnotwithstanding the private fortunes have been acquired by means that\r\nhave exhausted these sources of wealth, that might otherwise have flowed\r\nperpetually into Britain; and the dedomagement may be considered as a\r\nbase composition, received for alienating the sovereign rights of the\r\nBritish crown and nation, and for furnishing a force to support the most\r\ndetestable tyranny of a few individuals over fifteen millions of men,\r\nwho are to all intents and purposes British subjects; yet did the\r\nopportune importation of so much wealth, serve to support the credit of\r\nthe nation under the grievous accumulation of debt contracted in the\r\nlast war; and to prevent her feeling the drain of specie made by her\r\nforeign creditors, which otherwise would by this time have completely\r\nexhausted her. By her commerce with those countries, Britain hath\r\nexported yearly 5 or 600,000 l. worth of her own manufactures and\r\nmerchandize, and for these she received the commodities of India; which\r\ncommodities, being re-exported, formed the most essential article of her\r\ntraffic with Africa, on which her West India colonies do entirely\r\ndepend; they are likewise the most valuable article of her trade with\r\nAmerica. And the duties levied by Government, on such part of these\r\nIndian commodities as is expended at home, create a very considerable,\r\nand by far the most equitable and convenient branch of revenue.\r\n\r\nBut the value and importance of this Indian concern will appear in a\r\nstill stronger light, if we shall look forward to the consequences that\r\nmust naturally and unavoidably ensue to the public interest from the\r\nloss of it. The first and most immediate of these consequences will be\r\nnational bankruptcy; or, which is the same thing, a stop to the payment\r\nof interest on the national debt; for a deprivation of that annual\r\ninflux of specie from India will quickly produce national poverty; and\r\nan incapacity of paying in specie the interest of the foreign creditors.\r\nBut the loss of our Indian commerce will operate this effect still more\r\nspeedily; for, on the supposition that the nation shall be deprived of\r\nthis branch of commerce, it must necessarily follow, that Government\r\nwill lose that branch of revenue which arises from the home consumption\r\nof Indian commodities; and it is plain, that Government cannot then\r\ncontinue to pay the usual expence, without making good this deficiency\r\nof revenue by additional taxes on land, and the necessaries of life: but\r\nas this additional load, falling on our little remaining commerce, would\r\nby one year’s experience be found insupportable, Government would be\r\nforced to retrench its expence, in that only article that can be\r\ndispensed with, the payment of interest on the national debt; and when\r\nthis happens, what advantage will the public creditor hold above the\r\nIndia proprietor? The only difference will be, that the latter will have\r\nfelt his loss a little earlier than the former. But national bankruptcy,\r\nthough it may be the first, is not the only, nor even the greatest,\r\npublic damage, accruing from a deprivation of this Indian concern: loss\r\nof future credit, of trade and navigation, and consequently of naval\r\npower and defence, will soon follow; and, in this general calamity,\r\neveryone individual of the community will come in for his share, in\r\nproportion to his rank or situation.\r\n\r\nSuch are the consequences that must ensue to the public interest from a\r\ndeprivation of the benefit hitherto derived from this Indian concern:\r\nand if the nation is to suffer so grievously by the loss of this object,\r\ncan she allow herself to be persuaded, that she hath no interest in its\r\npreservation. Now this object stands in danger of being lost to the\r\nnation by two different causes; the first being, the neglect or\r\nincapacity of the Company to maintain and defend it from the assault of\r\nenemies: and the other danger arises from the oppression and misconduct\r\nof this Company’s political government; tending to despoil those\r\ncountries of their circulating specie, their arts, manufactures,\r\ncommerce, and inhabitants, which were the only means that enabled them\r\nto afford this benefit to Britain. The first of these dangers is\r\nscarcely dreamt of, and yet it is perhaps immediately imminent; at\r\npresent however we are treating of the danger to be apprehended from the\r\npolitical cause.\r\n\r\nHow far the interest of this foreign dominion hath been injured by the\r\nCompany’s political misgovernment; or how near it may be reduced to a\r\nstate of utter inability to afford any farther benefit to Britain, is\r\nbut little known by the public. For though people have heard in the\r\ngross, that affairs in those countries are rather in a bad situation,\r\nyet do not they either understand or believe it to be so very bad as it\r\nreally is; or rather they do not comprehend how it should be so bad; as\r\nnot being acquainted with the full power of the cause that hath produced\r\nthe evil; and every one will form his notion of effects that he neither\r\nfeels nor sees, from his knowledge or opinion of the nature and power of\r\nthe causes that produced them. In the case before us, people have been\r\ntaught to consider the oppression and extortion of its government, (of\r\nwhich certain instances are quoted) as the sole cause of evil to Bengal:\r\nof consequence it is supposed that Bengal hath suffered no farther\r\ndamage from its government, than what may have been caused by some\r\nprivate acts of extortion, exercised by the few persons vested with the\r\npowers of governing: and, besides that the authenticity of these acts is\r\ndenied or disputed, and men who are to judge only from report are apt to\r\nmake allowance for the prejudice or passion of the accuser who brings a\r\ncharge against individuals; still if all these acts of oppression that\r\nhave been narrated should be fully credited; nay, if the hearer should\r\nsuppose still more than is represented, yet cannot he conceive or allow\r\nhimself to believe that such acts of extortion, exercised by a small\r\nnumber of individuals, could suffice to reduce the lately rich\r\ncommercial kingdom of Bengal to such a deplorable state of misery,\r\npoverty, and distress: the cause assigned will appear too trivial for\r\nthe effect; and of course the effect, at least the degree of it, will be\r\ndiscredited.\r\n\r\nBut he who means to acquire a just notion of the present state of those\r\ncountries, and the extent of damage they have sustained from their\r\npresent Government, must fully inform himself of the true nature and\r\ncondition of that Government, and the manner of its operation on the\r\ngeneral interest of the people governed; he must learn, not only that\r\nwhich it hath done, but likewise that which it hath not done; for the\r\ninterest of a community may suffer far more detriment from the\r\nnonaction, than from the oppression, of its government. To the end,\r\ntherefore, that every one may be enabled to form a proper judgment on\r\nthese matters, we mean to present a general view of the nature, and\r\neffects, of the Company’s Government in Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE NATURE AND EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY’S GOVERNMENT IN BENGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English East India company is, under the title of Dewan, the real\r\nand actual sovereign of Bengal, Behar, and Orixa: a dominion equal to\r\nalmost any one state in Europe, in respect of either extent and\r\nfertility of country, or numbers of ingenious and industrious subjects;\r\nand exceeding most of them in the internal materials of commerce, or\r\nresources of wealth. The Company executes the government of this\r\ndominion by a deputation, consisting of a Governor and Council; who\r\nreside at Calcutta, the Company’s original presidency, or chief factory\r\nin Bengal. And the Directors, who, as possessing the executive authority\r\nof the Company, may be termed the supreme sovereigns of this Indian\r\ndominion, have preserved to themselves the sole power of immediately\r\nordering, directing and controuling the government; for this deputed\r\ngovernment communicates its purposes, receives its orders, and accounts\r\nfor its conduct to none but the Directors.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident, that the distance of situation must render the\r\nimmediate controul of the Directors perfectly impotent, ineffectual, and\r\nnugatory; for it would be absurd to suppose, that the government of\r\nBengal should defer the execution of any one purpose until it shall have\r\ncommunicated with, and received the opinion of the Directors, which\r\ncannot be effected in the space of a whole year; consequently the\r\ndirectors cannot interfere in the direction, or ordering of this\r\ngovernment, farther than in some few cases of the most general or\r\ninvariable nature: but the execution of even these general orders\r\ndepends upon the will and discretion of the deputed government; seeing\r\nthe Directors cannot, at that distance, enforce it themselves: and the\r\nsame cause puts it out of their power to prevent or restrain abuse; so\r\nthat they hold neither positive nor negative authority in the immediate\r\nexecution of this government. And the condition or situation of these\r\ndirectorial sovereigns at home, renders their retrospective controul\r\nequally impotent and ineffectual; for they have no power in themselves\r\nto inflict other punishment on their deputies, for the most audacious\r\ndisobedience, or for maladministration, than dismission from their\r\nservice; and this becomes no punishment, because the delinquents are\r\npreviously prepared for it, being ready to set out of their own accord\r\nwith a princely fortune for the mother country; where they set the\r\nauthority of the Directors at defiance; for there these sovereigns of\r\nIndia are themselves subjects, and cannot call their quondam ministers\r\nto account, except in an ordinary court of justice; and the difficulty\r\nof obtaining evidence requisite to convict in these courts; the dread of\r\nbringing to light, in the course of a legal process, some abstruse\r\nmysteries of government; and the apprehension of danger arising to the\r\ninterest of the present direction from a powerful combination at the\r\nnext election, will ever deter the Directors from seriously prosecuting\r\na lawsuit against their deputies, even in cases of peculation from the\r\nsovereign; but if it respects only the interest of the subject, they\r\nwill be more apt to palliate and defend the offence. We must therefore\r\nperceive, that this deputed government acts perfectly independent of\r\neither the immediate controul, or future awe of the sovereign: whilst\r\nthe sovereign is compelled to blindly support, with its whole power, the\r\nauthority of this government; and, without choice, to enforce all its\r\nmeasures; seeing that to oppose the will of the deputy, is opposing the\r\nauthority of the sovereign.\r\n\r\nAnd, as to the native subjects, the power of this deputed government\r\nover them is perfectly absolute and complete. For the inhabitants of\r\nthose countries, being disposed by nature or climate to passive\r\nobedience, and by long custom habituated to despotic authority, and\r\nbeing farther impressed with a particular awe of Europeans, from a\r\nnotion of their natural superiority, implicitly submit to the will of\r\ntheir present government, without once daring to either examine its\r\nright, dispute its authority, or question its conduct. The subject\r\ntherefore holds not the smallest voice in the administration of\r\ngovernment; the jurisdiction, the police, the finances, the military\r\ngovernment and defence, are all incontroulably directed by the Company’s\r\ndeputation: and the entire interests of those countries, the lives and\r\nproperty of the inhabitants, are subjected to its discretion, and depend\r\non its will.\r\n\r\nSo that this deputation of the Company executes the government of Bengal\r\nwith a power perfectly unlimited by any exterior controul; and if we\r\nconsider that it is at the same time foreign to the country governed,\r\nmutable, and of very short duration, we shall find that it is equally\r\nunrestrained by any internal check. It is therefore the most unlimited\r\ngovernment on earth; or rather it is the only government that can, with\r\npropriety, be termed arbitrary and despotic.\r\n\r\nFor all other deputed governments are sufficiently restrained by the\r\nauthority of the sovereign; and we have no idea of despotism, except in\r\ngovernments that are supreme or sovereign. But the idea of actual\r\ndespotism in a supreme government is merely imaginary; seeing that, in\r\none and all of these governments, the power of governing is conditional,\r\nlimited by rule, and subjected to controul both external and internal.\r\nFor it is evident, that, in all supreme governments, the power of\r\ngoverning, and the means that support this power, must needs be derived\r\nfrom the people governed; and therefore cannot exist in despight of\r\ntheir consent; and though, in some of these governments, the condition,\r\nupon which this power and these means are granted, is not specially\r\nexpressed, yet is it perfectly understood, and invariably enforced in\r\nall of them; inasmuch as there are examples in each, of sovereigns who\r\nhave suffered the utmost punishment, for attempting to transgress the\r\nlimits of this condition; nay, there is scarce one instance where the\r\nprince, thus transgressing, escaped the resentment of the people; and\r\nexamples of this nature are most frequent in these governments that are\r\nfalsely termed despotic. These examples must therefore convince all\r\nsovereigns, that there is a power in the people, superior to, and\r\ncapable of controuling them; and the sense of this must ever prove an\r\neffectual external controul on the conduct of a supreme government. But\r\nself-interest, that _primum_ and _perpetuum mobile_ of human action,\r\nwhich we may term an internal check, operates still more forcibly,\r\nconstantly, and immediately on the will of a supreme government; not\r\nsimply restraining it from doing or permitting injury, but impelling it\r\nto promote the good of the people governed. For a government that is\r\nsovereign, and perpetual (or _durante vita_ and hereditary) cannot\r\npossibly separate its own private interest from that of the community\r\nwhich it governs; being indeed itself a part of that community: and this\r\nis so evident, that no prince ever attempted to advance a distinct\r\ninterest of his own, at the expence of the general weal, who was not a\r\nfool, before he became a tyrant. But a wise sovereign considers his\r\npeople as the channel through which alone he can receive substantial\r\ngood or evil; and, acting upon this principle, he will, however absolute\r\nand disposed by nature to tyranny, abstain from injuring the general\r\ninterest, because he is sensible that such injury will recoil upon\r\nhimself; and he will exert himself to promote the prosperity of his\r\npeople, as the only means of advancing his own power, grandeur, or\r\nwealth. So that a sovereign prince, who understands his own real\r\ninterest, though otherwise void of virtue, will ever study to govern\r\nwell; nay, the private vices of such a prince do often operate public\r\ngood; a striking instance of which we meet with in our Henry the\r\nSeventh; whose extreme and sordid avarice was the source of English\r\ncommerce and wealth; and his mean self-love, and jealousy of power,\r\nestablished universal liberty.\r\n\r\nBut the nature of this Bengal government differs, in every circumstance,\r\nfrom that of a supreme government; being deputed, foreign, mutable, and\r\ntemporary, it is no way interested in the lasting prosperity of the\r\ncommunity which it governs; on the contrary, this government holds an\r\ninterest which is not only distinct from, but diametrically opposite to\r\nthat of the subject. For these Governors return to Europe immediately on\r\nthe expiration of their office, which seldom dures above three years,\r\noften less; therefore their sole aim is to amass all the wealth they\r\ncan, during the short term of their power, in order to transport it\r\nalong with their persons to their own country. But the wealth which a\r\ngovernment amasses, must needs be extorted from the people governed;\r\nconsequently self-interest leads this government to pillage and plunder\r\nthe subject: and we have seen that it is not restrained, by any external\r\ncontroul, from advancing its own distinct interest at the expence of the\r\ncommunity which it governs, seeing it is perfectly exempted from all awe\r\nof either the sovereign or the subject; and it cannot be restrained by\r\nany internal check, because it holds no concern in the lasting welfare\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nSuch then is the ruling principle of this government: nor are the means\r\nwhich it employs to promote its own interest less extraordinary than is\r\nits power to enforce them. For this government, which arbitrarily\r\ndirects the jurisdiction and police, together with the imposition and\r\ncollection of taxes, doth at same time act in the capacity of a\r\nmerchant. And this commercial despotism, or despotic power lodged in the\r\nhands of a few foreign merchants, hath, in its nature and consequences,\r\nproved infinitely more destructive to the interest of that commercial\r\ncountry, than all the operations of political tyranny have been: for\r\nfrom it sprung these cruel monopolies, which struck at the very root of\r\nmanufacture, commerce, and even population.\r\n\r\nTo attempt describing the particular methods which this government hath\r\npractised to promote its own interest at the expence of the people, in\r\nits double capacity, of an absolute sovereign and a despotic merchant,\r\nwould be a tedious, invidious, and even an unprofitable undertaking; for\r\nit is almost impossible to properly delineate the conduct of a tyranny\r\nso various and irregular in its operations; and, to those who are\r\nunacquainted with the modes, customs, and interests of the country in\r\nquestion, the recital of a few particular instances would only serve to\r\nmislead their judgment, and darken or diminish the truth. By attending\r\nto the general description given of the nature views and interests of\r\nthis government, we shall form a more complete and just notion of its\r\nconduct and deportment, than can be acquired from any disjointed account\r\nof particulars. Let us suppose a few foreigners sent into a rich\r\ncommercial country, with absolute and unlimited power over the lives and\r\nproperty of the inhabitants; actuated by no other principle than that of\r\nacquiring riches, and stimulated thereto not only by avarice but\r\nambition, or the desire of excelling; unrestrained by any species of\r\npresent awe or future apprehension; but on the contrary, encouraged by\r\nprecedent to expect in their own country, titles, dignity, respect, and\r\nconsequence, each in proportion to the sum he imports; and whatever\r\nmethods we can suppose would be practised by such foreigners, to\r\naccomplish their purpose, within a short limited term, we may suppose to\r\nhave been actually employed by this Bengal government. The enormous\r\namount of numerous fortunes, imported by the persons employed in this\r\ngovernment, together with the rapidity of acquisition, are circumstances\r\nseen and known in this country; and these will thoroughly warrant our\r\nsupposing, that the acquirers have availed themselves to the utmost of\r\ntheir powers, as well as their opportunities. However, we shall err\r\ngreatly in our estimate of the damage caused to those countries, by\r\ntheir government’s prosecuting its own distinct interest, if we shall\r\nconfine the reckoning to only the loss of so much specie, as hath been\r\nextorted and exported by these foreigners: for this, though in itself a\r\nruinous grievance, is merely trivial, when compared with the havoc and\r\nwaste committed on the manufacture, the commerce, agriculture, and\r\npopulation, by the methods employed to acquire these sums. A herd of\r\nhogs, broke into a well dressed vineyard, will gorge their voracious\r\nmaws; but that which they eat and devour doth not destroy the vineyard;\r\nit is their manner of eating, their rutting up, their tearing down, and\r\ntrampling under foot.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have regarded this government in only one point of view: we\r\nhave seen it acting for itself; but we have not seen the part it acts\r\nfor the people, in its capacity of a sovereign ruler, administring the\r\ngovernment of a mighty state in all its different offices or\r\ndepartments; and entrusted with the care of the whole and entire\r\ninterests of a numerous commercial nation. But, in the discharge of this\r\nsovereign trust, we shall find the government of Bengal a mere _Vis\r\ninertiæ_, void of the two efficient principles of action, ability or\r\npower of acting, and will or inclination. For how can we expect to find\r\nthe ability, of governing well, in the men employed by the Company to\r\nexecute the government of those countries? to attain the knowledge of\r\nany one science or mystery, demands an effort of the mind; but it is\r\nimpossible for the brightest natural genius to arrive at even a moderate\r\ndegree of skill in the art of governing, which, as it is the most\r\nelevated, so is it the most difficult, abstruse, various and complicated\r\nof all human sciences, without long and intense application, study, and\r\nreflection; and, we may add, a series of practice; and all these\r\ngradations to skill, in governing, are wanting to our Bengal governors.\r\nTheir scholastic education extends no farther than to qualify them for\r\nmerchants clerks; and, immediately on being taken from school, they are\r\ndispatched to India; where the manner of life is consonant to the\r\nclimate, voluptuous to a degree of dissoluteness, vain, idle,\r\ndissipated, and an enemy to study or reflection: the juvenile part of\r\ntheir life being spent in this manner, they arrive at the charge of\r\ngovernment with minds perfectly uninformed, and so very averse to\r\napplication, that they commit and implicitly confide the charge of their\r\nown private concerns to servants. If such men should possess the skill\r\nor address of governing well, it must certainly be acquired\r\ninstantaneously and supernaturally; infused into them by miracle, like\r\nthe gift of speech into the ass of Balaam.\r\n\r\nBut the want of will or inclination is an obstacle to their governing\r\nwell, still more prevalent than is the want of ability. Labour, fatigue,\r\nand difficulty are evils, to which the human mind is so naturally\r\naverse, that, unless it is urged by some strong impulse of passion, such\r\nas the fear of some superior evil, or the hope and desire of some mighty\r\ngood, it will decline and evade them: what stimulum then can be\r\nsufficiently powerful to urge the habitually indolent minds of our\r\nBengal governors to encounter the difficulties, the labour, and fatigue\r\nattending a due discharge of the duties of government; which, of all\r\nhuman undertakings, is the most replete with these mental evils? Yet\r\nthis government, which demands a stronger stimulum than any other\r\ngovernment that ever yet existed, is in effect urged by no one motive or\r\nconsideration to discharge the duties of its office; for, as it holds no\r\ninterest in the lasting welfare of the people governed, neither its\r\nhopes nor its fears are at all interested in the good or evil\r\nconsequences that may be caused by its own vigilance or neglect: being\r\naltogether superior to the resentment of the subject, and independent of\r\nthe sovereign’s authority, it is not impelled, by the fear of immediate\r\ndanger, nor the apprehension of future punishment: and as to the\r\nprospect of glory, applause, or respect, which push the generous and\r\nambitious mind to action, our governors aim to attain them, not by\r\ngoverning well, but by acquiring and bringing home a mighty fortune to\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nMen thus actuated, or rather unactuated, must, in the discharge of their\r\nsovereign office, be perfectly torpid and listless; the machine of\r\npolitical government stops in their hands, and stands stock still: their\r\nminds being incapable of application, they withdraw themselves as much\r\nas possible from attention, and leave the trouble of governing to\r\nothers, still less qualified than themselves; these inferior agents\r\nbeing chosen, not for their abilities or virtue, but for their fitness\r\nto serve the private purpose of the governors, otherwise by chance; but\r\nthey give themselves no trouble to inspect the conduct of these agents,\r\nwho in general are unprincipled miscreants; on the contrary, they\r\npromiscuously approve and support every action; so that, wherever the\r\npower of this government acts, it is only to oppress; and all beside is\r\nleft to chance. However, the power of governing, or rather of\r\noppressing, is not confined to the persons vested with the charge of\r\ngovernment: the numerous servants whom this Company disperses over the\r\nface of the country, for the purpose of carrying on her trade, do each\r\nof them, in his own district, assume the authority of a despot; and\r\ncommunicates a like authority to all his servants and dependants, who,\r\nit must be allowed, are far more unrelenting than their masters; and\r\nthus tyranny is extended into every corner; oppression becomes general;\r\nand the oppressed are excluded from the very prospect of redress; for,\r\non appeal to the superior, the plaintiff is ever remanded to the very\r\noppressor, who punishes him for having dared to complain. And thus\r\njustice and protection are no where to be found; vice goes unpunished,\r\nand innocence unsupported; therefore every man becomes a villain in his\r\nown defence; and faith, confidence, truth, and honesty are banished the\r\nland. In short, it may with strict propriety be said by these wretched\r\npeople, _Terras astræa reliquit_; and tyranny and anarchy have here set\r\nup their throne.\r\n\r\nAnd to this inaction or non-exertion of the powers of government we are\r\nto impute the ruin of those countries, rather than to the avarice or\r\nrapine of the persons deputed by the Company to execute that government.\r\nFor the power of governing being vested in only a few, the extortion of\r\nthese few might have been long supported by a rich commercial country,\r\nprovided they had exerted themselves to restrain and prevent all others\r\nfrom plundering and oppressing. The avarice, profusion and bloody\r\ntyranny of even Nero, and Domitian, was felt by only a few of their\r\nsubjects at Rome; every where else the empire flourished; because these\r\nimperial monopolizers of vice would suffer none in power to be wicked\r\nbut themselves; they narrowly inspected the conduct of their governors\r\nand officers, and severely punished their injustice or oppression. But\r\nwhere the government doth not only plunder itself, but suffers every one\r\nunder it to plunder, that country must in time be completely ruined.\r\n\r\nNow Bengal hath been subjected to a government of this nature for these\r\nfifteen years past; for though we commonly date the commencement of the\r\nCompany’s sovereignty from the assumption of the Dewanny, (as it is\r\ntermed,) yet hath this Company (at least her deputies) possessed a\r\nreally absolute authority in those countries ever since the battle of\r\nPlassey in 1757. That action rendered them masters of Bengal; and it was\r\nequally within their power to assume the sovereign government at that\r\ntime, as afterwards in 1765; their own will was the only obstacle: but\r\nnotwithstanding they bestowed it on a native Nabob, yet did they retain\r\nan absolute superiority over him, and he governed in a state of perfect\r\nsubordination to their authority; for he well knew and experienced, that\r\nthe duration of his office, and even of his existence, depended upon\r\ntheir will; consequently this dependent native government could but\r\nlittle restrain the conduct of the Company’s deputies, or protect the\r\nsubject from their rapacity; and when they, in 1765, set aside this\r\nnative government, they only removed a screen which they themselves had\r\nset up, and till then preserved for their own purpose.\r\n\r\nHow far these countries may have advanced towards the period of final\r\nruin, under the fifteen or sixteen years domination of such a\r\ngovernment, we shall not pretend to determine, because the term _ruin_\r\nis variously understood. This much is certain, that the unbounded\r\nremittance of specie made, for some years, by the English Company, for\r\nsundry purposes as sovereign; and for a much greater number of years,\r\nand in much larger sums by the other European Companies, who received it\r\nfrom the servants of the English Company for bills on Europe, at a very\r\nlow exchange, and employed it for every purpose in the other parts of\r\nIndia and China, hath compleatly drained Bengal of its wealth, and\r\nreduced it to a state of the most abject poverty. And the grievous\r\noppression and rapine exercised by the Company’s servants, and their\r\nnumerous dependants; together with the most cruel monopolies usurped by\r\nthem over every species of merchandize, and even the necessaries of\r\nlife, hath in a great measure suppressed commerce, and abolished trade.\r\nWhilst the insatiable avarice and unrestrained extortion of those\r\nemployed in the collection of taxes and revenue having ruined the\r\nfarmer, the lands lay uncultivated and waste; insomuch that, not to\r\nmention the immense decrease of revenue, that naturally most fertile of\r\nall countries, Bengal, hath suffered a more severe famine than perhaps\r\nwas ever heard of; it being reckoned that a fifth part of the\r\ninhabitants have died of want, and numbers have fled from starving and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nBut it is not difficult to determine how near the interest of Britain in\r\nthose countries hath approached to ruin: for Britain is to consider them\r\nas ruined to her purpose, so soon as they shall become incapable of\r\nsupporting a commerce beneficial to her; and at same time of yielding\r\nher a consideration, in the nature of tribute, equivalent to the expence\r\nof subjects which she sends out annually to maintain her dominion there.\r\nAnd that they are nearly, if not totally, ruined to her, in both these\r\nrespects, we begin already to feel, in spite of all the art or influence\r\nused to conceal the truth.\r\n\r\nFor, in the article of tribute, we find that, instead of receiving such\r\na surplus of revenue as sufficed, at the commencement of the Dewanny, to\r\nnot only pay for the specie part of the Company’s investment in Bengal\r\nitself, but to purchase her cargoes, and defray all her charges in the\r\nother parts of India, and in China, the government of Bengal was, two\r\nyears ago, reduced to the necessity of borrowing near a million sterling\r\non bills, which have been transmitted and accepted by the Company: in\r\nlike manner hath this government been obliged to borrow last year;\r\nthough the bills have been prevented, by an arbitrary stroke of deceit,\r\nfrom appearing against them in Europe. These borrowed sums have all been\r\nexpended in Bengal itself: and if we allow that the whole hath been\r\nemployed to pay for the Company’s investment, (though by the by the\r\nspecie part of the Company’s investment cannot, at least it ought not,\r\nif she exports the proper quantity of European commodities, exceed half\r\na million,) it must even then be admitted, that the revenue of Bengal\r\nhath barely sufficed to defray the ordinary expence of government. And,\r\nif so, from whence is the tribute of Bengal, (whether we term it\r\ndedomagement, drawback, or encreased dividend) to arise? not from the\r\nmighty cargoes imported; for they are purchased, not with surplus\r\nrevenue, but with borrowed money, which must be repaid either in India\r\nor in Europe: and as to the profits on these cargoes, they will be more\r\nthan eat up by the charges of freight, and a long reckoning of India\r\ninterest at eight per cent. I am sensible, that this account is\r\nstrangely perplexed and embarrassed by intricate calculations of stock\r\nin hand, annual importations, and future sales, &c. but when divested of\r\nall these studied intricacies it will stand simply thus—As is the clear\r\nsurplus of revenue received in Bengal, so will be the amount of tribute\r\nreceived in Britain; the former will ever exactly balance the latter.\r\nBut this surplus we find to have been, for the two past years, equal to\r\nnothing; and the amount of tribute received in Britain must amount to\r\nexactly as much; consequently the dedomagement, drawback, and increased\r\ndividend for the two last years is still _in Nubibus_; where the\r\nnational part, consisting of the two first articles, is like to remain;\r\nunless it shall be paid out of the Company’s capital stock, as the\r\nencreased dividend hath been. But this revenue, which for the two years\r\npast hath barely sufficed to defray the expence of government, hath not\r\nbeen kept up even to that extent without the aid of violence: but\r\nviolence itself must yield to necessity, and cannot extort that which\r\ndoth not exist; moreover the Company had, in these two years, decreased\r\nher military expence, by disbanding some thousand sipahis, and otherwise\r\ndiminishing the charge of her remaining force; and the attack made by\r\nShaw Allum in conjunction with the Mharrattors will, this year, compel\r\nher to re-augment her military expence in every respect; whilst the\r\npredatory incursions of these Mharrhattors will prevent the collection\r\nof revenue; how then will she support the augmented charge of this year,\r\nwith a revenue decreased by a variety of causes so much below the degree\r\nof last year? Another loan upon the strength of the capital is the only\r\nresource; but possibly borrowing may, for several reasons, have become\r\nimpracticable by this time; and it is certain that troops will not, nay\r\ncannot, serve without pay—Here is a blessed prospect indeed.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving this to the proof of time, we perceive that, at any rate,\r\nwe have lost the prospect of future tribute from Bengal, through the\r\nchannel of the Company; we have not so much as the promise of\r\ndedomagement, drawback, or encreased dividend for this current year; and\r\nif we can trust to our own reason, preferably to bankrupt promises, we\r\nmay give it up for good and all. Nay, there is mighty reason to\r\napprehend, that even the private fortunes will soon cease to exist; and\r\nthen Britain will cease to receive the sum of 1,400,000 l. sterling,\r\nwhich for a number of years past hath been annually flowing in to her\r\nfrom India, in consequence of dominion. And if she could barely support\r\nher burden, when aided by this influx, how will she, when deprived of\r\nit, answer the annual drain of specie made by her foreign creditors?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the present state of our commerce with those countries,\r\nit is not enquired, and therefore not known, whether the Company exports\r\nthe stipulated sum of British commodities or not; and it is still less\r\nknown, whether the small quantity she hath exported of late is disposed\r\nof; or whether it remains in her warehouses abroad, to swell up the\r\naccount of her stock; thus much however reason tells us, that the\r\ninhabitants of Bengal, who cannot procure the necessaries of life,\r\nmillions having died of want, can but little afford to purchase foreign\r\nfopperies or superfluities. Nevertheless we have seen large cargoes of\r\nIndian manufactures imported this very year; but we are not to suppose,\r\nthat these cargoes are the produce of willing industry; they are\r\nprocured by force and compulsion; the artisan being held to work under\r\nthe discipline of task masters, who deprive him of his labour before it\r\nis completed, at a price that will not afford him the means of living.\r\nOf the many markets that for ages had taken off the manufactures of\r\nBengal, Europe is now the only one remaining; and this one market cannot\r\nbe supplied without the application of force. How long force might\r\nsupply the place of willing industry, we shall not pretend to determine;\r\nbut one year more will discover the united effects of want of artisans,\r\nwant of money, and Mharrattor incursions.\r\n\r\nAnd thus have we demonstrated the nature and condition of this Bengal\r\ngovernment, together with the evils it hath caused to the country\r\ngoverned, not from a recital of disputed facts, but from principles\r\nuniversally understood and admitted. For every one, the least acquainted\r\nwith the Company’s affairs, must know and will allow that the views, the\r\ninterests, the powers and opportunities of her deputed government in\r\nBengal are exactly such as we have described them; and upon this one\r\nundisputed _datum_ we have built our whole demonstration; the truth and\r\njustness of which every man is capable of trying and proving, by the\r\ntouchstone of his own reason. For reason, without the aid of\r\ncircumstantial proof, can judge whether the line of conduct which we\r\nhave assigned to the government of Bengal, is fairly inferred and\r\ndeduced from its evident and allowed principle of action: and common\r\nsense, unassisted by demonstration, will point out the effects that such\r\nconduct must operate on the interest of the country governed; and, if we\r\nfarther advert to the length of time that this country hath been\r\nsubjected to such operation, we shall nearly guess at its present state\r\nand condition.\r\n\r\nAnd we doubt not, that what hath been said will enable every one, who\r\nmakes use of his own reason and reflection, to form a proper judgment\r\nfor himself on certain points of this East India business, which have\r\nbeen most grossly misrepresented. For he will thereby discover, that the\r\nobject, for which the nation hath to apprehend at present, is not the\r\n“_credit_ of the Company;” which, had she been restrained within her\r\nnatural sphere, and her conduct properly inspected by government, could\r\nnever have been injured; or, if it had, the breach could (in such case)\r\nhave little more affected the general weal, than the failure of any\r\nlarge trading house; which, so long as the trade remained entire, would\r\nhave been immediately replaced by another; but he will perceive, that\r\nthe present bad state of the Company’s credit is only an effect, or\r\nconsequence, of the ruinous situation of affairs in India; and, of\r\ncourse, that the object of national apprehension is the ruin or loss of\r\nthat mighty and important branch of national interest, which hath been\r\ncommitted to the charge of the Company, in a manner so complete and\r\nimplicit, that the name, as well as the interest of the nation, nay the\r\nvery name of the object itself, hath been sunk and lost in that of the\r\nCompany: this Company, which is but the temporary farmer, having been,\r\nto all intents and purposes, substituted in the stead of not only the\r\nsovereign proprietor, but even of the farm itself. And it will farther\r\nappear, that the danger which threatens this object is not to be averted\r\nby blindly supporting the credit of the Company: but, on the contrary,\r\nthat the nation will, by affording this blind support, only furnish the\r\nmeans of completing that ruin, which is already so far advanced. To\r\nprevent this danger demands measures of a very different nature: and we\r\nshall proceed to point out these measures; which, had they been applied\r\nin time, would, we humbly conceive, have sufficed to prevent the ruin or\r\nloss of this important concern: and which, if matters are not past\r\nremedy, may yet serve to restore them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n THE TRUE CAUSES OF EVIL AND ABUSE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, AND THE\r\n                         MEANS TO REMEDY THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying that, the cause of an evil being known, the remedy\r\nis readily discovered; and, upon the strength of this maxim, several,\r\nwho think they have hit upon some one cause of evil in the political\r\ngovernment of Bengal, have taken upon them to prescribe a remedy; which\r\nis pronounced an universal panacea, a salve for every sore: but no\r\nsooner have they produced their ware, than the eye hath discovered it to\r\nbe mere powder of post; or something equally unavailing.\r\n\r\nFew of these prescriptions have at all attracted notice; the proposal\r\nfor protecting the liberty of the subject from the despotism of\r\ngovernment, by the institution of native juries, was indeed extremely\r\nwell calculated to please British speculation; and therefore, like the\r\ndevice of hanging the bell about the cat’s neck, it was highly applauded\r\nby those who never adverted to the difference betwixt Britain and\r\nBengal, in point of general constitution of government and disposition\r\nof the natives. But, for practice, it must appear a mere chimera to such\r\nas consider, on the one hand, that men, who are slaves to their\r\ngovernment and its officers in every other capacity, cannot possibly be\r\nfree in that of jurymen; and that juries, if they are not free and\r\nimpartial, avail nothing: and, on the other hand, that if the natives\r\nshould be actually endowed with the real cap of liberty in the jury\r\nroom, there is danger, nay, there is a certainty, that they would make\r\nbold to wear it elsewhere; and then, adieu to the English dominion in\r\nBengal. In few words, the power of the English government, and the\r\nfreedom of native juries, are two things that cannot possibly exist\r\ntogether in Bengal; the life of the one must unavoidably cause the death\r\nof the other: and, however harsh this doctrine may sound in a freeborn\r\nEnglish ear, the force and truth of it will immediately strike the\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nEqually unavailing is that proposal for securing the liberty and\r\nproperty of the subject, from the oppression and extortion of\r\ngovernment, by granting to the native a perpetual property in land;\r\nwithout providing him the smallest security for the free possession of\r\nits produce; which, so long as government stands on its present footing,\r\nis liable to be wrested from him so soon as acquired.\r\n\r\nBut it would seem, that the reason why these political physicians have\r\nbeen so unlucky in their prescriptions is, that they have proceeded upon\r\nfalse principles; as having mistaken the nature of the malady. For they\r\nhave either assigned no one certain cause of evil; or else they have\r\ntraced it no farther than to the persons who have executed the\r\ngovernment of those countries, otherwise to the Directors: as if all the\r\nevil had proceeded from some particular viciousness in their\r\ndisposition, as if they had been sinners above all men, or as if no men\r\nwould have done the wicked deed but they: whereas he who is the least\r\nacquainted with human nature will allow, that few, if any men, would\r\nhave made any better use of their powers and opportunities; nay he will\r\nadd, that every other government on earth, would act the very part that\r\nthis Bengal government hath done, provided it held the same views and\r\ninterests, together with the same powers and opportunities. And, if so,\r\nwhat can be more absurd, than the proposal to remedy the evils and\r\nabuses of this government, by sending out Supervisors, with the same or\r\ngreater powers, and consequently possessing greater opportunities of\r\npromoting their own views and interests; which are exactly the same as\r\nthese of the persons complained of; seeing that, as the same cause of\r\nevil which existed in the Governors, would have existed in the\r\nSupervisors, these similar causes must have operated similar effects.\r\n\r\nIndeed we shall err widely, if we look for the original cause of evil in\r\nthese Governors: for, on inspecting the preceding description of this\r\nBengal government, we perceive, that their maladministration is itself\r\nbut an effect, or consequence, naturally flowing from the total want of\r\ncertain fundamental principles or powers; which, in every other\r\ngovernment, serve to restrain the party governing from doing or\r\npermitting injury, and impel it to promote the good of the party\r\ngoverned: and as the want of these restraining and impelling powers hath\r\nunavoidably produced, the first tyranny, and the latter anarchy, it is\r\nplain, that all the evils and abuses in the government of Bengal have\r\nsprung from this deficiency. It farther appears, from the same\r\ndescription, that the want of these restraining and impelling powers\r\narises from two different causes; the first being the particular\r\ncondition and constitution of the sovereign: and the second is there\r\ntermed the distance of situation, betwixt the sovereign residence and\r\nthe country governed; tho’ the sequel will evince this latter to be\r\nrather a radical defect in the nature of that system, which the\r\nDirectors have adopted for the government of this distant dominion. That\r\nthese have been the two original causes of the tyranny and anarchy, and\r\nconsequently of all the evils and abuses in this Bengal government,\r\nincluding these of the commercial despotism, is sufficiently evident. We\r\nshall therefore proceed to point out the means of removing these causes,\r\nas the only effectual method of remedying the evils. And as each of the\r\ntwo causes hath contributed its proper share of the evil, and each\r\ndemands a distinct remedy, we shall consider them separately.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the condition and constitution of the Company, we have\r\nalready mentioned the several circumstances that disqualify her for the\r\noffice of a supreme sovereign; here therefore we shall only\r\nrecapitulate, or collect them into one point of view. The first defect\r\nis, her impotence, or want of power to promote good government in her\r\ndominion: and this proceeds from her being, with respect to her deputed\r\ngovernment, a meer fellow subject, totally void of supreme legislative\r\nand judicial powers; and consequently incapable of inforcing obedience;\r\nor of punishing disobedience: and this want of authority and power in\r\nthe sovereign, we have shown to be a principal cause of despotism in the\r\ndeputed government. A second defect in the constitution of the Company\r\nis her want of inclination, or rather of interest, to discharge the duty\r\nof a good sovereign; and this arises from the fluctuating and hourly\r\nmutable state of the proprietary, the temporary and short duration of\r\nher corporate existence, the still shorter tenor of this sovereignty,\r\nand the annual rotation of her executive government; for, in consequence\r\nof these several circumstances in her situation, her views are narrow,\r\ncontracted, and rapacious; the sole aim of all her measures being to\r\nmake the most of the present moment. The third defect is the mercantile\r\ncapacity of this sovereign Company; and from this defect alone flow\r\nevils sufficient to ruin the interest of the country subjected to her\r\ngovernment: for, in consequence of her mercantile capacity, her deputed\r\ngovernment acts as a merchant; and, in consequence of her sovereign\r\ncapacity, all her mercantile servants assume the authority of\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal defects in the being and constitution of this\r\nsovereign Company; and it is evident, that such defects in the\r\nsovereign, must have contributed largely towards the existence of abuse,\r\nin the deputed government. But these defects might have been, in a great\r\nmeasure, remedied, and their consequences prevented, by a simple act of\r\nparliament, past by the national government, at the time it thought\r\nproper to commit the charge of this important branch of national\r\ninterest, to the care of the Company. This act might have been entitled,\r\n“An act for better enabling the East India Company to administer the\r\npolitical government, and to protect, maintain and defend certain states\r\nand countries in India, which have become subjected to the dominion of\r\nBritain, and which, for sundry weighty considerations, it hath been\r\njudged proper to commit to her charge.” And it might have been conceived\r\nin the following, or such like terms.\r\n\r\n“Whereas it appears, that the want of a proper legislative authority\r\nover the ministers and servants, employed by the Company to execute the\r\nsovereign government of these subjected dominions, must be productive of\r\nmany abuses, detrimental as well to the interest of the Company, as to\r\nthe honour and interest of the British nation. Be it enacted by &c.\r\nthat, from the time of passing this act, the Company shall possess the\r\npower of legislation, or making laws, for the government of this foreign\r\ndominion: and the laws thus enacted by the Company, shall be equally\r\nbinding on all her ministers, servants, and subjects, in that dominion,\r\nas are the acts of parliament on the subjects of Britain. And being\r\nfarther sensible of the many inconveniences, that must arise from the\r\nCompany’s incapacity of punishing the offences committed by her\r\nministers, and servants abroad, otherwise than by applying to courts of\r\njustice that are foreign to her government; where she cannot convict,\r\nthrough the difficulty of obtaining the evidence required by the forms\r\nof these courts; and where she is deterred from prosecuting, by the fear\r\nof divulging the secrets of her government; insomuch that, rather than\r\napply to these courts, she must submit to the most audacious acts of\r\ndisobedience, and maladministration; and considering that such\r\nincapacity in the Company must discourage all good government, and\r\nproduce tyranny and anarchy in this dominion; be it enacted, that the\r\nCompany shall have authority to erect courts of justice, and appoint\r\njudges; with the like powers, as are vested in his majesty’s judges, and\r\ncourts of judicature, for trying and judging all suits and causes, or\r\noffences committed within the limits of this Indian dominion; and for\r\npunishing the same, either capitally, or by fine, imprisonment, and\r\nbanishment, though to Europe only. And whereas it is probable, that some\r\nof the ministers or servants of the Company may, by various methods,\r\nelude the justice of her courts abroad, and escape to Europe; in order\r\ntherefore to prevent such dangerous illusion of justice, it is enacted,\r\nthat the Company’s court of directors shall, on due information being\r\nmade to them, have power at all times to call before them such escaping\r\ndelinquents, and to try and punish them, for the offences they may have\r\ncommitted within the limits of this Indian dominion, in like manner as\r\nthey could have been tried or punished by the Company’s courts abroad.\r\nAnd because the liberty of appealing from the Company’s courts of\r\njustice, to the judgment of any other courts, must be productive of the\r\nsame inconveniences to the Company, as a trial of the same cause in the\r\nfirst instance would have been, and must therefore deter the Company\r\nfrom ever availing herself of the judicial powers granted by this act;\r\nit is enacted, that delinquents shall have no liberty of appealing from\r\nthe Company’s courts abroad, excepting to the Court of Directors at\r\nhome, or to a general court of Proprietors; whose judgment in all such\r\ncases shall be final. And as the Court of Directors have, and may be,\r\ndiscouraged, from prosecuting or punishing the crimes of their rich\r\nservants, by the fear of danger to their own private interest, from a\r\ncombination of the friends and abettors of such rich delinquents at a\r\nfuture annual election, be it enacted, that the 24 Directors, being such\r\nat the time of passing this act, shall continue in office, _durante\r\nvita_.\r\n\r\n“And whereas it appears, that the liberty of daily selling,\r\ntransferring, and alienating the shares in the Company’s stock, of which\r\nthis sovereign dominion forms a part, tends to infuse into the\r\nproprietors a spirit of rapacity, that may be productive of much damage\r\nto the several interests concerned; and hath many other very pernicious\r\nconsequences; whilst it reflects disgrace on the dignity of all other\r\nsovereigns; be it enacted, that no proprietor in this Company’s stock,\r\nof which the sovereignty forms a part, shall have power to send his\r\nshare in the said sovereignty to market, like as it were a hog or\r\nbullock, and to sell, transfer, and alienate the same; but that the\r\nseveral proprietors of this stock and sovereignty, being such at the\r\ntime of passing this act, shall remain and continue proprietors, without\r\nthe power of alienation, except in the cases that shall be hereafter\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\n“And whereas it hath been represented that the Company’s holding this\r\nsovereignty by lease, and for a short term, may not only alienate her\r\ncare and prevent her from studying and promoting the lasting welfare of\r\nthe country, but may induce her to pillage, plunder and waste it; be it\r\nenacted, that the Company shall hold the sovereignty of this dominion,\r\n_quamdiu se bene gesserit_; to the end, that she may consider and treat\r\nit, not as the property of another, but as her own inheritance.\r\n\r\n“And whereas the Company exercises traffic in this dominion; and, in\r\nconsequence thereof, her ministers do likewise traffic; and whereas the\r\nexercise of traffic is evidently repugnant to a due discharge of the\r\nduties of government, as being unavoidably productive of destructive\r\nmonopolies and oppression; all which it is impossible to prevent, so\r\nlong as the Company herself shall continue a merchant; be it enacted,\r\nthat this Company’s commercial charter shall be dissolved; and she, and\r\nher ministers, shall be restrained from trading or trafficking, directly\r\nor indirectly, within the limits of this Indian dominion, under certain\r\npenalties to be mentioned in a new charter, which shall be granted to\r\nthis Company, constituting her the United Company of English East India\r\nSovereigns.”\r\n\r\nThese powers, grants, limitations, and restrictions, would have\r\nqualified the Company, so far as the nature of things could admit, for\r\nadministring the political government; but, in her military capacity, as\r\nthe sovereign protector, maintainer and defender of this Indian\r\ndominion, she hath been still less qualified, and would therefore have\r\nrequired still more extraordinary powers. These however we shall not\r\nspecify, as apprehending, that what hath been already demanded will\r\nshock. The grant of supreme legislative and judicial powers to subjects,\r\nover their fellow subjects, must seem an absurd communication of that\r\nwhich is incommunicable: the prohibition of selling and transferring the\r\nshares of stock, would be termed a tyrannical restraint on private\r\nproperty: the perpetual grant of this sovereignty to the Company, must\r\nbe deemed an unjust alienation of the Crown’s and Nation’s rights: and\r\nthe dissolution of the Company’s commercial charter, would alter her\r\nvery being and nature. In short, if we regard the proposed act simply,\r\nit will appear a collection of absurd inconsistencies, and ridiculous\r\nnonsense: but if we consider it conjunctly with the cause or purpose for\r\nwhich it is required, then every absurdity vanishes from the act, and\r\ncenters in the cause that renders it necessary. For we appeal to common\r\nsense, whether every circumstance, specified in this proposed act, is\r\nnot indispensably necessary, to qualify the Company for the sovereign\r\noffice of administring the political government of this Indian dominion:\r\nand, if that necessity is admitted, then doth the act become a rational\r\nand necessary consequence, of government’s having previously committed\r\nthat sovereign charge to the Company. Nay, we must take the liberty to\r\nadd, that government, by committing such a charge to the Company, and at\r\nsame time totally neglecting to capacitate her for supporting it, is in\r\na great measure accessory to all the ruinous consequences that have\r\nensued from her incapacity.\r\n\r\nI am sensible it will be urged, that we proceed upon false premises; for\r\nthat government never considered these countries as subjected to the\r\ndominion of Britain; that it never granted the sovereignty of them to\r\nthe Company; nor supposed her to be the sovereign; but that it only\r\nacquiesced in her holding the Dewanny, on condition of her paying a part\r\nof the revenues to the nation; and, of consequence, that government\r\nnever considered the inhabitants of those countries as subjects to the\r\ngovernment of Britain. But this is a most flimsy evasion, like that of\r\nshutting our eyes to the sun, that we may deny it is day: government\r\ngranted to the Company a right or permission to hold the Dewanny; which\r\nis explained to be, the power of collecting and appropriating the\r\nrevenues of Bengal; and, in consideration of this grant, government\r\ndemanded and received a share of these revenues; government therefore,\r\nin its legislative capacity, admits a knowledge, that the Company did\r\npossess the power of collecting, and also of applying the revenues of\r\nBengal, _ad libitum_; and, amongst other purposes, to that of defraying\r\nthe charges of the military, as well as the civil, government: and\r\ngovernment well knows, that the power which defrays the charges of the\r\nmilitary and civil government, must hold the absolute direction of both:\r\nand what constitutes sovereign power, but the absolute direction of the\r\nmilitary and civil government, together with the disposal of the\r\nrevenues? But, exclusive of the Dewanny contract, the Company hath\r\napplied, in every other characteristic of a sovereign, to government, in\r\nits legislative capacity: she hath brought a bill into parliament, for\r\nthe grant of certain military powers and indulgences, for the better\r\nenabling her to defend, what she there modestly, though vaguely, terms\r\nher territorial acquisitions, (but which, by referring to the Dewanny\r\ncontract, is explained to include Bengal): and she hath applied for\r\ncertain juridical powers and grants, for the better administration of\r\nthe jurisdiction, not in her commercial factories, but over the whole\r\ncountry of Bengal: therefore government hath been informed, in its\r\nlegislative capacity, by the Company herself, that she administred the\r\nmilitary and civil government, and appropriated the revenues of Bengal;\r\nconsequently that she was, in every sense and respect, the actual\r\nsovereign of that country.\r\n\r\nNow government could not be ignorant that the Company is a subject to\r\nthe national government of Britain; and that, as such, she could have\r\nneither right, power, nor force to subject this dominion, or afterwards\r\nto hold it in subjection, saving what she derived from the national\r\ngovernment; consequently government, as it understood that these\r\ncountries were subjected to the Company, must have known that they were\r\nsubjected to the dominion of Britain. And as government did permit the\r\nCompany to retain this dominion; and furnished her with a military\r\nforce, knowing it to be for the purpose of maintaining dominion, it is\r\nplain, that the Company hath held this dominion, no otherwise than by\r\nthe grant and support of government.\r\n\r\nBut if the Company be the sovereign of Bengal, the inhabitants must,\r\n_per_ force, be her subjects; and if the Company holds this sovereignty\r\nas a subject to the government of Britain, by virtue of the grant or\r\npermission of that government, and by means of a force furnished by the\r\nsame government, in what relation can this government regard the\r\ninhabitants of Bengal? In that of subjects surely; tho’ the degree hath,\r\nby the deed of government, been somewhat implicated; like that of a\r\nchild begot by the father upon his own daughter. And subjects they have\r\nbeen to the government of Britain, in every sense and meaning; they have\r\nyielded obedience to those subjects of this government whom it appointed\r\nto rule over them; and they have yielded the fruits, as well as the\r\nduties of obedience.\r\n\r\nBut the government of Britain, which hath thus by force subjected the\r\ninhabitants of Bengal to its dominion; which hath, for a series of\r\nyears, held them in subjection; and hath, all along, exacted from them\r\nthe tribute of subjection; hath withheld from them the protection due to\r\nsubjects. For it hath scrupulously withdrawn itself from all regard or\r\nattention to their government; and hath left it implicitly to the\r\nguidance of a few merchants; whom it knew to be perfectly unqualified\r\nfor administring any sort of government: in consequence of which these\r\nwretched people have, for many years, been ruled, without law, justice,\r\nor government. Unhappy subjects, who are forced to obey a sovereign that\r\nrefuses them protection, and leaves them exposed to all the horrors of\r\ntyranny and anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt will nevertheless be still insisted that government could not,\r\nwithout committing a number of irregularities and absurdities, endow the\r\nCompany in the manner specified; as also that the Company, when thus\r\nendowed, would still have been altogether unequal to the charge of\r\nregularly administring a sovereign government. But surely government, if\r\nit would not or could not capacitate the Company to regularly govern\r\nthose countries, ought not to have furnished her the means of\r\noppressing, ravaging, pillaging, and ruining them; to the disgrace of\r\nhumanity, and the indelible reproach of the British name. Government\r\nwould have acted a part far more consistent with the rules of honour and\r\nhumanity, if, instead of furnishing to the Company this military power,\r\nit had restrained her from availing herself of the advantage, gained by\r\nforce and chance, over that mild, unwarlike, but industrious people; and\r\nobliged her to leave them to their own government.\r\n\r\nBut then the situation of affairs in those countries, where the nation\r\nand Company held such a valuable commercial interest, rendered it highly\r\nimproper and dangerous to leave the native government to itself:\r\nmoreover the nation and Company could not, in such case, have acquired\r\nthe mighty wealth and other benefits that have been derived from the\r\nconquest, or assumed dominion, of those countries. Oh wealth, basely\r\nacquired, and foolishly applied! Was there then no medium, no middle\r\nchannel, thro’ which government might have steered the Nation and\r\nCompany to this same wealth and benefits, clear of all these\r\nirregularities, incongruities, inhumanities, and reproaches? Yes surely;\r\nand one so obvious and conspicuous, that it is impossible to conceive\r\nhow government could be so industrious as to shun or miss it. Had the\r\nnational government taken upon itself the charge of superintending the\r\ngovernment of those countries, as reason and the nature of things\r\ndirected, then would it have furnished them a sovereign, naturally free\r\nfrom all the defects of the Company, and completely endued with all the\r\nqualifications of power, ability, and inclination from interest, to\r\nprotect and regularly govern them.\r\n\r\nFor it is plain, that the national government, possessing supreme\r\nlegislative, and judicial power, must have been capable of enforcing\r\nobedience to the laws which it might have enacted for the good\r\ngovernment of those countries; and of punishing disobedience, not only\r\nin the natives, but in the ministers whom it would have employed to\r\nexecute that government; as these must have been its own subjects. And,\r\non the other hand, the nation being an immutable body, and holding this\r\nsovereignty in her own right, and by perpetual tenor; her government\r\nmust have been actuated, by the strong motive of self interest, to exert\r\nitself in promoting the real and lasting welfare of those countries. And\r\nas to the commercial despotism, it could never have existed under the\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows, that the national government, being perfectly free\r\nfrom all the defects of the Company, would, by the simple, natural, and\r\nrational act of assuming the administration of government in those\r\ncountries, have prevented or reformed all the several abuses or evils\r\nthat have sprung from the defective constitution of the Company, as\r\nsovereign. But besides the mighty reform of abuses, that must have been\r\nimmediately caused by thus changing the person of the sovereign; there\r\nis another advantage, which, though it cannot be said to spring directly\r\nfrom that change, yet would it have ensued as a natural consequence of\r\nthe national government’s taking upon itself this sovereign charge; and\r\nthat is, the creation or institution of a new interest in that country;\r\na sort of middle state, betwixt the native subjects and their foreign\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe middle state here meant is the East India Company, (or which is the\r\nsame, her servants in Bengal;) which, being now reduced to the condition\r\nof a subject, tho’ still retaining all her commercial privileges and\r\ninterests in that country, would have formed an intermediate link in the\r\npolitical chain, serving to connect the natives with their government,\r\nand government with the natives. For, in every one circumstance that\r\nrespected the liberty of the subject, this middle state must have held\r\nprecisely the same interest as the natives; and, in consequence, the\r\nsame inclination to oppose all oppression of government: and, in every\r\nthing that respected the real interest, the power, or honour of the\r\nsovereign, the community of _Natale Solum_ must have led it to support\r\nthe measures of government. Therefore, this middle state, holding a\r\ngreat weight in that dependent dominion, (not indeed from its numbers,\r\nbut from the powerful support and influence of the Company, which would\r\nhave been still very respectable in the sovereign country,) must have\r\ncarried a mighty poise into the scale of liberty, in opposition to the\r\ndespotism of government; whilst, at same time, it would have created no\r\ndanger to the power of the sovereign. And a middle state of this nature\r\nmust have been of inexpressible utility; facilitating, in many respects,\r\nthe establishment of a regular political œconomy\r\n\r\nin the government of these countries. For, in such case, the sovereign\r\ncould, with propriety, efficacy, and safety, have conferred every\r\nreasonable privilege on the whole body of subjects in this foreign\r\ndominion: seeing that the exertion of these privileges might have been\r\nartfully confined to this middle state: and, as on the one hand, this\r\nfinesse would not have, in any shape, withheld the benefit of these\r\nprivileges from the natives; but, on the contrary, would have rendered\r\nthem more effectually useful to the whole body of subjects, than if they\r\nhad been committed either entirely or in common to the natives; because\r\nthe Company’s servants would, from interest, have had the same\r\ninclination as the natives, to exert these privileges for the common\r\ngood; and they would have had infinitely greater power, from their\r\nsuperior activity, intrepidity, and firmness, as also from their\r\nsuperior opportunities of obtaining redress elsewhere against any\r\ninfringement made by government: so, on the other hand, the authority of\r\nthe sovereign could have incurred no risk from these privileges in the\r\nhands of Europeans; whereas there is great danger in attempting to\r\nconfer on the natives a power to controul even the despotism of\r\ngovernment. With this middle state the power of juries would have been\r\neffectual to the subject, and harmless to the sovereign: however, we\r\nshall have occasion to be more particular on this head in the sequel.\r\n\r\nBut if the national government could, by taking this sovereign charge\r\nupon itself, have prevented or reformed these many evils and abuses that\r\nhave arisen from the defects of the Company; and could have likewise\r\ncreated other such advantages, facilitating the establishment of a\r\nregular government in those countries; what reason can be assigned for\r\ngovernment’s declining this charge, and devolving it on the Company?\r\nGovernment could not surely suppose that this important concern would be\r\nmanaged to greater national advantage by the Company, than by itself:\r\nseeing that common sense might have foreseen, what experience hath since\r\nproved, that, under the management of the Company, the interest of\r\nBritain in those countries would, in the space of a very few years, be\r\ncompletely annihilated; that the countries themselves would either be\r\ncompletely ruined, or otherwise lost to enemies; and that the wealth,\r\nwhich was extorted from them by rapine and general havoc, being imported\r\ninto Britain in the hands of a few indiscreet individuals, would create\r\na torrent of profusion, extravagance, luxury, and prodigality, that\r\nwould sweep all before it into the gulf of bankruptcy, perdition, and\r\ndespair. Whereas, under the regular administration of national\r\ngovernment, those countries might have been still preserved in a\r\nflourishing condition; and, in consequence, still capable of yielding to\r\nBritain a tribute little inferior to the surplus revenue which the\r\nCompany received in the first year of the Dewanny: which tribute,\r\narriving immediately at the public treasury of Britain, and being there\r\napplied to the diminution of taxes, and consequent reduction of the\r\nprice of necessaries and labour, would have proved a gentle universal\r\nshower, reviving our decayed and drooping manufactures and commerce.\r\n\r\nBut neither could government be induced to confer this sovereignty on\r\nthe Company, by any motive of regard to the true interest of the\r\nproprietors: seeing it was palpably evident that this charge, being so\r\nunmeasurably superior to her powers of supporting it, must unavoidably\r\ncrush her to ruin, and, along with her, the countries subjected to her\r\nrule; and, it is to be feared, even that community of which she forms a\r\npart. Whereas, if the national government had taken into its own hands,\r\nand carefully administered the government of those countries, whilst it\r\ncontinued the Company in possession of her commercial privileges, she\r\nwould have continued to divide, in the first place, the six per cent.\r\nwhich her commerce, (unaided by revenue) afforded; even when burdened\r\nwith the necessary expence of a small military force maintained for the\r\nguard of that commerce in those foreign countries, and which must have\r\nbeen equal to four per cent. on her capital: but this commercial\r\nmilitary expence being rendered in a great measure unnecessary, by the\r\nimmediate protection of national government, the saving thereof would\r\nhave added two per cent. to her dividend: and the equivalent, which\r\ngovernment would have paid for her fortresses, munition, &c. being added\r\nto her capital stock, would have encreased her dividend nearly one per\r\ncent. more; whilst her stock itself would, at this day, have been\r\nreally, and intrinsically worth 220 l. instead of ........ its present\r\nreal and intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nIt would be insulting the understanding of ministry, to suppose that it\r\nhad been restrained from assuming this sovereign charge, by any delicacy\r\nof regard to the ideal right of the Company; derived from either\r\nconquests, as subjects; or from the sham grant of a man, who had not\r\npower to dispose of a single bega of land, nay, not of a cocoa-nut-tree\r\nin that country; and consequently whose grant of the sovereignty of\r\nBengal could contribute nothing more to investiture or possession, than\r\nhis grant of the crown of Britain could. Though if we should (for the\r\nsake of argument) suppose, that ministry had really admitted some such\r\nright, we must still esteem its acquiescence in that right a most absurd\r\nand wildly mistaken indulgence; seeing it evidently tended to the ruin\r\nof the party whom it meant to favour.\r\n\r\nThere hath been, however, one weighty argument against government’s\r\nassuming this Indian charge, which is, the danger arising to national\r\nliberty from government’s, (or, in other words, the crown or ministry’s)\r\nacquiring such an accession of influence, as must arise from the\r\npossession of the many emoluments, places, posts, &c. annexed to this\r\nIndian charge: whereas liberty is completely secured from such danger,\r\nwhilst the Company possesses it. And the certainty of this double maxim,\r\nviz. the danger from government’s possessing this charge, and the\r\nsecurity whilst it is in the hands of the Company, is as generally\r\nestablished as almost any one human principle: for, being violently\r\nenforced by those whose personal views lead them to oppose\r\nadministration, and at same time not simply allowed, but even inculcated\r\nby ministry itself, it hath been readily credited by those who, their\r\npersonal interest not being so deeply concerned, were less curious to\r\ninvestigate the truth.\r\n\r\nIt may be deemed presumptuous in an individual, to question the\r\northodoxy of a maxim so powerfully enforced by one party, readily\r\nallowed by the other, and almost universally credited: tho’ the\r\nextraordinary circumstance, of two violent rival parties concurring so\r\nexactly on a point, where their personal interest seems to be so\r\nmaterially and so oppositely engaged, would lead a bystander to suppose,\r\nthat either one of the two parties must be mistaken; or otherwise, that\r\none or both must misrepresent: at any rate, that uncommon instance of\r\ncandour, in ministry’s preaching up a doctrine so repugnant to that\r\nwhich it pretends to be its own personal interest, would induce such\r\nbystander to suspect its sincerity. However, as a right understanding of\r\nthis point may considerably import the public, at this critical\r\njuncture, I shall venture disclosing my sentiments, at the risk of\r\ncensure for prolixity, as well as impertinence.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first part of the maxim, I conceive that the danger\r\nto liberty, from government’s holding this charge in its own hands, is\r\nsupposed to arise from the influence which the minister would acquire,\r\nover the two subject branches of legislature, (those bulwarks of\r\nliberty) by means of the many emoluments, places, posts, &c. annexed to\r\nthe possession of that charge. But before we admit that the ministers\r\nholding this charge would be creative of that dangerous influence, we\r\nought to be satisfied that he doth not already possess it, by other\r\nmeans; for, if he doth already possess such influence by other means, it\r\nis plain that the Indian charge cannot confer it; nor will it avail to\r\nshut one door, whilst there are others open to admit him. And that the\r\nminister hath long been in full and plenary possession of such\r\ninfluence, we have ever heard asserted by these very men who so loudly\r\nenforce the danger of his acquiring it, by means of this Indian charge:\r\nnay, we have much better authority than their contradictory assertions,\r\n(even that of fact and daily experience,) for believing that the\r\nminister hath and doth possess posts and places, and that, on any\r\nemergency, he hath in his power other means equally effectual, towards\r\ncreating and holding such influence, in a degree as plenary and complete\r\nas his own heart can desire. And, if the minister doth already possess\r\nsuch influence by other means, it is plain, that the Indian charge\r\ncannot confer it; nor will it avail to shut one door, whilst there are\r\nothers open to admit him. And that the minister hath been long in full\r\nand plenary possession of such influence, we have ever heard asserted by\r\nthose very men, who so loudly enforce the danger of his acquiring it, by\r\nmeans of this Indian charge: nay, we have much better authority than\r\ntheir contradictory assertions, (even that of fact and daily\r\nexperience,) for believing that the minister hath and doth possess posts\r\nand places, and that on any emergency he hath in his power other means\r\nequally effectual, towards creating and holding such influence, in a\r\ndegree as plenary and complete as his own heart can desire. And, if the\r\nminister doth already possess an influence so fully sufficient, it must\r\nbe allowed that, in so much as respects parliamentary influence, this\r\nIndian charge would be a thing superfluous and useless to him; like meat\r\nto a man that hath already filled his belly; the absence of it can\r\nwithhold nothing that he wants, and the acquisition cannot confer more\r\nthan he already possesses. I may venture to add, that we certainly hold\r\nour liberty by some latent security, more powerful than that of\r\nparliament itself, which neither the minister’s influence over\r\nparliament, nor posts and places, will ever induce him to attack, or\r\nenable him to subdue; for that, otherwise, we should have been divested\r\nof our privileges and liberty long ago. And, upon considering these\r\nseveral circumstances, I conclude, that if this Indian charge was in the\r\nhands of government to-morrow, it would neither enable, nor induce the\r\nminister, to attempt a jot more against our liberty, than he hath done,\r\ncan do, and will do, without it. However, by way of reinforcing my\r\nargument, I shall add that, if the plan which I mean to propose should\r\nbe carried into execution, it would leave but few of these emoluments,\r\n&c. to the immediate disposal of the minister; and, possibly, this\r\ndeclaration may but little recommend it to his favour.\r\n\r\nBut still, if we were to admit a real danger to liberty from the\r\nminister’s possessing these emoluments, &c. it remains to be proved that\r\nliberty hath been, is, and will be secured from such danger, by the\r\nCompany’s holding that Indian charge. And, when the nature of this\r\nsecurity comes to be examined, I apprehend it will be found more\r\ndifficult to prove this latter part of the maxim, than the former. For\r\nit is notorious that, ever until the late distraction in the Company’s\r\naffairs, the arbitrary application of these emoluments, posts, &c. was\r\nvested in the Directors; and indeed the entire powers and interests of\r\nthe Company; insomuch that the Directors might, with propriety, be\r\ntermed the Company. So that the whole security of national liberty, and,\r\nof course, the sole obstruction to the minister’s dangerous views,\r\ndepended on the integrity and independent spirit of 24 Directors; of\r\nwhom, again, one or two generally leads all the rest. Consequently, to\r\ncome at the fingering of these dangerous emoluments, &c. the minister\r\nhad only to subvert the integrity, or subdue the independance, of these\r\nDirectors. And, to effect this, a minister possessed more than one\r\ninfallible recipe. By artfully joining the mighty influence which he\r\nheld in the Company’s stock thro’ his numerous dependants, to one or\r\nother of two parties contending violently for the direction, he could\r\nreduce both to a perfect dependance on himself: by the same means he\r\ncould hold them in subjection: but still more, by the awe of wresting\r\nfrom them the sweet management of this Indian sovereignty, which they\r\nwere sensible he could do by a word. And thus he could work upon their\r\nfears. But inclination would naturally and powerfully lead the Directors\r\nto throw themselves into the arms of a minister; not so much for his\r\nimmediate assistance; tho’ even that might be of great use, for\r\nrendering matters easy with the proprietors, as well as parliament and\r\nthe nation; but because, on these terms, they secured, in him, an\r\nomnipotent supporter and all powerful advocate, against the day of\r\ndistress, which they well knew must come, and that soon: whereas,\r\notherwise, they must lay their account with finding him a severe judge,\r\nand bitter prosecutor.\r\n\r\nBy these several operations on the hopes and fears of the Directors, it\r\nwas extremely easy for a minister to render them as pliant as a glove;\r\nas obedient as a spaniel, to fetch and carry at bidding. And the\r\nDirectors being once reduced to this state of dependance, it is evident,\r\nthat the minister must possess a full and arbitrary power over all the\r\nemoluments, posts, places, &c. appertaining to this Indian charge. But\r\nthe disposal of the present emoluments, &c. was a trivial matter,\r\ncompared with other advantages, which this Indian business, whilst in\r\nthe hands of the Company, presented to an artful and enterprising\r\nminister. For, under the plausible and indeed undeniable pretext of\r\nqualifying the Company for administring this sovereign charge, he might\r\nhave drawn from the legislature certain military as well as political\r\npowers; which, being gradually augmented as occasion offered, might have\r\nat last established a sort of power, in this government, distinct from\r\nand independent of the legislature: the exertion of which power, being\r\nconfided to the Directors, would in fact have rested with the minister.\r\nHere indeed was a real danger to liberty; provided it had been possible\r\nto hold up this Indian business, in the hands of the Company, for any\r\nlength of time; for, notwithstanding I consider national liberty as\r\ninexpugnable to the open assaults of a minister, yet, from such a secret\r\nconvenient and commanding post as this mentioned, he might have made\r\nfrequent sly and successful incursions on the confines of liberty; which\r\nwould have greatly straitened her quarters, and wasted her strength.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if that Indian charge had been vested in the national\r\ngovernment, liberty must have been perfectly secured from this last\r\nmentioned danger; for, in such case, there could have been no pretext\r\nfor demanding these extraordinary distinct powers; and, consequently, no\r\nopportunity of establishing that truly dangerous _imperium in imperio_.\r\nAnd even in the application of the ordinary powers, emoluments, &c. a\r\nminister must have been subjected to many troublesome checks, and\r\nrestraints. His Majesty, who can have no views distinct from the general\r\ninterest of his people, must have held a principal voice in every\r\nmeasure; as likewise must some others his counsellors. Parliament too\r\nmust have proved an inconvenient restraint on a minister; particularly\r\nin the article of estimates and accounts of revenue, which must have\r\nbeen submitted to its inspection; and notwithstanding the certainty of\r\ncarrying points by a majority of voices, yet, as there will ever be some\r\nrefractory members, these might have carried tales to the public; which,\r\nprovided this charge had been in the hands of national government, would\r\nhave judged itself interested in the affair; and would therefore have\r\ntaken the liberty to criticise his measures, or censure his misconduct.\r\nWhereas, this business being secured, as private property, in the hands\r\nof the Company, king, parliament, and nation were all excluded from\r\nparticipation: the proprietors alone had a right to examine measures or\r\naccounts; and, the majority of them upon all questions being mercenary\r\nretainers to ministry and the direction, they must have ever been a mere\r\n_servile pecus_. So that the business might have been snugly confined to\r\nthree or four ministerial associates, with their faithful dependants in\r\nLeadenhall Street; whilst the minister needed never appear in the\r\naffair; free from care, charge, or trouble; and irresponsible for either\r\nmeasures, or consequences; he might enjoy all the sweets, without the\r\nleast alloy of bitter.\r\n\r\nSure I am if I had been minister, and minded to make a job of this\r\nIndian business, I would certainly have exerted myself most sedulously\r\nto preserve it in the hands of the Company. And, to divert the nation\r\nfrom ever turning her eye towards it, I would have strenuously\r\ninculcated the rights of the Company, national faith, the impossibility\r\nof conducting this business otherwise than through the Company; and,\r\nabove all things, I would, by my emissaries, have alarmed the public,\r\nwith fears of danger to their liberty, should this business ever come\r\ninto the hands of government; whilst, by the same canal, I would have\r\ntrumpeted forth my own candour, disinterestedness as a minister,\r\nindifference to power, and delicate regard to national liberty and\r\nprivate property, in thus disclaiming an object so replete with\r\nministerial advantages, which was within my power. And thus would I have\r\ncontinued the game, until it was up: and then I would have directed the\r\nenquiries, which decency and regard to appearances extorted from me, in\r\nsuch a manner as to suppress, instead of investigating: though, at same\r\ntime, I would have boldly expressed my indignation at the Company’s\r\nmisconduct; and loudly denounced vengeance against the individuals that\r\nhad shared in the plunder; not a soul that was guilty should escape.\r\nAnd, to wind up the whole affair dextrously, I would have tasked my own\r\npowers, and those of my myrmidons, to represent all these Indian\r\nacquisitions as a transitory, casual, and accidental piece of business;\r\nwhich was altogether out of our tract; and which, if the nation had ever\r\nengaged in maintaining them, would have ruined and exhausted her: and so\r\nthe nation was to thank me, for withholding her from ruin.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, I say, would I, who am a reptile, have acted, had I been\r\nminister, and minded to make a job of this business: but I am far from\r\nintimating or insinuating that our ministers, who are men of high birth\r\nand strict honour, could be capable of admitting even a thought of\r\ntaking such base advantages. All that I have said is only meant to show,\r\nthat a minister, if he had the inclination, possessed an infinitely\r\nfairer opportunity, of converting this business to sinister purposes,\r\nwhilst it was in the hands of the Company; than he possibly could have\r\nhad, from the same business, under the conduct of national government.\r\nAnd, from thence, I would infer that, had this business been in the\r\nhands of government, our liberty, nay and our property too, would have\r\nbeen secured from many dangers, to which they have been exposed, whilst\r\nthis business hath been in the hands of the Company.\r\n\r\nI cannot then conceive what other objections could be started against\r\ngovernment’s taking upon itself the charge of this Indian dominion:\r\nunless it be the old trite arguments of timid sluggish indolence, want\r\nof enterprize, &c. That, the distance of situation rendering it\r\nimpossible for Britain to properly maintain and govern this dominion, it\r\nwould become an object of no true value or importance, but rather a\r\nheavy load exhausting her strength. But it is now more than time for the\r\nnation to recal her faith from men whom she hath sufficient ground to\r\nsuspect of deceit; and, rousing her senses, to take the liberty of\r\ntrying these matters by the standard of her own reason; which we shall\r\nendeavour to aid by the following hints.\r\n\r\nTo properly demonstrate the true value and importance of this Indian\r\ndominion to Britain, would demand a volume; we have, in the first part,\r\npresented a slight sketch of it; here therefore we shall offer only one\r\nor two remarks respecting its importance to our finances; and though we\r\ndo not offer these remarks as the result of exact calculation, yet will\r\nthey serve to throw a light on this subject. Ever since the last war\r\nBritain hath paid annually to foreign creditors, in interest, about\r\n1,500,000 l. and this is paid, not in paper, but all in hard money; or,\r\notherwise, in what is equivalent, the stoppage of so much hard money as\r\nis reckoned to come into Britain by the balance of her trade. On the\r\nother hand, the net specie balance of trade with all the world,\r\n(exclusive of that part which strictly and properly may be termed the\r\nproduce of Indian dominion,) after deducting the imperceptible and\r\nenormous drain of specie made by smuggling, doth not at this day perhaps\r\namount to 800,000 l. The difference then betwixt her numerical specie\r\ndisbursement and receipt in balance of trade, must needs have been made\r\ngood from some other fund than the circulating stock of specie,\r\notherwise circulation must in that number of years have totally ceased.\r\nAnd this fund we need not mention to have been the dominion in India.\r\nEver since 1757, the private fortunes acquired there in consequence of\r\ndominion or conquest, having been remitted either in bills on foreign\r\nIndian companies, or in diamonds, have created an annual influx of\r\nspecie, (or what is equivalent,) to the amount of at least 700,000 l.[1]\r\nThe Company too received since that period, and previous to the Dewanny,\r\nthough by virtue of dominion or conquest, sundry large sums of money;\r\nwhich she invested in merchandize; and, thereby, saved to Britain so\r\nmuch specie as she would, otherwise, have transmitted for the purchase\r\nof such merchandize; and it doth not require demonstration to prove,\r\nthat all such saving is, in every respect, the same as the influx of an\r\nequal sum. And ever from 1765, till some time in 1770, the Company paid\r\nfor all her cargoes, not only in India but in China, with the surplus\r\nrevenue of Bengal: and of course this surplus revenue hath, for that\r\nspace, saved, (which is the same as gained) annually to Britain, the\r\nwhole sums which the Company used to transmit for the purchase of her\r\ncargoes in India and China; and which, on an average, may be reckoned\r\n500,000 l. _per annum_: but these cargoes were, from 1765, encreased to\r\nan enormous degree; and if we add only 200,000 l. for such encrease, we\r\nshall find that the surplus revenue of Bengal hath, by the return of\r\ntrade, created an annual influx to Britain of at least 700,000 l. in\r\nspecie: and this, added to the private fortunes, makes 1,400,000 l.\r\nreceived yearly by Britain, from Indian dominion.\r\n\r\nBut, for these two years past, the ruinous situation of those countries,\r\nand the consequent deficiency of revenue, hath obliged the Company to\r\neither transmit money from Europe, or otherwise to borrow money abroad,\r\non bill or bond, for the purchase of all her cargoes in India as well as\r\nChina: and the Company, by thus borrowing, for the purchase of cargoes,\r\nand even the expence of her government, hath absorbed the private\r\nfortunes, which, till then, had been transmitted to Britain, by bills on\r\nforeign companies. We must therefore perceive, without descending to\r\ntedious investigation, that the ruined state of those countries, having\r\ncut off surplus revenue, hath, for these two years past, diminished the\r\nannual influx to Britain from Indian dominion, at least one half, or\r\n700,000 l. And this diminution of influx, whilst our drain continues the\r\nsame, we already begin to feel in our circulation: though this felt\r\neffect is not yet traced up to its cause. Of what mighty importance then\r\nmust this Indian dominion have been, to the circulation of Britain: when\r\nthis circulation feels severely, from only two years partial deprivation\r\nof the benefit formerly derived from that dominion? And what effect must\r\na total deprivation of that benefit operate, in a few years, on this\r\ncirculation; whilst, we are continuing to pay to our foreign creditors\r\nabout 1,500,000 l. _per annum_ in numerical specie; exclusive of other\r\nless noted drains, which, it is most probable mount it up much higher?\r\nAnd yet it is evident, that Britain must, unavoidably, be deprived of\r\nthis whole benefit, so soon as she shall lose her dominion in India;\r\nwhether that loss shall be caused by enemies, or by the ruin of the\r\ncountries subjected. Nay, by losing the dominion of Bengal singly, she\r\nmust not only incur a deprivation of almost the whole dominion benefit;\r\nbut she must likewise lose by far the most valuable part of that\r\ncommerce, which was carried on by the Company with those countries,\r\nprevious to dominion. For the commerce with Bengal, alone, is of much\r\ngreater value, than that with all the rest of India: and, as to the\r\ntrade with China, it is the most pernicious and losing trade to the\r\nnation; however convenient it may be to government.\r\n\r\nAnd if we shall then advert to the benefit and support which the\r\nfinances of Britain have received from this Indian dominion, for so many\r\nyears past, though under the most preposterous management; but, still\r\nmore, if we shall advert to the nature and degree of benefit that, under\r\nproper management, might have been derived _in perpetuum_ from this\r\nIndian dominion, in not only the article of finance, but in other\r\nweighty respects: and, if we shall, yet farther, look forward to the\r\ndismal consequences that must unavoidably ensue to Britain in these\r\nseveral respects, from a deprivation of this Indian dominion and its\r\nbenefits; can we tamely surrender our reason to the _ipse dixit_ of men\r\nwho are hardy enough to tell us, that Indian dominion is of no value nor\r\nutility to Britain.\r\n\r\nNor do these men less abuse our understanding, by holding forth the\r\ndifficulty of maintaining and defending this dominion: seeing that, of\r\nall nations in the world, Britain is, by a variety of circumstances, the\r\nbest qualified to maintain and defend maritime or commercial dominion in\r\nIndia. For, as she exceeds all the world in naval force, she is, through\r\nthat circumstance alone, the most capable of defending such dominion,\r\nagainst the assault of European enemies: and had Britain availed herself\r\nof evident advantages, had she established her naval and land defence\r\nupon the plan that shall be explained, British dominion in India might,\r\nat this day, have been secured from even the attempt of European rivals:\r\nthey might have admired and envied, but they would not have dared to\r\nattack. And these European rivals are the only dangerous enemies to\r\nBritish dominion in India: for as to the neighbouring native powers,\r\nthey would, from fear as well as inclination, have been amicable to\r\nBritain; provided her government in those countries had acted with\r\ncommon honesty, and common decorum, or prudence; and not as common\r\nrobbers. And, as to the unhappy native subjects themselves, their\r\nloyalty hath been sufficiently proved, by so many years patient\r\nsubmission to the most intolerable of all possible governments. Wherein\r\nthen consists the difficulty of maintaining and defending British\r\ndominion in India?\r\n\r\nAnd with regard to the so much talked of expence or drain of native\r\nstrength, we may surely, with good reason, say that this objection\r\nmilitated much stronger against maintaining that dominion under the\r\nCompany, than under national government: tho’ the nature and extent of\r\neven that drain under the Company, is most grossly misrepresented. For I\r\nam well informed that the Company’s annual recruit, since the time she\r\ncompleted her dominion force, hath never exceeded 1200 men; and I am\r\nafraid it hath in general fallen short of 1000; notwithstanding she\r\nlaboured under many disadvantages, from which national government would\r\nbe exempted: such as being obliged to put up with very indifferent and\r\nunhealthy recruits, for want of better; too little attention paid to the\r\nmanner of transporting them; and still less to their health and manner\r\nof living in the country: whilst her governors expended numbers of them\r\non unnecessary predatory wars. And even this recruit we are not to\r\nreckon a drain of real strength from Britain: seeing that, the Company’s\r\nrecruits have been mostly fellows of the most desperate circumstances,\r\nwho had no means of subsisting at home; and who therefore would, if the\r\nCompany had not taken them off, have been taken off by the gallows, or\r\notherwise would have emigrated to America or some other country, in\r\nsearch of bread; and would thus have been equally lost to Britain. So\r\nthat, upon rationally considering this matter, we shall find that, for\r\nthe maintenance of dominion in India, the Company hath not drained this\r\ncountry, of 100 men annually, that could, in any sense, be termed\r\nuseful, or a real strength to it. But, setting aside the precedent of\r\nthe Company, it is certain that, to maintain and defend the mighty\r\ndominion of Bengal, demands an European force very little superior in\r\nnumber to the garrison of that barren fortress Gibraltar: and to\r\nmaintain and defend the whole territorial possessions, together with the\r\ncommerce of Britain in India, requires a force very little exceeding the\r\naforesaid garrison with that of its filler fortress in Minorca. And the\r\nannual recruit, necessary to keep up this force, after allowing largely\r\nfor climate, and every other circumstance, would, on a complete plan of\r\ndefence, not exceed 900 or at most 1000 men: and, of this recruit, at\r\nleast 200, would be wanted annually to maintain commerce, if there was\r\nno dominion. Nay, if this is judged too great a drain for Britain, one\r\nfourth part of that number may be reduced, by recruiting that proportion\r\nof foreign protestants: such being easily procured; and, in such a low\r\nproportion, they can in no respect be dangerous. And can Britain, regard\r\n6 or 700 men annually as too great a drain, for the maintenance of that\r\nimportant dominion and commerce, which is as one of the capital limbs of\r\nher body; and at same time bestow a nearly equal share of her strength\r\non maintaining these two barren, and I had almost said useless,\r\nfortresses; the pecuniary charge of which she pays out of her proper\r\nfinance, never to return; whilst Indian dominion defrays its own charge.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining objection then to Indian dominion is, the difficulty\r\nof properly governing it. But this difficulty doth not arise, like that\r\nin America, from the indomitably obstinate spirit of the subjects; on\r\nthe contrary, it arises from their over passive or submissive\r\ndisposition, and incapacity of resisting the power of government: and\r\nthis, instead of being an objection, is the most valuable qualification\r\nof a dependent dominion. To remove this difficulty demands no exterior\r\naids, no exertion of powers or force; it depends entirely on the will of\r\nthe sovereign; and a very little art, a very little care, with a little\r\nhonesty, would serve to completely remedy it; as we doubt not to evince.\r\n\r\nIn fine, Bengal, being one of the richest commercial countries is, to\r\nBritain as a commercial nation, the noblest and most truly valuable\r\nacquisition that providence could possibly bestow on her: by the mild\r\ndisposition of its inhabitants it is the most facilely governed and\r\nmaintained; and, by the nature of its situation, it is the most\r\ndefensible foreign dominion on this globe; particularly to Britain which\r\nexcels in naval force. And one may almost venture to say that\r\nprovidence, by throwing Bengal into the arms of Britain, seems to have\r\nintended that this, the richest commercial state in Asia, which, through\r\nthe effeminacy of its inhabitants, is incapable of maintaining its own\r\nindependance, should be subjected to Britain, as being the fittest,\r\nthrough similarity of commercial disposition, interest, and modes, to\r\nproperly govern it; and, through her superiority in naval force, the\r\nbest qualified to defend and protect it from all enemies.\r\n\r\nIn what light then must posterity regard the policy of Britain, during\r\nthe third quarter of the eighteenth century: when it shall find her, in\r\nthe East, slighting and giving up that glorious field, which annually\r\nyielded a golden crop, to be rutted up and trodden down by hogs and\r\nviler beasts: whilst, in the West, she was tugging with all her might,\r\nexerting her utmost study, care and attention, much strength, and more\r\nmoney, on cultivating the sea sands; straining to subdue nature; and\r\nforcing the horse to drink in spite of inclination? Will it not be said,\r\nthat she would have acted a far wiser part, if she had left nature and\r\ntime to slowly operate in America, the effects which they will\r\nunavoidably produce, in spite of all her efforts; and had converted her\r\ncare and attention, to properly govern, and maintain, that noble, rich,\r\nand grateful dependent dominion in India; which, upon such terms, would\r\nhave poured, into her publick treasury, resources, that would have\r\nserved to alleviate her burden of taxes; and, consequently, to reduce\r\nthe price of necessaries, of labour, and of manufactures; which, again,\r\nwould have preserved her commerce, not only with America, but with other\r\ncountries; and would at same time have preserved to her thousands of\r\nindustrious and useful subjects, who, through want of employment, were\r\nforced to emigrate from her to America. And, by the same care and\r\nattention to the government and revenue of that Indian dominion, she\r\nwould have prevented the inundation of eastern profusion and\r\nextravagance; which chiefly contributed to convert this formerly\r\ngraniferous island, into a pasture for horses of parade and stately\r\npride; insomuch that, instead of supplying her neighbours as formerly,\r\nwith some hundred thousand pounds worth of grain annually, she could not\r\nfeed the greatly reduced number of her own inhabitants; nor furnish the\r\nmeans of living to the industrious agricultor, and peasant; who, in\r\nsearch of livelihood, fled from her to America; thereby debilitating her\r\nown best source of strength, and prematurely accelerating the manhood of\r\nthose otherwise infant colonies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there still remains a possibility of retrieving this error\r\nin policy; or at least of preventing a farther encrease of the evils\r\nthat have arisen from it; provided that, in the first place, this Indian\r\ndominion shall still be in our possession: and, in the second place,\r\nthat national government shall, by taking upon itself the charge of\r\nadministring the government thereof, remedy that first and radical cause\r\nof evil and abuse which hath existed under the Company’s government: and\r\nshall, at same time, with honest and sincere intention, spirit and\r\nactivity, apply a proper remedy to that which hath been assigned as the\r\nsecond cause of evil, and the nature of which remedy shall be explained\r\nin the sequel. For, upon such terms, there is no doubt that a regular\r\nsystem of government may be established in that dependent dominion;\r\nunder which it may be restored to its pristine prosperity, nay, it may\r\nbe elevated to a state still more flourishing than it ever knew; and, in\r\nconsequence, to a capacity of yielding a still superior degree of\r\nbenefit to Britain; and in a manner widely different, and truely\r\nsalutary to her.\r\n\r\nBut I must again repeat, that it is vain to expect this reform of evils\r\nfrom the management of the Company; loaded as she is with so many\r\nnatural defects, which it is out of the power of art to remedy,\r\notherwise than by conferring upon her the sovereign government of\r\nBritain, along with that of this dependent dominion. For the execution\r\nof these two sovereign governments is, by the nature of things,\r\ninseparable: it being morally impossible, that any power can execute the\r\nsovereign government of those Indian countries, as a dominion dependent\r\nupon Britain, unless that power shall possess the sovereign execution of\r\ngovernment in Britain.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be still more vain to look for any good from that\r\nextravagant fancy of joining the Company, with government, in this\r\nsovereign charge. What quota of powers, proper to her and wanting to\r\ngovernment, can the Company contribute, to render her a necessary or\r\nuseful associate with government, in this sovereign charge? I doubt not\r\nthat the proposer’s intentions were good and honest: but his scheme\r\nwould be so far from promoting his or any one good purpose, that it\r\nwould produce the very opposite effects. For, instead of checking and\r\ncontrasting, it would serve, in the first place, to furnish, in the\r\nDirectors and their governors, a convenient cloke of excuse to ministry\r\nand its governors, with the nation; whilst ministry and its governors\r\nwould serve the Directors and their governors a like good turn with the\r\nproprietors: they would mutually vouch for and screen each other;\r\nneither would be responsible, and neither would act; and thus, between\r\nstools, &c. in the second place, commercial despotism which, by\r\nseparating the Company from the powers of government and the consequent\r\njealousy of privilege, must have been completely suppressed, would,\r\nunder this double-headed monster, flourish with redoubled vigour: the\r\nnational governors would, by their connection with the Company’s, become\r\nmerchants as well as tyrants; and the Company’s governors would, by\r\ntheir power in the government, continue tyrants as well as merchants:\r\nand thus the candle would burn at both ends. In the third place, the\r\nCompany which, by being excluded from the powers of government, would\r\nhave contributed so essentially in the nature of a middle state to the\r\nestablishment of a regular political system in those countries, must, by\r\nbeing joined in the execution of government, entirely lose that virtue:\r\ninstead of supporting liberty, she would join in promoting tyranny; and\r\nwould still continue a ruinous pest to those countries. Indeed that\r\nstrange partnership of Nation and Co. in this sovereignty business, is a\r\ncure infinitely worse than the disease.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no alternative: if Britain means to preserve the\r\npossession of that mighty benefit derived from dominion and commerce in\r\nIndia; if she means to prevent the absolute ruin of the Company, and her\r\ncreditors; if she hath any regard to the loud cry of oppression sent\r\nforth to her for a series of years, by her numerous wretched subjects in\r\nthose countries; and means to save them from final destruction, she must\r\nfurnish their government with a sovereign, or head, properly qualified\r\nto administer it: for this is the foundation, as well as the crowning of\r\nall good government; it is the center upon which the machine revolves,\r\nfrom which every line issues, and in which every line terminates; it is\r\n_sine qua non_, for without it no regular government can exist. And what\r\nproper sovereign can Britain furnish to that dependent dominion, unless\r\nit be her own sovereign government?\r\n\r\nWe have shown that the nation and her supreme government are perfectly\r\nequal to the charge: to them there is not the smallest difficulty in\r\nsupporting it. Neither is there the smallest difficulty to her executive\r\ngovernment or ministry, provided it shall possess an ordinary share of\r\nspirit, activity, or enterprize; and shall proceed with sincere and\r\nupright intention. For, a regular form of government being once\r\nestablished abroad, and a properly digested office or department formed\r\nat home, the business would go on with great smoothness and facility to\r\nministry.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as I have assumed the liberty of prescribing in this\r\nimportant and almost desperate case, I am sorry, that a sincere regard\r\nto the welfare of the patient should compel me to add, (by way of\r\nconcluding on this head,) that, unless ministry shall act upon a\r\nprinciple, and with a spirit, extremely different from that which it\r\nhath hitherto discovered in this business, it would be much more\r\nadviseable to continue the charge in the hands of the Company: for it\r\ncan be but ruined under her. However, in strong hopes of a melioration\r\nin these respects, which depends altogether on the will of government, I\r\nshall proceed to disclose that plan, which, in the hands of a properly\r\nqualified sovereign, would, I doubt not, serve to establish a regular\r\nsystem of government in India.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  As it is impossible to exactly ascertain the annual amount of this\r\n  private remittance made through various channels, it will no doubt be\r\n  alledged, that we have exaggerated this article; and yet we have\r\n  certain ground to affirm, that it is greatly underrated. Sure I am, if\r\n  we can suppose that the amount of such remittance made from 1757 to\r\n  1770 hath been in any degree equal to that of the two following years,\r\n  (which is ascertained,) and we have no reason to suppose that there\r\n  hath been any considerable difference, the sum assigned by us will be\r\n  greatly under mark. For no sooner did the English Company, in 1770,\r\n  open her treasury, to receive money for remittance to Britain, than\r\n  there was poured in at her three capital settlements above 1,400,000\r\n  l. for which bills were granted, presented, and accepted by the\r\n  Company, and nearly two thirds of this sum was borrowed in Bengal. And\r\n  in 1771 she hath borrowed in Bengal alone, under the promise of\r\n  remittance, a sum perhaps exceeding the whole loan of the former year;\r\n  though the bills have been postponed by her agents in Bengal, on\r\n  account of the Company’s inability to answer them. Such was the\r\n  remittance of British private fortunes for these two years, through\r\n  the channel of the English Company alone: and we have good reason to\r\n  suppose, that there may have been some made through other channels.\r\n  And these enormous sums, borrowed by the Company, as sovereign, for\r\n  the expence of Bengal, in these two years, will serve to show the\r\n  mighty alteration of affairs in that country since 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A PLAN, FOR ESTABLISHING A REGULAR SYSTEM OF POLITICAL GOVERNMENT IN\r\n                                 INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have before observed, that the second cause why these restraining and\r\nimpelling powers, which alone can prevent tyranny and anarchy, have been\r\naltogether wanting in the Company’s system of government, appears to be\r\nthe distance of situation, betwixt the sovereign residence and the\r\ncountry governed. And we shall here add that, if national government\r\nshould adopt the same system, this distance would operate, under it,\r\neffects the same in nature as these under the Company; and nothing but\r\nthe difference in other circumstances, betwixt the national government\r\nand Company, could prevent these effects from being likewise equal in\r\ndegree. For it is evident that, if the executive government of the\r\nnation should, as the Directors have done, preserve to itself the charge\r\nand power of immediately superintending and controuling the execution of\r\ngovernment in that Indian dominion, the distance of situation would\r\ncreate to that government an equal impossibility of advising and\r\ndirecting measures, of enforcing the execution or observance of orders,\r\nand of preventing or restraining abuse: consequently, in the immediate\r\nexecution of all measures, the national governors would possess the same\r\nunlimited power, as the Company’s governors have done. And the only\r\nadvantage to that Indian government, from national governments assuming\r\nfrom the Company the charge of administering it, would arise from the\r\nfollowing circumstances. First, the superior retrospective or _ex post\r\nfacto_ authority of national government, enabling it to judge and punish\r\nthe maladministration, or disobedience of its ministers. Second, The\r\nsuperior inclination or disposition of national government (arising from\r\nits perpetual interest in the property) to exert itself in promoting\r\nproper measures. Third, The suppression of commercial despotism. And\r\nfourth, The existence of the Company as a middle state betwixt the\r\nnatives and their foreign government. All which innovations, arising\r\nfrom national government’s taking upon itself the administration of this\r\nIndian government, though they are indispensably necessary and highly\r\nconducive to the establishment of a regular political system, yet do we\r\nperceive that they, singly and unsupported, cannot suffice to create\r\nthat due proportion of restraint on the power, or of impulse on the will\r\nof the deputed executive government, which is absolutely necessary to\r\nthe perfect suppression of tyranny, anarchy, and abuse. Nor is it\r\npossible to complete this restraint and impulse, to that sufficing\r\ndegree, unless by a proper exertion of the sovereign’s own supreme\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nBut we find that, upon the Company’s system, the distance of situation\r\nrenders the influence of the sovereign altogether impotent to this\r\neffect: and if we should take it for granted that her system hath been\r\njust or complete, then must we conclude, that this sovereign impotence\r\nis a consequence naturally and unavoidably arising from the distance;\r\nand, therefore, above the remedy of art. But, if we consult our own\r\nreason, we shall perceive that the Company’s impotence, in that\r\nparticular respect, proceeded from a radical defect or error in her\r\nsystem; which might have been remedied by art. For, it is evident, that\r\nthe distance of situation was in every circumstance similarly and\r\nequally obstructive to the Company’s immediately or personally executing\r\nthe government of that Indian dominion, as it was to her immediately\r\nrestraining or enforcing the manner of execution: and yet we find that\r\nthe Directors could discover a remedy for the first of these\r\nobstructions, by the succedaneum of appointing a deputed executive\r\ngovernment. And, as the second sprung from the same cause, and was\r\nexactly similar in its nature, common sense must surely have instructed\r\nher, that it was to be removed by a similar remedy; it being certain\r\nthat, if the Directors had thought proper to institute in India a\r\ndeputation properly qualified to controul their executive deputation,\r\nthe measures of those Indian governments might have been enforced or\r\nretrained by the sovereign rending in Europe, as effectually as they\r\nhave been executed by the same sovereign: that is to say, as\r\neffectually, as the defective constitution of the Company, (which\r\nequally disqualified her for controuling as for executing,) could admit.\r\n\r\nBut it could not be ignorance, or want of common sense, that prevented\r\nthe Directors from instituting a controuling deputation of this nature:\r\nseeing they had before them the precedent of these other European\r\nnations, who hold any possessions in India: all of whom have provided\r\nsomething of this kind: for instance, the Dutch government at Batavia.\r\nSound policy quickly pointed out to the Dutch, the absurdity of\r\ncommitting the charge of their dispersed concerns in India, to a\r\nmultiplicity of distinct heads, all acting under no other constraint, or\r\nrestraint, than that of the Company’s Directors residing in Europe.\r\nTherefore, so soon as the Dutch Company began to extend her possessions\r\nin India, she instituted one supreme government at Batavia, with full\r\npowers, and authority, to direct and controul the executive government\r\nof all her other settlements. And this government acts in India as an\r\nintermediate power, betwixt the Company residing in Europe, and her\r\nvarious possessions in that distant country; and as the perpetual\r\nresidentiary supervisor of all her interests there. The Directors\r\ncommunicate all their purposes immediately to it; and it disperses\r\norders and instructions to all the subordinate governments; which again\r\ntransmit to it a regular account of their situation, wants, or\r\ntransactions. All governors, chiefs, &c. are immediately responsible to\r\nit: all appointments to, and removals from, office in the subordinates,\r\nare made immediately by it: and all complaints or appeals, against the\r\nmisconduct or injustice of these governors, are immediately addressed to\r\nit. In fine, it may be termed the center of the Dutch government in\r\nIndia. And though this government can in no shape be termed the complete\r\nmodel of a deputation, fit to controul or enforce the execution of\r\nsovereign government, in various territorial dominions; yet, to this\r\ninstitution, defective as it is, the Dutch owe it, that the government\r\nof their numerous subordinate possessions in India hath been conducted,\r\nfor about two hundred years, clear of any enormous abuse.\r\n\r\nBut if the Dutch and other European nations, which hold little other\r\nconcern in India than a few settlements established there for the\r\npurpose of commerce, found it necessary, for the regular management of\r\nthese commercial concerns, to institute a sort of intermediate supreme\r\npower, as a local check on the rest of their settlements: how much more\r\nincumbent was it on the English Company, to constitute an immediate\r\ndirecting and controuling power, over the conduct of her deputies, who\r\nwere entrusted with the charge of executing the sovereign government, of\r\nsundry mighty states; a charge of such superior intricacy, weight,\r\nimportance, and delicacy; and so very liable to be abused.\r\n\r\nWhat may have been the motive of the Directors for thus wilfully\r\nomitting an institution so evidently useful and necessary, I shall not\r\npretend to determine. Possibly they might apprehend that if, upon their\r\nacquiring this mighty sovereign dominion, they should alter that which\r\nhad been all along their commercial system, such alteration might induce\r\nthe nation to enquire into the cause of it, and so discover the nature\r\nof their dominion, which they have ever carefully hid from the public.\r\nThough, it is more probable, they might perceive, that the institution\r\nof such an intermediate power would greatly interfere with their own\r\npersonal influence, power, and emoluments; seeing it must have possessed\r\nthe immediate disposal of places and posts, as well as a considerable\r\nshare in the direction of affairs: and, in order to prevent this, they\r\npreserved to themselves the power, of immediately superintending, and\r\ndirecting, the execution of government in those Indian dominions.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the motive of the Directors may have been, it is certain,\r\nthat the want of a deputed controuling power in India, hath been a\r\nradical and grievous defect in their system: which hath produced a\r\nnumber of those evils that have been falsely ascribed to the distance of\r\nsituation. And though we are far from alledging, that it was possible\r\nfor the Company to establish in those countries a government in any\r\ndegree regular, seeing that the numerous natural defects in her\r\nconstitution, unavoidably producing many destructive abuses, must have\r\never proved an insuperable obstacle to that; yet do we affirm that, the\r\ninstitution of a duly qualified intermediate controuling power, would\r\nhave totally prevented some, and would have greatly diminished most, of\r\nthese enormous abuses which, upon the system of the Directors, have\r\nserved to ruin those countries.\r\n\r\nNow we have seen that the national government would, by taking upon\r\nitself the charge of administring that Indian government, remedy or\r\nsuppress all the abuses that have sprung from the defective constitution\r\nof the Company, (besides creating other circumstances of high utility,\r\nthat could not exist under the Company’s government.) And as the\r\ndistance of situation, preventing the sovereign from immediately\r\nexerting his supreme influence over the deputed executive government, is\r\nthe only remaining cause of evil or abuse; it is plain that, if it is\r\npossible to construct in India, a deputed power, upon such principles,\r\nas that it shall effectually and completely supply the place of the\r\nsovereign, in immediately directing, enforcing, and controuling the\r\nmeasures of the deputed executive government, then must the only\r\nobstruction to the establishment of a regular political system, be\r\nremedied and removed. Consequently the grand _desideratum_, the only\r\nthing that is wanting, to enable the national government of Britain to\r\nregularly administer the government of those Indian dominions, is the\r\ninstitution of a deputed controuling power in India, properly qualified\r\nto fulfil the purposes that have been here specified.\r\n\r\nAnd that it is possible, to constitute an intermediate power in India,\r\nthat shall effectually and faithfully direct, enforce, and controul the\r\nmeasures of the deputed executive government in those Indian dominions,\r\nI doubt not to evince: though, at same time, I am fully sensible of the\r\nmany real difficulties, arising from nature and circumstance, to\r\nobstruct it; as likewise of the many artificial difficulties proceeding\r\nfrom the endeavours of those who have an interest to obstruct such a\r\nmeasure; and who have influence to enforce their objections, however\r\nfutile, on the understanding of others.\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed to describe the plan upon which we mean to\r\nconstruct this controuling deputation, it will be necessary to explain\r\nthe extent of its charge, or number of the government’s composing that\r\ndominion which it is meant to controul. For tho’, in our description of\r\nthe Company’s government in India, we confined our account to that of\r\nBengal alone, as being the most important and best known part of her\r\ndominion; yet doth the Company possess, besides Bengal, certain other\r\nterritorial governments, of no small value and importance, in respect of\r\neither revenue or commerce. All which governments being formed upon the\r\nsame system as that of Bengal, do not less demand reform, supervision,\r\nand controul.\r\n\r\nFor, in the first place, the government of Madrass possesses a very\r\nconsiderable and valuable territorial dominion, avowedly in the name and\r\nright of the Company. This same government doth likewise, in every thing\r\nbeside the name, possess the absolute sovereignty of that rich\r\ncommercial province of Arcot, or the Carnatic, in which it is situated:\r\nfor, notwithstanding it tolerates a nominal Nabob, whose name it uses in\r\nmost acts of government; and who, consequently, for the Company’s\r\nconvenience, possesses the shadow of sovereignty; yet, as the government\r\nof Madrass holds the charge of defending the country, and maintains the\r\nmilitary force requisite thereto, it is the actual sovereign: seeing\r\nthat, in all Indian or Asiatic governments, he who holds the sword must\r\nbe the absolute lord and master. And, notwithstanding all the Company’s\r\nparade of appearances, this Nabob of Arcot is, in respect of sovereign\r\npower, as much a pageant as he of Bengal: a mere screen or blind, placed\r\nbefore the Company’s sovereignty.\r\n\r\nBombay is likewise embarked in dominion, since it seized on the rich\r\ncommercial city of Surat, with its district, &c. Though sound policy\r\nmust direct Britain to reprobate all territorial dominion on that side\r\nof the peninsula; as causing a dangerous division and weakening of her\r\nforce and defence.\r\n\r\nBut the same policy will instruct Britain to regard dominion on the east\r\nside of that peninsula in an opposite light; because, on that side lay\r\nall the truly valuable dominions which she already possesses.\r\n\r\nTo fully explain what is the true interest of Britain, respecting\r\nterritorial dominion in India, would be, here, foreign and tedious; and,\r\nto slightly touch on that subject, might afford ground for censure and\r\ncriticism: we shall only observe, in the general, that Britain ought to\r\nvalue only such dominion in India as is maritime: because, in the first\r\nplace, these are ever trading and manufacturing countries; and, as such,\r\nare highly useful to her proper commerce; they are likewise capacitated,\r\nby their own active foreign trade, to richly reimburse her for her\r\nexpence of native strength in defending them, as well as for her trouble\r\nin governing them: and, in the second place, being accessible to her\r\nnaval force, they are easily maintained and defended by her. Therefore,\r\nso much of this maritime dominion as she can maintain and defend,\r\nwithout creating any additional expence of native strength; and, upon a\r\nfooting so connected with that truly valuable dominion which she already\r\npossesses, as not to cause any dangerous division of that original\r\nstrength, so much of this maritime dominion in India may be truly useful\r\nand advantageous to her; on any other terms it may be detrimental.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present state of British dominion in India: and such is the\r\ninterest of Britain, with respect to future augmentation of dominion in\r\nthat country. And we have undertaken to plan the construction of an\r\nintermediate power or deputation, which, under the national government\r\nof Britain, shall effectually and faithfully superintend, enforce, and\r\ncontroul the measures of these several governments that, at present are,\r\nor in future may be, subjected to Britain: and which deputation shall of\r\ncourse, in the first place, enable the national government of Britain to\r\nestablish a regular system of political government over this whole\r\npresent or future dominion: and, in the second place, shall constitute a\r\ncomplete system of military government, and secure defence, for all the\r\nseveral branches of this dominion. At present we are on the subject of\r\npolitical government.\r\n\r\nThe properties requisite to qualify this intermediate power, or\r\ndeputation, for effectually superintending, enforcing, and controuling\r\nthe political government of dominion in India, are, first, virtue and\r\nintegrity, to faithfully and honestly discharge the duties of its\r\noffice: and, second, power or ability, to effectually fulfil the purpose\r\nof its institution. The latter is more easily conferred; but the former\r\nis rendered difficult, by sundry obstructions, arising from the nature\r\nor disposition of the persons who must necessarily be employed to\r\ncompose this deputation. For it is needless to observe, that this\r\ncontrouling power cannot be lodged in the subjects native of the\r\ndependent dominion; the nature of the government, as well as the nature\r\nof their disposition, rendering that impracticable; (as hath been\r\nshewn): otherwise this difficulty might be more easily surmounted. But,\r\nthe Indian subjects being set aside, there remains no choice; this\r\ncontrouling deputation must, _per_ force, be composed of British born\r\nsubjects: whilst the several governments, which it is meant to controul,\r\nare at same time executed by British born subjects. And, from this\r\ncircumstance, it follows, that the personal interest of the party\r\ncontrouling must naturally be the very same, with that of the party\r\ncontrouled: and, of course, the views of both must likewise be the same.\r\n\r\nThis similarity or sameness of personal interest and views it is that\r\ncreates the difficulty of conferring virtue, integrity, honour, and\r\nfidelity, on the controuling deputation. For it is morally certain, that\r\nthe similarity of interest and views will, naturally and invariably,\r\ndraw the party controuling, to concur and join, instead of controuling\r\nor opposing, the measures of the party executing, (seeing such measures\r\ntend to promote that which is their common interest) provided that this\r\nparty controuling shall possess the power, and opportunity of so joining\r\ninterest, with the party executing. And it is no less certain, that this\r\ncontrouling deputation must, unavoidably, possess the opportunity of\r\nthus joining interests, unless it can, by some means, be prevented and\r\nrestrained from joining and uniting the action of its own proper powers,\r\nwith the action of these powers that are proper to the executive office.\r\nWhereas, if it shall be found possible to divide and separate the action\r\nof these two different powers, the one from the other, in a manner so\r\ndistinct, that each shall act, in the sphere assigned to it, with\r\nfreedom and liberty; and neither shall have the opportunity of\r\ntransgressing the limits prescribed, to its own proper department, by\r\nthe sovereign; then, and in such case, it is not only possible, but\r\ncertain, that this controuling deputation may, and will be, prevented\r\nfrom joining interests, with the executive deputation; and,\r\nconsequently, from promoting the very measures which it was meant to\r\nrestrain. And, from thence I conclude, that the only possible and\r\ncertain means of conferring, on this controuling deputation, virtue and\r\nintegrity to faithfully and honestly discharge the duties of its office,\r\nis to cut it off from all opportunity of joining the powers of its\r\noffice, with those of the executive; or of assuming any share in the\r\nexecutive government: in other words, it must be restrained from\r\ninterfering, either directly or indirectly, personally or by proxy, in\r\nthe immediate execution of measures, in any one of these governments\r\nwhich it is meant to controul.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that, if this controuling deputation shall exist or\r\nreside within any one of those dominions whose government it is meant to\r\ncontroul, it will be morally impossible to prevent it from joining its\r\npowers, and, consequently, its interests, views, and measures, with the\r\ndeputed executive power of that government where it resides. For, by\r\nvirtue of its authority, which from the nature of its office must needs\r\nbe supreme over the executive deputation, it will usurp at least a part\r\nif not the whole power of execution: or otherwise it will, by consent,\r\njoin and unite its powers with those of the executive, in order to\r\npromote their mutual interest, by measures diametrically repugnant to\r\nthe purpose of its institution. Nor is it possible, in this case, by any\r\nart, device or separation into parts, to prevent this usurpation or\r\nunion: let the controuling power be termed judges, supervisors, officers\r\nof the revenue, or what else; and let the office of controuling be\r\ndivided, into as many parts as can be conceived; still, the difference\r\nof term, will not alter the nature of the men employed; nor will the\r\ndivision of parts separate their interest. All the various persons,\r\ncomposing this office, will still be Europeans; the same as these who\r\ncompose the executive office; and so, all the persons in both offices\r\nwill be foreign to the country governed, acting by an authority which is\r\ndeputed mutable and temporary; consequently they will all hold the same\r\nview; which is, to amass all the money they can during the short term of\r\ntheir office, in order to transport it to their own country: and as all\r\nof them would, by virtue of their residing within the same government,\r\npossess the same powers, and the same opportunities of exerting them,\r\nthey would all be irresistably attracted, by the omnipotent sympathy of\r\nself-interest, to join their several powers, in promoting that which is\r\nthe common view of one and all of them. In fine, if these controuling\r\nand executive deputations, which thus, from the community of the _natale\r\nsolum_, hold one and the same interest, shall both reside together in\r\none and the same government, and thereby possess the same opportunities,\r\nit will be equally impossible to prevent these two deputations, however\r\nartfully separated into parts, from joining and uniting their different\r\npowers, &c. as it is to preserve separate the guttæ of quicksilver;\r\nwhich, however gently and carefully they are dropt upon the same\r\nconfined and smooth surface, will meet, join, and conglobate into one\r\nunited mass. But if the controuling deputation shall be thus permitted\r\nto join its powers with these of the executive, and consequently forfeit\r\nits virtue and integrity, with respect to that one territorial\r\ngovernment where it resides, it thereby becomes disqualified and unfit\r\nto controul the measures of any one other government: for the judge who\r\nis himself corrupt, is but little qualified to judge or punish\r\ncorruption in others. I therefore conclude that, in order to preserve\r\nthe virtue and integrity of this controuling deputation, it is\r\nindispensably necessary that it should not reside within the limits of\r\nany one of these territorial governments; these being the governments\r\nwhich it is meant to controul.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is equally certain, that this controuling\r\ndeputation cannot execute in person, or assume any personal share in the\r\nexecution of measures, in any one of those governments where it doth not\r\nactually reside; it being impossible that it can act personally where it\r\nis not personally present. It therefore follows that, by situating or\r\nplacing this controuling deputation at a sufficiently proper distance\r\nfrom all these several territorial governments, it may be prevented from\r\nassuming a personal share in the immediate execution of measures in any\r\none of them. And being thus, by the situation of its residence, cut off\r\nfrom all opportunity of acting personally, it may likewise be precluded\r\nfrom acting secondarily, or usurping by proxy any influence, in the\r\nimmediate execution of these governments, if it shall, after the manner\r\nof the Dutch government at Batavia, be strictly prohibited from\r\nexercising its supervising authority any where without the limits of its\r\nown fixed residence; and from delegating or deputing its powers to any\r\nperson or persons, its own members or others, who shall reside, or may\r\nbe beyond these prescribed bounds. For though the system of the Dutch\r\ngovernment at Batavia is, in many respects, far too rude and unpolished;\r\nyet is it, in this particular, most nicely circumscribed: that\r\ngovernment being restrained, in the most precise manner, from delegating\r\nand transferring its authority; or from deputing any power to examine\r\ninto cases, of even the most dubious nature, within the subordinates:\r\nbut to obviate any inconvenience, that might otherwise arise from such\r\nrestraint, it hath a power to call before it, from the subordinates, all\r\npersons or records necessary to information. For the Dutch were well\r\naware, that the supreme government, if it should be permitted to carry\r\nits supervising authority on any pretext into the subordinates, would\r\ngain an occasion of interfering in the execution of those measures which\r\nit was intended to controul.\r\n\r\nWe must then perceive, that this controuling deputation being seated at\r\na properly sufficient distance from all these territorial governments,\r\nand the exercise of its powers being expressly confined to that\r\nparticular seat of residence, it will, by such means, be effectually\r\nrestrained from interfering, in any shape, either directly or\r\nindirectly, in the execution of any one of those governments which it is\r\nintended to controul. And we must farther perceive that, by virtue of\r\nsuch effectual restraint, that clear separation of office, which alone\r\ncan prevent the junction or union of the powers, interests, and views of\r\nthis controuling deputation with those of the executive, will be\r\ncompletely accomplished. Seeing that, the action of the controuling\r\npower being strictly confined within the limits of its own proper\r\nsphere, the executive power must remain at full liberty to act\r\ndistinctly and freely in the office assigned to it by the sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe principal source of corruption, and grand stumbling block of virtue,\r\nbeing thus removed, the integrity of this controuling deputation may be\r\nestablished on a firm and solid basis, by skilfully dividing the parts\r\nwhich go to compose it: and, in particular, by clearly separating the\r\npolitical and judicial powers: which, if they shall be judiciously\r\ndivided into two distinct departments, mutually independent and\r\nuninfluenced, will, each of them, act as an effectual check, and\r\npowerful impulse, on the other: so as to prevent either from abusing its\r\nauthority, or neglecting its duty. Whereas, if the political power\r\nshould, at same time, possess the power of judging, trying and\r\ndetermining, or should even possess any influence over the judicature,\r\nthere is danger that it might, on some occasions, sacrifice its duty to\r\nits interest. And this is the very capital error of the Dutch system at\r\nBatavia, inasmuch as that government, possessing the judicial power,\r\nhath thereby the opportunity of perverting justice, sometimes to the\r\nprejudice of its constituent, and often to the detriment of its\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\nNor would we be here understood to signify, by judicial power, a simple\r\ncourt of judicature, established for the purpose of deciding litigated\r\ncases of property; the judicial power here meant, must extend to every\r\nthing that respects a due execution of the jurisdiction and police, in\r\nthe subordinate governments. Therefore its authority must not be\r\npassive, and confined to such matter as shall come before it by\r\ncomplaint; but it must be active, assuming cognizance of all public\r\nnuisance, trespass, or delinquency, that may be brought before it by\r\ninformation. For, here, juries may exist with great propriety and\r\nefficacy, seeing that the Company will, on account of her commerce, keep\r\na number of servants at this supreme settlement; there will likewise be,\r\nno doubt, many free merchants (as they are termed): and, consequently,\r\nthere will never be wanting a choice of persons unconnected with, and\r\nuninfluenced by the political government; and therefore fit to form a\r\ngrand inquest; as well as petit or special juries, to decide in either\r\ncriminal cases, or disputes of property. And this judicial power must\r\nfarther be endued with all proper and necessary officers; particularly\r\nan attorney general: it must likewise be divided into distinct courts;\r\nresembling, as nearly as circumstances will admit, or occasion requires,\r\nthe courts of justice in the sovereign country.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we do not presume to dictate or prescribe the exact or\r\ncomplete form of this judicial power: we would only hint at the main\r\npurposes of its institution; a due consideration of which will readily\r\nsuggest the particular form, to those whose province it may be to\r\nconstruct it. We shall only observe that, in order to confer a due\r\nweight on the judicial power, it is not sufficient that it should be\r\nindependent, in its corporate capacity; the judges and officers\r\ncomposing it must, in their personal capacity, be placed as far as\r\npossible beyond the influence of the political power. The salaries\r\nannexed to their offices must be such as will afford dignity, as well as\r\nindependance: whilst, on the other hand, they shall be debarred, under\r\nthe severest penalties, from holding, either directly or indirectly, any\r\nplace, post, emolument, or employment, of any nature, distinct from that\r\nof its own proper department. Moreover, the political power should hold\r\nno voice in conferring the degrees of this department: that should be\r\nvested in the judicial power itself, with reference to the confirmation\r\nof the sovereign.\r\n\r\nThis judicial power may be termed the supreme Court of Judicature, for\r\nthe whole British dominion in India: to which all the subjects, under\r\nthe several governments, whether natives or Europeans, may readily\r\nappeal, against the oppression of their governors, or the perversion of\r\njustice: and, on which they may securely depend for redress; provided it\r\nshall be placed above the influence of the political power. This supreme\r\ncourt of judicature would likewise be of inexpressible utility, as a\r\ncheck on the power, and an impulse on the will, of the political branch.\r\n\r\nWe may add, that a judicious subdivision of the political power, into\r\ndifferent departments, might contribute considerably to its virtue.\r\n\r\nThese are the outlines of that measure, by which we propose to preserve\r\nthis controuling deputation free from corruption: and we doubt not but,\r\nupon this plan, when meliorated and improved by the superior\r\nunderstanding of others, a controuling power may be constructed, which\r\nshall be completely qualified, in point of virtue and integrity, to\r\nfaithfully and honourably superintend, enforce, and controul the\r\nexecution of political government in those Indian dominions. And this\r\nis, by far, the most difficult, delicate, and important part of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nFor, as to the power and ability, requisite to qualify this deputation\r\nfor effectually fulfilling the purpose of its institution, that is\r\nreadily bestowed. The degree of power is altogether in the disposal of\r\nthe sovereign. And, its efficacy or ability depends, principally, upon\r\nthe choice of such a situation for the seat of its residence, as shall\r\nenable it to keep up, at all seasons, a ready and speedy correspondence\r\nwith the several subordinate governments,\r\n\r\nWith regard to the choice of situation proper for the residence of this\r\ncontrouling power; (which is indeed a point of high importance,) we\r\nshall readily conceive, from adverting to its nature and the purposes of\r\nits institution, that this residence ought to be some convenient sea\r\nport; situated at a considerable distance from the limits of all these\r\nterritorial governments; but, at same time, so centrically near to each,\r\nthat the communication, to and from it, shall, in either monsoon, be not\r\nonly practicable, but certain and speedy. I shall reserve the farther\r\nexplanation of this intended seat of residence, till I come to treat of\r\nthe military system; because there are some properties, particularly\r\nrequisite to a proper centre of military defence: and it is proposed\r\nthat the same power, and consequently the same residence, that\r\nsuperintends the political government, should likewise direct the\r\nmilitary government and defence, of this dominion.\r\n\r\nBut this supreme controuling power being thus centrically situated, with\r\nrespect to the several subordinates, as that it shall at all times hold\r\na ready and speedy correspondence with each, will be thereby enabled to\r\neffectually superintend, enforce, and controul the execution of\r\npolitical government in that whole dominion. For, in the first place,\r\nthe ready and speedy communication with all the subordinates, affording\r\nto the supreme power an opportunity of obtaining, from each, the most\r\nearly intelligence of every transaction, incident, or occurrence; as\r\nlikewise of immediately transmitting the orders and instructions, that\r\nmay be suitable to the occasion; will cut off from the several governors\r\nof the territorial dominions all pretext for acting discretionally. And,\r\nin consequence, that despotic and arbitrary power, which hath subsisted\r\nunder the Company’s system, will be completely suppressed. And, from\r\nadverting to this circumstance, we shall perceive the importance of a\r\nproper choice of situation, for this supreme center of government.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, this ready correspondence with all the subordinate\r\ngovernments, enabling the supreme power to acquire a minute and complete\r\nknowledge of every circumstance, respecting the state and nature of the\r\ngeneral police, in this whole dominion, will qualify it for originally\r\nplanning, and for afterwards improving, all such designs and measures as\r\ncan contribute to the institution of regularity and good order. It will\r\nlikewise attain an intimate knowledge of the whole manoeuvre of finance,\r\nrespecting the mode of collecting as well as appropriating the revenue\r\nand taxes: and it will be thereby enabled to project judicious forms,\r\nwith different offices, as mutual checks upon each other, in that\r\nbranch: which will serve to remedy that incredible extortion, rapine,\r\nand peculation: which, by ruining the farmer of the lands, hath almost\r\ntotally suppressed agriculture, and greatly depopulated those miserable\r\ncountries; whilst it hath grievously defrauded the sovereign of his\r\nright. And all these planned modes, being approved and confirmed by the\r\nsovereign, would be continued in vigorous and perpetual action, by the\r\nvicinity of the supreme political power: and all these several measures,\r\nbeing enacted into laws, the strict observance of them would be\r\neffectually enforced by the same vicinity. And thus, that supreme power\r\nwill, not only establish, but perpetually conserve a just regularity in\r\npolice, and an exact oeconomy in finance.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the supreme judicial power will, by its\r\nneighbourhood to these dependent dominions, acquire a just knowledge of\r\nthe modes, customs, and dispositions of the inhabitants; and, by that,\r\nit will be enabled to devise the best forms or offices, together with\r\nskilful rules for administring the jurisdiction, in a manner truly\r\neffectual, and at same time consonant and agreeable to the humour of the\r\nsubject. It will likewise be capable of afterwards improving and adding\r\nto these forms and rules, as future occasion may require, or better\r\ninformation may suggest. All which forms or offices may, by the\r\napprobation of the sovereign, be established into standing courts; and\r\nthe rules enacted into laws. And a punctual observance of all these laws\r\nenacted, either for the regular administration of justice, or\r\nconservance of the police, will be completely enforced, by the awe of\r\nthis supreme tribunal: the communication with which, from all parts of\r\nthat dependent dominion, being easy and speedy, will afford a ready\r\naccess and opportunity to all the subjects, of presenting their\r\ncomplaints, against any oppression of their government, or denial, or\r\nperversion of justice: whilst the same ready communication will render\r\nthe trial of all litigated cases, speedy and easy. A mighty innovation\r\nthis, from the former mode of justice in those dominions; when it was\r\nimpossible for even Europeans to obtain redress, in our distant precise\r\nEuropean courts, against the most glaring oppression of government: and\r\nthe natives were excluded from even that distant and deceitful prospect\r\nof remedy.\r\n\r\nAnd in order that the course of justice may be rendered thoroughly\r\ncomplete, it may be enacted, after the manner of the Dutch, that no\r\nperson, who hath held any office of power or trust within the\r\nsubordinates, shall depart immediately from thence for Europe; but shall\r\nbe obliged to repair to the supreme residence; there to remain for three\r\nmonths; to the end that any person or persons who may, by any means,\r\nhave been restrained, during the existence of his office, from\r\npreferring their complaint against him, on the score of either public or\r\nprivate trespass, may there have the free opportunity of prosecuting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe supreme political power shall immediately appoint to all offices, as\r\nwell political as military, within the subordinate governments; with\r\nreference held to the future approbation, and confirmation, of the\r\nsovereign: and it shall preserve regular minutes of all such\r\nappointments, orders, and other transactions made in its supreme\r\ncapacity; which minutes, together with regular and properly vouched\r\naccounts of the collection, as well as the appropriation of the revenue,\r\nshall be punctually transmitted, by every occasion, to the sovereign.\r\nThe judicial power shall likewise keep an exact register of all trials,\r\ncauses, and proceedings; more particularly those of the grand inquest\r\nand assizes: this latter to be signed by all the judges and officers of\r\nthe court, and attested by the foremen, with a majority of the juries:\r\ntwo copies of which shall be regularly transmitted to Britain; one to\r\nthe sovereign; and the other to the Company; which, as holding a\r\nmaterial interest and share in these law proceedings, hath a claim to\r\nsuch participation of knowledge. All which minutes, accounts, and\r\nproceedings, being communicated to the sovereign, will enable him to act\r\nas an ultimate check on the political government, the finance, and the\r\njurisdiction of that Indian dominion.\r\n\r\nSuch is the form of this intermediate power, through which I propose to\r\nconvey, into the execution of government in those distant Indian\r\ndominions, that plenary exertion of the sovereign’s restraining and\r\ncompelling power, which, alone, can suffice to prevent tyranny and\r\nanarchy. And notwithstanding the materials are, through hurry and want\r\nof time, rude, unpolished and coarsely arranged, yet do I flatter\r\nmyself, that candour will allow them to be solidly good, proper, and\r\nfully sufficing to construct, at least, the groundplot, or basis, of a\r\nregular political system. Sure I am, the high propriety, nay the\r\nindispensable necessity of such a measure, must immediately strike every\r\nperson who employs his own judgment, however slightly, to consider,\r\nfirst, the nature, interests, and views of the executive government in\r\nthose Indian dominions; as being foreign, deputed, mutable, and\r\ntemporary. Second the timid, passive, and slavishly submissive\r\ndisposition of the native subjects. And third, the distance of\r\nsituation, betwixt the sovereign residence, and the scene of government;\r\nwhich, rendering the immediate restraint and constraint of the sovereign\r\nperfectly impotent, confers on this foreign executive deputation an\r\nunlimited and arbitrary power, of promoting its own personal views and\r\ninterest, by measures, which tend to the intolerable oppression of the\r\nwretched inhabitants, and the utter ruin of those subjected countries;\r\nas well as to the mighty detriment of Britain’s dearest interest, and\r\nthe blackest reproach to her reputation. Nor can all this be remedied or\r\nprevented, but by such a measure as is here proposed.\r\n\r\nAnd now we shall take a slight glance at the operation of this measure,\r\non the jurisdiction, and police, of the subordinate dominions. And\r\nthough, for the sake of perspicuity, we confine the view to Bengal\r\nalone, as being the most eminent part, yet will the effects be equally\r\nfelt through the whole.\r\n\r\nAs to the fundamental establishments of Governors, Councils, &c. these\r\nare sufficiently obvious; as likewise are the proper chambers of\r\nrevenue: and these, with the minutiæ appointments of inferior offices,\r\nwill be more properly provided and improved, by the better judgment,\r\ntrue information, and future experience of the supreme controuling\r\npower. Here we mean to offer only one or two hints on the mode of\r\njurisdiction and police.\r\n\r\nAnd first, with regard to the courts of justice, I should propose that\r\nthe mayor’s court at Culcutta should still subsist, as a court of equity\r\nfor the whole country: and a most equitable court it is, if properly\r\nregulated: for the truth of which assertion, I appeal to all those who\r\nknew it previous to that alteration of the Company’s charter of justice,\r\nwhich rendered it dependent on, and subservient to, the Governor and\r\nCouncil: never was justice more exactly or more expeditiously\r\nadministered, than it was by this court, previous to that alteration. In\r\norder therefore to restore it to its primitive utility, it ought to be\r\nrestored to its original state. Let the judges or aldermen, who at\r\npresent compose it, continue such: being servants to the Company, or\r\nfree merchants, they must be unconnected with, and uninfluenced by the\r\nnational government. And, in the case of death, or removal, the vacuum\r\nto be supplied by the court itself, from amongst the Company’s servants,\r\nor free merchants only: and if any alderman shall, subsequent to\r\nentering on his office, accept of any post or place under government,\r\nlet that be an express disqualification and vacation of his office;\r\nwhich is to be immediately made good, by the choice of another person,\r\nproperly qualified. The newly elected aldermen to be presented, for\r\nacceptance, to the supreme court of judicature only. And the officers of\r\nthis court to be chosen by itself.\r\n\r\nBut as it would be impossible for the mayor’s court to dispatch all the\r\nbusiness that might be brought before it, there ought likewise to be a\r\ncourt of law; consisting of a chief justice, with three judges; to be\r\nappointed by the sovereign. And this court should guide itself, by such\r\nlaws as may be enacted for the jurisdiction of those countries;\r\notherwise by equity.\r\n\r\nAppeals from this court of law, as well as that of equity, to be made\r\nimmediately to the supreme court of judicature; and from thence to his\r\nMajesty in council.\r\n\r\nIf it is thought proper, there might be another mayor’s court, of the\r\nsame nature, established at Cossimbuzar, in the neighbourhood of the old\r\ncapital, Maxadavad.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the forms, for the more universal distribution of justice to\r\nthe natives, these will be adjusted by the supreme supervising power; as\r\nbefore mentioned. We shall only observe, that their courts of Zemindary\r\nand Cutchery are, as they stand at present, a grievous nuisance.\r\n\r\nBut the noblest institution for protecting the liberty and property of\r\nthe subject, from the extortion and oppression of their foreign\r\ngovernment, and of its inferior train of native harpies, who are\r\ninfinitely more rapacious than the Europeans, would be that of juries,\r\nproperly constructed. Let the grand inquest of the country be held at\r\nCulcutta, four times in the year: and let the juries, both grand and\r\npetit, be expresly composed of Company’s servants, or free merchants,\r\nEuropeans, and none others: the judges of law, or at least two of them,\r\nto sit on the assizes: the sheriff to be chosen annually, from amongst\r\nthe Company’s servants.\r\n\r\nThe powers of this grand inquest, if adapted to the situation of things,\r\nmust be enlarged beyond these of our juries in Britain; where there are\r\njudicial and political aids, that must be wanting in those countries:\r\nfor instance, the enquiry must not be confined to place, but must extend\r\nevery where through the country: it must likewise have authority to\r\nbring before it all manner of nuisance or trespass committed against the\r\nliberty or property of the subject, natives as well as Europeans. And\r\nthe judges should have no power to reject or postpone the bills, found\r\nby the grand jury: but should bring them on to decision, in turn, as\r\npresented. Moreover, as the extent of enquiry may render it impossible\r\nfor the more distant defendant to appear with his evidences, during the\r\nsitting of that assize to which the bill hath been presented against\r\nhim; let summons be issued, upon the bill’s being presented, for such\r\ndistant defendant to appear at next assizes; or let some other method be\r\nfound, either by means of the grand jury’s meeting a sufficient time\r\nbefore the commencement of trials, or by some extraordinary power vested\r\nin the judges or sheriff to produce such distant defendant with his\r\nevidences in due time. And as this same extent of enquiry may, on the\r\nother hand, produce inconvenience to the subject, by affording occasion\r\nto litigious persons of distressing others, by bringing them from a\r\ngreat distance to these assizes, on frivolous or ill grounded\r\ncomplaints, it may be ordered that, where the cause shall appear to the\r\ncourt truly litigious, the plaintiff shall be bound over to stand suit\r\nat law, for damages to the defendant: and, one or two examples, of this\r\nnature, will prove a barr to frivolous litigation.\r\n\r\nAnd least the judges should, by any means, be influenced to act that\r\npart which the Company’s governor and council commonly act, when they\r\nabsurdly preside at these assizes, as his Majesty’s judges in their own\r\ncause; namely, to dismiss the Court, so soon as the grand jury shall\r\nfind a bill that may be disagreeable to them; it may be ordered that\r\nneither the judges, nor any officer of the Court, shall have power to\r\nadjourn the assizes, until all the trials shall be decided; or,\r\notherwise, by the consent of a majority in both juries.\r\n\r\nThe principal check however upon the conduct of these assizes, would be\r\nthat of obliging the Court to keep exact registers, of all trials, and\r\nproceedings; signed and attested, as before mentioned. And if any part\r\nof either jury shall except to the authenticity of such register, which\r\nshall be publickly exposed in the Court, then, such dissenting part\r\nshall have a right to protest, and assign its reasons. Three copies of\r\nwhich register, with protest, (if any,) shall be dispatched, by the\r\nearliest occasion, after each assize. One copy to the supreme Court of\r\nJudicature, which will, thereby, have the earliest notice of any abuse;\r\nand, with the concurrence of the supreme political power, shall have the\r\nopportunity of immediately correcting it. A second copy shall be\r\ntransmitted to the sovereign; who will act as an ulterior check on the\r\nsupreme controuling power. And a third copy to the Company for the\r\nreasons before specified.\r\n\r\nBut, as this single inquest at Calcutta cannot possibly carry justice to\r\nthe extremes of that extensive country, circulating assizes may be held,\r\nat least once, or if possible twice a year, at Muxadavad as the center,\r\nand at Patnah as the northern extreme; two judges to go this northern\r\ncircuit: and the other two judges to go on an eastern circuit, at Dacca.\r\nAnd, as there may not be a sufficient number of Company’s servants,\r\nproperly qualified, to form complete juries at these northern and\r\neastern assizes: I would propose that, to make up any such deficiency,\r\nnatives should be mixed with the Europeans. Which mixture, if it shall\r\nbe artfully tempered, in the following manner, would produce all the\r\nefficacy of entirely European juries; and, at same time, none of the bad\r\neffects, that might be apprehended, from an attempt to confer freedom\r\nand impartiality on juries entirely native.\r\n\r\nLet, at least, one half of both the grand and petit juries be Europeans;\r\nand the remaining part natives: and if it should happen, that there\r\ncannot be collected, at the assize factory, and from the neighbouring\r\ninferior factories, so many Company’s servants as shall make up half the\r\nusual number of jurymen; then, let the whole number be diminished, to\r\nthe sufficing half of Europeans. Let the unanimity of verdict, in such\r\nmixt juries, be dispensed with; and let the majority of voices, in\r\neither jury, find the bill or verdict; as is the custom in Scotland. And\r\nlet an additional provision be made to the oath of the juryman,\r\npurporting that he shall not, on any account, disclose the opinion given\r\nby any individual, in the jury room.\r\n\r\nBy this artful mixture, and these precautions, the native jurymen would\r\nbe liberated from that slavish dread, of future revenge from their own\r\ncountrymen employed under government; seeing it would be impossible, for\r\nthese native officers of government, to discover the particular opinion\r\nof each individual; which, if the juries were entirely native, they\r\nwould infallibly do, to the utter ruin of the poor native jurymen. So\r\nthat the native Jurymen, acting thus with freedom, under the cloke and\r\nprotection of the Europeans, would answer all the effectual purposes of\r\nEuropeans. Whilst, being sensible that they owed their freedom and\r\nimpartiality, together with all the other benefits arising from juries,\r\nto their connection with the Europeans; this freedom conferred on them\r\nin the jury room, would not in the least diminish their awe and\r\ndeference to government. The proceedings at these circuit assizes to be\r\nregistered and transmitted in like manner as at Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThese juries would prove the Magna Charta, the palladium, and true\r\nsecurity of Indian liberty and property, against the despotism and\r\nextortion of their foreign government. And it evidently appears that the\r\nvirtue of these juries, (as being, at one and the same time, truly\r\neffectual to the subject, and perfectly safe to the sovereign,) entirely\r\ndepends upon the circumstance, of completely excluding the Company and\r\nher servants, from the smallest participation in the executive powers of\r\ngovernment. But the efficacy of these juries, and of other inferior\r\ninstitutions made through the supreme controuling power, being once felt\r\nand known, would speedily induce the natives to purchase perpetual\r\nproperty in lands: seeing they would perceive themselves thoroughly\r\nsecured in the produce of those lands. And this, being divulged abroad,\r\nwould draw the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries to the standard\r\nof Britain; together with their wealth, and industry. By which means the\r\nBritish dominion in India, which, at present is, through oppression and\r\nconsequent famine, in a great measure deserted and depopulated, would\r\nagain be completely peopled and cultivated: arts, manufactures, and\r\ncommerce would soon be restored to their former state; nay, they would\r\nbe extended to a degree far superior: and these countries would, of\r\ncourse, be enabled to richly repay Britain for the blessings conferred\r\nby her, of perfect security in liberty and property; blessings, never\r\nbefore known in India.\r\n\r\nAnd all this may be effected by means of that intermediate supreme\r\ncontrouling power: which would, not only create, but preserve, the full\r\nand vigorous efficacy of all these institutions, in the subordinate\r\ndominions. Whereas, if it was even possible, (though indeed it is\r\nmorally impossible,) to institute, by any temporary means, all these\r\npowers, forms, rules, and regulations in those dominions, yet is it\r\nevidently certain that, so soon as these temporary means were withdrawn,\r\nthe virtue and efficacy of all these institutions would immediately\r\nvanish, and be suppressed by the power of the executive government;\r\nwhich, from the nature of things, must unavoidably be, either despotic\r\nover the native subjects, or cannot exist at all.\r\n\r\nBut this same controuling power, as it would, on the one hand, by its\r\nfixed residence in the immediate neighbourhood, perpetually preserve the\r\naction and motion of all these institutions, like to a power ever\r\npresent to wind up the springs of the machine; and, so, would check all\r\nthe bad effects of that naturally necessary despotism in executive\r\ngovernment: so would it, on the other hand, effectually support the\r\npower and authority of that executive government; and prevent its being\r\nencroached on, by an over exertion of the privileges conferred on the\r\nsubject. For, on this side too, there is a danger; which will be readily\r\ncomprehended, by those who consider the nature of government; and, at\r\nsame time, the disposition of human nature. But all danger, of\r\npreponderating either scale, would be prevented, by the vicinity of the\r\ncontrouling power: which, holding the balance in its hands, and nicely\r\ndiminishing from one, or adding to the other scale, would ever preserve\r\na just equilibrium, betwixt the liberty of the subject, and the power of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNor would the institution of new regulations be the only means, in the\r\nhands of the controuling power, of preventing the dangerous over\r\nexertion of privilege: it would likewise possess the instantaneous power\r\nof seizing, or otherwise of ordering to its own residence, all such\r\npersons as should prove over troublesome, or dangerous to the due\r\nauthority of executive government. For, though it would be extremely\r\nabsurd to trust a power of this nature, immediately in the hands of\r\nexecutive government; which would, infallibly, employ it to its own\r\nworst purposes: yet might such power be safely trusted to this\r\ncontrouling government; which could not have the same motives to abuse\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we do not mean that this, and all these other powers,\r\nshould be unlimitedly confided to this controuling deputation: we still\r\npreserve a check over it, in the national government. And a most\r\neffectual check too; by means of the beforementioned copies of\r\nregisters, immediately transmitted to Britain, from the subordinates; as\r\nlikewise by its own minutes, accounts, and registers.\r\n\r\nSo that here would be a regular gradation of effectual political checks.\r\nThe privilege of juries, and other institutions in the subordinate\r\ndominions, being preserved in vigorous action, by the influence of the\r\nintermediate controuling power, would prove an effectual check on the\r\ndespotism or extortion of executive government; and would thus\r\ncompletely secure the liberty and property of the subject. And the same\r\ninfluence of the controuling power would sufficiently check the\r\nluxuriancy of privilege; and support the power of government; thus\r\npreserving an exact poise betwixt both. Whilst the sovereign, at a\r\ndistance, could deliberately and effectually watch the hand that trimmed\r\nthe scales.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the institution of this intermediate controuling and impelling\r\npower, would completely remove every obstruction arising from the\r\ndistance of situation: it would serve as an intermediate link of the\r\npolitical chain: or, as a bridge of communication, joining this\r\ndependent Indian dominion to the sovereign country. But, all obstruction\r\narising from the distance of situation being thus removed, what\r\ndifficulty can the national government of Britain find, in administring\r\nthe political government of that Indian dominion? Upon this plan, that\r\ntask appears to me more facil, less pregnant with difficulty, charge, or\r\ncare, than it is to govern any one, the most pretty, of our foreign\r\nColonies: nay it appears equally easy, as it is to govern the\r\nneighbouring Isle of Man: seeing that the opposition of the subjects, to\r\nthe authority of government in this Indian dominion, though they be so\r\ninfinitely more numerous, is not greater than is the opposition of the\r\nfew subjects in Man. The only difficulty, that could exist to national\r\ngovernment, was that of duly tempering, or abating, the power of the\r\ndeputed executive government: and it appears, that this may be\r\ncompletely effected by means of this intermediate controuling power;\r\nwhich, in the hands of the sovereign, would act upon the government of\r\nthis Indian dominion as the pegs or keys upon the strings of a musical\r\ninstrument; of which one being gently strained, and another properly\r\nrelaxed, would create, and perpetually preserve, a perfect: harmony, or\r\nconcord, in this political system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLAN, FOR ESTABLISHING A REGULAR SYSTEM OF MILITARY GOVERNMENT, AND OF\r\n                       SECURE DEFENCE, IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Company’s system of military government and defence in India is, at\r\nleast, equally defective, faulty, and absurd; and, therefore, doth\r\nequally demand reformation, as doth her political system. For the same\r\ncause that renders the power of the Company’s several deputed governors\r\nperfectly arbitrary and discretional, in civil matters; namely, the\r\nDirectors having preserved to themselves the charge of immediately\r\ndirecting and superintending those governments; confers, upon these\r\ndeputed governors, a like arbitrary and discretional power, in military\r\nmatters. And surely it is impossible to conceive any thing more\r\nridiculously extravagant, than is this military system of the Company;\r\nwhich affords to each governor of four different capital settlements,\r\nthe absolute, independent, and discretional power, of applying the\r\nmilitary force of his own government; and likewise of directing the\r\nmeasures of defence: whilst each, of these four governors, holds a\r\nparticular interest of his own, which is, not only distinct from, but\r\nopposite to that of all the others.\r\n\r\nCan it be supposed that four men, thus opposite in their personal views\r\nand interests, and thus independent of each other, should heartily\r\nconcur in general measures; or should cordially unite in a system of\r\ncommon defence? Common sense informs us that they will not; and\r\nexperience convinces us that they do not. For it hath been known that\r\none, of these settlements, hath furnished arms and ammunition; and hath\r\notherwise befriended a power, at open war with one of the others. And,\r\nin the case of any one of these settlements being attacked, the others\r\nare extremely backward in supporting it; because each, of the four\r\ngovernors, giving the preference to his own particular charge, in which\r\nhis own personal interest is more immediately concerned, considers all\r\ncommunication of his force, to any of the other settlements, as a\r\ndiminution of his own security, and even of his importance. So that,\r\nupon such terms, the union betwixt these four distinct, and mutually\r\nindependent, governments, can scarcely be termed federal.\r\n\r\nMoreover, each of these four governors possesses, within the limits of\r\nhis own government, the discretionary power of making war and peace.\r\nAnd, so, hath the opportunity, whenever it shall suit the purpose of his\r\nown personal interest, to pick a quarrel, and engage his government in\r\nwar, with some one of the neighbouring native states. Nor is this an\r\nimaginary evil; or a simple supposition of what may possibly happen; it\r\nis a real case; an abuse that hath actually existed. For we can produce\r\nseveral instances where these governors, more particularly on the coast\r\nof Cormondel, have commenced, and industriously protracted, wars with\r\nthe neighbouring states, expressly for the purpose of plunder and\r\npeculation.\r\n\r\nAnd, from this discretionary power of peace and war lodged in the hands\r\nof these several governors, and the consequent abuse thereof, flow the\r\nfollowing evils to the sovereign. First, the governor, thus warring,\r\nexhausts and consumes the treasure of his constituent; to the end that\r\nhe and his associates, may gain occasion to pocket a part. Second, by\r\nthese offensive wars, he wastes and destroys that force, which was\r\nintended by the sovereign for defence: and, thereby, exposes his own\r\ncharge, naked and defenceless, to the attack of other enemies. And\r\nthird, by these wanton unnecessary and unjust wars, he provokes the\r\nhatred and jealousy of all the neighbouring states; and, thus, converts\r\ninto enemies, those native powers, who would, otherwise, be amicable and\r\nfriendly to the sovereign.\r\n\r\nTo correct these, and many other abuses of a like nature, which flow\r\nfrom this absurd military system of the Company, it is evidently and\r\nindispensably necessary, that there should be instituted, one supreme\r\nhead of military government. Which, being vested with the supreme power\r\nof making peace and war in India, shall restrain these several\r\nterritorial governors, from engaging in unnecessary wars with their\r\nneighbours. And which, possessing the supreme direction of the common\r\nforce, shall, in the case of particular or general danger, apply that\r\nforce to the most proper and necessary purposes.\r\n\r\nNow it is naturally proper, that the same intermediate supreme power,\r\nwhich superintends the political government, should likewise supremely\r\nsuperintend the military government, and defence, of those Indian\r\ndominions. And, for this latter purpose, the choice of a proper\r\nsituation, for the residence of that supreme power, becomes likewise a\r\npoint of most essential consequence. For it is evident, on the one hand,\r\nthat this military superintending power ought not to exist in any one of\r\nthese territorial governments; nay it ought not to reside in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of any one rich native state; because, in either\r\nof these two situations, it is liable to be tempted, by views of avarice\r\nor ambition, to apply the general force, to its own personal purposes;\r\nand, if so, the cure would be worse than the disease: and, on the other\r\nhand, it is no less evident, (from the reasons assigned on the similar\r\nhead in the political system) that this supreme military power ought to\r\nbe situated so centrically near, to all the several territorial\r\ngovernments, as that it may, at all times and seasons, be capable of\r\nkeeping up a ready and speedy correspondence with each.\r\n\r\nThe distant and unconnected situation, of these four capital\r\ngovernments, is likewise a mighty obstruction to a secure system of\r\ndefence. For, the wind, blowing in those seas for six months from one\r\nquarter of the compass, and for the other six months from the opposite\r\nquarter, doth, alternately, cut off in a great measure all naval\r\ncommunication betwixt these four governments. For instance, during the\r\nviolence of the south west monsoon, that is, from the middle of April\r\ntill the middle of July, it is almost impracticable for ships to pass\r\nfrom Bengal to Madrass: and, during the three more moderate months of\r\nthat monsoon, this passage is difficult and tedious. And during the\r\nnorth east monsoon, the passage is much the same from Madrass to Bengal.\r\nBut the communication betwixt Bombay, and these two settlements, is\r\nstill more obstructed. For Bombay, being situated in lat. 19 deg. north,\r\non the west side of the peninsula of India, it is almost impossible,\r\nfrom the latter end of November till the middle of February, for ships\r\nfrom Bombay, bound for the Bay of Bengal, to round the island of\r\nCeyloan: and, for the other three months of the north east monsoon, they\r\nare obliged, in order to weather Ceyloan, to stand over to the eastward\r\nalmost as far as Atchen head, and back again to the island; a run of\r\nabout 20 degrees. From the end of April till August, it is almost\r\nimpracticable for ships from the Bay and bound for Bombay, to round\r\nCeyloan; and in the other three months of the south west monsoon, that\r\npassage is difficult and tedious. And, even in the fair passage, the run\r\nbetwixt Bengal and Bombay is seldom made in less than a month. Moreover,\r\nduring the force of the south west monsoon on the west side of the\r\npeninsula, that is, from the middle of May till the middle of August, it\r\nis extremely dangerous for ships to attempt running in for Bombay: the\r\nweather being then so extremely thick, that sometimes a solar\r\nobservation cannot be obtained for several days together: and if a ship\r\nshould, in such circumstances, run in for the land, which in such\r\nweather is not distinguishable at three leagues distance, and should\r\nmiss the opening of the harbour, which is but small, it is more than\r\nprobable that she would not be able to clear the shore, with the wind\r\nblowing fiercely right on, and rolling before it a heavy sea. As to\r\nBencolen, circumstances are nearly the same with it, as betwixt Bengal\r\nand Madrass.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident, that this obstructed naval communication, betwixt the\r\nfour chief governments must, in many respects, greatly weaken the common\r\ndefence: and must greatly augment, to the sovereign, the charge, in both\r\nmen and money, of maintaining and defending those dominions and\r\npossessions. Seeing it must necessitate him to keep up, in each of those\r\ngovernments, a force sufficient to defend it against the whole united\r\nstrength of an offensive enemy, without trusting to any aid from the\r\nothers: because, otherwise, he runs the risk of losing them all singly,\r\nto a force that can overpower but one of them.\r\n\r\nBut all the danger, inconveniences, and extraordinary expence, arising\r\nfrom this obstructed naval communication, may be obviated and removed,\r\nby establishing one supreme center of military defence; so situated,\r\nwith respect to the several parts of those truly valuable territorial\r\ndominions, as that the communication betwixt it and them shall, in\r\neither monsoon, be not only practicable but speedy and easy. For it is\r\nevident that, in such a situation, this supreme center of defence could,\r\nat all times, receive speedy notice of any impending danger, or actual\r\nattack; and that, upon such notice, it could immediately transport its\r\nown garrison, by sea; as well as collect aid from the other settlements.\r\nSo that the garrison of this supreme center of defence would act as an\r\narmy of observation; ever ready to pour in, at any quarter, on the back\r\nof an aggressive enemy. And, of course, such a center of defence must\r\nconnect, and unite, the strength of all the several parts of British\r\ndominion in India.\r\n\r\nNow it appears that, the situation of residence, becomes a circumstance,\r\nhighly essential to the efficacy of each purpose, proposed from this\r\nsupreme intermediate power. And it farther appears that one, and the\r\nsame, situation is required, for all these several purposes: seeing\r\nthat, from a convenient naval port, situated at a proper distance from\r\nthe limits of all the territorial governments; and, at the same time, so\r\ncentrically near to each, that the communication with all the several\r\nparts of dominion will be speedy and easy; this supreme power would, in\r\nthe first place, completely and effectually, faithfully and honourably\r\nsuperintend, enforce, and controul the measures of political government,\r\nas well as the conduct of military government: and, in the second place,\r\nit would unite and connect the general strength of those dominions, and\r\ncompletely secure the defence of the whole.\r\n\r\nBut, of the several settlements possessed by the Company in India,\r\nBengal and Madrass are evidently disqualified for this seat of\r\nresidence; not only because the communication betwixt them and the other\r\nsettlements is, at certain seasons, altogether cut off; but because they\r\nare, themselves, territorial governments; and therein, the very object\r\nto be controuled. Bencolen is, in every respect, out of the question.\r\nAnd, there then remains only Bombay; which is so far possessed of the\r\nproperties requisite to this residence, in that it is, at present, not\r\ngreatly embarked in territorial dominion; and is, likewise, a sea port.\r\nBut in respect of communication, with the truly valuable possessions of\r\nBritain in India, Bombay is altogether unfit to be either the residence\r\nof the supreme controuling power, or yet the center of defence; as must\r\nappear from the preceding description; which was more particularly\r\nenlarged, for the express purpose of evincing this. Far from being a\r\nproper center of defence, all the force that is lodged at Bombay becomes\r\ndetached, and completely lost to the defence of Britain’s truly valuable\r\npossessions; at least on any sudden emergency. Indeed Bombay is, in\r\nevery thing, respecting either dominion or commerce, a dead load, and\r\nuseless settlement; saving it be for the sole purpose of a naval port,\r\nor a place for refitting our squadrons.\r\n\r\nBut the choice of Bombay for a naval port, is the most dangerous and\r\nfatal error, in the whole absurd system of the Company’s defence: seeing\r\nthat, by this absurd choice, Britain loses the use of her naval force;\r\nwhich is her capital strength of defence, against the attack of France,\r\nher only dangerous enemy in India—As will appear—It is impossible that\r\nships, the best fitted from Europe, can subsist, in those seas, for two\r\nyears, without a thorough repair: and more particularly in time of war;\r\nwhen action hath happened, and is again expected. And this thorough\r\nrepair they cannot obtain but in a naval port, properly filled with\r\ndocks, or careening platforms. Bombay is the only naval port, thus\r\nfitted by Britain, in India; consequently the squadron of Britain must\r\nretire, at least every second year, to Bombay, for repair. But the\r\nBritish squadron being once retired to Bombay, (as is common, in\r\nOctober,) which is situated in lat. 19 degrees north, on the west side\r\nof the peninsula; it is as effectually excluded, for five months, from\r\nthe bay of Bengal, and more particularly from Bengal itself, as if it\r\nwas still in Europe. And, during these five months, the enemy may either\r\nscour that Bay with single cruizers, or she may transport, and, without\r\nopposition, land a force in Bengal; and these said five months are the\r\nvery fittest in the whole year for land operations. This must be\r\nthoroughly understood by all those who are acquainted with the\r\nnavigation of those seas: and could be here readily demonstrated; was it\r\nnot that, by publickly pointing out our own weakness, we should point\r\nout to the enemy her strength. It is most certain that, if France\r\nunderstands her own advantage, (and it is to be apprehended she is but\r\ntoo well acquainted with it): she may either waste and consume the\r\nBritish squadron, through preventing its repair; or otherwise she may\r\neffect every purpose, against Bengal, nay against Madrass, with as great\r\nsecurity, as if there was no British squadron in India: ever so long as\r\nBritain shall continue her only naval port at Bombay. Nor is there any\r\nalternative. For as to that ridiculous notion, of carrying a squadron of\r\nlarge ships up the river of Bengal to repair, no commander in his senses\r\nwould, in the time of war, when he expected to be equally matched by the\r\nenemy, so soon as the season arrived, incur the risk of losing some of\r\nhis ships, in the passage up and down that incredibly dangerous river;\r\nand still less would he subject himself to the certainty of losing half\r\nhis hands, by that putrid unhealthy air at Culpee, or Ingelee. Neither\r\nwould he be mad enough, in the while of a hot war, to use that dangerous\r\nexpedient, of half repairing at Trincamalay; where he is liable to be\r\nsurprized by an enemy, in the act of repairing. In fine, so long as\r\nBombay continues to be our only naval port, our commanders must, of\r\nnecessity, either waste and lose their squadron; or else they must\r\nretire to Bombay, at the least, once in two years; and, thereby leave\r\nthe seas, with all our valuable possessions in the Bay of Bengal, freely\r\nexposed to the attack of an enemy, for five months.\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that, if Britain means to avail herself of her\r\nnaval force, which is the principal defence of her dominion and commerce\r\nin India, she must establish a proper naval port, on the east side of\r\nthe peninsula; because, on that side lay all her truly valuable\r\npossessions, and commerce. And that port, which I mean to propose, is in\r\nevery respect completely qualified for this purpose: though I cannot, in\r\nthis publication, specify the place; lest the enemy should anticipate,\r\nand take the advantage of our shameful neglect.\r\n\r\nI am sensible it will be immediately exclaimed that we have already too\r\nmany possessions in India; and that this is no time to increase our\r\nsettlements there; and thereby to increase the drain of our native\r\nstrength, as well as the expence of treasure.\r\n\r\nBut, to this, I answer, that this new establishment would not encrease\r\nthe number of our capital settlements in India: on the contrary, it\r\nwould diminish it, from four to three: for it would suppress, in the\r\nfirst place, Bombay; which is in every respect a truly useless\r\nsettlement; and would therefore be exchanged for this new settlement;\r\nwhich would serve to connect the whole strength of this dominion; as\r\nwell as to promote a variety of other very important purposes. In the\r\nsecond place, Bencolen would be reduced to the degree of a subordinate,\r\nimmediately under the direction of the resident at this new settlement;\r\nand completely secure under its protection.\r\n\r\nAs to the drain of native strength, this establishment would, instead of\r\nadding, considerably decrease it: for the garrison, together with the\r\nartillery, &c. of Bombay, would be transported thither; as likewise\r\nwould the better part of the garrison at Bencolen: and these two\r\ngarrisons, being placed there, would form an army of observation, for\r\nall our valuable possessions, as hath been described; consequently the\r\nterritorial governments would not demand that degree of force, which is\r\nrequisite at present, when each stands on its own bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd with regard to the expence of treasure, I shall only observe that,\r\nit is most unaccountably absurd in Britain to send out to India, a\r\nsquadron of 17 ships of the line, besides frigates, (as she did in last\r\nwar,) for the protection of her dominion and commerce in that country;\r\nwhich squadrons become evidently unprofitable to that purpose, through\r\nthe circumstance of wanting a properly situated naval port; when less\r\nthan a single year’s charge, of such squadron, would suffice to\r\ncompletely fit up a naval port, so situated as that, from thence, her\r\nnaval force would completely effect its intended purpose. For I affirm,\r\nthat the port which I propose would be completely fitted up, in every\r\nrespect, as a naval port, for less expence than one year’s charge of\r\nsuch squadron; seeing that I do not propose docks, but platforms for\r\ncareening, as at Batavia; and these are prepared, in infinitely less\r\ntime, and at much less charge than docks; whilst they are far more\r\nconvenient and expeditious for repairing large ships, than these docks\r\nat Bombay. And, as to the fortification immediately requisite, it would\r\nbe but little expensive, and would demand but little time to rear it:\r\nbecause it would be perfectly accessible to the ships; and so, whilst it\r\nprotected them, would be protected by them.\r\n\r\nMoreover no part of the treasure, expended on originally fitting this\r\nnaval port, would come immediately out of Britain’s proper treasury; for\r\nthe whole would be defrayed by the dependent dominion in India. And this\r\nnew establishment would, in a very little time, not only support its own\r\ncharge, but would richly reimburse Britain for her original cost. Seeing\r\nit would, in the first place, as a colony or settlement, yield her\r\nimmediate treasure, together with sundry commodities peculiar to itself;\r\nand, in a little time, it would, under proper conduct, produce rich\r\nmanufactures. In the second place, it would, as an Emporium, (for which\r\npurpose it is perfectly adapted by its situation,) greatly improve the\r\ncommerce of Britain in India: and as a centrical magazine or warehouse,\r\nfor the commodities of China as well as India, it would reduce the term\r\nof the Company’s voyages to one year; and, thereby, reducing the expence\r\nof her carriage nearly one third, it would enable her to sell cheaper;\r\nand consequently advance her commerce in Europe. Likewise the Company’s\r\nships rendezvousing and departing from this port for Europe, under\r\nproper convoy, this would secure her trade from that imminent danger to\r\nwhich it is exposed, from her ships rendezvousing singly, at that button\r\nof an island, St. Helena: a circumstance that may, in the very first\r\nyear of a French war, completely ruin this Company; as that enemy is now\r\nperfectly acquainted with her route. Now Bombay is perfectly useless to\r\nall these, and indeed to every other purpose; as can be readily\r\ndemonstrated: and the whole benefit derived from it, as a colony or\r\nsettlement, in the year, doth not suffice to defray one month’s expence.\r\n\r\nBut this new establishment, being once fitted up as a naval port, from\r\nwhence the squadrons of Britain can, in either monsoon, command all her\r\nvaluable possessions; this same establishment would, at same time,\r\ncompletely suit for the residence of that supreme intermediately\r\nsuperintending power. For this port is situated, at such a distance from\r\nall the territorial governments, as would suffice to effectually prevent\r\nthe controuling power, from interfering in the immediate execution of\r\ngovernment. And, having said that it is perfectly well situated for a\r\nnaval port, it follows that the communication, betwixt it and all the\r\nparts of the British dominion in India, must be speedy and easy, in\r\neither monsoon: and consequently that, from this residence, this supreme\r\npower can effectually superintend, enforce, and controul the measures of\r\npolitical, as well as of military, government, in this whole dominion.\r\nAnd, being the center of naval defence, it must be the only proper\r\ncenter of land defence: seeing the squadron will be ever at hand, to\r\ntransport its land force, to any part of this dominion, that may be in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nAnd thus have I accomplished that which I proposed: having planned the\r\ndesign of an intermediate power which, in such a situation as hath been\r\ndescribed, would establish a completely regular system of government,\r\ncivil as well as military, in the whole present or future dominion of\r\nBritain in India: nay which would, in the hands of national government,\r\nrender the task of governing this Indian dominion, as facil and easy, as\r\nit is to govern the small Isle of Man. And, the seat of its residence\r\nbeing at same time the center of naval and land defence, it would\r\ncompletely connect the, otherwise, divided strength of the several\r\ngovernments: and would establish the general defence, upon a footing so\r\nsecure, that no enemy, either European or native, would dare to attack\r\nBritish dominion in India. It likewise appears that the drain of native\r\nstrength, requisite to maintain this whole dominion, would but little\r\nexceed that which Britain expends on maintaining the two barren\r\nfortresses, of Gibraltar and St. Philips’s. Whilst no part of the\r\npecuniary charge, of either establishing or afterwards supporting this\r\nsystem of government, nor yet of the land and even naval defence, would\r\ncome out of the treasury of Britain; but would all be defrayed by the\r\ndependent dominion.\r\n\r\nI have farther demonstrated the moral impossibility of governing and\r\nmaintaining this Indian dominion, by means of the Company; upon any\r\nother terms, than these, of constituting her sovereign at home as well\r\nas abroad; and of conferring, upon her Directors, the sovereign\r\nexecution of government in Britain, as well as in that dependent\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nAnd I have endeavoured to rouze and awake the nation, to some sense of,\r\nand regard to, the interest she holds in this Indian dominion; by a\r\nslight descriptive sketch of the nature, and degree, of benefit received\r\nby her from it, for some years past. And, as the sensation received from\r\nfact and experience makes ever a stronger impression on the mind, than\r\nthat which is conveyed by speculative argument, I shall here again apply\r\nto the experience of the public, on this topic; which cannot be too much\r\ninculcated, nor presented in too many different points of view; at this\r\ntruly critical juncture, when nothing less than the most speedy\r\napplication, of the most vigorous measures, can prevent the total loss,\r\nof this most important object to Britain; either through the final ruin\r\nof the countries themselves; or, otherwise, by the assault of enemies.\r\n\r\nBritain feels a general failure of credit, not only in the East India\r\nCompany, but in individuals: and this failure of credit she can ascribe\r\nto no other cause, than to some extraordinary defect of numerical\r\ncirculation, or a deficiency of numerical specie, sufficient to support\r\nthe wonted credit of paper. How happens this want of numerical specie to\r\nbe so severely felt, all of a sudden; or from whence should such defect\r\narise? Assuredly from a decrease of her wonted influx of numerical\r\nspecie; whilst her drain of that specie continues to be at least the\r\nsame as formerly. But what channel or source, of Britain’s influx, hath\r\nbeen dried up so suddenly, as to create this surprizing failure of\r\nnumerical circulation? We have shown it to originate in Indian dominion;\r\nwhich being, through misgovernment, reduced to a ruinous state, the\r\nconsequent wonderful decrease of revenue, hath obliged the Company, to\r\nabsorb and dry up that channel of Indian private fortunes; which, till\r\nwithin these two years, used to convey into Britain, by foreign\r\nCompany’s bills, &c. at least 700,000 l. _per annum_, in numerical\r\nspecie, or what is equivalent. And as Britain hath, during the two years\r\nthat this channel was dried up, been continuing that drain, which she\r\ncould barely support, when aided by that private fortune influx, it is\r\nplain that, within these two years, she must have diminished the\r\nstanding stock of her numerical circulation, at least, 1,400,000 l. And\r\none year, more of only an equally decreased degree of influx, will\r\ndiminish her circulating stock 2,100,000 l. and so on. But a total\r\ndeprivation of the influx received, for some years past, from Indian\r\ndominion, will, annually, double the diminution of circulating stock.\r\n\r\nAnd, from this view, the nation may draw the following just inferences:\r\nfirst, the mighty value and importance, of this Indian dominion, to\r\nBritain; in point of financial aid; as well as in other weighty\r\nrespects. Second, the mighty alteration of circumstances, in these\r\nIndian countries, since the time they became subjected to the dominion\r\nof the Company; as also, the present ruinous state of that dominion. And\r\nfrom these two inferences she may deduce, that conclusion which hath\r\nbeen just mentioned, that nothing less than the most speedy application\r\nof the most vigorous and effectual measures, can possibly save those\r\ncountries from final ruin; and Britain from consequent bankruptcy,\r\npoverty, loss of credit, of commerce, navigation, naval power, &c.\r\n\r\nI have, in this hasty production, sketched out the nature of the\r\nnecessary measures; but the application of these measures depends\r\nentirely upon the nation’s exerting her own attention. I am far from\r\nmeaning to work upon the passions, I apply only to the reason and\r\nunderstanding of men; for had not respect to decorum, and to the dignity\r\nof government, restrained me, I might, on this subject, have thrown out\r\nmany things, that must have excited discontent and indignation.\r\nNevertheless the importance and urgency of the case obliges me to add,\r\n(and, without this, all I have said can avail nothing,) that unless the\r\nnation shall exert herself most vigorously in this her own dearest\r\nconcern, she must not look for any such effectual measures, as will\r\nsuffice to prevent these disasters.\r\n\r\nFor the nation must consider, that her present administration consists\r\nof the very men who transacted, and (by their truly reverberating eccho)\r\nconfirmed, to the Company, the second[2] grant of the Dewanny: knowing\r\nthat this Dewanny was nothing other than the sovereignty of a mighty\r\ndominion, dependent upon the Crown, and Nation, of Britain: and,\r\nconsequently that, by subjecting the numerous inhabitants of those\r\ncountries to the dominion of a few merchants, incapable of administring\r\nany sort of government, they were consigning over to tyranny and\r\nanarchy, intolerable oppression and ruin, many millions of men, who\r\nwere, to all intents and purposes, subjects of Britain. And they are the\r\nmen who, during the four years that elapsed since that grant, have\r\nfurnished the force to support this tyranny and anarchy: and, in spite\r\nof——enacting a farce, wherein the Directors were compelled to perform\r\nthe same part in Europe, that the native Nabobs have exhibited in India.\r\nIt cannot, therefore, be expected that they will, willingly, change\r\ntheir plan of conduct: seeing that, besides their former motives, they\r\nhave the additional one of obstinacy; or shame of standing\r\nself-condemned, for past mismanagement, should they now alter their\r\nmeasures. It is rather to be supposed that they will continue the cloke\r\nof the Company; together with the Directorial farce: and that, to\r\nsupport the broken credit of the Company, (broken by collusive\r\nmanagement,) they will, through eccho, grant her a power, to force her\r\npaper upon the public, for its money. As also that, under the pretext of\r\nhonouring the nation with some share in the charge of this sovereignty,\r\n(under the Company, but no share in the profits,) they will gradually\r\nthrust her shoulders under that whole load, which, as the Company must\r\nmanage it, will soon become intolerable. And, by the aid of these fresh\r\nreinforcements, they will juggle it and bungle it, and bungle it and\r\njuggle it on, for one, or possibly two, years longer: and then Nation\r\nand Company will both tumble together, into the pit of bankruptcy,\r\nperdition, and despair.\r\n\r\nBut shall the nation, with eyes open, suffer the pilot to crowd\r\nstemlings on the rocks, which have already grazed the ship’s bottom? No,\r\nwe must about ship, and call another hand to the helm. Matters, it is to\r\nbe hoped, are not yet past remedy; the channel is obvious; if the nation\r\nwill but put to her hand. His Majesty can have no real interest but what\r\nis common with that of his people: and, however the views of the Crown\r\nmay, in some cases, differ a little from these of the people; in this\r\nparticular case they must both exactly concur. He will, here, hearken to\r\nthe voice of his people: and a little popular heat will force into\r\nadministration something of that patriotic ambition, fire, spirit, and\r\nenterprize, which alone can save this nation from dreadful impending\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nBut if the nation, sunk in the bed of slavish sloth, inebriated with the\r\ntransforming Circean cap, enervated and emasculated by the lewd embraces\r\nof sensual pleasure, shall slight and disregard her own dearest\r\nconcerns: like the prodigal debauchee, who chides from him the faithful\r\nfriend that attempts recalling him to sober reflection; and implicitly\r\nconfides in the management of a steward, who hath already wasted the\r\nbetter part of his fair patrimony: then let the nation, some two or\r\nthree years hence, recollect, that she was advised of her danger, by a\r\nhasty production, issued about the middle of January, 1773: though not\r\nthought of, until that most disinterested of all possible ministers had,\r\nby way of remedying all evils, dispatched _his Secret Committee_ to the\r\nIndia House: there to inspect the Company’s private œconomy: a thing,\r\nwith which neither law, justice, government, nor nation hath any thing\r\nto do; and which, unless in cases of bankruptcy, is sacred to the\r\nmeanest individual. As if, from the Company’s books of accounts, it was\r\npossible to discover the cause of abuse in the government of those\r\nIndian dominions: or, as if schemes of saving to the Company, one\r\nshilling _per_ ton, freight of her cargoes: or, three pence _per_ pound,\r\nin warehouse room, would retrieve the, almost ruined, Interest of\r\nBritain in India.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  We must make a wide difference betwixt the first and second grants of\r\n  this Dewanny, (as it is termed.) The first grant was made for only two\r\n  years, at a time when the then ministry were in a great measure\r\n  unacquainted with the nature of the thing which they granted: having\r\n  been deceived by base art: nor did this ministry, in the course of\r\n  their administration, exert any manner of ministerial influence over\r\n  the Directors. But far different were the lights, as well as the\r\n  conduct of that ministry which, on the expiration of the first two\r\n  years, renewed that grant for the long term of five years.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\nMissing or obscured punctuation was corrected.\r\n\r\nTypographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n\r\nSpelling and hyphenation were made consistent when a predominant form\r\nwas found in this book; otherwise it was not changed.",
