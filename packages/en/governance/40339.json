Although _Heraclitus Ridens_ and its opponent\r\n_Democritus Ridens_ initiated the dialogue form for the newspaper\r\nseventy-two days before the _Observator_, their relatively short run\r\nrelegates these pioneers to a shadowy background, as it does the even\r\nearlier trade paper in dialogue, the _City and Country Mercury_\r\n(1667).[4] The eighty-two issues of _Heraclitus Ridens_ and thirteen of\r\n_Democritus Ridens_ cannot be compared in quantity to the 931 issues of\r\nthe _Observator_ published three or four times a week from 13 April 1681\r\nto 9 March 1687, nor can their stiff dialogues be compared in importance\r\nto L'Estrange's much fuller exploitation of the form. Consequently, even\r\nthough he did not initiate the newspaper in dialogue form, L'Estrange is\r\nunanimously given the honor of having popularized the form, or, in the\r\nwords of Richmond P. Bond, of having \"borrowed the dialogue and fastened\r\nit on English journalism for a generation as a factional procedure.\"[5]\r\n\r\nImitators did not wait long. Nine days after the first _Observator_,\r\nL'Estrange's arch-enemy, Harry Care, changed to dialogue the _Popish\r\nCourant_ section of his _Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome_,\r\nrelinquishing the expository format which he had followed since 1678.\r\nLater, after the Glorious Revolution, the popularity of L'Estrange's\r\npaper is evident in the spate of imitative \"Observators\" that ensued:\r\n_The English Spy: Or, the Critical Observator_ (1693); _The Poetical\r\nObservator_ (1702); Tutchin's _Observator_ (1702--a Whig organ) and\r\nLeslie's _Observator_ (1704--a Tory organ); _The Comicall Observator_\r\n(1704); _The Observator Reviv'd_ (1707), and more. As late as 1716 there\r\nwas created a _Weekly Observator_. By the turn of the century, the very\r\nterm \"Observator\" had come to signify a controversy _in dialogue_.[6]\r\nInterestingly enough, even the typography of L'Estrange's _Observator_\r\nmay have left its mark on succeeding journals. A brief comparison of\r\nInterregnum newspapers (such as _Newes Out of Ireland_ in 1642, _The\r\nScotch Mercury_ in 1643, _The Commonwealth Mercury_ in 1658) with John\r\nDunton's _The Athenian Mercury_ (1693) and Charles Leslie's _Observator_\r\n(1704) reveals a marked difference in typography. In the earlier papers\r\nthe typography is generally uniform, with italics used for proper names\r\nand quotations, whereas L'Estrange's and Leslie's papers exhibit the\r\nwhole range of typeface available to the seventeenth-century printer.\r\nDissenter Dunton's _Athenian Mercury_, on the other hand, shows much\r\nless eccentricity in its typography, limiting itself to generous use of\r\nitalics only, while Defoe's _Review_ goes back to the earlier restraint\r\nand presents a neat, uniform page. Whether these typographical\r\ndifferences are attributable to particular political views or merely to\r\n\"schools\" of printing is difficult to say.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this obvious sort of superficial imitation, there are\r\nmany indications that L'Estrange's _Observator_ had a more permanent\r\ninfluence on posterity. It has been suggested that the periodical\r\nspecializing in query and answer between reader and editor, which was\r\ninitiated by John Dunton's _Athenian Mercury_ and which we still have\r\ntoday, may have been inspired by the _Observator's_ habitual retorts to\r\nopponents.[7] James Sutherland isolates in Defoe certain qualities of\r\nprose style which he attributes to Defoe's extensive reading of\r\nL'Estrange; and he sees L'Estrange's natural colloquial manner as\r\nsetting a pattern for journalists who followed him.[8] Far-fetched as it\r\nmay seem at first glance, even Addison's _Spectator_ shows a certain\r\nsimilarity to the _Observator_. Although the manner, tone, language, and\r\npolitical views of the two are antithetical, the _Spectator's_ peculiar\r\nblend of moralizing and diversion is reminiscent of L'Estrange's work.\r\nIn both papers we notice a serious didactic purpose tempered by literary\r\ntechniques and imaginative handling of material. Decades before\r\nAddison's famous credo--\"to make their Instruction Agreeable, and their\r\nDiversion useful ... to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit\r\nwith Morality\"[9]--L'Estrange had formulated a similar theory:\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: Where there has been Any thing of That which you\r\n    call Raillery, or Farce; It has amounted to no more then\r\n    a Speaking to the Common People in their Own Way....\r\n    He that Talks Dry Reason to them, does as good as treat\r\n    'em in an Unknown Tongue; and there's no Other way of\r\n    Conveying the True Sense, & Notion of Things, either to\r\n    their Affections, or to their Understandings, then by the\r\n    Palate....\r\n      (II, No. 15)\r\n\r\nAnd as a link between L'Estrange and Addison we have Defoe's analogous\r\npromise in \"the Introduction\" to the _Review_: \"After our Serious\r\nMatters are over, we shall at the end of every Paper, Present you with a\r\nlittle Diversion, as any thing occurs to make the World Merry.\"[10]\r\nThese notions rest, of course, on the ancient _dulce et utile_, though\r\nmodified in various ways in each of the three papers to suit the\r\ntemperaments of their writers, the tastes of their mass-audiences, and\r\ndifferent times. It is perhaps not irresponsible, then, to say that the\r\nsynonymous titles of Addison's and L'Estrange's periodicals symbolize an\r\naffinity of purpose and technique. Indeed, the _Observator_ can, in many\r\nways, be considered a rather crude and primitive ancestor of the\r\n_Spectator_.[11]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the _Observator_ and its main targets are clearly\r\nformulated in _Observator_ No. 1, as well as in the prefatory \"To the\r\nReader,\" which was written in 1683 for the publication of Volume 1 of\r\nthe collected papers. The \"faction\" which L'Estrange proposes to reprove\r\nconsists at first (1681-1682) of Shaftesbury's republican-minded\r\nfollowers and of the perpetrators of the Popish Plot. In his evaluation\r\nof the Plot, L'Estrange agrees with some modern historians,[12] for he\r\nnever doubted that it was a Whig fabrication, an invented cause around\r\nwhich the party members could rally and which neatly veiled the\r\nparliamentary power-struggle behind the scenes. Titus Oates is\r\nconsequently the _Observator's_ _bête noire_, and Andrew Marvell's\r\npamphlet, _The Growth of Popery_, is for L'Estrange the odious origin of\r\nthe Plot:\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: I do not know Any man throughout the whole Tract\r\n    of the Controversy that has held a Candle to the Devil\r\n    with a Better Grace then the Author of that Pamphlet ...\r\n    that Furnishes so Clear a Light toward the Opening of\r\n    the Roots, Springs, and Causes of our Late Miserable\r\n    Disorders, and Confusions.... Prethee let Otes'es\r\n    Popish Plot, Stand, or Fall, to it's Own Master; provided\r\n    that Marvels may be Allow'd to be the Elder Brother....\r\n                          (II, No. 16)\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1682, when the Whigs had ceased being an imminent\r\nthreat to the government and all but one of the Whig newspapers had been\r\nsilenced, L'Estrange turned his attack against the more moderate\r\nTrimmers, as illustrated in _Observator_ III, No. 88. But whether the\r\noffensive is against Whigs or Trimmers, Dissenters and advocates of\r\ntoleration are always in the line of L'Estrange's fire as chief\r\nsubverters of absolute monarchy and of the Church of England, as is\r\nevident in the satire of _Observator_ Nos. 13 and 110. On the eve of the\r\nGlorious Revolution, this rigid stand lost him the support of both the\r\nAnglican clergy and the universities, support of which he was so proud\r\nin his \"To the Reader.\" Finally, _Observator_ No. 1 singles out the Whig\r\npress as one of its chief targets. The \"Smith\" referred to in that first\r\nnumber is Anabaptist Francis \"Elephant\" Smith, publisher of the\r\noutrageous _Mirabilis Annus_ books, the inflammatory pamphlet _Vox\r\nPopuli_, and the offensive paper _Smith's Protestant Intelligence_;\r\n\"Harris\" is Benjamin Harris, publisher of the Whig paper, _Domestic\r\nIntelligence_. These, together with Harry Care (_Weekly Pacquet of\r\nAdvice from Rome_ and _Popish Courant_), Richard Janeway (_Impartial\r\nProtestant Mercury_), Langley Curtis (_The Protestant Mercury_), and\r\nhordes of anti-Royalist authors or publications are habitually quoted or\r\nreferred to in L'Estrange's counterpropaganda. His untiring countering\r\nof Whig publications earned him Nahum Tate's hyperbolic praise in _The\r\nSecond Part of Absalom and Achitophel_:\r\n\r\n    Than _Sheva_, none more loyal Zeal have shown,\r\n    Wakefull, as _Judah's_ Lion for the Crown,\r\n    Who for that Cause still combats in his Age,\r\n    For which his Youth with danger did engage.\r\n    In vain our factious Priests the Cant revive,\r\n    In vain seditious Scribes with Libels strive\r\n    T'enflame the Crow'd, while He with watchfull Eye\r\n    Observes, and shoots their Treasons as they fly.\r\n    Their weekly Frauds his keen Replies detect,\r\n    He undeceives more fast than they infect.\r\n    So _Moses_ when the Pest on _Legions_ prey'd,\r\n    Advanc'd his Signal and the Plague was stay'd.[13]\r\n\r\nParochial as these concerns seem today, the _Observator_ in its totality\r\ngoes far beyond the Harry Cares and \"Elephant\" Smiths in its exhortation\r\nto greater rationality in areas ancillary to but transcending politics\r\nproper. Its assiduous ridicule of Enthusiasm, following in the steps of\r\nMeric Casaubon and Henry More,[14] its analyses of political\r\nmanipulation of the naive populace, its explanations of psychological\r\nappeals, its Orwellian warnings against the snares of loaded diction and\r\nthe dangers of affective political rhetoric--all these efforts evident\r\nin the few _Observators_ represented here are an important step in the\r\ndirection of a less superstitious, less hysterical century.\r\nParadoxically, L'Estrange mobilized progressive ideas in the service of\r\nan archaic political and religious administration, thereby familiarizing\r\nthe man on the street with notions and attitudes commonly known as\r\nEnlightened.\r\n\r\nThe sugar coating in the _Observator_ is, however, as significant as the\r\npill, and distinguishes L'Estrange's journalism from his predecessors'.\r\nApart from the traditional satiric blend of verbal banter and polemic,\r\nwhich has received ample commentary,[15] his use of established literary\r\nmodes further enhances the colloquies, making them especially diverting\r\nfor his audience and interesting for us. As dialogues, the papers belong\r\nto a genre whose popularity has remained constant from Plato onward. The\r\nappeal of the form lies in its pleasurable verisimilitude, immediacy,\r\nadaptability to differing points of view, and, especially after the\r\nRestoration, in its potentiality for humorous repartee.[16] As\r\n_satiric_ dialogues, L'Estrange's sheets satisfy what seems to be a\r\nuniversal love of ridicule, an innate trait of the human mind, although\r\nthere is no agreement among students of satire as to its exact\r\npsychological operations. In addition to adopting this form, which\r\nbelongs to imaginative literature rather than to journalism, L'Estrange\r\nspices his _Observator_ with a number of other devices designed to\r\nprovide variety, change in speed, and amusement for his reader, who is\r\nin turn bullied, joshed, castigated, reasoned, or laughed into accepting\r\nL'Estrange's views.\r\n\r\nFrequently, for example, the dialogue gives way to a pointed anecdote\r\n(old or current, invented or factual), such as the story of Jack of\r\nLeyden in _Observator_ No. 1, or the following from a later dialogue,\r\nhumorously satirizing the dour William Prynne and the Puritans' strange\r\nconcepts of sin:\r\n\r\n    _Trimmer_: A Gentleman that had Cut-off his own hair on\r\n    the Saturday, came the next day to Church in his first Perriwig.\r\n    The Parson (that was already Enter'd into his Sermon)\r\n    turn'd his Discourse presently, from his Text in the\r\n    Holy Bible, to the Subject of Prynnes _Unloveliness of\r\n    Lovelocks_; and Thrash'd for a matter of a Quarter of an\r\n    hour, upon the Mortal Sin of Wearing False Hair. The\r\n    Gentleman, finding that he would never give him over,\r\n    'till he had Preach'd him into a Flat State of Reprobation,\r\n    fairly took off his Perriwig, and Clapt it upon One of the\r\n    Buttons at the Corner of the Pew. The Poor Man had not\r\n    One word more to say to the Perriwig; and was run so far\r\n    from his Text, that he could not for his heart find the way\r\n    home again: So that to make short on't; He gave the\r\n    People his Blessing, and Dismiss'd the Congregation.\r\n      (II, No. 21)\r\n\r\nFrequently, also, L'Estrange satirizes by means of parody or ludicrous\r\nexamples of his enemies' rhetoric or behavior, as in the case of the\r\n\"Dissenting Academies\" in _Observator_ No. 110. But most important of\r\nthe techniques for entertaining are his creation of carefully delineated\r\nspeaker-_personae_ and his \"Characters,\" again both borrowed from the\r\nliterary tradition.\r\n\r\nAfter the first twenty-nine _Observators_, which are experimental in\r\nthat \"Q\" and \"A\" have shifting personalities (as in Nos. 1 and 13),\r\nL'Estrange manipulates \"Whig\" and \"Tory\" for 171 papers, changes to\r\n\"Whig\" and \"Observator\" for 33 papers, briefly (six papers) shifts to\r\n\"Whig\" and \"Courantier,\" and finally settles down to \"Trimmer\" and\r\n\"Observator\" for the remaining 692 papers. In all these, the Tory\r\nsatirist (whether he be \"Tory\" or \"Observator\") is presented as the\r\nconventional \"snarling dog\" described by Robert C. Elliott,[17] with\r\nappropriate outbursts of polemic, invective, bitter irony, and railing\r\nhumor. Even the traditional crudity is there, although compared to, say,\r\nthe _Popish Courant_, L'Estrange manifests a Victorian restraint.\r\n\"Whig,\" on the other hand, is presented as a naive, credulous,\r\nnot-too-bright individual whose main fault is not so much that he is a\r\nWhig but that he is a Whig because he has no mental capacity for\r\ndiscrimination. The \"A\" speaker of No. 13 (apparently a humorous thrust\r\nat John Eachard, author of _Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the\r\nClergy_) with his preference for Prynne, Baxter, and Smith over Tacitus,\r\nLivy, and Caesar, is typical of the later \"Whig\" _persona_. Humorless,\r\nmisguided, and chronically given to believing even the most outrageous\r\ngossip, \"Whig\" cuts a foolish and therefore amusing figure when pitted\r\nagainst the sophisticated, trenchant-minded \"Tory.\" \"Trimmer\" is quite\r\ndifferent. L'Estrange here creates a much more intelligent opponent, one\r\nwho is given the liberty of satirizing \"Observator\" himself and even\r\npatronizing him with the nickname \"Nobs.\" Instead of naivete and obvious\r\nstupidity, \"Trimmer\" has the guile and surface morality of the perfect\r\nhypocrite, a \"pretending friend\" as \"Observator\" notes in _Observator_\r\nIII, Nos. 88 and 202. The humor in these later dialogues does not emerge\r\nfrom the \"Trimmer\" personality but from the frequent self-satire and\r\ncriticism on the part of L'Estrange. \"Trimmer,\" for example, is allowed\r\nto mock the prose style, figures of speech, stubbornness and\r\nrepetitiveness of \"Observator,\" as \"Trimmer's\" chiding tone in\r\n_Observator_ III, No. 88 suggests. To borrow a term from Robert C.\r\nElliott, the entertainment of these later colloquies resides primarily\r\nin the technique of the \"satirist satirized.\"[18] L'Estrange, in short,\r\ncreates both _adversariuses_ as _dramatis personae_ rather than as\r\nsimple straw men, a departure from the run-of-the-mill Restoration\r\ndialogue evident in the following interruption of his artfully built\r\nillusion:\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: For Varieties sake then, we'le to work another way.\r\n    Do You keep up your Part of Trimmer still: Do Just as\r\n    you use to do; and be sure to maintain your Character;\r\n    Leave the Whig and the Tory to Me.\r\n\r\n    _Trimmer_: For the Dialogue sake it shall be done.\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: But then you must Consider that there are Severall\r\n    sort of Trimmers: as your State-Trimmer, Your Law-Trimmer....\r\n\r\n    _Trimmer_: And You shall Suppose Mee to be a Statesman.\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: But of what Magnitude? A Lord? A Knight?...\r\n\r\n    _Trimmer_: Why truly Nobs, if they be all of a Price, I\r\n    don't care if I be a Lord.\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: We are over that Point then; And so I am your\r\n    Lordships most Humble Servant.\r\n\r\nBut this role playing within role playing is discarded at the end of the\r\npaper, the role of Lord being apparently too cumbersome:\r\n\r\n    _Trimmer_: No more of your Lordships, as you love me,\r\n    Nobs; for I am e'en as weary as a Dog of my Dignity.\r\n       (No. 242)\r\n\r\nThe \"Character,\" however, is not only L'Estrange's favorite satiric tool\r\nbut perhaps the literary form most frequently used in the _Observator_.\r\nL'Estrange himself attests to his partiality in his parting comment at\r\nthe close of the _Observator_:\r\n\r\n    _Obs._: For my Fancy lyes more to Character, then to\r\n    Dialogue; and whoever will be so Kind as to Furnish me\r\n    with Spitefull Materials, shall get his Own again with\r\n    Interest, in an Essay upon Humane Nature.\r\n        (III, No. 246)\r\n\r\nThe Character was, of course, still highly popular in the latter half\r\nof the century, as Chester Noyes Greenough's listings show,[19] so that\r\nin indulging his own taste, L'Estrange was also catering to the tastes\r\nof his public. Of whatever other value the _Observator_ may be to the\r\nmodern student, it is invaluable as a fine example of the\r\nstate-of-the-Character toward the end of the century. Practically every\r\ntype of Character analyzed by Benjamin Boyce in his two studies can be\r\nfound repeatedly in L'Estrange's dialogues:[20] the earlier imitations\r\nof Theophrastan Characters, with their parallelisms and antitheses; the\r\nOverburian Character, with its extravagant metaphors; the externally\r\ndramatized; the subjective; the sprung. There are Characters of\r\nideologies, of political parties, of virtues, of vices, of Whigs and\r\nDissenters (vices), of Tories and Anglicans (virtues). There are several\r\n\"Credo-Characters\" (confessions or manifestoes), and finally there is\r\nthe habitually dramatized self-exposing Character which becomes\r\nindistinguishable from the _dramatis persona_, as is the Character of\r\nthe Modern Whig in Nos. 13 and 110. Among the _Observators_ included\r\nhere, the definition of \"Dissenter\" in No. 1 is based on Character\r\ntechniques, as is the conceit of the Protestant as \"Adjective\r\nNoun-Substantive\" in the same number. So is also the lengthy exposure of\r\n\"Leaders\" in III, No. 202, beginning with \"They Talk, to the Ears, and\r\nto the Passions of their Hearers.\"\r\n\r\nA final comment about L'Estrange's prose, which has been variously\r\nlabeled \"colloquial,\" \"idiomatic,\" \"vulgar,\" \"coarse\"--all vaguely\r\ndescriptive terms suggesting value judgment, and none precise enough to\r\ngive an intelligible account of what L'Estrange actually does. In\r\naddition to the obvious device of choppy syntax and deliberately\r\ncareless constructions simulating extemporaneous speech, L'Estrange's\r\nfigures and proverbial material demonstrate his meticulous shaping of an\r\n\"applied prose\"[21] particularly suitable for the audience whose\r\nopinions he tried to sway. His metaphors and analogies tend to rely on\r\ncommonly known objects or experiences, and because of rhetorical\r\nnecessity they are almost always unpleasantly graphic. A random sampling\r\nyielded the following results: about twenty-five percent of the figures\r\nin the _Observator_ deal with some specific part of the human body\r\n(nails, spleen, mouth, eyes, ears, knees, heels, flesh, guts, belly) or\r\nphysiological processes (ulcerating, itching, chewing, digesting,\r\nspitting, reeking, seeing, crouching, sweating, gobbling). There is no\r\neuphemistic delicacy in these figures; L'Estrange carefully selects the\r\nmost earthy, common vehicles, thus achieving what James Sutherland has\r\ntermed \"racy\" and \"vigorous\" prose.[22] Another twenty-four percent of\r\nthe figures are based on common occupations, daily activities, or\r\nobjects familiar to the simpler citizen of London. These figures\r\nordinarily pivot on barter or trade (horse traders, hagglers, fishwives,\r\ncar men); on activities such as cooking, gambling, or glass-making; and\r\non such objects as clothing, bagpipes, paper-pellets, bonnets, and\r\nchamber-pots. The rest derive from the animal kingdom, the Scriptures,\r\nstreet-entertainment (jugglers, puppets, high-rope walkers) and folk\r\nmedicine (glysters and plasters). It is obvious that these\r\nfigures--their concreteness, sensuousness, and closeness to the daily\r\nexperience of the ordinary reader--are a main ingredient in the richly\r\ncolloquial texture of L'Estrange's prose, as is the proverbial material\r\nwhich he incorporates unsparingly.\r\n\r\nIn L'Estrange's language the law of the land cannot be misunderstood,\r\nfor it calls _a spade a spade_ (No. 106; T-S699).[23] The factions win\r\ntheir objectives _by hook or crook_ (No. 100; T-H588) even though they\r\nare as _mad as March Hares_ (No. 15; T-H148) and _as Blind as Beetles_\r\n(No. 15; T-B219). Certain things are _as clear as the Day_ (No. 25;\r\nT-D56) or _as plain as the nose o'my face_ (No. 40; T-N215), whereas\r\nothers are so confused that one can _make neither Head nor tayl on't_\r\n(No. 35; T-H258). When _noses are put out of joint_ (No. 38; T-N219) and\r\nTories are given a _bone to pick_ (No. 55; T-B522), there will obviously\r\nbe _no love lost betwixt_ Whigs and Tories (No. 97; T-L544).\r\n\r\nThus L'Estrange's Characters, together with the fanciful anecdotes,\r\nself-satire, parodies, and _personae_, provide the satire and humor in\r\nthe _Observator_, the whole being couched in familiar, pungent language.\r\nAs L'Estrange counters the faction, propagandizes, and exhorts to\r\nrational behavior, he also amuses and delights, always hoping that the\r\nlaughter provoked by his satiric treatment will cure what he saw as\r\nfollies of his age, always appealing to the common reader whose sense of\r\nhumor, he believed, was probably more developed than his sense.\r\n\r\n  California State College,\r\n  Dominguez Hills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n    1: The translations before 1681 are _The Visions of Dom Francisco de\r\n    Quevedo_ (1667); _A Guide to Eternity_ (1672); _Five Love-letters\r\n    from a Nun_ (1677); _The Gentleman-Apothecary_ (1678); _Seneca's\r\n    Morals_ (1678); _Twenty Select Colloquies of Erasmus_ (1679); and\r\n    _Tully's Offices_ (1680).\r\n\r\n    2: Various perspectives on L'Estrange's life and works can be found\r\n    in the following: George Kitchin, _Sir Roger L'Estrange_ (London,\r\n    1913) for L'Estrange's life and impact on the Restoration press; J.\r\n    G. Muddiman, _The King's Journalist_ (London, 1923) for L'Estrange's\r\n    rivalry with Henry Muddiman, editor of the _Oxford [London]\r\n    Gazette_; David J. Littlefield, \"The Polemic Art of Sir Roger\r\n    L'Estrange: A Study of His Political Writings, 1659-1688\"\r\n    (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, Yale University, 1961) for an\r\n    overview of L'Estrange as a political pamphleteer.\r\n\r\n    3: In 1679 L'Estrange wrote six new pamphlets and reprinted three\r\n    old ones; in 1680 eleven new and seventeen old; at the start of\r\n    1681, ten new and seventeen old. A probable norm of 1000-1500 copies\r\n    per pamphlet edition has been estimated by Joseph Frank, _The\r\n    Beginnings of the English Newspaper, 1620-1660_ (Cambridge, Mass.,\r\n    1961), p. 314; two orders of 1500 pamphlets each were given to the\r\n    Restoration printer Nathaniel Thompson, as noted by Leona\r\n    Rostenberg, \"Nathaniel Thompson, Catholic Printer and Publisher of\r\n    the Restoration,\" _The Library_, 3rd ser., X (1955), 195.\r\n\r\n    4: _Heraclitus Ridens_ was considered by generations of historians\r\n    as the first newspaper in dialogue; most recently, James Sutherland\r\n    (_English Literature of the Late Seventeenth Century_, Oxford, 1969,\r\n    p. 241) has given precedence to _The City and Country Mercury_.\r\n\r\n    5: _Studies in the Early English Periodical_ (Chapel Hill, 1957), p.\r\n    38.\r\n\r\n    6: Ibid., pp. 38-39.\r\n\r\n    7: Walter Graham, _English Literary Periodicals_ (New York, 1930),\r\n    pp. 38, 63, 168.\r\n\r\n    8: _On English Prose_ (Toronto, 1965), pp. 72-74.\r\n\r\n    9: _The Spectator_, No. 10, ed.

Arthur Wellesley Secord (Facsimile Text\r\n    Society, New York, 1938), I, 4.\r\n\r\n    11: Several of the literary techniques in the _Spectator_ had been\r\n    introduced into journalism by L'Estrange. _Spectator_ No. 1, for\r\n    example, presents a _persona_ in the character of \"Mr. Spectator\";\r\n    No. 2 contains a dream-allegory; Nos. 11 and 34 present indirect\r\n    discourse between _dramatis personae_; No. 19 sketches a Character\r\n    of the Envious Man--all literary modes abundant in the _Observator_.\r\n\r\n    12: See especially J.

The pieces reprinted from Volume I consist of the\r\n    prefatory \"To the Reader,\" and _Observator_ Nos. 1, 13, and 110; the\r\n    papers reprinted from Volume III consist of _Observator_ Nos. 88 and\r\n    202. In this edition the following editorial changes have been made:\r\n    black letter type is indicated by underlining; inverted letters have\r\n    been corrected; obvious compositor's errors have been corrected; and\r\n    inconsistencies in font due to compositors' carelessness have been\r\n    normalized. The frontispiece to this facsimile reprint is reproduced\r\n    from the Clark copy and measures approximately 13-7/16\" x 8-5/8\" in\r\n    the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVATOR\r\n\r\nTo the _READER_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost _Prefaces_ are, (Effectually) _Apologies_; and neither the _Book_,\r\nnor the _Author_, one Jot the _Better_ for them. If the _Book_ be\r\n_Good_, it will not _Need_ an _Apology_; If _Bad_, it will not _Bear_\r\nOne: For where a man thinks, by _Calling_ himself _Noddy_, in the\r\n_Epistle_, to _Atone_, for _Shewing_ himself to be one, in the _Text_;\r\nHe does (with Respect to the Dignity of an _Author_) but _Bind up Two\r\nFools_ in _One Cover_: But there's no more Trusting some People with\r\n_Pen, Ink, and Paper_, then the Maddest Extravagants in _Bedlam_, with\r\n_Fire_, _Sword_, or _Poyson_. He that _Writes Ill_, and _Sees_ it, why\r\ndoes he _Write on_? And, with a kind of _Malice Prepense, Murder_ the\r\n_Ingenious_ part of _Mankind_? He that _Really Believes_ he Writes\r\n_Well_; why does he pretend to _Think_ Otherwise? Now take it which way\r\nyou please, a man runs a Risque of his _Reputation_, for want, either of\r\n_Skill_, and _Judgment_, the _One_ way; Or of _Good Faith_, and _Candor_\r\nthe _Other_. Beside a Mighty Oversight, in _Imagining_ to bring himself\r\noff, from an _Ill_ Thing, _Done_, or _Said_, by Telling the World that\r\nhe did it for _This_ or _That Reason_. When a Book has once past the\r\n_Press_ into the _Publique_; there's no more _Recalling_ of it, then of\r\na _Word Spoken_, out of the _Air_ again. And a man may as well hope to\r\nReverse the _Decree_ of his _Mortality_, as the _Fate_ of his\r\n_Writings_. In short: When the _Dice_ are _Cast_, the _Author_ must\r\nstand his _Chance_.\r\n\r\nNow that I may not be thought to Enterfere with my self, by _Declaiming_\r\nagainst _One Preface_ in _Another_: I do here previously Renounce to All\r\nthe Little Arts and Forms of Bespeaking the _Good Will_ of the _Reader_;\r\nAs a _Practice_, not only _Mean_, _Light_, and _Unprofitable_; but\r\nwholly _Contrary_ to the _Bent_ of _My Inclination_; as well as\r\n_Inconsistent_ with the very _Drift_, and _Quality_ of my _Design_. For\r\nThese _Papers_ were _Written_, Indifferently, for the _Enformation_ of\r\nthe _Multitude_; and for the _Reproof_ of a _Faction_: _Two Interests_\r\nthat I am not much _Sollicitous_, or _Ambitious_, to _Oblige_: And upon\r\n_This Consideration_ it is, that I have _Address'd_ them to the _Reader_\r\nin _Generall_; as a _Calculation_ that will serve for _All Meridians_:\r\nBut if I could have Resolved upon a _Dedication_, with any _Particular\r\nMark_, or _Epithete_ of _Distinction_; it should have been, _To the\r\nIGNORANT, the SEDITIOUS_, or _the SCHISMATICAL Reader_; for _There_,\r\nproperly, lies _my Bus'ness_.\r\n\r\nThe Reader will find in the _First Number_ of This Collection, the _True\r\nIntent_, and _Design_ of the _Undertaking_; And he will likewise find,\r\nin the very _Date_ of it, (April 13. 1681.) the _Absolute Necessity_ of\r\nsome Such _Application_, to Encounter the _Notorious Falshoods_; the\r\n_Malicious Scandals_, and the _Poysonous Doctrines_ of _That Season_.\r\n\r\nWhether I had Sufficient _Ground_, or _Reason_, for the Warmth I have\r\nExprest in These Papers, upon Several Occasions, (out of an Affectionate\r\nSense of my _Duty_, and a _Zeal_ for the _Peace_, _Welfare_, and\r\n_Safety_ of my _Country_;) I _Dare_, and I _Do Appeal_ to the _King_,\r\nand his _Ministers_; to the _Consciences_ of as many of his Majesties\r\n_Subjects_, as are not _Stark Blind_ because they _WILL_ not _See_; and\r\nto the Justice of the Nation. I do _Appeal_, I say, to his Majesties\r\n_Proclamations_; to his _Royal Declaration_; Several _Orders_ of\r\n_Councel_; the _Examinations_, and _Confessions_ of _Unquestionable\r\nWitnesses_; The _Solemnity_ of so many _Tryals_, _Sentences_, and\r\n_Executions_; and the _Criminals_, Every Man of 'em, Either\r\n_Acknowledging_ the _Crime_, or _Justifying_ the _Treason_: But the\r\n_FACT_, however made as _Clear_ as the _Day_. There's the _Flight_ of\r\nthe _Conspirators_; Their _Arms Seiz'd_; Their _Councels Laid Open_;\r\n_Men Listed_; The _Methods_ of the _Confederacy Detected_, to the very\r\n_Time_, and _Place_ for the _Perpetration_ of the _Villany_; to the very\r\n_Circumstance_ of the _Providential Fire_ at _Newmarket_, that\r\n_Disappointed_ it. I have All These _Demonstrative Proofs_, and\r\n_Convincing Evidences_, to _Warrant_ me in the most _Violent\r\nPresumptions_ of a _Rebellion_ in _Agitation_: And the _Phanatiques\r\nThemselves_ made good the _Worst_ Things that ever I said of the\r\n_Party_: In _Vindication_ of the _Importunity_ of All my _Foreboding_,\r\nif not _Prophetical Suspicions_: Nay, they were come to the very\r\n_Point_, and _Crisis_ of the _Operation_, of That _Unaccountable_, and\r\n_Amazing Vote_. [_If his Majesty shall come by Any Violent Death (which\r\nGod Forbid) it shall_ be _Reveng'd to the Utmost upon the Papists_.] The\r\n_King_, and the _Duke_ were to be _Murder'd_ by _Republican_, and\r\n_Fanatical Rebells_: _There's_ your _VIOLENT DEATH_. And _Then_,\r\n[Reuenge it upon the Papists:] For [_the Thing_ (says _Keeling_) _was to\r\nbe laid upon the Papists as a Branch of the Popish Plot_. Walcots Tryal.\r\nFol.9.] And the _Next_ Step was, for the _Traytors_ to _Unriddle_ the\r\n_Mystery_, and to _Expound_, Who were the _Papists_. [_The Lord Mayor,\r\nand the Sheriffs_] _were Three_ of 'em. _They_, were to be Kill'd; And\r\n[_as many of the_ Lieutenancy _as they could get; And the Principal\r\nMinisters of State; My Lord_ Halifax, _My Lord_ Rochester, _and my_ Lord\r\nKeeper: (_They_ were _Three Papists more_.) _My Lord_ Keeper _was to\r\nhave been_ Hang'd _upon the same Post that_ College _had hung. Sir_ John\r\nMoor _to be_ Hung-up _in_ Guildhall, _as a Betrayer of the Rights and\r\nLiberties of the City. And the Judges Lordships to be_ Flay'd, _and_\r\nStuff'd, _and_ Hung-up _in_ Westminster Hall: _And a great many of the_\r\nPensionary Parliament Hang'd-up, _as Betrayers of the Rights of the\r\nPeople_. Walcots Tryal, p. 15.] You have here, a _Practical Explanation_\r\nof the _True-Protestant Way_, (in case of _the King's Violent Death_)\r\n_of Revenging it to the Utmost upon the Papists_. And This Intended\r\n_Assassination_ (says _Ferguson_ (in the same Page)) [_Is a Glorious\r\nAction, and such an Action as_ I HOPE TO SEE PUBLIQUELY GRATIFY'D BY\r\nPARLIAMENT; _And Question not but you will be Fam'd for it, and_ Statues\r\n_Erected for you, with the Title of_ LIBERATORES PATRIAE. _Ibid._] Now\r\nwhen Matters were come to _This Pass_ once, I think it was High Time to\r\nWrite _Observators_.\r\n\r\nI might Enlarge my self, upon the _Inducements_ that Mov'd me to Enter\r\nupon This _Province_; The _Needfullness_ of some _Popular Medium_ for\r\nthe _Rectifying_ of _Vulgar Mistakes,_ and for _Instilling_ of\r\n_Dutyfull_, and _Honest Principles_ into the _Common People_, upon That\r\n_Turbulent_, and _Seditious Juncture_: But I am not Willing to _Clogg_\r\nmy _Preface_, with the _Repetition_ of what I have spoken so _Expressly_\r\nto, in the _Book_.\r\n\r\nI am now to Advertise the _Reader_, in the next Place; That as I have\r\nnot Strain'd, so much as _One Syllable_, in the _Whole Course_ of _These\r\nPapers_, beyond the _Line_ of _Truth_, Nor let fall _One Word, Contrary_\r\nto my _Conscience_; Nor _Layd-on_ so much as _One False Colour_, for a\r\n_Blind_, or a _Disguise_: As I have not done any Thing of All This, I\r\nsay; Nor _Gratify'd_ so much as _One Passion_ to the Prejudice, of any\r\n_MAN_, or _THING_; or of _Common Justice it Self_: So neither, on the\r\n_Other_ hand, was I less _Cautious_, and _Considerate_, in the\r\n_Undertaking_ of This _Duty_, then I have been _Clear_, and _Impartial_,\r\nin the _Discharge_, and _Manage_ of it.\r\n\r\nI was no sooner Possess't, of the _Reason_, and the _Expedience_ of\r\nthe _Thing_; but I fell presently to _Deliberate_ upon the\r\n_Invidious Difficulties_; The _Scandals_, _Reproches_, and a\r\nThousand Other _Mischiefs_, and _Inconveniencies_, that would\r\nprobably _Attend_ it. I laid them All _before_ me; And upon a _Full\r\nComputation_ of the _Matter, Pro_ and _Con_; I Resolv'd, at last, to\r\nPut _pen to paper_; not without some _Vanity_ perhaps, in\r\n_Affecting_ the _Honour_ of being _Revil'd_, by the _Blasphemers_ of\r\n_God_, and the _King_. I shall say Nothing of the _Traytors_; The\r\n_Papists_; The _Fidlers_; The _All-manner-of-Rogues_, and\r\n_Debauchees_ that they have _made_ me: For their _Cause_ is\r\n_Founded_ upon a _Sacrilegious Hypocrisy; Maintain'd_ by _Fraud_,\r\n_Scandal_, and _Imposture_. And when they have a mind to _Blacken_\r\na man, 'tis not a _Straw_ matter, for any _Foundation_ of _Fact_, or\r\n_History_: But _Paint_ him as like the _Devil_ as they _Can_; and to\r\nmake short Work on't, _One Fanatique_ Sits to _Another_, for the\r\n_Picture_. But _These Scurrilities_ have more of _Noise_ in 'em,\r\nthen of _Weight_: And Those People that had the face to _Calumniate\r\nCharles the First_, for a _TYRANT_, and a _PAPIST_; And the\r\n_Confidence_, at This very day, to do as much for _Charles the\r\nSecond_; They that _Preach REBELLION_ out of the _GOSPEL_; Give it\r\nthe _Name_ of _GOD'S TRUTH, GOD'S CAUSE_; And offer up the _Bloud_\r\nof _Kings_ as an _Acceptable Sacrifice_ to _Jesus Christ_: What\r\n_Christian_ will not _Value_ himself, upon the _Reputation_ of lying\r\nunder the _Scourge_ of _Those Tongues_, and _Pens_, that Offer these\r\n_Outrages_ to their _Maker_, and their _Saviour_? So that these\r\n_Clamours_, and _Maledictions_, I look upon, as Matter, rather of\r\n_Advantage_, then _Discredit_; Where _Loyalty_ to the _King_, and to\r\nthe _Church_, is made the _Crime_: But yet I must Confess, I had\r\n_Some Other Mortifications_ in my _Thought_, that went a little\r\n_Nearer_ me.\r\n\r\nAs first, the _Indecency_ of a _Gentlemans_ Entring into a\r\n_Street-Brawl_, (and _Bare-fac'd_ too) with the _Sink_ of _Mankind_,\r\nboth for _Quality_, and _Wickedness_. 21y. The _Disproportion_, and the\r\n_Indecorum_ of the Thing, for an _Old Fellow_ that now Writes _Sixty\r\nEight_, to run about, a _Masquerading_, and _Dialoguing_ of it, in\r\n_Twenty Fantastical Shapes_, only to furnish a _Popular Entertainment_,\r\nand _Diversion_. 31y. The _Scandalous Appearance_ of it, for Me to take\r\nup the _Profession_, and _Bus'ness_ of a _Pamphleteer_; And (almost) to\r\nLose the _Name_ of my _Family_, by it, in _Exchange_ for That of the\r\n_Observator_. 41y. I had This Prospect before me too. What\r\n_Construction_ would be made upon't; (If I may speak it with _Modesty_)\r\neven to the _Lessening_ of my _Character_; And Consequently, to my\r\nDetriment, Every way, as well in Respect of _Fortune_, as _Esteem_: For\r\nmen are apt, in such Cases as This, to _Mistake_, the _Intent_, as well\r\nas the _Reason_ of the _Office_; and to Impute the most _Sacred_, and\r\n_Consciencious Zeal_ of an _Upright Heart_, in the performance of the\r\nmost _Important_, and _Necessary Duty_, only to a _Levity_ of _Mind_,\r\nperchance; Or in Other Terms; to an Over _Officious_, and _Pragmatical\r\nItch of Medling_: It makes a man to be lookt upon, as if a _Pamphlet_\r\nwere his _Masterpiece_; and when he's once _Nail'd_ to _That Post_, he\r\nmay reckon upon't, that he's at the _Top_ of his _Preferment_. Upon\r\nThese _Four Difficulties_, I Reason'd with my self, after This Manner.\r\nTo the _First_; What do I care, for having so much _Dirt_ Thrown at me,\r\nthat will _Wash off_ again? And at the worst, the Engaging with such a\r\n_Rabble_ of _Contaminated Varlets_, is no more then _Leaping_ into the\r\n_Mud_ to help my _Father. Secondly. 'Tis not for a man in years_, to do\r\nso and so. Well! And here's a _Reputative Circumstance_, on the _One_\r\nhand, against an _Indispensable Duty_, on the _Other_. The _Common\r\npeople_ are _Poyson'd_, and will run _Stark Mad_, if they be not\r\n_Cur'd_: Offer them _Reason_, without _Fooling_, and it will never\r\n_Down_ with them: And give them _Fooling_, without _Argument_, they're\r\nnever the _Better_ for't. Let 'em _Alone_, and All's _Lost_. So that the\r\n_Mixture_ is become as _Necessary_, as the _Office_; And it has been _My\r\nPart_, only to _Season_ the _One_ with the _Other. Thirdly_, I must Set\r\nthe _Conscience_ of the Action, against the _Reproch_. And _Lastly; 'Tis\r\nnothing to me what Other People_ Think, _so long as I am Conscious to my\r\nSelf that I Do what I_ Ought.\r\n\r\nAll This I Computed upon, _before-hand_; And thus far, I have not been\r\n_Deceiv'd_ in my _Account_. I have been _Baited_ with _Thousands_ upon\r\n_Thousands_ of _Libells_. I have Created _Enemies_ that do me the\r\n_Honour_ to _Hate_ me, perhaps, next to the _King Himself_ (God Bless\r\nhim) and the _Royal Family_. Their _Scandals_ are _Blown over_: Their\r\n_Malice, Defeated_, And whenever _my Hour comes_, I am ready to Deliver\r\nup my _Soul_, with the _Conscience_ of an _Honest Man_, as to what I\r\nhave done, in _This Particular_: And I do here Declare, in the\r\n_Presence_ of an _All-Seeing_, and an _All-Knowing God_, That as I have\r\nnever yet receiv'd any _Answer_, more then _Cavil_, and _Shuffling_, to\r\nthe _Doctrine_, and _Reasoning_ of _These Papers_: So I never _made use_\r\nof Any _Sophism_, or _Double Meaning_, in Defence of the _Cause_ that I\r\nhave here taken upon me to _Assert_: But have dealt _Plainly_, and\r\n_Above-Bord_, without either _Fallacy_, or _Collusion_.\r\n\r\nAfter This _View_ of the _Worst side_ of my _Case_; (And (in truth) a\r\nkind of _Abstract_ of it, in _Minutes_) I should be Extremely wanting,\r\nboth to _God_ and _Man_, in not taking _This Occasion_, of making\r\n_known_ to the _world_, the _Many Generous Instances_ of _Affection_,\r\nand _Respect_, which I have received, not only from the most\r\n_Considerable_ Part of his Majesties _Loyal Subjects_ of _All\r\nQualities_, and _Degrees_; But _Particularly_ from the _Two Famous\r\nUniversities Themselves_: And, in short, from the most _Eminent Persons_\r\nof the _Long Robe_, in their _Several Professions_: In _Testimony_ of\r\ntheir _Favourable Acceptance_ of my _Honest Endeavours_ toward the\r\nService, both of the _Church_, & the _State_. And This I am Obliged to\r\nleave behind me, upon _Record_; out of a _Double Right_, & _Regard_, as\r\nwell to my _Friends_, as to my _Self_: For I reckon upon it, as an\r\n_Accumulation_ of _Honour_, to _Me_, to be _Rescu'd_ out of the hands of\r\n_Publique Enemies_, and _Apostates_, by Men of the Clear _Contrary\r\nCharacter_; That is to say; by Men of _Unquestionable Integrity_, and of\r\n_Unspotted Faith_.\r\n\r\nMy _Back Friends_ are as _Merry_, now, as _a Laugh on One side of the\r\nMouth_ can Make 'em; at the _Conceit_ of calling the several _Presents_\r\nwhich have been made me (and they are very _Considerable_) by the name\r\nof a _Gathering_; and they do not Stick to put it about, That I was my\r\n_Own Sollicitor_ for the _Begging_ of it. I have been Told of One, that\r\n_said_ as much; _for whose sake_, I would Advise _All Parents_ to take\r\nit for a _Warning_, not to _Stuff_ their _Childrens Heads_ so Damnably,\r\nwith _Greek and Latin_, as to leave no _Room_ for _Brains_, and _Good\r\nManners_. But what if it _be a Gathering_? Are not All _Publique\r\nBenevolences; Publique Works; Publique Acknowledgments_; the _same\r\nThing_? Neither do I find any more _Scandal_, in receiving a _Reward_\r\nfor a _Service_ in a _Common Cause_, then in a _Lawyers_ taking a _Fee_,\r\nin a _Private_ One: But be it what it _will_: I shall Transmit the\r\n_Acknowledgment_ of it, with This Paper, as the _Glory of my Life_: And\r\nValue my self Incomparably more upon so _Eminent_ a _Mark_ of a _General\r\nEsteem_; then upon the _Advantage_ of _Ten times a Greater Sum_, by _Any\r\nOther way_. But _Gatherings_, with some People, are only _Honourable_,\r\nwhen they are Apply'd to the _Maintaining_ of _Conspirators_, and\r\n_Affidavit-Men_: And they Account _Money_ much better _Bestow'd_ upon\r\nthe _Subversion_ of the _Government_, then toward the _Defending_ of it:\r\nBut _That Orange is Squeez'd as far as 'twill Drop, already_.\r\n\r\nNow to the _Calumny_ of _My Setting This Bus'ness afoot; First_, I thank\r\nGod, that neither my _Mind_, nor my _Condition_ were ever Sunk _so_ Low,\r\nyet, as to _Descend_ to _That way of Application_. 21y, As I hope to be\r\nSav'd, the Matter was Proceeded upon, in _Several Places_, and a _Long\r\nTime_, before ever I had the Least _Inkling_, or _Imagination_ of it;\r\nAnd when it was so far _Advanc'd, without my Privity_, I must Certainly\r\nhave been both a Great _Fool_, and a Great _Clown_, either to have\r\n_Oppos'd_, or _Refus'd_, a Token of so _Obliging_, and so _Generous_ a\r\n_Respect_. To Conclude; If any man has been so _Misled_, as to _Intend_\r\nThat for a _Personal Charity_; which I cannot _Honourably_ Own the\r\n_Receiving_ of, under _That Notion_; I am ready to Return him his\r\nProportion, with a Thousand Acknowledgments: But This shall not Hinder\r\nme yet, from _Cherishing_ in my _Thoughts_, the _Remembrance_ of what\r\n_Honour_ soever has been done me for the sake of the _Publique_.\r\n\r\nThe Reflexions that have been Pass'd upon my _Quality_, and\r\n_Conversation_, need no Further Answer, then to Appeal to my very\r\n_Name_, and my _Acquaintance_: But for the _Charge_ of being a _Papist_,\r\nit is as _False_, as it is _Malicious_.\r\n\r\nI am to say One Word more now, concerning my _L. Shaftsbury_; whose\r\n_Name_, and _Title_, I have often Occasion to make mention of, in This\r\nBook. The _Reader_ is to take Notice, that it is Intended of the _Late\r\nEarl of Shaftsbury_, who Dy'd at _Amsterdam, Jan. 168-2/3. The Surviving\r\nHeir of That Honour, and Family, having ever Demean'd himself with a\r\nRemarkable Loyalty, and Respect, toward the King, and his Government_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Numb. 1.=\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVATOR.\r\n\r\nIn _QUESTION_ and _ANSWER_.\r\n\r\n=WEDNESDAY=, April 13. 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Q. WEll! They are so. But do you think now to bring'um to their Wits\r\nagain with a_ Pamphlet?\r\n\r\n_A._ Come, Come; 'Tis the _Press_ that has made'um _Mad_, and the\r\n_Press_ must set'um _Right_ again. The Distemper is _Epidemical_; and\r\nthere's no way in the world, but by _Printing_, to convey the _Remedy_\r\nto the _Disease_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But what is it that you call a_ Remedy?\r\n\r\n_A._ The _Removing_ of the _Cause_. That is to say, the _Undeceiving_ of\r\nthe _People_: for they are well enough Disposed, of themselves, to be\r\nOrderly, and Obedient; if they were not misled by _Ill Principles_, and\r\nHair'd and Juggled out of their Senses with so many Frightful _Stories_\r\nand _Impostures_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Well! to be Plain and Short; You call your self the_ Observator:\r\n_What is it now that you intend for the Subject of your_ Observations?\r\n\r\n_A._ Take it in few words then. My business is, to encounter the\r\n_Faction_, and to Vindicate the _Government_; to detect their\r\n_Forgeries_; to lay open the Rankness of their _Calumnies_, and\r\n_Malice_; to Refute their _Seditious Doctrines_; to expose their\r\n_Hypocrisy_, and the _bloudy Design_ that is carry'd on, under the Name,\r\nand Semblance, of _Religion_; And, in short, to lift up the Cloke of the\r\n_True Protestant_ (as he Christens himself) and to shew the People, the\r\n_Jesuite_ that lies skulking under it.\r\n\r\n_Q. Shall the_ Observator _be a_ Weekly Paper, _or How_?\r\n\r\n_A._ No, No; but oftner, or seldomer, as I see Occasion.\r\n\r\n_Q. Pray favour me a word; When you speak of a_ True Protestant, _don't\r\nyou mean a_ Dissenting Protestant?\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes, I do: For your _Assenting_ and _Consenting Protestant_ (you\r\nmust know) is a _Christian_.\r\n\r\n_Q. And is not a_ Dissenting Protestant _a_ Christian too?\r\n\r\n_A._ Peradventure, he _is_ one; peradventure, _not_: For a _Dissenter_\r\nhas his Name from his _Disagreement_, not from his _Perswasion_.\r\n\r\n_Q. What is a Dissenter then?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Tis Impossible to say either what a _Dissenter IS_, or what he is\r\n_NOT_. For he's a _NOTHING_; that may yet come to be _ANY thing_. He may\r\nbe a _Christian_; or he may be a _Turk_; But you'l find the best account\r\nof him in his _Name_. _A DISSENTER, is one that thinks OTHERWISE._ That\r\nis to say, let the _Magistrate_ think what he pleases, the _Dissenter_\r\nwill be sure to be of _another Opinion_. A _Dissenter_ is not of _This_,\r\nor of _That_, or of _Any Religion_; but _A Member Politique of an\r\nIncorporate Faction_: or Otherwise; A _Protestant-Fault-Finder_ in a\r\n_Christian Commonwealth_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Well! but tho' a_ Dissenter _may be_ any thing; _A_ Dissenting\r\nProtestant _yet tells ye_ what _he Is_.\r\n\r\n_A._ He does so, he tells ye that he _is_ a _Negative_: an\r\n_Anti-Protester_; One that _Protests AGAINST_, but not _FOR_ any thing.\r\n\r\n_Q. Ay; but so long as he opposes the_ Corruptions _of the Church of_\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n_A._ Well: And so he does the _Rites_, and _Constitutions_ of the Church\r\nof _England_ too. As a _Protestant_, he does the _former_; and the\r\n_Other_ as a _Dissenter_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But is there no_ Uniting _of These_ Dissenters?\r\n\r\n_A._ You shall as soon make the Winds blow the same way, from all the\r\nPoynts of the Compass.\r\n\r\n_Q. There are_ Good _and_ Bad, _of_ all Opinions, _there's no doubt\r\non't: But do you think it fayr, to Condemn a_ whole Party _for some_ Ill\r\nmen _in't_?\r\n\r\n_A._ No, by no means: The _Party_ is neither the _Worse_, for having\r\n_Ill_ men in it, nor the _Better_, for _Good_. For whatever the\r\n_Members_ are, the _Party_ is a _Confederacy_; as being a _Combination_,\r\nagainst the _Law_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But a man may_ Mean honestly, _and yet perhaps ly under some_\r\nMistake. _Can any man help his Opinion?_\r\n\r\n_A._ A man may _Mean well_, and _Do Ill_; he may shed _Innocent Bloud_,\r\nand _think he does God good Service_. 'Tis True: A man cannot help\r\n_Thinking_; but he may help _Doing_: He is _Excusable_ for a _Private_\r\nMistake, for _That's_ an Error only to _himself_; but when it comes once\r\nto an _Overt Act_, 'tis an _Usurpation_ upon the _Magistrate_, and\r\nthere's no Plea for't.\r\n\r\n_Q. You have no kindnesse, I perceive, for a_ Dissenting Protestant;\r\n_but what do you think of a bare_ Protestant _without any_ Adjunct?\r\n\r\n_A._ I do look upon _Such_ a _Protestant_ to be a kind of an _Adjective\r\nNoun-Substantive; It requires something to be joyn'd with it, to shew\r\nits Signification_. By _Protestancy_ in _General_ is commonly understood\r\na _Separation_ of Christians from the Communion of the Church of _Rome_:\r\nBut to _Oppose Errors_, on the _One hand_, is not Sufficient, without\r\nkeeping our selves _Clear_ of Corruptions, on the _Other_. Now it was\r\nthe _Reformation_, not the _Protestation_, that Settled us upon a _true\r\nMedium_ betwixt the two _Extreams_.\r\n\r\n_Q. So that you look upon the_ Protestation, _and the_ Reformation, _it\r\nseems, as two several things_.\r\n\r\n_A._ Very right; But in such a manner only, that the _Former_, by Gods\r\nProvidence, made way for the _Other_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But are not all_ Protestants _Members of the_ Reformed Religion?\r\n\r\n_A._ Take notice, _First_, that the _Name_ came Originally from the\r\n_Protestation_ in 1529. against the _Decree of Spires_; and that the\r\n_Lutheran Protestants_ and _Ours_ of the Church of _England_, are not of\r\nthe _Sam Communion_. Now _Secondly_; If you take _Protestants_ in the\r\n_Latitude_ with our _Dissenters_, they are not so much a _Religion_,\r\nas a _Party_; and whoever takes this Body of _Dissenters_ for _Members_\r\nof the _Reformed Religion_ sets up a _Reformation_ of a _hundred and\r\nfifty Colours_ and as may [sic] _Heresies_. The _Anabaptists, Brownists,\r\nAntinomians, Familists, &c._ do all of them set up for _Dissenting\r\nProtestants_; but God forbid we should ever enter these _People_ upon\r\nthe Roll of the _Reformation_.\r\n\r\n_Q._ Well! _but what do you think of_ Protestant Smith _and_ Protestant\r\nHarris?\r\n\r\n_A._ Just as I do of _Protestant Muncer_, and _Protestant Phifer_; a\r\nBrace of _Protestants_ that cost the Empire 150000 Lives: and our own\r\n_Pretended Protestants_ too, of Later Date, have cost _This Nation\r\nlittle lesse_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Ay: But these are men of quite another Temper: Do not you see how\r\nzealous they are for the Preservation of the_ King's Person, _the_\r\nGovernment, _and the_ Protestant Religion?\r\n\r\n_A._ I _See_ well enough what they _Say_, and I _know_ what they _do_.\r\nConsider, _First_, that they are Profess'd _Anabaptists: Smith_ no less\r\nthen a _pretended Prophet_; and the _Other_, a kind of a _Wet\r\nEnthusiast. Secondly_; 'tis the very _Doctrine_ of the _Sect_ to root\r\nout _Magistracy_, Cancel _Humane Laws; Kill_, and take _Possession_; and\r\n_wash their Feet with the Bloud of the Ungodly_; and where ever they\r\nhave set Footing, they have _Practic'd_ what they _Taught_. Are not\r\nthese likely men now, to help out a _King_, and a _Religion_, at a dead\r\nlift? If you would be further satisfy'd in the Truth of things, reade\r\n_Sleidan, Spanhemius, Gastius, Hortensius, Bullinger, Pontanus, The\r\nDipper dipp'd, Bayly's Disswasive, Pagets Heresiography_, &c.\r\n_Hortensius_ tells ye, how _Jack of Leydens Successor_ murthered his\r\nWife, to make way to his Daughter, _P._ 74. and after that, cut a girls\r\nthroat, for fear she should tell Tales. _Gastius_ tells us of a Fellow\r\nthat cut off his brothers Head, as by Impulse, and then cry'd, _The Will\r\nof God is fulfilled, lib. I. Pa. 12. Jack of Leyden_ started up from\r\nSupper, _to do some business_ (he said) _which the Father had commanded\r\nhim_, and cut off a Soldiers Head; and afterwards cut off his Wives head\r\nin the _Market-place. Sleydans Comment. Lib. 10._\r\n\r\n_Q. You will not make the_ Protestant-Mercury _to be an_ Anabaptist\r\n_too, will ye_?\r\n\r\n_A._ If you do make him _any thing_, I'le make him _That_. But in one\r\nword, they are _Factious_ and _Necessitous_; and consequently, the\r\nfittest Instruments in the world, for the Promoting of a _Sedition_.\r\nFirst, as they are _Principled_ for't; and then, in respect of their\r\n_Condition_; for they are every man of them under the Lash of the Law,\r\nand Retainers to Prisons; So that in their _Fortunes_ they can hardly\r\nbe _worse_. Insomuch, that it is a common thing for them to lend a Name\r\nto the countenancing of a Libel which no body else dares own.\r\n\r\n_Q. Well! but let them be as_ poor, _and_ malicious _as_ Devils, _so\r\nlong as they have neither_ Brains, _nor_ Interest, _what hurt can their\r\nPapers do_?\r\n\r\n_A._ The Intelligences, you must know, that bear their _Names_, are not\r\nof _their Composing_, but the Dictates of a _Faction_, and the Venom of\r\na Club of _Common-wealths-men_ instill'd into those Papers.\r\n\r\n_Q. These are_ Words, _all this while, without_ Proofs; _Can you shew us\r\nparticularly where the Venom lies?_\r\n\r\n_A._ It is the business of every Sheet they Publish, to Affront the\r\n_Government_, the _Kings Authority_, and _Administration_; the\r\n_Privy-Council_; the _Church, Bench, Juries, Witnesses_; All _Officers,\r\nEcclesiastical, Military_, and _Civil_: and no matter for _Truth_ or\r\n_Honesty_, when a _Forg'd Relation_ will serve their turn. 'Tis a common\r\nthing with them, to get half a dozen _Schismaticall_ Hands to a\r\n_Petition_, or _Address_ in a corner, and then call it, the sense of the\r\nNation: and when all's done, they are not above twenty Persons, that\r\nmake all this Clutter in the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n_Q. But to what End do they all this?_\r\n\r\n_A._ To make the Government _Odious_, and _Contemptible_; to magnifie\r\ntheir own Party; and fright the People out of their _Allegeance_, by\r\n_Counterfeit Letters, Reports_, and _false Musters_, as if the sober and\r\nconsiderable part of the Nation were all on their side.\r\n\r\n_Q. We are in Common Charity to_ allow, _for_ Errors, _and_\r\nMis-reports, _and not presently to make an Act of_ Malice, _and_\r\nDesign, _out of every_ Mistake. _Can you shew me any of these_\r\nCounterfeits, _and_ Impostures _that you speak of? These_ Cheats _upon\r\nthe_ People, _and_ Affronts _upon the_ Government?\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes, yes; Abundantly. And Il'e give you Instances immediately upon\r\nevery poynt you'l ask me: Only This note, by the way; That let them be\r\n_mistakes_, or _Contrivances_, or what you will, they all run\r\nUnanimously _against_ the Government, without so much as one Syllable in\r\n_favour_ of it: Which makes the matter desperately suspitious.\r\n\r\n_Q. Let me see then, in the First place, where any_ Affront _is put upon\r\nthe_ Government.\r\n\r\n_A. Some Persons_ (Says Smiths Prot. Int. N. 7.) _in_ Norwich, _&c. who\r\nhave a greater stock of_ Confidence, _and_ Malice, _then_ Wisdom, _and_\r\nHonesty, _are so far transported with_ Zeal _to serve the_ Devil, _or\r\nhis_ Emissaryes _the_ Papists, _that they are now Prosecuting several_\r\nDissenting Protestants _upon_ Stat. 35. Eliz. _&c._ (And so the\r\nProtestant-Mercury, _N._ 15.) _Some People at_ Norwich, _are playing\r\nthe_ Devil _for_ Godsake: _several honest, peaceable_, Protestant\r\nDissenters, _having been troubled for not coming to_ Church, _or having\r\nbeen Present at_ Religious Meetings &c. Now what greater _Affront_ can\r\nthere be to _Government_, then This language, _First_, from an\r\n_Anabaptist_ that is a _Professed Enemy_ to _all Government_; and\r\n_Secondly_, from a _Private Person_, Bare-fac'd, to arraign a _Solemn\r\nLaw_: A _Law_ of this _Antiquity_; a _Law_ of _Queen Elizabeth's_, (a\r\nPrincesse so much Celebrated by our _Dissenters themselves_ for her\r\n_Piety, Good Government_, and _Moderation_;) a _Law_ which, upon\r\nExperience, has been found so _Necessary_, that the bare _Relaxing_ of\r\nit, cost the _Life_ of a _Prince_, the _Bloud_ of _two or three hundred\r\nthousand_ of his _Subjects_, and a _Twenty-years-Rebellion_? To say\r\nnothing of the dangerous Consequence of making it _Unsafe_ for\r\n_Magistrates_ to discharge their Dutyes, for fear of _Outrages_, and\r\n_Libells_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Well! but what have you to say now to the_ Kings Authority, _his_\r\nAdministration, _and his_ Privy Council.\r\n\r\n_A. Smith_ (in his _Vox Populi, P._ 13.) saith, that _the King is\r\noblig'd to pass or Confirm those Laws his People shall Chuse_, at which\r\nrate, if they shall tender him a Bill for the _Deposing_ of himself, he\r\nis bound to _agree_ to't. _Secondly_, in the same Page, _he Denies the\r\nKings Power of Proroguing, or Dissolving Parliaments_; which is an\r\n_Essential_ of _Government_ it self, under what Form soever, and he's no\r\nlonger a _King, without it_. And then for his _Administration, P._ 1.\r\nthe _Anabaptist_ charges upon his Majesty [_those many surprizing and\r\nastonishing Prorogations, and Dissolutions_ (as he has worded his\r\nMeaning) _to be procur'd by the Papists_.] And then, _P._ 15. he wounds\r\nboth the _King_, and his _Council_, at a Blow; in falling upon _those\r\nthat make the King break his Coronation-Oath_; arraigning his _Council_\r\nin the _First_ place, and the _King himself_ in the _Second_; and that\r\nfor no less then the breach of _Oath_, and _Faith_.----Wee'l talk out\r\nthe Rest at our next Meeting.\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _H. Brome_, at the Gun in S. _Pauls_ Church-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Numb.= 13.\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVATOR.\r\n\r\nIn _QUESTION_ and _ANSWER_.\r\n\r\n=SATURDAY=, May 14. 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Q_. _But which way lies_ your _Humour_ then?\r\n\r\n_A._ My way (you must know) lies more to _History_, and _Books_, and\r\n_Politicks_, and _Religion_, and _such as That_, But take this along\r\nwith you too; that I am for turning over of _Men_, as well as _Books_;\r\nfor that's the Profitable Study when all's done.\r\n\r\n_Q. Pre' thee commend me to the_ Common Hangman _then, If He that_ turns\r\nover _the most_ men _be the_ Greatest Philosopher. _But how_ turning\r\nover _of_ Men?\r\n\r\n_A._ That is to say, I _Read_ Them; I _Study_ them; I speak of _turning\r\nover_ their _Actions_, not their _Bodys_. And Pray observe my _Simile.\r\nEvery_ Action _of a mans_ Life _resembles_ a Page _in a_ Book. D'ye Mark\r\nme?\r\n\r\n_Q._ I _were to Blame else, But what are the Authors that you would\r\nrecommend to a bodys Reading?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Why thereafter as the Subject is, As for _History_; ye have _Clarks\r\nLives_, and _Examples_; _Lloyd's Memoirs_; the _Popes Warehouse_, &c.\r\nFor _Politicks_; There's Mr. _Baxters Holy Commonwealth_, the _Assemblys\r\nCatechism_, The Letter about the _Black Box_, &c. For _Law_, ye have Mr.\r\n_Prinn's Soveraign Power of Parliaments_; _Smiths Vox Populi_, &c. For\r\n_Morals_, There's _Youth's Behaviour_; And then For _Deep Knowledge_, ye\r\nhave _Brightman's Revelations Reveal'd_; _Lilly's Hieroglyphicks_; the\r\n_Northern Star_, _Jones_ of the _Heart_: All Excellent Pieces in their\r\nkinds, and not Inferior (perhaps) to any of the Ancients.\r\n\r\n_Q. I was never so happy as to meet with any of these Authors. But what\r\nd'ye think of_ Cornelius Tacitus?\r\n\r\n_A._ A _Talking, Tedious, Empty Fellow_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Well but is not_ Titus Livius _a pretty Good_ Historian?\r\n\r\n_A._ Ha Ha Ha. That Same _Titus_ is an Errant _Puppy_, A _Damn'd,\r\nInsipid, Lying Coxcomb. Titus Livius_ a good _Historian_ sayst thou? Why\r\nif I had a _Schoolboy_ that writ such _Latin_ I'de tickle his _Toby_ for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_Q. But what's your Opinion of_ Caesars Commentaries _then? I mean, for\r\na_ Narrative?\r\n\r\n_A._ A _Narrative_ d'ye say? Deliver me from such _Narratives_! Why 'tis\r\nno more to be compar'd to the _Narratives_ that are written _now adays_,\r\nthen an _Apple_ is to an _Oyster_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But however He was a very_ Brave Fellow, _was he not_?\r\n\r\n_A._ He was an _Arbitrary_, Oppressing, Tyrannical _Fellow_. And then\r\nfor his _Bravery_, he did pretty well at the Battel of _Leipsick_, and\r\nafter that, at _Lepanto_; and when you have said that, you have said\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_Q. You have read all these Authors, have you not?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Why verily I _have_, and I have _not_. They are a company of\r\n_Lying, Ridiculing Rascals_; They do not _AFFECT_ me at all: they are\r\nbelow me, they are not worth my notice.\r\n\r\n_Q. What would I give to be as well vers'd in_ History, _as you are_?\r\n\r\n_A._ And that's Impossible, let me tell ye; Utterly Impossible: For I\r\nreade just six times as much as any other Man. I have Read more\r\n_Folio's_ then ever _Tostatus_ read _Pages_. In one Word; I reade as\r\nmuch in _one hour_, as any other man reads in _six_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why how can that be?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Why you must know I have a notable Faculty that way. I read ye _two\r\nPages_ at a _view_: the _Right-hand_ Page with _one eye_, and the _Left_\r\nwith _t'other_, and then I carry _three Lines_ before me at a time with\r\n_each eye_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But can ye_ Keep _what ye_ Reade, _at this rate_?\r\n\r\n_A._ I _remember_ six times more then I _reade_; for I supply all that\r\nwas left out, and yet 'tis a wonderfull thing, I cannot for my heart's\r\nblood remember _Faces_. I dare swear I have taken one man for another\r\ntwenty times; but I am altogether for _Things_, and _Notions_, d'ye see,\r\nand such like; _Countenances_, let me tell ye, don't _AFFECT_ me; And\r\nyet I have a strange aversion for the two Faces I saw with you t'other\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_Q. What D'ye mean_, Kings-man _and_ Church-man?\r\n\r\n_A. Devil's-man_ and _Damms-man_: A couple of _Canary-Birds_, I'le\r\nwarrant 'em: But _Kings-man_ is better yet then _Duke's-man_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why do ye talk thus of men of Quality, and Considerable Families?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Well! but I may live to see their Honours laid in the dust tho' for\r\nall that. Prethee why is not _Circingle-man, Lawn-sleeve-man,\r\nMitre-man_, as good a name as _Church-man_? Pray what Family is this\r\nsame _Church-man_ of, for I know a world of the _Name_? He's of the\r\n_Prelatical House_, I suppose, Is he not?\r\n\r\n_Q. Well, and is he ever the worse for that?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Only _Antichrist_ is the _Head_ of the _Family_. Come let me talk a\r\nlittle roundly to ye. How many sound _Protestant Divines_ may there be\r\nof that House now, d'ye think, in _England_, and _Wales_, and the Town\r\nof _Berwick upon Tweed_? not above _Six_, if I be a _Christian_, and all\r\nthe rest are _Tantivy's_, and worshippers of the Beast: But I may live\r\nyet to have the scowring of some of their Frocks for 'em.\r\n\r\n_Q. Prethee when didst thou see Mr._ Sancroft?\r\n\r\n_A._ Not a good while; but _Harry_ and I had a Crash t'other day yonder\r\nat _Greenwich_.\r\n\r\n_Q. What's become of_ L'Estrange _I wonder?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Who! _Towzer?_ that _Impudent Dog_; That _Tory-Rascal_; That\r\n_Fidling Curr_. He's in the Plot with _Celiers_, and young _Tong_, as\r\nsure as thou'rt alive, and as Rank a _Papist_ (let him swear what he\r\nwill) as ever Piss't.\r\n\r\n_Q. But has he not taken the_ Sacrament _to the_ contrary?\r\n\r\n_A._ A _Popish Proselyte_ is no more to be believ'd, upon his _Oath_,\r\nthan the _Devil himself_ if he were to Expound upon the _Gospel_. Why\r\nthey have Dispensations to swear any thing.\r\n\r\n_Q. What and continue Papists still?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes: And go on still with the Hellish Popish Plot, as heartily as\r\never they did before. Why don't you see how the Toad Brazens it out\r\nstill that he was not at _Somerset-House_? tho' _Prance_ and _Mowbray_\r\nswear they saw him there?\r\n\r\n_Q. Well, But who knows best? He_ Himself, _or the_ Witnesses?\r\n\r\n_A._ Not a fart matter; For whether 'twas so or not; It were better\r\nForty such Rogues were Hang'd then one Kings-Evidence Disparag'd.\r\n\r\n_Q. But did they not swear a little short, think ye?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Nay, they might have sworn _homer_, I must confess.\r\n\r\n_Q. But now you mind me of_ Somerset-House; _Do'nt you remember a young\r\nFellow of_ Cambridge _that Refus'd to receive the Sacrament, because (as\r\nhe told his Master) he was reconcil'd to the Church, of_ Rome, _and\r\nConverted, and Baptiz'd at_ Somerset-House? _This is an old story ye\r\nmust know. Why might not this be_ Towzer?\r\n\r\n_A._ Nay as like as not, for the _Universitys_ are the very _Seminarys_\r\nof _Popery_, and it will never be well with _England_ till _those\r\nCalves_ be turn'd a _grazing_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But is there no believing of a_ Converted Papist _upon his_ Oath?\r\n_Why does the Law receive 'em then (upon such and such Certain Tests)\r\nfor_ statutable Protestants?\r\n\r\n_A._ The _Law_ never was among 'em as _I_ have been. There's no such\r\nthing (I tell ye) as a _Converted Papist_, and he shall sooner change\r\nhis _shape_, then his _Nature: Kiss a Book, Kiss mine Arse_.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why d'ye talk thus at random?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Come, come, the _Outlandish Doctor_ for my mony: that told one of\r\nthe _Macks_ t'other day in the face of the _Bench_, that _he would let\r\ndown his Breeches and shite upon him. Plain-dealing's a Jewell._\r\n\r\n_Q. Thou'rt e'en as busy with a_ Backside _as a_ Glyster-Pipe. _But\r\n(sluttery a part) Pray have a care what ye say; for if a_ Proselyted\r\nPapist _be not to be trusted upon his_ Oath, _what becomes of the_ Kings\r\nEvidence _that_ swear _under the_ same Circumstances? _But here's enough\r\nof this; and Pre'thee tell us now, how go squares in the_ State _all\r\nthis while_?\r\n\r\n_A._ Oh very bad, very bad, nothing but _Tory-Rorys_, from top to\r\nbottom. _Tory-Judges; Tory-Jurys; Tory-Justices; Tory-Officers;\r\nTory-Crackfarts; Tory-Pamphlets_. All, _Certiorari-men_, and _Yorkists_.\r\nBut I rattled up some of 'em there at the----_What d'ye\r\ncall't-House_----Oh they'r grown strangely Insolent since these Bawling\r\nAddresses.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why what do they do?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Why they set every _Rascally Squire_ and _Doctor above_ me: Nay,\r\nthey'l scarce put off their hats to me unless I begin; and then they\r\nstand grinning at Me and my Train. Would you think now that a fellow\r\nshould have the Impudence to call Me to an account, for nothing in the\r\nworld, but saying, that _he had_ a Bitch _to his_ Wife, _and_ she _a_\r\nRogue _to her_ Husband. And then to be call'd _Sirrah_ for my pains,\r\nonly for telling a _Court-Kinsman_ of his that _I should Lace the Rogue,\r\nhis Cozens Coat for him_. Well If I had not sent a Fool o'my errant I\r\nhad had the Rascal in _Lob's_ Pound before this time.\r\n\r\n_Q. And how came ye to miss?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Why the Agent that I employ'd was so set upon his Guts, that he\r\nnever minded the discourse at the Table. We had had him else. Or if he\r\ncould but have got him to ha' met me, we'd ha' done his business.\r\n\r\n_Q. But d'ye take this to be fair dealing now; to set any man at work to\r\nbetray his Host; or to give such language to people of Condition?_\r\n\r\n_A._ What not when the _Protestant Religion_ lies at _stake_? Why\r\nPre'thee I tell the Proudest of 'em all to their Teeth, that they are\r\n_Villains_ and _Scoundrells_. What do I care for their _Graces_ and\r\n_Reverences_, they _Pimp_ for _Preferment_, and some of 'em shall hear\r\non't too _next Parliament_. But Hark ye I have a great deal of work upon\r\nmy hands, and I want an _Ammanuensis_ out of all Cry.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why ye had a Pretty Fellow to'ther day, what's become of him?_\r\n\r\n_A._ I'l tell ye then. A _Taylor_ had made him a _Garment_: and\r\nafterwards coming to him for the _mony_, he deny'd the Receit on't and\r\nbeing prest upon it, he offer'd to purge himself upon _Oath_, that he\r\nnever had any such Garment. Upon this, the matter rested for a while;\r\nbut at length, it was prov'd where he had _Sold_ it, and so the Taylor\r\nhad satisfaction. In short, I turn'd him away apon't, for he is no\r\nservant for me that's _taken_ in a false Oath.\r\n\r\n_Q. How is it possible for you to go thorough with all your\r\nWriting-work?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Nay that's true; considering what a deal of other business I have;\r\nfor really there would be no Justice done, if I did not look after\r\n_Witnesses_, _Jurys_, Choice of _City-Officers_, Election of _Members_\r\nto serve in _Parliament_, both for _Town_, and _Country_; the disposing\r\nof _Ecclesiastical Dignitys_; the _Jurisdiction_ of _Courts_; the\r\n_Government_ of _Prisons_; the _Regulation_ of _Messengers Fees_: In one\r\nword, the stress of the whole Government lyes in a manner upon my\r\nshoulders; And I am so _Harrass'd_ with it, that I profess I was e'en\r\nthinking, a little before the Meeting of the last Parliament, to lay out\r\na matter of _Twenty or Thirty Thousand Pound_ upon some Pretty Seat in\r\nthe Country, and Retire.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why truly for a man that has seen the world as you have done, what\r\ncan he do better?_\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes, I have seen the world to my Cost. 'Twas a sad thing for me,\r\nyou must think, that never went to bed in my Mothers House without four\r\nor five Servants to wait upon me, (and if I had a mind to a _Tart_, a\r\n_Custard_, or a _Cheescake_ at any time, I had 'em all at command:) to\r\nbe _Hackny'd_, and _Jolted_ up and down in a Forreign Country like a\r\n_Common Body_.\r\n\r\n_Q. But what was it that put you upon_ Travel?\r\n\r\n_A._ The Desire I had to see _Religions_, and _Fashions_: And now it\r\ncomes in my head. Did you ever see my _Grounds and Occasions of the\r\nContempt of the Clergy_?\r\n\r\n_Q. Was That Yours then?_\r\n\r\n_A. Mum_; betwixt friends. But I shall have a touch ere long at the\r\n_Creed-making Rascal_ there.\r\n\r\n_Q. Who's that?_ Athanasius?\r\n\r\n_A._ The very same. What a _Declaration_ is there?\r\n\r\n_Q. But how d'ye like the Kings Declaration?_\r\n\r\n_A. Not at all. Not at all._ It runs so much upon the _Arbitrary_, and\r\nthe _Prelatick_? Yes, and upon something else too.\r\n\r\n_Q. Come, 'Faith we should not part with dry lips, What d'ye think of\r\none_ Roomer _now to the Health of? (Hark, and I'le tell ye.)_\r\n\r\n_A._ I'le drink no _Traitors_ Health.\r\n\r\n_Q. Why prethee what is_ Civilly-Drinking _his Health, more then_\r\nDutifully Praying _for't_?\r\n\r\n_A._ No: I am of the mans mind that said, I _hope the Devil will have\r\nhim; and if there be any punishment in Hell greater then another_, I\r\n_hope the Devil will tear his soul to pieces_. So Farewell.\r\n\r\n_Q. What a Blessed sort of_ Subjects _and_ Christians _are these, that\r\nvalue themselves in the_ One Capacity, _for their_ Contempt _of_\r\nAuthority: _And in the_ other, _for the Zeal of Flying out into_\r\nBlasphemys, _and_ Execrations, _instead of_ Prayers? _But what shall_ I\r\n_call this at last? A_ Romantique, _or an_ Historical Observator?\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _Johanna Brome_, at the Gun in S. _Pauls_\r\nChurch-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Numb.= 110\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVATOR.\r\n\r\nIn _DIALOGUE_.\r\n\r\n=SATURDAY=, March 11. 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\n_WHIG._ Come; I'le shew ye my _study, Tory_.\r\n\r\n_TORY._ Why you have got a Brave _Library_ here.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ For a _Choice Collection_, let me tell ye, as any is in\r\n_Christendom_.\r\n\r\n_To._ You have all the _Greek_ and _Latin Fathers_, I suppose; the\r\n_Councells_, the _Schoolmen_, and those People.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ I had'em all; but there's a great deal of _Trash_; and so I e'en\r\nrid my hands of'em; though some of'em did pretty well too; considering\r\nthose _Dark Times_. Now here can I sit as _Snug_ as a _Hare_ in her\r\n_Form_, and Chat away a Winters Evening with a _Good Fire_, a _Pipe_,\r\nand a _Friend_, and never feel how the time spends.\r\n\r\n_To._ Well! And why should not You and I keep our _Conferences_ here\r\ntoo?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Best of all: There's no body within hearing; and then we have our\r\n_Books_ and _Papers_ about us, and all in such Order, that I'le lay my\r\nFinger, Blindfold, upon any book you'le call for.\r\n\r\n_To._ But what Subject are they mostly of?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Matters of _State, History, Travells_, The Rights and Power of the\r\n_People, Reformation, Religion, Discipline, Admonitions, Remonstrances,\r\nPetitions, Appeals_; as ye see'em mark'd upon the Shelves. But all this\r\nis nothing, you'l say, when y'ave seen my _Gallery_. Open that same Door\r\nbefore ye.\r\n\r\n_To._ Bless me! What a Treasure's here?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Look ye now. That side is all _News-Books,_ and _Political\r\nDivinity_.\r\n\r\n_To._ You mean _Polemical_ Divinity I suppose.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Ay Ay; 'Tis all one for that. Now all to'ther side is _Dissenting\r\nProtestants_; as _Cartwright, Brown, Barrow, Robinson_, _Hetherington,\r\nTrask, Naylor, Best, Biddle, Muggleton_. And here are your _Muncerians,\r\nApostoliques, Separatists, Catharists, Enthusiasts, Adamits, Huttites,\r\nAugustinians, Libertines, Georgites, Familists, Ranters Seekers,\r\nSweet-Singers, Antinomians, Arrians, Socinians, Millenaryes, Quakers_:\r\nAnd in Two words; all the _Godly Party_. They make Fourteen Folio's of\r\nCatalogue.\r\n\r\n_To._ But ha'ye no _Manuscripts_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Yes I have Three cases there beyond the Chimny, that I wou'd not\r\nchange for _Bodlies Library_ three times over.\r\n\r\n_To._ What do they treat of?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Two of 'em are altogether upon the _Art of Government_, and the\r\n_Third_ is Cramm'd with _Lampoon_ and _Satyr_. You sha'not name me any\r\none Copy that has scap'd me; nor any Exigent of State; but I'le furnish\r\nye out of these Papers with an Expedient for't.\r\n\r\n_To._ And wherein does this _Art of Government_ Consist?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ In _Foresight, Experience, Presence of Thought, Prudence of\r\nDirection_, and _Vigour of Execution_. To be short; Every Motion of the\r\n_Head_, the _Eye_, the _Hand_, the _Foot_, the _Body_. Contributes a\r\npart to this Great Work.\r\n\r\n_To._ Is it a Science that may be Convey'd by _Instruction_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ With as much Ease as _Fencing_, or _Dancing_. There are Three or\r\nFour _Dissenting Academies_ here about the Town, where People are taught\r\nto _Nod, Wink, Gape, Cough, Spit_; Nay the very _Tuning_ of their\r\n_Hum's_ and _Haw's_, by _Rule and Method_; when to _Smite the Breast_,\r\nand when to _Dust the Cushion_; when to _Leap_ in the _Pulpit_, and when\r\nto _Swim_; when to be _Serene_, and when to _Thunder_: Nay the _Faces_\r\nthey are to make at every _Period_; and the very _Measure_ of their\r\n_pauses_; that the _Parenthesis_ may be large enough for the _Groans_, &\r\n_Ejaculations_ of the _Secret ones_ to _Play_ in; they are taught to\r\nPray for the _King_ with _One Tone_ and _Countenance_, and for the\r\n_Parliament_ with _another_.\r\n\r\n_To._ I have Observ'd them indeed to Cry with a Loud Voice, _Lord!\r\nstrengthen the Hands of the One_, & then to drop the Note into a kinde\r\nof a Piping whisper, with a _Lord! Turn the Heart of the Other_; which\r\nis as much as to say, _Alas! the Poor Gentleman is out of his way, and\r\nwe must set all hands at work to bring him to comply with his_\r\nParliament, _though that_ Handy work, _at last, bring his_ Royall Head\r\n_to the_ Scaffold.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ If you wou'd not be a _Rogue_ now and tell tales, I could let ye\r\nin to the whole _Popular Mystery_; and shew ye the _Folly_, and the\r\n_Vanity_ of any other Claim to _Sovereign Power_. And then _I_ have all\r\nthe _Prints_ brought me as soon as ever they come out.\r\n\r\n_To._ Pre'thee let's fall to work then.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Come, I'le give you a sight of one of my _Boxes_ first; but I must\r\nbe gone in a quarter of an hour upon absolute Necessity.\r\n\r\n_To._ Well! And whether in such hast?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ There's One at _Newington_ has promis'd me an _Answer_ to the\r\n_Dissenters Sayings_; and then I am told of a _Godly Divine_ at\r\n_Clapham_, that has a _Reply_ ready to the _Notes upon College_.\r\n\r\n_To._ Let's make the best of our time then. Stay a little; what have we\r\nhere?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Every thing is _Titled_, ye see, ready to your hand; so that you\r\nmay Pick and Chuse.\r\n\r\n_To._ Let me see then. _Pious Frauds; Mentall Reservations;\r\nInfallibility of the Assembly; Baxters Saints; Cases of Conscience;\r\nDispensations, Contributions, Maxims, Intelligence, Orders, Committees,\r\nJuryes, Caballs, Religion, Property, Demands, Proposals, Grievances,\r\nPretences, Salvo's, Distinctions, Explanations, Projects, Directions,\r\nAdvices, Resolutions, Invectives, Fictions, Forms of Reproaches_, suited\r\nto _All Persons, Orders_, and _Qualities; True-Protestant Privileges_;\r\nThe _Doctrine_ of _Probabilityes_, and _Implicit Obedience_.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Now upon all these Heads, ye have _Authoritys, Precedents_; and\r\nall the _Colours, Arguments_, and _Elucidations_ that the matter will\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n_To._ But your _Pious Frauds, Mentall Reservations, Infallibility,\r\nDispensations, Salvo's, Distinctions, Probabilityes, Implicit Faith_;\r\nThese are all _Popish Points_.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ They are so, when they are apply'd to the service of the\r\nChurch of _Rome_: but the _True Protestant-Cause Sanctifies_ the\r\n_Principle_. As there's a great difference betwixt the _Popes\r\nExcommunicating_ of an _Hereticall Prince_; and the _Generall\r\nAssemblys Excommunicating_ of an _Antichristian, Episcopall Prince_;\r\nbetwixt a _Popish Gunpowder-Treason_, in the _Cellers, under_ the\r\n_Parliament-House_; and a _Gunpowder Commission_ to _Kill_ and\r\n_Slay_ within the _walls_ of the _Same House, above ground_; though\r\nto Carnal Eyes they may both appear to _Center_ in the same _Point_:\r\nAnd so in like manner, betwixt a _Conspiracy_ of _Papists_ to _cut\r\noff the King_, and _Subvert the Government_; and a\r\n_True-Protestant-Association_, to the very _same Effect_: Nay with\r\nthis Advantage too; that the Latter Propounds the Accomplishing of\r\nthat, in a matter of a _month_ or _six weeks_, which the Zeal of\r\ntheir Fore-fathers was at least _Ten_, or a _dozen years a doing_.\r\n\r\n_To._ 'Tis a Great Ease for a man to have all these Subjects\r\n_Common-Plac'd_ to his hand.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Right. And where you may turn to any thing you have a mind to see,\r\nwith a _wet Finger_.\r\n\r\n_To._ But Pray'e How do you approve (in many of our _Seisures_) of the\r\n_Application_ of _Popish Trinkets_ to _Prophane Uses_, which were by\r\nthem Dedicated to the service of a _Superstitious Religion_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ You cannot Imagine, though an _Embroder'd Cope_ may be an\r\n_Abomination_, what a _Cordial the Pearl_ of it is to a _True-Protestant\r\nProfessor. Lambs-Wool_ drinks no way better then out of a _Chalice_. Or\r\nin other Cases; 'Tis but Destroying the _Popish Form_ of an _Idolatrous\r\nVessell_, and the _Intrinsick Value_ is never the less _Current_\r\naccording to the _Standard_ of the _Reformation_. The _Picture_ of the\r\n_Blessed Virgin_, with our _Saviour_ in her Arms, is never a jot the\r\nworse for _sale_ to a _Painter_, for being an object of _Idolatry_ about\r\nthe _Altar_.\r\n\r\n_To._ And yet I have seen it Committed to the _Flames_, but it has been\r\nan Oversight, betwixt the _Zeal_ and the _Ignorance_ of the\r\n_Magistrate_. How many _Curious Crucifixes_, and _Reliques_, with\r\n_Delicate Inlayings_, and _Carvings_ have I seen Expos'd at _Gill_ the\r\n_Constables_ in _Westminster_; truly, at very _Reasonable Rates_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Not unlikely; but then ye must know, they were _Seiz'd_ in _One\r\nCapacity_, and _sold_ in _Another_; for they were _vended_ in the\r\nContemplation of the _Workmanship_, though they were _taken_ as the\r\n_Fooleries_ of a _False Religion_. We have in our days seen the\r\n_Representation_ of the _Trinity_, Demolish'd in a _Church-Window_, with\r\nExtraordinary _Zeal_ and _Approbation_.\r\n\r\n_To._ Why truly I am as much against the making of any _Image_ or\r\n_Figure_ of _God the Father_ under the _Form_ of a _Man_, as any body;\r\nfor _Twenty Mistakes_ and _Inconveniencies_ that may arise upon the\r\nConsideration of such an _Object_; but I know no hurt in the world in\r\nthe Representing of our _Saviour_ under a _Human shape_; or of the _Holy\r\nGhost_ under the shadow of a _Dove_: beside that the thing is presum'd\r\nto have been done by _Authority_; for otherwise, the same _Zeal_ that\r\nDestroys but the _Window_ of the _Church_, would not stick at the\r\nDestroying perhaps of every thing else that belongs to't. But prethee\r\ntell me One thing, suppose the _Blessed Trinity_, so Represented, should\r\nbe the _Seal_ of an _Ancient_ Community, or _Society_ of men, what's the\r\ndifference betwixt that _Figure_, in _Graving_, or in _Nealing_; in\r\n_Silver_, or in _Glass_? Would not you as much _scruple_ the putting of\r\nthat _Seal_ to a _Lease_, as the _seeing_ of that _Figure_ in a\r\n_Church-Window_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ No; by no means; for the _One_ is Purely a _Civil Act_; and the\r\n_Other_ has a Regard to _Religious Worship_.\r\n\r\n_To._ And yet this _Image_, or _Pretended Resemblance_, is the _same\r\nthing_ in the _One_, as it is in the _Other_. Well! I am Extremly\r\npleas'd with this Private Corner for Liberty of Discourse.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Here you may have all the _Papers_ as they come out, _Fresh and\r\nFresh_: All the _Arguments_, and _Politiques_ of the _Dissenting Party_;\r\nChuse _your own Theme_, Take _your own Time_, and Treat upon _your own\r\nConditions_.\r\n\r\n_To._ That's as fair as any Mortall can wish; So that when the day does\r\nnot afford other matter to work upon, we may Look a little more narrowly\r\ninto the _Merits_ of the _Cause_. And so much for that. But here let me\r\nask ye a Question: Do you know a _Little Cause-Jobber_ yonder somewhere\r\nabout _Kings-street, in Covent Garden_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Does he not use the _Christian Coffee-House_?\r\n\r\n_To._ The very same. He was saying t'other day that _L'Estrange_ was a\r\n_Pensioner of Cromwels_; a _Papist_; and that he durst not bring his\r\n_Action_ against any man for _Calling_ him so: That he was a _Rogue_; a\r\n_Fidler_; Liv'd in _Covent-Garden_ a good while, and got his _Living_ by\r\nhis _Trade_; And that a _Magistrate_, not far from that place, would\r\n_Justify_ it. The Two first Points, I suppose, will be Disputed in\r\nanother place: And for the _Fidler_: 'Tis well known that _L'Estrange_\r\nliv'd Eight or Nine years in one of the _Piazza-Houses_ there; and kept\r\n_Servants_ that would have Scorn'd to have Sorted themselves with any\r\nthing so mean as this _Paltry Varlet_. But to the Business. How far will\r\nthe _Privilege_ of a _True-Protestant-Whig_ Justify a _Villain_ in so\r\nmany _Scandalous Lyes_?\r\n\r\n_Wh._ So far as the _Common Good_ of the _Cause_ is more Valuable then\r\nthe _single Credit_ of a _Private Person_. But what say ye now to\r\n_Curtis's Advertisement_ (in his Last _Mercury_) of _Tong's Narrative_,\r\nand _Case_; concerning _L'Estrange_, Printed for C W?\r\n\r\n_To._ I say, 'tis _first_, a _Cheat_; for 'tis none of _Tong's Writing_;\r\n_2ly_, 'Tis _Another Cheat_; for 'twas Printed for _Langley Curtis_,\r\nwith his Name to _Tongs Appointment_ for the Printing of it: Only he has\r\nFobb'd a _New_, and a _False Title-Page_ to't. But what says Mr.\r\n_Oates_, all this while, to _L'Estranges Enformation_ against _Tonge_,\r\nin the _Shammer Shamm'd_? where that young Fellow has the Impudence to\r\ndeclare under his hand, the very _Foundation_ of _Oates's_ Plot to be a\r\n_Cheat_: And _I appeal to all Good Protestants for Justice upon that\r\nScandalous Wretch_.\r\n\r\n_Wh._ Nay, 'tis a horrible Abuse, and really the man stands in's own\r\nlight: What was't? 500 or a 1000 Pound that he recover'd of One that did\r\nnot say the Hundredth part of what this comes to? The Lord Deliver me! I\r\nknew the Time when 'twas _half a Hanging-matter_ to have made the least\r\ndoubt of any Branch of the Hellish Plot: But for this Audacious Fool to\r\nsay in Expresse Terms, that [_the_ Four Jesuites Letters, _wherein_\r\nOates _pretended was the whole Discovery, were_ Counterfeits] is utterly\r\nIntolerable. I'le e'en go my ways immediately, and talk with the Doctor\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _Joanna Brome_, at the Gun in S. _Pauls_\r\nChurch-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vol. 3.                                 =Numb. 88=\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVATOR,\r\n\r\n_A_ Schism _a Greater Judgment then a_ Pestilence. _The_ Natural\r\nRhetorique _of the_ Non-Cons. _The_ Danger _of them.

Or what needs this _Lashing_, when\r\nthey are All Tongue-Ty'd; and Driven into _Holes_, and _Hiding-Places_,\r\nto keep out of the way of _Messengers_, and _Constables_, and out of the\r\n_Clutches_ of the _Corporation-Act_, and _Other Penal Laws_ against\r\ntheir _Private Meetings_?\r\n\r\n_Obs._ What dost thou Talk of Tongue-Ty'd? Why I will undertake it; (and\r\nin _Serious Good Earnest_ too) _Gagg_ the Whole Set of'em; Give Every\r\nman his _Pulpit_, or his _Chair_, and only a Bare Standing in't; and if\r\nthey do not _Wink_, and _Nod_, and _Cuff_ any Prince in _Christendom_\r\nout of his _Dominions_, without a _Word Speaking_, I'le be thy\r\n_Bond-slave_. Why they do not do their Bus'ness, man, by the Force of\r\n_Logique, Grammar_, or by the _Dint_ of _Theology_: But by _Groans,\r\nPangs, Tragical Ululations, Silent Interjections, Whining Apostrophes,\r\nMelting Epiphonemas_; and in a word; by the Helps of _Natural\r\nRhetorick_, without _Need_, of either _Sense_, or _Syllables_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ They _Preach_, and _Pray_, without _Speaking_ then.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ No No. They do Talk for _Fashion_-sake: But Observe it while you\r\nwill; They move the _Passions_ of their _Auditory_, in the _Belfry_, or\r\nthe _Church-Porch, Forty times more_ then Directly under the _Pulpit_:\r\nFor the _Emphasis_ of an _Action_; a _Motion, Tone_, or _Countenance_,\r\nmakes a much Deeper _Impression_, than that of a _Naked, Empty, Sound_:\r\nAnd for _My Part_, I fancy, it might do as well for 'em to Whistle their\r\n_Preachments_ as to Articulate them: For the _Masterpiece_, or the All\r\nin All of it, lies Mainly, in _Hitting_ the _Tune_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ D'ye call this Reasoning, or Ridiculing?\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 'Tis _Both_ in _One_: For it is the _Ridiculous Truth_, and the\r\n_Just Reason, Method_, and _State_ of the _Matter_: And when People are\r\nonce _Juggled_ Out _of their Wits_, they must be _Fool'd_ Into _'em\r\nagain_. Now there needs no more to the doing of _That Work_, then the\r\nbare _Drawing_ of the _Curtain_, and letting People into the\r\n_Tyring-Room_. For the _Cause_, is all over, _Theatrical_: The _Actors_\r\nare _Hypocrites_, in their _Manners_, as well as in the _Etymon_; and\r\nthe whole _Manage_, fitter for a _Stage_, then a _Pulpit_. So that the\r\nmost _Certain Way_ in _Nature_, for the making of the _Practice,\r\nOdious_; and the _Disabusing_ of the _Undiscerning Multitude_, is to\r\n_lay Open_ their _False Colours, Shapes_, & _Disguises_; and _Expose_\r\nEvery thing in its _Naked Simplicity_ to the _Light_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ And what if a man should Allow This sort of People now, to be\r\nthe most _Uncouth, Hideous Monsters_ of the _Creation_? To have the\r\n_Teeth_, the _Nails_, the _Fierceness_, the _Strength_, & the _Appetite_\r\nof the most _Ravenous_ of _Wild Beasts_? This Discourse, of _Caution_,\r\nand _Description_, might do well enough in the _Countrys_ of _Lyons_,\r\nand _Tygers_: But what's All This, to _his Majesties Dominions_, where\r\nthere are either _None_ of These Creatures, _at all_, or No _Other_, at\r\nleast, then such as have their _Nails Par'd_, and their _Chops Muzzled_:\r\nAnd no more _Danger_ of them, at present, then of our _Beeves_, and\r\n_Muttons_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ Dost not thou know that there are _Several_ Sorts, & Degrees of\r\n_Danger_? A man may be Wheedled into a _Precipice_, as well as Thrown\r\ninto't: A man may be Hugg'd or Suck'd to _Death_, without any Biting, or\r\nScratching in the Case: A man may be Poyson'd in his _Porridge_, as well\r\nas Strangl'd in his _Bed_: A man may have False Opinions _Impos'd_ upon\r\nhim by a _Fallacy_, or _Fraud_ in _Argument_, as well as Extorted from\r\nhim, by the Force of _Menace_, and _Torment_. And his Bus'ness, at last,\r\nis _done_, as Dead, _One way_ as _T'other_: And so for the Degrees of\r\n_Danger_; There's _Danger at Hand_; there's _Danger_ at a _Distance_;\r\n_Danger_ in _Design_, and _Danger_ in _Practice_; And _Danger_, in fine,\r\nthrough All the _Preparatory_, and _Mediate Tendencies_ to _Mischief_,\r\nto the _Last Effect_ that _Pushes_ it self forth to _Execution_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ Very Good! And what are All These _Sorts_, and _Degrees_ of\r\n_Danger_ to the _Instances_ we have now _Before_ us?\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 'Tis true; The _Faction_ is not in Condition to _Attacque_ the\r\n_Government_ by _Force_: Their _Armies_ are _Scatter'd_, and their\r\n_Squadrons Defeated_; the _Whole Party_ put to their _Shifts_; and the\r\nvery _Best_ of 'em, has enough to do to _save his Own Bacon_. Their\r\n_Teeth_ are _Drawn_, I'le Allow ye, All but here and there a _Stump_;\r\nAnd yet they'l _Pinch, Plaguily_, though they cannot _Worry_, and\r\n_Tear_: And with _Time_, and _Good Discipline_, they'l come to _Grow\r\nagain_. They have the _Same Principles_ to friend, that _ever_ they had:\r\nOnly they must be _Manag'd Another Way_: And there can never Want\r\n_Matter_, for _Artificial Flattery, Wheedling, Imposture_ and\r\n_Hypocrisy_, to _Work_ upon. They are not in Condition to _Advance_, at\r\nthis time of the Day, in the face of the _Sun_, and of the _Government_,\r\nwith their _Petticoats Flying_, under the _Auspicious Direction_ of\r\ntheir _Tutelary Angel, Ferguson_; and [Fear Nothing but God] for their\r\n_Motto_. But they must Supply want of _Strength_, by _Stratagem_; and\r\n_Carry-on_ their _Approches_, out of sight. 'Tis only a little more\r\n_Patience_, and the _Work_ will be brought about, as sure at the\r\n_Long-Run_, by a _Mine_, as by a _Battery_: And the _Certifying_ of _a\r\nHundred and Fifty Perrots_ into the _Service_, and _Protection_ Of the\r\n_Government_, will be of Greater _Effect_, then the _Drawing-up_ of _Ten\r\nThousand men in Arms_, Against it. Now _These Methods_ lye All _Open_\r\nstill, only they are somewhat more _About_. Now as to _Dangers Remote_,\r\nor _Nearer hand; Dangers_ of _Design_, or _Dangers_ of _Practice_: All\r\nthe _Preparatories_, & _Dispositions_ to _Mischief_, in their _Secret\r\nImpulses_, and _Causes_, are as _Vigorous_ Now, as Ever they were, that\r\nis to say, within Two or Three Motions of a _Publique Violence_: Only\r\nThis Difference in the Case, that we have _Hitherto_, been in the\r\n_Greatest Danger_ of our _Profess'd_, & _Open Enemies_: And _Now_, God\r\nbless us from our _Pretending Friends_: For all on a Sudden, the\r\n_Trimmers_ are come-up to be _Stark Church-of-England-men_; And the\r\n_Phanatiques_, gotten a _Form Higher_, into the _Seat_ or _Classes_ of\r\nthe _Trimmers_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ Thou art _Well, neither Full nor Fasting_. Neither _Fanatique_,\r\nnor _Trimmer_, nor _Church-of-England-man_ I perceive, will please ye;\r\nThe _Controversy_ of a New King; or a Common-Wealth, is _Out of Doors_;\r\nThe Question of Liberty of Conscience; The _Privilege_ of _Private\r\nMeetings_ for Religous Worship; And a _Challenge_ of _Dispensation_ from\r\nthe _Rites, Ceremonies, and_ Discipline _of the Church, are_ All layd\r\naside. And All This will not serve the _Turn_ yet. Now if Men go to\r\n_Church_; Take _Tests_, make _Declarations_; And _Do_ and _Perform_ All\r\nthat the _Law Requires_ of'em; where's the _Danger_ of These People I\r\nbeseech ye?\r\n\r\n_Obs._ Not in their _coming over_ with their _Bodies_, but in _Staying\r\nbehind_, in their _Good Wills_, and _Affections_: Nay, and in their\r\n_Communicating_ with the _Church_ in the _Morning_, and in the\r\n_Afternoon_, with the _Schism_: And pray will you Note in them, One\r\nThing _More_ too. 'Tis worth the while, when they _Ramble_ from their\r\n_Own Parish_, to _Observe_ whither they go: For I have known the very\r\n_Streets Throng'd_, out of Distance of _Hearing One Word_ that the\r\n_Minister says_, with the _Same Superstition_, that the _Quakers Flock_\r\nto the _Door_, when they are _Lock'd-out_ of the _Meeting-House_: In\r\nwhich Case, It has yet the _Semblance_ of a _Private Meeting_; And in\r\nTruth, looks liker a _Political Muster_, then a _Religious Exercise_:\r\nBut Heark ye for One Word, before we go any further; Suppose a Man\r\nshould have sayd about the _Beginning_ of _July Last_, in a _Brisk\r\nReply_ to a _Reflexion_ made upon the _Western-Rebells_; (at that time\r\nin their _Pride_ and _Glory_) [The King has as Loyal Subjects in That\r\nArmy as Any are in T'other.] Wouldst thou have me, in Construction of\r\n_Common Sense_, and _Honesty_, look upon _That Person_, to be,\r\nEffectually Come over, and in the _State_ of _a True\r\nChurch-of-England-man_; only for _Keeping_ the _Law_, with his _Heels_,\r\nwhen he _Breaks_ it, with his _Tongue_, and _Doctrine_? Now this is more\r\nthen I Owe ye, upon the Matter in hand: For you have Carry'd the\r\n_Question_ quite _back_ again, from the _Non-Con-Ministers_, to the\r\n_Generality_, and the _Multitude_ of the _Dissenters_: which is a Point\r\nWholly _Excepted_, and out of the _Limits_ of _Our Debate_: For All\r\ntheir _Conventicles_ without a _Mouth_, are _Monsters_; Meer\r\n_Nullities_, & _Bilks_, without a _Teacher_: So that I have _Restrain'd_\r\nmy _Applications_, Singly, to the _Rabbi's_ of the _Faction_, as\r\n_Including_, and _Implying_ the _Sense_, and the _Intent_ of their\r\n_Disciples_: Nay and _so far Including_ it, that they are _Barely_, the\r\n_Passive Instruments_ of their _Leaders_. Now These _Heads_ of the\r\n_Divided Parties_, are a sort of People, that do not, by any Means, fall\r\nwithin the _Charitable Prospect_ of _Your Qualifications_: For they\r\n_Stand-off_, in _Contempt_, and _Defyance_ of the _Orders_, & _Censures_\r\nof the _Church_, and of the _Law_, as much at _This Instant_, as _ever_\r\nthey did. Their _Followers Maintain_, and _Support_ them in That\r\n_Stubbornness_ of _Disobedience_; And so the _Opposition_ stands yet\r\n_Firm_, in _Effect_, though with _Less Noise_ of _Menace_, and _Tumult_.\r\nThe _Branches_, 'tis True, are _Lopt_; but the _Root_, not so much as\r\n_Touch'd_; Nay, and in such a Condition of _Vegetative Virtue_, and\r\n_Vigour_, that it wants nothing but _Time_, and a _Favourable Season_ to\r\nmake it _Sprout_ again. And This you may Assure your self of, that\r\nNothing less then an _Utter_, an _Open_, a _Solemn_, and an _Irrevocable\r\nDivorce_, betwixt _These Libertine-Seducers_, and Those that have been\r\n_Trepann'd_, and _Inveigled_, out of the _Bosom_ of the _Church_, into\r\nthe _Arms_ of the _Schism_: Nothing I say, less then Some such\r\n_Unalterable Act_, or _Decree_ of _Separation_, can ever _Secure_,\r\neither the _Church_, or the _State_ from the _Pernicious Consequences_\r\nof this _Intelligence_: For betwixt _Blind Pity_, and _Foolish Zeal_, on\r\nthe _One_ hand, and all the _Arts_, of _Moving_, and _Provoking_ Those\r\n_Passions_, and _Affections_, on the _Other_, there is _kept-up_, and\r\n_Cherish'd_, a _Communication_ of _Reciprocal Kindness_, between them,\r\nthat keeps the _Fire alive_ still in the _Embers_, 'till by _Degrees_,\r\nit _Blows-up_ All at last into a _Common Flame_. Now take away _These\r\nBellows_, and _T'other Sparks_, and a man may _Sleep_ in his _Bed_,\r\nwithout _Dreaming_ of _Conflagrations_, or the _Dread_ of Rising with\r\nhis Throat Cut.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ I will not Excuse some _Hot-Headed Blades_, that let their\r\n_Tongues_ run before their _Wits_; And make it a Point of _Honour_, to\r\n_Brave_ All the _Terrors_ of _Death_, and _Dungeons_, in defence of the\r\n_Cause_ that they have _Undertaken_. The _Less said_, the _Better_;\r\nThough a Body cannot, in _Generosity_, but have some sort of\r\n_Compassion_, for a Man that Suffers _Death_, with _Constancy of Mind_,\r\nEven in a Mistaken Cause, if it be according to his _Conscience_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ If these _Impressions_ were _Inbred_, and the _Errors_ purely\r\ntheir _Own_, it would be a _Point_, not only of _Good Nature_, but of\r\n_Common Justice_, and _Humanity_, to have a _Tenderness_ for _People_\r\nunder an _Invincible Mistake_: But you have Started the _Strongest\r\nArgument_ in the World, against your _self_ here, by _Enforcing_ the\r\n_Necessity_ of Clearing the _Stage_ of the _Seditious Oracles_, that\r\n_Inspire These Desperate Resolutions_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ Why All matter of _Violence, Heat_ of _Dispute_, and _Clamour_\r\nof _Argument_, is at an _End_. You hear no more of your _Scottish_, and\r\n_Western Declarations_; No more _Competitors_ for the _Crown_; or\r\n_Confederates_ for a _Republique_: And therefore prethee, _let_ us be at\r\n_Peace_ while we _May_ be at _Peace_; and do not stand _Puzzling_ the\r\n_People_ with _Danger_, where _No Danger is_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ Soft and Fair, _Trimmer_; those _Declarations, Practices_, and\r\n_Attempts_, are not to be _Repeated_ again in the _same Age_: But there\r\nare _more ways to the Wood then One_: And 'tis All a case, to a man\r\nthat's _Robb'd_, whether the _Thieves_ came in at the _Door_, or at the\r\n_Window_. 'Tis very Right, That, since the Breaking of the _Rebellion_,\r\nthe _Non-Cons_ lay their _Fingers_ upon their _Mouths_; and not _One\r\nWord_ of _Late_, upon the Subject of _Liberties_, and _Properties_; or\r\nof the Danger of _Tyranny_, and of _Arbitrary Power_: But All other\r\n_Grievances_ are Now _Swallow'd-up_ in _One_: They are All in _Tears_\r\nfor fear of the _Protestant Religion_; and _That's the Topique that's\r\nnow Carry'd-on, through All Shapes, Figures, and Disguises_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ We shall have fine Work, Next Bout!\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _Charles Brome_, at the Gun in St. _Paul's_\r\nChurch-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vol. 3.                                 =Numb. 202=\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVATOR.\r\n\r\n_The way of Promoting_ Fears, _and_ Jelousies. _The_ People _meerly_\r\nPassive _in the Bus'ness. Both Parts seem to_ Contend _for the_ Same\r\nCommon Principles. _The_ Rise of Jelousies.\r\n\r\n=Saturday=, August 21. 1686.\r\n\r\n\r\n_TRIMMER._ The _Accommodating_ of Words, Phrases, and Texts to the\r\nMatter in hand, with the Interjecting, here and there, of Certain\r\n_Emphatical Winks_, and _Innuendo's_, to the _Common People_, will do\r\nthe Bus'ness of _Fears and Jelousies_, you need never _Doubt_ it,\r\nwithout any more Ceremony.\r\n\r\n_OBSERVATOR._ I do no more _Doubt_ it, then I do, that a Proper Remedy;\r\nRightly Prepar'd; and Administer'd in the _Due_ Time and Proportion,\r\nwill _Work_ such or such an _Effect_. But the _Skill_ lyes, in the\r\nJudgment of the Distemper; The Constitution of the Patient; The Choice\r\nof the Physick; The Prescription of the Composition, the Preparation,\r\nand the Dos. Now _Your_ way of _Operating_, is only the Mechanicall\r\n_Part of the Bus'ness_; and no more, then the giving of a _Box_, a\r\n_Gally-pot_, or a _Glass_, with a Note of _Directions_, out of _One_\r\nhand into _Another_: which Any _Porter_ that Plyes at the _Next Corner_,\r\nwould do as _Dext'rously_, as ever a _Doctor_ of the _College_. The\r\n_Difficulty_, and the _Mystery_, is Over, before _You_ have any thing to\r\n_Do_ with it: The _Poysonous_, and _Intoxicating Draught_, Prepar'd; The\r\n_Multitude_ set a-Gaping for't, and Your _Office_, is only at last, to\r\n_Pour it down their Throats_. There's Matter of _History_, and _Fact_,\r\nenough, 'tis true, to _Satisfy any man_, that People may be made as\r\n_Mad_ with _Cant_, and _Gibberish_, as if they had taken _Henbane_; and\r\nthat _the_ Sting _of_ Jelousy, will put them out of their _Wits_ as soon\r\nas _the_ Biting _of a_ Mad-Dog: But we are in the _Dark_ all this while,\r\nfor the Rise, the Progress, and the Methods of Enflaming _Jelousies_, to\r\nbring'em up to that _Pitch_. Prethee let me Understand a little of their\r\nBirth, Growth, Discipline, and Education; How they are Fed, Nourish'd,\r\nand Entertain'd? What's the End, and Use of them? What Language do they\r\n_Speak_; or how comes it to pass, that the _Same_ Words, and Phrases,\r\nwithout _Any Intelligence_ with _Grammar, Logique, Common Usage_, or\r\n_Propriety_, should _Transport_ Some _Men_ into _Outrages, Palpitations\r\nof the Heart, Horrors_, and _Tremblings_, both of _Mind_, and of _Body_;\r\nand yet Work no more upon Others, then they _did_, before the very\r\nLetters of'em were taken out of the _Alphabet_? I do not call ye to a\r\n_Strict Shrift_ upon _Every Point_, but I Expect you shall say\r\nsomething to the _Whole Matter_; for a _Few Words_, in Order, will give\r\na man more _Light_ to the _Reason_ of a Thing, then as many _Volumes_,\r\nin Confusion.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ You are in the _Right_; that the _Craft_ lies in the Project,\r\nand the Preparatory _Manage_ of this Affair, and that the _Danger_ is\r\ngone too _Far_, when the _Mine_ is already _Wrought_; the _Powder\r\nDispos'd_, and nothing wanting to the _Final Execution_ of the\r\n_Mischief_, but the _Lighting_ of the _Match_, and the Applying of the\r\n_Coal_ to the _Train_. You have _Well_ and _Truly_ enough _Observed_,\r\nthe _Wonderfull Force_, that _Some Certain_ Words, and Phrases have;\r\nupon the _Affections_ of the _Multitude_; without the Least _Shadow_ of\r\nany Logical, Grammatical, or Philosophical _Reason_ for the _Operation_\r\nof them. Now you must know, that _These_ Words, and Phrases, are made\r\n_Use_ of, and _Understood_, in the way of a Cypher, or a Jargon, and not\r\naccording to the _Ordinary Acceptation_ of them, in a _Regular_ way of\r\n_Writing_, or of _Speaking_; So that, Effectually, the _Efficacy_ of\r\nsuch _Words_, and _Phrases_, is given for _Granted_; and how they come\r\nto _Obtain that Force_, remains the _Single Question_.\r\n\r\nNow towards the _Understanding_ of this Matter, you must Consider, that\r\nno _State_ can be _Supplanted_, but by _Turning_ the _Peoples Hearts_,\r\nagainst the _Persons_, & the _Actions_ of their _Superiors_: So that in\r\n_All Conspiracies_ to _Destroy_ a _Government_, Fears & Jelousies, are\r\n_the_ Corner Stone _of the Babel_. Their Hearts are no sooner _Lost_,\r\nbut they withdraw their Bodies too, and so, by _Degrees, Erect_ Laws,\r\nand Religions of their Own; and look upon themselves, by This time, as\r\nin _Another Commonwealth_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 'Tis most _Certainly True_; and that in this _Separation_, they\r\nset-up an _Interest_ of _Direct_ Spite, as well as Opposition, to That\r\nof the _Church_, and of the _State_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ This is the very Course, and Progress of a _Popular Jelousy_:\r\nBut pray take Notice as we go, that the _People_, are thus far, _Meerly_\r\nPassive; and _Contribute No Otherwise_, to the _Ruine_ of the\r\n_Publique_, then _a_ Snapping Sea does, to the _Sinking_ of a _Vessell_,\r\nwhen the _Billows_ are _Hurry'd-on_ by the _Violence_ of an\r\nIrresistible Tempest: if the _Winds_ would but let the _Waves alone_,\r\nthey'd be _Quiet_. When they come once to Gather into [Private\r\nMeetings,] (or as you call them, Conventicles) you may _Then_ accompt\r\nupon it, that they are as good as put to _School_, to _Learn_ the\r\nMystery of their _Profession_. For there are Canting-Schools, as well as\r\nReading-Schools: and under This _Discipline_, they come by _Insensible\r\nDegrees_, to part with their _English_ Tongue, as well as with their\r\n_English_ Principles, and Manners. Nay, and Effectually, to take up such\r\n_Uncouth, Novel_, and _Strange_ Thoughts, Opinions, and Practices, that\r\nit looks, as if the English-Man, the Christian, and the Subject, were\r\nall lost in a Disguise. They are now, you must know, under New Lords,\r\nand Consequently, under New Laws; where they are _Train'd-up_ to _New\r\nWays_ of Understanding Things, and to a _New Idiome_ of Expressing them.\r\nReligion, Law, Government, Conscience, Good Manners, are so _Sacred_ in\r\nThemselves, that the _Worst_ of Men cannot but _Pretend_ a _Veneration_\r\nfor them; but how to _Baffle_, or to _Elude_ the _Force_, the\r\n_Obligation_, and the _Authority_ of them; and, at the Same Time, to\r\nset-up for the _Asserters_, and _Supporters_ of _These Publique Rights,\r\nPrivileges_, and _Duties, There_ lies the _Difficulty_ of the\r\n_Undertaking_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ That is to say, how to _Resolve_ Religion, into an _Empty_\r\nNotion: To Talk Christianity into a Paradox; and, with Christ in our\r\n_Mouths_, at _London_, to _fall down_, and _Worship_ Mahomet, in _Buda_:\r\nHow to _Confound_ Gods, and the Governments Friends and Enemies, so as\r\nto make the _Common People_ take _One_ for _T'other_. Now This can be no\r\nway done, but by setting-up the Counterfeit of Religion, Law, and\r\nConscience, against the _Genuine_, and _Authentique_ Original; and by\r\nmaking Evil, to be Good, and Good, to be Evil.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ You must _Note_, further, that in This _Opposition_, the Main\r\nCause appears to be the _very Same_, on _Both sides_; and _Both Parts_\r\nseem to _Contend_, for the Same Common Principles, of _Divine Worship_,\r\nand of _Civil Obedience_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ Only the _One_ Flies to the _Invisible Lights_ and _Dictates_ of\r\nthe _Spirit_, in Matter of Religion; (taking Fancy for Revelation) and,\r\nin the Matter of Government, has Recourse to Certain _Unaccountable\r\nWhimsies_, of [Powers Reserv'd,] where there _never was any Power at\r\nall_; & _These Fooleries_, they _Trump_ upon the _Little People_, under\r\nthe _Pompous Name_ of [_FUNDAMETALS_;] while the _Rulers_, on the\r\n_Other_ hand, Stick to the Law, to the Text, and to the _Approved Sense_\r\nof the Best Interpreters of Both, for their _Guide_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ Very Good! And after they have _Departed_ from the Common Rule,\r\nand _Divided_ themselves from the Common Interest; it is but Reasonable\r\nto _Expect_, that they will Set-up Another Interest, and Another Rule to\r\n_Themselves_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ Well! But how do they _Manage That Province_ all this while, as\r\nto the _Subject_, I mean, that we were _Speaking_ of?\r\n\r\n_Trim._ Why their way is, only to put _Religion_, and _Government_ in\r\n_Another Dress_; but under the Name, of [Religion,] and [_Government_,]\r\n_Still_; and then to lay on a _Superstructure_, Answerable to the\r\n_Foundation_; I speak of the Leaders only; for their Disciples are\r\n_Blanck Paper_; and ready for _any Impression_. They _Talk_, to the\r\nEars, and to the Passions of their _Hearers_, not to their\r\nUnderstandings: and their _Auditors_ gather more of their _Meaning_,\r\nfrom their _Gestures, Actions, Countenances_, and from _Pathetical\r\nTones_, then from the _Words Themselves_. As for _Sense_, or _No Sense_,\r\n'tis _all a Case_; for 'tis the _Jingle_, not the _Matter_, that does\r\n_Their Bus'ness_. The _Less_ the People Understand, the _More_ they are\r\nEdify'd; for they take the _Congruities_ of Carnal Reason, for Vain\r\nPhilosophy; and Incomprehensible Nonsense, passes for _the Work of the_\r\nLight Within. Their _Religion_ lies alltogether in Groan, and Rapture:\r\n_They Sacrifice to the_ Unknown God; and in One Word; They _Supply_ the\r\n_Want_ of Knowledge, with an _Excess_ of Zeal; and when they cannot\r\n_Understand_ the Plain English of a _Discourse_, they Wrap Themselves up\r\nin the Mystery. The making of a _Party_, & the Saving of their own\r\n_Skins_, are the _Two Main Points_ of the _Leaders_; and therefore, they\r\n_Cover_ themselves under Ambiguity, & Riddle; & Compass those Matters,\r\nby _Theatrical Gesticulations_, & _Actions_, which they dare not\r\n_Venture_ upon, in _Words_ at _Length_, or by the _Dint_ of _Argument_;\r\nfor there is no _Law_ against _making of_ Faces, _and Dusting of_\r\nCushions, They are told _Mightily_, and _Plainly_, of _Heaven_, and\r\n_Hell_; but in such a _Manner_, that they will _Never Allow_ God, and\r\nthe Government to be _Both of a side. Schism_ is Dignified with the\r\n_Name_ of Conscience; the Story of their _Grievances_, is the\r\n_Bitterest_ of Satyrs; Their very Petitions have the force of\r\n_Invectives_; and the _Smoother_, the _Softer_, you find the _Surface_\r\nof them, the _Falser_, and the more _Dangerous_ they are at the\r\n_Bottom_: For betwixt the Persecution that is _Insinuated_, on the part\r\nof the _Government_, & the Innocence, the Piety, and the Modesty, on\r\nthat of the Sufferers, Nothing can more Provoke, a _Horror_, and\r\n_Indignation_ for the _One_, or a _Tenderness_, & _Compassion_, for the\r\n_Other_.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ That is to say, among Those that are not _Well Enform'd_, in the\r\n_Reason_, and _Equity of the Cause in Question_.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ Come Come. I tell ye _Nakedly_ how things Are, and not how they\r\nOught to be: and I speak of _Those Men_ too, that neither Do, nor Will,\r\nnor Can make a _Right Judgment_ upon the Matter in _Issue_. They do not\r\ntake down _Reasons_ in Connexion; neither do their _Teachers_ so much as\r\nOffer at'em; But _their Work_ is, only to _Feed_ Itching Ears, and\r\nHumours, with _New-Quoyn'd Words, Affectate Phrases_: And briefly, to\r\n_Instruct_ their _Disciples_, by _Signs_ and _Tokens_, like so many\r\n_Dancing Horses_ to fall Lame upon all Four, for the _Pope_; to\r\ncome-over, for the _Grand Vizier_; and at the very _Sound_ of Babylon,\r\nAnti-Christ, or Absolute Power, to Snort, and Boggle, as if they _Smelt\r\nFire_. If I may tell ye the _Arrant Truth_, and _Simplicity_ of my\r\n_Heart_; This is the very Train of a Popular Institution. They are\r\nTutor'd, and Inur'd, to the Assuming of such and such _Passions_, upon\r\nsuch and such _Occasions_; and they do All their _Ayres_, and _Tricks_,\r\nby the Direction of the _Hand_, or _Eye. They Dance_ to _Sounds, Hints,\r\nNodds, Forms_, and _Syllables_; not to the force of _Fair Reasonings_,\r\nand _Natural Conclusions_; Nay, they are Taught, when to be _Angry_;\r\nwhen to be _Pleas'd_; and their very _Inclinations_, and _Aversions_,\r\nare none of their _Own, Neither_: The _Whole Bus'ness_, in short, is\r\nArtifice, Manage, and Practice; for _All their_ Mistakes, _and_\r\nMis-understandings, _take the_ Same Biass.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ I do _Observe_, indeed, that they Shelter themselves under the\r\n_Dark Prophets_, and the _Revelation_. The _Number of the Beast_, they\r\nhave all at their _Fingers Ends_; the _Geneva-Bibles_ are _Thumm'd_ over\r\nand over, at the _Same Texts_: As upon the Subject of the _Groves_, &\r\nthe _High Places, Christian Liberty, Will-Worship, Humane Inventions,\r\nIdolatry, Superstition_, &c. There's not a _Verse_ in the whole _Bible_,\r\nagainst _Persecution_, but makes them Shake their Heads at the\r\n_Government_. Popery by _Interpretation_, is Episcopacy: The _Liberty_\r\nof the Subject, has an _Aking Tooth_ at the _Prerogative_ of the Prince:\r\nBut finally; such and such Terms, and Forms of Speaking, are, by Common\r\nConsent, to pass for _Current_, under such or such a Sense, and\r\nMeaning, how _Contrary_ soever, to their _Proper_, and _Genuine\r\nSignification_, or _Import_. But this speaks only to the Propagating of\r\n_Jelousies_, not to the Rise of them.\r\n\r\n_Trim._ If you Ask me the [Rise] of _Jelousies_, I must _Answer_ ye,\r\nthat they are _Begotten_ betwixt Ambition, Avarice, Hypocrisy, Craft,\r\nMalice, and Disloyalty, on the _One_ side; and Ignorance, Obstinacy,\r\nBlind Zeal, and an Impetuous Temerity, on the _Other_.\r\n\r\n_London_, Printed for _Charles Brome_, at the Gun in St. _Paul's_\r\nChurch-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ANDREWS CLARK\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL LIBRARY\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS IN PRINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS IN PRINT\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n1948-1949\r\n\r\n16.
