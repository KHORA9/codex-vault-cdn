A strong appeal is\r\nmade to the women voters of our nation to prepare themselves for\r\npublic life by keeping in touch with the issues of the day as well as\r\nthe functions of government. While it is a great privilege to take\r\npart in public affairs, and study the questions of the day, so that we\r\ncan vote intelligently and criticize justly, let us not forget that\r\nthe home is the most sacred refuge of life, the nucleus around which\r\nall pure and true civilization is formed, and that the chief end of\r\nall good government is to improve and protect the home, the church and\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nWill you take part in building up your government and establishing\r\n\"High Ideals\" and true democracy?\r\n\r\n                                                    EMMA GUY CROMWELL,\r\n                                                        Frankfort, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood citizenship means doing well one's part as a member of the\r\ncommunity in which he lives, and carries with it certain privileges\r\nand duties.\r\n\r\nA citizen is one who has the rights and privileges of the inhabitants\r\nof the community, state and nation, and as a duty should equip himself\r\nso as to render the best citizenship possible.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of citizens; native born, and naturalized.\r\nPersons born in the United States and children born of American\r\nparents while abroad are native born. Naturalized citizens are aliens\r\nwho through the process of naturalization have attained citizenship.\r\nNaturalization itself does not give the right to vote, as that is\r\ndetermined by the state laws. Most states give all citizens the right\r\nto vote who have lived in the state for one year, and about eleven\r\nstates permit aliens to vote provided they declare their intention of\r\nbecoming citizens.\r\n\r\nCongress has the power to decide the conditions upon which aliens may\r\nbecome citizens.\r\n\r\nCitizenship carries with it the enjoyment of civil rights, as the\r\nprotection of the home and property, freedom of speech, religion,\r\npress, protection of the laws, etc. Wherever you go your citizenship\r\ngoes with you, protecting and defending you. If you are in a foreign\r\ncountry you must abide by the laws of that country, but should you be\r\ntreated unjustly the United States would protect you.\r\n\r\nOur country is a land of freedom and opportunity, and it is our duty\r\nto help uplift the government, and as citizens we must study\r\nconditions and know how to govern and be governed. We must be familiar\r\nwith our national and state Constitutions, for they are the\r\nfundamental principles by which we are governed. We must know how to\r\nmake laws and how to have them executed. We must keep posted on the\r\nissues of the day, and know something of the standing and character of\r\nour public men and women.\r\n\r\nThe citizen who does not possess some knowledge of his government and\r\nits workings will become a prey to the demagogue, or of individuals\r\nwho are anxious to advance their own interest at the expense of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every man and woman under the protection of our flag\r\nto give his or her best to the country and be willing to take upon\r\nthemselves the burden as well as the privilege of government, and\r\nfully appreciate the inheritance our fathers left. \"They built the\r\nfoundation in the days of Washington and Jefferson, and as a duty we\r\nmust safeguard the building.\"\r\n\r\nCitizenship not only embraces civil rights, but political rights which\r\nis the right of suffrage or voting.\r\n\r\nWhile civil rights are enjoyed by all men, women and children,\r\npolitical rights are enjoyed only by citizens twenty-one years old and\r\nover who possess the necessary qualifications to vote. Civil rights\r\nand political rights are not the same, for all citizens are not\r\nvoters, neither are all voters citizens in the United States, as some\r\nstates permit aliens to vote before they get their citizenship paper,\r\nmaking them real citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty to study our government and be posted on the issues of\r\nthe day. There are about 27,011,330 women voters in the United States.\r\nWe have the vote and let us not only count it a privilege but a duty\r\nto do our part as citizens in establishing good government.\r\n\r\nThere are two principal parties in the United States, the Democratic\r\nparty and the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe way to get good government is through the parties; that is one\r\nreason women must choose their party and enter into the organization\r\nof the party of their choice.\r\n\r\nParties are just what their constituents make them.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe word government means management or guidance and control.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the government of the nation, state, city, town or\r\ncounty we refer to the management of public affairs.\r\n\r\nGovernment protects life and property, keeps an army and navy for our\r\ndefense, peace and order, regulates commerce and industry, supports\r\nour public schools, keeps the roads and streets in good condition,\r\ncares for public health, and many other things we enjoy.\r\n\r\nOur courts are maintained by the government where justice may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe laws of our nation are the rules made by the government to guide\r\nour actions. They tell us what we are to do, and what we are not to\r\ndo. We must obey the laws of our country or else be punished. We must\r\nstudy the government of our nation, state, city, town and county, and\r\nbe ready to do our part in establishing good government, by making\r\nproper laws and seeing they are enforced. As far back as 500 B. C. we\r\nfind in Athens lawmakers, judges and executive officers.\r\n\r\nThe word government is derived from the Latin word gubernare, which\r\nmeans to guide or \"pilot a ship.\" Good government depends upon the\r\nvoters, and may our men and women of the United States pilot our ship\r\ninto a safe harbor.\r\n\r\nThe United States is both a Democracy and a Republic.\r\n\r\nA Democracy is a government by the people in which the will of the\r\npeople prevails throughout the country. \"This is the fundamental\r\nprinciple of American government.\"\r\n\r\nA Republic is a democracy where the people elect representatives to\r\ncarry on the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonies became independent states each state drew up a\r\ncharter which recognized its people as authority in government.\r\nInstead of calling this new instrument a charter they changed the name\r\nand called it a \"Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThis Constitution is the foundation upon which our government is\r\nbuilt. After the thirteen original colonies had established their\r\nindependence they formed a central government known and expressed in\r\nthe Constitution of the United States which is our fundamental law.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble of the Constitution of the United States we find the\r\ngeneral purpose for which government is instituted:\r\n\r\n\"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the\r\ncommon defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings\r\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish\r\nthis Constitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States is our fundamental law and no\r\nstate constitution can conflict with our Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThere are now forty-eight states in the United States with forty-eight\r\nconstitutions framed upon the Federal Constitution. Each state has its\r\nown constitution, which in no way conflicts with the Federal\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe first Constitution of Kentucky was adopted April 3, 1792, at a\r\nconvention that met in Danville, and later on June 1st, 1792, Kentucky\r\nwas admitted into the union as a state.\r\n\r\nOur government is conducted according to our National and State\r\nConstitutions.\r\n\r\nIn every constitution there is a provision for making a change. These\r\nchanges are called amendments. An amendment is a law passed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and adopted by a majority of the voters.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the Kentucky Constitution requires a three-fifths vote\r\nof the members in both houses of the legislature to pass, and then it\r\nis submitted by the General Assembly to the voters of the State, which\r\nrequires a majority of the voters to be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe legislature cannot repeal an amendment to the Constitution, or\r\npass laws contrary to its provision. The session of nineteen and\r\ntwenty in Kentucky passed two amendments pertaining to school matters.\r\nOne provides for the appointment of the Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction by the Governor, and the other amendment provides: \"That\r\nthe General Assembly have the power to distribute the school funds.\"\r\n\r\nAt the next general election we will vote on these two amendments. If\r\nthe majority of the voters vote yes, this change will be made, and the\r\nGeneral Assembly will have the power to distribute the school funds\r\nand the Governor will appoint the Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution may be amended by two-thirds vote of each\r\nHouse of Congress, and if passed must be referred to the state\r\nlegislatures for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe amendments to the Constitution of the United States do not become\r\na part of the Constitution until ratified by three-fourths of the\r\nStates, which is now thirty-six states--there being forty-eight states\r\nin the union.\r\n\r\nThere are now eighteen amendments to the Federal Constitution. The\r\nnineteenth amendment on \"Suffrage\" is still pending, needing only one\r\nmore state to give universal suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to a constitution is simply changing some of its\r\nprovisions, but a revision is a recasting of the whole constitution.\r\nBoth require the consent of the voters of the State.\r\n\r\nAs we have said the revision usually takes place by means of a\r\nconvention of delegates elected for that purpose by the people.\r\n\r\n\"One of the most important parts of every state constitution is the\r\n'Bill of Rights,' which is a statement of the rights which must not be\r\ninfringed on by the government.\"\r\n\r\nIn the revision of a state constitution the legislature submits to the\r\npeople the question of calling a convention to frame a new\r\nconstitution. If the voters are in favor of a convention they elect\r\ndelegates to the convention to assist in revising the constitution.\r\nThe revised constitution is nearly always submitted to the people to\r\nvote upon.\r\n\r\nThe amendment known as the eighteenth amendment passed during\r\nPresident Wilson's term of office and is one of great importance to\r\nour nation in the protection of the home and humanity. This amendment\r\nprohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 1. After one year from the ratification of this article, the\r\nmanufacture, sale and transportation of intoxicating liquors within,\r\nthe importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the\r\nUnited States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof\r\nfor beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2. The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent\r\npower to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\nThere are now eighteen amendments to our Federal Constitution, and\r\nthere has never been an amendment repealed.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth amendment known as the suffrage amendment passed both\r\nhouses of Congress on May 21st and June 4th, 1919, submitting to the\r\nstates a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution extending\r\nsuffrage to women. The first state to take action was Wisconsin, whose\r\nlegislature, June 5th, 1919, ratified the amendment. Other state\r\nratifications were Michigan, June 10th, Kansas, New York and Ohio,\r\nJune 16th, Illinois, June 17th, Pennsylvania, June 24th,\r\nMassachusetts, June 25th, Texas, June 28th, Iowa, July 2nd, Missouri,\r\nJuly 3rd, Arkansas, July 28th, Montana, July 30th, Nebraska, August\r\n1st, Minnesota, September 8th, New Hampshire, September 10th, Utah,\r\nSeptember 30th, California, November 1st, Maine, November 5th, North\r\nDakota, December 1st, South Dakota, December 4th, Kentucky, January\r\n6th, 1920.\r\n\r\nThe proposed amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not\r\nbe denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account\r\nof sex.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2. Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation, to\r\nenforce the provisions of this article.\"\r\n\r\nThe following states had granted state wide woman's suffrage: Wyoming\r\n1869, Colorado 1893, Utah 1896, Idaho 1896, Washington 1910,\r\nCalifornia 1911, Kansas, Arizona and Oregon 1912, Territory of Alaska\r\n1913, Montana and Nevada 1914, New York 1917, Michigan, Oklahoma,\r\nSouth Dakota 1918.\r\n\r\nAmendments to the Federal Constitution may be proposed by Congress by\r\ntwo-thirds vote, then submitted to the states for ratification by at\r\nleast three-fourths of the states acting through their legislatures\r\n(or through state conventions as Congress may indicate, or Congress\r\nmay call a national convention for this purpose).\r\n\r\nAs has been said eighteen amendments to the National Constitution have\r\nbeen made since its adoption. The nineteenth amendment will soon be\r\nadopted in full as it only needs one more state to make the\r\nthree-fourths or thirty-six states which will give us universal\r\nsuffrage throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that the Constitution of the United States is the\r\nsupreme law of the land, and no law will stand in our courts that is\r\nin violation of our National Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nKINDS OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience the United States is divided into forty-eight states\r\nand each state is divided into counties. Kentucky has one hundred and\r\ntwenty counties.\r\n\r\nWe have National, State, county, town and city government.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL OR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Federal or National government, as in state government, is divided\r\ninto three parts. The legislative which makes the laws. The judicial\r\nwhich interprets or explains the laws. The executive which enforces\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\nLegislative: The legislative department is called the Congress and is\r\ncomposed of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected every two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe number of representatives in a state is apportioned according to\r\npopulation, and the congressional district from which a member is\r\nelected is determined by the legislature of each state.\r\n\r\nKentucky has eleven congressional districts, therefore eleven\r\ncongressmen elected by the people.\r\n\r\nTo be a member of the House of Representatives in Congress the man or\r\nwoman must be twenty-five years old, a citizen of the United States at\r\nleast seven years, and a resident of the state from which he is\r\nchosen. He receives a salary of $7,500 per year, and an allowance for\r\nclerk, stationery and traveling expenses.\r\n\r\nEvery state is entitled to at least one representative. There are now\r\nfour hundred and thirty-five members in the House of Representatives\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen the members of a new House of Representatives meet the clerk of\r\nthe previous House calls them to order and the roll is called by\r\nstates. If a quorum is present they elect a speaker from among the\r\nmembers of the House who takes his seat immediately. The other\r\nofficers are elected as the clerk, sergeant-at-arms and doorkeeper.\r\nThe rules of the House define the duties of the speaker.\r\n\r\nThe work of the House of Representatives is done through committees.\r\nWhen a bill is introduced it is referred to a committee and this\r\ncommittee may report it back to the House either favorably or\r\nunfavorably, or they may not report it at all. If reported favorably\r\nit has a chance of receiving consideration.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work of Congress is done in the committee rooms. This is\r\nwhy the selection of committees is so important.\r\n\r\nWhen a bill is reported favorably by a committee it is placed upon the\r\ncalendar which is a register of bills. Then the fate of the bill rests\r\nwith the rules committee of the House.\r\n\r\nThe committee on rules, as other committees, is elected by the House.\r\nThe party in power usually determines the selection of this committee.\r\n\r\nImpeachment: If a high official is charged with misconduct in office\r\nthe House of Representatives would impeach him and if found guilty,\r\nthe impeachment is carried to the Senate to be tried. The U. S. Senate\r\nsits as a court of justice.\r\n\r\nSix judges, one President and one Secretary of War have been impeached\r\nby the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nRevenue: All bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has ninety-six members, two from every state in the union,\r\nand are elected for six years, receiving a salary of $7,500 a year.\r\nThe presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe United States Senators are elected by the direct voice of the\r\nvoters of the state according to the 17th amendment to the National\r\nConstitution passed in 1913.\r\n\r\nA United States Senator must be thirty years old, a citizen of the\r\nUnited States for nine years, and must live in the state from which he\r\nis elected.\r\n\r\nThe term of office of only one-third of the Senators expires at the\r\nsame time, so at least two-thirds of the Senate is not new.\r\n\r\nThe Senate must confirm all appointments made by the President and\r\nmust ratify all treaties made by him with a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nBills originate in the Senate in the same way as in the House,\r\nreferred to a committee and their course is directly the same. When\r\npassed by both Houses the President has ten days to sign or veto them.\r\nWithout his signature they become a law, unless Congress by adjourning\r\nprevents the return within ten days.\r\n\r\nThe committees of the Senate are elected by its members.\r\n\r\nBills are passed in Congress similar to that in the legislature of a\r\nstate. They are introduced by a member in either house and must pass\r\nboth houses, then signed by the presiding officers and clerks and go\r\nto the President for his signature or veto.\r\n\r\nThe sessions are yearly, beginning on the first Monday in December,\r\nand last until March 4th; this is known as the short session. The long\r\nsession occurs in odd numbered years and continues until it is\r\nadjourned. The President has the power to call special sessions of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts derive their powers and jurisdiction from the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The judicial powers of the United States shall be vested in one\r\nSupreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time\r\nto time establish.\"\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is the highest and most\r\npowerful judicial body in the world.\r\n\r\nIt holds its regular sessions at Washington, sitting from October to\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nThe chief justice and eight associate justices constitute the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, and are appointed for life by the\r\nPresident of the United States and confirmed by the United States\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe salary of the chief justice is $15,000.00 per year, and of the\r\nassociate justices $14,000.00 per year.\r\n\r\nSix judges must be present in the trial of a case and a majority is\r\nnecessary in rendering a decision.\r\n\r\nThe district judges receive a salary of $6,000.00 annually and the\r\njudges of the appeals court $7,000.00 annually.\r\n\r\nThe judges cannot be removed except for cause, and then they are\r\nimpeached in the House of Representatives and tried in the United\r\nStates Senate.\r\n\r\nThe principal Federal courts that have been organized by Congress are:\r\nThe Supreme Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Circuit Court,\r\nthe District Court.\r\n\r\nA United States judge if he has served ten years may retire on full\r\nsalary when seventy years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe most important offices in the United States are the President and\r\nVice President. They are legally elected by electors chosen by the\r\nvoters of the forty-eight states.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States must be a natural born citizen\r\nliving in this country for fourteen years at least, and must be\r\nthirty-five years old.\r\n\r\nHe is elected for four years and receives a salary of $75,000.00\r\nannually and residence. Congress makes other allowances for expenses.\r\n\r\nThe President is the Commander in Chief of the army and navy. He\r\nappoints every administrative officer except the Vice President. He\r\nmay call extra sessions, and may veto bills, which Congress can pass\r\nover his veto with a two-thirds majority in each House. He represents\r\nthe United States in all dealings with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe President appoints the members of his cabinet, but said\r\nappointments must be approved by the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet consist of a Secretary of State, Treasury, War, Navy,\r\nAgriculture, Commerce, Labor, Interior, the Attorney General and\r\nPostmaster General.\r\n\r\nEach member of the Cabinet receives a salary of $12,000.00 annually.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State is the first in rank among the Cabinet\r\nofficers, and in case of the death of the President and Vice President\r\nwould succeed to the office of President.\r\n\r\nThe financial manager of the national government is the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War has charge of the military affairs of the nation\r\nunder the direction of the President. He also looks after river and\r\nharbor improvements, and all obstructions to navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General is the chief law officer of the government.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster General has charge of the Post Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Navy has charge of the construction and equipment of\r\nvessels of war.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Interior has charge of matters pertaining to the\r\ninternal welfare of the nation, as public lands, care of national\r\nparks, the giving of patents for inventions, Indian affairs,\r\neducation, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture promotes the general agricultural\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Commerce promotes the commercial interest of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Labor promotes and develops the welfare of the wage\r\nearner of the United States, by improving the working conditions and\r\nadvancing their opportunities for better employment.\r\n\r\nThe Vice President of the United States must have the same\r\nqualifications as the President.\r\n\r\nHe receives a salary of $12,000.00 annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATIES.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the National Constitution gave the United States Senate\r\ntwo important executive powers especially--first, approving treaties.\r\nSecond, confirming appointments made by the President. All treaties in\r\norder to be ratified must receive a two-thirds vote of the Senators\r\npresent when the vote was taken.\r\n\r\nWhen a treaty has been drawn up the President consults with the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations and the Senate. \"Treaties are\r\nconsidered in secret session. The Senate may approve or reject a\r\ntreaty as a whole; or they may ratify it in part by recommending\r\nadditional articles as amendments, but the treaty does not become a\r\nlaw until the President and the foreign power agree to the amendment.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Senate may approve, reject or change the terms of a treaty,\r\nall changes must be agreed to by the President and the nation\r\ninterested. When accepted by both nations duplicate parchment copies\r\nare made, and both copies are signed by the chief officers of each\r\ncountry and then exchanged. This is called the \"exchange of\r\nratification.\" Each nation secures an official copy of the treaty. The\r\nPresident publishes the treaty followed by a proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution gives the President the power to negotiate treaties\r\nand conventions with foreign countries. He conducts the negotiation\r\nthrough the department of Secretary of State. The President keeps in\r\ntouch and consults with the Committee on Foreign Relations and with\r\nthe majority of the leaders in the Senate during negotiations.\r\n\r\n\"The President shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators\r\npresent concur.\"\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution makes treaties a part of the supreme law of\r\nthe land. Any conflicting provision of a state law or Constitution is\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nThe League of Nations having failed to get the necessary two-thirds\r\nvote in the United States Senate so far has not become a law. It is\r\nopposed by a few senators which prevented it receiving the two-thirds\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE.\r\n\r\nA great number of our offices of government are appointed and not\r\nelected. Over 300,000 positions are filled under the national\r\ngovernment appointment. On January 16th, 1883, Congress passed the\r\nCivil Service law which established a United States Civil Service\r\nCommission composed of three members, of which not more than two\r\nshould belong to the same political party. The commission is appointed\r\nby the President with the consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary \"Civil Service\" examinations are held twice a year at\r\ndifferent places in the country designated by the commission.\r\n\r\nThis commission appoints boards of examiners who hold examinations at\r\nleast twice a year at Washington, D. C., and in the states and\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nThe commission encourages efficiency by promotion from lower to higher\r\ngrades of public service. Some of the places that come under the civil\r\nservice system are clerks in Washington connected with the national\r\ngovernment, officials in the postal service, the letter carriers and\r\nclerks in post offices and railway mail service, employees in custom\r\nhouses, government printing office, Indian service and revenue\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSenators and representatives are not allowed to recommend any\r\napplicant to the board of examiners appointed by the commission.\r\n\r\nThe examinations are practical and the questions pertain to the nature\r\nof the work the applicant is to do.\r\n\r\nPersons employed in such public service are under obligations not to\r\ncontribute to any political fund, or to render service to any\r\npolitical party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSTATE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state constitution adopted by the voters is the fundamental law of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nA state Constitution cannot interfere with the Federal Constitution,\r\nneither can the Federal Constitution interfere with the regulation of\r\nthe state. As has been said the Kentucky Constitution was adopted on\r\nApril 3, 1792, at a convention which met in Danville.\r\n\r\nA state Constitution is a law made by the people and cannot be changed\r\nby the legislature, but may be amended or revised by the voters.\r\n\r\nAmendments are usually submitted to the legislature and then to the\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\nThe revision of the Constitution is by means of a convention of\r\ndelegates elected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe three departments of state governments are: The legislative, the\r\nlawmaking power; the judicial, the law interpreting power; and the\r\nexecutive, the law enforcing power.\r\n\r\nAll state governments are divided into these three classes, the\r\nlegislative, judicial and executive.\r\n\r\nThe legislature passes laws which govern people in their relation to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky legislature convenes at the capital at Frankfort every\r\ntwo years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January and\r\nremains in session for sixty working days, not including Sundays and\r\nnational holidays.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of two houses, the House of Representatives, known as\r\nthe lower house with one hundred members, and the Senate, known as the\r\nupper house with thirty-eight members.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky General Assembly is composed of one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight members elected by the voters of the State in the\r\ncounties and districts in which they reside.\r\n\r\nThe State is divided into senatorial and representative districts,\r\nwith a representation based upon population.\r\n\r\nThe term of office for Senators is four years. A Senator must be\r\nthirty years old, a citizen of the United States for nine years and\r\nmust live in the State and district from which he is elected.\r\n\r\nA State Senator in Kentucky receives $10.00 per day for his services\r\nduring the sitting of the legislature, mileage to and from home at the\r\nrate of ten cents per mile, and stationery.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant Governor is the presiding officer of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Senate sits as a court and tries all impeachments.\r\n\r\nThe president pro tem. of the Senate is elected by the members of the\r\nbody, also the clerks, doorkeeper and pages.\r\n\r\nThe president pro tem. presides in the absence of the Lieutenant\r\nGovernor, and in case of vacancy to this office would become\r\nLieutenant Governor.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Senate appoints the standing committees, unless\r\nthe opposite party is in power, then the president pro tem. virtually\r\ncontrols said appointments.\r\n\r\nTo be a member of the House of Representatives a person must be\r\ntwenty-four years old.\r\n\r\nHis term of office is only two years but he receives the same salary\r\nas a Senator, $10.00 per day, mileage and stationery.\r\n\r\nThe body elects its speaker and other officers, and has the sole power\r\nof impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe principal work in both houses are done through the committees\r\nappointed by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nA bill is prepared and introduced by a member of the Senate or House.\r\nIf it pertains to revenue and taxation, it must originate in the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nWhen a bill is introduced the clerk of the body reads it by title\r\nonly. The President of the Senate or Speaker of the House then refers\r\nit to the proper committee (of the body in which the bill originated).\r\nIt is numbered and ordered printed when referred to the committee. The\r\ncommittee considers the bill and usually reports it back with\r\nexpression of opinion that it should or should not pass to the body in\r\nwhich it originated. (The committee may pigeonhole it and not report\r\nit, or may report it too late for action by the body.)\r\n\r\nThe bill and the report from the committee is printed and placed on\r\nthe calendar and takes its turn to be brought up for passage. (By\r\nconsent a bill is acted upon out of its turn.)\r\n\r\nThe bill is taken in its regular order from the calendar and read the\r\nsecond time in full by the clerk. It is open to debate or amendment\r\nunless the previous question is ordered, which if adopted cuts off\r\ndebate and amendment. Then the bill is read the third time by title\r\nonly. (Any member may demand the reading in full of the engrossed bill\r\nif he desires.) It is then placed on its passage by the presiding\r\nofficer of the body, and if passed it is then transmitted to the\r\nSenate by the House clerk, if a House bill. If a Senate bill, it is\r\ntaken by the Senate clerk to the House for consideration.\r\n\r\nA bill goes through the same form in either body, after which it is\r\nreturned to the body in which it originated with or without\r\namendments. If the bill is passed it goes into possession of the clerk\r\nof the body in which it originated. Then the enrolling clerk of the\r\nbody in which the bill originated enrolls it verbatim from the\r\noriginal. After it is enrolled it is compared by the committee on\r\nenrollment in each House. If found correctly enrolled the chairman of\r\neach committee reports it to the body, and it is compared again by the\r\nclerks of each body and signed by the clerk of the body in which it\r\noriginated, also signed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker\r\nof the House. (The presiding officer of the House in which it\r\noriginated signs first.) Then the clerk of that body takes it to the\r\nGovernor for his approval. If the Governor approves it he does so with\r\nhis signature. It becomes a law at once if it has an emergency clause;\r\notherwise, in ninety days after its signature by the Governor. It is\r\nthen filed with the Secretary of State. Then later on the bills\r\npassed during the session are compiled by the Attorney General and\r\nknown as the Acts of the General Assembly of that session. If the\r\nGovernor vetoes a bill while the Legislature is in session, it may be\r\ntaken up in the house in which it originated, and passed over his\r\nveto, but must receive a two-thirds vote in each house.\r\n\r\nThe Governor is allowed ten days after the General Assembly adjourns\r\nfor approving bills, and if not signed within that time they become\r\nthe law without his signature.\r\n\r\nThe passage of a bill in all the states is about the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nJUDICIARY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state courts derive their powers and jurisdiction from the\r\nConstitution and laws of the state. The courts in different states go\r\nby different names, yet the jurisdiction is about the same.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals is the highest court in Kentucky. It holds annual\r\nsessions from about September fifteenth to about June twenty-second at\r\nthe State Capitol, Frankfort, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nSeven judges and one commissioner constitute the Court of Appeals in\r\nKentucky, and each receives a salary of five thousand dollars per\r\nyear, a clerk or secretary and an office furnished in the new capitol\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nA person to be a member of the Court of Appeals must be thirty-five\r\nyears old and a citizen of the State for five years. He must have\r\nresided two years in the judicial district from which he is elected.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals or Supreme Court is the highest court of the\r\nState. This court is the State court of last resort.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the Court of Appeals are elected by the people for a\r\nterm of eight years, commencing on the first Monday in January\r\nsucceeding their election.\r\n\r\nThe cases tried before the Court of Appeals are usually appealed to it\r\nfrom the lower courts.\r\n\r\nThere are certain classes of cases that come before the Court of\r\nAppeals for first trial in which is involved the question of official\r\naction of State officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUIT COURT.\r\n\r\nThe circuit judge holds this court first in one county and then in\r\nanother until the circuit of the counties which compose his district\r\nis completed.\r\n\r\nCircuit court is held in the court house of the county seat two or\r\nthree times a year, presided over by the judge of that district\r\nelected by the voters. (In case of a vacancy the Governor of the State\r\nappoints some lawyer to fill his place.) The majority of important\r\ncases are tried in this court, because a jury trial may always be had\r\nin the circuit court.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States provides that every man or woman\r\nshall have the right to trial by jury in all criminal cases, and in\r\ncivil cases involving a sum of more than $20.00.\r\n\r\nTwelve citizens known as a grand jury usually meet at the time the\r\ncircuit court convenes. All violations of law are investigated, and\r\npersons found guilty are indicted by the grand jury.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY COURT.\r\n\r\nThe county court is held at the county seat of every county and is\r\npresided over by the county judge. The county judge is elected by the\r\nvoters of the county.\r\n\r\nIn this court civil suits are tried in which the sum involved is not\r\nover $200.00. It tries the more important cases which do not come\r\nbefore the justice of the peace court, or city police court.\r\n\r\nThe county judge's office is the most important office in the county.\r\nHe probates wills and appoints executors, administrators, and\r\nguardians. He is the head of the fiscal court which looks after all\r\nthe material interests of the county, as construction of roads, care\r\nof paupers and the general interest of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the peace court is the lowest court and is held by a\r\njustice of peace, called a magistrate, who is elected in that\r\nmagisterial district by the voters. Petty misdemeanors involving small\r\nsums of money are tried in this court.\r\n\r\nThe justices' courts are found in every community for protection and\r\nconvenience to the people.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates are members of the fiscal court of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICE COURT.\r\n\r\nThe police courts in towns and cities are similar to the justices'\r\ncourts. They are necessary in every city to try the petty\r\nmisdemeanors. A police judge is elected by the voters of the city and\r\ntries all petty cases under his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nJURIES.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury is selected by the court and is composed of not less\r\nthan twelve responsible and qualified citizens. It is their duty to\r\nmake a faithful inquiry into all wrongs and violations of the law.\r\nThey call witnesses before them and make an investigation, and upon\r\nsufficient proof against a person they have them indicted. The\r\nproceedings of a grand jury are secret.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"jury\" and trial by jury are quite different from a grand\r\njury. The grand jury investigates and inquires into all wrongs and\r\nviolations of the law and if the person accused is guilty returns an\r\nindictment. Then the trial jury of twelve persons after hearing the\r\nevidence given them in court returns their unanimous verdict one way\r\nor other, otherwise a hung jury.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between a trial by jury and a grand jury. The\r\npetit jury or trial by jury is composed of twelve men, honest and\r\nupright citizens living within the jurisdictional limits of the court,\r\ndrawn and selected by officers free from all biased opinion and sworn\r\nto render a true verdict according to the law and evidence given them.\r\nEvery citizen is entitled to a fair trial, even though the accused is\r\nknown to be guilty. The Constitution of the United States gives this\r\nright to all citizens.\r\n\r\nThe trial of all crimes shall be by jury except in impeachment. The\r\nConstitution provides that the trial be held in the state where the\r\ncrime is committed, and if the crime is not committed in any of the\r\nstates Congress has the power to name a place of trial.\r\n\r\nThe jurors decide whether or not the party accused is guilty by a\r\nunanimous vote, and if one or more vote against, it is called a hung\r\njury.\r\n\r\nThe judge of the court instructs the jurors on the law in the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe executive department of state government is the law enforcing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe governor of a state is the chief executive. His duty is to see\r\nthat the laws of his state are executed, to study the conditions and\r\nneeds of the state, and to prepare a message to the legislature\r\nsetting forth these needs and conditions. He is commander in chief of\r\nthe state militia.\r\n\r\nHe should fill all vacancies that come under his appointing power,\r\nappoint certain state officers and boards, grant pardon to convicted\r\ncriminals when right, call a special session of the legislature when\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe governor represents his state in its relation to the federal\r\ngovernment and to other states.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Kentucky receives a salary of six thousand and five\r\nhundred dollars per year, all expenses when on duty for the State, and\r\nin addition, a mansion lighted, heated, and furnished, and three\r\nthousand dollars per year for public entertaining. He is elected for\r\nfour years and cannot succeed himself for re-election.\r\n\r\nMost of the states have the following state officials elected by the\r\nvoters of the state: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of\r\nState, Treasurer, Auditor, Attorney General, Commissioner of\r\nAgriculture and Superintendent of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Attorney General and the\r\nSecretary of State compose the Board of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe county is a political division created by the state to administer\r\nlocal affairs, to act as agent for the state, to collect taxes, and\r\nenforce state laws.\r\n\r\nThe county owns many of the public buildings such as the court house\r\nand jail.\r\n\r\nEvery state is divided into counties, and every village, town or city\r\nis located in some county. As has been said there are one hundred and\r\ntwenty counties in the State of Kentucky. The county seat of a county\r\nis where the business of a county is transacted, and where the courts\r\nof importance are held. It is really the capital of the county.\r\n\r\nSome counties on account of size and population have two county seats.\r\nWhile county government differs in many states there is a uniformity\r\nin the organization of counties throughout the union.\r\n\r\nA county judge is elected in every county by the people. He presides\r\nover the county court which is held at the county seat.\r\n\r\nSome of the other officers of the county elected by the voters are:\r\nThe sheriff, county superintendent of schools, circuit clerk, clerk of\r\nthe county court, coroner, prosecuting attorney, county attorney, tax\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWN GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe government of a town is perhaps the nearest approach we have to a\r\ndirect government by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nTowns as well as counties not only look after their local interest but\r\nlook after state interest within their boundaries.\r\n\r\nA community of three hundred or more may upon petition of two-thirds\r\nof its inhabitants, be incorporated as a town.\r\n\r\nTowns as well as counties are organized and governed under general\r\nlaws passed by the legislature of its state.\r\n\r\nThe incorporated township has a right to hold property and make\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nCities like towns and counties receive their right of government\r\nthrough the state by a charter granted by the state legislature. The\r\ncharter is the fundamental law of the city.\r\n\r\nThe chief executive officer of a city is the mayor who is generally\r\nelected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe power of city government is vested in the mayor and the city\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nFor convenience a city is divided into subdivisions called wards, and\r\nfor elections into certain voting precincts called election districts.\r\n\r\nThe board of aldermen or council is composed of one person chosen from\r\neach ward by the voters. Their power is limited by the city charter.\r\n\r\nVoters are responsible for their government and much of our happiness\r\ndepends upon the way our city is managed.\r\n\r\nMany cities have adopted the commission form of government by electing\r\na non-partisan ticket composed of several commissioners. Each\r\ncommissioner is put in charge of a division of the city's\r\nadministration and held responsible for the work of his department.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of a city presides over the meetings of the council and\r\nsometimes vetos measures passed. He is elected by the voters. The\r\nchief duty of the mayor is to see that the laws and ordinances are\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nIn large cities there is a system of courts extending from the police\r\ncourt to the higher courts.\r\n\r\nAppeals from the courts of the city are taken to the circuit court and\r\nmay go from there to the Supreme Court of the State.\r\n\r\nCities are divided into six classes in Kentucky:\r\n\r\n    First class having a population of 100,000 or over.\r\n    Second class, 20,000 to 100,000.\r\n    Third class, 8,000 to 20,000.\r\n    Fourth class, 3,000 to 8,000.\r\n    Fifth class, 1,000 to 3,000.\r\n    Sixth class, below 1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPARTY ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference of opinion on national questions is the cause of a\r\nnumber of political parties in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs long as men and women think for themselves we shall have political\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIt is really the product of a government by public opinion. Without\r\npolitical organizations it would be almost impossible to govern the\r\npolicy and character of the country and control the affairs of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe political parties are the agents through which organizations are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAs a test of one's love of his country and its government is shown by\r\nhis work and aggressiveness.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen should study the ethics of his government, think for\r\nhimself, and form his own opinion.\r\n\r\nA person with no opinion on public affairs is a coward and\r\nunpatriotic.\r\n\r\nOur nation depends largely upon moral and cultured people who will\r\nstudy the issues of the day and express themselves in positive terms\r\non what they deem best for the nation and its government.\r\n\r\nOrganization is a number of people systematically united for some end.\r\nIt is through organization that political parties become effective.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties arose after the adoption of the Constitution. They\r\nare organized for national, state and local campaigns, and not\r\noriginally a part of the government, but as we grew and the population\r\nbecame greater there arose different political parties. Every\r\ndistrict, village, town and city has its permanent local campaign\r\ncommittees in elections, beside the state and national committees,\r\nwhich make a very complete organization.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the permanent committees is to keep the machinery of the\r\nparty working. Really the permanent committees do the hard work in\r\npolitics. They organize political clubs, solicit funds, issue calls\r\nfor conventions, urge people to register and vote and in many other\r\nways keep up the interest of the party.\r\n\r\nSince the adoption of the Constitution there have been two principal\r\nparties advocating different principles.\r\n\r\nThe first parties were known as the Federalist and anti-Federalist.\r\n\r\nThe two great dominant parties now in the United States--the\r\nDemocratic and Republican parties.\r\n\r\nOur Constitution did not provide us with laws as to the way of\r\nselecting candidates for office, but just as soon as political parties\r\ncame into existence, nominations followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party is the oldest. It goes back to the days of\r\nJefferson. It advocated \"state rights,\" limiting the power of national\r\ngovernment, tariff for revenue only. These were some of the issues\r\ndiscussed before the recent war, but other important issues in these\r\ndays of reconstruction have taken their place.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party was formed before the Civil War, when Abraham\r\nLincoln was elected President of the United States. It was originally\r\ncalled the Federalist party.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party remained in control of the national government\r\nuntil 1884 Grover Cleveland was elected for two terms, four years\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThis party originally advocated a high tariff.\r\n\r\nThe recent platforms of the two parties now in power will give the\r\nissues of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national committee of each party is formed of one member from each\r\nstate, who organizes the national convention of his party.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of this committee of each party calls a meeting of his\r\ncommittee in the spring before the presidential election and decides\r\nwhen and where they will hold the national convention.\r\n\r\nThis year the Democratic convention was held in San Francisco,\r\nbeginning on 28th of June.\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention was held in Chicago on the 8th of June.\r\n\r\nEach convention adopted its own party platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC.\r\n\r\nSTATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\nThe State Central Committee is the party organization in control of\r\nthe party in the State. It is composed of one man from each of the\r\neleven congressional districts elected by the people and a member at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FROM KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\nState at Large--George B.

The convention is called to order by the chairman of\r\nthe State Committee.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the State Central Committee reads the call of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nThe convention is opened with prayer.\r\n\r\nMotions are made that the chair appoint a committee on credentials, on\r\npermanent organization, and on resolutions.\r\n\r\nA temporary chairman and secretary are elected.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee on credentials is read, giving the number\r\nof delegates present, and rendering a decision concerning contested\r\ndelegations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee on organization is usually adopted at once\r\nand names the permanent officers of the convention, which include a\r\npermanent chairman, secretary, assistant secretaries, vice chairman\r\nand sergeant-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the convention is generally a prominent party leader,\r\nand when he takes his seat he delivers a speech upon the issues of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe platform is read by the chairman of the committee on resolutions\r\nand usually accepted without amendments. Then the convention takes up\r\nthe nomination of candidates. After the nominations are made the vote\r\nis then taken by call of the counties by the secretary. When the\r\ncandidates receive the number necessary to elect, generally a majority\r\nof all the votes cast, some one usually moves that his nomination be\r\nmade unanimous. They elect all the officers in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Convention is called to order about noon on the day\r\nappointed in the official call, by the chairman of the national\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe convention is opened with prayer.\r\n\r\nThe call is read, after which the national committee names a list of\r\ntemporary officers for the convention, temporary chairman, secretary,\r\nclerks, sergeant-at-arms and stenographers.\r\n\r\nThe temporary chairman takes the chair and makes a formal speech on\r\nthe political situation.\r\n\r\nA resolution is adopted making the rules of the preceding convention\r\nthe rules of the convention until otherwise ordered.\r\n\r\nMotions are made for the appointment of committees on credentials,\r\npermanent organization, rules and resolutions, each consisting of one\r\nmember from each state and territory.\r\n\r\nResolutions concerning contested seats are presented to the convention\r\nand referred without debate to the committee on credentials. (Every\r\nstate is allowed double as many delegates as it has Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in Congress. The four men corresponding to the\r\nrepresentation of the Senate are delegates at large, the others are\r\ndistrict delegates, which number twenty-two district delegates and\r\nfour delegates at large, making twenty-six delegates to the National\r\nConvention from Kentucky.)\r\n\r\nThis ends the first session of the convention.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention assembles for the second session, the first\r\nbusiness is the report of the credential committee.\r\n\r\nIn deciding contested seats, the committee on credentials gives each\r\nside a chance to present its claims, and then decides between them,\r\ngenerally in favor of the regular delegates, those endorsed by the\r\nstate and the district committee.\r\n\r\nTwo full contesting delegations from the same state, sometimes seats\r\nare given to both, each delegate being entitled to one-half vote.\r\n\r\nAfter the credential committee arrives at a decision concerning\r\ncontested seats, its report including a list arranged by the states of\r\nall delegates entitled to seats is usually accepted by the convention\r\nwith very little debate.\r\n\r\nThen the committee on organization make their report, which consists\r\nof a list of permanent officers of the convention--previously arranged\r\nto some extent by the national committee. (This report is usually\r\narranged beforehand and therefore adopted without much trouble, if\r\nany.) A committee is appointed to escort the permanent chairman to the\r\nplatform, who usually delivers a speech on the issues of the coming\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe chair calls for the committee on rules first, for their report.\r\n\r\nTwo rules of great importance in a Democratic Convention are: First--A\r\nrule requiring for the nomination of candidates two-thirds of the\r\nwhole number of votes in the convention. The Republican requires only\r\na majority.\r\n\r\nSecond Rule--The so-called unit rule under which a majority of each\r\nstate delegation is allowed to cast the entire vote to which the state\r\nis entitled even against the protest of a minority of the delegation.\r\nThese two rules are strictly adhered to in the Democratic party only.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting on the resolution committee's report, miscellaneous\r\nbusiness is disposed of, such as the election of national committees\r\nand of committees on notification. Such committees usually consist of\r\none delegate from each state and territory, the members being\r\ndesignated by the respective delegations.\r\n\r\nAbout the third day the resolution committee is ready to report the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nThis platform is a formal statement of the party's attitude upon the\r\npublic questions of the day; next to the nomination of candidates it\r\nis the most important work of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe platform of any party is usually adopted as read.\r\n\r\nNominations for candidates are next in order, and these begin with the\r\nroll call of the states arranged alphabetically for the presentation\r\nof candidates for the presidential nomination. Several candidates are\r\noften nominated. The delegation from any state when called in its\r\nturn may pass its right of nomination to any other delegation not yet\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nSome good and influential speaker will nominate the candidate from his\r\nstate, and it is usually seconded by a good speaker from some state\r\nthat has not a candidate.\r\n\r\nAfter roll call for nominations is completed the convention proceeds\r\nto the first ballot.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the delegation from his state when the state is called\r\nby the secretary of the convention, arises and announces the vote of\r\nhis state. Sometimes a candidate is nominated by acclamation, but\r\nusually many ballots are necessary to decide the contest.\r\n\r\nIf a candidate is not nominated on the first few ballots, a dark horse\r\nsometimes receives the nomination, but this is seldom the case.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a candidate receives the number of votes necessary to\r\nnominate, which is two-thirds of the delegates in a Democratic\r\nconvention and a majority in a Republican convention, usually some one\r\nmoves that the nomination be made unanimous, which is adopted with\r\ngreat applause.\r\n\r\nAfter the nomination for President is over the convention proceeds in\r\nthe same way to nominate a candidate for Vice President.\r\n\r\nAt the national convention of each party a new national committee is\r\nappointed to carry on the campaign and act until the next convention.\r\n\r\nThe platform adopted at the national convention of either party is an\r\nexpression of the principles of the party.\r\n\r\nSometimes a plank is put in to catch voters. On some questions the\r\nplank may not be plain, but may straddle the issues.\r\n\r\nThe national platform gives the principles to which the party is\r\ncommitted and its attitude on important public questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all cities where registration of the voters is required, men and\r\nwomen register on the same day in the ward or precinct in which they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of registration the polls open from 6 o'clock a. m. to\r\n9 o'clock p. m.\r\n\r\nThere are four election officers who have a book in which are\r\nregistered the names of all the legal voters in their precinct. Two of\r\nthese officers are called judges; one is a sheriff and the other is a\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\nA person desiring to register enters the voting place and announces\r\nhis or her intention to register. The judge takes the name, residence,\r\nparty affiliation and citizenship, and may also inquire as to any\r\nother matter that would affect his or her right to vote at an\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nIf found to be qualified, that is 21 years of age and a resident of\r\nthe state for one year, a resident of the county for six months, and a\r\nresident of the precinct for sixty days, they may register unless in a\r\nclass prohibited by law from exercising the right to vote.\r\n\r\nThe clerk then writes the name and address in the registration book\r\nentering also color and political affiliation. When this is done the\r\nregistration is completed, and the elector is qualified to exercise\r\nthe right of suffrage in all subsequent elections, special elections\r\nand primary elections for one year. The officers of the election give\r\nhim or her a certificate of registration signed by all four officers\r\nof the registration, and if they lose this certificate they cannot\r\nvote at the regular election unless they get a duplicate certificate\r\nfrom the county clerk, which costs 50 cents.\r\n\r\nIn the different class cities there are some differences as to the\r\nmethod and time of registering, but in Kentucky the general\r\nregistration is usually on the first Tuesday of October, in all cities\r\nand towns of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth classes. The\r\nhours for registration are from six o'clock a. m. to nine o'clock p.\r\nm.\r\n\r\nSpecial registrations are held thereafter as follows: One special\r\nregistration may be held by order of the city authorities, which will\r\nbe conducted exactly as the first registration above referred to, and\r\nduring the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next preceding the general\r\nelection day those persons who were absent or sick, or unable to\r\nattend and register on the regular registration days, may appear\r\nbefore the county court clerk at his office in the court house, and\r\nregister, to have the same effect as if the registration had taken\r\nplace in the manner above referred to, also on the day before the\r\nelection and on election day, public officers of the state, and the\r\nUnited States government, traveling salesmen and certain ministers of\r\nreligion may apply before the county court clerk in the court house\r\nand be registered if they will make oath that they were not present in\r\ntheir city or town during any of the previous registration days.\r\nPersons that have become eligible to vote at the general primary\r\nelection, which occurs on the first Saturday in August may register\r\ntwo weeks before the election in the county court clerk's office as\r\nabove described, provided such persons were not in the city on any of\r\nthe previous regular registration days, or who were not then qualified\r\nto register and may vote in the primary election in the same manner as\r\nother qualified electors.\r\n\r\nThe primary election is conducted in the same manner as any other\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nWhen you register the clerk gives you a certificate of registration,\r\nwhich you keep to show the election officers when you go to vote, that\r\nyou have registered.\r\n\r\nPersons living in the country and small towns do not have to register.\r\n\r\n    Name of voter __________________  Consecutive number _____________\r\n\r\n    Residence     __________________\r\n\r\n                              UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: Rooster]         [Illustration: Log cabin]\r\n\r\n                  -----                            -----\r\n                 /     \\                          /     \\\r\n                 |     |                          |     |\r\n                 \\     /                          \\     /\r\n                  -----                            -----\r\n\r\n            DEMOCRATIC PARTY                  REPUBLICAN PARTY\r\n\r\n    For Presidential Electors        For Presidential Electors\r\n\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n    _________________________ |  |   _________________________ |  |\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n    _________________________ |  |   _________________________ |  |\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n\r\n    For Vice-Presidential Electors   For Vice-Presidential Electors\r\n\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n    _________________________ |  |   _________________________ |  |\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n    _________________________ |  |   _________________________ |  |\r\n                              +--+                             +--+\r\n\r\nThe names of all candidates are arranged in columns, under the party\r\ndevice to which they belong. A voter by putting a cross mark in the\r\ncircle under the rooster votes for all the Democratic nominees of his\r\nparty. In the circle under the log cabin votes for the Republican\r\nnominees of his party.\r\n\r\nThis does not require a knowledge to even read, only to be able to\r\ndistinguish between the pictures of a rooster and a log cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMINATIONS--PRIMARIES.\r\n\r\nCandidates in the United States are usually nominated either in a\r\nparty primary or a nominating convention.\r\n\r\nPrimaries are conducted like elections. The name of the party running\r\nfor an office is put on the ballot of his party with the names of\r\nothers who have filed similar petitions. On the day set for the\r\nprimary the voters go to the polls and cast their vote as at a general\r\nelection. The candidate who receives the largest number of votes is\r\nthe nominee of the party for that office.\r\n\r\nPrimaries cost more than conventions--they are like elections--you\r\nhave to advertise extensively and meet the voters. In a few months the\r\nelection follows and you practically go over the same.\r\n\r\nOnly the voters who can vote in the party primary are those who\r\nregistered for the previous election as members of that party.\r\n\r\nCertificates and petitions of nomination must be filed with the\r\nSecretary of State not more than seventy-five days and not less than\r\nforty-five days, before the day fixed by law for the election of the\r\npersons in nomination, also certificates and petitions are directed to\r\nbe filed with the clerk of the county court not more than seventy-five\r\nand not less than forty-five days before the election.\r\n\r\nThe primary elections are conducted in the same manner as any other\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe two methods of making nominations are by a caucus or convention\r\nsystem, and the primary election system.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for a voter at a primary are the same as election.\r\nOn the first Saturday in August each year from 6 o'clock a. m. to 4\r\no'clock p. m. there shall be held at the regular polling places in\r\neach election precinct a primary election for the nomination of\r\ncandidates for office by political parties, to be voted for at the\r\nnext November election. You do not register to vote in the primary,\r\nand a citizen not of age at the time of the primary, but will be\r\ntwenty-one before the November election can vote in the primary.\r\n\r\nPrimaries are conducted similar to elections--about same laws and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTIONS.\r\n\r\nAfter all the political parties have nominated their candidates then\r\nthe struggle for election begins.\r\n\r\nThe period of a few months between the nominations and elections is\r\nspent by each party in trying to get votes for its candidate.\r\n\r\nEvery voter must be twenty-one years old, a resident of the state for\r\none year, of the county six months, and of the precinct sixty days.\r\n\r\nOn election day the voter goes to the polling place and appears before\r\nthe election officers, who will probably be the same ones who presided\r\nat the registration. You give your name and residence, and if you live\r\nin a city where registration is required you must produce your\r\nregistration certificate and one of the judges may consult the\r\nregistration book to see if you have registered. If found to be\r\nregistered, the clerk will write your name and address upon the stub\r\nof the ballot book and endorse his own name on the back of the ballot,\r\nand remove the ballot from the book leaving the stub (called the\r\nprimary stub) in the book.\r\n\r\nThe voter will go into a voting booth with the ballot folded, then\r\nunfold the ballot, take the stencil, press it on the ink pad and if\r\nyou desire to vote a straight party ticket place the stencil mark in\r\nthe circle immediately underneath the device of the party whose\r\ncandidates you desire to vote for. If you desire to vote for\r\ncandidates irrespective of any party affiliation you will place the\r\nstencil mark in the small square immediately following the name of\r\neach candidate for whom you desire to vote.\r\n\r\nWhen the ballot is thus completed you lay the stencil aside, fold the\r\nballot in exactly the same manner as when you received it from the\r\nclerk and then return it to the judge of the election, who removes the\r\nsecondary stub from the ballot and deposits the ballot itself in the\r\nballot box. If any voter spoils or defaces a ballot by mistake so that\r\nit cannot be used he may return it, and get another, and the fact\r\nnoted by the clerk by writing the word \"spoiled\" on the stub and\r\nspoiled ballot.\r\n\r\nNo person except the election officers shall remain within fifty feet\r\nof the polls, except when voting.\r\n\r\nIt shall be the duty of the sheriff in each county before an election\r\nto secure in each precinct of the county a suitable room in which to\r\nhold the election, and have sufficient booths in which electors shall\r\nmark their ballots, screened from observation.\r\n\r\nOur laws concerning elections are more stringent in the past few\r\nyears. Every precaution is taken to insure honesty of elections.\r\n\r\nNo officer of election shall do any electioneering on election day.\r\n\r\nIn all elections in Kentucky the voting shall be by ballot.\r\n\r\nThe ballot boxes are opened and inspected before voting begins to see\r\nthat they are empty.\r\n\r\nElectioneering is forbidden within one hundred feet of the polls.\r\n\r\nTwice as many official ballots are provided for every polling place as\r\nthere are registered voters in the district.\r\n\r\nIf a person is illiterate he is allowed assistance in marking his\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nAn inspector may challenge a person's vote, but if they swear they are\r\neligible their vote is recorded and marked challenged.\r\n\r\nA person cannot vote who is not naturalized for at least ninety days\r\nbefore election. Also a person convicted of bribery or an infamous\r\ncrime, a deserter from the army or navy, and one who bets on that\r\nelection cannot vote.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of the State may restore one to citizenship so that they\r\ncan vote.\r\n\r\nIn registration polls are opened from 6 a. m. to 9 p. m., but in\r\nelection polls are opened from 6 a. m. to 4 p. m.\r\n\r\nWhen the polls are closed the ballots are counted by the election\r\nofficers and announced and placed in ballot box, which is locked by\r\nofficers, who then take the ballot box, poll books, certificates,\r\netc., to the county clerk who unlocks the box in the presence of the\r\nelection officers to see if the packages containing the ballots are\r\nproperly sealed, and if so, the county clerk issues his receipt for\r\nthe box and ballots--one to the judge, and one to the sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe county clerk within a certain time sends the ballots to a\r\ncanvassing board which examines them and makes an official\r\nannouncement of the number of votes cast for each candidate, and gives\r\nthem a certificate of their election. The successful candidates are\r\nnotified and later installed into office.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDMENTS TO CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nAmendments to the Constitution are handled in the same way as an\r\nelection. The ballot contains the amendment proposed with \"Yes\" or\r\n\"No\" printed at the side. The party voting crosses out one of these\r\nwords, puts the ballot in the blank envelope and returns it as in an\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOTING BY MAIL.\r\n\r\nVoting by mail is often a great convenience.\r\n\r\nThe world is becoming more democratic and the right to vote for\r\nrepresentation is now arranged so that all eligible citizens of the\r\nUnited States, twenty-one and over, may have a part in governing his\r\nor her country.\r\n\r\nIf a voter is out of the state or county and holds his residence in\r\nthe same place as when he voted last--or calls home--he or she can\r\nvote by mail. He must first register, which is also done by mail.\r\n\r\nA printed ballot with return envelope is sent to him. The ballot is\r\nmarked by placing a cross opposite the name of the candidate voted\r\nfor, then put in a blank envelope, sealed and enclosed in an envelope\r\naddressed to the secretary or clerk of the county or chairman of the\r\ntellers.\r\n\r\nThis envelope must be signed by the one voting. The blank envelope\r\ncontaining the ballot is opened and the ballot deposited in the ballot\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nThe one voting must take an oath before a notary public that he or she\r\nis eligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nWhen the voters go to the polls on election day to vote for President\r\nand Vice President every four years on the first Tuesday after the\r\nfirst Monday in November they really cast their ballots for the\r\nelectors who were nominated at the state convention. The names of the\r\nstate electors of each party are printed on the ballots under the\r\nparty name. The ones receiving the most votes are elected, and are\r\nmorally bound to vote for the candidate of the party that elected\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe campaign continues until the election on the first Tuesday after\r\nthe first Monday in November. The electors elected in November meet at\r\ntheir state capital in January and vote for President and Vice\r\nPresident. The result of this vote is dispatched at once to the\r\nPresident of the Senate at Washington, D. C. The electors of the\r\ndifferent states meet at Washington on the morning of the second\r\nMonday in January after their election, and give their vote at or\r\nafter twelve o'clock according to law.\r\n\r\nOn the second Wednesday in February succeeding the meeting of the\r\nelectors, the Senate and House of Representatives meet in the Hall of\r\nRepresentatives at 1 o'clock p. m. with the President of the Senate\r\npresiding.\r\n\r\nTwo tellers are appointed in each House to whom shall be handed, as\r\nthey are opened by the President of the Senate, all the certificates\r\nand papers purporting to be certificates of the ---- electoral voters,\r\nwhich certificates and papers shall be opened, presented and acted\r\nupon in alphabetical order of the states; said tellers having then\r\nread the same in the presence and hearing of the two Houses, shall\r\nmake a list of the voters as they shall appear from the said\r\ncertificates, and the votes having been ascertained and counted,\r\naccording to law; the result of the same shall be delivered to the\r\nPresident of the Senate, who shall announce the result of the vote,\r\nwhich announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the\r\npersons elected President and Vice President of the United States, and\r\ntogether with the list of voters be entered on the journals of the two\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\nIf no one receives a majority of all the electoral votes the\r\nConstitution provides that the House of Representatives shall choose a\r\nPresident and the Senate a Vice President. (Article XII, National\r\nConstitution.)\r\n\r\nThe President and Vice President are inaugurated on March 4th\r\nsucceeding the election.\r\n\r\nThey take the oath of office on a platform on the east front of the\r\nCapitol. The President delivers an address outlining his policies,\r\nthen returns to the White House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTAXATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national government is supported by taxation in various ways, and\r\nit requires a great amount of money to carry on the business of our\r\ncountry even in times of peace--over $2,000,000,000. This money is\r\nraised through a system of taxation of two kinds--direct and indirect.\r\n\r\nA direct tax is a tax on real property or a poll tax.\r\n\r\nAn indirect tax is a tax on one individual, but is indirectly paid by\r\nanother. (Taxes assessed on merchandise are indirect, as the consumer\r\npays them.)\r\n\r\nMost of the money is raised by import duties and excise taxes.\r\n\r\nImport duties are taxes on imported goods.\r\n\r\nExcise tax is a tax levied on goods manufactured in this country.\r\n\r\nDuties are taxes on goods imported from foreign countries. The\r\nconsumer on imported goods indirectly pays the duty assessed by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of duties--specific and ad valorem.\r\n\r\nSpecific duties are fixed amounts levied on certain commodities as the\r\nyard, pound and gallon.\r\n\r\nAd valorem duties are levied at a certain rate per cent on the value\r\nof the articles taxed.\r\n\r\nDuties are leviable on either imports or exports.\r\n\r\nImports relate only to goods brought into the country from abroad.\r\n\r\nExports relate to goods sent out of a country.\r\n\r\nThere is a special system for the collection of import duties, by\r\nnaming many places along the coast to be used as \"ports of entry,\"\r\nwhere custom houses in charge of collectors have been established.\r\n\"Each custom house has a collector and the government has employed a\r\nlarge force of officers and special agents to overtake any\r\ndishonesty--attempting to smuggle goods through without paying duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe state legislature levies the state tax, the city council the city\r\ntax, and the taxes to keep up the national government are levied by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe law making power of Congress and state legislatures not only have\r\nthe power of passing laws, raising money by taxation, but also the\r\nright and power of saying how that money shall be spent.\r\n\r\nThere are several kind of taxes collected for the benefit of the\r\ncounty, town, city and state, viz.: Poll tax, income, inheritance,\r\nfranchise, property.\r\n\r\nPoll tax: This is a tax on the person and not on property. A male\r\ncitizen twenty-one and over must pay a poll tax of $1.00 even if he\r\nhas no property. He must pay this tax before he can vote. In Kentucky\r\nthe poll tax is one dollar.\r\n\r\nIncome Tax: There is an income tax levied on the income one receives\r\nand not on the amount of property he has. It is levied on salaries or\r\nprofits upon business. Unmarried persons with an income of over\r\n$1,000.00 and married persons with an income of over $2,000.00 must\r\npay an income tax.\r\n\r\nInheritance Tax: Many states have an inheritance tax levied on\r\nproperty inherited. This tax is really designated to reach wealthy\r\npeople, and is easily collected since probate court records state the\r\namounts. Kentucky has an inheritance tax, drawn and introduced by L.\r\nF. Johnson, of Frankfort, in 1906.\r\n\r\nFranchise Tax: The government or state gives to a person or\r\ncorporation special privileges, the rights to use the streets of a\r\ncity for railway, water, lighting, gas plants, etc., is considered\r\nvaluable property in the right vested in them by their franchise. This\r\nis really a source of income and should be taxed.\r\n\r\nProperty Tax: Property owners pay a large part of the money raised by\r\ntaxation. Personal property which includes bonds, stocks, mortgages,\r\nhousehold goods, jewels, etc.\r\n\r\nReal estate which includes houses, lots, lands and building.\r\n\r\nWhile taxes are levied upon real estate there are some kinds of\r\nproperty exempt from taxation, viz.: public institutions and\r\nlibraries, cemeteries, school houses, churches, and other public\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nA great amount of revenue is derived by state and local governments\r\nfrom licenses, fees and special assessments. Men and women engaged in\r\ncertain kinds of business must pay to the national, state and local\r\ngovernments a license or fees, as merchants, peddlers, manufacturers,\r\npawnbrokers, etc.\r\n\r\nA fee is a sum paid to an officer of the government, state, city or\r\ncounty for performing some public service or for a license in\r\nbusiness. If you wanted to get a deed to land recorded you would have\r\nto pay the officer a fee.\r\n\r\nThe expense of our government is enormous, but the paying of taxes is\r\none way in which all must take part.\r\n\r\n\r\nACQUISITION OF NEW TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nWhile the acquisition of new territory has increased the expenses of\r\nour nation, yet it has made us the greatest nation in the world.\r\n\r\nWe have expanded by acquisition of new possessions which Congress\r\norganized under the direct control of the \"Federal Government,\" but\r\ngiving them limited powers of self government, through legislation of\r\ntheir own. When their population is sufficient they will be admitted\r\nas states.\r\n\r\nToday our national flag contains forty-eight stars, and no part of the\r\nUnited States except Alaska and Hawaii remains under a territorial\r\nform of government.\r\n\r\nAlaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, appoints the governor and judges of the courts.\r\n\r\nThey have a legislature composed of two houses whose members are\r\nelected by the people. A delegate to Congress with the right to take\r\npart in debates but not to vote is also elected by the people.\r\n\r\nHawaii: Hawaii is a regularly organized territory and is governed like\r\nAlaska; President appointing the governor with the consent of the\r\nSenate, etc.\r\n\r\nPossessions: The Philippines, Porto Rico, and other islands are\r\npossessions rather than territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nPhilippines: The Governor General and eight commissioners appointed by\r\nthe President with the advice and consent of the Senate are at the\r\nhead of the general government of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\"Five members of the commission are heads of the executive departments\r\nas well as having legislative powers. The other four members have only\r\nlegislative power.\"\r\n\r\nCommission: The nine members of the commission appointed by the\r\nPresident constitute the Upper House of the Legislature known as the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nLower House: The members of the Lower House of Representatives are\r\nelected by the people of the various civilized districts.\r\n\r\nThe nine commissioners represent the legislative body and have control\r\nof that part of the island not civilized.\r\n\r\nCourts: They have a system of courts in which the judges of the\r\nSupreme Court are appointed by the President, and the judges of the\r\nlower courts are appointed by the Governor General with the approval\r\nof the commission.\r\n\r\nCommissioners: There are two resident commissioners sent to the\r\nUnited States from the Philippines with seats in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, but cannot vote, only taking part in the debates.\r\n\r\nProvinces: The islands are divided into provinces \"each of which is\r\ngoverned by a provincial board of three members, and each province has\r\nits own city or town with its local government.\" Two of the members of\r\nthe boards are elected by the people, and the third, who is the\r\ntreasurer, is appointed by the Governor General, but usually a\r\n\"Filipino.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO.\r\n\r\nUnder President Wilson's administration \"The new organic law granted\r\nthe people of Porto Rico a greater self government than they had ever\r\nenjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nThey have a Governor appointed by the President, a legislature of two\r\nHouses elected by the people, and a system of courts.\r\n\r\n\"There are seventy-six cities and towns which enjoy some local\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThey send as their representative to Congress, a resident\r\ncommissioner. While these new possessions are expensive they add great\r\nwealth and power to our nation.\r\n\r\nTaxes are contributions that the people are required by the government\r\nto pay in order to meet the expenses of our nation.\r\n\r\nWe are not patriotic unless we respond to the call of our government.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENDUM AND INITIATIVE.\r\n\r\nSome states have the referendum and initiative power of helping to\r\nmake laws.\r\n\r\nIf a state legislature passes a law that the people do not approve of\r\na petition may be signed by a certain number of voters which will\r\nrequire the law to be referred to the people for their approval or\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nReferendum means referring a law passed by the legislature back to the\r\nvoters for their approval or disapproval.\r\n\r\n\"If five per cent of the voters of a state and two-thirds of the\r\ncongressional districts do not approve of a bill passed by the General\r\nAssembly they sign a petition and file it with the Secretary of State\r\nin ninety days after the General Assembly adjourns.\" The question\r\ninvolved is then submitted to the voters at the next election for\r\ntheir approval or disapproval.\r\n\r\nThe initiative is the right of the voters to start legislation. The\r\nobject of the initiative and the referendum is to compel legislative\r\nbodies to act and respect the will of the people whom they represent.\r\n\r\nThe initiative petition must be filed four months before the regular\r\nelection with the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia, including Washington, the Capital of the\r\nUnited States, is governed by Congress and by judicial and executive\r\nofficers appointed by the President of the United States. The people\r\nhave no power of self government.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution gives Congress the exclusive right of government in\r\nthe District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIt is governed by three commissioners appointed by the President. One\r\nmust be an officer of the army and the other two appointed from civil\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nCongress keeps a watch over the District, and devotes certain days to\r\nconsidering the business of the District.\r\n\r\nThe courts of the district are Court of Appeals, Supreme Court, police\r\ncourt, justices of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe judicial officers are appointed by the President.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia has no representative in Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANAMA CANAL ZONE.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal Zone is under the control of a governor who is\r\nappointed by the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"It is neutral and open to vessels of commerce and war of all nations,\r\nbut war vessels must pass through without delay and while in the canal\r\ncannot load or unload troops or munitions of war.\"\r\n\r\nThe cost of the construction of the canal was about $400,000,000. It\r\nshortens the voyage from New York to San Francisco 8,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUAM AND SAMOAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThese islands are naval stations and are governed by the naval\r\nofficers stationed there.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE.\r\n\r\nCommerce is divided between the state and Federal governments. We have\r\ninterstate commerce, foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.\r\nCongress regulates commerce.\r\n\r\nInterstate commerce is carried on in the United States, as when goods\r\nare shipped from one state to another, or one place in a state to\r\nanother, either by land or water. The Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nprovided for by Congress is composed of nine men appointed by the\r\nPresident, and regulates interstate commerce. The members of this\r\ncommission receive a salary of $10,000.00 annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nForeign commerce is commerce carried on with foreign countries.\r\nCertain regulations are prescribed for vessels engaged in foreign\r\ncommerce, \"Enter\" and \"Clear\" ports.\r\n\r\nAll vessels registered in the United States are protected by the\r\ngovernment in any part of the world. Only vessels can be registered by\r\na citizen of the United States. No foreign vessel can register.\r\n\r\nCongress regulates commerce with foreign nations and among the states,\r\nand Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN TRIBES.\r\n\r\nThe government looks after the interest of \"Indian affairs.\" There are\r\nabout 300,000 Indians on 150 reservations in different states and\r\nterritories all under the protection of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PARKS.\r\n\r\nThe national government has set aside several large tracts of land for\r\nNational Parks. The Yellowstone National Park is about half as large\r\nas Massachusetts and is the most beautiful and interesting park in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nVOTER'S DUTY AS A CITIZEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo vote is an expression of choice for this man or woman for an\r\noffice. The ballot is the only efficient way to express public opinion\r\nand should be regarded as a sacred trust.\r\n\r\nEvery person in the state is either a citizen or alien.\r\n\r\n\"An alien is a person born in a foreign country who lives here, but is\r\nstill a subject of some other country.\"\r\n\r\nAn alien may become a citizen of the United States after he has lived\r\nin this country for five years and in the state one year. He must be\r\nable to read and write his name, to speak English and be of moral\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOnly white persons and negroes may become naturalized.\r\n\r\n\"Chinese, Japanese and East Indians cannot become citizens unless born\r\nin the United States.\"\r\n\r\nUnmarried women can become citizens like the men.\r\n\r\nA married woman is a citizen if her husband is a citizen. She cannot\r\nbecome naturalized by herself. A woman born in the United States who\r\nmarries an alien ceases to be an American citizen and becomes a\r\nsubject of the country to which her husband belongs.\r\n\r\nThe wife of a man not a citizen of the United States cannot vote in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nIf a resident of the United States she resumes her citizenship at the\r\ndeath of her husband, or if she is divorced.\r\n\r\nA foreign born woman who marries a citizen becomes a citizen.\r\n\r\nAn American born may live abroad for many years and not lose his or\r\nher citizenship.\r\n\r\nAn alien enjoys the same protection of the law as does the citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZEN.\r\n\r\nA citizen is a person born in the United States and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof.\r\n\r\nWe are living in a democratic government which is a priceless heritage\r\nand a great blessing to mankind.\r\n\r\nDemocracy demands a sense of responsibility, personal interest in the\r\naffairs of government and respect for human rights.\r\n\r\nAs citizens we must become more conscious and appreciative of the\r\ninheritance our forefathers left us. This great inheritance is a\r\nwonderful land of opportunity and freedom.\r\n\r\nTo be an intelligent and desirable citizen we must have a knowledge of\r\nour Constitution, and know by whom and how our country is governed.\r\n\r\nThe man or woman who does not possess some knowledge of how the\r\ncountry is governed--as has been said--may easily become a prey of\r\npersons who are anxious to advance their own interests at the expense\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe things needed for the use and protection of the people are\r\nprovided by the people through their government.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the community you enjoy the good roads, streets, schools,\r\nlibraries and many other things; therefore, you have no right to shirk\r\nyour duty in not helping to maintain your government. If we enjoy the\r\ngood things in this life without doing our part to have them we are\r\ncowards.\r\n\r\nTo live in a country and enjoy its freedom, peace and comforts and not\r\ndo our part toward maintaining such peace and comforts we have failed\r\nto do our duty toward our fellowman and government, and may be called\r\na sponger, a coward and a shirker if we fail to vote and do our part\r\ntoward maintaining our government.\r\n\r\nIt is not only our duty to vote but we should study and understand\r\npublic questions so that we can vote intelligently on the issues of\r\nthe day. We should be interested in the ballot for it is one way in\r\nwhich public opinion may be expressed.\r\n\r\nEvery man or woman under the protection of our government should feel\r\nobligated to give his or her best to make our government one of high\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nPlato said: \"Only that state is healthy and can thrive which\r\nunceasingly endeavors to help the individuals who constitute it.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States is both a democracy and a republic.\r\n\r\nA democracy means a government by the people.\r\n\r\nA republic is a democracy in which the people elect representatives to\r\ncarry on the government for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe United States is a great republic composed of more than\r\n100,000,000 citizens under the protection of one flag with forty-eight\r\nstars which represent the forty-eight states of the union.\r\n\r\n\"A citizen might be termed a member of a large society called the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man, woman and child is a member of this society, unless an\r\nalien, an idiot, or convicted of some infamous crime.\r\n\r\nThe members of this great society when they reach the age of\r\ntwenty-one have a duty to perform which should be a sacred one. In\r\nthis society citizenship is defined in the national Constitution in\r\nthe fourteenth amendment. \"All persons born or naturalized in the\r\nUnited States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of\r\nthe United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the first duties of a citizen is to vote. If we fail to vote we\r\nhave no right to complain of the condition of affairs, and how our\r\ngovernment is managed.\r\n\r\nIt is a privilege to be a citizen of this great country and a member\r\nof this great \"society called the United States.\" It should be a\r\ngreater privilege to cast our vote in every election and know we are\r\ndoing our part to keep up the government.\r\n\r\nThere are four ways which we, as citizens, can help maintain our\r\ngovernment:\r\n\r\n\"First: Vote at every election, read and be interested in public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\"Second: Help to manage public affairs and be ready to hold an office,\r\nif you are the choice of the people.\r\n\r\n\"Third: Try to understand public questions, so you can vote\r\nintelligently and criticize justly.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth: Remember to pay your share of the expense of doing the work.\"\r\n\r\nThere are now over 27,011,330 voting women in the United States, soon\r\nto take part in all elections, and share the responsibility as well as\r\nthe privilege of suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn maintaining this great government of ours two parties are necessary\r\nto keep the wheels moving. As has been said, the two dominant parties\r\nnow in existence are the Democratic party and Republican party.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that parties are means of securing united action among\r\nthe voters who think alike. It was Washington who said: \"The spirit of\r\nparty unfortunately is inseparable from our nature, having its root in\r\nthe strongest passions of the human mind.\"\r\n\r\nThere must be organization under the direction of leaders to secure\r\nunited action.\r\n\r\nLet the women of our country come forward and identify themselves with\r\nthe party of their choice and organize under competent leaders,\r\nshowing to the world we not only deem it a great privilege to vote,\r\nbut are willing to share the responsibility of making our government\r\nthe best in the world.\r\n\r\nWill you do your bit to keep this great machinery moving onward and\r\nupward?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD WOMEN VOTE?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important that every woman who possesses the constitutional and\r\nstatutory qualifications should exercise her right to vote; because it\r\nis only in this way that there can be a fair expression of the\r\npolitical sentiment of the qualified voters on any question.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that the right to vote is not only a privilege but a\r\nduty that is imposed by law, and where one is entitled to exercise\r\nthat privilege, the failure to so exercise it is a failure to perform\r\na duty on the part of the voter.\r\n\r\nThen, if only a small per cent of the women were to vote, and a large\r\nper cent of the men were to vote, it would always be problematical as\r\nto what effect the consensus of the women's opinion would have had in\r\nthe result, if a full vote had been polled; and this questionable\r\nresult of an election is one of the dangers incident to the exercise\r\nof the right of suffrage. If the women manifest anything approaching a\r\nunanimous desire to participate in the exercise of this governmental\r\nfunction, it will have the effect to increase the public confidence in\r\nthis government and its institutions.\r\n\r\nMen and women without regard to race, color or social condition, must\r\ntake their turn exactly alike at the polling place. Each ballot has\r\nexactly the same weight in the election, and the ballot of the poorest\r\nman counts just as much as the ballot of the most influential citizen.\r\nThe voting place is the leveling place, and when women realize that\r\nthe exercise of suffrage gives not only the equal right to vote, but\r\nalso allows equal expression of opinion, then the better purpose of\r\nwoman suffrage will have been accomplished. This equality is not a\r\ncondescension on the part of women, but it is the exercise of a right\r\nunder the law, to call for the fair expression of opinion from all\r\nthe people of every social and political standard, without reference\r\nto mental ability, social standing or business prominence. Therefore,\r\nit is the duty of every intelligent woman to vote and use her\r\ninfluence to get the women interested in voting and doing their part\r\nin keeping up the government. We know that the lower classes will all\r\nvote and many floaters will be found in such classes, so it behooves\r\nthe intelligent women to do their part. The vote is the equal right of\r\nevery one who is qualified under the law, and every qualified person\r\nhas one vote, and that one vote from each one is the thing which the\r\nConstitution is most zealous to secure and safeguard.\r\n\r\nWe appeal to every intelligent woman of the United States and\r\nespecially in Kentucky to take part in the coming campaign. Organize\r\nunder competent leaders and let your organization extend into every\r\nprecinct. See that the voters register on the first Tuesday in\r\nOctober, or the special registration days, then on 2nd day of November\r\ngo to the polls and vote for President and Vice President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWomen as well as men in Kentucky can vote for President and Vice\r\nPresident if twenty-one years old and over, unless an alien, idiot or\r\nhave committed some infamous crime. We have suffrage so far, whether\r\nwe want it or not, and let us, as intelligent women, not forget the\r\nduty it carries with it. We love our government and the good things it\r\ngives, as schools, good roads, protection of life and property and the\r\nmany other things. Should we not be willing to do our part to get\r\nthese things, or must we be a sponger, a coward, or shirker and let\r\nour fellow man do all? Should we fail to vote and help maintain our\r\ngovernment we certainly will come under one of these heads, that is if\r\nwe are able to go to the polls and register and vote, and fail to do\r\nit. If you are absent from the county or state you can vote by mail.\r\nThere is no way to escape our duty unless providentially hindered.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky there are 1,201,185 voters, of which 663,454 are men and\r\n537,731 are women.
