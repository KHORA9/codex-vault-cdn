I had often before\r\nbeen in the great city, but had never occupied any official position\r\nthere. Now, however, having been appointed secretary to our (Russian)\r\nembassy, I consequently enjoyed special privileges, not the least being\r\nopportunity to watch quite closely the actors in what was to prove one\r\nof the greatest dramas of modern history. I had many acquaintances in\r\nParis, but these belonged principally to the circle known still by the\r\nname of Faubourg St. Germain, for I had never frequented the\r\nImperialistic world. Consequently I found myself thrown in quite a\r\ndifferent _milieu_, and had to forgo a great many of my former friends,\r\nwho would not have cared to receive in their houses one who now belonged\r\nto the intimate coterie of the Tuileries. In a certain sense I felt\r\nsorry; but on the other hand I discovered that the society in which I\r\nnow found myself was far more pleasant, and certainly far more amusing,\r\nthan my former circle. To a young man such as I was at that time, this\r\nlast consideration, of course, was most attractive.\r\n\r\nParis, during that autumn of the year 1868, was extremely congenial;\r\nindeed, it has never been so brilliant since the Napoleonic Eagle\r\ndisappeared. The Sovereigns liked to surround themselves with nice\r\npeople, and sought popularity among the different classes of society;\r\nthey gave splendid receptions, and did their best to create around them\r\nan atmosphere of luxury and enjoyment. They frequented the many theatres\r\nfor which Paris was famed, were present at the races, and in general\r\nshowed themselves wherever they found opportunity to appear in public.\r\nDuring the summer and autumn months the Imperial hospitality was\r\nexercised with profusion and generosity, either at Compiègne or at\r\nFontainebleau, and it was only at St. Cloud or at Biarritz that the\r\nEmperor and his lovely Consort led a relatively retired life, while they\r\nenjoyed a short and well-earned holiday.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in such cases, the Imperialistic society followed the lead\r\ngiven to it from above, and pleasure followed upon pleasure, festivity\r\ncrowded upon festivity during these feverish months which preceded the\r\nFranco-Prussian War. In 1868 the clouds that had obscured the Imperial\r\nsky at the time of the ill-fated Mexican Expedition had passed away, and\r\nthe splendours which attended the inauguration of the Suez Canal were\r\nalready looming on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe political situation as yet seemed untroubled; indeed, though the\r\nEmperor sometimes appeared sad and anxious, no one among all those who\r\nsurrounded him shared the apprehensions which his keen political glance\r\nhad already foreseen as inevitable. The Empress, too, appeared as if she\r\nwanted to make the most of her already disappearing youth, and to gather\r\nher roses whilst she still could do so, with all the buoyancy of her\r\ndeparted girlish days.\r\n\r\nThe leading spirit of all the entertainments given at the Tuileries, the\r\nPrincess Pauline Metternich, was always alert for some new form of\r\namusement wherewith to enliven the house parties of Compiègne, or the\r\nsolemnity of the evening parties given in the old home of the Kings of\r\nFrance--that home from which Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette had gone to\r\nthe scaffold, and to which their memory clung in spite of all those who\r\nhad inhabited it since the day they started upon their tragic journey to\r\nVarennes.\r\n\r\nThe fair Eugénie had a special reverence for the memory of the beautiful\r\nAustrian Archduchess whose destiny it had been to die by the hand of the\r\nexecutioner within a few steps of the grand old palace that had been\r\nhers. With all the impressionability of her Spanish nature she used to\r\nsay that she was sure a like fate awaited her, and so prepared herself\r\nto die as had died the unfortunate Princess whose place she had taken.\r\nEugénie often spoke of what she would do when that day should come, and\r\nsometimes amused her friends with her conviction that she, too, was\r\ndestined to endure tragic misfortunes and calamities. Her presentiments\r\nwere fulfilled; but, alas! she did not bear them with true dignity.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I am speaking--October, 1868--Napoleon III. had\r\njust completed his sixtieth year. In spite of the agonies occasioned by\r\nthe painful disease from which he was suffering, he retained his good\r\nlooks, and notwithstanding his small height and the largeness of his\r\nhead, which, compared with the size of his body, would have been\r\nridiculous in any other person, he presented a most dignified\r\nappearance, and bore himself like a Sovereign born to the purple would\r\nhave done. When he chose, the expression of his face was charming, and\r\nthe eyes, which he always kept half closed, had a dreamy, far-away,\r\nmysterious look that gave them a peculiar charm. He spoke slowly, as if\r\ncarefully weighing every word he uttered; but what surprised one when\r\ntalking with him for the first time was a German accent in speaking\r\nFrench--a habit retained from his early days spent in Switzerland--from\r\nwhich he could not rid himself, in spite of all his efforts, as well as\r\nthose of M. Mocquard, his faithful secretary and friend, who, so long as\r\nhe lived, gave him lessons in elocution. I believe that the slowness\r\nwith which Napoleon III. expressed himself must be attributed to that\r\ncircumstance more than anything else. But it is a fact that sometimes it\r\nhad the effect of irritating those with whom he was engaged in\r\nconversation; they never knew what he was going to say next, and\r\nofttimes gathered the impression that some ulterior motive actuated his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nWith ladies the Emperor was always charming, and his manner with them\r\nhad a tinge of chivalry that savoured of olden times, and generally\r\nsucceeded in winning for him all that he wanted. His love intrigues were\r\nnumerous, and his wife was not always wrong when she complained, though\r\nnot improbably she would have done better to notice and talk of them\r\nless than she did. In general the Empress was much too fond of\r\ncommunicating her feelings and impressions to those whom she considered\r\nher friends without the slightest reason for thinking them to be such.\r\nHer many intimacies with ladies who bore her no real sympathy, such as\r\nPrincess Metternich, for instance, did her much harm and caused her many\r\nannoyances which she could well have avoided had she shown herself more\r\ncareful in what she did or said. She never realised that community in\r\namusement does not constitute community of feelings, and that whilst one\r\nmay like the society of some people because one enjoys their good\r\ndinners, or spends one’s time pleasantly in their company, it does not\r\nmean that one really cares for them, or trusts them.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. had been a very clever politician. I use the words “had\r\nbeen” intentionally, because, unhappily, it is certain that toward the\r\nend of his reign he had lost some of his former sharpness. Neither did\r\nhe see so plainly the dangers of his situation, nor realise that he\r\ncould not act as freely as he had done at the time of the _coup d’état_\r\nof December, 1852, and during the Crimean and Italian campaigns.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself weakened, in part through the mistakes of his early\r\nyouth, as well as by his associations, which were beginning to tell upon\r\nhim, and of which he had a nervous dread of being reminded. As an\r\nexample of this the following anecdote is typical. A Russian lady, the\r\nCountess K----, who used to frequent the Tuileries, met one day an\r\nItalian statesman, whose name I won’t mention as he is still living.\r\nThis gentleman suddenly asked whether it would not amuse her to frighten\r\nthe Emperor. She was young and giddy, and accepted with enthusiasm. He\r\nthen told her that at the next fancy ball that was going to take place\r\nat the Naval Office, the Sovereigns were to attend as the guests of the\r\nMarquis and the Marquise de Chasseloup Laubat. The lady was to approach\r\nNapoleon and to whisper in his ear the name of an Italian then in Paris,\r\nand to remind Napoleon of an interview he had had with him in a small\r\ninn near Perugia. No explanations were given to the lady, and she never\r\nasked for any, but when the ball took place she managed to approach the\r\nEmperor, who was present in a domino, and to murmur in his ear the\r\nphrase given her, without, it must be owned, attaching any special\r\nimportance to it. Napoleon’s face became white, and, seizing her hand,\r\nhe asked her, in an agitated voice, to tell him from whom she had\r\nobtained this information. The Countess was terrified, and replied that\r\na domino had whispered it to her during the ball. The Emperor plied her\r\nwith questions, but to no purpose, as his extreme emotion had put her\r\non her guard. Two days later, to her surprise, she was invited to dine\r\nat the Tuileries. When the meal was over, the Empress, who had been\r\nunusually gracious, called her to her side, and taking care no one\r\nshould hear them, asked her to explain from whom she had heard the\r\nincident to which she had alluded during her conversation with the\r\nEmperor, at the ball of Madame de Chasseloup Laubat. The Countess,\r\nthough taken quite unawares, persisted in her assurance that she did not\r\nknow the domino who had imparted it to her; that she was now very sorry\r\nfor heedlessly repeating words to which she had attached no importance.\r\nEugénie pressed her again and again, and at last exclaimed with\r\nimpatience, as she rose from her chair: “People like to be asked to the\r\nTuileries, but do not seem to consider that it is a grievous want of\r\ntact to hold converse with the enemies of the Sovereign whilst doing\r\nso.” “And,” added the Countess when she related to me this anecdote,\r\n“from that moment I was watched at every step by the secret police, and\r\nto this day I do not know why I was chosen as the instrument to deal\r\nsuch a blow to Napoleon III.”\r\n\r\nI have related this anecdote to prove how very much the Emperor dreaded\r\nall that related to his first steps in political life, under the\r\npatronage of the Carbonari and other secret associations that were\r\nworking towards the unification of Italy. He did not feel himself a free\r\nagent in that respect; no one knew exactly why, because he never\r\nexpressed himself on the subject--but it is certain that some of the\r\nmost unexpected things he did had their source in this mysterious\r\ninfluence which made him appear to be more or less averse to thwarting\r\nthe desires of his former Italian friends.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was not brilliant by any means; but he was certainly clever,\r\nthough sometimes lacking in initiative. It is not likely that he would\r\never have had the courage either to escape from Ham, or to overthrow the\r\nsecond Republic, had he not been emboldened in the first of these\r\nattempts by Conneau, and in the second by Morny and Fleury, together\r\nwith the active Maupat. He lived under the spell of the Napoleonic\r\ntradition, and being before everything else a fatalist, he thought\r\nhimself destined to ascend the throne which his uncle had conquered. He\r\nnever fought against destiny, and so acquired an apathy which totally\r\nunfitted him for any unexpected struggle. At Sedan he surrendered with\r\nhardly a murmur, as, though he well knew the step to be a fatal one, he\r\nhad tolerated MacMahon’s fatal occupation of that fortress. He had lost\r\nall faith in his future, and he had given up the game long before he\r\nhanded his sword to the conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s was essentially a kind nature. During the eighteen years\r\nof his reign he did an enormous amount of good, and certainly France\r\nowes to him a good deal of her present prosperity. He thought about his\r\npeople’s welfare more than had any previous Sovereign; the economic\r\nquestion was one to which he had given his most earnest attention. He\r\nwanted his country to be strong, rich, an example to others in its\r\nenergetic progress along the path of material and intellectual\r\ndevelopment. He was a lover of art; he was a keen student, an admirer of\r\nliterature; and he appreciated clever men. Catholic in his tastes, he\r\nhad the rare faculty of forgetting the wrongs done to him, in the\r\nremembrance of the many proofs of affection he had experienced. Gifted\r\nwith a sweet and sunny temperament, he had been brought up in the school\r\nof adversity. Amidst all the grandeur that he enjoyed later on, he never\r\nforgot the lesson; and when misfortune once more assailed him, he was\r\nnever heard to murmur, or to reproach those whose incapacity had\r\ndestroyed his life’s work.\r\n\r\nSocially, Napoleon never forgot that the first duty of a monarch is ever\r\nto appear to be amiable. Whenever he swerved from that axiom it was\r\nalways for some very good reason. He had great tact, and possessed to\r\nperfection the art of invariably saying the right thing in the right\r\nplace. Yet he knew very well how to differentiate between persons, and\r\nto accord the exact shade of behaviour towards an Ambassador or to an\r\nAttaché, to a simple tourist, or to a foreign personage entrusted with a\r\nmission of some kind.\r\n\r\nHe was entirely interesting in all his remarks, and always conversant\r\nwith the subject about which he spoke. Though he had pretensions to\r\nscientific and historical knowledge, he was not at all a well-read man\r\nin the strict sense; but he had a wonderful faculty of assimilating all\r\nthat he read, and after having quickly run through a book, was at once\r\nacquainted with its principal points or defects. Sceptical in his\r\nappreciations, and perhaps in his beliefs, he had the utmost respect for\r\nthe convictions of his fellow creatures, and though by no means a\r\nreligious man, reverenced religion deeply. His faults and errors, in the\r\npolitical sense, proceeded more from the influence of his immediate\r\nentourage than from his own appreciation of right and wrong. In many\r\nthings he deserves to be pitied, and in many of his mistakes he was the\r\nscapegoat of those who threw their blame upon his shoulders--a blame\r\nthat either from indifference or from disdain he accepted without a\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may seem to say so, he knew humanity, but not the\r\npeople with whom he lived. He never expected gratitude, and yet he\r\nbelieved that the men upon whom he had showered any amount of benefits\r\nwould feel grateful to him. To the last hour of his life he thought that\r\nhis dynasty had some chance to recover the throne; and he remained\r\nconvinced of the fidelity of his partisans in spite of the many proofs\r\nthat he had to the contrary. His many illusions proceeded from the\r\nkindness of his nature, a kindness that never failed him, either in\r\nprosperity or in disaster.\r\n\r\nI was introduced to Napoleon III. at Compiègne. I had been invited\r\nthere, together with the Russian Ambassador, in the course of the month\r\nof November that had followed upon my appointment in Paris. We assembled\r\nbefore dinner in what was called the Salle des Gardes, a long apartment\r\npanelled in white, to which a profusion of flowers, scattered\r\neverywhere, gave a homely look. We were a very numerous company, and it\r\nwas on that evening I became acquainted with many leading stars in the\r\nImperial firmament. We did not have to wait long before a door was\r\nopened and an _huissier_ called out in a loud voice: “L’Empereur!”\r\n\r\nThe Sovereigns entered the room, the Empress slightly in front, Napoleon\r\nfollowing her with the Princess Clotilde on his arm. He began at once to\r\ntalk with the members of the Corps Diplomatique, whilst his Consort\r\napproached the ladies gathered together at one end of the vast hall.\r\nWhen my Ambassador presented me, Napoleon asked me whether I was the son\r\n“of the lovely Countess Vassili” he had known in London, and when I\r\nreplied to him in the affirmative he at once began to talk about my\r\nmother, and the many opportunities he had had to meet her. “I am glad to\r\nsee you here,” he added, “and I hope you will enjoy your stay in\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress on that day, when I beheld her for the first time, did not\r\nstrike me as so absolutely beautiful as I had been led to expect. Later\r\non I found out that her greatest attraction was in the varying charm of\r\nher expressive face. The features were quite lovely in their regularity,\r\nbut a certain heaviness in the chin robbed them of what otherwise would\r\nhave been absolute perfection. The mouth had a curve which told that on\r\noccasion the Empress could be very hard and disdainful, but the eyes and\r\nthe hair were glorious, the figure splendid, and she had an inimitable\r\ngrace in her every movement. With the exception of the Empress Marie\r\nFeodorovna of Russia, I have never seen anyone bow like Eugénie, with\r\nthat sweeping movement of her whole body and head, that seemed to be\r\naddressed to each person present in particular and to all in general. On\r\nthat particular evening she was a splendid vision in evening dress. Her\r\nwhite shoulders shone above the low bodice of her gown, and many jewels\r\nadorned her beautiful person. But though she excited admiration she did\r\nnot at first appeal either to the senses or to the imagination of men.\r\nAt least, so it seemed to me, whatever might have been said to the\r\ncontrary. Later on, however, when one had opportunity to see her more\r\nfrequently, and especially to talk with her, her personality grew upon\r\none with an especial charm that has never been equalled by any other\r\nwoman. She was not brilliant; she held strong opinions; she was very\r\nmuch impressed by her position, though, it must be owned, not in the\r\nleast dazzled by her extraordinary success; she was impulsive; she was\r\nnot overwhelmingly tactful; had much knowledge of the world, but little\r\nknowledge of mankind; she wounded sometimes when she had no intention of\r\ndoing so; she was romantic, though unsentimental; there were the\r\nstrangest contradictions in her nature, the strangest mixtures of good\r\nand bad; but with all her defects she completely subjugated those who\r\ngot to know her, whatever might have been the first impression. Her\r\nglances had something of Spanish softness blended with French coquetry.\r\nIn a word, she was a most attractive woman--one of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMPRESS EUGÉNIE]\r\n\r\nmost attractive that has ever lived--but she certainly was not an ideal\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\nWhen Eugénie married she was already twenty-seven, and therefore it was\r\nnot easy for her to become used to the various duties and obligations of\r\nher new position. She was a thorough woman of the world, which rendered\r\nher especially charming when at Compiègne or at Fontainebleau, where\r\netiquette was not so strict as at the Tuileries. At those moments she\r\nwas positively bewitching, but when she thought it necessary to assume\r\nher Imperial manner she lost her womanly charm.\r\n\r\nThere have been many beautiful moments in Eugénie’s life; such, for\r\ninstance, as her famous visit to Amiens at the time the cholera was\r\nraging there, and when, with a truly royal indifference, she exposed\r\nherself to very real and serious danger. She was charitable, and\r\npreferred not to boast of her charities; but, not possessing the\r\nEmperor’s disposition, she resented injuries done to her. She was\r\nimpetuous in all that she did, thought, or felt; certainly bigoted and\r\nsuperstitious, as Spaniards generally are. She was not courageous,\r\nthough brave, because these are two very different things. She would not\r\nhave minded being murdered in state, and the memory of the deed being\r\nhanded down to posterity; but she could not find the resolution to face\r\nan intricate situation, nor to remain silent and firm at a difficult\r\nmoment. Her nature was essentially restless; she could never wait with\r\npatience for what the future might hold. Her attitude on the 4th of\r\nSeptember was characteristic, and it was in accordance with her nature\r\nthat she tried to explain the abandonment of her position as Regent by\r\nthe word “necessity,” when, in reality, it was the shrinking of a lonely\r\nwoman, with no one near her to tell her what she ought to do, or to show\r\nher how to resist the demands of the mob.\r\n\r\nBut once more I must say she exercised a wonderful fascination on all\r\nthose whom she entertained. There was something remarkable in the\r\ninfluence she exercised. In her presence one forgot all save her\r\nextraordinary charm.\r\n\r\nIn her private life Eugénie de Montijo, in spite of all that has been\r\nsaid and written on that subject, has always been irreproachable. Amid\r\nall the gaieties of the Court over which she presided she remained pure\r\nand chaste, and redeemed the many frailties of her outward demeanour by\r\nthe dignity and blamelessness of her existence as a wife and mother. She\r\nbitterly resented the indiscretions of the Emperor, but she kept herself\r\naloof from everything that could have been construed as a desire on her\r\npart to retaliate. Perhaps her temperament helped her; but it is certain\r\nthat as a wife she was blameless, and that she showed herself an\r\nenlightened mother, trying to bring up her son above the flatteries that\r\nusually surround children born in such a high position, teaching him to\r\nobey, to be grateful to those who took care of him, and loving him quite\r\nas well and more wisely than the Emperor, who was perhaps too indulgent\r\nin matters which concerned his only son. That the Prince Imperial\r\nremained an only child was a source of deep grief to Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nWhen first I saw Eugénie, her whole appearance was fairy-like; in spite\r\nof her forty years, she eclipsed all other women. Her slight, graceful\r\nfigure was almost girlish in its suppleness, and she is the only woman I\r\nhave ever seen who, though in middle life, did not prompt one to utter\r\nthe usual remark when lovely members of the fair sex have attained her\r\nage: “How beautiful she must have been when she was young!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SURROUNDINGS AND FRIENDS OF THE SOVEREIGNS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon III. married, he tried to establish his Court on the same\r\nfooting as that of his uncle after the latter’s union with Marie Louise,\r\nand fearing that, in spite of his affection, his young wife would find\r\nit hard to get used to her exalted position, he surrounded her with the\r\ntrammels of a severe etiquette. From this, however, she gradually\r\nemancipated herself, especially during the time when she acted as Regent\r\nfor the Emperor, at the period of the war of 1859 with Austria.\r\n\r\nThis emancipation was in itself a curious phase. In her way Eugénie was\r\njust as anxious as the Emperor to order her household upon the same\r\nlines as those of the other great Courts of Europe. Especially with that\r\nof Windsor she had been deeply impressed, when with the Emperor she\r\nvisited Queen Victoria. But she was not endowed by nature with that\r\nreserved dignity which is a necessity to regal rank, and the result\r\nstultified her efforts. The Empress, when a girl, had enjoyed far more\r\nliberty than girls had at the time of which I am writing. This lack of\r\ncontrol led her sometimes to forget her rank as Empress, and she found\r\nherself drifting into her old habits of saying everything that occurred\r\nto her, or of allowing her sympathies and her antipathies to be seen by\r\na public always eager and ready to criticise.\r\n\r\nShe had but few friends, and after the death of her sister, the Duchesse\r\nd’Albe, she felt very isolated, and in need of one into whose ear she\r\nmight confide her sorrows and her joys. She did not get on with the\r\nmembers of the Imperial Family, and she had been very much hurt at the\r\nattitude taken up in regard to her by the Princess Clotilde. Eugénie had\r\nreceived the Princess with open arms, but had met with repulse from the\r\nvery first moment Clotilde arrived in France. Then, again, Eugénie’s\r\nrelations with Prince Napoleon became of the worst, perhaps owing to the\r\nfact that there had been a day, before her marriage with the Emperor,\r\nwhen those relations were very near. The antagonism towards her which\r\nthe only cousin of her husband chose to adopt, wounded her to the quick,\r\nand instead of trying to overcome it with tact and apparent\r\nindifference, she did her best to accentuate his animosity, until open\r\nwarfare resulted, and the strained situation became a general topic of\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\nWith Princess Mathilde, the sister of the Prince, the Empress was, also,\r\nnot on intimate terms, although apparently they bore one another\r\naffection. The Princess was perhaps the most remarkable among the many\r\nfascinating women with whom the Second Empire will remain associated.\r\nSurpassingly beautiful in her youth, she retained her good looks, and\r\nnotwithstanding her _embonpoint_, possessed a personality of great\r\ndignity. She was certainly a _grande dame_, despite her numerous\r\nfrailties.\r\n\r\nShe was clever, kind, brilliant in more senses than one; very talented,\r\nshe liked to surround herself with clever people, who, in their turn,\r\nwere glad to have her appreciation. There had been a time when the\r\nquestion of a marriage between her and her cousin, Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon, had been discussed, but the latter’s chances were so\r\nuncertain, that neither Mathilde nor her father had had the courage to\r\nrun the risk of uniting her destiny with that of the Pretender.\r\n\r\nThe Princess married M. Demidoff, and very soon regretted it; so deeply\r\nthat she tried to break the bonds. Thanks to the intervention of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas of Russia, a separation was arranged under very\r\nfavourable terms for Madame Demidoff, who, by permission of the\r\ngovernment of Louis Philippe, settled in Paris. She did not mix with\r\npolitics, and only tried to create for herself a pleasant circle of\r\nacquaintances and friends. Unfortunately, she possessed in addition to a\r\nsuperior and cultivated mind, a very ardent temperament, and gossip soon\r\nbecame busy with her name, especially after her liaison with Count de\r\nNieuwekerke became a recognised fact.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution of 1848 brought back to France the heir to the\r\nBonaparte traditions, the Princess Mathilde at once hastened to his\r\nside, and showed herself to be the best of friends. It was the Princess\r\nMathilde who presided at his first entertainment at Compiègne, as well\r\nas at the Elysée, where he was residing when in the capital, and it was\r\nat her house that the Prince President, as he was called, met for the\r\nfirst time the lovely Spaniard who was later to become his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Mathilde did not like the marriage, in view of the fact\r\nthat she might have occupied the place which this stranger took, as it\r\nwere by storm; she would hardly have been human had she done so. But she\r\nwas far too clever to show her disapproval, and it is related that when\r\nthe question arose as to who should carry the train of the new Empress,\r\nMathilde at once declared that she would do so if the Emperor asked her,\r\nmuch to the astonishment and perhaps to the scandal of those who heard\r\nher. She bore no malice, and thought herself far too great a lady to\r\nimagine that by whatever she might do she would fall in the estimation\r\nof others, or that it would be derogatory to her position.\r\n\r\nBut though she consented to receive the future wife of her cousin when\r\nfirst she entered the Tuileries, and though she tried hard to establish\r\nfriendly relations with her, all her efforts failed, partly because the\r\nyoung Empress felt afraid of the brilliant Princess, and of her sharp\r\ntongue and brusque manners, partly, also, because Mathilde did not care\r\nfor the people who formed the entourage of the Sovereign, and never felt\r\nat her ease at the many entertainments given by Eugénie. She thought\r\nthem either too dull or too boisterous.\r\n\r\nMathilde was never so happy as when in her own house in the Rue de\r\nCourcelles, where all that was distinguished in France considered it an\r\nhonour to be admitted, and where she could live the life of a private\r\nlady of high rank. She was too frank to conceal what she felt, and too\r\nhonest to flatter the Empress, or to find charming what she considered\r\nto be the reverse. Though she disapproved of many things that her\r\nbrother, Prince Napoleon, did, she did not care to blame him publicly,\r\nand thus she maintained a neutral attitude in regard to both. Eugenie’s\r\nairy disposition and love of amusement in any shape or form prevented\r\nher from finding pleasure in the company of the Princess Mathilde, whom\r\nshe thought exceedingly dull, and whom she accused of fomenting the\r\naccusations which her enemies showered upon her. So long as the Empire\r\nlasted there was no sympathy between the Empress and her husband’s\r\ncousin, and it was only later, when both ladies had realised the\r\nemptiness of worldly things, that their relations became intimate and\r\naffectionate, so much so that when Mathilde Bonaparte died, it was\r\nEugénie who watched beside her, and whose hands were the last she\r\npressed before expiring.\r\n\r\nThe best friend that the Empress Eugénie had among the members of the\r\nImperial Family was the Princess Anna Murat, who married the Duke of\r\nMouchy, to the horror of all the Noailles family, and the chagrin of the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain generally. Princess Anna was one of the loveliest\r\nwomen of her time, though perhaps not one of the brightest. Still, she\r\nhad a warm heart, a kindly disposition, and a sincere attachment for the\r\nEmpress. She had very nice dignified manners, if sometimes stiff, and\r\nwas perhaps the only really _grande dame_, with the exception of the\r\nPrincess Mathilde, among the many ladies with whom Eugénie liked to\r\nsurround herself.\r\n\r\nVery much might be said about the ladies of the Court. There were lovely\r\nwomen, such as the Countess Valovska, née Anna Ricci, the dark\r\nFlorentine, whose smiles won her so many hearts, including that of\r\nNapoleon III.; others were clever like Pauline Metternich, and some were\r\nboth lovely and clever, Mélanie Pourtalès for instance, that star of the\r\nEmpire who condescended later to shine in the Republican firmament, and\r\nwho to this day is one of the celebrities of Paris, in spite of her\r\nseventy odd years. There was the Duchesse de Persigny, and the Duchesse\r\nde Cadore, and the Baroness de Rothschild, and many others, but among\r\nthem all the Empress could not boast of a real friend, always with the\r\nexception of the Duchesse de Mouchy, who owed her far too much ever to\r\ndare criticise anything she did.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the Princess Metternich. Among all those to whose fatal\r\ninfluence the Second Empire owed its fall she holds one of the first and\r\nforemost places. She it was who sapped its foundations and lowered its\r\ndignity; she it was who with a rude hand pulled back the veil which,\r\nuntil she appeared at Compiègne and at the Tuileries, had still been\r\ndrawn between the general public and the Imperial Court. Young and ugly,\r\nbut clever and gifted with what the French call _brio_, she lived but\r\nfor one thing, and that was amusement in any shape or form. She had no\r\nrespect for the society in which she found herself, and brought to\r\nParis an atmosphere of carelessness such as we sometimes display when\r\nwe find ourselves travelling in a country where we are unknown, and\r\nwhere we can do what we like without fear of the _qu’en dira-t-on_, or,\r\nas they say in England, “Mrs. Grundy.” After some experience of the\r\nstrict etiquette of the Austrian Hofburg, she felt delighted to be able\r\nto dispense with it, and treated the Empress with disdain, making use of\r\nher in order to attain her own ends, and ruling the Tuileries like some\r\nof the present great ladies in pecuniary straits rule the houses of the\r\nAmerican or South African millionaires whom--for a consideration--they\r\nintroduce into society. The behaviour of the Princess Metternich can be\r\ncharacterised by her remark to a lady who, at Compiègne, reproved her\r\nfor trying to induce the Empress to appear in public in a short gown, a\r\nthing that was not considered to be proper at the time of which I am\r\nwriting. The friend asked her at the same time whether she would have\r\nadvised the Empress Elizabeth to do such a thing; she replied\r\nvehemently: “No, certainly not, I would not do such a thing, but then my\r\nEmpress is a real one.”\r\n\r\nPauline Metternich never liked Eugénie; she secretly envied her for her\r\nbeauty. She encouraged her in every false or mistaken step the Empress\r\nunwittingly took. She brought a shade of vulgarity into all the\r\nentertainments over which she presided and which she organised. She\r\nsmoked big cigars without minding in the least whether it pleased the\r\nEmpress or not, and she allowed herself every kind of liberty, sure of\r\nimmunity, and careless as to what people thought about her. She showed\r\nherself the most ungrateful of beings, forsaking her friend when the\r\nlatter was precipitated into obscurity and misfortune, never once giving\r\nher a thought. Pauline Metternich was a perfect type of an opportunist\r\nwithout a memory, and after having danced, eaten, smoked, enjoyed\r\nherself at the Tuileries where she always was a favoured guest, she\r\nnever once sent a message of sympathy to the discarded Sovereign, whose\r\nacquaintance she probably thought irksome and inconvenient. Once in a\r\nmoment of expansion, so the story goes, she gave way to a remark which\r\ndeserves to pass to posterity concerning those years during which she\r\nwas the leading spirit at all the entertainments given at the Tuileries,\r\nand which I cannot help reproducing here: A diplomat who had known her\r\nin Paris asked her whether she did not regret the Second Empire, and\r\nreceived a characteristic reply: “Regret it? Why? It was very amusing,\r\nvery vulgar, and it could not last; we all knew it, and we all made hay\r\nwhilst the sun shone.”\r\n\r\nCountess Mélanie Pourtalès, in that respect, was far superior to\r\nPrincess Metternich; she at least had the decency to remain faithful to\r\nher former sympathies and to her Bonapartist leanings. To this day she\r\nsees the Empress when the latter visits Paris, and she never indulges in\r\none word of blame concerning that far away time when she also was one of\r\nthe queens of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nMélanie de Bussières is one of the marvels of last century. As beautiful\r\nas a dream, she had an angelic face, lovely innocent eyes, which used to\r\nlook at the world with the guilelessness of a child, and a Madonna-like\r\nexpression that reminded one of a long white lily drooping on its stem.\r\nShe was intelligent, too, had an enormous amount of tact, and succeeded,\r\nwhilst denying herself none of her caprices, in keeping unimpaired her\r\nplace in Parisian society, of retaining as her friends all those to whom\r\nthe world had given another name, and of acquiring a position such as\r\nfew women have ever had before her. Always kind, rarely malicious,\r\nsmiling alike on friends and foes, she contrived to disarm the latter,\r\nand never to estrange the former. Though very much envied, yet she was\r\nliked, and she inspired with enthusiasm all those with whom she was\r\nbrought into contact. Now she is a great-grandmother, but still a\r\nleading light of social Paris, and those who formerly admired her beauty\r\ncontinue to crowd around her in order to listen to her conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the circle of Imperialist society, I was struck by the\r\nnumber of pretty women that I met there. They were not all clever; a\r\ngood many were vulgar, but most of them were lovely. A ball at that time\r\nwas a pretty sight, far prettier than it is at the present day, and as\r\nfor amusement, one could find it wherever one went. Morals, on the other\r\nhand, were no worse than is the case at present; indeed, in many\r\nrespects they were better, insomuch that it was far more difficult then,\r\nowing to the conditions of existence, for a lady belonging to the upper\r\nclasses to misbehave herself than is the case at present, when women go\r\nfreely everywhere, whilst during the Second Empire it was hardly\r\npossible for a well-known lady to be seen in a cab or a ’bus, or even\r\nwalking in unfrequented streets. “Le diable n’y perdait rien,” to use an\r\nold French expression; but a certain decorum, totally absent nowadays,\r\nhad to be adhered to, and the Empress was very severe upon all those who\r\ninfringed its rules. She had attacks of prudery, as it were, during\r\nwhich she posed as a watcher over the morals of her Court. Such a\r\nprocedure among the very carefully immoral persons who surrounded her\r\nmade many people smile.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor also had but few personal friends. The most faithful and\r\ndevoted perhaps was Dr. Conneau, who had watched over Queen Hortense\r\nduring her last illness, and who had given to her son the most sincere\r\nproofs of affection that one man can give to another. Conneau was that\r\n_rara avis_, a totally disinterested person. Millions had passed through\r\nhis hands, but he died poor, and when the Empire fell he was reduced to\r\nselling a collection of rare books he possessed, in order to have bread\r\nin his old age. He loved Napoleon with his whole heart, soul, and mind,\r\nand belonged to the very few who cared for and believed in the\r\ntraditions of the Bonapartes. He did infinite good during the eighteen\r\nyears the Empire lasted, and never refused to lay a case of distress\r\nbefore Napoleon III. once it was brought to his notice. Everybody\r\nrespected him, and he was a general favourite with everyone, except\r\nperhaps with the Empress, who felt no personal sympathy for him.\r\n\r\nConneau had voluntarily asked to be allowed to share the Emperor’s\r\ncaptivity at Ham, and it was thanks to him that the latter contrived to\r\nescape from that fortress disguised as a workman, with a plank on his\r\nshoulder, behind which he hid his face. Whilst Napoleon was hastening\r\ntowards the Belgian frontier, Conneau did his best to hide his flight\r\nfrom the authorities, declaring to those who wanted to see him that he\r\nwas ill and asleep in his bed. Conneau had cunningly arranged the\r\npillows in such a way that they appeared to represent a body wrapped up\r\nin blankets. He knew very well that in doing this he was running a great\r\nrisk, but nothing stopped him, and it is certain that to his bold\r\ninitiative Napoleon III. owed first his escape and afterwards his\r\nImperial Crown.\r\n\r\nConneau never left the Emperor, who breathed his last in that faithful\r\nservant’s arms, murmuring before doing so: “Conneau, were you at Sedan?”\r\nthus showing how incurable had been the wound received on that fatal day\r\nwhich saw the fall of his throne and of his dynasty.\r\n\r\nConneau, with perhaps the exception of M. Mocquard, Napoleon’s private\r\nsecretary, was the person who knew the best of the Emperor’s character,\r\nand he remained faithful to him to the last. One day a friend asked him\r\nwhether he was sorry not to have died before the fall of the Empire,\r\nand to have witnessed the terrible catastrophes that accompanied it.\r\nConneau immediately replied: “I am sorry for myself, but glad for the\r\nEmperor who would have had one friend less around him in his\r\nmisfortune.” The remark is characteristic of the man.\r\n\r\nMocquard also belonged to the few friends of Napoleon III. who had known\r\nhis mother Queen Hortense, and who had devoted his life to the cause of\r\nthe Bonapartes. He was one of the pleasantest men of his day, always on\r\nthe alert to learn or to hear everything that could be useful to his\r\nImperial master. Gifted with singular tact, he was able with advantage\r\nto come out of the most entangled and awkward situations. His reply to\r\nBerryer, who had written to him telling him that his political\r\nconvictions prevented him from asking to be presented to the Emperor on\r\nhis election to the French Academy, is well known, and proves his\r\nability in that respect. The great advocate, in writing to Mocquard, had\r\nappealed to him as a former colleague. Napoleon’s private secretary at\r\nonce responded to his request, and gave him the most courteous and most\r\nrespectful reproof, in which the dignity of his Sovereign and that of\r\nthe great advocate were equally taken into account.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor,” wrote Mocquard, “regrets that M. Berryer has allowed his\r\npolitical leanings to get the upper hand of his duties as Academician.\r\nM. Berryer’s presence at the Tuileries would not have embarrassed His\r\nMajesty, as he seems to dread. From the height on which he finds himself\r\nraised, the Emperor would only have seen in the new Academician an\r\norator and a writer; in to-day’s adversary, the defender of yesterday.\r\nM. Berryer is perfectly free to obey the general practice imposed by the\r\nAcademy, or to follow his personal repugnances.”\r\n\r\nA friend of Berryer, who happened to be with him when that letter\r\nreached him, related to me later that that famous ornament of the French\r\nBar for once in his life felt embarrassed, and acknowledged his regret\r\nat thus having drawn upon himself a well deserved and tactfully\r\nadministered rebuff.\r\n\r\nWhen Mocquard died his place was taken by M. Conti, also a clever man,\r\nwho was in possession of the post at the time I arrived in Paris. He did\r\nnot succeed in gaining the confidence of the Emperor, as his predecessor\r\nhad done, and I believe never felt quite at ease in his difficult\r\nposition. I do not know what became of him after the fall of the Empire.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fleury was already Ambassador in St. Petersburg at the time of\r\nwhich I am speaking. He had been, and still was, one of the most\r\nintimate friends of the Emperor, but he was not liked by the Empress,\r\nwhose influence he had always tried to thwart. Eugénie was delighted\r\nwhen he was sent on his foreign mission; she had never got used to the\r\nGeneral: perhaps he knew too many things relating to that distant time\r\nwhen Mademoiselle de Montijo had never dreamt that fate held a crown in\r\nreserve for her. And then one of the Empress’s closest acquaintances,\r\nthe Comtesse de Beaulaincourt, the daughter of the Marshal de\r\nCastellane, and formerly Marquise de Contades, had an undying grudge\r\nagainst General Fleury. It must be owned that he had not behaved\r\naltogether well in regard to her, and she used her best endeavours to\r\nharm him in the mind of the impressionable Eugénie, to whom she\r\nrepresented the General as one of her worst enemies. This was not the\r\ncase; but Fleury had no sympathy for the Empress, and certainly did\r\nnothing to further her views or her opinions in regard to politics, as\r\nshe would have liked him to do. To him is credited the most severe\r\ncomment that ever was made on the subject of the marriage between the\r\nEmperor and the lovely Spaniard who had captivated his fancy; that\r\ncomment was revealed to the world through the indiscretion of Madame de\r\nContades, as she was at that time. Fleury had been asked why he objected\r\nso much to his future Sovereign: “I do not like her,” he replied,\r\n“because I feel that she will insist upon wearing her crown in her bed\r\nand her night-cap in public.” This bitter remark being repeated to the\r\nperson whom it most concerned, was never forgiven by her.\r\n\r\nFleury, Persigny, and Morny had been the most trusted advisers of\r\nNapoleon III., but unfortunately I never had opportunity to meet any of\r\nthem. With their removal from the political scene, the Empire lost its\r\nmost solid supports. The ability of M. Rouher could not stave off the\r\nsupreme calamity that was to cast it into the abyss; and as for M. Emile\r\nOllivier, about whom I shall have more to say presently, he had neither\r\nthe energy nor the moral courage to resist the current that went against\r\nhim and that swept away a regime.\r\n\r\nIn general, when I look back upon those last two years of the Second\r\nEmpire, and try to recapitulate all that I saw, I cannot find anyone,\r\nwith the few exceptions already mentioned, who was really the friend of\r\neither the Emperor or the Empress. Surrounded by flatterers, admirers,\r\ncourtiers, they had around them no really devoted people willing to risk\r\nanything in order to prove their affection. The Tuileries seemed to be\r\none vast Liberty Hall, inhabited by men and women who knew very well\r\nthat they had but a short time before them to enjoy the good things of\r\nthis world, and whose only care was how they could escape with the most\r\nadvantage from situations which all the time they felt to be shaking\r\nunder their feet. Indeed, the Court reminded one of a vast _cuvée_ out\r\nof which everybody tried to snatch some prize. It was a case of eating,\r\ndrinking and being merry, but without thinking that for all these things\r\nthere would one day be a reckoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFONTAINEBLEAU AND COMPIÈGNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThough still a young man when I was appointed to Paris--a man of\r\nthirty-two years is considered to be quite young--I had already a\r\nconsiderable experience of the world, and knew the society of most\r\nEuropean capitals, having been at every European Court. I was very well\r\nable, therefore, to judge of what I saw, and to form a reliable opinion,\r\ngood or bad, of the people with whom I came into contact.\r\n\r\nI must confess at once that I arrived in France with certain prejudices\r\nagainst the regime, and I did not examine it at first with\r\nover-indulgent eyes. But as I grew to know the Emperor and the Empress\r\nwell, many of these prejudices vanished. The kindness of the Emperor,\r\nand his boundless generosity, could not but impress favourably, and as\r\nfor Eugénie, her powerful charm made one forget other sides of her\r\ncharacter. When in their presence it was difficult to realise that they\r\nwere Sovereigns, or to have the feeling, whether at the Tuileries, at\r\nCompiègne, or at Fontainebleau, that one was at a Royal Court. A mixture\r\nof formality and of gaiety without restraint was prevalent, which\r\nentirely upset one’s notions of what should constitute the atmosphere of\r\na Court. Eugénie was an incomparable hostess, even if sometimes\r\neccentric; Napoleon was the most thoughtful of hosts, though restless at\r\ntimes, and showing some impatience at different vagaries indulged in by\r\nhis guests; still, though each was addressed as “Your Majesty,” it was\r\nin much the same spirit that one would have said “Monsieur” or\r\n“Madame”; deference was lacking.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the shade of Bohemianism which presided over the annual\r\ngatherings at Compiègne and at Fontainebleau, the invitations were\r\nalways coveted, and with reason, for a week spent at either place was\r\ncertainly most enjoyable. The autumn season generally saw the Sovereigns\r\nat Compiègne, which the Empress liked very much, and there could be met\r\nall the celebrities of modern France and a good many foreigners, whom\r\nthe Imperial couple liked to encourage to visit France, and on whom they\r\nlavished every attention. They were generally asked to stay a full week,\r\nand privileged persons were sometimes invited to extend their sojourn.\r\nLife was very pleasant in this old home of the Bourbon dynasty, and the\r\nliberty left to the guests to do what they liked added to its charm. One\r\nrode, one hunted, one drove, and one flirted to one’s heart’s content,\r\nand the only thing which was asked was punctuality at meals and\r\nadmiration for the beauty of the Empress.\r\n\r\nThe exceeding charm and beauty of the Empress was never more seen to\r\nadvantage than in one of her country homes, where she felt more at her\r\nease than in Paris. She used to ask privileged persons among her guests\r\nto drink tea with her in the afternoon. On these occasions she appeared\r\nat her best, talking on every subject, and discussing all the new books.\r\nShe rather prided herself on being what French people call “un bel\r\nesprit,” and of caring for literature; she considered it a part of her\r\nduty ostensibly to interest herself in the literary and scientific\r\nmovements of the day. She liked to make herself popular among writers\r\nand artists, of whom there was generally a good sprinkling at Compiègne.\r\nAmong her favourites were Octave Feuillet, Mérimée, and Carpeaux. More\r\nthan once Carpeaux implored her to allow him to carve her bust, to\r\nwhich, however, she would not agree. Mérimée had been a friend of her\r\nmother’s, the Countess de Montijo, and had known her as a little girl;\r\nindeed, people whispered softly that he had had a good deal to do with\r\nher elevation to the throne, having admirably advised her at that\r\ncritical period of her existence when first she became the object of\r\nNapoleon’s adoration.\r\n\r\nMérimée was a charming man in spite of his misanthropic tendencies and\r\nhis fits of bad temper, which caused him sometimes to say the rudest\r\nthings imaginable, but which in reality he did not mean at all. He was,\r\nhowever, a privileged person, being customarily forgiven words which\r\nwould not have been tolerated in anyone else. He was, perhaps, amidst\r\nthe crowd which congregated in the vast halls and galleries of\r\nCompiègne, the one who judged most clearly what was going on around him,\r\nand I remember that one evening, when we were discussing the political\r\nsituation, he suddenly asked me: “Et vous croyez que cela durera?” (“And\r\nyou think that all this will last?”) Noticing my surprise, he did me the\r\nhonour of a lengthy explanation: “You see, my friend, here in this\r\nbeautiful France of ours we never look beyond the present day; we enjoy\r\nourselves without any thought of what the morrow may bring. We have seen\r\nso many changes, so many revolutions, that we have entirely lost the\r\nfeeling of stability, without which no nation can achieve really great\r\nthings. In politics one must have either stability, faith in the\r\nprinciples which one is called upon to defend, or else enthusiasm like\r\nthat felt by our troops at Marengo. Now can you imagine a spirit of\r\nenthusiasm for our master here?” And he winked in the direction of the\r\nEmperor’s private apartments. “He is good, and kind, and weak, but\r\nthough the nation and the army shout ‘Vive l’Empereur’ when they see\r\nhim, it is very doubtful whether they would sacrifice anything beyond\r\nthe interests of their neighbours for him. And the Empress, she is as\r\nmuch to be pitied as she is to be envied. I am sorry to have to say so,\r\nbecause I am really attached to her, but what can one do! She does not\r\nrealise that she is not by birth the equal of the other Queens of\r\nEurope, and there lies her great mistake. She is so beautiful that one\r\nwould have worshipped at once Mademoiselle de Montijo, but the nation\r\ncould not bring itself to respect the Comtesse de Téba in the same way\r\nas had she been a Princess born. Now, don’t betray me, please,” he\r\nadded, “but I know that you are discreet, and, besides, who minds the\r\nsayings of that old grumbler Mérimée!”\r\n\r\nThis _boutade_ left a deep impression on my mind at the time I heard it;\r\nit resounded like the “Mene, Tekel, Upharsin” of the Empire, uttered as\r\nit was by a man who was well known to have personally a great and\r\nsincere devotion for the fair Spaniard whom he had helped to place on\r\nthe throne of France. Poor Mérimée was not destined to survive the fall\r\nof that Imperial regime of which he had been one of the strongest\r\nsupporters. He died broken-hearted a few days after the disaster of\r\nSedan, writing pathetically to one of his friends just before his end:\r\n“I have tried all my life to fight against prejudices, and to be a\r\ncitizen of the world before being a Frenchman. But all these cloaks of\r\nphilosophy are now of no avail to me. I bleed to-day of the same wounds\r\nas these idiots of Frenchmen, and I weep over their humiliation.”\r\n\r\nOctave Feuillet was a great favourite of the Empress. He was a charming\r\nman, but always ill and always preoccupied with nursing his health, and\r\nhis _malade imaginaire_. His novels were undoubtedly pretty, and created\r\na great sensation at the time. He was the fashionable novelist of his\r\ngeneration, and certainly some of his works deserve to pass to\r\nposterity because of their fine observation. He was middle-class to the\r\ncore, and this made him worship everything that seemed to be above him.\r\nHe took himself far too much in earnest, and even carried so far his\r\nappreciation of his own merit that he wrote once or twice to the\r\nEmperor, proffering unsought his advice in political matters. Napoleon\r\nIII. was far too kind to rebuff him, and sometimes even replied to him,\r\nflattering his vanity, as he was accustomed to flatter writers and\r\njournalists, in whom he saw the manufacturers of public opinion, and\r\nwhom he liked to conciliate as far as possible. Octave Feuillet\r\nprofessed a great admiration for the Empress, and he must be given his\r\ndue--he remained faithful to her after her fall. He was one of the few\r\nwho went to Chislehurst to present their respects to the exiled and\r\ndethroned Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nIn violent contrast to his behaviour can be instanced that of the\r\narchitect Viollet-le-Duc, who, after having been loaded with money and\r\nkindnesses by the Emperor and his Consort, turned his back upon them\r\nafter the fall of the Empire, and even tried to make excuses for ever\r\nhaving known them. Unfortunately, he was but one of many, and bitter\r\nmust have been the thoughts of Napoleon III. and Eugénie when they saw\r\nthat all the good they had done, the boundless generosity they had\r\nexercised, had only made them a few more enemies among the ranks of\r\nthose who owed them so much.\r\n\r\nCarpeaux, in spite of his rudeness, was very much appreciated at\r\nCompiègne, and I often saw him there, as indeed I met also most of the\r\nillustrious Frenchmen the Empire could boast of at that time. These\r\ncelebrities, and the number of pretty women who were also invited, made\r\nthe gatherings unique. The members of the fair sex who were nearly\r\nalways present were the Princess Metternich, the pretty Comtesse Mélanie\r\nde Pourtalès, the Marquise de Galiffet, then separated from her\r\nhusband, who had already struck up that strange friendship with the\r\nPrincesse de Sagan, née Seillères, which gave rise to so much talk later\r\non. Mme. de Galiffet was one of the loveliest women of the Imperial\r\nCourt, and certainly the one who knew the best how to dress. She was an\r\n_élégante_ before everything else, and I believe cared even more for her\r\ndresses than for her lovers. Her relations with General Galiffet were\r\nmost strange. They used to meet sometimes in society, and he was always\r\nmost polite towards her; it was even said that the warmest admirer the\r\nMarquise de Galiffet had ever had was her husband. This did not prevent\r\nthem never agreeing upon any subject save one, and that, it was\r\nrumoured, reunited them sometimes, not under the same roof, but under\r\nthe same tent, as the Marquise de Caux once said with more wit than\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nAnother habitué of Compiègne was the Baronne de Poilly. She was a daring\r\nhorsewoman, an eccentric character, full of brusquerie and kindness, but\r\nnot liked, and very much talked about. She was, with the Comtesse de\r\nBeaulaincourt, ex-Marquise de Contades, one of the most dreaded persons\r\nin the whole of Paris society.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Madame de Beaulaincourt reminds me of various episodes in\r\nthat lady’s career, which set me wondering how the strict Faubourg St.\r\nGermain, as well as the frivolous society of the Second Empire, could\r\nhave taken her to their hearts in the way they did. She was bad for\r\nbadness’ sake, as unsparing in her words as in her judgments; always on\r\nthe look out for something evil to do, or something unpleasant to say.\r\nFull of wit with it all, this last circumstance only made her the more\r\ndangerous. She was a rare example of a vicious woman who had no\r\ncharitable instincts; it seemed as if she condemned others the more\r\nbitterly because she knew that there was needing much pardon in herself.\r\nNevertheless, Madame de Beaulaincourt was one of the most remarkable\r\npersonalities at the Court of the Emperor Napoleon III., and as such she\r\ndeserves to be remembered.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet and their wives were generally asked to\r\nCompiègne in turn. At Fontainebleau, where the Court used to spend the\r\nsummer months, this was rarely the case. St. Cloud was too near Paris to\r\nbe really pleasant as a summer residence. Fontainebleau was quite in the\r\ncountry, and its lovely forest afforded many opportunities for riding,\r\ndriving, or hunting, which appealed to Eugénie’s tastes. There she used\r\nto live a family life free from the restraints of the Court, with the\r\nguests whom she asked to share her _villégiature_. At Fontainebleau,\r\ntoo, the Emperor, always a great stickler for etiquette, allowed it to\r\nbe relaxed, considering his stay there as a kind of holiday. He was more\r\noften in the company of his guests than at Compiègne, and his presence\r\nwas very much appreciated. When he liked, Napoleon III. could be a\r\ncharming man and an interesting talker, but it was not often that he\r\nallowed himself to become expansive.\r\n\r\nLife at Fontainebleau as well as at Compiègne was almost uniform in its\r\nround of gaieties. The company assembled for breakfast at noon, after\r\nwhich the guests followed their own inclinations during the afternoon. A\r\nfew privileged ones, however, were asked to drive or walk with the\r\nEmpress, and afterwards to have tea with her. All guests enjoyed perfect\r\nliberty, but this did not prevent them from watching their neighbours to\r\nfind out their little weaknesses, for gossip was rife both at Compiègne\r\nand at Fontainebleau, and many unpleasant rumours concerning the Emperor\r\nand the Empress were started there. The manners and customs that\r\nprevailed among the recipients of the Imperial hospitality were publicly\r\ncriticised, the feeling being that it would certainly have been better\r\nhad more discrimination been exercised. There was little dignity though\r\nmuch ceremony during these “series,” as they used to be called, and the\r\nextreme liberty granted was the source of all kinds of unmerited rumours\r\nconcerning what happened in those vast halls. Somehow it savoured of\r\ndesecration to see the gay company of careless men and fashionable women\r\nwho thronged Fontainebleau without giving a thought to the great events\r\nwhich its walls had witnessed.\r\n\r\nOne evening at Fontainebleau, after the rest of the world had retired, I\r\nwas returning late to my bedroom from an enjoyable stroll in the lovely\r\npark. There was a beautiful moon, and it lit up the old castle of\r\nFrançois I., with its many turrets, its old gables, its whole aspect\r\nspeaking of the grandeur of many ages. I thought myself the only one to\r\nindulge in such an eccentricity, when suddenly I came face to face with\r\nthe Chevalier Nigra, then one of the great admirers of the Empress, and\r\na general favourite both at Court and in Society. Chevalier Nigra had\r\nbeen the private secretary of Count de Cavour, and was considered one of\r\nthe stars of Italian diplomacy. He professed the greatest devotion for\r\nEugénie, knew exactly how to flatter her and thus to glean information\r\nas to what was going on in the French Cabinet. More clever than lovely\r\nMadame de Castiglione, who thought that one of her glances was\r\nsufficient to keep the Emperor enchained to her chariot, Nigra did not\r\nattempt to play the lover, but rather the worshipper of the Empress,\r\nwhom he used to tell he had set upon a shrine whence he hoped she would\r\ncondescend from time to time to smile upon him. He had all the subtlety\r\nof the Italian, and had read, and, what is better, thoroughly digested\r\nand understood, the philosophy expressed by Machiavelli in his works. He\r\nwas an ardent patriot, and when he accepted the appointment to Paris it\r\nwas with the firm intention of using his best endeavours to bring about\r\nthe completion and recognition of Italian unity.\r\n\r\nNigra was an extremely pleasant man, with a sufficient tincture of\r\ncynicism to make him amiable without being aggressive. He rarely spoke\r\nthe truth, and never said what he thought; but he had the talent of\r\nconvincing people of his entire sincerity. A keen observer, he had\r\njudged better than any of his colleagues the frailty of the Imperial\r\nregime, and was only watching for the moment when the house of cards\r\nshould collapse. On the evening I am referring to he was smoking a big\r\ncigar and walking slowly in the flower-garden which stretched in front\r\nof the private apartments of the palace, enjoying the scent of the\r\nroses, and from time to time raising his eyes towards the only row of\r\nwindows still showing a light amidst the darkness that enveloped the\r\nvenerable pile.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw me, he pointed upwards with his finger to these windows,\r\nsaying at the same time:\r\n\r\n“She is not sleeping; she is always the last one to go to rest.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what she is doing so late,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Thinking about her dresses, or the last sermon she has listened to,”\r\nwas the remark of Nigra. “How little the Empress understands her\r\nsituation.”\r\n\r\n“She gathers her roses whilst she can,” was my reply.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” retorted the Italian diplomatist, “and perhaps she does the best\r\nthing under the circumstances; all this cannot last.”\r\n\r\n“You do not believe in the durability of the Empire?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“No,” was the reply. “I do not believe in it at all. The Italian\r\nquestion will overthrow it sooner than one thinks.”\r\n\r\n“You do not admit the possibility of a war between Italy and France on\r\nthe subject of the integrity of the Holy See?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Certainly I don’t,” said Nigra, “but I know one thing; the Emperor has\r\nno likelihood of keeping his crown, or of passing it to his son, unless\r\nhe makes up his mind to fulfil the promises which he gave, perhaps in an\r\nunguarded moment, and without thinking of the consequences, but which he\r\ngave all the same. This hesitation of his has not only entirely\r\ndestroyed his popularity in Italy, but it has also thrown Italian\r\npoliticians into the arms of his foes. You see, we cannot prevent the\r\nnatural course of events taking place; the supremacy of the Pope has had\r\nits day, and the Bourbons also have achieved their destiny. Italy, if\r\nshe is to be regenerated, can only be so under the sway of an Italian\r\ndynasty. The Bourbons are not Italians; they are French, with a large\r\nadmixture of Austrian blood, and their temperament is distinctly hostile\r\nto that of the Italian people. The House of Savoy, on the other hand,\r\nhas everything that appeals to the mind and to the imagination of my\r\ncountry; it will welcome Victor Emmanuel with joy wherever he may\r\nappear. You must not forget, either, a thing of which people generally\r\nlose sight: Italians are superstitious; they are not at all religious,\r\nand they more or less look upon the Pope in the same light as they do\r\nthe small princes and dukes who have ruled them for so long. Temporal\r\nPower has far more prestige abroad than is the case with us, and\r\nItalians will only feel wrathful against those who may try to force it\r\nupon them. The people of Italy instinctively guess that the Emperor is\r\nafraid to go against the popular feeling in France, and that he will at\r\na given moment refuse to help their ambitions if he finds that they\r\nclash with his own personal interests. That is where he makes his\r\nmistake,” continued Nigra, who had become excited, a rare thing with\r\nhim; “that is where he makes his mistake. If he upheld our national\r\nambitions he would find us at his side when his hour of peril will\r\nstrike, whereas now we shall merely look on and do what he did in\r\n1859--seek our own advantage, heedless of the danger in which he may\r\nfind himself placed.”\r\n\r\nI looked at him attentively.\r\n\r\n“So you believe that this hour of danger is fast approaching?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Of course it is,” was the reply; “its warning rang long ago, after\r\nSadowa, and when the bullets of Juarez struck the breast of Maximilian\r\nat Queretaro. It is only blind people, blinded by vanity, like those who\r\nare in power here, who do not see the menace that the armaments of\r\nPrussia constitute for the whole of Europe.”\r\n\r\n“You do not believe in the readiness of the French army in case of a\r\nwar?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Do you?” retorted Nigra.\r\n\r\nI remained silent.\r\n\r\n“No, I do not believe in it,” he went on slowly, “the army is not\r\ncapable of strong resistance to a well disciplined foe. How can an army\r\nbe so in a country where politics are paramount? You see there is no\r\nreal patriotism in France, there is only chauvinism, and that is not\r\nquite the same thing. The Frenchman will not admit that he can be\r\nconquered by anyone. Why, we have seen it at Solferino, where our troops\r\nfought desperately, and were not even thanked by the Emperor, whose\r\nsoldiers could never have held out alone against the shock of the\r\nAustrian regiments. When we came up and decided the fate of the battle\r\nthey were already giving way. You must not forget one thing, the French\r\nsoldier gets discouraged at his first reverse, and most certainly the\r\nfate of the next campaign will be decided in its very first days.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor also is no longer what he once was,” went on Nigra; “he is\r\nill, broken down, either by disease or by worry, he has lost very much\r\nof his former elasticity, and is more than ever undecided in the\r\nresolutions he is called upon to make. The Empress, on the other hand,\r\nbelieves herself to possess political ability, and is encouraged therein\r\nby people who see a source of advantage for them in a Regency over which\r\nshe would be called upon to preside. The death of the Emperor, which ten\r\nyears ago would have been regarded in the light of a calamity, not only\r\nfor France but for Europe, is no longer dreaded, because the feeling is\r\nthat he has survived himself, that his lucky star has left him. The\r\nconvinced Bonapartists think that a Liberal Empire is an anachronism;\r\nbut the Emperor, who was always more or less a conspirator, dreams, on\r\nthe contrary, of establishing his dynasty on new lines, in which his\r\nstrong sympathies towards Liberalism will take the upper hand. When once\r\nhis entourage realise this fact, which so far they do not yet suspect,\r\nthey will do their best to bring matters to a crisis, and by means of a\r\nforeign war divert Napoleon’s mind from his present intentions. And that\r\nwar----”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked at me significantly.\r\n\r\n“That war won’t find Italy the ally of France,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, because there would be no necessity for it. Why should\r\nwe lose either men or money when nothing could be gained by it? What we\r\nwant is Rome, and Rome we shall get all the same, whether Napoleon\r\nallows it or not. One cannot stop the evolution of history.”\r\n\r\n“But she--what will she do?” I asked, pointing up to the windows we had\r\nbeen looking at a few moments before, when, as if in reply to my\r\nquestion, the light suddenly went out.\r\n\r\nNigra shrugged his shoulders, as if this matter did not concern him at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“She will never resign herself to her fall, should such a thing occur,”\r\nI remarked.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, she will do so,” was the answer. “She will not even attempt to\r\nfight against her fate should it prove inimical to her,” he concluded\r\nphilosophically.\r\n\r\nIt was during the last time the Imperial Court was at Fontainebleau that\r\nthis remarkable conversation took place, and it impressed me so much\r\nthat I noted it down at once when I reached my room. I was to think\r\nabout it more than once subsequently, and many years later, meeting\r\nCount Nigra, as he had become then, in St. Petersburg, where he had been\r\nappointed Italian Ambassador, I reminded him of it, and asked him to\r\ntell me what had really been the conduct of the Empress Eugénie on that\r\nfateful 4th of September when he and Prince Metternich urged her to fly\r\nbefore the revolutionaries.\r\n\r\n“She did exactly what I told you that night at Fontainebleau,” replied\r\nNigra; “she declared that she would not go against the wishes of the\r\ncountry, and that, since it wanted her to leave Paris, she would do so.\r\nMind, she knew nothing as to whether this was true or not; no one had\r\ntold her that the country wanted her to go, one had simply drawn her\r\nattention to the fact that her life was in danger, and she believed it\r\nat once. Metternich at one moment asked her whether she would not take a\r\nfew things with her, but she replied that it was not necessary, and she\r\nleft the Tuileries without even taking a pocket handkerchief.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MEN OF THE TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nI became very well acquainted with both M. Rouher and M. Emile Ollivier.\r\nThe latter inspired me with warm feelings of friendship. He was\r\nessentially an honest man, and his mistakes were more the faults of\r\nothers than his own. He never had the opportunity really to show of what\r\nstuff he was made. Though possessed of the best intentions in the world,\r\nhe was always misunderstood and suspected, even by the very people who\r\nshould have had confidence in him and in his sense of justice and\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\nWhen he was called upon to form a Cabinet he was met by the antagonism\r\nof the Empress, who did not approve of the new trend in politics, which\r\nhad replaced the one inaugurated at the _coup d’état_. She hated the\r\nidea of the slightest diminution in the Imperial power and prestige. She\r\ndid not believe in the necessity of concessions to public opinion, and\r\nshe was deeply incensed to find that her ideas on the subject were not\r\nshared by her husband, who was more or less under the influence of his\r\nnew Prime Minister. Eugénie, who was superstitious, declared to her\r\nfriends that she had the feeling when she spoke with Emile Ollivier that\r\nhe was going to be fatal to her.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that fate went against the new Prime Minister. M. Ollivier\r\nhad hardly been in power when occurred an event almost forgotten to-day,\r\nbut which was to sound the first knell of the Empire. Prince Pierre\r\nBonaparte shot Victor Noir.\r\n\r\nTill that fatal day very few people knew anything about Prince Pierre.\r\nHe was a distant cousin of the Emperor, with whom his relations had\r\nnever been either affectionate or even friendly. He was the black sheep\r\nof a family which at that time could ill afford a setback, and his\r\npolitical opinions, coupled with an irregular connection with a person\r\nbelonging to an inferior class, and whom he was ultimately to make his\r\nwife, had led to his disgrace by the head of his house. Napoleon III.\r\nignored the existence of this inconvenient kinsman, who lived in a\r\nlittle house at Auteuil.\r\n\r\nPrince Pierre was a true Corsican in character: violent, and given to\r\nstrong fits of passion. He professed, together with most Radical\r\npolitical opinions and strong Republican sympathies, an immense worship\r\nfor the memory of his great ancestor, the first Napoleon, and a great\r\nrespect for the family traditions of the Bonapartes. And when one day,\r\nin a small newspaper edited at Bastia, he chanced across a very vile\r\nattack on the family, he got into a rage, and replied to it in the same\r\npaper by an equally virulent attack directed against the author.\r\n\r\nThe matter did not end there, for very soon the Parisian press took\r\npart, and the occasion was used by the enemies of the Imperial regime in\r\norder to air their grievances against it. At last one of the editors of\r\nan opposition paper called _La Revanche_, M. Paschal Grousset, who later\r\non was to acquire a sorry celebrity during the excesses of the Commune,\r\nsent two of his friends to Prince Pierre, to request him either to\r\napologise in person or else to fight.\r\n\r\nWhat happened during the interview no one will ever know. The versions\r\ngiven by the Prince and that of M. Ulric de Fonville, who together with\r\nVictor Noir had called at Auteuil at the request of Paschal Grousset,\r\ndiffer entirely as to what passed. The result, however, was the murder\r\nof Noir by the cousin of Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nThis event, occurring as it did at a moment when the Empire was being\r\nattacked on all sides and already tottering, added considerably to the\r\ndifficulties under which the Emperor was labouring. Unfortunately,\r\nneither he nor his responsible advisers calculated its consequences.\r\nInstead of following the advice given by M. Rouher, who was of opinion\r\nthat Prince Pierre should have been imprisoned in a fortress until his\r\ncrime had been forgotten by the public, Napoleon III. decided to have\r\nhis cousin tried by a special court which assembled at Tours. The court\r\nacquitted the accused, which only added to the general exasperation\r\nagainst the government. M. Ollivier was reproached with having lent\r\nhimself to a travesty of justice, in order to shield a relative of the\r\nSovereign from a justly deserved punishment, and was accused by his\r\nformer friends and followers of allowing himself to fall under the\r\ninfluence of the Court.\r\n\r\nThis was gall and wormwood to that sincere politician, and the\r\nbitterness which resulted on both sides made the head of the Cabinet\r\nlose that calmness which, more than anyone else, he required in the\r\ndifficult task that lay before him.\r\n\r\nAs to Prince Pierre, the cause of all this perturbation, he left France\r\nafter his acquittal, settled in Brussels, and after the fall of the\r\nEmpire married the mother of his children, and spent his life in\r\ncomparative poverty until the marriage of his son Roland Bonaparte with\r\nthe youngest daughter of the celebrated Blanc, of Monaco fame, which\r\nbrought back financial prosperity to that branch of the family. He did\r\nnot enjoy it long, because he died a few months later, and was followed\r\nvery quickly to the grave by his young daughter-in-law. His widow, the\r\nwasherwoman whose introduction into his family Napoleon III. had deeply\r\nresented, went on living with her son Roland, devoting herself to him\r\nand to his baby daughter. She never could learn what manners were, but\r\nshe was kind-hearted in spite of her vulgarity, and did good in every\r\nway she could. Prince Roland, on his side, had the tact never to be\r\nashamed of the humble origin of his mother, to surround her always with\r\nthe greatest respect, and to treat her with the most tender affection.\r\nShe did the honours of his house as well as she could, and unfortunately\r\nfor her, died before the marriage of her granddaughter, the Princess\r\nMarie Bonaparte, with Prince George of Greece, an event which, had she\r\nonly lived long enough to witness it, would have proved the supreme\r\nhappiness of her life.\r\n\r\nThis digression has led me far away from M. Emile Ollivier. I had the\r\nopportunity to see him on the day following the acquittal of Prince\r\nPierre Bonaparte, and was surprised to find him considerably irritated\r\nagainst M. Rouher, whom he accused of trying to influence the Emperor in\r\na direction contrary to the resolutions which the Sovereign had taken in\r\nconjunction with Ollivier himself. He seemed as if he wanted to find\r\nsomeone on whom he might vent his anger at his own mistakes. A phrase\r\nwhich he uttered on that day, but to which I did not pay any attention\r\nat the moment, struck me later on as the expression of a desire to\r\nregain a popularity he had lost:\r\n\r\n“Il nous faut maintenant à tout prix regagner notre popularité” (“We\r\nmust now at all costs win back our popularity”).\r\n\r\nIt was immediately after these troubled days that the important question\r\nof the Plebiscite was raised. It was violently opposed by M. Thiers and\r\nhis followers, and also by several of the Emperor’s personal friends,\r\nwho dreaded what it might mean to him. Even when its result ratified\r\nthe country’s confidence in the Empire and in the Emperor, they were not\r\ninspired with any greater confidence in the future. I remember that at a\r\ndinner which took place at the house of Marshal Canrobert and at which I\r\nwas present, M. Rouher, who was among the guests, remarked sadly that\r\nthere was nothing to be so very proud of in the results of the\r\nPlebiscite, because Paris had proved by its vote that it was distinctly\r\nhostile to the Government. “Et c’est Paris qui fait les révolutions et\r\nrenverse les gouvernements” (“And it is Paris which makes revolutions\r\nand upsets governments”), he concluded with a sigh.\r\n\r\nWithout being on intimate terms with him, I liked M. Rouher exceedingly.\r\nFor one thing, he was really the Emperor’s friend, and for another, when\r\nall is said and done, he was a statesman. It is not to be denied that he\r\nwas ambitious and liked power for power’s sake. He did not care so much\r\nfor the welfare of France as he did for that of the Bonaparte dynasty,\r\nbut he had a clear apprehension of all the political necessities of the\r\nmoment, and saw farther than those who were listened to with greater\r\nattention than himself. He did not perhaps like the Empress very much,\r\nbut he remained faithful to her, and out of respect for the place which\r\nshe occupied and the crown which she wore, always tried to uphold her\r\nprestige. He loved Napoleon III. truly and sincerely, and always gave\r\nhim disinterested advice. Like all strong men he had enemies, and like\r\nall sincere people he was accused of dissimulation and intrigue by those\r\nwho did not understand that to tell the truth is sometimes the best way\r\nnot to be believed.\r\n\r\nHe has been accused of having gathered immense riches whilst he was in\r\npower. I can testify that this has not been the case by far, and that\r\nwhen the “Second Emperor,” as he was sometimes called, died, he was\r\ncomparatively a poor man.\r\n\r\nSocially, M. Rouher was charming, and his conversation was most\r\nenjoyable. He had what French people call “le mot pour rire,” as well as\r\na marvellous skill for parrying questions addressed to him, and replying\r\nwithout answering anything. He had dignity, and gave constant proofs of\r\nit in his presidency of the Senate, where he displayed the rarest\r\nqualities of tact and skill.\r\n\r\nTalking of tact, leads me to say a few words respecting a personage who,\r\nto his own misfortune, as well as to that of other people, did not know\r\nthe significance of that word. It is of Prince Napoleon, Prince Plon\r\nPlon, as the Prussians called him, that I am thinking.\r\n\r\nThis first cousin of the Emperor was certainly a remarkable personage,\r\nand undoubtedly a most clever man. But evidently, also, a bad fairy had\r\npresided at his birth, and blighted with her magic wand all the great\r\nqualities with which nature had endowed him. His was essentially a\r\nrestless nature, incapable of contentment, even when it had what it\r\nwanted. Had he been Emperor he would have lived in opposition to\r\nhimself, _faute de mieux_. Of ambition he had a lot; of desires and\r\npassions even more, but he lacked an evenly balanced mind, and that most\r\nessential of all qualities, submission before accomplished facts and the\r\nthings that human will cannot change. His intelligence was sharp,\r\nbright, and clear; he was capable of resolution, and had initiative in\r\nhis character. He was gifted with rare eloquence, and, possessing also\r\nan easy pen, wrote pages that great writers would have felt proud to\r\nsign. He was brilliant, too, in conversation, and to all these talents\r\nhe added qualities that, joined with the prestige of his name, and of\r\nhis position, might have called him to great destinies, could he but\r\nhave learned how to use them. His existence was essentially one aptly\r\ndescribed by the French expression “une vie manquée,” and he was his own\r\nworst enemy. Always in opposition to his cousin he succeeded in rousing\r\nin revolt against himself not only the advisers of the Crown, but also\r\nthe Emperor, and especially the Empress. Eugénie, with whom he had been\r\nardently in love when she was still Mademoiselle de Montijo, was the\r\nobject of his especial animosity later on, and he never lost an\r\nopportunity of displaying it, forgetting even that she was a lady, and\r\nthat he should have shown himself a gentleman in his behaviour towards\r\nher. Among the survivors of the time none will have forgotten the\r\nscandal he caused at Compiègne when he refused to propose the health of\r\nthe Empress on the day of St. Eugénie, when the Emperor asked him to do\r\nso. On that occasion as on many others, he quite lost sight of the\r\npoliteness which a Sovereign and a woman has the right to expect, even\r\nfrom her worst enemies.\r\n\r\nPrince Napoleon was all his life in opposition to somebody or something,\r\nand by poetic justice before his death he was to experience the sorrow\r\nof finding his own son oppose him and his principles. Deception dogged\r\nhis footsteps, disappointment seemed to pursue him, for which he himself\r\nwas partly responsible, and partly the victim of circumstances. He is\r\nmore to be pitied than anything else. His life seemed to be spent in\r\nseeing withdrawn from his lips the cup that a wicked fairy kept\r\npresenting to him in order to tempt him with its contents.\r\n\r\nA good many of Prince Napoleon’s defects proceeded from a spirit of\r\nbravado, such as that which distinguished the Italian condottieri of\r\nold. He took a vicious pleasure in appearing to be what in reality he\r\nwas not, and in defying public opinion, as in the case of his famous\r\nGood Friday dinners, when he asked his best friends to help him to eat\r\nham and roast beef on an occasion when the gayest of gay Parisians would\r\nnot have dreamt of touching anything else but fish. His unorthodoxy was\r\nmore affected than sincere, more frequently it was adopted because it\r\namused him to shock people.\r\n\r\nHis wife, the virtuous Princess Clotilde of Savoy, was a saint in her\r\nlife and habits. She had absolutely no bond of sympathy with him, and\r\nmade him always feel that duty alone kept her at his side. She had\r\ngreat, noble, and even grand qualities, but her disposition was neither\r\namiable, nor sympathetic, and Prince Napoleon should have had a wife he\r\ncould love, rather than one whom he could only respect.\r\n\r\nWhen he died alone in Rome, within a stone’s throw from the palace where\r\nhis distinguished relative, Madame Mère, had ended her sad existence,\r\nand within sight of the chapel where rests the mortal remains of the\r\nPrincess Borghese, née Pauline Bonaparte, he was on terms of intimate\r\nfriendship with a lady well known in Paris society, the Marquise de\r\n----, whose salon is to this day the rendezvous of a certain circle of\r\npeople, among whom may be seen some enjoying a great social position,\r\nand about which I shall have something more to say later on. This lady\r\nwas passionately attached to Prince Napoleon, for whom she had\r\nsacrificed a good deal. She had been a beautiful woman, gifted with a\r\nsplendid voice, admired by many, and loved by not a few. Her devotion to\r\nthe Prince was admirable, but her presence at his bedside robbed his\r\nlast hours of dignity.\r\n\r\nHis widow, the Princess Clotilde, retired to the castle of Moncalieri,\r\nwhere she, too, died a few years ago, after having seen her eldest son,\r\nPrince Victor, married to the Princess Clementine of Belgium. Her\r\nyoungest boy, Prince Louis Napoleon, after serving for several years in\r\nthe ranks of the Russian army, lives now in comparative solitude, at the\r\ncastle of Prangins in Switzerland, having inherited the fortune of his\r\naunt, the Princess Mathilde. As for Princess Clotilde’s daughter, the\r\nPrincess Letitia Bonaparte, she married, under rather singular\r\ncircumstances, her uncle, the Duke of Aosta, the brother of King Humbert\r\nof Italy. When I use the words “singular circumstances,” I am alluding\r\nto the popular belief that the Duke had no particular intention of\r\nmarrying his niece. The Princess Letitia, however, had inherited the\r\nardent temperament of her father, Prince Napoleon. The Duke died shortly\r\nafter the marriage. At present the widowed Duchess of Aosta spends part\r\nof her time in Turin, and part in Paris, where she has an apartment in\r\nthe Hotel de Castiglione, Rue de Rivoli, and enjoys herself as much as\r\nshe possibly can, being a general favourite everywhere.\r\n\r\nAfter the Plebiscite, it was generally felt that some changes in the\r\nCabinet of M. Emile Ollivier had become imperative, especially as its\r\nprincipal members, M. Buffet and M. Daru, were not entirely in accord\r\nwith M. Ollivier, being more or less under the influence of Thiers, who\r\nhad been a resolute adversary of the Plebiscite. The portfolio of\r\nForeign Affairs, becoming vacant owing to the retirement of Comte\r\nNapoleon Daru, was offered to the Duc de Gramont, who accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Gramont, among all the people who had rallied to the Empire,\r\nwas the one whose adherence had caused the most pleasure at the\r\nTuileries. He had been the favourite of the Duchess d’Angoulême, the\r\ndaughter of Louis XVI. and of Marie Antoinette, and had inspired such a\r\ndeep affection in that severe Princess, that she had left him a large\r\nfortune, from which he derived an income of about one million francs.\r\nAll his family traditions were connected with those of the House of\r\nBourbon, and one would have thought that nothing could have made him\r\nswerve from his allegiance to the Comte de Chambord. When he forsook his\r\nformer masters, and enlisted among the followers of the Napoleonic\r\ndynasty, there was great rejoicing at this unhoped-for and unexpected\r\ndefection, and great bitterness at Frohsdorf. The Empress Eugénie\r\nlavished her best and most amiable smiles on the descendant of the\r\nfamous Corisande, and very soon the Duke found himself the cherished\r\nguest at all the festivities that took place, either at Fontainebleau or\r\nat Compiègne, or the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nHe was made an ambassador at Vienna, no one knew why, presumably for no\r\nother reason than that it was necessary to make something out of him,\r\nand to shower honours and dignities on his head. He did not make himself\r\nliked in Austria, and the statesmen with whom he found himself thrown\r\ninto contact did not form a high opinion of his diplomatic talents. He\r\nfelt himself secretly despised, and being of an ambitious turn of mind,\r\nhe wanted to do something very striking in order to make himself\r\nappreciated by others to the same degree as he appreciated himself.\r\n\r\nIt was with joy he accepted the portfolio of Foreign Affairs, and the\r\nfirst time he presented himself before Eugénie after his appointment he\r\ntold her rather theatrically: “Les intérêts de la France ont été remis\r\nen de bonnes mains par l’Empereur, Madame, soyez en sûre” (“The\r\ninterests of France have been confided by the Emperor into good hands,\r\nrest assured of that, Madame”).\r\n\r\nI did not know the Duc de Gramont well, and for that reason refrain from\r\njudging him. He has been accused of being the most guilty among the many\r\nguilty people to whom the responsibility of the unfortunate\r\nFranco-German War may be attributed. Doctor Evans, in the very\r\ninteresting memoirs published after his death, relates that at the time\r\nof the Duke’s appointment at the head of foreign affairs, a foreign\r\nstatesman whom he knew well used the following ominous words: “Believe\r\nme, this nomination is the forewarning of a Franco-German war.”\r\n\r\nIt would not be fair to go as far as that, but I will say that the Duke\r\nwas attacked more than any of his colleagues with the _folie des\r\ngrandeurs_. Moreover, he was suffering acutely from the national vanity\r\nwhich felt itself thoroughly convinced that nothing could resist the\r\ncourage of the French army. It did not strike him that this courage\r\nwould be of no avail in the presence of the perfect discipline of the\r\nfoe it would have to meet.\r\n\r\nI must say, when I look back on this period which preceded the war, that\r\na general uneasiness had pervaded the public mind ever since the\r\nconstitution of the Ministry presided over by Emile Ollivier. No one\r\ntrusted it, even among the personal friends of its head, and as a very\r\nclever woman, the Vicomtesse de Janzé, now Princesse de Lucinge, said at\r\nthe time: “Its enemies do not trust it, and its supporters do not like\r\nit.” The words were cruel, but very true.\r\n\r\nThe last twelve months of the Empire’s existence saw vanish from the\r\npolitical, and indeed from this earthly scene, three men who had once\r\nplayed a considerable part in the world, and whose names are remembered\r\nto this day: Montalembert, Berryer, and Lamartine. I never saw\r\nLamartine, but had the honour to know Montalembert well, and to have\r\nbeen received often by Berryer, whose great figure considerably\r\nimpressed me. It was impossible to feel for him anything else but the\r\ndeepest, the most sincere respect. He was an admirable example of\r\nfidelity to principles, of convictions that the vicissitudes of life\r\ncannot change, and that even the errors of those who represent them\r\ncannot weaken. He died as he had lived, a Legitimist, believing in the\r\ndivine right of kings, and determined to uphold his ideals to the end.\r\nThroughout his career he retained a wide sympathy in his estimates of\r\nmen and of things, and an indulgence for the imperfections of those with\r\nwhom he came into contact. Though he would permit no compromise with his\r\nown conscience, he realised very well that other people were different,\r\nand that he must make allowances. Though very disdainful, he was not\r\nvindictive in his old age, whatever he might have been in his youth, and\r\nthe admirable serenity which pervaded all his judgments and opinions\r\nreminded me very often of the beautiful sunset of a beautiful day.\r\n\r\nMontalembert, though broken by illness more than by old age, had,\r\nnevertheless, kept some of that brilliant and caustic wit for which he\r\nhad been famous, and which had amused me so much when I first saw him in\r\nthe early ’sixties. He was of that school of French Catholics who had\r\nnever been able to shake off the influence of Lamennais, and to whom the\r\nexuberance of men like Veuillot was simply insufferable. The question of\r\nthe Papal infallibility, which had been submitted by Pius IX. to the\r\nVatican Council just before his death, had been the last great\r\npreoccupation of Montalembert, who could not reconcile himself to what,\r\nin his eyes, was a disastrous measure. His religion was of the broadest,\r\nand in his last years he looked at things with less partisan enthusiasm,\r\nand more clearness of judgment. I believe that in his inmost heart he\r\nregretted sometimes having violently separated himself from Lamennais,\r\nwith whom he had worked on the famous paper _L’Avenir_. He never owned\r\nit, however; he always said that intentions were what must be considered\r\nand thought of, and that it was by their intentions, more than by their\r\nactions, that people ought to be judged. In his way Charles de\r\nMontalembert was just as great a figure as Berryer, whom he only\r\nsurvived by a few months.\r\n\r\nAs for Lamartine, his death brought back to the public mind all the\r\nevents which had preceded the proclamation of the Second Empire, and\r\nthat period during which he had been at the head of the Republic, whose\r\ntriumph he was not destined to see. Cruel material losses had reduced\r\nhim almost to penury, and his only means of existence was a pension\r\nwhich, unknown to many, he received from the private purse of the\r\nEmperor, who had had the delicacy to extend it to him in such a way that\r\nthe poor poet never knew to whom he owed the gift.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of one of the nicest remarks that Napoleon III. ever\r\nmade in his life. When he was asked why he insisted so much on Lamartine\r\nnever learning who was his secret benefactor, the Emperor replied that\r\n“France owed so much to M. de Lamartine, that it would be a great shame\r\nif he was made to feel he had need to be grateful to its Sovereign.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1869 had come to an end under a cloud, which even the Empress’s\r\ntriumphs in Egypt and at Constantinople had not brightened. Napoleon\r\nIII. was worried, not only by the political situation, but also by the\r\nstate of his health. Notwithstanding the absence of his Consort he\r\ninvited people to Compiègne as usual, and there several persons besides\r\nmyself noticed that he looked ill and tired, and that his eyes had an\r\nanxious expression which had never been observable before. He showed\r\nhimself even more affectionate than usual towards his son, and was heard\r\nsometimes to sigh whilst watching him. Nevertheless, no one suspected\r\nthat anything was radically wrong, and not a single man or woman among\r\nthose who were gathered in the Castle thought that it was the last time\r\nthat they would be the guests of the Sovereign who welcomed them with\r\nsuch kindness and affability. Among all those who passed their hours in\r\namusement in the Salle des Gardes, or in the long gallery where meals\r\nwere served, not one recognised that a hand was already writing on the\r\nwall the same fatal words that appeared during the Babylonian monarch’s\r\nlast banquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the candidature of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern to\r\nthe Spanish throne reached me, together with a letter from my Ambassador\r\nurging my return to Paris, I was staying in a little village on the\r\ncoast of Normandy. Though I started at once for the capital, I could\r\nhardly bring myself to believe in the possibility of a war between\r\nFrance and Prussia. The thing appeared to me to be quite impossible,\r\nespecially in view of a conversation I had had with the Emperor\r\nimmediately after the results of the Plebiscite of May, 1870, had become\r\nknown. I had ventured to offer to the Sovereign my congratulations upon\r\nthe new triumph he had obtained. Napoleon III. seemed also delighted,\r\nand though it was most unusual for him to be demonstrative, yet he did\r\nnot, on that occasion, attempt to hide what he was feeling, going so far\r\nas to tell me that the results of the Plebiscite in his opinion “had not\r\nonly consolidated the dynasty, but also had done away with the legend\r\nthat represented him as desirous of a foreign war in order to add to his\r\nprestige.” “No one can say so at present,” added the Emperor, “because,\r\nafter France has so positively affirmed its allegiance to the Empire, it\r\nwould be madness for me to risk losing popularity through a war which,\r\neven if victorious, would always materially impoverish the country.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. did not seem to have noticed that M. Rouher had at once\r\nobserved that the vote of Paris had been distinctly hostile to him, and\r\nthat as things were organised, it was Paris which overthrew dynasties\r\nand governments.\r\n\r\nBut that wisdom which is born of attentive observation of the events of\r\nthe world, as well as of outward and sometimes insignificant\r\ncircumstances that lead on to their development, seemed to be absent\r\nfrom the thoughts of the principal politicians who, at that particular\r\nmoment of her history, held in their hands the destinies of France.\r\nNeither the Emperor nor his responsible advisers saw farther than the\r\nvictory of the moment, and they all rejoiced together at the new triumph\r\nwhich they had won for themselves, as well as for the party which they\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Plebiscite, I happened to be calling on a social\r\ncelebrity, the Countess de Castiglione, about whom so much has been\r\nwritten and said. Nature had been generous to her in many ways, but she\r\nwas not destined to keep her fairness much longer than a rose its\r\nfreshness. At the time of which I am speaking, she had barely reached\r\nher thirtieth year, and was already the ghost of her former self. I\r\ndon’t think I have ever met a woman who faded so quickly; I have often\r\nthought about it, and come to the conclusion that her beauty was so\r\ndazzling that it obliterated the imperfections it possessed, just as the\r\nNeapolitan or Sicilian sun prevents us from noticing aught else but the\r\nbrilliance of the places it lights up with its rays. At the first\r\nglance, her loveliness literally took one’s breath away, as it did mine\r\nthe first time I saw her in 1868, when already she was going down hill.\r\nI can therefore imagine what she must have been at the time she first\r\nstartled Paris by her glorious complexion and extraordinary beauty, and\r\nconquered the senses if not the heart of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nMadame de Castiglione, without being the very clever woman she has been\r\nrepresented by some, nor the stupid one she has been described by\r\nothers, was possessed of an intelligence that was certainly above the\r\naverage, but completely spoiled, her severe critics said, by an\r\ninordinate vanity, which prostrated her at the feet of her own beauty,\r\nand made everything in her life subservient to it. She firmly believed\r\nthat she had only to show herself to conquer, and in a certain sense it\r\nwas quite true, until the numerous victims of her charms learned to know\r\nher well. She had been sent to France by her cousin, the great Cavour,\r\nwith a mission to influence Napoleon III. in favour of the cause of\r\nItalian independence. In a certain sense she succeeded, though much of\r\nher success can be attributed to the personal sympathies of the Emperor\r\nas well as to the rash promises of which had been so generous in regard\r\nto the various secret societies and associations with which he had been\r\nconnected in his youth. But he was a master in the art of flattery, and\r\nit pleased his fancy to allow the young and lovely woman to think that\r\nshe, and she alone, had been the means of Italy attaining her liberty.\r\nMadame de Castiglione thereafter took herself _au sérieux_, and believed\r\nshe was a political heroine.\r\n\r\nLater on, however, clouds came to obscure the horizon of her successes;\r\nthe sensation caused by the lovely Italian very soon vanished, and\r\nthough she was talked about a great deal in society, though painters\r\nstill raved about her, and old men devoured her with their eyes, whilst\r\nyoung ones sighed at her feet, though women grew green with envy when\r\nthey saw her enter a room, certain it is that her success was neither a\r\nlong nor a permanent one. As a dream she flitted through that brilliant,\r\nfrivolous society of the Second Empire, and as a dream she vanished into\r\nthe darkness of the night that overtook it.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing in the career of Madame de Castiglione was the way in\r\nwhich she used to come and go, the eclipses her personality underwent,\r\nand the notoriety that, now and then, arose in regard to her. There had\r\nbeen a day when she was asked to leave France altogether, but then she\r\nvery soon returned to it, more arrogant, more haughty, more than ever\r\nardent in resuming a political rôle. But she did not like Napoleon III.,\r\nwhom, perhaps, she did not forgive for the light-heartedness with which,\r\nafter all, he had treated her. Though she would never have owned to it,\r\nshe knew in her inmost heart that he had taken her as he would have\r\ntaken any other pretty woman weak enough to have been dazzled. Madame de\r\nCastiglione was then in the glory of her youth and beauty, and she may\r\nwell be forgiven. Principles she had few, religion and morals still\r\nless, or she would not, upon more occasions than one, have forgotten the\r\ngreat name she bore, or the high social position she enjoyed, and\r\naccepted, for instance, the banknotes of Lord Hertford, and of many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nA curious trait in that celebrated woman’s character was her pride in\r\nwhat others generally hid from the eyes of the world. A characteristic\r\nanecdote can be told on this subject. One day, as one of the very few\r\nfriends she had left was talking with her of that period of the Empire\r\nwhen she had been its brightest star, suddenly Madame de Castiglione\r\nexclaimed: “I shall take care that even after I am dead the world shall\r\nknow how great I was whilst it lasted”; and with a cynicism such as she\r\nalone would have been capable of, she rang the bell, and turning towards\r\nthe maid who had appeared in answer to it, “Luisa,” she said, “montrez à\r\nMonsieur, la chemise de nuit de Compiègne.” And when an elaborate\r\ngarment all batiste and lace was brought to her, she added: “I shall\r\nleave instructions to bury it with me.”\r\n\r\nTo come back to what I was saying at the beginning of this chapter, I\r\nhad called upon Madame de Castiglione just after the Plebiscite, and\r\nnaturally the conversation turned towards that event. The Countess\r\nlistened very seriously to all the remarks exchanged between the two or\r\nthree people who were present in the room, and at last surprised us\r\nconsiderably by saying: “You are all mistaken; the Plebiscite will not\r\nconsolidate the dynasty. Up to now neither Italy nor Prussia thought\r\nthat it could maintain itself _à la longue_ in France, where it was\r\nfirmly believed that no political regime was able to last beyond a few\r\nyears. The results of the Plebiscite have proved that this conviction\r\nwas an erroneous one; and the consequences will be that both these\r\nnations will use their best endeavours to inveigle the Emperor into a\r\nwar. It is very well known that France is unprepared. Such an event will\r\nnaturally throw her back into a state of revolution, and for a time will\r\nwipe her off the European slate.”\r\n\r\nNo reply was made to this extraordinary remark, but when we went out\r\ntogether with Alphonse Rothschild, who had been one of those who had\r\nheard her, he turned to me and said with the clear insight of a\r\nfinancier, combined with the cleverness of a diplomat and his experience\r\nof the world: “How that woman hates the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nAnd now as I was hastening back to Paris on that July day of the year\r\n1870, I remembered both the remark of the Baron and the tone of\r\nanimosity with which the Countess de Castiglione had spoken on that\r\noccasion, and something like apprehension suddenly seized me,\r\napprehension I did not know of what, but of a danger which I felt rather\r\nthan saw, swooping down upon this brilliant society of the Second\r\nEmpire, which I had grown to like so much and so well.\r\n\r\nI reached Paris late in the evening of July the 16th, twenty-four hours\r\nafter war had been declared, and was struck by the extraordinary aspect\r\nof the people who crowded the boulevards. Much to my surprise they were\r\nsinging the forbidden Marseillaise, and altogether they presented an\r\nexcited appearance. The cafés were full, and from time to time someone\r\nwould stand up, and scream loudly: “À Berlin!” whereupon the mob took up\r\nthat cry, and vociferated in its turn, “À Berlin! À Berlin!” All Paris\r\nseemed to have gone mad, but already, in spite of what has been said to\r\nthe contrary, remarks were heard hostile to the Emperor and to the\r\ngovernment, who, it was said, had not soon enough tried to avenge the\r\ninsult which France had received, but had done their best to prevent the\r\noutbreak of a war which, as someone remarked in my presence that same\r\nevening, “was indispensable to the dignity and the greatness of the\r\ncountry.” To attempt reasoning with such folly was out of the question.\r\nI stopped the cab which had brought me from the station, and, alighting\r\nnear one of the cafés on the boulevards, sat down under the pretext of\r\nhaving something to drink, but in reality to observe the scenes that\r\nwere taking place. All the windows and balconies were full of people\r\nlooking down in the street below, and watching the movement of the\r\ncrowd, listening to its warlike cries. And later, when the theatres were\r\nover, the boulevards seemed to fill even more than they had been before.\r\nWomen appeared wearing the national colours, and above the noise, the\r\nshouts, the movements of that great agglomeration of human beings,\r\nresounded again one great acclamation, one immense cry: “À Berlin! À\r\nBerlin!”\r\n\r\nWhen at last I reached our Embassy, I found that consternation\r\nprevailed; not at the war, though everybody agreed that anything more\r\nfoolish than the circumstances that had led to it had never been seen,\r\nbut at the weakness displayed by the government, which certainly ought\r\nto have checked that exuberance of public opinion, and prevented\r\nmanifestations that at any moment might turn against itself. Then\r\nsurprise was expressed at the disorderly attitude displayed by the\r\ntroops when starting for the frontier, as already one or two regiments\r\nhad done that morning. No one ventured to make a prediction as to what\r\nthe future was holding in reserve, but serious apprehensions were\r\nentertained concerning the ultimate fate of the Emperor and of his\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nThat last feeling was very general, and I found it prevailed among all\r\nthe foreigners then at Paris. Two or three days after my return to the\r\ncapital, I called upon an old friend of mine, Madame Jules Lacroix, an\r\nextraordinary old woman, a Russian by birth, whose sister was the widow\r\nof the novelist Balzac, and who had made her home in France ever since\r\nher marriage with M. Lacroix, the brother of the famous novelist known\r\nunder the pseudonym of “Bibliophile Jacob.” Madame Lacroix presided over\r\none of the pleasantest salons of the time; within its walls one was\r\nalways sure to meet some important and interesting persons. She had been\r\na great friend of Morny, and though her family had been Legitimists--she\r\nused to boast of her alliances with the Bourbons through Queen Marie\r\nLeszczinska, her aunt many times removed--all her sympathies were with\r\nthe Napoleonic dynasty. She possessed a villa in St. Germain, where she\r\nused to spend her summers, and was there at the time the war broke out.\r\nI went to dine with her in the endeavour to find out something about the\r\nevents that had brought about the present crisis.\r\n\r\nMadame Lacroix received me with effusion, and talked of little else than\r\nthe war, and of the consequences it would have. To my great surprise,\r\nhowever, I did not find her by any means so enthusiastic as I had\r\nexpected, rather she was subdued and anxious. She related to me that her\r\ngreat friend General Castelnau, one of the aides-de-camp of the Emperor,\r\nwho was later on to share his captivity, did not look at the situation\r\nwith over-confident eyes, and that he had given her to understand that\r\nhe had some apprehensions as to the ability of the army to come out\r\nvictorious from the struggle it was about to enter.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor is more ill than one supposes,” added Madame Lacroix, “and\r\nshould his strength fail him, who can take his place at the head of the\r\narmy? Indeed, it would be far better if he did not attempt at all to\r\nlead it, because his presence in Paris will be more necessary than at\r\nthe frontier. Suppose a revolution breaks out here, who is to confront\r\nit? The Empress is too unpopular through her clerical leanings to\r\ninspire confidence in a nation that has lost every respect for priests\r\nand their protectors.”\r\n\r\nSeveral episodes were then related concerning the deliberations which\r\nhad taken place at St. Cloud during the momentous days before the solemn\r\nquestion of war or peace had been decided. It seems that when the first\r\ntelegrams from Berlin announcing the candidature of Prince Leopold of\r\nHohenzollern for the Spanish throne had arrived in Paris, the Duke de\r\nGramont had immediately sent them to the Emperor, though it was in the\r\nmiddle of the night, and that in a long conversation which he had\r\nsubsequently held with his Sovereign, he had insisted on the affront\r\nsuch a candidature represented for France. Why it was an affront\r\nprobably the Duke himself could not have properly explained.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the Empress, who was afterwards to be represented as\r\nhaving done all that was in her power to decide Napoleon to declare war\r\nagainst Prussia, had been far from urging him to it, if we are to\r\nbelieve what I heard on that day at Madame Lacroix’s. It seems that when\r\nit was found to be impossible to resist the public clamour for revenge\r\nagainst this insolence of Prussia, as the chauvinists, who held the\r\nupper hand at that moment, were pleased to call the Hohenzollern\r\ncandidature, the Empress was very much upset, and to General Castelnau,\r\nwho saw her come out from her room with red eyes and in great agitation,\r\nshe said that she felt very anxious and very much afraid at the\r\nresponsibility that was to become hers when she would be left as Regent\r\nalone in Paris. The General then advised her not to allow the Prince\r\nImperial to accompany his father to the frontier, upon which she\r\nexclaimed: “Oh! I can’t keep him here, he will be much safer amidst the\r\narmy than with me!” Singular remark for a mother to make.\r\n\r\nAltogether it seems to me, from what I had opportunity to hear, that at\r\nthis crisis of her life Eugénie entirely lost her head, and that from\r\nits very outset allowed outward circumstances and impressions to obscure\r\nher clear judgment. I have been told that she was extremely\r\nsuperstitious, and firmly believed that what she once described in one\r\nof her conversations with an intimate friend as “the obstinacy” of the\r\nEmperor in not imposing the weight of his authority upon King Victor\r\nEmmanuel, to oblige him to abandon his secret ambitions to annex to his\r\ncrown the territory of the Holy See, would prove fatal to him as well as\r\nto the Bonaparte dynasty. She was a fervent and devout Catholic and, in\r\naddition to her misgivings as to the future, feared the wrath of God.\r\n\r\nI was not present when the Emperor left St. Cloud and looked for the\r\nlast time on his home of so many happy years, but I am told that nothing\r\ncould be sadder than this departure, so very different from that other\r\noccasion, some ten years before, when, amidst the hurrahs of the\r\nParisian population, he had started for the Italian frontier to take\r\npart in a struggle the end of which had been so glorious. And yet the\r\npresent war was a great deal more popular than had been that of 1859.\r\nNot only was it desired, but almost imposed on the Sovereign, by a\r\nnation who would never have forgiven him had he not acceded to her\r\nwishes. And yet, when Napoleon took leave of his wife, his Ministers,\r\nand the members of his household, on that eventful 28th of July, though\r\nfew eyes were dry in bidding him good-bye, the country over which he had\r\nruled for eighteen years did not unite in wishing him God-speed. On the\r\neve of the greatest catastrophe of modern times, an atmosphere of\r\nforeboding was already making itself felt in the sadness of that early\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sovereign had gone, a period of anxious waiting ensued. Paris\r\ngot wilder and wilder, became more and more riotous. One of the\r\nEmpress’s familiar friends called upon her one day at St. Cloud, before\r\nshe had left that residence to return to the capital, and thought it his\r\nduty to draw her attention to that fact, and to express to her his\r\napprehensions that the excitement might have serious consequences should\r\nany reverse happen to the army. She replied with vivacity: “Oh, not only\r\nin case of reverse, also in case of victory, the nation only wants a\r\npretext to get rid of us.”\r\n\r\nThese words are remarkable, and, so far as I know, no one had voiced\r\nsuch sentiments before; they reveal on the part of the Regent a state of\r\ndiscouragement which explains, perhaps, her total collapse when the\r\ndreaded crisis at last occurred; maybe it was this belief which led to\r\nthe indifference with which she submitted to a destiny which she had\r\naccepted as foreordained, and against which she had recognised the utter\r\nfutility of rebelling.\r\n\r\nShe was leading a feverish existence, which left her little time to\r\nthink over her difficult position, or to make plans concerning her own\r\nfuture. After having tried to imbibe the enthusiasm with which she was\r\ntold the declaration of war against Prussia had been received in the\r\nwhole of France, she was now realising how little grounds there had been\r\nfor it. Before even the earliest news of the first disasters of this\r\ndeplorable campaign had been brought to her, she had prepared herself\r\nfor the worst, and believed in the worst, though when that worst came it\r\nwas to surpass all that she had most dreaded or imagined.\r\n\r\nBefore she decided to leave St. Cloud, she went for a walk in the park\r\nwith one of her ladies in waiting. On the last evening she gave way to\r\nthe apprehensions that were torturing her soul. The sun was setting\r\nafter a glorious day, and the Imperial residence had never seemed so\r\nbeautiful, nor so peaceful; a peace in such contrast to the agitation of\r\nthe country, that the Empress could not refrain from remarking upon it.\r\nHer companion tried to cheer her with words of hope and encouragement:\r\n“No,” replied Eugénie, “I have no hope left, and if I could still wish\r\nfor something, it would be to stop the course of time; to have a few\r\nmore hours to look upon St. Cloud and its gardens; but see,” she added,\r\nand pointed with her hand towards the sun that was slowly disappearing\r\nbelow the horizon, “see, this is how our prosperity is also setting, and\r\nwho knows what will happen in the night that is falling upon us!”\r\n\r\nAnd covering her face with her hands, she who was still Empress of the\r\nFrench sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DISASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, I had just obtained a long leave which I\r\nintended to spend in Russia, and immediately after my return to Paris\r\nbegan to make preparations for my departure. The situation, however, was\r\ngetting so very interesting that I kept putting off my vacation from day\r\nto day, especially after the first reverses had proved to every\r\nimpartial observer that the days of the Bonaparte dynasty were numbered.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, imagined that the campaign would so very quickly decide\r\nthe momentous questions that were hanging in the balance. The government\r\nwas doing its very best to prevent news from leaking out and to hide\r\nfrom Paris, as well as from the country in general, the extent of the\r\nfirst reverses that the French army had encountered. This was a great\r\nmistake in more senses than one, because it allowed the wildest rumours\r\nto get about, which would not have been possible had the truth been made\r\nknown at once. Had she only shown frankness and decision, the Regent\r\nmight still have succeeded in rallying around her a considerable\r\nproportion of the people desirous of maintaining public order. To secure\r\nthat, her best course would have been to appeal publicly to the whole\r\nnation; to point out that the refusal of the Chambers to grant the\r\nnecessary military credits the government had asked for a year before\r\nhad contributed to the disaster that had overtaken France; and then to\r\ndeclare that she was going to do her best to negotiate an honourable\r\npeace. Above all things she should never have convoked the Chambers, the\r\nmore so that constitutionally she had no real right to do so. The\r\nEmperor himself pointed this out later on, in a memorandum which he\r\nwrote for one of his great friends, Le Comte de la Chapelle, and he very\r\njustly remarked that by doing it a pretext was given for revolution to\r\nbreak out. But the impulsive Empress only thought that the return of\r\nNapoleon, vanquished and defeated in his capital, would expose him to\r\ninsult, and endanger the dynasty; therefore, she urged him to keep away.\r\n\r\nÉmile Ollivier, who had judged differently, entreated her to insist on\r\nNapoleon’s return to Paris, but Eugénie, instead of listening to his\r\nadvice, did her best to thwart it, under the mistaken idea that with\r\nanother Cabinet she had more chances to meet the difficulties of the\r\nsituation. From some strange reasoning she interfered with MacMahon’s\r\nplan to draw his army back towards Paris in order to defend the capital,\r\nand gave him peremptory command to join Marshal Bazaine’s army. Stranger\r\nstill, MacMahon, who, being responsible for his troops, should not have\r\nallowed politics to interfere with his plan of campaign, acceded to her\r\nrequest, and marched to his destruction in the direction of Sedan.\r\n\r\nThat initial mistake of the Regent was the principal cause of the\r\nrevolution which followed upon the surrender of the French army to the\r\nPrussians. I do not mean to say that this revolution might have been\r\naverted in the long run, but certainly it might have been delayed, and\r\nsome attempts might have been made to save the dynasty. Unfortunately\r\nthe Empress thought she was acting very cleverly by seeming to give no\r\nthought to that dynasty, and affecting indifference as to its fate. She\r\nallowed the romantic side of her character to take the upper hand even\r\nin that supreme disaster of her life, and refused to give the necessary\r\norders that might, perhaps, have averted a catastrophe not only where\r\nthe Imperial regime was concerned, but also to the country. She refused\r\nto defend the Tuileries; she refused to defend the cause of order which\r\nshe represented; she refused to defend her throne and that of her son;\r\nshe refused to act energetically, in order to subdue the insurrection\r\nthat was already making itself heard under her windows; she refused to\r\nmeet the mob that was invading the palace; and ultimately she fled.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that she was betrayed by those upon whose devotion she\r\nhad the right to count. It is not to be contested that the conduct of\r\nGeneral Trochu was cowardly, but the misfortune of Eugénie was that she\r\nhad never succeeded in inspiring any other feeling than admiration for\r\nher beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary, when one remembers all that happened at that time,\r\nto realise how each and all lost their heads. There was still a\r\ngovernment in Paris on the 4th of September, there was an army, a\r\nresponsible ministry that might have appealed to it, and yet no one\r\nseemed to have thought it possible to resist the demands of the mob--and\r\nsuch a mob, too. I think I may affirm that none were more surprised at\r\nthe easy way the Empire was overturned than the members of the\r\ngovernment that succeeded to the administration of the country. As a\r\nproof of this, I may mention a remark made to me many years later by\r\nGambetta in the course of a conversation which we had on the subject: “I\r\ndid not know when I left the Hotel de Ville after the proclamation of\r\nthe new government, whether I should not find the police waiting to\r\narrest me when I reached my home,” was what he said.\r\n\r\nHad the Empress personally gone to the Corps Législatif and given orders\r\nto sweep away the mob about to invade it, and to arrest Trochu, it is\r\nprobable that the Parisians, cowed by her personal courage, would have\r\nacclaimed her, and cried out: “Vive l’Impératrice!” It is certain that\r\nno one would have harmed her, but Eugénie lost her presence of mind upon\r\nfinding herself so utterly abandoned, and fled from the Tuileries,\r\nforgetting everything in the disorder of that moment.\r\n\r\nVague news concerning the disaster of Sedan had reached Paris in the\r\ncourse of the evening of the 2nd of September, rumours with no official\r\nauthority to explain them, but which, nevertheless, circulated\r\neverywhere. Later on the Empress was reproached for not acting at once\r\nupon them by rallying around her the few partisans that were still left\r\nto the Empire. But she was not to blame for this apparent inactivity,\r\nbecause it was only the next day that she received the telegram from the\r\nEmperor confirming the dreadful news.\r\n\r\nAmong the diplomatic corps it had been known earlier, and commented upon\r\nas it deserved. In the late afternoon of the 3rd of September, I went\r\nout, and directed my steps towards the Tuileries. The palace seemed\r\nquite peaceful. The usual sentinels that were guarding it were all at\r\ntheir posts, and a crowd on the Place de la Concorde was neither\r\nnumerous nor hostile, certainly nothing that pointed to insurrection.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious people that were standing in front of the palace I\r\ncould hear remarks and comments on the catastrophe of the day before,\r\nbut what struck me was that these remarks were not hostile to the\r\nEmpire; on the contrary, words of regret were continually expressed, and\r\nmany sympathised with the Emperor, and especially the Prince Imperial.\r\nAfter having waited for some time I turned my steps towards the Cercle\r\nde la Rue Royale, where, meeting some friends, I told them that I was\r\nsurprised to find the capital so quiet, and that I thought that the\r\nEmpress would be well advised if she took advantage of this sympathetic\r\nattitude of the public, to attempt to negotiate a peace. Every\r\nwell-wisher of France felt that peace was indispensable in order to\r\navoid worse calamities. I was very much surprised when a man whom I knew\r\nto be well informed as a rule, replied that very probably the next day\r\nwould see a proposition promulgated to depose the Emperor. He added the\r\nremarkable news--which surely was absurd--that this would be done at the\r\nsecret instigation of the Regent, who believed the Prince Imperial’s\r\nonly chance of ascending the throne consisted in the removal of his\r\nfather from the political scene.\r\n\r\nI could not bring myself to believe such an unfair canard. Whatever has\r\nbeen said to the contrary since, Napoleon was always popular with a\r\nlarge section of people; the Parisian workmen especially liked him, and\r\nfelt grateful for the care with which he had seen to their welfare. It\r\nis true there were some who screamed that he was responsible for the\r\nmilitary disasters which had overtaken the country, but these belonged\r\nto that section of unruly spirits that take every possible opportunity\r\nto attack every government. It must not be forgotten that in spite of\r\nthe _Lanterne_ and other revolutionary organs of the same kind, the\r\ninfluence wielded by the press had not reached the power it now\r\npossesses; after eighteen years of Imperialistic rule, the country was\r\ndisciplined and trained to obedience, and it is most probable that had\r\nthe Emperor personally been able to make an appeal to it, it would have\r\nresponded heartily. If the Regent could have obtained the liberation of\r\nher husband, and so secured his help to conclude peace with Prussia,\r\nsuch an ending to the campaign might have been possible at that\r\nparticular moment--it was certainly not the time to talk of the\r\nsovereignty of the people and of bowing to the will of the country.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed off quietly. I walked along the boulevards after\r\neleven o’clock; the night was beautiful, and the streets as animated as\r\nusual. I could not discern much consternation among the crowds, everyone\r\nseemed only to be more subdued than had been the case lately. And when I\r\nleft my house on the morning of the 4th there were certainly no signs\r\nwhatever of a revolution in the streets, nor any atmosphere of impending\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nI was living in the Avenue de l’Impératrice, now Avenue du Bois de\r\nBoulogne, and as I reached the Champs Elysées, I found that everything\r\nwas as quiet as usual. The fountains were playing in front of the Palais\r\nde l’Industrie, children were romping in the walks, and there was no\r\nindication that anything unusual was going on. I went to breakfast at\r\nthe Cercle, and it was only after leaving that I was accosted by a\r\nfriend on the Place de la Concorde who told me that the Corps Législatif\r\nhad been invaded by the mob. Curious as I am by nature, I turned my\r\nsteps towards the Palais Bourbon, and found really an enormous crowd\r\nassembled there; but even then, there was nothing hostile in its\r\nattitude, it was rather good-humoured than anything else. Some leaders,\r\nhowever, were shouting: “La déchéance! La déchéance,” at the top of\r\ntheir voices. No one seemed to offer any resistance, and the attitude of\r\nthe deputies, when I managed to enter the gallery reserved to the Corps\r\nDiplomatique in order to obtain a view of what was going on inside the\r\nHouse, was rather one of surprise than anything else. Amidst the hum of\r\nvoices could be heard the deep tones of M. Jules Ferry urging those\r\npresent to go to the Hotel de Ville and to proclaim the Republic, but\r\nwith the exception of Jules Favre, and of M. de Kératry, no one seemed\r\nto share his opinion. I am convinced that if, at that moment, the Regent\r\nhad occupied the Palais Bourbon with a military force, the Revolution\r\nwould never have succeeded, and to this day I fail to understand how it\r\nwas that no member of the government had the presence of mind to take\r\nupon himself the responsibility for such a measure, which might have\r\nchanged the whole history of France. It is quite certain that even when\r\nthe three leaders of the Revolutionary movement started for the Hotel de\r\nVille, they did not possess the sympathy of many of their colleagues,\r\nrather, the latter only wanted the support of the government then in\r\npower, to get rid of them. None would have objected to the arrest of\r\nthese three men, had there been found but one person strong enough to\r\nput such a measure into execution.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the majority of the members of the Corps Législatif seemed\r\nto be quite dazed by what was happening; they did not at all understand\r\nwhat was going on. I am convinced that they left the hall where the\r\nsitting had taken place, without having realised that it was for the\r\nlast time. As soon, however, as they had done so, the mob invaded the\r\nPalais; but the scenes of disorder that are asserted to have followed,\r\nnever took place. I remained some time unobserved at my post, and failed\r\nto see the excesses of which some speak as occurring. Of course, shouts\r\nwere heard, a boy of about eighteen years old sat down in the\r\nPresidential armchair, and rang the bell with all his might, but this\r\nwas done more in childish amusement than anything else. I repeat that\r\nthe slightest appearance of a military force would have restored order\r\nat once, and this makes the subsequent events more unpardonable still.\r\n\r\nAfter having spent about an hour watching the scenes that attended the\r\nend of the Legislature which, under Napoleon III., had ruled France for\r\neighteen years, I left the Palais Bourbon and turned my steps towards\r\nthe Tuileries. There the crowd was more hostile, especially the Garde\r\nNationale. The men had turned their rifles upside down, and some of\r\nthem were screaming aloud they would never fire against “la nation.” Now\r\nand then a cry resounded: “La déchéance! La déchéance,” and the accents\r\nof the Marseillaise made themselves heard; but it must be remarked that\r\nno cries of “Vive la République!” were to be noticed, at least I did not\r\nhear any. Another strange feature of this pacific revolution was that\r\nthe mutineers were in small bands, which were each followed by a\r\nconsiderable crowd of onlookers, which probably would have dispersed at\r\nsight of the first company of soldiers. The police had mysteriously\r\nvanished, and the whole aspect of the crowd was good-natured in the\r\nextreme; it was composed of as many women, children and dogs as of\r\n_insurgés_, and seemed more on amusement bent than on anything else.\r\nEven when the gates of the Tuileries were at last forced, and the mob\r\nfound itself in the big courtyard, it did not attempt to enter the\r\ninterior of the Palace; the people merely walked about the garden and\r\nthe inner courtyard that led from the Carrousel to the private gardens.\r\nHad the Empress remained she would not even have noticed the invasion,\r\nand the best proof of what I say here lies in the fact that when the\r\nmembers of the new government arrived a few hours later in the\r\nTuileries, they found everything in the same state as usual; nothing had\r\nbeen disturbed, and even the papers forgotten by the Empress on her\r\nwriting table had been left untouched, the servants were all there, but\r\nhad only taken care to take off their liveries, with the alacrity which\r\npeople of their class always display in turning against their former\r\nmasters as soon as misfortune comes in any shape or form.\r\n\r\nI was one of the persons who visited the Tuileries on the evening of\r\nthat memorable 4th of September, which saw the fall of Napoleon III.’s\r\ndynasty. No one knew at that moment what had happened to the Empress,\r\nnor where she had fled, and rumours were going about in some quarters\r\nthat she had tried to join the Emperor, and in others that she had\r\ndirected her steps towards Metz with the intention of seeking a refuge\r\nwith the army of Bazaine, and establishing there the seat of government.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited the Palace I found that no one there believed she had\r\ngone away for ever; indeed--and this is a detail that I believe has\r\nnever been recorded elsewhere--I found one of her maids preparing her\r\nbed just as usual! It was evident the flight had been a hurried one. In\r\nthe private rooms, letters never meant to be seen by a stranger’s eye\r\nwere scattered about; a gold locket with the portrait of a lovely woman,\r\nthe Duchesse d’Albe; another one with that of a baby in long robes, the\r\nfirst picture of the Prince Imperial; one small golden crucifix; a note\r\njust begun, and addressed no one knows now to whom, but of which the\r\nfirst words ran thus: “Dans la terrible position où je me trouve, je\r\nne----” The writing stopped there; evidently she who had started it\r\nhad been interrupted by the bearer of some evil message, and there it\r\nlay forgotten, in the midst of the tragedy which had put an end to so\r\nmany things and to so many hopes.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of the 4th of September was especially remarkable for the\r\ninconsiderable impression it produced in Paris itself. Life went on just\r\nas usual, and save for a few expressions of wonder, no one seemed quite\r\nto realise the importance of it. The capital began to prepare for the\r\nsiege, rather with mirth than anything else. To tell the truth no one\r\nseemed to believe in its possibility, and I remember one day, when\r\nvisiting a friend who was living on the Quai Malaquais, she pointed to\r\nthe Seine flowing softly under her windows, saying at the same time:\r\n“Croyez-vous que les Prussiens arriveront devant mes fenêtres comme les\r\nNormands jadis sont entrés à Paris?” (“Do you think that the Prussians\r\nwill arrive in front of my windows as the Normans entered Paris in days\r\nof yore?”)\r\n\r\nI reproduce this remark just to show how very little those in the\r\ncapital realised either the present or the future at this particular\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which struck me, was that existence out of doors seemed to\r\ngo on much as usual, in spite of the bad news that continued to pour in.\r\nThe theatres were full, and people seemed to make the most of the late\r\nsummer days that were coming to a close. There was very little\r\nexcitement, and the feeling that predominated was one of curiosity. Some\r\npeople were departing, but not in large numbers, and it was only towards\r\nthe end of September that people began seriously to look at the\r\nsituation. By that time I had already left Paris. I went on the 15th of\r\nSeptember, hoping to return in January, not suspecting then that the war\r\nwould drag on as it did. I, together with many reasonable people, still\r\nhoped that the new government would see the necessity of ending a\r\nhopeless struggle before it was too late.\r\n\r\nAll my suppositions turned out to be wrong, however, and it was only\r\ntowards the end of February that I was once more to find myself at my\r\nold post, by which time the unfortunate Emperor, languishing in\r\ncaptivity, seemed to be forgotten, and the Republic had grown to be an\r\nestablished fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM PARIS DURING THE SIEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nParis was already invested when I succeeded in leaving it with the help\r\nof a diplomatic passport, and it was in Vienna that I read in the papers\r\nthe news of the useless interview that took place between Prince, at\r\nthat time still Count, Bismarck, with M. Jules Favre at Férrières. I\r\nnever understood how the German Chancellor, who at that time had not the\r\nslightest intention to conclude peace, consented to receive the\r\nrepresentative of a government which he had not acknowledged. I was told\r\nlater on, that it was at the request of the King of Prussia he had given\r\nhis assent to Favre’s arrival at the German headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe results of this hopeless attempt are well known. Jules Favre talked\r\nas only an advocate can talk. But he pleaded sentimental reasons where\r\nhard facts only had to be considered. When he returned to Paris, it was\r\nwith the conviction that as the government of the Défense Nationale was\r\nneither strong enough nor respected enough to compel the country to\r\naccept a shameful peace, the only thing was to allow matters to drift.\r\n\r\nA good many of my friends, and of my colleagues, had elected to remain\r\nin the capital, and there await the end of the war, and I must own that\r\nI regretted later on that I had not been given the same opportunity.\r\nThat period was most interesting, and I have always felt that to\r\nunderstand the genesis of the events which happened later on, one ought\r\nto have experienced those months of anxiety, when the great capital was\r\nabandoned to her fate, with the Prussian guns levelled against her.\r\n\r\nI was not, however, left entirely without news, and as regularly as was\r\npossible received letters from besieged Paris, sent either by balloon or\r\nby carrier pigeons. I have kept them all, and from their pages now give\r\nextracts which will give an idea of the feelings of the Parisians during\r\nthe trial they had to undergo.\r\n\r\n_September 25th, 1870._\r\n\r\n     “MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,--You will be wondering what is happening to\r\n     us, and I do not want to let pass the present opportunity to send\r\n     you some news concerning us. We are now quite resigned to the\r\n     prospect of a siege, and the only question that is agitating the\r\n     public mind is how long it will last. The most contradictory\r\n     rumours are spread, and some of them even attribute to Jules Favre\r\n     the intention of trying to restore the Empire, after having assured\r\n     himself that he would remain its Prime Minister. Of course this is\r\n     nothing but humbug, and I only mention it to you to show you to\r\n     what extent public imagination can cajole itself. What is not\r\n     humbug, however, is the difficulty the government finds in\r\n     attempting anything in the way of peace negotiations. It begins to\r\n     see the great mistake which was made when a small minority\r\n     overthrew the Empire so unexpectedly. Had it been left standing,\r\n     all the onus of the disastrous peace, which, whether France likes\r\n     it or not, will have to be concluded, would have fallen upon its\r\n     shoulders, whilst at the present moment, it is the Défense\r\n     Nationale which will bear the brunt of anger at the dismemberment\r\n     of our France. This may sound the death knell of the Republic, and\r\n     those who are at its head know it but too well. I think that the\r\n     unlucky phrase of Jules Favre, when he said that he would never\r\n     give up ‘un pouce de notre territoire, ni une pierre de nos\r\n     forteresses,’ was more a calculated pronouncement than the result\r\n     of an enthusiasm too strong to think of the consequences its\r\n     imprudent words might have. He wanted to ward off the evil moment\r\n     when he would be called upon to do that which the Empire he had\r\n     helped to overthrow would have done had it been left in power; and\r\n     feeling this to be inevitable, had tried to keep the knowledge of\r\n     this bitter fact from the public. One begins to realise the mistake\r\n     one has made, I repeat it, but unfortunately one does not see what\r\n     ought to be done to mend it. The public feeling in the city is very\r\n     different from that which was prevailing on the 4th of this month.\r\n     The Parisians begin to realise the seriousness of the situation,\r\n     but there is no talk of a surrender, and the confidence that\r\n     victory will return to France is very dominant among the lower\r\n     classes, whilst it is recognised among the higher ones that the\r\n     deal has been irrevocably lost, and that peace ought to be\r\n     concluded, else serious disturbances may occur among the Garde\r\n     Nationale and the numerous militia.\r\n\r\n     “The government does nothing, and when I have said this, I say\r\n     everything. They say that they can do nothing and that it is to the\r\n     Tours delegation they must look for an attempt to stop the progress\r\n     of the Prussian army. So long as Gambetta was here there was some\r\n     activity in ministerial offices; now he has gone there is absolute\r\n     stagnation. All these ministers, suddenly called upon to exercise\r\n     functions for which they were totally unprepared, seem lost, and\r\n     Jules Favre looks at the political situation with the same eye he\r\n     would look at some big criminal or civil law case--from the outlook\r\n     of an advocate, not from that of a statesman. They say he actually\r\n     cried during his conversation with Bismarck. The question arises\r\n     whether these tears were genuine ones of grief, or simply a\r\n     rhetorical incident. How much more dignity there was in the conduct\r\n     of General Wimpffen and his colleagues, when they discussed with\r\n     the German Minister and the German General Staff the conditions of\r\n     the capitulation of Sedan! No one likes Jules Favre, whom even his\r\n     partisans consider to be a demagogue of talent, but nothing more.\r\n     And certainly France does not need demagogues at the present time.\r\n\r\n     “There are comical notes in the gravity of the situation. People\r\n     talk about never surrendering, about dying for their country,\r\n     whilst running about buying hams and butter, and as many provisions\r\n     as they can, in view of the siege. Vegetables are at a premium,\r\n     meat will soon become a luxury, bread is already looked upon in the\r\n     same light that cakes were formerly, and frivolous women are\r\n     getting excited at the thought of the many privations which they\r\n     expect they will be called upon to endure. Yet comparatively few\r\n     people have left the capital, where, after all, perhaps, one is\r\n     safer than in the provinces. News leaks out sometimes from the\r\n     outside, mostly false; for instance, it was related the other day,\r\n     that the Prince Imperial had reached Metz, and put himself under\r\n     the protection of Marshal Bazaine. All the partisans of the Empire\r\n     believed it, but serious people did not attach any faith to this\r\n     rumour. The Legitimists are full of hope that out of the present\r\n     complications a monarchical restoration may ensue; the Radicals, on\r\n     their part, are sure that, sooner or later, the government will\r\n     fall into their hands. The principal question that is agitating the\r\n     public mind, is as to who would eventually have the right to\r\n     conclude peace with Prussia. No one, to begin with the members of\r\n     the present administration (for one can hardly call it a\r\n     government), believes that the King of Prussia would consent to\r\n     treat with them. Therefore the calling together of a National\r\n     Assembly is imperative, but would this Assembly be the expression\r\n     of the will of the nation, when the elections would have to be held\r\n     under the muzzles of the enemy’s guns? In a word, we live in a\r\n     state of uncertainty such as France has never yet experienced, no\r\n     one knows what the morrow holds in reserve, and though there is a\r\n     government of the National Defence, yet there is no one to defend\r\n     the country.”\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this letter in its entirety, because it seems to me\r\nthat it explains very well the state of opinion in besieged Paris. Later\r\non, I was to receive another communication from the same correspondent,\r\nwritten immediately after the insurrection of the 18th of October. This\r\none is more alarming even than the first.\r\n\r\n     “We have had the other day,” he writes on November 4th, “the first\r\n     taste of that revolution which we shall not escape. It began by an\r\n     _échauffourée_ of the National Guard, and ended by an invasion of\r\n     the Hotel de Ville by the mob. It was repulsed, but for how long?\r\n     This is the question, and the population of the faubourgs is\r\n     getting so excited that at the first opportunity it will most\r\n     certainly again take the offensive, and this time with greater\r\n     chances of success. Don’t forget that, after all, we have no\r\n     regular army in Paris worthy of that name, that arms have been\r\n     distributed not only to the National Guard, but to a great part of\r\n     the population; that, consequently, it is the latter, and not the\r\n     pseudo-government, that in reality holds the power to impose its\r\n     will upon the capital. One talks a lot about patriotism, believe me\r\n     there is very little of patriotism about; all the politicians who\r\n     have tried to persuade themselves that they have the qualifications\r\n     of real statesmen, only think of their future, and of the\r\n     possibility of their own greatness rising out of the ruins of their\r\n     fatherland. They do nothing else but talk; I wish they would\r\n     work--it would be more to the point.\r\n\r\n     “I must tell you something that will surprise you. Rumours have\r\n     been going about that the Prussian government had started some\r\n     negotiations with the Empress in England. She is still Regent in\r\n     name if not in fact, and her intervention, especially if it was\r\n     strengthened by a demonstration of the army of Metz in her favour,\r\n     might decide the King of Prussia to conclude an honourable peace,\r\n     or at least one which would be termed honourable by every\r\n     reasonable person. Well, will you believe me that a Bonapartist,\r\n     quite _au courant_ with what goes on, and who knows, moreover, the\r\n     character of the Empress, told me that in his opinion she would\r\n     always hesitate to take measures which might afterwards be\r\n     attributed to her as proceeding from a desire to save the dynasty?\r\n     She persists in that attitude which she has adopted from the\r\n     outset, of putting France before everything, and of appearing to be\r\n     careless of the interests of her family. She will not see that, at\r\n     a time of such crisis, the interests of the dynasty are inseparable\r\n     from those of the country, and that if by means of an intervention\r\n     of the army of Metz in its favour she can conclude peace under more\r\n     favourable conditions than those which Prussia would impose on a\r\n     Republican government, it is her clear duty to do all that she can\r\n     to achieve that result, no matter what reproaches might be hurled\r\n     at her in the future. The Empire still has many partisans in\r\n     France, especially among the working classes; they would most\r\n     certainly have rallied around the Regent if it had been properly\r\n     explained to them that she had saved the army of Metz from the fate\r\n     that had overtaken that of Sedan, and, in consideration of this\r\n     service, one would have forgiven her many things. Of course what I\r\n     am telling you here reposes on hearsay, and you most probably know\r\n     more about it than we can here, separated as we are from the\r\n     outside world; but I repeat it, strong rumours have been going\r\n     about, that Eugénie has been approached by Prussia, who, it seems,\r\n     is even more eager for peace than we are, and that it has been\r\n     hinted to her that every facility would be granted to her to appeal\r\n     to France, to help her out of the terrible situation in which both\r\n     find themselves at present. Among a certain circle strong hopes\r\n     were indulged at one time that these rumours would turn out to be\r\n     true, consequently the news of the capitulation of Metz, which the\r\n     Prussians took good care should reach us, came as a thunderbolt to\r\n     the Bonapartists, who openly declared that it had been brought\r\n     about through the refusal of the Empress, from mistaken dynastic\r\n     reasons, to assume the responsibility of a peace, the conditions of\r\n     which, including, as they necessarily must have done, a concession\r\n     of territory, would have excited indignation throughout France.\r\n\r\n     “All that I am telling you is, of course, the result of my private\r\n     observations, but these may interest you, in view of your Imperial\r\n     sympathies.\r\n\r\n     “And now you shall ask me what I am doing personally in our poor\r\n     besieged Paris. Well, I happened to be near the Hotel de Ville on\r\n     that memorable 18th of October, and I was much interested in the\r\n     motley crowd that assembled in front of it. What struck me\r\n     extremely was the large contingent of women, who were trying either\r\n     to help or to excite their husbands or friends. I did not think\r\n     that Parisian females were so revolutionary, nor that they counted\r\n     in their midst such a number of old hags worthy to rival the\r\n     witches of _Macbeth_ in appearance. I am afraid that if we see a\r\n     real revolution--which God forbid, though I am inclined to think\r\n     its advent is inevitable--the women will show themselves ten times\r\n     more ferocious than the men, and that the days of the\r\n     _tricoteuses_, who dictated to the Convention in 1793, are not by\r\n     any means over yet.\r\n\r\n     “The remnant of society left in the capital has bravely made up its\r\n     mind not to eat, drink and be merry, but to go through all the\r\n     hardships of the siege with good humour and resignation. People\r\n     still see each other, and indeed social life has not changed,\r\n     although the menus of the dinners to which one is invited are\r\n     anything but luxurious. For instance, yesterday I was asked to\r\n     lunch by my old friend Countess Stéphanie Tascher de la Pagerre,\r\n     together with two other people, and this is what we were offered: a\r\n     potage Liebig with macaroni, roasted horseflesh, fresh beans, and\r\n     chocolate cream without cream, but made with tinned milk. With the\r\n     most charitable feelings in the world, it would be impossible to\r\n     say that it was good, or that anyone liked it.\r\n\r\n     “Clubs, too, are just as formerly, though they present the unusual\r\n     sight of members dressed in uniform, who often come to lunch direct\r\n     from the front, and who leave a rifle instead of a stick to the\r\n     care of the hall porter, whilst they snatch a hasty and nasty meal.\r\n     The theatres play just as usual; an ambulance has been organised in\r\n     the foyer of the Comédie Française, and Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt is\r\n     just as bewitching under the white cap and apron of a nurse as she\r\n     was in her most gorgeous stage dresses. In short, the _comédie\r\n     humaine_ has become the _comédie parisienne_, notwithstanding the\r\n     tragedy of Paris and of France.”\r\n\r\nThis letter, penned by an American who had elected to remain in Paris\r\nduring the siege, gives pretty well the idea of the spirit that\r\nprevailed among the Bonapartists, and the one which animated the _grand\r\nmonde_, or at least those who had not fled abroad. To complete the\r\npicture, I must give another letter, one from an old lady whose name I\r\nhave already mentioned in these pages--Madame Lacroix, who had returned\r\nfrom St. Germain after the 4th of September, and, notwithstanding her\r\ngreat age, had remained in Paris, where her _salon_ was the rendezvous\r\nof her numerous friends, and just as animated as it had been formerly.\r\n\r\n     “Our situation is always the same, just as lamentable and just as\r\n     sad. Nothing seems to change around us, save the fact that\r\n     provisions are getting scarcer and scarcer, that butter is not to\r\n     be had for love or money, and that dogs, rats, and cats appear on\r\n     the best tables in place of beef and mutton. Gas also is a thing of\r\n     the past, and one has to exercise strict economy in oil and\r\n     paraffin. I have now only one lamp burning in my drawing-room,\r\n     which we take along with us when we go to the dining-room. The\r\n     population begins to get exasperated at this heavy inaction that\r\n     weighs upon it; the absence of all reliable news also tells on the\r\n     hearts and minds. On the 29th of November we were awakened by the\r\n     sound of the cannon, and one heard that at last the government had\r\n     decided to make an effort to attack the enemy, in the endeavour to\r\n     effect a junction with the army of the Loire, which, as it seems,\r\n     was quite near to us; at least this is what our government choose\r\n     to tell us. Trochu has published another proclamation, addressed to\r\n     the population, just as devoid of common sense as all his previous\r\n     ones have been. For about three days we were left absolutely\r\n     without news, though it was rumoured that the Prussians had been\r\n     defeated by Ducrot, but at last it leaked out that the plans of\r\n     Trochu had failed, and that the effort made by the garrison of\r\n     Paris had been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n     “On the 5th of December we were startled by the news of the defeat\r\n     of the army of Chanzy near Orleans, and I must confess to you that\r\n     now the most sanguine hopes have been shattered, and the only\r\n     feeling left is the desire to see this nightmare under which we are\r\n     living come to an end.”\r\n\r\n     This letter was written just before the end of that sad year 1870,\r\n     which had begun so brilliantly with a reception at the Tuileries,\r\n     now standing deserted and abandoned by its former masters. In the\r\n     first fortnight of January a curious incident occurred, which, I\r\n     believe, has not been widely known among the public, but yet, in\r\n     view of the events that happened later on, offers a certain\r\n     interest. I will relate it in the words of the friend who informed\r\n     me of it, the American whose letter I have already given:\r\n\r\n     “I am going to tell you something which will probably appear to you\r\n     rather like a scene taken out of a comic opera, but which I am\r\n     assured really took place the other day. A friend of the Orleans\r\n     princes asked General Trochu to grant him an interview, and tried\r\n     to win his support to a proposition to ask the Duke of Aumale to\r\n     accept, if only for an intermediary period, the post of President\r\n     of the National Defence. Trochu, after having indulged in the usual\r\n     rhetoric of which he is so fond, at last pathetically replied that\r\n     he had sworn fidelity to the Republic, and that as a soldier he\r\n     could not break his oath; to this his visitor retorted that\r\n     probably that oath was sworn on something he respected more than\r\n     the one he had made to the Empress Eugénie when he told her she\r\n     could rely on his honour as a soldier, a Catholic, and a Breton.\r\n     Trochu was silent for a few minutes, and then said: ‘J’ai fait\r\n     passer la patrie avant tout lorsque----’ ‘Lorsque il s’est agi\r\n     pour vous de vous mettre à la tête du gouvernement vous-même’ (‘I\r\n     put my country first when----’ ‘When it was a question of placing\r\n     yourself at the head of its government’) interrupted the other.\r\n\r\n     “I cannot, of course, vouch for the truth of the anecdote, but it\r\n     was told to me by a person who is generally well informed. But what\r\n     I do know, is that very few people have been or are despised to the\r\n     extent of General Trochu, for whom no one finds a good word to say,\r\n     and everyone is hoping that his colleagues will oblige him either\r\n     to sign the capitulation of Paris, which cannot be delayed much\r\n     longer, especially now that the bombardment has commenced [this\r\n     letter was written on the 25th of January], or else to resign his\r\n     functions altogether. His dispatch of the 20th only confirmed the\r\n     opinion one had as to his military ability, and certainly nothing\r\n     could be more lamentable than the sight of the troops returning\r\n     into the town after the battles of the 19th and 20th, weary,\r\n     hungry, worn out, and exasperated against their leaders. That\r\n     exasperation has again brought down from the faubourgs the\r\n     agitators that have ever since the 4th of September kept Paris in a\r\n     state of turmoil, and on the 22nd of January in the night they\r\n     invaded the prison of Mazas, and delivered several political men\r\n     detained there, among others Flourens. They also made an attempt to\r\n     occupy the mairie of the 20th arrondissement. A battle has taken\r\n     place opposite the Hôtel de Ville, and the government is entirely\r\n     discredited; even among the former most determined partisans of war\r\n     being continued at any price, the feeling prevails that peace, no\r\n     matter on what conditions, would be better than the present state\r\n     of things, which is only favourable to promoters of disorder, of\r\n     which there are but too many.”\r\n\r\nAs is known, the capitulation of Paris took place on the 28th of\r\nJanuary, and I prepared myself at once to return. After a journey devoid\r\nof serious incidents, but long and fatiguing, I reached Versailles on\r\nthe 31st of that month, having taken four days to do so. I had started\r\nfrom Berlin, where I had been waiting for the first opportunity to\r\nreturn to my post in Paris. At Versailles I found M. Thiers, who was\r\nalready busy negotiating the conditions of a peace that most certainly\r\nthe Empress Regent, had she only taken the responsibility of its\r\nconclusion, would have been able to sign under more favourable clauses\r\nthan those to which France had to submit. It is possible, if not\r\nprobable, that the Imperial eagles would not have witnessed the entry of\r\nthe German troops into Paris, a humiliation which old King William did\r\nnot see the necessity to spare a Republic for which it was impossible to\r\nfeel the least respect.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter I must mention one letter among the many\r\nwhich reached me at Versailles during those days from friends who were\r\nin Paris, giving me some details concerning this crowning episode to the\r\nmany sad and disgraceful ones that will make the war of 1870 for ever\r\nmemorable.\r\n\r\n_March 4th_, 1871.\r\n\r\n     “We were all waiting with anxiety for that 1st of March that was to\r\n     see the German troops enter the capital. Grave apprehensions were\r\n     entertained on the subject by many people, who declared that very\r\n     probably the excited Parisians would indulge in demonstrations of\r\n     hostility against the Prussians, which would assuredly have\r\n     terrible consequences. On the 27th of February I called at\r\n     Rothschild’s bank in the Rue Lafitte, hoping to hear some news\r\n     there, where they were generally better informed than anywhere\r\n     else. One of the principal employees, whom I knew well, told me\r\n     with tears in his eyes that no efforts of Jules Favre had availed,\r\n     and that the German army would occupy Paris on the 1st, but that,\r\n     as a last concession, that occupation would be limited to a certain\r\n     zone, and not extend itself to the whole city. Great preparations\r\n     had been made, and the shopkeepers in the streets through which the\r\n     troops of the enemy were to pass had declared that they would close\r\n     their doors and shutters ‘pour ne pas assister à cette honte,’ as\r\n     one of them told me himself; it was also tacitly understood that\r\n     private houses would pull down their blinds. Curious to see how\r\n     things would go on, and feeling convinced that, in spite of the\r\n     apprehensions entertained in certain quarters, no disturbances of\r\n     any kind would occur, Frenchmen being always cowed down whenever\r\n     they see real strength before them, I was up very early, and,\r\n     rejoicing at the splendid weather which had suddenly set in after\r\n     very dark and gloomy days, as if to welcome the triumph of Prussia,\r\n     I went down the Champs Elysées, and was present when the first\r\n     German detachments made their appearance. The sight was imposing,\r\n     and could only suggest many philosophical thoughts. The greatest\r\n     discipline prevailed, and this discipline seemed to make a great\r\n     impression on the numerous throngs that lined the streets to see\r\n     the unusual spectacle. A few women were weeping with a certain\r\n     affectation, but there were also some girls smiling and welcoming\r\n     with glances full of coquetry the Prussian officers riding in front\r\n     of their regiments. At about four o’clock everything was over, and\r\n     the soldiers settled in the cantonments which had been allotted to\r\n     them for the night. The next day the sight was stranger still. The\r\n     population of Paris, notwithstanding what may have been told to you\r\n     to the contrary, had fraternised with the enemy, and one saw the\r\n     usual _camelots_ that appear in the streets of Paris whenever there\r\n     is something new to see, offer to the Prussian soldiers cigarettes,\r\n     matches, and newspapers, whilst girls timidly extended some flowers\r\n     to them--not, however, before looking carefully around them to see\r\n     whether anyone watched them doing so. When, on the 3rd of March,\r\n     the German troops retired, I heard that typical remark, from a\r\n     woman who had been watching their going away with eager eyes:\r\n     ‘Après tout, ce sont de beaux soldats que ceux-là!’ she cried.\r\n\r\n     “It seems that a solemn moment occurred during the review held by\r\n     the new Emperor on the Hippodrome de Longchamps, before the troops\r\n     started to enter Paris. I have been told the sight was most\r\n     imposing, and must have roused a world of remembrances in the heart\r\n     of its principal hero. What must have been his thoughts at a moment\r\n     when the history, as it were, of a whole century was suddenly\r\n     recapitulated before his eyes? His fate had made him witness the\r\n     present triumph, after the humiliations of Jena and that first\r\n     occupation of the French capital by the allied troops in 1815, when\r\n     another Napoleon had seen fortune retire from him! It seems that\r\n     after the review was over, the Emperor looked wistfully for a\r\n     considerable time at the long line of troops filing along on their\r\n     triumphal journey, and before dismounting from his horse he turned\r\n     towards the Crown Prince with the simple remark, ‘I hope that you,\r\n     too, have thanked God to-day!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, I returned to Versailles during the last days of\r\nJanuary, and, except a short visit to Paris, whither I went to see after\r\nmy household gods which had been left to their fate during the siege,\r\nand to inquire after the friends who had remained in the capital during\r\nthose anxious months, I stayed there until I left for Bordeaux, where\r\nthe National Assembly met in order to ratify the conditions of the peace\r\nthat was ultimately to be signed in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nAt Bordeaux, to my great surprise, I found that the sole topic of\r\npopular conversation was the declaration of the overthrow of the\r\nBonaparte dynasty. It seemed as if that was the principal object of the\r\nelections that had taken place, and that it was far more important than\r\nthe establishing of an understanding with Germany. The ambitions of the\r\ndifferent parties which divided public opinion in France had been newly\r\nawakened at the unforeseen chances which they suddenly saw looming\r\nbefore them. Orleanists, Legitimists and Republicans were all eager to\r\ncome forward with schemes to take the place of the regime that had so\r\nrecently come to a tragic close. I remember that one evening after\r\ndinner I was sitting together with some friends in one of the most\r\nelegant restaurants of Bordeaux, and we listened to a discussion that\r\nwas taking place at the next table, and during which the chances of the\r\ndifferent parties that the country had sent to represent it at the\r\nNational Assembly were enumerated. What struck me in this conversation\r\nwas that France itself was not even mentioned; it seemed as if the\r\ncatastrophes that had accompanied the war had swept it from the face of\r\nthe earth, and had only left political parties and political\r\nconvictions, the leaders of which wanted to find some personal advantage\r\nout of the general disasters. Another thing I also observed that\r\nappeared even then strange to me, and it seems stranger still to-day--it\r\nis that very few people believed the Republic would be able to maintain\r\nitself. On the contrary, they felt convinced that France was standing\r\nupon the threshold of a Monarchist restoration. The Orleans princes had\r\na considerable number of adherents, and were made much of in certain\r\nquarters, where the courage displayed by the Duc de Chartres and the\r\nPrince de Joinville, who had joined the Republican armies as volunteers,\r\nwas extolled at every opportunity; whilst the Legitimists kept hoping\r\nthat the Comte de Chambord would seize the opportunity and rally himself\r\nto the tricolour flag, thus to clear his path to the throne of his\r\nancestors. The Republicans seemed still surprised and dazed by the\r\nunexpected events that had raised them to power, and did not believe\r\nthat their party would succeed in maintaining itself at the head of the\r\ncountry. I believe that if the Orleans princes had been generous enough\r\nto forgo the millions that had been confiscated under Napoleon III., and\r\nwhich they hastened to claim from the State, they would have been able\r\neasily to provoke a manifestation in their favour that would eventually\r\nhave led to a restoration of their dynasty. The government was\r\nthoroughly discredited, in spite of the great influence wielded by Leon\r\nGambetta, in whom everyone saw the man of the future, and it was\r\ngenerally felt that it would not be strong enough to compel the country\r\nto accept the heavy peace conditions which Germany was determined to\r\nenforce. Unfortunately, among all the representatives of the nation who\r\nmet at Bordeaux, there was not a man daring enough, and brave enough, to\r\nsuggest the recall of any of the pretenders. On the other hand, the\r\nBonapartes had still a considerable number of partisans, who did their\r\nbest to paralyse every effort to substitute another dynasty. They hoped\r\nthat, in spite of Sedan, France would remember the eighteen years of\r\nprosperity which it had just gone through, and would recall the child\r\nwho had been so popular, under the name of “le petit Prince,” until the\r\ncatastrophe that had sent him together with his parents in exile on\r\nBritish shores.\r\n\r\nThe only one who appreciated rightly the intricacies of the situation\r\nsuch as it presented itself, and who very cleverly played his cards, in\r\nsuch a manner that he made himself indispensable, was M. Thiers. He\r\nflattered everybody, promised everything that was required of him, gave\r\nevery pledge that he was asked for, and finally secured his own\r\nunanimous election at Bordeaux, by the National Assembly, as chief of\r\nthe executive power--one did not dare yet to use the term President of\r\nthe French Republic.\r\n\r\nThe new head of the government very soon made himself the master of the\r\nsituation, and his influence became in a short time paramount in\r\neverything. He rapidly brought to a close the peace negotiations with\r\nGermany, and on the 26th of February its preliminaries were signed at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers returned to Paris, determined to settle down to the task of\r\nmending the many sores and wounds which the months that had just elapsed\r\nhad left behind them. Unhappily he found himself confronted by a\r\nsituation far more dangerous than he had expected, owing to the want of\r\nforesight of Jules Favre, who had not had the courage to resist the\r\nfoolish demands of the mob, and who, obeying the orders which he had\r\nreceived from the leaders of the extreme Radical party, had during the\r\npeace negotiations with Prince Bismarck insisted upon the Parisian\r\npopulation being allowed to retain their rifles, and the National Guards\r\nnot being disarmed. In a curious book called “Journal d’un Officier\r\nd’Ordonnance,” an aide-de-camp of General Trochu, Comte d’Hérisson,\r\nrelates that Bismarck replied to these demands with the prophetic words:\r\n“I am willing to accede to your request, but believe me you are acting\r\nstupidly.”\r\n\r\nStupidity or not, the National Guard was left in possession of its\r\nweapons, and the first thought of M. Thiers when he reached Paris was to\r\ntake them away. But this was not so easy; the National Guard was for the\r\ngreater part composed of excitable men who dreamed only of the\r\nsovereignty of the mob. When the hour for laying down their arms\r\narrived, the Guard refused to do so, and the rebellious feelings which\r\nhad been brewing ever since the revolution of the 4th of September broke\r\nout at last into a fury that culminated in the brutal assassination of\r\ntwo generals, Clément Thomas and Lecomte, who had been sent by the\r\ngovernment to disarm the National Guard.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the day which saw the beginning of the\r\nCommune; I will merely add a few quite personal remarks, which, perhaps,\r\nwill make the reader understand more clearly than a long narrative the\r\nstate of mind of the Parisian population at that particular moment.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of the 18th of March had come quite unawares upon the\r\nauthorities, who had neither foreseen it nor attempted to crush it,\r\nwhich would have been easier than generally believed, but unfortunately\r\neverybody seemed so overpowered by surprise that the simplest measures\r\nof precaution were disregarded, and what was at first but a revolt was\r\nsoon transformed into a revolution through the negligence of the very\r\npeople who ought to have been guiltless of carelessness at this grave\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\nThis is not an historical book, consequently I am not going to relate\r\nthe details of the flight of M. Thiers to Versailles as soon as he heard\r\nof the revolt of Montmartre, and of the assassination of Clément Thomas\r\nand Lecomte, but I am going to speak of what I myself had occasion to\r\nobserve on that memorable 18th of March which marked the beginning of\r\nthe Commune.\r\n\r\nI had gone out of my house on the morning of that day, quite unconscious\r\nthat anything like a revolution, or even a mutiny, was in the air. As\r\nchance would have it, I had the necessity to go to Montmartre to see an\r\nold servant who had been in the army and was severely wounded at that\r\nsortie which Ducrot had attempted just before Paris capitulated. The man\r\nwas living not far from the Rue des Rosiers, which was to become so\r\nmemorable. When I reached the last-mentioned street I found it invaded\r\nby a most threatening and angry crowd, which kept howling: “Vive la\r\nCommune! Vive la révolution sociale!” Realising that matters were\r\ngetting dangerous, I hastily retraced my steps, and hoped that I should\r\nsucceed in escaping the attention of the mob, when one of the National\r\nGuard stopped me and asked what I was seeking and why I had come there.\r\nHe would not listen to my explanations, and suddenly said: “Toi tu me\r\nfais l’effet d’être un Prussien, montres donc tes papiers” (“You look\r\nlike a Prussian, just show me your papers”). When I said I had not got\r\nthem about me, he took me by the arm and said: “Toi, mon garçon, tu iras\r\nt’expliquer au poste, allons, marche en avant, ou sinon----” (“Now, my\r\nlad, you will go and explain yourself at the guardhouse, march, or\r\nelse----”) He showed me his rifle. Seeing that things were getting\r\nserious, I told my tormentor that if he wanted to be reassured as to my\r\nidentity, he had better take me to the mayor of the 12th arrondissement,\r\nM. Clemenceau, who knew me personally and could vouch that I was not a\r\nPrussian spy, which he was taking me for. The man looked at me sharply,\r\nand then said: “Clemenceau, Clemenceau, mais avec celui là on ne sait\r\njamais ce qu’il va faire, ce n’est pas un pur” (“Clemenceau, Clemenceau,\r\none never knows what he is up to, he isn’t straight”). I have never\r\nforgotten this remark, which perhaps explains better than anything else\r\nthe strange attitude of M. Clemenceau on that day, and the timidity\r\nwhich he displayed. He has, I know but too well, been bitterly accused\r\nof having witnessed, without trying to save them, the execution of the\r\ntwo unfortunate generals. In justice to him, I must say, first of all,\r\nthat he arrived upon the scene when the executions were already over,\r\nand secondly, that his efforts would have probably been quite useless,\r\nas at that time he was himself held in suspicion by the leaders of the\r\nrebellious movement.\r\n\r\nI do not know how my adventure would have ended if by chance one of the\r\nNational Guard gathered on the spot had not recognised me as a foreign\r\ndiplomat. Formerly he had been a butler at the Russian Embassy, and of\r\ncourse had seen me there. It is to his intervention that I owed my\r\nliberty, which without him would probably have been difficult to obtain.\r\nHe further gave me an escort, to whom he gave orders to take me safely\r\nback to my own house, which, however, they did not do, much to my joy;\r\nthey left me in the Rue Lafayette, where probably they thought it was\r\nnot safe for them to venture, owing to their torn and dirty clothes and\r\nthe loaded rifles which they carried. I made my way on to the\r\nboulevards and met at once some friends, to whom I expressed my\r\napprehensions that the revolutionary movement which had broken out would\r\nprove much more serious than those of a like nature that had taken place\r\non the 31st of October and the 22nd of January preceding. We were still\r\ntalking when we were joined by General d’Abzac, one of the aides-de-camp\r\nof Marshal MacMahon, of whom I shall have more to say by and by. He told\r\nus that M. Thiers had either left or was leaving for Versailles, where\r\nit was intended to remove the seat of government.\r\n\r\nNo one understood why this decision had been taken, and especially taken\r\nwith such haste. I was afterwards assured, by a person who was in a\r\nposition to be well informed, that one of the reasons which had induced\r\nM. Thiers’ precipitancy was that he believed he would with greater\r\nfacility be able to disarm the population of Paris if he could excuse\r\nthis measure by the dread of a revolution breaking out, if it were not\r\nresorted to at once.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the revolution did break out, and for once the government\r\nfound itself utterly unable to crush it. There was no army, and, what\r\nwas worse, there were no leaders. The troops taken captive at Sedan and\r\nat Metz were only just returning, and it was to be dreaded that, very\r\njustly infuriated against their former generals and commanders, they\r\nwould not feel disposed to listen to them or to follow them, especially\r\nif they were ordered to fight against their fellow men, and this,\r\nfurthermore, in presence almost of the enemy who had not yet left\r\nVersailles or its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI left Paris at the end of March, indeed I was one of the last of the\r\ndiplomatic corps to go away. I went to Versailles, as everybody else\r\ndid, and happened to be present at the first review held by MacMahon of\r\nthe troops that had just returned from their German captivity. This\r\nreview had been rather dreaded, because it was uncertain how the\r\nsoldiers would receive the unfortunate chief, to whose military mistakes\r\nthey owed their misfortunes. Nevertheless the ceremony went off\r\ncomparatively well, though the troops preserved an absolute silence and\r\ndid not greet their former commander either with enthusiasm or with\r\ndisapproval. Afterwards I had occasion to ask an officer how it was that\r\nthis review had taken place without the slightest manifestation of any\r\nkind. He replied to me that the soldiers did not want to give way to\r\ntheir feelings in presence, as it were, of the enemy, and that it had\r\nbeen very wise to hold this first meeting between them and MacMahon\r\nunder circumstances that excluded the possibility of any attempt to make\r\nhim aware of the angry feelings which were entertained in regard to him\r\nby the troops whom he had led to defeat and to a shameful surrender.\r\n\r\nDuring the two months which I spent in Versailles, until the end of the\r\nCommune, I found many opportunities of talking with leading French\r\npoliticians gathered there, as to the future prospects of the country.\r\nThey were unanimous in maintaining that the Republic would not be able\r\nto hold out very long, and that a monarchical restoration was imminent.\r\nSome went even so far as to believe that the Empire still had many\r\npartisans, and that, provided Napoleon III. himself consented to give up\r\nhis rights and pretensions to his son, the Bonapartes might still\r\nreascend the throne. They had kept their popularity among the working\r\nclasses, who undoubtedly had reaped great advantages from the solicitude\r\nconcerning their welfare which the Emperor had exercised on their behalf\r\never since he became the Head of the State. Whatever may be said now,\r\nthe idea of a Republic becoming permanent was not then congenial to the\r\nmass of the nation, who felt more in unison with a Sovereign, no matter\r\nwho that Sovereign might be. The only one who saw clearly the future was\r\nM. Thiers, who, in one of his conversations with an intimate friend,\r\nforgot himself so far as to say that “The Republic has long years of\r\nlife before it this time.” He did not add that he thought so because he\r\nwas himself at its head.\r\n\r\nI do not think that any nightmare can be more awful than the last four\r\ndays which preceded the entry of the troops of Versailles into Paris. I\r\nwill only mention briefly the assassination of the Archbishop, Monsignor\r\nDarboy, together with other victims, and the desperate resistance which\r\nwas offered on the heights of Père-la-Chaise to the army of M. Thiers by\r\nthe remaining Communards, who had fled there for safety, the interior of\r\nParis no longer offering asylum to them. All these things are matters of\r\nhistory, but, to the stranger who had seen the capital in all its glory\r\nduring the last years of the Empire, it seemed that the effect of the\r\ncataclysm which had taken place would never be erased, nor the gay city\r\never recover the appearance of peace and prosperity it had enjoyed\r\nbefore the horrors of the Commune had occurred. There was something too\r\nsinister for words in the sight of the ruins which greeted the troops of\r\nVersailles when at last they occupied the town. The sight of the\r\ndestroyed Tuileries and the burned streets, which testified to the\r\nhorrors which they had witnessed, appeared as things almost too terrible\r\nto be true.\r\n\r\nBut, even in those days of terror, the indifference of the French people\r\nto everything that did not personally concern them, could not fail to\r\nstrike one. As soon as order was more or less restored, life began as\r\nusual, and the only lamentations which one heard were directed towards\r\nindividual misfortunes and losses, rather than towards the misfortunes\r\nof the nation, the prestige which had been destroyed, and the\r\nhumiliations that had been endured. Having one day the opportunity of\r\ndiscussing with a tradesman in my neighbourhood the sad and terrible\r\nevents which had occurred, I asked him whether the change of government\r\nhad affected commerce and industry, and I was very much surprised to\r\nhear him reply that it had not, because the Germans had spent so much\r\nmoney that one had not been able to perceive any difference. When I\r\nexpressed my wonder that France had accepted their money with the\r\nsatisfaction which he seemed to feel, he simply remarked that “C’est\r\nbien égal à qui nous vendons nos pommes de terre; l’important c’est de\r\nles vendre, et nous en avons vendu bien plus pendant l’année qui vient\r\nde s’écouler que nous ne l’avions jamais fait auparavant” (“It is quite\r\nindifferent to whom we sell our potatoes; the only important thing is to\r\nsell them, and we have sold ever so many more during the last year than\r\nwe had ever done before”).\r\n\r\nIn fact, satisfaction at the profits which private people had derived\r\nfrom German occupation had quite taken the upper hand of the sorrow the\r\nnation felt at the misfortunes that had fallen upon her.\r\n\r\nThis statement of mine will probably be questioned far and wide, but I\r\nshall always maintain it, in spite of any denials it may meet with.\r\nPatriotism with Frenchmen is mostly a question of words; it rarely goes\r\nbeyond phrases, full of enthusiasm but devoid of real meaning. The\r\ncountry is essentially egoistical, and it is perhaps for that very\r\nreason that it has not only survived its disasters, but has emerged from\r\nthem far more prosperous, in the material sense of the word only, than\r\nbefore the Germans overran the fair land of France.\r\n\r\nOne of the painful sights, in the days which followed immediately upon\r\nthe occupation of Paris by the troops of Versailles, was the ferocious\r\nway in which the members of the Commune were hunted and executed. Awful\r\nscenes, in which private vengeances played a part perhaps even more\r\nimportant than public reasons, were enacted. The work of repression was\r\na terrible one in the worst sense of the word, and the wanton cruelty\r\nwhich accompanied it will ever remain a dark page in the career of M.\r\nThiers and of the members of his government. It is to be questioned\r\nwhether it was indispensable, or even necessary, to exercise such\r\nutterly ruthless cruelty. The only explanation that can be given for\r\nsuch ferocious tyranny is that people in authority grew frightened and\r\nthought that, in order to hide their fear from the public, extreme\r\nseverity was best, as it would at least have the advantage of instilling\r\ndread into the hearts of those who otherwise might have felt tempted to\r\nfollow the example of Rossel, Raoul Rigault, and others.\r\n\r\nWhen all was over and order restored, M. Thiers, who was still residing\r\nat Versailles, came to Paris for a few hours, just to see for himself\r\nthe damage which his house in the Rue St. Georges had suffered, and to\r\npay a brief visit to the Elysée, which he had left with such alacrity on\r\nthe 18th of March, as soon as he had heard of the incidents that had\r\ntaken place at Montmartre. The reason for this hurried appearance at the\r\npalace was, so he said, to see whether some important papers he had\r\nlocked up in a safe, in his study there, had not been seized by the\r\nmembers of the Commune. As luck would have it, no one had discovered\r\nthem, and the First President of the Third Republic was able to regain\r\npossession of his property.\r\n\r\nA friend of his, to whom he mentioned the incident, asked him of what\r\nnature were those papers about which he had been so anxious during the\r\nwhole of the two months the Commune had lasted. M. Thiers smiled, and\r\nreplied simply: “They were not of any particular importance, but that\r\nwas just the reason why I was afraid that the Commune should get hold of\r\nthem. I had told everybody that they were of a most compromising nature\r\nfor some of the people actually in power, and for the pretenders to the\r\ncrown of this country. Imagine how compromised _I_ would have been had\r\nit been found out that they were merely tradesmen’s bills!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nM. THIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI had had many opportunities of meeting M. Thiers during the last years\r\nof the Empire. I had known him even before I came to Paris in an\r\nofficial capacity, had often seen him at the houses of some mutual\r\nfriends, and we came to know each other very well. He was one of the\r\ncleverest, nicest little men in the world, and even among the many\r\ninteresting people who abounded in France at that time, he stood out\r\nconspicuously as one of the pleasantest. He had many enemies, which is\r\nnot to be wondered at if one takes into consideration the vivacity which\r\nhe always displayed in his likes and dislikes, and the bitterness, or\r\nrather the caustic tendencies, of his tongue. But friends and foes alike\r\nwere loud in their praise of his intelligence, and especially of his\r\nwit. I am not talking of his moral character, which was discussed in\r\nmany ways and which in part justified the attacks that were levelled\r\nagainst it. The Legitimists could not forgive him the part he had taken\r\nin the arrest of the Duchesse de Berry, nor the attitude of the ministry\r\nof which he was a member with regard to that unfortunate Princess whose\r\nfrailties were so mercilessly displayed before the public before the end\r\nof her captivity in the fortress of Blaye. The Orleanists also did not\r\ncare for him, in spite of the pledge which he had given to their party;\r\nbut Louis Philippe personally was fond of him, perhaps because their\r\ntastes were very much alike, and because the sternness and austerity of\r\nGuizot, his great opponent, had never appealed to the heart of the\r\nKing, who stood rather in awe of that imposing figure in modern French\r\npolitical life. The bonhomie of Thiers, his easygoing manners, were more\r\nin accordance with the homely attitude which at that time distinguished\r\nthe Orleans family circle. As Montalembert once said very wittily:\r\n“Thiers, c’est le ministre bourgeois d’une dynastie bourgeoise.”\r\n\r\nAnd the remark contained a great deal of truth, though it is much to be\r\ndoubted whether the brilliant Catholic leader appreciated at their real\r\nworth the sterling qualities which M. Thiers was hiding under the\r\nsometimes frivolous manner in which he treated serious subjects.\r\n\r\nAs a writer he was one of the greatest of his epoch, and his work on the\r\nConsulate and the First Empire will always rank among the classics. Few\r\npeople have understood so well as he did the gigantic figure of the\r\nfirst Napoleon, and certainly his knowledge of history, the wonderful\r\nway in which he remembered its lessons, and knew how to apply them where\r\nit became necessary, constituted a unique thing even in France, where at\r\nthat time there was a superabundance of clever writers and great\r\nthinkers, of whom he was one of the foremost.\r\n\r\nSome enemies of M. Thiers assured me that he would have done better to\r\nconfine himself to his historical studies, and that it was a mistake on\r\nhis part to throw himself into the struggles of a political career. I do\r\nnot share this opinion personally, because the very nature of Thiers\r\nwould have protested against a life spent only in thinking without the\r\nemulation of doing. He was essentially a great patriot, far greater than\r\nthe general public supposed, and if he had personal ambitions, which\r\ncannot be denied, it must also be admitted that in the great moments of\r\ncrisis through which his country passed during his lifetime, he never\r\nhesitated to put all his strength, all his experience, and all his\r\nknowledge of public affairs, as well as his influence at home and\r\nabroad, at her service, sparing neither time nor trouble, nor energy, in\r\nhis endeavours to help her.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole reign of Louis Philippe, M. Thiers was a conspicuous\r\nfigure in Paris society, and, strange to relate, this petit bourgeois\r\nhad succeeded in entering the most exclusive circles of the Faubourg St.\r\nGermain, and contrived to install himself in the favours of its leaders,\r\nmasculine as well as feminine. He was essentially the type of a\r\nmiddle-class man, in spite of the high offices which he had held, and\r\nnever could rid himself of the habit of tying a napkin round his neck at\r\nmeals, when he was in his family circle, neither would he go out without\r\nthe umbrella that remained the distinctive sign of that epoch still\r\nknown as the “époque de Louis Philippe,” where the bourgeoisie reigned\r\nsupreme, and where the Sovereign tried by all means to win for himself\r\nthe sympathies of the mob by coming down to its level.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers did not care for the mob. He was of an autocratic character,\r\nand of an imperious disposition, admitting no sovereignty apart from his\r\nown. But, nevertheless, he remained the child of his generation and of\r\nhis class. He rose, but neither by adapting himself to circumstances,\r\nnor to the conditions of existence around him. Original he was in mind,\r\nin intelligence and in manners, and he did not change; he always\r\nappeared to his friends as a man of happy disposition tempered with\r\naffability, and tinged with familiarity; his distinctive characteristic\r\nfrom the very first days he entered public life.\r\n\r\nThiers was essentially “un homme d’opposition,” as one of his enemies\r\nonce remarked, but he was a statesman of a type such as is no longer\r\nfound nowadays; an active, busy, little individual, always on the look\r\nout for his adversaries’ mistakes, and terrible in the merciless way in\r\nwhich he noticed them--and, what is worse, made others notice them. He\r\nhad but little pity in his heart for the errors of mankind, but was wise\r\nenough not to show the disdain in which he held it. He had been at a\r\ngood school, had frequented the salon of Talleyrand, and studied\r\npolitics by contact with the politicians who had ranked among the\r\nforemost in Europe. He used to relate a funny little anecdote from his\r\nearly days, when he had been introduced to Prince Metternich, during one\r\nof his journeys to Vienna, whither he had repaired to study certain\r\nepisodes of the history of Napoleon, and examine certain documents\r\ndeposited in the Imperial Archives of the Burg. The statesman to whose\r\nintrigues the great Emperor had in part been indebted for his fall\r\nreceived Thiers in his study, and it seems received him very badly. But\r\nthe little Frenchman, far from appearing to notice it, began at once to\r\ntalk with the Austrian Chancellor as if he had known him for years, and\r\ndid not scruple to question him on the subjects about which he desired\r\nto learn, a thing which Metternich, who liked above all things to hear\r\nhimself speak, particularly disliked. Surprised at first, then slightly\r\nbored, the Prince told Thiers that he had better question the Director\r\nof the Archives about the various points he desired to clear up, to\r\nwhich the historian of the Consulate and the Empire replied quite\r\nbrusquely that this personage could not tell him anything worth\r\nlistening to, and that he never took lessons in history from those who\r\nhad only read it. Metternich, more and more astonished, asked him what\r\nhe meant. “Oh, nothing very important,” was the answer; “seulement je\r\ncrois que personne ne pourrait mieux me renseigner sur Napoleon que vous\r\nqui êtes parvenu à le tromper si complètement et si souvent” (“I merely\r\nthink no one should be better able to give me information about Napoleon\r\nthan yourself, who succeeded in deceiving him so completely and so\r\nfrequently”). When Thiers told this anecdote he never failed to add that\r\n“Metternich ne trouva rien d’autre à me répondre que de sourire avec la\r\nremarque: ‘Vous connaissez bien votre histoire, jeune homme’”\r\n(“Metternich in reply could do nothing but smile, accompanying it with\r\nthe remark: ‘You are well up in your history, young man’”).\r\n\r\nImpudence, as one can see from the above, was not wanting in the\r\ncharacter of the future President of the French Republic, and this\r\nimpudence never deserted him in later years. It has been said that his\r\nvanity was intense, and that there was some truth in this accusation\r\ncannot be denied; but beneath this vanity there lay the latent\r\nconsciousness the man had of his own moral and intellectual worth, and\r\nof the immense distance that existed between him and the other men of\r\nhis generation. He tried to impose his ideas on others; he was despotic\r\nin his decisions, his judgments and his opinions, but he was not devoid\r\nof impartiality, and he was very well aware of his own faults. He loved\r\nFrance with a sincere affection, which saw through her faults, and there\r\nwas no chauvinism in his feelings. He would have liked to see his\r\nfatherland prosperous and powerful, but he never rushed into extremes as\r\nFrenchmen are so often inclined. Whilst he was the responsible minister\r\nof the dynasty of July, he served it faithfully and to the best of his\r\nability, and though he has been often accused of opportunism, yet he\r\nnever would accept office under the Bonapartes, though, and this is\r\nrather curious, he always was of opinion that their dynasty was the most\r\npopular one among all those that aspired to the government of France.\r\n\r\nWhen, together with the other members of the Legislative Chamber, he was\r\nimprisoned by the President on the day of the _coup d’état_ of the 2nd\r\nof December, he is said to have made the following typical remark: “Le\r\nPrésident nous fait enfermer, c’est son droit; espérons pour lui, qu’il\r\nsaura en profiter, et ne donnera pas dans le travers de vouloir\r\ngouverner constitutionnellement. Il ne peut pas avoir de Constitution\r\npour les Bonaparte, tout au plus peuvent ils prétendre à ce que leur\r\nrègne soit celui où on parle de Constitution comme les malades parlent\r\ndes mêts que leurs médecins leur interdisent de manger” (“The President\r\nis having us shut up, it is his right; let us hope for his own sake that\r\nhe will know how to profit by it, and will not make the mistake of\r\nwanting to govern constitutionally. There can be no constitutional\r\ngovernment for the Bonapartes. The utmost they can lay claim to is that\r\nduring their reign the Constitution should be spoken of in the tone in\r\nwhich invalids speak of dishes that their doctors forbid them to eat”).\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteen years that the Empire lasted, Thiers always refused\r\nto take office, though he owned later on that he felt once or twice\r\nsorely tempted to do so. But he realised that the regime could not last,\r\nand reserved himself for the moment when it would be overturned, feeling\r\nconvinced in his mind that that day would be also that of his own\r\npersonal triumph, and that whether the country liked it or not it would\r\nbe compelled to turn to him for advice and for help.\r\n\r\nWhen after the first defeats which characterised the war of 1870, the\r\nEmpress Eugénie felt inclined to appeal to him to help her, and had him\r\nsounded by one of her friends who was on terms of close intimacy with\r\nhim, M. Thiers replied that it was either too late or too early for him\r\nto do anything, and that as matters stood, the best thing to do was to\r\nallow events to take their course. “But the dynasty,” said his visitor;\r\n“are you going to allow the dynasty to fall like that?”\r\n\r\n“If the dynasty were wise, I certainly would do my best to support it,”\r\nwas the unexpected reply; “but the dynasty will not be wise; it will\r\nnever have the common sense to bring itself to conclude peace just now,\r\nand to enforce the conditions of that peace, even by measures of\r\nviolence against those who would undoubtedly oppose it. If I thought the\r\nRegent was strong enough and firm enough to arrest half the members of\r\nthe Corps Législatif, and to send the other half back to their own\r\nfiresides to meditate on the wisdom of a useless opposition, if she\r\nwould make up her mind to govern for a time without the Chambers, then I\r\nwould at once accept office; but she will never have the courage to take\r\nsuch a responsibility before the country, and therefore I cannot do\r\nanything for her. There are moments in the life of nations when it is\r\nindispensable for their welfare that those who govern them should feel\r\nno hesitation in resorting to violence, and France just now has reached\r\nsuch a moment. It is a thousand pities that the Regent or the Emperor\r\nfails to see it is the case. Under such circumstances my help would be\r\nuseless to them, and it might compromise my own future prospects.”\r\n\r\nThis conversation gives a very good insight into the character of M.\r\nThiers. It also accounts in part for the ruthlessness which he displayed\r\nin the crushing of the Commune a few months later.\r\n\r\nApropos of this, a few weeks before his death, I had the opportunity of\r\ntalking to him about it at St. Germain, whither he had repaired to spend\r\nthe summer, and where he was preparing himself for the struggle of the\r\ncoming elections, which he fondly hoped would prove fatal to the\r\ngovernment of Marshal MacMahon, whom he still expected to replace as\r\nhead of the State. Thiers was in a communicative mood that afternoon,\r\nand he spoke with great vivacity of that time when he had displayed such\r\nenergy, as his friends said--such brutality, as his foes maintained--in\r\nfighting the unruly and disorderly elements that had so very nearly\r\ndestroyed France. On that occasion he used these memorable words: “I\r\nknow that I have been severely blamed for the orders which I had given\r\nto Galiffet, to show no mercy to the insurgents, but, frankly, what else\r\ncould I do? We had just gone through an unfortunate war; the enemy was\r\nat our gates, we had to execute a most onerous treaty, and above all to\r\nclear our territory from the invader, who certainly would never have\r\nleft it, had he thought that this rebellion was going to take the upper\r\nhand. We had the whole country to reorganise, and this under the most\r\ndeplorable conditions that have ever existed in the life of a nation. We\r\nwere without an army, without any regular government, and had to fight\r\nthe many ambitions of those who thought to seek their own advantage out\r\nof the general ruin. The first thing to do was to strike fear into the\r\nhearts of those who already thought that they could bring their own\r\nparty to the head of affairs and thus add something to the general\r\nconfusion. Don’t forget that in order to oblige the Prussians to\r\nrecognise that we were strong enough to rule France, and to rule it\r\nwell, we had not only to assert ourselves, but also to drive out of the\r\nminds of all our opponents, and of these there were legions, the idea\r\nthat we had not got power enough on our side.\r\n\r\n“You tell me that the Commune might easily have been subdued on that\r\neventful and fatal 18th of March. This perhaps is true, because it did\r\nnot even exist at that time, and we were face to face with a simple\r\ninsurrection, not with a revolution. But would it have been wise? I\r\ndon’t think so. Had we not acted as if we were in presence of a real and\r\nearnest danger, had I not retired to Versailles in a hurry as I did, the\r\nmutiny of the 18th of March would have repeated itself a few months\r\nlater, and this sort of thing would have gone on continually. The\r\ngovernment would have been weakened quite uselessly, and the prestige of\r\nFrance fallen a little lower than was the case already. A revolution is\r\nan incident, perhaps sad and bloody, but an incident all the same;\r\nwhereas continual rebellions mean the demoralisation of a nation.\r\n\r\n“I knew that France was demoralised in the sense I mean, but why need\r\nthe world come to the same conclusion? Surely, none at all. Therefore we\r\nhad to show the world that we were a strong government, that, what is\r\neven more important, we _were_ a government, a fact which many people\r\ndoubted still; and that as such we were determined to enforce order, to\r\nenforce it in the most determined manner possible, even at the risk of\r\nspilling more blood than we would have cared to do at other times. Of\r\ncourse I could not foresee the excesses to which the Commune would\r\nresort, nor the murder of the hostages, or the destroying of half Paris\r\nby fire, but I will be frank with you, I much preferred this to the\r\nconsequences which would have ensued for the future of France, in an\r\nunsettled state of things such as would have resulted had the government\r\nof which I was the head not had occasion to show its energy and its\r\ndecision to make itself respected. Of course, when Bismarck saw that we\r\ncould cope with the situation, that we did not require his, or anyone\r\nelse’s help, he gave up all idea of making difficulties in the execution\r\nof the different clauses of the treaty of peace. The army also, having\r\njust returned from its captivity in Germany, required something to\r\ndivert it from the many anxious and rebellious thoughts it had had time\r\nto indulge in, during the long months of its imprisonment in German\r\nfortresses. The Commune came opportunely to allow it to let its thoughts\r\ndrift into another channel.\r\n\r\n“To resume the main point, I do not think that more indulgence towards\r\nthe rebels would have helped us to regain the position to which even as\r\na defeated nation we were entitled. For these reasons I do not regret\r\nthat I enjoined severity to the troops that entered Paris. This severity\r\nhad the result that out of the moral ruins left by the Empire, and those\r\nmaterial ruins which resulted from the fleeting victory of the Commune,\r\nrose a government which won for itself the respect of Europe, and the\r\nesteem of Germany, who, seeing what it was capable of, gave up every\r\nthought of putting difficulties in its way. No, when I remember all that\r\nhappened at that time, I cannot say I am sorry for anything I did, or\r\nwhich was done under my responsibility. I may deplore it, but I cannot\r\nregret it. One cannot be sentimental in politics.”\r\n\r\nI wrote down this conversation in my diary when I got home, and every\r\ntime I have the occasion to read it over again, I remember the vivacity\r\nwith which Thiers developed to me his ideas on this important subject,\r\nideas which I believe have never before been made known to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is strange how, with all his penetration, and his wonderful insight\r\ninto politics, Thiers did not foresee the circumstances that brought\r\nabout his own downfall. There were lacunes in that remarkable mind,\r\nlacunes which proceeded from his inordinate vanity. For instance, when\r\nhe had started on that journey across Europe, in order to implore her\r\nhelp during the Franco-German war, he never for one moment imagined that\r\nhe would be unsuccessful, or that his entreaties would be repulsed. The\r\nindifference with which the fate of his country was viewed beyond its\r\nfrontiers proved a terrible blow to the old man, who sadly said, or,\r\nrather, repeated, the famous words: “Il n’y a plus d’Europe,” when his\r\nlast hope, his trust in Alexander II. of Russia, also proved elusive.\r\nBut with his usual ability he managed to mask his defeat under the\r\npretext that neither Italy, Austria, nor Russia would have anything to\r\ndo with the Imperial regime, and that as they hadn’t been sure it was\r\ndefinitely to be classed among the past things of history, they had\r\nthought it best and wisest to remain neutral, and not to interfere with\r\nthe course of events. Out of that circumstance Thiers made enough\r\ncapital to ensure his own election as head of the government, and once\r\nestablished at Versailles in that capacity he felt sure that he would\r\nremain at his post until his death.\r\n\r\nHe had no real adversaries worthy of that name. With consummate skill he\r\nhad succeeded in entirely discrediting the Orleans princes by the\r\nwillingness with which he had helped them to get back their confiscated\r\nmillions, and he knew that henceforward they had made themselves\r\nimpossible. There was still the Comte de Chambord, but in his case\r\nThiers had at his disposal sources of information that left him no doubt\r\nas to the attitude that the latter would eventually take, if offered the\r\ncrown of his ancestors. The only adversaries he dreaded were, therefore,\r\nthe Bonapartes; and this danger seemed, for the present, to have drifted\r\naway by the death of Napoleon III. and the extreme youth of his son.\r\n\r\nWhether it was this last circumstance, or simply that his watchfulness\r\nhad relaxed, the fact remains that Thiers never noticed the storm that\r\nwas looming in the distance, and threatening him. And when an accidental\r\ncircumstance brought about his fall, in quite an unexpected manner, he\r\nwas more astonished than anyone else at the event.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he took it quite good humouredly, and with far more\r\nphilosophy than could have been expected from him. I saw him a few days\r\nafter it had occurred and was struck with his indifference. I think that\r\nupon the whole he was glad that his fall had taken place for a neutral\r\ncause, and that it had been his person that had been objected to rather\r\nthan his manner of conducting the government. He hoped that the future\r\nwould avenge him, and though such an old man, yet he was making plans\r\nfor the day when France would call him back to the head of affairs. He\r\nknew that no matter what his enemies might say, he had deserved and had\r\nearned the gratitude of his country, and won for himself a glorious page\r\nin its annals. And if the truth be told, he was rather glad to be once\r\nmore in the ranks of the opposition, and thus able to live over again\r\nthe past days, when a word of his could overturn a government. He\r\ndevoted all his energies to the struggle which he fully intended to\r\ninitiate against President MacMahon, whom he had never liked, even when\r\nhe had employed him, and whom he never forgave for having taken his\r\nplace. Thiers had always been of opinion that the Marshal’s intellectual\r\ncapacities were of the smallest kind, and that except honesty of\r\npurpose, he possessed none of the qualifications that are required of\r\nthe Head of a State. It was gall and wormwood to him, to find his place\r\nhad been taken by a man who would destroy some of his work, and a great\r\ndeal of his plans. So he devoted all his energies to prepare the defeat\r\nof the Marshal after the latter’s _coup d’état_ of the 16th of May.\r\n\r\nFate, however, interfered and carried off M. Thiers after an illness of\r\na few hours at St. Germain, where, as I have already related, he spent\r\nthe last summer of his life. In spite of his advanced age, he died in\r\nfull possession of his faculties, and with his intelligence as bright\r\nand clear as it had ever been. The emotion provoked by his death was\r\nconsiderable. The old man was, after all, more popular than one had\r\nthought, and the nation was very well aware that in burying him, she was\r\nalso burying a great patriot, who had been true to her in the hour of\r\nher greatest adversity. I followed in his funeral procession, and as we\r\nwere marching towards distant Père la Chaise, I heard the following\r\nremark which left a deep impression on my mind: the more so that it was\r\nuttered by a common workman whom certainly I wouldn’t have believed to\r\nbe capable of it: “Il avait des défauts, le petit homme, mais après tout\r\nc’est grâce à lui que Belfort est resté français!” (“He had his faults,\r\nthe little man; but, after all, it is thanks to him that Belfort\r\nremained French”).\r\n\r\nI think that Thiers would have thought, had he listened to these words,\r\nthat they constituted the best recognition that had ever been uttered of\r\nhis long life of service to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE COMTE DE CHAMBORD AND HIS PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nI had had the honour to be introduced to the Comte de Chambord in\r\nVienna, long before the fall of the Empire had once more put him forward\r\nas a Pretender to the throne of France; I had even once or twice been\r\ninvited to Frohsdorf. These visits always left me a sadder if not a\r\nwiser man. They were more like a pilgrimage to an historical monument,\r\nthan a visit to a living man. Everything seemed dead in that small,\r\nunpretentious house, for it could hardly be called a castle, in which\r\nthe last direct descendant of Louis XIV. was ending his uneventful\r\nexistence. The walls themselves told you of something that was past and\r\ngone, and the inhabitants of this living grave flitted like ghosts of\r\nthe great traditions that were embodied in them. Everything was\r\ndignified, solemn, and hushed. The rooms were small, but full of great\r\nthings and mementoes, from the large equestrian portrait of Henri IV.,\r\nto the stately picture of Louis XVI., and the smiling one of unfortunate\r\nMarie Antoinette. Lackeys in the blue livery of the House of France, met\r\nyou at the door, and ushered you into an unpretentious study, where,\r\nsitting at a table littered with books and papers, the Comte de Chambord\r\nwas awaiting his visitors.\r\n\r\nHe was a most charming man, with grand manners, and much stateliness,\r\nbut one on whom the many deceptions of his life had left their impress,\r\nand aged before his time. He always questioned all those whom he was\r\nabout France, Paris, and everything that was going on there, taking the\r\nliveliest interest in his country, but not understanding it at all, and\r\nnot realising that the France of after the Revolution was no longer the\r\nFrance which the old Bourbon monarch had ruled. He had strong\r\nprinciples, earnest convictions, was in the full sense of the term a\r\n“chevalier sans peur et sans reproche,” but he harboured no illusions as\r\nto his possibilities of playing any part in the political life of his\r\ncountry. Had he had any children it is probable that he would have tried\r\nto reconcile the traditions of his family with the requirements of\r\nmodern France, but in presence of the fact that with him the elder\r\nbranch of the House of Bourbon was coming to an end, he must have had\r\nthe feeling, though he never owned to it in public, that there was no\r\nnecessity for him to abdicate any part of the inheritance of his\r\nancestors, in order to benefit the Orleans dynasty who had sent his\r\ngreat-uncle to the scaffold, and had tried to dishonour his own mother.\r\nHe was too much of a gentleman not to have received with politeness the\r\novertures of his cousins when they made up their minds to come and pay\r\ntheir respects to him at Frohsdorf; but he could not, and would not,\r\naffect in regard to them a cordiality which he did not really feel.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Chambord was essentially _un homme d’autrefois_; he never\r\nshirked what he considered to be his duty, but who would never give\r\nhimself the appearance of liking what he did not, or of respecting what\r\ndid not deserve respect. He had grand manners that savoured of hauteur,\r\nand left one in no doubt as to what he thought or believed. Life had\r\nbeen one long disappointment to him, which he had accepted with a true\r\nChristian spirit, devoid of the slightest shade of rebellion, and he had\r\npicked up his burden, and carried it nobly to the end. He died wrapped\r\nin the folds of the old flag which he had refused to renounce, even\r\nwhen a crown would have rewarded him for its abandonment.\r\n\r\nAt Frohsdorf he led the existence of a country gentleman; there was no\r\nsemblance of a Pretender about him. As he once said to a visitor who\r\nvery tactlessly had remarked upon it: “I am not a Pretender, and do not\r\nneed give myself the appearance of one. I am a principal for those who\r\nsee in me their King.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was much that was kingly in that quiet Austrian domain, to\r\nwhich the Duchesse d’Angoulême had retired towards the end of her\r\nearthly career, and which she had bequeathed to her nephew. The big\r\ndrawing-room where one assembled in the evenings after dinner had a\r\nvague appearance of a palace, though the master of it did his best to\r\nput his visitors at their ease; but the Comtesse de Chambord sitting in\r\nher big arm-chair by a round table, upon which her needlework was laid,\r\nor bending over the stitches of her tapestry, looked every inch a\r\nsovereign, in spite of the knitted scarf which she often tied round her\r\nhead, or the extreme simplicity of her black silk dress, made quite high\r\nto the throat and finished by a plain white linen collar. The atmosphere\r\nof the room, too, was laden with a hush and solemnity that at once made\r\none feel and understand that one was not in the dwelling of a common\r\nmortal. These evenings were anything but amusing, though the Comte did\r\nhis best to keep the ball of conversation rolling; but somehow it was\r\nimpossible to give it a frivolous turn, or to drive away an impression\r\nthat everyone in the room was waiting for something. What, of course,\r\nwas not known; but one was waiting, waiting like the son of the murdered\r\nDuc de Berry had been waiting ever since his birth, for the call of his\r\ncountry, which never came, or at least not in the way in which he would\r\nhave cared to respond to it.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said concerning the attempt at a monarchical\r\nrestoration that had taken place during the presidency of Marshal\r\nMacMahon, and the circumstances which had accompanied it have not been\r\ncommented upon in a manner favourable to the Comte de Chambord. I was in\r\nVersailles at the time it occurred, and from what came to my knowledge I\r\ndo not think that the real reasons which influenced Henri V., as his\r\nadherents called him, have ever been known in their entirety. One has\r\nspoken of the flag and of the reluctance of the Pretender to accept the\r\ntricolour, but what has never been revealed to this day is that a\r\ncompromise had been suggested by a clever French politician who had been\r\nconsulted. Gifted with a singular gift of observation, this politician\r\nwas very well _au courant_ of the feelings of the different parties\r\nwhich were represented in the National Assembly, and consequently he was\r\nin a position to give sound advice to those who had recourse to his\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nHis compromise was that the national flag should remain the tricolour,\r\nwhilst the King would keep for his own personal emblem the white cravat\r\nof his ancestors, that alone would be borne before him on all State\r\nceremonies which were not purely military ones. Strange to say, the\r\nComte de Chambord had at first appeared willing to consent,\r\nunderstanding well, in spite of the prejudices of his earlier education,\r\nthat he would be obliged to make some concessions to the times before he\r\ncould hope to be accepted by France as its legitimate King. But, before\r\ngiving his final adherence to this compromise, he wished to know the\r\nopinion of his cousin, the Comte de Paris, and to learn from him whether\r\nor not he would, when in due course he succeeded him, ratify this\r\narrangement, and maintain its clauses. The Comte de Paris refused to\r\nassume the responsibility of saying yes, and replied evasively that his\r\nuncle the Duc d’Aumale ought to be consulted. The latter, however,\r\ndeclared that he could not advise his nephew, but that it would be\r\ndifficult in his opinion for an Orleans prince to forget that the fate\r\nof his dynasty was bound up with that of the tricolour banner, and that\r\nto renounce it even in part, was to renounce the glorious principles of\r\nthe Monarchy of July. This answer, when it became known to the Comte de\r\nChambord, did away with his last hesitation. Urged by the strong\r\ndynastic feelings that swayed him, he might have made up his mind to\r\nsacrifice some part of his principles to the welfare of his race; but\r\nonly if this sacrifice would have been of some use to it. Seeing that it\r\nwould only be interpreted as a desire on his part to put on his head a\r\ncrown he did not care for, and which in his inmost heart he did not\r\nthink he had either the strength or the ability to carry or to defend,\r\nhe gave up every idea of winning it by means of a compromise where, in\r\nthe best of cases, some of his own personal dignity would have\r\nfoundered; and after a short stay in France, he returned to his beloved\r\nFrohsdorf, to die there a few years later, the last of the Burgraves of\r\nhis generation.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to see him during the short stay which he made at\r\nVersailles under an incognito which was only discovered by a very few.\r\nWe took a walk together in the park, and along the alleys of that garden\r\nof Trianon, where the young and frivolous Queen, so brutally murdered by\r\nthe bloody Revolution which she had neither foreseen nor understood, had\r\nwalked together with the lovely Lamballe and her train of gay courtiers.\r\nEverything looked sad, and deserted, and abandoned; it all spoke of a\r\ndead past, and of a departed glory. Suddenly the Comte de Chambord\r\nstopped in his walk, and turning to me said those memorable words which\r\nI have never forgotten: “What a pity that this place was not entirely\r\ndestroyed in 1793!”\r\n\r\nI looked at him with surprise.\r\n\r\n“You are astonished to hear me say such a thing,” he continued, “but let\r\nme explain to you my thoughts, and you will understand me better.\r\nRoyalty, like so many other things, is a prejudice, at least for the\r\nmasses who have neither traditions nor principles. It represents, or at\r\nleast ought to represent to them, something that is strong, powerful,\r\nentirely above them, beyond them; something sacred, that no power save\r\nthat of God may touch or may destroy. Once this feeling concerning it is\r\ngone, half its prestige is gone too. The mob only respects what it can\r\nneither harm nor kill. If it once sees that royalty, like everything\r\nelse, can be touched with a sacrilegious hand, that it is at the mercy\r\nof the first boy or man in the street, then the mob not only loses every\r\nfear, but also its veneration. It rejoices to see that it has got over\r\nthe feeling of awe which formerly inspired it with regard to that\r\nsuperior thing which ruled it; it delights in pulling it down, and in\r\ntreasuring the remembrance of the day on which it smashed it to the\r\nground. Now nothing reminds one more of deeds done, whether good or bad,\r\nthan the spots where such deeds were committed.\r\n\r\n“The French people, when looking at Versailles, and walking freely\r\nthrough the rooms where Kings formerly reigned, can always think, speak\r\nand remember, with something of that low pride which a boxer feels when\r\nhe has knocked his adversary to the ground, of the time when they\r\ndestroyed the power which had ruled them, and feasted in the halls of\r\ntheir former masters. That remembrance is most unwholesome, and can only\r\nfoster rebellious feelings in the breasts of those who treasure it. Had\r\nVersailles been destroyed the Revolution of course would not have been\r\nforgotten, but the nation would not always have had before its eyes the\r\nsight of the monument of the fallen grandeur of its Kings. Facts are\r\nforgotten or lose their importance far quicker than one thinks; but\r\nplaces, and spots, keep their eloquence, and unfortunately keep it for\r\never.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked back towards the walls of the massive old pile,\r\nwhose many windows were blazing in the setting sun. And once more he\r\nsighed: “Yes, I do regret that this place has not been burned down and\r\ndestroyed; it would not have witnessed then the triumph of the\r\nvictorious Prussian eagle, and after that, what real French King would\r\ncare to live in it, even if a King ever reigns again in France!”\r\n\r\nHe sighed yet again, and we slowly retraced our steps towards the town.\r\nAs we passed the Castle gates, he stopped again: “Sic transit gloria\r\nmundi,” he quoted; “my glory, like that of my ancestors, has passed\r\naway; perhaps it is for the best after all, since I was not destined to\r\nsee my race continue!”\r\n\r\nMuch has been related concerning the interview which the Comte de\r\nChambord had with Marshal MacMahon, when he asked him whether or not he\r\nwould feel inclined to favour a monarchical restoration. It has been\r\nsaid that the old soldier, who without scruple had accepted the\r\nsuccession of Napoleon III., to whom he owed his title and his dignity,\r\nfound that his conscience would not allow him to “betray,” as he\r\nexpressed himself, the Republican government, at the head of which he\r\nhad been called by a parliamentary majority who had done so only in the\r\nhope that he would help it to reinstate its former Kings.\r\n\r\nThere is some truth in this reproach, because certainly MacMahon had not\r\nshown himself before, and did not show himself in the future, so very\r\nchary of offending public opinion as represented by the Legislative\r\nAssembly which was supposed to be the voice of the country. But in the\r\n_non possumus_ which he opposed to the restoration of the Comte de\r\nChambord,\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Pierre Petit, Paris._\r\n\r\nADOLPHE THIERS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Walery, Paris._\r\n\r\nMARSHAL MACMAHON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Pierre Petit, Paris._\r\n\r\nCOMTE DE CHAMBORD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Carjal, Paris._\r\n\r\nLEON GAMBETTA]\r\n\r\nthere was something else than the desire to remain himself at the head\r\nof the State. There was a tacit pledge which he had given to the Orleans\r\ndynasty to support its pretensions, and also the feeling that he did not\r\nenjoy sufficient popularity among the army to enforce a change of\r\ngovernment, and to bring back a dynasty which had been driven out of the\r\ncountry by its own faults. MacMahon was not clever, not far-seeing, but\r\nhe knew very well what the troops thought of him, and also that at that\r\nmoment the disaster of Sedan was not sufficiently forgotten for him to\r\nrisk being punished for it under another pretext, which his lending his\r\nhand to an attempt at a monarchical restoration would have furnished.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Chambord returned to Frohsdorf a sadder though not a wiser\r\nman. He was not fortunate in his advisers; the leaders of the Legitimist\r\nparty did not understand either the feelings of France nor the strength\r\nwhich they undoubtedly wielded at that particular moment. Instead of\r\ndoing their best to effect a reconciliation between the different\r\nopinions that divided the country, they tried, on the contrary, to\r\nexasperate them, and prevented their own triumph by the insolence with\r\nwhich they proclaimed everywhere that its hour had struck. France, at\r\nthat time, was like a man recovering from a severe illness, whose whole\r\nbody is sore, and who wants to be handled with the greatest gentleness.\r\nThe Legitimists ignored this condition, and loudly boasted that the time\r\nhad come when all past grievances would be avenged, and when they should\r\nbe allowed to rule according to their own prejudices, bringing back to\r\npower with them all the old traditions against which the saner elements\r\nin the land had risen in revolt eighty-five years before. They wanted to\r\nmake a clean slate, and wash out the remembrance of everything that had\r\ntaken place since Louis XVI. had been murdered on the scaffold. The\r\nfeeling might have been a natural one; the utterance of it was stupid in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nMany have wondered at the want of initiative shown by Henri V., as he\r\nwas called by his partisans. I, who have known him well, saw nothing\r\nextraordinary in this. As I have already hinted, he was quite willing to\r\nbe carried to the throne, but he had no desire to occupy it, and still\r\nless to step upon it bound by promises and pledges, which would have\r\ninterfered with his liberty of action, a thing of which he had always\r\nbeen extremely jealous. He had in him all the authority of the Kings his\r\nforefathers, and would no more have submitted to the advice of his\r\ncourtiers than he would have sacrificed his principles to win back his\r\nlost inheritance. He wanted, above all things, to keep his _libre\r\narbitre_, and this explains the apparent apathy with which he witnessed\r\nthe overthrow of what had been the hopes of his followers rather than\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nTwo years later I called upon the Comte de Chambord at Frohsdorf, during\r\nan absence of the Comtesse, in whose presence it was always more or less\r\ndifficult to discuss political questions, and we talked over those days.\r\nEvery hope of a monarchical restoration had faded then, and the Republic\r\nwas more or less an accomplished fact. He seemed to take it as a natural\r\nconsequence of all the mistakes committed by the different governments\r\nthat had ruled in France, and if the truth be told, I think he preferred\r\nits having overcome all opposition, to the possibility of its being\r\nsuperseded either by the Bonaparte, or the Orleans dynasty, which he\r\nrecognised, but could not accept as the successor of his own rights. The\r\ngrand seigneur that he was could not adjust himself to this hankering\r\nafter a “popularité de bas aloi,” as he described it, which had ever\r\ndistinguished the younger branch of the house of Bourbon since the days\r\nof Philippe Egalité. He refused to profess the theory that it did not\r\nmatter with whom one shook hands, provided one washed one’s own\r\nafterwards. On the contrary, he was of opinion that certain contacts can\r\nnever be got rid of, no matter how much soap and water one uses to\r\nefface them. It was partly on account of that feeling that he did not\r\nregret circumstances had interfered with the monarchical restoration,\r\nfor which so many people had hoped, and he made me understand what he\r\nthought of it by saying, among other things, that: “A royalty that has\r\nonce come down into the street is no longer royalty such as it was\r\nunderstood in the days of old, when the principle of the ‘droit Divin’\r\nwas the foremost among those one had been taught to respect and to\r\nworship. We Bourbons of the old stock cannot bow before the popularity\r\nof the mob, and try to make it accept our own. We can work for the\r\npeople, act in unison with the nation in all grave questions where its\r\nwelfare is in question; we cannot accept its sovereign right to dictate\r\nto us its laws. I know that my ideas are out of fashion, ‘que je suis\r\ndémodé,’ but whom do I hurt by clinging to my old traditions, to the\r\nancient glories of my house, which have also been those of France, it\r\nmust not be forgotten? If I had had children, I might have acted\r\ndifferently; I might, or I might not; and perhaps God has done well in\r\nrefusing them to me, as they would have been the source of much conflict\r\nin my mind. As it is I shall die solitary and alone, and with me shall\r\ndie the Bourbons of Louis XIV., those who have learnt nothing, and\r\nforgotten nothing, as our enemies aver.”\r\n\r\nHe said the last words smilingly and jestingly, and I could not help\r\nsmiling, too, though I well knew the latent sadness that was hiding\r\nunder his apparent mirth. He was still a handsome man at that time,\r\nthough far too stout, and his lameness, although not interfering with\r\nthe dignity of his manners, still took away from what otherwise would\r\nhave been an imposing figure. But the eyes had a wonderfully kind\r\nexpression, the noble, intelligent forehead revealed a grand nature and\r\na beautiful soul. One could not have passed him in the street without\r\nbeing struck by his appearance, and without noticing him, so completely\r\n“grand seigneur” was he, even in his most trivial gestures. Everyone who\r\nknew him liked him, respected him, bowed down before the purity of his\r\nlife, and the earnest, simple manner in which he performed all his\r\nduties, even the most trifling ones. He was one of those characters one\r\nmeets with but seldom, and which reconcile one with humanity.\r\n\r\nI never saw him again alive after that conversation, and only looked\r\nupon him once more when he lay on his bier, having hurried to Frohsdorf\r\nto attend his funeral. The face had an expression of great calm, and\r\nbore but few traces of the sufferings he had endured in his last\r\nillness. Bunches of roses were scattered on the linen sheet, that\r\ncovered him up to his chin, and over his feet was draped the white flag\r\nthat his ancestors had carried to victory; that flag over which he had\r\nwatched all his life, and which was to be buried with him in the little\r\nchapel of Goritz near the Adriatic Sea, far away from that France he had\r\nloved so well, from those vaults of St. Denis, whence his race had been\r\nexcluded for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ORLEANS PRINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that the Orleans Princes, at the time of which I am\r\nspeaking, had far more adherents than the Comte de Chambord.\r\n\r\nWhilst the latter kept aloof from the world in his haughty attitude, his\r\ncousins sought popularity by all means in their power, and wherever they\r\ncould hope to find it. They had in their favour, first their number, the\r\nbeauty of their women, their incontestable bravery, their unwearying\r\nenergy, and their courting of the mob. Against them was their excessive\r\navarice, and the eagerness with which they had hastened, as soon as the\r\ndoors of their fatherland were opened to them once more, to claim their\r\nconfiscated millions without allowing their thoughts to dwell for one\r\nmoment on the sad state in which their country was finding itself, nor\r\non the tremendous sacrifices it was voluntarily making in order to pay\r\nthe enormous war contribution exacted by Germany, in accordance with the\r\nTreaty of Frankfurt. In the claim they had put forward they had been\r\nencouraged by M. Thiers, who, shrewd politician that he was, wanted to\r\nmake them unpopular as pretenders, and to minimise the influence they\r\nmight otherwise have acquired. The fact was that this hasty step, which\r\nwould have passed unnoticed had they attempted it later on, made them\r\nlose considerable ground among people who would otherwise have looked up\r\nto them, because the idea of a Republic had not yet become familiar to\r\nthe public mind, and because the Orleans dynasty was essentially a\r\ndemocratic and middle-class one, whose instincts did not clash with\r\nthose of the governing and intellectual classes of France after the war\r\nthat had driven the Bonapartes out of the country. The reign of Louis\r\nPhilippe had not left bad memories; many even regretted it. The King as\r\nwell as his family had known how to appeal to the mob, and France had\r\nreached an epoch in her history, where the mob held the first place and\r\nhad to be reckoned with. The King’s sons had frequented public colleges,\r\nassociated with other young men of their age, and thus had given\r\nsatisfaction to the snobbish leanings which are perhaps more developed\r\nin Frenchmen than in any other nation, in spite of all their outcries\r\nfor equality and the abolition of all the privileges enjoyed in former\r\ntimes by the upper classes.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Aumale had even made himself popular, with a low kind of\r\npopularity of which he never succeeded in getting rid during the whole\r\ncourse of his life; but still he was popular in his way. I shall talk of\r\nhim later on, as he deserves a chapter to himself, and Chantilly, too,\r\nis worthy of a description not embodied in a few words. He was always\r\nconsidered to be the clever man of his family, and was the most\r\nrespected by his numerous nephews and nieces, partly on account of his\r\nlarge fortune, the inheritance of the Princess de Condé, and bequeathed\r\nto him by the last of that name and race. He had become the master of\r\nthe old home of the Condés, made illustrious by the Connétable de\r\nMontmorency, and the brave warrior known to his contemporaries by the\r\nname of Monsieur le Prince, and to history under that of the Great\r\nCondé. There was much of chivalry in the nature of the Duc d’Aumale,\r\nmore so, perhaps, than in the character of his brothers, who were less\r\nprincely in their manners and ways.\r\n\r\nThe head of this historic family, the Comte de Paris can be described in\r\nvery few words: he was essentially an honest man, but devoid of\r\ninitiative; timid in the manifestation of his opinions; an excellent\r\nsoldier, as he proved himself to be during the American war in which he\r\ntook part as a volunteer, but a mediocre officer--one born to obedience\r\nbut not reared to command; weak in character, but firm in his\r\nconvictions; an excellent father, a devoted husband, a dutiful son; a\r\nperfect King had he ever become one, so long as his country was\r\nprosperous, but an incapable one had it found itself in difficulties; a\r\nman always careful to fulfil his duties, but certainly not one who\r\ninspired love for those duties outside his own immediate family circle.\r\nHe did not possess any of the qualities of a Pretender, except domestic\r\nvirtues, which no one asked of him, and which even his best friends did\r\nnot require. Though he was head of his house, he never could divest\r\nhimself of an excess of deference to the advice of his uncles, and could\r\nrarely muster enough courage to speak or to act independently of them.\r\n\r\nThe only time he allowed himself to indulge in politics was at the\r\nperiod of the famous Boulangist agitation, when he made the rather naïve\r\nremark that he had been induced to take part in that intrigue because a\r\ngreat Christian like the Count de Mun, and a great lady like the\r\nDuchesse d’Uzès, were attracted to it. This attempt to restore the\r\nthrone of Louis Philippe by the help of an adventurer with a white\r\nfeather in his cap had, as is known, ended in a ridicule that had\r\nconsiderably shaken the personal position of the Comte de Paris, already\r\nmade insecure through his own and his partisans’ many mistakes. The\r\nComte had essentially a reasoning mind, but was always filled with\r\nabstract ideas; he could never put things on a practical ground. He had\r\nfew illusions but a false look out, as well as a wrong point of view.\r\nInstead of adopting one of two lines of conduct which would have been\r\nequally dignified--submission to the Comte de Chambord, or brave\r\nadherence to the principles of his ancestors and those of that dynasty\r\nof July, “la monarchie de juillet,” as it was still called in France--he\r\nhad taken a middle course, that of recognising the personality but not\r\nthe rights of his cousin. This made him bow down before the universal\r\nsuffrage that had proclaimed the Republic in the kingdom of which he\r\nwould in any case have been the lawful heir. He thought that by his\r\nattitude of absolute submission to the wishes of the nation he would\r\nhave inspired it with the desire to call him to its head. A false\r\nreasoning if ever there was one, that was to cause him to take many\r\nerratic and undignified steps, and which at last exiled him anew; an\r\nexile in which he remained until his death.\r\n\r\nThe only time that the Comte de Paris ventured openly upon a step which\r\ncould be construed as a manifestation of his pretensions to the throne\r\nof France was on the occasion of the wedding of his eldest daughter,\r\nQueen Amélie of Portugal, when he gave in his Paris residence, the Hotel\r\nGalliera, a reception at which all the pomp that attended royalty in\r\nformer days was displayed. It was as ill-timed as useless, and was the\r\npretext for his expulsion from his country, an expulsion that had been\r\nasked for a long time since by the Republican leaders, who did not care\r\nfor the nation to become used to the continued presence of the\r\ndescendants of its former Kings. He did not attempt to resist, though it\r\nis said that some of his partisans begged him to allow them to make a\r\nmanifestation in his favour; he embarked for British shores with a\r\nresignation that would have been admirable in a private person, but\r\nwhich was very near akin to cowardice in the representative of the\r\nDivine rights of Kings, those rights that Henri IV. knew how to impose,\r\neven on such great lords as the members of that powerful house of\r\nLorraine, who also, at one time, aspired to the throne that belonged to\r\nhim, and which he conquered at the point of his sword.\r\n\r\nPhilippe VII. was of a more pacific disposition than his illustrious\r\nancestor. He bade good-bye to his lovely castle of Eu, and settled at\r\nStowe House, the old residence of the Dukes of Buckingham, where he\r\nended his life, after cruel sufferings, borne with the patience that was\r\nthe distinctive feature of his honest, straightforward, and distinctly\r\nmiddle-class character. With the Comte de Chambord had disappeared a\r\nprinciple together with a man; when the Comte de Paris expired in his\r\nturn, there died a good and virtuous person but nothing else. He\r\nrepresented in the world his own estimable self, but not the royalty to\r\nwhich he had been born.\r\n\r\nAbout his son, little need be said. Gifted with a more adventurous\r\nspirit than that of his father, the Duc d’Orleans began his career by\r\nrisking imprisonment in France, when he appeared there to enrol himself\r\nin the ranks of her army. He has never made the least attempt to secure\r\na crown which does not even tempt him. He has led the life of an idle\r\nman of means, travelling about, playing at science when it suited him,\r\nignorant of the great aims of life; a man not even to be pitied, because\r\nmisfortune has never touched him; one who has never known what society,\r\nhis country, and the great name he bears required of him; who has\r\nlaughed at what his forefathers have always respected; who calls himself\r\nthe heir to all the Bourbons that have left their impress on history,\r\nbut who would be very sorry had he ever to follow in their footsteps;\r\nthe Republic can well afford to ignore him, because he would be the\r\nfirst to be embarrassed by its fall.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Orleans had no children by his marriage with an Austrian\r\nArchduchess, from whom he parted very soon after they had been united.\r\nHis only brother, the Duke of Montpensier, is still unmarried, and at\r\npresent the grandchildren of the Duc de Chartres constitute the hope of\r\nthe partisans of the Orleans dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Chartres was the one brilliant figure among the descendants\r\nof King Louis Philippe. There was something dashing about him that\r\nappealed to the imagination of people. When the Franco-German War broke\r\nout, he at once offered his services first to the Imperial, afterwards\r\nto the Republican, government, and when they had both refused them, he\r\nsucceeded in entering a regiment of volunteers, under the assumed name\r\nof Robert Le Fort, only the Comtesse de Vallon and one or two other\r\nfriends being aware of his identity.\r\n\r\nWhen the campaign was over he remained on active service, until the\r\nproscription that fell on his brother had also an influence upon his\r\nfate, and obliged him to retire into private life. He had been a great\r\nfavourite in Parisian society; men appreciated his wit, and women his\r\nchivalrous devotion to them. It is not an indiscretion to say that his\r\nlove affairs with the Princesse de Sagan were at one time a general\r\nsubject of conversation. He was always a welcome guest at a dinner\r\ntable, and a conspicuous figure in the hunting field, and succeeded\r\nbetter than any of his uncles and cousins in winning for himself the\r\nsympathies even of Republicans, who secretly feared his popularity among\r\nthe army and in his own regiment.\r\n\r\nHe was a born soldier, with all the intrepidity of the fighter who never\r\nshirks a battlefield. People liked him and respected him, because with\r\nall the sterling qualities of his elder brother, the Comte de Paris, he\r\nhad none of the latter’s apathy. Perhaps, if he had not been a younger\r\nson, he might have made an effort to win back the throne for his race.\r\nBut reared in principles of absolute submission to the head of his\r\nhouse, he never criticised anything his elders did, and though I have\r\nknown him intimately and well, the only time when I have heard him talk\r\npolitics was one afternoon at his little country home of St. Firmin on\r\nthe borders of the Forest of Chantilly, when the conversation turned on\r\nthe trial of Marshal Bazaine, over which the Duc d’Aumale had presided.\r\nThe Duc de Chartres happened to be in a communicative mood, and\r\nexpressed the opinion that he thought it had been a mistake on the part\r\nof his uncle to have accepted the task of judging the unfortunate\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army of Metz. He said that a member of the\r\nhouse of Bourbon ought not to have consented to appear before the public\r\nas a kind of avenger of wrongs in which politics had had so great a\r\npart. And he added these significant words: “We Orleans, more than even\r\nmembers of other royal houses, ought to avoid showing ourselves as\r\narbiters of another man’s fate. It is quite enough to have to carry into\r\nhistory the stigma that attaches to us ever since the trial of Louis\r\nXVI.”\r\n\r\nI looked up to him rather in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “I understand what you mean, and that you are surprised\r\nto hear me talk in the way I do, but you must not think that I have not\r\noften given a thought to that fatal act of my ancestor, when he helped\r\nan ungrateful nation to murder its legitimate King. You see, I belong to\r\nanother generation than the one which saw all those horrors, and I\r\ncannot consider them without deep regret and shame. I can understand a\r\ngood many things--cruelty, ambition, ingratitude, wickedness even--I\r\ncannot admit crimes against nature, and the vote of the Duc d’Orleans\r\nbelonged to that kind of crime. Beside it, the so-called--because I\r\ncannot look at it in that light since it was the result of the free\r\nchoice of a great nation--the so-called usurpation of my grandfather was\r\na small matter. It only offended and sinned against a principle, it did\r\nnot offend the natural feelings that ought always to be sacred to every\r\nman, no matter what position he holds in life. And when I reflect on the\r\ntrial of Marshal Bazaine, I cannot help thinking that my uncle would\r\nhave been better advised if he had kept aloof, and left to others\r\nthe task of asking from that victim of his ambition or of\r\ncircumstances--which it was, it is not for me to say--an account of his\r\nactions and an explanation of his deeds.”\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Chartres had married his cousin, the daughter of the Prince\r\nde Joinville and of a Brazilian Princess. His wife was a very\r\ndistinguished woman, who by her tact and her cleverness made herself\r\nuniversally liked. They had several children, and their eldest daughter,\r\nthe Princess Marie, who was married to a Prince belonging to the Royal\r\nHouse of Denmark, played at one time rather an important part in\r\nEuropean politics, thanks to the influence which she exercised over the\r\nmind of the Emperor Alexander III. of Russia. She died young, and the\r\nDuc did not survive her long. The Duchesse de Chartres, widowed and past\r\nmiddle age, now spends her time in her little home at St. Firmin, having\r\nsold the house in the Rue Jean Goujon, where she had lived with her\r\nhusband, and which at one time was a centre of reunion for a certain\r\nportion of Paris society. The only members of the family of Orleans whom\r\none can meet in the salons of the French aristocracy are the Duc and the\r\nDuchesse de Vendôme, who live at Neuilly, and go about a good deal. The\r\nComtesse de Paris comes sometimes to the capital, but never stays there\r\nlonger than for a few days, spending the rest of her time either in her\r\npalace of Villamanrique in Spain, or in her castle of Randan, near\r\nVichy, where her life is entirely given up to practices of devotion and\r\ngood deeds. All her daughters are married. Tragedy has broken the life\r\nof her eldest daughter, Queen Amélie of Portugal, but the Comtesse is\r\nplacid by nature, possessing something of the fatalism that ruled the\r\nComte de Paris, and that never disputes the decrees of a Providence it\r\nhas learned to bless whether it sends good or evil to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe future of the Orleans family, that promised to become so important\r\non returning to France after the fall of the Empire, proved to be quite\r\ninsignificant in so far as the destiny of France was concerned. The\r\nOrleans had neither the courage nor the energy, nor especially the\r\nunselfishness, to try to win back for themselves the position which they\r\nhad lost. They never had enough initiative, much less determination to\r\nbrave public opinion, and eat humble pie before the Comte de Chambord.\r\nThese things alone could have put them back on the height whence they\r\nhad fallen. But the descendants of Louis Philippe never could make up\r\ntheir minds to any resolution, whether grave or frivolous. They always\r\nprofessed the fallacious opinion that the will of a nation ought to be\r\nrespected, no matter how or in what way expressed. France was for them a\r\nmaster before whose decrees they never for one moment felt the\r\ntemptation to rebel. They accepted those decrees so well that now no one\r\ndreams of looking upon them as pretenders to anything, be it a throne,\r\nor simply the wish to have their word considered at times when the vital\r\ninterests of their country are at stake. They always talk, or rather\r\nallow their followers to talk, of their duties, of their fidelity to the\r\nprinciples that made their ancestors great, but in reality they have not\r\nthe slightest wish to put forward their persons in order to secure to\r\ntheir race anything beyond the millions which they already possess. The\r\nComte de Paris was a dreamer; the Duc de Nemours a saint; the Duc de\r\nChartres a soldier, never looking beyond the field of a soldier’s\r\nactivity; the Duc d’Orleans a man of the world; the Duc d’Aumale a\r\nscholar, immersed in his books and his artistic tastes. Among them all a\r\nman was wanted, and a King could not be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE DUC D’AUMALE AND CHANTILLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Aumale was certainly the one member of the Orleans family who\r\nmade the most friends for himself, and had the greatest number of\r\nadmirers. Whether this was due to his personal merits, or to the\r\nmillions which he inherited from the last Prince of Condé, it is not for\r\nme to say. He had plenty to give to others; it is but natural that these\r\nothers praised him in the hope he would give them a little more than he\r\nhad intended. He courted popularity, made sacrifices of pride,\r\nprinciples, and sometimes personal affections, in order to win it; and\r\nhe succeeded in a certain sense, at least from the point of view of\r\nthose who measure praise and blame according to the social standing of\r\nthe person to whom they deal it. He was more learned than clever, more\r\nclever than brilliant; his wit was inferior to his intelligence, but he\r\nhad cunning, a singular way of at once finding his personal advantage\r\nout of an entangled situation. He put his own wellbeing beyond\r\neverything else, and cared in reality only for his comforts and being\r\nleft alone to lead an easy, indolent existence among his books, his\r\npictures, his flowers, his manuscripts, all the magnificences of the old\r\nhome of the Condés. This he had restored with care and a singular\r\nartistic knowledge, and had succeeded in endowing it with some of its\r\npast glories.\r\n\r\nHe was a perfect host, even though, perhaps, a little dull; and one\r\nenjoyed a first visit to Chantilly more than a second, on account of\r\nthe necessity it entailed to perform with its master what is called “le\r\ntour du propriétaire,” to admire what he admired, to look only upon what\r\nhe showed you himself, and not to be allowed to roam at will in the\r\navenues of the park, or in the vast halls full of lovely things, and of\r\nremembrances of the past. One would have liked to spend hours\r\ncontemplating the wonders of art gathered under that roof, to examine\r\nthe sword of the Great Condé, or to look through the quantity of\r\ninteresting documents, historical and otherwise, that were kept in\r\nbusinesslike order in the great cupboards of the long library, whose\r\nwindows opened on the meadows, where probably the lovely Madame de\r\nLongueville had roamed together with one or other of her numerous\r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nThis solitary place required silence rather than the casual remarks\r\nwhich echoed through its corridors as the motley crowd generally met at\r\nthe Sunday breakfasts which the Duc liked to give. These breakfasts were\r\nquite a feature in the life of the master of this palace, and the\r\nqueerest assemblage of people could be met at them--Academicians,\r\ncolleagues of the Duc, military men, foreigners, scientists, diplomats,\r\nmen of letters and men of the world, ladies of the highest rank and\r\nactresses. He made no distinctions, and never cared whether he brought\r\ntogether people who agreed with each other or not. There was no link\r\nbetween his guests, who forgot all about those who had been their\r\ncompanions of the afternoon at Chantilly after that afternoon was over;\r\nthey never chatted together, and perhaps their host did not care for\r\nthem to do so. He liked to concentrate around his own person the\r\nattention of those who had partaken of his hospitality; he would have\r\nfelt offended had he caught them talking to each other, and not\r\nlistening exclusively to himself. He was full of attention to those whom\r\nhe guessed were admirers of his deeds or works, and took a deal of\r\ntrouble to show to self-made people that he esteemed them more than\r\nthose who were his equal in birth if not in rank. For instance, I\r\nremember one day when having at lunch the Duchesse de Noailles and\r\nMadame Cuvillier Fleury, the widow of his old tutor, he put the latter\r\non his right and the Duchesse on his left. The fact was instantly\r\nnoticed by a few Academicians, of what I would call the inferior ranks\r\nof the Academy, and instantly it was remarked what a kind, noble and\r\nattentive nature was Henri d’Orleans, Duc d’Aumale, who thus ignored the\r\nhigh standing of one of the noblest amongst the noble Duchesses of\r\nFrance in order to show gratitude to the relict of the man to whom he\r\nowed his moral training. This action of the Duke was just one of these\r\nthings he was so fond of doing, in order to provoke admiration. He liked\r\nto forget the exclusive traditions of his race whenever he thought that\r\nit would ensure for him the sympathies of the mob; that mob which his\r\nfamily had ever courted, to which it owed in part its fame and its\r\nsuccesses, and which despised it for the very facility with which it\r\nbowed down licking the very dust. Among all the opportunist Orleans the\r\nDuc d’Aumale was foremost.\r\n\r\nSince the death of his wife and children all his affections had\r\nconcentrated on his splendid Chantilly, the reconstruction of which had\r\nentirely absorbed him from the day of his return to France after the\r\nrevolution that had overthrown the Bonaparte dynasty. In spite of all\r\nthat has been said he had no political ambitions. He knew that he had no\r\nright to the crown of France, and that he could not pretend to it\r\nwithout foregoing all the principles which he did not possess, but which\r\nhe was supposed to represent. Having been sounded as to whether he would\r\naccept the Presidency of the Republic, he had consented to do so,\r\nbecause he had been told that he had to do it, but he did not regret\r\nthat, as events turned out, the candidature of Marshal MacMahon was\r\npreferred to his own. He returned to his country home, to his roses, his\r\npictures, his works of art, his horses, and his dogs, and took up again\r\nhis easy, happy, careless life as a grand seigneur of olden times,\r\nabsorbed in his books and studies, able to gather his friends round him\r\nwhenever he liked, and to do the honours of his stately domain. Fond of\r\nhunting the stag in his vast forests, he was not above coming to Paris\r\nwhenever he wanted amusements that would have been incompatible with the\r\ngrandeur of Chantilly--to kiss the hand of a Leonide Leblanc, or to\r\nenjoy an hour’s chat with the lovely Countess de Castiglione, whose\r\nbeauty then was on the wane. He was an amiable talker, rather dry in his\r\nremarks, but always ready to make use of his many remembrances and his\r\nvast erudition to add to the enjoyment of those with whom he was\r\nconversing. He told an anecdote pleasantly, and related an historical\r\nfact with a grand eighteenth-century manner, without offending the\r\nRepublican instincts of those who were listening to him.\r\n\r\nHis appearance was entirely that of a grand seigneur of old, no matter\r\nwhether he was dressed in his uniform or evening clothes, with the red\r\nribbon of the Legion of Honour across his chest, or whether he was met\r\nwalking in his park in corduroy trousers, and gaiters rather the worse\r\nfor wear. His thin, delicate features, with the white tuft on the chin,\r\nthe long, soft, silken moustache, and eyes with a haunted look, reminded\r\none of a picture by Velasquez or Van Dyck. The figure was slightly bent,\r\nbut wiry and agile, and had kept much of the elasticity of its younger\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHe talked quickly, sometimes sharply, but always with extreme courtesy,\r\nand even when disagreeing did so in most measured tones, and with the\r\nutmost care not to wound the feelings of those with whom he was in\r\ndiscussion. He had a sympathetic manner, but not a kingly one by any\r\nmeans. There was nothing regal about him, but there was also nothing\r\nthat was not gentlemanly in the fullest sense of the word. And\r\nsometimes, when one saw him leaning against the pedestal of the statue\r\nof the Connétable of Montmorency, which he had had erected in front of\r\nhis palace of Chantilly, or handling with love and reverence the sword\r\nwhich the Great Condé had carried at Rocroy, for one short, flitting\r\nmoment he gave one the impression that he was only the guardian of those\r\nhistorical relics of which he was master.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Aumale had never had the initiative to fight for the\r\nprivileges to which he had been born. In 1848, he was in command of an\r\nimportant army in Algeria, with which he might have fought the\r\ninsurrectional government with advantage. He either lacked courage, or\r\ndidn’t think it worth while to risk his own personal position as a\r\nfactor in the France of the future to do so. He resigned his command,\r\nwith more alacrity than dignity, and accepting as the decision of his\r\ncountry the rebellion of the few, retired to England, and with\r\noccasional stays in his Sicilian domains, near Palermo, he awaited in\r\nretirement and silence for the dawn of another day which would allow him\r\nto return to the France he liked so much and to the Chantilly he loved\r\nso well.\r\n\r\nWhen at last that moment came, his first care was to use his efforts to\r\navoid the possibility of a new banishment. In order to do this he opened\r\nhis doors wide to all political men and to all the literary celebrities\r\nof the day. His hospitality was unbounded; he flattered the middle\r\nclasses, who had suddenly become the leading force in France, with\r\nconsummate skill. He tried as much as he could to make others forget\r\nthat he was a member of the ancient house of Bourbon, with whose\r\ndestinies those of their country had been inseparably associated for\r\ncenturies. He strove always to appear to those whom he welcomed under\r\nhis roof as a private gentleman, the owner of an historical place, and\r\nas a member of that Academy to which he was so proud to belong, the\r\nmembership of which was dearer to him than all the glories of his race.\r\nHe democratised himself, if such an expression can be pardoned. He came\r\ndown from the throne, on the steps of which he had been born, into the\r\ncrowd with which he liked to mix himself, quite forgetting that this\r\ncrowd could at any minute descend to the gutter, whither they would drag\r\nhim too whether he liked it or not.\r\n\r\nThere came, however, a day in the career of the Duc d’Aumale when he\r\nfelt constrained to assert himself, when for once the blood of Henri IV.\r\nspoke in him. It was when he wrote to the President, Jules Grévy, that\r\nfamous letter which resulted in his being sent to join his nephew across\r\nthe frontiers of France. This letter was penned after the government had\r\nsent the Comte de Paris into an exile whence he was never to return, and\r\nhe himself had been deprived of his rank and command. The shock was\r\nterrible to him, and bitterly did he regret the attack of indignation\r\nthat had made him speak when he should have remained silent. As he said\r\nhimself many years later: “J’ai laissé parler mon cœeur, tandis que\r\nj’aurais dû écouter ma raison” (“I listened to my heart when I ought\r\nonly to have heard my reason”).\r\n\r\nHe retired to Brussels, which was nearer than England to the royal home\r\nhe had adorned with such loving care, in the hope to bequeath it to his\r\nrace, a living memento of the glories of their ancestors. When he saw\r\nhimself parted from Chantilly, especially when it became evident to him\r\nthat he would remain in exile until death released him, he took a\r\nresolution which, better than anything else, proves that in his heart\r\nand mind his family held but a small place.\r\n\r\nHe made a will by which he left Chantilly, its collections, its\r\ntreasures, its library, its historical documents, its park and forests\r\nto the French Academy. And he divulged his intention in the hope that,\r\nas a reward for the splendid gift he was making to her, France would\r\nonce more admit him within her doors, and by restoring him to his home\r\nthank him for having given it to her.\r\n\r\nThis act of selfish generosity has been very differently commented upon.\r\nWhilst many have admired it, a few old men and women, born and bred in\r\nideas of an age when traditions, love for one’s race, and desire to help\r\nit to keep its high position and its inheritance were uppermost, have\r\nbitterly reproached him for having thus transgressed traditions that\r\nought to have been sacred to him.\r\n\r\nThis attack of “Christian generosity,” as someone wittily termed it,\r\nwhich made him not only forgive the injury that had been done to him,\r\nbut even reward by a kingly gift the injustice of a country which had\r\nused him so mercilessly, not only estranged him from his family, which,\r\nthough it said nothing, thought a great deal, but also made him lose the\r\nsympathies of many former partisans of the Orleans dynasty. This\r\nalienation of the home of the Condés, in favour of a Republican\r\ngovernment, made all realise that whatever were the qualities of the Duc\r\nd’Aumale, they were obscured by his unlimited selfishness.\r\n\r\nFrance also felt the degradation of this gift, and did not hasten to\r\nreward the donor of it as he had expected. She left him for some months\r\nin Brussels, alone with the shame of his unworthy action, until at last\r\nan advocate of talent, Maitre Cléry, succeeded in obtaining from\r\nPresident Carnot the repeal of the decree which had banished the Duke\r\nfrom France. He thereupon returned in haste to his beloved Chantilly,\r\nwhere he took up again his former existence, with the difference that\r\nwhen he received at his table the members of the Academy he used to tell\r\nthem: “Maintenant vous êtes ici chez vous, messieurs” (“Now you are at\r\nhome”). It was related at the time that a member of the learned Assembly\r\ntook this opportunity to entreat the Duke to change the place of a\r\ncertain picture which he thought had not been put where it ought to have\r\nbeen hung. Henri d’Orleans’ eyes flashed with indignation at this\r\naudacity, and drawing himself up very haughtily he said: “Vous vous\r\noubliez, monsieur” (“You forget yourself, sir”), to which, nothing\r\ndaunted, the impertinent visitor remarked: “Mais, puisque vous venez de\r\ndire que nous sommes chez nous, monseigneur” (“But you have just said\r\nthat we are at home, sir”).\r\n\r\nMaitre Cléry, to whom the Prince owed his return from exile, did not\r\nknow him personally, and had never been among those whom he had invited\r\nto his receptions. Consequently his action when he undertook to plead\r\nthe cause of the Duc d’Aumale with the President of the Republic was\r\nabsolutely disinterested. He had, however, expected a word of thanks for\r\nhis intervention in the matter. That word was a long time in coming, too\r\nlong, perhaps, in the opinion of some people. When at last the\r\ncelebrated advocate received an invitation to lunch at Chantilly, he\r\nremarked that it came like mustard after dinner--“comme de la moutarde\r\naprès dîner.”\r\n\r\nThe last years of the life of the Duc d’Aumale were saddened by\r\nuncongenial family stories and incidents, in which his nephews--so\r\ngossip said--figured in rather an unpleasant light. Angry beyond words\r\nat these rumours, his relations with his people became more and more\r\ndistant and estranged, and the big family parties that he liked to\r\ngather round him in former times took place no more. He kept himself\r\namong a small circle of friends, and in the society of Madame de\r\nClinchamps, a former lady-in-waiting of the Duchesse d’Aumale, whom he\r\nmarried secretly, and who--and this is very characteristic of him--he\r\nleft very badly off after his death, with nothing but a small pittance\r\nout of his many millions. Madame de Clinchamps was invariably amiable.\r\nShe appeared at the lunches given at Chantilly, and visitors found her\r\nsitting by the fire in the tapestried drawing-room, where the Duc used\r\nto receive his guests. She did not put herself forward in any way, and\r\nnever attempted even to do the honours of the place. She must have\r\nreally loved the Duc, or else she would never have put up with the\r\nslights he showered upon her, or accepted the false position in which he\r\nleft her, and her devotion to him never failed up to his death, after\r\nwhich she retired to a small house on the edge of the Forest of\r\nChantilly, where, at the time I am writing, she lives in strict\r\nretirement and in comparative poverty.\r\n\r\nI have met most of the celebrities of modern France at the Duc\r\nd’Aumale’s lunches. He was very catholic as to the people whom he\r\ninvited, and only required them to be amiable and to listen well to him,\r\nwithout attempting to interrupt. Among his great friends was Jules\r\nLemaitre, the Academician, an amusing, intelligent little man, rather\r\nvoid of manners, who buzzed about in a way that would have been\r\naggressive had it not been so funny. He was full of wit, but sometimes\r\nsaid gauche things, the value of which did not appear to strike his\r\notherwise critical mind. For instance, one day, whilst the Duc was\r\nshowing to his visitors a lovely collection of miniatures of the Royal\r\nFamily of France, from the end of the eighteenth century, he interrupted\r\nhim with the question: “And where, sir, do you keep the letters of M.\r\nCuvillier Fleury?” The late Duc de la Trémouille was standing next to\r\nme; we looked at each other, and smiled. Evidently a member of the\r\nFrench Academy of the end of the nineteenth century could not feel the\r\nslightest interest in anything else but Cuvillier Fleury, the bourgeois\r\ntutor of a bourgeois pupil, such as the Duc d’Aumale had proved himself\r\nto be in the eyes of a certain number of the people whom he had made his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBonnat, the painter, was also a frequent visitor at Chantilly, and his\r\nportrait of the Duc is one of the best pictures that ever came from his\r\nbrush. The Prince is represented in the uniform of a general, perhaps\r\nthe same which he wore on the day when, with a cruelty one would have\r\npreferred not to have seen in him, he condemned Marshal Bazaine to an\r\nignominious death.\r\n\r\nIt is related that the Duc d’Aumale used to say that he would like to\r\ndie at Chantilly, and that he had even left directions how his funeral\r\nwas to take place. In them he expressed a wish to lie in state in the\r\nchapel for a day or two, near the hearts of the Princes de Condé, buried\r\nthere and respected by the Revolution of 1789. This desire was not\r\ndestined to be fulfilled. He breathed his last in Sicily, at his castle\r\nnear Palermo, and his mortal remains were brought back straight to the\r\nfamily vault at Dreux. Chantilly stands empty and deserted now, save on\r\nthe days when tourists invade it, and roam in the rooms which have rung\r\nwith women’s soft laughter and listened to so many momentous and\r\ninteresting conversations. No one, even among the old servants still\r\nleft in charge of the place, ever talks of the Duc d’Aumale, and mention\r\nis only made of the former lords of the Castle, of those illustrious and\r\nunfortunate Princes de Condé, the souls of whom still fill the old walls\r\ntheir fame has immortalised for ever. In the Gallery des Batailles, as\r\nit is called, the sword of the hero of Rocroy still hangs, tarnished\r\nwith age, but now no reverential hand ever lifts it; only the heavy\r\nfingers of a sleepy housemaid dusts it now and then. The pictures, the\r\nportraits, the works of art are in the same place they occupied when an\r\nintelligent master had arranged them with loving care. In the long\r\ndining-room the table at which so many celebrities and high-born people\r\nsat is still there, with chairs standing round it; in the drawing-room\r\nthe two arm-chairs the Duc and Madame de Clinchamps used to occupy are\r\nin the same place; and in the library the inkstand has been left open\r\nwith its pen lying beside it. Everything seems a little dingy, a little\r\nempty, a little forsaken, everything has the appearance of one of those\r\nvast temples of old, whence, according to the words of the Russian poet,\r\n“the idols have fled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY OF MARSHAL MACMAHON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a coalition of the different parties who constituted the Right in\r\nthe National Assembly overturned M. Thiers, it was felt everywhere,\r\nthough perhaps none would say it aloud, that this event was but the\r\nfirst step towards the re-establishment of a monarchy, which could only\r\nbe that of the Orleans family. In fact, the Chamber was almost entirely\r\ncomposed of Orleanists. The few Bonapartists were too timid to come out\r\nopenly as such after the catastrophes that had accompanied the fall of\r\nthe Empire, but they were determined nevertheless to do their best to\r\nbring the Prince Imperial back to France as Emperor. There were but few\r\nextreme Radicals in the Assembly. Gambetta was perhaps the most advanced\r\nmember in that direction, together with Jules Ferry and Jules Favre, and\r\ntheir Radicalism would be considered Conservatism nowadays. In fact, the\r\nLeft, or what was called the Left, resembled rather an opposition as it\r\nis understood in England, than a revolutionary party such as later on\r\ntried to snatch the government of the country into its hands. France was\r\nstill under the influence of the eighteen years of Imperial regime it\r\nhad gone through, and respect for authority had not yet died. The\r\nelections, which had been conducted under the eyes of the enemy, had\r\nbrought back a large monarchical majority to the Assembly. That majority\r\nknew very well that so long as M. Thiers remained at the head of the\r\nRepublic, a restoration, either of the Comte de Chambord, the Comte de\r\nParis, or the Prince Imperial, was not to be thought of. The little man\r\nwould have defended his own person in defending the Republic. His manner\r\nof crushing the Commune, indeed, had shown that he would not hesitate\r\nbefore a display of force, and would be quite capable of sending to\r\nprison the leaders of any movement to destroy the government over which\r\nhe presided.\r\n\r\nBut when M. Thiers had been put aside, the field was free to the\r\nRoyalists, and in order to pave the way to a restoration they offered\r\nthe Presidency of the Republic to the Duc d’Aumale, in the hope that he\r\nwould see his way to resign his functions to his nephew, and be strong\r\nenough to bring him back in triumph to the Elysée.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Aumale accepted. Whether he would have fulfilled the hopes\r\nthat had been centred in him is another question. My opinion is that he\r\nwould have shown himself even more respectful of the Republic who had\r\ncalled him to her head than M. Thiers or Marshal MacMahon. But we need\r\nnot go into suppositions, as his election did not take place on account\r\nof the Bonapartists refusing to vote for him, being frightened at the\r\nthought that he might feel tempted to accomplish another _coup d’état_,\r\nand at all events would exclude them from the ranks of his advisers. The\r\nDuc d’Aumale once put aside, there remained but two people whose names\r\ncould have rallied around them the different parties that constituted\r\nthe Assembly; they were Marshal Canrobert and Marshal MacMahon.\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned was chosen partly because some believed he was more\r\nfavourable than his illustrious colleague to the idea of an Orleanist\r\nrestoration, partly because it was hoped that he would allow others to\r\ngovern in his name. They forgot that, being used to obedience in\r\nmilitary matters, he would insist on being listened to on political\r\nissues, and that his very honesty would not allow him to associate\r\nhimself with intrigue in governing the country, whose welfare he would\r\nconsider it was his duty to promote above all other considerations.\r\n\r\nMarshal MacMahon was essentially a gentleman. Not superabundantly gifted\r\nwith intelligence, not, perhaps, possessing much strength of character,\r\nhe had, nevertheless, a keen sense of right and wrong, a horror of\r\nanything that approached intrigue, a great respect for his duty, before\r\nthe accomplishment of which he never hesitated no matter how painful it\r\nmight be for him to perform it. He was a brave soldier, an honest man,\r\nbut he was no politician, and whenever he tried to interest himself in\r\npolitics he failed utterly in his attempts, partly through want of\r\nexperience, partly through want of knowledge, and especially because he\r\nnever knew how to find among the people who surrounded him a majority of\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\nHe never understood why he had been elected President of the Republic,\r\nand always imagined that he owed it to his personal merits. This\r\nillusion was carefully fostered by his entourage, and by ministers who\r\nwanted to persuade him to adopt their own views. It was a great mistake\r\non their part, because had the Marshal been less sure of the\r\ninfallibility of his own judgments, he might not have risked the _coup\r\nd’état_ of the 16th of May, which threw France into the arms of the\r\nextreme Republican and Radical parties, which have ruled it ever since.\r\n\r\nThe first ministers of MacMahon were Orleanists of the purest water, and\r\nthey did their best to bring the Orleans dynasty back to the throne,\r\nespecially after the publication of the famous letter of the Comte de\r\nChambord, which sealed for ever his fate as a Pretender. They were all,\r\ntoo, gentlemen by birth and by education, and men of learning and\r\nexperience. Two among them, the Duc de Broglie and the Duc Decazes, have\r\nleft their impress on the history of France, and deserve its gratitude\r\nfor the services they have rendered to her. But all of them were utopian\r\nin the sense that they believed in the triumph of the opinions they\r\nheld. They never admitted the possibility of new people coming to the\r\nfront, new ideas developing so quickly that they would have to be\r\nreckoned with by every government no matter to what shade it belonged.\r\nMore especially did they fail to foresee the triumph of the Radical and\r\nrevolutionary elements. They considered them as of no serious\r\nimportance, perhaps because they had never troubled to study them\r\ncarefully, and so appreciate their strength.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Duc d’Aumale, when sounded as to whether or not he\r\nwould accept the Presidency of the Republic, and under what conditions,\r\nhad replied: “Je veux bien être une transaction; une transition jamais.”\r\nMarshal MacMahon was to form the bridge of transition from the\r\ngovernment of a gentleman to that of a political man, such as the\r\nPresidents who have succeeded him have all essentially been. He brought\r\nwith him to the Elysée traditions that are still respected, and customs\r\nthat have become a dead letter since his fall. His tenure of office was\r\nattended with great dignity, and an amount of state that savoured a\r\nlittle of real Court life such as he had known and understood how to\r\nrepresent. He did not indulge in petty economies unworthy of his high\r\nposition, and kept open house for his followers and friends, dispensing\r\nat the same time a generous and unbounded hospitality in regard to all\r\nwho came to pay their respects to him in his capacity as First\r\nMagistrate of the French Republic. His wife, too, the Duchesse de\r\nMagenta, was a really great lady, by birth as well as by education, and\r\nshe seconded him to the best of her ability--entertaining for him on a\r\ngrand scale, receiving foreign ambassadors with a queenly grace combined\r\nwith the affability of a true _grande dame_. La Maréchale, as she was\r\nfamiliarly called by her friends, was a remarkable woman in her way, and\r\nit is very much to be regretted that she refused the whole time that her\r\nhusband remained in office to interest herself in public affairs, from\r\nwhich she kept aloof as much as she possibly could; she was exceedingly\r\ngenerous, and the poor of Paris remember her to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marshal had to retire into private life, it was found that he\r\nhad not only spent all the allowance that he received from the State,\r\nbut also a great deal of his own private fortune, so that when he gave\r\nup his high office, he was a poorer man than when he had entered upon\r\nit. The Duchesse de Magenta, when she became a widow, was left with less\r\nthan moderate means, and had to lead a simple existence, devoid of\r\naccustomed luxuries. She was a very modest woman, and it is related that\r\nshe was often to be met in the morning riding in an omnibus, with a\r\nbasket on her arm, doing her own marketing in company with her cook or\r\nhousemaid. France did not show herself grateful for the services which,\r\nin spite of his many political errors, Marshal MacMahon undoubtedly\r\nrendered to her, and did not trouble itself as to the fate of his widow\r\nor his children. The Duchesse only received the pension attached to the\r\nmilitary position which her late husband had occupied, and had her son,\r\nthe present Duc de Magenta, not married the daughter of the Duc de\r\nChartres, the Princess Marguerite of Orleans, he would have hardly had\r\nenough to live according to the exigencies of his rank as a captain in\r\nthe French army. The example is rare, and ought not to be forgotten,\r\nespecially nowadays, when the first preoccupation of people in power is\r\nto lay aside as much money as they can against the time when they have\r\nto abandon office.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time that Marshal MacMahon remained at the Elysée he\r\nkept beside him, in the quality of private secretary, the Vicomte\r\nEmmanuel d’Harcourt, one of the pleasantest, most amiable, and most\r\nintelligent men in Paris society. He was perhaps the only real statesman\r\namong the many politicians who surrounded the President, and, had he\r\nonly been listened to, it is probable that the monarchical restoration,\r\nso much desired at that time by all the sane elements in French\r\npolitical life, could have been brought about. Unfortunately, the\r\nmajority did not credit him with being in earnest, and the few who did\r\nso were too much afraid of him not to do all that was in their power to\r\ncounteract his influence on the Duc de Magenta. It is related that one\r\nevening when the President happened to be irritated by all these\r\nperpetual hints he was receiving concerning Monsieur d’Harcourt, he\r\nasked him abruptly: “Pourquoi, est-ce que vous tenez à rester auprès de\r\nmoi, et que vous ne cherchez pas à faire partie d’une combinaison\r\nministérielle?” (“Why do you care to stay with me, why don’t you try to\r\nenter into a Cabinet?”) The Vicomte simply replied: “Parce que j’ai de\r\nl’affection pour vous, Monsieur le Maréchal, et que je ne tiens pas à\r\nvous abandonner aux mains de ceux qui n’en ont pas” (“Because I have an\r\naffection for you, Monsieur le Maréchal, and I don’t care to abandon you\r\nto those who haven’t”).\r\n\r\nMacMahon became very red, but never more after that day did he try to\r\nwound the feelings of a man in whom he recognised a sincere friend.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party has always accused Monsieur d’Harcourt of having\r\ninspired the famous letter which the Marshal addressed to Jules Simon,\r\nand which brought about what is known as “the crisis of the 16th of\r\nMay.” This reproach was partly true and partly unjust. It is quite\r\ncertain that the Vicomte encouraged the President to dismiss a Cabinet\r\nwhich he considered far too advanced in its opinions, and especially\r\nbecause he could not agree with the ideas of Jules Simon, its chief,\r\nnotwithstanding the great intelligence and the sincere patriotism of the\r\nlatter. But, on the other hand, it must be said, and it cannot be\r\nrepeated too loudly, that Emmanuel d’Harcourt always told the President\r\nthat he could not venture upon such a grave and important step without\r\nevery possible precaution to ensure its success. First of all he advised\r\nthe exercise of a considerable pressure on the new elections that were\r\nbound to follow upon such a step and the imprisonment of a few leaders\r\nwhose influence might make them turn against the government. He was a\r\npartisan of strong measures, and had that contempt for legality that all\r\ndaring statesmen have ever professed. The Marshal, on the contrary,\r\nwould never have dreamed of defying the law, and he refused to adopt any\r\nof the measures which not only his secretary but also his\r\nministers--with the exception of the Duc de Broglie, whose rigid\r\nProtestant principles, which he had inherited from his mother, prevented\r\nhim from resorting to any violent actions--recommended to him. I have\r\nheard that on the eve of these elections, which had such an enormous\r\ninfluence on the future destinies of France, the Vicomte d’Harcourt was\r\ndiscussing them with M. de Fortoul, who was Minister of the Interior,\r\nand they were both deploring the obstinacy of the President of the\r\nRepublic, who would not understand that once he had entered upon the\r\nroad of resistance to the wishes of the Chambers, represented by the\r\nministers whom he had dismissed, he was bound to go on and to enforce\r\nhis wishes upon the nation. Fortoul knew he had been called by the\r\nconfidence which the Duc de Magenta had in his honesty to the difficult\r\npost which he occupied, but he was well aware that he did not possess\r\nthe latter’s sympathies, so asked the Vicomte d’Harcourt whether there\r\nwas no means by which the Chief of the State could be convinced that it\r\nwould be cowardice not to see to the bitter end the adventure in which\r\nhe had engaged himself. He got from him this characteristic reply: “No!\r\nOne cannot convince him; because he is a man who, though in a position\r\nto command, has never forgotten how to obey.”\r\n\r\nFortoul understood, and did not attempt further to shake the convictions\r\nof the President, but prepared himself to lose the game which with a\r\nlittle energy might so easily have been won.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel d’Harcourt was the man who best understood that honest, feeble,\r\nand in some parts enigmatical character of Marshal MacMahon. Apart from\r\nhim it is to be doubted whether anyone save the Marquis d’Abzac, who was\r\nattached to his person during long years, ever guessed what went on in\r\nthat narrow but well-intentioned mind. The Marquis d’Abzac was at one\r\ntime a leading figure in Paris society, and I think that no one who has\r\never known him has forgotten the charming, amiable man he was, the\r\nperfect gentleman he always showed himself, and the true friend he\r\nremained to all those who had treated him as such. He was the leading\r\nspirit of the little Court of the Elysée, where he organised all the\r\nballs and receptions that gave it such brilliancy during the tenure of\r\noffice of the Duc de Magenta, when all that was illustrious in France,\r\neven the most confirmed Royalists, considered it an honour to pay their\r\nrespects to the Head of the State and to his amiable wife. He had the\r\nentire confidence of the President, who, perhaps, was more inclined to\r\ngive it to a soldier like the General d’Abzac than to a civilian with\r\nwhom his military soul had but little in common, and whose subtleties of\r\nreasoning appeared too complicated for his simple mind. The Marquis had\r\nmarried a Russian, Mlle. Lazareff, whose mother had been a Princess of\r\nCourland, related to the famous Duchesse de Sagan. His wife had vast\r\nestates in Silesia, and though he did not live with her yet he visited\r\nthere often, and always made an appearance at the German Court, where he\r\nwas essentially a _persona grata_, ever since he had accompanied Marshal\r\nMacMahon when the latter had been sent to Berlin as an Ambassador of\r\nNapoleon III. to represent that Sovereign at the coronation of William\r\nI. as King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nVery often his visits to the German Court allowed him to clear up\r\nmisunderstandings between the French Government and the Prussian Foreign\r\nOffice; misunderstandings that were often provoked by the state of\r\nantagonism which existed between Prince Bismarck and the French\r\nAmbassador, the Vicomte de Gontaut Biron, about whom I shall have more\r\nto say presently. The German Chancellor liked the Marquis d’Abzac, and\r\nfrequently took him into his confidence, well aware of his tact and\r\ndiscretion. I have heard from a person very much _au courant_ of what\r\nwas going on in the Wilhelmstrasse, that Bismarck once expressed himself\r\nto the aide-de-camp of the President of the French Republic, concerning\r\nthe monarchical intrigues that were going on in Paris. He spoke with a\r\nmixture of contempt and regret of the woeful way they were conducted,\r\nand of what small chances they had of being successful. D’Abzac replied\r\nthat of course it was not for him to venture an opinion on a subject\r\nthat did not enter at all into his activities, but that he had always\r\nimagined that Prussia was very much adverse to the re-establishment of a\r\nMonarchy in France. The Prince immediately replied: “You are entirely\r\nmistaken, we have nothing against it, our objection is to the people\r\nwho would inevitably come into power and prominence with it. If we could\r\nsee in Paris a King without those who want at the present moment to\r\nproclaim him, we should, on the contrary, feel far more reassured than\r\nwe do now at the immediate future both of France and of Germany. Neither\r\nthe Comte de Paris nor the Prince Imperial would, nor could, risk\r\nposition by declaring a war against us, the price of which might be the\r\nloss of the newly recovered throne. But we greatly dread all the\r\ncouncillors and advisers who would be eager to prove before the country\r\nwho had sent them to represent it, that they had been right in changing\r\nthe form of the government, because the one whom they had helped to call\r\ninto existence was ready to win back for the nation the provinces as\r\nwell as the prestige that it had lost.”\r\n\r\nLater on, when speaking of this remarkable conversation with one of his\r\nintimate friends, the Marquis d’Abzac had been obliged to own that the\r\nGerman Chancellor had been right in his appreciation of a situation he\r\nunderstood better than did many Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the obstinacy that was one of the\r\ncharacteristics of MacMahon. Those who induced him so unnecessarily to\r\nassert himself in regard to Jules Simon, played on that chord when they\r\npersuaded him that it was his duty to check the growing tide of\r\nRadicalism, and to attempt to save the Republic from those who were\r\nleading it into a path which would alienate from it the sympathy of\r\nEurope, at a time when France sorely needed this support. He imagined\r\nthat by dismissing his Cabinet he was doing a great thing for his\r\ncountry, but being the faithful slave of his convictions, i.e. that the\r\nnation ought to be free to express its opinions and its wishes as to the\r\nform of government it liked, he did not pursue what he had begun so\r\nwell, and refused to allow the Cabinet whom he had called together to\r\nfight the battle to the bitter end. For thus he might have ensured, with\r\nthe help of some moral pressure, the triumph of the step which he had\r\ntaken more violently than wisely. The result is well known, and though\r\nthe death of M. Thiers, which happened on the very eve of the elections,\r\ncarried away one of his greatest and most powerful adversaries, yet the\r\nRadical party secured a complete victory. One of the greatest mistakes\r\nthat Marshal MacMahon ever made in his life was in failing to resign\r\nwhen the result of the elections became known. He sacrificed his\r\nministers, he allowed those who had borne the brunt of the battle to be\r\nousted out of the field and almost out of political life, which for some\r\nof them remained fast closed after that experience, and he himself,\r\ninstead of following them in their retreat, remained still Head of the\r\nState, and continued to occupy the Elysée, losing the esteem of those\r\nwho had considered him, until that time at any rate, a respectable\r\nnonentity. He received the new ministers whom his own stupidity had\r\nbrought into power, he still discussed with them, and he went on trying\r\nto push forward his own opinions and his own wishes, unobservant of all\r\nthe slights that were continually poured upon him. The only time that\r\nhis Cabinet seriously tried to assure itself of his help in a matter of\r\ninternational politics--the advisability of making some advances to\r\nRussia in view of a possible _rapprochement_ in the future--he violently\r\nopposed the idea, invoking the remembrances of the Crimean War, which,\r\nas someone wittily remarked, “he had gone through, but not outlived.”\r\nAfter that no one attempted even to keep him in the current of the\r\naffairs of the government, and after the elections which took place in\r\nthe Senate, and which resulted in a majority holding the same ideas as\r\nthose which already existed in the Chamber, the Marshal himself saw that\r\nnothing was left to him but to resign, and, bereft of the prestige\r\nwhich would have attached to his name had he done so after the 16th of\r\nMay had been condemned by the nation, he retired into private life, and\r\nalso into obscurity, which is far worse.\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence he died just when that Russian alliance to\r\nwhich he had been so opposed was very near to becoming an accomplished\r\nfact. Also, he was followed to his grave by a deputation of Russian\r\nsailors, headed by Admiral Avellan, who came to Paris from Toulon during\r\nthe memorable visit paid to that town by the Russian squadron which had\r\nbeen sent to return the visit paid to Cronstadt by the French fleet a\r\nfew months before. It was one of those freaks of destiny which occur so\r\noften in life, that at his funeral, too, should be represented the\r\nnation against whom he had fought in the Crimean fields and at\r\nSebastopol, and whose soldiers he had never expected would, together\r\nwith those he had commanded, fire the last volleys over his grave. The\r\nold warrior, who, in spite of his mistakes and errors, still represented\r\nsomething of the glory of his country, and was one of the remnants of an\r\nepoch and of a regime that had given to the world the illusion of a\r\nstrong and powerful France, was accompanied to his last resting-place by\r\nthe sincere regrets of all those who had loved the man, while they\r\ndistrusted and condemned the statesman, and perhaps even despised his\r\ncapacity as a politician. But his personal honesty had come out\r\nunimpaired from the trials of his public career, his honour had never\r\nbeen questioned, his courage had never been the subject of the slightest\r\ndoubt. He deserved fully the honours which were paid to him at his\r\ndeath, and the homage that France rendered to him at his funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTWO GREAT MINISTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the Duc de Broglie and the Duc Decazes. They were the\r\nlast two ministers of the old school of which the Third French Republic\r\ncould boast. After them came mostly self-made men, who were perhaps\r\ncleverer than they had been but who did not possess the traditions of\r\nold France, and who brought along with them not only a change of policy\r\nbut a change in political manners and customs. After the two great\r\nministers of whom I am about to speak, the Republic became democratic,\r\nfar removed from the aristocratic country it had been whilst they were\r\nruling it.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie was the son of remarkable parents. His father, the\r\nold Duke Victor, had been a writer, a thinker, a politician and an\r\norator of no mean talent; one, moreover, who, amidst the corruption\r\nwhich had prevailed at the time of the first restoration of the\r\nBourbons, had succeeded in keeping his hands clean from every suspicion.\r\nHe showed the great independence of his noble, straightforward character\r\nwhen almost alone among his colleagues in the House of Peers he refused\r\nto vote for the condemnation of Marshal Ney.\r\n\r\nThe old Duc’s wife was the lovely Duchesse de Broglie, Albertine de\r\nStael, the daughter of the celebrated Madame de Stael, and the\r\ngranddaughter of Necker. Madame de Broglie was one of those figures who\r\nleave their impress on posterity, and whose influence survives them for\r\na long time. She had, allied to considerable beauty, a noble soul, a\r\ngreat intelligence, and strict Protestant principles, which had\r\ncommunicated a tinge of austerity to all that she said, did or wrote.\r\n\r\nHer son Albert inherited much of this Calvinistic severity, which gave\r\nhim sometimes a harsh appearance and harsh manners. He was one of those\r\nmen who never will accept a compromise, or resort to diplomacy of\r\nwhatever kind, to achieve anything they have made up their minds to do.\r\nHe was unusually well read, a man of considerable erudition, who was\r\nmore at his ease at his writing-table than in a drawing-room. He had\r\nnever been frivolous, as one of his friends once said, and had but\r\nseldom shown himself amiable. This absence of human passions made him\r\nsometimes unjust towards those who had felt their influence, or allowed\r\nthemselves to be carried away by them. One could not imagine a time when\r\nthe Duc de Broglie had been young, nor a moment when he had not been\r\nabsorbed by his duties or his studies. He was a living encyclopædia, and\r\nwas continually improving his own mind by devoting his attention to some\r\nserious subject or other. When he was elected a member of the Academy no\r\none was surprised at it, the contrary would have seemed wonderful\r\nbecause he appeared to have been born an Academician, and to be out of\r\nplace anywhere else but among the ranks of that select company known as\r\nthe Institut de France.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie possessed a high moral character. He had strong\r\nprejudices, no indulgence for others, perhaps because he had never had\r\nany for himself; he was narrow-minded in some things, but generous in\r\neverything that did not touch on the question of principles. He came\r\nfrom an Orleanist family, and never wavered in his allegiance to the\r\nyounger branch of the house of France, and when he accepted office,\r\nunder Marshal MacMahon, he certainly did so with the idea that he could\r\nin time bring back Philippe VII. to Paris as King.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his apparent coldness and austerity, he had strong political\r\npassions, the only ones that his soul had ever known. These passions\r\nmade him sometimes lose sight of the obstacles in his way, and the\r\nnatural hauteur of a grand seigneur made him despise adversaries that he\r\nought either to have tried to conciliate or else to have reckoned with\r\nmore carefully than he did. He was not sympathetic, and very few liked\r\nhim, but this latter fact did not trouble him much. The only thing he\r\ncared for was to be respected, esteemed, honoured by his foes as well as\r\nby his friends. No man was ever more respectful of a given word than the\r\nDuc de Broglie, and he would rather have died than have broken a promise\r\nonce made, no matter how rash that promise might have been. He was\r\ncertainly not a politician of the modern school, and both for him and\r\nfor his country it might have been better had he confined himself to the\r\nhistorical studies which have made for him such a great name in modern\r\nFrench literature of the graver sort.\r\n\r\nAn amusing anecdote is related of the Duc de Broglie. He was staying\r\nwith one of his friends in the country, and one day took up a novel\r\nwhich, forgotten, had been left on the table. With the attention that he\r\nalways gave to everything he did, he read it through--it was the\r\n“Histoire de Sybille,” of Octave Feuillet--and then gravely asked his\r\nhost whether one of the heroes of it was still alive? When the latter,\r\nmore than surprised, inquired what he meant, he found out that the Duke\r\nhad thought the book treated of facts that had really occurred, and had\r\nnot imagined that the tale was just a novel. “Why waste one’s time in\r\nwriting about things that have never existed?” he remarked. “Life is too\r\nshort to afford it!” And when Feuillet was elected to the Academy he\r\nwould never consent to give him his vote, saying that through him he had\r\nlost a few hours he might have employed in reading something more useful\r\nthan a mere romance. For he could not forgive the fact that it had\r\ninterested him in spite of his abomination for that kind of literature.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine that a man with such strength of character could not\r\nwell understand the weakness of Marshal MacMahon, and it is not to be\r\nwondered at that the two serious discussions during the few months that\r\nelapsed between the birth and the fall of that Cabinet were always known\r\nin the annals of Parliamentary France as “the Cabinet of the 16th of\r\nMay.” The Duc de Broglie would have liked to carry through the elections\r\nunder the flag of Orleanism, to which he was so very much attached, and\r\nfor whose profit, he had imagined, the Marshal had decided upon his\r\n_coup d’état_ when he dismissed Jules Simon. When he perceived that the\r\nDuc de Magenta had simply given way to an attack of bad temper, the\r\ndisillusion which he experienced was very great, but he did not think it\r\nright to desert the post which he had accepted under a misapprehension,\r\nand he and his colleagues only left office when the result of the\r\nelections made it but too apparent that their day had come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie never returned to political life after that effort.\r\nHe spent the rest of his existence in retirement, absorbed in his\r\nstudies, and seeking among his books an enjoyment that nothing else\r\ncould give him. One did not meet him often in society, but sometimes he\r\nput in an appearance at the house parties given by his son, Prince\r\nAmédée de Broglie, at his splendid castle of Chaumont sur Loire, once\r\nthe residence of Catherine de Medici.\r\n\r\nPrince Amédée had married an heiress, Mademoiselle Say, the daughter of\r\nthe great sugar refiner, who had brought him something like twenty\r\nmillion francs as her dowry. When her marriage took place one was not\r\nused yet in aristocratic France to these unions between the\r\nrepresentatives of great names and daughters of the people, and one\r\nevening at a party given in honour of the young bride the Comte Horace\r\nde Choiseul, well known for his caustic tongue, approached her, and\r\nshowing her a spot on her dress made by an ice that had fallen upon it,\r\nhe said: “Vous avez une tâche de sucre sur votre robe, Princesse” (“You\r\nhave a spot of sugar on your gown, Princess”). Madame de Broglie turned\r\nround, and instantly retorted: “Je préfère une tâche de sucre à une\r\ntâche de sang” (“I prefer a spot of sugar to a spot of blood”), thus\r\nalluding to the murder of the Comte de Choiseul’s mother, the Duchesse\r\nde Praslin, by her husband.\r\n\r\nShe is an amiable woman that Princesse de Broglie, in spite of her sharp\r\ntongue, and certainly she is one of the pleasantest in Paris society at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe Duc Decazes was a great contrast to the Duc de Broglie. Just as\r\nclever, though perhaps not so learned as the latter, he was, moreover, a\r\nmost accomplished man of the world in the fullest sense of that\r\nexpression. He made himself friends wherever he went, even among the\r\nranks of his adversaries. During the seven years that he remained in\r\ncharge of the Foreign Office, in several Cabinets, he succeeded in\r\nwinning for France the respect of Europe, and in presenting the idea\r\nthat though governments might change in that country, its foreign policy\r\nwould not depart from the line it had taken. He was frank, loyal, a\r\ncultured, gentle, and an excellent, though not a brilliant, politician.\r\nPlaced in office at a very difficult moment, just after the disasters of\r\nthe Franco-German War had entirely destroyed the prestige of his\r\nfatherland, he contrived to raise it in the opinion of foreign\r\ngovernments, and to give them a high idea of its moral resources and\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Republic had, of course, been received with every\r\nfeeling of apprehension and distrust, and the old Monarchists, who had\r\nalready considerably hesitated before they admitted the Bonapartes as\r\ntheir equals, could not but look with distrust at the political\r\nadventurers who had replaced them. The Duc Decazes contrived to win for\r\nthe governments of M. Thiers and of Marshal MacMahon the respect of all\r\nthose with whom they had to be in contact; he continued, also, the\r\ntradition of the grand manners which had distinguished the Duc de Morny,\r\nCount Walewski, the Marquis de Moustiers, and all the high-born\r\ngentlemen to whom had been entrusted, for nearly a quarter of a century,\r\nthe task of speaking in the name of France abroad. He renewed old links,\r\nand succeeded in forming new friendships which were to be very useful to\r\nhim as well as to his country in the future.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Duc Decazes will always remain associated with the\r\nso-called German aggression in 1875, when, it is still currently\r\nbelieved in some quarters, the Prussian Government wanted to declare war\r\nagainst France, a war that was only averted by the intervention of the\r\nEmperor Alexander II. of Russia, to whom the French Foreign Minister had\r\nappealed for help. The story has been related a thousand times, but what\r\nhas not been said is that with all his intelligence, his tact and his\r\npolitical experience the Duc Decazes fell a victim to the intrigues of\r\nthe French Ambassador in Berlin, the Vicomte de Gontaut Biron.\r\n\r\nM. de Gontaut was one of those noblemen of the old school who have\r\nforgotten nothing, and learned but very little. He had intelligence,\r\ntact, knowledge of the world, but he was devoted to himself, and\r\nentertained the greatest respect for and opinion of his personal\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\nHe had several relations at the Court of Berlin among the members of the\r\nhighest aristocracy, who, unfortunately for him, were among the enemies\r\nand adversaries of Prince Bismarck. He listened to them, appealed to\r\nthem to carry to the ears of the Emperor William, and especially to\r\nthose of the Empress Augusta, many things he would have done better to\r\nkeep to himself, or else to communicate direct to the German Chancellor;\r\nhe persisted in carrying a personal line of policy, by which he hoped to\r\nput spokes in the wheels of the great minister who held the destinies of\r\nGermany in his hands, and he allowed himself to be influenced by gossip\r\nwhich was purely founded on suppositions and old women’s love of\r\nslander.\r\n\r\nThe result of such conduct became but too soon apparent. Bismarck was\r\nnot a man to allow himself to be treated as a negligible quantity, and\r\nhe very soon began in his turn a campaign against the Vicomte de\r\nGontaut, making him feel by slights on every possible occasion that it\r\nwould be advisable for him to retire from the field of action, at least\r\nin Berlin. M. de Gontaut was fond of his position as an ambassador.\r\nMoreover, his was such an extraordinary vanity that he allowed himself\r\nvery easily to be convinced that by remaining at his post he was\r\nrendering the greatest of services to his country, because no other man\r\nin his place could use the resources he had at his disposal so\r\nsuccessfully in learning the secrets of the Berlin Court and of the\r\nPrussian Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nIt was M. de Gontaut who started the war scare, which existed only in\r\nhis imagination and had sprung from the importance he attributed to\r\nhimself. Bismarck replied in his memoirs to the insinuations that were\r\nmade against him at that time, and he proved that neither he nor Von\r\nMoltke and his staff had ever had the idea of attacking France in 1875.\r\nI do not think that any serious politician now believes that there was\r\nthe slightest foundation for the alarm that the French Ambassador had\r\nraised. But at that time it was generally believed that European peace\r\nhad been in peril for a few days until the Emperor of Russia had put in\r\nhis word and, as it were, forbidden his Imperial uncle to fulfil\r\nintentions the latter had never had for one single moment.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who knew Prince Bismarck it would be needless to point out how\r\nthese manœuvres of the Vicomte de Gontaut exasperated him. He judged\r\nthem for what they were: Gontaut’s desire to make himself important, and\r\nto give himself the appearance of having been the saviour of France. In\r\na conversation which he had many years later with Count Muravieff, at\r\nthat time Councillor of Embassy in Berlin, and later on Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs in Russia, the German Chancellor alluded to the\r\nincidents which had then taken place and expressed his astonishment that\r\na shrewd politician like the Duc Decazes could have been taken in by the\r\nnonsense, _les bêtises_, as he termed them, that M. de Gontaut was\r\ncontinually writing to him. Count Muravieff, who had been in Paris at\r\nthat particular moment, could have replied had he liked, that the Duc\r\nwas not so guilty as it appeared, because he was surrounded by a group\r\nof partisans of the Orleans family, who all pretended to be _au courant_\r\nof what was going on in Berlin, through their cousins who were living\r\nthere, and who did their best to corroborate all that he heard from the\r\nVicomte de Gontaut concerning the plans of Prince Bismarck and his\r\ntreacherous intentions in regard to France.\r\n\r\nAt that period Orleanism was flourishing, and succeeded even in\r\ninfluencing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who found it difficult to\r\ndisbelieve all that was told him on every side, and which he did not\r\nsuspect as coming from the same source. It is certain that he fell into\r\nthe snare, and that when he appealed to Alexander II., it was in the\r\nfirm belief that a new invasion of his country was about to take place.\r\nHe found an ally in the person of old Prince Gortschakov, whose vanity\r\nseized with alacrity the opportunity that was given to him to appear\r\nbefore the world in the capacity of the saviour of France. Newspapers\r\nwere put into motion. _The Times_, through its Paris correspondent, the\r\nfamous Blowitz, started the alarm, and soon it became an established\r\nfact that it was through the intervention of Russia alone that France\r\nhad been snatched from the grip of Germany. The legend still subsists\r\nwith some people; its chief result was that we incurred the enmity of\r\nPrince Bismarck, who might have acted differently in regard to Russia\r\nduring the Berlin Congress had it not been for this unwholesome\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nBefore closing with this subject I must relate the following anecdote.\r\nWhen the German Foreign Office insisted on M. de Gontaut contradicting\r\nin his dispatches to his government the alarming news he had been giving\r\nto it, he repaired to the house of a lady to whom he was related, and\r\nwho occupied an important position at the Berlin Court, to ask her\r\nadvice as to what he was to do. A council of war, if such an expression\r\ncan be employed, was assembled, in which the old Duc de Sagan and his\r\nwife, the clever and amiable Duchesse, took part, and discussed gravely\r\nwhether or not the desires of Prince Bismarck should be fulfilled, and\r\nhis denial telegraphed to Paris. After long discussions it was at last\r\ndecided that M. de Gontaut would write about it later on, but that it\r\nwould be wisest to allow a few days to elapse before communicating the\r\nnews to the French public, and that, consequently, it was not necessary\r\nto telegraph anything for the present. They could not allow the legend\r\nthat the Vicomte de Gontaut had saved France from destruction to die so\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult for the Duc Decazes to have discerned right\r\nfrom wrong in such a mass of intrigue. It is to his honour that,\r\nnotwithstanding the provocations he received, he succeeded in keeping\r\ncalm, cool and dignified, and that he tried seriously to do his best for\r\nhis country’s interest. He was a slow worker, and this, perhaps, was his\r\nbane, because the man whom he had put at the head of his private\r\nchancery, the Marquis de Beauvoir, who was his brother-in-law, having\r\nmarried the sister of the Duchesse Decazes, was careless in the extreme,\r\nand often allowed subordinates to do the work he ought to have kept\r\nentirely under his own control. All these circumstances produced a\r\ncertain amount of confusion, but nevertheless in spite of these\r\nimperfections the administration of the Duc Decazes gave great dignity\r\nto the Foreign Office, and considerably raised the prestige of France\r\nabroad. He was not, perhaps, a genius, but he was a great minister on\r\naccount of his honesty, his loyalty, the gentlemanly qualities that\r\ndistinguished him and that kept him aloof from every dirty intrigue\r\nwhere his reputation might have foundered. When the ministry presided\r\nover by the Duc de Broglie had to retire, the Duc Decazes followed it in\r\nits retreat, though asked both by Marshal MacMahon and by the leaders of\r\nthe Republican party whom the elections had brought to power, to keep\r\nhis functions. He felt he had nothing in common with the men who were\r\nhenceforward to rule his country, and he persisted in his determination\r\nto give up public life. He did not long survive the fall of his party,\r\nand when he died no one ever dared to raise one word against him nor to\r\nquestion his deep patriotism, and his devotion to the country he had\r\nloved so well and served so faithfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPARIS SOCIETY UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF MARSHAL MACMAHON\r\n\r\n\r\nA great change came over Paris society after the fall of the Empire.\r\nSome of its most brilliant elements disappeared altogether, whilst the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain, about which nothing had been heard for such a long\r\ntime, came suddenly to the front, partly through its associations with\r\nthe Maréchale MacMahon, who, being née de Castries, was considered as\r\none of the Faubourg, and partly through the certainty that prevailed in\r\nmany circles as to the imminence of a monarchical restoration, for which\r\neverybody was prepared. It is true that the first two years which\r\nfollowed upon the conclusion of peace with Germany were dull ones, so\r\nfar as public amusements were concerned, but little by little Parisian\r\nsocial life began again, though somewhat on a different plane than\r\nduring the Empire. Whilst the latter had lasted, the families belonging\r\nto the highest aristocracy, which had ruled France in olden times, had\r\nkept aloof from the social movement that had been so very luxurious and\r\nso very gay when the lovely Empress Eugénie had presided over it. They\r\nhad lived for the most in the country in their ancestral castles, where\r\nthey had economised, and cultivated their cabbages and potatoes. The\r\ncustom of marrying heiresses belonging to the bourgeoisie, or to\r\nfinanciers, had not yet become usual, and military service, not being\r\ncompulsory as it is nowadays, had not mixed together young men belonging\r\nto all classes, and thus thrown down the barriers of social\r\ndistinction. The noblesse had transformed itself into a set, into which\r\nno intruders were allowed to enter, and when the Duc de Mouchy married\r\nthe Princess Anna Murat, the cousin of Napoleon III., he scandalised not\r\nonly aristocratic circles in general but his own family, the de\r\nNoailles, who looked very much askance at the lovely bride in spite of\r\nthe large dowry she brought with her.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Empire, the Faubourg St. Germain began to come out\r\nfrom its seclusion, to live a little more in Paris, and a little less in\r\nits country castles. It participated in the gaieties, such as they were,\r\nthat went on, and even appeared at the receptions of the Elysée, timidly\r\nat first, whilst M. and Mme. Thiers presided over them, and then more\r\nboldly after they had been replaced by Marshal MacMahon and his wife.\r\nThen the different members of the Orleans family opened their doors to a\r\nfew select guests, and the salons of the Rothschilds became a neutral\r\nmeeting ground, where in time people belonging to different political\r\nopinions saw each other and commingled, at least as regards social\r\nrelations. Sport, which had hitherto been absolutely unknown among the\r\nbetter classes, became fashionable, and did more than anything else to\r\nbreak down the barriers that had divided the different social sets and\r\ncoteries that had lived in solitary grandeur until then. The Embassies,\r\ntoo, contributed to bring together representatives of the various\r\nsections of fashionable France, because the supremacy of Paris somehow\r\nbegan to be less absolute than it had been under Napoleon III. The fact,\r\nalso, that the government of the Republic had appealed to the patriotism\r\nof some members of the old nobility of the country to help it in its\r\ntask of restoring the prestige of France abroad--as, for instance, in\r\nsending the Duc de Bisaccia to London as Ambassador, and the Vicomte de\r\nGontaut Biron to Berlin in the same capacity--had done much to bring it\r\npartisans, and to procure it more sympathy than the Empire had won for\r\nitself at its start. People were feeling that the present state of\r\nthings was but transitory, and that the existence of that Republic,\r\nwhich no one had expected or foreseen a few days, even, before it became\r\nan accomplished fact, was bound to come to an end very quickly,\r\nespecially under the Marshal, who, it was firmly believed, would use all\r\nhis influence to bring about a return of the Bourbon dynasty to the\r\nthrone of France.\r\n\r\nThe Legitimists were also in possession of large financial means, which\r\nthey had contrived to accumulate during all the years of their voluntary\r\nseclusion. This gave them a distinct advantage over the Imperialists,\r\nwhose exchequer, which had largely depended on the liberality of the\r\nEmperor, found itself in a very low state indeed after it had lost that\r\nresource. Ladies who had presided over salons that gave the tone to\r\nParis society, and whose doors had been thrown widely open to all who\r\nhad cared to enter--such social leaders as the Countess Valevoska, the\r\nPrincess Pauline Metternich, or the Marquise de Chasseloup Laubat, and\r\nthe Countess Tascher de la Pagerie--had either left Paris, or retired\r\nfrom the world, or lost the means to entertain with their former\r\nsplendour. Of the hostesses of olden days there remained but very few,\r\nsuch as the Comtesse Edmond de Pourtalès, the Baronesses Alphonse and\r\nGustave de Rothschild, and the Princess de Sagan, and it was at their\r\nhouses that the first entertainments after the horrors of the war and\r\nthe Commune took place. It was under their patronage that Paris found\r\nout it still could enjoy itself, though the wild chase after gaiety,\r\nwhich had preceded them, no longer existed. And then a few salons,\r\nhermetically closed before, suddenly started a series of entertainments,\r\nat which the Comte and the Comtesse de Paris made frequent appearances,\r\nespecially after their eldest daughter, the Princesse Amélie d’Orléans,\r\nwho was later on to become Queen of Portugal, had begun to go out into\r\nthe world. Among them may be mentioned those of the Duchesse de Galliera\r\nand of the Duchesse de la Rochefoucauld Bisaccia, after the latter’s\r\nreturn from London, and the retirement of the Duc from public life.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Bisaccia, born Princesse Marie de Ligne, was a most\r\nimportant person in Paris society, over which she exercised a real\r\ninfluence owing to her husband’s enormous fortune, her beautiful house\r\nin the Rue de Varennes, and the luxury, the pomp and the grandeur that\r\nwere displayed at her numerous receptions. A factor which also\r\ncontributed to her popularity was the fact of the alliances that united\r\nthe La Rochefoucaulds to all the oldest nobility of France, and the most\r\npowerful members of the coterie “du Faubourg St. Germain.” The eldest\r\ndaughter of the Duc by his first wife, Mademoiselle de Polignac, was the\r\nDuchesse de Luynes, the widow of the Duc de Luynes, who had fallen\r\nbravely during the battle of Patay in 1870, whilst his second and third\r\ndaughters were in time to become the Princesse de Ligne and the Duchesse\r\nd’Harcourt; his eldest son was to marry the only daughter of the Duc de\r\nla Trémouille, one of the richest heiresses in France.\r\n\r\nPersonally, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld Bisaccia was a pompous\r\nindividual, with the manners of a courtly gentleman, as, indeed, he was,\r\nand with just enough wit about him to allow him to hold his own among\r\nthe people with whom he lived. He had an excellent opinion of his\r\npersonal capacities, felt himself born to great things, and destined to\r\ngreater still. He had a despotic temperament, and his way of greeting\r\nthose who called upon him, or whom he met at other people’s houses, was\r\ndecidedly haughty. He believed himself to be as much above humanity as\r\nhis worldly position and his fortune were above those of the generality\r\nof mankind. In a word, he carried his ducal coronet everywhere, and even\r\nwhen sleeping remembered that he had to take care of it, or rather that\r\nit had to take care of him. He did not admit that anybody could forget\r\nwhat was due to him, and when, long past middle age he took for his\r\nsecond wife the pretty and lively Marie de Ligne, he could not for one\r\nsingle instant think that he failed to represent for her an ideal\r\nhusband in every way, or that her fancy might have led her to choose a\r\nyounger and handsomer and merrier companion of her life.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse, however, succeeded very soon in finding diversion in other\r\ndirections than in the constant companionship of her pompous and solemn\r\nhusband. She was one of those beings who always succeed in taking for\r\nthemselves the good things of life. Secure in her position, and having\r\nvery soon come to the conclusion that the Duc’s vanity would never allow\r\nhim to think that his wife might look beyond him for the happiness to\r\nwhich every woman is entitled, she managed to arrange her existence in\r\nsuch a way that many roses helped her to bear its thorns. There was a\r\ntime when almost every man of note in Paris society found himself one of\r\nthe admirers of the Duchesse de Bisaccia, and also one of her friends.\r\nShe was always pleasant, always kind, always good-tempered, always ready\r\nto make others happy. Pretty in her youth, she very quickly became\r\nstout, but this did not prevent her from going about or attending any of\r\nthe entertainments at which it was deemed fashionable to be seen. She\r\nwas fond of dress, but yet always appeared untidy, perhaps on account of\r\nher corpulence. She generally put on her tiara in such a way that five\r\nminutes after it had been fastened on to her head it got crooked and\r\nhung on one side, but though this gave her whole person an original\r\nappearance it did not make her ridiculous, as it would have made another\r\nwoman. The Duchesse could not be ridiculous, no matter what she wore,\r\nnor what she did. She was essentially a great lady, even when not\r\nladylike, which often occurred, because her manners were distinctly\r\nunceremonious, and had a dash of Bohemianism about them such as is not\r\noften met with in the circles in which she generally moved. I use the\r\nword “generally” on purpose, as there were times when the Duchesse did\r\nnot object to visiting, with one or other of her numerous friends,\r\nplaces and people more or less unconventional. But, somehow, whatever\r\nshe did or said no one seemed to mind, and she remained until the last\r\nthe favourite of a society over which she reigned for nearly forty\r\nyears, and by which she is missed to this very day.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bisaccia was exceedingly fond of entertaining, and gave\r\nsumptuous receptions in her Hotel de la Rue de Varennes, which were\r\nconsidered landmarks in the horizon of fashionable Paris. These\r\nreceptions were very stately; it would have been impossible for them to\r\nbe otherwise in the presence of the Duc. During the septenary of Marshal\r\nMacMahon they were frequent, especially and always honoured by the\r\npresence of a royalty or two. The Duchesse had a grand way of receiving\r\nher guests, and when she stood on the top of her beautiful old staircase\r\nshe appeared every inch of her to be one of those great ladies of the\r\neighteenth century such as we see in the pictures of Latour or\r\nLargillière--a queen without a crown, but with courtiers, and surrounded\r\nby regal state.\r\n\r\nIt was rumoured that at these feasts, which took place in the Hotel de\r\nBisaccia, many dark plots against the Republic were hatched. The Comte\r\nde Paris used to receive some of his adherents in a remote room there\r\nwhilst his daughter was dancing in the ball-room, and the Comtesse gave\r\naudiences to ladies who craved to be presented to her, with the dignity\r\nshe had learnt in the royal palace of Madrid, where she had been born.\r\nIt was under the auspices of the Duc that the leaders of the Legitimist\r\nparty persuaded the head of the House of Orleans that, in order to\r\nrecover the throne which his grandfather had lost, a reconciliation had\r\nto be effected between him and the Comte de Chambord; it was also there\r\nthat a plot was conceived to persuade Marshal MacMahon to lend himself\r\nto a restoration, which was not only desired but which had been in a\r\ncertain sense already discounted among the majority of the people who\r\nwere guests at the receptions of the Hotel de Bisaccia.\r\n\r\nAll this is now a thing of the past. Good-natured Duchesse Marie died a\r\ngood many years since, and the pompous little Duc has followed her to\r\nthe grave; their eldest son has also disappeared from this worldly\r\nscene, whilst his widow, Charlotte de la Trémouille, lives in\r\nretirement, and moves in quite a different set from the one which had\r\nfrequented the salons of Madame de Bisaccia. The Hotel de la Rue de\r\nVarennes belongs to the second son of the Duchesse, who has inherited\r\nfrom an uncle the title of Duc de Doudeauville, and who has married the\r\ngranddaughter of M. Blanc, of Monaco fame--a woman with more pride than\r\ncharm, who knows the value of the millions which she brought as her\r\ndowry to her husband, and who will never play in Parisian society the\r\npart which her mother-in-law filled so well.\r\n\r\nI have already said that the eldest daughter of the Duc de Bisaccia had\r\nbeen married to the Duc de Luynes. She became a widow at the age of\r\ntwenty, and never married again, preferring to keep her great name and\r\ntitle, and understanding that this would not prevent her from living her\r\nown life in the way she liked best. She was a charming creature, this\r\nDuchesse de Luynes, gifted with great talents, and possessed of an\r\nengaging manner that was quite peculiar to her. People who knew her well\r\nused to say that she had an abominable temper, but of this last fact the\r\ngeneral public was not made aware, and it is quite certain that she was\r\ngreatly liked by nearly all those who knew her. She lived most of the\r\nyear at her castle of Dampierre, which had been left to her for life by\r\nthe Duc, and received in great state in that historical domain, made\r\nillustrious by the remembrance of all the famous people to whom it had\r\npreviously belonged, or who had been visitors under its hospitable roof.\r\nIll-natured gossips pretended that during her children’s minority she\r\nhad managed to squander a good part of the fortune which they had\r\ninherited from their father, and which had been left under her personal\r\ncontrol, and it is certain that her son, the present Duc, in spite of\r\nthe large dowry which his wife, the daughter of the Duchesse d’Uzès, of\r\nBoulanger fame, had brought to him, had to exercise a rigorous economy\r\nin order to restore something of its past glories to the house of\r\nLuynes. But during the lifetime of the Duchesse Yolande no one dared to\r\nmake any allusion to the carelessness with which she had attended to her\r\nchildren’s interests, and she exercised a despotic sway over them, and\r\nnever allowed them to question anything she decided to do. Dark things\r\nwere hinted about her, but we may be allowed to consider them as\r\ncalumnies, and to remember her as one of the pleasantest women among the\r\nmany who reigned over Paris society at the period of which I am writing.\r\n\r\nThe La Rochefoucauld was a very numerous family, divided into ever so\r\nmany branches, and owing to the similarity of names a good deal of\r\ntrouble ensued, until the identity of all of them was discovered,\r\nespecially to persons not very well up in the mysteries of the Almanach\r\nde Gotha.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de la Rochefoucauld was an amusing personage, and anything\r\nmore funny than his admiration of the family to which he belonged could\r\nscarcely be met. His whole universe consisted in the grandeur of the\r\norigin of the La Rochefoucaulds, and the sole reason of his existence,\r\nas well as the only object of his thoughts, was how to persuade others\r\nto view it in the same light that he did. According to him, God came\r\nfirst and the La Rochefoucaulds next, and I am not quite sure whether he\r\ndid not consider in his inmost thoughts that even in Heaven they ought\r\nto be awarded precedence at the banquet of Eternity over the saints of\r\nhumble origin.\r\n\r\nIt is related that one day when he was in England someone mentioned the\r\nold saying, in relation to one of the most noble of the many noble\r\nhouses Great Britain can boast, which speaks of “all the blood of all\r\nthe Howards,” Count Aimery smiled modestly. “Yes,” he replied, “the\r\nHowards are great people, but I have known greater ones” (“Je connais\r\nmieux qu’eux”).\r\n\r\nOne can imagine how this weakness of that amiable man, for he was\r\namiable indeed, was laughed at, but nevertheless he contrived to create\r\nfor himself a unique position in Paris society, and talked so much and\r\nso constantly over his right to occupy the seat of honour at every\r\ndining-table he was asked to honour with his presence, that he succeeded\r\nin getting it,--and no one would have dreamed of denying it to him. Even\r\nwhen he happened to be in the same room as a Duke whose supremacy he\r\ndeigned to recognise and to admit, one was very careful to award him the\r\nnext best seat.\r\n\r\nComte Aimery was married to a charming woman, Mademoiselle de Mailly\r\nNesle, whose house in the Rue de l’Université was for many years\r\nconsidered one of the most hospitable among the many hospitable ones in\r\nParis. She was most exclusive as to the people whom she invited to it,\r\nbut when once she had allowed them to cross her threshold, she never\r\ndropped them later on, or showed any difference in the way in which she\r\nwelcomed them, even when she did not find them quite congenial or\r\nentirely sympathetic. She was rather stiff and certainly dull, and the\r\nparties which she used to give regularly during the spring season were\r\nanything but lively, partly because the guests felt that they ought not\r\nto think about anything else but the greatness of the La Rochefoucaulds,\r\nand the honour which was conferred upon them by their admittance under\r\nthe roof of a member of that illustrious family; partly because anything\r\nthat would have borne even the most remote likeness to amusement or\r\nmirth would have seemed out of place in those large rooms furnished in\r\nthe seventeenth century style, where on all the walls hung solemn\r\npictures of dead and gone ancestors of the hosts. But to be invited to\r\nattend a social function, no matter of what kind, by Madame Aimery gave\r\none at once a position in Paris society, putting one immediately on the\r\nlevel of the upper ten thousand who constituted its most exclusive set,\r\nand by reason of that circumstance any new arrival or foreigner aspiring\r\nto make a position for himself, thought it his or her duty never to miss\r\nany of the receptions given at the hotel in the Rue de l’Université.\r\n\r\nMadame Aimery de La Rochefoucauld died a year or two ago, and the\r\nhospitable gates of her house have remained closed ever since. Her only\r\nson, Comte Gabriel, is married to Mademoiselle de Richelieu, the sister\r\nof the present Duke of that name and the daughter of the widowed\r\nDuchess, who later married the Prince of Monaco. The Princesse de Monaco\r\nis a Jewess by origin, the daughter of the banker Heine, and it was a\r\nhard pill to swallow for Count Aimery when he had to consent to this\r\nunion of his only son with a girl who, though charming in herself, still\r\ncould not boast of the thirty-two quarterings which he considered as\r\nindispensable in such cases. He submitted, however, with better grace\r\nthan he would have done had a few millions not helped him to do so,\r\ntogether with the consciousness that these millions would allow his heir\r\nto keep up the state which befitted his station in life. Now Count\r\nAimery is an old man, far advanced in the sixties, if not in the\r\nseventies, and is but little seen in society, especially since the death\r\nof his wife. His greatest delight consists in being consulted in matters\r\nof etiquette, or being asked to arrange seats at a dinner table. His\r\nconstant occupation is the study of the Almanach de Gotha and books of\r\nthat kind. He is as happy as a man devoid of cares can be, and probably\r\nwill live a good many years yet, being so forgetful of anything that\r\ndoes not concern the glories of the La Rochefoucauld family that he will\r\nsurely even forget to die. Should he ever remember to do so, the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain will lose its greatest authority in matters of\r\nsocial etiquette and social precedence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA FEW PROMINENT PARISIAN HOSTESSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the great ladies who began to receive society in their ancestral\r\nhouses during the presidency of Marshal MacMahon can be mentioned the\r\nDuchesse de Rohan, at that time still Princesse de Léon; the Duchesse de\r\nGalliera, of whom I have already spoken; and a crowd of hostesses of\r\nminor standing within the social horizon, who hastened with more or less\r\nalacrity to follow their example. The Comtesse Mélanie de Pourtalès\r\nopened once more the doors of her hotel in the Rue Tronchet, as did the\r\nBaroness Alphonse de Rothschild her magnificent palace in the Rue St.\r\nFlorentin, whilst Madame Edouard André very soon contrived, thanks to\r\nher husband’s enormous fortune and her own great talent as a painter, to\r\nintroduce herself into the most select circles of Paris society, and to\r\nhave all its celebrities at her receptions given in her splendid\r\ndwelling on the Boulevard Haussmann.\r\n\r\nLittle by little social life began to re-establish itself, though on an\r\nentirely different scale than formerly, and, strange to say, society\r\nbecame ever so much less exclusive than when a distinct line of\r\nseparation existed between the Monde des Tuileries, as it was called,\r\nand the other coteries which abounded in the capital.\r\n\r\nMadame de Galliera was one of the last representatives of the _grandes\r\ndames_ of the time of Louis Philippe, when even great ladies got imbued\r\nwith a certain tinge of middle-class leanings, which were the\r\ndistinctive feature of that middle-class Court over which Queen Marie\r\nAmélie presided, where it was not considered as against etiquette to\r\nappear before the Sovereigns with an umbrella, and where the King did\r\nnot hesitate to peel a fruit with a penknife. Madame de Galliera was\r\npolite and amiable, very correct in everything she did, and very much\r\nconvinced of the exceptional importance which her numerous millions gave\r\nher in the world where she moved with more ease than pleasure. She\r\nbelonged to a coterie composed of widely differing elements, and where\r\nrigid dames could be found together with some who posed as such, though\r\nwith the heavy burden of a well-filled past upon their shoulders. Such,\r\nfor instance, as the Duchesse de Dino, who in her young days had been a\r\nfriend of Madame de Galliera, though considerably older than the latter.\r\n\r\nAt the time I am talking about, that descendant of the Genoese Doges and\r\ndaughter of the ancient house of Brignole-Sale was affecting the most\r\nconsiderable devotion to the Orleans family, and had put her sumptuous\r\nhouse at the disposal of the Comte de Paris, who inhabited it until the\r\ndecree of expulsion was enforced against him. He held there the\r\nreception on the occasion of the wedding of his daughter, the Princess\r\nAmélie, with the heir to the throne of Portugal. This reception, brought\r\nhim bad luck in general, because it was the cause of a quarrel between\r\nhim and his capricious hostess, who, instead of leaving him her vast\r\nfortune as she had intended, willed a considerable portion of it to the\r\nEmpress Frederick of Germany, with whom she had struck up a violent\r\nfriendship at the time the Emperor was struggling with the horrors of\r\nhis last illness at San Remo. She left her house in Paris to the\r\nAustrian Emperor, whose Embassy has been located in it ever since.\r\n\r\nMadame de Galliera was a very considerable personality in Paris\r\nsociety, but no one liked her, and not a few stood in fear of her\r\nbecause she could be terribly rude when she liked, and had a peculiar\r\nway of entirely crushing those she did not care for, or against whom she\r\nthought she had a grudge. Her relations with her only son were peculiar,\r\nand for reasons it is not for me to discuss he refused to accept the\r\nslightest portion of her enormous wealth, or to be known by any of the\r\nnumerous titles that belonged to her, calling himself plain M. Ferrari,\r\nand preferring to earn his own living rather than enjoy millions to\r\nwhich he felt he had no moral right. His strong principles rebelled\r\nagainst compromises, about which no one else would have been troubled.\r\n\r\nThe present Duchesse de Rohan, at that time still Princesse de Léon, was\r\na very different person from Madame de Galliera. Mademoiselle de\r\nVerteillac by birth, she brought an immense dowry to the Prince de Léon\r\nwhen she married him; it restored to the house of Rohan some of its past\r\nsplendours. With her money she rebuilt the old castle of Josselin, and\r\nmade it one of the landmarks of Brittany. The receptions she held in her\r\nhouse on the Boulevard des Invalides were exceedingly sumptuous and\r\nnumerous; some of the fancy balls that took place there, indeed, are\r\nstill talked of. She was hospitable, kind, clever in her way, but rather\r\ninclined to vulgarity, perhaps on account of her stoutness, and partly\r\nbecause her whole manner was too good-natured to be distinguished.\r\nLooking at her, one might have thought her to be anything but a Duchesse\r\nde Rohan, but she was and is still very much liked, because she has\r\nalways shown herself generous, indulgent for others, and absolutely\r\ndevoid of snobbishness. Madame de Rohan has pretensions to be considered\r\na literary person, and has written a few books, which her title and\r\nposition in society have helped to make popular. She is now an old\r\nwoman, who has known the sorrows of life, having lost a charming\r\ndaughter, the Comtesse de Périgord, who was snatched away from her in\r\nthe flower of her youth and beauty; but the Duchesse has kept her\r\npleasant smile and kind welcome, and is decidedly a popular personage in\r\nParisian society.\r\n\r\nThe years that have sat rather heavily on the Duchesse de Léon have\r\nspared the lovely Countess Mélanie de Pourtalès, who, although a\r\ngreat-grandmother at present, is just as lovely an old woman as she was\r\na splendid young one. The smile, the eyes, the expression, have retained\r\ntheir former charm and the soft melodious voice its youthful ring. One\r\ncannot call Madame de Pourtalès a great lady, in the sense which the\r\nFrench attach to this expression of _grande dame_, which has no equal in\r\nany other language; but she was essentially the _femme charmante_ of the\r\ntime in which she was born, pleasant, simple, with no shred of\r\naffectation about her a thoughtful hostess, and a faithful friend to\r\nthose to whom she had attached herself; moreover, of no mean\r\nintelligence, of perfect tact, and with a wonderful knowledge of the\r\nworld. She saw at her feet all the men of her own generation, and went\r\non gathering the admiration of those who belonged to a later one. Her\r\nreceptions were select, in the sense that at them one only met social\r\nstars; they were not exclusive--bankers and financial magnates elbowed\r\nyoung beauties in their prime, or authors, whether of repute or simply\r\nfashionable for the moment. When she passes away she will not be\r\nforgotten, and her name will always remain associated with the fate of\r\nthe Second Empire and with the Third Republic.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Madame Edouard André; before her marriage she had been\r\nknown as Mademoiselle Nelly Jacquemard, a painter of wonderful talent,\r\nwhose portraits of M. Thiers and M. Dufaure will rank among the most\r\nremarkable works of art of the end of the nineteenth century in France.\r\nShe had fascinated M. André, the son of a banker, blessed with a\r\nconsiderable number of millions, who had been one of the most\r\nfashionable men of the Société des Tuileries towards the end of the\r\nreign of Napoleon III. M. André, already old and nearly paralysed, had\r\nfallen in love with the artist at the time she was painting his picture,\r\nand finding that their tastes in many things harmonised he had married\r\nher. Mlle. Jacquemard proved herself grateful, and made an excellent\r\nwife to the tired, weary man, who found in her what he had wished--a\r\ncompanion and a nurse. When he died he left her all his riches, together\r\nwith his wonderful house and the numerous works of art that it\r\ncontained, and to which she considerably added.\r\n\r\nMadame André was an amusing little woman, absolutely vulgar in\r\nappearance and manners, but who moved in the best society, and whose\r\nentertainments, absolutely devoid of stiffness, were as amusing as large\r\nreceptions can be. She was made very much of by the Orleans family, who\r\nflattered her in the secret hope that she would be induced to make a\r\nwill in their favour, but that hope was to prove a barren one, because\r\nMadame André left all that she possessed to the Institut de France, with\r\ninjunctions to transform her palace into a museum. She is supposed to\r\nhave said, not without a certain malice, that in doing so she was\r\nfollowing the example given to her by the Duc d’Aumale, and that\r\nconsequently she believed the way she had disposed of her property would\r\nmeet the approval of the latter’s numerous nephews and nieces.\r\n\r\nBy an extraordinary freak of her rather peculiar character Madame André,\r\nafter her marriage, entirely neglected the art to which she had owed her\r\nformer celebrity. She absolutely refused to take again a brush or a\r\npencil in her hand, and was even angry when anyone made an allusion to\r\nher wonderful talent in that line. It seemed as if she was ashamed of\r\nNelly Jacquemard, and yet it was to Nelly Jacquemard she had owed the\r\nconquest that she had made of M. Edouard André and his many millions.\r\n\r\nThe Rothschild family, who perhaps had been more powerful during the\r\nreign of Louis Philippe than later on, at least as regards the political\r\ninfluence and power which they wielded, had acquired a far greater\r\nsocial position during the Second Empire, and one which became even\r\nstronger after its fall, when for one brief moment they transferred\r\ntheir allegiance to the Comte de Paris and to the whole Orleans family.\r\nThe Baron Alphonse was a very great personage indeed, and one of whom\r\neven kings and countries stood in awe. He had married one of his\r\ncousins, the daughter of the London Rothschild, and the grace, beauty,\r\nand intelligence of his wife won them many friends among Parisian\r\nsociety. The couple entertained on a large scale, and their balls,\r\ndinners, and shooting parties at their lovely castle of Férrières were\r\ncelebrated for the luxury displayed at them and for the discriminating\r\nchoice of the guests invited. It was at Férrières that the Princess\r\nAmélie, the daughter of the Comte de Paris, made her début in society,\r\nand later on, especially during the Exhibition of 1878, the Rothschilds\r\nopened their doors widely to the best French and foreign society. The\r\ndeath of their eldest daughter, Bettina, married to her cousin, Baron\r\nAlbert Rothschild of Vienna, put an end to those brilliant festivities.\r\nThe Baroness Alphonse hardly ever went out after that, and contented\r\nherself with seeing a few intimate friends at her own house. The only\r\nother great function at the hotel in the Rue St. Florentin was the\r\nreception given in honour of the marriage of Edouard, the only son of\r\nBaron and Baroness Alphonse de Rothschild, with the lovely Mademoiselle\r\nHalphen, an event which was very shortly followed by the death of the\r\nold Baron.\r\n\r\nHis widow only survived him for a short time. She had grown very\r\neccentric towards the last, and suffered from the mania of thinking\r\nherself poor and obliged to economise. Madame Edmond de Pourtalès was\r\nabout the only person whom she cared to see, and the latter remained\r\nwith her constantly, never leaving her bedside during her last short\r\nillness. The hotel in the Rue St. Florentin still remains closed, as its\r\npresent owners do not seem to care much for society, and it is very much\r\nto be doubted whether it will ever witness the sumptuous entertainments\r\nthat had won for it such fame in past times.\r\n\r\nAnother house which has passed into other hands, being now occupied by\r\nM. Seligmann, a merchant of curiosities, is the Hotel de Sagan, Rue St.\r\nDominique, where the Princesse de Sagan, the daughter of the banker\r\nSeillères, used so frequently to entertain from the days when her\r\nmarriage brought her into the most exclusive set of Paris society.\r\nMadame de Sagan was a tall, slight, fair woman, with pleasant manners,\r\nwho was very much liked by a good many men, but had never been able to\r\nget on with her own husband. He was the eldest son of the Duc de\r\nValencay and the grandson of the famous Duchesse de Dino. He spent right\r\nand left, and as his father either could not, or would not, give him\r\nmore, he had been obliged to seek among the daughters of financial\r\nhouses a companion of his life. He did not care in the least for his\r\nwife, though he tried to launch her into society, and to help her in\r\nacquiring a great position. The Princess made the best of his advice,\r\nbut very soon discovered that if she wanted to keep her prestige in the\r\neyes of the world, she had better remove her fortune from the control of\r\nher husband. The couple separated after stormy quarrels, that formed\r\nthe main topic of public conversation for a long time, and the Princess\r\nfound many people willing to console her in her solitude. From time to\r\ntime an ugly scandal arose in connection with either her doings or those\r\nof the Prince, who very often found need to have recourse to his wife’s\r\npurse. He obliged her to pay dearly for his silence concerning things\r\nthat, if revealed, might have impaired that worldly position for which\r\nshe cared above everything else.\r\n\r\nIt is related that once when the heir to one of the thrones of Europe\r\nhad signified his intention to be present at an entertainment given by\r\nMadame de Sagan, some relatives had explained to her that it would be\r\nmore suitable, especially in view of the fact that the Prince’s wife\r\nwould also be present, to have a master of the house to play the host,\r\nand to receive them together with her. She then began negotiations with\r\nthe Prince de Sagan, who first of all stipulated he should be given a\r\nhandsome cheque of not less than four figures, to ensure his presence in\r\nhis wife’s house, and who consented, after having received it, to make\r\nan appearance in his former home, to give a look at all the arrangements\r\nmade in honour of the occasion, and after having received the royal\r\ncouple at the bottom of the staircase of the hotel in the Rue St.\r\nDominique, to play the host with the perfection that he always performed\r\nhis social duties. When the last guest had left, he kissed his wife’s\r\nhand with courtly grace, and took leave of her in his turn with a\r\nplayful remark of some kind or other, and for a long time the couple did\r\nnot meet again.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Sagan was considered the leader of everything that was\r\nfashionable in Paris. It was he who organised the racecourse of Auteuil,\r\nand who helped greatly to popularise Americans among Parisian society,\r\nwhere, for a handsome consideration, so at least it was rumoured, he\r\nintroduced them into his particular set, where every word he uttered was\r\nlaw, which, like those of the Medes and Persians, altered not. One used\r\nto see him often at the Opera in the box belonging to the Jockey Club,\r\nwith his inevitable eyeglass hanging on a broad black ribbon, a fashion\r\nhe was the first to introduce. He occupied two small rooms at the club\r\nof the Union, not being possessed of enough means and having too many\r\ncreditors to be able to indulge in the luxury of a private apartment,\r\nand it was there that he was stricken with paralysis, from which he\r\nnever recovered, and which deprived him both of his speech and of his\r\nmental faculties. It was at this juncture that Madame de Sagan behaved\r\nwith great generosity and a singular power of forgiveness for past\r\ninjuries. As soon as she heard of the lamentable condition to which her\r\nhusband had been reduced, she drove to the club, and had him removed to\r\nher own house, where she nursed him with the utmost devotion; thereafter\r\nthe large receptions and garden parties which she regularly gave in\r\nspring and which constituted a feature of the Paris season, became a\r\nthing of the past, and the hospitable gates of the hotel in the Rue St.\r\nDominique were closed for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Sagan, who in the meanwhile, through the death of her\r\nfather-in-law, had become the Duchesse de Talleyrand, was not rewarded\r\nfor her self-sacrifice. She died quite suddenly, before the Duc, who was\r\nleft alone and infirm to the mercies of his two sons and of hired\r\nservants. The old man dragged out an existence for something like ten\r\nyears or so, and at last died in poverty and solitude, expiating his\r\nformerly brilliant life more cruelly and more bitterly than he perhaps\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nOne of his sons, the present Duc de Talleyrand, to whom I shall refer\r\nagain, is married to the American heiress, Miss Anna Gould, whose\r\ndivorce from the Comte de Castellane made such a sensation a few years\r\nago, but the hotel in the Rue St. Dominique has been sold, and already\r\nhalf the magnificent garden in which it stood has been built upon with\r\nhuge houses, whilst the inside of the palace is turned into an\r\nantiquary’s shop; bric-à-brac of all kinds encumbers the lofty rooms\r\nwhere kings and queens moved with stately grace; it dishonours the\r\nfamous staircase at the top of which the Princesse de Sagan, dressed in\r\nthe costume of a Persian Empress covered with priceless jewels and with\r\na little negro boy holding a sunshade over her head, received her guests\r\nat one of the most famous of her many famous fancy balls.\r\n\r\nThere was one salon in Paris which was not by any means so brilliant as\r\nthat of the Comtesse de Pourtalès, the Princesse de Sagan, and the\r\nDuchesse de Bisaccia, but which enjoyed a popularity that has never been\r\nequalled. I am thinking of that of the Duchesse de Maillé, that stately\r\nold lady with the many charming daughters who, without any affectation\r\nof pomp and without the least shade of stiffness, welcomed almost every\r\nevening her many friends with her bright smile and kind words. Madame de\r\nMaillé was one of those women that are but seldom met with, who combine\r\nthe dignity of the _grande dame_ with the indulgence and the abandon, if\r\none can use such a word, of the perfect woman of the world. She was\r\nclever, and she appreciated cleverness in others; she could talk well,\r\nand listen even better still; she knew how to bring into evidence all\r\nthe perfections and qualities of her friends, and she always found\r\nreasons to excuse their faults or their imperfections. She was discreet,\r\nand never made use of the many confidences that were constantly poured\r\ninto her ear; she had always ready some good advice to give to those who\r\nrequired it, and she liked to see people happy around her, to watch\r\nyoung people amuse themselves, and though excessively strict in\r\neverything that was connected with appearances, so very polite that\r\nsomehow in her presence no one dreamed of breaking the code established\r\nby society in that respect. Madame de Maillé loved politics, and enjoyed\r\nexceedingly the conversation of literary people. Almost all the\r\ncelebrities that Paris could boast of were the habitués of her salon.\r\nShe used to receive them seated by her fireside, in her plain black\r\ngown, with a lace cap over her silvery hair and her everlasting knitting\r\nin her hands. She at once put them at their ease, and found out the most\r\nappropriate things to tell them. Her house was restful in our age of\r\nrestlessness, and though there was not the least shade of hauteur about\r\nthe old Duchesse, the last representative of the ancient family of the\r\nMarquis d’Osmond, yet one felt at once, on seeing her, that one stood in\r\nthe presence of a really great lady.\r\n\r\nNow this hospitable salon is also a thing of the past. The Duchesse de\r\nMaillé has been dead these last ten years or so, and all her children\r\nhave settled in houses of their own. Her daughters, Madame de Nadaillac,\r\nthe Marquise de Ganay, and Madame de Fleury, though all distinguished\r\nand amiable women, perhaps because they are still too young, have not\r\nacquired that inimitable charm, ease in their manners, and dignity in\r\ntheir bearing which belonged exclusively to their charming mother.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Maillé was an exception among the old ladies of\r\naristocratic Paris. There was no stiffness, such as, for instance,\r\ndistinguished the old Princesse de Ligne and the Duchesse de Mirepoix,\r\nand some others whose names I have already forgotten. I do not think\r\nthat anything more solemn than the receptions of the Princess de Ligne\r\nhave ever been invented. She was a Pole by birth, belonging to the old\r\nfamily of Lubomirski, a representative of which, Prince Joseph\r\nLubomirski, was at one time a well-known boulevardier. Anything more\r\nformidable in the shape of a dowager could hardly be found in the whole\r\nworld. One could not dream even of sitting in a chair in her august\r\npresence, and generally dropped down meekly on one of the numerous\r\nstools which adorned her drawing-room and which reminded one of a church\r\nwithout an altar. She was ill-natured, too, cruel when she liked--and\r\nshe liked it often; severe in her judgments, and inexorable in her\r\ndecisions. Her numerous grandchildren were all afraid of her, and when\r\nshe decided that the head of the house of Ligne was to marry her own\r\ngranddaughter, Mlle. de La Rochefoucauld Bisaccia, neither one nor the\r\nother, to their own future sorrow, dared to say a word in opposition,\r\nfor never was there a union more ill-assorted. When it ended in a\r\ndivorce no one felt surprised. At the time this last-mentioned fact took\r\nplace the Princess Hedwige de Ligne had long been dead.\r\n\r\nThere were other houses in Paris which, perhaps, were less select, but\r\ncertainly more amusing and agreeable than those in the high circles I\r\nhave just mentioned. There existed salons which were truly Bohemian, but\r\nwhich also exercised a considerable influence on the sayings and doings\r\nof society. I have mentioned already old Madame Lacroix, whose house saw\r\npurely literary receptions, and at whose hospitable hearth all the\r\ndistinguished foreigners who arrived in Paris used to meet. Then there\r\nwas the salon of Madame Aubernon de Nerville, where Academicians were\r\nusually to be met, that of Madame de Luynes, and last, but not least,\r\nthe salon of Madame Juliette Adam, who wielded a really regal power\r\namong a certain set, and who certainly succeeded in being considered as\r\na political power, especially after Gambetta began to seek her advice in\r\nmatters pertaining to the affairs of the government. But this last\r\nhouse, as well as its amiable and clever mistress, deserve more than a\r\npassing mention; they require a chapter to themselves in order to be\r\nduly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nMADAME JULIETTE ADAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be hardly possible ever to write a history of the Third Republic\r\nwithout mentioning Madame Juliette Adam, the beautiful, clever and\r\nattractive woman whose influence at the end of the nineteenth century,\r\nnot only on some of the most important personalities in France but also\r\non many foreign notabilities, was so considerable. Her efforts and\r\ninfluence had much to do with the development of the events which\r\nultimately led to the consolidation of the French Republic, and which,\r\nafter having been the object of her most ardent worship, ended by\r\nfinding her one of its enemies. Some people are born under a lucky star;\r\nupon them everything smiles, and they can do nothing that fails to turn\r\nout well. Such a being was the lovely Juliette la Messine, who, timid\r\nand still unaware of her own personal attractions, appeared on the\r\nhorizon of Paris society at one of the parties given by the Comtesse\r\nd’Agoult. The Countess was “Daniel Stern” in the world of letters, the\r\nmother of Cosima Wagner and Madame Emile Ollivier, and the heroine of\r\nthe most lasting romance in the life of the composer Liszt. Madame\r\nd’Agoult, about whom I cannot say much because I have never met her, was\r\nin the late ’fifties a very important personage in Parisian society,\r\nthough her own circle had repudiated her since the scandal of her\r\nadventure with Liszt. But though very few women cared to be seen at her\r\nhouse, most men of note, whether in politics or in the world of letters,\r\nconsidered it an honour to be asked to her house. She presided over a\r\nsalon that dictated the tone in many things, and where she succeeded in\r\ngrouping together many celebrities who, perhaps, but for her would never\r\nhave had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with each other.\r\n\r\nJuliette la Messine, then in the full bloom of her fair beauty, had just\r\nwritten a book of philosophy and criticism called “Les Idées\r\nanti-Proudhoniennes,” which was a reply to an attack made by Proudhon on\r\nGeorges Sand and on Madame d’Agoult herself. She sent a copy of her book\r\nto Daniel Stern, who was very much struck by its virile, lucid\r\ncomposition, and thinking it was the work of a man who, in order to\r\ndisguise his identity, had assumed a woman’s name, wrote in reply to the\r\nauthor, that she felt surprised at his having taken a feminine\r\npseudonym, while women generally tried to pass off as men in their\r\nwritings. When she saw Mlle. la Messine she was at once attracted by her\r\npeculiar and wonderful charm; a friendship that was only to come to an\r\nend with the life of the Comtesse d’Agoult was at once formed between\r\nthe two women, who had a great deal in common, and who were both\r\nenthusiastic, eager to perform noble deeds and to work for the welfare\r\nof humanity. It was also at one of the receptions of Daniel Stern that\r\nJuliette la Messine met for the first time Edmond Adam, whom she was to\r\nmarry later on and under whose name she was to reach celebrity.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of their marriage was the creation of a new salon in\r\nParis, which very soon became a centre of political activity. It was at\r\nthe time when the Republican party, vanquished by the _coup d’état_ of\r\nNapoleon III., by which he had definitely imposed himself and his\r\ndynasty upon a more surprised than terrified France, was beginning to\r\nraise its head again. Thiers, who at that particular moment thought fit\r\nto join the ranks of the enemies of the Empire, was continually\r\nreproaching Edmond Adam for his hesitation to throw himself into the\r\nbattle, and was inviting him to work with all his strength for the\r\noverthrow of the Bonapartes, adding, what in fact he did not believe but\r\nhe thought it to his advantage to seem to profess, that no government\r\nwas possible in France except a Republic. Adam then said to his wife the\r\nfollowing memorable words which she repeats in her memoirs: “I am quite\r\nready to work for the Republic, more and better than I have done\r\nhitherto, but what can abstentionists like ourselves do for her?”\r\nHusband and wife organised their salon as a meeting place where\r\nadherents of Republican ideas could gather together and exchange their\r\nideas and opinions. The parties given by Thiers in his hotel in the Rue\r\nSt. Georges were generally frequented by the older members of the party,\r\nwhilst the younger ones assembled with Laurent Pichat; both young and\r\nold could be met in the house of Madame Adam, who, with all the charm of\r\nher lovely face and the elegance of her graceful manners, made a most\r\ndelightful hostess. The first people who assembled around her were for\r\nthe most part literary men like Henri Martin, Legouvé, Hetzel the\r\neditor, Gaston Paris, Bixio, Garnier-Pagès, Toussenel, Nefftzer, Texier,\r\nChallemel-Lacour, Jules Ferry, Pelletan--all men well worthy to be\r\nappreciated by her. Some are already forgotten, whilst others will never\r\nbe consigned to oblivion by those who follow them on the road of life.\r\nBut very soon she tried to draw towards her all the younger forces of\r\nthe Republican party, concentrating her attention specially upon\r\nGambetta. She did not, in the early days, know him, but Adam, who had\r\nmet him at a dinner with Laurent Pichat, had spoken to her of him with\r\nan enthusiasm that surprised her the more because he was not generally\r\naddicted to such expansive feelings. In this connection she relates\r\nwith humour that she spoke to Hetzel, and asked him to bring to one of\r\nher dinners the young advocate, who had made for himself such a name\r\nalready and whose reputation at the Bar was fast becoming considerable,\r\nespecially since he had defended Delescluze against the government.\r\nHetzel screamed with surprise when she proposed it, declaring that she\r\ndid not know the man whom she proposed to admit at her hospitable table.\r\nGambetta, he told her, was a vulgar, common sort of individual, blind of\r\none eye, dirty and unkempt, with black nails, and walking about in\r\ndisreputable clothes which, to add to his uncouth appearance, were never\r\nproperly put on or properly fastened. Madame Adam insisted nevertheless.\r\nHer womanly instinct had guessed that if the man in question was really\r\nin possession of the genius attributed to him, it would be easy for him\r\nwhen once admitted in the houses of civilised people to adopt their\r\nmanners and to polish his own. On the other hand, if he failed to notice\r\nthe inadequacies of his first education, he would not be the man of\r\nvalue she had been led to think he could become, and in that case it\r\nwould be easy to drop him after this first attempt at drawing him from\r\nthe society with which he had hitherto associated. But she wanted to\r\njudge for herself, she persisted with Hetzel, and at last persuaded him\r\nto take her invitation to Gambetta.\r\n\r\nThe young advocate was at first very much surprised. He knew Edmond\r\nAdam, had vaguely heard he had a wife, but had never troubled to think\r\nabout her much, therefore he was rather astonished to find himself the\r\nobject of her attention; still he decided to go, saying at the same time\r\nto one of his friends of the Café Procope, where he generally used to\r\nspend his afternoons: “I shall accept; it will be curious to see what\r\nkind of woman Adam’s bourgeoise may be.”\r\n\r\nA large and distinguished company had been asked to meet the Republican\r\norator. Laurent Pichat, Eugène Pelletan, Challemel-Lacour, Jules Ferry,\r\nHetzel, of course, and, lastly, the Marquis Jules de Lasteyrie, an\r\nintimate friend of Thiers and an ardent Orleanist, who, moreover, was\r\none of the most elegant men in Paris. The latter had begged hard to be\r\nincluded in that dinner, as he was excessively interested in Gambetta,\r\nand having arrived a little in advance of the other guests, he said to\r\nMadame Adam that he would repeat all the incidents of the dinner to\r\nThiers, whom he knew to be very anxious to hear his opinion about “the\r\nyoung monster,” as he called him.\r\n\r\nGambetta had imagined that he was going to one of those houses where an\r\nutter absence of the conventionalities of life is the order of the day,\r\nand that consequently he would not be required, as it were, even to wash\r\nhis hands before making his appearance at the hospitable board to which\r\nhe had been bidden. He arrived in one of those indescribable costumes\r\nwhich are neither evening nor morning dress, with a waistcoat buttoned\r\nhigh up to the throat and a flannel shirt. He found the whole company in\r\northodox evening dress, and his hostess in a lovely velvet costume, out\r\nof which the most beautiful pair of shoulders were looming in their\r\nsnowy whiteness. He tried to excuse himself, saying vaguely: “If I had\r\nonly guessed.” “You probably would have refused my invitation,” replied\r\nhis hostess. “It is not nice of you to say so.”\r\n\r\nEverybody felt more or less embarrassed. Lasteyrie, who was always\r\nindulgent with the extravagances of mankind, could not help whispering\r\ninto Adam’s ear: “If at least he had donned the blouse of the common\r\nworkman, I could have forgiven him, but this kind of get up!” And he\r\nmade a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\nNo woman alive had greater tact than Madame Adam. Seeing the\r\nembarrassment of Gambetta, as well as the look of disgust with which her\r\nother guests observed him, she went up to the Marquis de Lasteyrie, and\r\nin a low voice told him that in order to try and mend matters she was\r\ngoing to dispossess him from the seat of honour which belonged to him by\r\nright, and to give her arm to Gambetta. “You are quite right,” replied\r\nthe Marquis. “If you did anything else, the servants might be tempted to\r\nforget to offer him some soup. And besides, this will allow us to see\r\nwhether he understands great things and their meaning.”\r\n\r\nJuliette Lambert, to give her her pseudonym in literature, to her\r\nhusband’s amazement, walked up to Gambetta, and took his arm to go down\r\nto the dining-room. When they were seated, the Radical leader bent down\r\ntowards her ear, and in very humble tones told her that he would never\r\nforget the lesson she had given to him in such a delicate manner. He\r\nunderstood the meaning of great things, and had emerged to his honour\r\nfrom a very trying experience.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, much later that Gambetta became a regular visitor at\r\nthe house of Madame Adam. Years had passed since his first introduction\r\nto her, and poor Juliette Lambert had gone through bitter trials that\r\nhad left their everlasting impress on her ardent and enthusiastic\r\nnature. The war with all its horrors, the Commune with all its terrors,\r\nhad shaken her bright equanimity, and in that generous soul one feeling\r\nhad taken the place of almost every other--a deep love for her poor\r\nhumiliated country; a passionate desire to see her once more occupying\r\nthe proud position from which fate and the mistakes of men had despoiled\r\nher. Later on, when the husband she loved so fondly was snatched away\r\nfrom her, and when, beside her daughter and the children of the latter,\r\nshe found herself with no one to love in the whole wide world, she\r\nattached herself to that one idea and ambition--to revenge the\r\nhumiliations of 1870, to get back for that France, to whom all her\r\nenergies were devoted, those provinces which she had lost, and to\r\nrevenge herself on the conqueror to whom she had owed the shattering of\r\nso many of her brightest dreams.\r\n\r\nShe had always been the enemy of the Bonaparte dynasty; she could not,\r\nthough she was on very good terms with several members of the Orleans\r\nfamily, reconcile herself to their stepping upon the throne left vacant\r\nby Napoleon III. She had always adored liberty, that of nations as well\r\nas that of individuals, and she imagined that that ideal Republic she\r\nhad dreamt of could be brought into existence and would be able to give\r\nback to France her glory and prestige.\r\n\r\nThis one idea dominated all her actions and inspired all her writings.\r\nShe used all the resources of her wonderful intelligence, all the\r\nactivity of her remarkable mind, and all her knowledge and her\r\nexperience of the world to realise it. She opened once more the doors of\r\nher salon, which had remained closed after the death of Edmond Adam, and\r\nthough at the bottom of her heart an inconsolable widow, she forced\r\nherself to present to the glances of others the appearance of a woman\r\nwithout heartache. Everybody who approached her, even those who did not\r\nshare her opinions either in politics or in intellectual and moral\r\nmatters, fell under the influence of her charm, and were subjugated by\r\nher enthusiasm and her earnest, ardent words. One could see at a glance\r\nthat she was sincere, true--a friend on whom one could always rely, and\r\nan enemy who would always fight loyally. Moreover, her clear mind had\r\nthe faculty of looking into the future with an extraordinary\r\nperspicacity, and she seldom was mistaken in her judgments of men or\r\nfacts. She it was who for the first time suggested to her friends the\r\npossibility of an alliance with Russia, by which French prestige might\r\nbe strengthened. She it was who began working for it at a time when even\r\nwise political men in both countries only smiled when such a thing was\r\nmentioned in their presence.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that she was an irreconcilable enemy of Germany. In a\r\ncertain sense this was true, but there was no preconceived hatred in her\r\nfeelings. She detested Germans because she had seen them trampling her\r\nunfortunate country under their feet, because she had owed to them some\r\nof the bitterest hours she had had to go through in her life. Yet she\r\nhad no aversion to German culture, and could recognise the great\r\nqualities of the German race, qualities which, perhaps, gave her even\r\nmore reasons to detest it. She was above everything else just. Her\r\ncharacter had too much real greatness about it ever to give way to any\r\nmean or petty feeling, even where an enemy was concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived in Paris I used to see her daily. She was then at the\r\nheight of her beauty and fame, and political men of all shades used to\r\ncrowd to her receptions, and to bow down before her splendid grace and\r\nproud demeanour. She was considered as the real Queen of the Third\r\nRepublic, and no important political measure was undertaken by any\r\nmember of the government of that day without her having been consulted\r\nabout its opportuneness. No one ever regretted having asked her advice\r\nor trusted to the clearness of her judgments; nor could any say that she\r\nhad revealed the slightest fraction of all the secrets of state which\r\nhad been confided to her.\r\n\r\nI do not believe a more discreet person ever lived, and it is a great\r\ndeal to that immense and so rare quality that she owed the influence she\r\nmanaged to acquire with all, without exception, who came into contact\r\nwith her. I can talk about it the more easily because on several\r\ndifferent occasions I had the opportunity to convince myself personally\r\nof her discretion. Most certainly among her many qualities I believe it\r\nwas the latter that her friends, and among them Gambetta, appreciated\r\nthe most in her. The great orator had never forgotten that first dinner\r\nto which she had asked him, and later on, when the fall of the Empire\r\nhad drawn them more together, he began, with discretion at first and\r\nwith impetuosity at last, to consult her and to confide in her all his\r\ndreams of glory. She grew not only to like him, but to feel for him a\r\ngreat, deep, true affection, one of those that a woman can only\r\nexperience when she has reached middle life, known what the storms of\r\nthe heart mean, and, greatest joy of all, felt what it is to be\r\neverything and yet nothing in another man’s life. One can boldly affirm\r\nthat it was she who made Gambetta what he became in the later years of\r\nhis life, that it was to her he owed the great development of his\r\nfighting qualities, as well as the great dignity of which he gave proofs\r\nin so many important questions, a dignity that in those long bygone\r\ndays, when he had appeared with a flannel shirt at the first dinner\r\ngiven in his honour by Juliette Lambert, no one supposed he could ever\r\nattain. Gambetta, who also could very quickly discover the good and the\r\nbad sides of the people with whom he was thrown into contact,\r\nexperienced in time for her a reverence such as he had never imagined he\r\ncould feel for any woman in the wide world. He not only admired her\r\nmind, but he also recognised the great superiority which her culture,\r\napart from everything else, gave her over him, and he soon turned to her\r\nto solve all his doubts, and to be advised as to all that he was to do\r\nto successfully reach the eminence to which he had aspired from the\r\nfirst day he arrived in Paris, a poor student, with hardly enough money\r\nin his pocket to be able to dine every day.\r\n\r\nBut, strange to say, when one thinks of the exceptional physical\r\nadvantages and charm of Madame Adam, he never for one single moment\r\nallowed himself to pay any banal attentions to her; she perhaps was not\r\nquite so devoid of a nearer feeling of attraction towards him.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Gambetta placed her so high in his thoughts that it had never\r\noccurred to him to discover that underneath the adviser and counsellor,\r\nto whom he turned for comfort and encouragement at almost every instant\r\nof his life, there could exist a fair, beautiful woman with a womanly\r\nheart and womanly feelings. He did not realise that, in associating\r\nherself with his dreams and his ambitions, she also associated with\r\nthem, perhaps even unknown to herself, her own future and her own\r\nexistence. Perhaps this misunderstanding, which circumstances and not\r\ntheir own will had created between them, influenced their relations\r\ntowards the end of the life of Gambetta, but, let it be said to the\r\nhonour of Madame Adam, she never allowed the ignorance of her charms in\r\nwhich her friend indulged to influence her friendship for him, and, with\r\na strength of character such as very few women would have been capable\r\nof, she sacrificed herself to his future and only thought of his\r\nsuccesses. She tried to persuade herself of the fact she had contrived\r\nlong ago to impress upon others, i.e. that she was living only for her\r\nchild and for her country, and that she was above everything a great\r\npatriot, “une grande française,” and nothing else.\r\n\r\nShe still believed in the Republic at that period of life when I first\r\nmet her. She still hoped that it would bring to her beloved France the\r\npeace and the prosperity she so passionately desired for it. Later on,\r\nhowever, she was destined to experience in that hope, too, some of the\r\ngreatest disappointments of her whole life. For a woman with high ideals\r\nand a great moral aim, as was the case with her, nothing could be\r\nharder to bear than the slow realisation that she had nursed a false\r\nideal, the conviction that she had worshipped at a wrong altar. And yet\r\nthis great trial was not spared to her who had already suffered so much.\r\nLittle by little the scales had fallen from her eyes, and she discovered\r\nthat personal ambitions, personal greed, and personal intrigues flourish\r\njust as much and just as well, and perhaps even more, under a republic\r\nthan under a monarchy. She saw that humanity remains unchangeable,\r\nwhilst things undergo many transformations, that bad passions never die,\r\nand that good and virtuous people are always the victims of those who\r\nare their inferiors in moral worth.\r\n\r\nI remember one evening that I happened to be alone with Gambetta, at\r\nabout the time that he became Prime Minister, we discussed together\r\nMadame Adam. He spoke of her with feelings not only of reverence, but\r\nalso with an admiration the more remarkably expressed in that it was\r\ndone without the usual enthusiasm which he generally displayed when\r\ntalking about things or people who were near to his heart. He told me\r\nthat but for her he would certainly never have reached to the political\r\neminence on which he found himself. We were old friends, and I could\r\nallow myself to touch upon delicate subjects with him; so I ventured to\r\nask him whether the beauty of Juliette Lambert had ever made an\r\nimpression on him. He replied without the slightest hesitation that he\r\nhad never thought about it, so perfectly superior she had appeared to\r\nhim, intellectually, and so entirely he had put her upon a pedestal\r\nwhence he had never once thought that she could come down. I asked him\r\nthen brutally why the thought of the great things he could have achieved\r\ntogether with her, had he made of her the companion of his life, had\r\nnever struck him. Gambetta looked at me very closely, then after a few\r\nmoments of silence softly said: “I would never have dared to allow my\r\nthoughts to rest upon that idea, I know myself but too well, and I would\r\nnot have had the courage to make her unhappy. Believe me, that woman\r\nwould never suffer more from anything than from the loss of her\r\nillusions, and she sees in me the man she has created, not the man that\r\nin reality I am.”\r\n\r\nI have often thought of these words, of the great Republican leader,\r\nespecially when in later years, long after he had entered into eternal\r\nrest, I saw Madame Adam once again on my return to Paris after a long\r\nabsence. A great transformation had taken place in her. She had\r\nwitnessed that loss of her illusions to which her friend had referred,\r\nand suffered from it just as he had foreshadowed. She had seen her\r\nbeloved France not able to come out of the mesh of intrigues and\r\nmiseries into which the man who by the force of events had become ruler\r\nhad entangled France, and she had realised that her conception of a\r\nRepublic, such as she had dreamt of, was an impossibility; that it is\r\nnot by changing its form of government a nation rises to greatness and\r\nglory. She had been obliged to assist, powerless to avert it, the\r\ndestruction of all the plans which she had made together with those men\r\nwho had been her friends, and among whom so many had become her\r\nadversaries, according as the gulf of the opinions that had come to\r\ndivide them had grown broader and broader. She had experienced that\r\ngrief which is so very acute to a warm, womanly heart such as hers, of\r\nfinding that she had no longer the power to influence those who formerly\r\nhad cherished the same high ideals that in that beautiful world her\r\nimagination had conjured she had placed before everything else.\r\n\r\nDeath, too, had robbed her of much that she had leaned upon, both in\r\nFrance and abroad; she had undergone those fiery trials out of which\r\nnoble souls emerge greater, nobler, more valiant and splendid than\r\nbefore, but under the weight of which vulgar natures are destroyed.\r\nAfter all these moral struggles and inward battles she had acquired even\r\nmore courage, more indulgence, more charity, and more faith in the\r\nInfinite, and in an Eternity to which perhaps she had not given much\r\nattention in the days of her youth, when the world was at her feet and\r\nsovereigns bowed before her inimitable grace. To these consolations her\r\ntired, weary soul turned when everything else had failed her. The\r\ntransformation that has taken place in the personality of Juliette\r\nLambert is one of those phenomena that, when met with, remains always\r\nthe subject of the deepest admiration on the part of those who have\r\nwatched the change come about, and have followed its various phases.\r\n\r\nPolitics, that used to be the all-engrossing subject in the life of\r\nMadame Adam, have now dropped to the second plane, and purely\r\nintellectual subjects engross her more. Her affection for her beloved\r\nFrance, though it remains still the one absorbing passion of her life,\r\nis no longer expressed by the old wild desire to see France revenged\r\nupon her enemies. Her patriotism has assumed proportions that give it\r\nmore earnestness, more steadfastness, and thus it makes the greater\r\nimpression on others, and carries an authority that passion, when\r\nexpressed violently, can never attain. She has obliged strangers to\r\nrespect her patriotism, and to see her in that graver, sober light which\r\nalone is worthy of the great patriot that she has always been, of the\r\nwoman who in success as well as in disaster has never despaired of the\r\nresources of her country, nor of its power to arise, stronger and more\r\npowerful than it was before, out of disaster and ruin, and, worse evil\r\nthan any other, out of the intrigues of unscrupulous men who want to use\r\nher, in order to further their own greed or their own gain.\r\n\r\nWith that difference Juliette Lambert in her old age has remained what\r\nshe was in her youth, a noble, charming woman, kind and affectionate,\r\nwith the warmest of hearts and the most generous character. She lives\r\nmostly in the country, in a dear old house, formerly a cloister in those\r\nolden times when a king reigned over France. L’Abbaye du Val de Gyf, as\r\nit is called, is one of those lovely dwellings where everything speaks\r\nof peace and rest, and of the high soul and earnest mind of its owner.\r\nThere, among her books and her roses, and her dogs and her birds, she\r\nlives in quietness, and spends her days thinking of the past, and\r\nwriting her wonderful reminiscences. There her friends come and see her,\r\nas often as she allows them to do so, there one of her best loved\r\nfriends, the unfortunate Queen Amélie of Portugal, has often fled for\r\nconsolation, because the closest intimacy unites the fiery Republican\r\nand the daughter of the Bourbons. There Madame Adam forgets her\r\ndisillusions, and thinks only of the good things which life has left\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw her in her beautiful home at Gyf we talked about old\r\ntimes, and all those hopes of the great things which we both had\r\nexpected out of the Franco-Russian alliance. She frankly owned to me\r\nthat it had not realised the great hopes that she had trusted it would,\r\nand rather bitterly remarked that “things we yearn after very much never\r\nturn out quite like we have expected they will when they come to be\r\nrealised. But then,” she added with a shade of malice, “how very seldom\r\ndo we see what we wish for realised in general?”\r\n\r\nAnd thus I take leave of her, after an acquaintance that stretches over\r\nmore than a quarter of a century, the same loving, delightful, clever\r\nand kind woman that she has always been, with her serene smile, and\r\ngrave, serious eyes that have always looked upon humanity through the\r\nwindows of her soul, and never through the spectacles of envy, hatred,\r\nor any of those bad feelings that most human beings indulge in. An\r\nexception she has always stood amongst women, and an exception she will\r\nremain for all those who later on, even when she too has disappeared\r\nfrom this mortal scene, will read about her, and think what a noble,\r\nbeautiful creature she has always proved herself to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA FEW LITERARY MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the many years which I spent in Paris I had numerous\r\nopportunities of meeting the majority of the remarkable literary men who\r\nabounded in France towards the end of last century. Since then their\r\nnumber has considerably decreased, indeed it is very much to be doubted\r\nwhether the great thinkers, such as Taine, Renan, Guizot, or Thiers,\r\nhave ever been replaced.\r\n\r\nI knew Renan intimately, and wish I could describe him as he deserves.\r\nTo hear certain people speak of the author of the “Origines du\r\nChristianisme” one would think that he was a ferocious hater, not only\r\nof religion, but also of everything that approached it. In reality Renan\r\nwas intensely religious. Few people have understood so fully the\r\nbeauties of the moral preached by Christ, and few people have had more\r\nreverence for the sacred individuality of the Saviour of mankind. He\r\ntried to imitate Him in all the actions of his life, to be, like Him,\r\nkind and indulgent and compassionate for the woes of the world. From his\r\nsojourn in the seminary of St. Sulpice, he had kept the demeanour and\r\nthe manners of a Catholic priest, and do what he could, that atmosphere\r\nclung to him.\r\n\r\nBut he had a quality which many clericals fail to possess, a very clear\r\ninsight into religious matters, and the faculty of being able to set\r\naside what was superstition, and retaining what could be kept of the\r\npoetry that attaches to the teachings of the different churches that\r\ndivide the world. He always sought truth, and never rested until he\r\nthought he had found it, but he never gave out his own ideas as perfect\r\nones, nor tried to impose them upon others. His was essentially an\r\nimpartial and a tolerant mind. Indeed his thoughts were so constantly\r\ndirected towards those regions where it is to be hoped eternal truth\r\nexists, that he did not believe it worth while to assume an intolerance\r\nwhich I do not think he could ever have felt, no matter in what\r\ncircumstances nor under what provocation. I have never met a man more\r\nindifferent to criticisms directed against his person or his works, and\r\nI remember once when a very bitter article concerning his book, “La Vie\r\nde Jésus,” had been brought to his notice, he merely smiled and quietly\r\nsaid: “Why do you think I must be angry at this? Isn’t every one\r\nentitled to have an opinion of his own?”\r\n\r\nThis book, so wonderful in its simplicity, among all those which he had\r\nwritten, was the one he cared for the most, partly because he had\r\ncomposed it in collaboration with his sister, Henriette Renan, who had\r\nsuch a singular influence over his life, and who was as remarkable a\r\npersonality as himself. During the journey which they had undertaken\r\ntogether in the Holy Land, they had thought about the book which they\r\nwanted to write. In his “Souvenirs d’Enfance et de Jeunesse,” Renan\r\nrecognises that the person who had had the greatest influence over his\r\nmind had been his sister, and he walked in the road her footsteps had\r\ntrodden until he also saw the great Light after which they had both\r\nlonged so much. In speaking about him, one could use with justice the\r\nwords he applied to his sister when he wrote that “though noble lives\r\nhaven’t the need to be remembered by anyone else than God, one must\r\nnevertheless try to fix their image in the minds of the generations that\r\ncome after them.”\r\n\r\nI am thinking about these words as I am now remembering all the\r\nconversations we had together, and the patience with which he explained\r\nto me all the various points I asked him to develop. He was patience\r\npersonified; he never regarded anything trouble when, by inconvenience\r\nto himself, he could be useful to others. His conversations were always\r\ninstructive, always attractive, and always worth listening to, even when\r\nthey strayed on to frivolous subjects, which he often liked to touch. It\r\nmust not be supposed that Renan was a grave philosopher who did not care\r\nfor the congenial or the pleasant, or the amusing things which happen in\r\nlife. He could enjoy mirth like, and with the frankness of, a child.\r\n\r\nHis works have been discussed more perhaps than those of most writers of\r\nhis time, and though they have left a deep impress upon the minds of\r\nserious people, no one who has read them can say that their influence\r\nhas been anything else but to good. The image that he has drawn for us\r\nof the person of Christ is so pure, so noble, so entirely religious,\r\nthat even those who object to the way in which he has presented it\r\ncannot but be attracted by the image that his pen has evoked.\r\n\r\nHowever strange it may seem to say so, Renan himself was more surprised\r\nthan anyone else to find he had written a work which evoked so many\r\ncriticisms. He had been so entirely absorbed by his subject that he had\r\nnever given a thought to anything else but the picture of the Redeemer,\r\nsuch as it had presented itself to him, in the spot which had seen Him\r\nwork and die. He had never intended publishing a book of controversy,\r\nand in presence of the storm which it provoked he was even more\r\nastounded than sorry. It was not in his nature to be angry, and regret\r\nwas impossible for a soul like his, which only performed what it\r\nthought and firmly believed to be right.\r\n\r\nContrary to the feeling some express about him, Renan had never indulged\r\nin atheistic opinions, and he strongly condemned and opposed those who\r\nsupported them. His belief and faith in a Supreme Being were as firm as\r\nthey were sincere, and he only deplored that his convictions had not\r\nallowed him to remain a son of the Catholic Church, in which in his\r\nyouth he had hoped to become a priest. Her teachings had left their\r\nimpress upon his soul, and directed it towards the deeper studies in\r\nwhich he became absorbed.\r\n\r\nRenan had married a woman well worthy of him, and who made him a\r\nwonderful helpmate. She knew how to smooth all difficulties from his\r\npath, and proved well fitted for her difficult position as the wife of\r\none of the greatest thinkers of modern times. She was an accomplished\r\nhostess. To the evening parties which saw their friends assembled in\r\ntheir little home in the Rue de l’Observatoire, she gave the impress of\r\nher own charming personality, and presided over the conversations with\r\nimmense tact and dignity. Their daughter, who married a professor at the\r\nSorbonne, M. Psichari, a Greek by origin, continued the traditions left\r\nto her by her parents, and until lately had a literary salon, which was\r\nwell known in Paris. I do not know whether it still exists or not.\r\n\r\nRenan was extremely ugly; this has been repeated too often for anyone\r\nnot to be aware of it. But a more attractive face than he possessed is\r\nnot easily to be found. There was such kindness in his smile, in the\r\nlook of his eyes, and such intelligence in that large head with its\r\nnoble brow, that one could not help being struck by it, and admiring it\r\nfar more than if it had indeed been a beautiful face. The painter Bonnat\r\nhas made a portrait of him that is, I think, the best one that has ever\r\ncome from his brush. It shows Renan as he really was; one has only got\r\nto look at it, and the original appears as we, who knew him well, saw\r\nhim sitting in his deep arm-chair, with his head slightly bent down on\r\nhis chest, and the expressive countenance that used to brighten up\r\nwhenever he met a friend, or heard about some noble deed such as he\r\nhimself would have liked to perform. It was impossible to know him and\r\nnot to admire the man in him, even more, perhaps, than the great thinker\r\nor the great writer, because, after all, intellect or genius can be met\r\nsooner than real virtue or real goodness--and Renan was essentially\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nFrom Renan to Taine is not a far step, and somehow it seems to me that\r\nthe latter’s name is the only one worthy to be pronounced immediately\r\nafter that of my old friend and master. I have also known Taine well,\r\nmet him often, and always been struck by his large, wide mind, so\r\nutterly devoid of prejudices, and at the same time so absolute in the\r\njudgments which he thought he had the right to formulate. I must\r\nemphasise the words, “which he thought he had the right,” because those\r\njudgments assume the intelligence as well as the moral personality of\r\nHippolyte Taine. He was an historian before everything else, perhaps\r\neven before he was a critic, though he counts among the greatest that\r\nFrench literature has seen; but his inclinations led him before\r\neverything else towards the study of the past, and of the causes that\r\nhad brought about the great transformations that the world has\r\nwitnessed, ever since society in the sense we understand it to-day began\r\nto exist; and whilst trying to fathom these causes he slowly came to\r\nconvictions, which he never would renounce when once he thought them\r\njustified. Nothing would move him to change one line in the writings\r\nwhich, after due consideration, he decided to publish, and even his long\r\nfriendship with the Princesse Mathilde did not influence him in\r\ndescribing Napoleon in any other sense than the one in which he had\r\nunderstood that colossal figure. The story goes that after having read\r\nthe study which he first gave to the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, she sent\r\nhim her card with “p.p.c.” written on it, a hint which he took, and as\r\nis known everywhere, their intercourse of many years came to an end.\r\n\r\nTaine used to spend the greater part of the year at Menthon, in Savoy,\r\non the borders of the Lake of Annecy, and it was during a visit which I\r\npaid to him there, from Aix-les-Bains where I was undergoing a cure,\r\nthat I had with him the longest and perhaps the most interesting\r\nconversation in the whole time of our intercourse with each other. We\r\ndiscussed many subjects, and among others his great work, the “Origines\r\nde la France Contemporaine.” He told me how he had begun it with the\r\nintention of stopping after the first two volumes devoted to the _Ancien\r\nRégime_, and how gradually the subject had taken hold of him and he had\r\ncome to the conclusion that he must develop it, and bring it to the\r\npoint which he considered to be the only right one for properly\r\nunderstanding the immense and terrible drama of the Revolution. He hated\r\nanarchy, he thought it his duty to show it up in all its vivid horror,\r\nand he tried to write the story of that tragedy with the same\r\nimpartiality he would have brought to bear on the description of it in\r\nany other country than his own. As he told me on that day: “C’est un\r\npauvre patriotisme que celui qui s’imagine que l’on doit excuser les\r\ncrimes de son pays, simplement par ce qu’on en est un citoyen (“It is a\r\npoor kind of patriotism which imagines that it must excuse the crimes of\r\nits own country, simply because one is born a citizen”).\r\n\r\nWith this direction of mind it is not to be wondered that, though\r\nadmired by many, Taine was merely liked by the few. He could not be\r\ncomplaisant to the illusions or the false idols of the crowd, and he\r\nrepudiated all that he called in his expressive language, “les\r\nexagérations d’ignorants qui se croient instruits” (“the exaggerations\r\nof ignoramuses who believe themselves learned”). He was a philosopher in\r\nhis way, though it was entirely a personal philosophy which was founded\r\non his own experience rather than on the teachings of those who had\r\npreceded him on the road of life and knowledge. Living most of his time\r\nfar away from Paris, he was, according to the words of Balzac, one of\r\nthose great minds “which solitude had preserved from all worldly\r\nmeannesses.” Left face to face with the magnificences of Nature, he had\r\nacquired some of its impassivity before the woes of mankind, and in his\r\njudgments of events he often forgot the tears and the sorrows, and the\r\nblood out of which they had developed.\r\n\r\nRenan was a soft and kind moralist, Taine was an inexorable thinker,\r\nDumas Fils was the type of the sceptical worldly philosopher who hastens\r\nto follow the advice of Figaro, that it is better to laugh at some\r\nthings for fear of being obliged to cry over them. Anything more\r\nsparkling than his conversation it would be difficult to describe,\r\nanything more amusing than the paradoxes which he loved to develop has\r\nnever been met with. But with it all there was also about that charming,\r\ndelightful man a strong leaning towards the tendency to moralise, and to\r\npose as a moralist. Indeed he might, perhaps, have become a moralist in\r\nfact, had his rambling, sharp mind allowed him to think about moral\r\nproblems otherwise than in associating them with his “bons mots.” These\r\nconstitute the great attraction of his plays, and give to some of them\r\nthat bitter flavour which, in spite of all the wit displayed in the\r\ndialogue, hangs about their whole construction.\r\n\r\nIn his sadly truthful comedy, “La Visite de Noces,” the analysis which\r\nhe makes there of the great fact, which especially in France has\r\nabsorbed so much of public attention, the fact of love outside marriage,\r\nis certainly full of ingenious reasonings. But though it strikes the\r\nmind, it does not appeal to the heart of those who listen to it, because\r\nit is not with witty phrases that a social evil can be mended. However,\r\nthis last fact did not disturb the equanimity of Alexandre Dumas. He did\r\nnot pose as an apostle, and he knew very well that principles fall down\r\nvery easily before the strength of passion aroused. He had no hopes of\r\ncuring the evils of mankind, but it amused him to satirise them, and to\r\nlaugh at them, and to talk of them, and he did perhaps more than any\r\nother writer of his generation to acclimatise society to the fact of the\r\nexistence of many things, which until he made them popular had never\r\nbeen mentioned--in the society of ladies at least.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Dumas was married to a Russian, a very intelligent and, in her\r\nyouth, a very attractive woman, but who, towards the end of her life,\r\ndeveloped slatternly habits. Those who called upon her unawares found\r\nher with her hair wrapped up in curl-papers, her face seldom washed, and\r\nin an untidy dressing-gown, the garment she most affected. I remember\r\none morning at Dieppe, where the clever dramatist had a villa, I found\r\nher sitting in her garden overlooking the sea, in a kind of white\r\nwrapper, none too fresh, and without any stockings on her feet. When\r\nlunch was announced Dumas turned to his wife and asked her whether she\r\nwould not tidy herself up a bit, to which she replied with indifference:\r\n“Why, I am all right.” To watch her husband shrug his shoulders was a\r\nsight in itself.\r\n\r\nTwo daughters were born to M. and Mme. Dumas. The eldest married a\r\nbanker, Maurice Lippmann, with whom she\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: H. Manuel, Paris._\r\n\r\nMADAME JULIETTE ADAM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Pierre Petit, Paris._\r\n\r\nALEX. DUMAS (Père)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: H. Manuel, Paris._\r\n\r\nANATOLE FRANCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Gerschel, Paris._\r\n\r\nOCTAVE MIRBEAU]\r\n\r\ncould not agree, and a divorce soon followed. Colette Dumas was a\r\npretty, wild kind of creature, gifted with a charm quite her own, and\r\nabsolutely devoid of what is commonly called moral sense. She had never\r\nbeen baptised, and she was never brought up, but simply grew as she\r\nliked, mostly in her father’s study, where she heard expounded the whole\r\ntime the theories after which she tried later on to shape her own life.\r\nThere was no harm about her, but, alas, no principles ever ruled her\r\nconduct, and a more lovely little animal never existed. The poor girl\r\ndiscovered later on that life was not the comedy she had been led to\r\nthink it, and before she died a few years ago she must have often\r\nregretted the false education that she had received, and lamented the\r\nviews which she had taken of existence, which to her youthful eyes had\r\nappeared in the light of one great enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHer sister Jeannine was quite a different character, as sedate as\r\nColette was hasty, and with strong common sense instead of passionate\r\ncravings after the impossible. She was married to an officer belonging\r\nto the old aristocracy, and she knew very well how to adapt herself to\r\nher new existence in the provincial town where she settled, and where,\r\nlike all happy people, she had no history.\r\n\r\nAt the time I am writing the description, the Goncourts were talked\r\nabout a great deal in French literary circles. I have attended\r\nreceptions at their house, but I never could share the enthusiasm that\r\nsome of their writings excited among the general public. They were both\r\nclever, Jules the more so of the two, but though they showed themselves\r\nvery hard workers, one can well question the use their work has proved\r\nto the development of the intellectual capacities of their\r\ncontemporaries. It is very much to be doubted whether their books will\r\nsurvive them for any considerable time. One thing is certain, they were\r\nthe first to start the school of self-admiration that now reigns so\r\ncompletely over French modern literature.\r\n\r\nOf quite a different type was the Comte de Falloux, a member of the\r\nAcademy, and a writer of no mean talent. The Comte was just as well\r\nknown for his political as for his literary activity, and he represented\r\nin the Chamber of Deputies, and afterwards in the Senate, the Legitimist\r\nparty, of which he was one of the leaders, and where his opinion carried\r\nmuch weight. M. de Falloux was an Ultramontane of the purest water, who\r\nalways looked towards Rome for his inspirations, and who saw nothing\r\ngood outside the Pope and the Jesuits. He was a great favourite among a\r\ncertain coterie of the Faubourg St. Germain, and though a great friend\r\nof Mgr. Dupanloup, the famous Bishop of Orleans, used always to quarrel\r\nwith him, and thought him far too liberal and too leniently inclined\r\ntowards compromise, his own stern, obstinate nature never accepting any.\r\nHe was extremely well read, but he was not an amiable man, and certainly\r\nwas not sympathetic. He was a man of letters belonging to that school of\r\ngrand seigneurs of which the Duc de Broglie and the Duc d’Audiffret\r\nPasquier were such brilliant examples.\r\n\r\nThough I shall speak later on about M. Zola when discussing the Dreyfus\r\ncase, which is so entirely associated with his name, yet I must also\r\nhere say a few words concerning him. In the ’eighties--the period to\r\nwhich I am referring--he had already made a great name for himself as\r\nthe father of the new Naturalistic school. Whether he had directed his\r\nattention that way because he really believed that fictional literature,\r\nsuch as it had been understood until he arrived to transform it, was\r\nbased on false principles I cannot say. Perhaps he simply wanted to make\r\nmore money in trying to offer to the public something that hitherto it\r\nhad not seen, and which was bound to interest it by its unexpectedness\r\nif by nothing else. But what I can certify through personal knowledge of\r\nthe man is that he had enough vanity to prefer being hissed than passed\r\nby in silence. That he had considerable talent no one can deny, but that\r\nhe might have used it in a different direction is also not to be\r\nquestioned. One effect of his style was to turn the heads of would-be\r\nauthors, who, not having the necessary capabilities to write a good\r\nbook, imagined that by imitating Zola, and scribbling plots of\r\nquestionable taste, they would likewise rise to fame, and, what was\r\nstill better, earn fortune, forgetting entirely that talent such as Zola\r\npossessed could allow itself a latitude which people with fewer\r\ncapabilities were better advised not to attempt.\r\n\r\nM. Zola married a very superior and most intelligent woman, who was\r\ngifted with most remarkable qualities of heart and mind. She showed\r\nextraordinary dignity, and most uncommon forbearance in regard to her\r\nhusband, whose memory to this day she tries to defend against any\r\npossible attack. When he died she took to her heart two children of\r\nwhich he was the father, and brought them up, and established them in\r\nthe world with a total abnegation of her own personal feelings. Indeed,\r\nMadame Zola’s conduct in life, even under the most trying circumstances,\r\nmust always be admired. She certainly was far superior to her husband in\r\nregard to moral character, and she is liked and esteemed by all those\r\nwho have had the privilege of meeting and knowing her.\r\n\r\nIn thus recounting the literary men I have met with in Paris I find I\r\nhave forgotten to mention Alphonse Daudet, with his leonine countenance\r\nand his black locks. And yet I knew him better than I did Zola, was a\r\nfrequent visitor at his house, and a great admirer of his amiable and\r\nclever wife, who has since also made a name for herself in the world of\r\nletters. Daudet was an extremely capricious man, and one whose temper\r\nwas of the same character, but his abilities were incontestable, and\r\nsome of his books will very probably outlive those of Zola. When he\r\nhappened to be entirely in good health, which unfortunately was not\r\noften the case in the last years of his life, Daudet was a most pleasant\r\ncompanion, full of conversation, and possessing the French spirit of “le\r\nmot pour rire.” I remember he made us roar one afternoon by relating to\r\nus how once he had received an anonymous letter, in which he was asked,\r\nin case he was “tall, fair, with blue eyes, and wore a pink tie,” to\r\ncome to a rendezvous in the garden of the Tuileries. The writer\r\nobligingly added that unless he fulfilled these conditions in his\r\npersonal appearance, and consented to put on a pink tie, he had better\r\nnot waste his time by coming, as the lady who wanted to make his\r\nacquaintance was determined to do so only if he fulfilled the ideal she\r\nhad nursed for long years. It seemed that the ideal in question depended\r\nfor a great part on the pink tie.\r\n\r\nAlphonse Daudet left two sons and a daughter. Leon Daudet, his eldest\r\nboy, has also written psychological books, but they evince none of his\r\nfather’s wit. He also has made himself conspicuous by his political\r\nvagaries, and his divorce from the granddaughter of Victor Hugo, which,\r\nowing to certain rather strange circumstances connected with it, caused\r\nconsiderable scandal. He is a fervent Catholic, but having, out of\r\nconsideration to the feelings of the Hugo family, consented to be\r\nmarried only at the mairie, without the help of the Church, he had the\r\nbad taste to say publicly, when he married again, that his first\r\nmarriage had not been legal, which, of course, was severely commented\r\nupon even by his best friends. His brother, Lucien Daudet, is a mild\r\nyoung man, who has also literary ambitions, and whose principal\r\noccupation consists in attendance on the Empress Eugénie, whom he has\r\nattempted to describe in a little volume that could not have been\r\npleasant reading for the Empress, because nobody gifted with common\r\nsense likes to be turned into a perfection and a genius rolled into one,\r\nor whilst still alive to be subjected to such extravagant praise. The\r\nyoungest brother of Alphonse Daudet, Ernest Daudet, is also a writer,\r\nwho has given his attention principally to historic subjects. His books\r\nare all worth reading, if a little dull, and he is a great favourite in\r\nthe salons of the Faubourg St. Germain, where his monarchical opinions\r\nhave won him an entrance.\r\n\r\nI wish I had more space at my disposal to mention otherwise than in\r\npassing Jules Claretie, the late Director of the Comédie Française, and\r\nthe author of so many charming novels, which mostly can be put into\r\neverybody’s hands. Many people did not like him, but those who knew him\r\nwell have always felt great sympathy for him. He wrote the French\r\nlanguage as no one else perhaps, with a light, pleasant, vivid style\r\nthat at once conveyed to the reader the author’s thoughts and his way of\r\nlooking upon things. For years before his death in 1914 he wrote a\r\ndelightful weekly chronicle for the _Temps_, called “La vie à Paris,”\r\nwhich will certainly be consulted later on by all who wish to learn the\r\nsocial history of Paris of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE 16TH OF MAY AND THE FALL OF MARSHAL MACMAHON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, after the fall of M. Thiers, the Duc de Magenta was elected second\r\nPresident of the Third Republic, it was generally understood, as I have\r\nmentioned already, that he would only be the representative of a\r\ntransitional government, and that, accepting the tacit conditions under\r\nwhich he had been appointed, he would contribute all the weight of his\r\nauthority to secure the return of France to the flag of the old\r\nMonarchy.\r\n\r\nBut Marshal MacMahon, when he became Head of the State, did not show the\r\nslightest disposition to enter into that scheme. Not only did he\r\ndisappoint the party which had voted for him, because it had believed\r\nthat he would be an instrument in its hands, but he showed strong\r\nsympathies for the Left side of that Assembly which had overthrown the\r\nprevious President more out of pique than anything else. He took\r\nministers holding opinions directly in contradiction to those which he\r\nhimself had been supposed to profess, and when at last, in November,\r\n1873, the Comte de Chambord arrived secretly at Versailles, as I have\r\nalready related, and asked the Marshal to grant him a secret interview\r\nduring which the political situation was to be discussed, the latter\r\nrefused, with the hypocritical words that, though he was quite ready to\r\nsacrifice his life for the Prince, he could not do the dishonourable\r\nthing that was asked of him.\r\n\r\nIt was that word “dishonourable” that upset the Comte de Chambord.\r\nHimself the soul of honour, he could not but be affronted by the\r\nsupposition that he could have had the intention to ask from the Duc de\r\nMagenta anything that could have compromised his loyalty as a man or as\r\na soldier. I believe this had more than any other thing to do with the\r\ndiscouragement that made him seize the pretext of his white flag in\r\norder to renounce his pretensions to the throne of his ancestors. A good\r\nmany years later, talking about Marshal MacMahon at Frohsdorf, he told\r\nme that “C’est un imbécile, et ce qui est pire, c’est un ambitieux, qui\r\nne veut pas se l’avouer, et qui cherche à dissimuler ce sentiment sous\r\nle grand mot de son honneur” (“He is an imbecile, and what is worse, he\r\nhas ambition, which he doesn’t want to own, and tries to hide under\r\nthose great words, ‘his honour’”).\r\n\r\nI don’t think anyone ever made a more scathing and more true\r\nappreciation of the character of the Marshal than the last descendant of\r\nthe Bourbons when he voiced that judgment.\r\n\r\nOnce the possibility of a monarchical restoration was put aside, and\r\nespecially after the Prince Imperial had fallen in Zululand, by which\r\nthe Bonapartists were reduced to impotence, it seemed as if the Republic\r\nwas to be the only possible government in France.\r\n\r\nI was in Paris when the heir of the Napoleons ended his short existence\r\nso gloriously and so tragically, and I do not think that I heard one\r\nsingle person doubt that this Republican regime was certain to last.\r\n\r\nUntil then great hopes had existed, even among the former enemies of the\r\nEmpire, that the young Prince would be able, by one of those freaks of\r\npolitical life which occur so often in the existence of nations, to step\r\nonce more upon the throne from which his father had been overthrown. He\r\nwas supposed to possess courage, cleverness, great steadfastness of\r\ncharacter, strong principles, and an ardent love for his country. That\r\nalone constituted certain guarantees for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Orleanists knew very well that until the country had altogether\r\nforgotten the incident of their claiming back their confiscated millions\r\nat a moment when the country was smarting under the unparalleled\r\ndisaster of 1870, they had no chance of being called back to power. The\r\nComte de Chambord had made himself impossible; the Republic was\r\nacceptable to but very few; the Prince Imperial had therefore the\r\npossibility if not the probability of returning to France as its\r\nEmperor, and this solution was wished for even by people who, before the\r\nwar and the changes which it had brought about, would have recoiled with\r\nhorror at the idea of being thought supporters of the Bonapartes. But\r\nwhen fate intervened, and the tragedy which was enacted in Africa put an\r\nend to all hopes and calculations that had been made, it became evident\r\nthat the country must resign itself to a Republican government. And I am\r\npersuaded that apart from the ardent Monarchists, who fought for a\r\nprinciple more than for a dynasty, every reasonable person in France\r\nthought so.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation rested on the fact that in the opinion of many, the\r\nRepublic ought to be essentially Conservative, whilst in that of others,\r\nwho were gradually to increase in number, its first duty was to show\r\nitself distinctly Radical, and determined to follow the glorious\r\nprinciples, as they were qualified, of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Magenta, who found himself in a certain sense called upon to\r\ndecide between these two currents, did not very well know what to do.\r\nHis own leanings were distinctly Conservative, and he was no admirer of\r\nthe Radical programme, scarcely even of the moderate Republican one.\r\nNevertheless he imagined that he could have the necessary authority to\r\nappoint ministers of moderate views. There were still men of great\r\nvalour in their midst, like M. Buffet and M. Dufaure, not to speak of\r\nthe Duc d’Audiffret Pasquier, who had made a name for himself by his\r\nfamous speech against Napoleon III. in the first National Assembly, nor\r\nof the Duc de Broglie, to whose help the Marshal was to have recourse\r\nlater on. There were soldiers like General Changarnier and General\r\nChanzy, who had fought so valiantly whilst in command of that army of\r\nthe Loire which had made the last effort to free France from the\r\nvictorious Prussians; politicians like M. Ribot, whose austerity and\r\nloyalty of principles have never to this day been doubted. There were\r\nalso, even in the ranks of the Left, men like Leon Say, whose presence\r\nin a ministry was in itself a guarantee that it would never yield to the\r\ndemands of the extreme Socialists, or like Gambetta, who, whatever can\r\nbe said against him, was a great patriot, incapable of imperilling the\r\nexistence of his country by an alliance with anarchism. Any man blessed\r\nwith the slightest common sense, and possessed of frankness in his\r\ndealings with his colleagues, which unfortunately for him Marshal\r\nMacMahon never showed, might have consolidated the Republic by making\r\nuse of these various elements. He was unable to do so, however, and went\r\non from blunder to blunder, from concession to concession, reminding one\r\nof no one so much as Louis XVI., who also accepted everything and\r\nreconciled himself to nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the vote of the Chamber had made Jules Simon President of the\r\nCabinet, Marshal MacMahon might easily have found in him an ally and a\r\nsupporter in his wish to establish the Republic upon bases which would\r\nhave strengthened the position of France in the eyes of Europe.\r\n\r\nJules Simon was a man of high principles, unsullied honour, a thinker, a\r\nwriter, a philosopher, of austere life and strong convictions--one who\r\nwas not guilty of meanness nor permitted himself anything base. He was a\r\nstaunch Republican, a sincere Liberal, a true follower of whatever was\r\ngood and great in the Revolution of 1789; he abhorred excesses and\r\nextravagances, no matter in what shape or under what colours they\r\npresented themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen he became Prime Minister he tried earnestly and sincerely, as his\r\nduty, to convert the President of the Republic to his views. These he\r\nwas convinced would conciliate the different parties that divided the\r\nChamber of Deputies, as well as the Senate, and if he had found the help\r\nhe sought from the Head of the State, it is probable that the whole tide\r\nof events in France would have taken a different turn. But that help\r\nfailed him, and after having on the 15th of May parted from Marshal\r\nMacMahon on the best of terms, and received from him the assurance that\r\nhe would do his best to co-operate with him in the direction which he\r\nwanted to give to the government of the country, Jules Simon was\r\nstartled by receiving the next morning the famous letter from the\r\nPresident of the Republic, refusing to lend himself to his plans. He\r\nreplied by handing in his resignation.\r\n\r\nIt is to the honour of Jules Simon that whenever he discussed the event\r\nin later years he always refused to accuse the Duc de Magenta of\r\nduplicity, as many in his place would have done. When the electoral\r\ncampaign began, he, of course, took an important part in it, but even\r\nthen his attitude in regard to the Marshal was most correct, and he\r\nnever allowed himself to say a word that might have been construed in\r\nthe light of personal animosity. He was a real philosopher, and a\r\npolitical man to whom no suspicion had ever been attached. In France\r\nsuch are rare, and the example he gave must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal called to his help men belonging to the Extreme Right, such\r\nas the Duc de Broglie and M. de Fourtoul. He could hardly have done\r\nanything else, because it is not likely that even a moderate Republican\r\nwould have cared to risk the unpopularity that was bound to follow all\r\nthose who had taken part in this mad venture. They accepted office only\r\nbecause they imagined that by dissolving the Chambers the elections\r\nmight give them a majority which would have called back the Orleans to\r\nthe throne and restored the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nPeople who knew the Duc de Broglie well affirm that he put the condition\r\nquite clearly to the Duc de Magenta, and told him that he would enter\r\nthe ministry only if he were given a free hand as regards the future in\r\ncase the country supported him by sending his followers to represent it\r\nin the new Chamber.\r\n\r\nWhether this is true or not I have not had the means of discovering, but\r\nlong after the death of Marshal MacMahon, his widow one day allowed a\r\nword to escape her which might have been taken as a tacit acknowledgment\r\nof the fact. She was conversing with a friend about the events that had\r\naccompanied and followed the _coup d’état_ of the 16th of May, and\r\nreplying to a remark that friend made to the effect that very probably\r\nhad it succeeded the Duc de Magenta would have remained President of the\r\nRepublic until his death, she exclaimed: “Oh no, my dear, the 16th of\r\nMay, even if it had been successful, would not have kept us at the\r\nElysée.”\r\n\r\nHad MacMahon possessed a scrap of dignity he would have resigned after\r\nthe country had pronounced itself against him, and the obstinacy with\r\nwhich he clung to his place after his defeat is one of the most\r\nextraordinary happenings in the history of modern France. I have often\r\nwondered, and have not been the only one to do so, what he had hoped to\r\ngain by staying discredited and despised at a post which could hardly\r\nhave been a bed of roses. Duty had nothing to do with it. It might have\r\nbeen his duty to listen to Jules Simon, at least his constitutional\r\nduty; it certainly was not to his advantage that after having\r\nignominiously failed in carrying through his attempt to create a\r\nMonarchical Republic, he remained the head of a Radical one.\r\n\r\nGambetta, whose verdict was nearly always right and just, when he\r\ntroubled to utter it seriously respecting men and things, once defined\r\nthe Marshal, and did so perhaps even better than the Comte de Chambord\r\nhad done. When asked to what motive he attributed his having remained at\r\nhis post “envers et contre tous,” he replied simply: “Il est resté,\r\nparce qu’il n’a pas compris qu’il devait s’en aller” (“He remained\r\nbecause he did not understand that he ought to go”).\r\n\r\nBut when the Senatorial elections took place, and sent to the Upper\r\nChamber the same majority that already existed in the Lower Chamber,\r\neven an intelligence as obtuse as that of Marshal MacMahon understood\r\nthat he had better leave to others the task of governing the Republic.\r\nHe retired much too late for his personal dignity, and with him the last\r\nhopes of a Conservative Republic disappeared for ever. After some\r\ndiscussions, M. Jules Grévy was elected his successor. Some other names\r\nhad been put forward, amongst them M. de Freycinet. M. Jules Ferry was\r\nalso mentioned, who was to go down to posterity as the author, later, of\r\nthat famous Article 7, which was so strongly opposed by the clergy and\r\nall the parties in the Chamber, with the exception of the Radical and\r\nextreme Republican parties. He was certainly a statesman of broad views.\r\nMoreover he was honest and sincere, and his personality was highly\r\nrespected; but he did not care to become an automaton as was desirable\r\nin a President of a constitutional Republic. On the other hand, he was\r\nso intensely disliked by all those whom he had contrived to wound by\r\nhis political attitude that he was very soon eliminated from the list.\r\nAs for M. de Freycinet, a clever, quiet, resolute individual, his\r\nopponents dreaded his great abilities, and perhaps also the subtlety of\r\nhis reasonings. He had just enough friends to praise and to propose him,\r\nbut not a sufficient number to ensure his election. After a few hours’\r\ndiscussion the general choice fell on M. Jules Grévy as Chief Magistrate\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nM. Grévy was an advocate of Besançon, who had signally distinguished\r\nhimself by more or less violent attacks against the Empire. He was not a\r\nbrilliant man, but one gifted with strong common sense, an orator of no\r\nmean value, but whose eloquence was cold and quiet, like his whole\r\ncharacter. He disdained to appeal to the passions of the crowd. He had\r\nthe reputation of being an honest man in the full sense of the word, one\r\nwho would never have consented to any indelicacy, and who represented\r\nthe perfect type of the French bourgeois of the time of Louis Philippe,\r\nwhen the lust for luxury and the hunt after notoriety had not yet\r\ninvaded public life.\r\n\r\nWhen the first National Assembly gathered together at Bordeaux after the\r\nwar, he was unanimously elected President, and in the delicate functions\r\nof that position he showed great dignity, singular impartiality, and\r\nfirmness combined with extreme politeness. His task was excessively\r\ndifficult, and no one did anything to lighten it, so that, after an\r\nincident of a personal nature by which he thought himself wounded, he\r\nsent in his resignation. It was accepted with alacrity by the Right,\r\nwhich feared that he would be an obstacle to its plans and intentions,\r\nand which, dreaming already of the fall of M. Thiers, was desirous of\r\nhaving a President after its own heart, which it found in M. Buffet, the\r\nirreconcilable enemy of Grévy.\r\n\r\nBut when Marshal MacMahon had at last made up his mind to retire, and\r\nwhen the various candidates had been eliminated for one reason or\r\nanother, the name of M. Jules Grévy immediately met with sympathy, and\r\nhe was elected by common consent. He made a good chief of a Democratic\r\nState--dignified, calm, gifted with tact, and animated by the most\r\nsincere desire to govern according to the wishes of the majority that\r\nhad elected him. He brought with him to the Elysée the manners of the\r\nbourgeoisie to which he belonged, proved hostile to everything that\r\nsavoured of ostentation and luxury, and went on living the same life he\r\nhad led at Besançon, when, as a young advocate, he had had to fight his\r\nway in the world. Madame Grévy was also an excellent woman, a good\r\nmother and an exemplary wife, who mended her husband’s socks and never\r\nattempted to meddle in matters that did not concern her. Under her rule\r\nfestivities were but rare at the Elysée, but charity was practised on a\r\nlarge scale. M. Grévy did not show himself the nonentity he was later on\r\nrepresented to be, and several of his ministers, with whom I had an\r\nopportunity of discussing the President, told me that his advice always\r\nproved most valuable to them, and that, whenever serious matters came to\r\nthe front, his strong common sense and clear judgment generally found\r\nthe best way to put an end to the difficulties which had arisen. He was\r\nnot a genius, but he had statesmanlike views, and these, more than once,\r\nproved useful to France.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, M. Grévy survived himself, politically speaking. Had he\r\nretired at the end of his first seven years he would have been\r\nremembered with gratitude by his country as well as by his family. But\r\nseveral untoward events and scandals gave a sad celebrity to his term of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nOne was the affair of the Union Générale; the first and the last\r\nattempt of French aristocracy to meddle with finance. Since that time it\r\nhas grown wiser, and has had nothing more to do with banks, except\r\nmarrying bankers’ daughters. But under the Presidency of M. Grévy it\r\nhoped to make up for its defeat in the field of politics by securing a\r\ngreat triumph in the field of finance. In M. Bontoux it thought it had\r\nfound the man capable of retrieving its fallen fortunes, and almost all\r\nthe proudest names of France co-operated in the enterprise which he\r\nstarted, and which he fondly hoped would rival the power of the\r\nRothschilds and of Jewish finance in general. For some little time\r\neverything went well, and the shares of the Union Générale rose out of\r\nall proportion. Then one fine day the end came suddenly and crushingly,\r\nM. Bontoux was imprisoned, and all the numerous enterprises of which he\r\nhad been the promoter suffered disaster.\r\n\r\nLater on somehow, in other hands, the venture proved prosperous, and his\r\ncreditors recovered something like ninety per cent. of their money. But\r\nat the moment that the catastrophe occurred half France was ruined by\r\nit, and as of course the Jews were accused of having brought it about, I\r\nthink I am not much mistaken in saying that it is from that period that\r\nanti-Semitism began to flourish in the country, and that people like\r\nDrumont became popular.\r\n\r\nThe crash of the Union Générale and the Panama scandal, which began to\r\nooze out among the public, would have been enough to throw a shadow on\r\nthe Presidency of M. Grévy, but the drama which closed it stamped it\r\nwith a shame that he himself did not deserve, and which, whatever has\r\nbeen said about it by his enemies, he felt acutely.\r\n\r\nAs everybody knows, Mademoiselle Grévy, the President’s only daughter,\r\nhad married Daniel Wilson, the son of a very rich sugar refiner, who in\r\nthe merry days of the Empire had formed part of that _jeunesse dorée_,\r\nwhom the Café Anglais still remembers. He had grown bald, and he had\r\nbecome poorer since those halcyon days; but he had a sister, Madame\r\nPelouze, the owner of the lovely château of Chenonceaux, in the valley\r\nof the Loire, who had considerable influence over him, and who imagined\r\nthat by arranging a marriage between him and the daughter of the\r\nPresident of the Republic he would retrieve his fallen fortunes. Daniel\r\nWilson listened to her, and soon found himself installed at the Elysée.\r\n\r\nOnce there, the rest was easy for a man of his intelligence, and this is\r\na quality that his most bitter adversaries concede to him. He soon\r\nacquired unbounded influence on the mind of his father-in-law, and M.\r\nGrévy, grown old and perhaps even lazy, was very glad to find in his\r\nson-in-law a person capable of helping him and of bringing to his notice\r\nmany things which he might perhaps have otherwise forgotten, as well as\r\nto give him good advice when he needed it. Very soon M. Wilson became a\r\npolitical power, and this brought him many friends, even more\r\nflatterers, and a host of demands. At first he was careful, then he grew\r\nbolder, at last he quite forgot that he was at the mercy of the least\r\nindiscretion, and finally, when it became known that he had accepted\r\nmonetary considerations in return for promotions in the Order of the\r\nLegion of Honour, the scandal became so immense that poor M. Grévy, who\r\nhad known nothing at all about it, was peremptorily asked to resign his\r\nfunctions as Head of the State.\r\n\r\nTo those who read of this now, the whole affair cannot but appear\r\nstrange, especially if they have followed the course of events in France\r\nsince that day, and they can but wonder at the sensitiveness of public\r\nfeeling then. To-day, when almost everything from the great Cross of the\r\nLegion of Honour down to a modest _bureau de tabac_ is to be had for\r\nmoney in France--and quite recently rumour spreads to the other side of\r\nthe channel--one can only grieve for poor M. Grévy that he had been born\r\ntoo soon, and had not become President of the Republic some fifteen\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nIn the scandal that accompanied his fall the real services which he had\r\nrendered to the State, and his sincere attempts to restrain the great\r\ndevelopment of Radicalism in the country, were quite forgotten. He had\r\nbeen weak in many things, blind in some others, but he had always been\r\nhonest, even when his son-in-law was doing questionable things in his\r\nname. And certainly at the time of the Schnaebele incident it had only\r\nbeen by his intervention and his wisdom that a war with Germany had been\r\navoided. He had, in that dangerous moment, shown both dignity and\r\nfirmness, and succeeded in settling with honour difficulties which but\r\nfor him might have led to the most serious consequences. France, when\r\nthinking of him or talking about him, should never forget this.\r\n\r\nWhen he resigned, there was again a question raised as to who should be\r\nasked to become his successor, and the name of Jules Ferry was once more\r\nput forward. But Jules Ferry was considered as far too Conservative by\r\nthe Paris Municipal Council, which sent delegates to the National\r\nAssembly to warn it that, should he be chosen, the population of the\r\nfaubourgs would come down to Versailles in order to signify its veto. To\r\ntell the truth, Ferry’s energy was feared, and it was dreaded that he\r\nwould prove himself a master rather than a President. M. de Freycinet\r\nwas out of the question, when suddenly M. Carnot’s candidature was put\r\nforward by M. Clemenceau, who was beginning already to assume the\r\nleadership of the Radical party, and to make himself respected by all\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Sadi Carnot was Minister of Finance. He had quite\r\nrecently been the object of an ovation in the Chamber of Deputies when\r\nhe had refused to exonerate M. Wilson from the payment of certain taxes\r\nwhich he owed to the State, and from which he had attempted to escape,\r\nthanks to his relationship with President Grévy. Carnot was the\r\npersonification of that caste which is called in all the old memoirs of\r\nthe eighteenth century, “les grands bourgeois de Paris.” His past career\r\nhad been irreproachable, he had perhaps few friends, not being at all\r\npliant, but he had a remarkable absence of enemies. His personal\r\nappearance was grave and solemn, not to say dull; he did not speak much,\r\nand his manners were always cold and distant. He made an excellent\r\nPresident, and had he not come to such a tragic end, it is probable that\r\nno one would ever have given him a thought after he had left office.\r\n\r\nWhen he was murdered the Radical party had already secured a very large\r\nmajority in the Chamber as well as in the Senate, and all thoughts as to\r\nthe possibility of a Republic governed according to Conservative\r\nprinciples had long ago vanished. For a few brief months his successor,\r\nCasimir Périer, tried to fight against the tide of anarchism which was\r\nslowly rising, but after him no one attempted it, and the Republic fell\r\nentirely into the hands of M. Clemenceau and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nLEON GAMBETTA\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout being an intimate friend of Leon Gambetta, I used nevertheless\r\nto see him very often, and there existed between us one of those close\r\nrelationships which sometimes draw together people whose opinions are\r\ntotally different. I had first met him before the war, when he had not\r\nreached the fame which ultimately became his. I admired him more than I\r\nliked him, and to tell the truth he never was fully in sympathy with me,\r\nbut it was impossible to see him often and not to be struck by his\r\nimmense intelligence, and especially by the extraordinary powers of\r\nassimilation which distinguished him.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that at the beginning of his political career\r\nhe had little idea of social requirements, yet as soon as he found out\r\nhis mistake he speedily made it his aim to acquire knowledge of the\r\ncustoms and manners current in the higher classes of society, and to\r\nmake a special study of its code of etiquette. He realised quite well\r\nthat sometimes trivial details bring about tremendous results, and that\r\nif a man wants to lead his country he must not begin by giving the\r\npublic occasion to ridicule him. Besides, there lay at the bottom of the\r\ncharacter of this extraordinary man a thirst for luxury, for power, for\r\nriches, for all the good things of the world, which alone would have\r\nbeen sufficient to make him study the refinements without which they\r\nbecome useless. Gambetta was an epicure in the fullest sense of that\r\nword, and the apparent carelessness which he had affected in outward\r\nappearance when he entered political life proceeded more from the desire\r\nto attract notice to himself than from anything else.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to impose his personality upon others, and not knowing how to\r\ndo so, he tried to attain it by an apparent indifference to those\r\noutward things that rule the actions of ordinary men.\r\n\r\nWhen once he was thrown into contact with good society, and especially\r\nafter he had fallen under the influence of Madame Edmond Adam, or\r\nJuliette Adam as earlier I referred to her, his views of life changed\r\nconsiderably. He very soon became more refined in his tastes and habits,\r\nthe equal in social deportment of those men and women whose judgments\r\nand opinions he had affected to despise in the days when he was a street\r\norator who frequented the Café Procope and other meeting-places of the\r\nyoung Radical party who made it its business to attack the Empire at\r\nevery opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe war sobered him, and his short sojourn in the responsible position\r\nof member of a government, such as it was, considerably changed his\r\nideas. He at once perceived that it was easier to criticise men in power\r\nthan to do their work. He was a great patriot in the sense that he put\r\nhis country before anything else in the world, and that he was ready to\r\nsacrifice all that he held dear for its welfare, but he was no\r\nchauvinist, though so often accused of fomenting chauvinism in France.\r\nHe had a very clear comprehension of every political situation, and also\r\nof the different ways in which it could be explained to the crowd, who\r\ngenerally see only the externals of questions without ever going into\r\ntheir details.\r\n\r\nHe wanted his country to regain its former power and fame, and he knew\r\nthat this would be difficult if the idea of the humiliation it had\r\nendured was always put before its eyes, and if the wounds it had\r\nreceived were always made to smart. In a certain sense he was right, in\r\nanother he was wrong, because France might have been more quiet now, and\r\nmore prosperous even in the material sense of the word, if that idea of\r\na _revanche_ had not always been fostered, and had she been taught to\r\nreconcile herself to accomplished facts. In saying this I know that many\r\namong my readers will scream outright, but not being a Frenchman I may\r\nbe allowed to express my opinion, that it would be to the advantage of a\r\ncountry for which I have always had the greatest sympathy if she began\r\nthinking more about herself and less about another war with Germany.\r\n\r\nGambetta exercised an unbounded influence on many people, and was the\r\nobject of hatred to many others, but no one who met him could pass him\r\nby with indifference. If he had not been of a lazy disposition he might\r\neasily have become Prime Minister long before he did, and in this\r\nconnection I must relate a story which probably will surprise more than\r\none person. Gambetta, though he led his party, and though he was at one\r\nmoment the most powerful man in France, showed always some reluctance\r\nwhen the question of his forming a government was raised. I ventured one\r\nday to ask him why. He replied to me that, now he understood the\r\nresponsibility of the head of a Cabinet, and had studied European\r\npolitics, he did not think himself up to the task, and also did not\r\nthink that his presence in a ministry would be to the advantage of\r\nFrance, because his name had become synonymous with the principle of a\r\nwar with Germany, for which he was but too well aware that his country\r\nwas not prepared. “Later on,” he added, “my day may come, but I feel\r\nthat now, though I may have a great deal more intelligence than some of\r\nthe foreign ministers who lead the destinies of other countries, I\r\nhaven’t their experience of affairs, nor their perfect knowledge of\r\nsaying pretty things which they do not mean. This would make me appear\r\ninferior to them, and France must not be represented by a man to whom\r\nthis reproach applies. France must hold her own, and something more, in\r\nthe presence of Europe.”\r\n\r\nI made a gesture of surprise, which he noticed.\r\n\r\n“You are astonished at what I tell you,” he remarked, “but do you think\r\nme such a poor patriot to put my own personal advantage or ambitions\r\nbefore her welfare? This would be very miserable indeed, and I know of\r\nno meaner thing than accepting office when one is aware that it is not\r\nfor the good of one’s fatherland. I know very well what is thought about\r\nme in Europe, and especially in Germany, and I do not wish to give the\r\nlatter country the slightest excuse to say that she has been provoked,\r\nor that we are following a policy of aggression. Such policy is unworthy\r\nof a great nation, and we are a great nation, in spite of our reverses,\r\nand we must remain one, though some people would like us to come down\r\nfrom that height. We must work to consolidate our position, to become\r\npowerful enough and strong enough to be able to strike when the day\r\ncomes, not only with the chance, but with the certitude, of success.\r\nWhat is the good of wasting one’s time in petty strifes or petty\r\nrecriminations? Yes, I think about revenge, I think of nothing else, but\r\nI should be ashamed to be thought eager for it at once, and at any\r\nprice; above all I would not like to risk losing it by such a miserable\r\ncircumstance as my becoming head of the government at a time when the\r\nhour for it had not yet struck.”\r\n\r\nI relate this conversation in its entirety as it shows the real\r\npatriotism which animated Gambetta, as well as his great foresight and\r\nintuition in politics in general. Very few statesmen would have viewed\r\na situation with such entire self-abnegation. In France especially,\r\nwhere the thirst after power and official positions was so great, he\r\nconstituted a solitary and noble exception. I think that the happiest\r\ntime in Gambetta’s life was when he was President of the Chamber, and\r\ninhabited the Palais Bourbon. There he felt in his element, and also at\r\nthe height, not of his ambitions, but of his wishes--a totally different\r\nmatter. In the old home of the Duc de Morny he did not consider himself\r\ninferior to that clever councillor of Napoleon III., and reflected with\r\nsome satisfaction on the circumstances that had brought him there, and\r\nplaced him in the chair occupied with such authority by the illegitimate\r\nson of Queen Hortense. In his new position also he could give way to the\r\nluxurious tastes which he had always nursed and only appeared to scorn,\r\nbecause he had not been able to believe he would ever be in a position\r\nto gratify them.\r\n\r\nLeon Gambetta also felt that in the capacity of leader of the\r\nrepresentatives of the nation he would have more opportunities of\r\nlearning the real wants of that nation, and thus, when the day came that\r\nhe could do so, would be able to work for its welfare with better\r\nchances of success than he had had hitherto. His rare tact served him\r\nwell, and his knowledge of mankind, something quite different from\r\nknowledge of the world, made him avoid many of the mistakes another\r\nplaced in his position would inevitably have fallen victim to. He made\r\nan excellent President of the Chamber, just as he made an admirable host\r\nin the Palais Bourbon, where he displayed his epicurean tastes in a way\r\nthat drew upon him the censure of the newspapers, which tried to\r\nridicule the former Socialist leader, whose first care had been to get\r\nas his cook the most famous chef in Paris.\r\n\r\nMadame Adam used sometimes to smile at the change which her influence,\r\nmore than anything else, had brought about in Gambetta. But when he\r\nbecame President of the Chamber their intimacy slackened, for a very\r\nshort time it is true, but slackened all the same. Gambetta, it must be\r\nowned, was very sensible to feminine charms and feminine blandishments.\r\nStrange as it may seem when one takes into consideration his extreme\r\nugliness, the fact that he had but one eye, and was enormously fat, he\r\nyet exercised a great fascination on women in general, and he liked to\r\nuse it, and to spend part of his spare time in the society of the fair\r\nladies who worshipped at his shrine. This partly was the cause of his\r\ndeath. But about this we shall speak later on.\r\n\r\nWhen at last circumstances arose which obliged Gambetta to accept the\r\ntask of forming a Cabinet, it was with the utmost reluctance, in spite\r\nof all that has been said concerning this subject, that he undertook it.\r\nHe had no faith in the possibility of being a long time at the head of\r\naffairs, and as he told one of his friends: “Why take such trouble when\r\none is assured beforehand it is for nothing?” Nevertheless he started\r\nearnestly to work to give to the government the direction he thought the\r\nbest for the interests of the country. But the composition of the\r\nChambers was not congenial to him; he felt himself far superior to all\r\nthose men upon the vote of whom his fate depended, and this made him\r\nimpatient as to the control which they pretended to exercise over him.\r\nHe despised them, if the truth must be said, and involuntarily he\r\nallowed this feeling to appear in the manner in which he handled them, a\r\nfact that had much to do with the short time he remained in power.\r\n\r\nHis advent as Prime Minister had excited considerable sensation abroad;\r\neven in France it was the signal for the retirement from public life of\r\nmany people who felt that they could not remain in office under such a\r\nthoroughly Radical government as the one he was supposed to lead. Among\r\nthose who resigned was the Comte de St. Vallier, at that time French\r\nAmbassador in Berlin.\r\n\r\nWhen his resignation was accepted he thought himself obliged,\r\nnevertheless, to call on the Prime Minister when he returned to Paris,\r\nin order to express to him his regrets that the opinions which he held\r\nprevented him from working harmoniously with him. Gambetta received him\r\nwith great affability and courteousness, and at once said: “You are\r\nwrong to go away, I shall not remain for long where I am now, and you\r\nwould have rendered a greater service to France by remaining at your\r\npost than by a retreat which, as you will see, will prove to have been\r\nuseless. Je ne suis qu’un bouche-trou (‘I am only a stop-gap’), and very\r\nprobably the President of the Republic in entrusting to me the task of\r\nforming a government wanted to prove to France how impossible it is for\r\na Radical ministry ever to maintain itself. The sad part of this is\r\nthat, though I am a Republican, I have no Radical sympathies. I assure\r\nyou that this is the fact, and that you would have found me far more\r\ninclined to sympathise with your opinions than with those of the people\r\nwho are supposed to be my followers. The great mistake that we are\r\nconstantly making in France is to mix up opinions with the way in which\r\nthe country must be governed. We ought to have neither a Conservative,\r\nnor a Radical, nor even a Republican government; we ought to have a\r\nFrench one. This would be quite enough. I am sorry you have resigned;\r\nvery sorry, indeed.”\r\n\r\nBut Gambetta did not convince M. de St. Vallier, and he insisted on\r\nretiring from the diplomatic service, a fact which I have reasons to\r\nbelieve he regretted later on.\r\n\r\nThe great dream of Gambetta was to establish a _modus vivendi_ and a\r\nkind of understanding with Germany. He knew very well how useless it is\r\nin life to go back on things which are already accomplished, and to cry\r\nover spilt milk. And he did not care for France to go on living in the\r\nstate of _qui vive_ which had been hers ever since the disasters which\r\nhad accompanied the war of 1870. He knew also that he had far greater\r\nchances to take into his hands the reins of government, and to keep them\r\nif once he had succeeded in doing away with this fear of a German\r\naggression, which haunted the public mind. He was no partisan of\r\ncompulsory service, and did not approve of too great military expenses,\r\nentered into by fear of an imaginary danger. That it was imaginary he\r\nwas convinced, because he knew very well that Germany was in the same\r\nposition in which Napoleon III. had found himself: that of risking the\r\nloss of everything and gaining nothing from a new campaign. But this\r\nconviction which was his alone he could not persuade others to share,\r\nand for this reason he tried to arrange an interview between himself and\r\nPrince von Bismarck.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been written about this episode, and several of\r\nGambetta’s friends have done their best to try to induce the public to\r\nforget it. I don’t know why they believed that it was not to his honour.\r\nNor why, either, Gambetta could not have met the German Chancellor when\r\nother French political men had done so without anyone saying a single\r\nword against it. By every sensible person the idea of this interview\r\ncould only have been hailed with pleasure. Two great minds like those\r\ncould not but have found together the solution of many difficulties\r\nwhich divided the two nations, and it would have been doing the greatest\r\ninjustice to Leon Gambetta to imagine that he would not have borne\r\nhimself with the dignity necessary to the representative of a great\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was Count Henckel von Donnersmarck, the husband of Madame de Paiva,\r\nwhose fame still lives in Paris, who was sounded by Gambetta as to the\r\npossibility of a meeting between himself and Bismarck, and he did his\r\nvery best to arrange it in such a manner that it might not become known\r\nto the public, at least not until after it had actually taken place.\r\nUnfortunately outward circumstances interfered with this plan, and\r\nGambetta had to forgo his intention, partly because his great friend\r\nRanc told him that if he ventured on such a thing he would entirely lose\r\nthe confidence of the Radical party. Whether it was this consideration\r\nor another one, the fact remains that he felt afraid at the last minute,\r\nin view of the hostility of his constituents, to incur the\r\nresponsibility of a step which his intelligence and his intuition told\r\nhim was the best for the interests of the France he loved so dearly.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written, and much surmised, concerning the death of\r\nGambetta. It is now pretty certain that the wound which he received was\r\nnot its immediate cause, which must be looked for elsewhere, and can be\r\nattributed partly to his general constitution, which was considerably\r\nimpaired, and partly to the treatment which had been applied to him. But\r\nupon this point it must not be forgotten that at that time operations\r\nwere not the usual thing that they have become since, and surgical\r\nintervention was generally dreaded, and resorted to only as a last\r\nresource.\r\n\r\nAs to the pistol shot, about which so many suppositions have been made,\r\nI think that in spite of Gambetta’s own denials there can be hardly a\r\nmatter of doubt that it was a lady who, in a fit of fury, had inflicted\r\nthe wound that disabled him. It is no secret now, that Gambetta was on\r\nthe point of marrying a lady of high social standing, the Marchioness\r\nArconati-Visconti, the daughter of the Senator Peyrat, and the widow of\r\na Milanese nobleman. That union was to put the seal to his career, and\r\nto open for him many new vistas. As the husband of a beautiful,\r\naccomplished woman of the world, he could in time aspire to anything\r\nand, who knows, become President of the Republic for life, which was his\r\ndearest secret wish.\r\n\r\nBut in order to accomplish his desire, he had first to end a situation\r\nthat did not date from yesterday, to cut off an intimacy of twenty years\r\nwith a noble woman who had been his friend in the bad as well as in the\r\ngood days, and who had given him innumerable proofs of her devotion.\r\nGambetta was well aware of the difficulties which such a step presented,\r\nand for a long time he had not the courage to tackle the subject, hoping\r\nthat she would hear something about his new plans, and herself begin the\r\nconversation on this delicate matter. The lady, however, kept silent,\r\nperhaps because she did not believe in the rumours which had reached\r\nher, and partly because she would not give her friend the opportunity he\r\nwas seeking. At last Gambetta asked his old comrade Spuller to see her\r\nand to try to persuade her to have the courage to sacrifice herself to\r\nhis welfare. He reasoned like a man, and an ungrateful man into the\r\nbargain, and she refused to accept the solution which was offered to\r\nher, and which might have soothed the pride of a person more devoid of\r\nfeelings of attachment for her lover of long years than was the case\r\nwith her. She dismissed Spuller with scorn, and rushed to Ville d’Avray,\r\nwhere Gambetta was residing, in order to seek an interview that could\r\nonly be a stormy one.\r\n\r\nIt was during this interview that Gambetta was wounded. And those who\r\nwere made aware of all the circumstances attending this drama of\r\nfeminine jealousy, knew who it was that fired the fatal shot which\r\nlodged itself in the right hand of the French statesman. When he himself\r\nwas questioned as to the accident, he always said that he had wounded\r\nhimself in trying to clean a revolver, a circumstance that was the more\r\nunlikely because he was seldom in possession of such a weapon. Moreover,\r\nto some of his friends, like Spuller and Paul Bert, he only remarked\r\nthat he had got nothing but what he had deserved.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this consciousness which made him so patient during his\r\nillness, and also so shy of seeing anyone, even his friends, whilst it\r\nlasted. He used to lie quietly, with closed eyes, and avoid any\r\nconversations that could have touched upon the subject of the accident\r\nwhich had occurred to him. And when later on other symptoms made their\r\nappearance, he begged the people who surrounded him to say everywhere\r\nthat these symptoms had nothing to do with his wound.\r\n\r\nIf, in his dying moments, he was conscious, he must have regretted\r\ndeeply his ingratitude in regard to the woman who had loved him with\r\nsuch true affection, and who had been tempted to an act of despair when\r\nshe learned that she was about to be forsaken for one who certainly did\r\nnot have for Gambetta the same passionate affection. It was after all\r\nthe sweet lady who had for so long had him in her affections who watched\r\nover his deathbed, and who closed his eyes for ever, whilst the proud\r\nlady for whose sake he had been about to sacrifice her never even made\r\nan appearance at Ville d’Avray. She went on living her former life as if\r\nno tragedy had crossed it, after death had removed from this worldly\r\nscene the great politician to whom ambition had very nearly united her.\r\n\r\nAnd now that years have passed over this drama, since the removal from\r\nthe scene of political France of the great patriot who was called Leon\r\nGambetta, it is still very difficult to form a true judgment about him.\r\nHe died before he had given the full measure of his qualities, or shown\r\nthe real stuff he was made of. He was for too short a time in a\r\nresponsible position to allow us to say whether he would have proved as\r\nable a leader of a government as he had shown himself to be a powerful\r\nleader of men. The two things are very different, and the man who can\r\nmaster one is found sometimes to be lacking in the other. What, however,\r\ncannot be taken away from him is his true, earnest patriotism, the\r\nabsence of all vanity that distinguished him, his readiness to sacrifice\r\neverything in his power at the shrine of his fatherland, and his desire\r\nto serve it, according to what he considered to be its interests. He was\r\nfearless in his devotion, and worked for his country without paying any\r\nattention to the reproaches of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe man was colossal in his way, and there was nothing mean about him.\r\nHis conceptions were as great as his soul. Of course he was often\r\nmistaken, like every human being, but he was always sincere even in his\r\nerrors, and he never hesitated to acknowledge the latter when they were\r\nshown to him.\r\n\r\nReared in different circumstances, and able to show his value otherwise\r\nthan by starting on the road of revolution, which bordered very closely\r\non anarchy, he might have become truly a great man. He had all the\r\ninstincts of one--and all the imperfections. He was authoritative and\r\ncould be very firm, but he tried always to be just, and avoided wounding\r\nothers, even his adversaries, as much as it was possible for him to do\r\nso. He was invariably courteous, even in his exhibitions of rage, and\r\nessentially kind, a faithful friend, and a gallant enemy. Hated by those\r\nwho had never known him, or met him personally, he contrived to\r\nfascinate all those who had done so; they always went away from him\r\nliking the man, even when condemning the politician. He had a careless\r\nmanner in talking about his foes, which was superb in its way, and\r\nthough he seldom spoke about himself, yet he liked to find that he was\r\nrespected, feared, or even abused.\r\n\r\nThe one thing he never could have reconciled himself to would have been\r\nto be ignored, and this indignity was spared him. Perhaps it was better\r\nfor his memory that he died in the full force of his talent, and before\r\nhe had reached the maturity of his years--perhaps it was a pity. Who\r\nknows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF GENERAL BOULANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious episodes in the life of the Third Republic was\r\ncertainly the adventure of General Boulanger, with all its attendant\r\ncircumstances, many of which have not yet seen the light of day. It\r\nillustrates the taste of the Frenchman for what is vulgarly called, in\r\nthe _argot_ of the boulevards, “le panache.”\r\n\r\nThe “Brave Général,” to give him the name used in the romances sung by\r\nPaulus, was anything but a superior being. I doubt if he was a\r\nstrikingly intelligent one. He had neither the qualities nor the\r\naptitudes which constitute a hero. He never understood his own power,\r\nnor realised the influence which, at a certain moment, he wielded over\r\nthe masses; he was almost without ambition; he seldom knew what was\r\nrequired of him; and no one was more surprised than himself when\r\nsuddenly he found that he had become the most popular man in all France.\r\n\r\nHis rise as well as his fall prove very forcibly that the time is past,\r\nand past for ever, when adventurers, by the glamour which they exercise\r\nover the crowd, can become masters as well as leaders.\r\n\r\nTo those who were in Paris at that period, it is more than difficult to\r\naccount for the sudden blossoming of this very inferior plant in the\r\ngarden of French political life, whilst those who have never lived in\r\nthe French capital will utterly fail to realise the circumstances that\r\nbrought it into evidence. The fact is that Boulangism was the product\r\nof the private ambitions of a considerable number of people who, strange\r\nas it may seem, had nothing to do with each other, and who did not work\r\ntogether to ensure triumph. On the other hand, each individual directed\r\nhis effort to securing for himself alone all the benefit arising from\r\nthe movement, and in this General Boulanger played no part at all,\r\nthough he appeared to be the leading spirit of the whole intrigue\r\nassociated with his name.\r\n\r\nThe rise into popularity of General Boulanger took place some little\r\ntime after the election of M. Sadi Carnot to the Presidency of the\r\nRepublic. Carnot was a perfect type of the bourgeoisie of Paris of the\r\nolden days--always cool and methodical, severe in his principles, strong\r\nin his convictions, rather narrow-minded in his views; an austere\r\nfigure, the embodiment of honesty, self-respect personified. His very\r\npossessions he looked upon merely as a means for commanding an added\r\nrespect, and throughout his life he was also a strict observer of the\r\nlaw. To these sterling qualities, however, he added nothing that\r\nappealed to the hearts of his countrymen. He did not excite public\r\nenthusiasm, and scarcely succeeded in winning for himself public\r\nsympathies. He was too correct, and perhaps this extreme observance of\r\nhis duties, whether political, social, or private, interfered with his\r\npopularity; nations, as well as individuals, do not care to be always\r\nconfronted by perfection; they are apt to think it rather dull.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is little wonder that people began to look\r\nbeyond the President of the Republic for the hero which they had yearned\r\nafter ever since the disasters of the Franco-German War had awakened in\r\nthem the desire for revenge on the victors. Further, there were certain\r\nambitious politicians who wanted to come into the limelight, and who\r\nfelt that the steady determination of M. Carnot to govern according to\r\nstrictly constitutional principles left no room for them or for their\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nThe Republic, at that distant time of which I am writing, was not yet\r\nestablished so firmly in the heart of the people that its overthrow\r\ncould not be admitted within the range of possibilities. Is it therefore\r\nto be wondered that those who longed for change should have looked\r\naround them for the man strong enough to lead such an adventure?\r\n\r\nBoulanger, beyond looking well on his black horse, had but little to\r\nrecommend him as a possible destroyer of the Republic. Still, he was a\r\ngeneral, a position which has always possessed great prestige in the\r\neyes of a certain section of French society. He was not shrewd enough to\r\nobserve where his so-called friends were trying to lead him. As a\r\nconsequence he allowed himself to be carried away by the tide that at\r\nlast threw him against the rocks of Jersey, where his political career\r\nended even before his life came to a sudden close in the little\r\nchurchyard of Uxelles, near Brussels.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that Boulangism was engineered by the Royalist party\r\non the one side, and by some enterprising journalists on the other.\r\nEither of these two circumstances would have been enough in itself\r\nultimately to wreck the cause, but at the beginning it appeared in the\r\nlight of a movement which appealed so well to the sympathies and to the\r\nfeelings of the whole nation that it seemed even more formidable from a\r\ndistance than when in its midst.\r\n\r\nEverything conspired to transform it into a vast conspiracy. When, after\r\nthe fall of the Goblet ministry, in which he held the portfolio of the\r\nWar Office, Boulanger found himself obliged to retire from political\r\nlife, and was transferred to the command of an army corps at Clermont\r\nFerrand, he could not reconcile himself to his exile, but used to come\r\nback\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Gerschel, Paris._\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN DREYFUS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Petit, Paris._\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOULANGER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Gerschel, Paris._\r\n\r\nEMILE ZOLA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Photo: Gerschel, Paris._\r\n\r\nM. DE LESSEPS]\r\n\r\nsecretly and disguised to Paris, to see Madame de Bonnemains, who had\r\nsacrificed for him her social position in a most select circle of\r\nParisian society. Once or twice people met him in disguise, and\r\nrecognised him, in spite of a pair of blue spectacles behind which he\r\nfondly hoped he would remain unknown. Thereupon he was immediately\r\ninvested with mystery and romance by those who hoped to find in him a\r\ndocile instrument to further their personal ambitions; and so, in order\r\nto compel those in power to deprive him of his command, he was accused\r\nof conspiring against the safety of the Republic. Thus, by restoring him\r\nto private life, he had thrust upon him by these intriguers the\r\nopportunity to aspire to the supreme functions of Head of the State.\r\n\r\nFor some time even staunch Republicans looked at him with dread. The\r\nnext step was taken by an unknown journalist, who came forth suddenly as\r\nthe apostle of this new messiah, and who conceived the idea of\r\ndistributing, in several departments, bulletins of votes bearing the\r\nname of General Boulanger.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, therefore, France heard with amazement that a multitude\r\nof voters had expressed their willingness to send Boulanger as a deputy\r\nto the Chamber, a thing undreamt of but for M. George Thiebaud’s\r\nadventurous experiment. It was M. Thiebaud who had created Boulangism.\r\nHe was not the only factor in fostering the movement. Another\r\njournalist, one who was well known on the boulevards, M. Arthur Meyer,\r\nthe proprietor of the _Gaulois_, Count Dillon, and the private secretary\r\nof the Comte de Paris, the Marquis de Beauvoir--all played a part. All\r\nthree were men of no mean intelligence, who saw possibilities in this\r\nman to whom the attention of France had been attracted for bringing back\r\nto the throne of their ancestors those Orleans Princes who had failed to\r\nsecure for themselves the help of Marshal MacMahon during the time he\r\nreigned at the Elysée.\r\n\r\nThese three men were credited, in the estimation of those behind the\r\nscenes, with starting this extraordinary adventure which ended so\r\npiteously for its principal character. They furthermore drew into the\r\nenterprise three other strong elements--Henri Rochefort, Count Albert de\r\nMun, and the Duchesse d’Uzés, while through their influence also became\r\nchampions, though in lesser degree, such men as Paul Déroulède and\r\nGeorge Laguerre--an advocate of great talent, who nevertheless is\r\nforgotten to-day--and Lucien Millevoye, who was given charge of one of\r\nthe most important missions that those who played with the name of\r\nBoulanger ever entrusted to their adherents.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, each one of these persons, down to Madame Adam, who,\r\nalmost unknown to herself, was also drawn into the many dark intrigues\r\nto which Boulangism gave rise, worked for a different aim. The Duchess\r\nd’Uzés, when asked to contribute financially to the success of the\r\nenterprise, was actuated by the secret desire to become the Egeria of\r\nthe new hero whose star was rising in the firmament of her country’s\r\nexistence, and to rule that country under his name. Albert de Mun\r\nthought only of the restoration of the Monarchy. The Marquis de Beauvoir\r\nsaw himself so firmly established in the confidence of the Comte de\r\nParis that the latter would feel himself in honour bound to stand by him\r\nwhenever one of those financial catastrophes, which were periodical\r\nevents with him, should once again occur. Henri Rochefort was actuated\r\nby his everlasting mania of opposing every existing government, a mania\r\nto which he owed his success as a journalist and as a politician, and to\r\nwhich he would only have given way with more virulence than before had\r\nsome freak of fortune really brought to the pinnacle Boulanger and his\r\nblack horse. Arthur Meyer saw in the emprise the opportunity to present\r\nhimself before the world as the statesman he firmly believed himself to\r\nbe. Others, such as Déroulède, imagined that the General would conquer\r\nat the point of his sword those provinces which had been snatched from\r\nFrance; or Laguerre, who hoped for a substantial financial reward, and\r\nMillevoye, who aspired to become the Prime Minister of a President of\r\nRepublic after his own heart--all these men worked with the same tools\r\nfor different purposes. They were interested in the cause they were\r\nsupporting, but they did not believe in it otherwise than as a means to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nWhether they would have gone on fighting under the same flag had that\r\ncause triumphed is another question. Very probably not; but while the\r\nstruggle lasted, they threw themselves into it with all the faculties\r\nfor good or for evil with which nature had endowed them. And when the\r\nbattle was lost, the disillusion was equally bitter for each of them.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to analyse the different phases through which Boulangism had\r\nto pass can only result in wonder that it could have maintained its\r\npopularity for such a relatively considerable time, and also that it\r\naroused the serious apprehensions which permeated the ranks of the\r\nRepublican supporters of the government. The party had no leader except\r\nthe irresolute General whom it had adopted.\r\n\r\nMadame d’Uzés, who was in possession of a considerable fortune through\r\nher mother, was a woman who had never been handsome. She was\r\nintelligent, like all the Mortemart family to which she belonged,\r\nambitious, rather tyrannical in character, and violent in her temper\r\nwhen she was opposed or annoyed. She had been left a widow while still\r\nyoung, and enjoyed a foremost position in the Faubourg St. Germain owing\r\nto her great name and immense riches. One of her daughters had married\r\nthe Duc de Brissac, the second one was the Duchesse de Luynes. She was\r\nallied to the bluest blood of France, and had Court precedence been in\r\nvogue, she would have held first rank. She had nothing to gain and\r\neverything to lose by throwing herself into the arms of the “Brave\r\nGénéral,” and the cause which led her to join the ranks of Boulangism\r\nmust have been that she had imagined that when once the “King” had\r\nentered again into his inheritance, the part she had played in that\r\nrestoration would win for her a foremost place in his confidence, would\r\nensure for her an exclusive position among the ranks of his advisers.\r\nThen, too, if the truth must be told, like so many women before her, she\r\nhad also been fascinated by the personal charm of Boulanger, and when in\r\nhis presence her heart, old though it was already, would beat just a\r\nlittle faster than usual. Her desire to rescue her idol from the\r\nfascinations of the woman who held him tied to her apron strings may\r\nalso have had something to do with the facility with which she opened\r\nher purse to him as well as the doors of her house.\r\n\r\nNot only did she become his friend, but also the confidante of his\r\nambitions; of his deceptions; of his ever-increasing bitterness at the\r\ndaily insults and the calumnies which were showered upon him by some of\r\nhis former friends who accused him of treason against their party; of\r\nhis doubts concerning the so-called virtues of the Republicans as well\r\nas of the Republic itself. She used to comfort him, turn his thoughts\r\naway from such vexatious matters, and try to win him over almost\r\nimperceptibly to her own political ideas. At last she thought she had\r\nsucceeded; but she had not sufficient perspicacity to judge of the true\r\ncharacter of Boulanger, who had never understood anything in the way of\r\npolitics except the old saying: “Otes toi de là, que je m’y mette!”\r\n(“Get out from there in order that I may step into your place!”)\r\n\r\nCount Albert de Mun was the only really strong man who had joined the\r\nranks of the Boulangists--I mean strong in the sense of principles and\r\nopinions. He was the son of the charming Eugénie de la Forronays, one of\r\nthe most delightful among the gallery of delightful women who adorn that\r\nso widely read book, the “Récit d’une Sœur,” by Mrs. Augustus Craven. He\r\nhad been singularly blessed by Providence with all the qualities,\r\nphysical, moral, and intellectual, that help to make a man attractive.\r\nHe had talent, moreover, and remarkable eloquence, and he believed in\r\nmonarchy as a system and as a tradition to which all his past as well as\r\nthat of his race enjoined him to remain faithful. He had earnestly hoped\r\nthat through Boulanger the cause to which he had devoted his life would\r\ntriumph, and he did not hesitate to lend to the General the prestige of\r\nhis personal influence over his own followers.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d’Uzés and the Count Albert de Mun were the most sincere in\r\nthis most insincere adventure. It could add nothing to what they already\r\npossessed, and might, on the contrary, considerably endanger their\r\nposition among their former friends in case of failure. All honour to\r\nthem. They at least pursued no other aims than the gratification of\r\ntheir patriotic feelings. They may have been childish in their loyalty,\r\nbut there was nothing of sordidness or of petty feelings of revenge or\r\nof worldly triumph in its composition.\r\n\r\nOne can hardly say the same concerning others whom I have already\r\nmentioned. Laguerre was of a type of _condottieri_ met with in the pages\r\nof the history of the Italian republics, ready to do anything except\r\nturn back on the enterprise once begun, whose hands were always open to\r\nreceive but not to give, whose ambitions were great, but unselfishness\r\nlimited, who looked toward the enjoyments of the present hour and toward\r\nthe gratification of the fancies of the moment, but never ahead; who\r\ncould not see the consequences of their actions, because they knew that\r\nthese would fall on other heads than their own. A brilliant man was\r\nLaguerre, but a character that did not inspire confidence and sacrifice,\r\none of those tools which are indispensable to every conspiracy. His\r\neloquence was unrivalled, his wit something marvellous, his way of\r\nhandling irony as a weapon, quite indescribable; but though he was a\r\npolitician, he was not a political man, and even less a statesman.\r\n\r\nDéroulède was a patriot, if patriotism is synonymous with rabidness. He\r\ncould influence the masses by the torrent of his words. Whether he could\r\nlead them is a question which has remained unanswered to this day, and\r\none may be excused if one entertains doubts concerning his capacities in\r\nthat respect. He had made a name for himself by his anti-German\r\nfeelings; he gave it even more importance by his attitude in the\r\nBoulanger conspiracy; but when he put his undoubted popularity at the\r\nservice of the General he did so with the intention of working for the\r\nwelfare of the Republic, and he would have become his most bitter foe\r\nhad he found out that Boulanger was but the instrument of the Orleanist\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAs for Millevoye, it was another thing. He was the only one among all\r\nthese passengers in the same ship who had something akin to political\r\npenetration, and who could understand that, when one aspires to\r\noverthrow the government of a country, it is necessary to secure for\r\noneself strong sympathies abroad in order not to find obstacles in the\r\nway later on. He also had patriotic feelings akin to those of Déroulède,\r\nbut he had more shrewdness, and he it was who deceived himself that he\r\ncould procure for General Boulanger the support of no less a personage\r\nthan the Tsar of all the Russias.\r\n\r\nWhen the events which I am about to relate occurred, the Franco-Russian\r\n_rapprochement_ had not yet taken place. In 1888 the idea of a French\r\nalliance was not popular in Russia, and especially was its Foreign\r\nOffice strongly German in its leanings. Nevertheless, Millevoye\r\ndetermined to see for himself whether it would not be possible to\r\ntriumph over a certain mistrust which existed in Russian official\r\nspheres in regard to the French Republic. He resolved to offer in\r\nexchange a mute acquiescence to the election for life of General\r\nBoulanger as its President, a defensive alliance against Germany and\r\nAustria, as well as the support of France in case Russia wanted to\r\nsettle to her advantage the long-pending question of the Straits and the\r\nBosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn this episode lies the only attempt at seriousness of the Boulanger\r\nconspiracy, and it would be a pity that it should remain in the darkness\r\nwhich hitherto has enshrouded it. Millevoye, in order to execute the\r\nplan that he had elaborated, addressed himself to Madame Adam (Juliette\r\nLambert), and asked her for her advice. Juliette Lambert, who still\r\ndreamed of an ideal Republic, put at the service of Millevoye all her\r\ngenius and all her heart. She gave him a letter of introduction to a\r\nfriend she had in St. Petersburg, a lady well known in Court circles;\r\nand, in order to ensure the success of Millevoye, who had been very\r\ncareful to hide from her the fact that he wanted to enlist the\r\nsympathies of Russia in favour of General Boulanger--rather, telling her\r\nthat his aim was to propose, in the name of the Republican party, an\r\nalliance against Germany--she had given him certain political documents\r\ncalculated to help him in his perilous adventure.\r\n\r\nMillevoye first sent to St. Petersburg his friend, Miss Maud Gonne, a\r\nlovely Irish girl, who since that time made herself widely known owing\r\nto her advocacy of Fenianism.\r\n\r\nMiss Maud Gonne duly arrived in Russia, and, thanks to her efforts and\r\nthose of the Russian lady to whom I have already referred, Millevoye was\r\nintroduced into the presence of M. Pobedonostseff, then Procurator of\r\nthe Holy Synod and personal friend of Alexander III., who promised he\r\nwould himself submit to the Sovereign the documents which Millevoye left\r\nin his charge.\r\n\r\nDuring this interview which the Russian statesman granted to the French\r\npolitician the latter broached at once the question of General\r\nBoulanger, but this met with no response. The Tsar was far too shrewd a\r\nman to allow himself to be drawn into an adventure which, besides\r\neverything else, had against it a shade of ridicule. Millevoye was\r\ndiscouraged in his dreams, but the seeds sown by his journey were to\r\nbring fruit in quite an unexpected fashion much later on.\r\n\r\nMadame Adam was furious when she heard that Millevoye, instead of\r\npleading the cause of the Republic, had tried to put forward that of\r\nGeneral Boulanger. She not only turned her back upon him when he\r\nreturned crestfallen from his journey, but joined the ranks of the\r\nadversaries of the pseudo hero, becoming one of the advisers of M.\r\nConstant in the campaign that the latter led with such success against\r\nBoulangism and its chief leaders.\r\n\r\nM. Arthur Meyer, to whom already I have made a passing reference, is\r\nmore in his proper place among journalists than in the ranks of\r\npolitical men. He is a curious figure in the kaleidoscopic picture that\r\nParisian society represents to-day, and though he has no aristocratic\r\nancestry behind him, he is ever a welcome and much-desired guest in the\r\nselect salons of the city.\r\n\r\nIt can, therefore, hardly be wondered that with such elements the\r\nBoulangist party was doomed to failure. It was born by accident out of\r\nthe imagination of a man who had nothing better to do than to try to\r\nraise tiny storms in a teacup. It wanted a leader, and it required\r\nsoldiers to push it forward. Unfortunately, it attracted politicians,\r\neach of whom wanted to exploit it for the furtherance of his own cause,\r\nand was led by a man in love, who preferred the caresses of Madame de\r\nBonnemains to the chances of being imprisoned, and who afterwards was\r\ncarried to the Elysée by the enthusiasm of an intoxicated nation, who\r\nwould have risen like one man to deliver him had the government tried to\r\ncapture him.\r\n\r\nM. Constant, one of the ablest Prime Ministers France has ever had,\r\njudged the acute situation with perfect accuracy. General Boulanger in\r\nprison was a danger to the safety of the Republic; General Boulanger in\r\na voluntary exile ceased to be a subject of dread to anyone. In France,\r\nmore than in any other country, cowardice is fatal. She turned her head\r\naway from her favourite of the day before when she found out that he had\r\nnot the courage to take a single risk in order to ensure his future\r\ntriumph. When M. Constant caused to be conveyed secretly to the “Brave\r\nGénéral” the fact that he was to be arrested during the night, and also\r\nmanaged to procure for himself the alliance of Madame de Bonnemains in\r\nher fear of losing her lover, the fate of Boulangism was sealed.\r\nDeprived of its chief, and of his prestige--which was far more\r\nimportant, because it was on that prestige the leaders of the party had\r\nreckoned far more than on the man himself--the forlorn cause he had\r\nembodied was bound to fall with a crash and bury everything under its\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\nAs for the heroine of this semi-burlesque and semi-dramatic adventure,\r\nshe died shortly after its dénouement. When Boulanger had fled from\r\nFrance at her earnest request, she was already doomed, and what is\r\nworse, she knew it. She was selfish enough to wish to keep for herself\r\nduring the few days which were left to her on earth the love of the man\r\nshe adored, and, seriously, who can blame her for it? Certainly had\r\nBoulanger been of the material from which conspirators are made he\r\nwould have sacrificed her on the altar of his future glory. It would\r\nhave been masculine selfishness, and though his partisans may regret he\r\ndid not display it, others may be forgiven if they see a redeeming\r\nfeature to all the follies which will ever remain inseparable from the\r\nname of Boulanger, in the weakness which made him lose and destroy a\r\npolitical party, because he could not bear to see a woman weep. It is\r\ncertain that he truly loved Madame de Bonnemains; his suicide is proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE PANAMA SCANDAL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest of the many sad scandals that have damaged the fair\r\nfame of the Third Republic has certainly been the lamentable adventure\r\nconnected with the Panama Canal. It gave rise to such despicable\r\nintrigues, brought to light such demeaning cupidities, provoked such\r\nbitter animosities, that the only wonder is that the Republic itself did\r\nnot perish in the resulting sea of mud which was showered upon it as\r\nwell as upon its leading men.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to relate all the intricacies of this memorable\r\naffair, but an effort can be made to describe its various phases so far\r\nas they have become known. It is next to impossible to determine the\r\nlimit where truth ends and fabrication begins in this inextricable\r\nembroglio, which arose out of the fear of some, the avarice of others,\r\nthe general corruption everywhere. This struck home the more because it\r\noccurred in a country where the establishment of a Republican government\r\nhad been hailed with joy by those who accused the Empire of having\r\nbrought along with it the system of _pots de vin_, to use the typical\r\nFrench expression, about which fierce Radicals, like Ranc, for instance,\r\nspoke always with such disdain and contempt.\r\n\r\nWhatever occurred later on, the Panama enterprise was a perfectly honest\r\none at its beginning. The high honour of Ferdinand de Lesseps would\r\nalone have been a perfect guarantee as to the intentions of its\r\npromoters, even if these had been unknown men, and such was not the\r\ncase. But the difficulties which the whole affair presented had never\r\nbeen properly appreciated, and the brilliant success of the Suez Canal\r\nhad blinded the eyes of those who aspired to emulate it under different\r\nconditions, and without the moral help of powerful people such as the\r\nEmperor Napoleon III., and the Khedive Ismail. Without this even the\r\ngenius of Lesseps might have proved insufficient, in presence of the\r\nopposition which England made to the construction of the canal.\r\n\r\nLesseps himself had grown old, and, thanks to the atmosphere of flattery\r\nwith which he was surrounded, had come to believe that nothing would be\r\nimpossible once he was associated with it. At the same time he naively\r\nacknowledged that he had not the slightest idea either of the country,\r\nor of the local conditions with which the builders of the new canal\r\nwould find themselves confronted in actual working.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty which arose was, of course, the want of money. It\r\nwas soon discovered that the funds first subscribed would prove totally\r\ninsufficient. Then someone suggested the unfortunate idea of an appeal\r\nto the government for permission to organise a public lottery, the\r\nproceeds of which would be devoted to the construction of the canal.\r\n\r\nIt was the issue of these so-called Panama bonds which was to end in a\r\ndisaster quite unprecedented in the annals of French finance, and which\r\nstruck the country to its heart, because its principal victims belonged\r\nto the poorer classes who had been fascinated by the magical name of\r\nFerdinand de Lesseps.\r\n\r\nThe lottery, however, was not so easy to organise, and at first met with\r\nconsiderable opposition in political circles. Lotteries were not looked\r\nupon with favour; one which had for object the continuation of an\r\nenterprise that after all was not French, and which offered no\r\nguarantee that it would remain in French hands, did not inspire\r\nsympathy, indeed, several leading politicians openly declared that they\r\nwould do their very best to discredit the scheme. On the other hand\r\nmoney was wanted, and, what is still more important, courage was wanting\r\nalso on the part of the directors of the new company to declare openly\r\nthat, the result of the subscriptions not having answered their\r\nexpectations, the best thing to do would be to go into voluntary\r\nliquidation.\r\n\r\nBut by adopting such a course, one would have proclaimed defeat openly,\r\nand even an honest man like Charles de Lesseps recoiled before such a\r\ncourse, well realising the storm of abuse which it would provoke on all\r\nsides. The directors therefore looked around them for means of\r\nsalvation, and the issue of lottery bonds appeared as the best solution.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the sad story began, and the imprudent course which\r\nended by bringing the grey hairs of the great Ferdinand de Lesseps to\r\nthe grave in sorrow and shame was started. The permission of the\r\ngovernment had to be obtained, either by fair means or by foul, and the\r\nnecessity to save a work upon which so many hopes had been centred, and\r\nwhich had already cost so much money, persuaded the administrators of\r\nthe Panama Company to listen to the tempting advice given to them by men\r\nlike Cornelius Herz, or Arton, and to have recourse to the persuasion of\r\ncheques offered with the necessary discretion in order to win over to\r\nthem a few rebellious consciences that hitherto had refused to be\r\nconvinced of the necessity of issuing Panama lottery bonds.\r\n\r\nThis fact alone was sad enough. Unfortunately it was aggravated by\r\npolitical passion, and all the enemies of the government who afterwards\r\nwere the first to cry out that this scandal ought to have been\r\nprevented at all costs, that the services rendered to his country by the\r\nman known everywhere by the name of the “Grand Français” ought to have\r\nguaranteed him from such vile attacks which began from all sides to be\r\nmade against his honour, were at that time the most rabid in their\r\noutcries against him and against the light-heartedness with which he had\r\nallowed himself to be drawn into the adventure which was ultimately to\r\nland him in the criminal dock.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the scandal connected with the Panama enterprise could\r\nnever have reached the proportions it attained had it not been for the\r\npassions of the Royalist party, which thought the situation might, if\r\nproperly engineered, bring down the Republic, and allow them to instal a\r\nMonarchy in its place. They wanted to discredit the ministry then in\r\npower, to discredit the two Legislative Chambers--to discredit France,\r\nin short; but then it was of France that they thought the least.\r\n\r\nI find a proof of this assertion in the book published a few years ago\r\nby Arthur Meyer, in which he mentions the Panama affair among other\r\nthings, and relates how he called upon Charles de Lesseps at the time\r\nthe truth was just beginning to ooze out in public, and told him that in\r\norder to save his skin, he ought to transform the private scandal into a\r\npublic demonstration of the corruption prevailing in French political\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nCharles de Lesseps, let it be said to his honour, was incapable of\r\nlending himself to such a proposal, and his reply deserves to be quoted\r\nin its entirety, for it illustrates his native honesty better than a\r\nthousand panegyrics would do:\r\n\r\n“My conscience forbids me to reply to you,” he said to Arthur Meyer when\r\nthe latter implored him to name the individuals to whom the Panama\r\ncompany had distributed cheques with a lavish hand. “Supposing even,\r\nwhich I deny, that the directors or the friends of the Panama Company,\r\nin order to serve its interests, had had recourse to measures which for\r\nmy part I would always blame, do you think that I have the right to\r\ndenounce people who have had confidence in my loyalty and in my\r\ndiscretion? No, I shall say nothing; and more than that, I have nothing\r\nto say. Our honesty will come out victoriously in all this campaign\r\nwhich has been started against us, and which I deplore far more for my\r\nfather’s sake than for our own. And then, I must add it, and I am\r\ntalking now to you in perfect frankness, I care for the Republic. I will\r\nnot go so far as to say that my Republican ideal has been attained at\r\nthe present moment, but my wish is to spare to the Republic the shame of\r\nbeing plunged into that torrent of mud which you do not hesitate to\r\nthrow upon her. You belong to a party which has particular opinions as\r\nto that subject; this is your private affair whether you accept its\r\nmethods or not, but I certainly won’t help you.”\r\n\r\nMeyer had to content himself with this proud reply, which is the more to\r\nbe admired in that at the moment when he was so generously refusing to\r\nbuy his own safety by denouncing those who had trusted to his honour,\r\nCharles de Lesseps was perfectly well aware that the very people whom he\r\nwas trying to shield were themselves preparing to throw him overboard in\r\norder to save their already shattered reputations. When, however, the\r\neditor of the _Gaulois_ pressed him to say whether it was true or not\r\nthat Baron Jacques Reinach had been deputed to smooth down the timorous\r\nconsciences of certain deputies and political men, and whether his name\r\ndid not figure on the books of the Panama Company as the recipient of\r\nhuge sums of money, he was obliged to own that as to this point, the\r\naccounts of the Panama Company being open to inspection by its\r\nshareholders, he could not hide the fact that the Baron’s name figured\r\nupon its books as having touched the sum of five million francs.\r\n\r\nIt was not much, but for a man endowed with the journalistic qualities\r\nof Arthur Meyer, it was enough. He forthwith proceeded to inquire as to\r\nwhat Baron Reinach had done with these millions which had been so\r\nliberally put at his disposal, and he very soon discovered that the said\r\nfive millions had been transferred to a banking house called Thierrie,\r\nthe owner of which had for sleeping partner the same Jacques Reinach.\r\n\r\nOnce this fact was established the rest was but child’s play. Meyer very\r\nquickly secured the necessary proofs that a considerable number of\r\ndeputies had received important bribes in order to vote for the issue of\r\nthe Panama lottery bonds. He also discovered something else, and that\r\nwas that this corruption had given birth to a huge system of blackmail,\r\nwhich had drained all the resources of the Panama Company. It had\r\ncruelly expiated its initial error, and had been made to pay for it\r\ndearly, in the literal sense of that word. A host of adventurers had\r\nthreatened it with revelations, the divulging of which it could not\r\nrisk, and the ball, once set rolling, had very soon been transformed\r\ninto an avalanche which had carried away with it not only the money of\r\nthe unfortunate shareholders, but also the honour and the reputation of\r\nthe directors of this doomed concern.\r\n\r\nMeyer, after holding a consultation with his faithful lieutenant,\r\nCornély, of _Figaro_ fame, did not hesitate one single moment as to what\r\nhe had to do. He firmly believed that by raising the formidable scandal,\r\nthe proofs of which in such an unexpected manner had been put within his\r\nreach, he would bring about the fall of the Republic, and thus pave the\r\nway towards the restoration of the Monarchy. Events showed that he was\r\ntotally mistaken, because the Panama scandal did not kill the Republic,\r\nit only overthrew a few political men and several Cabinets, and the\r\nshame of it fell more, perhaps, upon those who had made it public than\r\nupon the miserable beings who had been responsible for it without\r\nrealising the abyss into which their light-heartedness would plunge\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe man who set the ball rolling was a deputy belonging to the Extreme\r\nRight, M. Jules Delahaye, member for the department of Maine-et-Loire.\r\nHe did not hesitate to brand with disgrace many of his colleagues, whose\r\nhands he had pressed perhaps a few hours before he consigned them to\r\nignominy. He threw as a challenge to France, and also to Europe, the\r\nnames of 104 deputies whose consciences had not hesitated before\r\nsubmitting to the fascination of the all-powerful cheque.\r\n\r\nI have met M. Delahaye, and in justice to him I must say that he always\r\nmaintained that he had never thought his speech would have the terrible\r\nconsequences which followed upon it. Not in the least had he expected\r\nthat that list of 104 deputies constituted but a fraction of the people\r\nwho had, under one pretext or another, received money from the coffers\r\nof the Panama Company. He had never admitted, nor even believed\r\npossible, that the directors of that company would have so entirely lost\r\ntheir heads as to listen to every threat, submit to every extortion, and\r\npay, pay, without discrimination and without hesitation, the enormous\r\nsums of hush money that had been drained out of them, half of the time\r\nby people who could not have harmed them in the least degree.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that this whole disaster had fear for its foundation, and\r\npolitical intrigue to thank for the unexpected development that overtook\r\nit. The few officials of the Panama Company administering its affairs\r\nafter they had consented to offer their first bribe, and had seen it\r\naccepted, immediately fell into the clutches of a band of blackmailers\r\nwho had speculated on the impossibility of such a thing becoming public,\r\nand on the natural desire to prevent it getting to the knowledge not\r\nonly of the shareholders of that unfortunate concern, but also of the\r\nvenerable Ferdinand de Lesseps himself.\r\n\r\nThis last event was one which his son Charles most dreaded. He not only\r\nloved, but also respected his father, whose grey hairs he would have\r\nliked to go down honoured to the grave. He remembered the days when with\r\nthe name Ferdinand de Lesseps one could attempt any kind of enterprise,\r\ncould always find people ready to back it up, and to believe in it. He\r\nhad not yet forgotten the praise bestowed on the “Grand Français,” not\r\nonly in his own fatherland, but also everywhere in Europe, and wherever\r\nhe had shown himself. He was but too well aware of the honesty of\r\npurpose that had always distinguished the brave old man who was being\r\npilloried by the same public that had cheered him a few months before,\r\nand he would have given much to be able to take upon his own shoulders\r\nthe weight of the responsibilities that were crushing his father. He\r\ndirected all his efforts towards that one aim, and he partly succeeded,\r\nbecause Providence turned out more merciful than men; she struck old\r\nLesseps in his advanced age, and threw the veil of oblivion on his once\r\npowerful brain.\r\n\r\nHe never knew that he had been sentenced to imprisonment, he never\r\nunderstood anything of the tragedy of which he was the miserable hero.\r\nHe died in blissful unconsciousness of all the evil attached to his\r\nname, of all the scandal that surrounded his last hours. His wife\r\nheroically defended him against the intrusion of any stranger who might\r\nby an unguarded word have aroused his suspicions. His son remained\r\nalways vigilant near his arm-chair, and spoke to him of hope and of\r\nfuture glories coming to pile themselves on those he had already\r\nachieved. In his affection, his filial devotion to his father, Charles\r\nde Lesseps was a hero, and even his worst detractors have bowed down\r\nbefore the courage with which he exposed himself to every reproach, and\r\naccepted every blame, in order to spare the old man who remained sitting\r\nin his arm-chair beside the fire, thinking of the successes of the past,\r\nand ignorant of the tragedy of the present.\r\n\r\nOne day I met Charles de Lesseps coming out of the Palais de Justice in\r\nParis with his advocate. He shook hands, and when I asked him how things\r\nwere going he smiled sadly and replied that he had lost every hope of\r\navoiding a public trial of the directors of the Panama Company, but he\r\nhastened to add, and one could see how very much relieved he felt at the\r\nmere idea: “I have been given the assurance that my father will not in\r\nany case be implicated in the prosecution that is impending.”\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken, his father was also dragged into the dock, and also\r\nsentenced to several years’ imprisonment. Unfortunately for France her\r\npolitical men have not yet understood the necessity which ought to\r\nimpose itself upon every nation without anyone trying to explain it to\r\nher--the duty of respecting its national glories, and shielding them\r\nfrom desecration.\r\n\r\nOne of the curious features of this lamentable Panama affair lies in the\r\nfact that the company’s money went into the coffers of people who\r\nabsolutely could do nothing for it, and who got into the habit of\r\nturning to it whenever they found themselves in want of ready cash for\r\ntheir necessities or even for their pleasures. It has been sweepingly\r\nasserted that scarcely one politician in the whole of France, no matter\r\nto what party he belonged, but had had recourse to it in order to\r\nreplenish his exchequer. There were found some deputies who, whenever\r\nthey required money, managed to whisper in the ear of one or other of\r\nthe many intermediaries through whom the business of corruption was\r\ngoing on that they were forced to make an interpellation in the Chamber\r\nconcerning the management of the concern, which, of course, might bring\r\nalong unpleasant consequences or revelations as to certain facts. Such\r\nan one was sure the next day of finding a cheque in one of his morning\r\nletters. Or it was a friend of some influential personage who declared\r\nthat he had heard that such and such a measure was under consideration,\r\nwhich might prove harmful to the development of the company, or put some\r\nstumbling-block or other in its way, and that this had to be prevented\r\nat all costs. Of course _he_ would not take anything for this, but he\r\nhad to have recourse to a friend able to ward off the impending blow,\r\nand naturally that friend required to be remunerated for his work. Or\r\nagain there was some necessary expense to be incurred in regard to the\r\nnational defence, or to pay for some secret political services which the\r\ngovernment in its incapacity and carelessness as to what were the real\r\ninterests of France refused to undertake, partly also because it could\r\nnot, without imperilling national safety, give to the Chambers the\r\nnecessary explanations as to the reasons which rendered such expenses\r\nindispensable. The self-sacrifice of the company in taking upon itself\r\nsuch an outlay would entitle it to any reward it might care to ask in\r\nexchange, and so forth. Looking backward, it is difficult to understand\r\nthe extreme _naïveté_ which presided over every aspect of this singular\r\nadventure, and the credulity with which serious people like Charles de\r\nLesseps, and his colleagues of the board, believed and were intimidated\r\nby all the old women’s tales that were constantly being brought to them.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find a name among all those which were prominent in\r\npolitical life at that particular moment of French history which was not\r\nmixed up somehow in the Panama scandal. At least one President and a\r\nforeign Ambassador were contaminated by the general infection that\r\nprevailed everywhere.\r\n\r\nM. Rouvier, too, that strong character, was not free from suspicions of\r\nhaving looked into the coffers of the Panama Company. And what gives, to\r\na certain extent, a shade of likelihood to the reproach which was hurled\r\nat him is the following fact, which I believe has never before been made\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nM. Rouvier had amongst his many enemies M. Flourens, then Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, an able, intelligent, and highly cultured man. M.\r\nFlourens did not care at all for M. Rouvier, in whom he saw a future\r\nrival, and recognised a powerful opponent. When some rumours reached his\r\nears that things detrimental to the latter might be put forward in\r\nconnection with the dealings of the Panama Company, he declared to a few\r\npersonal friends that if such was the case he would not hesitate to make\r\nuse of the knowledge, and to do his best to bring the delinquent to\r\njustice. The words were repeated to Rouvier, who smiled and said\r\nnothing. But somehow, a few days later, during a conversation with the\r\nsame friend, to whom he had expressed his determination of being\r\nmerciless in regard to his enemy, M. Flourens changed his attitude, and\r\nmerely remarked that it was a great pity that sometimes outward\r\ncircumstances, over which man had no control, obliged him to tolerate\r\nthings that were repugnant to him, and to look through his fingers on\r\nfacts which he could not disclose without harming superior interests. He\r\nthen added that he had received a letter from M. Rouvier. When further\r\nquestioned as to what its contents might be, he shrugged his shoulders,\r\nand replied: “C’est une lettre qui m’a désarmé, et qui aurait désarmé\r\nbien d’autres que moi.” Months later, General Tchérévine, head of the\r\nTsar’s secret police, received anonymously the original of this very\r\nletter, and never could discover, in spite of strenuous efforts, who had\r\nsent it to him. It was a short but expressive missive, and merely\r\ndeclared that in case Flourens did not hush up the rumours which accused\r\nM. Rouvier of having profited by the circumstances in which the Panama\r\nCompany had found itself involved, he would speak publicly concerning\r\nthe bribes that had been offered to and accepted by a certain Ambassador\r\nin Paris, and state their amount.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that this letter was subsequently put under the\r\neyes of Alexander III. by Count Voronzov, at that time Minister of the\r\nImperial Household.\r\n\r\nThis mere fact that it became possible for the Ambassador of a Foreign\r\nPower to find himself mixed up in the sordid intrigues which gave such a\r\nspecial colouring to the Panama affair proves how wide were its\r\nramifications, and how it had entwined itself around every element that\r\nconstituted modern France. But though many had allowed themselves to be\r\ncompromised in one way or another in this disgraceful story, it would\r\nnever have attained the proportions to which it ultimately rose had not\r\nthe Extreme Right party done its best to fan the general indignation,\r\nand to draw public attention to every incident even of the smallest kind\r\nconnected with it. The leaders of this party did not hesitate an instant\r\nbefore the grave responsibility of exhibiting their national disgrace in\r\nthe presence of an attentive and disgusted Europe, so great was their\r\ndesire of ruining their opponents and overthrowing the Republic. But in\r\nthe end the Panama scandal brought more disgrace to the people who had\r\ndone their best to expose it than to those who had been its immediate\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nI was talking about it some years later with a friend of mine, a\r\nFrenchman of remarkable acuteness and singular clearness of judgment,\r\nwho had been in Paris during the whole time the affair lasted, and had\r\nfollowed it very carefully, though not a politician himself. I asked him\r\nwhat impression it had really produced upon the saner elements of the\r\nFrench nation, who had looked upon it from the distance.\r\n\r\n“It has consolidated the Republic,” was his prompt reply.\r\n\r\n“How is that possible?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“It is easy enough to understand,” he explained to me. “Popular sympathy\r\ngenerally goes to the victims of a cause rather than to those who have\r\nbrought them to the scaffold, be it that of public opinion or any other.\r\nIn this case it was the Republic which happened to be the victim, and\r\nthe so-called Monarchist or Right party who were the denouncers. They\r\nboth benefited in their respective positions, but the people, who\r\ngenerally judge of things according to their own standards, asked\r\nthemselves what was the object that was sought by the disclosures.\r\n\r\n“Corruption has existed everywhere and always. We find it written upon\r\nalmost every page of the world’s history, and it is nothing new to see\r\npoliticians allowing themselves to be influenced by the golden calf.\r\nWhy, even Moses’s priests bent their knee before it in the desert. But\r\nthe fact that they have done so does not mean that the whole nation to\r\nwhich they belong has followed them in their errors.\r\n\r\n“The great mistake in this Panama affair has been that we have tried to\r\nmake France and the Republic responsible. It is but seldom that a\r\ngovernment is corrupt, and it is not guilty of the faults of those who\r\nlead it. A government is a principle; men, even though ministers, are\r\napt to fall and to commit reprovable and even criminal acts. But why\r\naccuse a régime of the actions of a few among those who represent it,\r\nwhy especially shut one’s eyes to the fact that this Panama comedy or\r\ndrama, call it what you like, was nothing else but one of the\r\ninnumerable political intrigues of this or that party against the\r\nexisting order of things? We have often discussed Boulangism; well, the\r\nPanama scandal was simply another Boulangist conspiracy under a\r\ndifferent name. It may have disgraced some individuals, it has not taken\r\nanything away from the grandeur of France or from the merits, such as\r\nthey are, of the Republic. Believe me, my friend, it is not by singing\r\nthe ballad of Madame Angot that a King will re-establish himself at the\r\nElysée. In order to do this, something more than a ‘collet noir’ and a\r\n‘perruque blonde’ is needed. A man is required, and so far I have\r\nneither met nor seen him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTWO PRESIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a constitutionally Republican point of view, M. Sadi Carnot, about\r\nwhom already I have said a few words, made an admirable Head of the\r\nState--honest, dignified, strictly observant of his duties; of unfailing\r\ntact, and with neither slur nor blemish either in his political or in\r\nhis private life. He knew how to hold himself in public, was moreover a\r\nfair speaker and a very well-read man. But he had nothing about him\r\ncapable of provoking enthusiasm among the masses. His cold attitude,\r\nindeed, which drew on him the nickname of “the President with a wooden\r\nhead,” did not appeal to the nation. He was generally respected and\r\nesteemed, he was even liked, but he never became popular, and the\r\nimpression he produced on outsiders, and those who only saw him\r\nperforming his functions, otherwise never being brought into contact\r\nwith him, can be summed up in the remark made by a little schoolgirl\r\nwho, on one of his provincial _tournées_, had presented him with a\r\nbouquet of flowers, and whom he had kissed: “Il ressemble à la poupée de\r\ncire du Musée Grévin, que l’on m’a montrée à Paris, seulement il est\r\nmoins joli” (“He is like the wax doll of the Grévin Museum I was taken\r\nto see in Paris, only he is not so handsome”)\r\n\r\nIn spite of this drawback M. Carnot would very probably have been\r\nre-elected had his career not been cut short by the knife of Caserio. By\r\na strange irony of fate, this Republican, whose ancestors had helped to\r\noverthrow royalty in France, died the death of a King. The odiousness\r\nof this crime is still remembered. It was a crime for which even the\r\nmost rabid anarchists could not find excuse. With the murder of the\r\nEmpress Elizabeth of Austria, it remains one of the most inexplicable\r\ncrimes of modern times, and even political hatreds cannot justify it. M.\r\nCarnot was universally regretted, even by those who did not sympathise\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHis sudden death left the field open for a race to the Presidential\r\nchair, which probably would not have been so fierce had the election of\r\nthe Head of the State taken place under normal conditions, or had he\r\neven succumbed to illness or natural causes. No one had any thought of\r\nthe possibility of a Presidential election, and neither Radical, nor\r\nRepublican, nor the Monarchist parties had a candidate ready to step\r\ninto the place left so suddenly vacant. When the Congress assembled at\r\nVersailles no one had the least idea who, among the eligible politicians\r\nof the moment, held most chances to succeed the murdered President, and\r\nthe election of M. Casimir Périer was due, perhaps, more to the lack of\r\nany suitable competitors than to his own merits.\r\n\r\nM. Casimir Périer was a remarkable man in his way. He came from a good\r\nbourgeois stock, such as had played an important part in political life\r\nat the beginning of the great revolution of 1789. It was in the castle\r\nof his grandfather, Vizille, near Grenoble, that the first revolutionary\r\nassembly of provincial states had taken place. Later on, his grandfather\r\nhad been head of the Cabinet under Louis Philippe, and for more than a\r\ncentury the Périers had been conspicuous in France. Casimir, moreover,\r\nwas extremely rich, which fact gave him an independence such as very few\r\npolitical men of his generation could boast. He had been born and bred\r\nin a most refined atmosphere, and always moved in the very best\r\nsociety, so that he found himself at his ease when he entered the\r\nElysée.\r\n\r\nHis wife also was a most distinguished woman, who bore herself like a\r\nqueen, and who had dispensed not only a semi-regal hospitality in her\r\nown house, long before she was called upon to continue doing so as the\r\nfirst lady in the land, but who, all her life, had also understood the\r\nduties towards the disinherited of this earth which a great fortune\r\ncarries along with it. She was universally respected on account of her\r\nprivate virtues and blameless life, and she brought to the Elysée an\r\natmosphere of elegance and refinement greater even than existed during\r\nthe days when the Duchesse de Magenta had presided over its destinies.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Casimir Périers did away with the reputation for\r\nmeanness and dullness that had clung to the receptions of the Head of\r\nthe State ever since the days of M. Grévy and his estimable but\r\ncommonplace wife. Once more people belonging to the upper classes\r\nreturned to the Presidency. M. and Mme. Casimir Périer visited a great\r\ndeal, accepted invitations to Embassies and to the houses of members of\r\nthe Cabinet; they received frequently too, and made themselves extremely\r\nwell liked in fashionable Paris.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, however, the new President did not find his position\r\npleasant or easy. He had an authoritative character, and liked to have\r\nhis own way, and also to discuss with his ministers the decisions which\r\nthey submitted to his signature. He had been reared under strictly\r\nconstitutional principles, but he was also very well aware of his rights\r\nunder the Constitution of France, and had not the least intention of\r\nforgoing them, or of abandoning one single iota of his prerogatives. He\r\nwas determined from the outset not to allow himself to become a mere\r\nfigurehead in the government, but to make use of his privilege to be put\r\n_au courant_ of everything that was being done around him. His was\r\nessentially a fighting temperament, and it was bound to bring him into\r\nconflict with his ministers, who had been accustomed to the resignation\r\nwith which both M. Jules Grévy and M. Sadi Carnot had acquiesced in\r\neverything that had been proposed to them.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said concerning the resignation of M. Casimir Périer, and\r\nfor a long time it was believed even among people who ought to have\r\nknown better that he had retired owing to threats which the German\r\nAmbassador, Count Munster, had uttered at the time of the first Dreyfus\r\naffair. I have strong reasons to believe that it was nothing of the kind\r\nwhich influenced him. The legend of Captain Dreyfus having been a German\r\nspy exploded long ago, and Count Munster never found himself under the\r\nleast necessity of resorting to threats, though with a certain amount of\r\njustice he may have felt disgusted at the way the person of his\r\nSovereign was dragged into the disreputable affair.\r\n\r\nThe sole reason of M. Casimir Périer’s retirement lay in the sincere\r\nconviction that very soon got hold of him, that he would not be allowed\r\nto do what he liked, or even to attempt to resist the rising tide of\r\nRadicalism which he would have preferred to keep down. He was rich,\r\nindependent, and of an easy and lazy temperament, which made him\r\nimpatient of the resistance which his best intentions met from the very\r\npeople who ought to have appreciated them.\r\n\r\nHe soon realised that if he clung to position he would be overturned as\r\nwere his predecessors, Marshal MacMahon and M. Thiers, and rather than\r\nbe told to go away he preferred to take leave of uncongenial colleagues,\r\nand to retire with all the honours of war. He had made many friends\r\nduring his short tenure of office, but had also contrived to acquire\r\nmany enemies, and somehow the fact of the existence of these last\r\njarred upon his nerves, influencing him perhaps more than it should,\r\nbecause those in high places have no right to be too sensitive. One\r\ncannot change one’s character, however, and that of M. Casimir Périer\r\ncould not brook the thorns which were entwined with the roses that\r\nstrewed his path. He showed, on his retirement, an obstinacy with which\r\nhe has been very bitterly reproached by his personal friends, for he did\r\nso in spite of the supplications of all who composed his immediate\r\nentourage. He declared he should go away, and go away he did.\r\n\r\nHe had been on very good terms with all the foreign Ambassadors and\r\ndiplomats accredited at the Elysée, and these, one and all, bitterly\r\nregretted his departure. M. Casimir Périer had tact and great knowledge\r\nof the world, a quality that his predecessors more or less lacked.\r\nPerhaps it was from this cause that during the few short months of his\r\nPresidency the relations of the French Government with the German\r\nEmbassy had become more cordial than had been the case since the war.\r\n\r\nTalking of the German Embassy, I have already mentioned Count Munster.\r\nHe was a great friend of mine, and perhaps one of the ablest men, under\r\nhis lazy indolent manner, that the German diplomatic service has ever\r\npossessed. His wife having been English, he liked England better than\r\nany other nation, not excepting his own, in certain cases. He looked\r\nlike an Englishman, too, and nothing pleased him more than to be taken\r\nfor one. Essentially a grand seigneur of the old school, he was\r\nincapable of meanness, and even in his diplomatic relations he always\r\navoided saying anything that he did not really think or believe to be\r\nthe truth. Placed in a very delicate position in Paris, where German\r\ndiplomats were strenuously avoided by all those who were not obliged to\r\nreceive them, he contrived even there to make a position for himself,\r\nstill better, perhaps, than Prince Hohenlohe, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the latter had relatives among the society of the Faubourg St.\r\nGermain, where he had been warmly welcomed before the war, but which\r\ngave him the cold shoulder when he returned to Paris in an official\r\ncapacity after the disasters of 1870. And yet Prince Hohenlohe had far\r\nmore conciliatory manners than Count Munster, and was a far pleasanter\r\nman in social relations; also, perhaps, he had more shrewdness than the\r\nlatter, and certainly was more amenable to compromise if the necessity\r\nfor such occurred. But the Count made himself respected wherever he\r\nappeared, I mean respected in the sense that he conveyed the impression\r\nthat he would never allow himself to be trifled with, whilst always\r\nready to meet his opponents in everything except in yielding to them.\r\n\r\nThis digression has led me far away from M. Casimir Périer and his\r\nretirement from public life, and I must return in order to relate the\r\ncircumstances which followed upon his resignation. To say the least of\r\nit, his action considerably embarrassed not only his ministers, but also\r\nthe leaders of the different parties in both Chambers.\r\n\r\nFor the second time within one year the country was called upon to elect\r\na President of the Republic, and for the second time the event came as a\r\ntotal surprise upon France and upon its politicians. Once more\r\ncandidates made themselves heard, and once again, in presence of those\r\nwho pretended that they had the best right not to be passed by in this\r\npolitical Derby, an outsider won the prize, and M. Félix Faure, about\r\nwhom no one had thought, was elected to the Presidency of the French\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nM. Félix Faure was chiefly known because he had been vice-president of\r\nthe famous Ligue des Patriotes, the president of which was then, and\r\ntill his death in the early months of 1914, the ardent Paul Déroulède.\r\nThis fact alone would have been sufficient to excite the apprehensions\r\nof Germany, and M. Faure understood this so well that he at once made up\r\nhis mind to pose outright as a partisan of the Russian alliance, that\r\ndream of all French political men ever since the establishment of the\r\nThird Republic.\r\n\r\nM. Félix Faure was far from being a stupid man: he had his points of\r\nridicule which perhaps did him more harm than real defects would have\r\ndone. He had vanity to an inordinate degree, loved luxury and splendour,\r\nand enjoyed the external advantages of his new position with an almost\r\nchildish joy. He fondly imagined that he had been born to the purple\r\nwhich had been thrown upon his shoulders, and without the instincts of a\r\nparvenu he yet behaved like one.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, a far greater knowledge of politics than he has ever\r\nbeen given credit for, and he was a sincere patriot, though his\r\npatriotism was an essentially selfish one. It is to be doubted whether\r\nhe ever would have reconciled himself to a return to the life of an\r\nordinary citizen, and perhaps the greatest luck of a life which was very\r\nlucky, when all is said and done, was his death when still in the\r\nenjoyment of the privileges of a position he had grown to love.\r\n\r\nBut I repeat it again, he was no mean politician. It was under his\r\ntenure of office that the Russian alliance was established, and he\r\ncertainly showed keen perspicacity in the way in which he contrived to\r\nbring it about, as well as by the perseverance he displayed on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt was M. Faure who first thought of sending the French fleet to\r\nCronstadt, and it was he who insisted on the great reception that was\r\nawarded to the Russians when their fleet came to Toulon. It was he,\r\nalso, who first tried to win over the Russian Ambassador, M. de\r\nMohrenheim, to his views on the subject, and who did not hesitate to\r\nresort to all kinds of diplomatic arguments in order to win his\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nLater on M. Mohrenheim gave himself all the credit for the result of the\r\nconferences which took place at that particular time between him and M.\r\nFaure, conferences about which the world heard nothing, and suspected\r\neven less. But though Russian diplomacy prided herself upon having hit\r\non this brilliant idea of a _rapprochement_ with France, as a safeguard\r\nagainst the ambitions of the Triple Alliance, the fact remains, and is\r\nwell known to all those who have been behind the scenes of what was\r\ngoing on in Europe at that particular time, that it was in France that\r\nthe idea originated, and that this idea had been carefully entertained\r\nand impressed upon the French nation by none other than M. Félix Faure.\r\n\r\nApart from any statesmanlike leanings and aspirations which did exist in\r\nhim, he was drawn towards it by his own personal vanity, and the desire\r\nto be able to welcome in Paris as his guests, first the representatives\r\nof the most autocratic Sovereign in the world, and later on that\r\nSovereign himself, by whom he, the son of a Havre tanner, would be\r\ntreated as an equal. That would be a triumph indeed, and in order to\r\nobtain it he used every effort to break through all the barriers which\r\nexisted between the realisation of his dream and the hard reality.\r\n\r\nHuge sums of money were spent at that time both in France and in Russia\r\nin order to prepare the public mind, through the press, for this\r\nextraordinary turn in the politics of both countries. The campaign was\r\nengineered with consummate skill, and very few people saw through it. It\r\nvery quickly brought about the wished-for results, and might have done\r\nso even more quickly had it not been for various indiscretions committed\r\nby M. Mohrenheim, whose personal wants were sometimes ahead of the march\r\nof events, and who allowed himself upon one or two occasions to let his\r\nimpatience take the upper hand of his prudence, and in order to satisfy\r\nthose for whom he worked to attack with violence certain French\r\npoliticians whom he feared might prove rebellious against the efforts\r\nwhich were being made. He tried, therefore, to oblige them to walk in\r\nthe path mapped out for them.\r\n\r\nOne of these two occasions arose when M. Clemenceau, who already at that\r\ntime had made for himself an eminent position in the ranks of the\r\nRadical party, whose leader he was supposed to be, uttered some doubts\r\nas to whether the French Government was not going too far in its\r\nadvances to Russia, and was compromising the dignity of France without\r\nfeeling sure that its conduct would be reciprocated on the banks of the\r\nNeva. Alexander III. was reigning still, and it was very well known he\r\nhad no sympathies for Republics in general, and many people believed,\r\ntogether with Clemenceau, that though the Marseillaise had been played\r\nat the State dinner which was given at Peterhof in honour of the French\r\nnaval squadron anchored at Cronstadt, things would not go further, and\r\nthe Tsar would hesitate a very long time before he would condescend to\r\nadmit Marianne in his intimacy, and to walk hand in hand with her,\r\namidst the crowned heads of Europe, whilst they stood aghast at the\r\nunexpected spectacle.\r\n\r\nFurious to discover that the doubts uttered by M. Clemenceau had found\r\nan echo among many prudent French political circles, Baron Mohrenheim,\r\nin his impatience, unburdened his outraged feelings to the Marquis de\r\nMorès, that fierce adversary of everything that had to do with the\r\nRepublic and its partisans. Morès did not hesitate to say openly that it\r\nwas the Radical party in France that was doing its best to prevent an\r\nalliance with Russia, for which the latter country was yearning. Upon\r\nthis Clemenceau, indignant and never behindhand on occasions when he\r\ncould attack someone, took up his best Toledo pen and wrote to the\r\nRussian Ambassador the following letter, which certainly deserves not to\r\nfall into oblivion, where it has remained these long years:\r\n\r\n“_Paris, September 7th, 1892._\r\n\r\n     “MONSIEUR L’AMBASSADEUR,--In a letter that has been made public,\r\n     the Marquis de Morès declares quite positively that you have\r\n     exchanged with him the following remarks: ‘We do not know in Russia\r\n     with whom we can treat here. The greater number of public\r\n     functionaries and officials and the whole of the press is in the\r\n     hands of the Jews, or of England. I have not sufficient money to be\r\n     able to fight them, whilst England is prodigal with hers.\r\n     Clemenceau is openly attacking, in the corridors of the Chamber,\r\n     the alliance with Russia; I am getting very uneasy, the more so\r\n     that I do not see upon whom I could eventually lean in case of\r\n     necessity.’\r\n\r\n     “I only desire to notice in these words of yours the part which\r\n     refers to myself.\r\n\r\n     “I cannot allow you, by reason of your official position as\r\n     Ambassador, to attribute to me publicly language of that kind\r\n     without declaring to you that you have been misinformed.\r\n\r\n     “When the Tsar stood up to listen to the Marseillaise, I was, as\r\n     all Frenchmen were too, justly proud at this public homage rendered\r\n     to my country. Before the whole of Europe, looking attentively at\r\n     what was taking place on that day, the French nation put her hand\r\n     loyally into the hand that had stretched itself towards her.\r\n\r\n     “It is not my place to discuss with you, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur,\r\n     the consequences of the events which have taken place at Cronstadt;\r\n     all that I can say is that no one desires more ardently than I do\r\n     that these might prove beneficial for both nations, and also for\r\n     the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\n     “Any excesses of zeal connected with such a noble cause find most\r\n     certainly their excuse in that cause itself. It is only to be\r\n     regretted that they also might harm it. It is for that very reason,\r\n     I do not doubt, that by thinking the thing over you have already\r\n     convinced yourself that the ancient precept of ‘_Ne quid nimis_,’\r\n     especially when such important interests are at stake, is an\r\n     excellent safeguard.\r\n\r\n     “As concerns myself, I put it into practice to-day. You are our\r\n     honoured guest, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur; allow me not to forget it,\r\n     and to beg of you to accept the assurance of my most respectful\r\n     feelings.\r\n\r\nRIGHT\r\n“(Signed) GEORGES CLEMENCEAU.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter considerably embarrassed Baron Mohrenheim, the more so\r\nbecause he did not reply to it immediately: after it had been published\r\nby the Agence Havas, the papers took it up, and different reporters\r\ncalled upon the Russian Ambassador to ask him for explanations. He gave\r\nthem but lamely, thus making himself more ridiculous. For instance, he\r\ndeclared that he had been away from Paris when it had been brought to\r\nhis secretary, Baron Korff, and that the latter had forgotten to deliver\r\nit to him immediately upon his return, so that he had only learned its\r\ncontents through the press. In fact, he made many groundless excuses and\r\nonly added to the embarrassment of the position. At last on the 12th of\r\nSeptember the Agence Havas published the following reply from the\r\nRussian Ambassador to the leader of the Radical party in the Chamber:\r\n\r\n“_Paris, September 12th, 1892._\r\n\r\n     “MONSIEUR LE DÉPUTÉ,--The Agence Havas publishes a letter which you\r\n     have been kind enough to address to me on the seventh of the\r\n     present month. On that day I was at Aix-les-Bains, which I left on\r\n     the next day, Thursday, to return to Paris only yesterday, Sunday.\r\n\r\n     “I hasten to inform you that your letter has not yet reached me\r\n     to-day, otherwise you may rest assured that I would have eagerly\r\n     taken this opportunity to express to you my most sincere thanks for\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     “Nothing could have afforded me greater satisfaction than to be\r\n     able to convince myself thus of the real and frank feelings of\r\n     sympathy which you express to me for my country, and to read about\r\n     the good wishes which you add in it towards the prosperity of a\r\n     cause common to us both and dear to us both, thus doing away with\r\n     misunderstandings, and making them henceforward impossible. As you\r\n     express yourself, Monsieur le Député, ‘_Ne quid nimis_’ ought to be\r\n     the motto of us both, and as you may well believe, I have had more\r\n     than one opportunity to remember it in many circumstances which I\r\n     have witnessed during the long years of my public life, a life that\r\n     has always been devoted to the different tasks I have been\r\n     entrusted with.\r\n\r\n     “Will you kindly receive, Monsieur le Député, the assurance of my\r\n     distinguished and devoted consideration.\r\n\r\nRIGHT\r\n“(Signed) BARON DE MOHRENHEIM.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn publishing this reply of the Russian Ambassador, the Agence Havas\r\nadded that M. Clemenceau had hastened to inform it that his letter had\r\nbeen handed over to the secretary of the Baron, M. de Korff, on\r\nSeptember 8th, who had given an undertaking that he should deliver it\r\npersonally to the Ambassador immediately upon the latter’s return to\r\nParis. In spite of the frantic efforts made by the Russian and French\r\nGovernments to minimise the impression produced by this correspondence,\r\nthe prestige of M. de Mohrenheim suffered considerably from its\r\npublication, and he had perforce to become more careful in the future.\r\n\r\nBut he was not removed from his post. Indeed, it very rarely happens\r\nthat a Russian official is obliged to retire into private life by reason\r\nof his public mistakes. The Russians are an enduring people. The Baron\r\nwas to witness many other triumphs, especially that of being able to\r\nwelcome Nicholas II. and his consort in Paris, which event considerably\r\nadded to his personal prestige, and also to his personal advantages.\r\n\r\nTo return to M. Félix Faure, he went on quietly pursuing the course he\r\nhad embarked upon, and preparing the ground for the great things which\r\nhe felt himself called upon to perform in the near future. He was so\r\nsure of the ultimate success of his plans that he began to make ready\r\nthe Elysée for the glories that awaited it. He drew largely on the\r\ncredits put at his disposal for the upkeep of the palace, he tried to\r\ngive to his household the appearance of a real Court in miniature, to\r\ntrain not only the officers and civilians attached to his person to\r\nperform their duties according to the old etiquette that had prevailed\r\nduring the Monarchy, but also to put his servants, his stables, his\r\nkitchens, and the maintenance of the state with which he liked to\r\nsurround himself on the footing he considered to be necessary to the\r\nChief Magistrate of the Republic. He also--and this effort is perhaps\r\nthe most meritorious of all those he made at the time--did his best to\r\nassimilate the habits and customs prevailing in the higher classes of\r\nsociety, and he succeeded admirably in doing so, helped as he was by the\r\nnumerous fair ladies at whose shrine he worshipped.\r\n\r\nBut where he showed the greatest tact was in avoiding incidents like the\r\none which we have just related concerning M. de Mohrenheim. Had he been\r\nPresident of the Republic at the time it occurred, he would certainly\r\nhave been made aware of the possibility, or rather the likelihood of its\r\nhappening, and taken measures to avoid its reaching public knowledge.\r\nThe alliance with Russia, which was in the air when he was elected to\r\nthe Presidency, and which during the term of M. Carnot had been started\r\nin a preliminary manner by certain influential people, was in part his\r\npersonal work. I have said that it was he who had first thought of\r\nsending the French fleet to Cronstadt. He was at that time only a\r\nminister, and did not dream of ever becoming Head of the State, but he\r\nsaw already looming in the distance the great things which were bound to\r\nfollow for France in the event of the public recognition of its\r\nRepublican Government by the most powerful Monarch of Europe, and he\r\nfelt that something of the glory of such an event was bound to cling to\r\nhis own humble person, which might, thanks to this circumstance, come\r\nforward more brilliantly than he could have hoped for when he first\r\nentered public life.\r\n\r\nHe was to reap his reward, and he must have realised it on that lovely\r\nautumn day when he went to receive Nicholas II. and his Consort at the\r\nrailway station of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. As he drove along,\r\nsitting opposite to them in the Daumont with outriders, in which they\r\nmade their State entry into the French capital, he may well be pardoned\r\nif he forgot the beginnings of his political career, and the modest\r\nvilla where his early days had been spent at Havre. Can one wonder if he\r\nlost his head a little, in the presence of that unhoped for success, and\r\nthat, having such an opportunity to be on equal footing with a real\r\nSovereign, he forgot sometimes that he was not one himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL AND PRESIDENTIAL VISITS\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Félix Faure had been but a short time President when the Emperor\r\nAlexander III. died in such an unexpected manner. This untoward event\r\ninterfered with the advances France had in contemplation; indeed,\r\nalready in Paris there had been talk of Russia as _la nation amie et\r\nalliée_. But, on the other hand, the obsequies of the Emperor gave the\r\nFrench Government an opportunity of manifesting its sympathies with\r\nRussia. A special military mission, headed by General Boisdeffre, at\r\nthat time head of the General Staff, was sent to St. Petersburg, where\r\nit remained until the marriage of the new Tsar. It was not only made\r\nmuch of by those who favoured a _rapprochement_ with France, of whom\r\nthere were a considerable number in Russian society, but thanks to the\r\nability of the French Ambassador, Comte de Montebello, was also brought\r\ninto contact with leading Russian politicians.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the conditions of a defensive alliance between both\r\ncountries came under serious discussion. The new Emperor showed himself\r\nunusually gracious to all the members of the mission, and when General\r\nBoisdeffre timidly remarked that the President of the Republic would be\r\nenvious of the honour he had experienced of being brought into personal\r\ncontact with His Majesty, Nicholas replied, half jokingly and half\r\nearnestly, that perhaps he would pay a visit to the President in Paris,\r\nwhich city he had a great desire to see.\r\n\r\nThese words raised roseate anticipations at the time, and later on were\r\nseized upon by the French Government and construed into a promise made\r\nby the Emperor Nicholas II. to visit M. Félix Faure, then President of\r\nFrance. Nor was the Emperor allowed to forget. General Boisdeffre\r\nreturned to Russia some sixteen months later for the Coronation of the\r\nTsar, and there, together with Comte de Montebello, had many serious\r\nconversations with Prince Lobanoff, the Russian Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and with General Obroutscheff, then head of the Russian General\r\nStaff, who, being married to a Frenchwoman, was one of the staunchest\r\nsupporters of an alliance with France. At a direct result of these\r\ninterviews, Nicholas II. was induced to promise that his visits to\r\nEuropean Courts on the occasion of his accession to the throne would\r\ninclude one to Paris.\r\n\r\nWhen the news became official, the enthusiasm it excited among all\r\nclasses in France was absolutely indescribable. I remember that one\r\nmorning, as I was walking down the Champs Elysées, I saw two workmen,\r\nwho were mending one of the lanterns of the Avenue, eagerly scanning a\r\nnewspaper with a portrait of the Tsar, and heard one say to the other,\r\n“C’est celui-là qui va nous débarrasser des Prussiens” (“He is the man\r\nwho will rid us of the Prussians”). The whole nation saw itself once\r\nmore in possession of Alsace and Lorraine, and never thought about the\r\nimpending Imperial visit as anything else than the first step towards\r\nthat consummation.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, however, we did not care for it at all. It seemed humiliating\r\nto our national pride that our Sovereign should make the first advances\r\nto a country the government of which represented everything that was\r\nantipathetic to an autocracy like ours. When I say “we,” I am talking of\r\nthe saner elements of our country. In Russia, as well as in France, the\r\nanti-German elements hailed the situation with joy, and hoped great\r\nthings from a closer union of the two nations.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor on his side could not but feel flattered at the shower of\r\npraise and compliments that fell from the French nation and the French\r\npress. It tickled his fancy to be received in triumph in the capital of\r\na Republican country, and to find prostrate at his feet its most rabid\r\nRadicals. He did not see, or did not care to see, the undercurrents that\r\nactuated this enthusiasm; besides, Russia wanted a loan, and wanted it\r\nunder favourable conditions. The presence of the Tsar in Paris ensured\r\nthe success of such an operation, and, as Henri IV. said, “Paris vaut\r\nbien une messe.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be questioned which of the two countries indulged most in\r\nplatitudes on this memorable occasion. France, at least, was actuated by\r\nthe legitimate desire to recover her lost provinces, and she may well be\r\nforgiven if she allowed herself to be carried away beyond the limits of\r\nthat courtesy which a great nation is bound to show to any foreign\r\nSovereign who honours it with a visit. But Russia---- Was it worthy of\r\nher, was it dignified on the part of the Monarch so to stoop in order to\r\nget the money she wanted without the least intention to hold to the\r\nother side of the bargain, or to run into a war with Germany in order to\r\ngratify the feelings of revenge which animated the French nation?\r\n\r\nParis had turned out _en masse_ to see the royal entry. It was a little\r\nafter ten o’clock when the report of the guns of Mont Valérien announced\r\nthe arrival of the Imperial train at the Ranelagh station. Immediately\r\nthe crowd began to cheer, long before they caught sight of the troops\r\nwhich escorted the carriage in which the Emperor and Empress, with the\r\nPresident, were driving. The French Government had chosen these troops\r\nwith great care, and given the preference to the Spahis and Arabs from\r\nAlgeria, whose picturesque costumes and white burnouses added to the\r\ngeneral splendour of the brilliant scene.\r\n\r\nIt was an event without precedent, this recognition by the only\r\nautocratic Monarch left in Europe, of a Republic from which hitherto\r\nforeign Sovereigns had more or less held aloof. It was bound to create a\r\ndeep sensation, not only in France, but throughout the world; and its\r\nconsequences promised at that moment to become stupendous. In reality\r\nthey were absolutely insignificant, and France certainly played the part\r\nof the dupe in this queer comedy.\r\n\r\nBut it was not of this that Paris was thinking as it welcomed its\r\nRussian ally. When the mob saw the Empress, pale and lovely, in her\r\nwhite dress, with an immense bouquet of flowers reposing in her lap, as\r\nshe sat beside her Consort, who wore the dark green tunic of the\r\nPreobragensky Regiment, with the red ribbon of the Legion of Honour\r\nacross his breast, its joy overstepped all bounds; it was more like a\r\ndelirium of mad enthusiasm than anything else. But it was in the Place\r\nde la Concorde that the manifestations became quite grandiose. And I\r\nmust say that of all the popular demonstrations I have ever witnessed it\r\nwas the most imposing. Row upon row of human beings were massed like\r\nshots in a cartridge, which seemed suddenly on the passage of the\r\nImperial carriage to explode into one single shout, whilst opposite,\r\nunder the waving flags and banners on the terrace of the Tuileries, long\r\nlines of officers in uniform stood looking on the scene over the heads\r\nof the crowd. The statues were covered with human beings, boys and men\r\nwho had climbed upon them to have a better view of the procession.\r\n\r\nOnly one, that of the town of Strasburg, was undecorated, and its\r\nbareness seemed more than suggestive to the impartial spectator. When M.\r\nFélix Faure pointed it out to the Emperor the acclamations of the mob\r\nbecame deafening. It was a triumph indeed, and if you had asked any one\r\nof these people why they were howling away their enthusiasm and joy,\r\nthey would each and all have replied that it meant “Une Alsace\r\nFrançaise,” and that by his visit to Paris Nicholas II. was tacitly\r\npromising it to the French people.\r\n\r\nThe only one who appeared unconscious of the significance attributed to\r\nhis visit was the Emperor himself. Perhaps he knew that whatever people\r\nmight think, he was not going to risk the life of even one of his\r\nsoldiers in order to gratify the wild hatred of France against his\r\nGerman neighbours; perhaps, also, he was merely amused by the bright\r\nscene that stretched itself before his eyes; or, maybe, he was thinking\r\nthat it would have been a good thing had his own subjects showed such\r\ndemonstrative joy whenever he showed himself in the streets of his own\r\ncapital. It was something new to him to see the whole population of a\r\ngreat city let loose without police surveillance--at least, none that\r\nwas apparent; a vast multitude who seemed only eager to catch one of his\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\nLater on, however, a few discordant notes were heard, even before the\r\nTsar had left Paris. For one thing, the most rabid Radicals reproached\r\nNicholas with having called personally on M. Loubet, President of the\r\nSenate, and M. Brisson, President of the Chamber of Deputies. These\r\nvisits were not in the programme of the journey, and people said that by\r\nmaking them the Emperor was identifying himself with the political\r\nopinions of these personages, which were held in suspicion by the\r\nSocialists, who had already become very powerful at that time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Conservatives were quite indignant to hear that\r\nat the reception given in his honour at the Hotel de Ville, Nicholas II.\r\nhad cordially shaken by the hand a municipal councillor, who in long\r\nbygone days had made himself conspicuous by sending an address of\r\ncongratulation to Hartmann, one of the assassins of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nThen, to crown all, the leaders of French society and of the Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain, who had been invited to meet the Russian Sovereigns at a\r\nlunch given by Baron and Baroness de Mohrenheim, felt sadly chagrined\r\nthat neither the Emperor nor the Empress had thought fit to address a\r\nsingle word to any of them, though there were present such great ladies\r\nas the Duchesse d’Uzès, the Duchesse de Luynes, and Madame Aimery de la\r\nRochefoucauld.\r\n\r\nBut all these criticisms proceeded from the few. The many and the masses\r\nfelt more than gratified at the unexpected honour which had fallen upon\r\nFrance. The enthusiasm was especially great after the toasts exchanged\r\nat Chalons between the Tsar and the French President, and to give an\r\nidea of the illusions which at that particular moment seized the whole\r\nFrench nation, with but very few exceptions, I will reproduce here a\r\nletter which I received one or two days after the departure of the\r\nRussian visitors from a political man who, by virtue of his official\r\nposition, ought to have been able to judge of the consequences which\r\nthis effervescence of the French public mind might have in the future,\r\nand which proves under what strange misconceptions some people were\r\nlabouring:\r\n\r\n“I am not at all of your opinion when you tell me that you deplore the\r\nfacility with which the French nation has prostrated itself at the feet\r\nof the Cossack. What wind coming from the perfidious shores of Albion\r\ncould have made you say such a thing? First of all, he is not a Cossack,\r\nthis young Emperor of yours. On the contrary, he produces, together with\r\nhis fair Egeria, an immense impression of greatness, seen, as he has\r\nbeen here, in the full sunlight of our intensive French civilisation,\r\nwith his little girl in the background. As for the French crowds, they\r\nhaven’t, believe me, prostrated themselves before him; they have only\r\nexchanged a long and passionate embrace with Russia; that is, with a\r\nEurope independent of the Prussian Empire. In this triumphal march of an\r\nImperator towards our pseudo-Republican capital, the oldest and most\r\nexperienced crowned foxes the world has ever seen have found their\r\nTarpeian rock. Your young Imperial ephebe has emerged out of it\r\nadmirably. Nothing that he has done has been out of place; he has shown\r\nsimplicity, cordiality, good taste, tact, and everything, in short, that\r\nhe ought to have done, without one single false note to mar the concert.\r\nIn his place, William II. would only have shown the weight of his sword\r\nand invited us to test it. Nicholas II. is above all this, and has\r\nproved himself of stronger stuff. It is because, in the present case,\r\nthe comedians, who generally act in presence of Her Majesty Humanity,\r\nare put to shame by another and newer spectacle, which is far more\r\npowerful than the old scene upon which they had been used to play since\r\ntime immemorial.\r\n\r\n“In spite of everything, real life will overthrow the false limits into\r\nwhich one has tried to confine it, and the Treaty of Frankfurt will\r\nshare the fate of those of Paris in 1815 and of Westphalia. It was only\r\nreal life that could have been strong enough to accomplish this superb\r\neffort, and to set itself up on the ruins of that old mischievous\r\ndiplomacy which has produced that snake with three heads called the\r\nTriple Alliance.\r\n\r\n“Only two nations could possibly have performed this miracle, and could\r\nhave risen against the slavery in which, until now, Europe has been held\r\nin the bondage of the infernal policy of Prince Bismarck. He is the only\r\nreal Cossack in the sense we generally attribute to that word, the\r\nCossack before whom France, even when he vanquished her, has refused to\r\nprostrate herself, and against whom she has risen with sufficient\r\ncourage and sufficient strength to deliver from his yoke both Russia and\r\nthe dynasty of Romanoff, and to snatch it from the sphere of Prussian\r\ninfluence. Our two nations have married each other without the help of\r\nany notary, and without the need for any written treaty, and their union\r\nmeans peace, real peace, against general war which Bismarck wanted to\r\ntransform into a _status quo_. This is civilisation in the highest\r\nsense, and Europe owes it not to the fact that France has prostrated\r\nherself before Russia, but to the energetic manner in which the former\r\nhas tried and succeeded in establishing its military strength, and\r\nredeeming its lost military prestige.”\r\n\r\nI have transcribed this curious letter in its entirety, as it can give,\r\nbetter than anything else, an idea as to the state of feeling which was\r\nprevailing in Paris in the autumn of the year 1896, when, for the first\r\ntime since the fall of the Empire of the Napoleons, a foreign monarch\r\nwas officially received with enthusiastic welcome within the doors of\r\nthe capital. The enthusiasm was as false as the visit itself, but it\r\ncannot be denied that it gave greater stability to the Republic and\r\nconsiderably discouraged its enemies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, nearly a whole year passed before M. Faure returned this\r\nmemorable visit, and accomplished his passionate desire by being\r\nwelcomed on Russian shores in his capacity of head of the French\r\nRepublic. He arrived at Peterhof on a French man-of-war, escorted by a\r\nnumerous and powerful squadron, and was received with a cordiality that\r\nmust have considerably increased any illusions he may have had\r\nconcerning the sincerity of the Russian alliance. St. Petersburg showed\r\nunusual enthusiasm, and the Imperial family treated him with a\r\nfamiliarity that must have ravished his parvenu heart. As he wrote to\r\none of his friends in Paris, he held on his knees the little Grand\r\nDuchess Olga, to whom he had brought the most splendid present of dolls\r\nany Imperial child ever received, and the fact of having thus nursed in\r\nhis arms the youngest member of the Romanoff family evidently appealed\r\nto his feelings. He began to think himself equal to all these crowned\r\nheads with whom he found himself so unexpectedly thrown into contact,\r\nand to believe himself the real Sovereign of France.\r\n\r\nIt was dating from this famous visit that M. Faure assumed the\r\nsemi-royal manners which considerably displeased many of his former\r\nfriends, and caused him to be ridiculed more than he deserved in the\r\npopular cafés chantants of Paris. And, strange though it may appear, the\r\nreal popularity which M. Faure had enjoyed until the period of his\r\nreturn from Russia began to wane. The public reproached him for not\r\nhaving made the most of his opportunities and for having forgotten, in\r\nhis childish joy at the grandeur and magnificence of the reception\r\nawarded to him, the real object of his visit. Disappointment at the\r\nfailure to convince Nicholas II. of the necessity of immediately\r\ndeclaring war on Germany began to make itself felt among the French\r\nnation, and, little by little, both the influence of M. Faure and the\r\nsympathy for Russia began to disappear among the public, which realised\r\nthat all the fuss proceeded from the simple desire on the part of Russia\r\nto get the money she wanted at a cheap rate.\r\n\r\nI had been away on leave for a few months when I returned to France, and\r\non the very day I reached Paris I happened to meet the person from whom\r\nI had received a year before the letter which I have reproduced. I could\r\nnot help asking him whether he still was of the opinion which he had\r\nprofessed when he had written to me that enthusiastic anticipation of\r\nthe establishment of a solid alliance between France and Russia for the\r\nspecial purpose of a joint attack against Germany.\r\n\r\nI found him furious against M. Faure, to whom he attributed the delay.\r\nAnother President, he asserted, would have laid down positive conditions\r\nbefore he had consented to pay a visit to Peterhof, and made it\r\nsubservient to a promise of immediately beginning hostilities against\r\nGermany. When I objected that, in common courtesy, M. Faure could not\r\nhave excused himself from accepting the invitation that he had received\r\npersonally from the Russian Emperor, my friend replied in those\r\ncharacteristic words: “Je ne vois pas la nécessité de cela, au\r\ncontraire, M. Faure aurait souligné la dignité de la France, en prouvant\r\nqu’elle ne se dérange pas pour rien” (“I do not see the necessity for\r\nit; on the contrary, M. Faure would have given a proof of the dignity\r\nwhich prevails in France if he had shown that she does not put herself\r\nout for nothing”).\r\n\r\nThis phrase, coming as it did from a man who was at the period playing\r\nan important part in French politics, will give an idea as to the\r\nopinions which began to prevail against M. Faure.\r\n\r\nThe Dreyfus affair, which began at that period, intensified it. He did\r\nnot, however, live to realise this. He seriously believed himself to be\r\nthe right man in the right place, which, in a certain sense, he was,\r\nbecause of all the Presidents who have held office during the forty odd\r\nyears of the existence of the Third Republic in France, he was, perhaps,\r\nthe only one that contrived to give it the illusion of a monarchy.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been written concerning the sudden death of M. Félix\r\nFaure. It is unfortunately certain that it took place under much to be\r\ndeplored circumstances. It is also certain that the manner of his death\r\nhas thrown upon his memory an unpleasant shade.\r\n\r\nAlas! alas! poor Yorick. In a Republican country the abuses of monarchy\r\ncan but too often be met with, and in the case of M. Félix Faure these\r\ncame very prominently to the front. He played at being a small King,\r\neven so far as to allow, in a Republican country, the establishment of\r\nthe old custom of there being always “une favorite de roi” at his side.\r\n\r\nBut I must say once I am touching on that subject that I do not believe\r\nfor a moment the assertions of the lady in question, that M. Faure used\r\nto consult her in political matters, and that she had great influence\r\nover him in that respect. M. Faure was an exceedingly shrewd politician,\r\nand knew perfectly well what he was about. He was also perfectly aware\r\nthat he had numerous enemies who, if they had been able once to prove\r\nthat he was confiding gravest matters of State to the discretion of\r\nanother, would not have hesitated to make use of this fact to overthrow\r\nhim, or at least to put him in such a position that he would have been\r\nobliged to send in his resignation. And M. Faure cared for his position\r\nas President of the French Republic, and would not have jeopardised it\r\nfor anything in the world, least of all for a woman.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was as well for his own sake that death removed him from the\r\npolitical scene, before the curtain fell on the final act in the Dreyfus\r\ndrama. What he would have done had he seen all that ensued after the\r\ndiscovery of the forgery of Colonel Henry, the knowledge of which made\r\nhim so unhappy, and after the second condemnation of Captain Dreyfus at\r\nRennes, it is difficult to say. Those who have known him well, told me\r\nthat he had been very much troubled at the development this miserable\r\nbusiness took so unexpectedly, and that he often regretted that he had\r\nnot interfered and pardoned Dreyfus at the time of this first\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nIt seems that he had been very much tempted to do so, having always had\r\nsome doubts in his own mind as to the Captain’s culpability, but the\r\nPresident was also aware that his own popularity was on the wane, and\r\nthat voices had already accused him of trying to make up to the German\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nThis last fact deserves a few words of explanation. Some enemies of M.\r\nFaure had spread the gossip that his St. Petersburg laurels had not been\r\nsufficient for his inordinate vanity, and that as, in spite of all his\r\nconversations with Nicholas II. he had not succeeded in inducing the\r\nlatter to consent to the adoption by Russia of an aggressive policy\r\nagainst Germany, he had tried to bring about some kind of arrangement\r\nwith the German Emperor, and to persuade him to grant autonomy to Alsace\r\nand Lorraine. He knew that such a measure would have largely satisfied a\r\ncertain section of public opinion in France. Serious politicians,\r\nhowever, knew very well that it was useless to hope that Germany would\r\nreturn without another war, and perhaps not even then, the provinces she\r\nhad conquered at the cost of such stupendous sacrifices.\r\n\r\nWhether M. Félix Faure ever nursed such a dream, it is difficult to say,\r\nbut it was attributed to him, and for an excitable people like the\r\nFrench such a rumour was sufficient to set the tide against the\r\nPresident. Had he at that juncture pardoned Captain Dreyfus the outcry\r\nwould have been immense, and the word traitor would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen applied to him. He knew it well, and perhaps this made him keep\r\nmore aloof than he ought to have done from the net of intrigues which\r\nsurrounded the tragedy of the Hebrew officer who was to draw on his\r\nperson the attention of the whole world. But it is also to be regretted,\r\nperhaps, that the President found himself with his hands tied on this\r\nmemorable occasion, and that in his dread of losing his position he\r\nforgot his constitutional prerogatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the visit of Nicholas II. to Paris the press played a considerable\r\npart. Indeed in no country of the world do newspapers wield such an\r\ninfluence as they do in France, where the bourgeois, the workman, and\r\nthe peasant believe implicitly in what the papers say, especially if his\r\nparticular news-sheet has the chauvinistic opinions which he himself\r\nespouses. It would hardly have been possible to organise the magnificent\r\nreception which was awarded to the Emperor of Russia, if newspapers of\r\nall shades had not contributed to it their long articles written in\r\npraise of the future visitor and in general of the Russian nation and\r\nthe Russian army. These were material factors in securing the popular\r\ndemonstration that took place. Thanks to them the Russian loans were\r\ncovered several times over, and Russian policy, be it in the East or\r\nelsewhere, was warmly supported by the powers that ruled at the Quai\r\nd’Orsay.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs at that time was M. Gabriel Hanotaux,\r\nhimself a writer of no mean talent, and a journalist in his spare\r\nmoments. A few years later he was to be elected to the Academy for his\r\nfine work on the life of Cardinal Richelieu. M. Hanotaux was an\r\nexcessively shrewd man, and moreover one who had a vast knowledge of the\r\nworld; he understood better than anyone else the use to which the press,\r\nand especially the daily press, can be put. He organised a special\r\nservice which kept the whole of France informed as to the doings and\r\nsayings of the Russian Sovereigns, and was clever enough to give a\r\nspontaneous character to the vast manifestation of sympathy which threw\r\nFrance into the arms of Russia.\r\n\r\nI don’t remember now who said, very wittily one must admit, that “each\r\ncountry and each epoch has the press which it deserves.” That phrase is\r\nfar from being the paradox it seems, because it is an undeniable fact,\r\nand particularly so in France, that though the press leads public\r\nopinion, yet it is public opinion which leads the press into the road\r\nwhere its instincts--political or financial--tell it to go. And in the\r\nlast twenty-five years the French, and especially the Parisian, press\r\nhas undergone a total transformation. It is no longer what it was in the\r\ntime of the Second Empire, when the restraining hand of the government\r\nwas always more or less over its head. At present independence reigns\r\namong the papers that rule the boulevards, though this does not prevent\r\nthe principal among them from accepting the inspirations which come\r\neither from the Quai d’Orsay or from the Place Beauveau. In the latter\r\nplace, journalists had a good time of it during the few months when M.\r\nClemenceau, the most brilliant among them, reigned as its master, and\r\ndid not disdain to communicate to the press his views and his opinions\r\non one or other of the questions of the day. The _Matin_, the _Journal_,\r\nthe _Débats_, and especially the _Temps_, like to entertain their\r\nreaders in an atmosphere favourable to the ministry which happens to be\r\nin power. The last-named paper has upon its staff men of the rarest\r\nliterary merit, among others M. Tardieu, who writes the leaders on\r\nforeign affairs and of whom Prince von Bülow once said jokingly that\r\nthere “existed in Europe three great Powers and--M. Tardieu.”\r\n\r\nThat opinion had been endorsed long before it was uttered by M. Adrien\r\nHébrard, the greatest journalist that France can boast, and of whom she\r\ncan justly be proud. M. Hébrard, if he had only wished it, might have\r\nbecome an important political personage, a minister, a member of the\r\nFrench Academy, but to all these glories he preferred the editorship of\r\nthe _Temps_.\r\n\r\nThe paper is Republican in its opinions, with sometimes a leaning\r\ntowards Radicalism, and stronger leanings still towards\r\nanti-Clericalism. At the same time, it has constantly displayed coolness\r\nin its judgments, and has always abstained from exaggerations either in\r\none sense or the other. It has never failed in courtesy towards its\r\nantagonists, and has made itself respected, even when it has caused\r\nitself to be disliked. Everyone in political or social circles reads it\r\nwith interest, and very often the news which it gives _en dernière\r\nheure_, as it is called, has a European importance, and is cabled all\r\nover the world. Its chronicles also are something more than those of\r\nother papers, and its dramatic weekly letter decides the success or\r\nfailure of every new theatrical piece which sees the footlights of the\r\nprincipal Paris theatres.\r\n\r\nAnother serious paper, whose importance is almost as great as that of\r\nthe _Temps_, is the old _Journal des Débats_, which is considered the\r\norgan of the Academy, and which certainly has always the last word to\r\nsay concerning its elections.\r\n\r\nIn the _Débats_ correct polished French is always to be found. It is\r\ngrave, pompous, essentially bourgeois in its opinions, and is not read\r\nby the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe three great organs that have acquired front-rank importance are\r\ncertainly the _Matin_, the _Journal_, its rival in everything, even in\r\nimpudence, and the _Petit Parisien_. You will find many people in Paris\r\nwho do not know the _Temps_, except that they have seen it in the\r\nnewspaper kiosks, you will find a great many more who do not know even\r\nthat much about the _Débats_, but you will never come across any man or\r\nwoman, to begin with your concierge, and to end with the foremost\r\npolitician in the Chamber, who does not know the _Matin_ and its chief\r\neditor and proprietor, M. Alfred Edwards, of Lanthelme fame. In the\r\nopinion of many the _Matin_ is not a credit to French journalism.\r\n\r\nMore popular even than the _Matin_ are the _Journal_ and the _Petit\r\nParisien_, whose proprietor, M. Jean Dupuy, has already been several\r\ntimes entrusted with a ministerial portfolio, and is a member of the\r\nSenate, where his opinion is always listened to with attention. The\r\n_Petit Parisien_ has many editions, and is extensively read in the\r\nprovinces. It instils into millions of people the Radical opinions which\r\nit professes.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why everybody who can wield a pen in France turns to\r\njournalism nowadays lies in this knowledge that it leads to anything one\r\nlikes--and principally to politics, after which every Frenchman craves.\r\nIn olden times every young man wanted to become a member of the Bar,\r\npersuaded that the Bar alone could lead him to the Chamber and thence to\r\nbecome a member of the government. At present journalists have it all\r\ntheir own way. I won’t pretend to say that the change is by any means to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe general tone of the press lacks sadly of sympathy. Journalists like\r\nM. Hébrard become rarer and rarer every day. The press is no longer a\r\ntribune, it is something like the servants’ hall of political life, and\r\nthough its successes are greater than they have ever been they are not\r\nlasting, and they are forgotten the very next hour after they have\r\nreached their culminating height.\r\n\r\nPolitics, thanks to this degeneration, have become a hurried, feverish\r\noccupation, are more talked about than discussed, more felt than acted\r\nupon. Ministries, too, change far too often for France to work out her\r\nregeneration with anything like stability, and at present she is obliged\r\nto lean upon Russia, because only in so doing can she have any hope of\r\nremaining a Great Power.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few great journalists left on the banks of the\r\nSeine, and I am sure that no one will contradict me when I say that one\r\nof the first places among the few is occupied by that remarkable man,\r\nArthur Meyer, the son of a Jewish tailor and the grandson of a rabbi,\r\nwho by a strange freak of destiny has become the most fervent supporter\r\nof both Monarchy and Catholicism. He was associated with Boulanger and\r\nalso with that most ardent of anti-Semites, Edouard Drumont, and, after\r\nhaving become the friend, adviser, and counsellor of the Comte de Paris,\r\nwho had replaced Napoleon III. in his affections, succeeded in being\r\nadmitted into the intimacy of the Duchesse d’Uzès and the noblest great\r\nladies of the noble Faubourg, where at last he found himself a wife in\r\nthe person of the charming but dowerless daughter of the Comte and\r\nComtesse de Turenne.\r\n\r\nSuch a career is one of the most curious products of our times, and\r\nstranger still than its success is the fact that no one, save a few bad\r\ntempered people whose opinions do not count and to whom no one listens,\r\nhas ever expressed the least astonishment at its development. Paris has\r\naccepted M. Arthur Meyer just as it accepted the Republic and the\r\ninstitution of the Concours Hippique; and Parisian society has acquired\r\nthe habit of turning to him not only for news but also for the manner in\r\nwhich it ought to be received. He has become an oracle among certain\r\ncircles, and his whiskers, his ties, and the shape and cut of his\r\nclothes are copied not only by fashionable men but also by fashionable\r\ntailors. The morning coat of M. Meyer has replaced the frock coat of the\r\nPrince de Sagan, and the dinner-jacket of King Edward VII.\r\n\r\nI quoted at the beginning the remark that every country has the press\r\nwhich it deserves. I can complete it by saying that every society has\r\nthe leader that it merits. And Parisian fashionable circles can boast of\r\nhaving kept M. Arthur Meyer, though circumstances compelled it to lose\r\nCount Boni de Castellane.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the marriage of this favourite of the gods. People\r\nwondered at it excessively, but it would be extremely unfair to M. Meyer\r\nnot to maintain that he decided to ask for the hand of Mademoiselle de\r\nTurenne under circumstances that were entirely to his honour. The young\r\ngirl belonged to a family just as illustrious as it was poor, and though\r\nshe had very rich relations, none of them attempted to do anything in\r\nher favour nor even to try to marry her in her own sphere. Arthur Meyer\r\nwas a frequent visitor at the house of her parents, and had many\r\nopportunities of watching the revolts of a youthful mind disgusted at\r\nwhat it perceived of the injustices of the world. One day she told him\r\nthat she did not know what she could do to escape the misery of her\r\nexistence, adding that she knew that only two roads were open to her,\r\neither a convent or the free life of a woman who had put aside all\r\nprejudices and the principles in which she had been reared. “And,” she\r\nadded, “I don’t want to become a nun, I have not got the courage to\r\nleave the society to which I belong, and I would never commit suicide. I\r\nhave often wondered what I could do.”\r\n\r\nMeyer was above all chivalrous, and the despair of that young and lovely\r\nwoman touched him deeply. He did not love her, and he knew very well\r\nthat she could feel no love for him, but he asked her to become his\r\nwife, and, after some hesitation, she accepted his offer. Of course\r\nsociety rose up in arms when it heard about it, but nevertheless neither\r\nher uncle, Count Louis de Turenne, nor her aunt, the Marquise de\r\nNicolai, whose wealth could be counted by millions, ever tried by making\r\nher a small dowry to give her the chance of marrying within her own\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nAnd so, one fine autumn day, the son of a little Jewish tailor became\r\nthe husband of a girl whose ancestry had helped in the making of some of\r\nthe most glorious pages in the history of France. Verily, life holds\r\nstrange surprises in reserve for those who care to watch it.\r\n\r\nArthur Meyer is altogether a curious type both as a man and as a\r\njournalist. One cannot help liking him even when one does not sympathise\r\nwith his opinions, or with his person. He is an anomaly in everything,\r\nand no one would ever feel surprised at anything he might do or say. He\r\nhas certainly forsaken his race and his creed, yet so thoroughly has he\r\nsucceeded in impressing those who know him with his good qualities that\r\nhe has never been repulsed for the light-heartedness with which he has\r\nburned the boats of his faith.\r\n\r\nM. Arthur Meyer is the proprietor of the _Gaulois_, the fashionable\r\norgan of fashionable Paris, of the upper ten thousand who constitute\r\nParisian society, that motley crowd in which unfortunately money is the\r\nonly passport needed to ensure an entrance. It has one rival, the\r\n_Figaro_. The _Figaro_ is extremely well informed, has contributors of\r\ngreat talent, and is as eminently respectable as that kind of paper can\r\nbe which devotes a large part to gossip more or less good-natured. But\r\nit is no longer what that king among journalists, Villemessant, had made\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOf papers in which popular passions are constantly appealed to, and in\r\nwhich one only seeks the criticism of the existing government, only one,\r\nthe _Presse_, deserves more than a passing mention, and that only\r\nbecause its editor was M. Henri Rochefort, who up to his death in 1913\r\nalways wrote the leading article which figures at the head of the paper.\r\nM. Rochefort was one of the most extraordinary productions of modern\r\njournalism, to which he gave a direction that had been unknown until he\r\ninitiated it. His talent, which was essentially critical, bordering on\r\nsatire when it did not frankly take that tinge, procured for him a\r\ncelebrity which spread far and wide beyond the frontiers of France.\r\n\r\nNo one ever succeeded as he did in finding words that appealed to the\r\nmob, and which in a few words expressed so much. His _Lanterne_\r\ncontributed more than anything else to the fall of the Empire, and\r\nNapoleon III., who knew humanity perhaps better than anyone else, did\r\nnot despise him as an adversary, although his importance was denied by\r\nNapoleon’s ministers and entourage, who advised him to pay no notice to\r\nthe weekly attacks of the _Lanterne_ against his person and his\r\ngovernment. One day M. Rouher tried to minimise the influence of that\r\nsheet, saying that though people read it, its attacks were despised. The\r\nEmperor replied that he knew it, but, he added, “I am also aware that\r\nthere exist women whom we despise but to whom, nevertheless, we pay\r\nattention.”\r\n\r\nThere was a deep meaning in this simple phrase. Certain it was that all\r\nreasonable and well-thinking people despised the attacks against\r\neverything that others held sacred in which the Marquis de Rochefort\r\nLuçay continually indulged, but nevertheless the seeds blossomed in\r\ntime; indeed, no one more than himself contributed to discredit\r\nauthority. By this Rochefort became the idol of the Parisian masses, and\r\nremained its favourite until his death.\r\n\r\nI was very fond of M. Rochefort, and used to find great pleasure in\r\nspending a few hours in his company whenever I found an opportunity.\r\nNothing could be more amusing than his conversation; the mixture of\r\ncynicism and irony that now and then came out in brilliant paradoxes\r\nfull of wit if devoid of common sense, constituted something quite\r\nunique, which was bound to appeal to the imagination of his listeners,\r\nand make them smile even when they felt a sense of distaste.\r\n\r\nHe believed in nothing, not even in himself; respected nothing, loved\r\nnothing, but liked many things--his collections, his pictures, his work,\r\nthe influence which he imagined that he wielded around him, and which in\r\nreality was not so considerable as he thought. And he never hesitated\r\nbefore uttering one of his bon mots, or writing one of his bitter\r\nscathing articles, even when he was perfectly aware that by doing so he\r\nwas hurting innocent people--people who had done no wrong, and who had\r\nonly incurred his displeasure by being either related or connected with\r\nthose who had become the subject of his criticism.\r\n\r\nThe best description that one can make of M. Rochefort would be that he\r\nwas “perfectly unscrupulous,” and if he were still living I do not think\r\nhe would deny that this was so. Rather, he would glory in it, because,\r\nas he once told me, “Dans ce monde il faut toujours mordre, ne fut ce\r\nque pour ôter aux autres la possibilité d’en faire autant avec vous”\r\n(“In this world one must always bite, if only to prevent others doing\r\nthe same to you”). One could have replied to this remark that there are\r\nsome mortal and some insignificant bites, and that it was not always the\r\nlatter that he indulged in.\r\n\r\nA curious peculiarity of M. Rochefort was that, fierce Republican though\r\nhe pretended to be, yet he was inordinately fond of his name and of his\r\ntitle, and a servant who would forget to call him Monsieur le Marquis\r\nwould be dismissed instantly. Bereft of his parents, and so without\r\nexperience of the affection of home life, his earliest days were most\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nUntil he attempted journalism he had been a subordinate clerk at the\r\nHotel de Ville, earning barely enough to keep body and soul together. He\r\nnever forgot this period of his existence, and, whenever he allowed\r\nhimself to speak about it, a bitterness showed itself which he could not\r\nkeep within bounds.\r\n\r\nOne day, alluding to those dark and hopeless times, when he had spent\r\nmany hours scribbling at some wearisome task, he said to me: “It is\r\nimpossible for anyone who has not undergone it to imagine what it feels\r\nlike to see the spring and not be able to get out of doors.” The remark\r\nappeared to me almost too poetic to be the expression of a real feeling,\r\nbut when I told him so, he replied quite earnestly: “Evidently you have\r\nnever experienced what it is to know that you are a drudge, although\r\npossessing the inner feeling that you are born to better things.” I\r\ncould not help then inquiring what his feelings had been when he was in\r\nprison, to which he exclaimed: “Oh, that was very different, one always\r\ncomes out of prison, but sometimes one never escapes from the necessity\r\nof earning one’s bread and butter by copying the stupidities which other\r\npeople have written.”\r\n\r\nBefore he died in July, 1913, the Marquis de Rochefort Luçay was a\r\nquasi-millionaire, the owner of one of the handsomest houses in all\r\nParis, received everywhere that he cared to go, a desired guest, and an\r\nenvied journalist. Even in his later days his pen was as sharp as ever,\r\nthough perhaps it was no longer appreciated as was the case in the later\r\ndays of the Empire.\r\n\r\nHe was often to be seen at the Hotel Drouot, attending the principal art\r\nsales of the year, where his knowledge of pictures and bibelots was\r\nhighly appreciated. His life was like a fairy tale in many things, and\r\nin others like a dark nightmare. He made many foes, and kept few\r\nfriends. Appearing to be everlastingly dissatisfied, he was yet one of\r\nthe happiest men in the world--perhaps because he was one of the most\r\nselfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY OF M. LOUBET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of M. Félix Faure took France greatly by surprise; the\r\nappointment of his successor astonished it even more. M. Loubet was\r\nPresident of the Senate, it is true, but his name had figured among\r\nthose who had been mentioned in connection with the Panama scandal. This\r\nlast fact was put forward by some people when the question arose of the\r\ncandidature of M. Rouvier for the Presidency of the Republic, and caused\r\nit to be rejected. No one imagined, therefore, that it would be\r\ndisregarded in the case of M. Loubet. He had many rivals, among them M.\r\nBrisson, M. de Freycinet, whose name came forward regularly whenever a\r\nPresidential election was about to take place, and the above-mentioned\r\nM. Rouvier. This candidate possessed a powerful personality and wielded\r\nan immense influence; his experience had been varied, and his\r\nintelligence was certainly one of the foremost in France. Had he been\r\nelected to the Presidency his appointment would have been received with\r\ngreat favour in Europe. On the other hand, M. Loubet was more or less an\r\nunknown person, supposed to be inoffensive and retiring, but possessed\r\nof a most violent anti-Clericalism, of which he had given every possible\r\nproof, in the hope that by these means he would make himself a _persona\r\ngrata_ with the Radical party, through whom he had secured the\r\nPresidency of the Senate, an office which hitherto had constituted the\r\n_summum bonum_ of his ambitions.\r\n\r\nHe had no wish to become President of the Republic, and it was with\r\ngreat reluctance he allowed his name to be put forward as a candidate.\r\nBut he was under the influence of, or, what is even truer, dependent\r\nupon, M. Clemenceau. M. Clemenceau had lately come forward with\r\nconsiderable energy, especially since the Dreyfus affair once more was\r\nin the public mind, and he was such a considerable personage among the\r\nRadical party that they could not afford to disregard his orders or even\r\nhis personal wishes.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau was the Henri Rochefort of political life, with far more\r\nintelligence and almost as much wit as the director of the _Lanterne_,\r\nwith an extraordinary force of character, very determined ideas, and\r\nabout as few convictions as were indispensable to a man who had risen to\r\nthe leadership of a powerful party. Moreover, he had real statesmanlike\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nHe had no great sympathy for the Russian alliance, which his ever-ready\r\nwit had quickly discerned, when all was said and done, to be a very\r\none-sided affair.\r\n\r\nHis sympathies were entirely English, and as such it was but natural he\r\nshould not look with enchanted eyes upon a policy that was bound, by its\r\nclose association with the diplomacy pursued on the banks of the Neva,\r\nto become antagonistic to that of the Court of St. James’s. Perhaps it\r\nwas for this very reason that he pushed forward the candidature of M.\r\nLoubet.\r\n\r\nHe felt, or rather he knew, that M. Loubet had had nothing to do with\r\nthe visit of the Tsar to Paris beyond receiving him when he called at\r\nthe Luxembourg in defiance of etiquette and precedent.\r\n\r\nWith a friend of his at the Elysée, the position of M. Clemenceau was\r\nperhaps even stronger than if he himself had been established within its\r\nwalls. He had always admired the personality of Père Joseph, so well\r\nknown in the history of France as the adviser and counsellor of\r\nRichelieu. He intended playing the same part; to govern under M.\r\nLoubet’s name as far as the constitution allowed him, to govern the\r\nRepublic which he secretly despised, but to which he clung, because he\r\nknew that it was the only government under which he could do absolutely\r\nwhat he liked.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau had taken a sincere liking to a very attractive and very\r\nbeautiful lady. He is still on terms of great friendship with her,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that she is no longer young, and that white\r\nlocks have taken the place of her golden curls. She is an American, the\r\ndaughter of that Colonel Burdan who invented the rifle which still bears\r\nhis name. She had married a French diplomat, the Comte d’Aunay, and was\r\nnoted in her youth for her extraordinary loveliness. Mme. d’Aunay was\r\nambitious above everything, and her great dream was to see her husband\r\nbecome an Ambassador. She imagined that M. Clemenceau could help her to\r\nrealise her one ambition, and she then set herself to win his friendship\r\nfor herself and for her husband. The task was easy enough for a woman\r\ngifted with such beauty and such remarkable intelligence, and though the\r\nworld chatted not a little--as so often it does without\r\nfoundation--concerning this friendship, yet secretly it envied her for\r\nher cleverness in having won him as a well-wisher. Then one day came the\r\ncrash and the blighting of the fair Countess’s hopes. The French\r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs became alarmed at the marvellous way in\r\nwhich M. Clemenceau was kept informed of what was going on in diplomatic\r\ncircles at Copenhagen, where Count d’Aunay was accredited as French\r\nMinister, and wondered how he could be in possession of the most secret\r\ninformation before even it became known at the Quai d’Orsay. Inquiries\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. M. F. SADI-CARNOT\r\n\r\n(President 1887-1894)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. J. P. P. CASIMIR PÉRIER\r\n\r\n(President 1894-1895)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. F. F. FAURE\r\n\r\n(President 1895-1899)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. E. LOUBET\r\n\r\n(President 1899-1906)]\r\n\r\n_All photos, Petit, Paris._\r\n\r\nwere instituted which resulted in the resignation of certain parties.\r\n\r\nIt was partly Mme. d’Aunay who was responsible for the English\r\nsympathies of M. Clemenceau; she had lived in London for a long time,\r\nhad made many good friends, and also won still more admirers. She was\r\nambitious to have her husband appointed to the British capital as\r\nAmbassador for the French Republic, and she did her best to persuade M.\r\nClemenceau to set his back against the Russian alliance.\r\n\r\nThe great Radical leader did not ask anything else, but he was very well\r\naware that to go against the popular feeling was quite useless and\r\nhopeless, and might even cause his own patriotism to be suspected. But\r\nhe knew also that French people are apt to lose their illusions as\r\nquickly as they come under their influence, and so he quietly waited for\r\nthe course of events to justify the words of warning he had uttered to\r\nthe few friends before whom he could talk quite openly.\r\n\r\nWhen he favoured the candidature of M. Loubet to the Chief Magistracy of\r\nthe Republic, he had his plan quite ready, together with a programme\r\nwhich included an alliance with England and a rupture with the Vatican.\r\nPapal influence he dreaded the more in that he knew that in Pope Leo\r\nXIII. he had an opponent just as shrewd as he was himself, one who would\r\nconsent to the greatest sacrifices in order to keep upon good terms with\r\nthe Republic. To this last the Radical party was not at all agreeable,\r\nand consequently it was indispensable that he should assure himself of\r\nthe sympathies of the President, whoever he might be, in order not to be\r\nthwarted secretly in his designs as earlier he had been by M. Félix\r\nFaure, whose policy had been far more personal than the world was\r\npermitted to guess.\r\n\r\nI happened to be at Versailles on the day of the election of M. Loubet.\r\nAn hour before the result became known bets were still being taken\r\nconcerning the chances he had to be elected. M. Rouvier was distinctly\r\nfavoured, and probabilities pointed to M. Brisson making a close run. I\r\nwas lunching at the Hotel des Réservoirs with some friends, of whom\r\nHenri Rochefort was one, when suddenly M. Clemenceau came by. He was\r\ninstantly surrounded by a group of journalists eager to hear his opinion\r\nas to who would win. He laughingly parried their questions, saying that\r\nthe only thing he was sure of was that Clemenceau would not be President\r\nof the Republic, to which Rochefort remarked in an undertone that he\r\nwould not need to be, as it would be his candidate who would occupy that\r\npost.\r\n\r\nM. Loubet was elected, and at once the Dreyfus affair took a new turn.\r\nAfter a struggle, in which the government yielded almost without\r\nfighting, the unfortunate captain was brought back to France, and his\r\nre-trial took place at Rennes, with the result known to everybody, and\r\nfor which M. Clemenceau deserves the thanks of his compatriots as well\r\nas of posterity, because anything more iniquitous than this affair has\r\nnever disgraced a country.\r\n\r\nMost emphatically of all the politicians who were prominent in France at\r\nthe time of the election of M. Loubet, M. Clemenceau was the shrewdest\r\nand also the most far-seeing. He had perceived that even had Captain\r\nDreyfus been guilty, it would be to the advantage of France for him to\r\nbe declared innocent, and also that so long as that bone of contention\r\nwas left to the enemies of the Republic, they would expend all their\r\nefforts in using it as a weapon to discredit not only the form of\r\ngovernment they disliked, but also to shame France herself.\r\n\r\nOne cannot say that the Elysée improved as regarded its inner life under\r\nthe Presidency of M. Loubet. The pomp and grandeur introduced by M.\r\nFélix Faure were reduced to a minimum, and existence began to resemble\r\nthe one led by M. and Mme. Jules Grévy, with perhaps a shade more\r\nelegance, but without any luxury, save what was absolutely necessary.\r\nMadame Loubet rarely went out in anything else but a modest brougham\r\ndrawn by one horse, and she avoided everything that could be construed\r\nas love of ostentation or luxury. On the other hand, she was extremely\r\ncharitable, and, with the exception of the Maréchale MacMahon, no wife\r\nof a President of the Republic did more for the welfare of the poor of\r\nParis, and by them she was literally worshipped. She was totally devoid\r\nof affectation, and never tried to pose for what she was not, or to play\r\nat being the great lady by birth as well as by position. Everyone liked\r\nand respected her. Such was not the case with M. Loubet, in whom some\r\npeople saw a nonentity and others merely a puppet in the hands of M.\r\nClemenceau and his friends.\r\n\r\nDuring his tenure of office the new President paid several visits\r\nabroad, among others to St. Petersburg, London, and Rome. With the\r\nexception of the one to London, it cannot be said that his journeys were\r\nsuccessful. In Russia people were getting just a little tired of the\r\nperpetual ovations which had been allowed to take place in favour of\r\nFrance and the French alliance. The Japanese question was already\r\nengrossing the public mind, and it was vaguely felt in the country,\r\nwhatever one may have thought at the Foreign Office, that somehow France\r\nhad failed in her friendship for her ally of the other day in the Far\r\nEast, and had not sufficiently upheld her pretensions in the many\r\nentangled questions which had sprung up in consequence of the fatal\r\npolicy of Admiral Alexieff and his friends.\r\n\r\nThe entire misunderstanding which had prevailed at the demonstrative\r\nFranco-Russian alliance was becoming more apparent every day;\r\nessentially it had been based on the desire of each of the signatories\r\nto get as much as possible out of the other. France had fully expected\r\nthat she would be given the opportunity of recovering Alsace and\r\nLorraine, and Russia had only seen the possibility of borrowing, under\r\nfavourable conditions, the money she wanted. As time had gone by Russia\r\nhad found out that French bankers were just as exacting as were German\r\nbankers, while France had discovered that her interests were dear to\r\nRussia only insomuch as they did not clash or interfere with her own. A\r\ncertain coolness had sprung up between them, though in Paris as well as\r\nin St. Petersburg politicians and journalists were eagerly seizing every\r\nopportunity to declare that the alliance was stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances the journey of M. Loubet to St. Petersburg\r\nmight have been pleasant, but could not have been very useful. In London\r\nit was different. He found there many sympathisers and well-wishers who\r\nwere only too desirous of accentuating the good relations of France with\r\nGreat Britain. To begin with King Edward and to end with the man in the\r\nstreet, they all vied with each other to show the greatest cordiality to\r\nthe President and to make him welcome in the fullest sense of the word.\r\nWhen M. Loubet returned to Paris he could say with pride and\r\nsatisfaction that the old rivalries which had divided the two countries\r\nhad been buried under the flowers which had ornamented the dining-table\r\nin the Waterloo Hall of Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nThe Roman trip of the President, though conducted on simpler lines than\r\nthose of his English journey, was perhaps the most important event of M.\r\nLoubet’s septenary. It distinctly proclaimed the attitude which the\r\nFrench Government meant to adopt in regard to the religious question and\r\nto its relations with the Vatican. The guest of the Italian King at the\r\nQuirinal, M. Loubet did not think it necessary to follow the example set\r\nby all the other foreign monarchs who visited Rome by going from the\r\nhouse of the Ambassador to the Holy See, as a neutral place, to visit\r\nthe Pope at the Vatican. The courtesy paid to the head of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church by the German Crown Prince, and later on by the German\r\nEmperor, was deemed to be beneath the dignity of the President of the\r\nFrench Republic; and when the government was asked in the Chamber what\r\nM. Loubet meant to do in regard to this question of a visit to the Pope,\r\nit replied that it had been decided that the President should refrain.\r\n\r\nSoon after this relations were entirely suspended between the Holy See\r\nand the French Republic, and the separation between Church and State\r\nbecame an accomplished fact. M. Loubet had not failed in the confidence\r\nwhich M. Clemenceau and the Radical party had reposed in him.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of this septenary of a gentle and yielding little\r\nbourgeois was the establishing of the regular and automatic change of\r\nPresidents--a rule which gave to the Republic a stability which hitherto\r\nit had been wanting. M. Thiers had been overturned; Marshal MacMahon and\r\nM. Grévy had been obliged to resign; M. Carnot had been murdered, and M.\r\nFaure had died suddenly, whilst M. Casimir Périer had grown impatient at\r\nthe restraint to which he found his faculties subjected. It was only\r\ndating from M. Loubet that the transmission of the supreme power became\r\nan accomplished fact, and that at last the Republic, as well as a\r\nMonarchy, had its Sovereigns whose reign was followed by that of their\r\nduly elected successors.\r\n\r\nDuring his Presidency, too, the components of Paris society changed\r\nconsiderably. New salons sprang up which aspired to replace the older\r\nones, and in a certain sense they succeeded in doing so. The bourgeoisie\r\nwhich Loubet represented so well came to the front, and the newspapers,\r\nwhich hitherto had carefully noted the sayings and doings of the Duchess\r\nof So-and-So and the Countess of So-and-So, began to chronicle those of\r\nMadame Ménard Dorian or of Madame Alphonse Daudet, or of the wives and\r\ndaughters of members and supporters of the government. Thus a new\r\nsociety began to play its part in Parisian social life, and soon\r\nentirely pervaded it. Financial houses, too, opened wide their doors to\r\nall who cared to enter, and whilst formerly the Rothschilds had been\r\nalmost the only bankers with whom the old French nobility had cared to\r\nassociate, dozens of Jews now invaded Parisian society. The distinction\r\nwhich used to exist formerly between the _noblesse_ and what it had\r\ncalled disdainfully “les roturiers” had entirely disappeared under the\r\nglamour which millions always exert over the imagination of the crowds.\r\nIt was felt that money was the principal thing required, and under this\r\ninfluence the Hebrew and the American element had a fine time of it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to write anything about Parisian society nowadays\r\nwithout saying something concerning M. de Castellane. For a few brief\r\nyears he incarnated in his person the acme of French elegance, and was\r\nthe _fleur des pois_ of all the smart clubs of Paris. He was a terrible\r\nlittle fop who aspired only to one thing: to be the most talked-about\r\nman of his generation. When he married Miss Gould, he fondly imagined\r\nthat this marriage gave him the right to do everything he liked, down to\r\nill-treating his wife. He began buying right and left everything that\r\ncaught his fancy, and built for himself a palace after the model of the\r\nPetit Trianon; he made Paris ring with his extravagances, and pretended\r\nto assume the part of the one supreme leader of society. Even the many\r\nmillions which his wife had brought to him proved insufficient; and very\r\nsoon his horses, his vagaries, his losses at cards, and his general\r\nbehaviour brought about a financial catastrophe, which was the prelude\r\nto a conjugal one. Mme. de Castellane became tired of being outraged at\r\nevery step, and sued for a divorce, which was easily awarded to her.\r\n\r\nAnyone in de Castellane’s place would have resigned himself to the\r\ninevitable, but instead, he threatened to take the children from her.\r\nMadame de Castellane behaved nobly on this trying occasion. She might\r\neasily have retaliated, and she had got plenty of proofs which she could\r\nhave produced that would have for ever compromised the Comte de\r\nCastellane and other people with him. She never made use of that power,\r\nand as her advocate, M. Albert Clemenceau--the brother of M. Georges\r\nClemenceau--eloquently said: “My client has her hands full, but she\r\ndisdains to open them in order to harm the man who, after all, is the\r\nfather of her children!”\r\n\r\nThe Countess came out of this painful ordeal with flying colours. Her\r\nchildren were left in her charge, notwithstanding all the efforts of M.\r\nde Castellane. Soon after her divorce was pronounced she married a\r\ncousin of her former husband, the Duc de Talleyrand, the son of the\r\nfamous Prince de Sagan. The couple lead a very quiet life in the palace\r\nerected by Count Boni, and at the Château de Marais, a splendid property\r\nwhich they possess not far from Paris. The Faubourg St. Germain, not\r\napproving of divorces, has turned the cold shoulder upon them, which\r\nfact does not trouble them much. They are happy in themselves, and the\r\nDuchess must often congratulate herself on her moral courage, of which\r\nshe gave proof when she decided to seek her freedom from an ill-assorted\r\nunion which had brought to her nothing but unhappiness and sorrow. As\r\nfor M. de Castellane, he vegetates in an obscurity which must be doubly\r\npainful to him when he remembers the luxury in which he spent a few\r\nshort years, and which he lost through his own vanity and stupidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE DREYFUS AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Paris at first began talking about the high treason of Captain\r\nDreyfus, people did not take much notice; it seemed to be but one of\r\nmany such. The public was more or less used to events of the kind, and\r\ndid not give them more than a passing thought. I happened, however, to\r\nknow some friends of the Dreyfus family, and, calling on one of them, I\r\nwas not very much surprised to hear him declare that the Captain was\r\ninnocent--the victim of an intrigue. Such language was perfectly natural\r\non the part of relatives of the accused man, but these denials were also\r\naccompanied by several details which gave them more importance than,\r\nunder different conditions, would have been legitimate.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I heard the name of Colonel Esterhazy as one who\r\ncould have said a lot concerning this intricate affair had he cared to\r\ndo so, and the impression left upon my mind by the conversation which I\r\nhad on that day was strong enough to inspire me with the desire to be\r\npresent at the coming trial. Consequently, I requested and, after\r\ndifficulty, obtained from the War Office permission to be present.\r\n\r\nI had never seen Captain Dreyfus before the day when I beheld him\r\nsitting in the dock listening to the evidence on the strength of which\r\nhe was to be sent to the Devil’s Island for five long years. I must say\r\nthat his appearance did not draw out the sympathy of any onlooker who\r\ndid not give himself the trouble to watch his countenance attentively.\r\nIndeed, had his appearance been more prepossessing, he would perhaps\r\nhave met with more indulgence than was the case. But in the whole of my\r\nlong life I have never seen a man with more strength of character and\r\nmore power to keep his personal emotions under control. Not a muscle of\r\nhis face moved during the time that witness after witness spoke of his\r\npresumed guilt; his eyes never fired up, even when he heard himself\r\naccused of a crime that he had never committed. The only words he spoke\r\nwere uttered in a low tone, in which weariness more than anything else\r\nwas apparent, and he never said anything else but the phrase, “Je suis\r\ninnocent.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was impossible to look at him and not to realise that this\r\nindifferent man, whom nothing seemed to move, who had not even the\r\nstrength to protest indignantly against the accusation hurled at him,\r\nwas enduring a perfect martyrdom; that his apparent calmness was the\r\ncalmness of despair. He knew too well that he could not prove his\r\ninnocence, that he had been made the victim of other people’s guilt, and\r\nthat he was being crushed by the wheels of a Juggernaut, moved along by\r\nah inexorable fate. Once he started, and that was when sentence was\r\npronounced against him, and when the words, “dégradation militaire,”\r\nresounded in the room. A feeling of revolt appeared to shake him, and he\r\nmade a gesture as if he wanted to rush forward; but it lasted only a\r\nsecond, and then he lapsed into his usual apathy, as if he had\r\nunderstood that his protest would only have added to the bitter feelings\r\nof revenge which the public manifested against him.\r\n\r\nAfter judgment had been pronounced I had the opportunity of speaking to\r\none of those who had given the verdict. I asked him whether he really\r\nbelieved in the Captain’s guilt. The officer shrugged his shoulders and\r\nreplied: “It is difficult to say. Treason has taken place; and, after\r\nall, it is better to assert that a Jew has been guilty than to fix it on\r\na Frenchman.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that these words gave the key to the undercurrents of\r\n_l’affaire Dreyfus_. Some people, whether sincerely or otherwise,\r\nbelieved that treason had been committed, and finding that it became\r\nincumbent to fix it on someone, preferred to take a Jew as a victim than\r\none of their own brethren in race and faith.\r\n\r\nAt the time the affair began anti-Semitism was already very powerful in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nDrumont had published his famous books, each rendered so stupid in one\r\nsense by the pertinacity with which he called a Jew every person whom he\r\nthought he had a reason for disliking; and so dangerous in another\r\nsense, by the way in which he appealed to all the evil instincts of the\r\nmob, and urged it to rise against people whose only guilt consisted in\r\nbeing rich.\r\n\r\nThe Clerical party especially did all that was in its power to fan the\r\nhatred against Jews, which had always existed in a greater or lesser\r\ndegree. It accused them of inspiring all the anti-Clerical measures\r\nadopted by the various governments which had succeeded one another in\r\nthe country. Also, it was foolish enough to seize the pretext of the\r\nDreyfus affair to associate anti-Semitism with the question of the\r\nCaptain’s guilt or innocence, and thereby to excite public opinion\r\nagainst the Jews in general, more even than against the Captain himself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Radical party, which was gaining adherents every\r\nday, was delighted to be able to secure the support of the Jews in its\r\nstruggle against Clericalism. They, therefore, hastened to accuse the\r\nClericals of trying to prove the Captain guilty in order to be able to\r\ntrace some association between his supposed guilt and the actions of\r\nthe numerous rich Hebrews in France.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that at the beginning of the campaign which was started\r\nin favour of Dreyfus, when someone asked M. Clemenceau what he thought\r\nabout the whole affair, the Radical leader replied that he did not know\r\nyet what there was in it, but that he saw it could become an admirable\r\nweapon in the hands of the different political parties which existed in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThat weapon no one better understood how to use than he did. His great\r\nambition had always been to become Prime Minister, if not President, of\r\nFrance, but so far he had not seen any possibility of realising his\r\ndream. The Dreyfus affair gave him the opportunity he sought, and he was\r\nnot the man to allow it to slip.\r\n\r\nHe engineered the whole campaign begun by M. Scheurer Kestner, when he\r\nproclaimed aloud that he had obtained the proofs of the innocence of\r\nCaptain Alfred Dreyfus; he encouraged M. Zola to write his famous\r\nletter, “I accuse”; he gave all the benefit of his experience to those\r\nwhom he sent fighting for the cause which he considered to be more his\r\nthan anyone else’s, and in the end he reaped the reward of his\r\nunremitting zeal. To the Dreyfus case he owed finally the Premiership of\r\nFrance, a post which he had coveted all his life, and on the wave of\r\nthis affair he would have been elected President of the Republic had he\r\nnot found an adversary of importance in M. Briand, whom he himself had\r\nhelped to come to the front without suspecting that he could become his\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nA curious feature in the Dreyfus campaign was the celerity with which it\r\nbecame a personal matter with those who took part in it. One and all\r\nsought in its intricacies their own advantage, more than anything else,\r\nand the Captain was very soon forgotten. Having been the pretext for\r\nfurthering innumerable personal ambitions, he was scarcely remembered\r\nwhilst the fight for his rehabilitation lasted.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of what I have just said, I will relate an amusing\r\nincident. After the trial at Rennes, and when it became known that\r\nPresident Loubet had pardoned Dreyfus, I was dining one evening with a\r\nlady, Madame de----, whose salon had been one of the strongholds of the\r\nDreyfusards. Of course, the affair was discussed. Someone remarked that\r\nit was a pity that the accused man had not been acquitted, as it would\r\nhave put an end to the whole sad and, in many points, sordid business,\r\nwhereon our hostess exclaimed, “Oh, no, it is not a pity; fancy how sad\r\nit would be if we had not a pretext for carrying it farther!”\r\n\r\nThis hasty retort, which I am sure Madame de ---- regretted later on,\r\nrepresented the opinion of most of the partisans of Dreyfus; they forgot\r\nentirely the personal feelings of the victim of this injustice of\r\npolitical passion, and only sought in the agitation the furtherance of\r\ntheir own schemes and intrigues.\r\n\r\nThis Dreyfus campaign completely hypnotised every person who was drawn\r\ninto its intricacies. Towards its close, I do not think that even among\r\nthe principal actors of the drama one could have found one man or woman\r\nwho really understood it, or who could speak of it without allowing\r\ntheir personal interest to interfere with the opinions held.\r\n\r\nAs for the real circumstances attending this curious episode in the\r\nhistory of modern France, I do not think that they will ever be known.\r\nIt is certain that among some of the adversaries of Dreyfus there were\r\nseveral sincere people who believed that he was guilty. There were also\r\nothers, quite as earnest, who professed the erroneous conviction, that\r\nonce a mistake had been made this mistake ought not, for the honour of\r\nthe army and for that of its generals, to be admitted. Of course, this\r\nwas a point of view which could never be accepted by anyone calling\r\nhimself honest, but, in a certain sense, it can be understood though\r\nnever excused.\r\n\r\nOnly the severest condemnation can be given to the means by which it was\r\nendeavoured to prove Dreyfus guilty, the hideous way in which each one\r\namong all those upon whom his fate depended not only refused to\r\nacknowledge error, but, on the contrary, tried everything that could be\r\nthought of in order to uphold the false theories as to his guilt.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the agitation for the new trial lasted, I had more\r\nthan one opportunity of discussing the innocence of Dreyfus with several\r\nofficers holding high commands, and I was horrified to observe the\r\ncynical way in which they tried to explain to me that it was\r\nindispensable that the decision of the Paris court-martial should be\r\nconfirmed. When I asked them why, they always replied the same thing:\r\n“Les arrêts d’un conseil de guerre, ne peuvent être critiqués, cela leur\r\nenleverait toute autorité sur l’armée dans l’avenir.” (“The decisions of\r\na court-martial can never be criticised; it would deprive them of all\r\ntheir authority over the army in the future.”)\r\n\r\nI have never been able to make them understand that, however important\r\nthe evidence, a court-martial can be mistaken just as well as other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable side of the Dreyfus agitation is the rapid way in\r\nwhich it subsided and was forgotten, as soon as the Captain was\r\nrehabilitated, and granted the Cross of the Legion of Honour as a reward\r\nfor his long sufferings. With the exception of a few people, such as\r\nMadame Zola and her immediate friends, all those who had taken a leading\r\npart in the struggle did everything that they could to induce the world\r\nto forget. M. Clemenceau himself was the prime mover in the general\r\ndesire to consign to oblivion this episode in the political life of the\r\nday. The latter, when he became Prime Minister, buried Zola in the\r\nPanthéon. The event was the occasion of a new misfortune for the\r\nill-starred Captain Dreyfus, inasmuch as a Royalist and Clerical\r\npartisan seized this opportunity to fire at him a shot which slightly\r\nwounded him. The incident nearly gave rise to a panic among the\r\nassistants, who thought that a bomb had been thrown at President\r\nFallières and the members of the government who were present at the\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nHaving paid this last homage to the writer who had lent the help of his\r\npowerful pen to the cause which he had so ardently championed, M.\r\nClemenceau hastened to hide in the tomb of Zola every remembrance of the\r\nDreyfus affair, although by it he had realised his every ambition. It\r\nhad given him a popularity among French politicians of his generation\r\nwhich earlier he had been unable to obtain; it had posed him before the\r\nworld as something more than a clever man (which reputation he bore)--as\r\na real statesman, able to treat on a footing of equality the statesmen\r\nof Europe--and it had paved his way to the Presidency of the Republic,\r\nthat goal of his ambitions. Now all his desire was to drive away from\r\nthe mind of the public the memory of the political campaign in which he\r\nhad taken such a prominent part.\r\n\r\nAfter burying in the Panthéon the mortal remains of the great author\r\nwhom he had succeeded in persuading that it was his duty to protest in\r\nthe name of France against the iniquity that had sent Captain Dreyfus in\r\nexile to Devil’s Island, M. Clemenceau considered himself free from\r\nfurther obligations toward those who had been associated with him in the\r\ntask of bringing Captain Dreyfus back to France, and restoring him to\r\nhis family. He saw no reason to continue to meet them, and when Emile\r\nZola’s daughter married one of his former secretaries, he refrained from\r\nassisting at the ceremony under the plea of ill-health, an excuse which\r\nappeared to be the more out of place seeing that it was announced in the\r\npapers that on that very day he had gone into the country for the\r\nshooting. The Prime Minister did not care that the world should think he\r\nremained faithful to those associations which had had for their only\r\nexcuse the political necessities of the moment.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau was one of many persons who had seen in the Dreyfus affair\r\nthe possibility of becoming either famous or powerful through the energy\r\nwith which they defended his cause. Many of the minor satellites had\r\nlooked to it in order to emerge from the obscurity in which they would\r\notherwise have remained to the end of their days. There was hardly a\r\njournalist in Paris who did not try to pose either as a Dreyfusard or\r\nthe reverse; they became ferocious in their attacks according as their\r\nprofessed opinions differed. Everything which until that time had been\r\nconsidered sacred in France was dragged in the mire and became dirtier\r\nevery day. Priests forgot their sacred character; soldiers did not\r\nremember the honour of their flag; politicians renounced the creeds in\r\nwhich they had believed; respect disappeared from the hearts of men and\r\nfrom the actions of the nation. One can say that France came out of this\r\ntragedy dishonoured before the world--diminished in her own eyes.\r\n\r\nBut Radicalism grew stronger during the struggle which waged between the\r\nfriends and the adversaries of Dreyfus, and certainly it was owing to\r\nthis struggle that anti-militarism became so prominent in France. It was\r\nthis episode which taught the nation to despise the army and to rise\r\nagainst its discipline. From this point of view the campaign in favour\r\nof Captain Dreyfus did much harm to France, but from the moral viewpoint\r\nit is impossible not to admire the feeling of indignation which roused\r\nso many people against the injustice of a few. It is only a pity that\r\nthis indignation was so often but the mask under which lurked ambitions\r\nthat had nothing to do with the desire to see Captain Dreyfus righted.\r\n\r\nAmong all the people who were the actors in this drama, there are some\r\nwhom it is impossible to pass by. One of them is Colonel Esterhazy, that\r\ndark figure who from accuser became the defender of his colleague, who\r\ncertainly knew more about the hidden currents of the whole affair than\r\nanyone else, and who never spoke the truth about it, even when he turned\r\nupon his former superiors, perhaps because this truth would have been\r\neven more shameful for him than for those who had employed him.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to meet Esterhazy before the disgrace which overwhelmed\r\nhim after the Dreyfus trial. There was a time when he had been a dashing\r\ncavalry officer, much sought after in the most elegant of the many\r\nelegant salons of Paris. I had seen him at the Tuileries, dancing\r\n_vis-à-vis_ with the fair Empress who reigned there, and later on I had\r\nthe opportunity of watching him in several houses where we were both\r\nfrequent visitors. He was an amiable man, full of wit, and exceedingly\r\namusing in his conversation. As for his moral worth, no one troubled\r\nabout it at that period, and though from time to time scandal of some\r\nsort became associated with his name, no one could have believed him\r\ncapable of the dark deeds which later on stamped him with such a stigma\r\nof shame and unscrupulousness.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, a man who certainly was one of the most observant of his\r\ngeneration; Jules Ferry, who was not destined to see all the episodes\r\nwhich have rendered the Dreyfus affair so memorable, meeting Esterhazy\r\none evening, expressed to me, as we were going out together from the\r\nhospitable house where we had dined, the profound distrust with which\r\nthe brilliant officer inspired him. “C’est un homme capable de tout,”\r\nhe told me, and when I asked him what reasons he had for proffering such\r\na severe judgment on a man he did not know except superficially--“Look\r\nat his hands,” he said, “ce sont les mains d’un brigand.” Later, when I\r\nsaw Esterhazy during the Zola trial, I remembered these words, and\r\nglanced at the hands of the Colonel as he was giving evidence at the\r\nbar; they were repulsive in their shape, and certainly gave one the\r\nimpression of being the hands of a brigand.\r\n\r\nEsterhazy was the saddest of all the sad heroes of the Dreyfus affair,\r\nbecause the other sad actor in the drama, Colonel Henry, had at least\r\nthe courage to seek in death the expiation of his crime. There has been\r\nmuch talk about his suicide, and some people have expressed a doubt\r\nconcerning it, suggesting that it had been simulated, and that the\r\nColonel had simply been put out of the way, as he might have become\r\nrather an embarrassing witness. I hasten to say that I do not believe in\r\nthis version. Colonel Henry was a soldier, more imbued with military\r\ndiscipline than Esterhazy; he would not have been able to face the shame\r\nof a public trial, and his soldier’s soul would not have found the\r\ncourage to accuse those who had had the right to order him to do the\r\ndeed for which he was to lose his life, and his honour after death.\r\n\r\nWhen I say so, it is on the authority of another soldier who also had\r\nhad to do with the question of the guilt or innocence of Captain\r\nDreyfus, General de Pellieux. It was he who had read during the debates\r\nof the Zola trial, when the great writer had been sent before a jury to\r\nanswer to the accusation of having published his famous letter, “I\r\naccuse,” the false document manufactured by Henry. It is impossible to\r\ndeny that the General had done so in the full conviction that it was\r\ndecisive and would make the whole world share his own persuasion as to\r\nthe guilt of Dreyfus. When, later on, M. Cavaignac, who presided at the\r\nWar Office, had the loyalty to declare publicly that this document was\r\nnothing but a forgery, made for the purpose of preventing the revision\r\nof the trial of the unfortunate prisoner on Devil’s Island, General de\r\nPellieux was inconsolable. His grief was that anyone could believe he\r\nhad wanted to crush Dreyfus with the weight of an accusation which he\r\nhad known to be false, and it was whilst discussing with me later on all\r\nthe details of this unfortunate episode in his life that he told me his\r\nopinion about Colonel Henry, adding that he had not the slightest doubt\r\nas to the suicide of the unfortunate officer.\r\n\r\nAnother rather strange feature of the Dreyfus affair was the advantages\r\nwhich it procured to all the enemies of the Clerical party.\r\nUnfortunately for the Catholics and Legitimists in France, they took up\r\nthe most intransigent attitude in the question. They identified it with\r\nthe Catholic Church, and with its interests, and they thought to find in\r\nit the pretext for a crusade against the Jews and the Republicans,\r\ndeclaring publicly that it was only under a Radical government,\r\nprotecting the Israelites, that such an event as the so-called treason\r\nof Captain Dreyfus could have taken place. And among all the enemies of\r\nDreyfus, none was more ardent than Père du Lac, the famous Jesuit, in\r\nwhom the Republicans found their greatest and one of their most powerful\r\nadversaries. Another thing which must never be lost sight of when\r\ntalking about the Dreyfus affair is that no one among all his defenders\r\never gave a thought to Dreyfus himself. The feelings and sufferings of\r\nthe unfortunate man were always talked of, but those who continually\r\nharped upon them would have been extremely sorry had the government\r\ndecided to treat him well, or to forgive him for his supposed crime. And\r\none cannot understand how among all the ministers who were in power in\r\nFrance during the years which he spent in disgrace, not one tried to\r\nput an end to the agitation by inaugurating the re-trial which was to\r\nprove his innocence.\r\n\r\nI make no excuse for again calling attention to this fact, for I\r\nperceive that I am doing exactly the same thing myself; that, by talking\r\nabout the Dreyfus affair, I forget entirely its hero, who deserves\r\ncertainly more than a passing mention. I learned to know the Captain\r\nwell after his return to France, and I learned, also, to respect and\r\nesteem him. Any man in his place would have harboured feelings of the\r\nmost bitter resentment against those to whom he had owed such terrible\r\nsufferings. Dreyfus never once allowed an expression of anger to escape\r\nhis lips. He did not care to talk about the years of his trial, but when\r\nhe was forced to do so it was always in most measured terms, and without\r\nthe slightest shade of a revengeful spirit. He once told me that, as a\r\nsoldier, he could understand the feelings of those other soldiers who\r\nhad believed him capable of betraying his country, but he thought that\r\nhad he been in the place of his accusers, he would have taken greater\r\ncare to verify the accusation against a brother in arms than had been\r\ndone in his case. But whilst eager to see justice done to himself, he\r\nnever approved of the means that some people used in order to bring this\r\nabout. Dreyfus aspired only to one thing, and that was to be left in\r\npeace. He accepted the rehabilitation which was granted to him, but in\r\nhis innermost heart he regretted rather than otherwise that he had to\r\noccupy once more the attention of the world. Captain Dreyfus was always\r\nmodest and retiring in his disposition and character; it was just as\r\npainful to him to be praised as to be blamed.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, he returned from his exile a man of broken physique\r\nwith shattered nerve, and had he been able to do what he liked, he would\r\nhave retired somewhere in the country, far from the madding crowd, which\r\nhad in turns hissed and applauded him. He felt deeply grateful to all\r\nthose who had worked for his release, but it was painful to him to have\r\nto see them, to mingle once more among the world whose injustice he had\r\nnever forgotten.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dreyfus had an admirable wife, whose devotion has not been\r\nsufficiently appreciated by the public. She behaved heroically towards\r\nhim, the more so that she was not very happy with him before the\r\ncatastrophe that separated them for a while.\r\n\r\nJust before the Captain was arrested, his wife had applied for a divorce\r\nfrom him; but when she heard him accused, she immediately put an end to\r\nthe proceedings and devoted herself entirely to the task of his\r\nrehabilitation, sparing neither her health, nor her efforts, nor her\r\nmoney in order to obtain it.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at Rennes, she had only one thought, and that was to\r\nthrow herself into his arms. Now the couple live a most happy life, but\r\nthough Madame Dreyfus has entirely forgotten that in regard to her\r\nhusband she performed more than her duty, he always remembers it, and\r\nnothing could be more touching than to witness the reverence with which\r\nhe approaches her, or speaks about her. For once the absolute devotion\r\nand sacrifice of a noble woman met with gratitude, and was not in vain.\r\n\r\nIn general all the family of Captain Dreyfus has stood by him, with a\r\nloyalty beyond praise. Mathieu Dreyfus, his brother, did not allow the\r\nslightest opportunity to escape by which he could defend the accused\r\nman. He worked at it with a patience and an energy worthy of the highest\r\ncommendation, and never allowed himself to be discouraged in his\r\nefforts. It was he, also, who uttered the best definition of his\r\nbrother’s case. When asked once whether he did not feel happy in the\r\nknowledge that such a powerful party (to which belonged the most\r\ndistinguished men in France) had taken up the cause of Captain Dreyfus,\r\nhe replied that, of course, he could not but feel flattered by it, but\r\nthat perhaps his brother would have obtained the justice which was due\r\nto him sooner, if it had not been to the interest of so many people to\r\ndrag his case out as long as possible, in order to reap personal\r\nadvantages from it which they would never have obtained without the\r\nopportunity which he had given to them, at the cost of so much suffering\r\nand so much unnecessarily borne shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nPARISIAN SALONS UNDER THE THIRD REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Caillavet’s salon was certainly one of the most influential\r\namong political and literary men of the Third Republic. She was one of\r\nthe leading women of that period, was moreover an excellent hostess,\r\nand, thanks to the continual presence of Anatole France in her house,\r\nshe succeeded in attracting many notables to her salon. Journalists\r\ncomposed the majority of her visitors, and diplomats occasionally came\r\nto hear the last news of the day, especially whilst the Dreyfus\r\nagitation lasted. Dramatists were always to be found at her receptions,\r\ncolleagues of her son Gaston de Caillavet, the author of so many amusing\r\ncomedies, whose collaborator, the Marquis de Flers, the husband of\r\nSardou’s daughter, was also among the number of people who seldom missed\r\nthese friendly gatherings. But in spite of this, and notwithstanding the\r\nnumber of clever men and pretty and amiable women who clustered around\r\nher, to the eyes of a keen observer there was always something Bohemian\r\nabout her receptions. It was not the salon of a _grande dame_, and it\r\nwas no longer that of a bourgeoise of olden times: it was essentially\r\nmodern, like the Republic itself.\r\n\r\nFar different from it was the house of Madame Ménard Dorian, also one of\r\nthe feminine stars of the Republic. Madame Dorian was a charming woman,\r\nwho had received an excellent education, and who, coming as she did from\r\nan old bourgeois stock, never pretended to be aught else than what she\r\nwas by birth. She was extremely intelligent, very broad in her opinions,\r\nand with many advanced ideas in regard to religion and politics; above\r\neverything else, she was a lady in her manners, her general behaviour,\r\nand her tastes. Very rich, she possessed a lovely house in the Rue de la\r\nFaisanderie, which she had furnished with extreme taste and where she\r\nused to give receptions as sumptuous as they were pleasant.\r\n\r\nThere one could meet, together with some of those who frequented the\r\nsalon of Madame de Caillavet and other Republican hostesses of the same\r\nkind, persons belonging to other classes, and forming part of the\r\naristocratic circle of Paris. Academicians frequented it, and\r\ndiplomatists were generally eager to be introduced to Madame Ménard\r\nDorian, where they ran no risk of meeting people they would not have\r\ncared to become acquainted with, and where they could, on the other\r\nhand, get an idea as to what was going on in Republican circles. Madame\r\nDorian had been a Dreyfusard, but she had been so moderately and in a\r\nladylike way. Her salon was something like the one of Madame Geoffrin in\r\nthe eighteenth century, with the exception that no one would have dared\r\nto say about it what the Marquise du Deffand had told of the former,\r\nthat it was “une omelette au lard.” One gossiped in it, in a mild way,\r\nand became interested in the literary movement of the day, perhaps even\r\nmore than in the political one.\r\n\r\nM. Ménard Dorian used to put in an appearance at his wife’s receptions\r\nnow and then, when he was not too busy to do so. He was a quiet,\r\npleasant little man, liked by everybody, and especially by ladies, who\r\nalways found him most polite and amiable to them. An evening party or\r\ndinner given in the Hotel de la Rue de la Faisanderie was always sure to\r\nbe a meeting place for intelligent and clever people, and no one who had\r\nonce been asked ever regretted it, but on the contrary was always most\r\neager for the invitation to be repeated.\r\n\r\nM. Ménard Dorian is now dead, and his widow only sees her friends\r\noccasionally, and in a quiet fashion, having refrained from opening\r\nagain the hospitable doors of her house so freely as in former years.\r\nBut she has remained the same amiable woman she always was, and\r\ncertainly among the Republican ladies of the present day she deserves to\r\nrank first. She would have graced the Court of any European monarch.\r\n\r\nMadame Dorian had one daughter who had been married to Georges Hugo, the\r\ngrandson of Victor Hugo. That marriage ended in a catastrophe and a\r\ndivorce, after which the young Hugo married the first cousin of\r\nMademoiselle Dorian, who had attracted his fancy one morning when he had\r\nmet her at his mother-in-law’s, together with her husband, the sculptor\r\nAjalbert.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the charming Madame Dorian had a curious personality;\r\nshe seemed to take a vicious pleasure in thwarting her parents, and\r\nmaking herself disagreeable to them whenever she found the opportunity.\r\nShe occupied a flat in their house, the Hotel de la Rue de la\r\nFaisanderie, and on the evenings when her father and mother gave\r\nreceptions at which the partisans of Captain Dreyfus, such as Colonel,\r\nlater on General, Picquart, the Zolas, and their circle of friends were\r\nhonoured guests, Madame Hugo used to invite people such as Drumont and\r\nthe strongest anti-Semites of Paris, so that several times queer\r\nsituations arose, and the staunchest Dreyfusards entered by mistake the\r\napartment of one of their worst enemies, whilst one evening Henri\r\nRochefort himself, who for the world would not be seen at Madame Ménard\r\nDorian’s, was ushered into her drawing-room by a footman who did not\r\nknow him by sight.\r\n\r\nThat sort of thing, however, could not go on for any length of time, and\r\nwhen Pauline Hugo left the house of her parents, her departure was a\r\nrelief to them. But even after her marriage to Herman Paul, after her\r\ndivorce and Paul’s, she did not become reconciled to her father and\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nGeorges Hugo’s sister, Jeanne, was also a strange kind of person. She\r\nmarried when quite young, Leon Daudet, the son of Alphonse Daudet, and\r\nvery soon ran away from him with the explorer Charcot. It was said that\r\nDaudet was delighted when he divorced her, as they had scarcely been a\r\nsingle day without quarrelling since they married, and, although a\r\nfervent Catholic, he hastened to take to himself another wife.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Leon Daudet, Madame Alphonse Daudet, is also a celebrity\r\nin her way, and gives receptions at which the best society of Paris can\r\nbe met. She has entirely renounced her bourgeois origin, and only talks\r\nof Dukes and Duchesses. She labels herself a Clerical by conviction and\r\na Royalist by sympathy, and frequents the houses of great ladies, such\r\nas the Duchesse de Rohan or the Comtesse Mathieu de Noailles. Her second\r\nson, Lucien Daudet is a devoted admirer of the Empress Eugénie. Among\r\nRepublican hostesses I haven’t yet mentioned Madame Psichari, the\r\ndaughter of Ernest Renan. She has inherited the intelligence and the art\r\nof conversation of her father, and is one of the most distinguished\r\nwomen of modern France. At her house can be met most of the members of\r\nthe French Academy, and nearly all the prominent literary men in Paris.\r\nHer receptions are perhaps a shade dull, and more or less solemn, but\r\nalways instructive and always interesting. Her personality was always\r\nsingularly attractive, and inspired great respect, because her errors of\r\njudgment when they occurred were always sincere.\r\n\r\nMadame Psichari was one of the victims of the divorce mania that has\r\nlately taken hold of Parisian society, and, to the great astonishment of\r\nher numerous friends, after more than thirty years’ matrimony she\r\napplied for a decree. She had one son, who occupied for a few days the\r\nattention of Paris, when at twenty years old he married the daughter of\r\nAnatole France, nearly seventeen years his senior, to the chagrin of\r\nboth their families.\r\n\r\nMadame Zola, also, used to receive her friends on Saturdays in her\r\nlittle flat in the Rue de Rome. At her house could be met all the\r\nprincipal actors in the Dreyfus drama, including its hero. I must here\r\nmention one fact that is very little known, that Zola, far from making\r\nmoney out of the Dreyfus affair, as it was said everywhere that he had\r\ndone, lost a great deal by his attitude in regard to it. His novels,\r\ninstead of being read more than had been the case formerly, were on the\r\ncontrary boycotted, and several important papers for which he wrote\r\narticles, and which published his works before they came out in volume\r\nform, closed their doors to him after the letter “J’accuse,” for which\r\nhe was sent before a jury at first and to exile afterwards.\r\n\r\nEmile Zola died, relatively, a poor man, and his widow found herself\r\nreduced to almost embarrassed circumstances after his death. She sold a\r\ngreat deal of the furniture which he had collected, gave up to the State\r\nin return for a modest remuneration the villa of Médan, where he had\r\nlived for so many years, and arranged her existence on quite a different\r\nscale from that which had been her custom before her widowhood. Zola, as\r\nwell as Captain Dreyfus himself, were the only two people who did not\r\nprofit by the clamour which arose around them and around their actions.\r\n\r\nTalking about Dreyfus reminds me of an incident in his story which, so\r\nfar, I believe, has never been told. When he was languishing on the\r\nbarren rock called the Devil’s Island, a Russian who had had occasion to\r\napproach the Tsar spoke to Mathieu Dreyfus, the Captain’s brother, and\r\nadvised him to appeal to the Russian Sovereign to intercede in favour of\r\nthe Captain. Mathieu Dreyfus said that he would consult his\r\nsister-in-law, and reply in a few days. When these days had elapsed, he\r\ncame back and told the man who had made the proposition that neither\r\nMadame Dreyfus, nor himself, thought that they had the moral right to\r\napply to a foreign Monarch, or to ask his intervention in a case that\r\nwas too important for France not to allow her to dispose of it herself.\r\nIn general the dignity displayed by the whole Dreyfus family cannot\r\nsufficiently be praised; they all unanimously showed themselves superior\r\nto the misfortunes which assailed them.\r\n\r\nSo far all the hostesses of whom I have spoken were long past middle\r\nage, but there was another lady, young and beautiful, with a shade of\r\neccentricity in her manners, who also aspired to have a salon, and to be\r\nable to dictate to those who visited it, or at least to suggest to them\r\nthe opinions they ought to have. It was the Comtesse Mathieu de\r\nNoailles, a Roumanian by birth, coming from the family of the Princes of\r\nBrancovan, whose mother had been very well known in London, where her\r\nfather, Musurus Pasha, had occupied for long the post of Turkish\r\nAmbassador. The Princesse de Brancovan was one of the best musicians of\r\nher generation, and her wonderful talent for the piano was famous among\r\nher acquaintances. She had been handsome, and her daughters had\r\ninherited her loveliness as well as her intellectual gifts. The eldest\r\none, whose large dowry secured her an entrance into the ancient\r\naristocratic family of the Ducs de Noailles, has made for herself a name\r\namong the poets of modern France Her books have been widely read, and\r\nhave had a great success, which they deserved, because there was some\r\nreally genuine poetic inspiration in them. Madame de Noailles has\r\nsuccumbed to the vogue of eccentricity; she wears long floating white\r\ngarments which trail out behind and give her the appearance of a fairy\r\nfrom the children’s tales. She speaks languidly, as if sick of a world\r\nshe would really be very sorry to leave, and looks disdainfully at\r\nhumanity in general.\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse de Noailles used to give parties, during which she recited\r\nsome of her own poetry, and allowed her great friend and admirer, the\r\nComte Robert de Montesquieu, to read his. She did not trouble much about\r\nher guests, merely smiled on them when they arrived, and softly sighed\r\nwhen she saw them going away. She glided about her lovely rooms, as the\r\nghost of something too beautiful to be real, and she seemed to be\r\ninterested in nothing that did not concern her personally, or that had\r\nno association with her books or poems.\r\n\r\nHer receptions were singularly eclectic. Apart from the family, friends\r\nand relations of the Noailles, one met people who belonged to an\r\nentirely different grade--journalists, artists, politicians, even those\r\nof an advanced shade; members of the Republican government, and\r\ndiplomats or foreigners happening to be in Paris. She received them all\r\nwith the utmost grace, and liked to see them surround her, like the\r\nsatellites of her fame and of her high social position. In its way her\r\nvanity was as remarkable as it was charming.\r\n\r\nMadame de Noailles composed poems, the Comtesse de Greffuhle wrote\r\noperas and sonatas with decided talent. Madame de Greffuhle has played,\r\nand is playing still, a very important part in Parisian society. She was\r\nby birth a Princess de Chimay, and had married, without dower, the Count\r\nGreffuhle, whose fortune was supposed to be one of the largest in\r\nFrance, and had at once begun to exercise a considerable influence in\r\nthe circles in which she moved. She was beautiful, intelligent, had\r\ngreat tact, and a considerable knowledge of the world, liked to surround\r\nherself with artists and musicians, to organise exhibitions of works of\r\nart, and to help her neighbour as much as she could.\r\n\r\nHer salon was not the meeting-place of the pure Faubourg St. Germain,\r\nneither was it, on the other hand, exclusively Republican. But it\r\nafforded a neutral ground to men belonging to both parties, and her\r\nreceptions were never dull nor banal, but on the contrary always\r\ninteresting and pleasant. She possessed a lovely country place near\r\nParis, called Bois Boudran, where she entertained most sumptuously, and\r\nwhere she often welcomed foreign Sovereigns or members of Royal houses,\r\nwhen they happened to come to France. Madame de Greffuhle was a woman\r\nessentially made for society, who could never have lived outside it. She\r\ndescribed herself better than anyone else could have done one day when\r\nshe was asked to write her name on the visitors’ book of the Phare\r\nd’Ailly, near Dieppe, where some friends had taken her. She signed\r\n“Chimay Greffuhle, dame de qualité,” thus admitting that she had no\r\npretensions to be considered a _grande dame_.\r\n\r\nThe Baron Henri de Rothschild was also “un écrivain amateur,” with more\r\npretensions to literary talent than perhaps that talent deserved. He had\r\nmarried Mlle. Weiswiller, who is supposed to be one of the best-dressed\r\nwomen in Paris, and whose name appears prominently in all the chronicles\r\nof the _Figaro_ or the _Gaulois_. The couple entertain with the\r\nhospitality for which their family has always been famous, and the Baron\r\nhas made for himself a name among the benefactors of the Paris poor, for\r\nwhom he does a great deal. He has studied medicine and even practised it\r\nwith all the zeal of a millionaire who believes himself to have a\r\nvocation for some kind of science.\r\n\r\nBaron Henri is an exceedingly pleasant man, cultured, and well read,\r\ncapable of most entertaining conversation on a variety of topics. The\r\nreceptions which he gives, and of which his wife helps him to do the\r\nhonours with an exquisite grace, are the meeting-place of almost all the\r\ndistinguished men of scientific and literary Paris. Members of the\r\ngovernment can be met at them, but though his salon is known to be\r\nLiberal in its opinions, it is yet one at which politics have never\r\nplayed a part or been discussed. The guests succeeded in avoiding them\r\neven at the time of the Dreyfus affair, during which the Rothschilds\r\nadopted an entirely passive and impartial attitude.\r\n\r\nTalking of politics makes me think of a house where they were always\r\nvery prominent, and almost the only subject of conversation. It was the\r\nhouse of M. Rouvier, one of the ablest politicians whom France has seen\r\nin recent times, who had occupied, more than once, important State\r\npositions, and who was always spoken of, among his friends, as a\r\npossible President of the Republic. M. Rouvier’s was a most complicated\r\nmind. He had considerable capacity, an intelligence far above the\r\naverage, great ambition, and absolutely no vanity, perhaps because he\r\nhad a full consciousness of his strength and of his worth, in presence\r\nof the lesser intelligences with which he was surrounded.\r\n\r\nHe had made his way with the help of a good deal of luck, and perhaps\r\nmore determination than is generally met with. There was one moment in\r\nhis life when he nearly became one of the victims of the Panama scandal,\r\nbut he succeeded in emerging quite unharmed. As a financier, he very\r\nnearly approached genius, and when he left office almost all the large\r\nbanks in France entreated him to join their board. He became director of\r\na large financial establishment, which he managed with the intelligence\r\nand knowledge that he brought into everything which he attempted. But\r\nalthough he had many partisans and more friends than could have been\r\nexpected in a man who had held the difficult posts which he had\r\nsuccessfully occupied; though he was in a certain sense a sort of small\r\nking, feared by most of the politicians who ruled France or aspired to\r\ndo so, he always regretted that he had been obliged to retire from the\r\ngovernment of his country. When he died, he was about to put forward his\r\ncandidature to the Presidency of the Republic, in opposition to that of\r\nM. Poincaré or any other of the probable successors of M. Fallières at\r\nthe end of the latter’s septenary.\r\n\r\nM. Rouvier had been twice married. His first wife was the famous\r\nsculptor known as Claude Vignon, whose first husband was l’Abbé\r\nConstant, an unfrocked priest, who was later on to be so well known by\r\nthe name of Eliphas Lévy, and who was considered to be the greatest\r\nmaster in occult sciences that the world possessed. I met Eliphas Lévy\r\nmore than once, and I was always extremely interested in him. He had a\r\nmost venerable appearance, with his long white beard, and of all the\r\nindulgent men I have ever met he was the one who practised that virtue\r\nto the largest extent. He lived absorbed in his studies of high magic,\r\nbut would always carefully avoid talking on the subject, save with his\r\nmost intimate friends. He was called uncanny, I don’t know why, because\r\nhe certainly had the most peaceful countenance possible, but a certain\r\nprejudice used to cling to him or rather existed against him at the time\r\nI knew him; probably because the fact of a priest having given up his\r\nprofession appeared still to be something quite dreadful in France.\r\n\r\nMadame Constant, or Claude Vignon as she was generally called, had\r\ngreatly contributed to the unfrocking of her husband, but though he had\r\nloved her passionately, she had very soon tired of him, and the couple\r\nseparated, never to meet again so long as they lived. She married\r\nRouvier, to whom she brought the very large fortune she possessed, but\r\ndied not long after, leaving one son, with whom his father never could\r\nget along, and whom one never met at his house.\r\n\r\nThe second Madame Rouvier was a small, slight woman, with golden curls,\r\na most pleasant manner, and a charming conversationalist. She aided her\r\nhusband quite admirably, interested herself in his political career and\r\nsuccesses, and was perhaps even more ambitious than he. The couple lived\r\nin a splendid establishment which they possessed at Neuilly, on the\r\noutskirts of the Bois de Boulogne, where they often entertained, and\r\nwhere generally the latest news of the day was to be heard. No political\r\nman would have dared to ignore M. Rouvier and his wife, and their salon\r\nhas been more than once called the “succursale du Sénat,” of which he\r\nwas a member. Diplomats also were to be met in their house; and it was,\r\nindeed, frequented by almost everybody of note in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT TONE OF PARIS SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seen many changes take place in Paris during the twenty-five\r\nyears of my sojourn in the gay city. I cannot say that all these changes\r\nhave been congenial; the good manners for which Frenchmen were famous,\r\ncertainly disappeared simultaneously with the crinoline. A _laisser\r\naller_ has replaced the stiffness which at one time made the select\r\nParisian houses so difficult of access to the foreigner. At present the\r\nAmerican and Jewish elements have entirely invaded French society, and\r\nimported into it not only their easy ways but also an independence of\r\nspeech and action which would have horrified dowagers of olden times.\r\nSport also, which was formerly unknown, has absorbed the thoughts of\r\npeople who would not have dreamed of it a few years ago. Life in hotels\r\nhas done away with the intimacy of the home, and whereas formerly one\r\nonly invited to dine at a restaurant people one would not have cared to\r\nentertain in one’s own house, now it is the reverse, and those whom it\r\nis desired to honour are asked to lunch or to supper at the Ritz or the\r\nMeurice, or some other fashionable place of the same kind. The\r\nrefinement that was so essentially a French characteristic has entirely\r\ndisappeared. Women have grown loud, and men have become coarse, girls\r\nhave lost their modesty, and boys are impertinent. An altogether new\r\nworld has superseded that of the Second Empire.\r\n\r\nThe advent of American millionaires has aroused the desire to be able\r\nto emulate their luxury, and the introduction of Jews into the best\r\nFrench society, in spite of all the efforts of Drumont and other\r\nanti-Semites, has done away with the prejudice which existed against\r\nthem. Indeed, Jewish heiresses are sought as wives by bearers of some of\r\nthe oldest and most aristocratic names in France; Mlle. Ephrussi has\r\nbecome Princess de Lucinge; the Marquise de la Ferté Meun was Mlle.\r\nPorgès; the Princess Murat, the wife of the head of that house, is the\r\ngranddaughter of old Madame Heine, herself the only child of the banker\r\nFurtado; and the present Princesse de Monaco, whose first husband was\r\nthe Duc de Richelieu, is the daughter of another Heine, also a banker,\r\nwhose many millions she inherited.\r\n\r\nThese new elements entering society have necessarily transformed it.\r\nParis is now a vast hotel where are met all kinds of people, and no one\r\nfeels the necessity to observe etiquette or restraint. It is a place\r\nwhere the man who pays can obtain everything he wants. Excepting in a\r\nfew houses, as of old was that of Madame Aimery de la Rochefoucauld, one\r\ncan meet everywhere the representatives of Hebrew banking houses, or\r\ngreat tradesmen, whom Parisian hostesses are but too eager to invite to\r\ntheir balls or receptions, feeling sure that it will bring them some\r\nprofit in one shape or another. Money is the only thing that counts\r\nnowadays. It is so everywhere unfortunately, but in France it seems to\r\nbe more potent than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, society is perhaps smarter than it has ever been, but it\r\nis a great question whether it is so distinguished, and it is certain\r\nthat it is no longer so good-mannered.\r\n\r\nIf one examines things carefully, one cannot wonder at it. When the\r\nfirst heiresses to great fortunes, but to nothing else, were admitted\r\ninto the Faubourg St. Germain dowagers looked at them askance, and even\r\ntheir husbands seemed half ashamed to have been obliged to marry them.\r\nIt was but natural that, repulsed as it were by the people who ought to\r\nhave opened their arms to them, they should have turned towards those\r\nwho belonged to their own sphere. The _nouveaux_ were invited to their\r\nparties, at which the old aristocratic representatives of monarchical\r\nFrance were at first rather shy about putting in an appearance. But very\r\nsoon the _noblesse_ began to feel at home, and there met other heiresses\r\nwhom in their turn they were to take to their bosoms.\r\n\r\nThe leading hostesses in Paris at that time were the Duchesse de\r\nGrammont, née Rothschild; the Duchesse de Doudeauville, whose\r\ngrandmother was Madame Blanc of Monaco fame; the Comtesse Bernard de\r\nGontaut Biron, whose father, M. Cabibel, had not been one of Lyons’ best\r\ncitizens, though he had lived in that town all his life and made all his\r\nmoney there; the Comtesse de Trédern, who had been Mademoiselle Say, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nMoney did away with all the differences which formerly existed between\r\nthe various classes of society, and newspapers which began to make or to\r\nmar social reputations mentioned, as the most fashionable women in\r\nfashionable Paris, Madame Schneider of Creusot fame, Madame Pierre\r\nLebaudy, Madame Deutsch de la Meurthe, and the wives and daughters of\r\nevery banker or industrial whose millions had opened the doors of the\r\nsocial Eden into which a hundred years ago no one who was not an\r\naristocrat could ever have hoped to enter. Society became a haunt of\r\nmillionaires, even Monsieur Chauchard, the owner of the Grands Magasins\r\ndu Louvre, would have been admitted into it easily had he only lived\r\nlong enough.\r\n\r\nAutomobilism, which gave to so many representatives of the oldest names\r\nin France the opportunity to make money by fostering its popularity, and\r\nlending the support of their family connections to the numerous\r\nshareholders’ companies which sprang into existence at a minute’s\r\nnotice, contributed considerably also to what I would call the\r\ndemoralisation of good manners. Many people, in order to make money\r\nthrough this new kind of sport, associated with persons of a very low\r\nsocial and moral standard, or even simple mechanicians were admitted at\r\nfirst to the Automobile Club, and at last into the drawing-rooms of its\r\nmembers. Much had to be forgiven these parvenus of sport, many errors of\r\netiquette overlooked, but very soon all were forgetting themselves, and\r\ninstead of raising these people to its own level, society came down to\r\ntheirs. Ladies, who could more easily dispose of the tickets of the many\r\ncharitable lotteries, or theatre performances, which they patronised\r\namong these _nouveaux venus_ than in their own circle of acquaintances,\r\nand who, in case of necessity, could also apply to them for a small loan\r\nor the settlement of an angry dressmaker’s bill, were but too glad to\r\ninvite them to their receptions. So, little by little, the salons of the\r\nnoble ladies of the Faubourg St. Germain became a kind of succursale of\r\nthe “haute banque and haute finance” not only of Paris, but also of\r\nFrance and of New York.\r\n\r\nThere were some exceptions to this rule, but these were not frequent. I\r\nmust mention as one of these exceptions the Comtesse Jean de Montebello,\r\none of the loveliest, most charming, and most intelligent women that\r\nParis could boast. She was the daughter-in-law of that amiable Comtesse\r\nGustave de Montebello, who had been one of the favourite ladies in\r\nwaiting of the Empress Eugénie. She lived in the private hotel, which\r\nthe former had built for herself in the Rue Barbet de Jouiy, preserving\r\nall the old traditions that were associated with it, and maintaining the\r\ngrave, serious tone for which it had been famous during the Second\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nMadame Jean de Montebello is a true type of the great lady; her affable\r\nmanners, the perfect distinction which she shows in conversation, the\r\ninimitable grace and ease that accompanies every one of her movements,\r\nmakes her a delightful creature. Beautiful as a dream in her youth, in\r\nher old age she has kept the straight, classic features, the soft eyes,\r\nand the kind, joyous expression for which she has always been famous.\r\nHer wit is bright, without the least shade of ill-nature, and she is one\r\nof the very few Frenchwomen of the higher classes whose conversation and\r\nculture constitute an attraction strong enough to make one forget even\r\nher beauty and her other charms. She is learned without being a pedant,\r\nand no one meeting her for the first time would guess that under her\r\npleasant way of greeting you is hidden a knowledge and a love of art and\r\nliterature such as unfortunately is but seldom found among the many fair\r\nwomen who throng the drawing-rooms of brilliant Paris.\r\n\r\nMadame Jean de Montebello had a cousin, the Marquise de Montebello,\r\nwhose husband occupied for something like ten years the post of French\r\nAmbassador in St. Petersburg, and who was the subject of many\r\ndiscussions in the world in which she had literally been thrust, but to\r\nwhich she did not belong either by birth or by education. The Marquise\r\nde Montebello was the granddaughter of Madame Chevreux Aubertot, the\r\nproprietress of the big shop, called the Gagne-Petit, in the Avenue de\r\nl’Opéra, in Paris. She was a bright, intelligent, dashing, intriguing\r\nwoman, full of ambition, and of desire to play a part in European\r\npolitics. Amusing, and utterly regardless of what people might say or\r\nthink about her, she was enormously rich, and knew how to spend her\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived in St. Petersburg she threw wide open the doors of the\r\nEmbassy, and entertained all who expressed the desire to enjoy her\r\nhospitality. She soon made friends with the Grand Dukes, the brothers of\r\nAlexander III., who always gave their affections and their preferences\r\nto the people who amused them, and, indeed, it was impossible not to be\r\namused in the company of Madame de Montebello. She was essentially a\r\nperson who liked to see the utmost liberty both of language and of\r\nmanners reign around her, and who did not hesitate to put her feet on\r\nthe table, or do anything _outré_, provided she could in that way\r\nattract to her house the company she sought. Under her rule the French\r\nEmbassy became a sort of Liberty Hall, where one could do anything one\r\nliked. She gave to her friends and acquaintances the run of her house,\r\nof her kitchen and of her cellar, and she would have given them the run\r\nof her bedroom had they only dared to ask for it.\r\n\r\nWhen she left Russia she was extremely regretted there, even by those\r\nwho did not care for her, because with her disappeared a bright element\r\nthat always brought along with it some gaiety, even in the dullest\r\ncircles. Whilst she was Ambassadress, the French alliance was extremely\r\npopular, it became less so after she was gone.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Montebello was a diplomat of the old school, pompous,\r\nsolemn, not esteemed clever, but with a ripened experience. He had\r\ntraditions, knowledge of the world, and understood perfectly well that\r\nhis enormous wealth would help his country to win for herself the\r\nfriendship of Russia. He fulfilled all his duties with tact, and his\r\nmanners were essentially those of a gentleman--quiet, reserved, and with\r\na shade of self-sufficiency which became him. He made himself just as\r\npopular as his brilliant wife, and cared immensely for his position as\r\nan Ambassador. It broke his heart when he had to abandon it; he never\r\ncould get reconciled to the fact, the more so that he was not the\r\nfavourite in Paris he had been in St. Petersburg, and though the\r\nMarquise tried to give receptions and dinners to all those who cared to\r\ncome to them, she did not succeed in making either herself or her\r\nhusband popular in Paris society, though they contrived to be admitted\r\nin several select houses, such as the one of the Comtesse Mélanie de\r\nPourtalès.\r\n\r\nMadame de Montebello had a great friend who tried hard to launch her\r\ninto the society of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was the Comte Joseph de\r\nGontaut Biron, the son of the former French Ambassador in Berlin, the\r\nVicomte de Gontaut Biron, and one of the most popular men in the whole\r\nof Paris, who usually did the honours of the city when Russian Grand\r\nDukes visited it. The Comte de Gontaut was the only handsome member of a\r\nvery ugly family which had redeemed its want of beauty by unusual\r\ncleverness. He had been married to a Princesse de Polignac, whose heart\r\nhe had very soon broken, and whose fortune he had quite as soon\r\nsquandered. The Gontauts occupied a privileged position in the Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain, thanks to their numerous alliances and to their many\r\nrelatives. The elder members of the family, such as the Comtesse Armand,\r\nor the Princesse de Beauvau, tried to maintain the traditions of their\r\nrace, and could be classified among the _hautes et puissantes dames_ of\r\ntheir generation, but the younger members had mixed freely with the\r\nother elements of Paris society, and had assimilated their\r\ncharacteristics as well as those of their own circle.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the Comte Boni de Castellane, the former husband of\r\nMiss Anna Gould. His father, the Marquis de Castellane, had at one time\r\nplayed a part in French politics, when he had been a member of the first\r\nAssemblée Nationale, which had elected M. Thiers as President of the\r\nRepublic, or rather the Executive power as it was called at that time.\r\nUnpleasant incidents of a private nature had obliged him to leave public\r\nlife, and also to retire from several clubs of which he had been a\r\nmember. But he had contrived to keep afloat in the Faubourg, and was\r\nrather feared there on account of the sharpness of his tongue and the\r\nill-nature with which he repeated all the gossip which he spent his time\r\nin collecting. He was extremely intelligent, and had none of the foppery\r\nwhich made his son so thoroughly disagreeable; he would certainly have\r\nbeen a man who could have made his way in the world had he only tried to\r\nconform to the tenets of society.\r\n\r\nHis second son married the widow of Prince Furstenberg, who was a cousin\r\nof his, being the daughter of the old Duc de Sagan and of his second\r\nwife, Mademoiselle Pauline de Castellane, and considerably older than\r\nhimself. The Comtesse Jean de Castellane is at the present moment one of\r\nthe leading hostesses in Paris. She is clever, with excellent manners,\r\nwith tendencies to pose as a woman of culture, and not disdaining to\r\nwrite now and then little articles in the daily papers, which are always\r\naccepted with pleasure on account of the signature which accompanies\r\nthem. She could never be taken for anything else but a lady, but I doubt\r\nwhether one would at once call her a _grande dame_ in the sense in which\r\nthis word was understood formerly.\r\n\r\nI think I have mentioned the name of the Comtesse de Trédern. That lady\r\ncertainly deserves more than a passing mention. She was a Mlle. Say, the\r\nsister of the Princesse Amedée de Broglie, and she had married when\r\nquite young the Marquis de Brissac, the eldest son of the Duc de\r\nBrissac, who was killed during the Franco-German War. Left a widow with\r\ntwo children, she began first to restore the castle of Brissac in Anjou,\r\nwhich is considered one of the finest private residences in France, and\r\nwhich she bought from her father-in-law. Then she married the Comte de\r\nTrédern, from whom she parted after a few years of troublous union.\r\nSince then she has queened it at Brissac, or in her beautiful house of\r\nthe Place Vendôme, where she regularly gives sumptuous entertainments.\r\n\r\nAmong other hostesses I must say a word concerning the Duchesse de\r\nGramont, a Jewess and the daughter of Baron Amschel de Rothschild of\r\nFrankfurt. She was one of the few really _grandes dames_ of Paris.\r\nClever, full of tact, and kind and good, as few women have been kind and\r\ngood, she was essentially a great lady, and made for herself friends\r\nwherever she went. Her husband is now married to an Italian Princess,\r\nwhom he took to his heart a few months after the death of the Duchesse\r\nMarguerite, but the latter is not forgotten by the world which she\r\ngraced and adorned, and where her early death caused more sincere sorrow\r\nthan is generally expressed in the circle to which she belonged.\r\n\r\nMadame de Gramont had a sister who became the Princesse de Wagram, and\r\nwho was also a favourite in Parisian society, where she won for herself\r\na great position. Unfortunately she also died young, and with her\r\ndisappeared one of the last great ladies in France.\r\n\r\nForeigners form an important contingent in Paris society. The gay town\r\nhas always attracted wandering souls eager to find in strange places\r\nwhat they cannot get at home, and who have succumbed so well to its\r\ncharms that they lack the courage to leave it. A numerous company of\r\nAmericans and Russians met in society live in the new district about the\r\nArc de Triomphe, and they visit all the houses where entertainments are\r\ngoing on. Polish emigrants and Polish aristocracy have found their\r\nheadquarters in the Ile St. Louis at the Hotel Lambert, where Prince\r\nLadislas Tsartoryski, the husband of Princess Marguerite of Orleans,\r\nopened the doors of his magnificent residence to them with unbounded\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the Radziwill family also settled by the Seine, after\r\nthe marriage of one of them with the daughter of M. Blanc, the owner of\r\nthe Monaco gambling house. He was the father of the present Duchesse de\r\nDoudeauville. The Counts Branicki and their connections bought\r\nthemselves houses in the neighbourhood of the Rue de Penthièvre, where\r\nthe chief of the race had settled. There hostility to the Russian\r\nGovernment was fanned by every possible device, and there hatred against\r\nRussia was preached with an energy worthy of a better cause.\r\n\r\nThe Russian colony was also an important one. It lacked, however, a\r\nrendezvous, and it had to submit to constant rebuffs on the part of its\r\nown Embassy and Consulate, where it is the fashion to repulse all the\r\ncompatriots who call there unless they belong to the ultra-smart set\r\nwhich is in possession of influence in St. Petersburg official circles.\r\nSeveral Russian Grand Dukes, who had become constant inhabitants of the\r\nFrench capital, gave their colony an appearance of splendour which other\r\nforeign quarters lacked. Foremost among these scions of the Russian\r\nImperial house was the Grand Duke Paul, who, after his marriage with the\r\ndivorced wife of one of the officers of his own regiment, had left his\r\nfatherland and settled in Paris permanently. He goes about a great deal\r\nin society, where his wife, who has been created Countess of Hohenfelsen\r\nby the Prince Regent of Bavaria, is treated like a Grand Duchess, and in\r\nsociety given the precedence of one.\r\n\r\nLife in smart Paris to-day is totally different from life as it was in\r\nthe time of the Second Empire. Sport has entered into it, and is now one\r\nof its principal functions. Everyone who can, or who cannot, afford it\r\npossesses an automobile, and thinks himself obliged to make a show of it\r\nin the morning in the Bois de Boulogne, which is also invaded before\r\nlunch by a bevy of fair ladies who pretend they come there to do some\r\nwalking, but who in reality want only to show themselves and to see\r\nothers. It is there that all the gossip, which later on in the afternoon\r\nis spread at many tables, finds its origin, and where reputations are\r\nmarred and lost. It is there that “accidental” meetings take place\r\neither at polo or at some exhibition, or at one of the numerous\r\ntea-houses that have sprung up on all sides lately, where the Parisienne\r\ncomes to eat cakes, and not to drink tea, with which she is not yet\r\nsufficiently familiar. From ten to twelve o’clock everybody worth\r\nknowing is to be met in the Bois, where it is fashionable to be seen at\r\nthat hour, and where no one would care to go later or earlier.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon offers other kinds of pleasures, and fashionable society,\r\nafter a pause at the aforementioned tea-houses, repairs either to the\r\nraces or to some exhibition, or more often in summer time to the polo\r\nground at Bagatelle, where it likes to watch the game. The players\r\nbelong to the most elegant men about town, and think that the fact of\r\ntaking part in polo confers on them the reputation of being real\r\nsportsmen. The evenings are spent either at a ball or at a reception,\r\nbut late hours are not now the custom in Paris, and midnight generally\r\nsees the fashionable birds in their beds.\r\n\r\nThere is no serious interest in that kind of existence, no conversations\r\nworthy of being so called, except now and then by the greatest of\r\nchances. The witty, clever French society, the salons which had such a\r\nuniversal reputation in olden times, have all disappeared with the snows\r\nof the many winters that have elapsed since the days when they ruled\r\npublic opinion, and when their influence was felt everywhere, often in\r\npolitics and always in literature, which had to conform more or less to\r\ntheir rules, and which would not have cared to offend their good taste.\r\nParisian society has degenerated, it is impossible to deny it,\r\ndegenerated on account of the many foreign elements that have invaded\r\nit, and also on account of the importance which money has acquired, an\r\nimportance that has taken the place occupied formerly by intelligence,\r\nbeauty, virtue--all the things which ought to be respected, but which we\r\nare apt, now, to forget when we find them associated with that money\r\nwhich is the only god whose supremacy is acknowledged in that Paris\r\nwhich thinks itself the capital of the world, but which is only the\r\npurveyor of most of its evil pleasures.\r\n\r\nNot only in society as a whole is this laxity of demeanour and conduct\r\ndiscernible, but there is a perceptible loosening of the laws which used\r\nto govern legislators and officials. What men would formerly consider as\r\nimpinging upon their honour is no longer looked at askance, and so\r\nthings happen which leave an unpleasant memory. This has been observed\r\nin certain activities in the financial world.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier part of these reflections I have spoken of the Panama\r\naffair, and in the present chapter I have made some reference to the\r\nmoney-fever that pervades Paris to-day. It is therefore only necessary\r\nhere to be very brief.\r\n\r\nThere was a great outcry and a wealth of righteous indignation at the\r\nPanama disclosures, but it is difficult to perceive any improvement.\r\nThere have been scandals of recent date, the echoes of which reverberate\r\neven in 1914, and in which just as many people were implicated whose\r\nnames and social position ought to have put them above sordid intrigues.\r\nParis has always offered an excellent ground for financiers of doubtful\r\nmoral standing. Every paper has advertisements offering to the innocent\r\npublic every kind of facility to enable it to lose its money. With the\r\nhelp of a press willing to print anything provided it is paid for at a\r\nsufficiently high rate, shares not worth the paper they are printed upon\r\nare thrown upon the market, and are eagerly bought by credulous\r\ncreatures who believe blindly in what their papers tell them, and who\r\nlook forward to large benefits out of the promised rise of the said\r\nshares. That rise never comes, and then sometimes an angry dupe inquires\r\nof the police, generally without success, as to the reason why no\r\nredress can be obtained. The man in the street holds and expresses\r\nemphatic opinions, which if people believed were true would mean that\r\nthe corruption of Republican government surpasses everything of the kind\r\nthat ever flourished at the time of the Second Empire, about the\r\nvenality of which so much has been written and spoken.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of present-day finance, it is enough to remind the\r\nreader of the gigantic frauds which Madame Humbert was able to\r\nperpetrate for so many years, of the ease with which Cornelius Herz and\r\nArton were able to escape from the grip of the law, and of the facility\r\nwhich the famous Rochette, the hero of the last financial scandal that\r\nFrance can boast, found in avoiding being imprisoned or obliged to give\r\nup any portion of his ill-gotten gains. Rochette succeeded in avoiding\r\nevery pursuit for a long time, though numerous complaints had been made\r\nagainst him. It was said that the complaints had always been left\r\nunexamined under the pretence that they proceeded from people who simply\r\nwanted blackmail. It is no secret that several deputies were great\r\nfriends with that successful financier, during whose reign their stock\r\nexchange operations were always profitable.\r\n\r\nRochette is a curious example of the ease with which any man gifted with\r\nsufficient impudence can become an important personage. He began his\r\ncareer by being a waiter in a small hotel at Melun, soon tired of it,\r\nand went to Paris, where he obtained a situation as office assistant in\r\none of those financial establishments which flourish for a few months\r\nand disappear together with their directors into the unknown after a\r\nbrief and brilliant existence. His experience there helped him\r\nconsiderably in his future life. He learned to avoid mistakes into which\r\na novice in finance would be apt to fall. It is said that he profited by\r\nthe whispered advice that “in order to be a lucky financier, one must\r\nbefore everything have a deputy in one’s pocket.”\r\n\r\nWhen he became a banker and a director of several large concerns, he\r\nfrequented the Chamber of Deputies, and even honoured with his attention\r\nthe Senate. He affected great modesty, but took care to be kept well\r\ninformed as to the private means of several important personages whose\r\nprotection he thought might be of use to him in the future, and he\r\nmanaged in an unobtrusive way to make himself indispensable to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the end came it was rumoured in Paris that most scandalous facts\r\nwere about to come to light, and that the Panama affair would be\r\neclipsed by them. Names were mentioned, at first secretly then quite\r\nloudly, until at last they found their way into the newspapers. But,\r\nsomehow, the inquiry which had been begun dragged on until the public\r\ngot tired of hearing nothing about it, and made up its mind not to think\r\nany more about the affair. In the meantime in prison Rochette was\r\nleading the best kind of life possible under the circumstances, had all\r\nthe comforts which money allowed him to procure for himself, received\r\nvisits from his numerous friends, and when at last he was released on\r\nbail pending his trial, he declared to all those who cared to hear it,\r\nthat he would not only prove his innocence, but find people willing to\r\ntrust him with their money again, in spite of his recent misadventures.\r\n\r\nAnd when he was sentenced to several years’ imprisonment, Rochette\r\nquietly took a railway ticket and disappeared into an unknown land,\r\nwhich probably is not very far from the scene of his former exploits;\r\nsure that no one is going to discover him in the refuge which he had\r\nchosen, he is awaiting with the greatest confidence and calm the\r\nexpiration of the time when proscription will allow him to reappear in\r\nParis, and to begin again the financial career which he was obliged to\r\ninterrupt for a short period.\r\n\r\nHow was it possible for Rochette to escape whilst Charles de Lesseps and\r\nhis father were obliged to drink to the dregs the cup of their\r\nhumiliation? The reply is very simple, perhaps obvious, and I hesitate\r\nto doubt the reader’s perception by uttering it.\r\n\r\nWhen the great Lesseps was accused of having tried to buy the support of\r\nsome members of the Parliament, everyone cried out that it was a scandal\r\nwhich ought to be punished as severely as possible; but when it was\r\nproved that Rochette had succeeded in buying or winning over to his side\r\nsome of the most influential political people in France, that he had\r\neven secured the indulgence of judges who ought to have been at least\r\nimpartial, the public only shrugged its shoulders, and some persons were\r\neven found to say that after all he had been _un homme très fort_, and\r\nthat it was better to be his friend than his enemy. When Rochette was\r\narrested, excuses without number were found for him, and he was\r\nrepresented to be the victim of private vengeances and private\r\nblackmail. Times are changed indeed, and not only the opinions of men,\r\nbut also their ideas as to right and wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nM. FALLIÈRES AS PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe septenary of M. Loubet had come to an end. No one had ever given a\r\nthought to the possibility of his presenting himself for re-election,\r\nand he himself was but too glad to relinquish the burden of office. M.\r\nLoubet, in spite of all that has been said about him, was not the\r\ninsignificant personage some had tried to represent him. He had been\r\nelected through the influence of the Radical party, but he had\r\nnevertheless the strength of character to resist the desires or even the\r\norders of that same party on several occasions when he thought they\r\nwanted to go too far.\r\n\r\nPopular opinion has it that this was sufficient to arouse the ire of M.\r\nClemenceau, who, faithful to his tactics of holding in hand the leading\r\nstrings of the government, furious to see his intentions frustrated,\r\ndeclared war against M. Loubet.\r\n\r\nThe latter was clever enough to appear to ignore it, and arranged\r\nmatters so as to retire from the Presidency with all the honours of war,\r\nleaving to his successor the task of coping with the difficulties which\r\nthe Radical party seemed determined to put in the way of every President\r\nof the Republic.\r\n\r\nHis successor, M. Fallières, was elected largely through the influence\r\nof M. Clemenceau. M. Fallières was essentially a peaceful man. He had\r\naccepted the position of President of the Republic, partly because he\r\ndid not like to disobey the orders of his superiors, and partly because\r\nhe was a careful man, an excellent father, and saw in his septenary the\r\nopportunity to improve the material prospects of his children.\r\n\r\nIt was during his tenure of office that the Dreyfus affair came to a\r\nclose, and that the Captain was not only rehabilitated but also rewarded\r\nfor his sufferings with the Legion of Honour, in spite of the outcries\r\nwhich this decision raised among the Clericals and the anti-Semites. It\r\nwas also he who signed the decree granting burial in the Panthéon to the\r\nashes of Zola, and it was during his septenary, moreover, that relations\r\nwere definitely broken with the Vatican. The last event produced a great\r\nsensation, especially when the representative of the Papal Nuncio, Mgr.\r\nMontagnini, was expelled from Paris by the police in about as brutal a\r\nway as it was possible to conceive.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written concerning that last measure, of which, let it be\r\nsaid _en passant_, neither M. Fallières nor the French Government had\r\nany reason to be proud. It was one of those acts of violence which only\r\ntend to exasperate the public mind against those who render themselves\r\nguilty of the indiscretion, but which is of no importance in reality. Of\r\ncourse Mgr. Montagnini had not behaved with the necessary tact in the\r\ndelicate position wherein he found himself placed, but if he had had to\r\ndo with gentlemen they would have asked him to go away of his own\r\naccord, which he would probably have been but too glad to do, and they\r\nwould not have expelled him _mania militari_. M. Fallières, in spite of\r\nhis middle-class education, felt this, and it is said that he vainly\r\ntried to avoid this scandal. The Radical party, however, had laid down\r\nits conditions not only to him, but also to M. Clemenceau, and the\r\nlatter with all his cleverness and his energy was not strong enough to\r\nrefuse it this satisfaction, which was craved with persistence and in\r\nsuch imperative terms.\r\n\r\nI knew Mgr. Montagnini very well, and I happened to call on him on the\r\neve of the day which saw him thrown out of France with such unnecessary\r\nbrutality. He had been warned of the measures about to be taken against\r\nhim, but would not believe in its possibility. When I asked him why he\r\nhad not telegraphed to Mgr. Merry del Val, then Secretary of State of\r\nthe Holy See, asking permission to leave of his own accord, he replied\r\nto me that it would have been useless, because that permission would\r\nnever have been granted to him. As I expressed my astonishment he\r\nexplained to me at length that Rome wanted the French Government to\r\nresort to violence against its representative because it would only\r\nraise the prestige of the Church and provoke general indignation against\r\nits persecutors.\r\n\r\n“All this will pass,” he added; “many months will not go by before the\r\nvery government which does not hesitate to insult a priest and the\r\nofficial representative of the Pope will find itself obliged to renew\r\nrelations with the Holy See. So many questions will arise in connection\r\nwith this separation of the Church and State, of which the French\r\nRadicals are so proud, that they will very soon see the mistake they\r\nhave made.”\r\n\r\nThough Mgr. Montagnini was not a prophet by any means, he proved in this\r\nparticular case to be right, because in spite of the open rupture of the\r\nFrench Republic with the Vatican, relations were never entirely\r\ninterrupted between Rome and Paris. Indeed it would have been\r\nimpossible, because in spite of the hatred for the Catholic Church which\r\nthe leading politicians in France affected, they had on different\r\noccasions to turn to the representatives of the clergy for help, and\r\nthey did not disdain even to ask them to use their influence whenever\r\nthey wanted a candidate to be elected either in the Senate or in the\r\nChamber of Deputies, who under the mask of being a moderate Liberal, was\r\nin reality a Radical of the purest water, and a fervent partisan of M.\r\nClemenceau and his group.\r\n\r\nIt was at that time that the star of M. Clemenceau began to ascend\r\nhigher in the heavens than it had ever been. Until the election of M.\r\nFallières, he had more or less ruled in the dark, and as it were _en\r\ncachette_. When his candidate had been given the first position in the\r\nState the hour of his triumph sounded.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau, in spite of all that has been said, had never been a\r\npartisan of the Russian alliance. His sympathies were entirely English.\r\nHe had been the object of the special attention of King Edward, and his\r\npolitical plans comprised a strong Franco-English friendship, which\r\nwould prove to be a shield in case of a new war with Germany.\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau would not have been sorry to see war. He was far too\r\nshrewd not to notice that in spite of the violent attacks of a certain\r\nportion of the press against Germany, the majority of the nation did not\r\nany longer harbour such feelings of hatred against their eastern\r\nneighbour as formerly existed. More than that, a good many people\r\nthought that it would be better to reconcile oneself to facts, and, by\r\nan understanding with the German Government, to avoid the heavy taxes\r\nwhich the increased armaments imposed on the country. These armaments\r\nwere not popular among the greater number of Frenchmen. Forty years had\r\ngone by since the war of 1870, and a new generation had succeeded to the\r\none that had witnessed the unexampled disasters which had brought about\r\nthe fall of the Second Empire. That younger generation could not feel in\r\nthe same way as its fathers had done; it only saw that France was\r\nprosperous, and that a war, even if it turned out to be successful,\r\ncould but increase the military burdens of the country. This appealed to\r\nno one, and consequently a renewal of hostilities with Germany was not\r\ndesired. M. Clemenceau, on the contrary, had rabid anti-German feelings,\r\nand he encouraged what chauvinist tendencies still existed in France,\r\nand tried to persuade the leading men in England that the conclusion of\r\nan understanding with France would prove of infinite advantage to both\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Russia could not be left out of this understanding, and M.\r\nClemenceau had perforce to submit to the fact, but he did his best,\r\nnevertheless, to destroy the Russian sympathies which existed in his\r\nfatherland by urging the newspapers which were at his disposal to say\r\nthat in signing the famous Franco-Russian alliance, which had been the\r\ncause of so much joy, France had been the dupe--France who had given her\r\nmoney, and France who had thrown herself into the arms of Russia, whilst\r\nthe latter had taken all that she had been offered, without giving\r\nanything in return for the gifts freely showered on her with a more than\r\ngenerous hand.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, M. Fallières started for St. Petersburg, as in duty bound,\r\nalmost immediately after his election, conforming himself thus to the\r\ntradition which had been handed over by M. Félix Faure to his\r\nsuccessors. He was warmly welcomed on the banks of the Neva, but\r\nwelcomed only by the government and officials who followed the lead\r\ngiven to them by the Sovereign. The country itself remained very\r\nindifferent during his visit, and the attitude of the public was not at\r\nall what it had been when Félix Faure had arrived at Peterhof to return\r\nthe memorable visit of Nicholas II. in Paris. Somehow the alliance was\r\nmore accepted as an accomplished fact than as an advantage. In Russia,\r\ntoo, the hour of disillusion had struck.\r\n\r\nM. Fallières, in spite of what had been said of him, was very far from\r\nbeing the nonentity he was reported to be. On the contrary, he had an\r\nunusual amount of common sense, and was not slow to notice the change in\r\nthe political atmosphere of the day. Nevertheless, he did his best to\r\ndisguise from the public the fact of the coolness which had begun to\r\nreplace the mutual enthusiasm of France and Russia for each other, but\r\nwhen he returned home he began to listen more than he had done formerly\r\nto the advice of M. Clemenceau, and to look towards England as a\r\npossible ally, having learnt much by his visit to Peterhof.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been reported otherwise, M. Fallières was fond of M.\r\nClemenceau, and they got on very well together the whole time the latter\r\nremained Prime Minister. Together they worked for the benefit of M.\r\nBriand, the new star that suddenly arose in the heaven of the Third\r\nRepublic, and which began to shine in great part through their efforts\r\nto assure themselves of its help and co-operation towards the final\r\ntriumph of the Radical party.\r\n\r\nI shall talk of M. Briand in the next chapter. Some people saw in him a\r\nsuccessor of M. Fallières as President of the Republic, a conviction\r\nwhich personally I did not share at all, and events proved the truth of\r\nmy conviction. M. Briand was far too clever to retire at that moment\r\nfrom political life, which still has many triumphs in store for him, and\r\na man who has once occupied the position of Head of the State has no\r\nfuture after his term of office is over; he can only end his days in\r\npeace, with the broad red ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his\r\nbreast as a remembrance of happy days never to return.\r\n\r\nThe reign of M. Fallières had its share of scandals. I have already\r\nspoken of M. Rochette. There were others besides, among them that\r\nprovoked by the tragic adventures of Madame Steinheil, whose trial and\r\nsubsequent acquittal occupied Parisian society for long months.\r\n\r\nSeveral episodes of the same kind have lately occupied public attention.\r\nThey have all left M. Fallières more or less indifferent, and have not\r\nruffled his equanimity. He fulfilled his duties in an unostentatious\r\nfashion, and tried to impart as much simplicity as possible to the\r\nPresidential household. He travelled about, distributed all the\r\nhandshakes required of him and all the medals and decorations that his\r\nministers had awarded to their adherents. He partook of the regular\r\nnumber of official dinners, opened exhibitions and charitable\r\ninstitutions, in a word he was a model President, and it is quite\r\npossible that M. Clemenceau viewed the end of his Presidency with\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nMadame Fallières has been the subject of all kinds of absurd stories.\r\nNotwithstanding these, she did not show herself as unfit for the part\r\nshe had been called upon to play as her enemies would have us believe.\r\nShe was polite with everybody, reserved in her manners, and avoided\r\nmistakes. She has done much good, and if she was not so generous as some\r\nof her predecessors had shown themselves, she never refused to give\r\nmoney for the cause of charity, when it was necessary, but on the\r\ncontrary tried to alleviate the distresses which were brought to her\r\nnotice. She did not pose for what she was not, and she always declared\r\nthat when she would have to leave the Elysée, she would do so with\r\nregret at having to give up such a sumptuous home, but that at the same\r\ntime she would not be sorry to return to private life and its\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nM. and Mme. Fallières had several children born to them. Their only\r\ndaughter was married a few years ago to M. Jean Lannes, who had been,\r\nuntil the day when he accompanied to the altar the daughter of his\r\nchief, the private secretary of the President of the Republic. His\r\nmarriage caused a certain sensation in Republican circles, because it\r\nwas celebrated in the Church of the Madeleine, in spite of the fact that\r\nM. Fallières was supposed to be a freethinker, which in reality he was\r\nnot by any means. But Madame Fallières was a fervent Catholic, and she\r\nnever would have allowed her child to be married simply at the _mairie_,\r\nas it was suggested to her by some zealous friends. Madame Fallières had\r\nalways the courage of her opinions, and she has showed it during her\r\nreign as the first lady of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nHer son, André Fallières, was the subject of much talk at the time of\r\nthe Steinheil affair, and some people affirmed--well, it does not matter\r\nwhat; it is needless to say that there was not the slightest foundation\r\nfor such a story.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Fallières’ term of office was over, there were but three\r\ncandidates possible for the position: one of them was M. Clemenceau\r\nhimself; M. Pamm, a very wealthy manufacturer possessed of the vast\r\ninfluence which unlimited means always allow one to wield; and M.\r\nPoincaré, advocate and Academician, a man gifted with singular strength\r\nof will, strong Conservative principles, who endeavours to govern\r\npersonally the country entrusted officially to his care, who has a holy\r\nhorror of Radicals, and who is cordially disliked by M. Clemenceau.\r\n\r\nThis last was perhaps the very reason why M. Poincaré was elected--the\r\nChamber and the Senate have become just a little tired of the autocracy\r\nexercised over them by the _tombeur de ministères_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nM. BRIAND AND THE SOCIALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have mentioned M. Briand; he is certainly the most remarkable\r\npolitician that France can boast at the present moment, and one who will\r\nprobably rise to greater things even than those he has so far achieved.\r\nHe began life as a workman in a factory, and soon made himself known by\r\neloquent speeches, which he delivered at Socialist meetings in Lyons,\r\nSt. Etienne, and other working centres in France. He had more education\r\nthan people belonging to his class generally boast, and he was wise\r\nenough to understand that it was imperative that he should complete it,\r\nif he desired to play an important part in the historical development of\r\nhis country--perhaps one day to rule it. Accordingly, he devoted all his\r\nspare time to that object, and refused offers to accept a seat in the\r\nChamber of Deputies. Only when he felt sure that he could hold his own\r\nin that assembly of politicians did he entertain the idea.\r\n\r\nM. Briand is one of the most ambitious men of his generation, and he\r\ndistinguishes himself from most of his colleagues by the knowledge which\r\nhe possesses of his own power, and by the extreme prudence with which he\r\nshows it in public. It is true that he likes to rule, but he does not\r\ncare for people to know that he rules them. In this he differs from\r\nothers in power, who are not guiltless of displaying the influence which\r\nthey exercise over their political friends and disciples.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Briand entered the Chamber of Deputies, he spent the first years\r\ninitiating himself into the secrets of social life, being very well\r\naware of the importance of such things; with an energy of which very few\r\npeople would have been capable he set himself to learn. He ended by\r\nbecoming one of the best-groomed men in Paris. His former friends\r\nstared; at first they felt tempted to be angry. They very soon realised,\r\nhowever, that a deep political purpose was hidden behind this apparent\r\nflattery of society, and they began to respect him, and to talk about\r\nhim as of a man born to great things. When at last he became a power in\r\nhis party, and in France, and joined M. Clemenceau’s ministry, they\r\nunderstood that he would prove a leader such as very few political\r\nparties could boast.\r\n\r\nHis ambition is defined by those who are watching his career as aiming\r\nto grasp the reins of France, and to hold them fast, until the day when\r\nhe can show himself to the whole world as the strong man of France.\r\n\r\nM. Briand has an exceptional nature. He has no illusions, either about\r\nhimself or about those who surround him. He knows very well that the man\r\nwho allows sentimentality to interfere with politics is lost long before\r\nhe has begun to fight. He early hastened therefore to put a barrier\r\nbetween himself and everything that could be called by that name.\r\n\r\nHe gained his place in his party; won the votes of the electors who had\r\nsent him to the Chamber to defend their interests, without having\r\nrecourse to underhand tricks; he fought his adversaries with clean\r\nhands. He won the admiration of his partners in the game he played by\r\nthe audacity with which he always put himself forward when danger was\r\nahead. He exercised influence over his colleagues in the ministry by the\r\nenergy with which he defended his personal opinions, and the\r\nindependence which he showed in questions where his principles found\r\nthemselves involved. And he gained the attention of his country by the\r\nstrength of his personality, the calm which never forsook him in the\r\ngravest circumstances of life, and the cold determination which he\r\nbrought to bear upon everything he did, and every blow which he dealt.\r\n\r\nEnemies he had in plenty, detractors very few. Many hated him, but they\r\ndid not despise him. Years ago he realised that he had succeeded in\r\nwinning the respect of France, and he meant to keep it.\r\n\r\nToo far-seeing to fail to understand that the theories by which he had\r\nbeen able to attain his position were utopian and would not carry him\r\nvery far, M. Briand had no sympathy with the programme of destruction\r\nwhich the Labour party of his early days had brought forward; indeed, it\r\nlooked as if he meant to sweep away that party as soon as he succeeded\r\nin gaining power and in inspiring confidence in his personality and his\r\npolitical principles. He had patience, a thing so rarely met with in\r\npoliticians, who are always eager to see their opinions triumph without\r\nwaiting for the moment when they become acceptable to the nation. He\r\nfelt, moreover, that he was the only man capable of saving France from\r\nthe hands of the anarchists who at that time were determined to destroy\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe had been a workman, and had learned to appreciate the evil passions\r\nand the thirst for unreasoning destruction which not infrequently\r\nanimates the mob. He knew but too well that the spread of Socialist\r\ntheories would lead to nothing but the desire to overthrow everything\r\nwithout the possibility of putting anything else in the place of what\r\nhad been trampled under foot, and he made up his mind not to lend\r\nhimself to the ambitions of those who aimed at annihilation.\r\n\r\nIt is yet too early to judge whether M. Briand’s plans will ever be\r\nrealised, but for those who know him as well as I do, it is pretty\r\ncertain that sooner or later he will try to constitute a moderate\r\nRepublican party, determined to put a stop to the progress of anarchism,\r\nand to rally around the new party the sound forces of the nation. He\r\nwill then be the object of the denunciation and hatred of his friends of\r\nyesterday, who will see in him a traitor, and who will fight him with\r\nall the energy of which they are capable. They will endeavour to\r\noverthrow him as they have other idols that they have worshipped in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that M. Briand will not lose prestige by this\r\ncry of revenge which will certainly be raised, and that he will continue\r\nin the path which he has marked out. He is essentially an opportunist,\r\nand moreover has enough common sense not to attach himself to the\r\nsuccess of the moment; rather he looks to the future for his ultimate\r\ntriumph, a triumph he will not miss, and which will not miss him. At\r\npresent the only hope France can have of the establishment of a strong,\r\nmoderate Republican government, able to exist without having recourse to\r\nthe votes of the Socialists, lies in M. Briand. He alone is able to stop\r\nthe torrent that is threatening to carry away the existing order of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn M. Briand, M. Clemenceau finds a strong man with strong political\r\nopinions, but it is not likely, so long as the latter is alive, that his\r\nformer pupil will come out openly against him.\r\n\r\nM. Briand was for a short time considered the real leader of the\r\nSocialist party. This did not last very long, and perhaps he was not\r\nsorry to give up that position, and to have the opportunity of\r\ndisagreeing openly with M. Jaurès, the great oracle and prophet of\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nM. Jaurès is a curious personality. He is extremely rich, and yet\r\npreaches a general division of all wealth--save his own. He is gifted\r\nwith singular and powerful eloquence, and knows how to appeal to the\r\nhearts and especially to the imagination of his hearers, using a torrent\r\nof words which leaves such a deep impression on those who listen to him\r\nthat they lose sight of all that is false and untrue in them. M. Jaurès\r\nis worshipped by the more fiery Socialists, who consider even Radicalism\r\nas something associated with Conservatism, and whose only creed is the\r\ndestruction of everything that existed before their time.\r\n\r\nHe is ambitious of influencing others, but has no desire to rule his\r\ncountry, perhaps because he knows very well that the moment he would\r\nconsent to enter or to form a ministry half his prestige would be gone.\r\nHe is too intelligent not to understand that the moment that one has\r\npower one is bound to defend those who have given it to you as well as\r\nthe principles to which one owes it. And M. Jaurès with all his\r\neloquence is unable to defend anything; he can only attack, a thing\r\nwhich is easier and nine times out of ten more successful--at least in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nHe is the type of a tribune of Roman times; he can win the masses over\r\nto his view, and knows very well how to incense them against those whom\r\nthey consider to be their enemies; it is a question whether he would be\r\nable to stop these masses, should he ever desire to do so.\r\n\r\nVery often the question has been asked whether M. Jaurès is a sincere\r\nSocialist, or whether he has declared himself to be one simply because\r\nhe wanted to attract the attention of the world to his person, his\r\nopinions and his speeches. To this question it is most difficult to\r\nreply. Certainly M. Jaurès has a great deal that is theatrical in his\r\nnature, he is an actor by temperament as well as a fighter, and this has\r\nperhaps contributed more than anything else to the attitude\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES SITTING]\r\n\r\nwhich he has taken in politics. Nothing gives him more pleasure than by\r\nscathing phrases to disarm his adversaries or inspire them with terror.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the Socialists have never reproached him for his large\r\nfortune, which he has always steadfastly refused to share with them. M.\r\nJaurès is in their eyes a privileged person whom they allow not to\r\npractise the virtues which he preaches. They know but too well that they\r\npossess in him a strength they cannot well spare.\r\n\r\nFrance, it seems to me, is a country where Socialism is rampant, and yet\r\none where it has the least chances to seize control of the country. The\r\nexplanation lies in the fact that the working classes are far from\r\npossessing the intellectual development which we find among them in\r\nGermany, or even England. Men like Virchow, Liebneckt, or Bebel are not\r\nto be found in France, where if they existed they would at once embrace\r\nthe political convictions of the bourgeois class, which after all has\r\nthe upper hand in that country. Frenchmen are very practical; it suits\r\nthem to scream against all those who are in possession of riches, but\r\nthe moment they have earned the francs which they envied in their\r\nopponents they immediately become disdainful of their former friends.\r\nAll the French workmen are Socialists until they get rich, but the\r\ncountry itself is essentially bourgeois, and we all know that the French\r\nbourgeois is not the most unselfish of beings.\r\n\r\nFrom this fact I draw the conclusion that, so long as the present love\r\nof money lasts, there is little danger of a purely Socialist government\r\never ruling France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nA FEW LITERARY MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one decides to forget the past and the great thinkers who had made\r\nthe middle of last century so interesting in France, one can find great\r\npleasure in knowing some of the literary men of the present day in\r\nParis. They are always amusing, and perhaps the art of small talk is\r\npractised by them more brilliantly than among their predecessors.\r\nAnatole France, Octave Mirbeau, and Pierre Loti are among the foremost\r\nnovelists, and for those who have given themselves over to historical\r\nstudies the Marquis de Ségur is the most acceptable name. I must also\r\ngive grateful mention to such as Guy de Maupassant and Flaubert--the\r\ngreat Flaubert, whom so many have tried to imitate, but whom few could\r\napproach either as regards his talent or his thorough knowledge of the\r\nFrench language.\r\n\r\nThe well known Octave Mirbeau began his literary career as the secretary\r\nof Arthur Meyer, the director and present owner of the _Gaulois_. He has\r\na profound belief in his own work, and with some justice. He certainly\r\nis clever, and the talent with which he describes in his novels what he\r\nhas not felt is such as one but seldom meets nowadays. His books are\r\nremarkable, and they awake passionate interest in their readers, even\r\nthough they are so strong with realism that they repel many. They are\r\nhighly imaginative, and provoke not only curiosity but also the desire\r\nto read them over again as soon as one has finished them.\r\n\r\nFrom being quite unknown Octave Mirbeau has risen high in the literary\r\nfirmament of his country and his generation. He soon made his name,\r\ngossip saying that he kept himself before his contemporaries by his\r\nsharp criticisms of everybody and everything he did not like, or he\r\nthought did not like him. He spared no one. Nevertheless he became\r\nfamous in Paris and throughout France. He succeeded, therefore, in\r\nmaking his books popular.\r\n\r\nM. Mirbeau began as a poor man; quickly, however, he earned for himself\r\na large fortune, partly through his books, partly through successful\r\noperations on the Stock Exchange, and partly by marriage. M. Mirbeau\r\nlives in clover in one of the finest apartments of the Avenue du Bois,\r\nand on the lovely property which he possesses at Cormeilles-en-Vexin,\r\nnear Paris. He gives dinners now and then, and has always been upon\r\nexcellent terms with the wife to whom he owes so much of his worldly\r\ngoods. He likes to see at his hospitable hearth the people of whose\r\nadmiration he feels sure, and honoured me once with an invitation to\r\nlunch when I least expected it, for we had never been very friendly\r\ntowards each other.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that lunch. There were only four of us, the host\r\nand hostess, Rodin the sculptor, and myself. When I arrived I was\r\nintroduced in the study, where the first thing which struck my eyes was\r\nthe bust of Mirbeau himself on the mantelpiece. As I looked at it, after\r\nhaving exchanged the first greetings with the people in the room, Madame\r\nMirbeau turned to me, and said in her softest accents--and she has a\r\ndelightfully soft voice: “You are looking at my husband’s bust; it is\r\nthe work of our great master here,” and she turned towards Rodin.\r\n\r\nThe latter raised himself slightly from the depths of the large\r\narm-chair in which he was ensconced beside the fire, and looking at me,\r\nmurmured dreamily: “Ah, it is not everybody’s bust I care to do, but\r\nwhen one meets with a remarkable personality like our great writer here,\r\nit is a pleasure for an artist to reproduce his features.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed as he spoke, and Mirbeau’s face lighted up as he said in his\r\nturn: “I never hoped for such a reward for all my work as to be thought\r\nworthy of the attention of our great master.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Madame Mirbeau began again: “Ah, it is not often that two great\r\nsouls like our two great masters here present meet and think together.”\r\n\r\nLunch was announced, and Rodin rose, and directed his steps towards the\r\ndining-room. Fearing that I might step before him, Mirbeau stopped me by\r\nlaying his hand upon my arm, saying as he did so: “Laissez passer le\r\nmaître, notre maître à tous!”\r\n\r\nAnd this kind of thing went on during the whole meal. Rodin praised\r\nMirbeau, Mirbeau praised Rodin, and Madame Mirbeau praised both of them.\r\nOne heard nothing but “cher maître,” and “ce grand maître,” and “notre\r\ngrand maître”--I began to think that I had been invited to assist at the\r\ncanonisation of Rodin by Mirbeau, and of Mirbeau by Rodin, or of both by\r\nMirbeau’s wife.\r\n\r\nAnatole France has a fluent and correct French diction, but whilst\r\nadmiring him, I cannot forget that there have been other great thinkers,\r\nwriters, and philosophers, not only in France but also in Europe. And\r\nthis is what his worshippers won’t admit. St. Simon will always provide\r\nenjoyment for the people who wade through his pages; Renan’s works will\r\nalways remain a model of fine language, and of noble thoughts nobly\r\nexpressed; Thiers’s history of the Consulate and the Empire will always\r\nbe consulted by those who care for the past and all it has seen and\r\nwitnessed. I doubt very much whether the life of Jeanne d’Arc will ever\r\nbecome a classic work.\r\n\r\nApart from this liking for the congenial atmosphere of praise, Anatole\r\nFrance is a charming man, full of humour, amusing in the extreme, his\r\nconversation sparkling with witty anecdotes and _bons mots_, which he\r\nutters now and then when one least expects them. He has a wonderful\r\nmemory, and when all is said and done possesses a great deal of kindness\r\nin his judgments, with a considerable indulgence towards his neighbours.\r\nHe has none of the sharpness of language of Mirbeau, and is more a\r\ngentleman. His manner with women is a model of its kind; he treats them\r\nwith a chivalry which savours of the days of old, when men still died\r\nfor the ladies of their heart. M. Anatole France, taken on the whole, is\r\ncertainly a person worth knowing, and is one of the most charming men in\r\nParis at the present day.\r\n\r\nI don’t think that I met Flaubert more than a couple of times, but he\r\nleft on my mind an impression that probably nothing will ever efface.\r\nThere was real genius in his face, and, in spite of a certain tendency\r\nto grumble at everything and at everybody, he could be a charming\r\ncompanion. He was the inventor of the Naturalistic school, and\r\nunfortunately others tried to copy him, with the appalling result which\r\nwe who live in France have seen. But nothing could be more amusing than\r\nto witness his rage when shown the distasteful manuscript of some\r\ntalentless young man, and being told that it was supposed to be an\r\nimitation of his style. He used to burst into real fury, and declare\r\nthat if this was going to be the result of his arduous work, he would\r\nrather throw in the fire all that he had ever written. Flaubert was not\r\ndevoid of ideals, and though he believed that novels ought to describe\r\nlife, he did not think that they must depict every phase of the\r\nmaterial side of it. He was a great genius, and what was allowed to him\r\nwould not be tolerated in others.\r\n\r\nPierre Loti is another genius in his way. In his charming, lovely books\r\neach line breathes with a deep, real talent. Some of his descriptions\r\nshow us certain spots and places with such vividness that it is almost\r\npossible to think one has seen them too. There are passages in “Mon\r\nFrère Yves,” in “Désanchantées,” in “Le Pélerin d’Angkok,” and\r\nespecially in that delightful and profound work, “Le Livre de la Pitié\r\net de la Mort,” the like of which have perhaps never been written before\r\nin the French language. But the man himself is anything but sympathetic.\r\nHe thinks far too much of his own genius, and his affectation jars on\r\nthe nerves. I have never been able to understand why the people who\r\nwrite clever books should consider themselves as made of superior clay\r\nto other mortals, and I feel inclined to laugh always whenever I see an\r\nauthor affect habits, language, and general demeanour different from\r\nthose of common humanity simply on account of the tales which he has\r\ncomposed, thanks to the intelligence and cleverness that Providence has\r\ngiven to him, and which it might just as well have given to someone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nA man who did not think himself something extraordinary, and who,\r\nperhaps, had more genius in his little finger than others in their whole\r\nbody, was Guy de Maupassant, that cruel observer of the human heart who\r\nunderstood so well the feelings of his generation, and who was to die so\r\nmiserably, first losing that intellect which had made him such a strong\r\nman and such a remarkable writer. There was a time when I often saw him,\r\nand his death grieved me very much more than I could even have supposed.\r\n\r\nEmile Augier and Jules Claretie belonged still to a generation where\r\nself-praise was absent. The last-mentioned writer was perhaps one of the\r\ngreatest workers of his time. I often wondered at the activity which\r\nallowed him to fulfil his duties as director of the Comédie Française,\r\nto write the charming _feuilletons_ which the _Temps_ publish every\r\nweek, and to do all this apart from innumerable other things, among\r\nwhich the composition of novels holds a place.\r\n\r\nThere have been many who grumbled in public at the manner in which\r\nClaretie administered the Comédie Française, perhaps they would have\r\ngrumbled just as much if someone else had been in his place. The post\r\nwas not an easy one, for it required an amount of tact such as is not to\r\nbe found everywhere. But what cannot be denied is that he filled it like\r\nthe gentleman he was, and that he insisted on his staff behaving like\r\ngentlemen and ladies so long as they remained under his control. He gave\r\nto his theatre an air of dignity and of correctness which put it high\r\nabove any other in Paris.\r\n\r\nAnother man who could be classed in the same category as Jules Claretie\r\nwas the Vicomte de Vogué, also a member of the Academy, and a writer\r\nimbued with the grand traditions of the seventeenth century when La\r\nRochefoucauld wrote his maxims and La Bruyère his philosophical\r\nmeditations on the foibles of mankind. M. de Vogué can be classed among\r\nthe best authors of the latter part of the nineteenth century, and his\r\nbooks will always be read with pleasure when those of other authors will\r\nbe entirely forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere are just a few writers of the same style left among the ranks of\r\nthe French Academy, such as the Marquis de Ségur, whom I have already\r\nmentioned, but unfortunately that learned assembly has deteriorated, and\r\nhas welcomed to its bosom literary men of a very inferior rank.\r\n\r\nI will not put among them M. Paul Bourget, who, though his books have\r\nsadly gone out of fashion, is an active, charming writer full of the\r\nspirit of observation. I find myself thinking of him, however, as an\r\nauthor who wanted to imitate Balzac, and who imagined that he had\r\nwritten a sequel to the “Comédie Humaine,” whilst in reality he had only\r\ndescribed the comedy of a certain small circle of Parisian smart\r\nsociety, which has already changed so much that one cannot recognise a\r\nsingle known person among those he tried to describe so faithfully.\r\n\r\nMarcel Prévost is also among the men I have often met, and I liked him\r\nvery much. He was modest; he did not always speak of his personal\r\nperfections, and did not think that the fact of his having been elected\r\na member of the French Academy relieved him from study or from honest\r\nhard work. He was also a delightful companion. Few men are living to-day\r\nwho are better informed as to the virtues or the vices of his\r\ngeneration; he has a thorough knowledge of the human heart, he realises\r\nthe artificiality of the society among which he lives, and also its\r\nfollies, for which his indulgence is seldom lacking.\r\n\r\nThere is much earnestness in the talent of M. Marcel Prévost, far more\r\nthan in the sketches, for one can hardly call them anything else, of\r\nAbel Hermant, who poses for the satirist of his time and of his\r\ngeneration, and who forgets that one could often find much about himself\r\nto satirise.\r\n\r\nI will not do more than mention the modern playwrights such as Henri\r\nBataille, Alfred Capus, Henri Bernstein, Francis du Croisset, and so on.\r\nThey write in order to make money, and of course must compose dramatic\r\npieces which can bring it to them. They are more or less _cabotins_\r\nthemselves, owing to the influence of the many actors with whom their\r\nwhole life is spent, and they often mistake life for a comedy, which\r\nunfortunately it is not, introducing drama when it is not needed. Still,\r\nI hardly see how they could avoid it, living, as everybody does, in an\r\nartificial atmosphere. The greatest actors in Paris indeed are those who\r\ndo not appear on the stage.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pass actresses by in silence; they rule Paris with a\r\nrod of iron, and are given far more importance than the highest born.\r\nArtists like Madame Sarah Bernhardt, Réjane, Jane Hading, or the\r\n“divine” Bartet, as she is called, of the Comédie Française, without\r\nmentioning Cecile Sorel, who is something else besides an actress of\r\nunrivalled talent, are all the objects of far more attention than a\r\nqueen would be should she appear in the circles in which these ladies\r\nlive. One looks up to them not only as clever, talented artists, but\r\nalso the supreme mistresses of fashion; as examples to be imitated by\r\nall those who can do so; as the most fascinating, interesting women in\r\nParis. Their dresses, their hats, their jewels, carriages, and sumptuous\r\napartments are described in all the newspapers; their movements are\r\nchronicled as if they were empresses.\r\n\r\nAmong all these fair, charming creatures, Madame Bartet is certainly the\r\nmost ladylike, not only in her person, but also in her tastes and quiet\r\nrefinement. She has been lucky enough to keep her youth at an age when\r\nmost other women have long ago forgotten that they ever had such a\r\npossession, and her slight figure, her lovely complexion, despite her\r\nmore than fifty years, make her look always young and altogether\r\ncharming. Sarah Bernhardt is a great-grandmother, yet she also can play\r\nthe Dame aux Camélias without appearing ridiculous in the eyes of her\r\nold admirers. She is perhaps the greatest actress that France has\r\nproduced since Rachel, but I cannot say that I ever found her\r\nsympathetic. To my mind she screams far too much, and is not natural in\r\nher conception of the many heroines which she represents. But she is so\r\ncharming as a woman of the world, so interesting in her intercourse,\r\nthat I am quite ready to say that it is I who have bad taste, and that\r\nall she does is perfection itself.\r\n\r\nRéjane is something quite different; there is more real passion in her\r\nacting, though much less refinement. She is vulgar, and the heaviness of\r\nher whole person adds to that first impression; but she knows how to\r\nrepresent the different feelings of joy, despair, sorrow, anger and rage\r\nthat can shake a human creature. She is life itself whenever she appears\r\non the stage, not life seen through rose-coloured spectacles, but life\r\nas we have unfortunately to live and to bear it.\r\n\r\nJeanne Granier is still a favourite with the Parisian public, though her\r\nlovely voice has become worn, and her increasing stoutness has done away\r\nwith her former grace.\r\n\r\nJane Hading was also at one moment the rage, but she did not remain a\r\nlong time the fashion, though we still see her name on the programmes of\r\ndifferent theatres. She certainly played well, but tried too much to\r\nimitate Sarah, which did not always agree with her style of beauty, to\r\nwhich, let it be said _en passant_, she owed most of her successes\r\nrather than to her talent, which was not that of a tragedienne by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nAs for Cecile Sorel, she is an exception among actresses, just as much\r\nas she is an exception among women. She has often reminded me of the\r\nDuchesse de Longueville and those other ladies of the time of the Fronde\r\nwho led men to victory or to death. Her beauty is something quite\r\nextraordinary, more by its originality than by its perfection. She is\r\nthe incarnation of feminine charm, and clever in mind as well as\r\ncultured and well-bred. Her whole demeanour is that of a _grande dame_.\r\n\r\nAnd actors, you will ask me, actors such as Guitry, or Le Bargy or\r\nMounet Sully, what do you think of them? I think nothing, because I do\r\nnot know them. In my time one kissed the pretty fingers of a lovely\r\nactress, but one did not invite actors to one’s house. I have kept to\r\nthis tradition, and do not regret it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nA FEW FOREIGN DIPLOMATS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter of a century that I lived in Paris I was fated to see\r\nmany changes among the Diplomatic Corps, first at the Court of Napoleon\r\nIII., and afterwards at the Elysée. I must say that in all the\r\ndiplomatic circle I seldom found unpleasant or rude colleagues, but\r\nthat, on the contrary, I have met most charming men and women whom it\r\nwas a privilege and an honour to know. It is impossible to speak of them\r\nall, but there are a few figures which have left such a vivid\r\nremembrance in my mind that I must mention them.\r\n\r\nI think I have spoken of Prince and Princess Metternich; they were great\r\nfavourites with the Empress Eugénie, and another Ambassador who shared\r\nher affections was Count Nigra, one of the ablest diplomats Italy could\r\never boast. A faithful servant and pupil of the great Cavour, he watched\r\non his behalf everything that was going on in France, and helped the\r\nunfortunate Empress in her flight, or rather did not help her, because\r\nhis intervention, together with that of his Austrian colleague,\r\nconsisted in advising her to run away, and perhaps even in obliging her\r\nto do so, from a feeling that later on it would be easier to get a\r\nrevolutionary government to shut its eyes to the advance of the Italian\r\ntroops on Rome, and their conquest of the Eternal City.\r\n\r\nCount Nigra was a charming man. It was said that one could never believe\r\nanything he said, or rely upon anything he promised. But apart from this\r\nhe was the pleasantest colleague one could have, and contrived to\r\nremain on good terms with all those he knew, even when in diplomacy he\r\nhad cheated them of something or other. After he left Paris, I met him\r\nin Vienna and in St. Petersburg, and was always delighted to have those\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons spent long years in Paris, and represented the government of\r\nQueen Victoria with great dignity. He was a gentleman and also a most\r\nable diplomat, and whilst he stayed at the Faubourg St. Honoré,\r\nAnglo-French relations remained excellent in spite of the many attempts\r\nmade to spoil them. His successors also left excellent memories behind\r\nthem when their term of office came to an end; and Lord Lytton\r\nespecially had contrived to make for himself many friends among French\r\nsociety, which at that time did not look upon foreigners with the same\r\nenthusiasm it professes to-day. Lord Lytton was a scholar, a writer and\r\nalso a statesman, a combination one does not meet frequently in our age\r\nof mediocrities. He was a great friend, and, I think, also a distant\r\nrelation, of Lord Salisbury, who had firm confidence in his abilities;\r\nhe enjoyed greater latitude than other Ambassadors had done or did later\r\non.\r\n\r\nI will say nothing about Count Arnim. We were never intimate or even on\r\nfriendly terms with each other. He was extremely stiff, and had a\r\nconsiderable amount of the _morgue prussienne_ in his ways, so that very\r\nfew people sympathised with him or with his opinions. Nevertheless, his\r\ntrial, and the long war which Prince Bismarck waged against him, aroused\r\nan interest in his fate which would not have existed under different\r\ncircumstances. But, all the same, one was not sorry when Prince\r\nHohenlohe succeeded him. The Prince was received with a certain amount\r\nof kind feeling such as could not have been expected under ordinary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe was one of the greatest among the grand seigneurs in\r\nGermany. He was related to the Royal Family of Prussia and to almost all\r\nthe crowned heads in Europe. He had been President of the Bavarian\r\nministry, and as such had shown great devotion to the cause of German\r\nunity. His character had always been above reproach, his tact was\r\nexquisite, and his straightforwardness was recognised even among the\r\nenemies of his political ideas and opinions. He was essentially a man of\r\nduty, and he never failed in its fulfilment, no matter how painful this\r\nmight be. All those who knew him respected him, and when he was sent to\r\nParis as Ambassador, it was felt among the diplomatic circles of Europe\r\nthat his presence there would help to do away with many prejudices and\r\nmisunderstandings.\r\n\r\nI was a frequent visitor at the house of Prince Clovis, as we called him\r\nfamiliarly, and whenever I left him it was with admiration for his\r\nshrewd intelligence and the logic displayed in all his reasonings and\r\nappreciations of men and of events. He had very few illusions, but at\r\nthe same time an excessive kindness in all his judgments of other\r\npeople. Ill-nature was unknown to him, and he was always ready to find\r\nexcuses for the mistakes he could not help noticing in his neighbours.\r\nPrince Hohenlohe was infinitely above all his contemporaries in\r\neverything, both as a private and as a public man, and in all the high\r\noffices which he held he won for himself the esteem and the affection of\r\nall who had to do with him.\r\n\r\nHe made himself liked, too, in Paris in those first years which followed\r\nupon the war, in spite of the natural prejudice which existed against\r\neverything German. He had some relatives in the Faubourg St. Germain,\r\nwhere both he and his wife were received with more cordiality than in\r\nofficial circles, and he felt more or less at home among them. This\r\nfact made him cling to his Paris mission, where it was felt at the time\r\nthat it would be difficult to replace him, and where, later on, his\r\nappointment as Chancellor of the German Empire was received with a\r\ncertain amount of sympathy.\r\n\r\nPrincess Hohenlohe was a fitting wife for that distinguished man. She\r\nwas also a _grande dame_, highly born and highly connected, with some of\r\nthe bluest blood in Europe flowing in her veins. She admirably filled\r\nher position as Ambassadress, and she made for herself in France, as\r\neverywhere else, a considerable number of friends.\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe’s successor, Count Munster, as I think I have already\r\nremarked, was in appearance more an Englishman than a German. His wife\r\nhad been English, and he affected great sympathies for everything that\r\nwas British, loving London, where he always declared he spent the\r\nhappiest time of his life, and crossing the Channel whenever he found it\r\npossible to do so. He was in Paris at the time of the Dreyfus affair,\r\nand contrived not to make for himself too many enemies, in spite of the\r\ndifficult position and circumstances in which he found himself during\r\nthat anxious period. Among diplomats he was liked, his advice being\r\nalways appreciated and mostly followed. I cannot say the same thing\r\nabout his successor, Prince Radolin, formerly Count Radolinski, who, in\r\nspite of the many years he remained in Paris, did not succeed in\r\nattaining the great position which had belonged to Prince Hohenlohe or\r\nto Count Munster.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter’s tenure of the German Embassy, the present Prince von\r\nBülow was one of his secretaries. Intelligent, clever in noticing what\r\nought to be noticed, and in not seeing the things which apparently did\r\nnot concern him, he contrived to keep himself exceedingly well _au\r\ncourant_ of all that was going on around him, and of the intentions and\r\ndesigns of French diplomacy. He was a man singularly unprejudiced, for\r\nwhom the end always justified the means. He may perhaps have had too\r\nhigh an opinion of his own merits, and too much confidence in his power\r\nto do always what he liked and wanted. He could make himself very\r\ncharming when he saw a personal advantage, and he was constantly on the\r\nlook out for the things that others did not see or did not care to\r\nnotice. His admiration for Prince Bismarck was unbounded, and he fondly\r\nnursed an ambition to replace him as Chancellor of the German Empire.\r\nEven at the time when he was a simple secretary at the Paris Embassy, he\r\ntold a friend of his that he would probably never become an ambassador,\r\nbut might, if circumstances favoured him, come to be at the head of\r\nGermany’s foreign policy.\r\n\r\nPrince Bülow, who fell from his high position because he had not\r\nunderstood the character of the Emperor William II., and imagined that\r\nthe latter would not notice or would forgive him for trying to keep him\r\nin leading-strings, married one of the most distinguished women in\r\nEurope, an Italian by birth, and the daughter of the Princesse de\r\nCamporeale. Madame Bülow was the wife of another German diplomat, Count\r\nDonhoff, when she made the acquaintance of the future Chancellor. No one\r\ncan doubt his love for the beautiful and intelligent woman who at\r\npresent is his wife.\r\n\r\nThe first Ambassador whom Russia sent to Paris after the signature of\r\npeace with Germany was Prince Orloff, one of her greatest noblemen. His\r\nexalted position and high moral character put him above any suspicion of\r\nplaying a double game between France and Prussia, and he had, moreover,\r\nthe advantage of being a personal friend of President Thiers. He\r\nremained at his post for something like ten years, and when he was\r\nremoved to Berlin, at the express desire of Prince Bismarck, his\r\ndeparture was mourned by all those who knew him.\r\n\r\nOf his successor, Baron Mohrenheim, I shall say no more than that he had\r\na very complex personality. He was not liked in France nor in Russia; it\r\nis said that he only kept his post because he enjoyed the protection of\r\nthe Empress Marie Feodorovna, the Consort of Alexander III.\r\n\r\nIt was M. Nelidoff who replaced him, and who remained in possession of\r\nthe Russian Embassy in Paris until his death. M. Nelidoff was a diplomat\r\nof the old school, who had spent almost his whole career in the East,\r\nand who had served under Count Ignatieff in Constantinople, accompanying\r\nhim to San Stefano, where his signature figures on the famous treaty\r\nwhich was signed there, and which Europe did not consent to accept. He\r\nwas not a man who would shrink with horror when seeing something dirty\r\nunder his feet, but rather one who would try not to step into it. No one\r\nknew better than he did how to get over a difficulty, or how to avoid a\r\nmistake. He can certainly be considered as an able diplomat, and\r\ncertainly also he cut a better figure in Paris than his successor, M.\r\nIzvolski, whom wicked tongues in St. Petersburg nicknamed Izvostchik,\r\nwhich means a cabdriver.\r\n\r\nPrince Orloff had had for private secretary during his stay in Paris\r\nCount Mouravieff, whom he took with him to Berlin, and who was\r\nultimately to be put in possession of the Russian Foreign Office after\r\nthe unexpected death of Prince Labanoff. Count Mouravieff was one of the\r\nmost charmingly amiable men that Russian diplomacy ever possessed. His\r\ntact was something surpassing, and his cleverness, which had no shade of\r\npedantry mixed with it, made him delightful. He has been accused of many\r\nthings, including that of not being either a good or a faithful friend.\r\nI have had occasion to see that this was a most unjust and untrue\r\nreproach, because Count Muravieff, far from deserting those who had been\r\nhis companions, when their worldly star did not shine any longer as\r\nbrightly as it had done, was, on the contrary, always eager to oblige\r\nthem in anything that he could possibly do for them, and kept up his\r\nrelations with them sometimes even at the cost of some personal\r\nsacrifices. He was not liked by those who saw in him a possible rival,\r\nhis quick career interfering with their own, but the few who knew him\r\nwell esteemed him as much as they appreciated his intelligence and his\r\npleasant conversation.\r\n\r\nI must, before ending with these few words of remembrance that I have\r\ngiven of my former colleagues, say something about the Italian\r\nAmbassador, Count Tornielli, or rather about his wife, who was a Russian\r\nby birth, a Countess Rostopschine, the granddaughter of that Count\r\nRostopschine who burned Moscow rather than give it up to Napoleon. She\r\nwas an amiable woman, whose house was always open to her compatriots;\r\none who had kept a great attachment for the land of her birth, and whose\r\nsalon was a favourite resort for those who cared more for clever\r\nconversation than for polo or for tennis. She had a sister, the Countess\r\nLydie Rostopschine, who has written several books full of interest,\r\namong them one called “Rastaquèropolis,” which is the best description\r\nthat has ever been published of Nice society and in general of the life\r\nand the people of the French Riviera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL’ENVOI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I think of all those bright, happy days I spent in Paris I regret\r\noften that I cannot live them over again. I had hoped to be allowed to\r\nend my days on the banks of the Seine, in the gay city which has always\r\nproved so attractive to Russians. St. Petersburg did not interest me any\r\nlonger. Its climate is far too severe for my old lungs and my\r\neverlasting rheumatism, and all the persons who were my friends in the\r\nold days have either died or disappeared from the social horizon. Fate\r\nruled it otherwise, and my seventy-five years have not been allowed to\r\nremain in Paris where they believed they had found a home. An Imperial\r\norder removes me to another place where very probably I shall miss the\r\nattractions of Paris, and the resources which it offers to a bookworm\r\nlike myself. Before going away I have read over again the reminiscences\r\nthat in my idle moments I have scribbled for the benefit of those who\r\ncare to read them when I am gone, and I have found a melancholy pleasure\r\nin doing so. It has been such a happy time, even for a misanthrope like\r\nmyself. Each time I have left Paris it has been a joy to return, and to\r\nlook once more on the familiar haunts where I used to walk in company\r\nwith friends who, alas! have already gone. Would that I could follow\r\nthem on that journey whence no one returns, before leaving Paris for\r\never; because at my age one cannot hope for anything that the morrow may\r\nbring along with it--this wonderful Paris, where is so much of what\r\nconstituted my former pleasures, will remain buried. Russia can only\r\nincrease my melancholy, it is so different from what it was when I was\r\nyoung, and when the sadness of the snow which covered its ground found\r\nno echo in my young heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCount Vassili’s wish was realised. He died just before his intended\r\ndeparture from the Paris he had loved so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbzac, Marquis d’, 151;\r\n  influence in Germany, 152\r\n\r\nAdam, Edmond, 191\r\n\r\n----, Mme.
