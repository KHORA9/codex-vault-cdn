MR. RONDEAU TO HORACE WALPOLE.\r\n\r\n\"PETERSBURG, _17th August, 1736_.[1]\r\n\r\n\" ... I heartily wish ... that the Turks could be brought to condescend\r\nto make the first step, for this Court seems resolved to hearken to\r\nnothing till that is done, to mortify the Porte, that has on all\r\noccasions spoken of the Russians with the greatest contempt, which the\r\nCzarina and her present Ministers cannot bear. Instead of being obliged\r\nto Sir Everard Fawkner and Mr. Thalman (the former the British, the\r\nlatter the Dutch Ambassador at Constantinople), for informing them of\r\nthe good dispositions of the Turks, Count Oestermann will not be\r\npersuaded that the Porte is sincere, and seemed very much surprised that\r\nthey had written to them (the Russian Cabinet) without order of the King\r\nand the States-General, or without being desired by the Grand Vizier,\r\nand that their letter had not been concerted with the Emperor's Minister\r\nat Constantinople.... I have shown Count Biron and Count Oestermann the\r\ntwo letters the Grand Vizier has written to the King, and at the same\r\ntime told these gentlemen that as there was in them several hard\r\nreflections on this Court, I should not have communicated them if they\r\nhad not been so desirous to see them. Count Biron said that was nothing,\r\nfor they were used to be treated in this manner by the Turks. I desired\r\ntheir Excellencies not to let the Porte know that they had seen these\r\nletters, which would sooner aggravate matters than contribute to make\r\nthem up....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 2. SIR GEORGE MACARTNEY TO THE EARL OF SANDWICH.\r\n\r\n\"ST. PETERSBURG, _1st (12th) March, 1765_.\r\n\r\n\"Most Secret.[2]\r\n\r\n\" ... Yesterday M. Panin[3] and the Vice-Chancellor, together with M.\r\nOsten, the Danish Minister, signed a treaty of alliance between this\r\nCourt and that of Copenhagen. By one of the articles, a war with Turkey\r\nis made a _casus foederis_; and whenever that event happens, Denmark\r\nbinds herself to pay Russia a subsidy of 500,000 roubles per annum, by\r\nquarterly payments. Denmark also, by a most secret article, promises to\r\ndisengage herself from all French connections, demanding only a limited\r\ntime to endeavour to obtain the arrears due to her by the Court of\r\nFrance. At all events, she is immediately to enter into all the views of\r\nRussia in Sweden, and to act entirely, though not openly, with her in\r\nthat kingdom. Either I am deceived or M. Gross[4] has misunderstood his\r\ninstructions, when he told your lordship that Russia intended to stop\r\nshort, and leave all the burden of Sweden upon England. However desirous\r\nthis Court may be that we should pay a large proportion of every\r\npecuniary engagement, yet, I am assured, she will always choose to take\r\nthe lead at Stockholm. Her design, her ardent wish, is to make a common\r\ncause with England and Denmark, for the total annihilation of the French\r\ninterest there. This certainly cannot be done without a considerable\r\nexpense; but Russia, at present, does not seem unreasonable enough to\r\nexpect that WE SHOULD PAY THE WHOLE. It has been hinted to me that\r\n£1,500 per annum, on our part, would be sufficient to support our\r\ninterest, and absolutely prevent the French from ever getting at\r\nStockholm again.\r\n\r\n\"The Swedes, highly sensible of, and very much mortified at, the\r\ndependent situation they have been in for many years, are extremely\r\njealous of every Power that intermeddles in their affairs, and\r\nparticularly so of their neighbours the Russians. This is the reason\r\nassigned to me for this Court's desiring that we and they should act\r\nupon SEPARATE bottoms, still preserving between our respective Ministers\r\na confidence without reserve. That our first care should be, not to\r\nestablish a faction under the name of a Russian or of an English\r\nfaction; but, as even the wisest men are imposed upon by a mere name, to\r\nendeavour to have OUR friends distinguished as the friends of liberty\r\nand independence. At present we have a superiority, and the generality\r\nof the nation is persuaded how very ruinous their French connections\r\nhave been, and, if continued, how very destructive they will be of their\r\ntrue interests. M. Panin does by no means desire that the smallest\r\nchange should be made in the constitution of Sweden.[5] He wishes that\r\nthe royal authority might be preserved without being augmented, and that\r\nthe privileges of the people should be continued without violation. He\r\nwas not, however, without his fears of the ambitious and intriguing\r\nspirit of the Queen, but the great ministerial vigilance of Count\r\nOestermann has now entirely quieted his apprehensions on that head.\r\n\r\n\"By this new alliance with Denmark, and by the success in Sweden, which\r\nthis Court has no doubt of, if properly seconded, M. Panin will, in some\r\nmeasure, have brought to bear his grand scheme of uniting the Powers of\r\nthe North.[6] Nothing, then, will be wanted to render it entirely\r\nperfect, but the conclusion of a treaty alliance with Great Britain. I\r\nam persuaded this Court desires it most ardently. The Empress has\r\nexpressed herself more than once, in terms that marked it strongly. Her\r\nambition is to form, by such an union, a certain counterpoise to the\r\nfamily compact,[7] and to disappoint, as much as possible, all the views\r\nof the Courts of Vienna and Versailles, against which she is irritated\r\nwith uncommon resentment. I am not, however, to conceal from your\r\nlordship that we can have no hope of any such alliance, unless we agree,\r\nby some secret article, to pay a subsidy in case of a Turkish war, for\r\nno money will be desired from us, except upon an emergency of that\r\nnature. I flatter myself I have persuaded this Court of the\r\nunreasonableness of expecting any subsidy in time of peace, and that an\r\nalliance upon an equal footing will be more safe and more honourable for\r\nboth nations. I can assure your lordship that a Turkish war's being a\r\n_casus foederis_, inserted either in the body of the treaty or in a\r\nsecret article, will be a _sine quâ non_ in every negotiation we may\r\nhave to open with this Court. The obstinacy of M. Panin upon that point\r\nis owing to the accident I am going to mention. When the treaty between\r\nthe Emperor and the King of Prussia was in agitation, the Count\r\nBestoucheff, who is a mortal enemy to the latter, proposed the Turkish\r\nclause, persuaded that the King of Prussia would never submit to it, and\r\nflattering himself with the hopes of blowing up that negotiation by his\r\nrefusal. But this old politician, it seemed, was mistaken in his\r\nconjecture, for his Majesty immediately consented to the proposal on\r\ncondition that Russia should make no alliance with any other Power but\r\non the same terms.[8] This is the real fact, and to confirm it, a few\r\ndays since, Count Solme, the Prussian Minister, came to visit me, and\r\ntold me that if this Court had any intention of concluding an alliance\r\nwith ours without such a clause, he had orders to oppose it in the\r\nstrongest manner. Hints have been given me that if Great Britain were\r\nless inflexible in that article, Russia will be less inflexible in the\r\narticle of export duties in the Treaty of Commerce, which M. Gross told\r\nyour lordship this Court would never depart from. I was assured at the\r\nsame time, by a person in the highest degree of confidence with M.\r\nPanin, that if we entered upon the Treaty of Alliance the Treaty of\r\nCommerce would go on with it _passibus æquis_; that then the latter\r\nwould be entirely taken out of the hands of the College of Trade, where\r\nso many cavils and altercations had been made, and would be settled only\r\nbetween the Minister and myself, and that he was sure it would be\r\nconcluded to our satisfaction, provided the Turkish clause was admitted\r\ninto the Treaty of Alliance. I was told, also, that in case the\r\nSpaniards attacked Portugal, we might have 15,000 Russians in our pay to\r\nsend upon that service. I must entreat your lordship on no account to\r\nmention to M. Gross the secret article of the Danish Treaty.... That\r\ngentleman, I am afraid, is no well-wisher to England.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 3.--SIR JAMES HARRIS TO LORD GRANTHAM.\r\n\r\n\"Petersburg, 16 (27 August), 1782.\r\n\r\n\"(Private.)\r\n\r\n\" ... On my arrival here I found the Court very different from what it\r\nhad been described to me. So far from any partiality to England, its\r\nbearings were entirely French. The King of Prussia (then in possession\r\nof the Empress' ear) was exerting his influence against us. Count Panin\r\nassisted him powerfully; Lacy and Corberon, the Bourbon Ministers, were\r\nartful and intriguing; Prince Potemkin had been wrought upon by them;\r\nand the whole tribe which surrounded the Empress--the Schuwaloffs,\r\nStroganoffs, and Chernicheffs--were what they still are, _garçons\r\nperruquiers de Paris_. Events seconded their endeavours. The assistance\r\nthe French affected to afford Russia in settling its disputes with the\r\nPorte, and the two Courts being immediately after united as mediators at\r\nthe Peace of Teschen, contributed not a little to reconcile them to each\r\nother. I was, therefore, not surprised that all my negotiations with\r\nCount Panin, _from February, 1778, to July, 1779_, should be\r\nunsuccessful, as he meant to prevent, not to promote, an alliance. It\r\nwas in vain we made concessions to obtain it. He ever started fresh\r\ndifficulties; had ever fresh obstacles ready. A very serious evil\r\nresulted, in the meanwhile, from my apparent confidence in him. He\r\navailed himself of it to convey in his reports to the Empress, not the\r\nlanguage I employed, and the sentiments I actually expressed, but the\r\nlanguage and sentiments he wished I should employ and express. He was\r\nequally careful to conceal her opinions and feelings from me; and while\r\nhe described England to her as obstinate, and overbearing, and reserved,\r\nhe described the Empress to me as displeased, disgusted, and indifferent\r\nto our concerns; and he was so convinced that, by this double\r\nmisrepresentation, he had shut up every avenue of success that, at the\r\ntime when I presented to him the Spanish declaration, he ventured to say\r\nto me, ministerially, '_That Great Britain had, by its own haughty\r\nconduct, brought down all its misfortunes on itself; that they were now\r\nat their height; that we must consent to any concession to obtain peace;\r\nand that we could expect neither assistance from our friends nor\r\nforbearance from our enemies._' I had temper enough not to give way to\r\nmy feelings on this occasion.... I applied, without loss of time, to\r\nPrince Potemkin, and, by his means, the Empress _condescended_ to see me\r\nalone at Peterhoff. I was so fortunate in this interview, as not only to\r\nefface all bad impressions she had against us, but by stating in its\r\ntrue light, our situation, and THE INSEPARABLE INTERESTS OF GREAT\r\nBRITAIN AND RUSSIA, to raise in her mind a decided resolution to assist\r\nus. _This resolution she declared to me in express words._ When this\r\ntranspired--and Count Panin was the first who knew it--he became my\r\nimplacable and inveterate enemy. He not only thwarted by falsehoods and\r\nby a most undue exertion of his influence my public negotiations, but\r\nemployed every means the lowest and most vindictive malice could suggest\r\nto depreciate and injure me personally; and from the very infamous\r\naccusations with which he charged me, had I been prone to fear, I might\r\nhave apprehended the most infamous attacks at his hands. This relentless\r\npersecution still continues; it has outlived his Ministry.\r\n_Notwithstanding the positive assurances I had received from the Empress\r\nherself_, he found means, first to stagger, and afterwards to alter her\r\nresolutions. He was, indeed, very officiously assisted by his Prussian\r\nMajesty, who, at the time, was as much bent on oversetting our interest\r\nas he now seems eager to restore it. I was not, however, disheartened by\r\nthis first disappointment, and, by redoubling my efforts, _I have twice\r\nmore, during the course of my mission, brought the Empress to the verge_\r\n(!) _of standing forth our professed friend_, and, each time, my\r\n_expectations were grounded on assurances from her own mouth_. The first\r\nwas when _our enemies conjured up the armed_ neutrality;[10] the other\r\nWHEN MINORCA WAS OFFERED HER. Although, on the first of these occasions,\r\nI found the same opposition from the same quarter I had experienced\r\nbefore, yet I am compelled to say that the principal cause of my failure\r\nwas attributable to the very awkward manner in which we replied to the\r\nfamous neutral declaration of February, 1780. As I well knew from what\r\nquarter the blow would come, I was prepared to parry it. _My opinion\r\nwas: 'If England feels itself strong enough to do without Russia, let it\r\nreject at once these new-fangled doctrines; but if its situation is such\r\nas to want assistance, let it yield to the necessity of the hour,\r\nrecognise them as far as they relate to_ RUSSIA ALONE, _and by a\r\nwell-timed act of complaisance insure itself a powerful friend._'[11] My\r\nopinion was _not_ received; an ambiguous and trimming answer was given;\r\n_we seemed equally afraid to accept or dismiss them. I was instructed\r\nsecretly to oppose, but avowedly to acquiesce in them_, and some\r\nunguarded expressions of one of its then confidential servants, made use\r\nof in speaking to Mr. Simolin, in direct contradiction to the temperate\r\nand cordial language that Minister had heard from Lord Stormont,\r\n_irritated_ the Empress to the last degree, and completed the _dislike_\r\nand _bad opinion_ she entertained of that Administration.[12] Our\r\nenemies took advantage of these _circumstances_.... I SUGGESTED THE IDEA\r\nOF GIVING UP MINORCA TO THE EMPRESS, _because, as it was evident to me\r\nwe should at the peace be compelled to make sacrifices, it seemed to me\r\nwiser to make them to our friends than to our enemies_. THE IDEA WAS\r\nADOPTED AT HOME IN ITS WHOLE EXTENT,[13] _and nothing could be more\r\nperfectly calculated to the meridian of this Court than the judicious\r\ninstructions I received on this occasion from Lord Stormont. Why_ this\r\nproject failed I am still at a loss to learn. _I never knew the Empress\r\nincline so strongly to any one measure as she did to this, before I had\r\nmy full powers to treat, nor was I ever more astonished than when I\r\nfound her shrink from her purpose when they arrived._ I imputed it at\r\nthe same time, in my own mind, to the _rooted aversion she had for our\r\nMinistry_, and her _total want of confidence in them_; but I since am\r\nmore strongly disposed to believe that she consulted the Emperor (of\r\nAustria) on the subject, and that he not only prevailed on her to\r\ndecline the offer, but betrayed the secret to France, and that it thus\r\nbecame public. I cannot otherwise account for this rapid _change of\r\nsentiment in the Empress_, particularly as _Prince Potemkin_ (whatever\r\nhe might be in other transactions) was certainly in this _cordial and\r\nsincere_ in his support, and both from what I saw at the time, and from\r\nwhat has since come to my knowledge, _had its success at heart as much\r\nas myself_. You will observe, my lord, that _the idea of bringing the\r\nEmpress forward as a friendly mediatrix went hand-in-hand with the\r\nproposed cession of Minorca_. As this idea has given rise to what has\r\nsince followed, and involved us in all the dilemmas of the present\r\nmediation, it will be necessary for me to explain what my views then\r\nwere, and to exculpate myself from the blame of having placed my Court\r\nin so embarrassing a situation, _my wish and intention was that she\r\nshould be sole mediatrix without an adjoint_; if you have perused what\r\npassed between her and me, in December, 1780, your lordship will readily\r\nperceive how very potent reasons I had to imagine she would be a\r\nfriendly and even a partial one.[14] I knew, indeed, she was unequal to\r\nthe task; but I knew, too, how greatly _her vanity_ would be flattered\r\nby this distinction, and was well aware that when once engaged she would\r\npersist, and be inevitably involved in our quarrel, particularly when it\r\nshould appear (and appear it would) that we had _gratified_ her with\r\nMinorca. The annexing to the mediation the other (Austrian) Imperial\r\nCourt entirely overthrew this plan. It not only afforded her a pretence\r\nfor not keeping her word, but piqued and mortified her; and it was under\r\nthis impression that she made over the whole business to the colleague\r\nwe had given her, and ordered her Minister at Vienna to subscribe\r\nimplicitly to whatever the Court proposed. Hence all the evils which\r\nhave since arisen, and hence those we at this moment experience. I\r\nmyself could never be brought to believe that the Court of Vienna, as\r\nlong as Prince Kaunitz directs its measures, can mean England any good\r\nor France any harm. It was not with that view that I endeavoured to\r\npromote its influence here, but because _I found that of Prussia in\r\nconstant opposition to me_; and because I thought that if I could by any\r\nmeans smite this, I should get rid of my greatest obstacle. I was\r\nmistaken, and, by a singular fatality, the Courts of Vienna and Berlin\r\nseem never to have agreed in anything but in the disposition to\r\nprejudice us here by turns.[15] The proposal relative to Minorca was the\r\nlast attempt I made to induce the Empress to stand forth. I had\r\nexhausted my strength and resources; the freedom with which I had spoken\r\nin my last interview with her, though respectful, had _displeased_; and\r\n_from this period to the removal of the late Administration_, I have\r\nbeen reduced to act on the defensive.... I have had more difficulty in\r\npreventing the Empress from doing harm than I ever had in attempting to\r\nengage her to do us good. It was to prevent evil, that I inclined\r\nstrongly for the acceptation of _her single mediation between us and\r\nHolland, when her Imperial Majesty first offered it_. The _extreme\r\ndissatisfaction_ she expressed _at our refusal_ justified my opinion;\r\nand I TOOK UPON ME, when it was proposed a second time, _to urge the\r\nnecessity of its being agreed to_ (ALTHOUGH I KNEW IT TO BE IN\r\nCONTRADICTION OF THE SENTIMENTS OF MY PRINCIPAL), since I firmly\r\nbelieved, had we again declined it, the Empress would, in a _moment of\r\nanger_, have joined the Dutch against us. As it is, _all has gone on\r\nwell_; our _judicious_ conduct has transferred to them the _ill-humour_\r\nshe originally was in with us, and she now is as partial to our cause as\r\nshe was before partial to theirs. _Since the new Ministry in England, my\r\nroad has been made smoother_; the great and new path struck out by _your\r\npredecessor,[16] and which you, my lord, pursue_, has operated a most\r\nadvantageous change in our favour upon the Continent. Nothing, indeed,\r\nbut events which come home to her, will, I believe, ever induce her\r\nImperial Majesty to take an active part; but there is now a _strong glow\r\nof friendship_ in our favour; she approves our measures; she _trusts_\r\nour Ministry, and _she gives way to that predilection she certainly has\r\nfor our nation_. Our enemies know and feel this; it keeps them in awe.\r\nThis is a succinct but accurate sketch of what has passed at this Court\r\nfrom the day of my arrival at Petersburg to the present hour. Several\r\ninferences may be deduced from it.[17] That the Empress is led by her\r\npassions, not by reason and argument; that her prejudices are very\r\nstrong, easily acquired, and, when once fixed, irremovable; while, on\r\nthe contrary, there is no sure road to her good opinion; that even when\r\nobtained, it is subject to perpetual fluctuation, and liable to be\r\nbiassed by the most trifling incidents; that till she is fairly embarked\r\nin a plan, no assurances can be depended on; but that when once fairly\r\nembarked, she never retracts, and may be carried any length; that with\r\nvery bright parts, an elevated mind, an uncommon sagacity, she wants\r\n_judgment_, _precision of idea_, _reflection_, _and_ L'ESPRIT DE\r\nCOMBINAISON(!!) That her Ministers are either ignorant of, or\r\nindifferent to, the welfare of the State, and act from a passive\r\nsubmission to her will, or from motives of party and private\r\ninterests.\"[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. (MANUSCRIPT) ACCOUNT OF RUSSIA DURING THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE REIGN\r\nOF THE EMPEROR PAUL, DRAWN UP BY THE REV. L. K. PITT, CHAPLAIN TO THE\r\nFACTORY OF ST. PETERSBURG, AND A NEAR RELATIVE OF WILLIAM PITT.[19]\r\n\r\n_Extract._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"There can scarcely exist a doubt concerning the real sentiments of\r\n     the late Empress of Russia on the great points which have, within\r\n     the last few years, convulsed the whole system of European\r\n     politics. She certainly felt from the beginning the fatal tendency\r\n     of the new principles, but was not, perhaps, displeased to see\r\n     every European Power exhausting itself in a struggle which raised,\r\n     in proportion to its violence, her own importance. It is more than\r\n     probable that the state of the newly acquired provinces in Poland\r\n     was likewise a point which had considerable influence over the\r\n     political conduct of Catherine. The fatal effects resulting from an\r\n     apprehension of revolt in the late seat of conquest seem to have\r\n     been felt in a very great degree by the combined Powers, who in the\r\n     early period of the Revolution were so near reinstating the regular\r\n     Government in France. The same dread of revolt in Poland, which\r\n     divided the attention of the combined Powers and hastened their\r\n     retreat, deterred likewise the late Empress of Russia from entering\r\n     on the great theatre of war, until a combination of circumstances\r\n     rendered the progress of the French armies a more dangerous evil\r\n     than any which could possibly result to the Russian Empire from\r\n     active operations.... The last words which the Empress was known to\r\n     utter were addressed to her Secretary when she dismissed him on the\r\n     morning on which she was seized: 'Tell Prince' (Zuboff), she said,\r\n     'to come to me at twelve, and to remind me of signing the Treaty of\r\n     Alliance with England.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving entered into ample considerations on the Emperor Paul's acts and\r\nextravagances, the Rev. Mr. Pitt continues as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"When these considerations are impressed on the mind, the nature of\r\n     the late secession from the coalition, and of the incalculable\r\n     indignities offered to the Government of Great Britain, can alone\r\n     be fairly estimated.... BUT THE TIES WHICH BIND HER (GREAT BRITAIN)\r\n     TO THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE ARE FORMED BY NATURE, AND INVIOLABLE. United,\r\n     these nations might almost brave the united world; divided, the\r\n     strength and importance of each is FUNDAMENTALLY impaired. England\r\n     has reason to regret with Russia that the imperial sceptre should\r\n     be thus inconsistently wielded, but it is the sovereign of Russia\r\n     alone who divides the Empires.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman concludes his account by the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"As far as human foresight can at this moment penetrate, the\r\n     despair of an enraged individual seems a more probable means to\r\n     terminate the present scene of oppression than any more systematic\r\n     combination of measures to restore the throne of Russia to its\r\n     dignity and importance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This letter relates to the war against Turkey, commenced by the\r\nEmpress Ann in 1735. The British diplomatist at St. Petersburg is\r\nreporting about his endeavours to induce Russia to conclude peace with\r\nthe Turks. The passages omitted are irrelevant.\r\n\r\n[2] England was at that time negotiating a commercial treaty with\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n[3] To this time it has remained among historians a point of\r\ncontroversy, whether or not Panin was in the pay of Frederick II. of\r\nPrussia, and whether he was so behind the back of Catherine, or at her\r\nbidding. There can exist no doubt that Catherine II., in order to\r\nidentify foreign Courts with Russian Ministers, allowed Russian\r\nMinisters ostensibly to identify themselves with foreign Courts. As to\r\nPanin in particular, the question is, however, decided by an authentic\r\ndocument which we believe has never been published. It proves that,\r\nhaving once become the man of Frederick II., he was forced to remain so\r\nat the risk of his honour, fortune and life.\r\n\r\n[4] The Russian Minister at London.\r\n\r\n[5] The oligarchic Constitution set up by the Senate after the death of\r\nCharles XII.\r\n\r\n[6] Thus we learn from Sir George Macartney that what is commonly known\r\nas Lord Chatham's \"grand conception of the Northern Alliance,\" was, in\r\nfact, Panin's \"grand scheme of uniting the Powers of the North.\" Chatham\r\nwas duped into fathering the Muscovite plan.\r\n\r\n[7] The compact between the Bourbons of France and Spain concluded at\r\nParis on August, 1761.\r\n\r\n[8] This was a subterfuge on the part of Frederick II. The manner in\r\nwhich Frederick was forced into the arms of the Russian Alliance is\r\nplainly told by M. Koch, the French professor of diplomacy and teacher\r\nof Talleyrand. \"Frederick II.,\" he says, \"having been abandoned by the\r\nCabinet of London, could not but attach himself to Russia.\" (See his\r\n_History of the Revolutions in Europe_.)\r\n\r\n[9] Horace Walpole characterises his epoch by the words--\"_It was the\r\nmode of the times to be paid by one favour for receiving another._\" At\r\nall events, it will be seen from the text that such was the mode of\r\nRussia in transacting business with England. The Earl of Sandwich, to\r\nwhom Sir George Macartney could dare to address the above despatch,\r\ndistinguished himself, ten years later, in 1775, as First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, in the North Administration, by the vehement opposition he\r\nmade to Lord Chatham's motion for an equitable _adjustment of the\r\nAmerican difficulties_. \"He could not believe it (Chatham's motion) _the\r\nproduction of a British peer_; it appeared to him rather _the work of\r\nsome American_.\" In 1777, we find Sandwich again blustering: \"he would\r\nhazard every drop of blood, as well as the last shilling of the national\r\ntreasure, rather than allow Great Britain to be defied, bullied, and\r\ndictated to, by her disobedient and rebellious subjects.\" Foremost as\r\nthe Earl of Sandwich was in entangling England in war with her North\r\nAmerican colonies, with France, Spain, and Holland, we behold him\r\nconstantly accused in Parliament by Fox, Burke, Pitt, etc., \"of keeping\r\nthe naval force inadequate to the defence of the country; of\r\nintentionally opposing small English forces where he knew the enemy to\r\nhave concentrated large ones; of utter mismanagement of the service in\r\nall its departments,\" etc. (See debates of the House of Commons of 11th\r\nMarch, 1778; 31st March, 1778; February, 1779; Fox's motion of censure\r\non Lord Sandwich; 9th April, 1779, address to the King for the dismissal\r\nof Lord Sandwich from his service, on account of misconduct in service;\r\n7th February, 1782, Fox's motion that there had been gross mismanagement\r\nin the administration of naval affairs during the year 1781.) On this\r\noccasion Pitt imputed to Lord Sandwich \"all our naval disasters and\r\ndisgraces.\" The ministerial majority against the motion amounted to only\r\n22 in a House of 388. On the 22nd February, 1782, a similar motion\r\nagainst Lord Sandwich was only negatived by a majority of 19 in a House\r\nof 453. Such, indeed, was the character of the Earl of Sandwich's\r\nAdministration that more than thirty distinguished officers quitted the\r\nnaval service, or declared they could not act under the existing system.\r\nIn point of fact, during his whole tenure of office, serious\r\napprehensions were entertained of the consequences of the dissensions\r\nthen prevalent in the navy. Besides, the Earl of Sandwich was openly\r\naccused, and, as far as circumstantial evidence goes, convicted of\r\nPECULATION. (See debates of the House of Lords, 31st March, 1778; 9th\r\nApril, 1779, and _seq._) When the motion for his removal from office was\r\nnegatived on April 9th 1779, thirty-nine peers entered their protest.\r\n\r\n[10] Sir James Harris affects to believe that Catherine II. was not the\r\nauthor of, but a convert to, the armed neutrality of 1780. It is one of\r\nthe grand stratagems of the Court of St. Petersburg to give to its own\r\nschemes the form of proposals suggested to and pressed on itself by\r\nforeign Courts. Russian diplomacy delights in those _quæ pro quo_. Thus\r\nthe Court of Florida Bianca was made the responsible editor of the armed\r\nneutrality, and, from a report that vain-glorious Spaniard addressed to\r\nCarlos III., one may see how immensely he felt flattered at the idea of\r\nhaving not only hatched the armed neutrality but allured Russia into\r\nabetting it.\r\n\r\n[11] This same Sir James Harris, perhaps more familiar to the reader\r\nunder the name of the Earl of Malmesbury, is extolled by English\r\nhistorians as the man who prevented England from surrendering the right\r\nof search in the Peace Negotiations of 1782-83.\r\n\r\n[12] It might be inferred from this passage and similar ones occurring\r\nin the text, that Catherine II. had caught a real Tartar in Lord North,\r\nwhose Administration Sir James Harris is pointing at. Any such delusion\r\nwill disappear before the simple statement that the first partition of\r\nPoland took place under Lord North's Administration, without any protest\r\non his part. In 1773 Catherine's war against Turkey still continuing,\r\nand her conflicts with Sweden growing serious, France made preparations\r\nto send a powerful fleet into the Baltic. D'Aiguillon, the French\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, communicated this plan to Lord Stormont,\r\nthe then English Ambassador at Paris. In a long conversation,\r\nD'Aiguillon dwelt largely on the ambitious designs of Russia, and the\r\ncommon interest that ought to blend France and England into a joint\r\nresistance against them. In answer to this confidential communication,\r\nhe was informed by the English Ambassador that, \"if France sent her\r\nships into the Baltic, they would instantly be followed by a British\r\nfleet; that the presence of two fleets would have no more effect than a\r\nneutrality; and however the British Court might desire to preserve the\r\nharmony now subsisting between England and France, it was impossible to\r\nforesee the contingencies that might arise from accidental collision.\"\r\nIn consequence of these representations, D'Aiguillon countermanded the\r\nsquadron at Brest, but gave new orders for the equipment of an armament\r\nat Toulon. \"On receiving intelligence of these renewed preparations, the\r\nBritish Cabinet made instant and vigorous demonstrations of resistance;\r\nLord Stormont was ordered to declare that every argument used respecting\r\nthe Baltic applied equally to the Mediterranean. A memorial also was\r\npresented to the French Minister, accompanied by a demand that it should\r\nbe laid before the King and Council. This produced the desired effect;\r\nthe armament was countermanded, the sailors disbanded, and the chances\r\nof an extensive warfare avoided.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Lord North_,\" says the complacent writer from whom we have borrowed\r\nthe last lines, \"_thus effectually served the cause of his ally_\r\n(Catherine II.), _and facilitated the treaty of peace_ (of\r\nKutchuk-Kainardji) _between Russia and the Porte_.\" Catherine II.\r\nrewarded Lord North's good services, first by withholding the aid she\r\nhad promised him in case of a war between England and the North American\r\nColonies, and in the second place, by conjuring up and leading the armed\r\nneutrality against England. Lord North DARED NOT _repay, as he was\r\nadvised by Sir James Harris_, this treacherous breach of faith by giving\r\nup to Russia, and to _Russia alone_, the maritime rights of Great\r\nBritain. Hence the irritation in the nervous system of the Czarina; the\r\nhysterical fancy she caught all at once of \"entertaining a bad opinion\"\r\nof Lord North, of \"disliking\" him, of feeling a \"rooted aversion\"\r\nagainst him, of being afflicted with \"a total want of confidence,\" etc.\r\nIn order to give the Shelburne Administration a warning example, Sir\r\nJames Harris draws up a minute psychological picture of the feelings of\r\nthe Czarina, and the disgrace incurred by the North Administration, for\r\nhaving wounded these same feelings. His prescription is very simple:\r\nsurrender to Russia, as our friend, everything for asking which we would\r\nconsider every other Power our enemy.\r\n\r\n[13] It is then a fact that the English Government, not satisfied with\r\nhaving made Russia a Baltic power, strove hard to make her a\r\nMediterranean power too. The offer of the surrender of Minorca appears\r\nto have been made to Catherine II. at the end of 1779, or the beginning\r\nof 1780, shortly after Lord Stormont's entrance into the North\r\nCabinet--the same Lord Stormont we have seen thwarting the French\r\nattempts at resistance against Russia, and whom even Sir James Harris\r\ncannot deny the merit of having written \"_instructions perfectly\r\ncalculated to the meridian of the Court of St. Petersburg_.\" While Lord\r\nNorth's Cabinet, at the suggestion of Sir James Harris, offered Minorca\r\nto the _Muscovites_, the English Commoners and people were still\r\ntrembling for fear lest the _Hanoverians_ (?) should wrest out of their\r\nhands \"one of the keys of the Mediterranean.\" On the 26th of October,\r\n1775, the King, in his opening speech, had informed Parliament, amongst\r\nother things, that he had Sir James Graham's own words, when asked why\r\nthey should not have kept up some blockade pending the settlement of the\r\n\"plan,\" \"_They did not take that responsibility upon themselves._\" The\r\nresponsibility of executing their orders! The despatch we have quoted is\r\nthe only despatch read, except one of a later date. The despatch, said\r\nto be sent on the 5th of April, in which \"the Admiral is ordered to use\r\nthe _largest discretionary power_ in blockading the Russian ports in the\r\nBlack Sea,\" is not read, nor any replies from Admiral Dundas. The\r\nAdmiralty sent _Hanoverian_ troops to Gibraltar and Port Mahon\r\n(Minorca), to replace such British regiments as should be drawn from\r\nthose garrisons for service in America. An amendment to the address was\r\nproposed by Lord John Cavendish, strongly condemning \"the confiding\r\n_such important fortresses as Gibraltar and Port Mahon to foreigners_.\"\r\nAfter very stormy debates, in which the measure of entrusting Gibraltar\r\nand Minorca, \"_the keys of the Mediterranean_,\" as they were called, to\r\n_foreigners_, was furiously attacked; Lord North, acknowledging himself\r\nthe adviser of the measure, felt obliged to bring in a _bill of\r\nindemnity_. However, these foreigners, these Hanoverians, were the\r\nEnglish King's own subjects. Having virtually surrendered Minorca to\r\nRussia in 1780, Lord North was, of course, quite justified in treating,\r\non November 22, 1781, in the House of Commons, \"with utter scorn the\r\ninsinuation that _Ministers were in the pay of France_.\"\r\n\r\nLet us remark, _en passant_, that Lord North, one of the most base and\r\nmischievous Ministers England can boast of, perfectly mastered the art\r\nof keeping the House in perpetual laughter. So had Lord Sunderland. So\r\nhas Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n[14] Lord North having been supplanted by the Rockingham Administration,\r\non March 27, 1782, the celebrated Fox forwarded peace proposals to\r\nHolland through the mediation of the _Russian_ Minister. Now what were\r\nthe consequences of the _Russian mediation_ so much vaunted by this Sir\r\nJames Harris, the servile account keeper of the Czarina's sentiments,\r\nhumours, and feelings? While preliminary articles of peace had been\r\nconvened with France, Spain, and the American States, it was found\r\nimpossible to arrive at any such preliminary agreement with Holland.\r\nNothing but a simple cessation of hostilities was to be obtained from\r\nit. So powerful proved the _Russian mediation_, that on the 2nd\r\nSeptember, 1783, just one day before the conclusion of _definitive\r\ntreaties_ with America, France, and Spain, Holland condescended to\r\naccede to _preliminaries of peace_, and this not in consequence of the\r\n_Russian mediation_, but through the influence of _France_.\r\n\r\n[15] How much was England not prejudiced by the Courts of Vienna and\r\nParis thwarting the plan of the British Cabinet of ceding Minorca to\r\nRussia, and by Frederick of Prussia's resistance against the great\r\nChatham's scheme of a Northern Alliance under Muscovite auspices.\r\n\r\n[16] The predecessor is Fox. Sir James Harris establishes a complete\r\nscale of British Administrations, according to the degree in which they\r\nenjoyed the favour of his almighty Czarina. In spite of Lord Stormont,\r\nthe Earl of Sandwich, Lord North, and Sir James Harris himself; in spite\r\nof the partition of Poland, the bullying of D'Aiguillon, the treaty of\r\nKutchuk-Kainardji, and the intended cession of Minorca--Lord North's\r\nAdministration is relegated to the bottom of the heavenly ladder; far\r\nabove it has climbed the Rockingham Administration, whose soul was Fox,\r\nnotorious for his subsequent intrigues with Catherine; but at the top we\r\nbehold the Shelburne Administration, whose Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nwas the celebrated William Pitt. As to Lord Shelburne himself, Burke\r\nexclaimed in the House of Commons, that \"if he was not a Catalina or\r\nBorgia in morals, it must not be ascribed to anything but his\r\nunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Sir James Harris forgets deducing the main inference, that the\r\nAmbassador of England is the agent of Russia.\r\n\r\n[18] In the 18th century, English diplomatists' despatches, bearing on\r\ntheir front the sacramental inscription, \"Private,\" are despatches to be\r\nwithheld from the King by the Minister to whom they are addressed. That\r\nsuch was the case may be seen from Lord Mahon's _History of England_.\r\n\r\n[19] \"To be burnt after my death.\" Such are the words prefixed to the\r\nmanuscript by the gentleman whom it was addressed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe documents published in the first chapter extend from the reign of\r\nthe Empress Ann to the commencement of the reign of the Emperor Paul,\r\nthus encompassing the greater part of the 18th century. At the end of\r\nthat century it had become, as stated by the Rev. Mr. Pitt, the openly\r\nprofessed and orthodox dogma of English diplomacy, \"_that the ties which\r\nbind Great Britain to the Russian Empire are formed by nature, and\r\ninviolable_.\"\r\n\r\nIn perusing these documents, there is something that startles us even\r\nmore than their contents--viz., their form. All these letters are\r\n\"confidential,\" \"private,\" \"secret,\" \"most secret\"; but in spite of\r\nsecrecy, privacy, and confidence, the English statesmen converse among\r\neach other about Russia and her rulers in a tone of awful reserve,\r\nabject servility, and cynical submission, which would strike us even in\r\nthe public despatches of Russian statesmen. To conceal intrigues against\r\nforeign nations secrecy is recurred to by Russian diplomatists. The same\r\nmethod is adopted by English diplomatists freely to express their\r\ndevotion to a foreign Court. The secret despatches of Russian\r\ndiplomatists are fumigated with some equivocal perfume. It is one part\r\nthe _fumée de fausseté_, as the Duke of St. Simon has it, and the other\r\npart that coquettish display of one's own superiority and cunning which\r\nstamps upon the reports of the French Secret Police their indelible\r\ncharacter. Even the master despatches of Pozzo di Borgo are tainted with\r\nthis common blot of the _litérature de mauvais lieu_. In this point the\r\nEnglish secret despatches prove much superior. They do not affect\r\nsuperiority but silliness. For instance, can there be anything more\r\nsilly than Mr. Rondeau informing Horace Walpole that he has betrayed to\r\nthe Russian Minister the letters addressed by the Turkish Grand Vizier\r\nto the King of England, but that he had told \"at the same time those\r\ngentlemen that as there were several hard reflections on the Russian\r\nCourt he should not have communicated them, _if they had not been so\r\nanxious to see them_,\" and then told their excellencies not to tell the\r\nPorte that they had seen them (those letters)! At first view the infamy\r\nof the act is drowned in the silliness of the man. Or, take Sir George\r\nMacartney. Can there be anything more silly than his happiness that\r\nRussia seemed \"reasonable\" enough not to expect that England \"should pay\r\nthe WHOLE EXPENSES\" for Russia's \"choosing to take the lead at\r\nStockholm\"; or his \"flattering himself\" that he had \"persuaded the\r\nRussian Court\" not to be so \"unreasonable\" as to ask from England, in a\r\ntime of peace, subsidies for a time of war against Turkey (then the ally\r\nof England); or his warning the Earl of Sandwich \"not to mention\" to the\r\nRussian Ambassador at London the secrets mentioned to himself by the\r\nRussian Chancellor at St. Petersburg? Or can there be anything more\r\nsilly than Sir James Harris confidentially whispering into the ear of\r\nLord Grantham that Catherine II. was devoid of \"judgment, precision of\r\nidea, reflection, and _l'esprit de combinaison_\"?[20]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, take the cool impudence with which Sir George\r\nMacartney informs his minister that because the Swedes were extremely\r\njealous of, and mortified at, their dependence on Russia, England was\r\ndirected by the Court of St. Petersburg to do its work at Stockholm,\r\nunder the British colours of liberty and independence! Or Sir James\r\nHarris advising England to surrender to Russia Minorca and the right of\r\nsearch, and the monopoly of mediation in the affairs of the world--not\r\nin order to gain any material advantage, or even a formal engagement on\r\nthe part of Russia, but only \"a strong glow of friendship\" from the\r\nEmpress, and the transfer to France of her \"ill humour.\"\r\n\r\nThe secret Russian despatches proceed on the very plain line that\r\nRussia knows herself to have no common interests whatever with other\r\nnations, but that every nation must be persuaded separately to have\r\ncommon interests with Russia to the exclusion of every other nation. The\r\nEnglish despatches, on the contrary, never dare so much as hint that\r\nRussia has common interests with England, but only endeavour to convince\r\nEngland that she has Russian interests. The English diplomatists\r\nthemselves tell us that this was the single argument they pleaded, when\r\nplaced face to face with Russian potentates.\r\n\r\nIf the English despatches we have laid before the public were addressed\r\nto private friends, they would only brand with infamy the ambassadors\r\nwho wrote them. Secretly addressed as they are to the British Government\r\nitself, they nail it for ever to the pillory of history; and,\r\ninstinctively, this seems to have been felt, even by Whig writers,\r\nbecause none has dared to publish them.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises from which epoch this Russian character of\r\nEnglish diplomacy, become traditionary in the course of the 18th\r\ncentury, does date its origin. To clear up this point we must go back to\r\nthe time of Peter the Great, which, consequently, will form the\r\nprincipal subject of our researches. We propose to enter upon this task\r\nby reprinting some English pamphlets, written at the time of Peter I.,\r\nand which have either escaped the attention of modern historians, or\r\nappeared to them to merit none. However, they will suffice for refuting\r\nthe prejudice common to Continental and English writers, that the\r\ndesigns of Russia were not understood or suspected in England until at a\r\nlater, and too late, epoch; that the diplomatic relations between\r\nEngland and Russia were but the natural offspring of the mutual material\r\ninterests of the two countries; and that, therefore, in accusing the\r\nBritish statesmen of the 18th century of Russianism we should commit an\r\nunpardonable hysteron-proteron. If we have shown by the English\r\ndespatches that, at the time of the Empress Ann, England already\r\nbetrayed her own allies to Russia, it will be seen from the pamphlets we\r\nare now about to reprint that, even before the epoch of Ann, at the\r\nvery epoch of Russian ascendency in Europe, springing up at the time of\r\nPeter I., the plans of Russia were understood, and the connivance of\r\nBritish statesmen at these plans was denounced by English writers.\r\n\r\nThe first pamphlet we lay before the public is called _The Northern\r\nCrisis_. It was printed in London in 1716, and relates to the intended\r\nDano-Anglo-Russian _invasion of Skana_ (Schonen).\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1715 a northern alliance for the partition, not of\r\nSweden proper, but of what we may call the Swedish Empire, had been\r\nconcluded between Russia, Denmark, Poland, Prussia, and Hanover. That\r\npartition forms the first grand act of modern diplomacy--the logical\r\npremiss to the partition of Poland. The partition treaties relating to\r\nSpain have engrossed the interest of posterity because they were the\r\nforerunners of the War of Succession, and the partition of Poland drew\r\neven a larger audience because its last act was played upon a\r\ncontemporary stage. However, it cannot be denied that it was the\r\npartition of the Swedish Empire which inaugurated the modern era of\r\ninternational policy. The partition treaty not even pretended to have a\r\npretext, save the misfortune of its intended victim. For the first time\r\nin Europe the violation of all treaties was not only made, but\r\nproclaimed the common basis of a new treaty. Poland herself, in the drag\r\nof Russia, and personated by that commonplace of immorality, Augustus\r\nII., Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, was pushed into the\r\nforeground of the conspiracy, thus signing her own death-warrant, and\r\nnot even enjoying the privilege reserved by Polyphemus to Odysseus--to\r\nbe last eaten. Charles XII. predicted her fate in the manifesto flung\r\nagainst King Augustus and the Czar, from his voluntary exile at Bender.\r\nThe manifesto is dated January 28, 1711.\r\n\r\nThe participation in this partition treaty threw England within the\r\norbit of Russia, towards whom, since the days of the \"Glorious\r\nRevolution,\" she had more and more gravitated. George I., as King of\r\nEngland, was bound to a defensive alliance with Sweden by the treaty of\r\n1700. Not only as King of England, but as Elector of Hanover, he was\r\none of the guarantees, and even of the direct parties to the treaty of\r\nTravendal, which secured to Sweden what the partition treaty intended\r\nstripping her of. Even his German electoral dignity he partly owed to\r\nthat treaty. However, as Elector of Hanover he declared war against\r\nSweden, which he waged as King of England.\r\n\r\nIn 1715 the confederates had divested Sweden of her German provinces,\r\nand to effect that end introduced the Muscovite on the German soil. In\r\n1716 they agreed to invade Sweden Proper--to attempt an armed descent\r\nupon Schonen--the southern extremity of Sweden now constituting the\r\ndistricts of Malmoe and Christianstadt. Consequently Peter of Russia\r\nbrought with him from Germany a Muscovite army, which was scattered over\r\nZealand, thence to be conveyed to Schonen, under the protection of the\r\nEnglish and Dutch fleets sent into the Baltic, on the false pretext of\r\nprotecting trade and navigation. Already in 1715, when Charles XII. was\r\nbesieged in Stralsund, eight English men-of-war, lent by England to\r\nHanover, and by Hanover to Denmark, had openly reinforced the Danish\r\nnavy, and even hoisted the Danish flag. In 1716 the British navy was\r\ncommanded by his Czarish Majesty in person.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready for the invasion of Schonen, there arose a\r\ndifficulty from a side where it was least expected. Although the treaty\r\nstipulated only for 30,000 Muscovites, Peter, in his magnanimity, had\r\nlanded 40,000 on Zealand; but now that he was to send them on the errand\r\nto Schonen, he all at once discovered that out of the 40,000 he could\r\nspare but 15,000. This declaration not only paralysed the military plan\r\nof the confederates, it seemed to threaten the security of Denmark and\r\nof Frederick IV., its king, as great part of the Muscovite army,\r\nsupported by the Russian fleet, occupied Copenhagen. One of the generals\r\nof Frederick proposed suddenly to fall with the Danish cavalry upon the\r\nMuscovites and to exterminate them, while the English men-of-war should\r\nburn the Russian fleet. Averse to any perfidy which required some\r\ngreatness of will, some force of character, and some contempt of\r\npersonal danger, Frederick IV. rejected the bold proposal, and limited\r\nhimself to assuming an attitude of defence. He then wrote a begging\r\nletter to the Czar, intimating that he had given up his Schonen fancy,\r\nand requested the Czar to do the same and find his way home: a request\r\nthe latter could not but comply with. When Peter at last left Denmark\r\nwith his army, the Danish Court thought fit to communicate to the Courts\r\nof Europe a public account of the incidents and transactions which had\r\nfrustrated the intended descent upon Schonen--and this document forms\r\nthe starting point of _The Northern Crisis_.\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to Baron Görtz, dated from London, January 23,\r\n1717, by Count Gyllenborg, there occur some passages in which the\r\nlatter, the then Swedish ambassador at the Court of St. James's, seems\r\nto profess himself the author of _The Northern Crisis_, the title of\r\nwhich he does not, however, quote. Yet any idea of his having written\r\nthat powerful pamphlet will disappear before the slightest perusal of\r\nthe Count's authenticated writings, such as his letters to Görtz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE NORTHERN CRISIS; OR IMPARTIAL REFLECTIONS ON THE POLICIES OF THE\r\nCZAR; OCCASIONED BY MYNHEER VON STOCKEN'S REASONS FOR DELAYING THE\r\nDESCENT UPON SCHONEN.

'Tis (the present pamphlet) not fit for lawyers'\r\nclerks, but it is highly convenient to be read by those who are proper\r\nstudents in the laws of nations; 'twill be but lost time for any\r\nstock-jobbing, trifling dealer in Exchange-Alley to look beyond the\r\npreface on't, but every merchant in England (more especially those who\r\ntrade to the Baltic) will find his account in it. The Dutch (as the\r\ncourants and postboys have more than once told us) are about to mend\r\ntheir hands, if they can, in several articles of trade with the Czar,\r\nand they have been a long time about it to little purpose. Inasmuch as\r\nthey are such a frugal people, they are good examples for the imitation\r\nof our traders; but if we can outdo them for once, in the means of\r\nprojecting a better and more expeditious footing to go upon, for the\r\nemolument of us both, let us, for once, be wise enough to set the\r\nexample, and let them, for once, be our imitators. This little treatise\r\nwill show a pretty plain way how we may do it, as to our trade in the\r\nBaltic, at this juncture. I desire no little _coffee-house politician_\r\nto meddle with it; but to give him even a disrelish for my company. I\r\nmust let him know that he is not fit for mine. Those who are even\r\nproficients in state science, will find in it matter highly fit to\r\nemploy all their powers of speculation, which they ever before past\r\nnegligently by, and thought (too cursorily) were not worth the\r\nregarding. No outrageous party-man will find it at all for his purpose;\r\nbut every _honest Whig_ and every _honest Tory_ may each of them read\r\nit, not only without either of their disgusts, but with the satisfaction\r\nof them both.... 'Tis not fit, in fine, for a mad, hectoring,\r\nPresbyterian Whig, or a raving, fretful, dissatisfied, Jacobite Tory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE REASONS HANDED ABOUT BY MYNHEER VON STOCKEN FOR DELAYING THE\r\nDESCENT UPON SCHONEN.\r\n\r\n\"There being no doubt, but most courts will be surprised that the\r\ndescent upon Schonen has not been put into execution, notwithstanding\r\nthe great preparations made for that purpose; and that all his Czarish\r\nMajesty's troops, who were in Germany, were transported to Zealand, not\r\nwithout great trouble and danger, partly by his own gallies, and partly\r\nby his Danish Majesty's and other vessels; and that the said descent is\r\ndeferred till another time. His Danish Majesty hath therefore, in order\r\nto clear himself of all imputation and reproach, thought fit to order,\r\nthat the following true account of this affair should be given to all\r\nimpartial persons. Since the Swedes were entirely driven out of their\r\n_German_ dominions, there was, according to all the rules of policy, and\r\nreasons of war, no other way left, than vigorously to attack the still\r\nobstinate King of Sweden, in the very heart of his country; thereby,\r\nwith God's assistance, to force him to a lasting, good and advantageous\r\npeace for the allies. The King of Denmark and his Czarish Majesty were\r\nboth of this opinion, and did, in order to put so good a design in\r\nexecution, agree upon an interview, which at last (notwithstanding his\r\nDanish Majesty's presence, upon the account of Norway's being invaded,\r\nwas most necessary in his own capital, and that the Muscovite\r\nambassador, M. Dolgorouky, had given quite other assurances) was held at\r\nHam and Horn, near Hamburgh, after his Danish Majesty had stayed there\r\nsix weeks for the Czar. In this conference it was, on the 3rd of June,\r\nagreed between both their Majesties, after several debates, that the\r\ndescent upon Schonen should positively be undertaken this year, and\r\neverything relating to the forwarding the same was entirely consented\r\nto. Hereupon his Danish Majesty made all haste for his return to his\r\ndominions, and gave orders to work day and night to get his fleet ready\r\nto put to sea. The transport ships were also gathered from all parts of\r\nhis dominions, both with inexpressible charges and great prejudice to\r\nhis subjects' trade. Thus, his Majesty (as the Czar himself upon his\r\narrival at Copenhagen owned) did his utmost to provide all necessaries,\r\nand to forward the descent, upon whose success everything depended. It\r\nhappened, however, in the meanwhile, and before the descent was agreed\r\nupon in the conference at Ham and Horn, that his Danish Majesty was\r\nobliged to secure his invaded and much oppressed kingdom of Norway, by\r\nsending thither a considerable squadron out of his fleet, under the\r\ncommand of Vice-Admiral Gabel, which squadron could not be recalled\r\nbefore the enemy had left that kingdom, without endangering a great part\r\nthereof; so that out of necessity the said Vice-Admiral was forced to\r\ntarry there till the 12th of July, when his Danish Majesty sent him\r\nexpress orders to return with all possible speed, wind and weather\r\npermitting; but this blowing for some time contrary, he was\r\ndetained.... The Swedes were all the while powerful at sea, and his\r\nCzarish Majesty himself did not think it advisable that the remainder of\r\nthe Danish, in conjunction with the men-of-war then at Copenhagen,\r\nshould go to convoy the Russian troops from Rostock, before the\r\nabove-mentioned squadron under Vice-Admiral Gabel was arrived. This\r\nhappening at last in the month of August, the confederate fleet put to\r\nsea; and the transporting of the said troops hither to Zealand was put\r\nin execution, though with a great deal of trouble and danger, but it\r\ntook up so much time that the descent could not be ready till September\r\nfollowing. Now, when all these preparations, as well for the descent as\r\nthe embarking the armies, were entirely ready, his Danish Majesty\r\nassured himself that the descent should be made within a few days, at\r\nfarthest by the 21st of September. The Russian Generals and Ministers\r\nfirst raised some difficulties to those of Denmark, and afterwards, on\r\nthe 17th September, declared in an appointed conference, that his\r\nCzarish Majesty, considering the present situation of affairs, was of\r\nopinion that neither forage nor provision could be had in Schonen, and\r\nthat consequently the descent was not advisable to be attempted this\r\nyear, but ought to be put off till next spring. It may easily be\r\nimagined how much his Danish Majesty was surprised at this; especially\r\nseeing the Czar, if he had altered his opinion, as to this design so\r\nsolemnly concerted, might have declared it sooner, and thereby saved his\r\nDanish Majesty several tons of gold, spent upon the necessary\r\npreparations. His Danish Majesty did, however, in a letter dated the\r\n20th of September, amply represent to the Czar, that although the season\r\nwas very much advanced, the descent might, nevertheless, easily be\r\nundertaken with such a superior force, as to get a footing in Schonen,\r\nwhere being assured there had been a very plentiful harvest, he did not\r\ndoubt but subsistence might be found; besides, that having an open\r\ncommunication with his own countries, it might easily be transported\r\nfrom thence. His Danish Majesty alleged also several weighty reasons why\r\nthe descent was either to be made this year, or the thoughts of making\r\nit next spring entirely be laid aside. _Nor did he alone make these\r\nmoving remonstrances to the Czar_; BUT HIS BRITISH MAJESTY'S MINISTER\r\nRESIDING HERE, AS WELL AS ADMIRAL NORRIS, _seconded the same also in a\r\nvery pressing manner_; AND BY EXPRESS ORDER OF THE KING, THEIR MASTER,\r\n_endeavoured to bring the Czar into their opinion, and to persuade him\r\nto go on with the descent_; but his Czarish Majesty declared by his\r\nanswer, that he would adhere to the resolution that he had once taken\r\nconcerning this delay of making the descent; but if his Danish Majesty\r\nwas resolved to venture on the descent, that he then, according to the\r\ntreaty made near Straelsund, would assist him only with the 15\r\nbattalions and 1,000 horse therein stipulated; that next spring he would\r\ncomply with everything else, and neither could or would declare himself\r\nfarther in this affair. Since then, his Danish Majesty could not,\r\nwithout running so great a hazard, undertake so great a work alone with\r\nhis own army and the said 15 battalions; he desired, in another letter\r\nof the 23rd September, his Czarish Majesty would be pleased to add 13\r\nbattalions of his troops, in which case his Danish Majesty would still\r\nthis year attempt the descent; but even this could not be obtained from\r\nhis Czarish Majesty, who absolutely refused it by his ambassador on the\r\n24th ditto: whereupon his Danish Majesty, in his letter of the 26th,\r\ndeclared to the Czar, that since things stood thus, he desired none of\r\nhis troops, but that they might be all speedily transported out of his\r\ndominions; that so the transport, whose freight stood him in 40,000 rix\r\ndollars per month, might be discharged, and his subjects eased of the\r\nintolerable contributions they now underwent. This he could not do less\r\nthan agree to; and accordingly, all the Russian troops are already\r\nembarked, and intend for certain to go from here with the first\r\nfavourable wind. It must be left to Providence and time, to discover\r\nwhat may have induced the Czar to a resolution so prejudicial to the\r\nNorthern Alliance, and most advantageous to the common enemy.\r\n\r\nIf we would take a true survey of men, and lay them open in a proper\r\nlight to the eye of our intellects, _we must_ first _consider their\r\nnatures_ and then _their ends_; and by this method of examination,\r\nthough their conduct is, seemingly, full of intricate mazes and\r\nperplexities, and winding round with infinite meanders of state-craft,\r\nwe shall be able to dive into the deepest recesses, make our way through\r\nthe most puzzling labyrinths, and at length come to the most abstruse\r\nmeans of bringing about the master secrets of their minds, and to\r\nunriddle their utmost mysteries.... The Czar ... is, by nature, of a\r\ngreat and enterprising spirit, and of a genius thoroughly politic; and\r\nas for his ends, the manner of his own Government, where he sways\r\narbitrary lord over the estates and honours of his people, must make\r\nhim, if all the policies in the world could by far-distant aims promise\r\nhim accession and accumulation of empire and wealth, be everlastingly\r\nlaying schemes for the achieving of both with the extremest cupidity and\r\nambition. Whatever ends an insatiate desire of opulency, and a boundless\r\nthirst for dominion, can ever put him upon, to satisfy their craving and\r\nvoracious appetites, those must, most undoubtedly, be his.\r\n\r\nThe next questions we are to put to ourselves are these three:\r\n\r\n1. By what means can he gain these ends?\r\n\r\n2. How far from him, and in what place, can these ends be best obtained?\r\n\r\n3. And by what time, using all proper methods and succeeding in them,\r\nmay he obtain these ends?\r\n\r\nThe possessions of the Czar were prodigious, vast in extent; the people\r\nall at his nod, all his downright arrant slaves, and all the wealth of\r\nthe country his own at a word's command. But then the country, though\r\nlarge in ground, was not quite so in produce. Every vassal had his gun,\r\nand was to be a soldier upon call; but there was never a soldier among\r\nthem, nor a man that understood the calling; and though he had all their\r\nwealth, they had no commerce of consequence, and little ready money; and\r\nconsequently his treasury, when he had amassed all he could, very bare\r\nand empty. He was then but in an indifferent condition to satisfy those\r\ntwo natural appetites, when he had neither wealth to support a\r\nsoldiery, nor a soldiery trained in the art of war. The first token this\r\nPrince gave of an aspiring genius, and of an ambition that is noble and\r\nnecessary in a monarch who has a mind to flourish, was to believe none\r\nof his subjects more wise than himself, or more fit to govern. He did\r\nso, and looked upon his own proper person as the most fit to travel out\r\namong the other realms of the world and study politics for the advancing\r\nof his dominions. He then seldom pretended to any warlike dispositions\r\nagainst those who were instructed in the science of arms; his military\r\ndealings lay mostly with the Turks and Tartars, who, as they had numbers\r\nas well as he, had them likewise composed, as well as his, of a rude,\r\nuncultivated mob, and they appeared in the field like a raw,\r\nundisciplined militia. In this his Christian neighbours liked him well,\r\ninsomuch as he was a kind of stay or stopgap to the infidels. But when\r\nhe came to look into the more polished parts of the Christian world, he\r\nset out towards it, from the very threshold, like a natural-born\r\npolitician. He was not for learning the game by trying chances and\r\nventuring losses in the field so soon; no, he went upon the maxim _that\r\nit was, at that time of day, expedient and necessary for him to carry,\r\nlike Samson, his strength in his head, and not in his arms_. He had\r\nthen, he knew, but very few commodious places for commerce of his own,\r\nand those all situated in the _White Sea_, too remote, frozen up the\r\nmost part of the year, and not at all fit for a fleet of men-of-war; but\r\nhe knew of many more commodious ones of his neighbours in the Baltic,\r\nand within his reach whenever he could strengthen his hands to lay hold\r\nof them. He had a longing eye towards them; but with prudence seemingly\r\nturned his head another way, and secretly entertained the pleasant\r\nthought that he should come at them all in good time. Not to give any\r\njealousy, he endeavours for no help from his neighbours to instruct his\r\nmen in arms. That was like asking a skilful person, one intended to\r\nfight a duel with, to teach him first how to fence. _He went over to\r\nGreat Britain_, where he knew that potent kingdom could, as yet, have no\r\njealousies of his growth of power, and in the eye of which his vast\r\nextent of nation lay neglected and unconsidered and overlooked, as I am\r\nafraid it is to this very day. He was present at all our exercises,\r\nlooked into all our laws, inspected our military, civil, and\r\necclesiastical regimen of affairs; yet this was the least he then\r\nwanted; this was the slightest part of his errand. But by degrees, when\r\nhe grew familiar with our people, he visited our docks, pretending not\r\nto have any prospect of profit, but only to take a huge delight (the\r\neffect of curiosity only) to see our manner of building ships. He kept\r\nhis court, as one may say, in our shipyard, so industrious was he in\r\naffording them his continual Czarish presence, and to his immortal glory\r\nfor art and industry be it spoken, that the great Czar, by stooping\r\noften to the employ, could handle an axe with the best artificer of them\r\nall; and the monarch having a good mathematical head of his own, grew in\r\nsome time a very expert royal shipwright. A ship or two for his\r\ndiversion made and sent him, and then two or three more, and after that\r\ntwo or three more, would signify just nothing at all, if they were\r\ngranted to be sold to him by the _Maritime Powers_, that could, at will,\r\nlord it over the sea. It would be a puny inconsiderable matter, and not\r\nworth the regarding. Well, but then, over and above this, he had\r\nartfully insinuated himself into the goodwill of many of our best\r\nworkmen, and won their hearts by his good-natured familiarities and\r\ncondescension among them. To turn this to his service, he offered many\r\nvery large premiums and advantages to go and settle in his country,\r\nwhich they gladly accepted of. A little after he sends over some private\r\nministers and officers to negotiate for more workmen, for land officers,\r\nand likewise for picked and chosen good seamen, who might be advanced\r\nand promoted to offices by going there. Nay, even to this day, any\r\nexpert seaman that is upon our traffic to the port of Archangel, if he\r\nhas the least spark of ambition and any ardent desire to be in office,\r\nhe need but offer himself to the sea-service of the Czar, and he is a\r\nlieutenant immediately. Over and above this, that Prince has even found\r\nthe way to take by force into his service out of our merchant ships as\r\nmany of their ablest seamen as he pleased, giving the masters the same\r\nnumber of raw Muscovites in their place, whom they afterwards were\r\nforced in their own defence to make fit for their own use. Neither is\r\nthis all; he had, during the last war, many hundreds of his subjects,\r\nboth noblemen and common sailors, on board _ours, the French and the\r\nDutch fleets_; and he has all along maintained, and still maintains\r\nnumbers of them in _ours and the Dutch yards_.\r\n\r\nBut seeing he looked all along upon all these endeavours towards\r\nimproving himself and his subjects as superfluous, whilst a seaport was\r\nwanting, where he might build a fleet of his own, and from whence he\r\nmight himself export the products of his country, and import those of\r\nothers; and finding the King of Sweden possessed of the most convenient\r\nones, I mean Narva and Revel, which he knew that Prince never could nor\r\nwould amicably part with, he at last resolved to wrest them out of his\r\nhands by force. His _Swedish_ Majesty's tender youth seemed the fittest\r\ntime for this enterprise, but even then he would not run the hazard\r\nalone. He drew in other princes to divide the spoil with him. And the\r\n_Kings of Denmark and Poland_ were weak enough to serve as instruments\r\nto forward the great and ambitious views of the Czar. It is true, he met\r\nwith a mighty hard rub at his very first setting out; his whole army\r\nbeing entirely defeated by a handful of Swedes at Narva. But it was his\r\ngood luck that his Swedish Majesty, instead of improving so great a\r\nvictory against him, turned immediately his arms against the King of\r\nPoland, against whom he was personally piqued, and that so much the\r\nmore, inasmuch as he had taken that Prince for one of his best friends,\r\nand was just upon the point of concluding with him the strictest\r\nalliance when he unexpectedly invaded the Swedish Livonia, and besieged\r\nRiga. This was, in all respects, what the Czar could most have wished\r\nfor; and foreseeing that the longer the war in Poland lasted, the more\r\ntime should he have both to retrieve his first loss, and to gain Narva,\r\nhe took care it should be spun out to as great a length as possible; for\r\nwhich end he never sent the King of Poland succour enough to make him\r\ntoo strong for the King of Sweden; who, on the other hand, though he\r\ngained one signal victory after the other, yet never could subdue his\r\nenemy as long as he received continual reinforcements from his\r\nhereditary country. And had not his Swedish Majesty, contrary to most\r\npeople's expectations, marched directly into Saxony itself, and thereby\r\nforced the King of Poland to peace, the Czar would have had leisure\r\nenough in all conscience to bring his designs to greater maturity. This\r\npeace was one of the greatest disappointments the Czar ever met with,\r\nwhereby he became singly engaged in the war. He had, however, the\r\ncomfort of having beforehand taken _Narva_, and laid a foundation to his\r\nfavourite town _Petersburg_, and to the seaport, the docks, and the vast\r\nmagazines there; all which works, to what perfection they are now\r\nbrought, let them tell who, with surprise, have seen them.\r\n\r\nHe (Peter) used all endeavours to bring matters to an accommodation. He\r\nproffered very advantageous conditions; _Petersburg_ only, a trifle as\r\nhe pretended, which he had set his heart upon, he would retain; and even\r\nfor that he was willing some other way to give satisfaction. But the\r\nKing of Sweden was too well acquainted with the importance of that place\r\nto leave it in the hands of an ambitious prince, and thereby to give him\r\nan inlet into the Baltic. This was the only time since the defeat at\r\nNarva that the Czar's arms had no other end than that of self-defence.\r\nThey might, perhaps, even have fallen short therein, had not the King of\r\nSweden (through whose persuasion is still a mystery), instead of\r\nmarching the shortest way to Novgorod and to Moscow, turned towards\r\nUkrain, where his army, after great losses and sufferings, was at last\r\nentirely defeated at Pultowa. As this was a fatal period to the Swedish\r\nsuccesses, so how great a deliverance it was to the Muscovites, may be\r\ngathered from the Czar's celebrating every year, with great solemnity,\r\nthe anniversary of that day, from which his ambitious thoughts began to\r\nsoar still higher. The whole of _Livonia_, _Estland_, and the best and\r\ngreatest part of _Finland_ was now what he demanded, after which,\r\nthough he might for the present condescend to give peace to the\r\nremaining part of Sweden, he knew he could easily even add that to his\r\nconquests whenever he pleased. The only obstacle he had to fear in these\r\nhis projects was from his northern neighbours; but as the _Maritime\r\nPowers_, and even the neighbouring princes in Germany, were then so\r\nintent upon their war against France, that they seemed entirely\r\nneglectful of that of the North, so there remained only Denmark and\r\nPoland to be jealous of. The former of these kingdoms had, ever since\r\nKing William, of glorious memory, compelled it to make peace with\r\nHolstein and, consequently, with Sweden, enjoyed an uninterrupted\r\ntranquillity, during which it had time, by a free trade and considerable\r\nsubsidies from the maritime powers to enrich itself, and was in a\r\ncondition, by joining itself to Sweden, as it was its interest to do, to\r\nstop the Czar's progresses, and timely to prevent its own danger from\r\nthem. The other, I mean Poland, was now quietly under the government of\r\nKing Stanislaus, who, owing in a manner his crown to the King of Sweden,\r\ncould not, out of gratitude, as well as real concern for the interest of\r\nhis country, fail opposing the designs of a too aspiring neighbour. The\r\nCzar was too cunning not to find out a remedy for all this: he\r\nrepresented to the King of Denmark how low the King of Sweden was now\r\nbrought, and how fair an opportunity he had, during that Prince's long\r\nabsence, to clip entirely his wings, and to aggrandize himself at his\r\nexpense. In King Augustus he raised the long-hid resentment for the loss\r\nof the Polish Crown, which he told him he might now recover without the\r\nleast difficulty. Thus both these Princes were immediately caught. The\r\nDanes declared war against Sweden without so much as a tolerable\r\npretence, and made a descent upon Schonen, where they were soundly\r\nbeaten for their pains. King Augustus re-entered Poland, where\r\neverything has ever since continued in the greatest disorder, and _that\r\nin a great measure owing to Muscovite intrigues_. It happened, indeed,\r\nthat these new confederates, whom the Czar had only drawn in to serve\r\nhis ambition, became at first more necessary to his preservation than\r\nhe had thought; for the Turks having declared a war against him, they\r\nhindered the Swedish arms from joining with them to attack him; but that\r\nstorm being soon over, through the Czar's wise behaviour and the avarice\r\nand folly of the Grand Vizier, he then made the intended use both of\r\nthese his friends, as well as of them he afterwards, through hopes of\r\ngain, persuaded into his alliance, which was to lay all the burthen and\r\nhazard of the war upon them, in order entirely to weaken them, together\r\nwith Sweden, whilst _he was preparing himself to swallow the one after\r\nthe other_. He has put them on one difficult attempt after the other;\r\ntheir armies have been considerably lessened by battles and long sieges,\r\nwhilst his own were either employed in easier conquests, and more\r\nprofitable to him, or kept at the vast expense of neutral princes--near\r\nenough at hand to come up to demand a share of the booty without having\r\nstruck a blow in getting it. His behaviour has been as cunning at sea,\r\nwhere his fleet has always kept out of harm's way and at a great\r\ndistance whenever there was any likelihood of an engagement between the\r\nDanes and the Swedes. He hoped that when these two nations had ruined\r\none another's fleets, his might then ride master in the Baltic. All this\r\nwhile he had taken care to make his men improve, by the example of\r\nforeigners and under their command, in the art of war.... His fleets\r\nwill soon considerably outnumber the Swedish and the Danish ones joined\r\ntogether. He need not fear their being a hindrance from his giving a\r\nfinishing stroke to this great and glorious undertaking. Which done,\r\n_let us look to ourselves; he will then most certainly become our rival,\r\nand as dangerous to us as he is now neglected_. We then may, perhaps,\r\nthough too late, call to mind what our own ministers and merchants have\r\ntold us of his designs of carrying on alone all the northern trade, and\r\nof getting all that from Turkey and Persia into his hands through the\r\nrivers which he is joining and making navigable from the Caspian, or the\r\nBlack Sea, to his Petersburg. _We shall then wonder at our blindness\r\nthat we did not suspect his designs_ when we heard the prodigious works\r\nhe has done at Petersburg and Revel; of which last place, the _Daily\r\nCourant_, dated November 23, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"HAGUE, _Nov. 17_.\r\n\r\n     \"The captains of the men-of-war of the States, who have been at\r\n     Revel, advise that the Czar has put that port and the\r\n     fortifications of the place into such a condition of defence that\r\n     it may pass for one of the most considerable fortresses, not only\r\n     of the Baltic, but even of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLeave we him now, as to his sea affairs, commerce and manufactures, and\r\nother works both of his policy and power, and let us view him in regard\r\nto his proceedings in this last campaign, especially as to that so much\r\ntalked of descent, he, in conjunction with his allies, was to make upon\r\nSchonen, and we shall find that even therein he has acted with his usual\r\ncunning. There is no doubt but the King of Denmark was the first that\r\nproposed this descent. He found that nothing but a speedy end to a war\r\nhe had so rashly and unjustly begun, could save his country from ruin\r\nand from the bold attempts of the King of Sweden, either against Norway,\r\nor against Zealand and Copenhagen. To treat separately with that prince\r\nwas a thing he could not do, as foreseeing that he would not part with\r\nan inch of ground to so unfair an enemy; and he was afraid that a\r\nCongress for a general place, supposing the King of Sweden would consent\r\nto it upon the terms proposed by his enemies, would draw the\r\nnegotiations out beyond what the situation of his affairs could bear. He\r\ninvites, therefore, all his confederates to make a home thrust at the\r\nKing of Sweden, by a descent into his country, where, having defeated\r\nhim, as by the superiority of the forces to be employed in that design\r\nhe hoped they should, they might force him to an immediate peace on such\r\nterms as they themselves pleased. I don't know how far the rest of his\r\nconfederates came into that project; but neither the _Prussian_ nor the\r\n_Hanoverian_ Court appeared _openly_ in that project, _and how far our\r\nEnglish fleet, under Sir John Norris, was to have forwarded it, I have\r\nnothing to say, but leave others to judge out of the King of Denmark's\r\nown declaration_: but the Czar came readily into it. He got thereby a\r\nnew pretence to carry the war one campaign more at other people's\r\nexpense; to march his troops into the Empire again, and to have them\r\nquartered and maintained, first in Mecklenburg and then in Zealand. In\r\nthe meantime he had his eyes upon _Wismar_, and upon a Swedish island\r\ncalled _Gotland_. If, by surprise, he could get the first out of the\r\nhands of his confederates, he then had a good seaport, whither to\r\ntransport his troops when he pleased into _Germany_, without asking the\r\nKing of _Prussia's_ leave for a free passage through his territories;\r\nand if, by a sudden descent, he could dislodge the _Swedes_ out of the\r\nother, he then became master of the best port in the Baltic. He\r\nmiscarried, however, in both these projects; for Wismar was too well\r\nguarded to be surprised; and he found his confederates would not give\r\nhim a helping hand towards conquering Gotland. After this he began to\r\nlook with another eye upon the descent to be made upon Schonen. He found\r\nit equally contrary to his interest, whether it succeeded or not. For if\r\nhe did, and the King was thereby forced to a general peace, he knew his\r\ninterests therein would be least regarded; having already notice enough\r\nof his confederates being ready to sacrifice them, provided they got\r\ntheir own terms. If he did not succeed, then, besides the loss of the\r\nflower of an army he had trained and disciplined with so much care, as\r\nhe very well foresaw that the English fleet would hinder the King of\r\nSweden from attempting anything against Denmark; so he justly feared the\r\nwhole shock would fall upon him, and he be thereby forced to surrender\r\nall he had taken from Sweden. These considerations made him entirely\r\nresolved not to make one of the descent; but he did not care to declare\r\nit till as late as possible: first, that he might the longer have his\r\ntroops maintained at the Danish expense; secondly, that it might be too\r\nlate for the King of Denmark to demand the necessary troops from his\r\nother confederates, and to make the descent without him; and, lastly,\r\nthat by putting the Dane to a vast expense in making necessary\r\npreparations, he might still weaken him more, and, therefore, make him\r\nnow the more dependent on him, and hereafter a more easy prey.\r\n\r\nThus he very carefully dissembles his real thoughts, till just when the\r\ndescent was to be made, and then he, all of a sudden, refuses joining\r\nit, and defers it till next spring, with this averment, _that he will\r\nthen be as good as his word_. But mark him, as some of our newspapers\r\ntell us, under this restriction, _unless he can get an advantageous\r\npeace of Sweden_. This passage, together with the common report we now\r\nhave of his treating a separate peace with the King of Sweden, is a new\r\ninstance of his cunning and policy. He has there two strings to his bow,\r\nof which one must serve his turn. There is no doubt but the Czar knows\r\nthat an accommodation between him and the King of Sweden must be very\r\ndifficult to bring about. For as he, on the one side, should never\r\nconsent to part with those seaports, for the getting of which he began\r\nthis war, and which are absolutely necessary towards carrying on his\r\ngreat and vast designs; so the King of Sweden would look upon it as\r\ndirectly contrary to his interest to yield up these same seaports, if\r\npossibly he could hinder it. But then again, the Czar is so well\r\nacquainted with the great and heroic spirit of his Swedish Majesty, that\r\nhe does not question his yielding, rather in point of interest than\r\nnicety of honour. From hence it is, he rightly judges, that his Swedish\r\nMajesty must be less exasperated against him who, though he began an\r\nunjust war, has very often paid dearly for it, and carried it on all\r\nalong through various successes than against some confederates; that\r\ntaking an opportunity of his Swedish Majesty's misfortunes, fell upon\r\nhim in an ungenerous manner, and made a partition treaty of his\r\nprovinces. The Czar, still more to accommodate himself to the genius of\r\nhis great enemy, unlike his confederates, who, upon all occasions,\r\nspared no reflections and even very unbecoming ones (bullying memorials\r\nand hectoring manifestoes), spoke all along with the utmost civility of\r\nhis brother Charles as he calls him, maintains him to be the greatest\r\ngeneral in Europe, and even publicly avers, he will more trust a word\r\nfrom him than the greatest assurances, oaths, nay, even treaties with\r\nhis confederates. These kind of civilities may, perhaps, make a deeper\r\nimpression upon the noble mind of the King of Sweden, and he be\r\npersuaded rather to sacrifice a real interest to a generous enemy, than\r\nto gratify, in things of less moment, those by whom he has been ill, and\r\neven inhumanly used. But if this should not succeed, the Czar is still a\r\ngainer by having made his confederates uneasy at these his separate\r\nnegotiations; and as we find by the newspapers, the more solicitous to\r\nkeep him ready to their confederacy, which must cost them very large\r\nproffers and promises. In the meantime he leaves the Dane and the Swede\r\nsecurely bound up together in war, and weakening one another as fast as\r\nthey can, and he turns towards the Empire and views the Protestant\r\nPrinces there; and, under many specious pretences, not only marches and\r\ncounter-marches about their several territories his troops that came\r\nback from Denmark, but makes also slowly advance towards Germany those\r\nwhom he has kept this great while in Poland, under pretence to help the\r\nKing against his dissatisfied subjects, whose commotions all the while\r\nhe was the greatest fomenter of. He considers the Emperor is in war with\r\nthe Turks, and therefore has found, by too successful experience, how\r\nlittle his Imperial Majesty is able to show his authority in protecting\r\nthe members of the Empire. His troops remain in Mecklenburg,\r\nnotwithstanding their departure is highly insisted upon. His replies to\r\nall the demands on that subject are filled with such reasons as if he\r\nwould give new laws to the Empire.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose that the King of Sweden should think it more\r\nhonourable to make a peace with the Czar, and to carry the force of his\r\nresentment against his less generous enemies, what a stand will then the\r\nprinces of the empire, even those that unadvisedly drew in 40,000\r\nMuscovites, to secure the tranquillity of that empire against 10,000 or\r\n12,000 Swedes,--I say what stand will they be able to make against him\r\nwhile the Emperor is already engaged in war with the Turks? and the\r\nPoles, when they are once in peace among themselves (if after the\r\nmiseries of so long a war they are in a condition to undertake anything)\r\nare by treaty obliged to join their aids against that common enemy of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nSome will say I make great and sudden rises from very small beginnings.\r\nMy answer is, that I would have such an objector look back and reflect\r\nwhy I show him, from such a speck of entity, at his first origin,\r\ngrowing, through more improbable and almost insuperable difficulties, to\r\nsuch a bulk as he has already attained to, and _whereby, as his\r\nadvocates, the Dutch themselves own, he is grown too formidable for the\r\nrepose, not only of his neighbours, but of Europe in general_.\r\n\r\nBut then, again, they will say he has no pretence either to make a peace\r\nwith the Swede separately from the Dane or to make war upon other\r\nprinces, some of whom he is bound in alliance with. Whoever thinks these\r\nobjections not answered must have considered the Czar neither as to his\r\nnature or to his ends. The Dutch own further, _that he made war against\r\nSweden without any specious pretence_. He that made war without any\r\nspecious pretence may make a peace without any specious pretence, and\r\nmake a new war without any specious pretence for it too. His Imperial\r\nMajesty (of Austria), like a wise Prince, when he was obliged to make\r\nwar with the Ottomans, made it, as in policy, he should, powerfully.\r\nBut, in the meantime, may not the Czar, who is a wise and potent Prince\r\ntoo, follow the example upon the neighbouring Princes round him that are\r\nProtestants? If he should, I tremble to speak it, it is not impossible,\r\nbut in this age of Christianity _the Protestant religion should, in a\r\ngreat measure, be abolished_; and that among the Christians, the\r\n_Greeks_ and _Romans_ may once more come to be the only Pretenders for\r\nUniversal Empire. The pure possibility carries with it warning enough\r\nfor the Maritime Powers, and all the other Protestant Princes, to\r\nmediate a peace for Sweden, and strengthen his arms again, without which\r\nno preparations can put them sufficiently upon their guard; and this\r\nmust be done early and betimes, _before the King of Sweden, either out\r\nof despair or revenge, throws himself into the Czar's hands_. For 'tis a\r\ncertain maxim (which all Princes ought, and the Czar seems at this time\r\nto observe too much for the repose of Christendom) that a wise man must\r\nnot stand for ceremony, and only _turn_ with opportunities. No, he must\r\neven _run_ with them. For the Czar's part, I will venture to say so much\r\nin his commendation, that he will hardly suffer himself to be overtaken\r\nthat way. He seems to act just as the tide serves. There is nothing\r\nwhich contributes more to the making our undertakings prosperous than\r\nthe taking of times and opportunities; for time carrieth with it the\r\nseasons of opportunities of business. If you let them slip, all your\r\ndesigns are rendered unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn short, things seem now come to that _crisis_ that peace should as\r\nsoon as possible be procured to the Swede, with such advantageous\r\narticles as are consistent with the nicety of his honour to accept, and\r\nwith the safety of the Protestant interest, that he should have offered\r\nto him, which can be scarce less than all the possessions which he\r\nformerly had in the Empire. As in all other things, so in politics, a\r\nlong-tried certainty must be preferred before an uncertainty, tho'\r\ngrounded on ever so probable suppositions. Now can there be anything\r\nmore certain, than that the provinces Sweden has had in the Empire, were\r\ngiven to it to make it the nearer at hand and the better able to secure\r\nthe Protestant interest, which, together with the liberties of the\r\nEmpire it just then had saved? Can there be anything more certain than\r\nthat that kingdom has, by those means, upon all occasions, secured that\r\nsaid interest now near fourscore years? Can there be anything more\r\ncertain than, as to his present Swedish Majesty, that I may use the\r\nwords of a letter her late Majesty, Queen Anne, wrote to him (Charles\r\nXII.), and _in the time of a Whig Ministry too_, viz.: \"That, as a true\r\nPrince, hero and Christian, the chief end of his endeavours has been the\r\npromotion of the fear of God among men: and that without insisting on\r\nhis own particular interest.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, is it not very uncertain whether those princes, who,\r\nby sharing among them the Swedish provinces in the Empire, are now going\r\nto set up as protectors of the Protestant interests there, exclusive of\r\nthe Swedes, will be able to do it? _Denmark_ is already so low, and will\r\nin all appearance be so much lower still before the end of the war,\r\nthat very little assistance can be expected from it in a great many\r\nyears. In _Saxony_, the prospect is but too dismal under a Popish\r\nprince, so that there remain only the two illustrious houses of Hanover\r\nand Brandenburg of all the Protestant princes, powerful enough to lead\r\nthe rest. Let us therefore only make a parallel between what now happens\r\nin the Duchy of Mecklenburg, and what may happen to the Protestant\r\ninterest, and we shall soon find how we may be mistaken in our\r\nreckoning. That said poor Duchy has been most miserably ruined by the\r\nMuscovite troops, and it is still so; the Electors of Brandenburg and\r\nHanover are obliged, both as directors of the circle of Lower Saxony, as\r\nneighbours, and Protestant Princes, to rescue a fellow state of the\r\nEmpire, and a Protestant country, from so cruel an oppression of a\r\nforeign Power. But, pray, what have they done? The Elector of\r\nBrandenburg, cautious lest the Muscovites might on one side invade his\r\nelectorate, and on the other side from Livonia and Poland, his kingdom\r\nof Prussia; and the Elector of Hanover having the same wise caution as\r\nto his hereditary countries, have not upon this, though very pressing\r\noccasion, thought it for their interest, to use any other means than\r\nrepresentations. But pray with what success? The Muscovites are still in\r\nMecklenburg, and if at last they march out of it, it will be when the\r\ncountry is so ruined that they cannot there subsist any longer.\r\n\r\nIt seems the King of Sweden should be restored to all that he has lost\r\non the side of the Czar; and this appears the _joint interest of both\r\nthe Maritime Powers_. This may they please to undertake: _Holland_,\r\nbecause it is a maxim there \"that the Czar grows too great, and must not\r\nbe suffered to settle in the Baltic, and that Sweden must not be\r\nabandoned\"; _Great Britain_, because, if the Czar compasses his vast and\r\nprodigious views, he will, by the ruin and conquest of Sweden, become\r\nour nearer and more dreadful neighbour. Besides, we are bound to it by a\r\ntreaty concluded in the year 1700, between King William and the present\r\nKing of Sweden, by virtue of which King William assisted the King of\r\nSweden, when in more powerful circumstances, with all that he desired,\r\nwith great sums of money, several hundred pieces of cloth, and\r\nconsiderable quantities of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nBut _some Politicians (whom nothing can make jealous of the growing\r\nstrength and abilities of the Czar) though they are even foxes and\r\nvulpones in the art, either will not see_ or _pretend they cannot see_\r\nhow the Czar can ever be able to make so great a progress in power as to\r\nhurt us here in our island. To them it is easy to repeat the same answer\r\na hundred times over, if they would be so kind as to take it at last,\r\nviz., _that what has been may be again_; and that they did not see how\r\nhe could reach the height of power, which he has already arrived at,\r\nafter, I must confess, a very incredible manner. Let those _incredulous_\r\npeople look narrowly into the _nature_ and the _ends_ and the _designs_\r\nof this great monarch; they will find that they are laid very deep, and\r\nthat his plans carry in them a prodigious deal of prudence and\r\nforesight, and his ends are at the long run brought about by a kind of\r\nmagic in policy; and will they not after that own that we ought to fear\r\neverything from him? As he desires that the designs with which he\r\nlabours may not prove abortive, so he does not assign them a certain day\r\nof their birth, but leaves them to the natural productions of fit times\r\nand occasions, like those curious artists in China, who temper the mould\r\nthis day of which a vessel may be made a hundred years hence.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of short-sighted politicians among us, who have\r\nmore of cunning court intrigue and immediate statecraft in them than of\r\ntrue policy and concern for their country's interest. These gentlemen\r\npin entirely their faith upon other people's sleeves; ask as to\r\neverything that is proposed to them, how it is liked at Court? what the\r\nopinion of their party is concerning it? and if the contrary party is\r\nfor or against it? Hereby they rule their judgment, and it is enough for\r\ntheir cunning leaders to brand anything with _Whiggism_ or _Jacobitism_,\r\nfor to make these people, without any further inquiry into the matter,\r\nblindly espouse it or oppose it. This, it seems, is at present the case\r\nof the subject we are upon. Anything said or written in favour of\r\nSweden and the King thereof, is immediately said to come from a\r\n_Jacobite_ pen, and thus reviled and rejected, without being read or\r\nconsidered. Nay, I have heard gentlemen go so far as to maintain\r\npublicly, and with all the vehemence in the world, that the King of\r\nSweden was a Roman Catholic, and that the Czar was a good Protestant.\r\nThis, indeed, is one of the greatest misfortunes our country labours\r\nunder, and till we begin to see with our own eyes, and inquire ourselves\r\ninto the truth of things, we shall be led away, God knows whither, at\r\nlast. The serving of Sweden according to our treaties and real interest\r\nhas nothing to do with our party causes. Instead of seeking for and\r\ntaking hold of any pretence to undo Sweden, we ought openly to assist\r\nit. Could our Protestant succession have a better friend or a bolder\r\nchampion?\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this by thus shortly recapitulating what I have said.\r\nThat since the Czar has not only replied to the King of Denmark\r\nentreating the contrary, but also answered our Admiral Norris, that he\r\nwould persist in his resolution to delay the descent upon Schonen, and\r\nis said by other newspapers to resolve not to make it then, if he can\r\nhave peace with Sweden; every Prince, and we more particularly, ought to\r\nbe jealous of his having some such design as I mention in view, and\r\nconsult how to prevent them, and to clip, in time, his too aspiring\r\nwings, which cannot be effectually done, first, without the Maritime\r\nPowers please to begin to keep him in some check and awe, and 'tis to be\r\nhoped a certain potent nation, that has helped him forward, can, in some\r\nmeasure, bring him back, and may then speak to this great enterpriser in\r\nthe language of a countryman in Spain, who coming to an image enshrined,\r\nthe first making whereof he could well remember, and not finding all the\r\nrespectful usage he expected,--\"You need not,\" quoth he, \"be so proud,\r\nfor we have known you from a plum-tree.\" The next only way is to\r\nrestore, by a peace, to the King of Sweden what he has lost; that checks\r\nhis (the Czar's) power immediately, and on that side nothing else can. I\r\nwish it may not at last be found true, that those who have been\r\nfighting against that King have, in the main, been fighting against\r\nthemselves. If the Swede ever has his dominions again, and lowers the\r\nhigh spirit of the Czar, still he may say by his neighbours, as an old\r\nGreek hero did, whom his countrymen constantly sent into exile whenever\r\nhe had done them a service, but were forced to call him back to their\r\naid, whenever they wanted success. \"These people,\" quoth he, \"are always\r\nusing me like the palm-tree. They will be breaking my branches\r\ncontinually, and yet, if there comes a storm, they run to me, and can't\r\nfind a better place for shelter.\" But if he has them not, I shall only\r\nexclaim a phrase out of Terence's \"Andria\":\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Hoccine credibile est aut memorabile\r\n     Tanta vecordia innata cuiquam ut siet,\r\n     Ut malis gaudeant?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4. POSTSCRIPT.--I flatter myself that this little history is of that\r\ncurious nature, and on matters hitherto so unobserved, that I consider\r\nit, with pride, as a valuable New Year's gift to the present world; and\r\nthat posterity will accept it, as the like, for many years after, and\r\nread it over on that anniversary, and call it their _Warning Piece_. I\r\nmust have my _Exegi-Monumentum_ as well as others.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[20] Or, to follow this affectation of silliness into more recent times,\r\nis there anything in diplomatic history that could match Lord\r\nPalmerston's proposal made to Marshal Soult (in 1839), to storm the\r\nDardanelles, in order to afford the Sultan the support of the\r\nAnglo-French fleet against Russia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand a limited historical epoch, we must step beyond its\r\nlimits, and compare it with other historical epochs. To judge\r\nGovernments and their acts, we must measure them by their own times and\r\nthe conscience of their contemporaries. Nobody will condemn a British\r\nstatesman of the 17th century for acting on a belief in witchcraft, if\r\nhe find Bacon himself ranging demonology in the catalogue of science. On\r\nthe other hand, if the Stanhopes, the Walpoles, the Townshends, etc.,\r\nwere suspected, opposed, and denounced in their own country by their own\r\ncontemporaries as tools or accomplices of Russia, it will no longer do\r\nto shelter their policy behind the convenient screen of prejudice and\r\nignorance common to their time. At the head of the historical evidence\r\nwe have to sift, we place, therefore, long-forgotten English pamphlets\r\nprinted at the very time of Peter I. These preliminary _pièces des\r\nprocès_ we shall, however, limit to three pamphlets, which, from three\r\ndifferent points of view, illustrate the conduct of England towards\r\nSweden. The first, the _Northern Crisis_ (given in Chapter II.),\r\nrevealing the general system of Russia, and the dangers accruing to\r\nEngland from the Russification of Sweden; the second, called _The\r\nDefensive Treaty_, judging the acts of England by the Treaty of 1700;\r\nand the third, entitled _Truth is but Truth, however it is Timed_,\r\nproving that the new-fangled schemes which magnified Russia into the\r\nparamount Power of the Baltic were in flagrant opposition to the\r\ntraditionary policy England had pursued during the course of a whole\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet called _The Defensive Treaty_ bears no date of publication.\r\nYet in one passage it states that, for reinforcing the Danish fleet,\r\neight English men-of-war were left at Copenhagen \"_the year before the\r\nlast_,\" and in another passage alludes to the assembling of the\r\nconfederate fleet for the Schonen expedition as having occurred \"_last\r\nsummer_.\" As the former event took place in 1715, and the latter towards\r\nthe end of the summer of 1716, it is evident that the pamphlet was\r\nwritten and published in the earlier part of the year 1717. The\r\nDefensive Treaty between England and Sweden, the single articles of\r\nwhich the pamphlet comments upon in the form of queries, was concluded\r\nin 1700 between William III. and Charles XII., and was not to expire\r\nbefore 1719. Yet, during almost the whole of this period, we find\r\nEngland continually assisting Russia and waging war against Sweden,\r\neither by secret intrigue or open force, although the treaty was never\r\nrescinded nor war ever declared. This fact is, perhaps, even less\r\nstrange than the _conspiration de silence_ under which modern historians\r\nhave succeeded in burying it, and among them historians by no means\r\nsparing of censure against the British Government of that time, for\r\nhaving, without any previous declaration of war, destroyed the Spanish\r\nfleet in the Sicilian waters. But then, at least, England was not bound\r\nto Spain by a defensive treaty. How, then, are we to explain this\r\ncontrary treatment of similar cases? The piracy committed against Spain\r\nwas one of the weapons which the Whig Ministers, seceding from the\r\nCabinet in 1717, caught hold of to harass their remaining colleagues.\r\nWhen the latter stepped forward in 1718, and urged Parliament to declare\r\nwar against Spain, Sir Robert Walpole rose from his seat in the Commons,\r\nand in a most virulent speech denounced the late ministerial acts \"as\r\ncontrary to the laws of nations, and a breach of solemn treaties.\"\r\n\"Giving sanction to them in the manner proposed,\" he said, \"could have\r\nno other view than to screen ministers, who were conscious of having\r\ndone something amiss, and who, having begun a war against Spain, would\r\nnow make it the Parliament's war.\" The treachery against Sweden and the\r\nconnivance at the plans of Russia, never happening to afford the\r\nostensible pretext for a family quarrel amongst the Whig rulers (they\r\nbeing rather unanimous on these points), never obtained the honours of\r\nhistorical criticism so lavishly spent upon the Spanish incident.\r\n\r\nHow apt modern historians generally are to receive their cue from the\r\nofficial tricksters themselves, is best shown by their reflections on\r\nthe commercial interests of England with respect to Russia and Sweden.\r\nNothing has been more exaggerated than the dimensions of the trade\r\nopened to Great Britain by the huge market of the Russia of Peter the\r\nGreat, and his immediate successors. Statements bearing not the\r\nslightest touch of criticism have been allowed to creep from one\r\nbook-shelf to another, till they became at last historical household\r\nfurniture, to be inherited by every successive historian, without even\r\nthe _beneficium inventarii_. Some incontrovertible statistical figures\r\nwill suffice to blot out these hoary common-places.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BRITISH COMMERCE FROM 1697-1700.\r\n\r\n                                          £\r\n     Export to Russia                   58,884\r\n     Import from Russia                112,252\r\n                                     ---------\r\n                  Total                171,136\r\n\r\n     Export to Sweden                   57,555\r\n     Import from Sweden                212,094\r\n                                     ---------\r\n                  Total                269,649\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the total\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         £\r\n     Export of England amounted to   3,525,906\r\n     Import                          3,482,586\r\n                                     ---------\r\n                  Total              7,008,492\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1716, after all the Swedish provinces in the Baltic, and on the Gulfs\r\nof Finland and Bothnia, had fallen into the hands of Peter I., the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 £\r\n     Export to Russia was     113,154\r\n     Import from Russia       197,270\r\n                             --------\r\n                  Total       310,424\r\n\r\n     Export to Sweden          24,101\r\n     Import from Sweden       136,959\r\n                             --------\r\n                  Total       161,060\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the total of English exports and imports together\r\nreached about £10,000,000. It will be seen from these figures, when\r\ncompared with those of 1697-1700, that the increase in the Russian trade\r\nis balanced by the decrease in the Swedish trade, and that what was\r\nadded to the one was subtracted from the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1730, the\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     £\r\n     Export to Russia was          46,275\r\n     Import from Russia           258,802\r\n                                 --------\r\n                  Total           305,077\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen years, then, after the consolidation in the meanwhile of the\r\nMuscovite settlement on the Baltic, the British trade with Russia had\r\nfallen off by £5,347. The general trade of England reaching in 1730 the\r\nsum of £16,329,001, the Russian trade amounted not yet to 1/53rd of its\r\ntotal value. Again, thirty years later, in 1760, the account between\r\nGreat Britain and Russia stands thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         £\r\n     Import from Russia (in 1760)     536,504\r\n     Export to Russia                  39,761\r\n                                     --------\r\n                  Total              £576,265\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile the general trade of England amounted to £26,361,760. Comparing\r\nthese figures with those of 1706, we find that the total of the Russian\r\ncommerce, after nearly half a century, has increased by the trifling sum\r\nof only £265,841. That England suffered positive loss by her new\r\ncommercial relations with Russia under Peter I. and Catherine I.\r\nbecomes evident on comparing, on the one side, the export and import\r\nfigures, and on the other, the sums expended on the frequent naval\r\nexpeditions to the Baltic which England undertook during the lifetime of\r\nCharles XII., in order to break down his resistance to Russia, and,\r\nafter his death, on the professed necessity of checking the maritime\r\nencroachments of Russia.\r\n\r\nAnother glance at the statistical data given for the years 1697, 1700,\r\n1716, 1730, and 1760, will show that the British _export_ trade to\r\nRussia was continually falling off, save in 1716, when Russia engrossed\r\nthe whole Swedish trade on the eastern coast of the Baltic and the Gulf\r\nof Bothnia, and had not yet found the opportunity of subjecting it to\r\nher own regulations. From £58,884, at which the British exports to\r\nRussia stood during 1697-1700, when Russia was still precluded from the\r\nBaltic, they had sunk to £46,275 in 1730, and to £39,761 in 1760,\r\nshowing a decrease of £19,123, or about 1/3rd of their original amount\r\nin 1700. If, then, since, the absorption of the Swedish provinces by\r\nRussia, the British market proved expanding for Russia raw produce, the\r\nRussian market, on its side, proved straitening for British\r\nmanufacturers, a feature of that trade which could hardly recommend it\r\nat a time when the Balance of Trade doctrine ruled supreme. To trace the\r\ncircumstances which produced the increase of the Anglo-Russian trade\r\nunder Catherine II. would lead us too far from the period we are\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we arrive at the following conclusions: During the\r\nfirst sixty years of the eighteenth century the total Anglo-Russian\r\ntrade formed but a very diminutive fraction of the general trade of\r\nEngland, say less than 1/45th. Its sudden increase during the earliest\r\nyears of Peter's sway over the Baltic did not at all affect the general\r\nbalance of British trade, as it was a simple transfer from its Swedish\r\naccount to its Russian account. In the later times of Peter I., as well\r\nas under his immediate successors, Catherine I. and Anne, the\r\nAnglo-Russian trade was positively declining; during the whole epoch,\r\ndating from the final settlement of Russia in the Baltic provinces, the\r\nexport of British manufactures to Russia was continually falling off, so\r\nthat at its end it stood one-third lower than at its beginning, when\r\nthat trade was still confined to the port of Archangel. Neither the\r\ncontemporaries of Peter I., nor the next British generation reaped any\r\nbenefit from the advancement of Russia to the Baltic. In general the\r\nBaltic trade of Great Britain was at that time trifling in regard of the\r\ncapital involved, but important in regard of its character. It afforded\r\nEngland the raw produce for its maritime stores. That from the latter\r\npoint of view the Baltic was in safer keeping in the hands of Sweden\r\nthan in those of Russia, was not only proved by the pamphlets we are\r\nreprinting, but fully understood by the British Ministers themselves.\r\nStanhope writing, for instance, to Townshend on October 16th, 1716:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"It is certain that if the Czar be let alone three years, he will\r\n     be absolute master in those seas.\"[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, then, neither the navigation nor the general commerce of England was\r\ninterested in the treacherous support given to Russia against Sweden,\r\nthere existed, indeed, one small fraction of British merchants whose\r\ninterests were identical with the Russian ones--the Russian Trade\r\nCompany. It was this gentry that raised a cry against Sweden. See, for\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Several grievances of the English merchants in their trade into\r\n     the dominions of the King of Sweden, whereby it does appear how\r\n     dangerous it may be for the English nation to depend on Sweden only\r\n     for the supply of the naval stores, when they might be amply\r\n     furnished with the like stores from the dominions of the Emperor of\r\n     Russia.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The case of the merchants trading to Russia\" (a petition to\r\n     Parliament), etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was they who in the years 1714, 1715, and 1716, regularly assembled\r\ntwice a week before the opening of Parliament, to draw up in public\r\nmeetings the complaints of the British merchantmen against Sweden. On\r\nthis small fraction the Ministers relied; they were even busy in getting\r\nup its demonstrations, as may be seen from the letters addressed by\r\nCount Gyllenborg to Baron Görtz, dated 4th of November and 4th of\r\nDecember, 1716, wanting, as they did, but the shadow of a pretext to\r\ndrive their \"mercenary Parliament,\" as Gyllenborg calls it, where they\r\nliked. The influence of these British merchants trading to Russia was\r\nagain exhibited in the year 1765, and our own times have witnessed the\r\nworking for his interest, of a Russian merchant at the head of the Board\r\nof Trade, and of a Chancellor of the Exchequer in the interest of a\r\ncousin engaged in the Archangel trade.\r\n\r\nThe oligarchy which, after the \"glorious revolution,\" usurped wealth and\r\npower at the cost of the mass of the British people, was, of course,\r\nforced to look out for allies, not only abroad, but also at home. The\r\nlatter they found in what the French would call _la haute bourgeoisie_,\r\nas represented by the Bank of England, the money-lenders, State\r\ncreditors, East India and other trading corporations, the great\r\nmanufacturers, etc. How tenderly they managed the material interests of\r\nthat class may be learned from the whole of their domestic\r\nlegislation--Bank Acts, Protectionist enactments, Poor Regulations, etc.\r\nAs to their _foreign policy_, they wanted to give it the appearance at\r\nleast of being altogether regulated by the mercantile interest, an\r\nappearance the more easily to be produced, as the exclusive interest of\r\none or the other small fraction of that class would, of course, be\r\nalways identified with this or that Ministerial measure. The interested\r\nfraction then raised the commerce and navigation cry, which the nation\r\nstupidly re-echoed.\r\n\r\nAt that time, then, there devolved on the Cabinet, at least, the _onus_\r\nof inventing _mercantile pretexts_, however futile, for their measures\r\nof foreign policy. In our own epoch, British Ministers have thrown this\r\nburden on foreign nations, leaving to the French, the Germans, etc.,\r\nthe irksome task of discovering the _secret_ and _hidden_ mercantile\r\nsprings of their actions. Lord Palmerston, for instance, takes a step\r\napparently the most damaging to the material interests of Great Britain.\r\nUp starts a State philosopher, on the other side of the Atlantic, or of\r\nthe Channel, or in the heart of Germany, who puts his head to the rack\r\nto dig out the mysteries of the mercantile Machiavelism of \"perfide\r\nAlbion,\" of which Palmerston is supposed the unscrupulous and\r\nunflinching executor. We will, _en passant_, show, by a few modern\r\ninstances, what desperate shifts those foreigners have been driven to,\r\nwho feel themselves obliged to interpret Palmerston's acts by what they\r\nimagine to be the English commercial policy. In his valuable _Histoire\r\nPolitique et Sociale des Principautés Danubiennes_, M. Elias Regnault,\r\nstartled by the Russian conduct, before and during the years 1848-49 of\r\nMr. Colquhoun, the British Consul at Bucharest, suspects that England\r\nhas some secret material interest in keeping down the trade of the\r\nPrincipalities. The late Dr. Cunibert, private physician of old Milosh,\r\nin his most interesting account of the Russian intrigues in Servia,\r\ngives a curious relation of the manner in which Lord Palmerston, through\r\nthe instrumentality of Colonel Hodges, betrayed Milosh to Russia by\r\nfeigning to support him against her. Fully believing in the personal\r\nintegrity of Hodges, and the patriotic zeal of Palmerston, Dr. Cunibert\r\nis found to go a step further than M. Elias Regnault. He suspects\r\nEngland of being interested in putting down Turkish commerce generally.\r\nGeneral Mieroslawski, in his last work on Poland, is not very far from\r\nintimating that mercantile Machiavelism instigated England to sacrifice\r\nher own _prestige_ in Asia Minor, by the surrender of Kars. As a last\r\ninstance may serve the present lucubrations of the Paris papers, hunting\r\nafter the secret springs of commercial jealousy, which induce Palmerston\r\nto oppose the cutting of the Isthmus of Suez canal.\r\n\r\nTo return to our subject. The mercantile pretext hit upon by the\r\nTownshends, Stanhopes, etc., for the hostile demonstrations against\r\nSweden, was the following. Towards the end of 1713, Peter I. had\r\nordered all the hemp and other produce of his dominions, destined for\r\nexport, to be carried to St. Petersburg instead of Archangel. Then the\r\nSwedish Regency, during the absence of Charles XII., and Charles XII.\r\nhimself, after his return from Bender, declared all the Baltic ports,\r\noccupied by the Russians, to be blockaded. Consequently, English ships,\r\nbreaking through the blockade, were confiscated. The English Ministry\r\nthen asserted that British merchantmen had the right of trading to those\r\nports according to Article XVII. of the Defensive Treaty of 1700, by\r\nwhich English commerce, with the exception of contraband of war, was\r\nallowed to go on with ports of the enemy. The absurdity and falsehood of\r\nthis pretext being fully exposed in the pamphlet we are about to\r\nreprint, we will only remark that the case had been more than once\r\ndecided against commercial nations, not bound, like England, by treaty\r\nto defend the integrity of the Swedish Empire. In the year 1561, when\r\nthe Russians took Narva, and laboured hard to establish their commerce\r\nthere, the Hanse towns, chiefly Lübeck, tried to possess themselves of\r\nthis traffic. Eric XIV., then King of Sweden, resisted their\r\npretensions. The city of Lübeck represented this resistance as\r\naltogether new, as they had carried on their commerce with the Russians\r\ntime out of mind, and pleaded the common right of nations to navigate in\r\nthe Baltic, provided their vessels carried no contraband of war. The\r\nKing replied that he did not dispute the Hanse towns the liberty of\r\ntrading with Russia, but only with Narva, which was no Russian port. In\r\nthe year 1579 again, the Russians having broken the suspension of arms\r\nwith Sweden, the Danes likewise claimed the navigation to Narva, by\r\nvirtue of their treaty, but King John was as firm in maintaining the\r\ncontrary, as was his brother Eric.\r\n\r\nIn her open demonstrations of hostility against the King of Sweden, as\r\nwell as in the false pretence on which they were founded, England seemed\r\nonly to follow in the track of Holland, which declaring the confiscation\r\nof its ships to be piracy, had issued two proclamations against Sweden\r\nin 1714.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, the case of the States-General was the same as that of\r\nEngland. King William had concluded the Defensive Treaty as well for\r\nHolland as for England. Besides, Article XVI., in the Treaty of\r\nCommerce, concluded between Holland and Sweden in 1703, expressly\r\nstipulated that no navigation ought to be allowed to the ports blocked\r\nup by either of the confederates. The then common Dutch cant that \"there\r\nwas no hindering traders from carrying their merchandise where they\r\nwill,\" was the more impudent as, during the war, ending with the Peace\r\nof Ryswick, the Dutch Republic had declared all France to be blocked up,\r\nforbidden the neutral Powers all trade with that kingdom, and caused all\r\ntheir ships that went there or came thence to be brought up without any\r\nregard to the nature of their cargoes.\r\n\r\nIn another respect, the situation of Holland was different from that of\r\nEngland. Fallen from its commercial and maritime grandeur, Holland had\r\nthen already entered upon its epoch of decline. Like Genoa and Venice,\r\nwhen new roads of commerce had dispossessed them of their old mercantile\r\nsupremacy, it was forced to lend out to other nations its capital, grown\r\ntoo large for the vessels of its own commerce. Its fatherland had begun\r\nto lie there where the best interest for its capital was paid. Russia,\r\ntherefore, proved an immense market, less for the commerce than for the\r\noutlay of capital and men. To this moment Holland has remained the\r\nbanker of Russia. At the time of Peter they supplied Russia with ships,\r\nofficers, arms, and money, so that his fleet, as a contemporary writer\r\nremarks, ought to have been called a Dutch rather than a Muscovite one.\r\nThey gloried in having sent the first European merchant ship to St.\r\nPetersburg, and returned the commercial privileges they had obtained\r\nfrom Peter, or hoped to obtain from him, by that fawning meanness which\r\ncharacterizes their intercourse with Japan. Here, then, was quite\r\nanother solid foundation than in England for the Russianism of\r\nstatesmen, whom Peter I. had entrapped during his stay at Amsterdam, and\r\nthe Hague in 1697, whom he afterwards directed by his ambassadors, and\r\nwith whom he renewed his personal influence during his renewed stay at\r\nAmsterdam in 1716-17. Yet, if the paramount influence England exercised\r\nover Holland during the first _decennia_ of the 18th century be\r\nconsidered, there can remain no doubt that the proclamations against\r\nSweden by the States-General would never have been issued, if not with\r\nthe previous consent and at the instigation of England. The intimate\r\nconnection between the English and Dutch Governments served more than\r\nonce the former to put up precedents in the name of Holland, which they\r\nwere resolved to act upon in the name of England. On the other hand, it\r\nis no less certain that the Dutch statesmen were employed by the Czar to\r\ninfluence the British ones. Thus Horace Walpole, the brother of the\r\n\"Father of Corruption,\" the brother-in-law of the Minister, Townshend,\r\nand the British Ambassador at the Hague during 1715-16, was evidently\r\ninveigled into the Russian interest by his Dutch friends. Thus, as we\r\nshall see by-and-by, Theyls, the Secretary to the Dutch Embassy at\r\nConstantinople, at the most critical period of the deadly struggle\r\nbetween Charles XII. and Peter I., managed affairs at the same time for\r\nthe Embassies of England and Holland at the Sublime Porte. This Theylls,\r\nin a print of his, openly claims it as a merit with his nation to have\r\nbeen the devoted and rewarded agent of Russian intrigue.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[21] In the year 1657, when the Courts of Denmark and Brandenburg\r\nintended engaging the Muscovites to fall upon Sweden, they instructed\r\ntheir Minister so to manage the affair that the Czar might by no means\r\nget any footing in the Baltic, because \"they did not know what to do\r\nwith so troublesome a neighbour.\" (See Puffendorf's _History of\r\nBrandenburg_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_The Defensive Treaty concluded in the year 1700, between his late\r\n     Majesty, King William, of ever-glorious memory, and his present\r\n     Swedish Majesty, King Charles XII.

If this is not justifiable, as even\r\ncommon sense tells us it is not, how can the reason stand good, which we\r\nallege amongst others, for using the King of Sweden as we do, _id est_,\r\nthat demanding a literal performance of his alliance with us, _he would\r\nnot accept the treaty of neutrality for his German provinces_, which we\r\nproposed to him some years ago, a treaty which, not to mention its\r\npartiality in favour of the enemies of Sweden, and that it was\r\ncalculated only for our own interest, and for to prevent all disturbance\r\nin the empire, whilst we were engaged in a war against France, the King\r\nof Sweden had so much less reason to rely upon, as he was to conclude it\r\nwith those very enemies, that had every one of them broken several\r\ntreaties in beginning the present war against him, and as it was to be\r\nguaranteed by those powers, who were also every one of them guarantees\r\nof the broken treaties, without having performed their guarantee?\r\n\r\n\"_Query III._ How can we make the words in the 7th Article, _that in\r\nassisting our injured Ally we shall not desist before he shall be\r\nsatisfied in all things_, agree with our endeavouring, to the contrary,\r\nto help the enemies of that Prince, though all unjust aggressors, not\r\nonly to take one province after the other from him, but also to remain\r\nundisturbed possessors thereof, blaming all along the King of Sweden for\r\nnot tamely submitting thereunto?\r\n\r\n\"_Query IV._ The treaty concluded in the year 1661, between Great\r\nBritain and Sweden, being in the 11th Article confirmed, and the said\r\ntreaty forbidding expressly one of the confederates _either himself or\r\nhis subjects to lend or to sell to the other's enemies, men-of-war or\r\nships of defence_; the 13th Article of this present treaty forbidding\r\nalso expressly the subjects of either of the Allies _to help anyways the\r\nenemies of the other, to the inconvenience and loss of such an Ally_;\r\nshould we not have accused the Swedes of the most notorious breach of\r\nthis treaty, had they, during our late war with the French, lent them\r\ntheir own fleet, the better to execute any design of theirs against us,\r\nor had they, notwithstanding our representations to the contrary,\r\nsuffered their subjects to furnish the French with ships of 50, 60, and\r\n70 guns! Now, if we turn the tables, and remember upon how many\r\noccasions our fleet has of late been entirely subservient to the designs\r\nof the enemies of Sweden, even in most critical times, and that _the\r\nCzar of Muscovy has actually above a dozen English-built ships_ in his\r\nfleet, will it not be very difficult for us to excuse in ourselves what\r\nwe should most certainly have blamed, if done by others?\r\n\r\n\"_Article XVII._ The obligation shall not be so far extended as that all\r\nfriendship and mutual commerce with the enemies of that Ally (that\r\nrequires the help) shall be taken away; for supposing that one of the\r\nconfederates should send his auxiliaries, and should not be engaged in\r\nthe war himself, it shall then be lawful for the subjects to trade and\r\ncommerce with that enemy of that Ally that is engaged in the war, also\r\ndirectly and safely to merchandise with such enemies, for all goods not\r\nexpressly forbid and called contraband, as in a special treaty of\r\ncommerce hereafter shall be appointed.\r\n\r\n\"_Query I._ This Article being the only one out of twenty-two whose\r\nperformance we have now occasion to insist upon from the Swedes, the\r\nquestion will be whether we ourselves, in regard to Sweden, have\r\nperformed all the other articles as it was our part to do, and whether\r\nin demanding of the King of Sweden the executing of this Article, we\r\nhave promised that we would also do our duty as to all the rest; if not,\r\nmay not the Swedes say that we complain unjustly of the breach of one\r\nsingle Article, when we ourselves may perhaps be found guilty of having\r\nin the most material points either not executed or even acted against\r\nthe whole treaty?\r\n\r\n\"_Query II._ Whether the liberty of commerce one Ally is, by virtue of\r\nthis Article, to enjoy with the other's enemies, ought to have no\r\nlimitation at all, neither as to time nor place; in short, whether it\r\nought even to be extended so far as to destroy the very end of this\r\nTreaty, which is the promoting the safety and security of one another's\r\nkingdoms?\r\n\r\n\"_Query III._ Whether in case the French had in the late wars made\r\nthemselves masters of Ireland or Scotland, and either in new-made\r\nseaports, or the old ones, endeavoured by trade still more firmly to\r\nestablish themselves in their new conquest, we, in such a case, should\r\nhave thought the Swedes our true allies and friends, had they insisted\r\nupon this Article to trade with the French in the said seaports taken\r\nfrom us, and to furnish them there with several necessaries of war, nay,\r\neven with armed ships, whereby the French might the easier have annoyed\r\nus here in England?\r\n\r\n\"_Query IV._ Whether, if we had gone about to hinder a trade so\r\nprejudicial to us, and in order thereunto brought up all Swedish ships\r\ngoing to the said seaports, we should not highly have exclaimed against\r\nthe Swedes, had they taken from thence a pretence to join their fleet\r\nwith the French, to occasion the losing of any of our dominions, and\r\neven to encourage the invasion upon us, have their fleet at hand to\r\npromote the same?\r\n\r\n\"_Query V._ Whether upon an impartial examination this would not have\r\nbeen a case exactly parallel to that we insist upon, as to a free Trade\r\nto the seaports the Czar has taken from Sweden, and to our present\r\nbehaviour, upon the King of Sweden's hindering the same?\r\n\r\n\"_Query VI._ Whether we have not ever since Oliver Cromwell's time till\r\n1710, in all our wars with France and Holland, without any urgent\r\nnecessity at all, brought up and confiscated Swedish ships, though not\r\ngoing to any prohibited ports, and that to a far greater number and\r\nvalue, than all those the Swedes have now taken from us, and whether the\r\nSwedes have ever taken a pretence from thence to join with our enemies,\r\nand to send whole squadrons of ships to their assistance?\r\n\r\n\"_Query VII._ Whether, if we inquire narrowly into the state of\r\ncommerce, as it has been carried on for these many years, we shall not\r\nfind that the trade of the above-mentioned places was not so very\r\nnecessary to us, at least not so far as to be put into the balance with\r\nthe preservation of a Protestant confederate nation, much less to give\r\nus a just reason _to make war against that nation, which, though not\r\ndeclared, has done it more harm than the united efforts of all its\r\nenemies_?\r\n\r\n\"_Query VIII._ Whether, if it happened two years ago, that this trade\r\nbecame something more necessary to us than formerly, it is not easily\r\nproved, that it was occasioned only by the Czar's forcing us out of our\r\nold channel of trade to Archangel, and bringing us to Petersburg, and\r\nour complying therewith. So that all the inconveniences we laboured\r\nunder upon that account ought to have been laid to the Czar's door, and\r\nnot to the King of Sweden's?\r\n\r\n\"_Query IX._ Whether the Czar did not in the very beginning of 1715\r\nagain permit us to trade our old way to Archangel, and whether our\r\nMinisters had not notice thereof a great while before our fleet was sent\r\nthat year to protect our _trade to Petersburg_, which by this alteration\r\nin the Czar's resolution was become as unnecessary for us as before?\r\n\r\n\"_Query X._ Whether the King of Sweden had not declared, that if we\r\nwould forbear trading to _Petersburg_, etc., which he looked upon as\r\nruinous to his kingdom, he would in no manner disturb our trade, neither\r\nin the Baltic nor anywhere else; but that in case we would not give him\r\nthis slight proof of our friendship, he should be excused if the\r\ninnocent came to suffer with the guilty?\r\n\r\n\"_Query XI._ Whether, by our insisting upon the trade to the ports\r\nprohibited by the King of Sweden, which besides it being unnecessary to\r\nus, hardly makes one part in ten of that we carry on in the Baltic, we\r\nhave not drawn upon us the hazards that our trade has run all this\r\nwhile, been ourselves the occasion of our great expenses in fitting out\r\nfleets for its protection, and by our joining with the enemies of\r\nSweden, fully justified his Swedish Majesty's resentment; had it ever\r\ngone so far as to seize and confiscate without distinction all our ships\r\nand effects, wheresoever he found them, either within or without his\r\nkingdoms?\r\n\r\n\"_Query XII._ If we were so tender of our trade to the northern ports in\r\ngeneral, ought we not in policy rather to have considered the hazard\r\nthat trade runs by the approaching ruin of Sweden, and _by the Czar's\r\nbecoming the whole and sole master of the Baltic, and all the naval\r\nstores we want from thence_? Have we not also suffered greater hardships\r\nand losses in the said trade from the Czar, than that amounting only to\r\nsixty odd thousand pounds (whereof, by the way, two parts in three may\r\nperhaps be disputable), which provoked us first to send twenty\r\nmen-of-war in the Baltic with order to attack the Swedes wherever they\r\nmet them? And yet, did not this very Czar, this very aspiring and\r\ndangerous prince, _last summer command the whole confederate fleet_, as\r\nit was called, _of which our men-of-war made the most considerable part?\r\nThe first instance that ever was of a Foreign Potentate having the\r\ncommand given him of the English fleet, the bulwark of our nation_; and\r\ndid not our said men-of-war afterwards convey his (the Czar's) transport\r\nships and troops on board of them, in their return from Zealand,\r\n_protecting them from the Swedish fleet_, which else would have made a\r\nconsiderable havoc amongst them?\r\n\r\n\"_Query XIII._ Suppose now, we had, on the contrary, taken hold of the\r\ngreat and many complaints our merchants have made of the ill-usage they\r\nmeet from the Czar, to have sent our fleet to show our resentment\r\nagainst that prince, to prevent his great and pernicious designs even to\r\nus, _to assist Sweden pursuant to this Treaty_, and effectually to\r\nrestore the peace in the North, would not that have been more for our\r\ninterest, more necessary, more honourable and just, and more according\r\nto our Treaty; and would not the several 100,000 pounds these our\r\nNorthern expeditions have cost the nation, have been thus better\r\nemployed?\r\n\r\n\"_Query XIV._ If the preserving and securing our trade against the\r\nSwedes has been the only and real object of all our measures, as to the\r\nNorthern affairs, how came we the year before the last to leave eight\r\nmen-of-war in the Baltic and at Copenhagen, when we had no more trade\r\nthere to protect, and how came Admiral Norris last summer, although he\r\nand the Dutch together made up the number of twenty-six men-of-war, and\r\nconsequently were too strong for the Swedes, to attempt anything against\r\nour trade under their convoy; yet to lay above two whole months of the\r\nbest season in the Sound, without convoying our and the Dutch\r\nmerchantmen to the several ports they were bound for, whereby they were\r\nkept in the Baltic so late that their return could not but be very\r\nhazardous, as it even proved, both to them and our men-of-war\r\nthemselves? Will not the world be apt to think that the hopes of forcing\r\nthe King of Sweden to an inglorious and disadvantageous peace, by which\r\nthe Duchies of Bremen and Verden ought to be added to the Hanover\r\ndominions, or that some other such view, foreign, if not contrary, to\r\nthe true and old interest of Great Britain, had then a greater influence\r\nupon all these our proceedings than _the pretended care of our trade_?\r\n\r\n\"_Article XVIII._ For as much as it seems convenient for the\r\npreservation of the liberty of navigation and commerce in the Baltic\r\nSea, that a firm and exact friendship should be kept between the Kings\r\nof Sweden and Denmark; and whereas the former Kings of Sweden and\r\nDenmark did oblige themselves mutually, not only by the public Articles\r\nof Peace made in the camp of Copenhagen, on the 27th of May, 1660, and\r\nby the ratifications of the agreement interchanged on both sides,\r\nsacredly and inviolably to observe all and every one of the clauses\r\ncomprehended in the said agreement, but also declared together to ...\r\nCharles II., King of Great Britain ... a little before the treaty\r\nconcluded between England and Sweden in the year 1665, that they would\r\nstand sincerely ... to all ... of the Articles of the said peace ...\r\nwhereupon Charles II., with the approbation and consent of both the\r\nforementioned Kings of Sweden and Denmark, took upon himself a little\r\nafter the Treaty concluded between England and Sweden, 1st March, 1665,\r\nto wit 9th October, 1665, guarantee of the same agreements.... Whereas\r\nan instrument of peace between ... the Kings of Sweden and Denmark\r\nhappened to be soon after these concluded at Lunden in Schonen, in 1679,\r\nwhich contains an express transaction, and repetition and confirmation\r\nof the Treaties concluded at Roskild, Copenhagen, and Westphalia;\r\ntherefore ... the King of Great Britain binds himself by the force of\r\nthis Treaty ... that if either of the Kings of Sweden and Denmark shall\r\nconsent to the violation, either of all the agreements, or of one or\r\nmore articles comprehended in them, and consequently if either of the\r\nKings shall to the prejudice of the person, provinces, territories,\r\nislands, goods, dominions and rights of the other, which by the force of\r\nthe agreements so often repeated, and made in the camp of Copenhagen, on\r\nthe 27th of May, 1660, as also of those made in the ... peace at Lunden\r\nin Schonen in 1679, were attributed to every one that was interested and\r\ncomprehended in the words of the peace, should either by himself or by\r\nothers, presume, or secretly design or attempt, or by open molestations,\r\nor by any injury, or by any violence of arms, attempt anything; that\r\nthen the ... King of Great Britain ... shall first of all, by his\r\ninterposition, perform all the offices of a friend and princely ally,\r\nwhich may serve towards the keeping inviolable all the frequently\r\nmentioned agreements, and of every article comprehended in them, and\r\nconsequently towards the preservation of peace between both kings; that\r\nafterwards if the King, who is the beginner of such prejudice, or any\r\nmolestation or injury, contrary to all agreements, and contrary to any\r\narticles comprehended in them, shall refuse after being admonished ...\r\nthen the King of Great Britain ... shall ... assist him that is injured\r\nas by the present agreements between the Kings of Great Britain and\r\nSweden in such cases is determined and agreed.\r\n\r\n\"_Query._ Does not this article expressly tell us how to remedy the\r\ndisturbances our trade in the Baltic might suffer, in case of a\r\nmisunderstanding betwixt the Kings of Sweden and Denmark, by obliging\r\nboth these Princes to keep all the Treaties of Peace that have been\r\nconcluded between them from 1660-1670, and in case either of them should\r\nin an hostile manner act against the said Treaties, by assisting the\r\nother against the aggressor? How comes it then that we don't make use of\r\nso just a remedy against an evil we are so great sufferers by? Can\r\nanybody, though ever so partial, deny but the King of Denmark, though\r\nseemingly a sincere friend to the King of Sweden, from the peace of\r\nTravendahl till he went out of Saxony against the Muscovites, fell very\r\nunjustly upon him immediately after, taking ungenerously advantage of\r\nthe fatal battle of Pultava? Is not then the King of Denmark the\r\nviolator of all the above-mentioned Treaties, and consequently the true\r\nauthor of the disturbances our trade meets with in the Baltic? Why in\r\nGod's name don't we, according to this article, assist Sweden against\r\nhim, and why do we, on the contrary, declare openly against the injured\r\nKing of Sweden, send hectoring and threatening memorials to him, upon\r\nthe least advantage he has over his enemies, as we did last summer upon\r\nhis entering Norway, and even order our fleets to act openly against him\r\nin conjunction with the Danes?\r\n\r\n\"_Article XIX._ There shall be 'stricter confederacy and union between\r\nthe above-mentioned Kings of Great Britain and Sweden, for the future,\r\n_for the defence and preservation of the Protestant, Evangelic, and\r\nreformed religion_.'\r\n\r\n\"_Query I._ How do we, according to this article, join with Sweden to\r\n_assert, protect, and preserve the Protestant religion_? Don't we suffer\r\nthat nation, which has always been a bulwark to the said religion, most\r\nunmercifully to be torn to pieces?... _Don't we ourselves give a helping\r\nhand towards its destruction?_ And why all this? Because our merchants\r\nhave lost their ships to the value of sixty odd thousand pounds. _For\r\nthis loss, and nothing else, was the pretended reason why, in the year\r\n1715, we sent our fleet in the Baltic, at the expense of £200,000_; and\r\nas to what our merchants have suffered since, suppose we attribute it to\r\nour threatening memorials as well as open hostilities against the King\r\nof Sweden, must we not even then own that that Prince's resentment has\r\nbeen very moderate?\r\n\r\n\"_Query II._ How can other Princes, and especially our fellow\r\nProtestants, think us sincere in what we have made them believe as to\r\nour zeal in spending millions of lives and money for to secure the\r\nProtestant interest only in one single branch of it, _I mean the\r\nProtestant succession here_, when they see that that succession has\r\nhardly taken place, before we, only for sixty odd thousand pounds, (for\r\nlet us always remember that this paltry sum was the first pretence for\r\nour quarrelling with Sweden) go about to undermine the very foundation\r\nof that interest in general, by helping, as we do, entirely to sacrifice\r\nSweden, the old and sincere protector of the Protestants, to its\r\nneighbours, of which some are professed Papists, some worse, and some,\r\nat least, but lukewarm Protestants?\r\n\r\n\"_Article XX._ Therefore, that a reciprocal faith of the Allies and\r\ntheir perseverance in this agreement may appear ... both the\r\nfore-mentioned kings mutually oblige themselves, and declare that ...\r\nthey will not depart a tittle from the genuine and common sense of all\r\nand every article of this treaty under any pretences of friendship,\r\nprofit, former treaty, agreement, and promise, or upon any colour\r\nwhatsoever: but that they will most fully and readily, either by\r\nthemselves, or ministers, or subjects, put in execution whatsoever they\r\nhave promised in this treaty ... without any hesitation, exception, or\r\nexcuse....\r\n\r\n\"_Query I._ Inasmuch as this article sets forth that, at the time of\r\nconcluding of the treaty, we were under no engagement contrary to it,\r\nand that it were highly unjust should we afterwards, and while this\r\ntreaty is in force, which is eighteen years after the day it was signed,\r\nhave entered into any such engagements, how can we justify to the world\r\nour late proceedings against the King of Sweden, which naturally seem\r\nthe consequences of a treaty either of our own making with the enemies\r\nof that Prince, _or of some Court or other that at present influences\r\nour measures_?\r\n\r\n\"_Query II._ The words in this article ... how in the name of honour,\r\nfaith, and justice, do they agree with the _little and pitiful\r\npretences_ we now make use of, not only for not assisting Sweden,\r\npursuant to this treaty, _but even for going about so heartily as we do\r\nto destroy it_?\r\n\r\n\"_Article XXI._ This defensive treaty shall last for eighteen years,\r\nbefore the end of which the confederate kings may ... again treat.\r\n\r\n\"_Ratification of the abovesaid treaty._ We, having seen and considered\r\nthis treaty, have approved and confirmed the same in all and every\r\nparticular article and clause as by the present. We do approve the same\r\nfor us, our heirs, and successors; assuring and promising our princely\r\nword that we shall perform and observe sincerely and in good earnest all\r\nthose things that are therein contained, for the better confirmation\r\nwhereof we have ordered our great seal of England to be put to these\r\npresents, which were given at our palace of Kensington, 25th of\r\nFebruary, in the year of our Lord 1700, and in the 11th year of our\r\nreign (Gulielmus Rex).[22]\r\n\r\n\"_Query._ How can any of us that declares himself for the late happy\r\nrevolution, and that is a true and grateful lover of King William's for\r\never-glorious memory ... yet bear with the least patience, that the said\r\ntreaty should (that I may again use the words of the 20th article) be\r\n_departed from, under any pretence of profit, or upon any colour\r\nwhatsoever_, especially so insignificant and trifling a one as that\r\nwhich has been made use of for two years together to employ our ships,\r\nour men, and our money, _to accomplish the ruin of Sweden_, that same\r\nSweden whose defence and preservation this great and wise monarch of\r\nours has so solemnly promised, and which he always looked upon to be of\r\nthe utmost necessity for to secure the Protestant interest in Europe?\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[22] The treaty was concluded at the Hague on the 6th and 16th January,\r\n1700, and ratified by William III. on February 5th, 1700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon an analysis of the pamphlet headed, \"_Truth is but\r\ntruth, as it is timed_,\" with which we shall conclude the _Introduction_\r\nto the Diplomatic Revelations, some preliminary remarks on the general\r\nhistory of Russian politics appear opportune.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming influence of Russia has taken Europe at different\r\nepochs by surprise, startled the peoples of the West, and been submitted\r\nto as a fatality, or resisted only by convulsions. But alongside the\r\nfascination exercised by Russia, there runs an ever-reviving scepticism,\r\ndogging her like a shadow, growing with her growth, mingling shrill\r\nnotes of irony with the cries of agonising peoples, and mocking her very\r\ngrandeur as a histrionic attitude taken up to dazzle and to cheat. Other\r\nempires have met with similar doubts in their infancy; Russia has become\r\na colossus without outliving them. She affords the only instance in\r\nhistory of an immense empire, the very existence of whose power, even\r\nafter world-wide achievements, has never ceased to be treated like a\r\nmatter of faith rather than like a matter of fact. From the outset of\r\nthe eighteenth century to our days, no author, whether he intended to\r\nexalt or to check Russia, thought it possible to dispense with first\r\nproving her existence.\r\n\r\nBut whether we be spiritualists or materialists with respect to\r\nRussia--whether we consider her power as a palpable fact, or as the mere\r\nvision of the guilt-stricken consciences of the European peoples--the\r\nquestion remains the same: \"How did this power, or this phantom of a\r\npower, contrive to assume such dimensions as to rouse on the one side\r\nthe passionate assertion, and on the other the angry denial of its\r\nthreatening the world with a rehearsal of Universal Monarchy?\" At the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century Russia was regarded as a mushroom\r\ncreation extemporised by the genius of Peter the Great. Schloezer\r\nthought it a discovery to have found out that she possessed a past; and\r\nin modern times, writers, like Fallmerayer, unconsciously following in\r\nthe track beaten by Russian historians, have deliberately asserted that\r\nthe northern spectre which frightens the Europe of the nineteenth\r\ncentury already overshadowed the Europe of the ninth century. With them\r\nthe policy of Russia begins with the first Ruriks, and has, with some\r\ninterruptions indeed, been systematically continued to the present hour.\r\n\r\nAncient maps of Russia are unfolded before us, displaying even larger\r\nEuropean dimensions than she can boast of now: her perpetual movement of\r\naggrandizement from the ninth to the eleventh century is anxiously\r\npointed out; we are shown Oleg launching 88,000 men against Byzantium,\r\nfixing his shield as a trophy on the gate of that capital, and dictating\r\nan ignominious treaty to the Lower Empire; Igor making it tributary;\r\nSviataslaff glorying, \"the Greeks supply me with gold, costly stuffs,\r\nrice, fruits and wine; Hungary furnishes cattle and horses; from Russia\r\nI draw honey, wax, furs, and men\"; Vladimir conquering the Crimea and\r\nLivonia, extorting a daughter from the Greek Emperor, as Napoleon did\r\nfrom the German Emperor, blending the military sway of a northern\r\nconqueror with the theocratic despotism of the Porphyro-geniti, and\r\nbecoming at once the master of his subjects on earth, and their\r\nprotector in heaven.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the plausible parallelism suggested by these\r\nreminiscences, the policy of the first Ruriks differs fundamentally from\r\nthat of modern Russia. It was nothing more nor less than the policy of\r\nthe German barbarians inundating Europe--the history of the modern\r\nnations beginning only after the deluge has passed away. The Gothic\r\nperiod of Russia in particular forms but a chapter of the Norman\r\nconquests. As the empire of Charlemagne precedes the foundation of\r\nmodern France, Germany, and Italy, so the empire of the Ruriks precedes\r\nthe foundation of Poland, Lithuania, the Baltic Settlements, Turkey,\r\nand Muscovy itself. The rapid movement of aggrandizement was not the\r\nresult of deep-laid schemes, but the natural offspring of the primitive\r\norganization of Norman conquest--vassalship without fiefs, or fiefs\r\nconsisting only in tributes--the necessity of fresh conquests being kept\r\nalive by the uninterrupted influx of new Varangian adventurers, panting\r\nfor glory and plunder. The chiefs, becoming anxious for repose, were\r\ncompelled by the Faithful Band to move on, and in Russian, as in French\r\nNormandy, there arrived the moment when the chiefs despatched on new\r\npredatory excursions their uncontrollable and insatiable\r\ncompanions-in-arms with the single view to get rid of them. Warfare and\r\norganization of conquest on the part of the first Ruriks differ in no\r\npoint from those of the Normans in the rest of Europe. If Slavonian\r\ntribes were subjected not only by the sword, but also by mutual\r\nconvention, this singularity is due to the exceptional position of those\r\ntribes, placed between a northern and eastern invasion, and embracing\r\nthe former as a protection from the latter. The same magic charm which\r\nattracted other northern barbarians to the Rome of the West attracted\r\nthe Varangians to the Rome of the East. The very migration of the\r\nRussian capital--Rurik fixing it at Novgorod, Oleg removing it to Kiev,\r\nand Sviataslaff attempting to establish it in Bulgaria--proves beyond\r\ndoubt that the invader was only feeling his way, and considered Russia\r\nas a mere halting-place from which to wander on in search of an empire\r\nin the South. If modern Russia covets the possession of Constantinople\r\nto establish her dominion over the world, the Ruriks were, on the\r\ncontrary, forced by the resistance of Byzantium, under Zimiskes,\r\ndefinitively to establish their dominion in Russia.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that victors and vanquished amalgamated more quickly\r\nin Russia than in any other conquest of the northern barbarians, that\r\nthe chiefs soon commingled themselves with the Slavonians--as shown by\r\ntheir marriages and their names. But then, it should be recollected that\r\nthe Faithful Band, which formed at once their guard and their privy\r\ncouncil, remained exclusively composed of Varangians; that Vladimir,\r\nwho marks the summit, and Yaroslav, who marks the commencing decline of\r\nGothic Russia, were seated on her throne by the arms of the Varangians.\r\nIf any Slavonian influence is to be acknowledged in this epoch, it is\r\nthat of Novgorod, a Slavonian State, the traditions, policy, and\r\ntendencies of which were so antagonistic to those of modern Russia that\r\nthe one could found her existence only on the ruins of the other. Under\r\nYaroslav the supremacy of the Varangians is broken, but simultaneously\r\nwith it disappears the conquering tendency of the first period, and the\r\ndecline of Gothic Russia begins. The history of that decline, more still\r\nthan that of the conquest and formation, proves the exclusively Gothic\r\ncharacter of the Empire of the Ruriks.\r\n\r\nThe incongruous, unwieldy, and precocious Empire heaped together by the\r\nRuriks, like the other empires of similar growth, is broken up into\r\nappanages, divided and subdivided among the descendants of the\r\nconquerors, dilacerated by feudal wars, rent to pieces by the\r\nintervention of foreign peoples. The paramount authority of the Grand\r\nPrince vanishes before the rival claims of seventy princes of the blood.\r\nThe attempt of Andrew of Susdal at recomposing some large limbs of the\r\nempire by the removal of the capital from Kiev to Vladimir proves\r\nsuccessful only in propagating the decomposition from the South to the\r\ncentre. Andrew's third successor resigns even the last shadow of\r\nsupremacy, the title of Grand Prince, and the merely nominal homage\r\nstill offered him. The appanages to the South and to the West become by\r\nturns Lithuanian, Polish, Hungarian, Livonian, Swedish. Kiev itself, the\r\nancient capital, follows destinies of its own, after having dwindled\r\ndown from a seat of the Grand Princedom to the territory of a city.\r\nThus, the Russia of the Normans completely disappears from the stage,\r\nand the few weak reminiscences in which it still outlived itself,\r\ndissolve before the terrible apparition of Genghis Khan. The bloody mire\r\nof Mongolian slavery, not the rude glory of the Norman epoch, forms the\r\ncradle of Muscovy, and modern Russia is but a metamorphosis of Muscovy.\r\n\r\nThe Tartar yoke lasted from 1237 to 1462--more than two centuries; a\r\nyoke not only crushing, but dishonouring and withering the very soul of\r\nthe people that fell its prey. The Mongol Tartars established a rule of\r\nsystematic terror, devastation and wholesale massacre forming its\r\ninstitutions. Their numbers being scanty in proportion to their enormous\r\nconquests, they wanted to magnify them by a halo of consternation, and\r\nto thin, by wholesale slaughter, the populations which might rise in\r\ntheir rear. In their creations of desert they were, besides, led by the\r\nsame economical principle which has depopulated the Highlands of\r\nScotland and the Campagna di Roma--the conversion of men into sheep, and\r\nof fertile lands and populous abodes into pasturage.\r\n\r\nThe Tartar yoke had already lasted a hundred years before Muscovy\r\nemerged from its obscurity. To entertain discord among the Russian\r\nprinces, and secure their servile submission, the Mongols had restored\r\nthe dignity of the Grand Princedom. The strife among the Russian princes\r\nfor this dignity was, as a modern author has it, \"an abject strife--the\r\nstrife of slaves, whose chief weapon was calumny, and who were always\r\nready to denounce each other to their cruel rulers; wrangling for a\r\ndegraded throne, whence they could not move but with plundering,\r\nparricidal hands--hands filled with gold and stained with gore; which\r\nthey dared not ascend without grovelling, nor retain but on their knees,\r\nprostrate and trembling beneath the scimitar of a Tartar, always ready\r\nto roll under his feet those servile crowns, and the heads by which they\r\nwere worn.\" It was in this infamous strife that the Moscow branch won at\r\nlast the race. In 1328 the crown of the Grand Princedom, wrested from\r\nthe branch of Tver by dint of denunciation and assassination, was picked\r\nup at the feet of Usbeck Khan by Yury, the elder brother of Ivan Kalita.\r\nIvan I. Kalita, and Ivan III., surnamed the Great, personate Muscovy\r\nrising by means of the Tartar yoke, and Muscovy getting an independent\r\npower by the disappearance of the Tartar rule. The whole policy of\r\nMuscovy, from its first entrance into the historical arena, is resumed\r\nin the history of these two individuals.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Ivan Kalita was simply this: to play the abject tool of\r\nthe Khan, thus to borrow his power, and then to turn it round upon his\r\nprincely rivals and his own subjects. To attain this end, he had to\r\ninsinuate himself with the Tartars by dint of cynical adulation, by\r\nfrequent journeys to the Golden Horde, by humble prayers for the hand of\r\nMongol princesses, by a display of unbounded zeal for the Khan's\r\ninterest, by the unscrupulous execution of his orders, by atrocious\r\ncalumnies against his own kinsfolk, by blending in himself the\r\ncharacters of the Tartar's hangman, sycophant, and slave-in-chief. He\r\nperplexed the Khan by continuous revelations of secret plots. Whenever\r\nthe branch of Tver betrayed a velleité of national independence, he\r\nhurried to the Horde to denounce it. Wherever he met with resistance, he\r\nintroduced the Tartar to trample it down. But it was not sufficient to\r\nact a character; to make it acceptable, gold was required. Perpetual\r\nbribery of the Khan and his grandees was the only sure foundation upon\r\nwhich to raise his fabric of deception and usurpation. But how was the\r\nslave to get the money wherewith to bribe the master? He persuaded the\r\nKhan to instal him his tax-gatherer throughout all the Russian\r\nappanages. Once invested with this function, he extorted money under\r\nfalse pretences. The wealth accumulated by the dread held out of the\r\nTartar name, he used to corrupt the Tartars themselves. By a bribe he\r\ninduced the primate to transfer his episcopal seat from Vladimir to\r\nMoscow, thus making the latter the capital of the empire, because the\r\nreligious capital, and coupling the power of the Church with that of his\r\nthrone. By a bribe he allured the Boyards of the rival princes into\r\ntreason against their chiefs, and attracted them to himself as their\r\ncentre. By the joint influence of the Mahometan Tartar, the Greek\r\nChurch, and the Boyards, he unites the princes holding appanages into a\r\ncrusade against the most dangerous of them--the prince of Tver; and then\r\nhaving driven his recent allies by bold attempts at usurpation into\r\nresistance against himself, into a war for the public good, he draws not\r\nthe sword but hurries to the Khan. By bribes and delusion again, he\r\nseduces him into assassinating his kindred rivals under the most cruel\r\ntorments. It was the traditional policy of the Tartar to check the\r\nRussian princes the one by the other, to feed their dissensions, to\r\ncause their forces to equiponderate, and to allow none to consolidate\r\nhimself. Ivan Kalita converts the Khan into the tool by which he rids\r\nhimself of his most dangerous competitors, and weighs down every\r\nobstacle to his own usurping march. He does not conquer the appanages,\r\nbut surreptitiously turns the rights of the Tartar conquest to his\r\nexclusive profit. He secures the succession of his son through the same\r\nmeans by which he had raised the Grand Princedom of Muscovy, that\r\nstrange compound of princedom and serfdom. During his whole reign he\r\nswerves not once from the line of policy he had traced to himself;\r\nclinging to it with a tenacious firmness, and executing it with\r\nmethodical boldness. Thus he becomes the founder of the Muscovite power,\r\nand characteristically his people call him Kalita--that is, the purse,\r\nbecause it was the purse and not the sword with which he cut his way.\r\nThe very period of his reign witnesses the sudden growth of the\r\nLithuanian power which dismembers the Russian appanages from the West,\r\nwhile the Tartar squeezes them into one mass from the East. Ivan, while\r\nhe dared not repulse the one disgrace, seemed anxious to exaggerate the\r\nother. He was not to be seduced from following up his ends by the\r\nallurements of glory, the pangs of conscience, or the lassitude of\r\nhumiliation. His whole system may be expressed in a few words: the\r\nmachiavelism of the usurping slave. His own weakness--his slavery--he\r\nturned into the mainspring of his strength.\r\n\r\nThe policy traced by Ivan I. Kalita is that of his successors; they had\r\nonly to enlarge the circle of its application. They followed it up\r\nlaboriously, gradually, inflexibly. From Ivan I. Kalita, we may,\r\ntherefore, pass at once to Ivan III., surnamed the Great.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of his reign (1462-1505) Ivan III. was still a\r\ntributary to the Tartars; his authority was still contested by the\r\nprinces holding appanages; Novgorod, the head of the Russian republics,\r\nreigned over the north of Russia; Poland-Lithuania was striving for the\r\nconquest of Muscovy; lastly, the Livonian knights were not yet disarmed.\r\nAt the end of his reign we behold Ivan III. seated on an independent\r\nthrone, at his side the daughter of the last emperor of Byzantium, at\r\nhis feet Kasan, and the remnant of the Golden Horde flocking to his\r\ncourt; Novgorod and the other Russian republics enslaved--Lithuania\r\ndiminished, and its king a tool in Ivan's hands--the Livonian knights\r\nvanquished. Astonished Europe, at the commencement of Ivan's reign,\r\nhardly aware of the existence of Muscovy, hemmed in between the Tartar\r\nand the Lithuanian, was dazzled by the sudden appearance of an immense\r\nempire on its eastern confines, and Sultan Bajazet himself, before whom\r\nEurope trembled, heard for the first time the haughty language of the\r\nMuscovite. How, then, did Ivan accomplish these high deeds? Was he a\r\nhero? The Russian historians themselves show him up a confessed coward.\r\n\r\nLet us shortly survey his principal contests, in the sequence in which\r\nhe undertook and concluded them--his contests with the Tartars, with\r\nNovgorod, with the princes holding appanages, and lastly with\r\nLithuania-Poland.\r\n\r\nIvan rescued Muscovy from the Tartar yoke, not by one bold stroke, but\r\nby the patient labour of about twenty years. He did not break the yoke,\r\nbut disengaged himself by stealth. Its overthrow, accordingly, has more\r\nthe look of the work of nature than the deed of man. When the Tartar\r\nmonster expired at last, Ivan appeared at its deathbed like a physician,\r\nwho prognosticated and speculated on death rather than like a warrior\r\nwho imparted it. The character of every people enlarges with its\r\nenfranchisement from a foreign yoke; that of Muscovy in the hands of\r\nIvan seems to diminish. Compare only Spain in its struggles against the\r\nArabs with Muscovy in its struggles against the Tartars.\r\n\r\nAt the period of Ivan's accession to the throne, the Golden Horde had\r\nlong since been weakened, internally by fierce feuds, externally by the\r\nseparation from them of the Nogay Tartars, the eruption of Timour\r\nTamerlane, the rise of the Cossacks, and the hostility of the Crimean\r\nTartars. Muscovy, on the contrary, by steadily pursuing the policy\r\ntraced by Ivan Kalita, had grown to a mighty mass, crushed, but at the\r\nsame time compactly united by the Tartar chain. The Khans, as if struck\r\nby a charm, had continued to remain instruments of Muscovite\r\naggrandizement and concentration. By calculation they had added to the\r\npower of the Greek Church, which, in the hand of the Muscovite grand\r\nprinces, proved the deadliest weapon against them.\r\n\r\nIn rising against the Horde, the Muscovite had not to invent but only to\r\nimitate the Tartars themselves. But Ivan did not rise. He humbly\r\nacknowledged himself a slave of the Golden Horde. By bribing a Tartar\r\nwoman he seduced the Khan into commanding the withdrawal from Muscovy of\r\nthe Mongol residents. By similar and imperceptible and surreptitious\r\nsteps he duped the Khan into successive concessions, all ruinous to his\r\nsway. He thus did not conquer, but filch strength. He does not drive,\r\nbut manoeuvre his enemy out of his strongholds. Still continuing to\r\nprostrate himself before the Khan's envoys, and to proclaim himself his\r\ntributary, he eludes the payment of the tribute under false pretences,\r\nemploying all the stratagems of a fugitive slave who dare not front his\r\nowner, but only steal out of his reach. At last the Mongol awakes from\r\nhis torpor, and the hour of battle sounds. Ivan, trembling at the mere\r\nsemblance of an armed encounter, attempts to hide himself behind his own\r\nfear, and to disarm the fury of his enemy by withdrawing the object upon\r\nwhich to wreak his vengeance. He is only saved by the intervention of\r\nthe Crimean Tartars, his allies. Against a second invasion of the Horde,\r\nhe ostentatiously gathers together such disproportionate forces that the\r\nmere rumour of their number parries the attack. At the third invasion,\r\nfrom the midst of 200,000 men, he absconds a disgraced deserter.\r\nReluctantly dragged back, he attempts to haggle for conditions of\r\nslavery, and at last, pouring into his army his own servile fear, he\r\ninvolves it in a general and disorderly flight. Muscovy was then\r\nanxiously awaiting its irretrievable doom, when it suddenly hears that\r\nby an attack on their capital made by the Crimean Khan, the Golden Horde\r\nhas been forced to withdraw, and has, on its retreat, been destroyed by\r\nthe Cossacks and Nogay Tartars. Thus defeat was turned into success, and\r\nIvan had overthrown the Golden Horde, not by fighting it himself, but by\r\nchallenging it through a feigned desire of combat into offensive\r\nmovements, which exhausted its remnants of vitality and exposed it to\r\nthe fatal blows of the tribes of its own race whom he had managed to\r\nturn into his allies. He caught one Tartar with another Tartar. As the\r\nimmense danger he had himself summoned proved unable to betray him into\r\none single trait of manhood, so his miraculous triumph did not infatuate\r\nhim even for one moment. With cautious circumspection he dared not\r\nincorporate Kasan with Muscovy, but made it over to sovereigns belonging\r\nto the family of Menghi-Ghirei, his Crimean ally, to hold it, as it\r\nwere, in trust for Muscovy. With the spoils of the vanquished Tartar, he\r\nenchained the victorious Tartar. But if too prudent to assume, with the\r\neye-witnesses of his disgrace, the airs of a conqueror, this impostor\r\ndid fully understand how the downfall of the Tartar empire must dazzle\r\nat a distance--with what halo of glory it would encircle him, and how it\r\nwould facilitate a magnificent entry among the European Powers.\r\nAccordingly he assumed abroad the theatrical attitude of the conqueror,\r\nand, indeed, succeeded in hiding under a mask of proud susceptibility\r\nand irritable haughtiness the obtrusiveness of the Mongol serf, who\r\nstill remembered kissing the stirrup of the Khan's meanest envoy. He\r\naped in more subdued tone the voice of his old masters, which terrified\r\nhis soul. Some standing phrases of modern Russian diplomacy, such as the\r\nmagnanimity, the wounded dignity of the master, are borrowed from the\r\ndiplomatic instructions of Ivan III.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Kasan, he set out on a long-planned expedition\r\nagainst Novgorod, the head of the Russian republics. If the overthrow of\r\nthe Tartar yoke was, in his eyes, the first condition of Muscovite\r\ngreatness, the overthrow of Russian freedom was the second. As the\r\nrepublic of Viatka had declared itself neutral between Muscovy and the\r\nHorde, and the republic of Tskof, with its twelve cities, had shown\r\nsymptoms of disaffection, Ivan flattered the latter and affected to\r\nforget the former, meanwhile concentrating all his forces against\r\nNovgorod the Great, with the doom of which he knew the fate of the rest\r\nof the Russian republics to be sealed. By the prospect of sharing in\r\nthis rich booty, he drew after him the princes holding appanages, while\r\nhe inveigled the boyards by working upon their blind hatred of\r\nNovgorodian democracy. Thus he contrived to march three armies upon\r\nNovgorod and to overwhelm it by disproportionate force. But then, in\r\norder not to keep his word to the princes, not to forfeit his immutable\r\n\"Vos non vobis,\" at the same time apprehensive, lest Novgorod should not\r\nyet have become digestible from the want of preparatory treatment, he\r\nthought fit to exhibit a sudden moderation; to content himself with a\r\nransom and the acknowledgment of his suzerainty; but into the act of\r\nsubmission of the republic he smuggled some ambiguous words which made\r\nhim its supreme judge and legislator. Then he fomented the dissensions\r\nbetween the patricians and plebeians raging as well in Novgorod as at\r\nFlorence. Of some complaints of the plebeians he took occasion to\r\nintroduce himself again into the city, to have its nobles, whom he knew\r\nto be hostile to himself, sent to Moscow loaded with chains, and to\r\nbreak the ancient law of the republic that \"none of its citizens should\r\never be tried or punished out of the limits of its own territory.\" From\r\nthat moment he became supreme arbiter. \"Never,\" say the annalists,\r\n\"never since Rurik had such an event happened; never had the grand\r\nprinces of Kiev and Vladimir seen the Novgorodians come and submit to\r\nthem as their judges. Ivan alone could reduce Novgorod to that degree of\r\nhumiliation.\" Seven years were employed by Ivan to corrupt the republic\r\nby the exercise of his judicial authority. Then, when he found its\r\nstrength worn out, he thought the moment ripe for declaring himself. To\r\ndoff his own mask of moderation, he wanted, on the part of Novgorod, a\r\nbreach of the peace. As he had simulated calm endurance, so he\r\nsimulated now a sudden burst of passion. Having bribed an envoy of the\r\nrepublic to address him during a public audience with the name of\r\nsovereign, he claimed, at once, all the rights of a despot--the\r\nself-annihilation of the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne feature characteristic of the Slavonic race must strike every\r\nobserver. Almost everywhere it confined itself to an inland country,\r\nleaving the sea-borders to non-Slavonic tribes. Finno-Tartaric tribes\r\nheld the shores of the Black Sea, Lithuanians and Fins those of the\r\nBaltic and White Sea. Wherever they touched the sea-board, as in the\r\nAdriatic and part of the Baltic, the Slavonians had soon to submit to\r\nforeign rule. The Russian people shared this common fate of the\r\nSlavonian race. Their home, at the time they first appear in history,\r\nwas the country about the sources and upper course of the Volga and its\r\ntributaries, the Dnieper, Don, and Northern Dwina. Nowhere did their\r\nterritory touch the sea except at the extremity of the Gulf of Finland.\r\nNor had they before Peter the Great proved able to conquer any maritime\r\noutlet beside that of the White Sea, which, during three-fourths of the\r\nyear, is itself enchained and immovable. The spot where Petersburg now\r\nstands had been for a thousand years past contested ground between Fins,\r\nSwedes, and Russians. All the remaining extent of coast from Polangen,\r\nnear Memel, to Torrea, the whole coast of the Black Sea, from Akerman to\r\nRedut Kaleh, has been conquered later on. And, as if to witness the\r\nanti-maritime peculiarity of the Slavonic race, of all this line of\r\ncoast, no portion of the Baltic coast has really adopted Russian\r\nnationality. Nor has the Circassian and Mingrelian east coast of the\r\nBlack Sea. It is only the coast of the White Sea, as far as it was worth\r\ncultivating, some portion of the northern coast of the Black Sea, and\r\npart of the coast of the Sea of Azof, that have really been peopled with\r\nRussian inhabitants, who, however, despite the new circumstances in\r\nwhich they are placed, still refrain from taking to the sea, and\r\nobstinately stick to the land-lopers' traditions of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset, Peter the Great broke through all the traditions\r\nof the Slavonic race. \"It is water that Russia wants.\" These words he\r\naddressed as a rebuke to Prince Cantemir are inscribed on the title-page\r\nof his life. The conquest of the Sea of Azof was aimed at in his first\r\nwar with Turkey, the conquest of the Baltic in his war against Sweden,\r\nthe conquest of the Black Sea in his second war against the Porte, and\r\nthe conquest of the Caspian Sea in his fraudulent intervention in\r\nPersia. For a system of local encroachment, land was sufficient; for a\r\nsystem of universal aggression, water had become indispensable. It was\r\nbut by the conversion of Muscovy from a country wholly of land into a\r\nsea-bordering empire, that the traditional limits of the Muscovite\r\npolicy could be superseded and merged into that bold synthesis which,\r\nblending the encroaching method of the Mongol slave with the\r\nworld-conquering tendencies of the Mongol master, forms the life-spring\r\nof modern Russian diplomacy.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that no great nation has ever existed, or been able to\r\nexist, in such an inland position as that of the original empire of\r\nPeter the Great; that none has ever submitted thus to see its coasts and\r\nthe mouths of its rivers torn away from it; that Russia could no more\r\nleave the mouth of the Neva, the natural outlet for the produce of\r\nNorthern Russia, in the hands of the Swedes, than the mouths of the Don,\r\nDnieper, and Bug, and the Straits of Kertch, in the hands of nomadic and\r\nplundering Tartars; that the Baltic provinces, from their very\r\ngeographical configuration, are naturally a corollary to whichever\r\nnation holds the country behind them; that, in one word, Peter, in this\r\nquarter, at least, but took hold of what was absolutely necessary for\r\nthe natural development of his country. From this point of view, Peter\r\nthe Great intended, by his war against Sweden, only rearing a Russian\r\nLiverpool, and endowing it with its indispensable strip of coast.\r\n\r\nBut then, one great fact is slighted over, the _tour de force_ by which\r\nhe transferred the capital of the Empire from the inland centre to the\r\nmaritime extremity, the characteristic boldness with which he erected\r\nthe new capital on the first strip of Baltic coast he conquered, almost\r\nwithin gunshot of the frontier, thus deliberately giving his dominions\r\nan _eccentric centre_. To transfer the throne of the Czars from Moscow\r\nto Petersburg was to place it in a position where it could not be safe,\r\neven from insult, until the whole coast from Libau to Tornea was\r\nsubdued--a work not completed till 1809, by the conquest of Finland.\r\n\"St. Petersburg is the window from which Russia can overlook Europe,\"\r\nsaid Algarotti. It was from the first a defiance to the Europeans, an\r\nincentive to further conquest to the Russians. The fortifications in our\r\nown days of Russian Poland are only a further step in the execution of\r\nthe same idea. Modlin, Warsaw, Ivangorod, are more than citadels to keep\r\na rebellious country in check. They are the same menace to the west\r\nwhich Petersburg, in its immediate bearing, was a hundred years ago to\r\nthe north. They are to transform Russia into Panslavonia, as the Baltic\r\nprovinces were to transform Muscovy into Russia.\r\n\r\nPetersburg, the _eccentric centre_ of the empire, pointed at once to a\r\nperiphery still to be drawn.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, not the mere conquest of the Baltic provinces which\r\nseparates the policy of Peter the Great from that of his ancestors, but\r\nit is the transfer of the capital which reveals the true meaning of his\r\nBaltic conquests. Petersburg was not like Muscovy, the centre of a race,\r\nbut the seat of a government; not the slow work of a people, but the\r\ninstantaneous creation of a man; not the medium from which the\r\npeculiarities of an inland people radiate, but the maritime extremity\r\nwhere they are lost; not the traditionary nucleus of a national\r\ndevelopment, but the deliberately chosen abode of a cosmopolitan\r\nintrigue. By the transfer of the capital, Peter cut off the natural\r\nligaments which bound up the encroaching system of the old Muscovite\r\nCzars with the natural abilities and aspirations of the great Russian\r\nrace. By planting his capital on the margin of a sea, he put to open\r\ndefiance the anti-maritime instincts of that race, and degraded it to a\r\nmere weight in his political mechanism. Since the 16th century Muscovy\r\nhad made no important acquisitions but on the side of Siberia, and to\r\nthe 16th century the dubious conquests made towards the west and the\r\nsouth were only brought about by direct agency on the east. By the\r\ntransfer of the capital, Peter proclaimed that he, on the contrary,\r\nintended working on the east and the immediately neighbouring countries\r\nthrough the agency of the west. If the agency through the east was\r\nnarrowly circumscribed by the stationary character and the limited\r\nrelations of Asiatic peoples, the agency through the west became at once\r\nillimited and universal from the movable character and the all-sided\r\nrelations of Western Europe. The transfer of the capital denoted this\r\nintended change of agency, which the conquest of the Baltic provinces\r\nafforded the means of achieving, by securing at once to Russia the\r\nsupremacy among the neighbouring Northern States; by putting it into\r\nimmediate and constant contact with all points of Europe; by laying the\r\nbasis of a material bond with the maritime Powers, which by this\r\nconquest became dependent on Russia for their naval stores; a dependence\r\nnot existing as long as Muscovy, the country that produced the great\r\nbulk of the naval stores, had got no outlets of its own; while Sweden,\r\nthe Power that held these outlets, had not got the country lying behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf the Muscovite Czars, who worked their encroachments by the agency\r\nprincipally of the Tartar Khans, were obliged to _tartarize_ Muscovy,\r\nPeter the Great, who resolved upon working through the agency of the\r\nwest, was obliged to _civilize_ Russia. In grasping upon the Baltic\r\nprovinces, he seized at once the tools necessary for this process. They\r\nafforded him not only the diplomatists and the generals, the brains with\r\nwhich to execute his system of political and military action on the\r\nwest, they yielded him, at the same time, a crop of bureaucrats,\r\nschoolmasters, and drill-sergeants, who were to drill Russians into that\r\nvarnish of civilization that adapts them to the technical appliances of\r\nthe Western peoples, without imbuing them with their ideas.\r\n\r\nNeither the Sea of Azof, nor the Black Sea, nor the Caspian Sea, could\r\nopen to Peter this direct passage to Europe. Besides, during his\r\nlifetime still Taganrog, Azof, the Black Sea, with its new-formed\r\nRussian fleets, ports, and dockyards, were again abandoned or given up\r\nto the Turk. The Persian conquest, too, proved a premature enterprise.\r\nOf the four wars which fill the military life of Peter the Great, his\r\nfirst war, that against Turkey, the fruits of which were lost in a\r\nsecond Turkish war, continued in one respect the traditionary struggle\r\nwith the Tartars. In another respect, it was but the prelude to the war\r\nagainst Sweden, of which the second Turkish war forms an episode and the\r\nPersian war an epilogue. Thus the war against Sweden, lasting during\r\ntwenty-one years, almost absorbs the military life of Peter the Great.\r\nWhether we consider its purpose, its results, or its endurance, we may\r\njustly call it _the_ war of Peter the Great. His whole creation hinges\r\nupon the conquest of the Baltic coast.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose we were altogether ignorant of the details of his\r\noperations, military and diplomatic. The mere fact that the conversion\r\nof Muscovy into Russia was brought about by its transformation from a\r\nhalf-Asiatic inland country into the paramount maritime Power of the\r\nBaltic, would it not enforce upon us the conclusion that England, the\r\ngreatest maritime Power of that epoch--a maritime Power lying, too, at\r\nthe very gates of the Baltic, where, since the middle of the 17th\r\ncentury, she had maintained the attitude of supreme arbiter--that\r\nEngland must have had her hand in this great change, that she must have\r\nproved the main prop or the main impediment of the plans of Peter the\r\nGreat, that during the long protracted and deadly struggle between\r\nSweden and Russia she must have turned the balance, that if we do not\r\nfind her straining every nerve in order to save the Swede we may be sure\r\nof her having employed all the means at her disposal for furthering the\r\nMuscovite? And yet, in what is commonly called history, England does\r\nhardly appear on the plan of this grand drama, and is represented as a\r\nspectator rather than as an actor. Real history will show that the\r\nKhans of the Golden Horde were no more instrumental in realizing the\r\nplans of Ivan III. and his predecessors than the rulers of England were\r\nin realizing the plans of Peter I. and his successors.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlets which we have reprinted, written as they were by English\r\ncontemporaries of Peter the Great, are far from concurring in the common\r\ndelusions of later historians. They emphatically denounce England as the\r\nmightiest tool of Russia. The same position is taken up by the pamphlet\r\nof which we shall now give a short analysis, and with which we shall\r\nconclude the introduction to the diplomatic revelations. It is entitled,\r\n\"_Truth is but Truth as it is timed; or, our Ministry's present measures\r\nagainst the Muscovite vindicated_, etc., etc. Humbly dedicated to the\r\nHouse of C., London, 1719.\"\r\n\r\nThe former pamphlets we have reprinted, were written at, or shortly\r\nafter, the time when, to use the words of a modern admirer of Russia,\r\n\"Peter traversed the Baltic Sea as master at the head of the combined\r\nsquadrons of all the northern Powers, England included, which gloried in\r\nsailing under his orders.\" In 1719, however, when _Truth is but Truth_\r\nwas published, the face of affairs seemed altogether changed. Charles\r\nXII. was dead, and the English Government now pretended to side with\r\nSweden, and to wage war against Russia. There are other circumstances\r\nconnected with this anonymous pamphlet which claim particular notice. It\r\npurports to be an extract from a relation, which, on his return from\r\nMuscovy, in August, 1715, its author, by order of George I., drew up and\r\nhanded over to Viscount Townshend, then Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"It happens,\" says he, \"to be an advantage that at present I may\r\n     own to have been the first so happy to foresee, or honest to\r\n     forewarn our Court here, of the absolute necessity of our then\r\n     breaking with the Czar, and shutting him out again of the Baltic.\"\r\n     \"My relation discovered his aim as to other States, and even to the\r\n     German Empire, to which, although an inland Power, he had offered\r\n     to annex Livonia as an Electorate, so that he could but be admitted\r\n     as an elector. It drew attention to the Czar's then contemplated\r\n     assumption of the title of Autocrator. Being head of the Greek\r\n     Church he would be owned by the other potentates as head of the\r\n     Greek Empire. I am not to say how reluctant we would be to\r\n     acknowledge that title, since we have already made an ambassador\r\n     treat him with the title of Imperial Majesty, which the Swede has\r\n     never yet condescended to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time attached to the British Embassy in Muscovy, our author, as\r\nhe states, was later on \"_dismissed the service, because the Czar\r\ndesired it_,\" having made sure that\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"I had given our Court such light into his affairs as is contained\r\n     in this paper; for which I beg leave to appeal to the King, and to\r\n     vouch the Viscount Townshend, who heard his Majesty give that\r\n     vindication.\" \"And yet, notwithstanding all this, I have been for\r\n     these five years past kept soliciting for a very long arrear still\r\n     due, and whereof I contracted the greatest part in executing a\r\n     commission for her late Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anti-Muscovite attitude, suddenly assumed by the Stanhope Cabinet,\r\nour author looks to in rather a sceptic mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"I do not pretend to foreclose, by this paper, the Ministry of that\r\n     applause due to them from the public, when they shall satisfy us as\r\n     to what the motives were which made them, till but yesterday,\r\n     straiten the Swede in everything, although then our ally as much as\r\n     now; or strengthen, by all the ways they could, the Czar, although\r\n     under no tie, but barely that of amity with Great Britain.... At\r\n     the minute I write this I learn that the gentleman who brought the\r\n     Muscovites, not yet three years ago, as a royal navy, not under our\r\n     protection, on their first appearance in the Baltic, is again\r\n     authorized by the persons now in power, to give the Czar a second\r\n     meeting in these seas. For what reason or to what good end?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentleman hinted at is Admiral Norris, whose Baltic campaign against\r\nPeter I. seems, indeed, to be the original pattern upon which the recent\r\nnaval campaigns of Admirals Napier and Dundas were cut out.\r\n\r\nThe restoration to Sweden of the Baltic provinces is required by the\r\ncommercial as well as the political interest of Great Britain. Such is\r\nthe pith of our author's argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Trade is become the very life of our State; and what food is to\r\n     life, naval stores are to a fleet. The whole trade we drive with\r\n     all the other nations of the earth, at best, is but lucrative;\r\n     this, of the north, is indispensably needful, and may not be\r\n     improperly termed the _sacra embole_ of Great Britain, as being\r\n     its chiefest foreign vent, for the support of all our trade, and\r\n     our safety at home. As woollen manufactures and minerals are the\r\n     staple commodities of Great Britain, so are likewise naval stores\r\n     those of Muscovy, as also of all those very provinces in the Baltic\r\n     which the Czar has so lately wrested from the crown of Sweden.\r\n     Since those provinces have been in the Czar's possession, Pernan is\r\n     entirely waste. At Revel we have not one British merchant left, and\r\n     all the trade which was formerly at Narwa is now brought to\r\n     Petersburg.... The Swede could never possibly engross the trade of\r\n     our subjects, because those seaports in his hands were but so many\r\n     thoroughfares from whence these commodities were uttered, the\r\n     places of their produce or manufacture lying behind those ports, in\r\n     the dominions of the Czar. But, if left to the Czar, these Baltic\r\n     ports are no more thoroughfares, but peculiar magazines from the\r\n     inland countries of the Czar's own dominions. Having already\r\n     Archangel in the White Sea, to leave him but any seaport in the\r\n     Baltic were to put no less in his hands than the _two keys of the\r\n     general magazines of all the naval stores of Europe_; it being\r\n     known that Danes, Swedes, Poles, and Prussians have but single and\r\n     distinct branches of those commodities in their several dominions.\r\n     If the Czar should thus engross 'the supply of what we cannot do\r\n     without,' where then is our fleet? Or, indeed, where is the\r\n     security for all our trade to any part of the earth besides?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, then, the interest of British commerce requires to exclude the Czar\r\nfrom the Baltic, the interest of our State ought to be no less a spur to\r\nquicken us to that attempt. By the interest of our State I would be\r\nunderstood to mean neither the party measures of a Ministry, nor any\r\nforeign motives of a Court, but precisely what is, and ever must be, the\r\nimmediate concern, either for the safety, ease, dignity, or emolument of\r\nthe Crown, as well as the common weal of Great Britain. With respect to\r\nthe Baltic, it has \"from the earliest period of our naval power\" always\r\nbeen considered a fundamental interest of our State: first, to prevent\r\nthe rise there of any new maritime Power; and, secondly, to maintain the\r\nbalance of power between Denmark and Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"One instance of the wisdom and foresight of our _then truly\r\n     British statesmen_ is the peace at Stalboa, in the year 1617. James\r\n     the First was the mediator of that treaty, by which the Muscovite\r\n     was obliged to give up all the provinces which he then was\r\n     possessed of in the Baltic, and to be barely an inland Power on\r\n     this side of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same policy of preventing a new maritime Power from starting in the\r\nBaltic was acted upon by Sweden and Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Who knows not that the Emperor's attempt to get a seaport in\r\n     Pomerania weighed no less with the great Gustavus than any other\r\n     motive for carrying his arms even into the bowels of the house of\r\n     Austria? What befel, at the times of Charles Gustavus, the crown of\r\n     Poland itself, who, besides it being in those days by far the\r\n     mightiest of any of the northern Powers, had then a long stretch of\r\n     coast on, and some ports in, the Baltic? The Danes, though then in\r\n     alliance with Poland, would never allow them, even for their\r\n     assistance against the Swedes, to have a fleet in the Baltic, but\r\n     destroyed the Polish ships wherever they could meet them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the maintenance of the balance of power between the established\r\nmaritime States of the Baltic, the tradition of British policy is no\r\nless clear. \"When the Swedish power gave us some uneasiness there by\r\nthreatening to crush Denmark,\" the honour of our country was kept up by\r\nretrieving the then inequality of the balance of power.\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth of England sent in a squadron to the Baltic which\r\nbrought on the treaty of Roskild (1658), afterwards confirmed at\r\nCopenhagen (1660). The fire of straw kindled by the Danes in the times\r\nof King William III. was as speedily quenched by George Rock in the\r\ntreaty of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nSuch was the hereditary British policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"It never entered into the mind of the politicians of those times\r\n     in order to bring the scale again to rights, to find out the happy\r\n     _expedient of raising a third naval Power_ for framing a juster\r\n     balance in the Baltic.... Who has taken this counsel against Tyre,\r\n     the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers\r\n     are the honourables of the earth? _Ego autem neminem nomino, quare\r\n     irasci mihi nemo poterit, nisi qui ante de se noluerit confiteri._\r\n     Posterity will be under some difficulty to believe that this could\r\n     be the _work of any of the persons now in power_ ... that _we_ have\r\n     opened; _St. Petersburg to the Czar solely at our own expense, and\r\n     without any risk to him_....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe safest line of policy would be to return to the treaty of Itolbowa,\r\nand to suffer the Muscovite no longer \"to nestle in the Baltic.\" Yet,\r\nit may be said, that in \"the present state of affairs\" it would be\r\n\"difficult to retrieve the advantage we have lost by not curbing, when\r\nit was more easy, the growth of the Muscovite power.\" A middle course\r\nmay be thought more convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"If we should find it consistent with the welfare of our State that\r\n     the Muscovite have an inlet into the Baltic, as having, of all the\r\n     princes of Europe, a country that can be made most beneficial to\r\n     its prince, by uttering its produce to foreign markets. In this\r\n     case, it were but reasonable to expect, on the other hand, that in\r\n     return for our complying so far with his interest, for the\r\n     improvement of his country, his Czarish Majesty, on his part,\r\n     should demand nothing that may tend to the disturbance of another;\r\n     and, therefore, contenting himself with ships of trade, should\r\n     demand none of war.\"\r\n\r\n     \"We should thus preclude his hopes of being ever more than an\r\n     inland Power,\" but \"obviate every objection of using the Czar worse\r\n     than any Sovereign Prince may expect. I shall not for this give an\r\n     instance of a Republic of Genoa, or another in the Baltic itself,\r\n     of the Duke of Courland; but will assign Poland and Prussia, who,\r\n     though both now crowned heads, have ever contented themselves with\r\n     the freedom of an open traffic, without insisting on a fleet. Or\r\n     the treaty of Falczin, between the Turk and Muscovite, by which\r\n     Peter was forced not only to restore Asoph, and to part with all\r\n     his men-of-war in those parts, but also to content himself with the\r\n     bare freedom of traffic in the Black Sea. Even an inlet in the\r\n     Baltic for trade is much beyond what he could morally have promised\r\n     himself not yet so long ago on the issue of his war with Sweden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Czar refuse to agree to such \"a healing temperament,\" we shall\r\nhave \"nothing to regret but the time we lost to exert all the means that\r\nHeaven has made us master of, to reduce him to a peace advantageous to\r\nGreat Britain.\" War would become inevitable. In that case\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"it ought no less to animate our Ministry to pursue their present\r\n     measures, than fire with indignation the breast of every honest\r\n     Briton that a Czar of Muscovy, who owes his naval skill to our\r\n     instructions, and his grandeur to our forbearance, should so soon\r\n     deny to Great Britain the terms which so few years ago he was fain\r\n     to take up with from the Sublime Porte.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis every way our interest to have the Swede restored to those\r\n     provinces which the Muscovite has wrested from that crown in the\r\n     Baltic. _Great Britain can no longer hold the balance in that\r\n     sea_,\" since she \"_has raised the Muscovite to be a maritime Power\r\n     there_.... Had we performed the articles of our alliance made by\r\n     King William with the crown of Sweden, that gallant nation would\r\n     ever have been a bar strong enough against the Czar coming into the\r\n     Baltic.... Time must confirm us, that the Muscovite's _expulsion\r\n     from the Baltic_ is _now_ the principal end of our Ministry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nButler & Tanner.
