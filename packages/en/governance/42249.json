But some years since, my\r\nniece, the Comtesse Jean de Castellane, published the story of the\r\nearly years of the Duchesse de Dino, and as many readers desire to\r\nhave the continuation, I have decided not to withhold it any longer,\r\nand it will be found in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe book throws more light on the last years of the Prince de\r\nTalleyrand than any previous publication, and it speaks so well for\r\nitself that I need say nothing for it. The place which the Duchess\r\noccupied in the European Society of the first half of last century is\r\nalso too well known to need to be recalled here. Her personal charm,\r\nlike her intellectual distinction, has rarely been equalled, but the\r\nmoral fascination which she exercised on all who knew her is less well\r\nknown. Intellect is a great source of strength, but nobility of soul\r\nis a greater; and it was assuredly this which helped the Duchess in\r\nmany difficult passages in her history.\r\n\r\nIt is this sense of nobility and distinction which, in my opinion, is\r\nthe chief characteristic of her Memoirs.\r\n\r\n    CASTELLANE, PRINCESSE RADZIWILL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER I\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n   Paris, May 9--A crowded drawing-room--Eridge Castle--Trouble        1\r\n   in Paris--A Naval Spectacle.\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n   A Visit from the Duke of Wellington--Politics at Paris--The        12\r\n   King's Birthday--The Princess Victoria--European\r\n   complications.\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n   M.

There\r\nis such a babel of words, such a crowd of faces, that I hardly\r\nrecognise myself, and have the greatest difficulty in collecting my\r\nthoughts so as to discover where I am, where others are, whether the\r\ncountry is doing well or ill, whether the physicians are skilful\r\nenough, or whether the malady is beyond their art.\r\n\r\nTwenty times I have stopped to think of Madeira; sometimes, too, my\r\nthoughts are of Valençay; but I can find no fixed resting-place, and\r\nit seems to me quite futile to prejudge anything before the great\r\nelectoral crisis which preoccupies everybody. _A propos_ of\r\neverything, people here say \"after the elections,\" just as the gay\r\nworld of London used to say \"after Easter.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a little article in the _Moniteur_ of yesterday; the\r\nattitude of the Ministry and that of the general public are both just\r\nand flattering to M. de Talleyrand, but reason is not the fashion\r\nnowadays, and less so in this country than elsewhere. In fact, if I\r\nwere to let my thoughts wander over the thousand and one small\r\ncomplications which spoil and embarrass everything, the only\r\nconclusion I could arrive at would be that the country is very ill but\r\nthat the doctor is excellent!...\r\n\r\n_London, September 10, 1831._--From Paris letters it appears that the\r\nindestructible Bailli de Ferette has at length taken his departure;\r\nlikewise Madame Visconti, another extraordinary relic of the past.\r\n\r\nI hear there have been _émeutes_ of women; fifteen hundred of these\r\nhorrible creatures made a commotion, and because of their sex the\r\nGarde Nationale would not use force. Fortunately, the rain settled the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nYesterday came an express with a rigmarole about Belgium asking that\r\nthe Dutch should retire still further, that Maestricht should be\r\ngarrisoned by Dutch alone, expressing impatience at General Baudrand\r\nhaving had direct conversations in private with the English Ministers,\r\nand recalling him forthwith. He will not go, however, till after the\r\nDrawing-room.\r\n\r\nNothing new about Poland.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ tells of the ill-starred attempt in Portugal. A malison on\r\nDom Miguel! What a shame it is that he should have triumphed!\r\n\r\nThe only news in London is that on the occasion of the coronation,[1]\r\nthe King allowed the Bishops to lay aside their ugly wigs. This has\r\nmade them quite unrecognisable for the last week, for they were in\r\nsuch a hurry to avail themselves of the permission that they did not\r\nallow time for their hair to grow again. The result was that they cut\r\na very odd figure, and were the delight of all the guests at the\r\nKing's dinner.\r\n\r\n  [1] Of King William IV.\r\n\r\n_London, September 11, 1831._--Everybody is still talking of nothing\r\nbut the coronation; the Duke of Devonshire's return on foot all\r\nsplashed with mud; the acts, words, and appearance of everyone are\r\ndiscussed, embellished, distorted, and reviewed with more or less\r\ncharity: that is to say, with no charity at all. The Queen alone is\r\nleft untouched; everyone says that she was perfect, and they are quite\r\nright.\r\n\r\nI saw the Duke of Gloucester yesterday, and could get nothing out of\r\nhim except that they had been trying to avoid having Van de Weyer (who\r\nmakes the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar swoon) at the great diplomatic\r\ndinner to-day at Saint James's. They, therefore, hit on the plan of\r\nasking, besides ambassadors, only such ministers as are married; I\r\nthought this rather stupid.\r\n\r\nAll the venerable survivals are disappearing; there is Lady\r\nMornington, mother of the Duke of Wellington, who died yesterday at\r\nthe age of ninety. This event can make little difference to her son.\r\n\r\nThe Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg and the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen left\r\nyesterday by the steamer for Rotterdam; the Duchess of Cambridge\r\nleaves to-day for the Hague viâ Bruges. The great preoccupation of\r\nthem all is to avoid Brussels.\r\n\r\nLady Belfast describes very amusingly the visit of the English yachts\r\nto Cherbourg and the welcome they had there. They were received by the\r\nauthorities, who could not in the least understand what a Gentleman's\r\nYacht Club in which the Government had no concern could be; in fact,\r\nthey were near taking the members for pirates. However, they gave them\r\na dinner and a ball. Lord Yarborough wished to return their\r\nhospitality on board his yacht, but all the provincial fair ladies\r\ndeclared that nothing would induce them to dance on the sea, that they\r\nwould be certain to be horribly sick, and that the proposal was\r\naltogether barbarous. Finally, Lord Yarborough was obliged to yield,\r\nand gave his ball in a Cherbourg tavern, where, however, he managed to\r\nspend ten thousand francs in a single evening.\r\n\r\n_London, September 13, 1831._--Yesterday's Drawing-room was more\r\ncrowded than ever, and consequently so long and fatiguing that Mexico,\r\nSpain, and Naples were successively placed _hors de combat_. The\r\ndiplomatic ranks were so much thinned by these ladies fainting one\r\nafter the other that one had to exert oneself more than usual.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven boldly seated herself on the steps of the throne,\r\nwhence she passed into the King's room, where she had lunch. She came\r\nback and told us that she was neither tired nor hungry. She all but\r\nadded that our legs should be rested because hers were, and our\r\nstomachs satisfied because hers had been stayed.\r\n\r\nThe peeresses, as a rule, looked well in their robes. One unhappy\r\ncreature paid dearly for the pleasure of exercising her right as a\r\npeeress to be received by the King whether he will or no. Lady Ferrers\r\nhad been practically kept by her husband as his mistress before he\r\nmarried her, so Lord Howe told Lord Ferrers that the Queen would not\r\nreceive his wife. Lord Ferrers replied, however, that peeresses had\r\nthe _entrée_, and that could not be denied. He was warned, however,\r\nthat the Queen would turn away as Lady Ferrers passed, and this is\r\nwhat happened. I must observe that even in this the Queen showed her\r\nkindness of heart, for she pretended to begin a conversation with the\r\nPrincess Augusta just before Lady Ferrers came opposite to her. She\r\ndid not interrupt her conversation, and it was possible to think that\r\nthe poor woman had passed unperceived and not insulted. I thought it\r\nwas very nice of the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was magnificent, and the exuberance of the King's good\r\nhumour was really comic; he made several remarkable speeches in\r\nFrench, and I hear that, when the ladies had gone, the grossness of\r\nhis conversation was beyond belief. I have never seen him so gay. I\r\nthink that certain despatches from Paris which arrived a little before\r\ndinner, and brought to Lord Palmerston and M. de Talleyrand the news\r\nthat the French troops would begin the evacuation of Belgium on the\r\n27th and would all be back in France by the 30th, had something to do\r\nwith the Royal hilarity. Lord Grey was radiant about it.\r\n\r\nThe news of the cholera is bad; it has got to Sweden _viâ_ Finland,\r\nand at Berlin in three days thirty out of the sixty sick have died.\r\nThere has been enough ado about it in Paris for M. Perier to make his\r\nappearance there on horseback in his ministerial uniform; his presence\r\nhad a good effect.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Belgian business is definitely settled, and M. de\r\nTalleyrand was saying yesterday that he would be in France at the end\r\nof October. But I have already seen so many ups and downs in these\r\naffairs that I no longer profess to predict anything a week ahead.\r\n\r\n_Tunbridge Wells, September 16, 1831._--I have just been visiting\r\nEridge Castle,[2] which belongs to a rich and misanthropic\r\noctogenarian much persecuted by misfortune. His title is Earl of\r\nAbergavenny, but his family name is Neville. He is a cousin of Lord\r\nWarwick; the celebrated \"King maker\" was a Neville, and Eridge Castle\r\nwas his. At a later date Queen Elizabeth was feasted there.\r\n\r\n  [2] Eridge Castle is in the county of Sussex, and still belongs\r\n  to the Abergavenny family.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the castle are ancient, and it has been restored in\r\nthe ancient style, with great care, by the present owner. The effect\r\nof the whole is perfectly harmonious, and every detail is rich and\r\nelegant. The perfection of the carving and the beauty of the stained\r\nglass are wonderful. Lord Abergavenny's own apartments are extremely\r\ndismal. The castle occupies a very high point on the top of a hill,\r\nwith a lake twenty acres in extent at the foot. But the low ground is\r\nsurrounded by hills which are even higher than the one in the centre,\r\non which the castle stands, and which are all covered with trees so\r\nsplendid, so numerous, and stretching for so many miles, that they\r\nform a veritable forest. I have never seen a prospect so romantically\r\nwooded and at the same time so profoundly melancholy. It is not\r\nEnglish, still less is it French; it is the Black Forest, it is\r\nBohemia. I have never seen ivy like that which covers the towers, the\r\nbalconies, and indeed the whole building. In short, I rave about it.\r\n\r\nIn the park, in the heart of a clump of tall and very sombre\r\nfir-trees, there is a mineral spring exactly like that at Tunbridge;\r\nand the park itself is not only full of deer but has also stags, any\r\nnumber of cows and sheep, and a fine herd of buffaloes.\r\n\r\nLord Abergavenny is very charitable. A hundred and twenty workmen are\r\nconstantly in his employment; but since the visitors from Tunbridge\r\ncame and damaged his garden he allows no one to see either his park or\r\nhis house. Some time ago he refused admittance even to the Princesse\r\nde Lieven. Pleading notes from Countess Bathyány and from me touched\r\nhis heart. He was out when we came, but had left orders for the\r\nservants to show us everything; we were guided through the woods by a\r\nman on horseback. His people are very fond of him; they have much to\r\nsay of his goodness, and recount very impressively the story of the\r\nmisfortunes which have afflicted their unhappy old master.\r\n\r\n_London, September 17, 1831._--On my way back from Tunbridge yesterday\r\nI visited Knole, one of the most ancient castles in England, built by\r\nKing John. The oldest part of the existing building dates from this\r\ntime. Knole was for long in the possession of the Archbishops of\r\nCanterbury, but Cranmer, finding that his magnificence excited popular\r\ndiscontent, restored it to the Crown. Elizabeth gave it to the\r\nSackvilles, the eldest of whom she made Earl of Dorset; and it has\r\nremained in that family until the present day. It has just come into\r\nthe hands of Lady Plymouth, sister of the Duke of Dorset, who was\r\nkilled in the hunting-field, and left no children. The present Duke of\r\nDorset, an old man, is the uncle of his predecessor; he has inherited\r\nthe title without the estate.\r\n\r\nWhen I choose I can be as meticulous as anybody! I condescended to\r\nread up the guide-book, and put myself in the hands of the\r\nhousekeeper. This ancient fairy-godmother is very good at showing off\r\nthe venerable and lugubrious house of Knole, which for melancholy has\r\nno rival. Even the part which has been fitted up for the present\r\noccupants is no exception to this; much more profound, therefore, is\r\nthe gloom of that which is given up to memories of the past.\r\nEverything there is genuine antique; there are five or six bedrooms,\r\nthe hall, three galleries, and a saloon full of Jacobean furniture.\r\nPanelling, furniture, and pictures all date authentically from this\r\nperiod. The rooms occupied by James I. when he visited the first Earl\r\nof Dorset are magnificent; they are decorated with Venetian mirrors;\r\nthere is a state bed of gold and silver brocade, a filigree\r\ntoilet-set, ivory and ebony cabinets, and many other curious and\r\nbeautiful things. There are portraits here of all England, and among a\r\nvast quantity of rubbish some dozen splendid examples of Van Dyck and\r\nSir Robert Leslie. The park is large, but in no way remarkable; a\r\nrapid visit is quite sufficient.\r\n\r\n_London, September, 1831._--I am always unlucky in my return to\r\nLondon. I got back the day before yesterday, in time to learn of the\r\ncapture of Warsaw;[3] and to-day I arrived from Stoke[4] to hear of\r\nthe new and serious disorders which had taken place in Paris on the\r\noccasion of the defeat of the Poles. The condition of the city was\r\ngrave at the time of writing, from the details given in this morning's\r\n_Times_. I may add that M. Casimir Perier bravely saved Sébastiani\r\nfrom the gravest peril by taking him into his carriage. When they got\r\nto the Place Vendôme they were forced to take refuge in the Hôtel de\r\nl'État Major; there were loud cries of \"_à bas Louis-Philippe!_\"\r\n\r\n  [3] Warsaw, capital of the Duchy of the same name, had been ceded\r\n  to the Russians in 1815. In November 1830 a terrible insurrection\r\n  broke out there, which liberated Poland for several months; but,\r\n  in spite of a glorious campaign against Diebitsch, Warsaw was\r\n  finally retaken by Parkéwitch on September 8, 1831.\r\n\r\n  [4] Stoke is situate in the county of Stafford, and has a great\r\n  porcelain manufactory founded by Wedgwood.\r\n\r\nTo-day the fate of the Ministry will probably be decided in the\r\nChamber. I know that M. de Rigny was very anxious, the previous\r\nsitting having been very unfavourable.\r\n\r\nI have also received a very sad letter from M. Pasquin.\r\n\r\nOur forebodings are turning out only too true.\r\n\r\n_London, September 20, 1831._--Count Paul Medem arrived yesterday and\r\nspent much of the day with me.\r\n\r\nHe left Paris on Saturday evening. I had plenty of time to question\r\nhim, and found his judgment sound and cold as usual; he thinks that in\r\nFrance nothing as yet is either lost or saved. It is all, he thinks, a\r\nmatter of chance; and one can depend on nothing. He brings ill news of\r\nthe unpopularity of the King and of the ignorance and presumption of\r\neverybody. He thinks nothing of anyone but Casimir Perier, and even he\r\nmakes no secret of his disgust at the little help he gets. I had a sad\r\naccount of the social and commercial condition of Paris. Everything\r\nthere is unrecognisable; dress, manners, tone, morals and\r\nlanguage--all is changed. The men spend their whole lives in the\r\ncafés, and the women have vanished. New expressions have become the\r\nfashion. The Chamber of Deputies is termed _La Reine Législative_; the\r\nChamber of Peers, _L'Ancienne Chambre_. The latter, as a power in the\r\nland, has ceased to exist. It is said that the King was more ready\r\nthan anyone to abandon the hereditary principle in the peerage, hoping\r\nin this way to gain popularity and get a better civil list. No one\r\nsupposes, however, that it will exceed twelve millions, and in the\r\nmeantime he is drawing fifteen hundred thousand francs a month.\r\n\r\nSeveral theatres are closed; the Opera and the Italiens still draw,\r\nbut if the stars continue to appear on the stage it is only the seamy\r\nside of society that is seen in the boxes.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the Czar Nicolas will only put to death such\r\nPoles as murdered Russian prisoners in the course of the sanguinary\r\nscenes enacted at the clubs. Siberia will receive the others. What a\r\nhost of miserable creatures we shall see invading Europe, and more\r\nespecially France! It is natural to want to shelter them, but it must\r\nbe admitted that in the present state of France they can only be a new\r\nelement of disorder. They say that when an émeute occurs the refugees\r\nfrom all countries always play a leading part.\r\n\r\nThe news from Rio de Janeiro is bad for the children[5] left by Dom\r\nPedro. A revolt of the negroes has led to much disorder.\r\n\r\n  [5] (1) Doña Jennaria, born 1819; (2) Doña Paula, born 1823; (3)\r\n  Doña Francisca, born 1824; (4) Dom Pedro, born 1825, who in 1831\r\n  became Emperor of Brazil under a regency.\r\n\r\nThe scenes in Switzerland[6] are deplorable.\r\n\r\n  [6] On the occasion of the Revolution in France in 1830, new\r\n  agitations arose in Switzerland. Bâle divided itself in 1831 into\r\n  Bâle-Ville and Bâle-Campagne.\r\n\r\nThings have been happening at Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nMiaulis[7] has blown up his fleet rather than obey Capo d'Istria.\r\n\r\n  [7] Miaulis had retired to Paros, and had put himself at the head\r\n  of the rebellious Hydriotes.\r\n\r\n_London, September 21, 1831._[8]--The rioting began again in Paris on\r\nSunday evening, and lasted all Monday morning. There were ominous\r\nsymptoms of all kinds, and the aspect of the city was very serious.\r\nThe interpellations announced by Mauguin and Laurence were postponed\r\nfor twenty-four hours, because it was thought that a partial, if not a\r\ncomplete, dislocation of the Ministry was imminent. Heavenly powers!\r\nWhere have we got to and whither are we tending!\r\n\r\n  [8] From March to September 1831 insurrection, or at least\r\n  agitation and tumult, was almost continual in the streets of\r\n  Paris.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is confidently asserted that the troops at\r\nMadeira are ready to submit to Doña Maria. The name of Madeira\r\npronounced (thrown out one might say) six months ago without much\r\nthought will turn out to have been prophetic. It is there that we will\r\nbetake ourselves for refuge!\r\n\r\nJules Chodron[9] is appointed Second Secretary of Legation at\r\nBrussels.\r\n\r\n  [9] M. de Courcel.\r\n\r\n_London, September 23, 1831._--There was a splendid day yesterday for\r\nthe ceremony at Woolwich at which I was present. It was very\r\nimpressive to see the launch of a great ship of war, and to see it\r\ntowed afterwards into the dock where it is to be rigged.\r\n\r\nWe were on a platform near the King's; there were crowds and crowds of\r\npeople, a multitude of steamers and rowing boats, bands, bells and\r\nsalvoes of cannon without end. It was almost sunshine. The uniforms\r\nand dresses were brilliant; in fact, there was everything which\r\ncontributes to produce an air of high festivity.\r\n\r\nThe King took a small detachment of the diplomatic corps, which I\r\naccompanied, to see a miniature frigate, a present to the King of\r\nPrussia. It is a charming little thing made entirely of copper and\r\nmahogany. Then he took us to lunch on board the _Royal Sovereign_, an\r\nold yacht of the time of George III., much gilded and bedizened. His\r\nMajesty addressed himself to me in drinking the health of the King of\r\nthe French, and to Bülow in proposing the toast of His Prussian\r\nMajesty. He forgot Madame Falk, on which the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar,\r\nwho was much annoyed, could not refrain from tears, and the King had\r\nto apologise to Madame Falk, and drink the health of the King of\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nI dined with the Duke of Wellington, who was in very good spirits. He\r\nhopes that the Reform Bill will be thrown out by the House of Lords on\r\nthe Second Reading, which will take place on October 3. Lord\r\nWinchelsea, having declared that he would vote against it, was\r\nrequested by the Ministry to resign his place at Court, but the King\r\nwould not accept his resignation.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening came an express from Paris, dated the 20th,\r\nannouncing that the riots are at an end, and that the Ministry has\r\nprevailed in the Chamber of Deputies; but, on the other hand, it is\r\nsaid that what has been passed proves that the Belgian treaty must be\r\non the basis proposed in the despatch of the 12th.\r\n\r\n_London, September 25, 1831._--We have got the details of the sitting\r\nof the Chamber at which the Ministry triumphed. The victory was won on\r\nan order of the day; worded in a manner honourable to the Government,\r\nand carried by a majority of 85. There voted 357--221 for M. Perier,\r\n136 against. Things, therefore, have for the moment resumed some sort\r\nof equilibrium, but I have little confidence in the event. The new\r\nChamber has still to show what it means to do about hereditary\r\npeerages, about the civil list and the budget, and it does not seem to\r\nme to be prepared either to say or to do any good thing.\r\n\r\nPeople are still writing to me praising the high courage of M. Perier,\r\nand representing the country as being in a critical condition, and\r\nPozzo as very nervous in spite of his nephew's marriage, with which he\r\nis delighted.\r\n\r\nThree gentlemen from Arras, introduced by the Baron de Talleyrand,\r\nhave been dining with us. They belong to the French middle class, and\r\nare very proud of the fact. One of the three was a little man of\r\nseventeen in the rhetoric class of the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, who is\r\nhere for his holidays, and is already as talkative and as positive as\r\ncould be wished. He gives every promise of one day bellowing most\r\nconspicuously in the Chamber.\r\n\r\n_London, September 27, 1831._--Yesterday the Conference agreed on a\r\nprotocol, and heaven knows what will be the result! The Dutch and the\r\nBelgians could not come to any agreement, or even within sight of one.\r\nSo the Conference, in order to prevent the resumption of hostilities\r\nto settle finally this difficult, delicate and dangerous question, and\r\nto avert the conflagration which is always imminent, constituted\r\nitself arbitrator, and will protect the results of its arbitration\r\nwhich is to proceed forthwith. How will this be received at Paris? M.\r\nde Talleyrand thinks they will be annoyed at first and will then give\r\nway, especially as there was nothing else to be done. \"It is,\" he\r\nsays, \"the one and only way of settling the business.\"\r\n\r\n_London, September 29, 1831._--M. de Montrond came yesterday. He\r\nspeaks with the utmost contempt of Paris, and all that is going on\r\nthere. He tells me that the King is going to live at the Tuilleries,\r\nafter a severe battle with his ministers, who on this occasion also\r\nhave forced his hand. They had a hard task to overcome the Queen's\r\nunwillingness, but they have overcome all obstacles and the thing is\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nIt is said that at the Palais Royal the King cannot stir without being\r\ngreeted with the most cruel epithets. He is received with cries of\r\n\"_Bavard!_\" \"_Avare!_\" &c. They thrust knives through the inside\r\nrailings and threaten him. The situation, in short, is horrible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1832\r\n\r\n\r\n_London, May 23, 1832._--The Duke of Wellington paid me a long visit\r\nyesterday. He told me that he was sorry that M. de Talleyrand's\r\npersonal circumstances had led him to decide to leave England even for\r\na time. No substitute, however excellent, could maintain things at the\r\npoint to which M. de Talleyrand had brought them. He had the leading\r\nposition here and a preponderating influence not merely among his\r\nfellow diplomats, but also among his English colleagues. He was,\r\nmoreover, highly respected throughout the country, where the fact that\r\nhe stood aloof from all intrigue was much appreciated. He was the only\r\nman who, \"under any ministry,\" was capable of preserving the\r\nsolidarity of England and France. He himself feared that the other\r\nmembers of the Conference might take a high tone with M. de\r\nTalleyrand's substitute, and when he came back he might find a new\r\nsituation and ground lost which it might be difficult to recover.\r\nFinally, if M. de Talleyrand did not return to London, we could not\r\neven be certain that peace would be preserved.\r\n\r\nHe added that the aspect of things in both countries was very grave,\r\nthat all the provision which had been made was inadequate, and that no\r\none could predict the result either of Reform or of the revolutionary\r\nmeans which had been taken to obtain it. Who again could say what the\r\nRoyal caprice might bring forth once the Reform Bill was passed?\r\n\r\nThe Duke was, as always, very simple and natural, full of common\r\nsense, and, in his way, which is certainly not gushing, very friendly.\r\n\r\n_London, May 24, 1832._--M. de Rémusat is here with a letter from\r\nGeneral Sébastiani to M. de Talleyrand which he has not yet delivered.\r\nHe sent me one from the Duc de Broglie, written on the point of his\r\nleaving for the country, and, as I think, in much anxiety about the\r\nprecarious condition of everything in France. He refers me to M. de\r\nRémusat, but I know only too well what he will say. He is clever, but\r\nit is a scornful type of cleverness. He is a captious person hide\r\nbound in his doctrinaire formulas; even when I used to see a great\r\ndeal of his set I used to think him particularly disagreeable, and I\r\ndon't expect that he will do or say anything to make me change my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n_London, May 25, 1832._--M. de Rémusat, whom I saw last night,\r\nannounced that he would call this morning, when he would \"tell me what\r\nto think of Paris.\" These doctrinaires always want to teach one\r\nsomething! He has just gone. It takes a long time to learn about\r\nFrance; he has been teaching me for more than two hours!\r\n\r\nWhat I chiefly remember of my lesson is that M. de Rémusat's journey\r\nis a kind of mission entrusted to him by the worthy persons who favour\r\na _via media_, such as MM. Royer-Collard, Guizot, Broglie, Bertin de\r\nVeaux, and even Sébastiani who is at open war with Rigny. The object\r\nof the mission is to persuade M. de Talleyrand to accept the\r\nPresidency of the Council, or, if that cannot be, to be the patron of\r\na new ministry in which Sébastiani would keep his place, and which\r\nwould be strengthened by the accession of Guizot, Thiers and Dupin.\r\nThe Ministry in its present dilapidated and distracted condition\r\ncannot last, but the King must be made to choose stronger men, who\r\nwill resolutely carry out M. Perier's system, and who have enough\r\ntalent to impose it on the Chamber. They want M. de Talleyrand to go\r\nto Paris and make the King feel the danger of his position so keenly\r\nthat he will be willing to take this course. This is what M. de\r\nRémusat has been sent to propose to M. de Talleyrand, and what he took\r\nthe trouble to give me a lecture about. M. de Talleyrand is too much\r\ndetermined not to take part in any administration to give way on this\r\npoint. He has, of course, always meant to speak to the King as his\r\nconscience prompts him. But what will he gain by that? Probably very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n_London, May 29, 1832._--What a day we had yesterday! The Drawing-room\r\nwent on till past five! It was the King's birthday, and His Majesty\r\nhaving learned that the Princesse de Lieven and I were not dining with\r\nLord Palmerston, chose us to represent the Corps Diplomatique at his\r\nown party.\r\n\r\nThere was no one at this dinner, apart from the legitimate and the\r\nillegitimate family, besides the suite and a few old friends of the\r\nKing, such as the Duke of Dorset and Lord Mount Edgcumbe.\r\n\r\nThe King did not stint his toasts. First he addressed himself to\r\nMadame de Lieven, and said that after the many years that she had\r\nrepresented in London a Court always friendly to Great Britain, he had\r\ncome to regard her as a personal friend. Then to me, \"I have not known\r\nyou for so long, Madame, but the memory which you leave behind you\r\nmakes us all wish for your return with the restored health which you\r\ngo to seek at the waters. The delicate and difficult circumstances of\r\nyour uncle's mission here, in which he has displayed so much integrity\r\nand skill, are such that I attach great importance to his returning\r\namong us, and I beg you tell him so.\" Then he turned to Madame\r\nWoronzoff and told her how, through her husband, she was as much\r\nEnglish as Russian.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven thanked His Majesty in a word and so did I, but poor\r\nMadame de Woronzoff in trying to express her sentiments got so mixed\r\nthat the King began again, and I thought that the dialogue would never\r\nend.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen's health had been drunk, the King returned thanks for\r\nher in English, adding that no princess more deserved the respect and\r\naffection of those that knew her, for no one better discharged the\r\nduties of her position than she. He then gave us the signal to rise\r\nand immediately afterwards to sit down again, and, addressing the\r\nDuchess of Kent, he drank the health of the Princess Victoria as his\r\nsole heir under Providence and according to the law of the land. To\r\nher he hoped to leave the three kingdoms with their rights, privileges\r\nand constitution intact as he himself had received them. With all this\r\nhe said, and frequently repeated, that his health was excellent and\r\nhis strength abundant, that he had no idea of dying, and that in these\r\ndifficult times it was most necessary that there should not be a\r\nminority. So that everybody fell to wondering whether he meant to be\r\nagreeable or disagreeable to the Duchess of Kent, who was as pale as\r\ndeath, or whether, owing to the princely pretensions of the\r\nFitzclarences, he wished to make it clear that he recognised no other\r\nheir than the young princess as possible. Others assert that it was\r\nall aimed at the Duke of Sussex, who was absent because he has been\r\nforbidden to come to Court. It appears that the popular party would\r\nlike to see him on the throne, or, at least, that the King imagines\r\nthat they would, and that this was the motive of his very lengthy\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the evening the King twice came up to me to say that\r\nM. de Talleyrand must not be away long, that the peace of the world\r\ndepended on his presence in London, and so on, with many eulogistic\r\nand pretty speeches. The number of polite regrets, sincere enough to\r\nall appearance, which are being expressed at our departure is really\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\n_London, May 30, 1832._--M. de Talleyrand has received letters from\r\nthe King and from Sébastiani, written on the eve of leaving for\r\nCompiègne. Both say that they will use all their credit with King\r\nLeopold to persuade him to leave everything to the Conference, and so\r\nto throw on the Dutch all the odium of a refusal. They wish M. de\r\nTalleyrand, however, to secure here the evacuation of Antwerp of which\r\nthe Dutch won't hear till all the other questions are settled. So far\r\nas one can see, the obstinacy of the Dutch does not diminish, and a\r\nbad spirit is again abroad in Belgium.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand will leave immediately after the arrival of M. de\r\nMareuil, and hopes before that to have succeeded in establishing an\r\narmed force which would be called the combined Anglo-French army, and\r\nwould be entrusted with the duty of cutting the Gordian knot.\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 20, 1832._--I expect M. de Talleyrand on the evening of\r\nthe day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI am seeing a great many people just now; in fact they are boring me\r\nto death. What absurdities, what mistakes, what misguided passions!\r\nPoor M. de Talleyrand; he is going to fall into a pretty mess of\r\nintrigue!\r\n\r\nThe present state of affairs, which is condemned by everybody, must\r\nnecessarily change, at least so far as the Ministry is concerned. The\r\noutcry against ministers is general, and alarm is growing. La Vendée,\r\nhowever, is about over, and people believe that the Duchesse de Berry\r\nhas fled; that, if true, is a great thing. But the state of the\r\nCabinet is pitiable. Its jerky, hesitating conduct of affairs, no less\r\nthan the innumerable blunders which it makes, foreshadow its downfall.\r\nM. de Talleyrand is expected to do great things, poor man!\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty lies in the character of the head of affairs. How\r\nugly all this is! Sébastiani is day by day failing more; yesterday I\r\nwas really grieved about him; he is quite aware of his condition, and\r\nit makes him very unhappy. To-night I am going with him to Saint\r\nCloud, and I tremble lest he may fall dead by my side in the carriage.\r\n\r\nWessenberg writes to me from London that the Ministry there is cast\r\ndown, anxious and embarrassed by its triumph, and fears that it may\r\nsoon fall. I see that in England they are disquieted about the state\r\nof Germany. Here the Corps Diplomatique are complaining of\r\nSébastiani's double game in respect of events on the Rhine. In a word,\r\nno one is pleased, no one is at ease. We live in strange times!\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 6, 1832._--M. de Talleyrand has letters which say\r\nthat the coquetry at St. Petersburg was intended to detach England\r\nfrom her alliance with us, and that they had even gone so far as to\r\npropose to place Antwerp in the hands of the English. All this has\r\nmiscarried and coldness has succeeded to civilities. All the\r\ndifficulties about the Conference now come from Brussels, where the\r\nmarriage[10] has turned everybody's head, and where they now think\r\nthemselves able to force France's hand.\r\n\r\n  [10] Leopold I., elected King of the Belgians in 1831, married in\r\n  1832 Louise, Princess of Orléans, daughter of Louis-Philippe,\r\n  King of the French.\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 21, 1832._--It seems that M. de Montrond hopes to\r\nget Pondichery, and is very anxious to go there. Sébastiani's friends\r\nsay he is quite restored to health since Bourbonne, and is steering\r\nadroitly among the difficulties of his ministerial career.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Netherlands is in an evil mood, and the King of the\r\nBelgians is no better. The Conference is flagging, and, they say, has\r\nmuch need of M. de Talleyrand to help it to recover its cohesion.\r\n\r\nAll the Cabinets are said to be much on edge about what is passing\r\nbetween Egypt and the Porte. Every one shrinks from the consequences\r\nwhich are imminent in the North, South, East and West. They are\r\nclearly foreseen everywhere, but no one has the courage to meddle with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 23, 1832._--The horizon is gloomy all round. Strange\r\nevents are happening in the East. The condition of Germany and Italy\r\nis precarious. The French Cabinet is disunited, there are\r\ncomplications in Portugal, and Holland is growing more and more\r\nobstinate. To all this must now be added the sudden death of Ferdinand\r\nVII., a civil war of succession between the partisans of Don Carlos\r\nand those of the little Infanta, the possibility of Spain interfering\r\nin Portugal, and consequently the appearance of France and England in\r\nthe Peninsula.\r\n\r\nFurther, there is the change of ministry at Brussels, and the sudden\r\ndepartures of the Duc d'Orléans, Marshal Gérard, and M. le Hon for\r\nBelgium. Pandemonium reigns more than ever!\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand is receiving many letters both from London and from\r\nParis urging him to hasten his departure.\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 27, 1832._--The resurrection[11] of Ferdinand VII.\r\nis very mysterious. It is also very fortunate, for when there are so\r\nmany complications, the disappearance of even one is something to be\r\nthankful for!\r\n\r\n  [11] In 1832 King Ferdinand VII. became so seriously ill that he\r\n  was thought to be dead. Calomarde then joined the Carlists, and\r\n  forced the dying monarch to sign a decree cancelling the\r\n  declaration of 1830 abolishing the Salic Law in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1833\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay,[12] October 12, 1833._--M. Royer-Collard passed part of the\r\nmorning here. He was at once original and witty, serious and\r\nvivacious, showed much affection for me, and made himself very\r\npleasant to M. de Talleyrand. He does not openly carp at the present\r\nsituation, but it is not pleasing to him, and he speaks ill of it in\r\nhis solitude.\r\n\r\n  [12] Valençay, where the Duchesse de Dino had just gone, is\r\n  situate in the Department of the Indre. The château and the park\r\n  are magnificent, and the ornamental water is very fine. The house\r\n  was built in the sixteenth century by the d'Étampes family, from\r\n  the designs of Philibert Delorme. In 1808 and 1814 it served as\r\n  the prison of Ferdinand VII. and the Spanish Princes when they\r\n  were detained by Napoleon I. The Prince de Talleyrand, who had\r\n  bought the property at the end of the eighteenth century, was\r\n  very fond of the place and lived there a great deal.\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Aulaire writes from Vienna: \"My summer holiday which I\r\nhave been spending at Baden has not been disturbed by the meetings at\r\nTéplitz and Münchengraetz,[13] because I was not given anything to do,\r\nand because, for my part, I feel no anxiety about them. But M. de\r\nMetternich has just got back to Vienna; we must put our affairs in\r\norder, and my holiday is near an end. The measures considered\r\nadvisable for Germany are apparently very sharp; were they otherwise\r\nthe attempt would be futile. Will France be content to look on and do\r\nnothing? I think so, unless some independent sovereign cries for help\r\nin maintaining his independence. The King of Hanover would be a good\r\nleader in a movement of this kind, but if he will not come forward, I\r\nhave no confidence in Prince Lichtenstein. I know that in England they\r\nthink M. de Metternich has tricked us, and that he went shares with\r\nRussia in the Treaty of Constantinople of the 8th of July last. But I\r\npersist in maintaining that he was the dupe, not the accomplice. I\r\nhope I am right, not so much for my own self-satisfaction as because\r\nthe game to play must vary according as the good understanding of\r\nAustria and Russia is apparent or real. Frederick Lamb told me\r\nyesterday in detail of the Duke of Leuchtenberg's campaign in Belgium.\r\nI had heard something of it from the rumours of the town, but not a\r\nword from the Cabinet, which has the bad habit of keeping us the worst\r\ninformed of the diplomatists of any country.\"\r\n\r\n  [13] The three great allied powers--Austria, Prussia and\r\n  Russia--held meetings in three successive years either at Téplitz\r\n  or at Münchengraetz for joint deliberation on the European\r\n  situation. There by a new secret compact they guaranteed to each\r\n  other their respective possessions in Poland, whether against\r\n  external aggression or internal revolution. They also considered\r\n  the affairs of France and Italy, and the constant activities of\r\n  Italian societies and refugees in French territory, which were\r\n  then causing serious anxiety about the tranquillity of the\r\n  Peninsula. It was finally decided that the Cabinets of Austria,\r\n  Prussia and Russia should each send a separate note to the\r\n  Government of King Louis-Philippe, urging a more careful\r\n  surveillance of the revolutionary propaganda.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 23, 1833._--The Duchesse de Montmorency is quite\r\nfresh on the subject of Prague, her eldest daughter having told her\r\nmuch about it. Charles X. himself took his two grand-children to their\r\nmother at Leoben with the precise object of preventing the Duchesse de\r\nBerry from coming to Prague; from Leoben it is said she will return to\r\nItaly. M. le Dauphin[14] and Mme. la Dauphine refused to go.\r\n\r\n  [14] Louis-Antoine, Duc d'Angoulême (1773-1844), eldest son of\r\n  King Charles X., married during the emigration in 1799 his cousin\r\n  Marie Thérèse Charlotte, daughter of King Louis XVI. and Queen\r\n  Marie Antoinette, but had no children. After 1830 the Duc\r\n  d'Angoulême ceded his rights to his nephew, the Duc de Bordeaux\r\n  (Comte de Chambord), and retired into private life.\r\n\r\nThey say that Charles X. is much broken, and the Dauphine is aged and\r\nvery thin and nervous, always in tears. Certainly, however strong her\r\ncharacter may be, her misfortunes have been such as to break the\r\nhighest courage and the most masculine spirit. Beyond doubt she has\r\nbeen more persecuted by destiny than any character in history.\r\n\r\nM. de Blacas is in supreme command of the little Court, and is more\r\nopposed than any one to the proposal that the Duchesse de Berry should\r\nsettle there.\r\n\r\nI have seen a letter from M. Thiers, who says, referring to his\r\nmarriage: \"The great moment is at hand. I am agitated, as is proper;\r\nand I am fonder of my young wife than is fitting at my age. This shows\r\nI was right to make up my mind at thirty-five rather than at forty,\r\nfor then I should have been even more absurd. In any case it matters\r\nlittle; I can banish false shame, but there _is_ one thing which I\r\nfind insupportable, and that is to expose those who are dear to me to\r\nthe insults and the malice of the world. For myself I am inured, but\r\n(great as is the necessity) I shall never become inured to the\r\nsufferings of those I love. The world must work its will; it would be\r\nfoolish to wish that so huge a machine should alter its eternal motion\r\nto suit one's convenience.\"\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that his philosophy will not be tried too severely;\r\nbut, as the proverb has it, \"the sin brings its own punishment.\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 3, 1833._--I am greatly surprised that the Duc de\r\nBroglie has not once written to M. de Talleyrand. He has written three\r\ntimes to me on private affairs, and each time promised a letter for M.\r\nde Talleyrand, which has never come.\r\n\r\nMme. Adélaïde has written twice, very kindly expressing her desire\r\nthat M. de Talleyrand may go back to London, but without any definite\r\ninquiry on the subject. I think, however, that she and the King wish\r\nit much more than the Duc de Broglie does; and I believe that it is\r\nowing to some intrigue between Lord Granville and Lord Palmerston that\r\nthe King's wishes have not so far been more clearly expressed.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand has come to no decision. There are so many real\r\ninconveniences in entering on active political life. On the other\r\nhand, there are so many real inconveniences in staying in France that\r\neven if I wished to advise I do not know what advice it would be best,\r\nin the interests of M. de Talleyrand, to give him. He fears--and I\r\nthink with reason--the isolation, the _ennui_ of the provinces, and\r\nthe slackness of country life. Paris he thinks impossible, as he\r\nwould there be invested in the eyes of the people with political\r\nresponsibilities which it would not be either in his interest or in\r\nhis power to discharge. On the other hand, he is under no illusions as\r\nto the gravity and the difficulty of the situation which he would find\r\non his return to London, and which would be aggravated by the\r\ncharacter of the people with whom he would have to deal on both sides\r\nof the Channel. Finally, he knows quite well how easily he might lose,\r\non the turn of a single card, all that he has so miraculously gained\r\nduring the past three years.\r\n\r\nAll this agitates him greatly; and me, on his account, even more. We\r\nhave every reason to apply to ourselves what M. Royer-Collard said in\r\n1830 of the struggle between the Polignac Ministry and the country:\r\n\"An end there will surely be, but I see no issue.\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 10, 1833._--M. de Talleyrand has just heard from\r\nthe Duc de Broglie and from King Leopold. The former says that the\r\nKing of the Netherlands is making overtures at Frankfort, that the\r\nGermanic Confederation and the Duke of Nassau are on the point of\r\ngiving way, and that in less than a fortnight Dedel will receive\r\ninstructions to resume active participation in the Conference. The\r\nDuke, and the King also, are most anxious that M. de Talleyrand should\r\ncome to Paris to settle everything, hear the details of the Conference\r\nat Münchengraetz on the affairs of Spain, and then return to London.\r\n\r\nKing Leopold writes to say that Belgium will pay Holland nothing; this\r\nquasi-manifesto being enveloped in a mass of honeyed compliments.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 11, 1833._--The following is the general sense of\r\nM. de Talleyrand's answer to the Duc de Broglie: \"My dear Duke,--You\r\noverrate the goodness of my health, but you will never overrate the\r\nwarmth of my friendship for you or of my devotion to the King. I\r\ncannot give you a better proof of this than by dragging my eighty-two\r\nyears out of their idleness and retirement in midwinter and getting to\r\nParis by December 4, as I promise you I shall. As to going to London,\r\nis it really necessary? I am very old, and another would now do as\r\nwell, perhaps better, than I.\r\n\r\n\"We shall discuss matters at Paris, and out of my 'long experience,'\r\nwhich you are so good as to consult, I will tell you frankly what I\r\nthink of all you have to tell me of political affairs. That is all I\r\nam good for nowadays. If by any chance you so far flatter my vanity as\r\nto make me believe that I am still indispensable for a time in this\r\nbusiness, I shall, of course, feel it my duty to do what you ask. But\r\nonce it is over I shall at once return to my den to resume the torpor\r\nwhich is alone appropriate to my present condition.\r\n\r\n\"In any case, no harm will be done by leaving things for a week or two\r\nin the hands of M. de Bacourt, who, I am sure, is justifying more and\r\nmore, by his energy and sagacity, all the good that I have said to you\r\nof him. Adieu!\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 12, 1833._--People are beginning to be anxious\r\nabout the situation in Spain. The Northern provinces are all for Don\r\nCarlos. Madrid, Barcelona, Cadiz, and almost all the South are for the\r\nQueen, on condition that the revolution takes its course. This is what\r\nis chiefly agitating the French Government.\r\n\r\nThe anticipation of the attitude of the Chambers is making the\r\nMinistry rather nervous. It will present itself just as it is, but not\r\nwithout fear, for there is a certain difficulty in facing a Chamber\r\nwhich must wish to court popularity if it hopes to be re-elected. The\r\nhuge expenditure of Marshal Soult, the very slight reduction (in some\r\ncases none at all) in other Departments, are difficulties which may\r\nbecome serious embarrassments.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 9, 1833._--Our return to London is settled. When I\r\narrived here yesterday I found M. de Montrond on the steps, M. Raullin\r\non the stairs, and Pozzo in the cabinet. I am to dine with him\r\nto-morrow. He has a careworn look, and fulminates against Lord\r\nPalmerston, who is said to be out of favour everywhere. M. de\r\nTalleyrand does not think that the Duc de Broglie lets himself be\r\ncarried away by Lord Granville as much as his Lordship would like,\r\nand he has expressed himself in clear terms about this.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand does not believe in the possibility of war except\r\nbetween England and Russia, and will make every effort in his power to\r\nprevent it. He seems to me on the best possible terms with Pozzo, and\r\nto stand extremely well with the King and Madame Adélaïde, who are\r\nbeginning to distrust Palmerston and Lord Granville and to consider\r\nthat Broglie is wanting in insight; and, moreover, that he treats them\r\nwithout sufficient consideration and respect. He is certainly behaving\r\nwith great lack of frankness and confidence towards M. de Talleyrand,\r\nbut one's financial position must be revealed to those who are to\r\ninvest one's money.\r\n\r\nLady Jersey has been to the Tuileries; the Duc d'Orléans has been in\r\nall things her humble servant. At the palace, indeed, where they are\r\nrather badly off for society, everyone was charmed by the arrival of\r\nthe fair aristocrat from the other side of the Channel, which has been\r\nquite an event.\r\n\r\nThe Faubourg Saint-Germain is more irreconcilable than ever. Napoleon\r\nhad places which he could bestow, estates which he might restore: he\r\ncould threaten confiscations. There is nothing of that sort nowadays;\r\nand so they all sulk with an easy insolence which is quite\r\nindescribable. The fact is that if one is not compelled to go there\r\nthe Court is too mixed to be attractive. I am sorry about it for the\r\nsake of the Queen, whom I both love and honour.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Baron de Werther is much annoyed with Palmerston and the\r\nDuc de Broglie. Certainly there is a great deal of ill-humour in the\r\nair, but M. de Talleyrand still says that it will not find its outlet\r\nin shot and shell.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 11, 1833._--Yesterday I dined, along with M. de\r\nTalleyrand, at the Thiers'. There was no one but himself, his wife,\r\nhis father and mother-in-law; Mignet, who talked platitudes about\r\nSpain, and Bertin de Veaux, who talked of nothing but the bull-fights\r\nhe saw at Saint Sebastian.\r\n\r\nMadame Thiers, who is only sixteen, looks nineteen. She has a fine\r\ncolour, pretty hair, a good shape, large eyes which have as yet\r\nnothing to express, a disagreeable mouth, an unpleasing smile, and a\r\ntoo prominent forehead. She says nothing herself, hardly answers when\r\nshe is spoken to, and she seemed thoroughly bored with us all. She has\r\nno presence, and no idea of how to behave in society, but no doubt she\r\nmay acquire all this. Perhaps she will take only too much trouble for\r\nother people than her little husband, who is very much in love and\r\nvery jealous--ashamed of it too, I gather, from what he told me. The\r\nlooks his young wife bestows on him are very cold; she is not shy, but\r\ninclined to be sulky, and not at all inclined to make herself\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nI used to think Madame Dosne had the remains of beauty, but I thought\r\non this occasion that she never could have been good looking. She has\r\nan unpleasing laugh, which is ironical without being gay. Her\r\nconversation is witty and animated, but her dress was pink and\r\ngirlish, and affectedly simple to a degree which quite astonished me.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 15, 1833._--Yesterday I dined with the King. M. de\r\nTalleyrand was dining with the Prince Royal. During dinner the King\r\nspoke of nothing but traditions and memories of the past and ancient\r\ncastles. I was quite at home. First we exhausted the topic of\r\nTouraine: he promised stained glass and portraits of Louis XI. and\r\nLouis XII. for Amboise. He will buy back the remains of Montrichard,\r\nand will prevent the ruin of the Château de Langeais. If he does all\r\nthis my dinner will not have been in vain! He then told me about the\r\nrestorations he is having done at Fontainbleau, and ended by\r\nexplaining to me his great plan for Versailles, which is really great\r\nand worthy of a great-grandson of Louis XIV. But will it come to pass?\r\nThe conversation then turned on the new work which he has had done at\r\nthe Tuileries themselves. He gave orders for the whole palace to be\r\nlit up, and after dinner he took me all through it.\r\n\r\nEverything is really fine, very fine; and if the staircase, which is\r\nrich and elegant, were only a little broader, it would be quite\r\nperfect. This promenade took us from the Pavillon de Flore to the\r\nPavillon de Marsan. Here the King asked me if I would like to pay a\r\nvisit to his son, and I said, of course, that I would follow the King\r\nanywhere. We found the Duc d'Orléans playing whist with M. de\r\nTalleyrand, whose friends the Prince had invited to meet him.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's apartments are too beautifully furnished for a man's;\r\nthat is the only criticism one can make, for they are full of lovely\r\nthings found in the Royal garde-meuble, where all the fine pieces of\r\nthe time of Louis XIV. were placed at the Revolution, and it did not\r\noccur to anyone at the time of the Restoration to take them out. The\r\nDuc d'Orléans has put a great many of them in his rooms. It is curious\r\nhow often I have been at the Tuileries without ever suspecting the\r\npresence of the interesting things collected there. Thus, on this\r\noccasion in the King's room, among other things with which I was\r\nunfamiliar, I saw a portrait of Louis XIV. as a baby represented as a\r\nsleeping Cupid, and another of Anne of Austria as Minerva. I also saw\r\nsome allegorical wood-carving of the time of Catherine de Medici, who\r\nbuilt the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe King is an admirable guide to his palaces. I wondered during all\r\nour conversation how a man could know the traditions of his family so\r\nwell and be so proud of them, and yet----. However!\r\n\r\nI leave the day after to-morrow for London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1834\r\n\r\n\r\n_London, January 27, 1834._--Sir Henry Halford has just been telling\r\nme that the late King George IV., whose senior physician he was, asked\r\nhim two days before his death to say on his word of honour whether the\r\ncase was desperate. Sir Henry, with a significantly grave face,\r\nanswered that his Majesty's condition was very serious; whereupon the\r\nKing thanked him with a movement of his head, desired the Sacrament\r\nand communicated very devoutly, inviting Sir Henry to communicate\r\nalong with him. Lady Conyngham was in the adjoining room. So no human\r\ninterest was absent from the deathbed of the Royal charlatan while he\r\npartook of the Sacrament for the last time.\r\n\r\n_London, February 7, 1834._--Yesterday I was at Lady Holland's, who\r\nfinished some story or other which she was telling me by saying, \"I\r\ndidn't get this from Lady Keith (Mme. de Flahaut), for she hasn't\r\nwritten to me for more than two months.\" Then she added, \"Did you know\r\nthat she hated the present Ministry in France?\" \"Of course,\" I\r\nanswered; \"it was you who told M. de Talleyrand all the nasty things\r\nshe was saying here about the French Cabinet at the time when it was\r\nformed.\" \"True,\" replied Lady Holland, \"all the same, the Cabinet must\r\nbe preserved. Lord Granville has written to Lord Holland to say that\r\nwe must not believe everything Lady Keith says about the\r\nprecariousness of the Duc de Broglie's position, for she is a bitter\r\nenemy of his and longs for his downfall.\" I said nothing, and the\r\nsubject dropped. But, after this, don't speak to me of the friendships\r\nof this world!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, they write rather amusingly of M. and Mme. de Flahaut from\r\nParis, saying that their favour at the Tuileries is declining, he\r\nbeing considered a superannuated coquette, and she a foxy old\r\nintriguer.\r\n\r\n_Warwick Castle, February 10, 1834._--I left London the day before\r\nyesterday, and got as far as Stony Stratford, where I advise no one to\r\npass the night. The beds are bad even for England, and I never\r\nexperienced anything more like a trappist's couch. I left yesterday\r\nmorning in the midst of a bitterly cold and extremely thick fog. It\r\nwas impossible to get any idea of the country, which, however, from\r\ncertain occasional glimpses, I believe to be rather pretty, especially\r\nabout Iston Hall, a beautiful place owned by Lord Porchester. You pass\r\na superb gate, from which there stretches a vast park, beyond which\r\nthere is a view of a valley which seemed to me charming. Leamington, a\r\nfew miles further on, is well built and cheerful.\r\n\r\nAs to Warwick itself, where I arrived yesterday morning, one enters by\r\na fortress gate. Its aspect is the most severe, its courtyard the most\r\nsombre, its hall the most enormous, its furniture the most Gothic, and\r\nits style the most perfect that you can possibly imagine. Everything\r\nsuggests the feudal system. A large and rapid river bathes the foot of\r\nthe great dark old battlemented towers. The monotonous noise of the\r\nwater is interrupted by the crackling of the great trees which burn in\r\nthe gigantic fireplaces. In the hall huge logs are piled upon the dogs\r\nwhich stand on slabs of polished marble, and each log requires two men\r\nto put it on the fire.\r\n\r\nI have only just glanced rapidly at the stained glass in the great\r\nbroad windows, which are on the same scale as the fireplaces, at the\r\narmour and the antlers and the other curiosities of the hall, at the\r\nfine family portraits in the three great drawing-rooms. As yet I am\r\nonly familiar with my own room, which is completely furnished with\r\nBoulle and carved walnut, and, in addition to these antique\r\nsplendours, is full of all the modern comforts.\r\n\r\nLady Warwick's boudoir is also full of interesting things. She came\r\nto my room yesterday to fetch me, and after showing me the boudoir she\r\ntook me to the little drawing-room, where we found Lord Monson, the\r\nson of her first marriage, a little man, or rather boy, shy and\r\nsilent, and much embarrassed by the exiguity and weakness of his\r\nperson. Lady Monson was also there. She is a striking contrast to her\r\nhusband, being a tall blonde Englishwoman, stiff and bony, with long\r\nfeatures and large hands, a great broad flat chest, angular in her\r\nmovements, and rather like an old maid, but pretty and kindly. Here,\r\ntoo, was Lady Eastnor, the sister of Lady Stuart of Rothesay; ugly,\r\nlike all her family, but well-bred, like all Lady Hardwicke's\r\ndaughters. Lord Eastnor, a mighty hunter and a great eater and\r\ndrinker, was also of the party; and his brother, a parson, who, I\r\nbelieve, has not shaved since Christmas, and who never opened his\r\nmouth except to eat. Lord Brooke, the son of the house, is fifteen and\r\nvery nice looking; his tutor was with him, and was silent and\r\nrespectful, as tutors should be. Finally, there was the striking\r\nfigure of Lady Catherine Neeld, a sister of the Ashleys and a daughter\r\nof Lord Shaftesbury. She is celebrated for the suit she brought\r\nagainst her husband, of which all the papers were full last year. She\r\nis a friend of Lady Warwick's who protects, shelters, and defends her.\r\nShe is a bold, rather loud person, with a malicious tongue and\r\nfamiliar and somewhat audacious manners. She is well made, has a white\r\nskin and beautiful fair hair, but neither eyebrows nor eyelashes. Her\r\nface is long and narrow; her eyes have no special merit, and her nose\r\nand mouth remind you of what Madame de Sévigné said of Madame de\r\nSforze when she described her as being like \"a parrot eating a\r\ncherry.\"\r\n\r\nLord Warwick had a touch of rheumatic gout, and kept his room. No one\r\nseemed to miss him.\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house is far from being in harmony with the splendid\r\npile which she inhabits. She has been pretty without being beautiful;\r\nshe is naturally witty, but has not improved her gifts by study. She\r\nknows nothing of the traditions of her castle. Her disposition is all\r\ntowards fun and informality; her bodily habits are nonchalant, and\r\naltogether this plump, lazy, idle little woman seems anything but the\r\nnatural mistress of her vast, sombre, and almost terrifying house.\r\nMoreover, every one seems to me a pigmy in these rooms, to fill which\r\nyou would require superhuman creatures like the King-maker. Our\r\ngeneration is too meanly proportioned for such an abode.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room is fine, but less grandiose than the rest of the\r\nhouse. On leaving table a long time before the men we went to the\r\ngreat drawing-room, which is flanked by two smaller ones. In this huge\r\nroom there are some splendid Van Dycks, and the panelling is entirely\r\nof cedar in its natural colour. The perfume of this wood is very\r\nagreeable. The furniture is covered in velvet damask, the prevailing\r\ntone of which is deep red. There are many really magnificent pieces of\r\nBoulle, and several marbles brought back from Italy. The two enormous\r\nwindows form deep recesses and have no curtains, being simply framed\r\nin cedar wood. In this huge area there were only about a score of\r\ncandles, which reminded me of will-o'-the-wisps, which deceived the\r\neye rather than illuminated the room. I have never seen anything more\r\nchilling and depressing than this drawing-room, in which the ladies'\r\nconversation was very languid indeed. I kept thinking that the\r\nportrait of Charles the First and the bust of the Black Prince would\r\ncome and join us at coffee before the fire. At last the men came, and\r\nafter them the tea, and at ten o'clock a sort of supper. At eleven a\r\ngeneral move was made to bed, which seemed to be a relief for every\r\none.\r\n\r\nDuring this long evening I thought many times of the description given\r\nby Corinne of her mother-in-law's château. At dinner nothing was\r\ntalked of but county balls and Leamington Spa, and other petty gossip\r\nof the neighbourhood. Feature by feature it recalled Madame de Staël's\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Lady Warwick took me over the Castle, which I should\r\nhave got to know better if I had been left to myself, or had been put\r\nin charge of one of the two housekeepers, the elder of whom is\r\nninety-three. To look at her you would think she was going to tell you\r\nall about the Wars of the Roses. The châtelaine cares nothing whatever\r\nabout all the curiosities with which her domain is stored, and took me\r\nthrough them at breakneck speed.\r\n\r\nI did, however, manage to stop for a moment before the saddle and\r\ncaparison of Queen Elizabeth, which she used on her progress from\r\nKenilworth to Warwick, and I took up the lute presented by Lord\r\nLeicester to her Majesty, a wonderfully carved instrument, with the\r\nQueen's arms in raised copper on the wood, and close by them the\r\nfavourite's own, which seemed to me a trifle impertinent. I noticed a\r\ncurious portrait of the Queen in her coronation robes which showed a\r\nterrible resemblance to her terrible father. _A propos_ of this\r\nportrait Lord Monson told me a thing I did not know, viz., that\r\nElizabeth, who always affected a youthful appearance, never allowed\r\nherself to be painted except in full face and so lighted as to avoid\r\nany shadow on her features which might accentuate the lines, and so\r\nindicate the number of her years. It is said that this idea was so\r\nconstantly in her mind that she always faced the light when she gave\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe library at Warwick is not particularly remarkable, and did not\r\nappear to me to be much used. Queen Anne's bed-chamber with the bed of\r\nthe period is a fine room.\r\n\r\nAt ten Lady Warwick and I entered a carriage, Lady Monson and Lord\r\nBrooke escorting us on horseback, and we drove through an interesting\r\nlandscape to the celebrated ruins of Kenilworth. There I was really\r\ndisappointed, not because the ruins do not give the idea of a vast and\r\nnoble building, but because the country is so flat, and the absence of\r\ntrees is so complete, that there is nothing which you could call\r\npicturesque. It is true that there is a superb coat of ivy over all,\r\nwhich is good as far as it goes, but is not enough to make a picture.\r\n\r\nLady Monson is less ignorant of the locality than her mother-in-law,\r\nand she pointed out to me the banqueting-hall, Queen Elizabeth's room,\r\nthe buildings constructed by Leicester which, though more modern, are\r\nmore ruinous than the rest, and the gate-house through which the\r\nQueen's procession passed, and which was built specially for the\r\noccasion. This erection is still in a good state of preservation, and\r\nis inhabited by one of the tenants of Lord Clarendon, the owner of the\r\nruins. In the interior there is a chimney-piece with the initials and\r\nthe crest of Leicester. The wing in which Sir Walter Scott lodges Amy\r\nRobsart owes its celebrity to romance and not to history.\r\n\r\nI was not allowed to ascend the towers, as the stability of the ruins\r\nis doubtful, and only last year Lady Sefton's niece had an accident\r\nhere. Besides I was assured that the view was in no way remarkable.\r\n\r\nWe made a _détour_ on the return journey and passed right through\r\nLeamington. The whole town, and especially the bathing establishment,\r\nseemed to me quite pretty. Just now it is gay with hunting men, who\r\nlive here much as they do at Melton Mowbray.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back it was not yet dark, and Lady Warwick took me to see\r\na pretty view of the River Avon at the bottom of the park, which is\r\nbeautifully planted. I was also shown some glass-houses, which are\r\nneither very well kept nor very full of flowers, but in which is kept\r\nthe Warwick Vase--a huge vessel of white marble beautifully shaped and\r\ncarved. It was brought back from the Garden of Trajan by the father of\r\nthe present Lord Warwick.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow I return to London.\r\n\r\n_London, February 12, 1834._--M. de Talleyrand told me that yesterday\r\nevening, while playing whist with Madame de Lieven, who had Lord\r\nSefton for a partner, the Princess, with her habitual absence of mind,\r\nrevoked twice, whereupon Lord Sefton quietly remarked that it was\r\nquite natural that these abominable Dardanelles should often cause\r\nMadame de Lieven to revoke. This caused much merriment to the company.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from M. Royer-Collard in which occurs the following\r\nsentence: \"I like M. de Bacourt very much indeed. His clear, simple\r\nand intelligent conversation is charming, and I find no one here who\r\ntalks so well. Our mutual understanding is complete.\"\r\n\r\n_London, February 15, 1834._--The Duchess-Countess of Sutherland\r\ncalled for me yesterday and took Pauline and me to the _Panorama of\r\nthe North Pole_ in which Captain Ross plays a prominent part. Both\r\npainting and perspective are beyond anything I have seen of its kind;\r\nbut everything which relates to adventures so terrible and sufferings\r\nso prolonged is intensely interesting.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Parry's crew in the _Fury_ who had afterwards been with\r\nCaptain Ross, happened by chance to be there. He gave Pauline a little\r\npiece of the fur with which he had covered himself when among the\r\nEsquimaux, and presented me with a fragment of granite taken from the\r\nmost northerly point reached by the expedition. We asked him many\r\nquestions, and he often recurred to the moment when they sighted the\r\n_Isabella_, which rescued them and brought them home. This was on the\r\n26th of August, and he told us that as long as he lived he would drink\r\nto the memory of that happy moment on every anniversary.\r\n\r\nLast night we had a rout, at which there was nothing remarkable either\r\nin the way of dresses or of beauties or of absurdities. The Marquis of\r\nDouglas is extraordinarily handsome, and Miss Emily Hardy seemed to me\r\nrather smitten with him.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry was represented by Lord Grey, Lord Lansdowne, and Lord\r\nMelbourne. The Cabinet is much embarrassed, for every day incidents\r\nare happening in the House of Commons which show up vividly the\r\nserious divisions in its ranks. Last night Lord Grey's face showed\r\nvisible traces of this.\r\n\r\n_London, February 20, 1834._--A new and very ugly story is afloat\r\nconcerning Count Alfred d'Orsay which is as follows: Sir Willoughby\r\nCotton, writing from Brighton at the same time to Count d'Orsay and to\r\nLady Fitzroy Somerset, cross-directed the letters so that M. d'Orsay\r\non opening the letter which he received, instead of seeing the mistake\r\nand stopping at the first line, which ran \"Dear Lady Fitzroy,\" read it\r\nthrough and found, among other Brighton gossip, some pleasantries\r\nabout Lady Tullemore and one of her lovers, and a sharp saying about\r\nhimself. What did he do but go to the club, read out the letter before\r\nevery one, and finally put it under cover and send it to Lord\r\nTullemore! The result very nearly was a crop of duels. Lady Tullemore\r\nis very ill, and the guilty lover has fled to Paris. Friends\r\nintervened, however, and the thing was hushed up for the sake of the\r\nladies, but M. d'Orsay cut (and cuts) an odious figure.\r\n\r\n_London, February 27, 1834._--The latest joke is to spread rumours of\r\nLord Palmerston's marriage with Miss Jerningham. She was at the\r\nRussian Embassy yesterday overdressed and bedizened as usual. Madame\r\nde Lieven made her a target for her wit, but couldn't quite get out of\r\ninviting her. No doubt, in order to avenge this constraint, she said\r\nquite loudly that Miss Jerningham reminded her of the usual\r\nadvertisement in the _Times_: \"A housemaid wants a situation in a\r\nfamily where a footman is kept.\" Clever and only too true, but most\r\nuncharitable! She was good enough to add that the comic papers had\r\nchristened Lord Palmerston \"the venerable cupid.\"\r\n\r\n_London, May 1, 1834._--Mr. Salomon Dedel arrived this morning from\r\nthe Hague, bringing me a letter from General Fagel, which contained\r\nthe following: \"Someone has found out that Dedel had expressed the\r\nhope that he might reappear in London armed with instructions to bring\r\nthe affair to a conclusion.\" Dedel mentioned the matter to the King,\r\nwho replied: \"The purpose of your absence was to see your relatives\r\nand friends of whom you can give news if anybody asks you.\" Further on\r\nthe same letter runs: \"We wish to be forced by the five powers, and\r\nwill take no account of a partial coercion like that of 1832. If the\r\npowers are not unanimous we shall continue to refuse any definite\r\narrangement. At the worst we prefer the road to Silesia to recognising\r\nLeopold.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Jaucourt, referring to the insane party spirit now in the\r\nascendant in France, writes to M. de Talleyrand that her brother M. de\r\nThiard said at her house the other day: \"I would give my right arm to\r\nhave Charles X. back in the place from which we deposed him.\"\r\n\r\nIs it not curious that young Baillot, who has just been assassinated\r\nduring the late troubles in Paris, should have often boasted of having\r\nkilled several people during the days of July 1830 in exactly the same\r\nway as he was killed himself?\r\n\r\nI have just heard of an amusing thing said by the old Marchioness of\r\nSalisbury. Last Sunday she was at church, a rare thing with her, and\r\nthe preacher, speaking of the Fall, observed that Adam excusing\r\nhimself had cried out, \"Lord the woman tempted me.\" At this quotation\r\nLady Salisbury, who appeared not to have heard of the incident before,\r\njumped up in her seat saying, \"Shabby fellow indeed!\"\r\n\r\nI have just been paying a morning call on the Queen, whom I found much\r\nagitated, anxious, and yet pleased, about her impending journey to\r\nGermany. The King arranged it without her knowledge and superintended\r\nthe smallest details. It is he who has chosen the suite, engaged the\r\nservants, and selected the carriages. It has all been done in such a\r\nhurry that the Queen has not yet recovered from the shock. She doesn't\r\nknow whether to be glad at the prospect of seeing her mother, who is\r\naged and infirm, or to be worried about leaving the King alone for six\r\nweeks. She told me that the King wanted to invite M. de Talleyrand and\r\nme to Windsor during our stay at Salt Hill, but that she herself had\r\ndissuaded him as it would have led to other invitations, and they\r\nwould have had to ask, among other people, the Princesse de Lieven,\r\nfor whom the King does not care.\r\n\r\nThe Queen coughs and thinks herself quite ill, but she hopes to be\r\nrestored by her native air.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to be struck, every time one sees her, with the\r\nperfect simplicity, truth and uprightness of her Majesty's character.\r\nI have rarely seen a person more devoted to duty or more\r\nself-consistent in all that she says and does. She is both kind and\r\ncheerful, and, though not beautiful, she is perfectly graceful. The\r\ntones of her voice are unfortunately nasal, but what she says is so\r\nfull of good sense and real kindness that it is a pleasure to listen\r\nto her. The satisfaction she feels in speaking German is very natural,\r\nand I feel this every time she does so. I wish, however, that she\r\nindulged herself in this way more sparingly in the presence of English\r\npeople. In her own interest it would be better for her if she had more\r\nof the Englishwoman in her; no one could have remained more\r\ncharacteristically German than she has, and I fear that this sometimes\r\ngives offence. How is a monarch to escape doing so nowadays? They are\r\nmade responsible for everything and are always threatened with\r\npunishment merited or unmerited. The poor Queen has already a sad\r\nexperience of the bitterness of unpopularity and of calumny. She has\r\nalways faced attack with dignity and valour, and I am sure she has\r\ncourage enough to confront any danger.\r\n\r\nThis is St. Philip's day; the Lievens and Lady Cowper dined with us,\r\nand Prince Esterhazy came in afterwards. I have noticed for some time\r\na certain sharpness in his manner to the Lievens which is unusual in\r\nhim. The pleasantries which he addresses to the Princess soon turn to\r\nirony. I suspect that on her side she will not regret his departure.\r\nShe has never managed to subdue him; he slips through her fingers, and\r\nhis jests, always subtle and sometimes malicious, embarrass her and\r\nput her out. They are constantly on their guard with one another, and\r\nthey make up for the resulting constraint by frequent interchanges of\r\npin pricks.\r\n\r\nThe Queen told me that Esterhazy, when lately at Windsor, spoke to her\r\nof M. de Talleyrand with the greatest enthusiasm, saying that one of\r\nhis greatest pleasures was to listen to his conversation. He added,\r\nthat when he got home he often made a note of what he had heard from\r\nM. de Talleyrand. It seems that Esterhazy keeps a journal in great\r\ndetail. He told the Queen so, and explained that this habit was of\r\nsuch long standing that the journal already filled several large\r\nvolumes, which he was fond of re-reading. The Queen was surprised, not\r\nunnaturally, to discover such a sedentary habit so consistently\r\nmaintained by one whose manners were so restless and whose ideas were\r\nso often scattered.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston since our return from France has never accepted an\r\ninvitation to dinner with us, and has never come to a single one of\r\nour receptions. However, we invited him again to-night, and thought\r\nthat the presence of Lady Cowper might attract him, but he sent\r\nexcuses at the last moment.\r\n\r\n_London, Friday, May 2, 1834._--Alva writes that he hears from his\r\nnephew, the Marquis de Miraflorès the Spanish Minister in London, that\r\nLord Palmerston never ceases praising the brilliancy of his diplomatic\r\n_début_ here. The marquis, being a fool, does not perceive the cause\r\nof this eulogium, which is, of course, the treaty of quadruple\r\nalliance proposed by him at Lord Palmerston's own instigation, the\r\nresults of which, though by no means apparent as yet, may be more\r\nembarrassing than pleasing to its author and to France.\r\n\r\nM. de Montrond writes to M. de Talleyrand to say that he has caused\r\nhis desire to come to London to be intimated to M. de Rigny, who,\r\nbefore allowing him to go, desires him to make sure whether M. de\r\nTalleyrand would like it. M. de Montrond is much annoyed at this\r\nobstacle, but I am grateful to M. de Rigny for having raised it. As a\r\nmatter of fact, last year M. de Montrond professed to be charged with\r\na secret diplomatic mission, and was simply a nuisance. The bad temper\r\nhe felt and showed when he was not admitted to the secret concerns of\r\nthe Embassy often made him forget his manners, annoyed M. de\r\nTalleyrand and was most unpleasant for everybody. For the last\r\neighteen months M. de Montrond has had the management of a thousand\r\nLouis of the Foreign Affairs Secret Service money: I doubt if he ever\r\ngives them back the change!\r\n\r\nIn London all the workmen are in rebellion; the tailors have stopped\r\nwork for want of hands. It is said that on the cards for Lady\r\nLansdowne's ball there was inscribed: \"The gentlemen to appear in\r\ntheir old coats.\" Now the laundries have caught the infection, and\r\nsoon we shall have to wash our own linen like the princesses in the\r\n_Odyssey_.\r\n\r\n_London, May 3, 1834._--M. de Talleyrand speaks with as much truth as\r\nwit of the \"dangerous benevolence\" of Lord Holland. With the most\r\nperfect geniality, the most equable temper, the gayest pleasantries,\r\nand the most obliging manner in the world, his Lordship is always\r\nready to set light to the revolutionary train, and he feels the\r\ngreatest annoyance of which he is capable when he is unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nYesterday I dined with Sir Stratford Canning. His house is curious,\r\nbeautiful, admirably planned and full of souvenirs of Constantinople\r\nand of Spain. He himself is full of courtesy and learning; his\r\nconversation is witty, and if it were not for a certain contraction of\r\nthe lips which spoils an otherwise fine face, and for the oppressed\r\nair of his wife, one could hardly understand the bad accounts of him\r\nwhich one hears almost everywhere. This, at least, was the pretext on\r\nwhich the Czar refused to receive him last winter as Ambassador at St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\n_London, May 4, 1834._--Koreff is a braggadocious creature with a vein\r\nof indiscreet curiosity which I have sometimes noticed on the\r\nContinent, and which here inspires me with the most profound mistrust.\r\nHis wit and his learning are lost among the bad features of his\r\ncharacter, which often make him quite impossible. He lives on gossip\r\nof all kinds, public and private, and when he can get nothing else to\r\ntalk about he talks about medicine. Then he assumes the physician and\r\ndeifies his art. You hear of patients saved by him when all hope was\r\ngone; of his marvellous discoveries, of magnetism, homeopathy true and\r\nfalse, of things natural and supernatural, possible and impossible.\r\nEverything serves to magnify his importance, to surround the poor\r\ncreature with an atmosphere of the marvellous, which covers his want\r\nof real dignity.\r\n\r\nWe had him to dinner with Sir Henry Halford, and I don't think they\r\ntook to each other. What, indeed, could they have in common? Science\r\nperhaps, if by science they both understood the same thing. Sir Henry\r\nis a suave and polished person--measured, discreet, supple, and\r\ndeferential; a perfect courtier, a man of fortune, highly respected,\r\nand a great practitioner. He has never sought to be anything to the\r\ngreat but their doctor, and consequently, without seeking it, he has\r\nfound himself in all family and State secrets. Koreff, on the other\r\nhand, poses as a man of letters and a statesman, and has thus made\r\npersons in great places chary of having him as their doctor. This was\r\nhow he came to grief at Berlin; he will find it difficult to regain\r\nhis ground at Paris, and he won't, in my opinion, be a success in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of gossip and indiscreet curiosity, I cannot forget a very\r\ntrue reflection which the Duke of Wellington has just imparted to me\r\non the subject of Alava. \"Whoever aims at being in everybody's\r\nconfidence,\" said his Grace, \"must necessarily give his own confidence\r\nto more than one person, and this he usually does at some one else's\r\nexpense.\" The Duke's honest commonsense is admirable. I had a long\r\ntalk with him to-day at dinner, and I should like to remember\r\neverything he said. Truth and simplicity are becoming so rare that one\r\nis anxious to gather up the crumbs.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington's memory is very sure. He never quotes\r\ninexactly; he forgets nothing and never exaggerates; and if there is\r\nsomething a trifle abrupt, a little dry and military in his\r\nconversation, what he says is nevertheless attractive owing to its\r\nnaturalness, its fairness, and the perfect good manners with which he\r\nsays it. His manners are indeed excellent, and a woman has never to be\r\non her guard against a conversation taking an awkward turn. In this\r\nrespect he is much more reserved than Lord Grey, though in many ways\r\nthe latter's education is more elaborate and his intelligence more\r\ncultivated than the Duke's.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington made a rather striking remark to me about the\r\nEnglish character, to the effect that no people have a greater hatred\r\nof crimes of violence. In England a murder is discovered with the\r\ngreatest promptitude. Every one helps to discover the assassin; tracks\r\nhim out and denounces him, and is eager that justice should be done.\r\nHe assured me that the English soldier is the least cruel in the\r\nworld, and that once a battle is over he hardly ever commits deeds of\r\nviolence. He is a great robber, no doubt, but not a murderer.\r\n\r\nThe excessive and _naïve_ vanity of Lady Jersey, which amuses the\r\nDuke, led us to talk of Madame de Staël, with whom he was well\r\nacquainted, and whose absurd pretensions struck him as much as her wit\r\nand eloquence dazzled him. Madame de Staël, who wished to appear to\r\nhis Grace in every character--even in the most feminine--observed one\r\nday that what she liked most in the world to hear was a declaration of\r\nlove. She was so elderly and so ugly that the Duke could not help\r\nreplying, \"Yes, when you can be sure that it is genuine.\"\r\n\r\nLady Londonderry, who is celebrated for her eccentricities, being near\r\nher time, and certain she would have a son, has ordered a little\r\nhussar costume--the uniform of her husband's regiment. When she was\r\nordering it she told the tailor that it was for a child six days old.\r\n\"Your ladyship means six years?\" replied the tailor. \"No, indeed,\"\r\nanswered Lady Londonderry; \"six days; it is for his baptism!\"\r\n\r\nIn the last years of George IV. the Duke of Cumberland enjoyed a good\r\ndeal of his favour. Yet it was then that the King said, in reply to\r\nthe Duke of Wellington's inquiry why H.R.H. was so universally\r\nunpopular: \"It is because there are no lovers, no brothers and\r\nsisters, no friends, whom the Duke of Cumberland would not set by the\r\nears if he came among them.\" It is said, however, that the Duke is no\r\nfool, but so cross-grained that he spoils everything he touches.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's approaching departure for Germany is causing anxiety to\r\nthe King's best friends. It appears that his Majesty, who is the best\r\nof men, is subject to occasional attacks of strange excitement, that\r\nhe takes extraordinary ideas into his head, and that his condition is\r\nsometimes so abnormal that he threatens to lose his balance\r\naltogether. The Queen, with her watchful kindness and her excellent\r\ngood sense, watches over him at these crises, cuts them short,\r\nexercises a calming and moderating influence, and brings him back to a\r\nproper frame of mind.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the King is very angry with Dom Pedro about the\r\nlast commercial decree, which was published in Portugal the very day\r\nbefore the signature of the treaty of quadruple alliance in London.\r\nHis annoyance will probably not carry him so far as to refuse to\r\nratify the treaty, for with all his goodness the poor King is not very\r\n\"consistent,\" as they say here.\r\n\r\nI am told that Lord Durham was so uplifted by the reception prepared\r\nfor him two years ago at St. Petersburg by the efforts of Madame de\r\nLieven, and by that which he obtained recently at Paris (thanks to M.\r\nde Talleyrand's letters), that he doesn't think that a private\r\nsituation is any longer worthy of him. His plan, of which he makes no\r\nsecret, is to turn out Lord Grey, his father-in-law, and to put\r\nhimself in his place, or at least to get into the Cabinet, the result\r\nof which would be the resignation of all the other members. He would,\r\nperhaps, consent to be satisfied with the Viceroyalty of Ireland, or\r\nas a last resort to take the Embassy at Paris; but if all these fail,\r\nhe declares that he will put himself openly at the head of the\r\nRadicals and declare a war to the knife on all existing institutions.\r\n\r\nI know that Pozzo is writing hymns in honour of the King of the\r\nFrench, reminiscences of which occur in the speech he has just made on\r\nthe occasion of the Feast of St. Philip. He doesn't mind M. de Rigny,\r\nfor, as a matter of fact, it is the King who is now his own Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs. Above all, he seems much pleased to be rid of M.\r\nde Broglie, whose passion for argument, scornful manners, and\r\nexclusive devotion to Lord Granville did not smooth or sweeten his\r\nrelations with the rest of the diplomatic corps.\r\n\r\nPozzo, like many others, does not think that France has got through\r\nher revolutionary troubles. He seems anxious about the future, and I\r\nthink this feeling is shared by all who are not blinded by\r\npreposterous over-confidence.\r\n\r\n_London, May 5, 1834._--I have just heard a piece of very sad news, my\r\nexcellent friend the Abbé Girollet is very ill. I shall soon have no\r\none left to love, no one in whose affection I can trust. The dear Abbé\r\nwas so happy at Rochecotte in his pretty house among his books, his\r\nflowers, his poor, and his neighbours. It was a touching picture which\r\nI had few opportunities of enjoying, and which I shall probably never\r\nsee again. It will remain to me as a dream cut short by my absence,\r\nbut pleasant to remember while life lasts, for it will be consecrated\r\nto the purest and most faithful of God's servants, to the most\r\nfaithful of friends, to the most tolerant of men.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent gave a reception last night in honour of her\r\nbrother, Duke Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg. There was such a crowd that it\r\nwas like one of the Queen's drawing-rooms. The young Princess Victoria\r\nstruck me the moment I saw her as having grown a little and as being\r\npaler and thinner. By this she is much improved, though still too\r\nsmall for the fifteen years which she will complete in three weeks\r\ntime. The little queen that is to be has a fine complexion and\r\nmagnificent chestnut hair. In spite of her small stature she is well\r\nmade; she will have pretty shoulders and fine arms, her expression and\r\nher manners are sweet and kindly, she speaks several languages\r\nfluently, and it is said that she is being very carefully educated.\r\nHer mother and the Baroness Lehzen, a German lady, take complete\r\ncharge of the Princess. The Duchess of Northumberland only fulfils her\r\nfunctions as Governess on State occasions. I have heard the Duchess of\r\nKent reproached for surrounding her daughter so much with Germans that\r\nher English accent is defective.\r\n\r\n_London, May 6, 1834._--Last night I dined at Lord Sefton's; he was\r\njust back from the House of Lords, where Lord Londonderry had been\r\nrenewing his attack of a few years ago, and accusing the Government of\r\nbeing managed and duped by \"that wily politician\" M. de Talleyrand.\r\nHis expressions are as unalterable as his opinions, for they are the\r\nvery ones he used three years ago. On that occasion he was sharply\r\ntaken up by the Duke of Wellington, who, though belonging to the same\r\nparty as Lord Londonderry, made the rude speech of the latter the\r\noccasion for a most flattering reference to M. de Talleyrand. It seems\r\nthat Lord Grey did the same yesterday. To him it came much easier, for\r\nit was his own cause that he was defending; still I am obliged to him,\r\nthough I do not class what he did with the conduct of the Duke of\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nI went with Lady Sefton to the opera of _Othello_. It used to be my\r\nfavourite opera, but yesterday it did not impress me so favourably.\r\nRubini, with all the grace and expressiveness of his singing, lacks\r\nthe ringing force which made Garcia incomparable in the part of\r\nOthello. The orchestra was meagre, and the concerted pieces were not\r\nworked up enough. Mlle. Grisi acted and sang well; I thought her\r\nbetter than Mme. Malibran, but she fell short of the sublime\r\nsimplicity and greatness of Mme. Pasta. There are more beautiful\r\nvoices than hers and more beautiful women than she, but Mme. Pasta and\r\nno other is the true Tragic Muse, and no one can replace her in my\r\nadmiration or in my recollection. When she was making her _début_ at\r\nParis, Talma, who was still alive, was transported by her words, her\r\nposes, and her gestures, and exclaimed: \"That woman has discovered in\r\na day what I have been seeking for thirty years.\"\r\n\r\n_London, May 8, 1834._--I have already spoken of the good action\r\nperformed three years ago by the Duke of Wellington in answering Lord\r\nLondonderry's attack on M. de Talleyrand. He completed it the day\r\nbefore yesterday by showing openly by repeated exclamations of _Hear!\r\nHear!_ how thoroughly he agreed with the high opinion which Lord Grey\r\nexpressed of M. de Talleyrand. Several people have been kind enough to\r\nseize the opportunity of expressing their regard for M. de Talleyrand.\r\nPrince de Lieven and Prince Esterhazy, at the King's levee yesterday,\r\nboth thanked Lord Grey for doing justice to their veteran colleague.\r\n\r\nM. de Rigny writes confidentially to M. de Talleyrand that the\r\nmarriage of Princess Marie of Orléans to the second brother of the\r\nKing of Naples has been decided, and that the contract will be\r\nprepared with Prince Butera, who has just arrived in Paris. The\r\nadmiral seems to think that certain questions of interest will delay\r\nthe conclusion of this affair. I should be sorry, for the Orléans\r\nPrincesses--pleasant, well-mannered, well-dowered great ladies as they\r\nare, are none the less difficult to marry. There is about them a faint\r\naroma of usurpation which deters certain princely families from an\r\nalliance with them. It is curious that King Louis-Philippe, who has\r\nfor his children the sort of affection which it is the fashion to call\r\nbourgeois, is so stiff about helping the Princesses, his daughters,\r\nout of their difficult position by the large dowries to which they are\r\nentitled. Princess Marie would be better in Italy than anywhere else.\r\nShe has any amount of imagination and vivacity, but her deportment is\r\ndefective, and in spite of an education which should have assured her\r\nprinciples, she has a freedom of manner and conversation which might\r\nproduce an idea (utterly mistaken as it would be) that they were not\r\nvery solid in their foundations.\r\n\r\nYesterday we carried out our plan, formed more than a year ago, of\r\nvisiting Eltham, a barn which once was a banqueting-hall of the Kings\r\nof England. From the days of Henry III. down to the time of Cromwell,\r\nthey frequently occupied the palace of which this hall was a part. Its\r\nproportions are fine, but it is no longer possible to judge of its\r\ndecoration. Several pieces of wall, the moat, now planted and watered\r\nby a pretty brook, and a Gothic bridge covered with ivy and very\r\npicturesque, show the former extent of the Royal manor.\r\n\r\nYesterday we dined with the Duchess of Kent. The strong scent of the\r\nflowers with which her small and low rooms were crowded, made them\r\nunwholesome without making them pleasant. Everything was stiff and\r\nsombre at this party to which a few of the nobility and the more\r\nimportant of the diplomatic corps were invited to meet the Royal\r\nfamily. The Princes present were on far from good terms. The King was\r\ncross with the Duchess of Kent. The Duke of Cumberland was absent for\r\nthe good reason that he wasn't invited, not having called on his\r\nsister-in-law since his return from Berlin. Everything down to the\r\narrangement of the chairs, which made conversation impossible,\r\nemphasised the weariness of the evening. The proceedings were\r\ninterminable, the room was very hot, our hostess was visibly ill at\r\nease. She is not uncivil, but has an unnatural sort of air, awkward\r\nand pedantic at the same time. The Duke of Somerset took the most\r\nsensible course and went to sleep, leaning against a pilaster,\r\nimmediately after dinner.\r\n\r\nEverybody was disposed to criticise, and hardly concealed their desire\r\nto do so. The Queen complained of the heat, and at dessert said to the\r\nDuchess that if she had eaten enough it would be a mercy if she might\r\nleave the table. The King said to his neighbours that the dinner was à\r\n_l'entreprise_, and pretended not to understand a word of what Duke\r\nFerdinand of Saxe-Coburg was saying. His Highness, who is the Duchess\r\nof Kent's brother, is ugly, awkward, and embarrassed; he has made no\r\ngreat impression here, especially not with the King, to whom he showed\r\nno great anxiety to be introduced. His Majesty, on the other hand,\r\nkept him waiting for a long time before receiving him, which made the\r\nDuchess of Kent very cross.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven pointed out to me the familiarity with which\r\nEsterhazy addresses and treats the Royal Family. She professed to be\r\nmuch scandalised, and said that the fact that he was a relation (to\r\nwhich I referred) was no excuse at all. They are always rivals, and\r\nthis, they say, was very marked in the late reign. The Princesse de\r\nLieven by cultivating first Lady Hertford and then Lady Conyngham, and\r\nby reason of her thinness, which kept the favourite from fearing her\r\nas a rival, managed to get into the King's intimate circle, and thus\r\nshe contrived to get even with the Esterhazys, whose pleasant manners,\r\ngreat position, and family connection, naturally brought them nearer\r\nto the throne.\r\n\r\nThe absence of Lord Palmerston, who should have been asked to meet the\r\nambassadors, was much noticed. It is said that he is in the Duchess\r\nof Kent's black books, and that when he bows to her at Drawing-rooms\r\nshe never says a word to him. It was a surprise, also, not to see the\r\nSaxon Minister, a sort of family envoy for the Queen, for the Duchess\r\nherself and, above all, for Duke Ferdinand, to whose person he is\r\nofficially attached.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Gloucester could not deny herself the pleasure of\r\nending a civil and apologetic phrase by a charitable remark on the\r\ninnate awkwardness of the Duchess of Kent, and the Princesse de Lieven\r\nwas bold enough to recall the fact that George IV. used to speak of\r\nhis sister-in-law as \"the Swiss Governess.\" Whatever be the faults of\r\nthe Duchess of Kent, it must be admitted that her political conduct\r\nshows much prudence. As she will, no doubt, be called upon to act as\r\nRegent, this is not unimportant. No one knows what her political\r\nopinions are, or to what party she leans. She invites them all, mixes\r\nthem well at her parties, and keeps everyone in a state of perfect\r\nbalance. Her obstinate conduct towards the Fitzclarences is\r\nsmall-minded of her, and to explain it she affects a ridiculous\r\nprudery. I know that in answer to the remonstrances of Lord Grey on\r\nthe subject, she said, stupidly enough: \"But, my lord, you would not\r\nhave me expose my daughter to hear people talking of bastards and have\r\nher asking me what it meant.\" \"In that case, madam,\" replied Lord\r\nGrey, \"do not allow the Princess to read the history of the country\r\nwhich she is destined to rule, for the first page will teach her that\r\nWilliam of Normandy was called the Bastard before he was called the\r\nConqueror.\" It is said that the Duchess was much annoyed with Lord\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\n_London, May 9, 1834._--M. de Talleyrand learns by telegraphic\r\ndespatch from Paris that a Secretary of Embassy coming from Spain\r\nbrings news that Don Carlos has left the Peninsula, and is embarking\r\nfor England, which he wishes to choose as arbitrator in his family\r\nquarrel about the Crown. This seems very improbable, and before\r\nbelieving it everybody is awaiting confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity and interest aroused by M. de Talleyrand in England are\r\nas great as ever. As we were leaving our carriage at Kensington the\r\nother day, we saw women being lifted up by their husbands in order to\r\nsee him better. Scheffer's portrait of him is now with Colnaghi, the\r\nprint-seller, for the purpose of being engraved. It attracts many\r\ninterested spectators, and the shops in front of which M. de\r\nTalleyrand's carriage stops are immediately surrounded by a crowd. The\r\nportrait at Colnaghi's is placed next to that of Mr. Pitt. \"There is a\r\nman who made great events,\" said someone, pointing to the latter, \"he\"\r\n(indicating M. de Talleyrand) \"was clever enough to foresee them and\r\nprofit by them.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand told me yesterday that when he got rid of his\r\npriest's orders he felt an extraordinary desire to fight a duel. He\r\nspent two whole months diligently looking for a quarrel, and fixed on\r\nthe Duc de Castries, who was both narrow-minded and hot-tempered, as\r\nthe man most likely to gratify him. They were both members of the Club\r\ndes Echecs, and one day when they were both there M. de Castries began\r\nto read aloud a pamphlet against the minority of the nobility. M. de\r\nTalleyrand thought he saw his chance, and requested M. de Castries to\r\nstop reading what was personally offensive to him. M. de Castries\r\nreplied that at a club everybody might read or do what he pleased.\r\n\"Very well!\" said M. de Talleyrand, and placing himself at a tric-trac\r\ntable near M. de Castries, he scattered the pieces lying on it with so\r\nmuch noise as to drown entirely the voice of the reader. A quarrel\r\nseemed inevitable, and M. de Talleyrand was delighted, but M. de\r\nCastries only flushed and frowned, finished his reading, and left the\r\nclub without saying anything. Probably for him M. de Talleyrand could\r\nnot cease to be a priest.\r\n\r\n_London, May 10, 1834._--Yesterday I read very hurriedly M. de\r\nLamennais' book the _Paroles d'un Croyant_; it is the Apocalypse\r\naccording to a Jacobin. It is, moreover, very tedious, which surprises\r\nme, as M. de Lamennais is a man of much intelligence and undeniably\r\nhas talent. He has just reconciled himself with Rome, but this will\r\nbreak the peace, for his sworn enmity to all temporal power must be\r\ndispleasing as much to the Pope as to any autocrat.\r\n\r\nIt was much whispered yesterday that the King of England was feeling\r\nmore keenly than usual the influence of the spring season, during\r\nwhich every year his physical and mental equilibrium is markedly\r\ndisturbed. When one thinks of the family history of the House of\r\nBrunswick one finds reason to be alarmed.\r\n\r\nI never heard on the Continent of the malady known here as \"Hay\r\nFever,\" which shows itself at the time when the hay is cut. At this\r\ntime many people, the Duke of Devonshire and Lady Grosvenor among the\r\nnumber, suffer from fever, insomnia, and much nervous trouble. Those\r\nwho suffer from this disorder come back to town and avoid all meadows\r\nand the scent of hay.\r\n\r\nThe King's physical malaise, however, is accompanied by a curious\r\nmental agitation and a strange loquacity. If this unpleasant state of\r\nmatters is not ended by July, I am convinced that the Queen will\r\ndisregard his wishes, and will not go to Germany. She alone has any\r\nsalutary and moderating influence on him at such times.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris of the marriage of Elisabeth de Béranger to Charles\r\nde Vogüé, one of my cousins, who is both well bred and well endowed.\r\nShe was much sought after, for, besides her birth and fortune, she has\r\nboth beauty and talent. I knew her well when she was a child--a\r\ncharming creature, with much vivacity and a strong will of her own--a\r\ncharacteristic which has probably become more marked since her\r\nmother's death, as she is an only child and worshipped by her father.\r\n\r\nAnother marriage is also announced--that of my niece _à la mode de\r\nBretagne_, the Princesse Biron, whose _fiancé_ is Colonel Lazareff, an\r\nArmenian in the Russian service. He is said to be fabulously rich, and\r\nto possess palaces in the East, and gems and treasures of all kinds. I\r\ndon't know what brought him to Dresden, where he made my niece's\r\nacquaintance while she was staying with her sister, the Comtesse de\r\nHohenthal. She is said to be very much in love, but I confess that\r\nthis Armenian origin, this splendour in the manner of the Arabian\r\nNights, make me rather anxious. Sorcerers and swindlers often come\r\nfrom unknown countries; their jewels often turn to coal-dust; they can\r\nrarely face the light of day. In a word, I should have preferred for\r\nmy niece a man who was rather better born, rather less wealthy, and\r\nrather less oriental.\r\n\r\n_London, May 12, 1834._--The febrile and nervous condition of the King\r\nof England becomes more and more marked; he really says the most\r\nbizarre things. At the State Ball he said to Madame de Lieven that\r\npeople's minds had been rather unbalanced lately, and pointing to his\r\ncousin, the Duke of Gloucester, he added: \"Now, for instance, _he_\r\nbelieves in the transmigration of souls, and he thinks that the souls\r\nof Alexander the Great and Charles the First have passed into his.\"\r\nThe Princess replied rather flippantly: \"The dear departed must be\r\nmuch astonished to find themselves there!\" The King looked at her with\r\nan uncertain air and went on, \"Fortunately he is not clever enough to\r\nbring his head to the block;\" which for His Majesty is really not so\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nWhat is more serious than these absurd speeches is that he sleeps ill,\r\nhas frequent fits of anger, and has a childish military mania. Thus he\r\ngoes to the barracks, gives the most preposterous orders without\r\nconsulting the officers, reduces the regiments to disorder, and makes\r\nhimself the laughing-stock of the troops. The Duke of Wellington and\r\nthe Duke of Gloucester, both Field Marshals, and Lord Hill, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, thought it their duty to make joint\r\nrepresentations in respectful but serious terms. They were very ill\r\nreceived, Lord Hill being especially mishandled by his Majesty, who\r\nfrightened him very much. If the poor King's mind were to give way\r\nthey say it would certainly be on the subject of the army, for he\r\nthinks he has great military talent, or about women, with whom he\r\nthinks he is irresistible. They say that his only reason for hastening\r\nthe Queen's departure is his desire to be a bachelor for six weeks.\r\n\r\nHe has already taken time by the forelock in handing to the Queen all\r\nthe presents that she will find it necessary to give while on the\r\nContinent. The Royal Family is very anxious; they would like to\r\nprevent the King from exposing himself so much to the sun, from\r\ndrinking so much sherry, from seeing so many people. They want him, in\r\nfact, to lead a more retired life till the present crisis, which is so\r\nmuch worse than its predecessors, has quite passed off, but he is very\r\nhard to manage.\r\n\r\nAmong his strangest remarks I must quote his inquiry addressed to\r\nPrince Esterhazy, \"whether people married in Greece?\" \"I ask,\" he\r\nadded, noticing that the Prince was rather astonished, \"because, as of\r\ncourse you know, there are no marriages in Russia.\"\r\n\r\nThe good Duke of Gloucester, who is much attached to the King, is\r\nsincerely grieved. As to the Duke of Cumberland, he doesn't hesitate\r\nto proclaim in the clubs that the King is mad, and that it is his\r\nfather's case over again. This is neither brotherly nor filial. Some\r\npeople are already beginning to consider who would get the Regency if\r\nthis sad state of matters should persist or become acute; it is still\r\nrather a feverish condition than absolute insanity. The Duchess of\r\nKent doesn't count so long as the King lives and may have children.\r\nThe Princess Victoria, heiress-presumptive, is not of age, and the\r\nquestion would therefore be between the Queen and the Duke of\r\nCumberland, both of whom are almost equally unfavourable to the\r\npresent Cabinet. Thus things will be allowed to go pretty far before\r\nthe existence of the evil is admitted. Yesterday Lord Grey was saying\r\nwith a great affectation of emphasis, that the King was never better\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known here that Jerome Bonaparte intended to come, the\r\nCourt of Würtemberg was warned that it would be undesirable that he\r\nshould bring the Princess, his wife, along with him, as, in spite of\r\nthe near relationship, she could not be received. Jerome, therefore,\r\ncame alone, and in spite of the hint he had received he sought an\r\naudience with the King which M. de Mendelsloh, the Würtemberg\r\nminister, was foolish enough to request. The moment the King heard of\r\nit, he said: \"He may go to the Devil.\" He is so touchy about the\r\nBonapartes that he very nearly forbade the Duke of Sussex to come to\r\nCourt for having received Lucien, and took it very ill that the Lord\r\nChancellor exposed the Duke of Gloucester to the chance of meeting the\r\nPrince de Canino at one of Lady Brougham's parties.\r\n\r\nLord Durham dined with us yesterday for the first time, and I had my\r\nfirst opportunity of a direct conversation with him. I watched the\r\nmovements of his face, which is praised highly, and with reason; but I\r\nnoticed that it does not improve when he is speaking, and his smile\r\nsuits him ill. His lips express bitterness more than anything else,\r\nand all that comes from within seems to diminish his good looks. A\r\nface may remain beautiful even when it ceases to express kindness, but\r\na laugh which is not genial impresses me most unfavourably.\r\n\r\nLord Durham passes for a wit. He is ambitious, irascible, a spoilt\r\nchild of fortune; the most susceptible and the vainest of men. For all\r\nhis pretensions to a nobility dating from the Saxons, while his\r\nfather-in-law, Lord Grey, is content to trace his descent back to the\r\nConquest, Lord Durham professes all the most Radical doctrines. This,\r\nthey say, is only a device to obtain power. Heaven grant that it may\r\nnot be his ruin.\r\n\r\n_London, May 13, 1834._ Charles X. said to Madame de Gontaut on April\r\n25: \"Louise's education is finished. I should be glad if you would go\r\nthe day after to-morrow--the 27th.\" Mademoiselle who is much attached\r\nto Madame de Gontaut was in despair.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] The little Court of Charles X. was the scene of two\r\n  factions, one being the partisans of inertia, though not of\r\n  resignation; the other, being all in favour of action. Mme. de\r\n  Gontaut fell a victim to the former, a letter in which she\r\n  expressed disapproval of the situation to her daughter, Mme. de\r\n  Rohan, having been intercepted. The King, whom she accused of\r\n  weakness, reproached her violently, and after the interview she\r\n  finally left Prague and the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Gontaut behaved with great courage, and spent the 26th\r\nin vain attempts to console Mademoiselle, whose new governess is said\r\nto be, provisionally, the Vicomtesse d'Agoult. This is to replace a\r\nclever woman by a Saint. All this happened before the Duchesse de\r\nBerry arrived; she did not get back till May 7.\r\n\r\nI hear that Jerome Bonaparte played the King as much as he could. At\r\nthe Opera he sits alone at the front of his box, and the gentlemen who\r\naccompany him stand behind his chair.\r\n\r\nI spent an hour or more yesterday with the Princess Sophia of England.\r\nShe is well read, a good talker and very animated, and yet on the plea\r\nof bad health she lives a very retired life. She is said to possess in\r\na high degree the talent (if it can be so called) of mimicry in which\r\nshe resembles his late Majesty George IV. I am told that they used to\r\namuse each other very much and mutually drew each other out.\r\nYesterday, indeed, the conversation turned on Mme. d'Ompteda, a good\r\nsort of woman, but, to say the least, eccentric, and the Princess was\r\npleased to repeat for my benefit a complaint which Mme. d'Ompteda had\r\nmade to her of someone at Court. It was the most comic imitation I\r\nhave ever seen, and I was so convulsed with laughter that I had to beg\r\nthe Princess's pardon. She did not appear, however, to be very much\r\nshocked at my unconventional behaviour.\r\n\r\n_London, May 14, 1834._--M. Dupin, the elder, has written to M. de\r\nTalleyrand to announce his arrival, and signs himself \"_votre\r\naffectionné Dupin_.\" M. Dupin has often taken M. de Talleyrand's part,\r\nand I believe to good purpose, but his letters did not use to be so\r\nRoyal in their terms.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Quadruple Alliance Treaty has reached Lisbon and\r\nhas been approved. The ratification is expected at any moment in spite\r\nof the violent anger of Dom Pedro, who is much incensed because\r\nFrance, England, and Spain thought fit to give the title Infante to\r\nDom Miguel in spite of Dom Pedro's decree depriving him of it.\r\n\r\n_London, May 15, 1834._--It is asserted that M. Dupin is coming to\r\nLondon to show himself, wishing to accustom Europe to his greatness,\r\nfor it seems that he hopes next session to combine the Presidency of\r\nthe Council with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a time like the\r\npresent it is no longer safe to describe the most extravagant ideas as\r\nchimerical! This is not the first time that M. Dupin has aspired to\r\nthe portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Two years ago he tried to take it by\r\nforce, and when the King tried to make him see that he was perhaps not\r\nquite fit for this department, M. Dupin had a violent fit of temper,\r\nand taking one of his feet in both hands he showed the sole of his\r\nshoe to the King, saying, \"Ah! Ah! is it because I have nails in my\r\nshoes that I am not considered fit to treat with _Monsieur Lord\r\nGranville_!\" The King, in spite of his habitual indulgence, grew so\r\nangry at the increasing insolence of M. Dupin that he seized him by\r\nthe collar and, pressing his closed fist against his chest, forced him\r\nout of the room. This I have from an eye-witness. They were soon\r\nreconciled however, and met again on friendly terms. The Parisians\r\nhave thick skins.\r\n\r\nThe _Quotidienne_ at first praised M. de la Mennais's textbook, but\r\nafter some hesitation the Faubourg St.-Germain decided to dislike it.\r\nThey even asked M. de Chateaubriand to undertake a refutation, but he\r\nreplied that he admired every page and every line of it, and that if\r\nhe said anything publicly about it at all he would give it the praise\r\nwhich it deserves. M. de Chateaubriand becomes, or affects to become,\r\nmore and more Republican, and is saying that any form of monarchy has\r\nbecome impossible in France.\r\n\r\nThe Carlists are going to take part in the elections, and to send as\r\nmany Republicans to the Chamber as they can when they can't succeed\r\nthemselves. The words Republic and Republican are now current\r\neverywhere and no one is shocked. People's ears have got used to them.\r\n\r\n_London, May 16, 1834._--This is the most charming time at which to\r\nsee London. The squares are green and full of flowers; the vegetation\r\nin the parks is extraordinarily rich; all the balconies of the houses\r\nare packed with plants. All this, with the creepers which cover many\r\nof the houses up to the second storey, makes such a pretty picture\r\nthat one is the less inclined to regret the sun, which would soon put\r\nan end to all its freshness.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of reflection occurred to me yesterday morning at the\r\nQueen's Drawing-room, where the brilliancy of these splendid English\r\ncomplexions, the beautiful blonde hair falling in long ringlets on the\r\nrosiest cheeks and the whitest necks in the world, almost prevented\r\none from lamenting the absence of expression and movement which\r\naccompanies these beauties. It is the fashion to criticise\r\nEnglishwomen for their want of style. They walk badly, it is true, but\r\nin repose their nonchalance is not ungraceful. They are usually well\r\nmade and less pinched in their toilettes than Frenchwomen. Their\r\nproportions are finer and more developed. They sometimes dress without\r\nmuch taste, but at least each pleases herself and there is a diversity\r\nin their dresses which brings out each one very well. The bare\r\nshoulders, the flat coiffures, and the long locks of the young girls\r\nhere, would be very unsuitable in France, where very young girls are\r\nalmost all small, dark and thin.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to apply to Englishmen morally what I say of English\r\ngardens and of the beauty of Englishwomen. Their conversation is cold,\r\nreserved and unimaginative to a degree which, for a long time, is very\r\ntedious. But this feeling gives way to one of real pleasure if one\r\ntakes the trouble to look for the good sense, the goodness, the\r\nlearning, and the cleverness which are concealed under the shyness and\r\nembarrassment of their exterior. One has hardly ever any reason to\r\nregret having encouraged their timidity, for they never become either\r\nfamiliar or indiscreet, and they are so grateful to one for having\r\ndivined them and for coming to the rescue of their _mauvaise honte_\r\nthat this alone is a reward in itself. I only wish that they would not\r\nexpose those miserable orange blossoms to the thick fogs of their\r\natmosphere, that the women would not take the Paris _Journal des\r\nModes_ as a model of dress, and the men would not attempt the freer\r\nand more animated style of conversation which is current on the\r\nContinent. Detestable caricatures when they are copying others, the\r\nEnglish are admirable when they are themselves; they are well fitted\r\nto their own territory, and they should be judged only on their own\r\nground. An Englishman on the Continent is so much out of his element\r\nthat he runs the risk of being taken either for an idiot or a coxcomb.\r\n\r\n_London, May 17, 1834._--The Swedish Minister, M. de Bjoerstjerna, who\r\nis always singing the praises of his sovereign even in the most\r\ntrifling matters, was boasting to M. de Talleyrand the other day of\r\nthe strength, the grace, and the youthfulness which King Charles-John\r\nhas retained at his advanced age. He was particularly enthusiastic\r\nabout the thickness of his Majesty's hair, which he asserted was all\r\n\"as black as jet.\" \"That seems indeed wonderful,\" said M. de\r\nTalleyrand, \"but is it not possible that the King dyes his hair?\" \"No,\r\nI assure you,\" replied the Swede. \"Then it is indeed extraordinary,\"\r\nsaid M. de Talleyrand. \"Yes, indeed,\" continued M. de Bjoerstjerna,\r\n\"the man who every morning pulls out the white hairs from his\r\nMajesty's head must have sharp eyes.\" This is worthy of the popular\r\nreputation of Sweden as the Gascony of the North.\r\n\r\nSamuel Rogers the poet is, no doubt, a great wit; but he has a turn\r\nfor malice and even brutality. Someone once asked him why he never\r\nopened his mouth except to speak evil of his neighbours. He replied,\r\n\"I have a very weak voice, and if I did not say malicious things I\r\nshould never be heard.\" He lives with Lady Holland, and amuses himself\r\nby exacerbating her fears of illness and death. During the cholera\r\nepidemic Lady Holland was a prey to indescribable terrors. She could\r\nthink of nothing but precautionary measures, and on one occasion was\r\ndescribing to Rogers all that she had done. She numerated the remedies\r\nshe had placed in the next room--the baths, the apparatus for\r\nfumigation, the blankets, the mustard plasters, the drugs of every\r\nsort. \"You have forgotten the only thing that would be of any use,\"\r\nobserved Mr. Rogers. \"And what is that?\" \"A coffin,\" replied the poet.\r\nLady Holland fainted.\r\n\r\nCount Pahlen has returned from Paris. He saw the King privately one\r\nevening, not having with him the uniform necessary for a formal\r\npresentation. The King said he should like to see him at one of the\r\ngreat balls at the Palace, and, the Count having excused himself on\r\nthe score of having no uniform, the King replied, \"Never mind, come in\r\nan evening coat _as a member of the opposition_!\" As a matter of fact,\r\nM. de Pahlen went to the ball, which was splendid in a material sense,\r\nand found himself and a group of opposition deputies in plain clothes\r\namong the Diplomatic Corps, and what is called the Court who were all\r\nin uniform.\r\n\r\nPrince Esterhazy came to say good-bye yesterday. He was visibly moved\r\non leaving M. de Talleyrand, who, on his side, was hardly less so. One\r\ncannot part from anyone so old as M. de Talleyrand without a feeling\r\nof anxiety, and when an old man says farewell he does so with a kind\r\nof self-consciousness which is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nPrince Esterhazy is generally popular here, and will be justly\r\nregretted. Everybody wishes him very much to come back. The subtlety\r\nof his wit does not affect the uprightness of his character. The\r\nsureness of his manners is beyond praise, and in spite of a certain\r\ninformality in his bearing, and his ways of behaving, he never ceases\r\nto be a great nobleman.\r\n\r\n_London, May 18, 1834._--This week the King of England seems better.\r\nThe weather is not so hot, and his excitement has given place to a\r\nkind of exhaustion. He has often been seen with tears in his eyes.\r\nThis, too, is a sign of want of balance, but it is less alarming than\r\nthe irritability of last week.\r\n\r\n_Woburn Abbey, May 19, 1834._--This house is certainly one of the\r\nfinest, the most magnificent, and the greatest in England. The\r\nexterior is without interest; the site is low and, I think, rather\r\ndamp. English people, however, hate to be seen, and, to secure\r\nprivacy, are quite willing to dispense with an extended view. It is\r\nrare that a great house in England has any prospect but that of its\r\nimmediate surroundings, and you need not hope to amuse yourself by\r\nwatching the movements of the passers by, the travellers, the peasants\r\nworking in the fields, the villages or the surrounding country. Green\r\nlawns, the flowers round about the house, and splendid trees which\r\nblock all the vistas--these are what they love and what you find\r\nalmost everywhere. Warwick and Windsor are the only exceptions that I\r\nknow at present.\r\n\r\nThe party at present at Woburn are almost the same as those I met on\r\nmy first visit. There are Lord and Lady Grey with their daughter Lady\r\nGeorgina, Lord and Lady Sefton, Mr. Ellice, Lord Ossulston, the Duke\r\nand Duchess, three of their sons, one of their daughters, M. de\r\nTalleyrand and I.\r\n\r\nAll these people are clever, well educated and well mannered, but, as\r\nI observed before, English reserve is pushed further at Woburn than\r\nanywhere else, and this in spite of the almost audacious freedom of\r\nspeech affected by the Duchess of Bedford, who is a striking contrast\r\nto the silence and shyness of the Duke and the rest of the family.\r\nMoreover, in the splendour, the magnificence, and the size of the\r\nhouse, there is something which makes the company cold and stiff, and\r\nSunday, though it was not kept very strictly, and they made M. de\r\nTalleyrand sit down to cards, is always rather more serious than any\r\nother day in the week.\r\n\r\n_Woburn Abbey, May 20, 1834._--Our party has been increased by the\r\narrival of the Lord Chancellor. He talked to me of the great\r\naristocrats of the country, and said that _previous to Reform_ the\r\nDuke of Devonshire with his £440,000 sterling a year, his castles, and\r\nhis eight boroughs, was as powerful as the King himself. This\r\nexpression \"_previous to Reform_\" well expresses the blow which has\r\nbeen struck at the ancient constitution. I made Lord Brougham admit as\r\nmuch. He maintained that it was necessary, and though he began by\r\nsaying that he had only clipped wings which had become rather too\r\nlong, he ended by claiming that a _complete_ revolution had been\r\neffected without bloodshed. \"The great moment of our Revolution,\" he\r\nadded with evident satisfaction, \"was in 1831, when we dissolved the\r\nparliament which had dared to reject our Bill. The people is as\r\nimperishable as the soil, and all changes must in the end work for\r\ntheir benefit. An aristocracy which has lasted for five centuries has\r\nlasted as long as it can last!\" This was the point in his\r\nconversation which chiefly struck me, the more so as he commenced with\r\na sort of hypocrisy which evaporated sooner than mine. He began by\r\nsparing my aristocratic prejudices to some extent, and I returned the\r\ncompliment by sparing his passion for levelling. Five minutes more of\r\nour _tête-à-tête_ and he would have got to 1640 and I to 1660.\r\n\r\n_London, May 21, 1834._--They showed us a corner of the park at Woburn\r\nwhich I had forgotten. It is called the Thornery, because of the\r\nnumber of hawthorns which the enclosure contains. The blossom is very\r\ncharming just now, and there is a cottage in the middle which is quite\r\npretty.\r\n\r\nLord Holland told the Duke of Bedford that he should take us to\r\nAmpthill, which belongs to him and which lies only seven miles from\r\nWoburn. Lady Holland wanted us very much to see a fine portrait of\r\nherself as a Virgin of the Sun which is there, and which is, in fact,\r\nvery pleasing; it must have been very like her.\r\n\r\nThe house at Ampthill is gloomy, damp, ill-furnished, and ill-kept--a\r\nsad contrast with one of the most delightful parks you could see\r\nanywhere. It is not, however, without some associations of interest.\r\nKatherine of Aragon retired here after her divorce, but there is no\r\ntrace of the ancient castle which was on the mountains, and not at the\r\nbottom of the valley like the present house. A Gothic cross is placed\r\non the site of the ancient building, and on the base are inscribed\r\nsome bad verses, which have not even the merit of being contemporary,\r\ncommemorating the cruelties of Henry VIII. Another of the curiosities\r\nof the place is a number of trees so old that, in the time of\r\nCromwell, they were already past being used for shipbuilding. They\r\nhave quite lost their beauty, and will soon be like what in Touraine\r\nare called \"_truisses_.\"\r\n\r\nLord Sefton said yesterday in the presence of Lord Brougham that all\r\nQueen Caroline's defenders had risen to the highest positions in the\r\nState, and instanced Lord Grey, Lord Brougham, and others. On this, I\r\nsaid to the Chancellor that I supposed he would now be ready to admit\r\nthat his cause was a very bad one. But he would not admit it, and\r\ntried to convince us that if the Queen did have lovers, Bergami was\r\nnot among the number. He wished us to believe that he at least was\r\nconvinced of this, and in support of this assertion, which neither he\r\nnor anyone else took seriously, he told us that during the last three\r\nhours of the Queen's life, when she was quite delirious, she spoke\r\nmuch of Prince Louis of Prussia, of Victorine Bergami's child, and of\r\nseveral other people, but never once mentioned Bergami himself. I\r\nthought that for a great lawyer, this style of proof was much too\r\nnegative and inconclusive.\r\n\r\n_London, May 22, 1834._--On our return to town yesterday, we heard the\r\nnews of the Prince de Lieven's recall. This is a political event of\r\nsome importance; it is a very serious matter for London society. M. de\r\nLieven's excellent character, his cleverness and perfect manners won\r\nhim friendship and esteem everywhere, and Mme. de Lieven of all women\r\nis the most feared, respected, sought after, and courted. Her\r\npolitical importance, which was due to her wit and knowledge of the\r\nworld, went side by side with an authority in society which no one\r\ndreamed of questioning. There were complaints sometimes of her\r\ntyranny, of her exclusiveness, but she maintained in this way a useful\r\nbarrier between really good society and society of the second class.\r\nHer house was the most select in London, and the one the _entrée_ to\r\nwhich was the most valued. Her grand air, which was perhaps a trifle\r\nstiff, was most appropriate on great occasions, and I can hardly\r\nimagine a Drawing-room without her. Except Lord Palmerston, who has\r\nbrought it about by his obstinate arrogance, in the matter of Sir\r\nStratford Canning, I am sure that no one is glad at the departure of\r\nM. and Madame de Lieven. M. de Bülow, however, is perhaps also rather\r\nrelieved to be freed from the surveillance of the Princesse. The part\r\nhe had to play before her was never a simple or an easy one.\r\n\r\nM. de Lieven's appointment as Governor of the young Grand Duke may\r\nflatter and console him, but it can hardly give her much pleasure, and\r\nshe will not care much for the frigidity and emptiness of St.\r\nPetersburg after twenty-two years spent in England amid political\r\nexcitements of all kinds.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the three Northern Courts, in opposition to the\r\nSouthern Quadruple Alliance are disposed to conclude a separate\r\nengagement with Holland. Little is being said, but arms are being\r\nsharpened in silence.\r\n\r\nThe Cortes is summoned for July 24. The telegraphic news from Spain,\r\nwhich arrived the other day, only caused a flutter on 'Change and\r\nevaporated pitiably enough. I hear from Paris that General Harispe has\r\nbeen requested not to telegraph in future anything that is doubtful,\r\nand that the President of the Council has been made to promise not to\r\nspread news of this kind before it is confirmed.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Roussin has refused the Ministry of Marine. There was some\r\nquestion of appointing Admiral Jacob. M. de Rigny left the Council\r\nquite free to appoint him either Minister of Marine or Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs. The decision is not yet known.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of the departure of the Lievens, the Princesse tells me\r\nthat some weeks ago when Lord Heytesbury came back from St.\r\nPetersburg, Lord Palmerston said to M. de Lieven that he intended to\r\nappoint Sir Stratford Canning as Ambassador. The Prince de Lieven\r\nwrote to his Government, and M. de Nesselrode replied in the name of\r\nthe Emperor that the violent temper and unaccommodating disposition,\r\nand, indeed, the whole character of Sir Stratford, were personally\r\ndisagreeable to him and that he desired that someone else might be\r\nsent--anyone but Sir Stratford. Lord Palmerston then explained his\r\nreasons for wishing to overcome this opposition, and M. de Lieven\r\npromised to lay them before the Emperor. The next day he sent a\r\ncourier with despatches to this effect to St. Petersburg, but the\r\ncourier had hardly embarked before the nomination of Sir Stratford\r\nCanning as Ambassador at St. Petersburg appeared in the _London\r\nGazette_. This piece of discourtesy confirmed the Russian opposition\r\non the one hand, and the obstinacy of Lord Palmerston on the other.\r\nThe English Cabinet claimed to nominate whom it pleased to diplomatic\r\npositions, and the Emperor Nicolas, without contesting its right to do\r\nso, claimed an equal right on his part to receive only whom he\r\npleased. The breach widens, and the opposition of the two political\r\nsystems, coupled with the antagonism of individuals, makes one fear\r\nthat in the present complicated state of international politics peace\r\nis neither well established nor likely to last for long.\r\n\r\n_London, May 23, 1834._--I believe the Cabinet is embarrassed by M. de\r\nLieven's departure, and that Lord Grey is personally very sorry. Lord\r\nBrougham also seems to feel how regrettable it all is. I have long\r\nletters on the subject from them both, which are very interesting and\r\nwhich I shall carefully preserve.\r\n\r\nM. de la Fayette is dead. Though he had all his life never given M. de\r\nTalleyrand cause to like him, his death has not been indifferent to\r\nthe Prince. At eighty-four and upwards it must seem that all one's\r\ncontemporaries are one's friends.\r\n\r\n_London, May 24, 1834._--Lord Grey has just paid me a long and very\r\nfriendly visit. He was much grieved at the departure of the Lievens,\r\nbut was at pains to refute the opinion that the rudeness of Lord\r\nPalmerston was the cause. I could see that he was most anxious that\r\nthe germs of controversy between M. de Talleyrand and Lord Palmerston\r\nshould not develop. He could not have shown more personal goodwill to\r\nus than he did.\r\n\r\nWe dined at Richmond with the poor Princesse de Lieven, who is really\r\nmuch to be pitied. I fear that things are really much worse for her\r\nthan they seem. I think that she flatters herself that she will be\r\nable to keep up with things both by reason of the confidence of the\r\nEmperor and the friendship of M. de Nesselrode, as also through the\r\nfavour enjoyed by her brother, General de Benckendorff. I fear,\r\nhowever, that she will soon lose touch with the map of Europe, or that\r\nshe will only be able to look at it through some very small spy-hole,\r\nwhich would certainly be for her a living death. Her hopes and her\r\nregrets are all expressed with naturalness and vivacity, and she\r\nseemed to me even nicer than usual, for she was keeping nothing back,\r\nand was quite simple and unconstrained. Such communicativeness in\r\npersons usually reserved always produces a specially striking\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nThe abominable article about her in the _Times_, which is really a\r\ndisgrace to the country, made her weep at first. She confessed that\r\nshe was deeply hurt to think that these were the farewell words\r\naddressed to her by the people of a country which she was leaving with\r\nso much regret. But she soon felt that nothing could be more\r\ndespicable or more generally despised. In the end she recovered her\r\nequanimity so completely that she described in her best manner (which\r\nis very good indeed) a ridiculous scene in which the Marquis de\r\nMiraflorès played a prominent part. This little creature, whom I have\r\nalways considered an insupportable idiot, but whose face pleased Mme.\r\nde Lieven as it certainly did not please me, came and sat beside her\r\nat a Ball at Almacks. The Princess having asked him whether he were\r\nnot struck with the beauty of the English girls, he replied with a\r\nsentimental air, a voice full of emotion, and a long and significant\r\nlook, that he did not like women too young, and preferred those who\r\nhad ceased to be so and whom people called _passée_.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent has a really remarkable talent for giving offence\r\nwhenever it is possible to do so. To-day is her daughter's birthday,\r\nand she was to have taken her for the first time on this occasion to\r\nWindsor, where there was to be a family party in honour of the\r\noccasion. Owing to the death of the little Belgian Prince, who was\r\nless than a year old, and whom neither his aunt nor his cousin had\r\never even seen, the Duchess decided not to grace this mild festivity\r\nwith her presence. Nothing could have annoyed the King more.\r\n\r\n_London, May 25, 1834._--King Leopold seems disposed to call his\r\nnephews to the succession to the Belgian Throne. Does this mean that\r\nhe has ceased to count on direct descendants? They are annoyed about\r\nit at the Tuileries, but I fancy that no one minds very much anywhere\r\nelse, as the new kingdom and the new dynasty are not taken very\r\nseriously as yet.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of pictures at Somerset House is very mediocre, even\r\nworse than last year's. The sculpture is worse still. The English\r\nexcel in the arts of imitation, but are behind everybody in those\r\nwhich require imagination. This is one of the most conspicuous results\r\nof the absence of sun. Surrounded as they are by masterpieces from the\r\nContinent British artists produce nothing which can be compared with\r\nthese! All colour is lost in the fog which envelops them.\r\n\r\n_London, May 26, 1834._--Lord Grey's Ministry is on the verge of\r\nbreaking up, owing to the resignations of Mr. Stanley and Sir James\r\nGraham, which are threatened if he makes further concessions to the\r\nIrish Catholics at the expense of the Anglican Church. If he refuses\r\nthese concessions in order to keep Mr. Stanley, whose parliamentary\r\ntalents are of the first order, the Cabinet will probably find\r\nthemselves in a minority in the House of Commons, and the fall of the\r\nwhole Ministry will be the result. This, at least, is what was being\r\nsaid and believed yesterday, and Lord Grey's careworn face at Lord\r\nDurham's dinner-party, and some remarks which Lady Tankerville, with\r\n_naïve_ silliness, let fall, gave ample confirmation to the rumour.\r\nThe question will be settled to-morrow (Tuesday the 27th) on the\r\noccasion of Mr. Ward's motion.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven has not concealed from me her hope that, if the\r\nCabinet changes, either wholly or in part, and if Lord Palmerston is\r\namong those who go out, there may be a chance of her staying here. She\r\nflatters herself that the first act of the new Foreign Secretary would\r\nbe to ask the Russian Government that M. de Lieven might not be\r\nremoved. In these circumstances, she added, she would count on the\r\ninfluence of M. de Talleyrand with the new Minister, whoever he might\r\nbe, to persuade him to take this step.\r\n\r\n_London, May 27, 1834._--It is a curious thing that Marshal Ney's son,\r\nwho is in London, should wish to be presented at the Court of England\r\nwho abandoned his father when they might have saved him. It is also\r\ncurious that he should wish to get himself presented by M. de\r\nTalleyrand, who was Minister when the Marshal was arrested and tried,\r\nand that his presentation should take place on the same day as that of\r\nM. Dupin, who was his father's defender, and that all this should\r\nhappen in the presence, as it were, of the Duke of Wellington who,\r\nwithout departing in the least from the terms of the capitulation of\r\nParis, might have protected the prisoner, but did not think fit to do\r\nso. The young Prince de la Morkowa doubtless failed to make these\r\nreflections, but M. de Talleyrand knew very well that others would\r\nmake them for him, that they would be unpleasant for everyone\r\nconcerned, and by no means least for the young man himself. He,\r\ntherefore, declined to make the presentation on the ground that the\r\ninterval between his receiving the request and the date of the\r\npresentation was too short to fulfil the necessary formalities.\r\n\r\nYesterday, at seven o'clock in the evening, I received an interesting\r\nnote from a confidential friend of the Prime Minister: \"Nothing has\r\nchanged since yesterday, and there is no improvement in the situation.\r\nWe shall spend to-night in trying to keep the question open, that is\r\nto say, to keep it from being regarded as a Cabinet question, and to\r\nleave everyone free to vote as he likes. The Lord Chancellor is trying\r\nhard to secure the adoption of this expedient, but Lord Grey, who is\r\nevidently anxious to resign, may very likely wreck the plan.\"\r\n\r\n_London, May 27, 1834._--After much agitation and uncertainty Lord\r\nGrey has decided to let Mr. Stanley and Sir James Graham leave the\r\nMinistry; their example will probably be followed by the Duke of\r\nRichmond and Lord Ripon. Lord Grey remains, taking the side of Mr.\r\nWard's motion. For a moment his better instincts suggested that he\r\nshould resign, but Mr. Ellice, under whose influence he is at present,\r\npushed him in the other direction, and the Chancellor was urgent with\r\nthe King, who begged Lord Grey to remain.\r\n\r\nYesterday Ministers were singing the King's praises with tears in\r\ntheir eyes. The poor King, in spite of his scruples of conscience, has\r\nsupported Reform, so the Lord Chancellor says he is a great King and\r\njoyfully adds, with that verbose intoxication which is so\r\ncharacteristic of him, that yesterday was the second great day in the\r\nannals of the beneficent English Revolution. This strange,\r\nundignified, unconventional Chancellor dined with us yesterday. He is\r\ndirty, cynical and coarse, drunk both with wine and with words, vulgar\r\nin his talk and ill-bred in his habits. He came to dine with us\r\nyesterday in a morning coat, ate with his fingers, tapped me on the\r\nshoulder and conversed most foully. Without his extraordinary gifts of\r\nmemory, learning, eloquence and activity no one would be more anxious\r\nto have done with him than Lord Grey. I do not know any two characters\r\nmore diametrically opposed. Lord Brougham who was wonderful in the\r\nHouse of Commons is a constant source of scandal in the Lords where he\r\nturns everything upside down. He, the Chancellor, is often called to\r\norder! He is always embarrassing Lord Grey by his eccentricities; in\r\nshort he is wholly out of his element, and I believe that he would be\r\nonly too glad to bury the whole Peerage with his own hands.\r\n\r\nYesterday we had M. Dupin at dinner to meet him, another of the\r\ncoarser products of the age. He is loud and sententious as becomes a\r\npublic prosecutor, and he has a heavy plebeian vanity which is always\r\nin evidence. The first thing he said to the Chancellor, who remembered\r\nmeeting him some years before, was, \"Oh yes, when we were both at the\r\nbar.\"\r\n\r\nLord Althorp, in the House of Commons yesterday, asked that Mr. Ward's\r\nmotion might be adjourned in order that the Government might have time\r\nto fill the gaps left by the resignation of several members of the\r\nCabinet. This was agreed to.\r\n\r\nNo one can understand what inspires the Duchess of Kent's continued\r\nill-feeling against the Queen. In spite of the Duchess's refusal to\r\ntake the Princess Victoria to Windsor, the Queen wished to go to\r\nKensington to see her the day before yesterday evening. The Duchess\r\nof Kent refused, on some trifling pretext, to receive Her Majesty, who\r\nwas much hurt. Nobody can understand what motive there can be for such\r\nconduct. Lord Grey yesterday attributed it to Sir John Conroy, the\r\nDuchess's Gentleman-in-Waiting, who is said to be very ambitious, very\r\nnarrow-minded, and very powerful with the Duchess. He thinks that if\r\nthe Duchess became Regent he will be called upon to fill a great\r\nposition, which he is even now anticipating. He imagines that he has\r\nbeen insulted in some way or other by the Court of St. James's, and\r\nhis revenge is to sow discord in the Royal family. I heard of the\r\nlatest scene at Kensington from Dr. Küper, the Queen's German\r\nChaplain, who, on leaving Her Majesty yesterday morning, came to tell\r\nme how unhappy the good woman is about it. Lord Grey, to whom I was\r\ntalking about it at dinner, told me that King Leopold, when he left\r\nEngland, had told him that he was very sorry to leave his sister under\r\nsuch a bad influence as that of Sir John Conroy, but that, as the\r\nPrincess Victoria was fifteen and would be of age at eighteen, the\r\nDuchess would either not be Regent at all or would be so only for a\r\nvery short time.\r\n\r\n_London, May 29, 1834._--Princess Victoria as yet only appears at the\r\ntwo Drawing-Rooms which celebrate the respective birthdays of the King\r\nand Queen. I thought at yesterday's (which, by the way, lasted more\r\nthan three hours, and at which more than eighteen hundred people\r\npassed the Presence) that this young Princess had made great progress\r\nin the last three months. Her manners are perfect, and she will one\r\nday be agreeable enough to be almost pretty. Like all Royalties, she\r\nwill have acquired the art of standing for a long time without fatigue\r\nor impatience. Yesterday we all collapsed in turn, except the wife of\r\nthe new Greek Minister, whose religion accustoms her to remain\r\nstanding for long periods. She stood the ordeal very well, being\r\nfurther supported by curiosity and by the novelty of her surroundings.\r\nShe is astonished at everything, asks the strangest questions, and\r\nmakes naïve observations and mistakes. Thus, seeing the Lord\r\nChancellor pass in his State robes and full-bottomed wig, and\r\ncarrying the embroidered purse containing the Great Seal, she took him\r\nfor a bishop carrying the Gospels, an error which, in the case of Lord\r\nBrougham, was particularly comic.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Princesse de Lieven, for the first time, appeared in the\r\nRussian national dress which has just been adopted at St. Petersburg\r\nfor State occasions. This costume is so noble, so rich, and so\r\ngraceful that it suits any woman, or rather it suits no woman ill. The\r\nPrincess's dress was particularly well planned and showed her off\r\nwell, as the veil concealed the thinness of her neck.\r\n\r\nNothing else was talked of yesterday at Court and elsewhere but the\r\nresignation of four members of the Ministry, which deprives it of much\r\nof its moral force. This is particularly so in the case of Mr. Stanley\r\nbecause of his great talents, and in the case of the Duke of Richmond\r\nbecause of his great position. The Conservatives are much pleased,\r\ntheir ranks being increased and those of their adversaries, if not\r\nnumerically diminished, at least very ill-filled. Lord Mulgrave, Lord\r\nEbrington, Mr. Abercromby, and Mr. Spring Rice are spoken of for the\r\nCabinet, but nothing is settled yet.\r\n\r\nAt the big Diplomatic dinner for the birthday, which took place at the\r\nhouse of the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston had for the first time\r\ninvited ladies, and sat between the Princesse de Lieven and myself. He\r\nwas chilly on the right and breezy on the left, and obviously ill at\r\nease, though his embarrassment was not at all increased by the fact\r\nthat he was not in his drawing-room ready to receive the ladies as\r\nthey arrived, but came in afterwards without making the slightest\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin is being very well treated here by all that is brilliant and\r\nexalted in society, and likes it so much that he is quite out of\r\nconceit with Paris. He considers that the Court at the Tuileries is\r\nwanting in dignity, that the women are not well enough dressed there,\r\nthat the company is too much mixed, and that King Louis-Philippe is\r\nnot _Royal_ enough! What with dinners and drawing-rooms, receptions\r\nat Court, routs, concerts, the Opera, races, &c., M. Dupin is\r\nlaunched on a course of dissipation which will make a grotesque dandy\r\nof him; and the result, if I am not mistaken, will astonish Paris.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven is fond of talking about the late King George IV. She\r\ntells me that he hated common people so much that he never showed the\r\nleast civility to M. Decazes, whom he saw only on one occasion--when\r\nhe presented his credentials. As to Madame Decazes, as he held no\r\ndrawing-room while she was in London, he avoided receiving her at all,\r\nand he could not be persuaded to grant her a private audience or to\r\nask her to Carlton House. He behaved with almost equal incivility to\r\nthe Princesse de Polignac, the obscurity of whose English origin was\r\nan offence to him. As to Madame Falk, the reason why she never saw the\r\nlate King is even more curious. Madame Falk's exuberant Flemish charms\r\nare so well developed that they alarmed Lady Conyngham as being likely\r\nto be too much to the King's liking, and she always succeeded in\r\npreventing her from being received.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin was so much struck by the magnificent apparel of the ladies\r\nof the English Court that he made a remark to me on the subject, which\r\nis really amusing. \"The Queen of the French should lay down a rule\r\nabout Court dress; this would impose on the _bourgeois vanity_, which\r\nin our country is always wishing to show itself at Court, the tax of\r\nan expensive dress.\"\r\n\r\n_London, May 30, 1834._--The Portuguese ratifications of the treaty of\r\nQuadruple Alliance have come in at last. They are however inexact and\r\nincomplete. The whole preamble of the Treaty is passed over in\r\nsilence. It is difficult to believe that this is not due rather to\r\nmalignity than inadvertence. The Attorney General was summoned to the\r\nForeign Office to discover some device which would make the exchange\r\npossible. Nothing could be found to which there was not some\r\nobjection, but Lord Palmerston was inclined to carry out the exchange\r\nleaving the preamble on one side. This would deprive the Treaty of its\r\nmoral force--perhaps the only kind of force which it possesses. The\r\ndecision on this point will not be reached until this morning.\r\n\r\nI have often heard it said that there is no one more astute than a\r\nmadman; something I have just heard makes me think that this is true.\r\nReplying to the congratulations of the Bishops on the occasion of his\r\nbirthday, the King assured them with tears in his eyes that as he felt\r\nhimself an old man and near the time when he must render up his soul\r\nto God, he did not wish to charge his soul with the guilt of wronging\r\nthe Church and would support with all his strength the rights and\r\nprivileges of the Anglican Clergy. This remark was made the very day\r\nthat His Majesty pressed Lord Grey to remain and to allow Mr. Stanley\r\nto resign.\r\n\r\nLast night the rearrangement of the Ministry was not completed. What\r\nseems to me certain is that no one wants Lord Durham. They say he is\r\nin an indescribable state of fury. Lady Durham, whom he has treated\r\nwith great cruelty as he does every time he is angry with Lord Grey,\r\nfainted yesterday while dining with her mother, and her husband did\r\nnot even turn his head to look at her.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Lansdowne who has quite lately spoken in Parliament in\r\nfavour of the Church, may very well also retire from the Cabinet. It\r\ndepends on what happens next Monday in the House of Commons. When she\r\nheard this, Lady Holland went in all haste to Lord Brougham's to tell\r\nhim that she should consider Lord Lansdowne's resignation a great\r\nmisfortune which should be avoided at all costs. The Chancellor who\r\nhas no liking for Lord Lansdowne's moderation replied that for his\r\npart he thought it would be a very good thing and that he would do all\r\nhe could to bring it about. Thereupon Lady Holland got angry and\r\nenumerating the merits of her friend asked Lord Brougham if he had\r\nconsidered all that Lord Lansdowne represented. \"Oh yes,\" was the\r\nanswer, \"I know that he represents all the old women in England.\"\r\n\r\n_London, May 31, 1834._--The English Ministry is rearranged, but none\r\nof its characteristics are any more distinct than they were before.\r\n\r\nBy means of declarations and reservations it has been found possible\r\nto proceed with the exchange of ratifications with Portugal.\r\n\r\nI think that this week's work is a poor performance indeed and that\r\nits results in the future will be no better.\r\n\r\n_London, June 1, 1834._--Yesterday I met the Ministers who were\r\nleaving office and those who were coming in. The former seemed to me\r\nhappier than the latter and I think they had reason.\r\n\r\nLady Cowper in spite of her subtle and delicate wit is both nonchalant\r\nand naïve. This makes her say things which are startling in their\r\nexcessive frankness. Thus she said to Madame de Lieven yesterday\r\nmorning, \"I assure you that Lord Palmerston regards you as an old and\r\npleasant acquaintance whom he is very sorry to lose, that he is quite\r\naware of all your husband's excellent qualities, and that he knows\r\nthat Russia could not be more worthily represented than by him. But\r\nyou see that that is the very reason why England must profit by your\r\ndeparture.\" Madame de Lieven was no less struck by the sincerity of\r\nthe avowal than annoyed by its implication.\r\n\r\nLady Cowper rather thoughtlessly also showed her a letter from Madame\r\nde Flahaut in which, after expressing some polite regret at the recall\r\nof M. de Lieven, she lamented the choice which had been made of a\r\n_chargé d'affaires_. He was, she said, a venomous and wicked little\r\nwasp, fiercely Russian in sentiment, a savage enemy of Poland, and to\r\nsum all up in one word a cousin german of Madame de Dino, which she\r\nadded is very much against the interest of England whose one object\r\nmust be to keep Russia and France apart.\r\n\r\nFor the rest it is said that Pozzo is delighted that my cousin Medem\r\nis leaving Paris. He has always praised him and treated him well, but\r\nperhaps Paul's direct and intimate relations with M. de Nesselrode had\r\nbegun to embarrass Pozzo. I don't believe it however.\r\n\r\nYesterday, while dining with Lord Holland, M. Dupin showed rather too\r\nmuch of the legislator. Poor Lord Melbourne, especially, who was half\r\nabsent and half asleep, was bored with a long dissertation on divorce\r\nwhich was all the more out of place as his wife, who had for long been\r\na source of great trouble to him, has just died insane and under\r\nrestraint. Lord Holland, who makes friends easily with all those whom\r\nhe does not wish to hang for their political opinions, told me that he\r\ndisliked M. Dupin very much, and that he had all the bad points of\r\nLord Brougham with none of his extraordinary ability and versatility.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of the Chancellor I hear bad accounts of his character. For\r\ninstance it was Lord Holland who forced the Duke of Bedford's hand and\r\nso got him into Parliament. For four years thereafter Lord Brougham\r\nnever set foot in Lord Holland's house. When he did call he did so for\r\nno apparent reason, without embarrassment and without excuses. The\r\nChancellor's leading gift is his ready memory and presence of mind\r\nwhich enable him to have at hand at a moment's notice all the facts\r\nand arguments relevant to the subject of his speech. Thus Mr. Allen\r\nsays of him that he has always a legion of devils of all colours ready\r\nto obey him, and that of these he is himself the chief. Lord Holland\r\nsays that no scruple can stop him. Lady Sefton told me in confidence\r\nthe other day that as a friend he was neither sincere nor faithful.\r\nLady Grey says outright that he is a monster and it is in this way\r\nthat every one talks who is intimate with him or belongs to the same\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n_Hylands, June 2, 1834._--The Republicans are annoyed with M. de la\r\nFayette for choosing as his burying-place the aristocratic cemetery of\r\nPicpus. They are also angry because there were so many priests at the\r\nmortuary chapel to receive the body. A hogshead of earth from the\r\nUnited States was placed in the grave. _A propos_ of M. de Lafayette,\r\nI have several times heard M. de Talleyrand tell how he went to his\r\nhouse with the Marquis de Castellane, another member of the\r\nConstituant Assembly, early on October 7, 1789, to propose some\r\narrangements for the safety of Louis XVI., who had been taken to the\r\nTuileries the night before. They found Lafayette, after the terrible\r\ntwo days which had passed, calmly having his hair done!\r\n\r\nHere at Hylands we are with M. Labouchere, an old and kind friend. The\r\nplace is very cheerful, and distinguished for its wonderful flowers\r\nand vegetables. M. Labouchere, who is a cosmopolitan sort of person,\r\nhas collected about him many souvenirs of travel, but Holland is the\r\nmost conspicuous; and he takes most pains with his flower-beds, on\r\nwhich he spends a great deal of money.\r\n\r\n_Hylands, June 3, 1834._--A note from Lord Sefton, written yesterday\r\nfrom the House of Lords before the end of the sitting, the result of\r\nwhich we do not yet know, informs me that the Commission of Inquiry on\r\nthe Church of Ireland, which Lord Althorp has proposed, will not\r\nsatisfy the demands of Mr. Ward and his party. Mr. Stanley and Sir\r\nJames Graham scoff at the Commission, and intend to move the previous\r\nquestion. Sir Robert Peel holds back; Lord Grey is very low, and the\r\nKing is quite ready either to support him or to send for another\r\nMinister. Pressed by the difficulties of the situation, he has neither\r\nprinciples nor affections, and in this he shares what I believe to be\r\nthe position common to all Kings.\r\n\r\n_London, June 4, 1834._--It seems that Dom Miguel is _hors de combat_,\r\nand is on the point of giving in and quitting the Peninsula. I gather\r\nthat the signatories of the Quadruple Alliance attribute his\r\nsubmission to the news of the signing of their treaty. If this be so,\r\nthe moral effect is all the more satisfactory, as the material result\r\nwould probably not have been great.\r\n\r\nIn the English Parliament Mr. Ward declined to be satisfied with the\r\nCommission of Inquiry. Lord Althorp moved the previous question,\r\nsupported by Mr. Stanley--who made an admirable speech on the\r\ninviolability of Church property--and by all the Tories. The previous\r\nquestion was adopted by a large majority. It cannot be pleasant for\r\nthe Ministry that this vote is due only to their enemies, for whom it\r\nis a triumph, and to the four Ministers who have resigned. The real\r\nopinion of the Cabinet, the different combinations which have divided\r\nit and ruled its actions--all this is so confused and complicated that\r\nit is difficult to understand what really is the idea which governs\r\nits jerky and inconsequent mode of progression.\r\n\r\nIn the Commons Lord Palmerston has denounced the principle upheld by\r\nLord Lansdowne in the Upper House, where every one was surprised to\r\nsee a known Socinian[16] like him speak in favour of the clergy. In\r\nthis matter all is contradictory. Lord Grey has wavered hesitatingly\r\namong all the combatants, not exalting one party, not urging on the\r\nothers. He is shouldered, jostled, and pushed about by everybody, and\r\nhe emerges in a battered condition from the _mêlée_. If in his\r\nfriends' eyes he is still a decent, honest sort of person, in the eyes\r\nof the public he is now only a feeble old man--an exhausted Minister.\r\n\r\n  [16] A follower of Socinus, who disbelieved in the Trinity and in\r\n  the Divinity of Christ.\r\n\r\nLady Holland usually does everything that other people avoid. She went\r\nto a window in Downing Street to observe the Members of Parliament who\r\nwent to Lord Althorp's meeting two days ago in order that she might\r\nspeculate with more accuracy about each. Her speculations are rarely\r\ncharitable. She thinks that she palliates her inconceivable egotism by\r\nflaunting it without shame; she exploits other people without mercy\r\nfor her own benefit, and treats them well or ill according to\r\ncalculations more or less personal. She never allows any one else's\r\nconvenience to stand in her way. The most one can do is to credit her\r\nwith a few good qualities, and even these are based on some interested\r\nmotive. When her caprices and her _exigence_ has worn out the patience\r\nof her friends, she tries to regain their favour by the most abject\r\ncondescension. She abuses the false position she holds in\r\nsociety--with which well-bred people are careful not to reproach\r\nher--in order to conquer and oppress them. The position she has is, it\r\nmust be admitted, the best proof of her ability. In her time she has\r\ndone the most unheard-of things, and she has been forgiven everything.\r\nFor instance, she gave out that her eldest daughter was dead in order\r\nnot to be forced to surrender her to her first husband, and when she\r\nhad ceased to care for this child she brought her back to life again,\r\nand to prove that she was not buried she had the grave opened, and the\r\nskeleton of a goat was found in the coffin. This is going a little too\r\nfar! However, she is a social despot in her own numerous circle. The\r\nreason of this is, perhaps, that she does not try to force herself on\r\nany one, and that she may be said rather to rise superior to prejudice\r\nthan to struggle against it. M. de Talleyrand keeps her very well in\r\nhand, and is becoming the avenger of all her acquaintance. Every one\r\nis delighted when Lady Holland is a little mishandled, and no one\r\ncomes to her assistance, Lord Holland and Mr. Allen as little as any\r\none.\r\n\r\nLady Aldborough came one day to Lady Lyndhurst and asked her to be so\r\nkind as to find out from her husband, who was then Chancellor, what\r\nsteps she should take in an important case. Lady Lyndhurst refused, in\r\nthe rude and vulgar manner which is characteristic of her, to\r\nundertake to obtain the required information, adding that she never\r\ninterfered in such tedious matters. \"Very true, my Lady,\" answered\r\nLady Aldborough, \"I quite forgot that you are not in the civil line.\"\r\nLady Aldborough is witty, and what she says is brilliant, even when\r\nshe speaks French. She is often a trifle too bold and free-spoken.\r\nThus, when she heard how the Princesse de Léon had been burned to\r\ndeath, and when some one said that the Prince had been more of a\r\nbrother to his wife than a husband, Lady Aldborough exclaimed, \"What!\r\nVirgin as well as Martyr! Ah! that is too much.\"\r\n\r\nThe condition of the English Cabinet is very curious. Sir Robert Peel\r\nsaid in the House that he couldn't understand it at all; and this\r\nbeing so, every one else's ignorance may well be excused. What is\r\nclear to everybody is that if no member of the Cabinet is absolutely\r\ndestroyed they are all wounded, some say mortally. That they are\r\nenervated is evident. I am sorry for it for Lord Grey's sake, for I am\r\nreally attached to him; in the rest I have not the slightest interest.\r\nLord Palmerston will not restore their credit. M. de Talleyrand may\r\nsay what he likes. He may have a gift for the despatch of business;\r\nhe may speak and write French well; but he is a rude and presumptuous\r\nperson, his behaviour is arrogant, and his character not upright. Each\r\nday some new and more or less clear proof of his duplicity comes to\r\nlight. For instance, how is it that, while Lord Grey is arguing loudly\r\nagainst King Leopold's plan for choosing himself a successor, and\r\nwhile Lord Palmerston seems to be of the same mind, the latter is\r\nwriting privately to Lord Granville in support of the King's idea?\r\nThis constantly embarrasses the Ambassadors in their relations with\r\nhim, and above all puts M. de Talleyrand in a very painful position.\r\n\r\n_London, June 5, 1834._--The Duc d'Orléans writes to me, without any\r\nprompting on my part and without any obvious motive, a letter of which\r\nthe point seems to lie in the following phrase, which appears to be\r\nintended to show that he does not approve of the conduct of his\r\nfather's ministers: \"I consider there is already a reassuring sign in\r\nthis disposition to limit party quarrels to an electoral college and\r\nto wage war by manifesto alone. May this tendency in time eliminate\r\nthe system of brute force, which I regret to see nowadays in all\r\nparties, and which is the favourite argument not only of the\r\nopposition but also of those in power!\" I think there is good sense\r\nand good feeling in this reflection.\r\n\r\nIf the Duc d'Orléans had good counsellors I should have confidence in\r\nhis future. He is intelligent, brave, graceful, well-educated, and\r\nenergetic. These are excellent gifts in a Prince, and, matured by age,\r\nthey might make him a good king. But those about him, both men and\r\nwomen, are so commonplace and small-minded! Since the death of Madame\r\nde Vaudémont there is no one of any distinction or nobility of mind or\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLady Granville has given a ball in Paris in honour of the birthday of\r\nthe King of England. She had the gallery filled with orange-trees, and\r\nthe company waltzed round them. Lamps were placed behind the flowers,\r\nso that there was very little light in the room. Nothing could be more\r\nfavourable to private conversation. Eight thieves dressed to\r\nperfection came in through the garden, but such a large number of\r\nunknown men attracted attention, and notice was taken of it too soon.\r\nThey saw that they had been observed, and made good their escape.\r\nTheir intention seems to have been to snatch the women's diamonds when\r\nthey had gone into the garden, which was to be illuminated.\r\n\r\n_London, June 6, 1834._--The English Cabinet, so feebly reorganised,\r\ndoes not hold its head very high; all the honours are with the\r\nseceding Ministers. Lord Grey is under no illusions, and is by no\r\nmeans proud of the great majority of last Monday; for, as one of his\r\nfriends said to me: \"This majority is not the result of affection for\r\nMinisters; it is due merely to fear that the Tories will come in and\r\ndissolve Parliament.\" Nothing, I think, can be truer. For the rest,\r\nthe Cabinet already feels the need of strengthening. They say that\r\nLord Radnor, a friend of the Chancellor's and a Radical big gun, will\r\nbe made Lord Privy Seal.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that Dom Miguel and Don Carlos are really leaving the\r\nPeninsula, the one for England, the other for Holland.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de la Moskowa having persisted in his desire to be\r\npresented, was presented yesterday, along with the Prince d'Eckmühl.\r\nTheir desire was so strong that they tried to get Mr. Ellice to\r\npresent them in the absence of M. de Talleyrand, as if that were\r\npossible, apart from its being objectionable! Really, young Frenchmen\r\nhave no idea how to behave, and Mr. Ellice, whose gentility is of\r\nrecent growth, had lent himself to this pretty scheme!\r\n\r\nLord Durham and Mr. Ellice are called here, comically enough, \"the\r\nBear\" and \"the Pasha.\"\r\n\r\n_London, June 7, 1834._--Lucien Bonaparte has at last reappeared here,\r\nand is addressing the French electors from London. After his manifesto\r\nto the Deputies last year he disappeared for several months, and is\r\nsaid to have visited France secretly during the recent troubles at\r\nLyons and Paris. His new letter is more turgid than ever, and even\r\nmore full of literary affectations than the first; is in other ways a\r\nmost abject production and in very bad taste.\r\n\r\nLucien, whom I had never seen before his arrival in England, as he was\r\nin disgrace with the Emperor, was said to be at least as able as his\r\nbrother, and to have more decision of character. I have heard it said\r\nthat it was he who saved Napoleon on the 18th Brumaire, and, in fact,\r\nI had heard him greatly praised. My actual meeting with him, as often\r\nhappens, did not come up to my expectations. He seemed to me cringing\r\nin his manners and false in his look. He is like Napoleon in the\r\noutward shape of his features--not at all in expression. I saw him\r\nlast year, at a concert at the Duchesse de Canizzaro's, beg her to\r\nintroduce him to the Duke of Wellington, who was present. I saw him\r\ncross the room, and come up bowing and scraping to be presented to the\r\nvictor of Waterloo, whose reception was as cold as such baseness\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nAs I live in a London house[17] celebrated for the great robbery\r\nsuffered by the old Marchioness of Devonshire, who is its owner, and\r\nfor a ghost which appeared to Lord Grey and his daughter during their\r\ntenancy, I will relate here what Lord Grey and Lady Georgiana have\r\noften told me in the presence of witnesses--Lord Grey quite seriously\r\nand circumstantially, Lady Georgiana with repugnance and hesitation.\r\nIt seems, then, that Lord Grey was crossing the dining-room on the\r\nground floor, whose windows look into the square, to go to his own\r\nroom. He had a light in his hand, and he saw behind one of the pillars\r\nby which the room is divided a pale face, which appeared to be that of\r\nan old man, though the eyes and hair were very black. Lord Grey at\r\nfirst started back, but on raising his eyes he again saw the same face\r\nstaring at him fixedly, while the body seemed to be hidden behind the\r\npillar. It disappeared as soon as he moved forward. He searched, but\r\nfound nothing. There are two small doors behind the pillars and a\r\nlarge mirror between them, so there may well be some natural\r\nexplanation of the apparition. Lord Grey, however, denies that it was\r\neither a burglar or the reflection of his own face in the glass. As a\r\nmatter of fact, at that time his hair was fair and his eyes are blue.\r\nHowever that may be, he told his family next morning at breakfast what\r\nhe had seen the night before when he was going to bed. Lady Grey and\r\nher daughter thereupon exchanged glances with a meaning look, and Lord\r\nGrey asked what they meant. They told him that they had concealed the\r\nthing from him till then for fear of being laughed at, but that one\r\nnight Lady Georgiana had been awakened by feeling some one breathe on\r\nher face. She opened her eyes, and saw the face of a man bending over\r\nher. She shut them, thinking she was dreaming, but when she opened\r\nthem again the face was still there. She screamed, and the face\r\ndisappeared. She then jumped out of bed and rushed into the next room,\r\nlocking the door behind her, and threw herself half dead with fright\r\non the bed of her sister, Lady Elizabeth. Lady Elizabeth wanted to go\r\nand examine the haunted room, but Lady Georgiana would not allow her.\r\nNext day the windows, doors, and bolts were found in good order, and\r\nwhat she had seen was pronounced to be a ghost, though the fact that a\r\nflat piece of roof comes close up under one of the windows might\r\nsuggest even to the credulous that some footman in love with one of\r\nthe maids was the hero of this nocturnal adventure.\r\n\r\n  [17] No. 21 Hanover Square, the French Embassy of the period.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the house has a very bad reputation. I sleep in the room\r\nfrom which Lady Devonshire's diamonds were stolen, and my daughter in\r\nthat in which Lady Georgiana's ghost appeared. When we came to the\r\nhouse there were actually people who thought us astonishingly brave!\r\nAt first the servants were afraid to go about the house at night\r\nexcept in couples. To be quite frank, the conviction with which Lord\r\nGrey and his daughter described their experiences made me also a\r\nlittle uncomfortable--a feeling which did not wear off for some time.\r\n\r\nWe have been here nearly three years, and nothing has been stolen and\r\nthere has been no apparition. Yet once, when we were away in France,\r\nand when the door of my room was locked, the housemaid, the porter,\r\nand the maids swore that they heard a violent ringing of a bell, the\r\ncord of which is at the foot of my bed. They said that they went to\r\nthe room and found the door locked as it should have been, and when\r\nthey opened it they could find no explanation of the noise. They tried\r\nto make me believe that the bell rang on July 27, 1832, at the very\r\ntime of my accident at Baden-Baden. A mouse was probably the real\r\ncause of this incident.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Lord Grey's father had a similar and very curious\r\nexperience; and that Lord Grey himself, besides the Hanover Square\r\nghost, saw one at Howick, which was even more remarkable, but of which\r\nhe does not care to speak. Of course, this being so, I have not asked\r\nany questions about it, but several versions of what happened are in\r\ncirculation, and the thing has lent itself to caricature.\r\n\r\n_London, June 8, 1834._--Lord Radnor's extravagant pretensions have\r\nput an end to the idea of admitting him to the Ministry. They are now\r\nsaid to be thinking of Lord Dacre, whose appointment would, it is\r\nbelieved, be satisfactory to the Dissenters. The Privy Seal, which is\r\nheld provisionally by Lord Carlisle, is destined for the newcomer.\r\n\r\nWhen I called yesterday on Madame de Lieven she had just received\r\nletters from St. Petersburg which have at last made clear what her new\r\nposition in Russia is to be. It seems to me to promise well. Instead\r\nof being a puppet at Court and groaning under the burden of perpetual\r\nceremonial, the Princess is to have a house of her own. The Emperor\r\nwishes that his son shall learn there to know society and how to\r\nconverse and conduct himself in the world.\r\n\r\nThis plan is set forth with infinite tact and kindness in a letter\r\nfrom the Empress, which is very happily expressed, perfectly natural,\r\nand full of cleverness and affection. Of course it has become a great\r\ninterest and a great consolation to Madame de Lieven. She sees herself\r\npossessed of a direct influence on affairs, and in a position as\r\nindependent as is possible in Russia. Her imagination is busy\r\ndeveloping and improving this new sphere for her energies, and I must\r\nsay in justice to her that her projects have not a trace of\r\nchildishness or small-mindedness. She knows exactly what she wants to\r\ndo, and the lines of her scheme are broad and well thought out. The\r\npleasure she derives from the importance of her prospective position\r\nwas evident, but anything else would have been hypocritical, and I was\r\npleased that she did not think it necessary to pretend to sentiments\r\nshe did not feel before me. Her great desire is to render the young\r\nGrand Duke the immense service of accustoming him to great and exalted\r\ncompany, to make her house sufficiently distinguished and sufficiently\r\nagreeable to accustom every one, including the Emperor and Empress, to\r\nenjoy there the pleasures of conversation rather than amusements for\r\nwhich they are perhaps growing too old. Her ambition is to restore to\r\nthe Russian Court the splendour and the intellectual culture which\r\nwere its glory under the Great Catherine. She hopes in this way to\r\nattract foreigners by exciting their curiosity and providing it with a\r\nworthy object. All this fully occupies the Princess, who has it in her\r\nto play this part well, though it would be difficult anywhere, and is\r\ndoubly so in Russia, where thought is as much fettered as speech.\r\n\r\nThere was a reasonableness and a delicacy in the letters both of the\r\nEmpress and M. de Nesselrode which accords with all I hear of the Czar\r\nNicolas and which augurs well for the result of this second education\r\nof the heir to the throne of ice. I was particularly glad to see that\r\nthe frankness with which Madame de Lieven had expressed her regret at\r\nleaving England had been well received. She said to me _à propos_ of\r\nthis, \"It proves to me that one can be sincere in our country without\r\nbreaking one's neck.\" I hope that she may find more and more reason to\r\nthink so, but it will be necessary to keep this sincerity in cotton\r\nwool for some time to come.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to me with great admiration of the Emperor as a man with\r\ngreat gifts who is destined to become the greatest figure in\r\ncontemporary history. On this I repeated to her a remark made by M. de\r\nTalleyrand with which she was much pleased. This is what he said:\r\n\"The only Cabinet which has not made a single mistake during the last\r\nfour years is the Russian Cabinet, and do you know why that is so? The\r\nRussian Cabinet is never in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen of England has shewn Madame de Lieven on the occasion of her\r\nrecall much of the kindness which is natural to her, though it must be\r\ndifficult for her Majesty to forget how little respect the Princess\r\nshowed her during the life of George IV. and that of the Duke of York,\r\nand above all how discourteous the patronesses of Almack's with Madame\r\nde Lieven at their head were to her on the only occasion she was there\r\nwhen she was still Duchess of Clarence. I have even on one occasion\r\nheard the Queen remind Madame de Lieven of this incident in such a way\r\nas greatly to embarrass her. However all these old quarrels are\r\nforgotten, and when the leave-taking came the Queen's conduct was\r\nperfect. As to the King it is different; he has never even said either\r\nto M. or Madame de Lieven that he was aware that they had been\r\nrecalled. They blame Lord Palmerston and I don't think they are far\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n_London, June 9, 1834._--Yesterday I found the Duchess-Countess of\r\nSutherland very busy getting together twenty ladies to join in\r\noffering Madame de Lieven some tangible token of the regret felt at\r\nher departure by the ladies of her particular acquaintance. This idea\r\nis particularly English, for the spirit of association is everywhere\r\nin this country and enters even into matters of compliment and\r\ncivility. I thought that the Princess could not but be pleased and\r\nflattered, and I was delighted to add my name to the list. Ten guineas\r\nis the subscription and I believe the testimonial will take the shape\r\nof a fine bracelet inside which our names will, if possible, be\r\ninscribed.\r\n\r\nM. de Montrond has returned from Paris. His wit is as ready and as\r\ncutting as ever, and, though he is certainly anything but a bore, I\r\nagain feel with him the uneasiness which one has in the presence of a\r\nvenomous creature with a poisonous sting. The charm which used for a\r\nlong time to fascinate M. de Talleyrand is gone and has left behind a\r\nsense of fatigue and oppression which is the more felt as their long\r\nstanding friendship and the remembrance of their past intimacy hardly\r\npermit them to make an end of it.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything new in what M. de Montrond tells me of\r\nParis. He speaks of the King's ability; no one contests it. It is\r\nequally well known that the King is always talking, and always of\r\nhimself. M. de Montrond complains of the complete destruction of\r\nParisian Society, of the spirit of division which is breaking up\r\neverything and which does not decrease. He gives amusing accounts of\r\nthe embarrassments of the Thiers family, of the high diplomatic\r\nambitions of Marshal Soult for his son, of the alarm of Rigny and\r\nothers at the kind of effect produced here by M. Dupin. They think\r\nthat it is ominous of a future premiership and are almost angry with\r\nM. de Talleyrand for showing him attention. They do not see that M.\r\nDupin's reception here is only a compliment to us, he being a man who\r\nis less fitted than any one in the world to shine in good English\r\nsociety, and that our object is merely to turn the turgid stream of M.\r\nDupin's eloquence in favour of the English alliance of which he is a\r\nbitter opponent.\r\n\r\nI found Lord Grey yesterday in a state of depression which he did not\r\nattempt to disguise. It is a contagious malady, and seems to have\r\nattacked all his adherents. Lord Grey's lassitude and weariness is to\r\nmy thinking the most alarming symptom of the weakness of the Cabinet\r\nas now constituted. Lord Durham's attacks on Lord Grey in the _Times_\r\nwound him deeply. Conservatives and Radicals are alike speculating on\r\nthe succession of the Whigs, and it is impossible to disguise the fact\r\nthat this is a critical moment for every one.\r\n\r\nWhile talking yesterday to a friend I remembered that when I was\r\nseventeen, I, like many other women of the period in Paris, was\r\nromantic or silly enough to consult Mlle. Lenormand who was then much\r\nin vogue, taking what I thought sufficient precautions not to be\r\nrecognised by her. One had to fix the day and the hour beforehand and\r\nthis I arranged through my maid giving a false name and address. She\r\ngave me an appointment and on the day named I went with my maid in a\r\ncab, taken at a distance from my abode, to the Rue de Tournon where\r\nthe sorceress lived. The house was of good appearance and the rooms\r\nclean and even rather pretty. We had to wait till a gentleman with\r\nmoustaches had left the chamber where the Sibyl delivered her oracles.\r\nI made my maid go in first and my turn came next. After some questions\r\nabout the month, day and hour of my birth, and about my favourite\r\nanimal, flower and colour, and about the animals, flowers and colours\r\nwhich I particularly disliked, she asked whether she should make the\r\ngreat or the little cabala for me, the price being different. At last\r\nshe came to my fortune and told me what follows. I may have forgotten\r\nsome insignificant details but I give the main part of what she\r\npredicted, and I have since repeated it to several persons, my mother\r\nand M. de Talleyrand among the number.\r\n\r\nShe said that I was married, that I had a spiritual bond with an\r\nexalted personage (my explanation of this is that the Emperor was my\r\neldest son's godfather), that after much pain and trouble I should be\r\nseparated from my husband, that my troubles would not cease till nine\r\nyears after this separation, and that during these nine years I should\r\nexperience all manner of trials and calamities. She also said that I\r\nshould become a widow when no longer young but not too old to marry\r\nagain which I should do. She saw me for many years closely allied with\r\na person whose position and influence would impose on me a kind of\r\npolitical position and would make me powerful enough to save some one\r\nfrom imprisonment and death. She said also that I should live through\r\nvery difficult and stormy times, during which I should have very\r\nexciting experiences, and that one day even I should be awakened at\r\nfive o'clock in the morning by men armed with pikes and axes who would\r\nsurround my house and try to kill me. This danger would be the\r\nconsequence of my opinions and the part I was destined to take in\r\npolitics and I should escape in disguise. I should still be alive,\r\nshe said, at sixty-three. When I asked whether that was the destined\r\nend of my days she answered, \"I don't say you will die at sixty-three,\r\nI only mean that I see you still alive at that age. I know nothing of\r\nyou or your destiny after that.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading circumstances of this prediction seemed to me then too\r\nmuch out of the probable course of events to cause me any anxiety. I\r\ntold my friends about it as a sort of joke, and, though the most\r\nimprobable parts of it have come true, such as my separation from my\r\nhusband, my prolonged troubles, the interest in public affairs which\r\nM. de Talleyrand's concern with them has imposed on me, I confess that\r\nunless some one has mentioned some similar matter, I think very rarely\r\nabout what Mlle. Lenormand told me, and very little of herself though\r\nshe was a remarkable person. She seemed to be over fifty when I saw\r\nher. She was rather tall and wore a loose, black, trailing gown. Her\r\ncomplexion was ugly and confused, her eyes were small, bright and\r\nwild; her countenance, coarse and yet uncanny, was crowned with a mass\r\nof untidy grey hair. The whole effect was unpleasant, and I was glad\r\nwhen the interview was over.\r\n\r\nI thought of her prophecies in July 1830, when I was alone at\r\nRochecotte surrounded by conflagrations, and was receiving the news of\r\nwhat was happening in Paris, and when I saw General Donnadieu's\r\nregiments marching past my windows on La Vendée where it was thought\r\nCharles X. would go. I heard some denouncing the Jesuits whom they\r\nwere silly enough to accuse of setting fire to their houses and\r\nfields, and others crying out against \"malignants\" such as I. The Curé\r\ncame to my house for refuge and the Mayor asked whether I did not\r\nthink that the soutane, which according to him reeked of brimstone,\r\nshould be turned out of the commune. Already I saw myself surrounded\r\nby pikes and axes, and escaping as best I could disguised as a\r\npeasant. I escaped then, but I have sometimes said to myself that it\r\nwas only a postponement and that I should not get off in the end.\r\n\r\n_London, June 10, 1834._--Lord Dacre, who was to have joined the\r\nMinistry, has had a fit and fallen from his horse which puts him out\r\nof the question. They are now thinking of Mr. Abercromby for the Mint\r\nwith a seat in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nYesterday we had at dinner M. Dupin, the young Ney and Davoust, M.\r\nBignon and General Munier de la Converserie. If to speak ill of every\r\none is to praise one's self M. Dupin did it to perfection. He treated\r\nwith the utmost scorn the King and his Ministers and every man and\r\nwoman in Paris. Some are mean, dowdy chatterboxes, others are robbers,\r\nsmugglers, I know not what. Immorality was castigated and justice\r\nbrandished her flaming sword. M. Piron, the cicerone and the very\r\nhumble servant of M. Dupin, multiplied his formulæ of adulation. What\r\nhe chiefly praised was the lucid and detailed manner in which the\r\ngreat man had explained to the English Ministers the embarrassment and\r\ndanger of their position. I think they would have been equally obliged\r\nif he had not crossed the sea to tell them what they know only too\r\nwell already.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I had to endure the honeyed insincerity of M. Bignon. He\r\nreminded me of Vitrolles' cloying and inferior manner, he is rather\r\nlike him in face, distinctly like him in his talk and above all in his\r\nbearing. I think however, that M. de Vitrolles' conversation is more\r\nvivacious, and his imagination more brilliant. As yesterday was the\r\nfirst time I have spoken to M. Bignon it would be wrong to judge him\r\non one conversation, but one cannot fail to be struck with his calm\r\nand submissive manner which at once puts one on one's guard.\r\n\r\n_London, June 11, 1834._--Mr. Abercromby's appointment was in last\r\nnight's _Globe_. We shall see if this will mollify the tone of the\r\n_Times_ which ill-treated poor Lord Grey shamefully yesterday morning.\r\n\r\nAmong the many sayings of M. de Talleyrand here is one which is very\r\ngood and not much known. M. de Montrond was saying to him last year\r\nthat Thiers was a good sort of man and not so impertinent as you would\r\nexpect from a parvenu. \"I will tell you the reason,\" replied M. de\r\nTalleyrand: \"c'est que Thiers n'est pas _parvenu_, il est _arrivé_.\" I\r\nfear that this remark is too subtle to be altogether true, but that is\r\nthe fault of M. Thiers. Impertinence is becoming a familiar method\r\nwith him. Since his marriage he has been living in a kind of\r\nsolidarity with the smallest sort of people, ill reputed pretentions,\r\n_parvenus_ assuredly and not _arrivés_. It is impossible, in spite of\r\nthe floods of wit with which he deluges the mud which surrounds him,\r\nthat he should not be bespattered if not smothered. It is really a\r\ngreat pity.\r\n\r\n_London, June 12, 1834._--At Holland House yesterday I heard a story\r\nof how the Abbé Morellet complained to the Marquis of Lansdowne that\r\nat the Revolution he lost his pensions and his benefices though he had\r\nwritten and spoken so much on the Revolutionary side, and of how the\r\nMarquis answered: \"My dear sir, how can you be surprised, there are\r\nalways a few wounded in the victorious armies.\"\r\n\r\n_London, June 13, 1834._--There is a rumour that Dom Miguel has\r\nescaped and that a conspiracy has broken out at Lisbon against Dom\r\nPedro; all kinds of sinister details are added. This, it seems, is\r\nnothing but a Stock Exchange trick, the truth being that there were\r\nsome unpleasant demonstrations against Dom Pedro when he showed\r\nhimself at the play. The simultaneous expulsion of both the rivals\r\nwould be the most satisfactory conclusion of the great drama.\r\n\r\nThere is some surprise that Dom Miguel has not yet disembarked in\r\nEngland. Don Carlos arrived yesterday at Portsmouth in the _Donegal_.\r\n\r\nSpain is annoyed, and with reason, because the Duke of Terceira and\r\nthe English Commissioner who made Dom Miguel sign an undertaking not\r\nto return did not exact a similar promise from Don Carlos. They now\r\nwish England and France to take measures against Don Carlos so as to\r\nmake him an outlaw in Europe. This however is not admissible, in spite\r\nof the notes of the Marquis de Miraflorès and the diatribes of Lord\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at Holland House is very curious. Little Charles\r\nBarrington was there the other day and said he had been prevented from\r\nriding a donkey because it was Sunday and because religious people\r\ndidn't ride donkeys on Sunday. Mr. Allen grunted in reply, \"Never\r\nmind: the religion is only for the donkeys themselves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spring Rice has just been elected at Cambridge, but by a small\r\nmajority, which is by no means pleasant for the Ministry.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Halford, M. Dedel and the Princesse de Lieven came back from\r\nOxford yesterday, moved, enchanted, intoxicated by the festivities on\r\nthe occasion of the installation of the Duke of Wellington as\r\nChancellor of the University. This occasion is really in its way\r\nunique. The Duke's character and his past career--it is only four\r\nyears since he would have been stoned at Oxford for having passed\r\nCatholic emancipation--the magnificence of the ceremony, the number\r\nand the quality of the company, the immemorial traditions of the\r\nscene, the excitement of everybody, the unanimous applause--everything\r\nin fact was wonderful and the like will never be seen again. Even the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, universally unpopular as he is, was well received\r\nthere. The Anglican spirit was in the ascendant, all personal\r\nanimosities vanished in the presence of the dangers with which the\r\nChurch is threatened, and this secured a favourable reception for\r\nevery one who is believed to be ready to rally to her defence. In the\r\nDuke of Wellington it was less the great Captain whom they were\r\ncheering than the Defender of the Faith.\r\n\r\nIt is annoying to record that the undergraduates used the licence\r\ngranted to them on such occasions to hoot the names of Lord Grey and\r\nothers, which they called out loudly in order to have the pleasure of\r\nhissing them. The Duke of Wellington, on every occasion of their\r\noccurrence, showed that these demonstrations displeased him, but in\r\nspite of these signs of his disapproval they were several times\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThey say that when the Duke shook hands with Lord Winchelsea, on whom\r\nhe had just conferred the Doctor's degree, every one recollected the\r\nduel which had once taken place between the two, and that this gave\r\nrise to a storm of cheering. The applause, however, was not less when\r\nLord Fitzroy Somerset approached the Duke, his faithful friend and\r\ncomrade, and being unable to give him his right hand, which he lost at\r\nWaterloo, extended his left. But what excited the greatest and most\r\nprolonged enthusiasm was an ode addressed to the Duke, the two final\r\nlines of which were as follows:\r\n\r\n    Till the dark soul a world could not subdue\r\n    Bowed to thy genius, chief of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nAt this point the whole audience rose spontaneously; the cries, the\r\ntears, the acclamations were thrilling; and, as Madame de Lieven said:\r\n\"The Duke of Wellington may die to-day, and I may depart in peace\r\nto-morrow, for I have been present at the most marvellous scene that\r\nthere has been during the twenty-two years that I have spent in\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n_London, June 14, 1834._--A German _improvisatore_ named Langsward has\r\nbeen recommended to me by Madame de Dolomieu. I had to gather together\r\nin his honour all the people here (few enough) who know a little\r\nGerman. The entertainment was not bad. There were _bouts rimés_, which\r\nhe filled up very creditably; some verses about Inez de Castro; and,\r\nlater on, a prose piece--a scene of lower-class Viennese life--which\r\nshowed real verve and talent. The talent for poetic improvisation\r\nalmost always indicates faculties of an unusual order. This is the\r\ncase even with Southern people, whose language is naturally very\r\nharmonious. Poetic inspiration is a proportionately greater\r\nachievement in the less flexible accents of Northern countries. Still\r\n_improvisatori_, even Sgricci, have always seemed to me more or less\r\nfrigid or more or less absurd. Their enthusiasm is overdone and false;\r\nthe close rooms in which they are confined inspire neither the poet\r\nnor his audience. Nothing in them or their surroundings is in the key\r\nof poetry. I think that if you are to produce an enthusiasm which\r\nwill really gain every one you must have a landscape for your stage,\r\nthe sun to light you, a rock for seat, a lyre for accompaniment, for\r\nyour subject great and immediate events, and a whole nation for\r\naudience. Corinna if you like, Homer above all! But a gentleman in a\r\ndress-coat in a little London drawing-room, posturing before a few\r\nwomen who are trying to get away to a ball, and a few men, of whom\r\nhalf are thinking of the Belgian protocols and the other half of Ascot\r\nraces, can never be more than a trifling little rhyming doll who is\r\ntedious and quite out of place.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven showed me yesterday a letter from M. de Nesselrode,\r\nin which he complains of the ill-will and the troublesome, teasing\r\nmanner of Lord Ponsonby, who, he adds, is goading the poor Divan to\r\nfury. Admiral Roussin appears charming by comparison.\r\n\r\nDom Miguel has really embarked, and is going to Genoa.\r\n\r\n_London, June 15, 1834._--Dom Pedro is hardly relieved of his\r\nbrother's presence and free of the supervision of the Cortes, and he\r\nhas already begun to destroy convents, monks, and nuns. I do not know\r\nwhether this, too, will excite admiration at Holland House, but to me\r\nit seems a piece of impious folly which may well bring speedy\r\nrepentance in its train.\r\n\r\nThe Rothschilds, who are by way of knowing everything, have been to M.\r\nde Talleyrand to say that the Marquis de Miraflorés has just left for\r\nPortsmouth to take money to Don Carlos on condition of his signing\r\nguarantees similar to those given by Dom Miguel.\r\n\r\nM. Bignon, the day he dined at Lord Palmerston's, when M. de\r\nTalleyrand was there, said to the latter that he wished to have a word\r\nwith him, and with a mysterious and confidential air, added: \"Now that\r\nI have dined with Lord Palmerston they can no longer say at Paris that\r\nI can't be Minister.\" This curious piece of reasoning was followed by\r\na series of indiscreet criticisms of the French Cabinet and\r\nexpressions of surprise that overtures of the same kind had not been\r\nmade to M. de Talleyrand by M. Dupin. Nothing assuredly can be more\r\npresumptuous than this spirit, whether it takes the supple and\r\ncringing form of M. Bignon or the didactic and crude shape of M.\r\nDupin.\r\n\r\n_London, June 16, 1834._--_A propos_ of M. Dupin, when his mother died\r\nsome time ago, at Clamecy en Nivernais, he had cut on her tomb, \"_Here\r\nlies the mother of the three Dupins._\"\r\n\r\nThere are some good stories here of him and the amiable Piron, his\r\ncicerone. Mr. Ellice one day took them both to see some sight or other\r\nin London. In the carriage M. Dupin unfolded a large-checked pocket\r\nhandkerchief, very vulgar in design, and holding it some distance from\r\nhis face, spat into it, aiming very precisely at the middle of the\r\nhandkerchief. On this M. Piron said to him aloud, with a very knowing\r\nair, \"Sir, in this country one does not spit in public.\"\r\n\r\nThe choice of Mr. Fergusson for a high legal appointment gives an even\r\nmore Radical tinge to the English Cabinet. Lord Grey, almost without\r\nknowing it, has thus been dragged to the verge of an abyss, into which\r\nhis weakness is thrusting him, but from which all his instincts and\r\nnatural tendencies hold him back. Lord Brougham boasts that he has set\r\neverything right; Lord Durham, on the contrary, says (no doubt in\r\norder to prepare the way for himself) that it is he alone who has\r\npersuaded all the new recruits to join. Meanwhile he has retired to\r\nhis villa near London, whence he declares, \"I have made Kings and\r\nrefused to be one myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Conyngham is, they say, to go to the Post Office and\r\nnot to have a seat in the Cabinet. His selection is a social matter,\r\nwith which politics, it appears, have very little to do.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond has accepted an invitation to the High Tory\r\ndinner to be given on the 22nd to the Duke of Gloucester. The Duke of\r\nWellington, who has sworn never to go to the City again after their\r\nshameful conduct to him in 1830, refused, and did not conceal the\r\nreason. And yet the Lord Mayor is not the same as in 1830, and\r\nprobably the Duke would now have a most flattering reception. However,\r\nhe has taken an oath and will not break it.\r\n\r\nMr. Backhouse, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has been\r\nsent to Portsmouth to hold himself at the disposition of Don Carlos on\r\nevery point except that of offering him money. This reserve seems to\r\nbe the only way of assisting the negotiations which are being\r\nconducted by the Marquis de Miraflorès, who is himself commissioned to\r\noffer the Infante, on behalf of his Government, an annual allowance of\r\n£20,000 sterling, on condition of his entering into obligations\r\nsimilar to those contracted by Dom Miguel. It is thought that the\r\nabject poverty to which the Prince himself, his wife and children, the\r\nDuchess of Beïra, seven priests, and a suite of ladies (seventy-two\r\npersons in all), who are with him in the _Donegal_, are reduced, will\r\nsmooth the course of the discussion. It is said that they have not so\r\nmuch as a change of linen. It is not known what Don Carlos's plans\r\nare. Some say that he wants to retire to Holland; others say Vienna;\r\nothers again talk of Rome. This last idea seems to be peculiarly\r\nunpleasing to the present Government in Spain, but no one has the\r\nright to dictate a choice.\r\n\r\nM. de Palmella is expected here quite soon. He says he is coming on\r\nprivate business, but it is generally supposed that it is in order to\r\nconcert measures for getting rid of Dom Pedro, whose absurd behaviour\r\nis displeasing every one. Then would be the time to choose a husband\r\nfor Doña Maria da Gloria, and the opportunity, perhaps, of bringing\r\nout this young Princess who is still somewhat elephantine in her\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston, with his usual courtesy, sent Mr. Backhouse to\r\nPortsmouth without so much as mentioning the matter to M. de\r\nTalleyrand, who only heard of it by public rumour. This led to a\r\ncandid little conversation between Lord Grey and me. No one, it must\r\nbe admitted, is better, more frank, more sincere or better intentioned\r\nthan the Prime Minister. I am always as much touched by his good\r\nqualities as a man as I am struck by his incompetence as a politician.\r\nHe ran downstairs after me at his house to exculpate Lord Palmerston,\r\nto assure me that he had no ill-intention, and to beg me to make\r\nexcuses for him to M. de Talleyrand. I replied to him with the old\r\nFrench proverb to the effect that hell is paved with good intentions,\r\nand added in English, \"Well, I promise you to tell M. de Talleyrand\r\nthat Lord Palmerston is as innocent as an unborn child, but I don't\r\nbelieve a word of it.\" This made Lord Grey laugh, and he took what I\r\nsaid in excellent part as he always does.\r\n\r\n_London, June 17, 1834._--Don Carlos refused to see M. de Miraflorès\r\nand would receive no one but Mr. Backhouse, whom he gave to understand\r\nthat he would not accept a penny if he had to sign away the smallest\r\nfragment of his rights. He commissioned M. Sampaïo, formerly Dom\r\nMiguel's Consul in London, to find him a house at Portsmouth, where he\r\nwants to rest for a fortnight, and thereafter one near London, where\r\nhe will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe British Government attributes Don Carlos's refusal to a credit of\r\na million, which they are convinced has been opened on the Prince's\r\nbehalf with M. Saraiva, Dom Miguel's former Minister here. They even\r\nsay that the credit was opened for him by the Duc de Blacas, which is\r\nvery unlikely. The Bishop of Leon, who is said to be a bad man but\r\nclever after the fashion of a Spanish monk, is with the Infante, and\r\nis the leading spirit and the brain of this exiled Court.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Conyngham, son of George IV.'s celebrated favourite,\r\nhas been definitely appointed to succeed his brother-in-law, the Duke\r\nof Richmond, as Postmaster-General. He is a young and good-looking man\r\nof fashion with many love affairs, who writes and receives more\r\n_billets-doux_ than serious letters, and is therefore called \"the\r\nPostmaster of the twopenny post.\"\r\n\r\n_London, June 18, 1834._--At all meetings of ladies there is always\r\nmuch confusion and controversy, so, in spite of the presidency of the\r\nDuchess-Countess of Sutherland, there have been many discussions and\r\nhesitations over the bracelet which is to be presented to Madame de\r\nLieven. Some ladies have retired from motives of economy, others\r\nbecause the affair was not put under their charge; thirty remain. The\r\nchoice of the jewels and the fashion of the setting have also given\r\nrise to difficulties. Opals are not to be thought of; the Princess\r\ndislikes them. Rubies are too expensive. Turquoises come from Russia;\r\nto give them would be to send coals to Newcastle. The same applies to\r\namethysts, and as to sapphires, the Princess already has magnificent\r\nsapphires of her own. \"Emeralds perhaps.\"--\"No.\"--\"Yes.\"--\"Well\r\nperhaps----.\"--\"Why not?\"--\"It won't be what I expected.\"--\"Peridots\r\nare so common.\"--\"Let's ask the Princess herself.\" This in the end is\r\nwhat we did; the mystery was revealed, the surprise abandoned, and a\r\nlarge pearl chosen.\r\n\r\nThen came another question, more literary and more delicate in\r\ncharacter, the question of the dedicatory inscription. The committee\r\nwished it to be in English, so, as a foreigner, I retired. They kindly\r\nexpressed regret, but of course I persisted and remained as a mere\r\nspectator. It was very amusing. Twenty ways of putting the inscription\r\nwere tried. Poetry and allegory were suggested. Some wished for a play\r\nof words suggesting that a pearl had been chosen because the Princess\r\nwas a pearl among women. Others thought that the image was not\r\nsufficiently precise; they wanted some allusion to be made to the\r\nPrincess's talent for affairs, a suggestion which was declared out of\r\norder. There was the further difficulty of putting on record the names\r\nof the donors without offending other ladies in society. So I was\r\nconsulted. I said that I didn't know enough English to have an\r\nopinion. They asked what I should put if it were in French. I told\r\nthem, and, weary of the struggle, they decided to translate it into\r\nEnglish and adopt it. The wording is very simple: \"Testimony of\r\nregard, regret and affection presented to the Princess Lieven on her\r\ndeparture, by some English ladies of her particular acquaintance, July\r\n1834.\"\r\n\r\n_London, June 19, 1834._--Madame de Lieven called on me yesterday\r\nmorning. Her agitation grows as her departure draws nearer, and\r\ncarried away by a sort of feverish excitement which consumes her, she\r\nsaid to me that she was sure there was one person besides Lord\r\nPalmerston who was glad she was going, and that was the King of\r\nEngland. He had refused to write an autograph letter, which while\r\nsaving the Minister's face, might have reversed the decision as to M.\r\nde Lieven's recall. Palmerston had lectured the King on the objections\r\nto foreign ambassadors staying too long in London, where they became\r\ntoo much at home, and even came to acquire a real and important\r\ninfluence. In short, the King is delighted at Madame de Lieven's\r\ndeparture, and she blames Palmerston for it, which does not increase\r\nher partiality for him. She may find some consolation in thinking of\r\nthe abyss which is opening at his feet. The whole Ministry is as shaky\r\nas possible; and Lord Palmerston is the least secure of them all. His\r\ncolleagues think little of him. Lord Grey does not deny that his\r\nspeeches in the House of Commons are bad. The _Corps diplomatique_\r\ndetest his arrogance. English people think him ill-bred. His one\r\nmerit, when all is said and done, seems to consist in his remarkable\r\nfacility for speaking and writing French. The Lievens' departure,\r\nwhich every one, and most certainly Lord Grey regrets, is so generally\r\nattributed to Lord Palmerston's impudent obstinacy that no one even\r\npretends to conceal his conviction that this is the case, not even\r\nLord Palmerston's colleagues in the Ministry. Thus he is never invited\r\nto the numerous farewell dinners and parties which are being given to\r\nthe Lievens, and this is the more remarkable, as of course Lady Cowper\r\nis always there. This has not failed to give him great offence, and he\r\nhas especially resented Lord Grey's attitude. The latter has made a\r\nmerit of this with Madame de Lieven, saying to her, on one occasion:\r\n\"You see I have got all your friends and haven't asked Palmerston.\"\r\nPoor Lady Cowper gets the benefit of all Lord Palmerston's ill-humour,\r\nand they say he is very unkind to her.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Saxe-Meiningen has arrived by the King's invitation to\r\nescort the Queen, his sister, during her German tour. Her departure,\r\nis fixed, they say, for July 4, but the King is pressing her to go on\r\nthe 2nd, and he is so strangely anxious to hurry her away, having made\r\nall the arrangements himself, that many people think that he will not\r\nbe in such haste to let her come back. No one doubts that he expects\r\nto enjoy himself very much in his renewed bachelorhood, and every one\r\ntrembles to think of the kind of enjoyment he may fancy. The nature of\r\nhis pleasures, no less than the type of person he is likely to ask to\r\nshare them, is a source of anxiety to decent people. There is no doubt\r\nthat he has singular projects in his head, for the other day at\r\ndinner, he shouted out to an old admiral, who had been a great friend\r\nof his long ago, to ask \"whether he was as great a rascal as ever.\"\r\nThe admiral answered that the days of his follies were over; but the\r\nKing replied, \"_that for his part he meant to begin again!_\"\r\n\r\nA letter from M. Royer-Collard is always an event for me: in the first\r\nplace, because I am very fond of him; and, secondly, because he says\r\nso much in so few words, in a striking way, and in a tone which is\r\nentirely individual, and gives much food for thought. Here is an\r\nextract from one which I have just got; it is quite true and yet\r\nmalicious in a well-bred way: \"He [Thiers] is very clever; what he\r\nwants is Society and the experience which Society alone can give, a\r\nlittle dignity and a little _principle_. As I write this it comes into\r\nmy mind that you will take me for a doctrinaire, which would be very\r\nunjust, for principle is a weakness which doctrinaires don't\r\ncultivate.\"\r\n\r\n_London, June 20, 1834._--Intercepted letters show that the Duke of\r\nLeuchtenburg, weary of the tumult caused by the design of the Duchess\r\nof Braganza's sister to marry him to Doña Maria, asked the Duchess to\r\ndo no more in the matter, as too much suspicion had been aroused and\r\nsuccess was impossible. At the same time he begged his sister not to\r\nforget their young brother Max, who has not been suspected, and who\r\nmight have a better chance. Now that this new plan is revealed it\r\nwill probably be as keenly opposed as the ex-Empress's first intrigue.\r\nThey say she is extraordinarily energetic and ambitious, though to\r\noutward view she is all quietness, amiability, and simplicity.\r\n\r\nLast night, in our drawing-room, the conversation turned on the\r\ncharacter and position of Mirabeau, and I heard M. de Talleyrand\r\nrepeat a curious story. It appears that at the time of the Restoration\r\nhe was entrusted during the Provisional Government with the most\r\nconfidential of the Revolutionary archives, and that he found among\r\nthem a receipt in due form, given by Mirabeau for a sum of money\r\nreceived from the Court. This receipt was made out in detail, and\r\nstated precisely the services which Mirabeau undertook to perform. M.\r\nde Talleyrand added that in spite of this financial transaction it\r\nwould be unjust to say that Mirabeau was \"bought,\" and that in\r\naccepting the price of promised services he did not surrender his\r\nindependent opinion. He wished to serve France as much as to serve the\r\nKing, and reserved for himself liberty of thought and action as well\r\nas liberty of choice of means to bring about the object which he\r\nengaged to realise. It follows that, without deserving the extreme\r\nimputations of baseness and vileness which some have made against him,\r\nMirabeau's moral character was very far behind his astuteness. He\r\nbelonged to a bad stock; his father, his mother, his brother and\r\nsister were all either insane or criminal. Yet in spite of his\r\nexecrable reputation, of his being regarded everywhere much as a\r\nconvict let out of prison, of his hideous ugliness and constant lack\r\nof money, what a marvellous influence his very memory has! The book\r\njust published by his adopted son brings out very strikingly the power\r\nof his prodigious personality and the charm of his superabundant\r\nvitality, which imposes itself upon you in spite of the tedious\r\nformality with which the author has sought to adorn his subject. The\r\nauthenticity of the sources, the abundance of quotations from the\r\noriginal, and their extraordinary interest, often make up for the\r\nawkwardness and heavy-handedness of the execution.\r\n\r\nThe book, moreover, has for me the great merit of enlightening my\r\nignorance. I had only the vaguest ideas on the subject of Mirabeau,\r\nowing to my very imperfect knowledge of the Revolutionary period,\r\nwhich is too near my own time for me to have studied it historically,\r\nand which is yet too far off for me to have known it as a\r\ncontemporary. All I know is derived from M. de Talleyrand's stories\r\nand the Memoirs of Madame Roland. Besides, I have such a horror of\r\nthis repulsive and terrible epoch that I have never had the courage to\r\nthink much about it, and have almost always leapt hurriedly across the\r\nabyss which separates 1789 from the Empire. M. de Talleyrand's Memoirs\r\nmight no doubt have helped me, but I have always been too much\r\noccupied with his individual fortunes to pay much attention to the\r\ngeneral situation. M. de Talleyrand in the Memoirs is much clearer\r\nabout the causes of the catastrophe than about its details, and he was\r\nout of France during the most critical years. His sojourn in America\r\nis one of the most agreeable episodes in his career, and for the\r\nreader--as indeed it was in reality for himself--it is a period of\r\nrest and relief, during which the horrors of the Convention are kept\r\nout of sight, and you have time to take breath before coming to the\r\nstirring events of the Empire.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand went on to say, as regards Mirabeau's receipt, that\r\nhe regarded it as a family paper which he had no right to keep, and\r\nhanded it over to Louis XVIII. himself, and knew nothing of what had\r\nbecome of it.\r\n\r\n_London, June 21, 1834._--M. de Talleyrand was over fifty-three when\r\nhe began to write the Memoirs, or rather a small volume on the Duc de\r\nChoiseul. In 1809, when he was going to take the waters at Bourbon\r\nl'Archambault, he asked Madame de Rémus to lend him a book to read on\r\nthe way. She gave him Lacretelle's _Histoire du dixhuitième Siècle_, a\r\nwork both inaccurate and incomplete. M. de Talleyrand, annoyed by the\r\nerrors and the ignorance of the author, employed his leisure while at\r\nthe waters in making a rapid sketch of one of the periods which\r\nLacretelle had particularly misrepresented. Those who came to know\r\nthis fragment were so much pleased with it, and M. de Talleyrand was\r\nso much amused by writing it, that he formed the idea of grouping\r\nsubsequent events round another person whom he had known very well. He\r\nthen put together his study of the Duc d'Orléans, a piece no less\r\ncurious than the former, but since almost entirely rehandled and\r\nincorporated in his own Memoirs. These, of course, contain\r\nreminiscences of an even more personal character, and complete the\r\nstory of the two epochs, of which one saw the preparation and the\r\nother the climax of the crisis in which M. de Talleyrand played a\r\nhistoric part. Most of the Memoirs (and in my opinion the most\r\nbrilliant part) was written during the four years that he was in\r\ndisgrace with the Emperor Napoleon. From 1814 to 1816 he added almost\r\nnothing to the Memoirs; later, and up to 1830, he devoted himself to\r\nrevision, correction, and amplification. He inserted the portion about\r\nErfurt, and another on the Spanish catastrophe, which brought\r\nFerdinand VII. to Valençay, in the main body of the narrative, and\r\nbrought it down to just after the Restoration; but as all the copies\r\nof his despatches during the Congress of Vienna (of which the\r\noriginals are at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) were stolen from\r\nhim, he was without materials or notes for this interesting period,\r\nand this is sometimes obvious in the Memoirs.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed unfortunate that M. de Talleyrand never kept a journal or\r\ntook notes. He is abominably careless about his papers, and when he\r\nset about collecting his reminiscences he had nothing to depend upon\r\nfor the details but his memory, which is no doubt very good, but of\r\ncourse is too much overburdened not occasionally to leave regrettable\r\ngaps.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] Here we have a natural explanation of what astonished\r\n  readers of the Memoirs of the Prince de Talleyrand, which\r\n  appeared in 1891 under the supervision of the Duc de Broglie. The\r\n  controversy which then arose as to whether M. de Bacourt had not\r\n  cut down the text cannot be more authoritatively set at rest than\r\n  by this passage from Madame de Dino's journal.\r\n\r\nI have often heard M. de Talleyrand tell most amusing stories, which\r\nare omitted from the Memoirs because by the time he came to write he\r\nhad forgotten them. I myself was wrong not to write them down as I\r\nheard them, and to trust, like him, to my memory, which is so often\r\ndeceptive for oneself and insufficient for others.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand has, unhappily, been too ready to read his Memoirs,\r\nor parts of them, to all sorts of people. He has got sometimes one\r\nperson, sometimes another, to copy the manuscript, and has dictated\r\nportions now and then. The result is that their existence has become\r\nknown, and has awakened political anxiety in some quarters and\r\nliterary jealousy in others. Treachery and cupidity have speculated on\r\ntheir importance. It is said, and I am disposed to believe it to be\r\ntrue, that several garbled copies exist, envenomed by the slanderous\r\nand uncharitable temper of their possessors, and that these are some\r\nday to be published. This would be a misfortune, not only because of\r\nthe evil passions which would be awakened, but also because these\r\nunfaithful copies would deprive the authentic Memoirs, when they do\r\nappear, of their merit, their freshness, and their interest. They\r\nwould be spoiled in the forestalling.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more free from slander than the real Memoirs. I do not\r\nsay that there are not occasional sallies of that gay and subtle\r\nmalice which is so characteristic of M. de Talleyrand's wit. But there\r\nis nothing unkind, nothing insulting and less scandal than in any work\r\nof this kind. M. de Talleyrand treats women with respect or at least\r\nwith politeness, restraint and indulgence though they have occupied so\r\nlarge a place in his social existence. It is clear that he is grateful\r\nfor the charm which they have imparted to his life, and if some day\r\nserious persons find the Memoirs incomplete as history, and curious\r\nones do not find all the revelations they expect, they may perhaps\r\nblame M. de Talleyrand's careless indolence; women at least will\r\nalways be grateful to him for the good manners which inspired his\r\nreticence and deprived the cynical publicists of to-day of new weapons\r\nfor calumny and evil speaking.\r\n\r\n_London, June 22, 1834._ Sir Robert Peel with whom I dined yesterday\r\npointed out to me that M. Dupin, who was also present, was much more\r\nlike an American than a Frenchman. This is nearly the worst\r\ncompliment which could be paid any one by an Englishman of good\r\nbreeding. Sir Robert seemed to me to be in quite particularly good\r\nspirits. His careful questions about the members of the French\r\nMinistry, his insistence on his affection and admiration for M. de\r\nTalleyrand made me think that he had some idea in his mind that he\r\nwould soon be in a position in which he would have direct dealings\r\nwith them. I asked him whether he thought that Parliamentary manners\r\nand the tone of debate had changed since the Reform Bill was passed.\r\nHe said they had up to a certain point, but that what had particularly\r\nstruck him was the complete absence of any new talent, notwithstanding\r\nthe accession of new members to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nI thought him at least as much pleased as surprised by this. He has\r\ncertainly excellent reasons for not wishing that the old parliamentary\r\ncelebrities should be effaced.\r\n\r\nHis house is one of the prettiest, best arranged, and best situated in\r\nLondon. It is full of fine pictures and valuable furniture, yet there\r\nis nothing pompous or ostentatious about it. Everything is in the best\r\ntaste and nothing shows a trace of Sir Robert's humble origin. Lady\r\nPeel's modest but distinguished countenance, her quiet and amiable\r\nmanner, the intelligent faces of the children, the wealth of flowers\r\nwhich shed their perfume through the house, the great balcony opening\r\non the Thames, from which you can see both Westminster and St.\r\nPaul's--everything combines to make the general effect both complete\r\nand charming. Yesterday evening was fine and really hot, and the\r\ncombined brilliance of a lovely moon and of the gaslight on so many\r\nbridges and buildings made one feel one's self anywhere rather than in\r\nfoggy England.\r\n\r\n_London, June 23, 1834._--Lord Clanricarde, Mr. Canning's son-in-law\r\nhas resigned his place in the Household because he is angry at not\r\ngetting the Post Office which was given to Lord Conyngham.\r\n\r\nThe great Conservative dinner in the City the day before yesterday was\r\nsignalised by the presence of the Duke of Richmond, and by his\r\nGrace's reply to the Lord Mayor when he proposed the toast of the Duke\r\nof Wellington and the Peers who were present. The Duke of Richmond\r\nmade a sort of public profession of his attachment to Church and\r\nState, and when the Lord Mayor proposed the health of the Earl of\r\nSurrey, the eldest son of the Duke of Norfolk, who is a member of the\r\nHouse of Commons, but who is not a Conservative and who is a Catholic,\r\nthe Earl replied that he was convinced that the House of Commons would\r\nnot be behind the Upper Chamber in maintaining the Church, yes, the\r\nChurch and the ancient constitution of the realm. The cheering was\r\nimmense.\r\n\r\nEverything, it seems, tends to bring Mr. Stanley and Sir Robert Peel\r\ncloser and closer together. It is hoped that this alliance, already\r\nfar advanced, will bring about the fall of the present Cabinet, but a\r\nsharp transition is not desired, for that might frighten John Bull who\r\ndoesn't like Coalition Cabinets.\r\n\r\n_London, June 25, 1834._--In the large provincial towns of England\r\nthere are every year what are called \"Musical festivals.\" At these as\r\na rule the great oratorios are given, and celebrated artists from all\r\ncountries are engaged at great expense. These festivals last for\r\nseveral days; all the smart people from the various parts of the\r\ncounty come into the town where the music is performed in the churches\r\nin the mornings, the evenings being given up to diversions of a more\r\nworldly character. Next to horse racing these functions draw the\r\ngreatest crowds.\r\n\r\nIn London a festival takes place only every fifty years, and yesterday\r\nwas one of these anniversaries. The whole Court was present in state\r\nand will be on the three remaining days. Westminster Abbey was full,\r\nand, though less imposing than at the King's coronation, the spectacle\r\nwas even more brilliant. The arrangements were excellent; there was no\r\ncrowding or embarrassment; everything went very well. The number of\r\nmusicians, vocal and instrumental, was enormous--seven hundred in all.\r\nUnfortunately the Abbey is so high, and constructed on principles so\r\ndetrimental to all musical effect, that the prodigious numbers of\r\nvoices and instruments which, it was said, was enough to bring down\r\nthe building, hardly filled it. One felt this particularly during the\r\nfirst part of Haydn's _Creation_. Handel's Samson, a broader and more\r\npowerful composition, was more suited to the circumstances of the\r\noccasion. The Funeral March made a deep impression on me and the final\r\nair sung by Miss Stevens with a trumpet _obbligato_ was very fine. But\r\nthe general effect was marred by the great mistake of placing the\r\nsingers so low that their voices were lost before they could rise to\r\nthe roof, there to find the point from which they could re-echo. I\r\nthink the organ is the only instrument which can sufficiently fill a\r\ngreat cathedral. In such a place all the orchestras in the world sound\r\nthin and incongruous, and I was sorry yesterday that the organ was not\r\nused in the concerted pieces as it would have made the effect richer\r\nand more impressive. I even felt that this concert music was out of\r\nplace in a church. It was like the effect of an academic panegyric,\r\nhowever beautiful and noble, being pronounced in a pulpit instead of a\r\nfuneral sermon.\r\n\r\n_London, June 26, 1834._--_A propos_ of certain of our countrymen M.\r\nde Talleyrand remarked yesterday: \"It is extraordinary how much talent\r\nvanity consumes.\" Nothing can be truer, especially as he applied it.\r\n\r\nIt is announced that the Greek Order of the Saviour and the Portuguese\r\nOrder of Christ have been conferred on M. de Talleyrand. On the\r\noccasion of his receiving the latter he told me that under the Empire,\r\nwhen Orders were raining upon him from every side, the Comte de Ségur,\r\nGrand Master of the Ceremonies, seemed rather cast down because he had\r\nnot got any. M. de Talleyrand begged the Emperor to allow him to give\r\nM. de Ségur the Order of Christ which he had just received. This was\r\ndone to M. de Ségur's great satisfaction, and he never afterwards\r\nappeared without his broad ribbon.\r\n\r\n_London, June 27, 1834._--The late Lord Castlereagh had a curious way\r\nof speaking French. He said to Madame de Lieven that what gave him\r\nmost pleasure in her conversation was that his mind became \"_liquide_\"\r\nwhen in her company, and one day, speaking of the union which\r\nprevailed among the Great Powers, he said to her that he was delighted\r\nto say that they were all _dans le même potage_, a rather too literal\r\ntranslation of the English idiom \"in the same mess.\"\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a long conversation with my cousin Paul Medem. He\r\nunderstands very well the difficulties of his position, which begin\r\nwith the keen regret with which M. and Madame de Lieven are yielding\r\nhim the place. These difficulties will be removed in part by the very\r\nwise advice of the Czar, that he should remain altogether outside the\r\ninternal politics of England, and become neither Whig nor Tory. He\r\ntold me that the real reason why he had been preferred to Matuczewicz,\r\nwas the marked and uncompromising character of the opinions which the\r\nlatter had adopted in England, where he went in for politics with the\r\nvigour of John Bull himself.\r\n\r\n_June 28, 1834._--The King of England is ill and his haste to see the\r\nQueen depart has suddenly changed into keen regret that she is going.\r\nShe did everything she could to persuade him to allow her to stay, but\r\nthe King replied that it was too late to change his mind, that all was\r\nready and that she must go. To stay now would give rise to all sorts\r\nof unfortunate conjectures which should be avoided. \"Besides,\" he\r\nadded, \"if a change in the Ministry comes soon it is better that you\r\nshould be absent so that they cannot say, as they did some years ago,\r\nthat you influenced me.\" The same day, speaking of his Ministers, the\r\nKing said, \"I am tired to death of these people,\" and when some one\r\nobserved that if so, it was very curious that he did not dismiss them,\r\nhe replied very sensibly, \"But two years ago when I sent for the\r\nTories they left me stranded at the end of twenty-four hours and\r\nabandoned me to the Whigs. This must not happen a second time. I shall\r\ntherefore do nothing one way or the other, but let them fight it out\r\nas best they can among themselves.\" Things will not, however, turn out\r\nas before, for it was the refusal of Sir Robert Peel to take office\r\nwhich wrecked the plan on the former occasion. Now he is willing to\r\ntake up the succession, and public opinion is prepared to see him do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI hear much of internal dissensions in the Cabinet. It appears that\r\nLord Lansdowne will not remain with Mr. Ellice, especially since the\r\ndeclaration of the latter in favour of the principles of Mr.\r\nO'Connell. It is also said that Lord Grey doesn't get on with Mr.\r\nAbercromby. Finally the disunion of the Cabinet is obvious, even to\r\nthe public, and is being, I think, rather cleverly exploited by the\r\nConservative Party.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Lieven yesterday introduced Paul Medem to Lord Grey, who\r\nappeared much embarrassed, and, after a long silence, found nothing to\r\ntalk about but France, M. de Broglie, M. de Rigny, the elections, &c.,\r\njust as he might have done with a French _chargé d'affaires_. For a\r\nRussian one, just come from St. Petersburg, this was very\r\ncurious--Lord Grey's praises of Broglie were excessive; his questions\r\nabout Rigny cold and distrustful.\r\n\r\n_London, June 29, 1834._--It is very strange that, as things are, Lady\r\nHolland, who has always professed to be a friend of Lord Aberdeen in\r\nspite of the difference of their political opinions, should have asked\r\nM. de Talleyrand to meet him at dinner at her house!\r\n\r\nYesterday I took leave of the Queen; everything seemed definitely\r\narranged for her departure.\r\n\r\nDon Carlos and his suite are established at Gloucester Lodge, a pretty\r\nhouse in one of the suburbs, which is called Old Brompton. This house,\r\nwhose present owner is unknown to me, was built by the mother of the\r\npresent Duke of Gloucester who gave it its name. Don Carlos's close\r\nproximity to London much embarrasses all the members of the diplomatic\r\ncorps, whose courts have left their relations with Spain conveniently\r\nvague. The signatories of the Quadruple Alliance are of course out of\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n_London, June 30, 1834._--The Marquis de Miraflorès makes no progress\r\nin the difficult art of behaving tactfully in society. The other day\r\nhe made another curious lapse. It was at the house of Lord Brougham\r\nthe Chancellor, where he had been talking to M. de Talleyrand. The\r\nlatter, turning to go, found himself face to face with Lucien\r\nBonaparte. They greeted each other and exchanged inquiries, coldly\r\nbut politely, and M. de Talleyrand was about to take his leave when he\r\nwas stopped by the Spanish Minister, who in a loud voice asked the\r\nFrench Ambassador to present him to Lucien Bonaparte! It was a perfect\r\nexample of tact!\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington, whom I saw yesterday at a concert in honour of\r\nMadame Malibran, told me that he had been with Don Carlos that\r\nmorning, and had had a very curious conversation with him. He could\r\nnot give me an account of it then because of the crowd which\r\nsurrounded us listening to everything we said, but he told me that\r\nnothing could exceed the squalour, poverty and untidiness of this King\r\nand Queen of Spain and the Indies. The Duke was the more astonished at\r\nthis, as they have found money here, and might easily have bought a\r\nlittle soap and clean linen. All that the Duke told me of the\r\nconversation was as follows. First he told them the truth as he always\r\ndoes, and, seeing a priest, then observed, \"God doubtless does much\r\nfor those who invoke His help, but He does even more for those who do\r\nsomething for themselves.\" The priest only said that there was a\r\nSpanish proverb to the same effect.\r\n\r\n_London, July 1, 1834._--Yesterday we received the news of the death\r\nof Madame Sosthène de la Rochefoucault, an event which proves that I\r\nam right in maintaining that there is no such thing as a _malade\r\nimaginaire_. Nothing, in fact, can be so tedious and wearisome as to\r\nbe constantly watching, dieting and pitying one's self. How could any\r\none keep up such a pretence unless some serious and painful symptom\r\ncondemned one to it? But there are two things which the world never\r\nwill believe in--the troubles and the sufferings of others. Every one\r\nis so afraid of being asked for sympathy and help, that it is found\r\nmore convenient to deny the facts than to sacrifice one's self. All my\r\nlife I have heard Madame Sosthène abused; she was described as a lazy,\r\ncomplaining creature who had in reality the constitution of a Turk.\r\nWhen one does not look delicate, and even sometimes when one does,\r\nnothing short of dying will convince people that one is really ill.\r\nThe world is only too ready to give exhibitions of its curiosity, its\r\nindiscretion, and its calumny, but its compassion, like its\r\nindulgence, only comes after the event, when you have no longer any\r\nneed of it.\r\n\r\nM. de Montrond talks of returning to Louèche to put his poor body in a\r\nbath. It would be a good thing if it were possible to put his soul in\r\nalso. His visit here was an even worse failure than that of last year.\r\nWhen you have survived yourself, your fortune, your health, your wit,\r\nand your manners, and when there does not even remain the faintest\r\nreflection of your past glories to give you a little consideration in\r\nthe world, the spectacle which you present is deplorable. I said one\r\nday to M. de Talleyrand that in my opinion nothing was left to M. de\r\nMontrond except to blow out his brains. He replied that he would do\r\nnothing of the sort, because he had never been able to put up with the\r\nsmallest deprivation, and he would not willingly accept the\r\ndeprivation of life any more than any other.\r\n\r\nMadame de Montrond, who was divorced from her first husband[19] in\r\norder to marry M. de Montrond, told me that one day, after she had\r\nbeen divorced for the second time and had resumed her maiden name\r\nAimée de Coigny, she was being driven in a phaeton with M. de\r\nMontrond, who himself took the reins. She was admiring the fine pair\r\nof English horses and praised the view, the equipage, and the driver.\r\n\"It is not much of a pleasure,\" he replied; \"what would be worth doing\r\nwould be to harness two young tigers, lash them to fury, to tame them,\r\nand then to kill them.\" This is, indeed, the language of an insatiable\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n  [19] The Duc de Fleury, grand-nephew of the Cardinal.\r\n\r\n_London, July 2, 1834._--The Queen is definitely going on the 5th. She\r\nwill cross in the yacht _Royal George_, which people are going to\r\nvisit out of curiosity, as well as two splendid steamboats, which will\r\nact as tugs when necessary. The whole Yacht Club will escort her, and\r\nthe North Sea will be covered with a charming little fleet. The Queen\r\nis to land at Rotterdam some time on the 6th, and will proceed the\r\nsame evening incognita to her sister, the Duchess of Weimar, who lives\r\nin the suburbs of The Hague. The Prince of Orange, I understand, is to\r\nbe there as if by chance. The Princess of Orange is in Germany with\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\n_London, July 3, 1834._--Lord Grey has become extremely nervous and\r\nirritable. Yesterday, while dining with Lord Sefton, he was, as they\r\nsay here, quite cross because dinner was later than usual; because\r\nLady Cowley, a witty and animated woman but a great Tory, was there;\r\nand, finally, because every one was in full dress for the Duke of\r\nWellington's ball. It is really curious that a man in Lord Grey's\r\nexalted position and of such a noble nature as he, should be so\r\nsensitive to small matters, and should have nerves so childishly\r\nsusceptible.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington gave a splendid ball, very magnificent,\r\nbrilliant, and well-arranged. All the guests did their best not to dim\r\nthe lustre of the proceedings, and I think they were successful.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard writes to me: \"The aspect of the elections is\r\ndeceptive; they are much less ministerial than they seem. Next Session\r\nwill be very heavy, and the Ministry is prepared for trouble. The\r\ngreat number of coalitions is a very serious symptom. What must be the\r\nviolence of the hatreds which have formed such an alliance!\" Further\r\non he adds, \"When one knows a person one is usually able to predict\r\nwith fair accuracy what he will say or do in given circumstances, but\r\nM. Dupin defies all calculation. The rashness of his speech is such as\r\ncannot be foreseen; it is the same here as in London, and it makes it\r\nimpossible that he should ever come into power.\"\r\n\r\n_London, July 4, 1834._--The other day the Queen said something which\r\nseemed very ridiculous to the person to whom she said it, but which\r\nseems to me quite intelligible, probably owing to what M. de\r\nTalleyrand would call my _allemanderie_. She said that \"during the\r\nsixteen hours which she spent last week in Westminster Abbey during\r\nthe performance of the great oratorios, she had had more time and\r\nleisure to reflect on her position, and for self-examination than she\r\nusually had.\" This has led to her making discoveries, for instance that\r\nshe was more attached to the King than she was perhaps aware, that she\r\nwas more necessary to her husband than she had thought, and, in a\r\nword, that henceforth England was her only true country. All this\r\nmakes her departure particularly painful, but she has one consolation.\r\nThis is the thought that when she is away the King will be more\r\ndisposed to assist in bringing about a change of Ministry, and that it\r\ncannot be supposed that in doing so he is yielding to her influence.\r\nThere is much, perhaps too much, frankness in such pieces of\r\nself-revelation, but I think that all these ideas are perfectly\r\nnatural, and I understand perfectly how they were inspired in the\r\nplaces and circumstances above described.\r\n\r\nThe King for his part gives the most curious explanations of his\r\nregret at the Queen's leaving him, which grows keener day by day. Thus\r\nhe said to Madame de Lieven yesterday. \"I could never explain to you,\r\nMadame, the innumerable ways in which the Queen is of use to me.\" This\r\nis a strange and rather ridiculous way of putting it. The King has\r\ngout in his hands which makes it difficult to use them, prevents him\r\nfrom riding, and often from writing. This causes him much pain when he\r\nhas many papers to sign, and makes him depend on his valet in the\r\nsmallest matters. All his fine plans of resuming his bachelor\r\nexistence and of amusing himself as suits his fancy are abandoned. So\r\nmuch so that his Majesty concluded his confidences to Madame de Lieven\r\nby saying that once the Queen is gone he would go to Windsor and live\r\nthere like a hermit, never leaving the place till she came back.\r\n\r\nThe departure of her Majesty, which takes place to-morrow, will be a\r\nreally splendid spectacle. Besides her own vessel the two great\r\nsteam-boats and all the Yacht Club, the Lord Mayor, and all the City\r\nCompanies will escort the Queen in their State barges as a mark of\r\nrespect up to the point on the river at which their jurisdiction ends.\r\nIt is said, too, that a Dutch fleet is to be sent to meet her.\r\n\r\nAlmack's, the celebrated Almack's,[20] which for twenty years has been\r\nthe despair of the middle classes, the object of the emulation and the\r\ndesire of so many young ladies in the provinces, Almack's, which gives\r\nor withholds the stamp of fashion, Almack's, the despotism _par\r\nexcellence_, ruled with a rod of iron by six of the most exclusive\r\nladies in London; Almack's, like all modern institutions, carries in\r\nits bosom the seeds of its own destruction! Following on a relaxation\r\nof internal regulations came a violation of its privileges, for the\r\nDuke of Wellington dared to give a ball on Wednesday, the day devoted\r\nand consecrated exclusively to Almack's. Finally, there has been\r\ndisunion and a conflict of jurisdiction in the Council of Six, and\r\nlike the constitution of Church and State, so much shaken at present,\r\nAlmack's also threatens to fall to pieces, and we fear for the safety\r\nof an institution where young ladies find husbands, women of position\r\nan exercising ground for their pretentions, novelists the most\r\nbrilliant scenes in their stories, foreigners their introduction to\r\nsociety, and everybody a more or less legitimate interest to occupy\r\nthem in the height of the season.\r\n\r\n  [20] Almack's was an academy of fashion where all the best\r\n  society in London collected. The patronesses were six ladies of\r\n  high rank; every man of the world had to make his _début_ at\r\n  Almack's.\r\n\r\nLady Jersey is accused of being the subversive spirit. The counts in\r\nthe indictment against her are numerous. She would not allow the\r\nappointment of younger patronesses, who being livelier than their\r\nelders might have revived the fading interest people took in the\r\nplace. She had been much to blame in giving tickets carelessly to\r\npeople who were anything but elegant, and had refused to submit her\r\nlists to the inspection of her colleagues. Further, having herself\r\nintroduced an undesirable element at the balls, she had decried them,\r\nand in spite of the fact that she was a patroness had ceased to go\r\nherself, and had persuaded the Duke of Wellington to give a ball on\r\nWednesday. She had tried to force the other patronesses to change the\r\nday, and finally, not content with having set at naught in this way\r\nall the most sacred traditions of the institution, she had written an\r\narrogant and preposterous letter, or rather manifesto, to Lady Cowper,\r\ncomplaining that, as her advice had been disregarded, Almack's had\r\nclashed with the Duke of Wellington's Ball, and threatening that, as\r\nshe was very angry at this, she would resign her position as a member\r\nof the Committee. It is expected that at the next meeting there will\r\nbe a great row. I confess that if the public were admitted I should\r\ncertainly be present.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Lady Jersey carries blind vanity to a degree\r\nwhich is beyond all bounds. She is absolutely stupid, and her origin\r\nis bourgeois.[21] Her husband is too indulgent, and she is beautiful\r\nwith a beauty which is imperfect but very well preserved. Her health\r\nis robust, her energy untiring, and the possession of all these\r\nadvantages has convinced her that she has enough money to excuse all\r\nher caprices, enough beauty to be the despair or the rapture of all\r\nthe men about her, enough wit to rule the world, and enough authority\r\nto be always paramount without question in the favour of princes, in\r\nthe confidence of statesmen, in the hearts of the young men, and even\r\nin the opinion of her rivals. She thinks her superiority so\r\nincontestable that modesty is unnecessary and would be merely\r\nhypocritical, so she does without it perfectly. She speaks of her\r\nbeauty, which she exhibits with all the complacency of Helen of Troy,\r\nof her wit, her virtue, and her sensibility each in its turn. Piety\r\narrives punctually on Sunday and departs on Monday. She has neither\r\nrestraint nor ability, nor generosity, nor kindness, nor honesty nor\r\ndignity. She is either mocked or hated, either avoided or feared. In\r\nmy opinion her heart is bad, her head empty, her character dangerous,\r\nher society tedious, but when all is said and done she is as they say,\r\n\"the best creature in the world.\"\r\n\r\n  [21] Through her mother Lady Jersey was the grand-daughter of\r\n  Robert Child, the banker.\r\n\r\n_London, July 6, 1834._--The rather violent altercation in the House\r\nof Commons between Mr. Littelton, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and Mr.\r\nO'Connell has not been well received, and has brought out in a strong\r\nlight both the indiscretion of the former and the want of principle\r\nof the latter. After such a scene it was expected that the two\r\nchampions would have a mutual explanation not without arms, and that\r\nMr. Littelton would resign or be dismissed. But the political\r\nepidermis is neither very fine nor very sensitive; the manners and\r\ncustoms of Parliament make people callous very quickly, and ambition\r\nand intrigue promptly dethrone every sentiment of delicacy, and\r\nsometimes every sentiment of honour.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley made another long speech the day before yesterday on the\r\neternal question of the Irish Church, launching defiance at the\r\nGovernment of which he was so lately a member. This was so easy to\r\nforesee that I was astonished at the stupidity of Ministers and their\r\nfriends, who maintained breathlessly that Mr. Stanley would remain\r\ntheir friend and defender after his resignation as he had been before.\r\nAs if between politicians there could be any other bond of union\r\nexcept common ambition?\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan Minister thought it his duty to present himself before\r\nDon Carlos, who sent for him. He made up his mind, however, not to\r\ncommit his Court without instructions, and to give Don Carlos no\r\nhigher title than \"Monseigneur.\" However, when he got to Gloucester\r\nLodge, he was solemnly introduced into the presence of the Prince, who\r\nreceived him standing in the midst of his Court, the Princesses at his\r\nside so black and ugly, with eyes of such an African cast, that poor\r\nold Ludolf became confused, and hearing every one cry \"the King,\" and\r\nfeeling these four terrible black eyes fixed on him with the fury of\r\nwild beasts, he felt that if he did not go beyond \"Monseigneur\" his\r\nlast hour was come; and so he scattered \"King\" and \"Majesty\" right and\r\nleft, and was glad to escape alive from that den of brigands!\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Lieven gave us a charming day in the country\r\nyesterday. The company showed both good humour and good taste, and\r\nconsisted of the Princess, Lady Clanricarde, M. Dedel, Count Pahlen,\r\nLord John Russell, and myself. The weather was splendid, except for\r\ntwo thunder-showers, which we all took in good part. We dined at\r\nBurford Bridge, a pretty little inn at the foot of Box Hill, only half\r\nof which we were able to climb owing to the heat. We also visited\r\nDeepdene, a country house which belongs to Mr. Hope,[22] and well\r\ndeserves its name. The vegetation is fine, but the place is low-lying\r\nand melancholy; the house is in a pretentious Egyptian style, which is\r\ngrotesque and ugly.\r\n\r\n  [22] This house still belongs to the Hope family, and contains a\r\n  remarkable picture gallery. The park and the Italian garden are\r\n  among the finest in England.\r\n\r\nMr. Denison's property of Denbies,[23] which we next visited, is\r\nadmirably situated; the view is rich and varied, but the house is\r\ninsignificant, at least from the outside. All this country is quite\r\npicturesque--remarkably so, in fact, when one thinks how near it is to\r\na great city like London. The party was undoubtedly very pleasant, and\r\nI like to look back on it.\r\n\r\n  [23] Denbies now belongs to Mr. G. Cubitt; it is situated in the\r\n  county of Surrey, near Dorking.\r\n\r\n_London, July 7, 1834._--The Duke of Cumberland has announced his\r\nintention of visiting Don Carlos, which much displeases the King. The\r\nDuke of Gloucester would be tempted to go too, but he was unwilling to\r\ndo so without telling the King, who begged him not to do so.\r\n\r\nHere is exactly what passed between the Infante Don Carlos and the\r\nDuke of Wellington. The Infante began by sending the Bishop of Leon to\r\nthe Duke, who thought him a fat and rather common priest, but that he\r\nhad more sense than all the rest of the party put together. The Bishop\r\nbegged the Duke to go to see his master and give him his advice. The\r\nDuke declined to advise on a position the details of which, as well as\r\nthe resources available, were unknown to him, but felt that he could\r\nnot very well refuse to call on Don Carlos, with whom he had the\r\nsingular conversation which follows:\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS. Do you advise me to go by sea and rejoin Zumalacarreguy in\r\nBiscaya?\r\n\r\nDUKE OF WELLINGTON. But have you the means of getting there? (_No\r\nreply._) Have you a seaport at your disposal where you would be sure\r\nto be able to disembark?\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS. Zumalacarreguy will take one for me.\r\n\r\nDUKE OF WELLINGTON. But in order to do so he would have to leave\r\nBiscaya. Moreover, you must not forget that, in accordance with the\r\nTreaty of Quadruple Alliance, England will not allow you to start for\r\nSpain, having engaged to expel you from that country.\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS. Very well. I will go by way of France.\r\n\r\nDUKE OF WELLINGTON. But France has entered into the same engagements.\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS. What would be done if I crossed France?\r\n\r\nDUKE OF WELLINGTON. You would be arrested.\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS. What impression would be produced on the other Powers by\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nDUKE OF WELLINGTON. The impression that a Prince had been arrested.\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS. But if there were a change of Ministry here they would\r\nrestore me in Spain.\r\n\r\nDUKE OF WELLINGTON. Many intriguing persons, some of them of the\r\nhighest rank, will try to persuade you that this is so, and I cannot\r\nsufficiently warn you against such a delusion. England has recognised\r\nIsabella II., and cannot go back on that recognition or on the\r\nengagements entered into by treaty. What I say may be unpleasant, but\r\nI think that to say it is the greatest service I can do you. I know\r\nthis country well; you need expect nothing from it. I am indeed\r\nastonished that, after the treaty our Government has signed, you\r\nshould have chosen it for your residence. From many points of view you\r\nwould, I think, be much better off in Germany. I do not know the\r\nstrength of your party in Spain, or what its chances of success may\r\nbe, but I do not believe that you will ever find any honest or\r\nefficient help except in Spain itself.\r\n\r\nSuch is the conversation, which seems to me very interesting as\r\nillustrating the extraordinary ignorance of the one and the simple\r\nstraightforwardness of the other. The Duke was much struck by a sort\r\nof cretinism which distinguishes this unhappy Prince, who knows and\r\nhas learned nothing, who has neither dignity, nor courage, nor\r\naddress, nor intelligence, and who really appears to be on the lowest\r\nrung of the human ladder. It is said that the Princesses, the\r\nchildren, and, in fact, every one about him, are much of the same\r\nsort. It is a pitiable spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington does not believe in the million sent by M. de\r\nBlacas. He thinks that it is no doubt rather the Spanish clergy who\r\nhave sent a little money.\r\n\r\nI told the Duke that I had seen many people who were very curious to\r\nknow what title he had given to Don Carlos when he was with him. He\r\nsaid, \"You see from what I have told you that there is nothing in the\r\nconversation I had with the prince which might not be printed; there\r\nis nothing which could offend any one. The curiosity you mention\r\nreminds me of that shown by all Spaniards during the Peninsular War,\r\nto know the manner in which I addressed Joseph Bonaparte when I\r\ncommunicated with him as I often did. His French correspondence was\r\noften intercepted and brought to me. It contained much information\r\nthat I could not allow him to have, but also news of his wife and\r\nchildren of which I had no wish to deprive him, and which I used to\r\nsend through the French outposts. On these occasions I used to write\r\nto the French General saying, 'Acquaint the King that his wife, or his\r\neldest daughter, or his younger daughter, is better, or not so well,\r\nas the case might be, that they have gone to the country,' &c. &c. I\r\nnever said the King _of Spain_, and I addressed my communications to\r\nthe French General commanding, and not to the Spanish Generals of\r\nJoseph's party. Thus in this title of King there was no recognition to\r\nbe inferred. It was a piece of civility and nothing more, and as such\r\nwas of no consequence.\" Thus the Duke left me to my own reflections on\r\nthe manner in which he addressed Don Carlos when he saw him.\r\n\r\nAll these poor Spaniards were at the Opera yesterday, where, as was\r\nnatural, they were the object of much curiosity.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that they are busy bringing a Governor of Algiers\r\ninto the world. Marshal Soult would like to send a Marshal, others\r\nwant a civilian in order that the Duc Decazes may have the place. He\r\nis loudly asking for it, and Thiers for one has promised that it shall\r\nbe his. It is a curious thing to see a favourite of Louis XVIII.\r\ntaking refuge in Algiers! I can remember a time when people were\r\ncasting about for a means to send him far away and when Algiers with\r\nits Dey, its slavery and its bow strings, would have been considered\r\nat the Pavilion Marsan to be a most excellent solution of the problem.\r\nRascality, eccentricity, reverses of fortune, catastrophes have not\r\nbeen wanting in the years which I have seen, the number of which seems\r\ndouble and treble what it really is when I think of the immensity of\r\nthe events which have happened, the destinies which have been\r\ndestroyed, the ruins and the recoveries which they have witnessed.\r\n\r\n_London, July 8, 1834._--The English Ministry cannot either live or\r\ndie. Each day demolishes a fraction of the edifice; it is impossible\r\nthat the Cabinet should not feel itself shaken to its foundations, and\r\nyet against all parliamentary tradition it remains in office in\r\ndefiance of the insults and indiscretions, the paltry cowardice of one\r\nset of people, the paltry treachery of others. Even the King is not\r\nacting straightforwardly; the Conservatives are ready to take up an\r\ninheritance which seems within their grasp, but they prefer taking it\r\nover quietly to snatching it from the dying hands of its present\r\nowners. Meanwhile nothing is done, nothing decided, and the astonished\r\nand expectant public looks on uncomprehendingly. Lord Althorp\r\nannounces that Mr. Littleton has offered his resignation which Lord\r\nGrey has refused to accept. Lord Grey denies that the Cabinet has\r\ntaken a decision announced by the Duke of Richmond with (according to\r\nhis account) the special permission of the King. If the old\r\nParliamentary tradition were observed this strange incident would lead\r\nto some drastic solution of the problem, but as things are, no one\r\nexpects anything more than some paltry patching up of the Ministry. In\r\nthe meantime while they are haggling over the price of existence at\r\nhome, Lord Palmerston is finding a peremptory settlement for all\r\nforeign questions, refusing explanations to one party, declining to\r\naccept them from another, irritating and alarming everybody. It is not\r\nassuredly a case for imitating John Huss on his way to execution who,\r\nseeing a poor old woman hurrying with a blind zeal for the glory of\r\nGod to throw another faggot on the pyre on which he was to be burned,\r\nexclaimed _Sancta simplicitas!_\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of Lord Palmerston and his reputation even among those who\r\ncannot do without him, I shall quote the remark of Lord William\r\nRussell, the most tranquil and moderate of men. Madame de Lieven had\r\nexpressed to him her desire to see him Ambassador at St. Petersburg,\r\nat an early date, to which he replied, \"Nothing could be more splendid\r\nor fortunate for my career, yet if Lord Palmerston thought of me I\r\nshould refuse. What he wants is not an enlightened and truthful agent,\r\nbut a man who will distort the truth to suit his prejudices. If you\r\ndisplay any independence, whether of language or of opinion, it\r\nirritates him. His one thought is how to get rid of you and bring\r\nabout your ruin. When I was at Lisbon my views did not agree with his,\r\nso he attacked my wife's reputation, and if I were to send him any\r\ninformation from St. Petersburg except what he wanted to receive, he\r\nwould simply say that I had been bought by Russia and try to dishonour\r\nme in that way. No gentleman can in the end consent to do business\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\n_London, July 9, 1834._--Paul Medem was telling us yesterday that\r\nnothing was so curious as the excessive partiality shewn by the Duc de\r\nBroglie, when he was Minister, for Lord Granville. The preference\r\ngiven by him to the British Ambassador over all the rest of the\r\ndiplomatic corps seemed natural in the circumstances, but, as it was\r\nnot only an exclusive preference but an anxious, jealous and absorbing\r\npassion, it became ridiculous, embarrassing and often inexpedient.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which was not less curious was that the day after he\r\nleft the Ministry when he was going the round of the Ambassadors and\r\nexplaining to them the reasons for his resignation, the Duc de\r\nBroglie, by way of softening what he wrongly supposed to be their\r\nregret, added that his ideas and his system were still represented in\r\nhis pupil M. Duchâtel whom he had put there after having initiated him\r\ninto the great affairs which were to be the chief concern of his life,\r\nand having formed him as a statesman of the first eminence. This\r\nlegacy so pompously announced seemed of less importance to the\r\nlegatees than to the testator.\r\n\r\n_London, July 10, 1834._--I learned from the Times yesterday that Lord\r\nGrey and Lord Althorp, having asked for the adjournment of several\r\nBills in the House of Lords, and having had a very long meeting of the\r\nCabinet, tendered their resignations to the King, who immediately\r\naccepted them.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] The following was the composition of Lord Grey's Cabinet:\r\n  First Lord of the Treasury, Earl Grey; Lord Chancellor, Lord\r\n  Brougham; Lord President of the Council, the Marquess of\r\n  Lansdowne; Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of Durham; Chancellor of the\r\n  Exchequer, Lord Althorp; Home Secretary, Viscount Melbourne;\r\n  Foreign Secretary, Viscount Palmerston; Colonial Secretary,\r\n  Viscount Goderich; President of the Board of Trade, Lord\r\n  Auckland; First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham;\r\n  Postmaster-General, the Duke of Richmond; Chief Secretary for\r\n  Ireland, Mr. Stanley; Paymaster-General, Lord John Russell;\r\n  President of the Board of Control, Mr. Charles Grant; Chancellor\r\n  of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Holland.\r\n\r\nWithout hearing any more I left Town with the Countess of Sutherland\r\nand Countess Batthyány to spend the morning at Bromley Hill, a\r\ncharming country house where Lord Farnborough, Mr. Pitt's old friend,\r\nalways lives, devoting himself entirely to this delightful habitation\r\nwhich is remarkable alike for its fine situation, its beautiful woods,\r\nflowers and water, and the perfect taste and care with which it is\r\nmanaged. We were quite delighted with everything and sorry to go back\r\nto the smoke and politics of London.\r\n\r\nWe could hear nothing more about the great event of the day except the\r\nsimple fact of the King's message to Lord Melbourne. Nothing is known\r\nas yet of what passed between the King and him. In the evening we went\r\nto Lord Grey's and found him _en famille_. His children seemed cast\r\ndown, his wife angry; he alone was cheerful, simple and friendly,\r\ndisplaying the noble and candid demeanour which is natural in him,\r\nand which in its way is quite touching. He told us quite naturally\r\nthat there had been a series of difficulties and dissensions which\r\nwere constantly renewed from the beginning of the session onwards, and\r\nthat the last incident--the foolish indiscretion of Mr. Littelton of\r\nwhich Lord Althorp gave such a lame explanation in the House of\r\nCommons--had made Mr. Littelton's resignation insufficient, and had\r\nnecessitated his own and Lord Althorp's.\r\n\r\nI thought that in Lord Grey's family it was Mr. Stanley who was hated\r\nmost, for it was his resignation, followed by a bitter speech, which\r\nproduced the situation in which the Littelton incident was only the\r\nculminating crisis. The Commons were so far from satisfied with Lord\r\nAlthorp's speech on this that a series of groups developed, each of\r\nwhich was capable of making its displeasure felt. This is what put an\r\nend to Lord Grey's prolonged uncertainty. He seemed to us satisfied\r\nwith the effect produced by the personal explanation of his whole\r\nconduct which he had just given in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward his son-in-law came with news of the House of Commons, where\r\nit appeared that Lord Althorp's explanations were received coldly\r\nenough. The impression there was that, besides Lord Grey and Lord\r\nAlthorp, Messrs. Abercromby, Grant, and Spring Rice had also left the\r\nMinistry. This Lord Grey said was incorrect. Only he and Lord Althorp\r\nhad actually resigned, and indeed the Chancellor had gone so far as to\r\nsay in the House of Lords that for his part he meant to stay, and\r\nwould not give up the Great Seal unless formally ordered to do so by\r\nthe King. On this I ventured to ask whether the Premier's resignation\r\ndid not necessarily involve that of all the other members of the\r\nCabinet. \"In theory, yes,\" replied Lord Grey, \"but in fact, no. But\r\nyou are right, it is the usual custom, and, as a matter of fact, any\r\nMinistry is dissolved. However, these gentlemen individually may\r\nremain in the new Cabinet.\" His manner in answering was visibly\r\nawkward and embarrassed.\r\n\r\nNext we went to Lord Holland's; he was much more upset than Lord Grey,\r\nand much irritated at the attack made on the Cabinet by the Duke of\r\nWellington in Parliament, which he considered to be malicious and in\r\nbad taste. He said that the Tories seemed quite ready to take up the\r\nsuccession, but he hoped the Chancellor's speech would disgust them\r\nwith the undertaking by showing them what enormous difficulties they\r\nwould have to contend with. He added, moreover, that \"you can't go out\r\nto dinner without being asked,\" and that, so far, the King had not\r\nsummoned the Tories to office, but had sent for Lord Melbourne, though\r\nhe did not know what had passed at the interview.\r\n\r\nTo our question whether the Cabinet was entirely or only partially\r\ndissolved, Lord Holland replied that the King must consider himself to\r\nbe without Ministers, and that for his part, though he had not handed\r\nin his resignation, he regarded himself as out of office. On this\r\nquestion there is an air of uncertainty which proves how much these\r\ngentlemen are attached to their places and how unwilling they are to\r\ngive them up. Lord Melbourne arrived while we were there, and we\r\ndiscreetly retired, being no more enlightened by the end of the day\r\nthan we had been at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere is no new light, it seems, on the Spanish situation. There is a\r\ncholera scare which the Queen Regent is trying to make an excuse for\r\nretirement from the public eye at a time which is said to be\r\nembarrassing for her. It is a bad thing for Her Majesty to lose the\r\nesteem of a public whose good opinion and goodwill are so desirable.\r\nThe cholera and the Queen's seclusion are throwing the conduct of\r\nGovernment business into great confusion. They talk of changing the\r\nplace of meeting of the Cortes.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that the Infante Don Francesco, is still at Madrid with\r\nhis wife, who is on bad terms with the Queen Regent although she is\r\nher sister, and is aiming at the Regency for himself instigated by his\r\nconsort. It is even hinted that his plans are more ambitious still.\r\nCivil war is still general in the north, and the principal actors in\r\nthe drama being placed as they are, it is impossible to predict what\r\nthe result of the present state of matters in the South of Europe will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n_London, July 11, 1834._--When the King sent for Lord Melbourne\r\nyesterday he spoke to him of his desire that a Coalition Ministry\r\nshould be formed, and asked him to undertake it. Yesterday morning,\r\nhowever, Lord Melbourne had to write to the King to say that the task\r\nwas impossible. At the same moment Lord Brougham, who does not conceal\r\nhis desire to stay in office and direct affairs, has also written to\r\nthe King to say that nothing would be easier than to reconstruct the\r\nadministration out of the ruins of its predecessor and to continue to\r\ngovern on the same system. Two leading Tories have told Madame de\r\nLieven that if they were sent for by the King they would accept\r\noffice. Their plans were made, they said, and when asked whether they\r\nwould have the courage to dissolve they said that they would not\r\ndissolve because they believed that they could control the existing\r\nHouse bad as it is. They also expressed themselves very favourably on\r\nthe subject of the French Alliance and especially regarding M. de\r\nTalleyrand, whose conservative policy inspires them with so much\r\nconfidence that they say he is the only French Ambassador who would\r\nsuit them.\r\n\r\nYesterday we had at dinner some relics of the fallen Ministry. The\r\ncauses of the catastrophe were freely discussed; it seems to have been\r\ndue to a series of small treacheries or, as Lady Holland said, to High\r\nTreason.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham, whom Lord Durham, perhaps justly, described as a rogue\r\nand a madman, appears to be the villain of the piece. He has been\r\nsecretly corresponding with the Marquess Wellesley, the Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland, in order to persuade him to make reports to\r\nLord Grey different from those previously sent and intended to induce\r\nhim to abandon the Coercion Bill. On the other hand he asked the Lords\r\nJustices for an opinion on the state of Ireland and on the measures\r\nwhich should be adopted, but, as it was not what he wanted, it never\r\nreached Lord Grey and has every appearance of having been suppressed,\r\nMr. Littelton's indiscretions--Lord Althorp's want of energy, the\r\ndifficulties of the situation as a whole--all this put together ended\r\nLord Grey's irresolution. He had for some time past been decided not\r\nto face next session. He wished to retire after the present one and to\r\nchoose his successor. I believe that he is sincerely glad to be out of\r\nthe turmoil, but that he is sorry to have resigned when his position\r\nwas honey-combed with treason and without knowing into whose hands\r\npower would fall. He is very dignified about it, but his wife is full\r\nof regret and irritation at the loss of all the chances of\r\nestablishing her family which came from her husband's being Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nLady Holland is quite prostrate with regret for the comfort in which\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster kept her husband. Lord Holland talks of it all\r\nwith a mixture of geniality, indifference, annoyance and good spirits\r\nwhich is rare, amusing and astonishing.\r\n\r\nNo one knows, foresees, or even guesses what is to be the result of\r\nthe crisis.\r\n\r\nThe King is at Windsor surrounded by an undistinguished crowd of\r\nrelatives, legitimate and illegitimate, who have neither cleverness\r\nnor consistency and who are not even agreed among themselves. It is\r\nimpossible to gauge what influence they will have one way or the\r\nother. The presence of the Queen would have had more effect, but I am\r\nglad to think that her absence relieves her of all responsibility. The\r\nKing foresaw this, and said so several times, and her own consolation\r\non leaving was the thought that she could not be accused of\r\ninfluencing the Royal decisions.\r\n\r\n_London, July 13, 1834._--It is evident that several people have been\r\nduped this week. The most surprised and upset are of course the\r\nConservatives. They and the public with them have always imagined that\r\nthe King, too weak to dismiss the Ministry, would none the less be\r\ndelighted to get rid of them and would eagerly seize the first\r\nopportunity to recall the Tories to office. Yet hours and days pass\r\nwithout their being sent for.\r\n\r\nI dined with them yesterday; they were obviously disappointed, and the\r\nDuke of Wellington, next whom I sat at dinner at Lady Jersey's,\r\ntalked quite frankly to me about it. I quite agreed with his opinion\r\nof the inevitable result of the King's conduct. Lord Grey represented\r\nthe last stage between innovation and revolution, and the King, by\r\nletting slip a natural and decent opportunity, will be unable to\r\nretrace his steps, and will precipitate himself into the abyss which\r\nis destined to engulf the monarchy and the country. The effect which\r\nthis will have in Europe is incalculable.\r\n\r\nSome one who was dining last night in the opposite camp told me that\r\nthe Whigs were sure that the King had come back to town in order to\r\nleave Lord Melbourne free to choose what Ministry he liked as he had\r\nrefused to construct a coalition. This conjecture is confirmed by the\r\nfact that several prominent members of the House of Commons have\r\nappointments with Lord Melbourne this morning. It appears that the\r\nquestion is whether the more drastic clauses of the Coercion Bill for\r\nIreland are to be abandoned. Lord Melbourne wishes to retain them, but\r\nin that case it would be necessary to do without Lord Althorp who\r\nseems to be the only person capable of leading the House of Commons.\r\nAll doubts will probably be resolved when it comes to the point, and\r\nto-morrow we shall have a reconstructed or at least a readjusted\r\nMinistry, smoothly plastered to the outward view but bearing in itself\r\nthe seeds of its destruction. What I have long believed and sometimes\r\nsaid seems to be coming true.\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Taylor, George III.'s private secretary, with whom once\r\nupon a time Princess Amelia fell hopelessly in love, who was said to\r\nbe without influence under George III., and who was a model of\r\ndiscretion under George IV., occupies the same position under the\r\npresent King. I have always suspected him of being a devoted friend of\r\nthe Whigs and especially of Lord Palmerston. He was the only man at\r\nWindsor to whom the King could speak during the crisis, and through\r\nwhom all the necessary communications could have passed. His prompting\r\nand his subterranean, yet active and long prepared intrigues are\r\nbelieved to be the cause of what is now happening.\r\n\r\nRumours succeed and destroy each other. One is wearied out with\r\ncuriosity, unsatisfied and unjustified. It is said again that Lord\r\nMelbourne will be quite at liberty to govern his Ministry as he will.\r\nIt is also said that the King, who has certainly not left Windsor, has\r\nsent Sir Herbert Taylor to Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nAgain it is asserted that Dom Pedro is dead and Don Carlos gone. In\r\nfact the city and the clubs are amusing themselves (to kill time I\r\nsuppose) by disseminating the most extraordinary and contradictory\r\nnews. People end by believing nothing and listening to no one, and\r\nmeanwhile one waits patiently with a sort of lassitude until the\r\n_Gazette_ announces officially who is going to take up the heavy and\r\ndifficult task of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Grey occupies himself with little dinners at Greenwich,\r\nwhere he consoles himself for his fall and the treachery of his\r\nfriends, Madame de Lieven for her gilded exile, and M. de Talleyrand\r\nfor the conflict of unsatisfied ambition and a natural weariness. The\r\nother day Lord Grey said very happily in his farewell speech in\r\nParliament, that when one was seventy years old as he was, one might\r\nmanage affairs very well in ordinary times, but that in a period so\r\ncritical as the present it needed the activity and energy which belong\r\nonly to youth.\r\n\r\nThis is a truth which I have had the opportunity of verifying in my\r\nown circle, and I have felt that in public life it is above all things\r\nnecessary to choose a good moment for retreat, not to lose the proper\r\nmoment, and so to quit politics gracefully, thus carrying with you the\r\napplause of the spectators and avoiding their hisses.\r\n\r\n_London, July 14, 1834._--This morning people were writing from\r\nWindsor to London to find out what was going on. The King's silence\r\nhad been complete; and in his long walks with his sister, the Princess\r\nAugusta, or his daughter, Lady Sophia Sidney, all conversation was\r\ncarefully avoided, and nothing was talked of but the weather.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's journey has met with some difficulties; and Lord Adolphus\r\nFitzclarence, who it appears is not a very skilful sailor, had some\r\ndifficulty in finding the way, and besides, the royal yacht drew too\r\nmuch water. Fortunately, the Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, and the\r\nPrince and Princess of the Netherlands had come in a Dutch steamer to\r\nmeet her Majesty, who was able to go on board the latter vessel with\r\nher maid, and proceed to The Hague direct; the suite reached Rotterdam\r\nwith some difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been very fortunate that the Queen was able to avoid\r\nRotterdam herself, for they are so much annoyed that they had prepared\r\nan ugly reception for her. It had been arranged here that she was to\r\nmeet neither the King nor the Queen of the Netherlands, and this\r\ncondition had been strongly insisted on by the King of England. A\r\n\"chance meeting,\" however, which might take place at the palace of\r\nLoo, had been talked of.\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Taylor has of late been the centre of interest for a good\r\nmany people, and has been discussed in many conversations. In this way\r\nI learned that when he was proposed as private secretary to George\r\nIII., who had become blind, it was also proposed that he should be\r\nmade a Privy Councillor. The mere idea roused the King to fury, and,\r\nin the presence of all his Ministers, he said to Mr. Taylor:\r\n\"Remember, sir, that you are to be my pen and my eye, but nothing\r\nelse; that if you should presume but once to remember what you hear,\r\nread, or write, to have an opinion of your own or to give any advice,\r\nwe should part for ever.\" And, as a matter of fact, under George III.\r\nand later under George IV., Mr. Taylor was never more than a kind of\r\nlay figure without eyes to see or ears to hear, or a memory to\r\nremember. They say that things are changed now, though he still keeps\r\nup the appearance of the greatest reserve and the most profound\r\ndiscretion. I heard on the same occasion that, until he grew blind,\r\nGeorge III. never used a secretary, even for making envelopes or\r\nsealing his letters. His correspondence was extensive as well as\r\nsecret; he always knew what was going on in society and all the\r\npolitical intrigues; and when displeased with his Ministers or\r\ndistrusting their measures he would secretly take the advice of the\r\nOpposition. He was never taken by surprise, followed public opinion,\r\nand combined considerable learning with a great dignity of carriage.\r\n\r\nSince the day before yesterday a rumour has been afloat that Don\r\nCarlos has already quitted London and has already landed in France,\r\neverybody supposing that he was lying ill at Gloucester Lodge. This\r\nthough generally believed is not yet proved. What makes me doubt it is\r\nthat M. de Miraflorès claims that it is true, and boasts that he has\r\nled Don Carlos into this proceeding by means of an agent in his pay\r\nwho, he says, persuaded the unfortunate Prince to take this step in\r\norder to betray him to the first Spanish patrol on the frontier, from\r\nwhom he would receive short shrift. This singular and horrible boast\r\nwould have to be taken seriously if uttered by any other person. But\r\nM. de Miraflorès is as idiotic in politics as in love, and it is quite\r\nlikely that the whole story is false, or at any rate, that the agent\r\nwho is said to have inveigled the Prince has only duped the diplomat.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening, politeness, interest, curiosity, and affection, in\r\na word, every possible motive, good and bad, brought an unusually\r\nlarge number of people to Lady Grey's Sunday reception, which is\r\nbelieved to be her last. It was being said there in veiled language,\r\nbut in a manner which admitted of no doubt, that Lord Melbourne had\r\ncome back from Windsor, Prime Minster, and charged with the\r\nconstruction of a new Ministry out of the old Cabinet, to which Lord\r\nGrey alone will not return. If this is so, the former will commence in\r\nthe sinister character of a traitor, and the latter will end with the\r\nmelancholy countenance of a dupe. The King will have been weak enough\r\nto prefer patching up matters to being energetic for a day or two,\r\nwhich might doubtless have been difficult, but would have been at\r\nleast dignified, and certainly salutory for the country. The Tories\r\nwill never forgive him for having drawn back, and posterity will\r\ncondemn him for his feebleness.\r\n\r\nLast night it seemed as if everything in the greatness of England was\r\ndwindled, shrunken, and soiled. The Diplomatic Corps separated into\r\ngroups, the expression of which was remarkable. The new Spain, the new\r\nPortugal, Belgium still in outline, everything which depends on the\r\ndisorder and weakness of the Great Powers, looked at Lord Palmerston\r\nwith great anxiety, which as the certainty grew that he would stay in\r\noffice, changed into an expression of affection and triumph. Scorn and\r\nhatred contracted every fibre of the Princesse de Lieven. The French\r\nAmbassador, neither a reactionary like the North, nor a propagandist\r\nlike the English, seemed full of care rather than annoyance, more\r\nsorry than surprised, and had the air of a man who, seeing the part of\r\nhonest man played out, feels that his own is finished, and that the\r\ntime has come for retiring with honour. The English themselves seemed\r\nhumiliated, and under no illusions about the appearance of moderation\r\nwhich cloaks the feebleness of the present policy. In fact, the\r\npatch-up of the Ministry will lead more slowly perhaps, but by a\r\nprocess of disintegration equally sure, to the ruin which would have\r\nbeen the result had Lord Durham and Mr. O'Connell reached office at a\r\nsingle stride.\r\n\r\nThe more one examines Lord Brougham's conduct, the more one is struck\r\nwith the shamelessness of his character. The day before yesterday the\r\nvenerable Lord Harewood asked him where we were, and whether the\r\nMinistry would be reconstructed, and the Chancellor replied, \"Where\r\nare we? Where do you suppose we can be when at a critical moment like\r\nthis we have to deal with people who take it into their heads to talk\r\nof their honour? What have we to do with honour at such a time?\"\r\n\r\nIf he is not troubled by considerations of his honour, he troubles\r\nhimself equally little about his dignity. Yesterday when every one was\r\nso much agitated, in spite of the established custom that the\r\nChancellor of England shall attend Divine Service at the Temple\r\nChurch, he thought fit to accompany Madame Peter to Mass, and to sit\r\nbeside this lady all the time, courting her not less assiduously than\r\nhis colleague, Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nThis morning, it is said, they will throw a sop to Lord Durham, and\r\nwill make him Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in order to get rid of him.\r\nAt the same time, the revived Ministry will abandon the Coercion Bill.\r\nIf this be done, they will have crowned Mr. O'Connell King of Ireland\r\non the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille. July 14 is certainly\r\nthe great day in the modern revolutionary annals.\r\n\r\nI have just met a Conservative Peer, a clever and honourable man who\r\nmoved me greatly. With tears in his eyes he lamented the degradation\r\nof his country, the ruin of this great and venerable fabric. He\r\nforesaw the terrible struggle which may immediately arise between the\r\ntwo Houses; the Radical spirit which, whether they like it or not,\r\nmust control the present Ministry, and those which will rapidly\r\nsucceed it. The present Cabinet in everybody's opinion is still-born,\r\nand people are surprised that so good and intelligent a man as Lord\r\nMelbourne should lend himself to such a farce. His sister tried to\r\nexplain it by saying that one must sacrifice one's self for one's\r\ncountry, but Madame de Lieven answered, \"The country cannot be saved\r\nby men who dishonour themselves.\"\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne's friends who know him well say that his indolence will\r\nvery soon get the upper hand, and that with a vigorous \"damn!\" he will\r\ncast off everything. It is, indeed, strange to see the most nonchalant\r\nman in England called to the conduct of affairs at such a critical\r\nmoment for the country.\r\n\r\n_London, July 15, 1834._--Lord Grey called and stayed a long time. We\r\nspoke of the recent crisis as if it were already ancient history, and\r\nwith the same detachment and sincerity as of old. He argued feebly,\r\nand as it were to ease his conscience, against my melancholy\r\nforebodings, defended his successors collectively and abandoned them\r\nin detail; or at least he agreed that their position was difficult,\r\nand that they cut a sinister figure on their re-entry into power. He\r\nwas silent when I told him that the public thought Mr. Littleton was\r\nthe fool, Lord Althorp the weakling, the Chancellor the villain of the\r\npiece. He shrugged his shoulders when I quoted to him a curious\r\nremark made by his brother-in-law, Mr. Ellice, in Lady Grey's\r\ndrawing-room the evening before, which was as follows. Replying to the\r\nregret expressed by some one at Lord Grey's retirement, \"No doubt,\" he\r\nsaid, \"it is a pity from many points of view, but it was bound to\r\ncome. He was quite sick of the business, and, at any rate, this will\r\nhave the advantage of giving us more scope, making our progress freer\r\nand getting us out of the policy of compromise, which is no longer\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nLord Grey said and repeated several times that he regretted neither\r\npower nor office, and that for several months past he had felt\r\nenfeebled, without interest in anything, and unable to do any business\r\nexcept with repugnance and lassitude. He confessed that what had made\r\nhim feel most bitter was the conduct of some of his own people,\r\nespecially Lord Durham, whose violence, hauteur, ambition and\r\nintrigues had afflicted him the more as his daughter had been the\r\nfirst to suffer. He could not doubt that Lady Durham's last\r\nmiscarriage was due to her husband's brutality. He told me that in\r\nspite of the terror inspired by his character, it was proposed to give\r\nhim, in the new Cabinet, the place left vacant by Lord Melbourne's\r\ntransfer to the Treasury. Lord Durham's ambition and malevolent\r\nactivity make him so inconvenient to any Ministry of which he is not a\r\nmember, that it seems almost better to admit him, and to try in this\r\nway to neutralise his ill-will. Lord Grey was doubtful, however,\r\nwhether they could make up their minds to do so, he was so much\r\ndetested by every one.\r\n\r\nLord Grey was sure that he had persuaded Lord Althorp to resume his\r\nplace in the Cabinet[25] in spite of the many embarrassments of his\r\nposition. He says that without Lord Althorp they could never control\r\nthe House of Commons. He flattered himself also that he has persuaded\r\nLord Lansdowne to stay, but he was not sure of this. In fact, being\r\npersuaded that the accession to power of either the Tories or the\r\nRadicals would mean revolution, he did all he could with all the\r\nenergy in his power to patch up the miserable Cabinet which has just\r\nbetrayed him. He cannot or will not understand that it is Radicalism\r\nvery thinly veiled just as much as if O'Connell or Cobbett were\r\nalready in office.\r\n\r\n  [25] The new Cabinet was constituted as follows: First Lord of\r\n  the Treasury, Lord Melbourne; Chancellor, Lord Brougham; Lord\r\n  President of the Council, the Marquess of Lansdowne; Secretary of\r\n  State for Foreign Affairs, Viscount Palmerston; Secretary of\r\n  State for the Colonies, Mr. Spring Rice; Chancellor of the\r\n  Exchequer, Lord Althorp; First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord\r\n  Auckland; Postmaster-General, Marquess of Conyngham;\r\n  Paymaster-General of the Forces, Lord John Russell; Chief\r\n  Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Mr. Littelton.\r\n  Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Holland; Home\r\n  Secretary, Viscount Duncannon; President of the Board of Control,\r\n  Mr. Charles Grant; President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Poulett\r\n  Thomson; Secretary of State for War, Mr. Ellice; Lord Privy Seal,\r\n  Lord Mulgrave. Most of these Ministers had been members of the\r\n  previous Cabinet.\r\n\r\nI sat next the Chancellor at the Duchess-Countess of Sutherland's\r\ndinner. He was very genial, and invited me to drink the toast of the\r\nday, the 14th of July. \"At dessert,\" I replied, well knowing that his\r\nrestless mind would forget all about it. As a matter of fact, the\r\nmatter quite slipped his memory. I could not, in any case, have drunk\r\nthe toast, for this date, which has already such unhappy associations,\r\nwas certainly not purified yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor asked me if I had seen Lord Grey and if I was not\r\nstruck with his simplicity, which he said was such that he could\r\nconceal, dissemble and contain nothing. \"He is a child in candour and\r\nthoughtlessness, and he yields to the impressions of every moment.\"\r\n\"His is a very noble nature,\" I replied. \"Yes, yes, no doubt,\" said\r\nhe, \"it is the nature of a very nice child, which reminds me that Mr.\r\nHare, a friend of Mr. Fox as well as of Fitzpatrick and Grey, used\r\nalways to call him 'Baby Grey.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Don Carlos is gone. Some say he embarked on the\r\nThames when he was supposed to be at the Opera, and that he will land\r\nin Spain at one of the points where he is supposed to have a\r\nfollowing. Others, and among them M. de Miraflorès, say that he has\r\ngone viâ France; that M. Calomarde managed the whole thing from Paris,\r\ninstigated by him (Miraflorès) in order to entrap Don Carlos. Anyhow,\r\nhe is gone, and whatever be the result of his enterprise it cannot be\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\n_London, July 16, 1834._--Lord Melbourne's successor at the Home\r\nOffice is known; it is Lord Duncannon, who has been transferred from\r\nthe Woods and Forests, which he leaves to Sir John Cam-Hobhouse. The\r\nlatter is celebrated for his friendship with Lord Byron, his Eastern\r\ntravels, and his very liberal opinions, in which, however, he is less\r\nextreme than Lord Duncannon, who is said to be quite violent. This\r\nshows that the Cabinet has taken on a more decidedly revolutionary\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nYesterday it was certain that Don Carlos had left London; to-day his\r\narrival in Spain is equally beyond doubt. The Tories say he has got to\r\nNavarre after having crossed all France; and this, too, is the version\r\nof M. de Miraflorès, who now perhaps regrets having boasted of having\r\ndeceived the Prince and surrounded him with spies who were to deliver\r\nhim up to the first Spanish outpost, while as a matter of fact he has\r\narrived safe and sound among his own people, by whom, it is said, he\r\nhas been enthusiastically received.\r\n\r\nThe English Ministry yesterday admitted knowing of Don Carlos's\r\narrival in Spain, which is believed to have taken place on the 9th,\r\nbut they say that he landed at a port in Biscaya attended only by a\r\nsingle Frenchman, and that his partisans eagerly welcomed him. It is\r\nasserted that he only went to Spain because the Northern provinces\r\ninvited him, and threatened that they would declare their independence\r\nand constitute themselves a Republic if their natural leader did not\r\ncome to them. It is clear that there must have been great hopes on the\r\none hand and much to lose on the other before a man so timid and so\r\nincapable as Don Carlos could have been persuaded to run such a risk.\r\nMoreover, his conversation with the Duke of Wellington, which I set\r\ndown above, shows that his mind has for several weeks been occupied\r\nwith this plan of going to Spain.\r\n\r\n_London, July 17, 1834._--The friends of the new Ministry are wearing\r\nthemselves out with assertions that the policy of the French alliance\r\nwill not be altered in any way. I believe this is true; but, in the\r\ninterests of both countries, I should have preferred that the alliance\r\nhad been founded on social order and had not depended for its\r\ncontinuance on revolutionary sympathies, which give just cause for\r\nanxiety to the rest of Europe, and may bring about conflicts in which\r\nit would be difficult to predict who will be the victor.\r\n\r\nWe are more and more decided to return to France immediately after\r\nParliament rises, and perhaps even sooner.\r\n\r\nOur more distant future is not yet to be foreseen, but Lord Grey's\r\nexample is another proof that the great figures of history should\r\nthemselves choose the circumstances of their retirement, and should\r\nnot wait till it is imposed upon them by the mistakes or the perfidy\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nYesterday we received the two first volumes of a book, entitled _M. de\r\nTalleyrand_. I have hardly looked at it, but M. de Talleyrand has read\r\nit. He says that nothing could be more stupid, false, tedious, and\r\nill-imagined, and that he would not pay five shillings to have it\r\nsuppressed. I admit that I am less philosophic, and that on occasions\r\nof this sort--which in a libellous age like ours are so numerous--I\r\nalways remember a saying of La Bruyère's, which seems to me remarkably\r\ntrue. \"Excessive calumny,\" he says, \"like excessive praise, always\r\nleaves a trace behind.\" As a matter of fact, the world is divided into\r\nthe foolish and the malevolent, and so there are always people who\r\nwill believe what is improbable, especially about an opponent.\r\n\r\n_London, July 18, 1834._--Fatuity in men is a thing which spreads from\r\none point to all the rest. M. de Miraflorès, who is very pushing with\r\nwomen and rather ridiculous, is not less presumptuous in politics. He\r\nlaunches out madly and credits himself with successes which are only\r\ndue to the personal passions of the people, and which will perhaps\r\nhardly be justified by the final result. Thus he proclaims himself the\r\ninventor of the Quadruple Alliance, the first idea of which was\r\nsuggested to him by Lord Palmerston. Now that Don Carlos's\r\nreappearance on Spanish territory renews the old difficulties, the\r\nlittle Marquis, _proprio motu_, without waiting for orders from his\r\nGovernment, sends a perfect _olla podrida_ of a note--a masterpiece of\r\nabsurdity--appealing to France and England to extend the scope of the\r\ntreaty whose object was believed to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe present circumstances are, however, very different. Three months\r\nago the two Pretenders, Miguel and Carlos, were both penned up in a\r\nlittle corner of Portugal, and were thus more particularly the\r\nbusiness of England. Now Don Carlos is in the north of Spain, near the\r\nFrench frontier. Will England carry her revolutionary tendencies so\r\nfar as to allow a French army to enter the Peninsula? Would not that\r\nbe the signal for Lord Palmerston's resignation? On the other hand,\r\ncan France, after declaring against Don Carlos, allow him again to\r\nseize a power which he would use against her? It is not that the\r\nGovernment of the Queen-Regent, which becomes more and more decrepit,\r\nis likely to be a very good neighbour. King Louis-Philippe finds\r\nhimself in the dilemma of being faced on the other side of the\r\nPyrenees either with the Republican or the Legitimist principle. The\r\n_mezzo termine_ can only be maintained by armed force--in fact, by\r\nconquest!\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a very true remark made by M. de Talleyrand which\r\nhas often come back to my mind during the last four years. It was said\r\nin the midst of the intoxication of the great days of 1830. M. de\r\nTalleyrand found one of his friends full of hopes and illusions,\r\npatriotic phrases and emotion, over the scene at the Hôtel de Ville,\r\nthe Lafayette accolades, and the popularity of Louis-Philippe.\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"what is wanting in all this is a trifle of\r\nconquest.\"\r\n\r\nThey say that in Spain Martinez de la Rosa is _passé_, and can no\r\nlonger maintain himself in power; he will be replaced by Toreno, and\r\nwill become President of the House of Peers. It is also said that the\r\nQueen-Regent will create him Marquis de l'Alliance.\r\n\r\n_London, July 19, 1834._--Everything that is happening here reminds\r\none of the first scenes of the French Revolution. The analogy is\r\nstriking, the copy a trifle too servile. The aristocracy, the minority\r\nof the nobility, the _tiers état_, have each their counterparts in the\r\nTories, the Whigs, and the Radicals. The Whigs are blinded by jealousy\r\nand personal ambition, and will not see that they have any other\r\nenemies than the Tories; they see no danger except on that side, and\r\nin order to keep their rivals out of office they are precipitating\r\nthemselves and all their class into the abyss which has been dug for\r\nthem by the Radicals.\r\n\r\nIn talking over all this yesterday M. de Talleyrand quoted a remark\r\nmade to him by the Abbé Sieyès during the sittings of the Constituent\r\nassembly. \"Yes, we get on very well now that we are discussing only\r\n_Liberty_; it is when we get on to _Equality_ that we shall quarrel.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very lively sitting of the Lords of the day before yesterday\r\nMinisters very clearly marked out the line they mean to follow, and\r\nthe very men who in Lord Grey's time, less than a fortnight ago, held\r\nthe repressive clauses of the Coercion Bill to be indispensable,\r\nannounced their abandonment amid the jeers and scoffs of the House.\r\nThis was as much as to say that the Cabinet in order to survive was\r\nputting itself at the disposal of the Radical majority in the House of\r\nCommons, was flouting the opposition of the Lords and doing its best\r\nto make it of no account. As one might expect, the irritation which\r\nresults from this is sharply expressed in the Upper House. All the\r\nconsolation Ministers have is the approbation which O'Connell is good\r\nenough to bestow upon them.\r\n\r\n_London, July 20, 1834._--I much prefer Lord Grey's second speech\r\ndelivered the day before yesterday in the House of Lords to make clear\r\nhis position which had been misrepresented by both parties, to the\r\nfirst speech in which he announced his resignation. The latter I\r\nthought was too long and too tearful, and entered too minutely into\r\nhis family affairs. The speech of the day before yesterday was more\r\nlaconic, and more closely argued; its dignity was remarkable and,\r\nwhile avoiding any bitterness or personality, the speaker exposed the\r\nchicanery which had forced him to retire. He remains well disposed to\r\nthe guiltiest parties and full of kindness to his successors as\r\nindividuals, but he will have nothing to do with their policy. His\r\nretirement in accordance with his own instincts is greeted with the\r\napplause of all sensible people, the humiliation of those whom he has\r\nquitted, and the lively displeasure of all those who are the real\r\nenemies of social order.\r\n\r\nA fortnight ago I confess Lord Grey seemed to me nothing more than an\r\nold man worn out, shaken to pieces, and on the point of being\r\ndiscredited. Since his resignation his last political acts have been\r\nillumined with a brilliant gleam. His fine talent for oratory which he\r\nexercised so long in opposition has recovered all its energy now that\r\nhe is out of office again, and it may be truly said that Lord Grey who\r\nhas had one fall after another has again reached the foremost place\r\nnow that he has got free of the shameful ambuscades by which he has\r\nbeen overpowered. The Cabinet is now much afraid of him and would fall\r\nlow indeed if Lord Grey was not compassionate enough to throw over it\r\nthe mantle of his protection. His colleagues, who lately spoke of him\r\nwith more pity than respect, tremble at his words to-day. Ah! how wise\r\nit is not to survive one's self in politics, and how necessary it is\r\nto choose time fitting for retreat.\r\n\r\nA resignation which is both less important and less honourable is that\r\nof Marshal Soult.[26] The reasons for his disappearance which is\r\naccepted by the King and little regretted by the Cabinet, are said to\r\nbe internal quarrels about the question whether Algeria shall have a\r\nmilitary or a civil governor--about a speech from the Throne, more or\r\nless detailed, which is to be delivered on July 31 next, but above all\r\nthe terror of the Army estimates which the Marshal is said to be\r\nafraid to face next session. They say that they will offer his place\r\nto Marshal Gérard.\r\n\r\n  [26] Marshal Soult had been President of the Council since 1832.\r\n  He resigned that office in July 1834.\r\n\r\nMost fortunately for the Queen Regent of Spain some accident seems to\r\nhave happened which will enable her to appear at the opening of the\r\nCortès. She has much need of a piece of good luck to re-establish her\r\nposition which she has so curiously compromised by her frivolity and\r\ninconsequence.\r\n\r\nLord Howick, eldest son of Lord Grey, who has no great reputation for\r\neither physical or intellectual merit, has just resigned his position\r\nas Under Secretary of State at the Home Office, thus following his\r\nfather's example and fortunes. This is the only instance of fidelity\r\nwhich his father is likely to encounter.\r\n\r\nYesterday I saw Lady Cowper at her own house; she seemed to me\r\ndepressed and preoccupied. With her intelligence it is difficult for\r\nher not to be afflicted by conduct in her relatives and friends which\r\nis so wanting in credit. She pointed out to me not without reason the\r\nchange which has come over London life and society, the care people\r\ntake to avoid each other, the hostile way in which they speak of each\r\nother, the unrest of every one, their distrust of the present, their\r\ngloomy forebodings for the future, the general disorganisation, the\r\ndispersion of the diplomatic corps, and the absence of all government\r\nand all authority. This was striking language from the sister of the\r\nPremier and the intimate friend of the Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\nShe tried hard to persuade me that the offence given by the latter to\r\nthe corps diplomatique, and in particular to M. de Talleyrand, should\r\nnot be attributed to any evil intention but simply to a certain\r\nneglect of forms which may well be excused in a man overwhelmed with\r\nwork. She seemed to be especially embarrassed by the thought that M.\r\nde Talleyrand might take Lord Palmerston's conduct to him as a reason\r\nfor retiring. She used all her wit in fact, all her charm and good\r\ntaste, and she has all these qualities in a high degree, to justify\r\nher friends and to mitigate the bitterness which they have provoked. I\r\nleft her much pleased with her way of putting things but not at all\r\nconverted on essential points.\r\n\r\n_London, July 21, 1834._--The great need in which the Ministry find\r\nthemselves of some speaker in the House of Lords less discredited than\r\nthe Chancellor and cleverer than the other Ministers who are peers,\r\nhas led them to make a most extraordinary proposition, characteristic\r\nof the absolute want of sense and refinement which distinguishes\r\nHolland House. They seriously suggested that Lord Grey should remain,\r\nnot as Prime Minister, but as Lord Privy Seal! He had the good taste\r\nto laugh at this proposal, taking it as a thing too grotesque to take\r\noffence at. But how could they have had the impudence to make such a\r\nrequest?\r\n\r\nHowever, everything is so strange just now that one need be surprised\r\nat nothing. Here for example is the full story of how Lord Melbourne\r\ndischarged the task committed to him by the King of doing his best to\r\nform a Coalition Ministry. No doubt the thing was impossible; still,\r\nLord Melbourne chose a curious way of bringing it about. He wrote on\r\nbehalf of the King to the Duke of Wellington and to Sir Robert Peel\r\ntelling them of the commission with which he had been entrusted, and\r\nadding that in order to save them trouble he would send them a copy of\r\nthe letter which he had just written to His Majesty showing how he\r\nhimself regarded the question. This letter contained nothing but a\r\nstrong argument against any attempt at agreement with the other side\r\nand an enumeration of all the difficulties which made coalition\r\nimpossible. The Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel replied by\r\nacknowledging his letter and thanking him respectfully for the\r\ncommunication made to them on behalf of the King. The King was\r\nsurprised that these gentlemen did not reply in greater detail and\r\nsent to ask for their observations. They answered: \"They are all\r\ncontained in Lord Melbourne's letter to His Majesty, we have nothing\r\nto add.\" Thus the curious negotiation terminated.\r\n\r\n_London, July 22, 1834._--The phase of calm and prosperity through\r\nwhich the French Government seemed again to be passing seems to be\r\nrather disturbed by the dissensions of the Ministers among themselves\r\nwhich have been caused by the resignation of Marshal Soult. It appears\r\nthat people are anxious and divided in opinion on the length and the\r\ngreater or less importance of the short session announced for July 31.\r\nIt comes at an inconvenient time for discussing events in the\r\nPeninsula, and the flood of oratory will probably embarrass the\r\nGovernment. Were Don Carlos to prevail we should have a personal enemy\r\non our frontiers; if the Queen-Regent triumphs, which she can only do\r\nby throwing herself more and more into the \"movement,\" we shall have a\r\nrevolutionary and anarchist neighbour. This could not be indifferent\r\nto our Government, which already has only too much of the same sort of\r\nthing to contend with. It seems, moreover, that the two armies were\r\ntoo near each other not to come to blows, and the first decisive\r\nsuccess of either side will probably settle the subsequent course of\r\nthe conflict. Thus the issue is awaited with great and anxious\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nNow that the quarrel is no longer being fought out in Portugal, but in\r\nSpain, the English are drawing out of it, and will give only slight\r\nsupport to their dear Miraflorès. The burden of the business is\r\nreserved for France, and it bristles with difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn the City yesterday news was spread of the death of the\r\nQueen-Regent. Some said she had been poisoned; some that she had died\r\nof the results of the accident which had led to her retirement. The\r\nnews is probably false, but in a country like Spain, in time of civil\r\nwar, religious fanaticism, family jealousy and quarrels run riot; evil\r\npassions of all sorts are let loose, and no crime is more improbable\r\nthan the daily spectacle of folly and disorder.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley, who replaces Lord Howick as Under-Secretary of State at\r\nthe Home Office, is quite different from the Mr. Stanley who was\r\nlately in office. He is a kind of would-be dandy, and a complete\r\nRadical of the worst and lowest sort. He was for a time private\r\nsecretary to Lord Durham.\r\n\r\nThe latter has contemptuously refused the embassy at Paris, which, as\r\nhe well knew, was only offered to him because he is not wanted here.\r\nHe replied that he would accept no place from a Cabinet which would\r\nnot receive him as one of themselves. Lord Carlisle has resigned the\r\nPrivy Seal.\r\n\r\n_London, July 24, 1834._--It was generally said yesterday that the\r\nInfanta Maria Princess of Portugal and wife of Don Carlos, has also\r\nsecretly left England to follow her husband to Spain, leaving her\r\nchildren here with her sister the Duchess of Beira. Princess Maria is\r\nsaid to be possessed of much courage and decision of character.\r\nProbably she thinks that she has more than her husband, and that her\r\npresence will inspire the Pretender with all the energy which he needs\r\nin his difficult situation. All these Portuguese Princesses are demons\r\neither in politics or in love, and sometimes in both. One of them,\r\nmarried to a Marquis de Loulé, had an adventure with a British naval\r\nofficer, which caused much scandal at Lisbon. M. de Loulé was furious\r\nand sent away his wife, keeping the children. Dom Pedro required his\r\nbrother-in-law to take her back, but I did not hear how the matter\r\nended.\r\n\r\nPrincess Isabella also caused some talk while she was Regent, and Dom\r\nMiguel, it is said, tried to give her poison in a vegetable soup. She\r\nis now at Lisbon, reunited to the rest of her family, or, rather, her\r\nrelatives, for love and hate are alike so perverse in the House of\r\nBraganza that they can hardly be said to respect in any way the\r\nnatural family ties.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of Pretenders and curious manners, Lord Burghersh yesterday\r\ntold me a great deal about the Countess of Albany, whom he knew at\r\nFlorence. There she had as _cavaliere servente_ M. Fabre, the painter,\r\nwho had lived with her since the death of Alfieri. They used to walk\r\nout alone, with only M. Fabre's big dog to keep them company. They\r\nalso dined alone. From eight to eleven the Countess received all\r\nFlorence. While this was going on M. Fabre retired to a mistress of an\r\ninferior order. At eleven he reappeared at the Countess's, and his\r\narrival was the signal for the whole company to disperse in order that\r\nthey might sup _tête-à-tête_. The one was never asked out without the\r\nother; this is the etiquette in Italy, and is carried to a naïve\r\nextreme. Here is an example: Lord Burghersh, who was British Minister\r\nat Florence, opened his house with a great ball, to which he thought\r\nthat he had invited every one of importance. However, not being as\r\nyet very well up in the manners and customs of society, he forgot to\r\ninvite a gentleman who was attached to a certain fair lady. On the\r\nmorning of the ball my lord's steward came to him with an open letter\r\nwhich he had just received, and which he asked his master to read.\r\nLord Burghersh read as follows: \"_Sapete, caro Matteo, che sono\r\nservita da il Cavaliere_ so-and-so; he is not invited to Lord\r\nBurghersh's, which, as you will understand, makes it impossible for me\r\nto go to his ball; please correct this mistake.\" The mistake was, in\r\nfact, corrected, and Lord Burghersh never forgot the lesson.\r\n\"_Sapete_\" to a servant, and \"_sono servita_\" are expressions of a\r\n_naïveté_ which is almost beyond belief, yet quite according to\r\nItalian manners. But, to return to the Countess of Albany and M.\r\nFabre, her ladyship having died, M. Fabre painted a portrait of the\r\ndog, the companion of their walks, had it engraved, and sent a proof\r\nto each of the Countess's friends with the following inscription: \"To\r\nthe friends of the Countess of Albany from M. Fabre's dog.\"\r\n\r\n_London, July 25, 1834_.--The Ministry grows very bitter against Lord\r\nGrey, being incensed at his dignified retirement and his just disdain\r\nof the preposterous proposal of the Privy Seal. He is called weak,\r\nincapable and capricious, and insult is added to perfidy. The thin\r\nveil with which this treacherous conduct is covered does not conceal\r\nit sufficiently to prevent Lord Grey himself from beginning to be\r\nembittered by it. I know that he has said that if his successors went\r\nanother step in the direction of revolution he would not only cease to\r\nvote for them but openly declare against them. Decidedly he has\r\nreturned to his better instincts, and I believe he will have the\r\ncourage to purge himself, so far as that is possible, of the\r\nimputation of having led England along a road to ruin.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell the mildest, the wittiest, and the most honourable\r\nof Jacobins, the most simple minded and the most candid of\r\nrevolutionaries, the most agreeable, but also by the very reason of\r\nhis virtue, the most dangerous of Ministers, was telling me yesterday\r\nthat some months ago he had a violent argument with Lord Grey about a\r\nmeasure on which they did not agree. On this occasion, Lord Grey\r\ndeclared to him that he would never consent to put his name to a\r\nrevolutionary measure. \"After Reform,\" added Lord John in his mild\r\nlittle way, \"this showed great weakness and want of logic.\" \"You would\r\nbe right,\" I replied, \"if Lord Grey, when he allowed you to pass the\r\nReform Bill, had foreseen all the consequences; but you will agree\r\nwith me that he did not foresee them, and that you took good care not\r\nto point them out to him in time.\" Lord John laughed and said very\r\ncharmingly, \"You don't expect me to confess, do you?\" If all the\r\nrevolutionaries were of the type of Cobbett and O'Connell, or of the\r\nill-bred and cynical nature of Lord Brougham, it would be easier to be\r\non one's guard. But in the witty, fragile figure of the Duke of\r\nBedford's son how could one suspect that there lurks so much\r\nperversity of judgment, how could one imagine that a body to all\r\nappearance so frail and exhausted could be capable of such persistence\r\nin thought and such violence in action?\r\n\r\n_London, July 29, 1834._--An expedition to Woburn Abbey has\r\ninterrupted this journal. This, the third visit which I have paid to\r\nthis splendid place, was much pleasanter to me personally than the two\r\nothers, but it has furnished me with nothing to add to my previous\r\ndescriptions of it. Nothing happened there at all out of the ordinary\r\ncourse of English country-house life. The hospitality dispensed is on\r\na great and generous scale with a little more pomp and ceremony than\r\none wants in country life, at least according to Continental ideas.\r\n\r\nA party at Woburn in particular is as carefully arranged as a London\r\ndinner-party. Twenty or thirty persons who know each other, but not\r\nfamiliarly, are invited to be together for two or three days. The\r\nhosts go to their house for the special purpose of receiving their\r\nguests, and return to town after their departure. They have thus\r\nthemselves the air of being on a visit. However, when all is said and\r\ndone, there is so much to see and admire; the Duke of Bedford is so\r\ncharming, such a perfect embodiment of the _grand seigneur_; the\r\nDuchess is so attentive, that it is impossible not to carry away with\r\none the most pleasing impressions. My own impression was particularly\r\nso, and this in spite of the rather melancholy cloud on the\r\ncountenances of some of the leading figures. Lord Grey, for instance,\r\nhas collapsed in a rather startling way; he seems ill and worn out,\r\nand takes no trouble to conceal his attitude, which is becoming more\r\nand more bitter. The most voluntary of abdications are always followed\r\nby regrets; one may die of overwork; one flickers out when one is\r\nshelved. It is so difficult to be satisfied both with one's self and\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven, also, despite all her efforts, was fainting under\r\nthe burden of saying good-bye, of going away and staying away. She is\r\nreally very unhappy, and I am very sorry for her. This is the more the\r\ncase as no person of ability has ever found less resources within\r\nherself than she. She always relies for help on her surroundings. She\r\nmust have the stir of news and conversation, and when she is alone\r\nthere is nothing left for her to do but to go to sleep. She weeps to\r\nhave to quit England; she fears St. Petersburg, but what she feels\r\nmost is the journey--a week of solitude! Her husband and children\r\ndon't count! She will stay a day at Hamburg solely for the purpose of\r\nexchanging a few words with new people. She seized with avidity the\r\nidea of arranging that the Baron and Baroness de Talleyrand should\r\nvisit her, though she has never seen them and does not know whether\r\nthey will amuse her. She was obviously consoled when she managed to\r\npersuade Lord Alvanley to go on his way to Carlsbad by Hamburg in the\r\nsame packet as herself, and this though Lord Alvanley warned her that\r\nsea-sickness made him very bad company. For her, indeed, _ennui_ is\r\nlike a conscience; her one idea is to fly from herself.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to London we heard of the Madrid massacres--always\r\nthe same horrible fable of the poisoned wells, which infuriates\r\npopular ignorance wherever there is an epidemic of cholera, and\r\nproduces mad atrocities. The monks have been the victims on this\r\noccasion, and the convents have been pillaged in spite of religious\r\nfanaticism. The hand of authority was weak and impotent: the\r\nGovernment had retired to St. Ildephonse, terrified and irresolute,\r\nnot knowing whether in these melancholy circumstances of plague, riot\r\nand civil war, the Cortès should be summoned or prorogued, or, if they\r\nshould be summoned, to what place or under whose auspices! It is\r\nimpossible to imagine a concourse of circumstances more melancholy in\r\nthemselves, more fatal for Spain, or more unpleasing neighbours for\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nLouis-Philippe is very unwilling to interfere openly and directly in\r\nthe destinies of Spain. He has even showed this unwillingness so\r\nclearly, that the Ambassadors at Paris have divined his secret and are\r\ntaking great advantage of it. The attitude of the Ministry, which has\r\nto reckon more directly with the national vanity and susceptibility,\r\nis much less decided. This is the situation in which the Chambers will\r\nmeet the day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief ostensible motives for Marshal Soult's retirement was\r\nhis insistence on the appointment of a soldier to govern Algiers in\r\nopposition to the rest of the Cabinet which demanded that the Governor\r\nshould be a civilian. It appears that Marshal Gérard took the same\r\nline as his predecessor, and that his friendship with the King has\r\nenabled him to carry his point; anyhow, General Drouet d'Erlou has\r\njust been appointed to the post.\r\n\r\n_London, July 31, 1834._--Last year, when M. de Talleyrand left for\r\nthe Continent, the King of England said to him, \"When are you coming\r\nback?\" The year before he had said, \"I have told my Ambassador at\r\nParis to say to your Government that I particularly wish to have you\r\nhere.\" This year he says, \"When are you going?\" I think one can find\r\nin these varying expressions a trace of Palmerstonian influence.\r\n\r\nYesterday at the King's _levée_ Lord Mulgrave received the Privy Seal\r\nwhich Lord Carlisle has resigned.\r\n\r\nIn our drawing-room the conversation turned on the talent of certain\r\npeople for telling ghost stories. This reminded me of the interest\r\nwith which two years ago at Kew[27] I heard from the Duchess of\r\nCumberland the story of an apparition seen by herself, the remembrance\r\nof which seemed to cause her much emotion. The impression she produced\r\non us was the deeper as the hour was late and a terrifying\r\nthunderstorm was raging outside the house.\r\n\r\n  [27] Kew is situated on the right bank of the Thames. The palace\r\n  was for some time the residence of the Duke and Duchess of\r\n  Cumberland before their accession to the Throne of Hanover. There\r\n  are an Observatory and a Botanical Garden at Kew, which were\r\n  founded by George III.\r\n\r\nThe story is as follows. The Duchess of Cumberland, then Princess\r\nLouise of Prussia, had gone to visit her mother's relatives at\r\nDarmstadt. She was lodged in a state apartment in a part of the castle\r\nwhich was rarely used, the furniture of which, though magnificent, had\r\nnot been changed for three generations. Wearied with her journey she\r\nquickly fell asleep but all the same soon felt on her face a breath\r\nwhich awakened her. She opened her eyes and saw the face of an old\r\nlady who was leaning over her own face. Terrified by the sight she\r\nimmediately drew the bed-clothes over her eyes and remained motionless\r\nfor several moments. Want of air, however, made her change her\r\nposition and impelled by curiosity she again opened her eyes and saw\r\nthe same venerable face, pale and gentle, still staring at her. She\r\nthen screamed loudly and the nurse of Prince Frederick of Prussia who\r\nslept with the child in the neighbouring room, the door of\r\ncommunication being open, rushed in and, finding her mistress bathed\r\nin a cold sweat, remained with her for the rest of the night. Next day\r\nthe Princess related what had happened, and urgently requested that\r\nher room might be changed, which was done. No one was surprised for it\r\nwas said in the family that whenever any descendant of the old Duchess\r\nof Darmstadt, who had occupied this apartment, slept there, this\r\nvenerable ancestress would come and pay her posterity a visit. The\r\nDuke of Weimar and several other princes were cited as examples\r\nproving the truth of this story. Many years later the Duchess of\r\nCumberland, then Princess Solms, and established at Frankfort, was\r\ninvited by her cousin, the Grand Duke of Hesse Darmstadt, to a great\r\nfestivity which he was preparing. The Princess went, intending to\r\nreturn to Frankfort the same night. Supper over she went to a room\r\nwhere her travelling dress had been laid out and was followed by the\r\nyoung Grand Duchess then recently married. The latter asked the\r\nPrincess Solms whether the story of the ghost was true and asked that\r\nit might be told her in detail. She wished to discover whether the\r\nimpression left had been strong enough to make the Princess remember\r\nthe features of their venerable ancestress. The Princess was sure that\r\nit was so. \"Very well,\" said the Grand Duchess \"her portrait is in\r\nthis very room with two others of the same period. Take the light and\r\ntell me which you think represents the spectre, I shall see if you are\r\nright.\" The Princess with some repugnance approached the portraits and\r\nhad just recognised that of the old grandmother when the picture and\r\nits frame crashed to the ground with a terrible noise and, had the\r\nladies not immediately fled, they would have been crushed by its\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nI do not say that this story is particularly good in itself. I only\r\nknow that it made a deep impression on me because it was very well\r\ntold, and because, when in this style of narrative you hear some one\r\nsay \"I saw, I heard,\" it is impossible not to treat the matter\r\nseriously. The Duchess was perfectly serious and her emotion strong,\r\nso that I have never doubted the truth of what she told us.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Cumberland's absence has left, for me at least, a gap\r\nwhich is very noticeable in London. She is clever and well educated,\r\nher manners are most refined and very queenly, she is graceful and\r\nkindly and still beautiful, especially in figure. Her kindness to me\r\nhas been enhanced by her again lately bestowing it on my second son.\r\nIn fact, whatever judgment be passed on her character, which is not\r\nequally admired by everybody, it is impossible not to recognise that\r\nshe possesses great qualities and not to be touched by her great\r\naffliction--the infirmity of her son Prince George. He is an amiable,\r\ngood-looking youth, who at fifteen after terrible suffering has lost\r\nhis sight. He is a fit object at once of pity and admiration; his\r\nresignation is angelic, he shows no impatience, no regrets, no ill\r\ntemper, and he hides his sadness from his mother. He sustains the\r\ncourage of his attendants by his own, and, young as he is, he already\r\ninspires all the respect due to a great character. His favourite\r\noccupation is improvising on the piano, and his favourite melodies are\r\nsad and serious; but when he recognises his mother's step he changes\r\nto a gay and animated theme to make her think he is happy. So long as\r\nit was hoped that remedies might check the inflammation and restore\r\nhim his sight his education was suspended. After a time, however, his\r\ntutor--an excellent man--became convinced that his education was\r\nsuffering and his sight not profiting by this and he proposed that the\r\nyoung Prince should resume the course of his studies and continue them\r\nas far as possible without the aid of sight, on a plan submitted by\r\nhim. Prince George was silent for a time, then said with a serious\r\nair, \"Yes sir, you are right, I shall follow your advice for I feel\r\nthat as one door is being closed for me I must try all the harder to\r\nopen another.\"\r\n\r\n_London, August 1, 1834._--What a melancholy dinner we had last night\r\nat Lord Palmerston's! It was a farewell party for the Princesse de\r\nLieven. She went against her will, we simply for her sake. Lady Cowper\r\nwas making visible efforts to appear at ease, Lady Holland wanted\r\nexplanations of Lord Palmerston's latest offences against M. de\r\nTalleyrand; every one obviously felt that our approaching departure\r\nwill be as final as that of the unfortunate Princess. M. de Bülow was\r\npale and embarrassed and looked like a pickpocket caught in the act.\r\nPoor Dedel resembled an orphan at the funeral of both his parents.\r\nLord Melbourne with his coarse Norman farmer style of build looked\r\nlike anything rather than a Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe defeat which the Ministry purposely incurred yesterday in the\r\nHouse of Commons by letting the Radicals beat them on the question of\r\nthe Irish Church did not make them look very happy, and in fact there\r\nwas a melancholy sense of embarrassment in everything and on\r\neverybody, which oppressed me excessively.\r\n\r\nI had not the courage this morning to go and say good-bye for the last\r\ntime to poor Madame de Lieven, who is half dead with weariness and\r\nemotion. It was really kinder not to increase her agitation. I am\r\ndistressed at her departure as it separates me from a personage of\r\nreal distinction without much hope of seeing her again; but it also\r\nbrings home to me in the most painful manner the changes which have\r\ntaken place here during the last four years, and which have done so\r\nmuch to dim the brilliancy and splendour of England. What losses the\r\n_Corps Diplomatique_ has suffered! Kind and gentle M. Falk with all\r\nhis subtlety, his learning, and his wit, is replaced, first by the\r\ncross-grained M. de Zuylen, and now by the excellent but insignificant\r\nDedel. Madame Falk's frank and simple high spirits are also much\r\nmissed. M. and Madame de Zea were more intelligent by far than the\r\nliliputian Miraflorès, M. and Madame de Münster, were in every way\r\nmuch superior to the Omptedas. I can find no one to replace the\r\nexcellent Madame de Bülow, and I believe that her absence has left her\r\nhusband's evil tendencies far too much without the check which his\r\nwife's simple and honest nature imposed. Esterhazy is universally\r\nregretted. His perfect good-humour, the certainty of his social touch,\r\nthe ease of his character, the magnificence of his way of life, the\r\nsubtlety of his wit, the correctness of his judgment, and the kindness\r\nof his heart made him much beloved here, and not likely to be\r\nforgotten. Wessenberg has also left a vacant place which has not been\r\nfilled. The departure of the Lievens enlarges the social breach, and\r\nour own will complete the ruin. The neutral ground afforded by\r\ndiplomatic households is especially valuable in a country divided by\r\nparty spirit, in which, politics having broken so many other ties,\r\nsociety can no long hold together in the old way.\r\n\r\nWe learned yesterday by telegraph that the Queen Regent of Spain had\r\nopened the Cortès in person at Madrid on the 24th; that order was\r\nrestored in the city; that the cholera was diminishing a little; and\r\nthat Don Carlos was retiring further and further towards the French\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n_London, August 3, 1834._--Nothing, I think, shows more clearly the\r\nstate into which the home policy of the English Government has fallen\r\nthan a remark made to me yesterday by Lord Sefton. \"Do you know,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that, in spite of my admiration for Lord Grey, I think that we\r\nhave come to a point at which it is not only fortunate for himself but\r\na very good thing for the country that he has retired? He would never\r\nhave consented to the slightest courtesy being shown to O'Connell and\r\nhis friends, and yet we have no alternative but to satisfy them. It is\r\nurgently necessary to conciliate them by condescensions against which\r\nLord Grey would have rebelled, and which are less repulsive to his\r\nsuccessors, from my friend the Chancellor downwards. It is a good\r\nthing, you see, that we have a Government composed of people who have\r\nno objection to condescend as much as may be necessary!\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be general approval of the speech made by the Queen of\r\nSpain. In order to appreciate it properly one must know the condition\r\nof the country better than I do. The best wish I can send her Majesty\r\nis that she may not again have to deliver such a long one, and that\r\nthe circumstances of her future speeches may be very different. They\r\nsay that she spoke very gracefully. She deserves praise for having\r\nrecovered her nerve, and run the risk of infection in coming back to\r\naddress the Cortès.\r\n\r\nThe cholera is carrying off many people at Madrid. The sanitary\r\narrangements are bad; the heat is torrid, and cleanliness is unknown.\r\nTwice as many women as men fall victims to the disease. The mother of\r\nMadame de Miraflorès is among those who have succumbed.\r\n\r\nDon Carlos, it appears, is on the point of recrossing the frontier. It\r\nis said that he is so close to it that his outposts and the French\r\noutposts are in sight of each other.\r\n\r\nI don't know what ill wind is blowing in Paris, but I incline to think\r\nthat all is not so quiet there as it seems. Here is an extract from a\r\nletter from Bertin de Veaux on this subject: \"It seems that you and\r\nthe Prince de Talleyrand are fated never to come to Paris except\r\nduring a Ministerial crisis, for our Ministry is no steadier than\r\nthat in London. Here, moreover, people have made up their minds to\r\nlive from hand to mouth and, except the actors, no one pays any\r\nattention to the play. However, when you do come your _salon_ will\r\nsoon be full, and it is before you and the Prince that all our actors,\r\ngreat and small, will come and try their 'poses,' as they call them\r\nnowadays.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter there is a great deal about the dangers of to-day\r\nand to-morrow, of the obvious aspirations of some people, of\r\nunder-currents and cross-currents, of the cabals, and the unmeasured\r\nambition of certain small men, and the ill-temper and sullenness of\r\nthe rest. _A propos_ of the cruel disappointments experienced by M.\r\nDecazes, it is added: \"Poor M. Decazes may strike the earth all round\r\nhim as loudly as he likes; he can make nothing emerge. It is said that\r\nhe now wants Semonville's place, and that he has perhaps some chance\r\nof getting it as Semonville is a convenient person to disoblige, being\r\nformidable to nobody. I do not at all like this habit of burying\r\npeople before they are dead, and I thought that they had had enough of\r\nit since their attempt on MM. de Marbois and Gaëte, which was not a\r\nsuccess with the public. One is quite delighted when one comes home to\r\nfind that one has not been robbed of anything.\"\r\n\r\n_London, August 4, 1834._--It seems certain that on the eve of the\r\nopening of the Cortès, a very extensive Republican conspiracy was\r\ndiscovered, in which many important persons were concerned. Palafox\r\nand Romero have been arrested; they say that their supporters were\r\nchiefly in Galicia. In Aragon and Catalonia the Carlists are the\r\ndominating faction, and are making themselves troublesome. Thus there\r\nare two flags under which Spain divides and arrays herself.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Backhouse went to see Don Carlos in the _Donegal_ the latter\r\nsaid that he had heard of the treaty of Quadruple Alliance, but wished\r\nto see the text. Having read it, he returned it to Mr. Backhouse\r\nwithout remark but with an ironical smile, which became a disdainful\r\nlaugh when Mr. Backhouse said to him that he believed the Prince to\r\nbe mistaken about the strength of his party in Spain. Except for this\r\nthe Prince was polite, gentle, and even kindly.\r\n\r\nParliament was to have risen on the 12th, and most members hoped to\r\nleave London even earlier. But the day before yesterday the Duke of\r\nWellington called a meeting of his supporters at his house, and begged\r\nthem to remain at their posts in the interest of the safety of the\r\ncountry, and to use their majority, which is admitted to be\r\nformidable, on the dissenting question, to strike another blow for the\r\nChurch on the debate on the remaining measures which have still to be\r\ndiscussed. There is some reason to fear that the Irish Protestant\r\nclergy will be left without means of subsistence if O'Connell's Tithes\r\nBill is rejected, and this makes it rather doubtful what course the\r\nLords will take. The Bishops, however, seem to think that the Bill\r\nwould be just as bad for them as even the absence of any financial\r\nprovision. It is certain that this week marks the crisis of the\r\naffair: if the Bill is thrown out there will be a collision between\r\nthe two Houses. Will the Ministry resign? Or will it demand _carte\r\nblanche_ of the King? Will this be a further step in the direction of\r\nrevolution? Or will they be satisfied, as the Chancellor said\r\nyesterday, to leave the Irish clergy to die of hunger? Lord Grey said\r\nthat it would not be so easy to leave them to die of hunger, as there\r\nwas a law which enacted that their subsistence must be provided for,\r\nwhether by tithes or otherwise. As to a creation of Peers, it was\r\nobserved that it would be necessary to create a hundred and fifty, and\r\non this Lord Grey said that two hundred would not be enough, because\r\nall the old Peerage, and himself at their head, would revolt against\r\nany Government mad and wicked enough to proceed to such an extremity.\r\nBesides, it remained to be seen whether the King would consent. The\r\nKing is ill, depressed and exhausted; he admits as much himself, and\r\nespecially his mental preoccupation, which he does not attempt to\r\nconceal. He is obviously suffering from extreme oppression, and from\r\ngreat weakness of one eye, which he can hardly open.\r\n\r\nThis is what passed about the Garter vacant by the death of Lord\r\nBathurst. The King sent it to Lord Melbourne as his Prime Minister.\r\nThe latter respectfully declined it and begged that His Majesty would\r\nbestow it on the recipient Lord Grey would have chosen, that is to\r\nsay, on the Duke of Grafton. The King did in fact send it to the Duke,\r\nbut he, deeply affected by the death of his favourite son, and\r\nmoreover feeling himself aged and averse from the world, begged His\r\nMajesty to give it to some one who would be able to show it more\r\noften, and who would be more active in his service. It is thought that\r\nit will go to the Duke of Norfolk, but he is a Catholic, and it would\r\nbe the first instance of such a favour being conferred on a dissenter.\r\n\r\nA heavy blow has just fallen on the Duke of Wellington in the midst of\r\nthe heavy cares which devolve on him as Leader of the Opposition. Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, a clever and sensible woman, who was both discreet and\r\ndevoted and the Duke's faithful friend, has just been carried off by a\r\nfew days violent illness. She was in all the flower of her age, and\r\nhitherto her health had been robust. The Duke has thus lost in one\r\nweek his old friend Lord Bathurst, and Mrs. Arbuthnot his confidante,\r\nhis consolation, his home! Deaths and departures make London very\r\ndismal just now--every one is going about discomfited and with long\r\nfaces. People are terrified at the run of bad luck in which every day\r\nbrings forth some new catastrophe.\r\n\r\n_London, August 5, 1834._--It is certain that Dom Miguel has signed\r\nhis protest. The Duke of Alcudia and M. de Lavradio are with him; they\r\nare all preparing to join Don Carlos whenever he gains the slightest\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nLady Holland and Lady Cowper are doing all in their power to secure\r\nthat M. de Talleyrand and Lord Palmerston part on good terms. I can\r\nunderstand that the friends of the latter should desire this. It is\r\nimportant to them that there should not be occasion to blame Lord\r\nPalmerston's personal incivility for the total dispersion of the more\r\nimportant part of the _Corps diplomatique_, and that the evil\r\nreputation of the English Ministry all over Europe should not be\r\nemphasised by what M. de Talleyrand says of it at Paris. They will\r\nsucceed in securing an amicable parting without any overt rupture, but\r\nit is impossible that a ferment which has been going on so long should\r\nnot issue in ill-feeling, embarrassment and rancour. M. de Talleyrand\r\ncould never forget that he has been uncivilly treated by a man younger\r\nand less capable than himself. Lord Palmerston, not impertinent in\r\nform, would take every opportunity of being so in fact, and this would\r\nbe all the easier as the age and indolence of M. de Talleyrand would\r\nmake it every day more easy to lead him into some false step. Nothing,\r\ntherefore, would be more ill-advised than to come back, and in spite\r\nof all the pleasant and gratifying memories which attach me to\r\nEngland, I confess that I shall be relieved on M. de Talleyrand's\r\naccount when he is out of public life.\r\n\r\n_London, August 6, 1834._--It is confirmed that the Duke of Norfolk is\r\nto have the Garter.\r\n\r\nSpain is asking for additional articles in the Treaty of April 22\r\ncalled the \"Quadruple Alliance.\" She asks for British cruisers on the\r\ncoast of Biscaya, for a Portuguese army corps, for French money and\r\nmunitions of war and for troops on the French frontier. She asks all\r\nher allies for the moral support of a declaration in favour of the\r\nRegency, extending and explaining more fully the object of the first\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged uncertainty and ignorance regarding Rodil's movements\r\nare causing anxiety about his success, and to the resulting alarm is\r\nattributed the fall on the Stock Exchange at Paris. Ugly catastrophes\r\nhave occurred as the result of the particular misfortunes of the\r\nmoment. The Rothschilds who had flooded Europe with Spanish stock, and\r\nwho are still encumbered with a good deal themselves, are very cross\r\nand extremely anxious.\r\n\r\nSome clever people are saying that the Queen Regent's most serious\r\ndanger does not come from Don Carlos, but from what is called the\r\nparty of the \"movement.\" One is much disposed to accept this view when\r\none thinks of the horrible remark made by Romero Alpuende, who called\r\nthe massacres at Madrid on July 17 \"a slight measure of patriotic\r\nrelief.\"\r\n\r\n_London, August 8, 1834._--Rodil, it seems clear, has gained a very\r\ndistinct success all along the line of the Carlists. In a regular war\r\nthis might end the struggle, but in a civil conflict ordinary rules do\r\nnot apply, and a party which seems annihilated to-day comes to life\r\nagain to-morrow.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand took leave of the King the day before yesterday. The\r\nKing was very gracious to him and to me, regretting that in the\r\nabsence of the Queen his bachelor establishment prevented him from\r\nasking me to Windsor, where he would have been charmed to see me\r\nbefore I left. This is more courteous than correct, for the Princess\r\nAugusta is doing the honours of the Castle; ladies have been invited,\r\namong others Lady Grey and her daughter. But it is nicely put and in\r\nSociety that is all one has a right to ask.\r\n\r\nThe King talked much about the seriousness of the situation and\r\nobserved that the cards were well shuffled, on which M. de Talleyrand\r\nreplied, \"for our part, sir, we play with our cards on Your Majesty's\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\n_London, August 9, 1834._--I know nothing more embarrassing for a host\r\nthan obvious mutual hostility at close quarters among his guests.\r\nYesterday we thought we had escaped the Chancellor, but he came at\r\ndessert and prolonged our dinner, eating much at his ease in his usual\r\ndirty manner. As he ate he talked, helping himself to all subjects, as\r\nhe did to all the dishes, without stopping and without restraint. We\r\nsuffered agonies, especially on account of Lord and Lady Grey, and, in\r\nfact, he put us all out completely, and increased, if possible, the\r\ncontempt and loathing that I feel for him.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, who was dining with us, is also a little Radical,\r\nbut at least he has his father's good taste and good breeding.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of popularity and of the trouble which great people should\r\ntake for the less exalted classes of Society, Lord John told me\r\nyesterday that nothing could overcome the Duke of Bedford's hatred of\r\nthe lesser people with whom he is surrounded. One day his steward\r\nsuggested that some of them should be asked to dinner and the Duke\r\nrefused. The man of business said, \"But Your Grace, this civility will\r\nperhaps save you fifteen thousand pounds at next election.\" \"Perhaps,\"\r\nreplied the Duke, \"but if by spending money I can save myself boredom\r\nand annoyance I consider it well spent. I will pay the fifteen\r\nthousand pounds, but I will not give the dinner.\" Yet the Duke of\r\nBedford is very free handed, very charitable, and undertakes works on\r\na considerable scale solely in order to give employment to the poor.\r\nHowever, he is not popular, and the wounded vanity of the middle\r\nclasses has more weight than the gratitude of the indigent whose\r\nnecessities he has relieved.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Grey and their family, having, as they said, need of\r\nchange of scene and surroundings, wanted to come and pay us a visit in\r\nFrance. But the sort of triumphal progress which would have awaited\r\nLord Grey there struck terror into the present Ministry, who would\r\nhave shrunk from the comparison of the honour done to their victim and\r\nthe contempt under which they themselves languish. So Lord Grey was\r\npersuaded that if he went to France now it would look as if he went on\r\npurpose to secure an ovation, which would be an improper thing to do.\r\nThus we shall not have the pleasure of seeing him, which I regret on\r\nhis account, as I fear that in his present irritable and painful mood\r\nhe may suffer real harm from solitude and ennui, and his wife also,\r\nfor she is even more deeply wounded than he is himself. Lord Grey has\r\nworn himself out, morally and physically, with his labours. How much\r\nbetter it would have been if he had resigned six weeks sooner--at the\r\nsame time as the four really distinguished and honourable members of\r\nthe Cabinet? He would then have marched out with all the honours of\r\nwar instead of laying down his arms!\r\n\r\nEvery one is bitten with the taste for travel, and the Lord\r\nChancellor, like the rest, had planned a holiday to be spent in a\r\npicturesque and amorous pilgrimage on the banks of the Rhine in the\r\ntrain of Mrs. Peter. But it seems from what he told me yesterday\r\nhimself that the King would not allow him. Since Lord Clarendon's time\r\nno Chancellor of England has quitted the country, and the precedent is\r\nnot a happy one, for Lord Clarendon only went on his travels because\r\nhis master was in flight. Others say that the King has nothing to do\r\nwith the change in Lord Brougham's plans, but that the necessity of\r\npaying fourteen hundred pounds out of his salary to arrange for a\r\nCommission of the Seals in his absence is the real reason why he is\r\nnot going.\r\n\r\n_London, August 11, 1834._--Lord Palmerston has given us a farewell\r\ndinner. This is in his line; he loves to speed the parting guest. But\r\nhe did not take much trouble about it. Besides several diplomatists of\r\nthe second order there was no one there but Mrs. Peter--not a single\r\nperson of eminence in English Society, no one of those who are known\r\nto be our friends. It was done as a duty, or, perhaps as an\r\natonement--nothing more. Perhaps he hates the Lievens more than he\r\ndoes us, but he intends to advertise equally his contempt for both.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of the Flahauts, he put in an attempt at an explanation of\r\nhis never accepting a single one of our invitations. On this subject,\r\nhalf laughingly and half bitterly, I told him a few home-truths, which\r\nwent off very well. There were many hints and double meanings and sly\r\ndigs in our conversation, which reminded me of those that take place\r\nat the Opera ball, where the thought is all the freer for the\r\nappearance being veiled and dissimulated. I amused myself by\r\nfrightening the \"young man,\" as Madame de Lieven called him. He\r\nthought it necessary to pretend to be most desirous of our prompt\r\nreturn; I took him at his word, and said that I went further, and that\r\nin my opinion M. de Talleyrand should not go away at all. He then\r\nlooked very foolish and went off on the other tack, saying that a\r\nchange of air was necessary and, in fact, indispensable; that one\r\nrequired refreshment, both physical and mental--in short, all he\r\nwanted was to see the last of us.\r\n\r\nI looked at him closely yesterday. It is seldom that a man has a face\r\nso expressive of his character. The eyes are hard and pale, the nose\r\nturned up and impertinent. His smile is bitter, his laugh forced.\r\nThere is no dignity, or frankness, or correctness either in his\r\nfeatures or his build. His conversation is dry, but, I confess, not\r\nwanting in wit. He has on him a stamp of obstinacy, arrogance, and\r\ntreachery, which I believe to be an exact reflection of his real\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_London, August 12, 1834._--In spite of the slow progress made by Don\r\nCarlos it is difficult to be quite happy about the state of Spain.\r\nGeneral Alava, who has gone back there after many years of exile,\r\nseems struck with the demoralisation and confusion which he sees. All\r\nnatural bonds are broken by party spirit--the ferocity and violence of\r\nthese Southern fanatics, no longer directed against the foreigner,\r\nhave recoiled cruelly on themselves. Republicanism is gaining\r\neverywhere where religion is not on the side of the Legitimist party.\r\nIt appears with all the tawdry emotion of revolutionary eloquence in\r\nthe address of the Procuradores to the Queen-Regent. Already since the\r\nopening of the Cortès the Ministry is at variance with the Second\r\nChamber, and one cannot think how a Regency with such a feeble\r\nGovernment can possibly overcome so many adverse circumstances.\r\n\r\nI lately saw, at Lord Palmerston's, a portrait of little Queen\r\nIsabella II., sent by the Regent to his Lordship. To judge by this\r\npicture, she is not at all a pretty child. She seems to have\r\ninsignificant eyes and her father's wicked mouth; and, on the whole,\r\nis an ugly little Princess. It is a pity; women destined to sit on a\r\nthrone, especially a disputed one, find it a dangerous thing not to be\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe species of bankruptcy proclaimed by M. de Toreno, which has proved\r\nso fatal to a horde of small _rentiers_ at Paris, is making the little\r\nQueen's cause unpopular there. It seems to me that this is in a way\r\nfortunate; for if vanity and the _furia francese_ had rushed the\r\nGovernment into taking too prominent a part in promoting the success\r\nof their little neighbour, they would have found themselves drawn into\r\na series of embarrassments and into a network of dangers the effect of\r\nwhich would have been incalculable. King Louis-Philippe is shrewd and\r\nalert enough, where his own dynastic interests are concerned, not to\r\nremain coldly aloof from this struggle, which cannot but end to his\r\ndisadvantage, whether anarchy triumphs under Isabella II. or\r\nLegitimacy carries the day under Don Carlos. This being the case, it\r\nwould not be advisable to ruffle our other neighbours (for they are\r\nneighbours and not allies) by too definite acts of intervention.\r\nEngland alone is allied with us, but, undermined as she is by so many\r\ninternal wounds, can she still assert herself as she ought in the\r\ncouncils of Europe? Certainly not; and she must be well aware of the\r\nfact, for neither in the Eastern Question nor in any other question\r\nwhich has come up during the last two years has England made good in\r\naction the boasting of her language.\r\n\r\nThe cholera continues to ravage Madrid, attacking chiefly the upper\r\nclasses and particularly women. It has also appeared again, though\r\nslightly, in Paris and London.\r\n\r\n_London, August 13, 1834._--The Irish Tithes Bill has been rejected by\r\nthe House of Lords, as was expected, and by so large a majority that\r\nit would be difficult to create enough new Peers to redress the\r\nbalance. And yet how can one imagine next Session opening with the\r\nsame Upper House and the same Ministry? The Ministry say that they\r\nwill not give in, that they care nothing for the House of Lords, and\r\nwill get on with the Commons alone without caring at all about the\r\nClergy or the Peers, and without paying much attention to the Crown.\r\nIt is the Crown that should assert itself at this juncture; but, alas!\r\nthe Crown is in a most benighted condition.\r\n\r\nLord Grey told me he did not agree with the Chancellor that the only\r\nobstacles came from the House of Lords. He thinks that there will be\r\nvery serious trouble in the Commons, where Mr. Stanley, the\r\nex-Minister, is preparing a most violent attack on the Government.\r\nLord Grey has been staying away from the House of Lords; he feared he\r\nmight perhaps be forced to speak and that, not being able to hide his\r\ndistaste for the Cabinet's alliance with O'Connell, he might do an\r\ninjury to the Ministry for which he does not wish to be responsible.\r\n\r\n_London, August 14, 1834._--Grandees of Spain, it seems, are allowed\r\nto behave in a very free and easy way with their sovereigns. They\r\nsmoke cigars with them and often finish the cigar which the monarch\r\nhas left half consumed. The Duke of Frias, who was once Ambassador\r\nhere, is a curious, absurd, and absent-minded person who puts himself\r\nabout for nobody; he came back some time ago on a few days visit to\r\nLondon. He went to the King's levée, and pushing forward his funny\r\nlittle face said to His Majesty: \"You must know me.\" The King, who at\r\nfirst did not clearly remember him and was offended at the familiarity\r\nof his manner, said: \"No, I don't know you.\" \"I was Ambassador here,\"\r\nreplied the little Duke, \"when you were _only_ Duke of Clarence.\" On\r\nthis the King very nearly lost his temper, and, waving him on,\r\nrepeated emphatically: \"No, no, I don't know you.\" He then turned to\r\nthe Minister of the Netherlands who came next and said to him aloud:\r\n\"Who is that clown?\" This was a curious scene.\r\n\r\n_London, August 18, 1834._--For several days I have been oppressed by\r\nthe unwholesome atmosphere in which we live in London, profoundly\r\nagitated by the illness of my friends, and overwhelmed with all the\r\npreparations for my approaching departure. Thus my notes have been\r\nneglected. I should have liked to set down some of my last\r\nrecollections of London, which are blurred with illness, anxiety and\r\nregret, but which are none the less precious.\r\n\r\nI have seen the Duke of Wellington and Lord Grey, who came to say\r\ngood-bye, and expressed a friendship and esteem which I consider a\r\ngreat honour. Lord Grey I leave trying to quiet his conscience and to\r\ndeceive himself about the too rapid progress of his country's affairs,\r\nwhich he has placed in a train that his successors will accelerate.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington is not deceived about the seriousness of the\r\nsituation, but he has made up his mind to struggle to the last and\r\ndoesn't know the meaning of discouragement. It is not that he wishes\r\nto oppose all the proposals of the Ministry or to obstruct\r\nsystematically all administration and stop the machinery of\r\ngovernment. He is too honest a man for that. But he thinks it his duty\r\nand that of the Upper House to make themselves a bulwark for the\r\nprotection of the ancient and fundamental bases of the constitution.\r\nThe personality of the King spoils almost every chance of safety. His\r\nsuccessor is a child with perhaps almost more against her, the more so\r\nas her mother, the future Regent, seems to be very obstinate and very\r\nnarrow-minded.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to think with terror of the future of this great\r\ncountry, which was still so brilliant and so proud four years ago when\r\nI came to it, and whose glory is now so tarnished when I am leaving it\r\nperhaps for ever.\r\n\r\nI do not admit the possibility of M. de Talleyrand's coming back.\r\nThere are too many good reasons why he should not. I set them forth in\r\na letter which I have written to him and which describes his position\r\npretty correctly, so I insert it here.\r\n\r\n\"I have a serious duty towards you of which I am never more conscious\r\nthan when your glory is at stake. When I speak to you you sometimes\r\nfind me a little irritating, and then I am silent and do not tell you\r\nall that I think--the whole truth. Allow me therefore to write to you,\r\nand please forgive anything that may seem displeasing because of the\r\ndevotion which inspires what I write. Without claiming a very great\r\nshare of cleverness I don't think I am altogether at fault in forming\r\nan opinion about you whom I know so well, and whose difficulties and\r\nembarrassments I am in such a good position for observing. It is not\r\ntherefore lightly that I press you to abandon public life and to\r\nretire from the scene where a disordered society is playing a sorry\r\npart. Do not remain any longer at a post in which you will necessarily\r\nbe called upon to demolish the edifice which you have laboured so hard\r\nto sustain. You know what I feared last year, and how greatly, when\r\nyou made up your mind to return to England. I foresaw all the\r\nrepugnance which you would find in performing your task with the\r\ninstruments at your disposal. Confess that my forebodings have to a\r\ngreat extent been realised. This year there are a thousand additional\r\naggravating circumstances. Think of the circumstances in which you\r\nwould find yourself. What do we see in England? A society divided by\r\nparty spirit, and agitated by all the passions which arise from that\r\nspirit, losing every day something of its brilliancy, its breeding and\r\nits security, a King without firmness influenced chiefly by the very\r\nman of all his Cabinet who has most injured you, a frivolous,\r\npresumptuous, arrogant Minister, who pays you none of the respect due\r\nto your age and position. He obstructs and impedes business by every\r\nmeans in his power. His one thought is to secure the triumph of his\r\nown ideas; he has no thought of educating himself by studying yours.\r\nHe leads you on from uncertainty to uncertainty, entraps you with\r\ncontradictions, leaves you in ignorance and doubt, carries on\r\nindependently of you things in which you ought to have a share, and\r\nthen glories in the success of his treachery and scorn. Do you think\r\nyou can preserve much longer with such a man, the dignity which befits\r\nyou? Do you not feel that it is already compromised, in fact, and soon\r\nwill be in the public eye? Moreover, do you think that an Ambassador\r\nwho is a great personage, a man of your social gifts, can be\r\nacceptable to a Government which is being swept away by the current of\r\nRevolution, especially when you have already enough to do to struggle\r\nagainst a similar movement in your own country? You have founded an\r\nalliance on a common basis of good order, stable equilibrium, and\r\nconservation of existing institutions. Will it please you to continue\r\nit on the basis of common sympathy with anarchy?\r\n\r\n\"Do not forget that the support and consolation which you have found\r\nfor several years in your relations with your colleagues will no\r\nlonger be there, now that the face of the Diplomatic Corps in London\r\nhas changed so much. The new Spain, the new Portugal, the shapeless\r\nform of Belgium, are the only conspicuous features, as impudent as\r\nthey are vulgar. You would therefore be isolated in England and in the\r\ntrying situation which would be the result, where would you find\r\nsupport? Not in the Government you represent, for pettiness,\r\nindiscretion, vanity, and intrigue dominate everything in Paris. Only\r\nthe greatness of your position in London enabled you to hold them in\r\ncheck. Our little Ministers are more on Lord Granville's side than\r\nours, and you would not have their support in dominating things here.\r\nYou came here four years ago, not to make your fortune, your career or\r\nyour reputation. All these were made long ago; you came, not out of\r\naffection for those who are conducting our government, for whom you\r\nhave neither love nor affection. You came solely to render a great\r\nservice to your country at a moment of the gravest peril. It was a\r\nperilous enterprise at your age! It was a bold thing to reappear to\r\nstill the storm after fifteen years of retirement! You accomplished\r\nwhat you attempted; let that suffice you. Henceforth you can do\r\nnothing but diminish the importance of what you have done. Remember\r\nthe truth of Lord Grey's words: 'When one has kept one's health, and\r\none's faculties, one may still at an advanced age usefully occupy\r\none's self with public affairs. But, in critical times like the\r\npresent, a degree of attention, activity and energy is required which\r\nbelongs only to the prime of life and not to its decline.' When one is\r\nyoung, one moment is as good as another for joining in the fray; when\r\none is old the only thing to do is to choose a good time for leaving\r\nit. Here Lord Grey was the last, all too feeble barrier against the\r\nrevolutionary spirit; here you have been the last barrier against the\r\nstruggle of the powers with each other. Lord Grey realised too late\r\nthat he was being carried away by the torrent; do you not also feel\r\nthat your influence has become as inadequate as his? The noble and\r\ntouching farewell words of Lord Grey threw a last fleeting ray of\r\nlight on his career; his retirement became a triumph; another day and\r\nhe was effaced! The last two champions of the old Europe should quit\r\npublic life at the same time. May they carry with them into their\r\nretirement the consciousness of their efforts and their services, and\r\nmay history one day show that the coincidence of their departures was\r\nhonourable to both.\r\n\r\n\"This and only this I conceive to be the fitting close of your public\r\nlife. All considerations which might lead you to think otherwise are\r\nunworthy of you. You cannot be influenced by the possibility of a\r\nlittle more amusement, a few more social resources. Are you to count\r\nthe trifling excitements of dispatches, couriers, and news? The\r\ninterest produced by such things is too often a child's plaything. Are\r\nwe even to consider the more or less material tranquillity we enjoy?\r\nIs the epoch of shocks and revolutionary torments at an end in France?\r\nI do not know. Is it more or less distant in England? I cannot tell.\r\nWill solitude be trying? Shall we seek distraction in travel? What in\r\na word will be the arrangement of our private life? What does it\r\nmatter? I am younger than you, and might, perhaps, more naturally take\r\nsome thought for that; but I should think myself unworthy of your\r\nconfidence and of the truth which I am now venturing to tell you if\r\nthe slightest consideration of my own comfort made me keep anything\r\nfrom you. When one is a historical personage as you are, one has no\r\nright to think of any other future than the future of history.\r\nHistory, as you know, judges the end of a man's life more severely\r\nthan the beginning. If, as I am proud to believe, you think as highly\r\nof my judgment as of my affection, you will be as frank with yourself\r\nas I am with you now. You will have done with all self-created\r\nillusions, all specious arguments and subtle pieces of self-love, and\r\nyou will put an end to a situation which would soon lower you in other\r\neyes than mine. Do not bargain with the public. Dictate its judgment,\r\ndo not submit to it. Confess that you are old in order that people may\r\nnot say that you are aging. Say nobly and simply before all the world,\r\n'The time has come!'\"\r\n\r\nDom Miguel has left Genoa and has been seen at Savona. This is\r\nparticularly displeasing to Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n_London, August 19, 1834._--It appears that while Dom Miguel was at\r\nSavona several vessels were seen in the offing which hoisted English\r\ncolours and made many signals, following which Dom Miguel is said to\r\nhave returned to Genoa. This is what was being said yesterday, but no\r\nexplanation is forthcoming.\r\n\r\n_London, August 20, 1834._--M. de Talleyrand left London yesterday,\r\nprobably never to return. That, at least, is what he said himself.\r\n\r\nThere is always something solemn and peculiarly painful in doing a\r\nthing for the last time, in departure, in absence, in saying good-bye,\r\nespecially when one is eighty. I think he felt it, I know I feel it\r\nfor him. Besides, surrounded as I am with illness, and ill myself,\r\nthis being the anniversary of my mother's death, remembering all the\r\npleasant things that have happened to me in England, I feel very weak\r\nand discouraged by the thought of departure. I said good-bye to M. de\r\nTalleyrand with a heart-sinking as great as if I was not to see him\r\nagain in four days, and I might well have said to him as I said to\r\nMadame de Lieven, \"I mourn my departure in yours.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand's last impressions of his public life here were not\r\nprecisely agreeable. After many hours spent at the Foreign Office in\r\nthe company of M. de Miraflorès, of M. de Sarmento, and of Lord\r\nPalmerston, who, as usual, kept everybody waiting a long time, the\r\nadditional articles (which are of no great importance) of the Treaty\r\nof April 22, the Quadruple Alliance, were signed in the middle of the\r\nnight. Lord Palmerston wanted to extend the scope of the Treaty. M. de\r\nTalleyrand, on the other hand, desired rather to narrow its\r\nobligations. Lord Granville's absence from Paris had left the French\r\nGovernment free from this source of obsession, so they held their\r\nground and authorised M. de Talleyrand to maintain his position, and\r\nLord Palmerston gained nothing by his wilfulness, Lord Holland by his\r\ndraughtsmanship, or Miraflorès by his antics.\r\n\r\nThere are two stories which I have heard M. de Talleyrand tell so\r\noften that for me they have lost their freshness. They seemed very\r\ngood when first I heard them, so I will set them down here. They both\r\nhave to do with the campaigns of the Emperor Napoleon, which ended in\r\nthe Peace of Tilsit.\r\n\r\nAt Warsaw, where he remained during part of the winter of 1806-7, the\r\nEmperor received an ambassador[28] from Persia, who seems to have been\r\na man of wit. At any rate, M. de Talleyrand says that Napoleon asked\r\nthe Persian whether he was not surprised to find a Western Emperor so\r\nnear the East, and that the Ambassador replied, \"No, sir, for\r\nTah-masp-Kouli-Khan got even nearer.\" I have always had my doubts\r\nabout the authenticity of this retort, which, I believe, to have been\r\ninvented by M. de Talleyrand himself in one of his moments of\r\nirritation against the Emperor, an irritation to which he gave vent in\r\nmalicious sayings usually attributed to other people. Some, however,\r\nhe acknowledged as his own, and, indeed, I have heard them said for\r\nthe first time; such, for instance, as his remark in 1812, \"It is the\r\nbeginning of the end\" (_C'est le commencement de la fin_), which has\r\nbeen so often quoted since, which has received such numerous\r\napplications, and has become public property and almost a commonplace.\r\nThe unfortunate campaign of 1812 inspired more than one of M. de\r\nTalleyrand's most mordant sayings. I remember one day M. de Dalberg\r\ncame to my mother's, and said that all the _matériel_ of the army was\r\nlost. \"Not at all,\" said M. de Talleyrand, \"for the Duc de Bassano has\r\njust arrived.\" The Duc de Bassano was at that particular time, and for\r\na very good reason, the object of M. de Talleyrand's displeasure. The\r\nEmperor desired to recall M. de Talleyrand to office, and it had been\r\nagreed that he should follow His Majesty to Warsaw. This was to remain\r\na secret until the day of his departure. The Emperor, however, told\r\nthe Duc de Bassano who, being disturbed at the revival of a favour\r\nwhich might disturb his own position, told his wife. She took it upon\r\nherself to put an end to the affair, and used, for this purpose, a M.\r\nde Rambuteau, a talkative, pompous, and smooth-spoken person,\r\npretentious and pliant at the same time, who fancied himself in love\r\nwith the Duchess, and did her husband's dirty work. M. de Rambuteau,\r\nthen, having been thoroughly coached by the Duchesse de Bassano, went\r\nabout everywhere spreading the news of the journey to Warsaw, saying\r\nthat M. de Talleyrand was boasting about it and telling every one. The\r\nEmperor was offended, and M. de Talleyrand remained in France\r\npreparing reprisals.\r\n\r\n  [28] Myrza-Rhyza-Kan, Envoy Extraordinary of Seth-Ali, Shah of\r\n  Persia, to Napoleon I, at Warsaw, in March 1807.\r\n\r\nBut to come to the second story which M. de Talleyrand so often\r\ntells--he says that the Persian Ambassador, who made such subtly witty\r\nreplies to the Emperor Napoleon, was a very tall, handsome man,\r\nwhereas another Oriental, the Turkish Ambassador,[29] was a little\r\nman, short, squat, common and ridiculous. At a great ball, given by\r\nCount Potocki, the two Ambassadors were ascending the staircase\r\ntogether, and the little Turk darted forward in order to enter the\r\nball-room before his colleague. The latter, seeing himself passed,\r\nstretched out his arm so as to make a kind of yoke, under which he\r\ncalmly allowed the Mussulman to pass.\r\n\r\n  [29] Eminin-Effendi, accredited by the Sultan Mustapha IV. to the\r\n  Emperor Napoleon at Warsaw in March 1807.\r\n\r\n_London, August 22, 1834._--The English Ministers wished to insert in\r\nthe King's Speech on the prorogation of Parliament a phrase very\r\noffensive to the Upper House, in revenge for the rejection of the\r\nDissenters Bill and The Protestant Clergy in Ireland Tithes Bill. But\r\nthe King opposed this with sufficient firmness to secure the\r\nabandonment of the phrase, after a very sharp struggle which rather\r\ndelayed the hour of the sitting.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has returned from her journey and has been received with\r\nceremonious cordiality by the City of London, the chief magistrates of\r\nwhich went out to meet her. Her health is better. I think with\r\npleasure of all the consolations which Providence in its equity\r\nreserves for her.\r\n\r\nM. de Bülow announces that he has applied for leave of absence on\r\nfamily affairs and that he is sure to obtain it. He says he wants to\r\ngo to the Hague to face the storm there, and having dispersed it at\r\nthe Hague, to face more boldly that which he foresees at Berlin. I\r\nbelieve he will in fact go to the Hague, but much more for the purpose\r\nof rehabilitating himself by a few platitudes than of fighting his\r\nquarrel to a finish. He does not wish to reach Berlin until he has\r\nreceived absolution at the Hague; that at least is my opinion.\r\n\r\n_London, August 23, 1834._--Here I end my London Journal with the\r\nregret that I did not begin it sooner. It would perhaps have possessed\r\ngreater interest if I had. But four years ago when I arrived in this\r\ncity I had neither pleasant memories of the past nor much interest in\r\nthe present, nor much thought for the future. I then asked no more of\r\neach day as it succeeded its predecessor than a little distraction,\r\nand I paid little attention to the features which marked out each from\r\nthe other....\r\n\r\n_Dover, August 24, 1834._--I was quite astonished to find myself\r\nexpected here and all along the road. The Duke of Wellington who goes\r\nthis way to Walmer Castle, his residence as Lord Warden of the Cinque\r\nPorts, had announced my arrival. A single family named Wright, who are\r\nvery excellent people, keep almost all the inns on the road.\r\n\r\nLast year after a storm I was received here by a very pretty Mrs.\r\nWright, who kept the Ship Hotel. She had the manner of a Queen and it\r\nwas only to-day that I learned that she had been one--on the stage,\r\nand that her husband had been ruined by her extravagance. The hotel is\r\nnow kept by people called Warburton, who do it in great style. I was\r\nagain struck by the respectful politeness with which one is received\r\nin English inns when one changes horses, and with the pleasant\r\nlanguage and good manners of the humblest people. On the way I heard\r\nof the Duke of Wellington, of the death of Mrs. Arbuthnot, of the\r\npassage of M. de Talleyrand, of the desire to see us back in England,\r\nand all this in the most charming way possible.\r\n\r\nI am to sail in a French packet--the weather is good and the sea calm.\r\nFarewell to England, but not to the memory of the four happy years\r\nwhich I have spent there, and which have passed with a rapidity to be\r\nexplained by the interest of the events which have happened, and the\r\nparticular sources of pleasure and contentment which I have found\r\nthere! Farewell once more to this hospitable country which I leave\r\nwith regrets and gratitude!\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 27, 1834._--I arrived here yesterday evening at ten\r\no'clock to find M. de Talleyrand awaiting me. The general impression I\r\ngot of him was that he was rather depressed and bored; yet he said he\r\nwas very much pleased with the Tuileries where he seems to be much in\r\nfashion. He also says that he is so popular in Paris that the\r\npassers-by stop before his carriage and lift their hats to him; but in\r\nspite of all this he repeats that he knows no one here, that he is\r\nbored and that every one is aged and worn out.\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 28, 1834._--I was at Saint-Cloud yesterday. The King\r\ndid me the honour to speak to me a great deal, perhaps too much, for I\r\nhad to say something on my side, and at Court my one desire is to be\r\nsilent. This conversation, however, was very interesting, for the\r\nKing, who is witty on all subjects and intelligent about everything,\r\ntalked about many things--the state of England at present, the\r\nbreak-up of which is so disquieting for her neighbours, Lord Grey's\r\nretirement which is greatly deplored here, Don Carlos's departure from\r\nEngland and the part great or small which the Duke of Wellington\r\nplayed in bringing it about. Here he is supposed to have arranged it\r\nall, a belief which I vigorously combated as I believed myself in duty\r\nbound to do. Then we talked of intervention in Spain, then of the\r\nSalic Law and in fact of everything that is occupying people just now.\r\nThe King talked very well. He insisted much on the fact that he alone\r\nhad opposed the immediate intervention demanded by his Ministers, and\r\nclosing his large hand he showed me his fist and said, \"Do you\r\nunderstand Madame? I had to hold back by the mane steeds which have\r\nneither mouth nor bridle!\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the Salic law he said, \"I am 'Salic law' to my finger tips;\r\nthe Dukes of Orleans always have been, you will believe me when I say\r\nso. But when I struggled for the law they thought that I should have\r\nless chance if it were destroyed, so every one lent a hand in its\r\ndestruction instead of helping me to maintain it. I was left alone to\r\nfight French ignorance and vanity and all the other difficulties of\r\nthe situation, and now I am reproached with having abandoned my own\r\ncause in that of Don Carlos. I have no enmity against him, no love for\r\nIsabella, but people would have what has come to pass. The two years\r\nbefore I came to the Throne saw the preparation of the deplorable\r\nstate of things which now prevails in the Peninsula. However, whether\r\nAnarchy triumphs under Isabella, or the Inquisition under Don Carlos,\r\nI may be troubled by them being my neighbours, but I cannot be shaken.\r\nWe have made enormous internal progress, though I admit that much\r\nremains to be done, and with what instruments!\"\r\n\r\nThe King then entered into many details relating to the troubles of\r\nhis office and ended by saying, \"Madame you must know that I have to\r\nbe the Director in everything and the Master in nothing.\"\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of the state of England, and of the complications which\r\nwill arise there owing to the age and sex of the heir to the throne,\r\nHis Majesty said, \"What a deplorable thing it is to see all these\r\nlittle girl Kings in a time like the present!\" He went on to a\r\ndissertation full of real eloquence on the disadvantages of female\r\nrule, then suddenly stopped with a polite phrase and a sort of apology\r\nwhich was quite unnecessary. So I said that I thought that what M. de\r\nTalleyrand said of wits was true of women, \"they were useful for\r\nanything but sufficient for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe King then talked for a long time about the restorations at\r\nVersailles and Fontainebleau. He has had Louis XIV.'s room at\r\nVersailles refurnished exactly as it was, that is with hangings\r\nembroidered by the Demoiselles de Saint-Cyr. One panel represents the\r\nSacrifice of Abraham, a second that of Iphigenia, a third the loves of\r\nArmida. The King has had replaced in this room a portrait of Madame de\r\nMaintenon giving a lesson to Mlle. de Nantes. Versailles will be a\r\ntrue Museum of the history of France. I am grateful to the King for\r\nhis respect for tradition; our historic monuments will owe him a great\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nWhat a sad letter Alava writes from Milan! He paints a most melancholy\r\npicture of Spain, and can foresee only a series of circumstances, each\r\nof which will be more fatal than the other. He tells me that the\r\nignorance and presumption there are beyond belief, and that the\r\nhalf-knowledge of things which comes from France and England is\r\nperhaps doing more harm than absolute ignorance. The state of\r\nbankruptcy there is flagrant; the cholera is more horrible than\r\nelsewhere, and is made worse by the stupidity of the people who at the\r\nfunerals of cholera victims are seen eating tomatoes and cucumbers\r\nraw! At Segovia, on the other hand, the sanitary junta ordered that in\r\neach house visited by the epidemic all the effects of the deceased\r\nshould be burned and all the survivors shut up in the hospital,\r\nincluding the priest present during the last moments of the departed!\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 29, 1834._--How excited and busy every one is at Paris!\r\nHow their minds work! How completely tranquillity and calm are unknown\r\nhere! Yet there is progress and amelioration everywhere, but without\r\nregularity or measure. There are so many small intrigues, small\r\npassions and small cabals to exhaust people that no one can enjoy what\r\nis good or rest his soul in the prospect of a quiet future. This\r\nfeverish way of living consumes people, and I find the members of the\r\nFrench Cabinet appallingly aged. They are little old men with the\r\nsaddest air in the world.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers has passed through a series of disillusions and\r\nembarrassments which have made him wish for retirement; he feels\r\nhumiliated and discouraged. The King has supported him, cheered him up\r\nand protected him, and has not been sorry to make this protection\r\nfelt. He even said, \"It is no bad thing that _Messieurs les gens\r\nd'esprit_ should see from time to time that they have need of the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Orléans spent an hour with me. He is anxious to be married\r\nand is determined to be so. He is weary both of dissipation and of the\r\nyouthful frivolities which are injuring and belittling him. He is\r\nalso disgusted with the real inactivity of his public life. He desires\r\na home, a house of his own. He wishes to take root, to form a circle,\r\nto settle down, in short, to get older. All these views are very\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a wife is the more difficult, as there are more\r\nprejudices than ever to overcome. The Russian Grand-duchess would be\r\nthe most brilliant marriage, but would they have him? Then there are\r\nsome sentimental regrets for Poland here which would make such a\r\nmarriage unpopular in France and perhaps impossible in Russia. An\r\nAustrian Arch-duchess would not be very easy to get, and besides,\r\nalliances in that quarter always seem to be unlucky. The King of\r\nPrussia's niece, to whom Louis-Philippe inclines, seems to be\r\ninsignificant in appearance and delicate in health. She has been\r\nbrought up in habits of parsimony, and the possible subjects of\r\nquarrel which might arise between two Powers between whom the Rhine is\r\nin dispute, make the Duke somewhat averse from the Prussian Princess.\r\nFrom reports which are current it appears that the young Prince is\r\nmore in favour of the second daughter of the King of Würtemberg, who\r\nis tall, well made, pretty, witty and vivacious. She takes it from her\r\nmother, the Grand-duchess Catherine of Russia, one of the most\r\ndistinguished women of her time, and, when she wished to be so, very\r\ncharming. She was, however, an ambitious, restless and intriguing\r\nperson, and I hope that her daughter does not resemble her in\r\neverything. M. le Duc d'Orléans asked for M. de Talleyrand's advice\r\nand mine on the subject; we asked for time to reflect.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has invited himself to Valençay for the beginning of\r\nOctober to talk all this over at our ease. He has sense and a good\r\njudgment, and is not without ambition. There are excellent features in\r\nhis character, but both his qualities and his defects make a\r\ndistinguished wife essential.\r\n\r\nThey say that Marshal Gérard is not pleased with his post as Minister\r\nof War. It appears that he only took it on a promise of a portfolio\r\nfor his brother-in-law M. de Celles--a foolish and impracticable idea.\r\nHowever, they promised in order to persuade the Marshal to accept,\r\nand then were not ashamed to break their word.\r\n\r\nAs to the marriage of the Prince Royal, I see that the question of\r\nreligion is indifferent to him and of secondary importance to the\r\nKing. The Queen alone would stand out for a preliminary conversion,\r\nbut no rupture of negotiations would occur on this point.\r\n\r\nThe exaggerated ideas of the King of Naples on the subject of the\r\nPrincess Marie's dowry have suspended all idea of a marriage in that\r\nquarter. There is general regret in the Royal Family except on the\r\npart of the Princess herself, who dreams of continuing here her aunt's\r\nexistence, which she thinks charming.\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 30, 1834._--From what M. Thiers tells me, it seems that\r\nthe King, on Marshal Soult's retirement, thought of summoning M. de\r\nTalleyrand to the Presidency of the Council. This idea is even now\r\nagain in his mind when he thinks of Marshal Gérard's probable\r\nretirement. But M. de Talleyrand would not accept on any account and\r\nbesides, as Thiers said to the King, \"Madame de Dino does not wish\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAt dinner yesterday at Saint-Cloud the King spoke to me with much\r\nacrimony of the Duc de Broglie who, he said, had wished to keep him\r\nout of everything. He complained bitterly of the Duke's conduct. He\r\ncomplains of a good many people, but is arranging with Rigny and\r\ncounting on M. Thiers.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand is very much the fashion indeed at the Palace because\r\nhe is saying everywhere that the King should have a free hand. I am\r\nalso the fashion because I am a good listener, and because I say, as I\r\nthink, that the King is the cleverest man in France. The King speaks\r\non all subjects very well, a great deal, and at great length. He\r\nlistens to himself, and, at least, is conscious of his ability. He\r\nloves the memory of the Regent, of whom Saint-Cloud naturally reminds\r\nhim. He told me that Louis XVIII. also loved his memory and appeared\r\nmuch shocked at the calumnies of which he had been the object. \"I,\" he\r\nsaid, \"am his best justification.\" But when Louis XVIII. said all\r\nthis he ended curiously, for, having insisted on the outrageous\r\ncharacter of these calumnies, he added, \"Nevertheless, the verses of\r\nLagrange-Chancel are so good that I have them by heart and like to say\r\nthem over.\"[30] This was a curious conclusion to come to in a\r\nconversation with the present King.\r\n\r\n  [30] Lagrange-Chancel was concerned in the conspiracy of\r\n  Cellamare, and launched against Philippe d'Orléans three virulent\r\n  pamphlets in verse, which were soon followed by two others.\r\n  (_Philippiques_, 1720.)\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 1, 1834._--This morning I saw M. de Rigny, who told\r\nme that the news from Spain was most embarrassing. Martinez de la Rosa\r\nis beginning to say that without the armed intervention of France all\r\nwill go to the devil. The King is very strongly against intervention,\r\nmuch more so than his Ministers, who seem to me to be much agitated by\r\nthis terrible neighbour.\r\n\r\nHatred of Lord Palmerston is so general here that no one troubles to\r\nconceal it. M. de Rigny is deafened by it on all sides. _A propos_ of\r\nthis he told me that as Palmerston's exhibitions of arrogance and his\r\nhostile demonstrations were never, in fact, followed by any action,\r\nthey had ceased to make any impression, and that people only said,\r\n\"Ah, that's only one of Palmerston's little outbursts!\" and then\r\nthought no more of it.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot has succeeded to Rigny's place in this house; he is much\r\npleased with the internal condition of the country, but he justly says\r\nthat, if in addition to our domestic difficulties we had to interfere\r\nin a revolution in Spain, and were to be at the same time confronted\r\nwith one in England we should indeed be undone. It seems certain that\r\nthe new Chamber of Deputies is infinitely better than the last, and\r\nthat it is recruited from a higher class. Material progress has also\r\nsensibly advanced. France left to herself without external\r\nembarrassments is evidently in a very good way indeed.\r\n\r\nPrince Czartoriski, very languid as usual, also came in; he intends to\r\nestablish himself definitely at Paris.\r\n\r\nAt last I have been able to go out and call on the Werthers, where I\r\nheard more complaints of Palmerston. When I came back M. de Talleyrand\r\nset me to arranging papers, and I turned up a curious letter, signed\r\nFerdinand, Carlos, Antonio, which was written from Valençay by these\r\nthree Princes to express their gratitude and affection.\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 2, 1834._--I have had a visit from M. Thiers, who\r\ntold me what follows. All reports from Spain agree that Don Carlos\r\nwill have just as many men as he can get muskets, and that he is only\r\nwaiting for a consignment of arms to march on Madrid, where everything\r\nis going wrong. Dom Miguel in his turn is preparing to reappear in the\r\nPeninsula. If, therefore, the blockade is not effective enough to\r\nprevent the importation of arms the Queen's cause is desperate, unless\r\nFrance intervenes actively in Spanish affairs. The question may arise\r\nin an acute form at any moment and opinion is much divided. Bertin de\r\nVeaux and some others are in favour of armed intervention if it should\r\nbecome necessary to save the Queen, because, they say, if Don Carlos\r\ntriumphs Carlism will become everywhere audacious, and France will\r\nhave an implacable enemy on her frontiers. With so immediate a danger\r\nbehind her here, every movement would be paralysed in a war, which\r\nwould be all the more likely to be forced on her, and her chances of\r\nsuccess the less. To this the King and M. de Talleyrand reply: \"But if\r\nyou intervene you will have war all the sooner! And, moreover, who is\r\ngoing to help you? Is England, undermined by her internal troubles,\r\nlikely to be of any assistance?\" To that the answer is: \"Her\r\nneutrality is enough.\" \"But can you count on her neutrality. Does it\r\nnot depend on the duration and composition of the present Cabinet,\r\nwhose existence is extremely doubtful?\" M. de Rigny is much distracted\r\nby these conflicting opinions and is terribly embarrassed. Every one\r\nis racking their brains for an expedient.\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte,[31] September 7, 1834._--The weather, which had been\r\nwretched for two whole days, improved yesterday, and a veritable sun\r\nof Austerlitz pierced the clouds to welcome my arrival at\r\nLangeais.[32] All the town surrounded the carriage, and all along the\r\nroad, till I reached this place. I received many greetings and saw\r\nmany smiling faces which much pleased me.\r\n\r\n  [31] Rochecotte is a château built at the end of the eighteenth\r\n  century which the Duchesse de Dino bought in 1825, and afterwards\r\n  improved and greatly extended. In 1847 she presented it to her\r\n  daughter the Marquise de Castellane. Rochecotte is charmingly\r\n  situated on the slope of the Loire Valley, commanding the village\r\n  of Saint Patrice, in the Department of Indre et Loire.\r\n\r\n  [32] Langeais is a large town rather more than two leagues from\r\n  Rochecotte. It is situate on the right bank of the Loire, and is\r\n  dominated by a castle built in 992, and reconstructed in the\r\n  thirteenth century by Pierre de la Brosse. In 1491 the marriage\r\n  of King Charles VIII. and Anne de Bretagne was solemnised there.\r\n\r\nThe valley is very green, the Loire is full; the careful cultivation\r\nand the resulting richness are admirable; the hemp, which is one of\r\nthe local industries, is as high as the vegetation of the Tropics, and\r\nin fact I am delighted with all I see.\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, September 8, 1834._--My life here is neither political\r\nnor social, and can be of no general interest. I will, however,\r\ncontinue to note the little incidents which strike me.\r\n\r\nYesterday, after luncheon, while I was resting my poor head in a\r\n_chaise longue_ in the salon, the Abbé Girolet sat beside me in a\r\nlarge arm-chair and told me he had a favour to ask. This was that I\r\nshould undertake to be his sole executor. He has little of value to\r\nleave, and the charges on the succession will absorb at least the\r\nwhole of it, but there was no one but me whom he could trust to look\r\nafter his servants and his pensioners, and if I would do so he could\r\ndie happy. I said he should do as he liked, and asked him to leave\r\neverything to me as he wished, but to spare me details then which\r\nwould be painful to me, and which in any case I should learn only too\r\nsoon. He took my hand and thanked me warmly for what he calls my\r\nkindness to him, and then after this momentary effort relapsed into\r\nthe silent, almost somnolent condition from which he rarely emerges.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 11, 1834._--I arrived here yesterday evening,\r\nhaving stopped for a little on the way at Bretonneau's charming\r\ncountry house near Tours, and having admired the delightful road from\r\nTours to Blois, which is so full of memories for me. It was dark,\r\nexcept for the moon, when I reached the post station of Selles, where\r\nI was expected. At the first crack of the postillion's whip every\r\nwindow was lit up with candles by the inhabitants, the effect of which\r\nwas quite like an illumination. While they were changing horses the\r\npopulation surrounded the carriage with cries of welcome. Even the\r\nSister Superior of the hospital, an old friend of mine, came to the\r\ndoor of the carriage to speak to me though it was nine o'clock. I was\r\nquite deafened and overwhelmed, but at the same time much touched. It\r\nwas more than four years since I had passed that way, and I was far\r\nfrom expecting that they would remember the few services I rendered\r\nthem in old times.\r\n\r\nAt last, at ten o'clock, under a magnificent moon, I reached my\r\ndestination in the splendid courts of Valençay. M. de Talleyrand,\r\nPauline, Mlle. Henriette,[33] Demion, and all the servants were under\r\nthe arcades with many lights. It made a pretty picture.\r\n\r\n  [33] Mlle. Henriette Larcher, governess to Mlle. Pauline de\r\n  Périgord.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 12, 1834._--Here is the principal passage in a\r\nletter from Madame Adélaïde to M. de Talleyrand: \"You will no doubt\r\nremember the discussion which took place in my room on the absurdity,\r\nthe danger, and the uselessness of declaring war on Don Carlos. It\r\nseems, nevertheless, that some people wish to raise the question\r\nagain. You treated the question in my presence in a manner so lucid\r\nand convincing that one would hardly have thought that it would have\r\ncome up again. However, I think it right to warn you that there is a\r\ndanger of it, and you would do well to make clear in England the\r\ndanger of taking this false step, which can only end in evil. It seems\r\nthat England is embarrassed by a promise to furnish Spain with naval\r\nassistance, and that this absurd proposition is being entertained as a\r\nway out of that promise. I think, therefore, that it would be well if\r\nyou at once wrote to England on the subject. I attach great importance\r\nto this, for no one can do it so well or so effectively as you.\"\r\n\r\nHere now is M. de Talleyrand's answer.[34] \"I implore the King to\r\npersist in his refusal to declare war against Don Carlos, for I think\r\nthat this would be the most deplorable way of smoothing the\r\nembarrassment of the English Ministers. I am not surprised that they\r\nare embarrassed; I have been expecting that they would be so for a\r\nvery long time. I have never been able to understand the levity with\r\nwhich during the last two years they have been throwing themselves\r\ninto all the difficulties which have arisen in the Peninsula. In 1830\r\nLondon was the appointed place, the only suitable scene for\r\nnegotiations on a great scale. Now England gets nearer to disorder as\r\nFrance recedes further from it, and the negotiations should be brought\r\nback to Paris and conducted under the eagle eye of the King. England\r\nwill not dare to venture alone, and the other Powers will range\r\nthemselves on our side in disapproving a declaration of war. Thus we\r\nshall risk nothing in refusing to declare war. It will be a good thing\r\nto gain time, and Lord Granville's absence from Paris gives us a\r\npretext for avoiding a peremptory answer. If I hesitate to obey the\r\nsuggestion that I should write to England on the subject, it is that I\r\nhave reason to believe that any letter would produce an effect\r\ncontrary to that which I should desire. The English Cabinet has lately\r\nfound me reserved and cold, and careful to avoid entangling my\r\nGovernment in any of the troublesome complications of the Peninsula. I\r\ncannot doubt that they distrusted me in all these transactions, and\r\nwere offended at my lack of enthusiasm. Now that the English Ministers\r\nare embarrassed by promises which I allowed them to make without\r\nallowing France to participate, they are not likely to receive with\r\ngoodwill either my advice or my warning.\"\r\n\r\n  [34] This letter has already been published in the little book by\r\n  the Countess de Mirabeau entitled, _Le Prince de Talleyrand et la\r\n  Maison d'Orléans_, which appeared in 1890.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes most kindly from St. Petersburg; she will soon\r\nbe left alone with her pupil, with whom she is much pleased. The\r\nEmperor goes to Moscow, the Empress to Berlin, and then the Lievens\r\nenter on their duties and go into their own house, about which she\r\nseems to me, very naturally, to be rather in a hurry. I think her\r\nteeth are on edge already, though she is consoled by her august hosts.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 16, 1834._--Labouchère, who arrived here\r\nyesterday, says nothing can be compared to M. de Toreno's conduct but\r\nthat of the Rothschilds.[35] The former, before declaring the\r\nbankruptcy of the Spanish Government, sold out huge quantities of\r\nstock, speculating in the opposite sense from the Jews, and, as he was\r\nin the secret, he not only consolidated his personal position, which\r\nwas very insecure, but made enormous profits, while almost every place\r\nin Europe has been very badly hit.\r\n\r\n  [35] See the London _Chronicle_ for August 6, 1834.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 25, 1834._--Here is an extract from a letter\r\nwritten by M. de Rigny to M. de Talleyrand: \"Calm is restored at\r\nConstantinople, but Mehemet Ali is furious at the obstinacy of the\r\nPorte and talks of independence; we are going to try to soothe this\r\nfeverish attack. Toreno, from being the adversary of the French\r\ncreditors, has constituted himself almost their champion; we shall\r\nknow to-morrow or the day after what resolution has been adopted by\r\nthe Cortès. Meanwhile, however, things are going no better in Spain,\r\nand at Madrid they are beginning to talk loudly of the necessity for\r\nour intervention. They wished to replace Rodil by Mina, but they are\r\nbeing treated with great coolness at St. Petersburg for not being\r\npresent at the inauguration of the column.\r\n\r\n\"I saw yesterday a letter from Lord Holland, who is congratulating\r\nhimself on the stability of the English Ministry; I don't know what\r\nthat is worth.\r\n\r\n\"Semonville has sent in his resignation in writing. He would have\r\nwished Bassano to be his successor; the place has actually been given\r\nto Decazes, which perhaps you won't think any better. Molé refuses to\r\nbe Vice-President, being wounded at Broglie being put before him. That\r\nis his whole reason. Is it _reasonable_? Villemain refuses to be\r\nPerpetual Secretary. That would be, he says, to abandon his political\r\nfuture! On the other hand, Viennet would be quite ready to abandon his\r\nfor the permanency.\r\n\r\n\"We have just had two or three bad elections. As for the amnesty, the\r\ndecision is negative. I fear they will regret having taken this course\r\nwhen we are in the middle of a cross-fire of law-suits, lawyers,\r\nplatform oratory, and newspaper articles. It is necessary in this\r\ncountry to look a few months ahead!\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Lady Jersey informs me that Palmerston has refused to be\r\nGovernor-General of India, and that the Duchesse de Berry is about to\r\nhave a child--legitimate this time.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 28, 1834._--When we got back yesterday from our\r\nwalk we found the house full of visitors, male and female, who had\r\ndriven here, and were inspecting everything with interest. The steward\r\ntold us that it was Madame Dudevant, with M. Alfred de Musset and a\r\nparty. At the name of Dudevant the Entraigues made several\r\nexclamations which I did not understand till they explained that\r\nMadame Dudevant is no other than the author of _Indiana_, _Valentine_,\r\n_Leone Leoni_--in fact, George Sand! She lives in the Berri when she\r\nis not running about the world, as she often does. She has a château\r\nnear La Châtre, where her husband lives all the year round, and\r\noccupies himself with agriculture. He it is who looks after the two\r\nchildren he has by the woman of genius. She herself is the daughter of\r\na natural daughter of Marshal de Saxe; she often appears in men's\r\nclothes, but was not so attired yesterday. When I entered my\r\napartments I found the whole party parleying with Joseph[36] for\r\npermission to see them, which is not usually allowed when I am here.\r\nOn this occasion I wanted to be civil to neighbours, so I myself threw\r\nopen the doors, showed them everything, and explained things, and\r\nfinally escorted them as far as the large drawing-room, where the\r\nheroine of the occasion, seeing my portrait by Prud'hon, thought\r\nherself obliged to pay me many compliments. She is small, dark, and\r\ninsignificant in appearance, between thirty and forty. Her eyes are\r\ngood, and her hair is dressed in a pretentious way, such as is\r\ndescribed as \"classical\" on the stage. Her tone is dry and abrupt; her\r\njudgments on artistic matters are very positive. The bust of Napoleon\r\nand Canova's Paris, as well as Thorwaldsen's bust of Alexander and a\r\ncopy from Raphael by Annibale Carraci (which the good lady took for an\r\noriginal) gave her many opportunities. Her language is very fine. On\r\nthe whole, she is not elegant; the rest of the party were quite\r\ncommon, in appearance I mean, for not one of them opened his lips.\r\n\r\n  [36] The Porter at Valençay.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I had another visit after my own heart from a sister of\r\nthe order of nuns at Valençay, who was a novice here. Though she is\r\nonly thirty-three she is already the first assistant at the mother\r\nhouse, whence she comes to inspect here. She looks upon Valençay as\r\nher cradle. She came here at the time when I founded the small\r\ninstitution here, and was then remarkably fresh and beautiful. Now she\r\nis thin and pale, but still very sweet and gentle in appearance. In\r\nspite of her sanctity, which has advanced her so rapidly in the Order,\r\nshe is very fond of me, and kissed me just as if I was worthy of it,\r\nexpressing much joy at seeing me again, poor sinner that I am.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 7, 1834._--Yesterday I had a long conversation with\r\nM. de Talleyrand about his plans of retirement, which led me to speak\r\nto him frankly on several important features of his position. I had\r\nthe courage to tell him the truth, as is always right when dealing\r\nwith people of his great age.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 9, 1834._--M. de Montrond, who has been here some\r\ndays, asked to see me yesterday about an important matter. I saw him,\r\nand after some pleasantries which I received rather coldly, he said\r\nthat he had come to announce his departure, at which I should not\r\nprobably be surprised, considering the extraordinary way in which M.\r\nde Talleyrand was treating him. He spoke for a long time and\r\ncomplained bitterly. He is deeply hurt, and that makes him say many\r\nnasty things. He added that he knew quite well that I didn't like him,\r\nbut that I had always been kind and civil to him, and wished to thank\r\nme for it, and to say that, though he had no doubt I should not agree\r\nwith him, I should be bored to death, and the life I was leading\r\nwould certainly become insupportable, though it would be difficult for\r\nany one to live it more gracefully. In short, he took pains, for what\r\nreason I know not, to stand well with me.\r\n\r\nI confess that I was very ill at ease during his remarks, which,\r\nthough broken and abrupt in his usual style, lasted for some time.\r\nHere is a summary of my answer, or rather of my answers. I regretted\r\nall that might suggest a quarrel, for that would do no good to any one\r\nand would damage him (M. de Montrond) most. Society would side against\r\nhim, as his rudeness to M. de Talleyrand would explain the latter's\r\nwant of patience. To complain and explain his grievances by the\r\nexistence of motives such as he had suggested to me would be in very\r\nbad taste, and there were some things which should not be said even\r\nwhen they seemed to be true, especially after forty years of a\r\nfriendship which on M. de Talleyrand's part might be described as\r\npatronage. As far as I was concerned, I could not be dull in the midst\r\nof my duties and family interests; besides, my life, my habits, my\r\nwhole existence had for long been bound up with M. de Talleyrand's\r\ninterests. This was my destiny, with which I was well satisfied and\r\ndesired no other.\r\n\r\nOn this he resumed: \"It is clear that you are destined to bury him.\r\nThen you are very clever and have a great gift for speech and action.\r\nYou are also enough of a great lady to know how to take things in a\r\ncertain way. As for me, the only thing to do is to go.\"\r\n\r\nI took him up then. \"You have something more to do, and that is to go\r\naway civilly without a scene, and not to tell any one that you did so\r\nbecause you were angry. You have, above all, to avoid speaking, I do\r\nnot say ill, but even lightly, of M. de Talleyrand.\" He said, \"You\r\nmake very pretty speeches this morning, but if I do as you wish, what\r\nwill you do for me?\"--\"I will keep the true cause of your departure\r\nsecret.\"--\"You are too clever, Madame de Dino.\"--\"I know what I am\r\nsaying.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked me if I would shake hands with him and promise to be good\r\nnatured about him. \"Yes, if you do not speak amiss of M. de\r\nTalleyrand.\" \"Very well. I shall not go straight to Paris. I shall go\r\nto d'Argenson at Ormes to get over this, and when I have got back my\r\n'lamb-like temper,' I shall speak to the King and invent some business\r\nto excuse my not waiting for his son here.\" \"Do what you like so long\r\nas you behave like a gentleman.\" He is gone. At luncheon he said that\r\nhe had got a letter which obliged him to leave to-day.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that I had been expecting something of the kind. M. de\r\nTalleyrand, after many years of too long suffering patience, has\r\nsuddenly gone uncompromisingly to the other extreme, and the day\r\nbefore yesterday so clearly indicated to M. de Montrond that he was\r\nnot wanted here, that the latter could not overlook it. It is possible\r\nthat M. de Montrond will impose some restraint on his tongue, just\r\nsufficient that is to avoid an accusation of bad faith, but it seems\r\nto me impossible that he will not take some underhand way of revenging\r\nhimself, for he is hurt and upset. To have to go on the eve of the\r\narrival of a large and distinguished party of English people to whom\r\nhe was preparing to do the honours of Valençay, not to be here when M.\r\nle Duc d'Orléans is expected--these are two real disappointments for\r\nwhich he will not forgive M. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\nIn the first and most virulent part of his conversation with me he\r\nfrequently referred to the King and to M. de Flahaut in such a way as\r\nto persuade me that he means to take the latter's part absolutely, in\r\norder that he may be able to injure M. de Talleyrand with His Majesty.\r\nWhat can one expect of a being like him? But also how childish to lose\r\none's temper after forty years![37] M. de Montrond said to me, \"He\r\nshould treat me with the kindness and intimacy of an old friend, or\r\nelse with the politeness of a host.\" To this I replied, \"But would not\r\nM. de Talleyrand also be justified in saying to you that you give him\r\nneither the deference due to one's host, nor the attentions due to\r\nhis age and to your former relations? In what other house would you\r\nhave dared to run down everything as you do here? You have criticised\r\nhis neighbours, his servants, his wine, his horses, in fact\r\neverything. If he has been rude you have given him provocation, and,\r\nindeed, there are too many witnesses of your habit of perpetual\r\ncontradiction to make it possible for you to complain of the anger it\r\nhas aroused.\"\r\n\r\n  [37] In 1793 Montrond had fled to England, and there had placed\r\n  himself under M. de Talleyrand's protection. This was the\r\n  beginning of their long friendship.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 14, 1834._--We have staying here Lady Clanricarde,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Dawson Damer, and Mr. Henry Greville. I went for a long\r\ndrive yesterday with Lady Clanricarde, and talked to her a great deal\r\nabout her father, the celebrated Mr. Canning, and of her mother, who\r\nwas not less distinguished, but who did not appear to be much beloved\r\nby her daughter. Lady Clanricarde is clever; her manners are\r\nrestrained, dignified, and in good taste; but, judging from what I\r\nsaw, I consider her rather hard-hearted and intellectually stiff. Both\r\nher manners, however, and her character have, in my opinion, a real\r\nvalue. She never lets herself go and has no personal magnetism, but\r\nwhen all is said and done, she is a figure of real distinction and of\r\nthe best and most exquisite breeding. Mrs. Damer is a good\r\nsoul--nothing more.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 18, 1834._--Speaking to Lady Clanricarde of Lord\r\nPalmerston and Lady Cowper, we fell to wondering what it is that\r\nenables some people to retain so much influence over some others, and\r\nI made an observation on the subject against which she protested, to\r\nthe effect that, \"it is by what they demand that men preserve their\r\ninfluence over women, while it is by what they concede that women\r\npreserve their influence over men.\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 21, 1834._--Yesterday the news came of the dreadful\r\nfire at Westminster. It is a terrible catastrophe and one which is\r\ndistinctly ominous, as it suggests that the political edifice is\r\ncrumbling along with the material one, and that the old walls refused\r\nany longer to be dishonoured by the profane doctrines of to-day. There\r\nis something in this which may well impress not only the imagination\r\nof the multitude, but the mind of every thinking person.\r\n\r\nThe English party here all believe that the fire was the work of an\r\nincendiary, because it began in the House of Lords. The _Globe_, which\r\nwas sent to M. de Talleyrand, kept us all up very late, for we were\r\nanxious to know all the versions of the disaster. It appears that the\r\nloss in papers and documents of all kinds is enormous, and is due not\r\nonly to the fire, but to their being scattered and blown away. What a\r\npity! It is said that it will cause much confusion, and many gaps in\r\nthe proceedings of the Courts.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I took Lady Clanricarde and Mrs. Damer to see the little\r\nconvent, the school and all the small institution conducted by the\r\nValençay sisters. This is the sort of thing which makes very little\r\nimpression on English women. For all their cleverness and goodness,\r\nthey are not charitable in the true sense of the word, and they have a\r\nsingular unwillingness to come in contact with poverty, misery,\r\nmisfortune, illness or suffering. This distant manner of theirs with\r\nlesser people, so useful in society, freezes and irritates me when I\r\nsee it applied even to the poor. Thus Lady Clanricarde, so agreeable\r\nin society, found nothing to say to my poor sisters who are so simple\r\nand devoted. She hardly put her nose inside the door of the school,\r\nand gathered up her fine skirts, that they might not be rumpled by the\r\nlittle girls who were going to their places. The two ladies were\r\nmuch astonished that I found so much to say, and above all, when\r\nthey saw me stopped several times in the village by people who\r\nwanted to consult me about their business. This way of living is\r\nincomprehensible to an Englishwoman, and at that moment, Lady\r\nClanricarde, clever as she is, and well disposed to me, was surprised,\r\nI am sure, to think that I knew how to eat properly at table, and was\r\nwearing a dress made by Mlle. Palmyre!\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 23, 1834._--All yesterday it rained in torrents,\r\nand it was impossible to go out. Our English friends made music\r\nbarbarously enough all morning; and in the evening three letters came.\r\nOne was from Lord Sidney to Henry Greville, saying that M. de\r\nMontrond had got back to Paris, and was telling everybody that\r\nValençay had become quite uninhabitable, that Greville and the Damers\r\nwere being bored to death, and that only Lady Clanricarde could put up\r\nwith it. H. Greville read this in a low voice. Lady Clanricarde\r\ncontinued aloud, M. de Talleyrand asked what it was, and the whole\r\npassage was read to him.\r\n\r\nThe second letter was from M. de Montrond to Mr. Damer, and inquired\r\nhow he was getting on at Valençay. The writer observed that he was not\r\nanxious about H. Greville who loved tittle-tattle, and would get what\r\nhe wanted there. Mr. Damer read this also aloud.\r\n\r\nThe third letter was from M. de Montrond to myself, and was as cool as\r\npossible in tone. I passed it to M. de Talleyrand who, annoyed at what\r\nhe had just heard, read it too aloud. It reminded me of Célimène's\r\nletter! I don't know what reflections this little scene may have\r\nprovoked, for I went to bed immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 26, 1834._--The weather improved a little\r\nyesterday; just now it is very cold but dry, with brilliant sunshine.\r\nLet us hope that it will last for the arrival of M. le Duc d'Orléans\r\nwho is expected to-night! The populations of fourteen Communes are in\r\nmotion and people are coming from Châteauroux and even from Issoudun\r\nwhich is ten or twelve leagues from here. The fact that it is Sunday\r\nmakes it easier for them to gratify their curiosity and whatever the\r\npapers say there will be nothing else in the way of magnificence or\r\nfestal preparations than a crowd. I believe that M. le Duc d'Orléans\r\nwill be very well received by the country folk. Never since the days\r\nof la Grande Mademoiselle has any Prince of any dynasty come here. The\r\nwhole country between Blois and Châteauroux, so well treated by the\r\nValois, has been, as it were, disgraced and forgotten; none of the\r\nsucceeding Governments would do anything for this corner of Berri.\r\nWhen I first came here everything in the way of civilisation was as it\r\nhad been in the time of Louis XIII. M. de Talleyrand has done\r\nsomething to secure a little progress, and I too have done a little,\r\nbut it is only this year that we have been able to organise a system\r\nof post horses. So far there is not even a diligence, and for many\r\npeople, even in easy circumstances, the only means of conveyance is\r\n_pataches_, that is, carriages without springs. In such a remote part\r\na Prince is still somebody. Our communes are flattered that one is\r\nabout to wander into our solitudes, and they will cry out \"_Vive le\r\nRoi!_\" with all their might, which is the best thing that they can do.\r\n\r\nAmong those who arrived last night were the Baron de Montmorency and\r\nMadame la Comtesse Camille de Sainte-Aldegonde. The Baron de\r\nMontmorency was long ago on the point of being the Lauzun of the\r\nMademoiselle of his day,[38] and though he declined the honour of the\r\nalliance he has remained very intimate with Neuilly. Madame de\r\nSainte-Aldegonde lives in a very pretty house between here and Blois;\r\nshe is one of the Queen's ladies and a great friend of the Baron de\r\nMontmorency. Her first husband was General Augereau. She is my own age\r\nand we came out at the same time. We were both ladies-in-waiting to\r\nthe Empress Marie Louise, but we did not see much of each other, for\r\nshe followed her husband to the front and never came to Court. On the\r\nfall of the Empire we lost sight of each other completely. Madame de\r\nSainte-Aldegonde has been extremely beautiful, and if her expression\r\nwere more agreeable she would be so still, but she never had a kindly\r\nair owing to her eyebrows which are very dark and turn up too much;\r\nand, as she has lost the softness of her first youth, there remains a\r\ncertain crudity which is not attractive. Her voice is rather\r\nhigh-pitched, and, though polite and well-bred enough, she lacks that\r\nease and smooth courtesy which can only be acquired at the time when\r\none first learns the elegances of life. When one does not learn them\r\nin one's cradle one may be presentable, but one can never be\r\ndistinguished, yet after all, considering everything, she will pass\r\nmuster.\r\n\r\n  [38] Madame Adélaïde had caused her hand to be offered to the\r\n  Baron de Montmorency, but on condition that she should not be\r\n  required to change her name--a condition which the Baron declined\r\n  to accept.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 27, 1834._--M. le Duc d'Orléans came yesterday, in\r\nvery bad weather, an hour sooner than he was expected, which much\r\nupset both us and the sightseers. However, our little _Garde\r\nNationale_ was there to receive him. The Municipality were also\r\nassembled and a certain number of people were there to greet him as he\r\npassed. There were no speeches, for which I think he was thankful.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Orléans began by having some conversation in the salon\r\nwith M. de Talleyrand, M. and Madame de Valençay and myself. He\r\nannounced, much to my surprise, that Madame de Rigny, Thiers and\r\nGuizot were coming. My surprise was not lessened when Monseigneur told\r\nme that the King was strongly urging his Ministers to come here\r\nbecause it was a good excuse to suspend the Councils for a few days.\r\nThese had become almost impossible owing to the outbursts of Marshal\r\nGérard, and a crisis was inevitable. It was desired, however, to\r\npostpone it for a time, and, with this in view, not to call the\r\nCabinet together. Marshal Gérard was in a minority of one, all the\r\nMinisters being united against him.\r\n\r\nWhen Monseigneur retired to his apartments I went to dress and went\r\ndown at once in order to be first in the salon. I found there General\r\nPetit commanding the 5th Division, General Saint-Paul commanding the\r\nDepartment of the Indre, and General Baudrand of the Prince's suite\r\nwith his secretary M. de Boismilon.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner there was a slight fit of solemnity, which I soon\r\ndissipated by taking up my work as usual. The Prince thanked me\r\ncordially for doing so. Then every one grouped and arranged themselves\r\nnaturally. A little later M. de Talleyrand took his usual evening\r\nwalk, and when he came back he found Lady Clanricarde, the Prince,\r\nHenry Greville and me playing whist gaily together. Music was playing\r\nin the vestibule, and in a word the ice was broken.\r\n\r\nAfter tea the Prince vanished, and at eleven everybody went to bed.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 28, 1834._--Here is an account of yesterday. After\r\nbreakfast M. le Duc d'Orléans went over the Château and its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, my son and I acting as his guides. All our guests who\r\nhad not already seen what there is to see followed.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back three carriages, a phaeton, and six saddle-horses\r\nwere in attendance. Each member of the company took his place. M. le\r\nduc d'Orléans, the Marchioness of Clanricarde, the Baron de\r\nMontmorency and I were in the first carriage. M. de Talleyrand, Madame\r\nde Sainte-Aldegonde, General Baudrand, and M. Jules d'Entraigues were\r\nin the second, and so on. After crossing the park and an isolated\r\npiece of the forest, we stopped at a pretty pavilion, from which there\r\nis a fine view. The military band was concealed behind the trees,\r\nwhich still have much of their foliage. There was a considerable\r\ncrowd, and the whole made a very pretty forest scene. We then plunged\r\ninto the forest itself, and did not return till it was time to dress\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we took the Prince to a ball at the Orangerie. The\r\ncourts, the keep, and the railings were illuminated, and the effect\r\nwas very fine. The ball-room was very finely decorated, and so full of\r\npeople that one could scarcely move. There was, however, no vulgar\r\npushfulness, and if the cries of greeting were ear-splitting, they\r\nwere such as always please a Prince. He walked all through the room,\r\ngreeted every one, and talked a little. They were, in short, much\r\npleased with him; so pleased, indeed, that, though he only stayed an\r\nhour, they were still shouting under his windows at two o'clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 29, 1834._--Yesterday before luncheon our Royal\r\nguest, with his aide-de-camp, my son, and the Baron de Montmorency,\r\nwent to visit the spinning mill and the quarries from which came the\r\nstone of which the Château is built. He thought the quarries superb.\r\nAfter luncheon we took him to the ironworks. There was a cheering\r\ncrowd; the men did their work well, both casting and forging. Inside\r\nthe fine building they produced and repeated an effect of fireworks\r\nwith the flaming molten metal which was very fine and much amused our\r\nEnglish ladies. On the way back we made a slight detour to see the\r\nruins of Veuil.[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] Veuil commands the valley of Nahon, and was joined to the\r\n  Seigneurie of Valençay in 1787 by M. de Luçay, who was then the\r\n  owner. The castle, which must have been very fine, is now a ruin,\r\n  of which only a fragment is inhabited by a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe band was hidden in one of the old towers. A great fire had been\r\nlighted in the only room which remains intact, and in which we were\r\nserved with refreshments. In the courtyard and through the half-ruined\r\narchways were seen national guards and peasants, who cheered and threw\r\ntheir hats up into the air. This little excursion was very pleasant in\r\nspite of the dull weather. The sun, or rather the moon, would have\r\nmade it perfect.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, besides our guests of last night, we had the Prefects of\r\nIndre-et-Loire and of Loir-et-Cher, General Ornano, and Colonel\r\nGarraube, a Deputy, to whom we owe the band that has given so much\r\npleasure. After dinner there was whist, a few turns of a waltz, &c.\r\n\r\nLater on there was a real ball and supper for the servants, and in\r\nhonour of the servants of the Prince Royal; it was really very pretty.\r\n\r\nYesterday at dinner I was a little surprised at something my Royal\r\nneighbour said to me. He asked me when we were going to\r\nRochecotte.--\"I don't know, Monseigneur.\"--\"But you can't spend the\r\nwinter here where it is so cold.\"--\"Oh no, we never intended to do\r\nthat.\"--\"Are you coming to Paris?\"--\"I really don't know.\"--\"For, of\r\ncourse, England is out of the question since Lord Palmerston won't go\r\nto India.\" I looked straight at the Prince with some surprise, and\r\nsaid: \"I believe that Lord Palmerston's departure would certainly have\r\nrecalled the Ambassadors to London, and that if he stays that will\r\nkeep them away; but M. de Talleyrand's plans are very uncertain, and,\r\nmoreover, depend on the King's wishes.\"--\"Your uncle told me that he\r\nthinks we have got out of England all that we can, and that great\r\naffairs are no longer to be transacted in London, but in Paris, under\r\nmy father's eye.\"--\"Yes, that is M. de Talleyrand's idea, because the\r\nKing's honesty and ability have inspired confidence in Europe in\r\ninverse ratio to the distrust which the policy carried on in England\r\nfor the last months has aroused.\"--\"My father very much wants M. de\r\nTalleyrand to return to England, but before talking to your uncle\r\nabout it I told the King that I thought it was impossible.\"--\"It\r\ncertainly would be difficult, Monseigneur.\"--\"But you, Madame, what\r\nare your wishes?\"--\"Whatever will be agreeable to the King,\r\nMonseigneur; and if M. de Talleyrand does not go back to London it\r\nwill be because he is persuaded that, things being as they are, he\r\nwould be of no use. Personally, I am extremely fond of England; a\r\nthousand ties of gratitude and admiration bind me to that country,\r\nespecially the Queen's kindness, and the friendship of Lord Grey and\r\nthe Duke of Wellington. But there are some friends whom one does not\r\nlose simply because one leaves them, and I hope in course of time to\r\ngo and thank my English friends for all their kindness to me during\r\nthe last four years.\"[40]--\"But, to leave the question of the Embassy,\r\nwhat will M. de Talleyrand do?\"--\"Whatever the King wishes. If the\r\nKing wishes to see him, he will go and pay his respects; if his\r\nMajesty will allow him to rest, he will remain in retirement, taking\r\ncare of his legs, which, as you see, are very weak and very painful.\r\nIn a word, Monseigneur, he will always be the King's most devoted\r\nservant.\" And at this point this somewhat curious conversation came to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\n  [40] The Duchesse de Dino never revisited England in spite of her\r\n  happy memories of that country.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 30, 1834._--Yesterday morning all our neighbours\r\nfrom Tours, Blois, and the neighbourhood left rather early, as did M.\r\nMotteux, who left a charming English dog as a present for M. de\r\nTalleyrand. The excellent man left us with much regret, having greatly\r\nenjoyed his visit, most of which he spent in the kitchen, in the press\r\nhouse, or at market. He said very little, but was neither indiscreet\r\nnor in the way, nor spiteful with his tongue.\r\n\r\nBefore luncheon M. le Duc d'Orléans visited the two hosiery\r\nestablishments,[41] made purchases, and gave orders. After luncheon he\r\nasked to be shown our schools and the establishment of the Sisters,\r\nand gave a large sum for the poor. He seemed much struck by the\r\nexcellent management of the little convent, and particularly with the\r\nmanners of the Superior. On this occasion he told me that one of his\r\nancestors lent money to the Holy See and was not repaid at the\r\nappointed time. The Pope, however, by way of compensation sent a Bull\r\ncreating all the male posterity of his family sub-deacons from their\r\nbirth and canons of Saint-Martin of Tours, with the right to touch the\r\nsacred vessels without gloves, and to sit on the Gospel side of the\r\nchurch instead of the Epistle side. King Louis-Philippe was installed\r\nCanon of Tours at the age of seven.\r\n\r\n  [41] When you entered this shop, then very celebrated in France,\r\n  you used to see models of the legs of all M. de Talleyrand's lady\r\n  friends, duly labelled, which had been made for the guidance of\r\n  the Valençay tradesman.\r\n\r\nLater on, we took the Prince to the ponds in the forest, by the side\r\nof which there was a great camp-fire.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner the Prince again desired some private conversation with\r\nM. de Talleyrand and then with me. Afterwards we played pool on the\r\nbilliard-table. The scene was very animated, the ladies being of the\r\nparty. Tea taken, the letters came, and announced the resignation of\r\nMarshal Gérard; and M. le Duc d'Orléans, retired, put on his\r\ntravelling dress, and at half-past eleven, after saying many gracious\r\nthings, he departed.\r\n\r\nAlthough everything went off very well during his visit, and though\r\nthe Prince was really perfectly charming to everybody, I am\r\nnevertheless much relieved now that he is gone. I feared every moment\r\nthat some accident would happen, and for this reason opposed every\r\nidea of a shooting party; I feared disloyal cries, bad weather, a\r\nthousand things; and, besides, I was worn out with fatigue.\r\n\r\nAs I foresaw, the visit of M. le Duc d'Orléans has thrown some light\r\non our future, for M. de Talleyrand said to him that there was no more\r\nfor him to do in London. He pointed out Lord Palmerston's personal\r\ncharacter, the line taken by the English Cabinet, the absence of all\r\nthe _haut corps diplomatique_ from London, and the evident tendency of\r\nall the Courts to cease acting in that capital and to choose another\r\ncentre of high politics. Besides all this, the weariness of his legs\r\nmade it impossible for him to return to England unless a reaction\r\noccurred which made him--M. de Talleyrand--a more suitable person than\r\nany other to conduct the affairs of France there. For the moment he\r\nthought that any one would do just as well, if not better, than he. M.\r\nle Duc d'Orléans said positively that he had been charged by the King\r\nto discover the intentions of M. de Talleyrand, and at the same time\r\nto express the King's desire to talk with him if he did not mean to\r\nreturn to London. His Majesty was most anxious that M. de Talleyrand\r\nshould not abandon his interest and participation in the work at which\r\nhe had laboured so much.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Orléans told me a curious thing--that eighteen months ago\r\nLucien Bonaparte had written him a rather abject letter, begging him\r\nto obtain for him the post of French Minister at Florence!\r\n\r\nI have just heard that the King has positively refused to call the Duc\r\nde Broglie to the Presidency of the Council in place of Marshal\r\nGérard. It is clear that it was this Ministerial crisis which\r\nprevented the arrival of the three Ministers who were to have come\r\nhere. I am quite glad it did, for this took away all political\r\nsignificance from the Prince's visit.\r\n\r\nHe spoke much of Rochecotte and of his desire to visit it again next\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 31, 1834._--M. le Comte de la Redorte is staying\r\nhere. He is a man of undoubted erudition. He has studied a great deal,\r\nand travelled much. He remembers everything, but, unfortunately,\r\ninstead of waiting till you knock at his door, as an Englishman would\r\ndo, he throws it wide open and forces you to come in. Though his face\r\nis fine and his manners charming, and the sound of his voice\r\ndelightful, he is simply a bore. He fills his conversation with facts,\r\ndates, and figures; he enters into the most minute details; he plunges\r\nhead first into the heaviest economic topics, and wearies,\r\nextinguishes, and crushes his audience. His opinions, moreover, are\r\ncut and dried on every subject; his judgments are absolute; his\r\nexpositions are all arranged beforehand. It is deadly dull! Our\r\nEnglish party groaned under him! He left after luncheon, and as\r\nhe was going M. de Talleyrand said: \"There is a mind which stopped\r\nbefore it arrived.\" He said a rather sharp thing about Madame de\r\nSainte-Aldegonde, who also left this morning. Speaking of her very\r\ndark eyebrows, which surmount rather expressionless eyes: \"These,\" he\r\nsaid, \"are bows without arrows.\"\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from a letter from Paris, dated the 29th, which\r\ncame yesterday: \"The post-horses were waiting in M. de Rigny's\r\ncourtyard on Sunday the 26th, and he was just about to leave with\r\nBertin de Veaux, when the King sent for him and commanded him to put\r\noff his departure for a day. He never got another opportunity of\r\ngetting away. Yesterday, at four, Marshal Gérard forced the King to\r\naccept his resignation. M. de Rigny has determined not to accept the\r\nPremiership which they wish to offer him. He thinks he has neither the\r\ntalent nor the consistency necessary for the post. He cannot disguise\r\nfrom himself that the only reason for offering him the place is the\r\ndifficulty of getting any one else; and if his refusal costs him his\r\nplace he will console himself with the reflection that it is better to\r\ngo out of office in this way than to go later on less honourably. And\r\nyet what will be the end of all this? What appears most probable is\r\nthe addition of M. Molé to the Ministry. M. Thiers would much like to\r\nbe Premier, but he does not yet dare to be openly a candidate. M. Molé\r\nwould not remain long. His means, his character, his surroundings,\r\nwill all combine to promote his speedy fall. This would be enough to\r\nenable M. Thiers to realise his ambition--at least he thinks so. He\r\nwould, however, have been better pleased to see M. de Rigny undertake\r\nthe part intended for M. Molé, but that even his eloquence could not\r\nachieve!\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 1, 1834._--I hear from Paris that an article in\r\nterms very insulting to M. de Talleyrand and myself has just appeared\r\nin a periodical review. For many years I have been afflicted with\r\ninsults, libels, and gutter calumnies of all kinds, and I shall be so\r\npersecuted till the end of my days. Living as I have done in the house\r\nof M. de Talleyrand, and in his confidence, how could I escape the\r\nlicence of the press and its attacks in the most libellous age of\r\njournalism? It was long before I got used to it. I used to be deeply\r\nwounded, very much upset, and very unhappy, and I shall never become\r\nquite indifferent. A woman never could be, and would, in my opinion,\r\nbe the worse for becoming so. However, as it would be equally absurd\r\nto allow one's peace of mind to be at the mercy of people one\r\ndespises, I have made up my mind to read nothing of this kind, and the\r\nmore directly concerned I am the less I desire to know about it. I do\r\nnot wish to know the evil people think or say or write about me, or\r\nabout my friends. If they do wrong, or if I myself am not all I should\r\nbe, I am quite aware of the fact, and want to forget it. As for\r\ncalumny, it disgusts and enrages me, and I see no reason why I should\r\nacknowledge the dirt thrown at those nearest and dearest to me.\r\n\r\nThere are so many pains and mortifications in this life, and so many\r\nare inevitable, that my only thought is how to avoid as many as\r\npossible, for I am sure that enough remains to test my courage and\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nAnother of my motives for not investigating these malevolent incidents\r\nis that I find it too hard to forgive them, for if gratitude is one of\r\nthe most prominent characteristics of the good part of my nature, I am\r\nalways afraid that I have a compensating amount of rancour. I have\r\nnever forgotten a service or a friendly word, but I have perhaps too\r\noften remembered an insult or an unkind remark. Thank heaven, my\r\nrancour does not go the length of revenge, but I suffer for it all the\r\nsame. I know nothing so miserable in the world as bearing malice, and,\r\nsilent and inoffensive as I remain externally, the feeling rankles\r\nwithin and I am quite upset by it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have had only too many occasions to scrutinise,\r\nanalyse, and dissect my moral self. Who is there who has not a chronic\r\nmoral malady, like a chronic physical one? And who is there who,\r\nhaving passed a certain age, is not or ought not to be well aware of\r\nthe rules he should follow, for the good of his soul, no less than his\r\nbody?\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 4, 1834._--I have just returned from an\r\nexpedition which we made to Blois and its neighbourhood with our\r\nEnglish friends, who were going back to Paris. The day before\r\nyesterday, we visited Chambord which seemed, as it in fact is,\r\nbizarre, original, full of interest and rich in detail. It is situated\r\nin an ugly country, and is in a deplorable state. The window of the\r\noratory of Diane de Poitiers, on which Francis I. wrote his\r\nimpertinent couplet about women,[42] is still there, but the panes are\r\nbroken. The verses were not creditable to a chivalrous monarch.\r\n\r\n  [42]\r\n\r\n    Souvent femme varie\r\n    Bien fol est qui s'y fie.\r\n\r\nThe place where the _Bourgeois gentilhomme_ was first acted before\r\nLouis XIV. also exists, as well as the table on which the body of\r\nMarshal Saxe, who died at Chambord, was opened and embalmed. It is in\r\nfact the only piece of furniture left in the Château.\r\n\r\nWe got back to Blois rather late, and yesterday morning we visited the\r\ncastle, which is now a barracks, and certainly one of the most\r\ninteresting monuments of France. The four sides are in four separate\r\nstyles of architecture. The oldest part dates from the time of Stephen\r\nof Blois, King of England of the Plantagenet stock. The second oldest\r\ndates from Louis XII. and bears his emblem, the hedgehog, with the\r\nmotto: _Qui s'y frotte s'y pique_. Then comes the part built by\r\nFrancis I. with its Renaissance elegance. It was here that the Duc de\r\nGuise was murdered, that Catherine de Medicis died, and here too is\r\nthe hall where the celebrated States General of Blois assembled. You\r\nare shown the fireplace where the body of the Duc de Guise was\r\nconsumed, and the dungeon where the Cardinal and the Archbishop of\r\nLyons were imprisoned, the little niche where Henri III. placed the\r\nmonks whom he ordered to pray for the success of the assassination,\r\nand the room where the widow of John Sobieski died. Lastly, the fourth\r\nside was built by Gaston d'Orléans in the style of the Tuileries, and\r\nwas never finished. Near the castle is an old pavilion in which were\r\nthe baths of Catherine de Medicis, and not far off is a shed which\r\nserved as a retreat for the favourites of Henri III.\r\n\r\nOn returning here from this excursion, I heard the sad news of the\r\ndeath of Princess Tyszkiewicz, which took place the day before\r\nyesterday at Tours. I had to break the news to M. de Talleyrand. At\r\nhis age such losses afflict the mind more than the heart, for they\r\nseem rather a personal warning than a sorrow. He was more startled\r\nthan I; I was more affected than he, for I had a real affection for\r\nthe Princess, and I was very grateful to her for all that she was to\r\nme long ago. Though she had survived herself, I cannot think without\r\npain of the part of the past which is buried with her, for when one\r\nloses friends one loses not only them but a part of one's self.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand agreed with me that we could not allow this poor but\r\nillustrious lady, the niece of the last King of Poland, and only\r\nsister to the unfortunate Marshal Prince Poniatowski, to be laid to\r\nrest among strangers. She will be buried at Valençay.\r\n\r\nA letter from Paris which came last night says, \"nothing is settled\r\nabout the Ministry. The thing grows ridiculous, and the intrigues show\r\nno signs of stopping. The day before yesterday it was thought that\r\neverything was settled, and that Thiers was going off to Valençay, but\r\nyesterday all was changed and things are as they were. There has never\r\nbeen such a dissolving force as Thiers; his oratorical gifts are\r\ncosting us dear, but some conclusion must be reached. M. de Rigny is\r\nquite ready to retire, M. Guizot is still supporting Broglie for the\r\nPresidency of the Council, and Thiers is backing Molé.\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 6, 1834._--The other day M. Royer-Collard told me\r\nsomething that is very amusing because it is so characteristic of him.\r\nHe said that the second Madame Guizot was reproaching him vigorously\r\nwith having repudiated all religion, and with having refused to be its\r\npatron and protector. She said that by complaining, as he did, that he\r\nwas claimed by the religious party, he caused much embarrassment to\r\nits members. She therefore begged him to cease attacking them and\r\nturning them to ridicule on every occasion, as he was in the habit of\r\ndoing. \"Ah, Madame!\" he replied, \"you wish then that I should leave\r\nthe public in error, and thus deprive myself of my only consolation,\r\nand my only chance of revenge.\" She was furious. The one thing which\r\nannoys M. Royer-Collard, (and it annoys him very much) is Guizot and\r\nall his works. This annoyance is perhaps not altogether unfounded. He\r\nhas no love for M. de Broglie whose lofty virtue did not seem to him\r\nadequate to the circumstances which recently arose, and as for Madame\r\nde Broglie he likes her even less, because her piety does not preserve\r\nher from any of the agitations of public life, and is even compatible\r\nwith political intrigue. The contrast involved in this is displeasing\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n_Valençay November 7, 1834._--Here is an anecdote which is quite\r\nauthentic, having been told me by an eye witness, and which struck me\r\nvery much. M. Casimir-Périer, as is well known, died of cholera.\r\nBesides this he was completely out of his mind during the last ten\r\ndays of his life; a tendency to insanity had already revealed itself\r\nin several members of his family. Well, several hours before his death\r\ntwo of his colleagues in the Ministry, with two of his brothers, were\r\ntalking in a corner of the room of the embarrassment which the arrival\r\nof Madame la Duchesse de Berry was causing in la Vendée, of the\r\nresulting difficulties for the Government, of what ought to be done,\r\nand of the responsibility involved in doing it, and of the fear and\r\nreluctance every one had in assuming this responsibility. This\r\nconversation was suddenly interrupted by the sick man who sat up in\r\nbed and exclaimed: \"Oh if only the President of the Council were not\r\nmad!\" Then he fell back on the pillow and was silent. He died shortly\r\nafterwards. Is not this striking, and does it not make one shudder as\r\none does at _King Lear_?\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 9, 1834._--I went to Châteauvieux yesterday to see\r\nM. Royer-Collard. He had received letters from several of the\r\nMinisters who have resigned. From these he understands that no sooner\r\nwere the five resignations sent in than they were politely accepted.\r\nThe King sent for M. Molé, and entrusted him with the Presidency of\r\nthe Council, and the task of recomposing the whole Cabinet. M. Molé\r\nasked for twenty-four hours to consider matters, and to see whom he\r\ncould persuade to act with him. However, as everybody declined to\r\nshare the task, he was himself compelled to withdraw, and so the whole\r\nsituation has again become vague, and perhaps impossible.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the papers have again broken out against M. de Talleyrand.\r\nSome say he is dead, some that he is ill in mind and body, others\r\ninsult him grossly and foully. M. Royer-Collard explains this new\r\naccess of savagery to the fear that the Presidency of the Council will\r\nbe offered to M. de Talleyrand and accepted by him. It seems that many\r\npeople, struck by the absence of good men, wish the King to look to\r\nus, and that the terror which this inspires in certain others envenoms\r\nall that they do, or say, or write. It is a melancholy privilege to be\r\nthe last resort of some people and the object of the detestation of\r\nothers, and that at an age when the need of rest should be the ruling\r\nconsideration, and the one aim in all things should be to make a good\r\nend.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 10, 1834._--Here is an extract from a letter from\r\nM. Royer-Collard received yesterday: \"I will say in all seriousness to\r\nM. de Talleyrand that, after four years absence, I am not surprised\r\nthat he attaches more importance to newspaper articles than they now\r\npossess. He does not know how much the prestige of the press, like all\r\nother kinds of prestige, is worn out. Any one who replied to a\r\nnewspaper after the lapse of a day or two, would not be understood;\r\nthe occasion would be forgotten. Violent language can no longer either\r\nexalt or abase any one. Amid torrents of praise or abuse one remains\r\nexactly where one was before. It is the characteristic of this evil\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing is settled at Paris, because nothing that will pass\r\nmuster is possible. Here are seen the natural consequences of the last\r\nrevolution. M. de Talleyrand was clever enough and fortunate enough to\r\nturn it to his glory, but he could not repeat the miracle. His last\r\npiece of ingenuity must be to choose the right moment for the end, I\r\nhad almost said for breaking both with England and France, as this\r\nyear has made them. I often come back to the idea that last year was\r\nthe time he should have gone and put himself in a position of safety.\r\nIt was natural to make the mistake; I made it myself. You, Madame la\r\nDuchesse, alone were right. From this very arm-chair from which I am\r\nwriting to you to-day, I was blind enough to combat you, knowing\r\nnothing about it. You alone were in a position to know and to judge. I\r\nwas wrong; this is yet another piece of homage which I am anxious to\r\npay you.\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 11, 1834._--Mr. Damer writes from Paris as\r\nfollows: \"Have you heard a horrible story relating to Madame and Mlle.\r\nde Morell, the sister and the niece of M. Charles de Mornay, of\r\nsomething which happened at the Military School at Saumur. A young man\r\nof that town called M. de la Roncière, not a particularly high-minded\r\nperson, fell in love with Madame de Morell, who may, or may not, have\r\ngiven him some encouragement. I don't know exactly whether she did or\r\nnot, but finally she dismissed him. On this he vowed vengeance, and\r\ntransferred his attentions to the daughter, a young girl of seventeen.\r\nHe wrote her frequent threatening letters, saying he would kill her\r\nfather and mother if she did not listen to him, and one night she was\r\nfound in a condition which amounted to insanity. On hearing of her\r\ncondition, the young man fled from the school, but has since been\r\narrested. He then produced letters, whether genuine or not, which he\r\nsays were written to him by the mother and daughter, and which are\r\nexceedingly compromising. They say Charles de Mornay has come to Paris\r\nabout this affair.\"[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] It ended in a criminal trial, which attracted much\r\n  attention. Emile de la Roncière was tried by Jury at Angers in\r\n  1835, and, in spite of the ability of his counsel, Maître\r\n  Chaix-d'Est-Ange, he was condemned to ten years' penal servitude.\r\n  In 1843 King Louis-Philippe remitted the two years he had still\r\n  to serve.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 12, 1834._--A letter written the day before\r\nyesterday from Paris, while the King was signing, in the next room,\r\nthe order creating the new Ministry, which was too late to appear in\r\nthe morning papers yesterday, arrived in the evening. The names are\r\nunexpected and almost new. If this were the case with all of them, it\r\nmight not perhaps much matter, but one name is that of the Duc de\r\nBassano, who grew grey in the splendours of the Empire, and who has\r\nbeen blamed for its fall. Another is that of M. Bresson, who will\r\nprobably create a sensation and who, in the article of improbability,\r\nwould have deserved the celebrated letter on the marriage of M. de\r\nLauzun. I need not set down what we Londoners thought who witnessed\r\nthe birth, ruin, and resuscitation of this person, all of which took\r\nplace in such bewilderingly rapid succession. It is also needless to\r\nsay that this arrangement of the Ministry puts an end to all M. de\r\nTalleyrand's irresolution, and will give wings to his resignation of\r\nthe London Embassy.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 13, 1834._--Here is the impression produced on M.\r\nRoyer-Collard by the new phase of the Ministry. \"But this is a\r\nPolignac Cabinet! I expected anything rather than this adventure. I am\r\nmuch surprised that M. Passy, who is a man of parts with a future\r\nbefore him, should have enrolled himself in that troupe. The former\r\nCabinet is now thrown into opposition, but whether it attacks or\r\ntreacherously supports the new one, it is making a path for itself\r\nback to power. It seems inevitable to me that it will return.\"\r\n\"Adventure\" is indeed the right word!\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 16, 1834._--We learned by last night's post that\r\nthe fancy Ministry had literally lived \"_ce que vivent les roses,\r\nl'espace d'un matin_.\" The comparison is not outrageous. On the\r\nevening of the 13th, MM. Teste and Passy handed the King their\r\nresignations, which they explained by a reference to the pecuniary\r\nposition of the Duc de Bassano. It was inevitable that these\r\nresignations should be followed by others, and, as a matter of fact,\r\nM. Charles Dupin came and offered his the following morning. On this,\r\nM. de Bassano recognised that it was all up.\r\n\r\nOn the day before yesterday, the 14th, at four in the afternoon,\r\nnothing was arranged, or planned, or hoped. What a cruel and\r\ndeplorable situation for the King! If one wanted to put this\r\nMinisterial crisis into a play, it would not be possible to apply the\r\ntwenty-four hours rule!\r\n\r\nI think the conduct of MM. Teste and Passy was unpardonable. It\r\nappears that it was they who had insisted at first that the Duc de\r\nBassano should have the Presidency of the Council and the Ministry of\r\nthe Interior, and certainly they did not then learn for the first time\r\nof M. de Bassano's financial position, which for two years has been\r\nwell known to every one.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 18, 1834._--Here is the most important passage of\r\na letter written yesterday by M. de Talleyrand to Madame Adélaïde.\r\n\"What a relief! I cordially thank Marshal Mortier for having accepted\r\nthe Presidency of the Council! I would fain follow his example and\r\nmount the breach once more, but for me England is out of the question.\r\nI should like Vienna doubtless in many ways, and, besides, it would\r\nsuit Madame de Dino who, with all her devotion to me, is very sorry to\r\nleave London, where she was so much appreciated. But at my age one no\r\nlonger seeks business so far afield. If it was only a question of a\r\nspecial mission to a congress, such as those of Verona or\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, I should be delighted. And if such a case arises, as\r\nis by no means improbable, and the King thinks me still capable of\r\nrepresenting France, let him issue his orders and I will leave\r\ninstantly, only too happy to devote my last days to his service. A\r\npermanent mission, however, is now no longer possible for me, and\r\nespecially not at Vienna where twenty years ago I represented the\r\nRestoration. Has Your Royal Highness thought of that circumstance,\r\nespecially with reference to Charles X. and Madame la Dauphine, who\r\noften comes to Vienna, and who there receives all the honours due to\r\nher rank, her misfortunes and her near relationship to the Imperial\r\nfamily? In England, the Bourbons of the elder branch are merely\r\nprivate persons. In Austria they are Princes and almost pretenders.\r\nFor the King's ambassador this makes an enormous difference which this\r\nor that person might not perhaps feel, but which is decisive for me,\r\nacross whose career 1814 is written in large characters. No, Madame,\r\nthere is now no other life for me but that of frank and complete\r\nretirement in privacy and simplicity. Perfidy alone can accuse me of\r\nany _arrière pensée_; at my age one occupies one's self only with\r\nmemories.[44]...\"\r\n\r\n  [44] This letter, of which only a part is quoted here, was given\r\n  entire by the Comtesse de Mirabeau in her book _Le Prince de\r\n  Talleyrand et la Maison d'Orléans_, and may also be found in\r\n  Volume V. of the _Mémoires du Prince de Talleyrand_, which were\r\n  published in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal des Débats_ announces M. de Talleyrand's resignation,[45]\r\nand for its own purposes tries to connect it with the Bassano\r\nMinistry. Assuredly, of all explanations this might have been the most\r\nplausible, but it has nothing to do with any of the people whose names\r\nhave occupied the attention of the public during the last fortnight.\r\nThe event might have been recorded in a more sincere and dignified\r\nway, but party spirit distorts everything for its own ends. Never\r\nmind, we need bother our heads about it no longer!\r\n\r\n  [45] Here is the full text of M. de Talleyrand's letter of\r\n  resignation, which I give though it has already appeared in the\r\n  _Mémoires_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_To the Minister of Foreign Affairs._\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE MINISTRE,\r\n\r\n   \"When the King's confidence called me, four years ago, to the\r\n   Embassy at London the very difficulty of the task made it a duty\r\n   to obey, and I believe I have secured in a manner useful to\r\n   France and to his Majesty two interests which I have always in\r\n   mind. The peace of Europe has been preserved throughout those\r\n   years, and this has simplified all our relations with foreign\r\n   Powers. Our policy, formerly isolated, is now linked with that of\r\n   other nations; it has been accepted, appreciated, and respected\r\n   by honest men of every country. The co-operation of England,\r\n   which we have obtained, has cost us nothing in independence, and\r\n   has never offended our national susceptibilities. Such has been\r\n   our respect for the rights of every one, such has been the\r\n   frankness of our methods that, far from inspiring distrust, it is\r\n   our guarantee which is now being sought against the propagandist\r\n   spirit which is perturbing the older Europe. It is undoubtedly to\r\n   the merits and abilities of the King that we must attribute\r\n   results so satisfactory. For myself, I make no other claim than\r\n   to have been the first to divine the profound idea underlying his\r\n   Majesty's policy, and to have announced it to others whom\r\n   subsequent events have persuaded of the truth of my words. But\r\n   now that Europe knows and admires the King, and that, for this\r\n   very reason, the principal difficulties are surmounted; now that\r\n   England has perhaps as great need as we of our mutual alliance,\r\n   and the line she seems disposed to take requires a mind whose\r\n   traditions are less old-fashioned than mine; now I think that,\r\n   without any want of devotion to the King and to my country, I may\r\n   respectfully beg his Majesty to accept my resignation; and I beg\r\n   you, M. le Ministre, to be so good as to present it to him. My\r\n   great age and the infirmities which are its natural consequence,\r\n   the repose which it demands and the thoughts which it suggests,\r\n   make this step a very natural one and justify it only too well,\r\n   making it, indeed, no less than my duty. I trust to the justice\r\n   and kindness of the King to judge.\r\n\r\n        \"I avail, &c.,\r\n        \"LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.\r\n\r\n    \"Valençay, November 13, 1834.\"\r\n\r\n    This letter was published in the _Moniteur Universel_ of January 7,\r\n    1835.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that, during the Ministerial crisis, M. de Rigny behaved\r\nwith great propriety, firmness and dignity. This was not so with\r\neverybody, and here is a detail the authenticity of which is certain.\r\nAt the celebrated Council of ten days ago, when every one threw off\r\nthe mask and M. Guizot tried to impose M. de Broglie on the King as\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, the King raised his hand and said, \"this\r\nhand will never sign a decree recalling M. de Broglie to the Ministry\r\nof Foreign Affairs.\" Then M. Guizot called upon the King to state why\r\nhe refused. \"Because he nearly embroiled me with all Europe,\" was the\r\nreply, \"and if any attempt is made to force my hand I will speak out.\"\r\n\"And we, Sire,\" returned M. Guizot, \"will write.\" Has the like ever\r\nbeen heard of? And after this is it possible that the same people can\r\nagain assemble round the same green table to regulate the destinies of\r\nEurope?\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 19, 1834._--We heard last night by letter from\r\nLondon of the great event of the change of Ministry in England and the\r\nreturn of the Tories to power.[46] This morning did not pass without a\r\ndespatch rider from the King, who brought a letter in His Majesty's\r\nown hand and one from Mademoiselle. These letters are full of\r\ncaresses, prayers and supplications. My name even, which is frequently\r\nrepeated, is invoked. Every kind of pressure is brought to bear on M.\r\nde Talleyrand, to resume his Embassy. The Prince Royal writes to me in\r\nthis sense in the most pressing manner, and all the other letters we\r\nreceived by this post are in this key. Mrs. Dawson Damer writes that\r\nshe hopes that the change of Ministry in England will induce M. de\r\nTalleyrand to withdraw his resignation, and that the Queen of England\r\nwill never forgive me if it is otherwise. Lady Clanricarde says that\r\nshe is all the more afraid that the Tories may fail in their task, as\r\nthe result would be that England would again fall into the clutches of\r\nLord Durham, and that she sees only one agreeable feature in the\r\nsituation, which is the practical certainty of my return to London.\r\nThis is very gracious but not convincing.\r\n\r\n  [46] The Whig Cabinet of Lord Melbourne fell on November 15, and\r\n  was replaced by a Tory Ministry which was not destined to last\r\n  more than three months. The Premier was Sir Robert Peel, and the\r\n  Duke of Wellington replaced Lord Palmerston at the Foreign\r\n  Office.\r\n\r\nM. de Rigny writes excusing himself for his long silence. He seems to\r\nme much disgusted by the events of the last fortnight, and not very\r\nhopeful about the future of the French Ministry, though M. Humann has\r\naccepted office, and the process of patching-up is complete. He adds\r\nthe regulation passage about the _impossibility_ of our not returning\r\nto London, and the King's _positive wishes_ in the matter.\r\n\r\nM. Raullin, from his little corner, also thinks it necessary to swell\r\nthe chorus. He says that Madame de Broglie's doctrinaires are of the\r\nsame opinion, but all this coterie, like the Bourse and the\r\nBoulevards, are very much agitated by the news from England. He tells\r\nme some amusing things about the Duc de Bassano and M. Humann. The\r\ncourier sent after the latter found him at Bar, and he said he would\r\nnot answer till he got to Strasbourg. I like this Alsatian phlegm.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that Admiral Duperré is very coy about accepting the\r\nMinistry of Marine. Till yesterday morning there were ministers only\r\n_in petto_. M. de Bassano was imperturbably signing things and working\r\nwith great ardour at the Ministry of the Interior.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand has also received a great many letters. M. Pasquier,\r\nin reply to a letter of excuses for not being able to be present at\r\nthe case,[47] insinuates a phrase about the immense services he is\r\nstill called upon to render. Madame de Jaucourt writes a few lines, at\r\nthe dictation of M. de Rigny saying, \"Come, we can't do without you,\r\nand save us.\" Finally M. de Montrond, who has said nothing for a long\r\ntime, writes that the news from England has fallen on every one like a\r\nflood of boiling-water. Every one is distracted, and Lord Granville\r\ntakes the change in his country much amiss. He also says he is\r\ncommanded by the King to make us understand the _necessity_ of our\r\nreturn to England, and that MM. Thiers and de Rigny look upon it as\r\ntheir one hope of salvation.\r\n\r\n  [47] Of Armand Carrel, of the _National_.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 24, 1834._--M. de Talleyrand fortunately refuses\r\nto withdraw his resignation, but such is the singular prestige which\r\nhe enjoys that stocks go up and down at Paris according to the greater\r\nor less probability of his departure for London. Letters from all\r\nparts call on him to come to the rescue, and any number of people whom\r\nwe do not even know by name, write to beg him not to abandon France.\r\nThe reason is twofold. The French public will never regard the Duke of\r\nWellington as anything else but an ogre, or M. de Talleyrand as\r\nanything but a person whom the Devil will carry off some day, but who\r\nin the meantime, owing to an unholy bargain with the Prince of\r\nDarkness, has the power of bewitching the Universe. How idiotic it all\r\nis! The public is so credulous in its beliefs, so cruel in its revenge\r\nand its injustice!\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 27, 1834._--A letter from the King came yesterday,\r\nin reply to that in which M. de Talleyrand persisted in his\r\nresignation, and among other things contained the following: \"My dear\r\nPrince, I have never seen anything more perfect, more honourable, or\r\nbetter expressed than the letter which I have just received from you.\r\nIt has deeply touched me. No doubt it costs me much to recognise the\r\njustice of most of the reasons which make you refuse to return to\r\nLondon, but I am too sincere, and too much the friend of my friends\r\nnot to say that you are right.\"[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] This letter, of which only the beginning is given here, is\r\n  dated November 25, and is quoted in full in _Le Prince de\r\n  Talleyrand et la Maison d'Orléans_, and also in Volume V. of the\r\n  Prince's _Mémoires_.\r\n\r\nThis exordium is followed by a new invitation to come to Paris with\r\nall speed to talk over everything. M. Bresson writes to M. de\r\nTalleyrand a very witty and clever letter, in which he begs him to be\r\nso kind as to write him all the witticisms with which his _sudden\r\napotheosis_ will no doubt have inspired him. He is anxious not to miss\r\na single one.\r\n\r\nM. de Montrond writes that the King says there can be nothing finer\r\nthan M. de Talleyrand's letter, and that his reasoning is conclusive.\r\nFor the rest, they are in great embarrassment, and look back to\r\nMarshal Soult with regret, and are even seeking to get him back. A new\r\nignominy for our little Ministers! It appears that the Army is in a\r\nstate of disorganisation.\r\n\r\nThe Poles who came here for the funeral of the Princess Tyszkiewicz\r\nare saying kind things about us, it appears, in Paris. Valençay is\r\napproved of only by the Prince Royal, being opposed by the Flahaut\r\ninfluence. M. de Montrond is furious at the kind things which are\r\nbeing said about Valençay, which he has always treated with ridicule.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, December 1, 1834._--When I was passing through Paris three\r\nmonths ago I saw M. Daure who, in very bad company, was writing in the\r\n_Constitutionnel_, and seemed to me to be in very poor circumstances.\r\nI offered him my interest with M. Guizot to get him employment in the\r\nresearches into the ancient manuscripts and charters of the South,\r\nwith which the Ministry of Public Instruction is occupied. I went so\r\nfar as to make an application on his behalf, which was well received.\r\nI left for Valençay and heard no more of M. Daure, nor of his\r\napplication, till a fortnight ago, when I heard from M. Guizot that\r\nDaure had been nominated to the place for which I had applied. I at\r\nonce wrote to Daure, forwarding the Minister's letter, but, not\r\nknowing his address, made inquiries at Paris which remained without\r\nresult, and my letter was awaiting some light on the whereabouts of\r\nthe poor man, when yesterday evening I received two letters with the\r\nMontauban postmark; one in Daure's handwriting, the other in a\r\nhandwriting unknown to me, which I opened first. It was from an abbé,\r\na friend of Daure, who in accordance with his last wishes, informs me\r\nof his death--and what a death! He has committed suicide! Daure's own\r\nletter, written shortly before his mad act, touched me deeply, and I\r\nwill even say, made me very proud. He refers to the people whom he\r\nliked in London. I blame myself very much for not asking him to come\r\nhere this year; it would probably have turned him aside from this\r\ndreadful end.\r\n\r\nIt recurred to my mind last night that last autumn, at Rochecotte,\r\nwhile walking alone with him on the way to visit my schools I spoke to\r\nhim of his future, and lectured him about his carelessness and\r\nextravagance. He replied with much gratitude, and begging me not to be\r\nat all anxious about him as he had a resource in reserve of which he\r\ncould not speak to any one, which he had prepared long since, and\r\nwhich he would have if everything else failed. He was not, he said, so\r\nimprovident as he seemed, and was as free as possible from anxiety\r\nabout the future. I thought he meant that he had saved a little\r\nmoney--fool that I was! He killed himself at the very moment that we\r\nwere burying poor Princess Tyszkiewicz here. What a sad November it\r\nhas been!\r\n\r\nHere is a little piece of politics taken from one of yesterday's\r\nletters. \"The position of the French Ministers will be decided in a\r\nweek. They intend to seize the first opportunity (which will not be\r\nlong in coming) to speak frankly of all they have done and all that\r\nhas happened, so as to make their position tolerable, or else to go\r\nout. They have had their fill of degradation and do not wish to remain\r\nin power any longer on the present conditions. They must see what the\r\nChamber means to do and what its attitude will be. There was some talk\r\nof a speech from the Throne but they decided that this would not do,\r\nand I think they were right.\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, December 2, 1834._--I am on the eve of a new trouble--the\r\nprobable death of the Duke of Gloucester, which will be a real sorrow.\r\nHow should I not mourn one whose esteem, confidence and friendship\r\nwere so sincere and so thoroughly tried?\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that the new Ambassador in London will not be\r\nappointed till Sir Robert Peel has constituted his Government. Sir\r\nRobert, it is thought, was to pass through Paris yesterday. Another\r\nreason for not making the appointment for a week or ten days is that\r\nno one would dream of accepting it till there is some light on the\r\nfate of the French Ministry which is most uncertain. The slackness of\r\nDeputies in attending the Chamber is attracting attention as a\r\nsymptom of their disinclination to interest themselves in the quarrels\r\nof the Ministers. These quarrels are subterranean but very real. There\r\nis always the same revolt against the arrogant pedantry of some and\r\nthe tangled intrigues of others; it is only their fear of the Chamber\r\nwhich keeps them together at all.\r\n\r\nThey say the King is much depressed, and perhaps his Cabinet owe their\r\nremaining in office to the fact that he is as much afraid of the\r\nChamber as they are. I hear that there is much ridicule of a letter\r\nfrom M. Bresson in reply to a remark of the _Quotidienne_. \"M.\r\nBresson,\" writes a friend, \"has been giving us his genealogy and has\r\nbeen telling us that he has been an important person from the day when\r\nhe handed the despatches to 'the unfortunate and too much\r\nmisunderstood Bolivar,' to that on which he nearly became Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs! We are very fortunate to be represented at Berlin by\r\nso considerable a personage! Can you understand this mania for writing\r\nto the newspapers? And can you wonder that the importance of the press\r\nis so great?\"\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand is quite furious because diplomatic communications\r\nare being bandied about at the Bourse and the Opera. This as well as\r\nmany other things makes it impossible to serve some people.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 7, 1834._--Here we are back in Paris, whose\r\nexhausting and unquiet life is so bad both for M. de Talleyrand and\r\nfor me. Yesterday we were already overwhelmed with visits and social\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nAt twelve I received M. Royer-Collard who, on his way to the Chamber,\r\ncalled to ask for me. He only came in and went out again, and the real\r\nobject of his visit was, I think, to discharge a commission for M.\r\nMolé. The latter asked him to tell me that he wished to come to our\r\nhouse again, but on the first occasion to come to see only me and to\r\nsee me alone. This meeting is fixed for tomorrow, Monday, between four\r\nand five.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard gone, M. le Duc d'Orléans arrived, and hardly had he\r\nsat down when he began to discuss a piece of Madame de Flahaut's\r\ngossip. It all passed off with great good temper and good manners, but\r\nI don't think I surrendered any of my advantages. I was quiet and\r\nrestrained, without the slightest trace of animosity. This was my\r\nchief position: \"Madame de Flahaut's remarks about me do not affect\r\nme. I pay no attention to them. It is impossible that two people whose\r\ncircles, habits and positions are so different as ours, could ever\r\ncome to quarrelling, or that I could be offended by her. What offends\r\nme is the harm she is doing you, Monseigneur.\"--\"But my principal\r\nreason for liking her is that nobody else does.\"--\"Oh, if you reckon\r\nit proportionately on that principle your Royal Highness must simply\r\nadore her!\" We burst out laughing and the matter rested there.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of another subject, namely, how wrong it was of him not to\r\nwrite to us for so long after his visit to Valençay. I replied,\r\n\"Monseigneur, in view of the great age of M. de Talleyrand it was not\r\nvery good manners on your part, but you have a frank and graceful way\r\nof doing things which makes one charmed to forgive you.\"\r\n\r\nHe then came to general questions. He is much embarrassed and troubled\r\nby his present situation, annoyed with his dear friend Dupin for the\r\ncurious way in which he treated the Monarchy last night, and\r\nastonished at Lord Brougham, of whom he tells the following story. On\r\nthe day of Lord Brougham's arrival in Paris, M. le Duc d'Orléans met\r\nhim at Lord Granville's. Unsuitable as the place was, in my opinion,\r\nfor such a topic, the conversation turned on the Amnesty of which the\r\nex-Chancellor declared himself a violent partisan. The Duc d'Orléans\r\ndisputed this view but without apparently convincing him. The\r\nfollowing day at the Tuileries Lord Brougham drew a paper from his\r\npocket and, showing a corner of it to the Prince Royal, said, \"Here\r\nare my reflections on the Amnesty which I am going to show to the\r\nKing.\" This of course was another piece of ill-breeding on the part of\r\na foreigner, but he did in fact hand the paper to His Majesty. It was\r\nfound to be a violent argument _against_ the Amnesty! When mobility\r\nreaches a certain point it is, I think, an evident symptom of\r\ninsanity!\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Orléans concluded his visit by trying to make me feel that\r\nM. de Talleyrand was under an imperative obligation to attach himself\r\nin a public manner to the Government. I replied by a reference to the\r\nstate of his legs. We parted on the best of terms.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down again I found the Entresol crowded. There was\r\nFrederick Lamb, Pozzo, Mollien, Bertin de Veaux, and General Baudrand.\r\nIn spite of the great variety of opinions represented they talked as\r\nfreely of everything as if they had been in the street. The most\r\nanimated was Pozzo, who poured scorn inconceivable on the French\r\nMinistry, pitying the King and speaking very well of him, bemoaning\r\nthe embarrassment of his Ambassadors in foreign countries which is\r\ncaused by what is going on here, and much annoyed by certain passages\r\nin a speech delivered last night by M. Thiers.\r\n\r\nLater on we dined with Count Mollien, where there were M. Pasquier,\r\nBaron Louis, Bertin de Veaux and M. de Rigny, who came late and\r\nbrought news of the vote of the Chamber, which is favourable if you\r\nlike, but which will cost the Ministry dear, and from which, as M. de\r\nRigny at least has the sense to see, nothing can be predicted as to\r\nthe course of the Session.\r\n\r\nIt appears that after a speech by M. Sauzet, which is said to have\r\nbeen admirable, the House wavered and the Ministry gave themselves up\r\nfor lost. M. Thiers feared to put it to the touch, but finally did so\r\nalmost in despair. He spoke, it is said, _miraculously_, and sent\r\neverybody on the other tack. His speech the night before had been a\r\nfiasco, and the English were furious with him on account of his\r\nstrange, and, indeed, inexcusable phrase about England. Yesterday,\r\nhowever, he seems to have triumphed completely.\r\n\r\nHere is a curious fact of which I am quite certain. M. Dupin had\r\npromised the King three days ago to support the order of the day. The\r\nday before yesterday he voted against it; yesterday again he spoke\r\nagainst it but voted _for_ it. Why? Because after M. Sauzet's speech\r\nthe Ministers thought they were lost, and said to M. Dupin: \"M. le\r\nPrésident, prepare yourself to go to the King and have your Cabinet\r\nready, for, in an hour from now, we shall have resigned.\" M. Dupin,\r\nmuch upset, said: \"but I didn't think that all this would be so\r\nserious; I have no wish to see you fall, for I do not at all desire\r\nthat the burden should again fall on my shoulders.\" With these words\r\nhe tried to escape and leave the Vice-President in his place, when\r\nThiers taking him by the arm said: \"No, M. le Président, you shall not\r\ngo till the question is settled; if it goes against us you will go\r\nnowhere else but to the King where you will be condemned to be\r\nMinister.\"\r\n\r\nThis, no doubt, is very interesting, but what an atmosphere! What\r\npeople!\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 8, 1834._--Yesterday, when I got back at four, I was\r\nastonished to see the Duc d'Orléans, whom I supposed to be already on\r\nhis way to Brussels. He was not to leave, however, for another hour,\r\nand he came to tell me that Sir Robert Peel had passed through Paris,\r\nand had sent his brother to him (the Duc d'Orléans) as an intimate\r\nfriend, to beg him to make his excuses to the King for not requesting\r\nthe honour of an audience. His Majesty would, however, easily\r\nunderstand that in the circumstances hours were centuries. We drew two\r\nconclusions from this: first, that Sir Robert Peel had decided to\r\naccept the Premiership, for an ordinary private individual would not\r\nhave considered himself of sufficient importance to send such a\r\nmessage; secondly, that the courtesy of his language proved a feeling\r\nrather friendly to France than the reverse.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Sir Robert Peel, I had a letter from him yesterday,\r\nwritten from Rome, about the Bassano Ministry, very civil and kind in\r\nits terms, in which he says that what alarms him most in this\r\ncombination is that it may prevent M. de Talleyrand from returning to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 9, 1834._--Frederick Lamb, who came to see me\r\nyesterday morning, told me several curious things. He gave me a worse\r\nidea than ever of Lord Palmerston; incredible details, for instance,\r\non his conduct with regard to the Eastern Question, and many other\r\nmatters of which in London we could only form a superficial opinion.\r\nHe told me that at the time of the quarrel between England and Russia\r\nabout Sir Stratford Canning, Madame de Lieven had wanted the matter to\r\nbe arranged so that Frederick Lamb should go to St. Petersburg and Sir\r\nStratford Canning to Vienna. This was proposed to Prince Metternich,\r\nwho replied: \"This arrangement will arrange nothing, for the one\r\nambassador whom we will never agree to accept is Sir Stratford\r\nCanning.\"\r\n\r\nHe told me also that M. de Metternich said of Lord Palmerston: \"He is\r\na tyrant, and the age of tyrants is over.\"\r\n\r\nFrederick Lamb detests Lord Granville, but he does not believe that\r\nthe Tory Cabinet will succeed, though he does not think that the\r\nRadicals will necessarily be their successors. He thinks Lord Grey\r\nwill come back, and is looking for means to extrude Lord Palmerston\r\nand Lord Holland. Like Pozzo and M. Molé, he says extraordinary things\r\nof M. de Broglie. If we may believe them, no one ever made such\r\nblunders.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back yesterday, at four, I received M. Molé. It all passed\r\noff as if we had parted only yesterday. He spoke to me, as he used to\r\ndo, of himself, his affections, friends, attitude of mind--all with\r\nthe charm which is peculiar to him. He told me that I was much more\r\namiable even than I was four years ago, and he stayed nearly an hour.\r\nI have always thought that nobody's conversation is so good, so rapid,\r\nor so agreeable as his. He is in very good taste in an age in which\r\ngood taste is unknown. Perhaps he is not high-souled enough to rule,\r\nbut he is high-minded enough to refuse to be degraded, and that is\r\nalready much.\r\n\r\nMany names, many facts and deeds, were passed in review during that\r\nhour, and I was much pleased with the natural manner in which he\r\napproached every topic. He told me that my mind was so just that even\r\nthose who feared my enmity were reassured; and, in fact, all went off\r\nexcellently. I am not sure that this will be so between M. de\r\nTalleyrand and him. I have undertaken to arrange a meeting, and both\r\nparties have begged me to be present at this first interview, which is\r\nrather amusing.\r\n\r\nM. Molé told me that he yesterday refused an invitation to dine with\r\nM. Dupin on the ground that the latter had given a distorted version\r\nin the tribune of the purely unofficial relations between them a\r\nfortnight ago. M. Molé added that he had no thoughts of the English\r\nEmbassy--as some people were saying--for he did not wish to accept\r\nanything from the present Ministry.\r\n\r\nHe never sees the Duc de Broglie at all now. He thinks Rayneval is the\r\nonly possible Ambassador for London just now, and intends to speak\r\nabout it to the King, with whom he says he is on very good terms. He\r\nis scarcely on bowing terms with Guizot, and his relations with Thiers\r\nare very cold.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 10, 1834._--Yesterday evening M. de Talleyrand was\r\noverwhelmed with a procession of visitors. A great many things were\r\nsaid, of which the following seemed to me the best.\r\n\r\nThey come from Frederick Lamb, who came first, and with whom we were\r\nfor some time alone. He talked a great deal of M. de Metternich and of\r\nhis remark made four months ago about King Louis-Philippe: \"I thought\r\nhe was an intriguer, but now I see quite well he is a King.\" He also\r\ntold us that on the day of the fall of the last English Ministry Lord\r\nPalmerston sent the news to the British _chargé d'affaires_ at Vienna,\r\nand asked him to acquaint M. de Metternich, adding: \"You will never be\r\nin a position to make to M. de Metternich a communication which will\r\ngive him more pleasure.\" The _chargé d'affaires_ took the despatch to\r\nthe Prince, and for some unknown reason read the whole of it to him,\r\nincluding even this last phrase. M. de Metternich made the following\r\nreply, which, I think, is in very good taste: \"Here is another proof\r\nof Lord Palmerston's ignorance of men and things. I cannot be pleased\r\nat an event the consequences of which I cannot yet measure. Tell him\r\nthat I receive the news not with joy but with hope.\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 12, 1834._--I dined yesterday at the Tuileries;\r\nbesides M. de Talleyrand, there were the Molliens, the Valençays, and\r\nBaron de Montmorency. I sat between the King and the Duc de Nemours;\r\nthe last-named has conquered his shyness a little, but he is still\r\nvery timid. He is as white and blonde and pink and slim and\r\ntransparent as a young girl, and not pretty in my opinion.\r\n\r\nNo conversation could be more interesting than the King's, especially\r\nwhen, deserting politics, he plunges into the innumerable memories of\r\nhis extraordinary life. I was struck by two anecdotes which he told\r\nextremely well, and though I fear I may spoil them in the repetition,\r\nI will put them down. There was in the room a portrait of M. de Biron,\r\nDuc de Lauzun, which the King has just had copied from one lent him by\r\nM. de Talleyrand. This naturally led the talk to the original of the\r\nportrait, and the King told how, when he came back to Paris in 1814,\r\nhe saw at his first reception an old man, who approached him and asked\r\nfor a few minutes private conversation away from the crowd. The King\r\nplaced himself in the embrasure of a window, and then the unknown drew\r\nfrom his pocket a ring mounted with the portrait of the Duc d'Orléans,\r\nthe King's father, and said: \"When the Duc de Lauzun was condemned to\r\ndeath I was at the Revolutionary Tribunal, and as he was going out M.\r\nde Biron, whom I had met several times, stopped before me, and said:\r\n'Monsieur, take this ring and promise me that if ever occasion offers\r\nyou will give it to the children of M. le Duc d'Orléans, assuring them\r\nthat I die a faithful friend of their father and a devoted servant of\r\ntheir House.'\" The King was naturally touched by the scrupulous\r\nfidelity with which after so many years the commission had been\r\ndischarged, and asked the unknown his name. The latter refused,\r\nhowever, saying: \"My name will not interest you, and might even awake\r\npainful memories. I have carried out the promise I made to a man about\r\nto die. You will never see or hear of me again;\" and, in fact, he\r\nnever reappeared.\r\n\r\nThis is the second anecdote. When the present King was still in\r\nEngland with Louis XVIII. and the Comte d'Artois, the last-named\r\ninsisted absolutely on his cousin wearing the uniform of the French\r\n_emigrés_, and especially the white cockade. This the Duc d'Orléans\r\npersistently refused, and said he would never do. He appeared always\r\nin civil dress, which gave rise to many bitter discussions. In 1814,\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans, following the whole of France, adopted the white\r\ncockade, and the Comte d'Artois took the uniform of Colonel-General of\r\nthe National Guard. The first day on which the Duc d'Orléans appeared\r\nat the Comte d'Artois', the latter said to him, \"Give me your hat.\" He\r\ntook it, turned it over, and, playing with the white cockade, said:\r\n\"Ah, ah! my dear cousin, what is this cockade? I thought you were\r\nnever going to wear it?\" \"I thought so too, Monsieur; and I thought\r\nalso that you were never destined to wear the coat I see you in\r\nto-day. I am very sorry you have not adopted the cockade, which suits\r\nit best.\" \"My dear fellow,\" replied Monsieur, \"do not deceive\r\nyourself. A coat matters nothing. You may take it or leave it; it is\r\nall the same. But a cockade is a different thing; it is a party\r\nsymbol, a rallying point; and the symbol which you adopt must never be\r\nwithdrawn.\" What I liked in the King, as he was pleased to recount\r\nthis scene, was that he hastened to add: \"Well, Madame, Charles X. was\r\nright, and what he said was cleverer than might have been expected.\"\r\n\"What the King says is true,\" I replied. \"Charles X.'s explanation was\r\nthat of a man of honour and a gentleman, and it is certain that in him\r\nthere was much of both.\" \"Assuredly there was,\" added the King; \"and\r\nbesides that he has a very good heart.\" I was very much pleased to see\r\njustice done to him in that quarter.\r\n\r\nAt nine I went with Madame Mollien to the Comtesse de Boigne's. She\r\nhad been to see me first, and had caused me to be told at Madame\r\nMollien's that she would be much flattered if I would come and see\r\nher sometimes in the evening. Hers is the leading _salon_ at present;\r\nthe one good house which belongs, I will not say to the Court, but to\r\nthe Ministry, as that of Madame de Flahaut belongs to the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, and that of Madame de Massa to the Court proper. There is\r\nno fourth. At Madame de Boigne's there is a reception every evening;\r\npolitics is the leading subject, and they talk of nothing else. The\r\nconversation seemed to me strained and rather embarrassing owing to\r\nthe direct questions which the speakers rather indiscreetly hurled at\r\neach other. \"Will the Duke of Wellington be able to go on?\"--\"Do you\r\nthink that Mr. Stanley will join Sir Robert Peel?\"--\"Do you believe\r\nthat a reconciliation between Lord Grey and Lord Brougham is\r\npossible?\" These are specimens of the interrogations with which I was\r\nnaïvely assailed. I escaped by pleading absolute ignorance, concluding\r\nwith a laugh by saying that I did not expect to have to solve\r\nquestions of conscience on a festive occasion. The matter ended there,\r\nbut I got a disagreeable impression in spite of the excessive\r\ngraciousness of our hostess, and I was glad to get away.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 14, 1834._--Lady Clanricarde came to breakfast\r\nyesterday, and at half-past eleven we left for the Académie française.\r\nM. Thiers, who was being received, had secured the best places for us,\r\nwhich I was grateful to observe were far from those occupied by his\r\nfamily, who were with the Duchesse de Massa in an elevated gallery. In\r\nour neighbourhood there were only Madame de Boigne, M. and Madame de\r\nRambuteau, Marshal Gérard, M. Molé, M. de Celles, and Madame de\r\nCastellane. The last-named has got stouter, heavier, and thicker, but\r\nshe retains her pleasant face, the mobility of whose lower parts is so\r\nattractive. She seemed so delighted, so moved, and so touched on\r\nseeing me (I used to be intimate with her and knew all about her\r\naffairs, so much that the imprudence of her subsequent quarrel with me\r\nwas incredible) that I was quite touched too, and we shook hands. She\r\nsaid, \"May I come and see you again?\" and I answered, \"Yes, with all\r\nmy heart.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the story. When the Tuileries were against me under the\r\nRestoration, Madame de Castellane turned against me, and, without\r\nthinking of the injury it was in my power to inflict on her, she broke\r\nwith me. I was deeply hurt, because I was very fond of her; but to\r\nrevenge myself would have been mean, and, in spite of all my faults, I\r\nam incapable of doing anything so low as that would have been. I think\r\nthat at the bottom of her heart she was grateful to me for having\r\nspared her.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand, as a member of the Institute, came into the hall\r\nleaning on the arm of M. de Valençay. The effect of his entry was\r\nunbelievable. Every one rose with one accord in the galleries, as well\r\nas on the floor of the house, and this, no doubt, with a certain\r\nstirring of curiosity, but also with an impulse of respect, of which\r\nhe was deeply sensible. I know that in spite of the crowd which\r\nobstructed the approaches every one made way for him.\r\n\r\nThe sitting began at one. M. Thiers is so small that he entered\r\nwithout being seen, being surrounded by Villemain, Cousin, and some\r\nothers. No one noticed him till he stood up alone to begin his speech.\r\nHe spoke with the best possible accent, and pronounced everything\r\ndistinctly. His voice was sustained, and his gestures rare. He was not\r\nover voluble, and for the first few moments he was as pale as death\r\nand trembling from head to foot. This made a much better impression\r\nthan if he had displayed the insolence with which he is often\r\nreproached. In spite of the disagreeable tone of his voice, he never\r\noffended the ear; he was neither monotonous nor shrill; and, in fact,\r\nLady Clanricarde went so far as to think him splendid!\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand and M. Royer-Collard were opposite to him, and he\r\nseemed to speak only for them. His discourse was brilliant. I do not\r\nknow whether it was precisely academic, though it was full of wit, of\r\ngood taste, and fine language in certain places, but there is no doubt\r\nthat it was political, and he spoke it much more as if it was an\r\nimprovisation than as if it was a lecture. Certain of his movements,\r\ntoo, recalled the tribune, and on the audience the effect produced was\r\nmuch more parliamentary than literary, but always favourable and\r\nsometimes even enthusiastic. M. de Talleyrand was quite moved, and M.\r\nRoyer-Collard moved his wig up and down in a way that signified the\r\nmost lively approbation! The passage on calumny was spoken with a\r\nconviction and an intimacy which was contagious, and was received with\r\na salvo of applause.\r\n\r\nThe discourse is in the highest degree anti-revolutionary. He is\r\northodox in his literary principles, he is--and this is what I like in\r\nhim above all--he is penetrated through and through with a sentiment\r\nof honesty which greatly pleased me, and which should be useful to M.\r\nThiers throughout the remainder of his career. This fine speech did\r\nnot require the tedious reply of M. Viennet to bring out its\r\nexcellence; no one listened to him, and he only succeeded in drawing\r\nattention to the fact that the hour was very late and that it was\r\ndreadfully hot.\r\n\r\nIt is said that during M. Thiers' speech M. de Broglie was making\r\nmerry jests. M. Guizot was cross, and not very well satisfied, I\r\nthink, to see his rival make a double success--political and\r\nliterary--in the same week.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 16, 1834._--Yesterday I paid several calls, and found\r\nMadame de Castellane in. She had missed me when she came to see me.\r\nShe insisted on my hearing her history during the past twelve years;\r\nand she tells it so well that I thought she must have had some\r\npractice in pouring it into the ears of others than myself in these\r\ncooing tones. She has lost all her youth, and is a large, short, squat\r\nperson. Except for her smile, she is no longer the same person that I\r\nonce knew--physically, that is. Morally, I thought she had made up her\r\nmind to be grave, rather than that she had become serious. She is\r\nwitty and caressing as ever, and she talked a great deal; I very\r\nlittle. My heart was full of many old memories; and though she was\r\nkind I could not recover my old confidence in her. However, I received\r\nall she said well, and I am not sorry to be on good terms with her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 17, 1834._--Yesterday I allowed myself to be\r\npersuaded to go with her to the Court of Peers. We sat, not in a\r\nconspicuous box, but in that of the Duchesse Decazes, which is in a\r\nretired position, and from which one can see and hear without being\r\nseen. I had never been there, the sittings not having been public till\r\n1830. The proceedings of yesterday had been very much advertised and\r\nexcited general curiosity, so the House was full.\r\n\r\nWhenever one comes to Paris one is always sure of finding some\r\nscandalous drama in progress for the amusement of the public.\r\nYesterday it was the case against Armand Carrel of the _National_.\r\n\r\nM. Carrel did not at all correspond to my expectations. No doubt he\r\nwas impertinent, but not with that kind of bold and energetic\r\ninsolence, that verve and talent which impress you even while you are\r\noffended with the man himself. The effect of the speech he had written\r\nwas very feeble, and he made an impression which was positively\r\npainful when he tried to speak extempore. It was General Exelmans who\r\nvociferated about the _assassination_ of Marshal Ney, and scandalised\r\nevery one. His manner was that of a drunken man, and was all the more\r\nridiculous as no one could help remembering the platitudes he used to\r\nutter during the Restoration; which, I understand, were very cruelly\r\ncast up against him last night at the Minister of Marine's party. In\r\nthe morning in the House of Peers he was supported only by M. de\r\nFlahaut, who was in a great state of excitement, and whose behaviour\r\nwas most improper.\r\n\r\nHe disgusted everybody by his cries of \"Go on! Go on!\" addressed to\r\nCarrel when the President wished to bring him to an end. It was this\r\nencouragement which made Carrel resist M. Pasquier and argue that he\r\nhad no right to stop him when a member of the Chamber and, in fact,\r\none of his judges, pressed him to continue.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I learned from every one that M. de Flahaut was\r\nuniversally detested for his arrogance, ill-temper, acrimony, and\r\nignorance. He will soon become as unpopular as his wife.\r\n\r\nM. Pasquier presided with firmness, moderation, dignity, and coolness.\r\nI confess, however, that I agree with those who would have preferred\r\nhim to stop M. Carrel when he spoke of \"the young men who had fought\r\ngloriously in the troubles of last April,\" and not when he referred to\r\nthe case of Marshal Ney. The first question dealt with--material\r\ninterests--would have found more sympathy both inside and outside the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nWe had a dinner yesterday--a dozen people, my daughter Pauline being\r\nthe twelfth. It is not a bad thing that she should learn to listen to\r\nserious conversation without being bored. She has a good manner in\r\nsociety, where her open countenance and kindly manners seem to please.\r\nAfter dinner people came to pay visits just as if we were Ministers.\r\nThe fact is that it was Thursday, the reception day at the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs and the Ministry of Marine, and I suppose that people\r\ntook us on the way going or coming.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 19, 1834._--M. le Duc d'Orléans is returned from\r\nBrussels; he came to see me yesterday, and invited me to a ball he is\r\ngiving on the 29th. He stayed only a moment, when he was sent for by\r\nthe King; the reason for which I learned later.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot was the next visitor. He seemed less at his ease than usual,\r\nand tried to compose himself by prosing about England, France, and all\r\nsorts of things, but he must have found me a very unworthy listener.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I listened without enthusiasm, for he was\r\nextremely tedious, and soon departed.\r\n\r\nMadame de Castellane then came, quite out of breath, from M. Molé, in\r\norder that I might warn M. de Talleyrand of what was going on. M. le\r\nDuc d'Orléans, carried away by the deplorable Flahaut influence,\r\nproposed at the opening of the sitting of the House of Peers to-day\r\nand the reading of the minutes of last meeting, to protest along with\r\nhis group against the _assassination_ of Marshal Ney, and to demand\r\nthe revision of the case. Fortunately, M. Decazes was warned, and went\r\nand told M. Pasquier. He rushed to M. Molé, who is one of the\r\ntwenty-three survivors of the peers who tried the Marshal. There was\r\na great and well-justified tumult in the camp. They went to Thiers,\r\nwho hastened to the King, who knew nothing of the affair, and was very\r\nangry. He sent after his son everywhere, and after a very lively scene\r\nhe forbade him to do anything. His great argument was as follows: \"If\r\nyou demand that Marshal Ney's case shall be re-opened, what will you\r\nsay to any Carlist peer who comes (as some one very well may) and asks\r\nthat the verdict against Louis XVI.--which was assassination if you\r\nlike!--shall be reversed?\" I heard the last part of the affair from M.\r\nThiers, who came to see M. de Talleyrand quite at the end of the\r\nmorning. Bertin de Veaux, who had got wind of the thing, also arrived\r\nquite out of breath.\r\n\r\nFinally, the King's good sense prevailed and put a stop to this nice\r\nbusiness. But that it should ever have entered any one's head to\r\npropose such a thing is one of the extraordinary features of this age!\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 20, 1834._--Yesterday I got a letter from London,\r\ndated the 18th, and took it at once to M. de Talleyrand. I read him a\r\npassage about the terror caused by the suggestion that M. de Broglie\r\nmight be sent as Ambassador to England, and the necessity of\r\nnominating M. de Talleyrand's successor. He quite saw the point, and\r\nat once wrote that he wished to see the King. At this very moment M.\r\nde Rigny arrived, bringing him another private letter to see. M. de\r\nTalleyrand has been urging the choice of Rayneval, which, I think, has\r\nnot pleased M. de Rigny, if I may judge by what he said to me at\r\ndinner: \"There is a very strong reason for not sending M. de Rayneval\r\nto London, but that is the secret of the Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\nif it was the Admiral's secret I would tell you.\" I did not insist.\r\n\r\nI know that at five o'clock it was arranged with the King that\r\nRigny should write a letter, confidential but producible, to London,\r\nin which he should say that the King would choose Molé,\r\nSainte-Aulaire, or Rayneval, and that they would be glad to know which\r\nof the three would be most agreeable to the Duke of Wellington. I\r\nwent so far as to say to M. de Talleyrand that this seemed to me a\r\nvery maladroit proceeding, as if the Duke chooses Rayneval it will be\r\nvery difficult not to appoint him, and if he wants Molé, Molé will\r\nrefuse, and they will, in fact, have to take Sainte-Aulaire, who is\r\nnot wanted either by the King or by the Council, or by the Duke. How\r\nbadly everything is directed and managed here! There is no common\r\nsense or simplicity, or elevation of mind anywhere, and yet they\r\npretend to govern not only thirty-two millions of subjects, but also\r\nall Europe!\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 21, 1834._--I heard the following facts on excellent\r\nauthority: (1) They don't want to send Rayneval to London as\r\nambassador; (2) it is Broglie's doctrinaire group who are opposing it;\r\n(3) London was yesterday offered formally and officially to Molé, who\r\nformally and officially declined it; (4) this morning they had got to\r\nSébastiani but nothing was settled.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 24, 1834._--Sébastiani was being talked of yesterday\r\nas if his appointment would be in the _Moniteur_ of to-morrow, but the\r\nmore public his name is made the greater clamour it excites. M. de\r\nRigny is dying to resign his Ministry and ask for the London Embassy,\r\nbut they are afraid that the machine might go to pieces under the\r\ndifficulties caused by the resignation of an important member of the\r\nCabinet. It seems that it is the condition of Rayneval's financial\r\naffairs which prevents his being appointed. He is said to be over head\r\nand ears in debt and almost bankrupt.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 28, 1834._--I heard through M. Molé that M. de\r\nBroglie had an astonishing influence on the present Ministry, which\r\nwas unsuspected by the King, that M. Decazes used to go every morning\r\nand tell him all that went on; that M. de Rigny and M. Guizot allowed\r\nthemselves to be much influenced by him, and that no choice was made\r\nwithout being previously submitted to him.\r\n\r\nWill it be believed that in the _Journal des Débats_ they translate\r\nall Sir Robert Peel's speech and leave out--what? The complimentary\r\npassage about the Duke of Wellington which certainly contained nothing\r\noffensive to France. And this when the Duke is Foreign Secretary, and\r\nis extremely well disposed to France, and when the _Débats_ is reputed\r\nthe semi-official organ of the Government. Truly people here are\r\nextraordinarily maladroit in spite of the French wit!\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 29, 1834._--Poor little Madame de Chalais died last\r\nnight. She was such a happy person; with that good and regular\r\nhappiness which it is given only to some women to experience. Life\r\nforsakes those who are weary of their pilgrimage all too slowly; it\r\nalways goes too quickly from those who are enjoying the journey. In\r\nwhatever way one importunes Providence, whether one fatigues one's\r\nself with prayers or allows one's wishes to be divined in discreet\r\nsilence, the answer is almost always no, and the sentence usually\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\nWhat grief at Saint-Aignan! There she was the darling of all the\r\ninhabitants. I seem to hear the cries of all these old servants whom I\r\nknow and for whom she represented the third generation they had\r\nserved. The poor, the sick, the well-to-do--all idolised her. She was\r\nso helpful, so kindly, and so gracious! It is more than a death; it is\r\nthe destruction of a young happiness and of an ancient and illustrious\r\nrace. I am profoundly shaken by it.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 31, 1834._--Yesterday morning I had a good long visit\r\nfrom M. Royer-Collard. He told me the whole history of his\r\nprofessorship, and gave me a glimpse of his system of philosophy; then\r\nhe talked a great deal about Port Royal. The hours he gives me are\r\nreally precious, but too rare and too short for all that there is to\r\nlearn from a mind like his.\r\n\r\nMadame de Castellane came afterwards; if I were to allow it for an\r\ninstant she would constitute herself my sick nurse! She told me that\r\nM. Molé was writing his Memoirs, and that there were already five\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThen came M. le Duc d'Orléans; he told me a great deal about his Ball\r\nof the night before, of which the following, among the rest, remains\r\nwith me. The greatest elegance was blended with the utmost\r\noriginality. The company was brilliant, the supper superb; there were\r\nflowers, artistically grouped statues, lights enough to blind you,\r\nwhite and gold everywhere, new liveries, grooms-of-the-chambers in\r\nfull dress with swords by their sides, clad in velvet and powdered.\r\nThe women were covered with diamonds; the Queen was charmed and Madame\r\nAdélaïde jealous, saying, \"This is pure Louis Quinze.\" All the men\r\nwere in uniform, but in boots and trousers, while M. le Duc de\r\nNemours, who wore the coat of a general officer covered with gold\r\nlace, and came in short breeches, stockings, and shoes, was voted by\r\nevery one extremely distinguished and good-looking. M. le Duc\r\nd'Orléans asked me whether I did not prefer boots and trousers for a\r\nsoldier, and I replied, \"The Emperor Napoleon, who gained a few\r\nbattles, when he dined alone with the Empress wore silk stockings and\r\nbuckled shoes every evening.\"--\"Really?\"--\"Yes, Monseigneur.\"--\"Ah,\r\nthat is different.\" Here is the reverse of the medal. The Deputies\r\ninvited (invited I mean as Deputies only, for there were others who\r\nwere asked as Ministers and Generals), of whom there were only: MM.\r\nOdillon Barrot, Bignon, and Etienne, came in ordinary evening dress in\r\norder to be more conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Royal is full of singular contrasts. There are, for\r\ninstance, his aristocratic tastes and pretensions, and his detestable\r\npolitics. Yesterday we had a crow to pluck for the first time on the\r\nsubject of the Duke of Wellington. \"How like the King you are,\" said\r\nthe Prince. \"My father knows you are always talking to me on his side,\r\nand so he likes you very much.\"--\"Monseigneur, I never talk except on\r\nmy own side and on the side of your interests: but all the same I am\r\nvery proud of the approbation of the King.\" It all ended very kindly,\r\nfor he asked leave to add his portrait to those which I have collected\r\nat Rochecotte.\r\n\r\nHere, then, I end this year 1834, memorable in my life because it\r\ncloses the English period. The four years which I have just passed in\r\nthat country have placed me in a new frame, given me a new point of\r\ndeparture, and directed me towards a new series of ideas. They have\r\nmodified the view taken of me by the world. What I owe to England\r\nwill, I hope, never leave me, and will remain with me till the end of\r\nmy life. Now let us lay up a provision of strength for the evil days,\r\nwhich probably will not fail to come, and for which it is well to be\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1835\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 3, 1835._--I yesterday received the Duc de Noailles,\r\nwho had written me a charming letter to ask leave to call. He came to\r\ntalk to me about his wife's niece, Madame de Chalais, whom he loved as\r\nhis own child and whom he knew I deeply regretted. We mourned\r\ntogether; then he spoke a little of politics with good sense and good\r\ntaste, a little of society, and much of Maintenon. He stayed a long\r\ntime and seemed at his ease and very happy. He expressed the desire to\r\nsee me often and to become a little intimate with us. He is one of the\r\nmen whom M. Royer-Collard esteems, is very ugly, and older in\r\nappearance than in reality. He is studious, and his manners are\r\nexcellent and very distinguished. I saw a great deal of his wife when\r\nshe was Mlle. Alicia de Mortemart, and was living with her sister the\r\nDuchesse de Beauvilliers, with whom she went to Saint-Aignan. We are,\r\nmoreover, nearly related to the Mortemarts. The old Princesse de\r\nChalais, who brought up M. de Talleyrand, was a Mortemart, and the\r\ndaughter of M. de Vivonne, the brother of Madame de Montespan.\r\n\r\nYesterday I was at the great evening reception at the Tuileries, the\r\nQueen having sent word to me by Madame Mollien that I might come and\r\ngo by the private apartments, and so not have to wait for my carriage.\r\nIt was the last Court of the season, and I took my daughter-in-law,\r\nMadame de Valençay. The palace, when lit up, is really superb, and\r\nmany things look very well--in contrast to many others. This applies\r\nto the black coats scattered here and there among the uniforms, the\r\nelaborate dresses of some women, and the bourgeois caps of others.\r\nThere was nothing like disorder, but there was no distinction of rooms\r\nor places. There is no procession; the Court makes its entry when all\r\nthe company is assembled and makes a tour of the ladies, after which\r\nthe men present file past by themselves. A little man in uniform\r\nprecedes their Majesties and asks each lady her name, a proceeding\r\nwhich in the case of three quarters of them seems absolutely\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThey were very gracious to me, and I think they were pleased that I\r\nwent on the day of one of the great receptions which may well be\r\ncalled \"public.\" They feared that I would restrict myself to special\r\naudiences. That, I think, would have been bad taste. I might perhaps\r\nprefer not to go at all, but when one is pleased to see people in\r\nprivate it does not do to hide one's self and repudiate them in\r\npublic. Whenever she saw me, the Queen herself told me I might go;\r\nthey opened the little door and I escaped delighted to be relieved of\r\nthe burden.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 7, 1835._--M. Molé came to see me and said many\r\ncurious things--among others, that he \"had a mission to purge the\r\nGovernment of doctrinaire influences.\" He has a terrible hatred of\r\ndoctrinaires, and he is a good hater. He quite startled me on this\r\nsubject, and I asked myself if he was equally good at loving. The\r\nanswer to this embarrassed me and I went no further.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 8, 1835._--Madame Adélaïde having asked me to bring\r\nPauline to see her, I did so yesterday. The King told me to wait for\r\nhim at his sister's which kept me for three hours. The King had just\r\nheard of the strange scene among the Mont Saint-Michel people who were\r\namnestied. On the very day of their liberation the Republicans among\r\nthem (the Carlists said their prayers and went quietly back to La\r\nVendée) sang the most horrible songs and ended by swearing on their\r\ntable knives to compass the death of the King. His Majesty had the\r\npolice reports before him and gave us all the details.\r\n\r\nHe talked for a long time and on all subjects--I must say with much\r\ngood sense, ability, clearness, and prudence. He perfectly understood\r\nthe destiny of England, judged the European situation very acutely,\r\nand spoke of his son in a most reasonable way. He said two things in\r\nparticular to me which struck me very much. The first was that,\r\nwithout having been carried away so far as his son, he had himself\r\nfallen into several errors of which experience had cured him. He\r\nreturned to the subject of the Revolution of July, and was careful to\r\nshow that in principle he disapproved of it. Thus he told me that his\r\nMinisters had wished him to wear the July decoration and that he had\r\nrefused, saying that he had taken no part in the Revolution except to\r\nput a stop to its disastrous consequences. He added, \"You never saw me\r\nwearing that decoration, Madame!\"\r\n\r\nHe is more and more embarrassed in the choice of his Ambassador in\r\nLondon, for the news received yesterday from Naples proves that\r\nSébastiani is no longer capable of undertaking the post. I think the\r\nKing would like M. de Latour-Maubourg, but he is ill and talks of\r\nnothing but retiring to the country. M. de Sainte-Aulaire will be here\r\nin two or three days, and I imagine that the lot will fall on him. The\r\nKing and I discussed the possibility of sending Rigny to London, but\r\nthe King said, \"Rigny's only possible successor at the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs would be Molé, but Guizot would never dare to stay in\r\noffice with him because Broglie would be furious, and they think they\r\ncan't do without Guizot in the Chamber.\" The objection to\r\nSainte-Aulaire is the influence M. Decazes has over him, which is bad\r\nin itself and justly displeasing to the King.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand's letter of November 13 was at last read to the\r\nCouncil yesterday. It will appear in to-day's _Moniteur_, and there\r\nwill also be published a reply from M. de Rigny in the politest terms.\r\nThey only asked that one word should be changed, and this was agreed\r\nto, as it made the sense clearer without altering it. They asked M. de\r\nTalleyrand to allow them to say \"this propagandist spirit\" instead of\r\n\"certain doctrines.\"\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I was at the great ball at the Tuileries. M. le Duc\r\nd'Orléans attacked me again on the subject of the English elections.\r\nHe is curiously afraid that they may turn out to the advantage of the\r\nTory Cabinet. This is the second time we have had it out on this\r\nquestion. Yesterday I tried to avoid the discussion, but he insisted,\r\nsaying that \"perhaps I should convert him,\" to which I replied, \"I\r\nshould indeed be proud, Monseigneur, to convert you to your own side.\"\r\n\r\nHe had just been re-reading M. de Talleyrand's letter of resignation.\r\nHe said it was a masterpiece, a real historic document, which would\r\nattract a great deal of attention abroad. Nothing, he thought, could\r\nbe so noble or so simple, and it was the more kind to the King as no\r\none here had the courage to praise him. M. de Talleyrand had, however,\r\nshowed himself to be terribly conservative, and this would give rise\r\nto a great controversy in the press. I answered: \"Perhaps,\r\nMonseigneur, but what does it matter? Whether M. de Talleyrand speaks\r\nor is silent, he is always attacked by ill-disposed papers. At his\r\nage, when one is taking leave of the public, one may well take the\r\nopportunity of pleasing one's self and showing one's self in one's\r\ntrue colours to be an honest man as one has always been, the friend of\r\none's country and of social order, and, what is more, a man of one's\r\nown class, which does not necessarily mean a prejudiced person. You\r\nsay that M. de Talleyrand _alone_ has the courage here to praise the\r\nKing--and why? Because he is a gentleman, a great personage, and\r\ntherefore a Conservative. A monarchy, believe me, must always come\r\nback to people like that.\" He went on, \"Oh, yes, the letter will be\r\nmuch admired abroad.\"--\"Yes, Monseigneur, it will be admired abroad,\r\nbut it will also be admired by every honest man at home, and your\r\nRoyal Highness will permit me to neglect the rest.\" Here is another\r\nspecimen of my conversations with this young Prince, who lacks neither\r\nintelligence nor courage nor grace, but whose judgment is still\r\ngreatly wanting in prudence and balance.\r\n\r\nAs to the King, he is prudent above all things, and what is more, he\r\nis very gracious to me. He came up to me and said, with a smile,\r\n\"Have you given M. de Talleyrand an account of our long\r\nconversation?\"--\"Of course, Sire, it was too full of interest not to\r\nmake me anxious to give him that pleasure.\"--\"Ah, then I am sure you\r\nwill not have forgotten my story about the July decoration.\"--\"It was\r\nthe first thing I told M. de Talleyrand, and I am going to tell my son\r\nand my grandson. I wish my descendants to remember it in order that\r\nthey may in the future repeat what I now say every day, which is that\r\nthe King has a great understanding.\" It was said long ago that when\r\nflattery did not succeed it was the fault of the flatterer, not of the\r\nflattery. I think that yesterday the flatterer was quite efficient!\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 12, 1835._--Our letters from Paris announce that M.\r\nThiers' refusal to remain in the Ministry with the Duc de Broglie as\r\nPresident of the Council and Minister of Foreign affairs (a refusal\r\nwhich the King, who does not wish to be entirely delivered up to the\r\ndoctrinaires, will not hear of) is again stopping the machine. The\r\nChamber of Deputies is beginning to get excited, and it is impossible\r\nto see clearly what the result of all this will be.\r\n\r\nThere is to be a collection at Saint-Roch for the Asylums directed by\r\nMadame Adélaïde who accordingly has the choice of collectors. She has\r\nchosen Mesdames de Flahaut and Thiers. The former, who is said to be\r\nfurious at the choice of her partner, has refused, and this little\r\ndifficulty has contrived to attract some attention among the many more\r\nimportant and insoluble problems of the moment.\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 14, 1835._--Yesterday's letters leave no doubt as\r\nto the _dénouement_ of the Ministerial crisis.\r\n\r\nIt is practically the crisis of last November over again. Then Marshal\r\nGérard was replaced by Marshal Mortier; now M. de Broglie replaces\r\nMortier in the Presidency and Rigny gives up to him Foreign Affairs\r\nand takes War until the arrival of Maison, to whom a courier has been\r\nsent. If the latter accepts, the Embassy at St. Petersburg will be\r\nvacant, but it is thought that he will refuse. In that case will Rigny\r\nremain definitely as Minister of War or will he go to Naples, giving\r\nplace to some secondary general? No one knows yet. Thus, with the\r\naddition of Broglie and Maison, and the subtraction of Rigny,\r\npractically every one remains at his post. It was hardly worth making\r\nsuch a fuss about!\r\n\r\nThis is what I hear as to M. Thiers, who at first refused to take\r\noffice with M. de Broglie. He was harried and worried in every\r\ndirection, Mignet and Cousin trying to dissuade him, Salvandy to make\r\nhim accept. During this period a numerously attended meeting of\r\ndeputies assembled at M. Fulchiron's. Thiers, hearing of this, said\r\nthat if this meeting asked him he would accept office. Salvandy\r\nhurried with a deputation to obtain Thiers' consent, which was given\r\nin order that he might not be accused of ruining the only possible\r\ncombination, and because he is backed by a solemn expression of\r\nopinion from a parliamentary majority. It is thought, however, that he\r\nwill soon repent of having yielded. The balance is no longer even.\r\nThey will be two to one against him in the Council, and conditions are\r\nquite against the present arrangement lasting.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from M. Molé which says, \"You have left a gap here\r\nwhich nothing could fill; no one has felt this more than I have in the\r\nlast few days. I hope, I may say I am sure, that you would have\r\napproved of me. You are one of the very few people of whose approval I\r\nthink before I act. We have not been fighting about individuals but\r\nfor the Amnesty. A complete general Amnesty was my condition. Those\r\nwho resigned in order to get their way provoked a demonstration\r\nagainst it in the Chamber. I alone maintained that facts were on our\r\nside. However, some who, like me, were for the Amnesty lost courage,\r\nand the result is that the old Ministry is being reconstructed under\r\nM. de Broglie. Several of its members are by no means proud of this,\r\nbut they are all accepting a position on which the future will\r\npronounce judgment as well as on many other things.\"\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 16, 1835._--M. Royer-Collard writes to me as\r\nfollows about the late Ministerial crisis: \"It was on Tuesday the\r\n10th that the King asked Guizot to summon M. de Broglie. No doubt you\r\nexpect to hear of the insolence of the conqueror. Nothing of the sort.\r\nM. de Broglie, coached by Guizot, had laid aside not only his\r\narrogance, but even his personal dignity which should not be\r\nsurrendered even in exchange for the Presidency of the Council. He\r\nexpressed regret in humble terms for the past and promised to be good\r\nin the future. You may take this for certain--the Necker pride, which\r\nis the same type as the Broglie pride, has given way.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on, _à propos_ of the paper signed by the so-called Fulchiron\r\nmeeting about Thiers, M. Royer-Collard says: \"It is certain that\r\nThiers has capitulated. He accepts, but is separated and disengaged\r\nfrom the doctrinaires whom he has humiliated. He _returns_ whereas\r\nGuizot _stays_. No one, I think, gains by this patch work.\"\r\n\r\nStill further on there is this. \"When M. Molé came to see me\r\nyesterday, I embraced him as I would the survivor of a shipwreck. He\r\ncomes out of the matter best of all, and he has surpassed himself.\"\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 23, 1835._--Yesterday evening I had a very gracious\r\nreply from the Duchesse de Broglie to the letter of congratulation I\r\nhad addressed to her. She dissembles her political triumph by the use\r\nof humble Biblical quotations. The note of her letter is kindliness,\r\nand in fact I am pleased with her; she is a deserving person.\r\n\r\nI had also written to M. Guizot on the occasion of his brother's\r\ndeath. He did not reply before the period of mourning was over; he did\r\nfinally answer however, and yesterday there came from him a very\r\ncajoling letter. The only phrase dealing with politics is: \"I am one\r\nof those who should say that the crisis is over, but I am also one of\r\nthose who know that nothing is ever finished in this world, and that\r\none has to begin again every day. Our life consists of a continual\r\neffort to secure a success which is always incomplete. I accept this\r\nwithout illusions, and without discouragement.\"\r\n\r\nI shall add an extract from a letter from M. Royer-Collard which also\r\ncame yesterday evening. \"All that has happened, the _dénouement_ as\r\nwell as the crisis, is very sad. The King and Thiers have, as you see,\r\nbeen conquered by Guizot, and, as a result, M. de Talleyrand as well,\r\nin what remains to him of public life. It is true that this victory\r\nbears no resemblance to a triumph, and makes none of the noise in the\r\nworld which a triumph causes. It is obscured by the uncertainty of\r\nthings in the Chamber. Guizot however is a skilled intriguer, and his\r\nobstinacy is in proportion to his presumption and to his burning\r\nthirst for personal predominance. He will never stop till he is\r\nconquered by the force of circumstances. I doubt whether there exists\r\nanywhere at present a force which would be sufficient to conquer him.\r\nThiers had the satisfaction of making them wait thirty-six hours for\r\nhim and of going his own way in the tribune, but the fact remains that\r\nhe gave in, and that it was the fear of Guizot and the little\r\ndoctrinaires that prevented him from entering the Gérard-Molé\r\nMinistry, much as he would have liked to do so. Till something else\r\nturns up he is absorbed in the general submission. From this chaos M.\r\nMolé has emerged with an increased reputation of which you may rest\r\nassured that he owes part to you. You came into his life more than\r\nonce and brought succour. He likes you very much and feels the need of\r\nyour approbation. I owe his friendship to his belief that I helped to\r\nbring you and him together.\"\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 10, 1835._--Yesterday I had a curious account of what\r\npassed at the secret committee of the House of Peers on the form of\r\njudgment.[49] Several Peers declared that they could not get rid of\r\nthe matter by sentencing the accused in default, that is to say by\r\nsentencing empty benches. Of this opinion were MM. Barthè,\r\nSainte-Aulaire, Séguier and, it is believed, de Bastard. M. Decazes\r\nand some others contended that the cases should be taken separately.\r\nM. Cousin reproached M. Pasquier in the most violent manner for not\r\nhaving heard counsel for the defence, and the Chamber for being weak\r\nenough to uphold the decision of its President. M. Pasquier in his\r\nreply was sentimental and pathetic, but the most serious incident was\r\nthe declaration of M. Molé who said in so many words that if they\r\npassed sentence on the accused in his absence he would protest. This\r\ndeclaration had a great effect, and several Peers, among them the Duc\r\nde Noailles, adopted M. Molé's view. It is added: \"You can easily see\r\nthat this declaration is the nucleus of a new Molé Ministry if the\r\nimpossibility of carrying on the case should force the present\r\nMinisters to resign. On the other hand it would be so dangerous to be\r\nweak in the presence of such accused that the necessity of standing\r\nfast will override all other considerations. It remains to be seen how\r\nit is to be done. This case is a hydra!\"\r\n\r\n  [49] A Royal decree had charged the Court of Peers with the duty\r\n  of trying the authors of the Republican insurrection which\r\n  occurred from April 7 to April 13, 1834, in several provincial\r\n  towns and in Paris. The sentences were not passed till December\r\n  1835 and January 1836.\r\n\r\n_Langenau (Switzerland), August 18, 1835._--This little chronicle has\r\nbeen interrupted for some time. I have often been ill, and found any\r\nkind of application impossible. In this way I became more and more\r\nindolent, and got tired of writing down my own thoughts after having\r\nso long dealt with those of others. Then came removals and travels and\r\nall sorts of things which have combined to interrupt my old habits. My\r\nmind has been distracted by too many new scenes; I have had no time\r\nfor the reflection and steady work necessary for writing, and my\r\ninspiration was at an end. I had lived prodigally for four years and\r\nmy small stock of provisions was exhausted. In short, I may repeat the\r\nrather unfilial remark of M. Cousin, who in speaking of his father,\r\nwho had become imbecile, observed, \"only the animal survives.\"\r\n\r\nMy notes have recorded in their proper sequence the visit of M. le Duc\r\nd'Orléans to Valençay, the drama (as I may well call it) of M. de\r\nTalleyrand's resignation of his Embassy to London; the change of\r\nMinistry at Paris, which only lasted three days; that of the English\r\nCabinet, which after three months retired on meeting a Parliament\r\nwhich they had imprudently renewed. How much these events displeased\r\nthose about me, how a many-sided intrigue made Sébastiani Ambassador\r\nat London, a post to which M. de Rigny secretly aspired--all this is\r\nwell known, and I shall say no more about it.\r\n\r\nAt Maintenon, where I spent some hours with the Duc de Noailles, I had\r\nthe pleasure of hearing a long account of the visit of Charles X. in\r\n1830, when he left Rambouillet to embark at Cherbourg. The Duc de\r\nNoailles describes this dramatic scene with emotion, and consequently\r\nwith talent. Unfortunately, I did not write it all down the very day\r\nhe told it me, and now I fear that I should spoil it if I tried to\r\nrecollect it. Some day or other I shall go to Maintenon again, and\r\ninstead of the story, which I shall not hear again, I shall be able to\r\ntell what has become of this venerable and curious old house in the\r\nhands of the Duc de Noailles, who has undertaken many improvements.\r\n\r\nOur quiet stay at Rochecotte might also have furnished several pages\r\nwhich would have contained the piquant anecdotes of M. de la\r\nBesnardière; the frequently agitated correspondence of Madame Adélaïde\r\nduring the re-entry last March of the doctrinaire Ministry, and some\r\ncharacteristic traits of M. de Talleyrand grappling with his\r\ncomparative solitude, almost continually trying to put other people in\r\nthe wrong in order to manufacture emotions for himself, sometimes\r\nputting himself in the wrong, and thus conducting a solitary warfare\r\nin the midst of a profound peace.\r\n\r\nI should have set down, during the days which Madame de Balbi spent\r\nwith me, some account of the many-sided vivacity which is so\r\ncharacteristic of her age and type of mind. Her conversation was full\r\nof it, and what she says is almost always connected with scenes and\r\npersons and situations which prevent it from being trivial and make it\r\nmaterial for serious history. If I had been in form at that time I\r\nshould certainly not have passed over in silence the loquacious and\r\npompous figure of the Comte Alexis de Saint-Priest, a malicious, and\r\nindeed a grotesque person, though not without wit and animation, and a\r\nstriking contrast to the restraint, good taste, and incisiveness of\r\nMadame de Balbi. M. de Saint-Priest's total want of manners is his\r\nmost unpleasant feature. He thinks he is a born diplomatist, but his\r\ntemperament is certainly anything but diplomatic. He is also a man of\r\nletters, and is writing historical memoirs, for which he thought\r\nhimself entitled to request Madame de Balbi, on the very first day\r\nthey met at Rochecotte, to communicate to him her letters from Louis\r\nXVIII., of which no doubt she must have a great many. This was too\r\nmuch not to cast a shade of gravity over Madame de Balbi's habitual\r\ngaiety; and she said, very drily, that she would be wanting in every\r\nsentiment of the respect and gratitude which she entertained towards\r\nthe late King if a single one of these letters was published or even\r\nshown to any one during her lifetime.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of June which I spent at Paris the King very\r\ngraciously showed us Versailles, which should have impelled me to\r\nrecord here the profound impression made upon me by the first plan and\r\nthe actual restoration. Fast as one forgets everything at Paris,\r\nVersailles remains dazzlingly clear in my recollection; all I feared\r\nwas to have too much to say. I doubt if I could have revisited the\r\nPalace under more curious circumstances. On one side was M. de\r\nTalleyrand who reconstructed for us the Versailles of Louis XV., Louis\r\nXVI. and the Constituent Assembly, and on the other King Louis\r\nPhilippe. In the middle of the hall of 1792 the King was carried back\r\nto the earliest memories of his youth and made them live again by his\r\nwords no less than by the fine portraits and interesting pictures he\r\nhas collected. I had visited Versailles in April 1812 with the Emperor\r\nNapoleon who then dreamed of establishing his court there, and had\r\ngone to inspect the works which he had put in hand and which first\r\nextricated the palace from the ruin and disorder caused by the\r\nRevolution. The second visit I paid to Versailles might well recall\r\nthe first! M. Fontaine, the clever architect, and I were the only\r\npeople who could compare both restorations.\r\n\r\n_Berne, August 19, 1835._--The month of June which I spent in Paris\r\nwas full of incident of all kinds. I am really ashamed that I have\r\nallowed the impressions of these to become so feeble that hardly a\r\ntrace remains. I assisted at several conversations between the King\r\nand Madame Adélaïde. There were the little intrigues of the\r\ndoctrinaires diffidently developing around me under the auspices of M.\r\nGuizot, in whom I have often remarked an easy hypocrisy which seems to\r\nme quite a new variety of charlatanism. All these, the alternations of\r\nexaltation and despondency through which M. Thiers kept passing, and a\r\nthousand other things which gave each day a character of its own,\r\nwould have been well worthy of a few notes. I should have said\r\nsomething of a dinner at the Villa Orsini given by M. Thiers, where a\r\nmotley collection of fifteen people gave the party a stamp of bad\r\ntaste which embarrassed me and made M. de Talleyrand observe, \"We have\r\nbeen to a Directoire dinner party.\"\r\n\r\nPersonal matters also have not been uninteresting. There was the death\r\nof young Marie Suchet and her mother's grief, the confirmation of my\r\ndaughter Pauline on the occasion of which I met the Archbishop of\r\nParis after five years of separation. All these events, so to speak,\r\nmarked out one day from another and kept them from being confused one\r\nwith another.\r\n\r\nI was the more struck with my interview with M. de Quélen, as it was\r\nthe occasion of a conversation which I do not wish to go unrecorded.\r\nThe Archbishop returned to a subject which has always much concerned\r\nhim, namely, the conversion of M. de Talleyrand, and spoke of it with\r\nthe same vivacity as in the days of M. le Cardinal de Périgord. He\r\nrepeated how eagerly he wished for this event, assured me that he had\r\ngladly accepted all the tribulations of his episcopal life in the hope\r\nthat God would vouchsafe as a recompense for his own sufferings the\r\nreturn of M. de Talleyrand into the bosom of the Church. He exhorted\r\nme vehemently to co-operate by my own efforts in so meritorious a\r\nwork, and added that, knowing how trustworthy I was, and, moreover,\r\nbelieving that it was well that I should know what he intended to do,\r\nhe would confide to me that he had thought that in the last phrase of\r\nM. de Talleyrand's letter of resignation of November 13 last there\r\nwas a return to serious thoughts, and that he had become convinced\r\nthat the moment had come to act energetically. He had therefore\r\nwritten straight to the Pope at Rome to inquire what line the Holy\r\nFather thought he should follow. \"The Holy Father's answer was not\r\nlong in coming,\" said M. de Quélen; \"it refers to M. de Talleyrand in\r\nkindly and affectionate terms. It gives me the right to absolve and\r\nreconcile him, and it extends my powers so far as to permit me to\r\ndelegate them to the prelates of the various dioceses in which M. de\r\nTalleyrand might be attacked by his last illness, in particular to the\r\nArchbishops of Bourges and Tours. Finally, the Pope even showed a\r\nwillingness to write personally to M. de Talleyrand.\" In my replies to\r\nM. de Quélen I necessarily temporised. I made it clear in the most\r\nprecise terms that any direct overture would probably produce an\r\neffect the very opposite of that which was desired. For my own part I\r\ncould never take other than a purely passive part in the matter.\r\nAssuredly I should be equally averse from any action contrary to the\r\nobject desired by the Church, as from any which might disturb one for\r\nwhose peace I am responsible, without securing the desired effect,\r\nwhich, if it ever is secured, will be due to a voice more mighty and\r\nmore powerful than any human one.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop also spoke to me of his own tribulations, of those he\r\nhas experienced since 1830; they have been both strange and sad. I\r\nregret that latterly he has not been able to forget them a little\r\nmore, and that when he returned to the Tuileries after the attempt of\r\nJuly 28,[50] and reopened Notre Dame to the King, he did not accompany\r\nwhat he did with more frank and more definitely pacific words. He\r\nwould then have avoided the reproach of speaking to two addresses, one\r\nat Prague, the other at Paris. The Archbishop's misfortune is that he\r\nhas not quite the intellectual grasp which is necessary to play the\r\ndifficult part which circumstances have imposed upon him. Neither has\r\nhe the intense energy which redeems, and sometimes more than redeems,\r\nintellectual shortcomings. No doubt his sentiments are excellent, and\r\nhis intentions admirable. He is kind, charitable, affectionate,\r\ngrateful, sincerely attached to his duties, and always ready to face\r\nmartyrdom, but he is too ready to receive impressions of every kind.\r\nIt is easy to gain his confidence and to abuse it by pushing him into\r\na path the end of which he does not perceive in time. He is afraid of\r\ncriticism and is always provoking it by a hesitancy and a want of\r\nbalance which arise from a vacillating intelligence, and the scruples\r\nof a conscience which is never certain whether what was good yesterday\r\nis good to-day. He would have been a good pastor in ordinary times;\r\nbut in our day, in which no one seems suited to the place he occupies,\r\nthe attitude he has taken up has made neither for his reputation with\r\nthe public nor the peace of his private life. However, as he has many\r\nnoble and good qualities, and as he has the deepest interest in all\r\nwho bear the name of Talleyrand, which is much to his credit as it\r\narises from gratitude to the Cardinal de Périgord, I wish with all my\r\nheart that his life may be made more tranquil than it has been in\r\nthese recent years, and that his troubles may come to an end. Another\r\nman might have known how to turn them to his advantage; he can do\r\nnothing but succumb.\r\n\r\n  [50] The crime of Fieschi who tried to assassinate King Louis\r\n  Philippe.\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed the four weeks which I have lately been spending at\r\nBaden-Baden. I found many old acquaintances and had some agreeable\r\nmeetings. There, too, I ought to have fixed my recollections by\r\nputting down a few lines about Madame la Princesse d'Orange, that\r\npattern of all that education should make a Princess, about the King\r\nof Würtemberg and his daughters the Princesses Sophie and Marie, about\r\nthe ill-concealed hostility of Mesdames de Lieven and de Nesselrode,\r\nabout the genial philosophy of M. de Falk, about the fine talk of M.\r\nand Madame de Zea, in fact about everything good and bad which struck\r\nme in this gathering, of which each member had a distinction of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThey all group themselves more or less about Madame de Lieven, whose\r\nformer glories and recent misfortune (the deaths of her two youngest\r\nsons in the same week), excited sympathy or imposed duties. I was very\r\nsorry for her, and her position seemed to me to contain a great\r\nlesson. She has lost her way and wanders at large. She is not\r\nresigned, and finds no pleasure in her regrets. She finds nothing but\r\na cruel void in the distraction which she demands of every one. She\r\nfinds no pleasure in occupation; she lives in the street, in public\r\nplaces, talks inconsequently, and never listens, laughs, cries and\r\nacts at a venture, asks questions without interest in the answers.\r\nThis misery is the worse, as four months of sorrow have not taught her\r\npatience. She is already astonished that her regrets have lasted so\r\nlong; but, as she will not submit herself to trouble, it will not wear\r\nitself out; she prolongs it by struggling against it. In the combat\r\nsorrow triumphs and the victim cries out, but the sound is discordant\r\nand awakes no sympathetic echo in the hearts of others. I have seen\r\npeople, one after another, cease to pity her and care for her: she saw\r\nit too and was humiliated. She seemed grateful to me for continuing to\r\nbe kind to her. She left me with the conviction that, if I had not\r\nbeen a consolation to her, I was at least a resource, and I am very\r\nglad of it.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to me to see the lovely Lake of Constance again a\r\nfew days ago. Three years ago I dreamed of taking a small château\r\nwhich was there. It has been burned down. I am now thinking of a\r\ncottage; I should be sorry not to have some shelter on this promontory\r\nfrom which the view is so rich, so varied, and so tranquil, and where\r\nit would be so pleasant to rest.\r\n\r\nFrom Wolfsberg where I lived I several times went to Arenenberg to see\r\nthe Duchesse de Saint-Leu; she seemed to me rather more tranquil than\r\nthree years ago. Madame Campan's pretentious pupil, the Tragedy Queen,\r\nhas given place to a good stout Swiss house-wife who talks with\r\nfreedom, receives hospitably, and is pleased to see any one who comes\r\nto divert her in her solitude. Her little house is picturesque, but\r\nintended only for summer weather, though she lives there almost all\r\nthe year round. The interior is small and narrow, and seems to have\r\nbeen made only for flowers, reeds, matting, and divans--it is in fact\r\nno more than a summer-house. The relics of imperial magnificence which\r\nare heaped together there are not altogether in keeping. Canova's\r\nmarble statue of the Empress Josephine requires a larger setting. I\r\nshould have liked with the stroke of an enchanter's wand to have\r\ntransported to the Versailles Museum the portrait of the Emperor as\r\nGeneral Bonaparte by Gros, which is certainly the finest modern\r\nportrait that I know. It ought to be the property of the nation, for\r\nthe military and political history as well as all the glories and\r\ndestinies of France are embodied in this perfect picture. In a little\r\ncabinet in a looking-glass case there are some precious relics mixed\r\nwith a number of insignificant trifles. The cashmere scarf worn by\r\nGeneral Bonaparte at the Battle of the Pyramids, the portrait of the\r\nEmpress Marie-Louise and her son on which the dying eyes of the exile\r\nof St. Helena were fixed, and several other interesting relics lie\r\nthere side by side with wretched little scarabs and a thousand\r\ntrifling things without interest or value. Thus an eyeglass left by\r\nthe Emperor Alexander at Malmaison, and a fan given by Citizen\r\nTalleyrand to Mlle. Hortense de Beauharnais, preserved in the midst of\r\nthe memories of the Empire, show great freedom of thought and a\r\ncertain amount of indifference, or else a remarkable facility of\r\nhumour and character.\r\n\r\nTrue I saw the Empress Josephine and Madame de Saint-Leu ask to be\r\nreceived by Louis XVIII. a fortnight after the fall of Napoleon. In\r\nLondon I saw Lucien Bonaparte make Lady Aldborough introduce him to\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, and at the Congress of Vienna Eugène de\r\nBeauharnais sang to oblige the company. Ancient dynasties may be\r\nwanting in ability; new ones are always lacking in dignity.\r\n\r\n_Fribourg, August 20, 1835._--It would be, if not dignified, at any\r\nrate well bred, on Madame de Saint-Leu's part if she restored to the\r\ntown of Aix-la-Chapelle the magnificent reliquary worn by Charlemagne,\r\nand found on his neck when his tomb was opened. This reliquary, which\r\ncontains a piece of the True Cross under a great sapphire, was given\r\nto the Empress Josephine by the Chapter of the Cathedral in order to\r\nconciliate her favour. It must have been a painful sacrifice for them\r\nto part with this relic, to which it would have been a piece of\r\ndelicacy and good breeding to put an end. What might be an appropriate\r\npossession for the successor of Charlemagne is a most unsuitable one\r\nfor the mistress of the Arenenberg.\r\n\r\nI have little to say of the journey which brought me here. Saint-Gall\r\nhas a charming situation. The interior of the town is very ugly; the\r\nchurch and the adjoining buildings, which are now the seat of the\r\nCantonal Government, have been restored too recently, and they missed\r\ntheir effect on me. Nothing recalls the strange glories of the ancient\r\nPrince Bishops of Saint-Gall. The nave of the church is fine, but\r\nthere is none of the calmness of antiquity in it. The bridge, which\r\nyou cross to reach the new road to Heinrichsbad, is a picturesque\r\nincident in a wooded country.\r\n\r\nHeinrichsbad is quite a new establishment; and the Alpine situation of\r\nthe isolated hotel affords opportunities for the goats'-milk cure. The\r\npart of Appenzell which we crossed on the way to Meynach reminded me\r\nmore of the Pyrenees than any other part of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to see the Lake of Zurich again; but the Lake of Zug,\r\nalong which I passed the next day, being more shaded and retired,\r\nseemed to me even more lovely. There is a view of almost all of it\r\nfrom the Convent of the Nuns of S. Francis, whose house is high above\r\nthe lake. I arrived as the ladies were saying Mass--not very well it\r\nmust be confessed, but the organ and voices which come from invisible\r\npersons and an unseen place always affect me too deeply to allow me to\r\nbe critical. The nuns are employed in the education of girls. Sister\r\nSeraphina, who showed me over the Convent, speaks French well, and her\r\ncell is extremely clean. The rule of the Convent did not seem to me\r\nvery strict.\r\n\r\nThe chapel of Kussnach--on the very spot where Gessler was killed by\r\nWilliam Tell, has some historic interest no doubt, but as regards\r\nsituation it is far inferior to that on the Lake of Four Cantons, at\r\nthe place where Tell leapt out of his persecutor's boat and pushed it\r\nback into the raging storm.\r\n\r\nThe position of Lucerne, which I knew, struck me again as very\r\npicturesque. The lion carved in the rock near Lucerne, after\r\nThorwaldsen's design, is an imposing monument--a fine thought well\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nBerne, which I reached by way of the Immersthal, a pleasant valley\r\ncovered with the most beautiful vegetation and ornamented with\r\ncharming villages, has the aspect of a great city, thanks to its\r\nnumerous fine streets and buildings. It is a melancholy place,\r\nhowever, and even in summer one feels how cold it must be in winter.\r\nThe terrace, which is planted with trees and hangs high above the Aar,\r\nopposite to the mountains and the glaciers of the Oberland, is a\r\nsplendid promenade, to which the Hôtel de la Monnaie on one side and\r\nthe Cathedral on the other make a fine finish.\r\n\r\nThe road from Berne to this place has no remarkable features. The\r\nfirst view of Fribourg is striking and uncommon. The site is rough and\r\nwild; the towers thrown on the surrounding heights, the depth at which\r\nthe river, or rather the torrent, flows at the foot of the rock on\r\nwhich the town is placed, and the hanging bridge above the houses, all\r\nmake the scene exceedingly picturesque. The interior of the town, with\r\nits numerous convents and its population of Jesuits in long black\r\nrobes and broad hats, is like a vast monastery, in which there is not\r\nwanting, on occasion, a faint flavour of the Inquisition. It is not in\r\nthis mysterious and cloistered place that one feels oneself drinking\r\nin the classic atmosphere of Helvetian liberty. The new Jesuit College\r\nis so placed as to dominate the town, and the influence due to its\r\nimportance is very great. To judge by the little which the traveller\r\nis permitted to see, this establishment is on the vastest scale and\r\nperfectly managed. There are three hundred and fifty children being\r\neducated there, most of them French; the buildings appear to me to be\r\nintended for an even larger number. Besides this great boarding-school\r\nthe Jesuits have their own house adjoining, and in addition a country\r\nplace about a league from the town.\r\n\r\nI went to see the Cathedral, which would be quite unworthy of notice\r\nwere it not for the organ which was playing as I entered and which\r\nseemed to me the most harmonious and the least harsh of any I have\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to have seen Fribourg. I passed through eleven years\r\nago without examining it. I now understand better the kind of part\r\nwhich this town plays in the religious history of the present time.\r\n\r\n_Lausanne, August 21, 1835._--The broad and easy road from Fribourg\r\ncrosses a country partly wooded, partly cultivated, smiling and varied\r\nbut not exactly picturesque, except at Lussan. The scenery does not\r\nbecome grand until the mountain chain which surrounds Lake Leman\r\nappears at the end of a pine wood, which for a long time conceals both\r\nthe lake and the town of Lausanne.\r\n\r\nLike all Swiss towns Lausanne is ugly inside. Its situation is\r\npicturesque; the variations of level are inconvenient for the\r\ninhabitants, but they provide several terraces from which the view is\r\nvery fine. Those at the Cathedral and the Castle are the most thought\r\nof. I prefer the Montbadon promenade which is not so high, but from\r\nwhich one can see the country better. There are too many roofs in the\r\nother views.\r\n\r\n_Bex, August 23, 1835._--Less of wall and vineyard and a few more\r\ntrees would make the road from Lausanne to Vevey charming. The country\r\ndoes not quite take my fancy until Vevey is reached. Chillon above all\r\nimpressed me by its situation and its associations. I should like to\r\nhave re-read Lord Byron's verses while I was going over the famous\r\ndungeons. His name alone which is scrawled in charcoal on one of the\r\npillars of the prison (the same to which François de Bonnivard was\r\nchained for six years), is enough to make this dungeon poetic.\r\n\r\nAt Villeneuve the road leaves Lake Leman and plunges into a wild and\r\nnarrow gorge. The sharp and curious indentations of the rocks which\r\nflank the road supply the only beauty which adorns the four long\r\nleagues to Bex. Quite near, on a spur of rock veined with many\r\ncolours, and half hidden in a clump of trees, you can see the Castle\r\nof St. Triphon, which seemed to me very fine.\r\n\r\nBex itself is a village which bears no resemblance to the pretty\r\nvillages of the Canton of Berne. Everything already suggests the\r\nneighbourhood of Piedmont. We are all at the Auberge de l'Union which\r\nis the only one in the place and is neither good nor bad. The sulphur\r\nbaths established here did not succeed; neither did the goat's milk\r\ncure. In fact the place is bare of resources and very sombre and dull,\r\nthough for me it is lighted up by the rosy cheeks of Pauline and the\r\nbrightness of her blue eyes. I was delighted to get here.\r\n\r\nI got a letter on my arrival which had been left for me by Admiral de\r\nRigny on his way to Naples. He tells me that he has found everywhere\r\non his way a definite belief that the Duchesse de Berry was at\r\nChambéry on the 24th, and that on the 30th, Berryer who was going to\r\ntake the waters at Aix-en-Savoie disappeared a few hours after the\r\nattempt on the King's life in Paris, and afterwards reappeared at Aix\r\nmuch upset. Like M. de Rigny I have found this version of the story\r\ncurrent everywhere. The Swiss papers also describe Madame la Duchesse\r\nde Berry, but nothing is certain.\r\n\r\nAt Maintenon the Duc de Noailles has just been having a party of\r\nclever and intriguing people. M. de Chateaubriand, Madame Récamier,\r\nthe Vicomtesse de Noailles, M. Ampère, in fact the whole morning\r\ncongregation of the Abbaye-aux-Bois.[51] I am sorry to hear it: the\r\nDuc de Noailles should not forsake the high road for such a byway.\r\n\r\n  [51] The Abbaye-aux-Bois was a religious community of women; it\r\n  was situated in Paris at the corner of the Rue de Sèvres and the\r\n  Rue de la Chaise. During the Revolution it was used as a place of\r\n  detention. Later it reverted to its former character, and,\r\n  besides the convent occupied solely by the nuns, it afforded a\r\n  peaceable refuge to ladies of great fashion. Madame Récamier\r\n  settled there.\r\n\r\nFrom what I hear from Touraine I see that the atrocity at Paris of\r\nthe 28th July,[52] has aroused indignation there, an indignation,\r\nhowever, which feared to speak above its breath and which is perhaps\r\neven now forgotten. We live in a time when so many monstrosities are\r\nproduced on the stage, when books are so full of them, and when they\r\nare so common in real life that the public have supped full with\r\nhorrors and have become indifferent to them and quite familiarised\r\nwith crime. The town of Tours, a place so essentially calm, has\r\ndistinguished itself by refusing to send addresses from the Tribunal,\r\nthe Conseil Municipal and the Conseil d'Arrondissement. Two rogues,\r\nglibly arguing about the letter of the law, were enough to set all the\r\nindifferent at their ease. It appears however that a creditable number\r\nof the Garde Nationale showed themselves the day of the funeral\r\nservice and sent an address with some show of cordiality. When one\r\nsees the most violent and criminal passions on the one side and on the\r\nother an exhibition of laziness and indifference, one wonders whether\r\nthe repressive laws asked for by the French Ministry will be enough.\r\nPerhaps they will only irritate!\r\n\r\n  [52] Fieschi's attempt on the King's life.\r\n\r\nThis is an evil age of ours; good centuries are rare but there is no\r\nexample of one that is worse than this. I pity with all my heart those\r\nwho are called upon to govern it, M. Thiers, for example, whose\r\nweariness and anxiety appear in a letter which I received from him\r\nyesterday from which I give an extract. After speaking of the personal\r\ndanger from which he escaped at the time of the attempt of July 28, he\r\nadds, \"But my only trouble, and it is overwhelming, is the immense\r\nresponsibility of my position. I am on my feet day and night. I go\r\nfrom the Prefecture of Police to the Tuileries, to the Chamber,\r\nwithout a moment's rest, and without being sure that I have foreseen\r\neverything, for the fertility of evil is infinite, as is the case in\r\nevery disordered society in which every criminal has formed a hope\r\nthat he may attain anything by setting the world on fire. There are\r\nsome scoundrels who would blow up this planet if they were allowed. On\r\nthe day after the horrible massacre all that occurred to them to say\r\nwas 'we shall see:' these are the very words of the leader of the\r\nassassins. I know not when I shall have the rest which will be the\r\nreward of these troubles, nor what issue out of my affliction will be\r\nvouchsafed to me.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the explosion of the infernal machine, when she\r\nlearned that her husband and children had not perished, our good Queen\r\nsaid, \"How did my sons behave?\" an inquiry which I think was worthy of\r\nher. The young Princes behaved with touching devotion. They gathered\r\nclosely round the King, and the next day, when traces of a bullet were\r\ndiscovered on the King's forehead, the Duc d'Orléans said, \"And yet I\r\nmade myself as tall as I could yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Madame Récamier is at Maintenon with the Duchesse de Noailles,\r\nmy sister-in-law, the Princesse de Poix, goes to the Duchesse\r\nd'Abrantès' Mondays where one meets Madame Victor Hugo! Wit and\r\npolitics have strangely intermingled all society, good and bad!\r\n\r\nM. le Duc de Nemours is going to London. He is nice-looking,\r\ndignified, serious and reserved, with a great air of youth and\r\nnobility. One would expect him to have a great success in England, but\r\nhis excessive shyness so completely deprives him of all ease and grace\r\nin conversation that he will perhaps be rated at much less than his\r\nreal value.\r\n\r\nOf all the congratulatory letters written to the King of the French by\r\nforeign sovereigns on the occasion of the attempt of July 28, the most\r\ncordial was that of the King of the Netherlands. This seems to me very\r\ngood taste on his part, and I am very glad of it. I have always\r\nthought that since his misfortunes the King of the Netherlands has\r\nshown ability, readiness, and a persistency which, whatever his\r\nultimate success, will assure him a fine page in the history of our\r\ntime in which there is so little that is good to say about anybody.\r\n\r\nWhile the King of the French submits to escorts and measures of\r\nprecaution, and is adopting a more Royal state, the President of his\r\nCouncil comes to diplomatic dinners at the Tuileries in coloured\r\ntrousers and without decorations, and this Minister is the Duc de\r\nBroglie!\r\n\r\nJerome Bonaparte and all his family have left Florence and are now at\r\nVevey; the cholera is driving every one out of Italy into Switzerland.\r\n\r\n_Bex, August 24, 1835._--The weather having cleared, we have been to\r\nsee the salt mines near Bex, which are the only ones in Switzerland,\r\nand do not produce enough to supply the needs of the country. We did\r\nnot go far into the mine because of the damp cold which we felt\r\ngaining on us, but we saw the refining plant in detail. The salt\r\nseemed to me very pure and white.\r\n\r\nWe returned through the valley of Cretet along the mountain stream of\r\nDavanson, which is the fullest and the most impetuous I have seen in\r\nthis part of the Alps. Its course is long and its descent extremely\r\nrapid. It is caught in a narrow gorge, the sides of which are high and\r\nwooded. It supplies motive power for many factories, and for this\r\npurpose is divided into many little canals and aqueducts. These\r\nestablishments are nearly always hung, as it were, on blocks of rock\r\nwhich seem to have become detached from the high peaks and to be\r\nsuspended by a miracle over the abyss. All the road as far as M. de\r\nGautard's little château is delightful, and I was somewhat reconciled\r\nto the country, the first sight of which was a disagreeable surprise.\r\n\r\nI am just come back from a very interesting excursion. The chief\r\nobject was the cascade of Pisse-Vache, a fine straight foam-white\r\ncolumn of water which throws far and wide on all sides a damp mist,\r\nand leaps in a single jet from a breach in rocks rising into two\r\nneedle-like peaks. The water of the cascade soon mingles with that of\r\nthe Rhone, near the bridge where one crosses the river. The current is\r\nalmost equally rapid from the source to the mouth and is particularly\r\nso in the narrow gorge through which it passes on leaving the Valais\r\nto enter the Canton de Vaud. The frontier is at Saint Maurice, a\r\npicturesque village, where the convents, the castle, the old town and\r\nthe fortifications, lying unevenly on the perpendicular rocks, present\r\na quaint spectacle. The gate of this town is, so to speak, formed by\r\nthe narrow passage between two great rocks which separate the two\r\ncantons. From this point on the right the view reaches to the Canton\r\nde Vaud, ending in the distance beyond Lake Leman at the Jura, and on\r\nthe left towards the wilderness of the Valais you can see as far as\r\nthe snowy chain of Saint Bernard.\r\n\r\nWhat, in spite of everything, spoiled the expedition for me was the\r\ncharacter of the population. Crétins are numerous, and even those who\r\nare not so afflicted are horribly disfigured by goîtres. The women\r\nsometimes have as many as three. The water coming from melted snow,\r\nand the deficiency of sunlight, which penetrates very little into the\r\nnarrow gorges of the Valais, are responsible for the frequency of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n_Geneva, August 26, 1835._--We left Bex this morning and went along\r\nthe Rhone to the point at which it enters Lake Leman. Thence to Thonon\r\nby a pleasant road boldly tunnelled in the rock and built out over the\r\nlake. The view was a picturesque mixture of superb lawns, lovely\r\nchestnut trees and majestic rocks, which form a very fine spectacle.\r\nFrom Thonon the road is monotonous until within two leagues from\r\nGeneva. There the natural beauty of the country is enhanced by\r\nnumerous ornamental gardens cared for as well as they are in England,\r\nby pretty country houses and magnificent avenues, the whole being\r\ngrouped like the town of Geneva itself in an amphitheatre round the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nWe are at the Hotel des Bergues. My window looks out on a new wire\r\nbridge which spans the Rhone and joins the two parts of the town,\r\nleading at the same time to a small island on which is the statue of\r\nJean-Jacques Rousseau surrounded by a clump of great trees. A great\r\npart of the lake is simply covered with little boats; nothing could be\r\ngayer or more animated.\r\n\r\n_Geneva, August 27, 1835._--The Duc de Périgord whom I met yesterday\r\nhere, and who is a good authority about everything that concerns the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, explained to me as follows the _rapprochement_\r\nof the Archbishop with the present Government. After the attempt\r\nof July 28, the Curé of Saint Roch, whose church has become the\r\nplace of worship of the Royal Family since the destruction of\r\nSaint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, went to the King, who intimated to him his\r\nintentions as to the funeral service. The Curé, whose name is the Abbé\r\nOlivier, observed that after the funeral service a _Te Deum_ in\r\nthanksgiving for the preservation of the King and his children would\r\nbe an obvious and proper ceremony. The King adopted this idea adding:\r\n\"This _Te Deum_ will have to take place at Saint-Roch as the\r\nArchbishop continues to oppose my Government.\" The Curé of Saint-Roch\r\nimmediately informed the Archbishop of the innovation which his\r\nattitude was about to cause, and it was this which made M. de Quélen\r\ndecide to go to the King. He was received and thereafter officiated at\r\nthe Invalides and at Notre-Dame. I shall hear later what passed\r\nbetween the King and him.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that Marshal Maison, who takes no part in the\r\ndebates in the Chamber, takes out every day in a phaeton, at the\r\nfashionable hour, a young lady whom he has brought back from St.\r\nPetersburg. He is the dandy of the Cabinet!\r\n\r\n_Geneva, August 29, 1835._--The environs of Geneva have improved as\r\nmuch as the interior of the town. Every year new country houses\r\nreplace and augment the number of those which used to cover the coasts\r\nof the lake. The most elaborate belongs to a banker named Bartholony.\r\nThe Italian taste predominates in the construction of these villas;\r\nthe gardens and the arrangement of the flowers recall England. The\r\nframe of the picture alone is Swiss and it could not be more\r\ngrandiose. Coppet, which is further from Geneva, has no particular\r\nstyle. It is now occupied by the young Madame de Staël who lives there\r\nin all the austerity of early Christian widowhood, and it has a\r\ndeserted and lugubrious air. The village separates the château from\r\nthe lake and blocks the view. M. and Madame Necker and the famous\r\nMadame de Staël are buried in a part of the park shut off by brushwood\r\nand very difficult to approach. Moreover, by the orders of the dead,\r\nno one (not even their children) is allowed to enter this enclosure.\r\nThe rest of the Park is full of fine trees which, however, are too\r\nclose together. They are wanting in style and neatness like the\r\ngeneral impression produced by the whole place. Strangers are no\r\nlonger admitted to the house. I had been there on a former occasion.\r\nThe apartments are well arranged and well enough proportioned, but\r\nthey are furnished without taste or elegance. It is in every way an\r\nestablishment characteristic of a Puritan banker, vast and austere but\r\nneither noble nor imposing.\r\n\r\nThe position of Ferney is very agreeable; the house is embellished by\r\nterraces and vegetation. In itself it is small and all on the old\r\nFrench model of last century. The salon and bedchamber of M. de\r\nVoltaire alone remain open to the public and consecrated to the memory\r\nof the great mind who, during thirty years made this little manor the\r\nfire from whence issued so many dazzling flames of wit. We stayed a\r\nlong time examining the little relics preserved by the gardener. When\r\nM. de Voltaire died he was fourteen; he recites his story well, for I\r\ndo not believe that it is his own.\r\n\r\nIn a letter I had yesterday from the Duc d'Orléans occurs the\r\nfollowing passage: \"On the day on which the laws under discussion are\r\nvoted, and this dangerous weapon is placed in the hands of the\r\nexecutive, the difficulty will begin. It is nothing to have got them\r\nthrough, the trouble is to carry them into execution. Will they be\r\nable to carry on this unceasing struggle? Will they be able each day\r\nto defeat the stratagems, and to resist the tenacious purpose of men\r\nwho are driven to desperation and have only one thought and one end?\r\nHostile critics here assert that it is much more difficult to govern\r\nregularly and coherently than to carry new laws by violent speeches\r\nwhile not even enforcing those which are already provided. For my part\r\nall I say is that, now Ministers have involved us in so grave a\r\nstruggle, I can find no words with which to describe their conduct if\r\nthey do not make a proper use of the powers which they have thought it\r\ntheir duty to demand, or if they try to transfer to others the burden\r\nof executing what they alone have conceived and insisted on in what\r\nthey believe to be their own interests.\"\r\n\r\n_Lons-le-Saulnier, August 31, 1835._--I got here last night very late,\r\nafter having traversed the wild, melancholy and arid Jura. Great\r\nefforts have been used there to create an easy road, on which however\r\nyou get on slowly owing to the constant ascents and descents. The\r\nroads themselves, cut out of the living rock and protected by\r\nencasements skilfully contrived so as to prevent infiltration of\r\nwater, are perfectly smooth, wide and well protected against the\r\ndangers of this rugged country. From the heights of Saint Cergue I\r\ncast a last look at the lovely lake of Geneva and the Alps. The view\r\nstretches out magnificently before one and leaves a fine image in\r\none's memory.\r\n\r\n_Arlay, September 1, 1835._--This place, which was part of the ancient\r\nduchy of Isenghien, came to Prince Pierre d'Arenberg from his maternal\r\ngrandmother, the heiress of the house of Isenghien, which descended\r\nfrom those of Châlons and Orange. The nobility of such an origin is\r\nunquestionable, and is much in the mind of the present owner. The view\r\nfrom my room, and in fact from all parts of the house, is wide without\r\nbeing picturesque; and in this it is like the house itself, which is\r\nvast and well restored, but rather bare of furniture and rather\r\nchilly, as the ridge above it comes between it and the south.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of this ridge there are the ruins of the Gothic manor,\r\nwhich have not character enough to be interesting. The approaches are\r\nshort, there being no other avenue than a courtyard planted with\r\ntrees. There are many things wanting which are necessary to make it\r\nagreeable and effective, but it is a substantial piece of wreckage\r\nsaved from the revolutionary catastrophe. The master of the house and\r\nthe Duchesse de Périgord received me with the utmost kindness.\r\n\r\nI received here a letter from M. Royer-Collard, who was returning to\r\nhis country house \"after having done what he believed to be his duty\r\nand due to his honour in the Chamber,\" and without waiting for the\r\nvote on the law as a whole. His speech, the thought, sentiment and\r\nlanguage of which I admire (he did not intend it to create a sensation\r\nor to carry people away), was made to satisfy the demands of his\r\nconscience. He also wished to make his position quite clear (a long\r\nsilence had made some people uncertain about it) and to lay down\r\nclearly the line of his opinions. This is why, though far from well,\r\nhe made this speech which is so short and yet so full of matter. It is\r\nthe first time that, without exciting any murmuring or appearing\r\nridiculous, hypocritical or imprudent, any one has praised, honoured,\r\nand defended the peers, and that the spirit of religion, the words God\r\nand Providence, have been heard in the precincts of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. The respect with which such words were heard seemed to me,\r\nmore than anything else, to place M. Royer-Collard apart in the\r\nexalted regions to which he naturally belongs.\r\n\r\nThe man in whose pay Fieschi seems to have been, and whose name is\r\nPépin, has at last been arrested. It was a great triumph, but--he has\r\nescaped! A few hours after his arrest, following an order of the\r\nCourt, this Pépin had been taken to his house from the Conciergerie\r\nwhere he was confined in order that a search might be made in his\r\npresence. He was taken by a Commissaire de Police and two men only,\r\nand the moment he got home he disappeared! It is extraordinary that a\r\nman whose arrest and safe keeping were so important should be\r\nentrusted _at midnight_ to the care of two guards, that he should not\r\nhave been handcuffed, and that he should have been taken to his own\r\nhouse from which he no doubt knew of exits unknown to those in charge\r\nof him! It seems that since the affair of June 6, 1832,[53] in which\r\nPépin was implicated, his house has been so arranged as to furnish him\r\nwith means of escape. The Juge d'Instruction who allowed Pépin to\r\nescape by not having him properly guarded is called Legonidec; he is a\r\nyoung Judge of the Paris Cour d'Assises. Some people think he will be\r\nseriously compromised by the carelessness (if it is no worse) with\r\nwhich he has treated this very important matter.\r\n\r\n  [53] The burial of General Lamarque, who died of cholera on June\r\n  2, 1832, took place on June 5, and was the occasion of a revolt\r\n  which continued all day on the 6th.\r\n\r\nThey took me to see the ruins of the old castle, which are more\r\nextensive and important than I thought when I came. It was an\r\nimportant fortress in its day and was dismantled by the orders of\r\nLouis XI. in the time of the wars against Burgundy.\r\n\r\n_Dijon, September 3, 1835._--I left Arlay this morning with grateful\r\nmemories of the kindness with which Pauline and I were received. The\r\nPrincesse d'Arenberg became a special friend of mine; her politeness,\r\nher kindness and simplicity, combined with much good sense and good\r\nmanners, her education and talents, and her power of making good use\r\nof all these, assure this young woman a distinguished position among\r\nthose of her age and rank of whom very few in my opinion are her\r\nequals.\r\n\r\nI went by the new road which goes by Saint Jean-de-Losne and is much\r\nshorter. The road is good and easy, but the country it crosses--rich\r\nno doubt and well cultivated--has no special beauty or even interest\r\napart from its many châteaux and the Burgundian canal which is finely\r\nshaded by poplars.\r\n\r\nPierres, the château of M. de Thiard, is the most important of those\r\non the road. It seemed to me large and the surroundings of it are\r\nsplendid, but its situation is not pleasant. It is a pity they are\r\npulling down the castle of Seurre on the bank of the Saône. It seemed\r\nto me to be well placed. Toiran, La Bretonnière, and some others show\r\nthat the province is well inhabited.\r\n\r\nI regret having arrived too late to see Dijon. It is a fine town with\r\nsplendid buildings. The streets are animated. The park, an excellent\r\npublic promenade about a quarter of a league from the town and\r\nconnected with it by long avenues, must be a source of great pleasure\r\nto the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n_Tonnerre, September 4, 1835._--The road from Dijon to Montbard is\r\nbare and flat and fatiguing to the eye. Montbard is an old feudal\r\ncastle of the Dukes of Burgundy situated on a considerable eminence.\r\nIt was presented by Louis XV. to M. de Buffon, who already possessed\r\nat the foot of the hill a rather large and melancholy house in one of\r\nthe streets of the little town. He continued to live in this house\r\nwhich has nothing interesting in it except a fairly good portrait of\r\nthe celebrated owner. He demolished four of the five surviving towers\r\non the walls of the old château. The one he left still survives, as\r\nwell as the enormous outside wall which now encloses nothing but a\r\n\"quincunx\" of fine trees planted by M. de Buffon, from which fine\r\nalleys lead to his house below. The trees make a delightful shady\r\npromenade. At the top of the grove there is a little house containing\r\na single room in which M. de Buffon used to establish himself for\r\nseveral hours every day in order to work uninterruptedly. He had a\r\nchurch built on part of the foundations of the fortress, and is buried\r\nthere. M. de Buffon's house is occupied by his daughter-in-law, a\r\nwidow with no children.\r\n\r\nThe country becomes more varied as one approaches Ancy-le-Franc, a\r\ngreat and noble château built in the sixteenth century by Madame de\r\nClermont-Tonnerre and afterwards bought by the celebrated Louvois, to\r\none of whose descendants it still belongs. This château is perfectly\r\nregular in form; it consists of four buildings joined at each corner\r\nby a square tower. There is no principal staircase; each tower has its\r\nown--a very narrow one. The bedrooms are well proportioned and well\r\nfurnished, but the public rooms are ill-arranged. They are small,\r\nespecially the salon, in which the heavy gilding seems to add to the\r\neffect of smallness. Some ancient ceilings with panelling to match\r\ngive some of the rooms a Gothic character, which is interesting. The\r\nwindows are few and narrow, and the courtyard small and sombre. The\r\ncastle is entirely surrounded by a vast and well planted park. The\r\nwater is ugly and muddy and I saw neither glass-houses nor flowers,\r\nthough the offices are considerable. The high road crosses the\r\nfore-court a few yards from the house, which I think is carrying the\r\nprinciple of accessibility a trifle too far.\r\n\r\nWhat pleases me least is the situation of this abode. It lies at the\r\nbottom of a valley and lacks light, air, and a view. The English word\r\n\"gloomy\" seems made for Ancy-le-Franc. The chapel is fine, and it is\r\nneedless to say that there is a theatre. How could the M. Louvois of\r\nto-day do without one?\r\n\r\nI had often heard Ancy-le-Franc and Valençay mentioned as the two most\r\nconsiderable and remarkable châteaux in France. I cannot admit that\r\nthere is any comparison. Valençay is much more imposing, and at the\r\nsame time cheerful to live in. Its situation is picturesque and\r\nhealthy: it is much richer in architectural ornament, and its finest\r\npart, which dates from the fifteenth century, is a hundred years older\r\nthan Ancy-le-Franc, and in the purest Renaissance style.\r\n\r\nIt has just occurred to me that I saw no library in M. Louvois' house.\r\nI am sorry I did not mention it to the _concierge_, who seemed,\r\nhowever, to be conscientiously showing us all there was to be seen.\r\n\r\nI prefer not only Valençay to Ancy-le-Franc, but, apart from\r\ntradition, even Chenonceaux, and I should prefer Ussé also if it were\r\nput in order and furnished.\r\n\r\n_Melun, September 6, 1835._--The banks of the Yonne are pleasant\r\nenough, and are a welcome rest after the melancholy road from Dijon.\r\nIt is a pity, however, that the vegetation is, so to speak,\r\nfactitious. Up to Sens I saw no other trees than poplars planted in\r\nquincunxes or in avenues. This in the end becomes exceedingly\r\nmonotonous, and gives a stiff and artificial look to the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral at Sens is fine, and its proportions elegant. Two\r\nsculptures attract particular attention, the Mausoleum of the Dauphin\r\nfather of Louis XVI., and the altar of Saint Leu, on which this good\r\nBishop of Sens is represented undergoing his martyrdom, which, as a\r\nmatter of fact, took place at Sens itself. The group is in white\r\nmarble, and very effective. I think the general effect of the\r\nDauphin's mausoleum is heavy. The composition lacks simplicity, but\r\nsome of the parts are fine. The Treasury of the Cathedral is not only\r\nvery rich in relics whose authenticity is beyond question, but also in\r\nantiquities, which interested me because they bore the stamp of being\r\ngenuine. Thus I saw the Episcopal throne of Saint Leu, his pastoral\r\nring, his mitre, the pastoral ring of Gregory VII., the comb used by\r\nSaint Leu at ordinations, vestments used by Thomas Becket, who, as I\r\nlately read in Lingard, had taken refuge on the Continent when first\r\npersecuted, and had resided chiefly in France. These vestments are\r\nlocked up with great care in an iron case. There is a fine crucifix by\r\nGirardon, which is worth seeing.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from the Princesse de Lieven at Baden, dated August 29,\r\nwhich reached me at Sens, the following passage occurs: \"We have\r\nstrange news from England. Will Ministers really have the courage to\r\ncarry out their threats against the Lords? Will the latter give way\r\nbefore these threats? I doubt it; but the collision so long postponed\r\nis coming at last. In France all is going well. M. de Broglie's speech\r\nis splendid. Lord William Russell is always saying 'Our alliance is at\r\nan end.' As France is repudiating revolutionary principles and England\r\nis going more and more in that direction, there is no basis of\r\nagreement. The alliance was one of principles, and as the principles\r\nare no longer identical the alliance is dead.\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 7, 1835._--It is always a great event for me to get\r\nback to Paris where I have had so many bad moments. All my past\r\nunrolls itself before me as I pass through these streets and squares,\r\nwhich awake so many memories, almost all of them painful.\r\n\r\nAs we passed along the boulevards I glanced with a shudder at the\r\nhouse from which Fieschi committed his crime. It is quite small and of\r\na mean appearance. The too celebrated window is boarded up. In a year\r\nor two perhaps this house will be demolished, and I shall be sorry.\r\nThey will no doubt build some memorial on the site, which will\r\ndisappear in its turn with the first turn of the political\r\nweathercock, and will, in any case, be much less impressive than would\r\nbe the preservation of the scene of the atrocity exactly as it is. If\r\nit were preserved it would assist tradition; every one knows the\r\nhistory of the event, and may find a lesson in it. The Rue de la\r\nFerronnerie still exists. They pulled down the Opera house in which\r\nthe Duc de Berry was assassinated only to demolish thereafter the\r\nchapel which was built in its place. And yet the chapel from which\r\nCharles IX. shot his subjects is still there, always pointed out,\r\nalways referred to. Why should the crimes of monarchs be made manifest\r\nand those of peoples remain concealed?\r\n\r\nI shall give some extracts from the letters from M. de Talleyrand\r\nwhich awaited me at Paris: \"In the Ministry here you will find more\r\npoliteness than friendship. To be intimate with M. Royer-Collard and\r\nnot to have prevented him speaking against the press law is too bad!\r\nThat is our real crime. Even Thiers has not been here for two days. I\r\nam not sorry, as I should have told him very plainly that I thought\r\nthe articles in the _Journal de Paris_ which he writes or inspires\r\nvery improper, and that he should have so much respect for M.\r\nRoyer-Collard as at least to keep silent. The confidence of the\r\nTuileries is also one of the causes of the Ministerial coolness....\r\nThiers has lost a great deal at the recent sittings of the Chamber. To\r\nappear in the tribune with a copy of the _National_ dating from before\r\n1830 in order to prove that one did not say so and so, is to rate\r\noneself very low! Men who have not been properly educated to begin\r\nwith grow up with great difficulty; they lose their heads whenever\r\nthey are contradicted.... You cannot too highly praise M. de Broglie's\r\nspeech; all the incense bearers in Paris have passed through his\r\nsalon.... The affair of the escape of Pépin has much diminished the\r\nstability of the Ministry, which has shown itself so incompetent to\r\ndeal with a serious situation. People say, 'If the Government doesn't\r\nserve the King better than that what have we to rely upon?' Thiers,\r\ninstead of using his ability to consolidate his position, has used it\r\nto produce an impression of mere cleverness. He came badly out of\r\nthese sittings. In the first place, he was beaten on an amendment of\r\nFirmin Didot's, then he brought his claims as a journalist into the\r\ntribune which produced a bad effect everywhere. And yet he is the best\r\nthe Ministry have got, because he has humanity behind all his\r\ncleverness; he loves his friends, he is a good creature (in the best\r\nsense of the term), but he requires to have good people about him, and\r\nthose he has are the reverse.... Do not forget that espionage in the\r\nChamber, in the streets, and in letters is pushed to the utmost\r\nlengths.... The King, the Queen, and Madame Adélaïde look forward to\r\nseeing you among the greatest of their consolations. They need\r\nconsolation, for I assure you they are very unhappy. The Guizots and\r\nthe Broglies will perhaps talk to you of my coldness; you can say to\r\nthem that the coldness is not on my side. It did not come from me, but\r\nfrom them.\"\r\n\r\nHere now is an extract from a letter from Madame de Lieven, dated\r\nBaden, September 2: \"I have reason to believe, from a few lines I have\r\nfrom England, that there is an understanding between Peel and Lord\r\nGrey. The quarrel of the two Houses will be adjusted, I understand\r\nfrom Lady Cowper. They think very well of M. le Duc de Nemours in\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 8, 1835._--M. Thiers is aged and ill; his illness is\r\nnothing but fatigue and exhaustion, but what a life! He is angry with\r\nhis colleagues for grudging him the days of rest for which he asks,\r\nand roundly accuses them of cowardice for shrinking from assuming for\r\nthree weeks a responsibility which burdens him all the year. But what\r\na responsibility it is to preserve the King from the daggers of\r\nassassins! Every day there is a new conspiracy; to defeat them all is\r\na superhuman task.\r\n\r\nUp till now Fieschi's crime has not been connected with anything of\r\nimportance. There are a few obscure public-house accomplices and that\r\nis all; the Ministry cannot find anything bigger. M. Thiers even goes\r\nso far as to think it the most ominous feature of the case that such\r\nan atrocity should be the fruit not of fanaticism or intense passion,\r\nor even of some deep laid political conspiracy, but simply the product\r\nof the licence and anarchy which dominate the public mind.\r\n\r\nFieschi, being pressed by a doctor to declare the motive which led him\r\nto commit the crime, replied, \"I did it as a boy lets off a cracker.\"\r\nHideous frivolity! He asserts that all the clubs and secret societies,\r\nCarlist and others, were informed that on July 28 an attempt would be\r\nmade to kill the King. Fieschi had relations with some ruffians of his\r\nown stamp; these talked to their friends, and thus a vague rumour\r\nspread and even reached the Government. No details however were given,\r\nno proper names, nothing precise. As for Fieschi himself, he is simply\r\nan Italian bravo, who is always ready to set his hand to a crime even\r\nthough the reward is not great.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, who had to break the news to the Queen, told me that she\r\nwas seized with an attack of nerves, that Madame Adélaïde was in\r\ndespair, and yet so angry that she lost all self-control and literally\r\ndid not know what she was doing. As for Madame de Broglie, who was\r\nalso at the Chancellerie at the Place Vendôme with the Queen, she was\r\nmuch affected, but had her emotion under control. On this occasion M.\r\nGuizot told me that he felt inclined to compare Madame de Broglie's\r\nsoul to a great desert in which there are beautiful oases. There are\r\nmany gaps in her nature, and yet much force and power.\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 9, 1835._--The absurdities of Sébastiani are talked\r\nof even in the cabinet of Madame Adélaïde; and they seem in fact to\r\npass all bounds. He is much laughed at in London, which he does not\r\nlike at all. He says, in his dogmatic and paralytic way, \"English\r\nsociety gives me indigestion.\" As for his wife, her silliness and\r\nsimplicity have become proverbial. They entertain very little, and no\r\none comes near them; Lord Palmerston alone, in order to mark the\r\ncontrast with the insolence with which he honoured M. de Talleyrand,\r\nis constantly paying little attentions to the General. He is always\r\ncoming to see him, and is most careful to keep him supplied with all\r\nthe news.\r\n\r\nThe English Legion raised by General Alava has just been beaten in\r\nSpain. The abominable _canaille_ he recruited turned and fled at once.\r\n\r\nThe compromise between the two Houses in England has taken place; it\r\nis a truce until next Session.\r\n\r\nI have seen the King, who gave me his account of July 28. It is a very\r\ncurious thing that on the evening before he had told his Ministers\r\nthat they would shoot at him from a window, that being the surest\r\nmethod of assassination. M. Thiers and General Athalin feared an\r\nattack at close quarters, and wished the King to take precautions\r\nagainst this, but he absolutely refused to do so as being useless. The\r\nKing's advisers partly adopted his Majesty's view, but said they\r\nthought the attempt, if made at all, would be made in a narrow street.\r\nThe King, on the other hand, maintained that they were wrong, and that\r\nthe attempt would be made on the Boulevard because of the trees, which\r\nwould afford better cover for the assassin. The King's predictions all\r\ncame true. He told me that the most cruel moment in his life--which\r\nhas certainly not been without incident--was when the order of the\r\nreview brought him back after half an hour to the scene of the crime,\r\nand he was forced to pass through pools of blood and among the dead\r\nand wounded, amid the cries and lamentations of the people who had\r\nbeen torn to pieces because of him. When he rejoined his family he\r\nburst into tears, and his first words were, \"Poor Marshal Mortier is\r\ndead.\" No one could have been more self-forgetful, more simply\r\ncourageous, and yet more moved by the misfortunes of others. His\r\nconduct was really admirable, as is unanimously admitted.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia did not write personally, but contented himself\r\nwith sending condolences by a _chargé d'affaires_. This is all the\r\nworse, as he wrote a letter with his own hand to the widow of the Duc\r\nde Trévise, who had been Ambassador at St. Petersburg. Several small\r\nSovereigns were also silent. The letters from Austria were cordial,\r\nthose from Prussia excellent, Saxony was tender, England correct,\r\nHolland kind but otherwise without interest.\r\n\r\nThe King, who very justly fears any shock, wishes to keep the present\r\nMinistry as long as possible, but he thinks he already sees some new\r\ngerms of division which he fears will develop during the sick leave\r\nfor which M. Thiers has applied and which will be accorded. The\r\ncomposition of a new Cabinet would be very difficult, chiefly owing to\r\nthe question of the Presidency, which touches everybody's vanity. The\r\nKing would like to abolish the Presidency altogether, and with this in\r\nview he would like to entrust it for a short time to some exceptional\r\nperson with whom no one would compete and who could have no successor.\r\nIt is thus that he comes to think of M. de Talleyrand. His Majesty is\r\nat least as antagonistic as ever to the doctrinaire party in the\r\nCabinet, and fears above all that if there were a partial dissolution\r\nit would be this factor which would be strengthened.\r\n\r\nI am always surprised when people lie without any particular object.\r\nIt is quite natural that newspapers should amuse themselves by\r\ndeceiving the public, but when Ministers of State amuse themselves by\r\ntelling falsehoods the effect is curious. Thus M. Guizot told me the\r\nday before yesterday that it was he who broke the news of the\r\ncatastrophe of July 28 to the Queen at the Hôtel de la Chancellerie.\r\nWell, it appears that the Princesses were told of the danger to which\r\nthe King had just been exposed while they were still at the Tuileries\r\nand on the point of leaving for the Chancellerie, by two aides-de-camp\r\nsent by the King for that purpose! Vanity leads people into very\r\ncontemptible things. Could anything be more childish than to invent a\r\nlying story about a fact of this kind?\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 10, 1835._--M. le Duc d'Orléans regrets that the\r\nWürtemberg project of marriage has not come off. He says he wishes to\r\nsettle the matter as regards Princess Sophia, and to visit Stuttgart\r\nwhen he next goes to Germany. He says that if he married some one else\r\nwithout having seen her, he would be convinced that he had missed his\r\ntrue fate.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Orléans is very bitter about the Ministry in general; the\r\nroyal family is disposed to blame the negligence and obstinacy (if it\r\nis no worse) of the police for what has happened. He is sure that for\r\nsome time back the police have been wanting in ability, but as for\r\nthe escape of Pépin, he is convinced it is due to the negligence of M.\r\nPasquier, who sits languidly in an arm-chair and gives incomplete\r\norders, and also to some extent to M. Martin du Nord, who transmits\r\nthese orders, with even less detail, to inferior agents, who carry\r\nthem out in the slackest way. M. Legonidec, in exculpating himself,\r\nmakes very grave charges against his superiors, and some go so far as\r\nto say that M. Pasquier is negligent because he fears to find some\r\nCarlist at the bottom of the Fieschi affair. This is what Madame\r\nAdélaïde wants, and what the Queen fears above all things. The King\r\nthinks that the attempt has a Republican origin. The essential thing\r\nis to get at the truth if possible, and the determination of Ministers\r\nto see nothing in the whole affair but a conspiracy conceived in a\r\ncabaret is not one which is likely to lead to new discoveries.\r\n\r\nPrince Leopold of Naples is accused of practising such duplicity in\r\nthe matter of his marriage that any other than Princess Marie might\r\nhave been disgusted with the affair. She is, however, anxious to be\r\nsettled; no other match offers, and, as the King says, \"You know, of\r\ncourse, that Neapolitan princesses simply must be married.\" His\r\ndaughter is half a Neapolitan.\r\n\r\nThe eldest of our Princesses, the Queen of the Belgians, had so little\r\ninclination for the King, her husband, that she refuses ever to return\r\nto Compiègne, where her marriage was solemnised; and it is chiefly for\r\nthis reason that the Court is arranging to go to Fontainebleau.\r\nHowever, this disinclination on the part of Queen Louise has been\r\ntransformed into a conjugal affection so intense that she lives almost\r\nshut up with the King in a _tête-à-tête_ which is hardly interrupted\r\neven by her ladies or the Master of the Household who receive all\r\ntheir orders in writing. The King and the Queen occupy adjoining\r\nrooms, the doors of which are left open. The King, who is timid and\r\ndomestic in his habits, likes this sort of life very well, and it is\r\nmuch to his wife's taste, for she is only loved by her husband, while\r\nhe is adored by her. I have these details from her brother, the Duc\r\nd'Orléans.\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 11, 1835._--My son Alexander, who is just returned\r\nfrom Italy, says that the country is covered with monks flying from\r\nSpain and taking with them the treasures of their convents. The\r\nprecious stones which come from this source are being sold cheap.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of the French, though in delicate health, goes to bed late,\r\nand never retires without having herself read all the petitions\r\naddressed to her. She does this chiefly because she fears she might\r\nmiss some information which might be given in this form and might\r\nconcern the King's safety.\r\n\r\nOn July 28, at the very moment when he saw his three sons round him,\r\nhe turned to M. Thiers and, stretching out his hand, said, \"Do not be\r\nalarmed: I am alive and well.\" These are words worthy of Henri IV.!\r\n\r\n_Maintenon, September_ 12, 1835.--This place is quite restored and\r\nfurnished. The rooms are fine; there is a large establishment. The\r\nriver is clear, and the aqueducts are on a great scale. For any one\r\nwho does not miss a view, and who does not fear the damp, this old\r\nchâteau, which has so many associations, is one of the most splendid\r\nand attractive abodes possible.\r\n\r\n_Courtalin, September 13, 1835._[54]--Here they know all about what is\r\npassing at the Court of Charles X. It is said that the language there\r\non the subject of the crime of July 28 has been very kind and correct.\r\nThat unhappy Court spends its time in internal warfare and animosity.\r\nThere are exactly the same intrigues and rivalries as there used to be\r\nat Rome at the Court of the Pretender.\r\n\r\n  [54] A castle belonging to the Duc de Montmorency.\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, September 14, 1835._--This morning I went to see the\r\nPrince de Laval at his pretty manor of Montigny, which he is arranging\r\nand adorning in the most delightful manner, while trying to preserve\r\nits Gothic character. It is a place which suits well with the heraldic\r\ntastes of its possessor.\r\n\r\nAt Tours I found the Prefect rather irritated at a Ministerial order\r\nrequiring an exact report of the newspapers which the officials of the\r\nGovernment take in. This little inquisition does, in fact, somewhat\r\nrecall the curiosity which used to be displayed under the Restoration.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 15, 1835._--To-day I dined at Beauregard with\r\nMadame de Sainte-Aldegonde. It is a fine house, an old hunting lodge\r\nof François I., which he used when stag hunting from Chambord, in the\r\nForest of Roussé. There is a gallery with a hundred and twenty\r\nportraits, which are very bad but interesting because they represent\r\nall the celebrated people of the period in Europe. The gallery is\r\npaved with tiles contemporary with the house. There is a good deal of\r\nold panelling and furniture very well preserved by their present\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nI arrived late at Valençay and found M. de Talleyrand thinner,\r\ncomplaining of palpitation of the heart, and of some rather painful\r\ntrouble in his left arm. He had just got a letter from the King\r\nannouncing the appointment of M. de Bacourt as Minister at Carlsruhe.\r\nThe following extract refers to the want of deference with which M. de\r\nBroglie treats him: \"My dear Prince, the method which in my\r\n'impotence' I decided to use has proved completely successful, and\r\nwhat you desired[55] has been done. I wished to have at any rate the\r\npleasure of announcing this to you myself while renewing most\r\ncordially the assurance of my old friendship for you which you have\r\nknown so long.\"\r\n\r\n  [55] An allusion to the request made to the King by M. de\r\n  Talleyrand that M. de Bacourt should be appointed to Carlsruhe.\r\n\r\nThe King of the French is not the only Sovereign who does not like his\r\nMinisters. The King of England hates his and speaks openly against\r\nthem at table, as well as against his sister-in-law, the Duchess of\r\nKent, who meanwhile is taking her daughter about from county to county\r\nreceiving addresses and answering them just as if she were Regent\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 16, 1835._--Mlle. Sabine de Noailles is sixteen,\r\nvery beautiful, very clever and well educated, with a voice like a\r\nman, an excellent memory like all the Noailles, and rather brusque\r\nmanners. At dinner at Courtalin she raised her voice, and addressing\r\nM. de Talleyrand, who was not next to her, she said: \"Uncle, will you\r\ndrink a glass of wine with me?\" \"With great pleasure, my dear\r\n_nephew_!\" replied M. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Modena is playing the petty tyrant in his Duchy. One of\r\nhis commonest practices is to have the whiskers and moustaches of\r\nthose whose passports are in any way irregular cut off. The fashion of\r\nthe day makes this a more cruel punishment than imprisonment, which,\r\nhowever, his victims have usually to suffer in addition!\r\n\r\nThe grandmother of the present Duc d'Arenberg, an intimate friend of\r\nMaria Theresa, a great and noble lady in all respects, came to France\r\nunder the Consulate to secure her removal from the list of _émigrés_\r\nand the restoration of such of her property as was still sequestrated.\r\nShe stayed with the Maréchale de Beauveau, who was a friend of hers.\r\nShe had to write to Fouché requesting an interview, which being\r\ngranted she went to the Hôtel de Police. Her carriage was not allowed\r\nto enter, and she had to alight and cross the dirty courtyard. The\r\nMinister was engaged and could not receive the Duchess, whom he\r\nreferred to his principal clerk. The latter said she might sit down\r\nwhile he was looking for the box with the papers about her case. He\r\nbegan to turn over an index and exclaimed, \"But your name was removed\r\na fortnight ago; it is struck out altogether, and since I am the first\r\nto give you the good news I must have a kiss, Citoyenne d'Arenberg.\"\r\nWhereupon he seized the Duchess and kissed her on both cheeks. But\r\nbefore Madame d'Arenberg was at the bottom of the steps he called her\r\nback, shouting: \"Hi! Citoyenne d'Arenberg! I made a mistake; it is not\r\nyou but one d'Alembert who is struck out!\" So the poor Duchess had to\r\ngo back to Madame de Beauveau having been kissed by the clerk but not\r\nstruck out of the list. The First Consul, who heard the story next\r\nday, ordered the Duchess's name to be struck out at once and she got\r\nback her property.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 17, 1835._--The Princesse de Lieven has had a\r\ncurious conversation at Baden with M. Berryer the Advocate and Deputy.\r\n\"What do you think, monsieur, of the new laws proposed by the French\r\nGovernment on the occasion of the attempt of July 28?\" \"I approve of\r\nthem in principle, and that is why I intend to absent myself from the\r\nChamber, where my position would oblige me to oppose them.\"--\"Do you\r\nthink the Government will last?\"--\"No.\"--\"Do you think there will\r\nbe a Republic?\"--\"No.\"--\"Do you think Henri V. will come\r\nin?\"--\"No.\"--\"What, then, do you think?\"--\"Nothing, for in France it\r\nis impossible to establish anything.\" M. Berryer left the next day for\r\nIschl to see Madame la Duchesse de Berry there, and is bound thence\r\nfor Naples.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 18, 1835._--I am anxious about M. de\r\nTalleyrand--not that I think that the symptoms he complains of are\r\nserious, but he is impressed by them. He often speaks of his end, and\r\nis evidently afraid of it, and thrusts the idea away from him with\r\nhorror. He often sighs, and yesterday I heard him exclaim, \"Ah, mon\r\nDieu!\" in a tone of the deepest dejection. Politics and news interest\r\nhim, but there is not much of those to be had here.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 19, 1835._--Lord Alvanly came back in a cab from\r\nthe scene of his duel with O'Connell's son and gave a piece of gold to\r\nthe cabman. The latter, surprised at this generosity, said, \"What, my\r\nlord, a sovereign for taking you so near your death?\"--\"No, my man,\r\nbut for taking me back!\"\r\n\r\nI sent for the excellent Dr. Bretonneau from Tours to examine M. de\r\nTalleyrand. He says that the trouble is only muscular, the muscles\r\nbeing bruised and weary with the efforts M. de Talleyrand has to make\r\nowing to the failure of his legs. He thinks, moreover, that he is in a\r\nnervous state and is languid and bored, but that there is nothing\r\ndangerous. The worst feature is the growing weakness of his\r\nextremities which might at any moment reduce him to complete\r\nhelplessness. In short all the circumstances point to living with\r\ndifficulty, but none suggest that the end is near. I hope that\r\nBretonneau's presence and his kind and clever talk will have calmed M.\r\nde Talleyrand's mind.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 20, 1835._--General Sébastiani has been nearly\r\nblown up in Manchester Square in London. A new Fieschi had deposited\r\nan infernal machine there with the result that one poor woman was\r\ninjured. There are as yet no further particulars. There is nothing but\r\ncrime and mystery in these days!\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard spoke to us yesterday of his last speech in the\r\nChamber of Deputies. He said that if he had held his peace he would\r\nhave thought himself dishonoured, that he would rather have had\r\nhimself carried to the tribune than be silent in a situation in which\r\nthe glory of his whole life was at stake, and finally that he would be\r\ndead now if he had not spoken and that the only reason he is not\r\nbetter than he is, is that he did not manage to express all that he\r\nwas thinking.\r\n\r\nI was bold enough to touch on the subject of the Cours Prévôtales[56]\r\nat the time of the second Restoration, for which he has been so much\r\nblamed lately, and M. Royer-Collard replied: \"It is true that I, with\r\nseveral Councillors of State, was appointed to examine the Bill before\r\nthe Minister introduced it in the Chamber. M. Cuvier and I opposed it\r\nin principle and secured many modifications in detail. M. de Marbois,\r\nwho was then Garde des Sceaux, and who did not like the law, wished it\r\nto be introduced in the Chamber by people who were opposed to it, and\r\nappointed me Government Commissary without consulting me. I did not\r\nknow what had been done till I saw the _Moniteur_ and I complained\r\nbitterly. I did not appear in the Chamber as Commissary during the\r\ndiscussion of the law, and I defy any one to quote a word I ever said\r\nin its favour.\" He added that M. Guizot, then Secretary-General at the\r\nMinistry of Justice, should not have contented himself with being so\r\ngood as to quote to his colleagues in the present Cabinet the\r\n_Moniteur_ which contained his name. He should at the same time have\r\nexplained how it happened. If this accusation had been made in the\r\nChamber instead of merely in the Ministerial press M. Royer-Collard\r\nwould have ascended the tribune to give the true version of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n  [56] In 1789 the Cours Prévôtales were tribunals empowered to\r\n  punish summarily and without appeal certain crimes and offences\r\n  defined by an Ordinance of 1731. Under the Consulate and the\r\n  Empire exceptional jurisdictions were established under the same\r\n  name to deal with desertions, mutiny, political offences and\r\n  smuggling. The Cours Prévôtales of the Restoration were composed\r\n  of Judges of Courts of first instance, and were directed by a\r\n  Prévôt, a superior officer of the army. These Courts from 1815 to\r\n  1817 took cognisance of offences against the public safety and\r\n  acted retrospectively; they were an instrument of Reaction and\r\n  Political vengeance.\r\n\r\nHe is sorry to have wounded M. Thiers by his speech, which was not\r\naimed at him, and he would have liked to be able to make an exception\r\nin his favour.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard, who has not always either thought or spoken well of\r\nKing Louis-Philippe, has changed his mind to a remarkable extent. Last\r\nnight, _à propos_ of the fine portrait of the King which is here, he\r\nsaid he had gone up very much in his opinion, more than he was willing\r\nto admit to himself, so great was the contradiction between his past\r\nand present opinions on this point, and between his reason and his\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 21, 1835._--M. de Talleyrand was reassured for a\r\nday or two by the conscientious and satisfactory report of Bretonneau,\r\nbut has now relapsed into anxieties about his health. He admits that\r\nhe thinks of nothing else and says that the cause lies in his state of\r\nmind, which is depressed and weary. Yesterday evening when I went back\r\nto his room I found him reading a medical book, studying the subject\r\nof heart disease, and fancying he had a polypus. Yet he suffers very\r\nlittle, only at long intervals, and then not without a purely natural\r\ncause. It is clear to me (and I know something about it) that he has\r\nan attack of nerves. He had no experience of this protean malady. He\r\ndenied its existence in others and now he is a victim himself and will\r\nnot admit it.\r\n\r\nThey say that General Alava has been appointed President of the\r\nCouncil at Madrid. He has been saying for the last year that he only\r\naccepted the mission to London because the Duke of Wellington was in\r\noffice. He remained in spite of the Duke's resignation because, he\r\nsaid, Martinez de la Rosa was Premier at Madrid. The reason why he did\r\nnot retire along with Martinez de la Rosa was, he explained, because\r\nToreno was also his friend! He led the English Legion he had raised\r\nin London to Spain in person, after having sworn to declare for Don\r\nCarlos on the day the Queen Regent should summon a single foreigner to\r\ndefend her cause, and finally he seems to have been placed at the head\r\nof the Spanish Cabinet by Mendezabal, whom he once drove out of his\r\nhouse as a rascal and a thief! This, it must be confessed, is to push\r\nthe logic of inconsistency to its furthest limits!\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 22, 1835._--This is the first occasion for twenty\r\nyears that I have spent this anniversary[57] away from M. de\r\nTalleyrand. He went away yesterday to the Conseil Général at\r\nChâteauroux. I remained alone here with the generation which is\r\ndestined to succeed him. This gave rise to one or two reflections,\r\namong which was that when M. de Talleyrand departs this life I should\r\ncome here very seldom--not that I fear that I should not be well\r\ntreated, but the memories of the past would make everything painful to\r\nme, and that the contrast which even yesterday was visible would\r\nbecome more marked. I did not feel that it was my business to manage\r\nand carry on the salon. It was not my house, and I longed for wings in\r\norder to fly to Rochecotte.\r\n\r\n  [57] September 22 is the day of Saint Maurice, the patron Saint\r\n  of M. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\nM. Mennechet, up to the present time editor of _la Mode_, a Carlist\r\npaper, and defamatory on principle, says, \"Just fancy; for five years\r\nI have been leading forlorn hopes on behalf of the Prague people and I\r\nhave only had two letters from them, one from King Charles X. bitterly\r\ncomplaining of the caricatures of Louis-Philippe which we had sent him\r\nand which he ordered us to stop, and the other from Madame la Dauphine\r\nwho two months ago wrote me a very severe letter, sending me back my\r\npaper and saying that she would give up her subscription because we\r\nhad published an article in which it was said that we had seen or\r\nreceived a letter containing good news about the Duc de Bordeaux.\" M.\r\nMennechet, much distressed by these two letters, has resigned the\r\neditorship. I think the letters are very reasonable and very\r\ncreditable to the writers.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 23, 1835._--I am impatiently awaiting M. de\r\nTalleyrand's return from Châteauroux. Though he has become depressed\r\nand irritable, his presence does good here. It fills this great\r\ncastle, and maintains good conversation and manners. Moreover, when he\r\nis here I feel there is a reason for my presence.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 24, 1835._--Bretonneau's diagnosis is justified.\r\nM. de Talleyrand has returned from Châteauroux revived and pleased\r\nwith the reception of the Prefect and the enthusiasm of the whole town\r\nas well as by the success of the road in which he is interested.\r\n\r\nMadame Adélaïde writes that the King's expedition to the town of Eu\r\nhas been not only good for his health but gratifying to him personally\r\nand to all his family. The testimonies of affection which he received\r\nall along the way were impossible to describe.\r\n\r\nPépin was at last recaptured on the morning of the 22nd. This also I\r\nlearn from Madame, but she had only just heard, and gives no details.\r\n\r\nM. de Rigny is said to be at Toulon, which proves that he has not been\r\nsuccessful in his negotiations for the Neapolitan marriage.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 28, 1835_.--M. Brenier, who has just come from\r\nLondon, tells me that General Sébastiani hates music as much as his\r\nwife loves it. He will not allow her to go to the Opera or to\r\nconcerts. One day, however, after many prayers, Madame Sébastiani\r\nobtained permission to go to a concert at Lady Antrobus's. It was on\r\nJune 18, and the General was to call for his wife later. He arrived\r\nsimultaneously with the Duke of Wellington, who was in uniform and\r\nsurrounded by many officers, all coming from the great military dinner\r\ngiven on the occasion of the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.\r\nThe singers were at the moment singing a hymn in honour of the\r\nconqueror. Sébastiani was furious, and told M. de Bourqueney, his\r\nFirst Secretary, who had gone with him, to tell Madame Sébastiani that\r\nshe must leave. She does not understand English, and therefore did not\r\ngrasp what the words of the cantata meant, and at first refused to\r\nleave her place. M. de Bourqueney, stimulated by the furious gestures\r\nof the General, almost dragged the poor woman out by force over the\r\nseats. When she finally got to her husband he said to her, in his\r\npompous and sententious manner, \"I told you, madame, that music would\r\nbe your ruin!\"\r\n\r\nIt was this same M. Bourqueney, who was lately writing for the\r\n_Journal des Débats_ before he went to London with Sébastiani, who had\r\nthe impudence to insinuate that he prepared for M. de Talleyrand from\r\nParis the speech which the Prince made to the King of England in\r\ndelivering the letters accrediting him to the Court of St. James's in\r\n1830. The following is the history of this speech. M. de Talleyrand\r\nwas just finishing dressing to go to the King, and said to me that it\r\nhad occurred to him that it would not be amiss to say a word or two,\r\nas was the old fashion. In the peculiar circumstances of the time he\r\nthought it would be a good thing, but he had no time to prepare\r\nanything. Then he added: \"Come, Madame de Dino, sit down and find me a\r\nfew phrases, and please write them in your largest hand.\" I did so. He\r\nchanged two or three words in my draft, which I recopied while his\r\norders were being pinned on and his hat and cane were being brought.\r\nThis is the precise history of this little speech, which by its\r\nfortunate allusions and a comparison between 1688 and 1830 attracted\r\nsome attention at the time.[58]\r\n\r\n  [58] This speech is given at the end of this volume. I shall\r\n  quote only the phrase here referred to. \"England, like France,\r\n  repudiates in her foreign relations the principle of interfering\r\n  in the affairs of her neighbours, and the ambassador of a\r\n  monarchy established by the unanimous votes of a great people\r\n  feels himself at ease in a land of liberty, in the presence of a\r\n  scion of the illustrious House of Brunswick.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the letter of resignation which M. de Talleyrand\r\nwrote less than a year ago. The general idea is that M. Royer-Collard\r\nwas its author, so here again follows an exact account of what passed.\r\nMy conscience had told me that it was absolutely necessary that M. de\r\nTalleyrand should send in his resignation, and I familiarised him by\r\ndegrees with this idea. I knew that he always found it difficult to\r\nexpress his thoughts in words, and that he preferred to act. I had,\r\ntherefore, for a long time been considering what words it would be\r\nbest to use. At last, one day last November, when we were alone here,\r\nI spoke again to M. de Talleyrand of the propriety, which was daily\r\ngrowing more obvious, of his sending in his resignation--a step from\r\nwhich he still shrank a little. He then said that the necessary letter\r\nwould be very hard to write. Thereupon I immediately gathered together\r\nall that I had prepared in thought and put it into writing. I came\r\nback in half an hour and read what I had written to M. de Talleyrand,\r\nwho was much struck with it and adopted it entire, all but two words,\r\nwhich he thought affected. I then asked him to submit the proposed\r\nletter to M. Royer-Collard, which he was quite willing to do. Next\r\nmorning I left for Châteauvieux. M. Royer-Collard thought well of the\r\nletter, only putting at the end \"the thoughts which it suggests\"\r\ninstead of \"the warning which it gives,\" as I had written, and\r\nreplacing one expression at the beginning, which he thought too\r\npompous, by another in better taste. Thus, without any further\r\nalteration, this letter afterwards appeared in the _Moniteur_, and for\r\na good while occupied public attention. All the letters of this period\r\nwritten by M. de Talleyrand to the King, Madame Adélaïde, and the Duke\r\nof Wellington, were first thrown on paper by me and then rehandled by\r\nhim. It was only the first above-mentioned, which contained his\r\nresignation, which was corrected by M. Royer-Collard. The others were\r\nmerely communicated to him, and he approved them all.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 1, 1835._--Yesterday I went to Châteauvieux; the\r\nweather was terrible.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard said that, of all the people he had ever met, the two\r\nmost alike were Charles X. and M. de la Fayette. They were both\r\nequally mad, equally obstinate, and equally honest. Speaking of M.\r\nThiers, he said: \"He is a good-humoured rascal with plenty of\r\ncleverness and some sparks of greatness, but capable of losing an\r\nempire by his recklessness and excitability.\" Referring to the recent\r\nrepressive laws, he said: \"I have no love for dictators, but reason\r\ntells me that they are necessary at times. Perhaps the present is one\r\nof these times. But where are we to find the Dictator? If they frankly\r\nproposed the King I could understand it, but to think of the present\r\nCabinet occupying such a position!\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 4, 1835._--Yesterday I heard some singular stories\r\nof M. Cousin, whose formerly revolutionary ideas have changed into\r\nmonarchical sentiments of the most exalted character. Some delightful\r\nremarks on the subject are quoted. It seems that this illustrious Peer\r\nhas composed a monarchical and Catholic Catechism. The work being\r\ncompleted it was laid before M. Guizot, who gave it his approval, as\r\ndid M. Persil, Minister of Public Worship. The book was printed, sent\r\nout to educational establishments, and recommended to all the\r\ninstitutions under the University. After all this there came a poor\r\npriest with the book in his hand and proved that all these doctors had\r\nonly forgotten one little thing in the whole system of Catholic\r\ndoctrine, which was the doctrine of Purgatory, to which not the\r\nslightest allusion was made throughout the catechism, verified and\r\napproved as it was by M. Guizot, Minister of Public Instruction and a\r\nCalvinist!\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 10, 1835._--A pedantic and ill-mannered Prefect\r\nspitefully refused permission to M. de Talleyrand to plant a few\r\ntrees, saying that he was \"_à cheval sur la loi_.\" \"Dear me,\" replied\r\nM. de Talleyrand, \"you have chosen to ride a sorry jade!\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Alfieri was at first attracted by the ideas of the\r\nFrench Revolution, but became so disgusted with them, that he\r\ndetermined to leave France. The reason of this was that one day he was\r\ndriving four-in-hand in the Bois de Boulogne at a great pace, himself\r\nholding the reins, when the horses were requisitioned by force for the\r\npublic service. That very evening he announced his departure, and in\r\nreply to entreaties that he should remain, he observed, \"What on earth\r\nis one to do in a country where the nobility have no daggers and the\r\npriests no poison!\"\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 16, 1835._--I am confronted with new anxieties. I\r\nhad heard that the Princesse de Talleyrand was in an alarming\r\ncondition, and that her end appeared to be approaching. The Baronne de\r\nTalleyrand, who told me, asked me to prepare M. de Talleyrand for this\r\nevent. I confess I shrank from this mission. The gloomy ideas which\r\nhave so frequently recurred to M. de Talleyrand's mind for some time,\r\nthe depression caused by his great age, the anxiety which he feels at\r\nthe slightest symptoms, the sharp and painful impression made on him\r\nby the deaths of his contemporaries--all this made me hesitate to tell\r\nhim that his wife's days were numbered. I was not afraid of the shock\r\nof the bereavement, for his heart is not interested. But the\r\ndisappearance of a person much of his own age, with whom he had lived\r\nand of whom he had once been fond, or who had been so indispensable to\r\nhim that he had given her his name--all this made me think that the\r\nPrincess's danger would affect him deeply.\r\n\r\nI racked my brains to find some oblique way of getting at the subject\r\nwithout speaking directly of a seizure. My first remarks were received\r\nin silence, after which M. de Talleyrand immediately changed the\r\nsubject. Next day, however, he returned to it, but only to refer to\r\nthe embarrassment it would be to be in mourning if she did die, of the\r\nfuneral, and of the cards that would be sent out. If the Princess did\r\ndie, he said, he would go out of Paris for a week or a fortnight, and\r\nall this he said, not only without any trace of grief, but even in a\r\ntone of obvious relief. He immediately proceeded to enter on the\r\nfinancial questions of importance which are involved in his wife's\r\ndeath which would repossess him not only of her annuity, but also of\r\nother monies in which she has only a life interest. All the rest of\r\nthe day M. de Talleyrand showed a kind of serenity and gaiety which I\r\nhave not seen in him for a long time, and which struck me so much,\r\nthat when I heard him positively humming a tune, I could not help\r\nasking him \"if it was the fact that he was soon to be a widower that\r\nput him in such spirits.\" He made a face at me like a mischievous\r\nchild, and went on talking about all there would be to do if the\r\nPrincess were to die. He will have the satisfaction of an easier\r\nincome, which will be a relief to him, as for some years past his\r\nrevenues have, to his great annoyance, notably diminished owing to\r\nseveral causes. Besides this, it is probably a relief to him (though\r\nhe will not acknowledge this even to me), to see a bond snapped which\r\nwas the greatest scandal of his life because it was the only one which\r\nwas irremediable.\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 18, 1835._--After several months of silence, during\r\nwhich General Alava has come to grief at the head of the English\r\nruffians he took with him to Spain, I have received a letter from him\r\nat Madrid, dated the 6th instant, which begins thus: \"You were right,\r\nmy dear Duchesse, when you once said that to enter Spain with foreign\r\ntroops was to tempt Providence.\" The letter ends with another allusion\r\nto my prediction, which seems to have come true to a degree which poor\r\nabsurd Alava can hardly bear. He insists, however, that he was in\r\nhonour bound to this partisan existence which he dignifies with the\r\nepithet chivalrous, although it is merely Quixotic in the bad sense.\r\n\r\nHe does not need to explain why he refused the Premiership, but he\r\nsays he took the Ministry of Foreign Affairs because he saw the safety\r\nof the Queen Regent was compromised. He does not say how. He then adds\r\nthat as soon as he was reassured on this point he retired completely\r\nfrom the Cabinet, that his only desire is to resume his duties in\r\nLondon as soon as the session of the Cortès is over. He seems to feel\r\nthe uncertainty of this, for he says, \"Heaven alone knows what\r\nobstacles may come between me and London before then.\" He ends by\r\nsaying that if he goes back to England it will be by sea in order to\r\navoid Paris which, according to him, is a very dangerous place for a\r\nSpanish diplomatist.\r\n\r\nAs regards France, he says: \"As they waited for the _casus fœderis_\r\nbefore they acted, the _casus mortis_ in which we find ourselves,\r\nrelieves us of the necessity of thinking of our liberation, which is a\r\nthing of which dead men have no need.\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 23, 1835._--We have been back in Paris some days.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Orléans was speaking to me yesterday of the Neapolitan\r\nmarriage planned for his sister Princess Marie, which did not come\r\noff, and he told me that he had applied to his brother-in-law, the\r\nKing of the Belgians, who is here just now, to find some younger son\r\nof a great German House who would be willing to marry the Princess and\r\ncome and live at Paris. Princess Marie is clever, but her imagination\r\nis vivid and restless; she is fond of the arts, and is little used to\r\nrestraint or to pomp and ceremony. They think she would be happier if\r\nestablished in Paris, and certainly freer than she would be elsewhere.\r\nNo opportunity seems likely to occur of a foreign marriage; even the\r\nchance of such a thing seems more remote. The Princess is\r\ntwenty-three, and the Queen is worried and anxious about it.\r\n\r\nThe pretensions of the King's children are in all things much reduced,\r\nfor M. Guizot said the other day, when M. de Bacourt was leaving for\r\nCarlsruhe, that there might not be much to do, but there was one\r\nthing, which was to preserve the last Princess of Baden for M. le Duc\r\nd'Orléans. This Princess is the daughter of Stéphanie de Beauharnais.\r\nI doubt if this marriage would be agreeable to the young Prince, who\r\nonly yesterday, _à propos_ of the Leuchtenbergs, said some hard things\r\nof the Beauharnais family. He said they were all intriguers, and would\r\nnot make an exception even in favour of the Grand Duchess Stéphanie of\r\nBaden who, in my opinion, deserves a place apart. She is not only a\r\nkindly woman, but there is in her a touch of sublimity, though she is\r\na trifle too energetic and her pretensions to wit are excessive.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Talleyrand is better, and so little concerned about\r\nher condition that all she thinks of is how to secure further\r\nadvantages for herself at her husband's death.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 24, 1835._--M. Pasquier told us yesterday that they\r\nhad been obliged to amputate one of Fieschi's finger-joints as a\r\nresult of the wound caused by the bursting of his infernal machine,\r\nand that the patient grasped the injured finger with the other hand\r\nbefore the surgeons began their work saying: \"Little one, I am sorry,\r\nbut you are going to lose your head before I lose mine.\" His coolness,\r\ncourage and physical strength are only equalled by his excessive\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\nI find the Tuileries depressing, Madame Adélaïde aged, the King\r\nflushed and stouter. They are both cast down by the departure of the\r\nPrince Royal for Algeria. The punishment of an African brigand does\r\nnot seem a sufficient motive for risking so precious a life. They are\r\ndispleased with Ministers for having rather encouraged than checked\r\nthe adventurous and highly natural impulse of the young Prince.\r\n\r\nThe cholera has ceased neither at Toulon nor in Africa; it may yet\r\ncause some calamity to the King. The failure of the Neapolitan\r\nmarriage disappoints, and the extreme coldness of the new Russian\r\nAmbassador discourages them.\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-six hours he spent in Vienna with the ostensible purpose\r\nof paying his respects to the last Emperor of Austria, and with the\r\nreal object of charming M. de Metternich through his wife, and the\r\nArchduke Louis through the Archduchess Sophia, the Czar of Russia\r\nrushed all over the city in a cab, forced the vault in which the last\r\nEmperor is buried, and contrived to change his uniform four times!\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of the appointment of Count Pahlen as Russian Ambassador in\r\nFrance the Carlists are saying that nothing can more clearly prove the\r\n_rapprochement_ of the Czar Nicholas with King Louis-Philippe than the\r\nchoice of the son of a murderer as Ambassador at the Court of the son\r\nof a regicide.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 27, 1835._--M. de Talleyrand said yesterday that on\r\nhis return from America, after all the horrors of the Revolution, he\r\nmet Sieyès and asked him how he had got through that frightful time,\r\nand what he did during those miserable years. \"I lived,\" replied\r\nSieyès! It was in fact the best, and the most difficult, thing to do!\r\n\r\nThe Government, wishing to find a pretext for the liberation of the\r\nHam prisoners,[59] eagerly seized on some symptoms of mental\r\nderangement shown by M. de Chantelauze. M. Thiers intended after some\r\nmonths of an asylum to remove the prisoners to the country houses of\r\nfriends who would be answerable for them, and with this end in view he\r\nhad appointed a commission of celebrated physicians to inquire into\r\nthe condition of M. de Chantelauze and at the same time that of the\r\nother ex-Ministers. M. de Chantelauze however, as soon as he heard of\r\nthe impending arrival of the doctors, hastened to declare that he\r\nwould receive them politely as eminent persons but not in their\r\nmedical capacity, that he would answer none of their questions, and\r\nthat he desired his complete and instantaneous liberation or nothing.\r\nI much doubt whether his companions in misfortune are pleased with him\r\nfor showing so much disdain.\r\n\r\n  [59] In 1830 the signatories of the celebrated decrees which led\r\n  to the fall of Charles X., MM. de Polignac, de Peyronnet, Guernon\r\n  de Ranville, and Chantelauze, were prosecuted before the House of\r\n  Peers, deprived of their titles, and condemned to perpetual\r\n  imprisonment. They were then confined at Ham.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 14, 1835._--I have just had very friendly letters\r\nfrom Lord and Lady Grey. They are very busy with their estate of\r\nHowick, from which they write, and seem to be quite out of politics.\r\n\r\nLady Grey says a thing which I echo with all my heart. \"If my friends\r\nwill only love me and I can possess a garden in summer and an armchair\r\nin winter I am perfectly happy in leading the life of an\r\noyster.--Don't expose me to Madame de Lieven, she would think me unfit\r\nto live!\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 16, 1835._--M. de Barante came to say good-bye. He\r\nleaves to-morrow for St. Petersburg with a full heart and an anxious\r\nmind. Since the famous speech[60] of the Czar Nicolas at Warsaw, which\r\nMadame de Lieven herself refers to as a catastrophe, and since the\r\ncommentary of the articles in the _Journal des Débats_ on this speech,\r\nthe position of the French Ambassador is a very difficult one. The\r\nline he is to take seems to me a good one and all the more prudent as\r\nit was traced for him by the King.\r\n\r\n  [60] The speech here mentioned was made on October 10, 1835, at\r\n  Warsaw by the Emperor Nicolas, in the presence of the Corporation\r\n  of that City, whom he was addressing. The Imperial words were\r\n  filled with threats and reproaches to the Poles, formulated in\r\n  terms so violent that they astonished Europe, where their\r\n  authenticity was largely doubted. The allusions to clandestine\r\n  relations maintained by the Polish rebels with foreign Powers,\r\n  embarrassed more than one diplomatist, and more than one\r\n  Government. This speech was published by the _Journal des Débats_\r\n  of November 11, 1835, and will be found in the Appendix to this\r\n  volume.\r\n\r\nWe dined last night at the Tuileries, where there were only the Royal\r\nFamily, the ladies and gentlemen actually in attendance, and some\r\nyoung people, the friends of the little Princes. M. le Duc d'Aumale\r\nhad just been head of his class, which put him in high spirits. He was\r\nthe only member of the company who appeared to me to be so.\r\n\r\nThe King was so kind as to have a charming portrait of Mary Stuart\r\nbrought for me to see. It was all the more interesting as its history\r\nis pathetic. Mary Stuart's ladies went from England to Belgium\r\nimmediately after their mistress's execution, and took with them this\r\nportrait which they placed in a public building where it still is. The\r\nQueen of the Belgians had a perfect copy of it made for the King, her\r\nfather, and it is this copy which I saw.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening the King had a long talk with M. de\r\nTalleyrand and asked him to take a journey to Vienna. This however he\r\ndeclined, alleging in excuse the season of the year, his age, and the\r\npresence of another Ambassador already accredited to Vienna.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 20, 1835._--The effect of the famous speech of the\r\nEmperor Nicolas to the municipality of Warsaw has been no less\r\ndisagreeable at Vienna than at Berlin. The English papers have\r\nattacked it violently. The _Morning Chronicle_, the organ of the Whig\r\nCabinet, has been much more violent even than the _Journal des\r\nDébats_. _A propos_ of the latter a curious thing has happened. The\r\nGovernment, wearied of all the indiscretions and improprieties\r\ncommitted by the _Débats_, which are becoming embarrassing owing to\r\nthe semi-official colour of the paper, formed the idea of giving more\r\nimportance to the _Moniteur_ by inserting carefully-written articles,\r\nthus taking away the Ministerial importance of the _Débats_. This was\r\nthe King's idea, and was adopted by the Cabinet. When, however, the\r\nquestion arose who should have the direct control of the _Moniteur_\r\nthe Duc de Broglie claimed it as President of the Council, whereupon\r\nthe King at once dropped the plan, and things are as they were before.\r\n\r\nLetters from England report that the English Ministry is much\r\nembarrassed. Lord John Russell's timid speech at Bristol, without\r\nsatisfying the Conservatives has irritated the Radicals and the Irish\r\nCatholics extremely, and the Cabinet's very existence appears to be\r\nseriously threatened though the question is adjourned until the\r\nopening of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe more I see of Count Pahlen, the new Russian Ambassador, the more\r\nexcellent I find his disposition. I know on excellent authority that\r\nhe has written to his Court in clear, simple, straightforward and\r\nkindly terms about what he has lately thought and seen. He did not\r\nconceal how much his social position was suffering owing to the\r\ninstructions he had received, and he added that he did not feel bound\r\nto remain in such a position, declaring finally that his Government\r\nshould either modify its first instructions or recall him. This\r\ndeclaration was sent off yesterday. The King and Madame Adélaïde are\r\nimpatiently awaiting the answer, which of course will decide what\r\nrelations there will be in future between our Government and that of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 23, 1835._--Here are the leading points of a letter\r\nwhich I have just received from the Duke of Wellington. \"We are still\r\non the path on which we entered five years ago. All we can hope for is\r\nthat the pace will not be too fast. To stop, and, above all, to\r\nreturn, is impossible. Robespierre was at least honest as regards\r\nmoney, his power was founded on disinterestedness; but those who\r\nintend to govern us and who are going to be our rulers will not be\r\nguided by the same considerations. At least I fear not.\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 24, 1835._--I spent a curious morning yesterday of\r\nwhich I wish to give a detailed description, but in order to be\r\nunderstood I must say a few words by way of preface.\r\n\r\nI have a cousin named Louisa de Chabannes. In her early youth she was\r\nvery pretty, and sang and painted. She was well bred but poor, and got\r\nno opportunity of marrying. She became retired, unsociable, weakly,\r\nand almost ugly. I used to see her three or four times a year, and I\r\nwas always struck by the weariness of her manner, by her pallor and\r\nthinness, and by her silence and nervousness. Seven years ago I heard\r\nthat she had joined the _Grandes Carmélites_. I was not surprised, for\r\nthough she had never been exactly pious, it was quite clear that she\r\nwas ill at ease in the world. However, like all her relations, I was\r\nquite convinced that the austerities of this severe Order would soon\r\ndestroy that fragile and ailing organism. I heard, however, at long\r\nintervals, from her brother Alfred that she was still alive, and\r\nindeed much better than she used to be.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning I got a letter beginning, \"My dear Cousin,\" and\r\nending \"Sœur Thérèse de Jésus.\" For a moment I did not understand;\r\nthen I recollected Louisa de Chabannes. In this letter she said that\r\nhaving at last obtained permission to see me from her Superior she\r\nbegged me to come at once. Yesterday was one of the very few days on\r\nwhich visits are allowed, and she added that in order that I should\r\nnot be terrified she had as a great favour obtained permission to see\r\nme with her face uncovered and without witnesses. I should have been\r\nvery sorry to disappoint the poor woman, and as I had business with\r\nthe Archbishop, who lives in the same neighbourhood, I resolved to do\r\nboth on the same day.\r\n\r\nI left at two, and drew up at the end of the Rue d'Enfer before a\r\ndoorway surmounted by a cross. The doorkeeper told me that Vespers\r\nwere not over, for the nuns said the Great Office every day, and that\r\nI should go into the Chapel. I did so. At the end of the choir there\r\nis a grille armed with projecting points, behind which is a great\r\nbrown veil, and the voices of the Sisters come from beyond this.\r\nBesides myself there were only two old ladies in the chapel, the only\r\nornaments of which are a kneeling statue of Cardinal Bérulle in white\r\nmarble and several portraits of S. Theresa. I did not know my cousin\r\nwell enough to recognise her voice, but the Office came to an end\r\nalmost immediately, and I went back to the doorkeeper's room, where I\r\nfound the convent doctor, who had just called.\r\n\r\nWhile they were away announcing his arrival and mine he saw that I\r\nwas shivering, for in this house there never is any fire except in the\r\ninfirmary and in the kitchen. The doctor then spoke to me of the\r\nrégime of the establishment, which he declares is not unwholesome, and\r\nto prove it said that after numerous observations he had come to the\r\nconclusion that the average age reached by women outside was\r\nthirty-seven, whereas among the Carmélites it was as much as\r\nfifty-four. He left me to go to the infirmary and soon afterwards they\r\ntook me to the parlour, which also was without a fire. A little cane\r\narm-chair, on which was spread a mat also of cane, was drawn up to an\r\niron grille lined with a wooden casing, and behind this double barrier\r\nthere was a curtain of brown wool.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments I heard a lock turned and some one came forward to\r\nthe grille and said in a clear voice, \"_Deo gratias_.\" I did not know\r\nwhat to reply and was silent, when the same voice repeated \"_Deo\r\ngratias_.\" Thereupon I had to say \"I have not been told what answer I\r\nshould give.\" A little burst of laughter disconcerted me--\"My dear\r\ncousin, I only wanted to be sure that it was you.\" The curtain was\r\ndrawn and I saw before me a round fresh smiling countenance lit up by\r\ntwo bright blue eyes. Instead of the feeble voice I expected I heard\r\nrich, animated, and rapid accents. The thoughts which she expressed\r\nwere kindly and sweet, and the assurances she gave of her happiness\r\nand contentment were corroborated by her appearance, which certainly\r\nwas strikingly reassuring in a nun so strictly cloistered. She is\r\nforty-eight and does not look thirty-six. She thanked me very much for\r\nhaving come, and handed me a little medal with an effigy of the\r\nBlessed Virgin, begging me to make M. de Talleyrand wear it without\r\nhis knowledge. \"This medal,\" she said, \"brings back to the Faith even\r\nthose who have wandered furthest from it.\" I did not refuse to do as\r\nshe wished, as to do so would have been horribly unkind. Besides,\r\nthere is something catching in a faith so sincere and so vivid! I said\r\nthat I would look for a favourable moment for carrying out her blessed\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nI left much touched, and very thoughtful after saying adieu, probably\r\nfor ever, to this charming and happy woman, who sleeps on a board,\r\nnever has a fire, fasts the whole year round, and would be distressed\r\nif she did not say with S. Theresa, \"may I suffer or else die.\"\r\n\r\nI went on the Rue Saint-Jacques to the Convent of the Dames\r\nSaint-Michel to see the Archbishop, to whom I wished to speak about a\r\nproject of marriage between my second son and Mlle. de Fougères. I was\r\nconducted by one of the sisters, clad in white from head to foot, to a\r\nlittle separate building which looks into the immense garden of the\r\nConvent. M. de Quélen has lived here almost entirely since the\r\ndestruction of his palace. His apartments are clean, pretty, and very\r\nwell looked after.\r\n\r\nI found the Archbishop well and in good spirits and very much pleased\r\nto see me. He at once began to talk to me about my children, of their\r\nfuture and their marriages. I did not hesitate to go into details with\r\nhim on this subject. He listened kindly and said that he would always\r\nbe delighted to testify the interest he took in the family of the\r\nCardinal de Périgord, and particularly in my children. I must know\r\nthat he had a special interest in me which was due to the qualities I\r\npossessed, and to the fact that he had always regarded me as the\r\ninstrument which Providence would probably use to accomplish its\r\nmerciful and redeeming work on M. de Talleyrand. I made him promise to\r\npay a morning call on M. de Talleyrand from time to time, as he used\r\nto do before our departure for England. When I left he said \"Treat me\r\nas you used to do, as a relative, and promise me that you will come\r\nand see me again about the New Year.\" I said I would, and asked if I\r\nmight then present my daughter, who had been baptized and confirmed by\r\nhim. \"And who, I hope, will not be married by any one else,\" he\r\nreplied, on which I took my leave.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 6, 1835._--Here is a story which M. Molé told me last\r\nnight. Madame de Caulaincourt (Mlle. d'Aubusson) married in 1812. On\r\nleaving the church after the ceremony she went back to the convent\r\nwhere she had been educated, and her husband left for the front. He\r\nwas killed at the battle of La Moskowa, where his brother-in-law, a\r\nyoung page of the Emperor, disappeared and was never heard of again.\r\nMadame de Caulaincourt, after her year of mourning, returned to\r\nSociety, but did not go out much. She kept her father's house, he\r\nhaving been for long a widower. Her eldest brother, shortly after his\r\nmarriage with Mlle. de Boissy, became completely insane, and her\r\nsister, the Duchesse de Vantadour, was attacked by a slow consumption.\r\nThe father, all of whose children were stricken, decided to marry\r\nagain, and did, in fact, marry Madame Greffulhe, mother of Madame de\r\nCastellane. Madame de Caulaincourt then retired to a convent, where\r\nshe wished to take the veil. Her father opposed this and the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, whose consent was necessary, refused to give it\r\nso long as M. d'Aubusson withheld his approval. Madame de Caulaincourt\r\nwas forced to give up her idea, but she took part in the exercises of\r\nthe Sisterhood and wore their habit, never leaving the convent except\r\nwhen her father was ill. Her grief at not being allowed to follow her\r\nvocation undermined her health and the mischief settled naturally on\r\nher chest. On her deathbed she at last obtained her father's\r\npermission and sent for the Archbishop, to whom she communicated her\r\ndesire to take the veil at the same time as she received extreme\r\nunction. There were some difficulties about this, but they were\r\novercome, and forty-eight hours before she breathed her last she\r\nreceived the last sacraments and the veil that she so ardently\r\ndesired! She died yesterday morning, in the odour of sanctity, a young\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 9, 1835._--Madame la Princesse de Talleyrand died an\r\nhour ago. I have not yet told M. de Talleyrand more than that she was\r\ndying. Even where there is no affection the word \"dead\" has a sinister\r\nsound, and I do not like to say it to an aged man in ill-health--the\r\nless so as when he awoke to-day he had another slight heart attack,\r\nwhich abated on the application of mustard to his legs. He fell asleep\r\nagain, and I shall tell him of his wife's death when he again awakes.\r\nHe is in haste, I think, to be free at all costs from the agitations\r\nof these last days.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 15, 1835._--M. Guizot came to see M. de Talleyrand\r\nyesterday, and told us that among the papers of M. Réal, formerly\r\nChief of the Imperial Police, there had been discovered the original\r\nmanuscript of the Memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz, with the erasures\r\nmade by the monks of Saint Mihiel. The manuscript had been bought by\r\nthe Government, which had invoked the aid of the cleverest chemist in\r\nParis, who, having vainly tried various methods, had finally\r\ndiscovered one which enabled the superimposed text to be removed and\r\nthe original to be read. A new edition of the Memoirs, based on this\r\nmanuscript, is to be published.\r\n\r\nMadame d'Esclignac, who is behaving very badly about the property of\r\nthe Princesse de Talleyrand, had a discussion on the subject yesterday\r\nwith the Duchesse de Poix. The latter tried to make her see the\r\nimpropriety of her conduct, how odious the publicity of a lawsuit\r\nwould be, and how ungrateful to M. de Talleyrand, who gave her a dowry\r\nand is still paying a pension to her old nurse, whom she had left to\r\ndie of hunger. To all this Madame d'Esclignac replied: \"For my own\r\npart I do not fear any scandal, and as far as my uncle is concerned I\r\ndesire it. I shall have the Faubourg Saint-Germain on my side, for I\r\nhad the Archbishop of Paris to administer the last sacraments to\r\nMadame de Talleyrand.\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 21, 1835._--Count Pahlen received from his Government\r\nyesterday very satisfactory despatches, which assure him that the\r\nextravagances of the _Journal des Débats_ are not confounded with the\r\nviews of the King and his Ministers. These despatches, which came by\r\npost, were quite obviously intended to be read by the public. The\r\nAmbassador expects a courier every day, who will no doubt bring an\r\nexpression of the private views of the Czar.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Lieven, whom I met yesterday at Madame Apponyi's,\r\nspoke to me about her affairs, and said that for a long time back her\r\nhusband and she had invested all their savings out of Russia in order\r\nthat they might be safe from ukases.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Laval said yesterday, amusingly enough, that M. de\r\nMontrond's wit \"fed on human flesh!\" M. de Talleyrand thinks this\r\n\"_very true and very neat!_\"\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 30, 1835._--I saw Madame Adélaïde yesterday. She was\r\nmuch satisfied with the opening sitting of the Chambers, which had\r\ntaken place that very morning. She was pleased with the reception the\r\nKing had, both coming and going, and along all the way from the Garde\r\nNationale. There had been great difficulties in settling the terms of\r\nthe speech from the Throne, which was still under discussion ten\r\nminutes before the sitting. The words \"the Head of my Family,\" which\r\nare causing a great sensation, which are thought bold, but which\r\nplease the diplomatic corps and every one who is on the side of\r\nstability, originate neither in the Palace nor in the Cabinet. They\r\ncome from a sentence composed by M. de Talleyrand and me, which the\r\nKing eagerly adopted, but the Cabinet would only authorise the words\r\n\"the Head of my Family.\" The Carlists think them insolent! They are\r\nhorrified at the idea of a fourth family! The Republicans like them no\r\nbetter, perhaps rather worse; ... every one else approves of them\r\nhighly.\r\n\r\nYesterday we had at dinner Madame de Lieven, Mr. Edward Ellice, Count\r\nPahlen, Matuczewicz, and M. Thiers, who was in high spirits and very\r\nbrilliant in conversation. He took me into a corner and told me that\r\nle Bergeron, of Port Royal, had a new criminal enterprise in hand. He\r\nhad disguised himself in woman's clothes along with one of his\r\nfriends, with the intention of making as if to present a petition to\r\nthe King, and while doing so to shoot him point blank. The plan\r\nmiscarried because the King, instead of riding to the Chamber as he\r\nhad intended, went in a carriage because of the frost. Several arrests\r\nwere made, but as nothing was actually attempted it is thought that\r\nthey will have to release the suspects.\r\n\r\nThe fact that eight horses were attached for the first time to the\r\nKing's carriage attracted attention. The real reason for this is\r\nunknown to the public, and is as follows. For greater safety the King\r\n(without his knowledge) was given the carriage formerly used by the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, which is lined with iron throughout to protect it\r\nfrom shots; it is extremely heavy, and requires eight horses.\r\n\r\nCount Pahlen yesterday received despatches modifying his first\r\ninstructions, which were very severe in their terms and made his\r\nposition here impossible. It appears that this has been clearly\r\nunderstood at St. Petersburg, and that he is to be given more scope.\r\nThis will greatly please Madame de Lieven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n   _Speech made on October 6, 1830, by_ M. DE TALLEYRAND _on the\r\n   occasion of his presenting his credentials to the_ KING OF\r\n   ENGLAND _as Ambassador of France at the Court of St. James's.\r\n   See page 270._\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King of the French has chosen me to be the interpreter\r\nof his sentiments towards Your Majesty, and I have joyfully accepted a\r\nmission which sheds so much lustre on the end of my long career.\r\n\r\nSir, of all the vicissitudes which I have seen in the course of my\r\nlong life, in all the changes of fortune which I have experienced\r\nduring forty eventful years, nothing perhaps could have so completely\r\nsatisfied my desires as an appointment which would bring me back to\r\nthis happy country. But how times change! The jealousies and\r\nprejudices which so long divided France and England have given place\r\nto sentiments of esteem and enlightened affection. Common principles\r\nbind the two countries even more closely together. England in her\r\nforeign policy repudiates, like France, the principle of interfering\r\nin her neighbour's foreign relations, and the Ambassador of a Monarch\r\nwho is the unanimous choice of a great people feels himself at ease in\r\na land of liberty in the presence of a scion of the illustrious House\r\nof Brunswick. I appeal, Sir, with confidence for your countenance in\r\nthe duties with which I am charged at your Majesty's Court, and I pray\r\nthat your Majesty will be pleased to accept the homage of my profound\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n   _Speech addressed by_ H.I.M. _the_ CZAR NICOLAS _to the\r\n   Municipality of Warsaw on October 10, 1835._[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] This speech first appeared in the _National_. The _Moniteur_\r\n  reproduced it some days later.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN, I know that you wished to speak to me, and I even know the\r\ncontents of the speech you proposed to make. It is in order to save\r\nyou from uttering a lie that I do not allow that speech to be\r\nmade--Yes, Gentlemen, a lie--for I know that your sentiments are not\r\nwhat you would have me believe. How could I believe you whose language\r\non the eve of the Revolution was the same? Was it not you who five\r\nyears since, aye eight years since, talked to me of your fidelity and\r\ndevotion, and made the finest protestations? Before a fortnight had\r\ngone you broke your oaths and committed the most atrocious crimes.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Alexander, who did more for you than an Emperor of Russia\r\nshould have done, was recompensed with the blackest ingratitude. You\r\nhave never been content with your position, however advantageous it\r\nhas been made for you, and you have ended by destroying your own\r\nhappiness--I am telling you the truth as this is the first time that I\r\nhave had occasion to see you since the late troubles. Deeds,\r\nGentlemen, are required, not words. Repentance must come from the\r\nheart. I am speaking without heat; you see that I am calm: I bear you\r\nno malice and I will do you good in spite of yourselves.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal here is carrying out my intentions and assisting me in my\r\nplans; he too is concerning himself with your welfare. (_Here the\r\nmembers of the deputation bowed to the Marshal_). Well, Gentlemen,\r\nwhat do these bows mean? Before all things you must do your duty and\r\nbehave like decent people. You have to choose one of two courses,\r\neither to persist in your illusions about the independence of Poland,\r\nor to live quietly like faithful subjects under my government.\r\n\r\nIf you are obstinate enough to go on dreaming of a separate\r\nnationality, of an independent Poland and chimeras of that kind the\r\nonly possible result will be that you will bring disaster on your own\r\nheads. I have built a fortress here and I assure you that on the\r\nslightest symptom of revolt I will have the town bombarded. I will\r\ndestroy Warsaw, and most assuredly it will not be I who will rebuild\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is very painful to me to speak to you thus. It is very painful for\r\nany sovereign to have to address his subjects in such terms; but I do\r\nso for your good. Your business, Gentlemen, is to labour to deserve\r\nthat the past should be forgotten, and it is only by your devotion to\r\nmy government that you can achieve this.\r\n\r\nI know that correspondence is carried on with foreign countries and\r\nthat malignant persons are sent here to pervert you. But with the best\r\npolice in the world clandestine relations cannot be altogether\r\nsuppressed on a frontier like yours. You must yourselves act as police\r\nfor the suppression of the evil. Bring up your children well and\r\ninculcate good principles of religion and fidelity to their sovereign,\r\nand you will have no difficulty in keeping the right road.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all the troubles which are agitating Europe and all\r\nthe theories which threaten the fabric of society, Russia alone stands\r\nfirm and intact. Believe me, gentlemen, it is a piece of real good\r\nfortune to belong to her and to enjoy her protection. If you behave\r\nwell and fulfil all your duties my paternal solicitude will be\r\nextended to you all, and in spite of all that has passed my government\r\nwill constantly study your welfare.\r\n\r\nThink well of what I have said to you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF THE NAMES OF PERSONS MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n  ABERCROMBY, George Ralph (1800-1852).
