Others again are hitherto unpublished. To\r\nthe Editors of those journals in which his work has appeared the author\r\nwishes to express his gratitude and acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI happen to frequent Captain Berkeley’s company on the cricket field.\r\nWhen he is there, and the wicket is bumpy, it might suitably be called\r\na stricken field. He bowls very fast and very straight.\r\n\r\nAs his publisher usually keeps wicket for him, I dare not suggest that\r\nthe crooked ones go for four byes. In any event that parallel would\r\nnot be necessary here; but the general characteristics of Captain\r\nBerkeley’s bowling are certainly in evidence. He goes direct at his\r\nobject, and when he hits it the middle stump whirls rapidly in the air.\r\nHe is all for hitting the wicket; slip catches and cunningly arranged\r\nchances to cover are not for him. This blunt going for the main point\r\nit is that gives his parodies their greatest charm. I like it when\r\nI see a reference to “Count Puffendorff Seidlitz, the Megalomanian\r\nMinister”: if we are being funny, why not laugh aloud instead of merely\r\ntittering? “Lord Miasma” pleases me as a coinage full of meaning in\r\nthese days; there is a refreshing lack of compromise about the name of\r\nthe Galsworthy parson, “The Rev. Hardy Heavyweight”; and how better\r\ncould one name two of Sir James Barrie’s minor characters than by\r\nthe twin appellations of McVittie and Price, who here take, as they\r\nelsewhere give, the biscuit? This agreeable couple appear in one of the\r\nmock plays which, to one reader at least, seem to be the very best\r\npart of this very miscellaneous volume. Captain Berkeley is himself a\r\nsuccessful playwright, and dog has here very entertainingly eaten dog.\r\nMr. Galsworthy’s passion for abstract titles; his hostile preoccupation\r\nwith the normal sporting man; his agonised sympathy with maltreated\r\nwomen; his determination to load the dice against his heroines: all\r\nthese things are made clear in language very like his own, and yet in a\r\nway that suggests (to return to our imagery) that the bowler, however\r\nfast and determined, has a respect for the batsman. I don’t know that\r\nit is quite fair to ascribe “the Manchester Drama” especially to Mr.\r\nSt. John Ervine or even to Manchester; but we know the type, and if a\r\nfew more blows like this will kill it, so much the better. It is well\r\nenough to be harrowed in the theatre, but not to be made to feel as\r\nthough we had chronic dyspepsia. The Russian Drama is beautifully apt;\r\nand “The Slayboy of the Western World” also. They reproduce idioms and\r\nmannerisms perfectly, and exhibit limitations unanswerably.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most refreshing thing about this book is its diversity. It\r\nis an age (excluding the merely vulgarly versatile) of specialists and\r\nspecialist labels. A man is not expected to see life whole, much less\r\nsteadily; he is encouraged to describe himself as “poet,” “parodist,”\r\n“politician,” “business man” or what not; and it is regarded as almost\r\nimproper that a person who takes an interest in Synge should so much\r\nas admit a knowledge of Mr. Winston Churchill’s existence. Captain\r\nBerkeley refuses to subject himself to any such limitations. He surveys\r\neverything around him, and where he sees anything he thinks funny, he\r\nhas a go at it. This should not be regarded--any more than Canning’s\r\nsquibs were regarded--as militating against his trustworthiness as\r\na politician. Rather the reverse. A knowledge of humanity and the\r\nhumanities is serviceable in legislation and administration, and a\r\nsense of humour usually goes with the sense which is called common.\r\n\r\n                                                           J.

In the\r\nprevious December, with the fullest concurrence of the First Air Lord\r\nand the Board of Aerial Operations, I had planned a lightning raid\r\non the planet of Venus to be carried out by our obsolete comets. The\r\npolitical situation has so important a bearing upon this project that\r\nI must here interpolate a memorandum which, as long before as the\r\nprevious July, I had addressed to the Secretary of State for Extra\r\nPlanetary Affairs and circulated to my colleagues.\r\n\r\n _Memorandum._\r\n\r\n _Mr. Chortill to the Extra Planetary Secretary._\r\n\r\n I can no longer preserve silence on the subject of Venus. Venusian\r\n hostility may quite well be fatal to the whole grand operation which\r\n we and our planetary allies are at present co-ordinating against\r\n the Central Planets. The grip of Mars upon Venus is unquestionably\r\n tightening; and, if no intervention is undertaken, but, on the\r\n contrary, the spirit of _laissez-faire_ is allowed to prevail, we\r\n shall not only lose a strong potential adherent, but, which is equally\r\n important, also forfeit considerable sympathy amongst our own people.\r\n The plan of the Martians is quite plain. Availing themselves of that\r\n well-known astronomical phenomenon--the Transit of Venus--they will\r\n undoubtedly utilise that period of uncertainty to detach this wavering\r\n planet from our cause and bind her irrevocably to themselves. That\r\n would be nothing short of a disaster.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, knowing his difficulties in coping with the tasks of\r\nhis office, I instructed the faithful Smashterton Jones to convey the\r\nfollowing message to the Prime Minister himself:\r\n\r\n _Mr. Chortill to the Prime Minister._\r\n\r\n I am seriously exercised in my mind about Jupiter. I fear that, by\r\n confining ourselves to the narrow requirements of tactical gain, we\r\n are neglecting inter-planetary strategy. Do, I beg you, consider this\r\n point. If Jupiter can be induced--I don’t suggest that this proposal\r\n is necessarily the best, but, let us say, by the offer of one or both\r\n of the rings of Saturn under a Mandate of the League of Planets--if\r\n Jupiter could in this or some other manner be induced to take an\r\n active part, at least in the aerial blockade to cut off from the\r\n Central Planets the communication which at present they enjoy outside\r\n the Solar System, there is no doubt but that the conflict would be\r\n sensibly shortened, and it might make a difference of centuries. I\r\n enclose a Memorandum on Venus which I have sent to the Extra Planetary\r\n Secretary, and upon which I should value your remarks.\r\n\r\n  W. S. C.\r\n\r\nReverting now to the plan for an aerial raid on the planet of Venus.\r\nWe had the old comets, quite ineffective for operations against the\r\nmajor Planets, but powerful and not at all to be despised; we had a\r\nsatisfactory surplus of meteors which could be employed in support;\r\nand we had in addition the newly constructed, and in all respects\r\nnovel, planetary battering-ram, specially designed for jarring, or,\r\nas the technical word is, “boosting” heavenly bodies out of their\r\norbits--the apple of the eye of old Lord Krusher and the Board of\r\nAerial Construction. This formidable engine, unique, as we were led to\r\nbelieve, in the whole stellar universe, must in any case carry out her\r\ntrials somewhere, and might as well be utilised in toppling a potential\r\nantagonist out of our path, instead of being sent to the Milky Way for\r\nthe usual two months’ test. So much for material. Of trained personnel\r\nwe had, though not an abundance, a reasonable margin. Only one thing\r\nseemed to baffle the mighty war mind of old Lord Krusher and our\r\nexperts--a satisfactory jumping-off place. Accordingly, the day before\r\nthe Cabinet met, I dictated the following:--\r\n\r\n _First Lord to the First Air Lord._\r\n\r\n Referring to our conversation with regard to the Venus Striking Force,\r\n and the necessity for a jumping-off place, has it occurred to you that\r\n the Mountains of the Moon are in every way adapted for this purpose?\r\n A force of comets and meteors with the necessary reserves, L. of C.\r\n troops, etc., based upon this strategic point, not only dominates the\r\n principal airways and traffic routes, but points a spear directly at\r\n the heart of the enemy. Request therefore that you will examine this\r\n proposition, and, in conjunction with Aerial Operations, furnish me\r\n immediately with an estimate of the material, plant, etc., required to\r\n convert these natural fastnesses into a suitable base.\r\n\r\n  W. S. C.\r\n\r\nTo this he replied in a characteristic letter:--\r\n\r\n Trusty and well-beloved Winsom,\r\n\r\n Your plan is, like yourself, marvellous! Nobody but you could have\r\n thought of it. I could turn the Mountains of the Moon into the base\r\n you require in forty-eight hours, but for one overriding difficulty,\r\n which your memorandum does not meet. There is no AIR on the Moon, my\r\n Winsom, and human beings being what they are, _air is necessary_ IF\r\n THEY ARE NOT TO PERISH.\r\n\r\n Only THREE things are necessary to win the war: _air_, SPEED, and\r\n GUTS. I have got the last, you are providing the second, but where are\r\n we to get the AIR?\r\n\r\n _Skegness?_\r\n\r\n We had better try the Valley of the Dry Bones instead, if the\r\n archæologists can find it for us. Failing that, Sinbad’s cavern.\r\n\r\n  Yours till Ginger pops,\r\n\r\n  KRUSHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of thoughtless criticism to which I was occasionally\r\nsubjected by the old air-dog.[1] Magnificent in his courage, more often\r\nright than wrong, a splendid example of British brain-power, there\r\nwere times when he made the error of estimating other people’s mental\r\ncapacity by his own. Time was pressing, so I wirelessed the following\r\nreply:--\r\n\r\n  _First Lord to First Air Lord_:\r\n\r\n  TAKE SUPPLY OF OXYGEN IN CANISTERS,\r\n\r\nwhich settled the matter. Alas! I was to discover later that this\r\ntoo speedy resolution of his difficulties was merely to succeed in\r\nantagonising the bluff old warrior against the whole project.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great Council of the Allied Planets met, and it became\r\nall too apparent that the operations, as a whole, were being pursued\r\nwith even more than our customary hesitation and delay. The Archangel\r\nGabriel, an excellent First Minister in times of peace, was beginning\r\nto give unmistakable signs of being too old and slow-witted for his\r\nwork. Since his well-remembered and highly successful controversy with\r\nLucifer, some æons before, his powers had been steadily waning; and\r\nit was speedily becoming apparent that he had no longer the mental\r\nalertness and vigour of body for a prolonged campaign conducted under\r\nthe stress of modern conditions. At times--as, for instance, over the\r\nthunderbolt shortage--he would arouse himself to prodigious efforts,\r\nequalling, if not outstripping, his ancient prowess. And then he would\r\nfall into always increasing periods of apathy, from which there was no\r\nextracting him.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances I wrote the following memorandum:--\r\n\r\n _Memorandum by the Rt. Hon. Winsom Stunster Chortill on the general\r\n situation_:\r\n\r\n We have now been at war for forty-three years and eleven days. A\r\n prodigious expenditure of blood and treasure has so far secured for us\r\n no material advantage. The essential services are suffering from lack\r\n of co-ordination. Much valuable energy is being wasted in duplication\r\n of effort.\r\n\r\n I have indicated in the accompanying appendices (36 in number)\r\n detailed plans for a change of policy on all the fronts, and I attach\r\n also an additional memorandum with 7 sequellæ, 41 maps and a detailed\r\n schedule of supplies, dealing with the political situation likely to\r\n arise on the Transit of Venus, and outlining a scheme of operations\r\n for immediate consideration and adoption.\r\n\r\n After all these years it becomes necessary to say that the Allied\r\n cause is suffering from a want of decision. As each new problem arises\r\n we seem to be more and more unprepared. This cannot be indefinitely\r\n prolonged, and only one sensible solution presents itself--namely,\r\n that the control of all policy, operations and forces should be\r\n centred under one hand. Modesty forbids the suggestion that the\r\n serious crisis in our national fortunes demands that I should indicate\r\n myself as the most suitable person to have charge of this enterprise;\r\n but if consulted I should be willing to express my opinion on the\r\n matter.\r\n\r\n  W. S. C.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the most fateful of my life, I was unable to\r\nresist a foreboding that things were not yet destined to go right for\r\nthe Allied cause. The careful records I had kept of my administration\r\nsatisfied me, as I looked through them, that for all I had done I could\r\nassure myself of the approval of posterity. We had created, equipped\r\nand maintained a gigantic aerial machine. No hostile forces had so\r\nmuch as come within sight of our planet. My further schemes, to which\r\nI had applied every existing intellectual test, made us reasonably\r\ncertain of a speedy result; and I left my room and strode across to the\r\nCouncil with a conviction in my heart that I could carry through my\r\nproposals--and yet with a haunting fear of the unexpected. On arriving\r\nat the Council Chamber my forebodings became heavier. The proceedings\r\nwere of a most perfunctory nature. All controversial business was\r\nadjourned to a later meeting, and we were informed that a crisis made\r\nit necessary for the head of the Government to demand the resignations\r\nof his entire Ministry. With a heavy heart I parted with the insignia\r\nof my office, realising, as I did so, that the struggle must now be\r\nindefinitely prolonged. The head of the Government, animated by that\r\nspirit of kindliness towards myself which he had ever shown, pressed me\r\nto accept a gilded sinecure. With every wish to avoid giving him pain I\r\nfelt myself obliged to decline. Posterity, he told me, would appreciate\r\nmy zeal in the public service.\r\n\r\nPosterity, I felt to myself, as I left the building, would, thanks to\r\nmy diaries, at least understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] A kind of Skye terrier.--W.

The lad was singularly unprepossessing; he\r\nsquinted, his right shoulder was strangely deformed, and his ears\r\nwere much too large for his head. Unlike most children in receipt of\r\nflattering attentions from an elderly and distinguished stranger, he\r\nsnarled, spat on the ground, and hurried away muttering oaths. The\r\nastonished relatives of the traveller, hurrying out in pursuit of\r\nhim--in the belief, as the wife said afterwards, that he was suddenly\r\ndemented--found their husband and parent almost beside himself with\r\nexcitement. “That boy,” he said, pointing towards the receding figure\r\na hand that shook with emotion--“that boy will end as Prime Minister\r\nof England.” Convinced that his mind was wandering, they led him back\r\nwith soothing words to the hotel; but his unerring judgment was once\r\nagain to be confirmed by the verdict of time. The speaker was Dr.\r\nQuank Brane, the eminent psychologist; the boy, soon to be known to\r\nthe greater part of the universe, equally for the profundity of his\r\nwisdom and the variety of his gifts and achievements, was Erasmus\r\nGalileo McCann, philosopher, scientist, theologian, naval and military\r\nstrategist, scholar, economist and some time First Minister of the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nThe boyhood of this monument of versatile genius, no less than his\r\nmanhood, was remarkable. At the age of one, when dropped by his nurse,\r\na fact which accounted for the deformity of his shoulder, he was\r\ndistinctly heard, as if in anticipation of his interjectional habits\r\nof later life, to rip out an accusing oath; and, when the startled\r\nslattern turned up her hands and eyes in horror, he added, “Don’t\r\nstare like a fool, go and get the doctor!” At three years old his\r\nfather presented him with all the volumes of Buckle’s _History of\r\nCivilisation_, which he had completely mastered before he was five.\r\nHis dissertation of _The Lesser Cists in Invertebrates_, published at\r\nthe age of seven, is still a standard work of this little known branch\r\nof biological science. Many years later an old friend of the family\r\ntold an admiring conclave of relatives of an encounter with the young\r\nMcCann, in which he himself was considerably worsted. In the course of\r\na journey across the Warraboora plains, a wild and almost uninhabited\r\ntract of country, his provisions gave out. Some friendly natives whom\r\nhe encountered contrived to spare him a few dried corn cobs, but these\r\ncould hardly last him indefinitely. Starvation stared him in the face.\r\nOne day, however, as he was making a frugal meal of a large aboriginal\r\nlizard, that he found entangled in the undergrowth, a strange urchin\r\ndropped on his head from out of a tree fern, uttering savage whoops,\r\ntore the carcass from his astonished fingers, and devoured it without a\r\nword of apology.\r\n\r\n“That,” said the older man with resignation, “was my last morsel of\r\nfood. I must now die.”\r\n\r\n“_Je n’en vois pas la nécessité_,” returned the youth (it was McCann),\r\nquoting La Rochefoucauld with the nonchalance of complete familiarity;\r\nwherewith he swung himself into the branches of a Kauri pine, and\r\ndisappeared without another word. Giving himself up for lost, the\r\nlonely traveller prepared for death; but before nightfall the youth\r\nreturned with a wallet of provender, and accompanied by guides who\r\npiloted them back to civilisation. The boy appeared blissfully unaware\r\nthat he had done anything remarkable. “Such astonishing sang-froid,”\r\nthe traveller used to conclude, “I never encountered before or since. I\r\nknew he was destined for greatness.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis schooldays and college life were curiously uneventful. He secured\r\nthe uncoveted distinction of remaining at the bottom of the bottom\r\nform of the school for three years, and of failing ignominiously in\r\nthe Cambridge Junior Local. Wiseacres shook their heads and quoted\r\nscores of instances of infantile precocity. It began to look as\r\nthough the early promise was after all no more than a false dawn; and\r\nthen, to everyone’s astonishment, at the age of 19½ he planned,\r\nfinanced and brought out _The People’s Piffle_, a daily journal\r\nexactly corresponding to the literary appetites of the masses of the\r\nBritish reading public. Among other novel features of this newspaper,\r\nalternative opinions were presented in parallel columns on the leader\r\npage, the appointment of the editor was subject to confirmation or\r\nchange every three months by a referendum of the readers, and, in place\r\nof the obsolete insurances against accident, continued subscription for\r\na period of 25 years or longer conferred a pensionable right upon the\r\nsubscriber.\r\n\r\nSo momentous a development in the literary activities of the country\r\ncreated a profound impression. More than one well-known actress sent\r\nhim her autograph unsolicited. A film star was heard to refer to him\r\nas “some guy.” The Prime Minister of the day shook hands with him\r\nin public. Lord Thundercliffe shook in his shoes, and redoubled\r\nhis fulminating denunciations of everything. But the day of Lord\r\nThundercliffe was over: a new era was at hand, the era of universal\r\ngenius; and McCann, its prophet and its leader, was even then poising\r\nhimself on the crest of the wave that was to sweep away the wreckage\r\nof the old century, and sweep in the reforms of the new, and sweep him\r\npersonally into a position of eminence hitherto unknown in our annals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust at about this time a resident at Claydamp-on-the-Wash was\r\nastonished, in the course of a country walk, to see a tall, thin\r\ngentleman leaning over a gate in an attitude of insupportable\r\ndejection. The enormous brogues; the ill-fitting brown suit; the\r\nhigh-domed forehead; the bushy brown spade beard; the huge spectacles\r\nperched on the lofty sensitive nose; the dreamy eyes looking far away\r\ninto the mists, all suggested a certain literary personage. Could it\r\nbe? Was it possible? Overcoming a natural hesitation at intruding\r\nupon the privacy of one who was obviously a recluse, he hesitatingly\r\nventured to approach. “I beg your pardon,” he said, “but surely I am\r\naddressing Mr. Lytton Strachey?” and without giving the stranger time\r\nto answer he added, “Is anything the matter? Can I help in any way?”\r\n\r\nThe solitary turned upon him eyes that were suffused with tears.\r\n“Oh, no,” he replied, “no. Nothing. I was born too early, that is\r\nall.” And on being pressed for a further explanation he continued,\r\n“By the ordinary processes of Nature I must inevitably predecease\r\nthis monstrosity of talent; and I am excluded from the possibility of\r\nwriting the only Georgian biography that offers any kind of scope for\r\nmy abilities.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was of politics; and he was not of politics. He built up abstract\r\ntheories of Government in his articles in the morning Press: and\r\ndemolished them in the evening in his speeches in the House of Commons.\r\nHe attracted the sympathies of simple folk by a life of Spartan\r\ndiscipline; and disgusted them by a profuse and shameless bestowal of\r\npeerages and honours. He angled for the votes of the mercenary and\r\nidle by a wholesale creation of state benevolences; and threw away\r\nwhat he had gained by an almost niggardly supervision and husbandry of\r\nthe national income. As Controller and chief proprietor of the great\r\nPress Trust, he denounced the infamies and exactions of the great\r\nprofiteering combines in which he himself was the principal partner:\r\nand as Prime Minister of a secular Government he disestablished the\r\nChurch of which he, as Cardinal Archbishop, was the protesting head.\r\nWriting at about this time Count Puffendorff Seidlitz, the Megalomanian\r\nAmbassador, reported to his Government that it was perfectly vain to\r\ncherish the slightest hope of undermining the national popularity\r\nof one who so supremely embodied in himself the qualities, and the\r\ninconsistencies, and the portentous humbug that chiefly characterised\r\nthe nation of which he was the head. Nothing could be done at present.\r\nAbove all there must be no haste. “But I do not despair,” he added,\r\n“for, though ignorant of music, the man has a certain coarse feeling\r\nfor the arts--and that, in a country of Philistines, must in the long\r\nrun betray him into our hands.”\r\n\r\nFatal self-complacency! At the very moment when those words were being\r\npenned, McCann was--where? He was in the anteroom of the Princess\r\nVodkha, that luckless Ambassador’s sovereign, waiting to seal with a\r\ncourtly handclasp the Trade Agreement between Megalomania and this\r\ncountry. Poor Count Puffendorff Seidlitz! Where Lord Thundercliffe and\r\nhis brother Lord Miasma has failed, it was hardly to be supposed that\r\nhe would succeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo ended, in a thin filmy haze, a life of service and sacrament. To\r\nthe very end they thought he might be saved. The general public,\r\nbrought suddenly to the realisation of the approaching calamity, stood\r\ndumbly in the streets, or hurried away--hoping. But the sands were\r\nrunning down; the tide, long since turned, was ebbing with inexorable\r\nswiftness; the night was indeed at hand. A greater and more terrible\r\naccuser than Lord Thundercliffe hovered over the sick man’s bed; and a\r\ngreater and wiser Judge than public opinion was waiting to pronounce\r\nthe verdict from which there is no appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FIRST DERBY\r\n\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “as a matter of fact I’ve never been to the Derby--and to\r\ntell you the truth----” I went on.\r\n\r\nHe winced. He did not want me to tell him the truth. If the truth was\r\n(as it was) that I didn’t care two cassowary’s eggs whether I went to\r\nthe Derby or not, that was the very last thing he desired to hear. He\r\nwanted to keep his opinion of me as unimpaired by such idiosyncrasies,\r\nas I would permit. These thoughts rippled over the mild surface of his\r\nfeatures like gusts of wind across the waters of a pond. I allowed the\r\nwords to die away in my throat. After all, to give pain flagrantly--\r\n\r\n“Promise me,” he urged, “p-p-promise me you’ll take a day off and go\r\nto-morrow. It’s one of the sights of the world. The Downs black with\r\npeople----”\r\n\r\n“Black?” I murmured, “surely not in this heat?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, covered with people then, stiff with people, crowded for\r\nmiles and miles with millions and millions of all classes in the\r\nland----”\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear,” I said, “first, second, _and_ third!”\r\n\r\nHe ignored this miserable attempt at buffoonery.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he averred, “all classes in the land, thimble-rigging, cocoanut\r\nshying, confidence tricking, eating, drinking, laughing, cheering.\r\nVehicles of all sorts, shapes, sizes, motive power, blocking all the\r\nroads in the neighbourhood. And the horses, my dear boy, the horses!\r\nUntil you’ve seen those horses, trained to a hair, with coats like\r\nsatin, ready to run for their lives, why, you simply haven’t seen\r\nanything. And the crowd in the paddock. You _must_ see the crowd in the\r\npaddock. _And_ the bookies. No man’s lived, till he’s been done down on\r\nthe Downs. Now promise me faithfully----”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said hurriedly to forestall the otherwise inevitable\r\nrepetition, “I promise....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was rather fun, I admit. From the moment when the wheel-barrow on\r\nwhich, apparently, I had made the journey in the company of a Zulu\r\nchief, Lady Diana Manners, Mr. Justice Salter, and a dear little Eskimo\r\ngirl aged seven, drew up at Boulter’s Lock--no, no--not Boulter’s\r\nLock--Tattenham Corner, I knew I was in for one of the great days of my\r\nlife. There, glittering in the sunlight in all its pristine colouring,\r\nstood the brand-new Tattenham Corner House, erected for the occasion\r\nby Sir Joseph Lyons himself, who, with Lord Howard de Walden on one\r\nside of him and the Prime Minister on the other, stood in the doorway\r\nreceiving his guests. A prodigious negro, with an unexpectedly small\r\nvoice, announced me (for some reason) as “Mr. Mallaby Deeley,” and I\r\nfound myself walking on a vast deep verandah, laid out with innumerable\r\nlittle luncheon tables, through which a long procession of horses was\r\nintricately manœuvring.\r\n\r\n“The paddock,” murmured my Zulu companion. “It’s an idea of Sir\r\nJoseph’s. The combination of a sit-down luncheon and form at a glance.\r\nExtraordinarily convenient.”\r\n\r\nWe sat down at a table. Immediately a jockey and his horse sat down\r\nopposite to us.\r\n\r\n“Order us a drink each, dearie,” said the jockey, “it’s a fearful\r\nbusiness this perambulatin’ about; and you get nothing for it. Eh? Oh,\r\ngin for _’er_, and I’ll take a glass o’ port.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your young friend’s name?” enquired the judge, suddenly\r\nputting his head from under the table.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the jockey, knowingly, “that ’ud be telling, that would.” He\r\ntapped his nose mysteriously and drank.\r\n\r\n“But, my good sir,” complained the judge, “how can I back your horse if\r\nI don’t know its name?”\r\n\r\n“By the process of elimination,” said the jockey sagely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Done down on the Downs.”]\r\n\r\n“Elimination,” said the judge, “what of?”\r\n\r\n“Yourself,” said the jockey; and his mount choked coyly in her glass.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the King appeared, followed by Aristotle, Sir Thomas\r\nBeecham, and others.\r\n\r\n“The next race is about to begin,” he said severely, “and you’ve none\r\nof you brushed your hair.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before I found the bookmaker. Any number of spurious\r\nones rose up in my path and taunted me; but He always escaped. At last\r\nI thought of looking under one of the thimbles; and there he was in\r\ndeep calculation.\r\n\r\n“What price Poltergeist?” I demanded. I wanted to say Psychology, but\r\nthe word somehow refused to shape itself.\r\n\r\n“It all depends,” he replied shrewdly, “on whether you want to buy or\r\nto sell,” wherewith he crossed his legs, smiled on only one side of his\r\nface, and returned to his calculations.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you a bookmaker?” I faltered.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he cried shrilly, “and I’m making a book now, can’t you\r\nsee?” He held up a kind of primitive loose-leaf ledger, made of calico\r\npages bound in sheepskin.\r\n\r\n“Very durable,” he explained, and broke into a harsh chant:\r\n\r\n    “If I lay sevens and fours\r\n       And you take fives and threes--\r\n     What do they care for gaming laws,\r\n       Who have not felt the squeeze,\r\n     Who sacrifice the world’s applause\r\n       And gain ignoble ease?\r\n\r\n     With odds laid off or on,\r\n       And prices up or down----”\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly and rose to his feet. The miscellany in his lap\r\nwas scattered upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“Pick up my work-basket,” he exclaimed, “and give me the kaleidoscope,”\r\nI handed him the strange black instrument at which he was pointing, and\r\nbegan groping on my knees among the pins and needles. He turned towards\r\nthe sun, and gazed at it through the object in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Look out,” he exclaimed suddenly, “they’re off.”\r\n\r\nSimultaneously a voice near me said, “The King’s calling you,” and I\r\nbegan to run. Immediately the hounds were slipped from the leash, and\r\nthe hunt settled down in my wake. The ship began to sway from side to\r\nside, and the roaring grew louder and louder. Still I ran, flashing\r\npast the booths, past upturned umbrellas with cards scattered over\r\nthem, past the stewards’ enclosure, past the Royal Box. The thundering\r\ngrew louder and more insistent. I was flying along the track with the\r\nwhole field plunging after me. Hoarse cries. I redouble my efforts. My\r\nhead is going to burst. The Royal Box whizzes past again. The winning\r\npost. I’m falling....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA long time afterwards, a voice said:\r\n\r\n“He’s quite all right. A touch of heat-stroke is nothing, really, you\r\nknow. Quiet. Couple of days in bed.”\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes.\r\n\r\n“Sir Joseph Lyons----” I began.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the doctor, “you shut up.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve promised to go to the Derby,” I protested.\r\n\r\n“Next year,” replied the doctor. “Just drink this, will you?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ETERNAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody--a certain Dr. Friedenberg to be truthful--has thrown out\r\nsuggestions of the dreadful possibility of indefinitely prolonging\r\nthe human existence; in fact of bringing about a kind of mundane\r\nimmortality. Hair is to be made to grow upon bald heads (no, mine\r\nis not bald); short men will increase in stature by several inches;\r\nand fat men will become slender and graceful. The last is perhaps an\r\nattractive prospect. Wait. Tell me this.\r\n\r\nWho wants to live for ever? And having disposed of that pertinent\r\nquestion, in the affirmative if you will, who wants his neighbour to\r\nlive for ever?\r\n\r\nWho wants to stereotype the control of human affairs in the hands that\r\nfind it so difficult to control them? What becomes of young ideas, new\r\nmovements and general progress, in a universe of bald pates thatched,\r\nshort men grown taller and corpulence made small? For in all this one\r\nhears nothing about recharging the brain; and bodily vigour does little\r\nto stave off mental paralysis of the kind that usually comes on with\r\nage. Would flowing hair and graceful figure countervail the growth of\r\navarice, deceit and malice; or check the relentless march of stupidity?\r\nWould it not rather be the case, that from year to year all the more\r\nunpleasant of human characteristics would intensify and harden?\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, think of the population of this miserable little\r\nglobe in a thousand years or so. Nobody dies. We all live and multiply\r\nfor eternity. It increases by geometric progression. To-day we are,\r\nlet us say, a paltry thousand million of people. In a year’s time, at\r\na conservative estimate, we should double our population. In a few\r\nhundred years--good heavens! Life would become like the platform of\r\nPiccadilly Circus at six o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nPiccadilly! This subject is inextricably bound up in my mind with\r\nPiccadilly. I will explain why.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, when musing upon Dr. Friedenberg’s discoveries, I had\r\noccasion to use the railway of that name. I boarded a crowded train,\r\nthinking deeply. I took my place (most incautiously, I admit, but there\r\nhappened to be no other place to take) standing beside a forbidding\r\nmilitary gentleman, whose arms were full of brown paper parcels. In the\r\nimmediate vicinity stood a large stern woman, solidly planted near the\r\ndoor, who disdained the help of the strap and supported herself, with\r\narms akimbo and legs wide apart.\r\n\r\nThe train ran smoothly enough through Dover Street and Down Street, and\r\nmy line of thought, on this problem of perpetual life, developed into\r\na kind of saga to the rhythm of the movement over the rails. The whole\r\nsubject went before my eyes like a glorious vision. I knew just what I\r\nwas going to say in this essay....\r\n\r\nAnd then the train back-jumped, and the large stern woman, in the\r\neffort to retain her balance, planted one of her feet with relentless\r\nprecision, exactly on one of mine, and simultaneously drove her\r\nright elbow into my ribs. In really considerable agony I recoiled,\r\ninvoluntarily loosening my grip of the supporting strap. Immediately\r\nthe train swerved, and threw me into the bosom of the military\r\ngentleman, whose armful of parcels burst from his control and smothered\r\nthe occupants of the neighbouring seats. Muttering imprecations, he\r\ncrouched on the swaying floor and began to pick them up. I stooped to\r\nhelp him; and our heads met with a grinding crash....\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the woman--the--the unspeakable monster who had caused the\r\ncalamity, stood entirely unmoved, gazing through the glass doors at the\r\nconductor.\r\n\r\nThink of such a person going down through all eternity committing\r\noutrages of this kind--probably one a day. Eternal life? Penal\r\nservitude for life is more to her deserving.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] I except, of course, Drigg, Bootlecut, Volmer, and their\r\ninsignificant following.\r\n\r\n[3] _The Psychology of Post-Metempsychosis._ J. Swift Leggitt. The\r\nMangy Press. 5s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT WAR--AND MILITARY SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia and Germany have joined hands; France and Belgium have banded\r\ntogether; Italy has made a secret treaty with the Kemalists--a fact\r\nwhich can hardly afford much satisfaction to the kingdom of Serbs,\r\nCroats, and Slovenes, leave alone the Greeks! Poland and her neighbours\r\nare on much the same terms of cordiality as rival opera singers. There\r\nis Bessarabia; there is (so to call it for convenience) Germania\r\nIrridenta; there is the Burgenland; all simmering merrily away. There\r\nare heartburnings in Transylvania. I cannot think that even the Sanjak\r\nis really placid--it has always wallowed in grievances from time\r\nimmemorial. Indeed (so I am told), it needs but a spark to set the\r\nwhole contraption in a blaze. Only a spark!... We are sitting on a wood\r\npile soaked in petrol; and the boys at Paris and elsewhere are out with\r\ntheir tinder-boxes.\r\n\r\nViewed from one point of view, this situation has arisen very\r\nappositely to certain investigations conducted not long ago by _The\r\nTimes_, and provides a capital solution to the problems of how to find\r\ncareers for our sons, and what to do with our daughters. But there are\r\nsome of us[2] to whom even the satisfaction of starting our children in\r\n(or rather out of) the world, would be but a poor recompense for the\r\nphysical discomfort (it’s not the danger; we none of us mind _danger_;\r\nwe rather like it) of resuming active hostilities ourselves. As Leggitt\r\nsays[3]: “Danger I scorn; but discomfort is the parent of anxiety; and\r\nanxiety is the handmaid of despair.” That’s good enough for me.\r\n\r\nBesides, wars are not what they were. The last war was, to a great\r\nextent, won, and the next war will be entirely won, behind the lines.\r\n“Lord Northcliffe,” says a military historian[4] in his article on war\r\nin the Encyclopædia, “Lord Northcliffe dealt heavier blows than Haig.\r\nHaig hit harder than Rawlinson, Rawlinson than Godley, and Godley\r\n(through a long string of intermediary Blenkinsops and Chislehursts)\r\nthan Private Muggins. In fact, the whole lesson of the war was that\r\nMuggins didn’t matter twopennyworth of gin. The further back you were,\r\nthe more you could do. If Captain Slogger, the Company Commander,\r\nstopped one--why, anybody else could carry on. But if the R.T.O.’s\r\nclerk at the base went down with writer’s cramp, the repercussions\r\nmight be felt all over Europe. And in the next war....” And so on.\r\n\r\nPush this to its logical conclusion and what do you find? An entirely\r\nnew conception of the theory of national service. The duty of every\r\nman, with love of country in his heart, is to fit himself to play a\r\nfar-reaching, noble, and adequate part in the next war--from a distance\r\nat which brains will really tell. As Sir Cuthbert puts it, “The duty\r\nof the soldiers of the future is to consolidate the front behind the\r\nfront.” No mawkish sentimental considerations should interfere with the\r\nattainment of this. “If others have to fall in the front line, drop a\r\ntear, good citizen, or if you feel so disposed, drop two tears. But for\r\nthe sake of your country, and its final victory in the struggle, _see\r\nto it that you are not the one who falls_.”\r\n\r\nI will. I will see to it with punctilious care. It is my duty; and I\r\nshall discharge it with the same devotion as I displayed in the last\r\nwar, when I rose from assistant warehouse clerk (graded as bombardier)\r\nin the E.F.C. receiving shed, via R.T.O.’s clerk at Boulavre (graded as\r\nStaff Sergeant of Musketry), assistant press censor (graded as Squadron\r\nLeader of Cavalry with rank of Captain) and Base Commandant (graded as\r\nG.S.O. 2, but with rank of colonel on the staff and pay and allowances\r\nof a Lieutenant-General) to the proud position which I occupied at the\r\nend. I have nothing to complain of.... I cannot deny that I had all\r\nkinds of obstacles to overcome. Ignorant prejudiced fools, blind to\r\nthe interests of their country, were constantly endeavouring to comb\r\nme out. And so it will be in the next war. The earnest patriot will\r\nfind himself thwarted and misunderstood at every turn. Nothing but a\r\nknowledge of the niceties of the medical board, will avail to defeat\r\nthese busybodies. Indeed, it may at times be necessary to indulge in\r\na little pardonable deception. Thus, a cigarette soaked in laudanum,\r\nand smoked half an hour before the doctor’s examination, will produce\r\nall the symptoms of general paralysis, heart failure, and abdominal\r\ncatarrh; yet, in an hour or two at most, the smoker will have recovered\r\nmost of his faculties, and the remainder will return in, at the\r\noutside, a few days. A glass of vinegar, swallowed without deglutition,\r\nproduces the pallor of a ghost and the pulse and temperature of a\r\nlizard; yet the effects have rarely lasted longer than a week. And\r\nthere are, of course, such well-known (but to my thinking too crude)\r\nexpedients as self-inflicted wounds and even amputations.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is best, indeed, to make preparations in advance. It must\r\nnever be forgotten that a large civilian population is necessary to\r\ncarry on what are called “the essential public services.” No one should\r\ndisdain to do his duty in one of these capacities. And if, as in the\r\nlast war, the only sons of widowed mothers are to be given special\r\nconsideration, we must not hesitate to take full advantage of such a\r\nprovision. A judicious use of the knife or poison cup, or possibly\r\na combination of the two, will place many a strapping fellow in the\r\nnecessary condition of exemption.\r\n\r\nPromptski-Buzzoff, in his elaborate, but too little known, treatise\r\n“_Die Vermeidung des Kriegesdienstes_”[5] lays down that “the spinal\r\nmarrow of a nation is to be found in the conscience of its citizens.”\r\nThis is profoundly and undeniably true. The pages of history are\r\nbespattered with the fragments of empires that have disintegrated\r\nthrough the decay of their moral fibre. Every good citizen, says\r\nBuzzoff, should cultivate a conscience as inflexible as Bessemer\r\nsteel. A properly cultivated conscience will no more permit its owner\r\nto kill, or be killed, than a vacuum brake will let a train run away.\r\nIt’s automatic. You mention the word war, and there’s an instant\r\ninhibition. This kind of thing however, needs considerable preparation.\r\nIt is always open to misinterpretation if your conscience doesn’t\r\ndevelop until the outbreak of war; although that, in itself, is not\r\na consideration which ought to deter a man with the interests of his\r\ncountry at heart.\r\n\r\nMany of us, again, are indispensable. Until late in 1917, I was\r\nindispensable myself. And next time I fully intend to be indispensable\r\nall through the war. I shall get elected to some legislative body--say\r\nthe London County Council; and my devotion to duty will do the\r\nrest. But, of course, in case of mischance I shall be prepared with\r\nan alternative plan, several alternative plans in fact. And, in\r\nthe last resort, I shall place my services at the disposal of the\r\nDirector-General of Lines of Communication. After all, speaking as one\r\nwho has already fought a campaign in that capacity, one has a sense of\r\nresponsibility and power, even in the humblest posts behind the line,\r\nof which even Divisional and Corps commanders might be envious. As an\r\nR.T.O.’s assistant, one is conscious of a control over the destinies of\r\nothers, that almost partakes of divinity. A motion of the hand, a word\r\non a scrap of paper, and divisions and their baggage may be separated\r\nfor ever; provisions consigned to one country may find themselves\r\ndevoured in another; and Generals waiting to begin a battle may awake\r\non zero day to the fact that they have no forces, except their staffs,\r\nwherewith to fight.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that I offer these suggestions on the\r\nunderstanding that we find ourselves allied to a country in which\r\nthere will be some approximation, in the amenities offered to L. of\r\nC., to those enjoyed in the larger cities in France during the war.\r\nOtherwise, frankly, nothing doing! I have been studying the appendices\r\nto Splitz’s book on the Russian Army[6]; and the feeding is hardly\r\nup to what I might call a civilised war standard. Thus, on L. of C.,\r\nthe weekly ration allowance appears to be four gold roubles’ worth of\r\nstraw soup, three poods of lycopodium seed cake, and two samovars of\r\nliquorice water, together with thirty-seven foot-calories of bonemeal\r\nand a packet of spearmint--which, although it compares favourably\r\nwith the diet of Divisional and Corps Commanders in that country[7],\r\nhas but little attraction for the gourmet. And in any case what about\r\nthe residuum? After all, we can’t all of us expect _carte blanche_\r\nto send trains backwards and forwards--passed to you, please, and to\r\nyou, please, and so on. Even on the grander scale, there’ll never be\r\nroom for more than a million or so R.T.O.’s all told (and that will\r\ninclude the other side). Something’s got to be done for the rest of us.\r\nEven the L. of C. troops will be up to full strength at last. They’ll\r\nabsorb a number of millions; but they’ll fill up eventually. Even the\r\nessential public services at home can’t be swelled indefinitely. There\r\nwill come a time when everything useful has been filled up, and there\r\nare still people left over.\r\n\r\nWell, we can’t all be satisfied in this world. It was never intended\r\nthat we should. And, so far as I can see, the overplus will have to\r\nmake themselves comfortable in the trenches. It will be a galling\r\nthought to them that they’re poked away there out of everything, with\r\nno real work to do. But it doesn’t really matter, for we’ll win the war\r\nall right.\r\n\r\nWe’ll win it in spite of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Sir Cuthbert Limpitt, K.B.E., a former Director of the Ministry of\r\nMisinformation.\r\n\r\n[5] Berlin, 1921.

Then he shows it to his best friend, who obligingly\r\npoints out that the whole conception is faulty, and that the dialogue\r\nis beneath contempt. He then reads it to his second-best friend,\r\nwho wakes from his slumber greatly refreshed. By the end of a short\r\nperiod he has no friends left: but he has learnt a few of the more\r\nobvious imperfections of his work. In despair of ever reconciling\r\nthe conflicting criticisms to which it has been subjected, he posts\r\nit defiantly to Grossmith and Malone, Sir Alfred Butt, Mr. Charles\r\nCochran, Mr. Laurillard, Mr. de Courville, and the whole gang of\r\nimpresarios. It returns from each of them accompanied by a printed\r\nslip. He then slinks to the office of a dramatic agent.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic agent is a florid man with a super-silk hat. He receives\r\nthe author with the gracious condescension of royalty greeting an\r\ninferior. The author, overcome at the honour which is being conferred,\r\ngratefully deposits his precious MS. in the luxurious plush-padded\r\nbasket which is held out by an underling. The basket is reverently\r\nplaced upon the table; mutual expressions of goodwill are exchanged;\r\nthe author is bowed out.\r\n\r\nThen the dramatic agent shakes the MS. out of the basket, as though it\r\nwere verminous; pitchforks it into the recesses of a safe; locks the\r\nsafe with a loud clang, and loses the key for two years.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years Cyrus K. Bimetaller, the celebrated “Stunt”\r\nKing, visits the dramatic agent to throw in his teeth the forty-seven\r\nseparate scripts of forty-seven separate plays--but why go into this?\r\nHe says that all dealings between them are at an end, and demands his\r\naccount. The dramatic agent mechanically opens the safe to get out\r\nhis books--and there lies the neglected MS. As a last bid for fortune\r\nhe places it eloquently in the hands of Cyrus K. The latter grunts,\r\nand sprawls on the sofa to “size it up.” This process occupies five\r\nminutes. At the end of that time he remarks laconically, “This is the\r\ngoods.”\r\n\r\nThe author is now summoned from Kilimanjaro, where he is growing\r\ngrape-fruit, in order to give his assistance at rehearsals. He arrives,\r\nhowever, only just in time for the first night, when scores of hands\r\ndrag him on to a prodigiously vast stage to abase himself before a\r\njeering audience. His spasmodic efforts to speak merely confirm the\r\nimpression that he is a congenital epileptic.\r\n\r\nNext day the newspapers, after a flattering reference to his personal\r\nappearance, unite in denouncing the play as the work of a man with the\r\nintelligence of a crossing-sweeper and the originality of a jackass.\r\nThese comments are judiciously edited and made up as posters. The\r\neffect is stupendous, and the public flocks to the theatre. The author\r\nis a made man.\r\n\r\nAt least, he hopes he is.\r\n\r\nLetters pour in upon him from all quarters demanding more plays from\r\nhis pen. Actresses lie in wait for him at garden parties, and say,\r\narchly, “Oh, Mr. Blotto, when are you going to write a play for\r\n_me_?” Actor-managers call him “old boy”; and allow themselves to be\r\nseen shaking hands with him. The gifted gods and goddesses who are\r\nperforming his play make no secret of his acquaintance. The great Cyrus\r\nK. Bimetaller strokes a mighty stomach in silence. The dramatic agent\r\ngrunts, “I told you so,” and gives another polish to the super-silk\r\nhat. Melisande, writing her customary column in the _Evening Quacker_,\r\nobserves: “Last night, at Mr. Blotto’s delightful play which is\r\ncharming London, I saw the Duchess of Dripp, Count Sforzando, Mr. and\r\nMiss Mossop, and the Hon. ‘Toothy’ Badger. The house was crowded, of\r\ncourse. Mr. Blotto himself looked in during the evening, but hurried\r\naway on being recognised. He is so retiring.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this chorus of enthusiasm the author bashfully brings\r\nforward another play. Everyone scrambles to read it. Each points out a\r\nseparate defect. All unite in pronouncing it “essentially undramatic.”\r\nIt finds its way into that limbo of lost manuscripts, the safe of the\r\nsilk-hatted agent. Setting his teeth, the author completes another\r\nplay. It passes from hand to hand, becoming dog-eared in the journey,\r\nand finally returns to him, in silence and tatters. It seems hardly\r\nworthwhile adding it to the mountains of paper on the Agent’s shelves,\r\nso somebody tosses it behind a book-case, where it is treated with the\r\nscorn it merits by mice and insects. By now the first play has been\r\nsupplanted by a Bessarabian allegory, and the author’s name has long\r\nbeen forgotten. Still buoyed up with hope, he plans a _chef d’œuvre_--a\r\ndrama. “Something Shakespearian,” he modestly proclaims. Very few\r\npeople, however, even bother to read this, all eyes being fixed on a\r\ngenius from Kurdistan, who is taking away the breath of theatrical\r\nLondon in a play written entirely in Esperanto. The author spends his\r\nlast few shillings on a ticket to the Argentine, and begins a fresh\r\nlife as a herdsman.\r\n\r\nYears pass. The author is far from unsuccessful in his new venture.\r\nIn fact, he becomes extremely wealthy. He buys up his employer’s\r\n_hacienda_. He buys up several other people’s _haciendas_. He buys up\r\nthe greater part of the Argentine Republic. He has serious thoughts of\r\nbuying up South America and selling it to the United States. But his\r\nbetter nature prevails, and he returns to England and buys a peerage\r\ninstead. On the day appointed for him to be introduced to the House\r\nof Lords, his eye happens to see the poster of a new play--_The Dusky\r\nChild_. The name touches a chord. He recognises it as his own work. He\r\nforgets his engagement with the Peers of the Realm, and hurries off\r\nonce again in pursuit of literary reputation.\r\n\r\nHis old friend the dramatic agent is comparatively unchanged. He is\r\na little more silk-hatted, a little more rotund, and a little more\r\ncontemptuous of every one else. He recognises the author at once,\r\nejaculates laconically: “I told you so,” and takes him to meet Erasmus\r\nW. Bogg, the new impresario who is producing the play. They hurriedly\r\nprepare for the first night. The Lord Chancellor is very annoyed. The\r\nauthor snaps his fingers. At last literary fame is in his grasp. It\r\nseems an extraordinarily cold winter, but that doesn’t really matter.\r\nHe hurries on the rehearsals, snapping his fingers.\r\n\r\nHow amazingly chilly it has become.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords are sending the Lieutenant of the Tower to arrest\r\nhim. Ha, ha, let them. He snaps his fingers.\r\n\r\nReally, this weather, after the climate of the Argentine, is beyond a\r\njoke. For goodness sake hurry up with that scenery. What’s that about\r\nthe Lord Chancellor? Mr. Ramsay MacDonald--what? The who?\r\n\r\nEh?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe wakes up to find his cherished first play still unperformed--still,\r\nindeed, uncompleted. Kilimanjaro, a dream. The Argentine, a dream. The\r\npeerage--a dream, too. He shudders at that escape.\r\n\r\nBrr! Why, dammit, the fire’s out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHATS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hat, says my copy of the Concise Oxford Dictionary, is “man’s,\r\nwoman’s outdoor headcovering, usually with brim.” Not unto me the glory\r\nof writing about woman’s outdoor headcovering. These mysteries are\r\ntoo sacred to be profaned. But man’s hats are another thing. I have a\r\nnumber of my own. There is none of which I am not, in secret, ashamed.\r\n\r\nSome men have the faculty of knowing what hats they can wear with\r\ncredit--or, if not with credit, at least without sacrifice of\r\nself-respect. They go to the hatter, pick out a perfectly ordinary\r\n“headcovering” (usually “with brim”), and leave the shop gorgeously\r\ntransformed. Their very discards can be reblocked and made to look,\r\nif anything, better than new. And I? I go from one hatter to another\r\nin an endless pilgrimage in search of something in which I shall look\r\nless ridiculous (observe I say “less ridiculous”--I am easy to please),\r\nand find it never. I follow my friends into the places where they hat\r\nthemselves; I allow myself to be persuaded into buying some hateful\r\ncontrivance--“a perfect fit, sir”; and in three days the damn thing\r\nshrinks so that I can’t get it on my head. Or again, I try to allow for\r\nthis by ordering a larger size, whereafter, either I spend the whole of\r\nmy spare time stuffing the lining with paper or else it gradually but\r\nrelentlessly sinks, and settles on the bridge of my nose.\r\n\r\nThe very brims play tricks with me. I have a bowler. I bought it, I\r\ndistinctly remember, on account of the width of its brim. I have always\r\nliked a wide brim. Not that it ever keeps off the sun or rain, but\r\nsomehow it gives confidence. There is something spacious about a wide\r\nbrim. Something suggestive of an opulence to which I have in no other\r\nway ever pretended.\r\n\r\nWell. Anyhow. I gave up wearing my bowler, because it insisted on\r\nshrinking. It perched itself higher and higher on my head, until I\r\nbegan to think it really wasn’t safe. It might fall off and get run\r\nover. Nobody wants to expose even a rebellious hat to the dangers of\r\nLondon traffic. I went to my hatter (why I say _my_ hatter I can’t\r\nthink. Nobody is my hatter. Many have tried, none has succeeded). I\r\nwent to _a_ hatter; bought a large brown felt hat, wore it away (like a\r\nbride setting out for the honeymoon); and arranged for the bowler to be\r\nsafely conveyed to my home, hoping that all would be well.\r\n\r\nWell? Not a bit of it. The brown hat swelled and swelled. All the\r\nnewspapers in London contributed in their turn to keeping us from\r\nparting. In vain. That hat had a craving for adventure; it wanted to\r\nmake its way in the world alone; and a gust of east wind carried\r\nit (together with so much of the “Evening News” as had enabled it\r\nto maintain a precarious balance on my brow) under a passing bus. I\r\nhurried home with feelings almost of friendship for my erring bowler. I\r\nsaid magnanimously that forgiveness----\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “In which I shall not look so ridiculous.”]\r\n\r\nSomehow it didn’t look the same. I was prepared to swear that when I\r\nhanded it over to the hatter (_my_ hatter, very well) it did in some\r\nsort cover my head. But now--it had diminished to the size of a child’s\r\ntoy. And the brim--the brim had shrunk to the merest shadow.\r\n\r\nI have at last given up the struggle. I wear anything that comes along.\r\nNot that it matters. People have survived their hats before now. These,\r\nafter all, are the merest idiosyncrasies of head-covering. Observe,\r\nfor instance, the hats of the great. There you find something of real\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the curious things about really great men that they are\r\nunable to resist the bizarre in hats. They don’t turn out in strange\r\ntrousers, or curiously contrived coats. You don’t see them walking\r\nabout in sandals, or veldtschoons. They don’t tie up their beards with\r\nribbon; or shave their eyebrows; or put caste-marks on their faces.\r\nRight up to their head-coverings they are indistinguishable from\r\nyou and me. I don’t wish to flatter us, but very often they are less\r\npleasant to look at ... and then their greatness declares itself, or\r\ntheir originality breaks loose, or some other eerie characteristic\r\nfinds its appropriate expression, in the form of an article of apparel\r\nabout as distinctive and ugly as Britannia’s helmet.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I met a noble Viscount, a man who might easily become\r\nPrime Minister--I saw him, I mean; I encountered him in the street. He\r\nwas wearing a hat that suggested a bowler, but was not a bowler--that\r\nmight have been a “Daily Mail” hat, only it was black with a dull\r\nsurface, and, if I may so put it, had soft rounded lines in place of\r\nsharp ones--that--that in fact was indescribable. The rest of his\r\ngarments were those of a normal citizen. There were no unfamiliar\r\nexcrescences on his coat. His collar and tie were much like my own.\r\n\r\nLater in the day I saw in front of me a tall, hurrying figure striding\r\ntowards the House of Commons. The stooping gait and sombre clothing\r\nmight easily have been those of a mere scholar or clergyman. But the\r\nfigure bore upon its head a shapeless contrivance of purple velvet; and\r\nby that I knew it was--(well, you know who it was as well as I do).\r\n\r\nLook at Mr. Winston Churchill. Look at Admiral Beatty. Whoever saw a\r\nservice hat quite like Admiral Beatty’s? Though I admit, in his case,\r\nthe oddity is accentuated by his way of wearing it. Look at the hats of\r\nforeign potentates. Look at----\r\n\r\nLook at Mr. Lloyd George. I have never actually seen him in one of his\r\n“family” hats--but I know his hatted appearance intimately through a\r\npicture. It is a photograph representing “the man who won the war,” as\r\na vigorous smiling personage in a grey tweed suit. It seems to be very\r\nmuch the kind of suit that you or I might select for golf. But--here\r\ndistinction creeps in--the upper part of his body is swathed in\r\nsomething that resembles a horse blanket ... and he is crowned with the\r\nheaddress of a Tyrolean brigand.\r\n\r\nI am going to be a great man. I know it by my hats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAREHOLDERS’ BLOOD\r\n\r\nGRAND (TRUNK) FEATURE SERIAL.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN FILMS LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are in the Wild West of Canada--a land full of mustangs and\r\nmoccasins. People with hard faces are riding about in strange clothes.\r\nGently nurtured maidens are scrubbing out the cowshed, or digging\r\nup the manure heap. The hired-woman is sitting in the sunlight with\r\na book. It is a typical scene in a British Dominion; we know it is\r\nCanada, however, because there’s a flick, and the screen says:\r\n\r\n                    THIS IS THE CITY OF BISON SNOUT,\r\n                    FED BY THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY,\r\n                       CANADA’S PREMIER RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThen there’s another flick, and, lo! a magnificent train, racing across\r\nthe prairie, gives us a hint that we are watching Canada’s premier\r\nrailroad in operation. The screen obligingly confirms this impression\r\nby--FLICK:\r\n\r\n                      LUXURY, SPEED, AND SECURITY.\r\n                     THE GRAND TRUNK MILLIONAIRES’\r\n                     LIMITED THUNDERING ACROSS THE\r\n                               CONTINENT\r\n                     ON ITS JOURNEY TO BISON SNOUT.\r\n\r\nThe scene changes, now, to a precipitous hill overlooking the smiling\r\nvalley through which the train is thundering. Far away you can see her\r\nplume of smoke, racing across the sky. And here, in the foreground,\r\nare two sinister figures, mounted on the inevitable mustangs, masked\r\nand visored, grim and silent. Oo! They look like Irish gunmen; and as\r\nsoon as they espy the train they turn simultaneously to each other and\r\nexclaim with sinister emphasis--SNICK:\r\n\r\n                        THERE’S BOODLE IN THIS.\r\n\r\nCLICK--and we’re back again with our two desperadoes, galloping like\r\nmad from their point of vantage towards their luckless prey. (_Noise\r\noff--cloppety, cloppety, cloppety, clop._)\r\n\r\nNext we have a close-up of the train as it speeds over the landscape.\r\nThe passengers are sitting back in their places, wreathed in smiles.\r\nThey like their train. They think it particularly safe; and behind it\r\nall there is the feeling of immense security derived from the thought\r\nthat they are travelling in a British Dominion of the British Empire\r\nunder the waving protection of the Union Jack on which the sun never\r\nsets. The orchestra interprets their thoughts, and ours, by playing a\r\nselection of patriotic melodies.\r\n\r\nNow we are shown something really out of the way. Thus: SNICK:\r\n\r\n                           ON THE FOOTPLATE.\r\n\r\nFLICK:\r\n\r\n                      SWAYING ALONG AT HUNDREDS OF\r\n                       MILES AN HOUR, THE JOVIAL\r\n                  ENGINEER AND HIS MERRY COLLABORATORS\r\n                           PASS THE TIME WITH\r\n                            DANCE AND SONG.\r\n\r\nCLICK: And there they are, swaying like dipsomaniacs, dancing like\r\ndervishes, and opening their mouths like bullfrogs in a drought. Of\r\ncourse, you can’t hear what they’re singing, but a gramophone (_off_)\r\nobligingly strikes up at this moment:\r\n\r\n    Sons of the sea,\r\n    All British born,\r\n    Sailing every ocean,\r\n    Laughing foes to scorn--\r\n\r\nand so on. A little inappropriate to the setting perhaps; but, oh, how\r\napposite to what follows!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the face of the jovial engineer clouds over. He shades his\r\neyes with his hands. Rushing to the eyeholes, he peers out into the\r\nday. His collaborators copy him. We know something is coming. We stir\r\nuneasily in our seats. Somehow we can’t help associating this action\r\nwith the two sinister----What’s that? He’s beckoning to the chief\r\nmate (or whatever the fellow’s called). The chief mate’s beckoning to\r\nhim. Neither dares leave the eyeholes. How can they communicate with\r\neach other? Still the train speeds on. Oh! the engineer’s drawing his\r\nrevolver. Ah! it’s empty! So is the chief mate’s. So is everybody’s.\r\nHe flings it down with a curse. He’s going to speak to the chief mate.\r\nHe’s speaking: SNICK:\r\n\r\n                   SAY, YOU GUYS, IT’S HELL OR HOME.\r\n                            AND ME FOR HOME!\r\n\r\nFLICK:\r\n\r\n                 STOKE UP YOUR BOILERS, YOU BLEAR-EYED\r\n                                SKUNKS!\r\n\r\nAn underling flings open the door of the furnace. He staggers back.\r\nEmpty! He rushes with a shovel to the coal bunkers. The others rush\r\nafter him. Oh, there’s no coal! The train’s slowing down every minute.\r\nThe desperadoes are riding nearer and nearer. We can hear the thunder\r\nof their hoofs--I mean their horses’ hoofs. (_Noise off--cloppety,\r\ncloppety, cloppety, clop._)\r\n\r\nAh! what are they doing now? They’re going to throw one of the\r\nunderlings into the furnace to keep the train going. They’re going to\r\nburn the engineer and the chief mate. They’re going to pull the engine\r\nto pieces and burn that. Anything to escape. Anything to escape....\r\n\r\nSuddenly the chief mate, who’s looking through the eyehole, gives a\r\ngreat shout. He’s very excited and relieved. He’s speaking--listen,\r\nlook, I mean.\r\n\r\nFLICK:\r\n\r\n                    WHY IT’S ONLY THE SHERIFF’S BOYS\r\n                         HAVING A GAME WITH US!\r\n\r\nThe others do not agree with him. They point rudely at him, and curse\r\nhim for a fool. But he only smiles and says through his smile:\r\n\r\nCLICK:\r\n\r\n                      SURE--IT’S THE SHERIFF RIGHT\r\n                    ENOUGH. I SEEN HIS LIL’ BUTTON.\r\n                         HIS DEPUTY’S WITH HIM.\r\n                      I DONE SEE HIS BUTTON, TOO.\r\n\r\nThey rush to the eyeholes again. There’s no doubt this time. They throw\r\nup their hats and cheer. They are beside themselves. They even go so\r\nfar as to pull up the train. The passengers crowd to the windows. At\r\nfirst they are alarmed. They shrink back. They mutter among themselves.\r\nCLICK:\r\n\r\n                            IT’S A HOLD-UP.\r\n\r\n                             BUSH-RANGERS.\r\n\r\nand so on. But the engineer puts all that right. He descends royally\r\nfrom the footplate and walks along the train reassuring them. FLICK:\r\n\r\n                   IT’S ALL RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTS.\r\n                      IT’S ONLY THE SHERIFF OF THE\r\n                   DOMINION COME TO PAY US A SURPRISE\r\n                                 VISIT.\r\n\r\nWhat a joke! How they laugh! And cheer! They crowd to the window. They\r\nswarm out on to the line. They offer expensive drinks to the engineer\r\nand his collaborators, which are accepted. They pass round the hat.\r\n\r\nAnd then the sheriff approaches. He asks them to line up. They are\r\ndelighted. Another priceless joke. Ha! Ha! Ha! What a wit the man has,\r\nto be sure!

The movements of Marshal\r\nFoch; the Japanese Earthquake; the Recognition of Russia. Even (long\r\nsince) when the “Date of the Peace Celebrations” was announced, it was\r\na comparatively lifeless statement. To vitalise it, to humanise it, one\r\nhad to go to the neighbourhood of the Personal Column. Thus:--\r\n\r\n “CHAMPAGNE. APPROACHING PEACE CELEBRATIONS. Advertiser representing\r\n principals holding stocks of the best known brands of Champagne, etc.,\r\n etc.... Apply to ‘Benefactor.’”\r\n\r\nHere at last we were in the heart of things. “Stocks of the best\r\nknown brands of champagne.” This unlocked the tongue, set speculation\r\nworking. What brands? What is your favourite brand? One reviewed a\r\npageant of sparkling names such as Ayala, Irroy, Heidsieck, Mumm,\r\nMoet, Pommery, Roederer and the Widow, the dainty Clicquot.... And then\r\narose the question what to do on Peace Night--Jazz? Theatre? Opera? Or\r\nshould it be a quiet dinner (preferably at home) with Jones, who shared\r\none’s last Xmas in the Salient, and Smith the Silent, who never let one\r\ndown, and Robinson?... I seem to remember that I wrote to “Benefactor.”\r\n\r\nActually “Benefactor” was not, so to speak, a Member of the Personal\r\nColumn, though he dwelt very near to it. His announcement abutted\r\non a poignant appeal for a “SUITABLE PLACE TO STOP” from a young\r\nminesweeping lieutenant who, having exhausted his patience in\r\nransacking London for a bed, had lit upon the discovery that a large\r\npart of the hotel accommodation in this city was still in the clutches\r\nof Sir Alfred Mond and his Merry Men; but it was published (wrongly,\r\nof course) under the heading: “Business Opportunities.” What creature\r\nwould sink so low as to make a business opportunity out of the sale\r\nof that golden drink, of those “best brands of Champagne”--and in the\r\nPeace season, too? Perish the thought! To the Personal Column let\r\n“Benefactor” be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe Personal Column is the quintessence of journalism, an\r\ninexhaustible lucky-bag of strange communications and curious\r\nannouncements. Do you want a furnished caravan? Napoleon relics? Are\r\nyou a philatelist? Would you like a summer outing in Kew Gardens? Have\r\nyou a haunted house? These, after all, are things that touch one’s\r\ndaily life. Marshal Foch might go to the Sandwich Islands, and the\r\nphilatelist and I would wish him God-speed, and think of it no more;\r\nbut a haunted house (even if it be only haunted by mice) brings one\r\n“up against it!” Are you bored with your life? The Personal Column is\r\na constant provocation to plunge into the whirlpool of the unknown.\r\nThus at random: An officer, aged 20, of cheerful artistic and musical\r\ntastes, wishes to correspond with somebody with a view to “real\r\nfriendship.” There’s your chance. And what dark story, think you, is\r\nconcealed behind the following:\r\n\r\n“The Black Cat is watching: green eyes. S?”\r\n\r\nWhat tale of a temptation spurned lurks in:\r\n\r\n“Scalo: I may be poor but I love truth far better than gold--Misk?”\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of what jealous pangs came this to be penned:\r\n\r\n“Ralph--Who is BABS--Remember Olga?” (The following, in a happier vein,\r\ntells presumably of a lovers’ quarrel made up:\r\n\r\n“Whitewings. Darling you know really you are the only thing on earth I\r\nlove. Snowdrop.”)\r\n\r\nThe big news columns tell us what our intellectuals consider it good\r\nfor us to know, in the manner in which they consider it good for us\r\nto be told. The Ruhr Occupation, denounced by Mr. Garvin, upheld by\r\nLord Rothermere--The Betrayal of the Country to Labour (in the Gospel\r\naccording to Mr. Churchill)--The League of Nations--Bootlegging and\r\nProhibition. But the Personal Column--ah!--the Personal Column gives us\r\na peep into the throbbing lives of our neighbours; we become partakers\r\nin the bliss of Whitewings and Snowdrop, we share “S’s” apprehension of\r\nthe Black Cat, and our hearts go out to Misk and Olga--poor forgotten\r\nOlga. Here are no world politics dished up by statesmen _manqué_,\r\nor camouflaged by great journalists, no subjects to be discussed in\r\ncatchwords and manufactured phrases, but the myriad voices, from the\r\nstreets around, crying out at the impulse of the eternal verities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY SIDESHOWS\r\n\r\nEXTRACTED FROM THE PRIVATE DIARY OF THE HON. “TOOTHY” BADGER\r\n\r\n\r\nDined at the House last night. Ridiculous party given by “Bulgy”\r\nGobblespoon to celebrate his wife’s election: the first husband and\r\nwife to sit together. To everyone’s dismay, it proved that she had only\r\nscraped in by the Prohibitionist vote, to win which she had to pledge\r\nherself never to allow any form of alcohol on any table at which she\r\nsat. Very restrictive of her dining out, I should imagine, and utterly\r\ndestructive of her own dinners, which used to be rather fun. Impossible\r\nto imagine the gloom of that gathering! Even old Bitters, who was\r\nwheedled off the Front Bench to come down and say something amusing,\r\nwas quite unable to sparkle on Schweppes’ ginger ale. Hurried away\r\nwith little “Squeaky” Paddington (old Ponto’s new wife) to sample a\r\ndrink and a spot of foot shuffling at Sheep’s. Very stuffy and a lot of\r\nghastly people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomebody, turning out their lumber-room, has presented a whole shoot\r\nof pictures to the National Gallery; so I went to see who was looking\r\nat them. What that place exists for I can never understand. Hardly\r\nanyone there except a herd of frowsy old women, with paint-boxes, who\r\ntook jolly good care that nobody should come within a mile of anything\r\nworth looking at. One rather jolly girl--but very severe. The rest\r\nawful. A couple of anxious-looking people walking up and down, looking\r\nintense and making speeches about Ghirlandajo or Cimabue to an audience\r\nof yokels that doesn’t know either from cream cheese; and the remainder\r\nof London seems to use the portico as a convenient meeting-place, and\r\nnever goes inside at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBroke my rule against large parties last night in order to go and\r\nstare at the women Members of Parliament, who allowed themselves to\r\nbe shown off by old Lady Paramount Nectar at Ambrosia House. Never\r\nagain. The rooms are big enough Heaven knows; but they seemed to have\r\ninvited everyone in London, who had a dress-suit. Lady Biltong, whose\r\nfigure needs to be put under restraint, was carried out fainting. Poor\r\nBottisford had two ribs stove in going up the staircase and didn’t know\r\nit till he got home--kept murmuring that he must have got a touch of\r\npleurisy in the fog. And old Sir William Bylge trod on a lady’s train\r\nand brought it clean away from the gathers (whatever those may be).\r\nNeedless to say, it proved to be a Royalty, but only a minor one.\r\nNever saw so many foreign potentates and creatures gathered together in\r\nmy life before: the Duca di Corona Largo, Count Papryka da Chili, the\r\nPrince and Princess of Asta Mañana, a woman from New York, the Gizzawd\r\nof Abbyssinia, old Ramon Allones, looking younger than ever, and heaps\r\nof others. Nothing to eat, of course, and sickly sherbetty stuff\r\nmasquerading as champagne. Hurried away to Stag’s with George Mossop to\r\nwash the taste out of our mouths. If old Paramount Nectar had lived,\r\nhow different that supper would have been! As it is, if they took a\r\nbottle out of his cellar now, and poured it on his tomb, I believe he’d\r\nrise from the dead in very shame. Seems a bit too low to accept old\r\nLady P.’s hospitality, and then slang the food; but, after all, he was\r\nmy father’s cousin, and one feels it reflects on one’s own palate that\r\na relation by marriage should give inferior wine.\r\n\r\nCountry house parties nowadays are becoming absurd. In the old days\r\nthere was a lot to be said for country house visits. Even quite\r\nrecently they could be profitably undertaken. But now! _Nous avons\r\nchangê tout cela._ The advent of a Labour Government has put the\r\nfinal kybosh on even the limited hospitality one enjoyed last year.\r\nThree invitations this morning. One from Ditchwater Abbey--a place I\r\nloathe; one from Hugo Hamstringer, the fellow that made a fortune\r\nout of glue in the war, bought everything, lost the whole boiling in\r\nmultiple eggshops during the slump, and is now trying to make two ends\r\nmeet in that awful barrack of a place, Dundahead Hall, that he took\r\nover from “Wacker” with a block of dud oil shares in payment for his\r\n“calls” in Hamstringer, Limited, before the Company went bust--(nothing\r\nwould induce me to go near _him_); and one from dear little Phyllis\r\nBiddiker, whose husband has lost everything in Southern Ireland, and\r\nwho is scraping along somehow by letting off apartments at the Weir\r\nHouse (their place in Berkshire) to wealthy Colonials over here for the\r\nBritish Empire Exhibition. None asked me for more than a week-end. All\r\nsay “Bring your own whisky if you want any.” Phyllis has had a present\r\nof Australian Burgundy from one of her lodgers, and offers to share it.\r\nI shall stay at home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBecause my brother Henry chose to marry, why should his\r\nalmost-a-flapper daughter be motted on me to cart about London? A jade,\r\na sly boots and a minx, she makes my life a burden. She makes me give\r\nher expensive meals, which I rather like; but I draw the line at being\r\na decoy duck. Last night, having bled me of my entire income at Mah\r\nJongg--a game I shall never hope to learn--she demanded to be taken\r\nto an unintelligibly highbrow play, knowing, I suppose, that, after\r\nthe agony of listening to it, I should be as wax in her hands. Then\r\nshe led me by easy stages to Sheep’s Club, by pretending she wanted to\r\ndance with me. There (by the merest accident, of course) we found young\r\nGeoffrey Bannister, the one young man in London I was cautioned against\r\nallowing her to meet--as if an uncle has any control whatever--and the\r\nwhole plot stood revealed. Before I could contort my features into a\r\nfrown, they were dancing in the middle of the room, where they seemed\r\nto spend the remainder of the evening. I was allowed to give them\r\nsupper; they allowed me to take them away at two a.m. They were almost\r\ntoo good to be true till we got home--driving back in Geoffrey’s car;\r\nand then they suddenly insisted on starting off to “be in at the death”\r\nat the Hunt Ball at Hillsbury, looking in at Bridget Hanover’s dance in\r\nBrook Street on the way. Told them to go to the Hunt Ball at another\r\nplace beginning with the same initial, sent Geoffrey home, and packed\r\nher off to bed. No more nieces for me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey call them “winter sports.” You cram yourself, with everybody you\r\ndislike most, into the same train; stamp round the decks of the boat\r\nin a blizzard, swearing and trying to keep warm; ruin your digestion\r\nwith the beastly food in the Train de Luxe; scrimmage with thirty\r\nother people for the sleeping berth you all booked six months before;\r\nturn out at the frontier to be browbeaten by hordes of _douaniers_;\r\nand arrive in the early morning feeling and looking like the Ancient\r\nMariner, and discover that your rooms at the hotel have been swiped\r\nby somebody else. You turn out the manager, who shrugs his shoulders,\r\nand, after a fearful row, condescends to offer you sleeping room in\r\nan attic, on terms for which you could buy a large mansion in most\r\ncountries. But your spirit is broken, and, rather than face the journey\r\nback, you accept with resignation, and crawl into the hovel allotted\r\nto you. You unpack your traps, and find that one of your skates is\r\nmissing, or else that the straps have disappeared from your _skis_.\r\nBut you are desperate now; you bind them on your feet with string,\r\nand rush out into the snow. You are immediately knocked down by some\r\nconfounded beginner who has lost control and is flying down the hill\r\nat the rate of knots. You stagger to your feet gasping, with snow down\r\nyour neck and both your _skis_ adrift. While you are readjusting them,\r\na bob-sleigh whizzes into you, sweeps you off your feet on top of its\r\ncrew, and obligingly overturns down an embankment. The occupants of\r\nthe sleigh are people you’ve been trying to avoid for years; and,\r\ninstead of cursing you for being in the way, they fall on your neck and\r\ninvite you to dinner. You are in such pain from broken arms and legs,\r\nthat you can’t think of an excuse, so you have to accept. After dinner\r\nthey rob you at bridge, and, as a crowning blow, the man of the party\r\nborrows money from you. At last you break away, hurry back--and find\r\nthe interesting girl you were hoping to talk to, deeply engaged with\r\nsome wretched subaltern. And then the Lord Chancellor or some other\r\nfearful bore insists on talking about home politics--the one thing\r\nyou were dying to forget. You mutter excuses and stumble off to turn\r\nin--still nursing your wounds. Some idiot has left the window open, and\r\nthere are icicles hanging from the ceiling and a pile of snow in the\r\nmiddle of your bed. Next day you repeat the performance, which goes on\r\nfor a fortnight at least. Winter “sports”! It must refer to the people,\r\nand not to the pastimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “And obligingly overturns down an embankment.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLATTER-DAY DRAMAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORALITY\r\n\r\n(_In the manner of John Galsworthy._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT I\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE: _The rectory at Swilberry. The rector, the Rev. Hardy\r\n Heavyweight, is going through the accounts of the village cricket club\r\n with Diggers, his sexton and factotum._\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_adding up as he goes along_): And three and sixpence is four\r\n pound two and a penny ’a’penny, and five shillin’ is four seven one a\r\n half; and there’s that cheque from Mr. Selvidge.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_comparing each item in the bank book_): That’s not\r\n entered here.\r\n\r\n DIGGERS: Paid in later, per’aps. The cheque----\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: Yes--it will be in the pocket of the book. (_He gropes\r\n for it._) There seem to be a lot of papers here. (_He pulls them\r\n out._) Why, good heavens!\r\n\r\n DIGGERS: What’s matter, Sir?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_in a changed voice that belies his words_): Nothing,\r\n Diggers, nothing.... Here’s the cheque (_he holds it up_).... Who had\r\n charge of this book?\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_mildly surprised_): Miss Agatha, Sir.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_mechanically--he is thinking hard of something else_):\r\n You’ve never seemed to get accustomed to calling her Mrs. Foxglove,\r\n Diggers.\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_heartily_): No, Sir, that I ’aven’t. An’ when them ’orrible\r\n divorce proceedings is finished an’ she’s quit o’ that thing of a\r\n ’usband, she _will_ be Miss Agatha again, to all intents an’ purposes.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_pained_): I think we mustn’t talk about that, Diggers.\r\n The club accounts are all right?\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_disappointed_): Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: Thank you for helping me. Would you ask Mrs. Foxglove to\r\n come?\r\n\r\n DIGGERS: Miss Agatha, Sir? Certainly. (_He goes. The rector leans\r\n back in his chair, with his face drawn with anxiety. He toys with the\r\n papers he has abstracted from the pocket of the bank book. He shakes\r\n his head sadly as he reads. Suddenly Agatha Foxglove, a charming and\r\n vital creature, bursts in on him._)\r\n\r\n AGATHA: Hello, papa--what’s up?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_looking away from her_): Agatha, dear, these\r\n letters--(_he holds them up_)--these letters from a man called Jim,\r\n they’re yours, are they?\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_taken aback_): Ye--yes. I....\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: (_appealingly_): I’m sure there’s an explanation, dear.\r\n Won’t you tell me?\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_laughing uneasily_): Well, er, I suppose ... where did you\r\n find them? (_He silently points to the book._) I don’t know. I suppose\r\n I must have put them there accidentally, from my table.... It comes of\r\n keeping those horrible accounts for you.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_sadly_): But the _contents_, Agatha, dear.\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_sharply_): You’ve read them?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: I was unable to help reading them. They were lying open\r\n among the cheques. (_Tenderly_): Won’t you explain?\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_with the modern mixture of frankness and impatience_): Of\r\n course, there’s an explanation, papa. You surely don’t suppose that,\r\n with a drunken imbecile for a husband, I could do entirely without\r\n sympathy and affection?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_apprehensively_): Then--you were--unfaithful?\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_swiftly_): But we’re going to be married, as soon as the\r\n decree is made absolute.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_pitifully_): I’m sure, my dear, that that was your\r\n intention; but, as a clergyman----\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_anxious_): You won’t tell anyone----?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: My child, can’t you see? can’t you feel for me? As a\r\n clergyman I believe--I am bound to believe--that marriage is an\r\n irrevocable tie. Divorce on proper grounds I have to recognise, as a\r\n servant of the State; but when I see the procedure abused by those who\r\n have forfeited their right to invoke it, how can I, as a conscientious\r\n minister of God--how can I stand aside because the culprit is my own\r\n adopted daughter and ward? I am morally bound to inform the King’s\r\n Proctor.\r\n\r\n AGATHA: But father--father. Oh, for God’s sake--(_she becomes\r\n incoherent._)\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: Ah, my child, my child. Morality demands--(_His voice\r\n breaks. There is a terrible pause. He goes to the bookshelf._)\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_agonised_): Oh--what are you doing?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_in a dead, mirthless voice_): Looking out my train to\r\n London.\r\n\r\n                           THE CURTAIN FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE: _The Divorce Court._\r\n\r\n MR. WHASSIT (_Agatha’s Counsel_):--a temptation which, please God, I\r\n shall never encounter myself. And further----\r\n\r\n THE JUDGE (_testily_): Mr. Whassit, is it necessary to prolong this?\r\n\r\n MR. WHASSIT (_firmly_): My Lord, I have a duty to my client, and----\r\n\r\n THE JUDGE: Yes, yes, I know, Mr. Whassit. Your conduct of the case has\r\n been very proper; and, of course, if you wish to proceed, I shall say\r\n no more. But you’ve not traversed a single fact----\r\n\r\n MR. WHASSIT (_sitting down at last_): I will leave the matter in your\r\n Lordship’s hands.\r\n\r\n THE JUDGE: That is well.... This is an application to make absolute\r\n a decree nisi pronounced in October last. The King’s Proctor has\r\n intervened, alleging misconduct on the part of petitioner, such as\r\n would have invalidated her plea; and he has amply and abundantly\r\n proved his case. The application therefore fails, and the petitioner\r\n will pay the costs of the intervention.\r\n\r\n But that is not all. In the course of the proceedings, which were\r\n defended, the cross-examination of the petitioner was directed towards\r\n establishing these very adulteries, which have now been proved. She\r\n denied them with vehemence, and went so far as to comment, from the\r\n witness-box, upon the propriety of counsel raising issues of the\r\n kind. Now this is a serious matter. It is one thing to make what I\r\n might call a formal denial of adultery, in an undefended case, though\r\n technically it might be perjury, and I myself should view even that\r\n with gravity; it is quite another thing in a defended case, where\r\n the matter has definitely been put in issue, to make a denial of\r\n the kind; and I cannot see how the situation differs from that of a\r\n plaintiff who comes before the court seeking relief, let us say, on a\r\n Bill of Exchange, and falsely denies an allegation of fraud, or some\r\n other invalidating factor. In both cases there may result a serious\r\n miscarriage of justice, which at least cannot be so in an undefended\r\n divorce suit, where it is to be imagined that the respondent is\r\n indifferent to the consequences.\r\n\r\n (_Addressing Agatha at the solicitor’s table_): It has been urged\r\n most eloquently by your counsel that you had much to endure, and many\r\n temptations to the course upon which you ultimately embarked with so\r\n much recklessness. That may be so; or, again, it may not. It might be\r\n taken into account by another court, as a mitigating circumstance.\r\n But the Law, which I am here to administer, gives me, as I see it, no\r\n choice. Public morality must be vindicated; and a flagrant perjury of\r\n a kind that has become all too prevalent of late, is more than I can\r\n pass unchallenged. The papers in this case will therefore be forwarded\r\n to the Director of Public Prosecutions.\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_hysterically_): My Lord. We--I--Oh God----\r\n\r\n THE USHER (_sternly_): Silence.\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_patting her hand_): There, there, Miss Agatha. Don’t take on.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_on the other side_): My dear--don’t let’s have a scene.\r\n\r\n HER SOLICITOR (_kindly_): Hush! You mustn’t interrupt his Lordship,\r\n you know.\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_wildly_): But if I don’t, they’ll prosecute me!\r\n\r\n THE USHER (_to the Serjeant of Police_): Get ’er solicitor to take ’er\r\n quietly outside. (_The Serjeant complies._)\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_following and moaning as he goes_): Why did you go an’ do\r\n it, Mr. ’Eavyweight, Sir? (_Wringing his hands more than ever_): Oh,\r\n Miss Agatha, Miss Agatha.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_trying hard to be brave_): Hush, Diggers, be a man. Bear\r\n up. Courage.\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_bursting into tears_): Oh, Mr. ’Eavyweight, Sir, ’ow could\r\n you?\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_who has only done his duty_): You don’t understand, my\r\n poor fellow.... Morality demands----(_His voice breaks. They vanish\r\n in the wake of the Serjeant._)\r\n\r\n THE REGISTRAR (_calling the next case_): Boggs versus Boggs and Boggs,\r\n Boggs intervening. (_He hands up a bundle of papers to the judge._)\r\n\r\n A COUNSEL (_rising_): This is an application for administration _de\r\n bonis non_, my Lord. I understand----\r\n\r\n                           THE CURTAIN FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE: _A prison. Agatha in her cell. The doors are flung open and the\r\n visiting justices troop in, accompanied by the Governor of the prison,\r\n the doctor, the chaplain, warders, and our old friend Diggers, the\r\n sexton._\r\n\r\n FIRST VISITING JUSTICE: Well, what’s this one?\r\n\r\n THE GOVERNOR (_curtly_): Perjury. Five years’ penal servitude. Last\r\n Assizes.\r\n\r\n THE WOMAN SUPERINTENDENT: Sulky little fiend. Won’t speak; and throws\r\n her food at the warders.\r\n\r\n SECOND VISITING JUSTICE (_addressing Agatha_): Come, come, my girl,\r\n you’re doing yourself no good by this kind of thing. (_Addressing the\r\n Governor_): Can’t your doctor do anything--or the chaplain?\r\n\r\n THE DOCTOR (_in a dry staccato voice_): She’s perfectly healthy--not\r\n losing weight--organs in good condition. I can’t do more than keep her\r\n fit.\r\n\r\n FIRST JUSTICE: Well, the chaplain, then?\r\n\r\n THE CHAPLAIN: She’s very hard and unrepentant.\r\n\r\n SECOND JUSTICE: Can’t you make her repent?\r\n\r\n THE CHAPLAIN (_decidedly_): No. Nor can anyone else.\r\n\r\n BOTH JUSTICES (_uneasily_): I see. Yes. (_Addressing the Governor_):\r\n Can nothing be done?\r\n\r\n THE GOVERNOR: Nothing more. She’s under constant supervision....\r\n There’s a visitor for her with our party; where is he?\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_coming forward_): Here, Sir?\r\n\r\n THE GOVERNOR: See if you can persuade her to speak to you.\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_approaching her timidly_): Miss Agatha, Miss Agatha ...\r\n won’t you speak to me, old Diggers? (_She pays no attention._) Miss\r\n Agatha, I’ve brought you some cowslips from the old glebe be’ind the\r\n church. (_Anxiously, to the Governor_): May she ’ave them, Sir?\r\n\r\n THE GOVERNOR (_blowing his nose_): Of course. Of course. (_Diggers\r\n produces a sorry mess of yellow blossoms._)\r\n\r\n DIGGERS: They’re faded, but they’re from the old ’ome.... Won’t you\r\n ’ave them, Miss? (_She makes no sign. One of the justices breaks\r\n down._)\r\n\r\n THE WOMAN SUPERINTENDENT: Now, dearie, take the nice flowers. (_But\r\n Agatha pays no attention._)\r\n\r\n THE SECOND JUSTICE: Dear, dear, how sad. (_Making a final effort_): My\r\n poor young woman, you mustn’t take it so to heart. Your sentence, with\r\n good conduct remission, which I presume you mean to earn--though you\r\n won’t do so by throwing good food about--your sentence is really quite\r\n trivial. (_She suddenly turns her eyes on him, with a baleful glare in\r\n them. He stumbles over his words and dries up_): Yes, er, exactly.\r\n\r\n THE FIRST JUSTICE (_who is bored_): Well, let’s be getting on. (_They\r\n troop out._) It’s a sad case; but of course, Morality--(_his voice\r\n dies away_.)\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_when they have gone_): Stupid, sentimental humbugs!\r\n (_Viciously_): Slugs, worms, uncomprehending BEASTS! (_In impotent\r\n fury she whirls round the cell like a dervish, finally throwing\r\n herself panting on her mattress._) Morality, indeed! (_She bites a\r\n large piece out of the floor._)\r\n\r\n                           THE CURTAIN FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE: _The streets of London (many years later). Heavyweight and\r\n Diggers walk slowly along, searching the faces of the passers-by.\r\n Suddenly Heavyweight stops in front of a thin, emaciated woman._\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT: God! It’s you, Agatha, at last.... Have you come to this?\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_unsteadily_): Don’t interfere with me. I’m looking after\r\n myself. What I do is my affair.\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_incoherently_): Oh, Miss Agatha, Miss Agatha. (_He strokes\r\n her hand._)\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_tenderly_): My dear. You’re worn out, thin, hungry.\r\n Wait. We’ll buy some food and wine and take you back. Come, Diggers.\r\n (_They enter a shop. She leans against a lamp-post. A detective\r\n appears suddenly beside her._)\r\n\r\n THE DETECTIVE (_addressing her sharply_): Solicitin’, you was.... You\r\n come along o’ me.\r\n\r\n AGATHA (_furiously_): I won’t, I won’t! It’s a lie.\r\n\r\n THE DETECTIVE: Now, then, be civil.... Ticket o’ leave, ain’t you?\r\n\r\n AGATHA: Oh, what’s that to do with you? I’ve served my time. You’ve no\r\n further claim on me.\r\n\r\n THE DETECTIVE (_grimly_): ’Aven’t we? You just come along. (_He takes\r\n her arm. Maddened, she deals him a vicious backhander in the mouth and\r\n escapes from his grasp, fleeing along the pavement._) That won’t do\r\n you no good, my girl. (_He starts in pursuit. Heavyweight reappears,\r\n followed by the faithful Diggers._)\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_anxiously_): Agatha, Agatha.... My God! (_Realising what\r\n has happened, he rushes in pursuit._)\r\n\r\n DIGGERS: Oh, Miss Agatha, Miss Agatha. (_He walks unsteadily after\r\n them, wringing his hands. There is a hoarse shout, off, then a\r\n horrible crash and a sharp, sickening scream. The detective and\r\n Heavyweight reappear, carrying a lifeless form._)\r\n\r\n DIGGERS (_in an agony_): What’s happened? Oh, what’s happened to Miss\r\n Agatha?\r\n\r\n THE DETECTIVE (_huskily_): Run over. (_Addressing Heavyweight_): Not\r\n my fault, Sir. I couldn’t let ’er ’op it like that.\r\n\r\n HEAVYWEIGHT (_brokenly_): My poor fellow, I know. You only did your\r\n duty.... The social code must be upheld. Morality demands----(_His\r\n voice breaks for the last time, and the curtain descends on his\r\n tears._)\r\n\r\n                          THE END OF THE PLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETERNITY AND POST-ETERNITY\r\n\r\n(_An endless Tone-Drama in the Shavian manner._)\r\n\r\n\r\n _Through the skylight of the subterranean dwelling of_ COLONEL LAZYBOY\r\n (R.A.S.C., T.D.), _in the Chiltern Hills, an apparently endless\r\n procession of clouds may be seen racing across a Mediterranean-blue\r\n sky, a sure sign that rain will fall later. We may omit a number\r\n of stage directions about the history of the_ LAZYBOY _family, the\r\n detailed furnishing of the cavern, the mental processes of the_\r\n COLONEL _himself, and a stupendous preface on “Midwifery and the\r\n Modern Play”--it being sufficient to state that, although a spacious\r\n mansion stands in the grounds hard by, it is entirely given over to\r\n the servants, the family preferring to share the cave life of the_\r\n COLONEL, _who, since he commanded a Chinese Labour Battalion during\r\n the second battle of the Somme, has been quite unable to reaccustom\r\n himself to living in a house, preferring, as he says, the harder and\r\n more natural life of the dug-out._\r\n\r\n _The_ COLONEL, MRS. LAZYBOY (_a faded, bored woman_), MERCIA, _their\r\n daughter, and_ HARMODIUS HASHOVIT, _her husband, are at their morning\r\n wrangle. In the middle of the row_, NURSE ALLSOPP _hurries in. Being_\r\n MERCIA’S _old nurse she is virtually mistress (and master) of the\r\n house._\r\n\r\n MRS. LAZYBOY: Oh, dear! What is it now, Nursey?\r\n\r\n NURSE: Oh, Im sure I beg pardon, Maam, but heres Miss Mercias young\r\n man--(_suddenly observing_ HASHOVIT)--Oh, Im sure I beg pardon, sir, I\r\n didn’t see you. I meant to say----\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_heavily_): You meant that popinjay Eustace Brill. You\r\n needn’t make a mystery about it, Nurse. Everyone knows hes my wifes\r\n young man.\r\n\r\n NURSE (_shocked_): Oh, that Im sure they dont, sir.\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL (_pained_): Harmodius, my dear fellow, er----Allsopp, tell\r\n Mr. Brill were not at home.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_bouncing up_): Certainly not! Send Youstee away because\r\n Harmys jealous. Ill go and let him in myself.\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_sneering_): So that you can kiss him in the passage without\r\n anyone seeing you----\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_proudly_): Ill kiss him before you all. (_A terrific crash\r\n and splintering of glass heralds the arrival of_ EUSTACE _by the\r\n skylight. He lands on the table, which collapses under him; recovers\r\n his feet, and smiles genially around._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The influence of that man Shaw.”]\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_crooning_): Yousteeee!\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL (_testily_): Confound it all, Brill, I wish you wouldn’t\r\n tear the place to pieces like that.... And you’ve shot a great fid of\r\n glass into my eye. Damn the thing. (_He gropes, and finally extracts\r\n it._) There, now itll bleed for the rest of the day!\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_surprised_): I thought you prided yourself on keeping up\r\n active service conditions.\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL: So I do.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: Then why make all this fuss about a trifling wound? You ought\r\n to be grateful. It adds a touch of reality to your life.\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL: Id rather you left me to supply the reality myself,\r\n Brill. However--(MERCIA, _true to her threat, embraces_ EUSTACE _with\r\n fervour_).... Now really, Mercia, upon my soul.... (_He clicks his\r\n tongue with vexation._)\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_taken aback_): Mercia, dear. I know you mean it awfully\r\n nicely. But really, in public----\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_glowering_): You see--you degrade yourself to no purpose.\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL (_warmly_): Degrade? Nonsense!... I, of course, dont mean\r\n to imply----\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT: But damn it all, Colonel----\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_screaming_): Dont shout, Harmodius.\r\n\r\n _The wrangle proceeds on the familiar Shavian lines, the party being\r\n reinforced for no apparent reason by the arrival of_ DAN BIGBY, _an\r\n old sea-captain, and_ MICHAEL JOHN O’SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_at long last_): Look here, Im getting sick of this. Its all\r\n too much like a play by Bernard Shaw.\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_growling_): Everyone is at heart a Shavian.\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL (_hastily_): No, really, Harmodius.... O’Sullivan, Brill,\r\n we cant have that----\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: The truth about Shaw----      }\r\n                                        }\r\n HASHOVIT: My idea of Shaw----          }\r\n                                        }\r\n MICHAEL JOHN: Sure, if you come        }\r\n to talk about Shaw----                 }       (_Spoken_\r\n                                        }    _together._)\r\n MRS. LAZYBOY: Hes quite right. The     }\r\n influence of that man Shaw----         }\r\n                                        }\r\n CAPTAIN DAN: Who was Shaw, anyway?     }\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL (_in his parade voice_): Silence. Youre on parade. Behave\r\n accordingly.\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN DAN: Avast there. Belay.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_stamping_): I wont belay. I object----\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: But whats this to do with Shaw? And whats the use of\r\n objecting when cosmic forces grip people by the throat? Ive no wish\r\n whatever to do anything thats not A1 at Lloyds and all that. But----\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT: Cosmic fiddlesticks. Its lust, Brill, and you know it. You\r\n and Mercia want to misconduct yourselves, and its no good your trying\r\n to draw a red herring of formulas and psycho-analytic bosh across the\r\n track. It wont wash. In my young days----\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_icily_): I dont think were greatly interested in your young\r\n days, Harmodius.\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT: Be quiet, Mercia. I ~will~ speak my mind, so youd\r\n better make up your minds to listen. In my young days if a man and a\r\n girl wanted to behave improperly they just did so and said no more\r\n about it. But youve no decency. Youre not content with forbidden\r\n fruit, you go and flaunt your liaison in the husband’s face, and make\r\n a parade of it before all his and your friends. I wonder you dont\r\n advertise it in the papers. Upon my soul, its what were coming to----\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: But----\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_yelling_): Dont you interrupt me, sir. I dont care a\r\n swizzle stick about your stealing my wifes affections. As a matter\r\n of fact, she hasnt got any, as youll jolly soon discover when the\r\n noveltys worn off----\r\n\r\n MERCIA: Oh, Harmy. (_She weeps._)\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT: I dont care if you take her to Brighton or Nijni\r\n Novgorod--if youre such a blasted fool as to spend so much money on\r\n her. I dont care if you sit all day squeezing her hand, looking into\r\n her eyes till you both squint, pawing her about, and talking that\r\n horrible sickly twaddle I couldn’t help overhearing last night (_he\r\n shudders at the recollection_).... But--(_rising to his feet_)--but I\r\n will not have all your friends and my friends whispering and talking\r\n about me as though I were something to be pitied. (_His voice rising\r\n to a scream._) If you want to know, I think Im just about the damn\r\n luckiest fellow alive to have unloaded this viperish, discontented,\r\n addle-headed, empty-hearted baggage on the most crass and pitiable\r\n fool Ive ever met--and if you want to say any more--(_his poor,\r\n overstrained voice cracks and dies away in his throat with a mouse’s\r\n squeak; whereat he expresses his feelings by tearing the cushions to\r\n pieces and scattering the bits on the floor_.)\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL: Come, come, my dear fellow--pull yourself together.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_crisply_): What I like about Harmodius is his obvious\r\n self-control.\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_his eyes bulging; he speaks in a hoarse whisper_): Shut up,\r\n you she-porcupine, you hateful female skunk, you--(_his vocal chords\r\n snap and his voice goes for ever_.)\r\n\r\n MERCIA: His manners are so perfect, too: and hes so brave.... Cry-baby!\r\n\r\n HASHOVIT (_inarticulately_): o o o o o o o b b--(_or some similar\r\n noise. Blood gushes from his mouth._)\r\n\r\n NURSE ALLSOPP: There, my poddle-poodkins, come with nursey-wursey.\r\n (_Addressing the others sharply_): And if you want any lunch go and\r\n wash your hands, all of you. (_She leads HARMODIUS out by the hand.\r\n The others, except EUSTACE and MERCIA, follow her meekly_.)\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_uneasily_): You expect me to admire all that, I suppose.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_fixing him with vampire eyes_): I expect you to admire\r\n nothing except me.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: Admire you. I loathe you. I struggle to escape from you.\r\n Youre like some awful drug, the same odious intoxication, the same\r\n irresistible fascination, and the same deadly remorse when its all\r\n over. You steal away my senses, and make me a slave.\r\n\r\n MERCIA: I make you a priest, not a slave.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: No, its slavery.\r\n\r\n MERCIA: Priesthood. High Priesthood to the divine desire in all of us.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_retreating_): Im afraid of that.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_snaring him with her eyes_): Afraid! Afraid of worshipping\r\n love?\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: Yes. Ive no vocation.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_dangerously_): Does that mean youve no inclination?\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: No. It means what it says.... You talk about priesthood of\r\n love. You seem to think no vocation is necessary, though I suppose\r\n youd admit it in the case of a priest of Buddhism. Religion is a\r\n dedication of the spirit; Love, a dedication of the heart. You cant\r\n dedicate your spirit till its broken; nor can you your heart; and\r\n hearts dont break as easily as crockery, let me tell you. (_Espying\r\n MICHAEL JOHN in the passage_): O’Sullivan.\r\n\r\n MICHAEL JOHN (_entering and curling himself up in the coal-scuttle_):\r\n Speak.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: Tell her how long a mans heart must beat against that of a\r\n woman before it will break.\r\n\r\n MICHAEL JOHN: Four years and ninety minutes exactly. On the tick of\r\n the ninetieth minute the heart cracks, and the imprisoned soul passes\r\n from its bondage into the numbing bliss of everlasting heartache----\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN DAN (_entering unobserved and taking up the tale_): And in\r\n the fifth year he shall be exalted above human understanding.... In\r\n the dog watches and under the dog stars Ive looked upon the ways of\r\n mankind, and held my hand from destroying them in sheer----\r\n\r\n EUSTACE: Pity?\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN DAN: Pity. No! Indifference.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_fixing him with her eyes_): Danny, I make you mine. The\r\n priesthood of love----\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN DAN (_uneasily_): Avast there.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_triumphantly_): There’s no avasting where Ill take you.\r\n (_Breaking into a chant_)\r\n\r\n    I go by the mountains and rivers,\r\n    I go by the seashore and fell.\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_satirically_):\r\n\r\n    While the thankless old mariner shivers\r\n\r\n MICHAEL JOHN:\r\n\r\n    And strives to break loose from her spell.\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_her voice rising to prophetic fervour_):\r\n\r\n    But the child, still unborn, of my yearning,\r\n    Shall go in the van as our guide,\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN DAN (_chuckling feebly_):\r\n\r\n    Down the pathway of shame to the burning,\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_laughing horribly_):\r\n\r\n    When Im Daniel the Mariners Bride.\r\n\r\n (_She sweeps him into her arms and carries him away shouting._)\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_disappearing_): Io. Io. Dionysos!\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN DAN (_in a high falsetto_): Let the skies rain joy!\r\n\r\n EUSTACE (_passionately_): How can you, Mercia, how can you? (_He is\r\n seized by uncontrollable weeping._) Im crying, O’Sullivan----\r\n\r\n MICHAEL JOHN: Im wantin a cry meself. (_He bursts into tears._)\r\n\r\n MERCIA_’s voice_ (_a long way off_): But you must let me come back and\r\n look after Harmodius’s clothes----\r\n\r\n  _Many years elapse. They are still talking._\r\n\r\n MERCIA (_temporizing_): After all, if I leave Harmodius for Eustace,\r\n or Eustace for Danny----\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL (_who is deaf by now_): Whats that?\r\n\r\n MRS. LAZYBOY (_who is nearly as deaf and very feeble_): Shes talking\r\n about the childrens holidays.\r\n\r\n THE COLONEL: He! He! He!\r\n\r\n  _A long time passes by._\r\n\r\n MR. FUZZLEWHITT (MERCIAS _great grandson_): After all, if she had\r\n deserted Harmodius Hashovit----\r\n\r\n MRS. FUZZLEWHITT (_who is thoroughly tired of the story_): Yes, Rejjy,\r\n I know....\r\n\r\n  _Centuries roll by._\r\n\r\n MONSIEUR CHOSE: Bernard Shaw says in his play about Mercia and\r\n Harmodius Hashovit that if Mrs. Lazyboy----\r\n\r\n  _Æons pass._\r\n\r\n SOMEBODY: Theres a storm coming. Its going to cleanse the world. (_The\r\n sky darkens._)\r\n\r\n SOMEBODY ELSE: It makes no difference. The human brain will survive.\r\n\r\n A THIRD PERSON: The human antheap will continue to surge with\r\n meaningless movement.\r\n\r\n A FOURTH: The human voice will continue to cry from nothing to nothing.\r\n\r\n A FIFTH: The human hand will continue to write, and posterity will\r\n bury the writings.\r\n\r\n A SIXTH: And Shaw alone shall be assured of immortality.\r\n\r\n _The storm breaks with prodigious force. Eternity arrives._\r\n\r\n A SHINING ONE: Yes, the immortals are all in their places. Dante and\r\n Cervantes had a squabble last night, but theyve made it up.\r\n\r\n THE ETERNAL: Good.\r\n\r\n THE SHINING ONE: Shakespeare has been giving trouble, too. Hes jealous\r\n of Shaw.\r\n\r\n THE ETERNAL (_apprehensively_): Im not at all easy in my own mind\r\n about Shaw.\r\n\r\n  _Eternity passes._\r\n\r\n MR. SHAW (_on the steps of the eternal throne_): Im really very sorry.\r\n Its no wish of mine, you know.\r\n\r\n THE ETERNAL (_apologetically, and handing over the crown and sceptre\r\n of Heaven_): Not at all. Its a pleasure to make this trifling\r\n acknowledgment of your genius.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE PLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCHANTED ISLAND\r\n\r\n(_A Fantasy in the manner of J. M. Barrie._)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe pink and white drawing-room of Emily Jane’s house--or rather of\r\nthe house of Emily Jane’s father, Mister Balbus, is so caressingly\r\nharmonious to the eye, so surpassingly restful, so eminently a place\r\nof happy people, that one knows instinctively it will be visited by a\r\ntragedy. It is just a question of time, and this gentle atmosphere will\r\nfind itself charged with the electricity of conflicting human emotions;\r\ndear women’s hearts will break and be laid aside in pot-pourri jars;\r\nstrong sentimental men will walk their sweet, melancholy way; and we\r\nshall all go home the cleaner, mentally, for a refreshing bath of\r\ntears. Emily Jane is not yet in the drawing-room. The appropriate\r\natmosphere has first to be created, so that we may catch our breath\r\njust a little as Miss Compton or Miss Celli trips on. Emily Jane is\r\nreally a very ordinary kind of girl, plump, pleasant-looking, and\r\nneither very clever nor specially athletic. But to her mother she is\r\nstill a tiny toddling mite in a knitted woollen coat with pink ribbons,\r\nand to Daddy, Mister Balbus, she is a resplendent goddess.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a preliminary conversation about stamp-collecting, or\r\nsome other harmless hobby, between McVittie and Price, two old dullards\r\nintroduced to fill in the few awkward minutes while the latecomers are\r\nclambering into their stalls, Mister Balbus comes into the room. There\r\nis nothing remarkable about Mister Balbus. In the eyes of his wife he\r\nis an irresistibly lovable plexus of male weaknesses; in the eyes of\r\nEmily Jane he is closely related to the Almighty. Actually he is nobody\r\nin particular, an architect of sorts; but we are to see him through\r\ntheir eyes, and so he appears in the play as a genial and gigantic\r\nmixture of a demigod and a buffoon. Mr. Aynesworth is appropriately\r\nselected to represent him.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” he says.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” reply McVittie and Price, delighted that any of the\r\nprincipal characters should condescend to speak to them.\r\n\r\n“Where’s our little Emily Jane?” he asks, tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Here, Daddy,” replies a sweet voice.\r\n\r\n“Where, my lovely one?”\r\n\r\n“In the chimney, Daddy”; and the dear child clambers down and rushes\r\ninto his arms without even waiting to brush off the soot. McVittie and\r\nPrice make clucking noises of approval and delight. This is typical of\r\nwhat goes on in the Balbus household every day. How can it be possible\r\nthat anything except joy should be in store for them? But ah----\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: Where is Mammy, my treasure?\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: Waiting for Daddy darling, in his study.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: Will my little heart ask her to come?\r\n\r\nEmily Jane trips away so happily and obediently. “Well, Price,” says\r\nMr. Balbus, “I must go and see how they’re getting on with the wall.”\r\n\r\n PRICE: Haven’t you finished it yet?\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: I don’t think I ever shall. Balbus was building a wall in\r\n the time of the Roman Empire; and I suppose he’ll go on for the rest\r\n of time.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE: Which wall is it this time, Balbus?\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: The Great Wall of China. They’ve retained me to go and\r\n inspect it. I leave to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Balbus hurries in and embraces her husband shamelessly. Emily Jane\r\nfollows and embraces them both. McVittie and Price, not to be outdone,\r\nembrace each other in the corner.\r\n\r\n“You’re going to China, my husband?” asks Mrs. Balbus, tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, wife.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go with you.”\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: And I, Daddy.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE & PRICE: We will come too, old friend.\r\n\r\nMr. Balbus beams at them through his tears. The audience beam at each\r\nother through theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThey have been wrecked.\r\n\r\nThey are all on a deserted island which, from the stunted shrubs\r\nand bleak outlook, is probably in the neighbourhood of Tristan da\r\nCunha. McVittie and Price are pretending to be tremendously brave and\r\ncontented over a meal of roasted berries.\r\n\r\n“These are really delicious,” says McVittie.\r\n\r\n“Capital,” says Price. “Have some more.”\r\n\r\n“No thanks. My doctor, you know. He won’t let me enjoy myself.”\r\n\r\n“A glass of this delicious rock-water, then. Most stimulating.”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear fellow. I’ve done magnificently. Not another sup.”\r\n\r\nBut it is really only pretend. The brave fellows are concealing their\r\nanxiety for fear of alarming Emily Jane and her mother who are resting\r\nin the bivouac near by. Actually they are full of apprehension.\r\n\r\n“Price,” says McVittie at last, leaning forward mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“McVittie?” He leans forward too; their long noses almost touch.\r\n\r\n“I’m uneasy.” A hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n“So am I. Very.” A squeak of terror.\r\n\r\n“I’ve found out the name of this island, Price.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\nMcVittie sinks his voice even deeper.\r\n\r\n“It’s called--Umborroweeboo.”\r\n\r\n“Gracious. What ever does that mean?”\r\n\r\n“It means....” His voice becomes blood-curdling in its intensity. “It\r\nmeans The-Island-that-wants-to-be-let-alone. It’s a sinister spot,\r\nPrice. They say....”\r\n\r\nDarkness begins to close in rapidly. Price shivers.\r\n\r\n“What do they say?”\r\n\r\n“They say it can vanish beneath the sea and reappear in another place,\r\nafter remaining submerged for years.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens.” Price is very uneasy. Emily Jane appears from the\r\nbivouac and prostrates herself on the ground.\r\n\r\n“I love you, dear little island,” she murmurs, kissing the shore. “I\r\nwould like to be married to a beautiful island like you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall come to claim that promise one day,” says a deep, rich voice\r\nfrom nowhere.\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: Did anyone speak?\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE: No one. I heard nothing.\r\n\r\n PRICE: I thought--why, what’s that?\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_emerging from a hollow tree_): What’s what?\r\n\r\n PRICE: That. There. Look.\r\n\r\n THE OTHERS: Where?\r\n\r\n PRICE: There. Look. Now it’s _there_. Quick. It’s moved again. (_A\r\n strain of unearthly music._)\r\n\r\n EVERYBODY: Hark. What’s that? (_Mrs. Balbus crawls out of the bivouac\r\n on her hands and knees._)\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS (_fondly_): John, you’ve left off your comforter.... Why\r\n are you all in a ring? You’ll have the fairies out if you stand in a\r\n ring.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE (_uneasily_): In a ring? I didn’t notice. I think----(_He\r\n turns to move away but finds himself rooted to the ground._) Well,\r\n this is most extraordinary.\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: What is extraordinary, dear Mr. McVittie?\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE: I can’t move hand or foot.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: Good Lord. Nor can I.\r\n\r\n PRICE: Nor I.\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: I can a little. It’s getting very difficult. Now _I_ can’t\r\n either. (_The strain of music is heard again._)\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS: Ugh! The horrid thing’s got hold of _me_ now. I can’t\r\n move either. John, make them stop it at once.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_feebly_): How can I, my dear? I’m quite powerless.\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE (_illusion suddenly stripped from her eyes--for that is\r\n what happens under the spell of this magic island_): Oh, Daddy, I\r\n thought there was nothing you couldn’t do. And now, now--you’re just\r\n like anybody else.\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS (_critically_): You certainly look strange, John; not at\r\n all your usual self.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_for the first time seeing his wife and daughter as they\r\n really are_): Please be quiet both of you and don’t talk about things\r\n you don’t understand. McVittie, what are we to do?\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE (_philosophically_): Wait for the island to disappear, I\r\n suppose. (_The strain of music sounds once more._)\r\n\r\n PRICE (_excitedly_): There it is moving about again. The thing I saw\r\n before.\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: It’s like a tiny, tiny man.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: I don’t fancy this at all.\r\n\r\n PRICE: It’s coming nearer. (_An elvish figure appears dancing towards\r\n them. It is puffing a stupendous pipe._)\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_trying to be severe and failing signally_): Who are you,\r\n please?\r\n\r\n THE FIGURE (_dancing more than ever_): Macconachie.\r\n\r\n EMILY JANE: What do you mean by trespassing on our island?\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: I live here. It’s my home. You are the trespassers. But\r\n you’re very welcome. (_With goblin glee._) I’ve been waiting for you,\r\n for a long time.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: Waiting for us. Nonsense. You don’t know who we are, even.\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: Oh yes I do. I’ve been watching you for a long time.\r\n Especially Emily Jane. I want Emily Jane.\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS: Want Emily Jane? The idea of such a thing! Go away, Sir,\r\n at once.\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: You think you’re her mother, I suppose? (_Addressing\r\n Balbus_) And you believe yourself to be her father?\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_with dignity_): I certainly do.\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: But you’re not, you’re not. She’s mine.\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS (_indignantly_): Sir! John, don’t listen to a word he says.\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: You’re all mine. I want you all.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE (_hoarsely_): Want us all? What for, may I ask?\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: To draw tears from simple hearts. You’ll see.\r\n\r\nBut they don’t understand at all, and look blankly at one another, as\r\nhe flits about like a will o’ the wisp still puffing at his gigantic\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room again. They are all, except Emily Jane, sitting there\r\nin disconsolate melancholy.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_with a deep sigh_): It’s for the best of course.... But I\r\n miss her sadly.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE & PRICE: It’s terrible, terrible. (_They sigh_).\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS: I always felt there was something unearthly about the\r\n child. (_She sighs very deeply._)\r\n\r\nThere is a long pause. They are thinking of their terrible experience\r\nwhen Macconachie flitted over their heads like a sprite, and the solid\r\nisland sank beneath their feet, and they were left clinging to a raft.\r\n\r\n“When the island began to submerge”--begins Mr. Balbus, and then he\r\nchecks himself with a sob.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE (_for the hundredth time_): I could have sworn I had her in\r\n my arms on the raft. (_His voice breaks._)\r\n\r\n PRICE: You didn’t hear the Voice--\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS: Voice--what voice?\r\n\r\n PRICE: Something about claiming a promise. And she gave a little cry\r\n of wonder. I heard it. (_He walks gloomily over to the window._)\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_suddenly enlightened_): That’s what Macconachie meant,\r\n when he said “to draw tears from simple hearts.” I begin to\r\n understand....\r\n\r\n PRICE (_at the window_): How very curious.\r\n\r\n MRS. BALBUS: My curtains? They are certainly not.\r\n\r\n PRICE (_in choking tones_): Look at the lake--it’s drying up, or\r\n something.\r\n\r\nThey all rush to the window. An amazing thing is in progress. The\r\nbottom of the lake seems to be rising. Stunted shrubs are pushing\r\nthemselves above the water.\r\n\r\n“My gracious powers, it’s the island,” cries Mr. Balbus.\r\n\r\n PRICE (_quoting McVittie’s long-forgotten remark_): They say it can\r\n vanish beneath the sea, and reappear in another place after remaining\r\n submerged for years.\r\n\r\n MCVITTIE: There’s somebody moving on it. Look. Among the trees.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: It’s Macconachie. (_He hails the island. Macconachie comes\r\n ashore, and flits up to the house_.)\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS (_in a trembling voice_): Where is she, Sir? Tell us where\r\n she is?\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: Emily Jane? She’s touring in America. Making a fortune.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: But will she come back, Sir?\r\n\r\n MACCONACHIE: If you need her sufficiently, and wish for her often\r\n enough, and believe with strength, she will assuredly come back.\r\n\r\n MR. BALBUS: But why should she have been taken from us, Sir? We loved\r\n her, cared for her. She was happy with us.\r\n\r\n“To carry my message to the hearts of men,” replies Macconachie, with\r\na wistful smile. “I may need any of you in the future and then----” He\r\npauses. “But till then farewell.” And he flits through the window; and\r\nthe island submerges again. But the others sit in rapt silence, for\r\nthey have seen beyond the veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WILSON\r\n\r\n(_A Chronicle in the manner of John Drinkwater._)\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE I.--_The President’s Chamber in the White House, Autumn, 1918._\r\n\r\n WOODROW WILSON, _lean, single-purposed, masterful, is signing State\r\n documents with inflexible pen_. JOSEPH TUMULTY, _a chubby little\r\n man, is leaning affectionately on the back of the President’s chair,\r\n following the movements of his pen with dog-like veneration. The\r\n President, still writing, breaks the silence without looking up._\r\n\r\n WILSON: Tumulty.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: Yes, Governor.\r\n\r\n WILSON: I wouldn’t have you think I’m insensible to the merits of your\r\n proposals--but I can’t accept them. In the bargainings and shifts of\r\n the Allies I must be unfettered, if necessary blindly followed, by\r\n the American delegation. Otherwise there’ll be another Congress of\r\n Vienna.... It’s not that I criticise our Allies, I would be loath to\r\n do that; but I understand their passions and distress. Firmness on\r\n our part may perhaps redress the balance.... Where’s Lansing? (_The\r\n Secretary of State comes in._)\r\n\r\n LANSING: Good morning, Mr. President.\r\n\r\n WILSON (_wistfully_): Why--you’re mighty formal, Lansing. I’ve not to\r\n convince you again, I trust. Why, Lansing----\r\n\r\n LANSING: I hold, as you know, that with the Republicans in a majority\r\n in both Houses, it’s an act of, I won’t say folly, Mr. President, but\r\n an act of ill-judgment to have them uncommitted to the terms of peace.\r\n\r\n WILSON: I’m taking Hoover and White.\r\n\r\n LANSING: White means nothing, and Hoover is only an expert. Lodge,\r\n Root, Leonard Wood should all go with you as delegates.\r\n\r\n WILSON: No, Mr. Secretary. (TUMULTY _bows his head as if to a blow_.)\r\n No, a thousand times.\r\n\r\n LANSING: They’ll tear up your work otherwise. I speak as your friend,\r\n Mr. President. Myself as you know I don’t think extravagantly well of\r\n your plan for a League of Nations. I’ve never disguised that. Though\r\n a fine ideal it isn’t practical----But setting my views aside, and\r\n speaking as a friend to the proposal, because it’s your proposal, I\r\n feel bound to say that, if the Republicans aren’t pledged to it in\r\n advance, it will never pass Congress.\r\n\r\n WILSON (_affectionately_): Lansing, you’re so logical and clear there\r\n seems to be no escape from your reasoning. I’ve no doubt you size up\r\n the Republican intentions mighty well. But you’re wrong for all that;\r\n and where you go wrong is right at the beginning. Don’t you see the\r\n choice of evils before me? If I don’t take the Republicans they may\r\n try to wreck my work when it’s done, true; but if I do take them the\r\n work won’t be done at all.\r\n\r\n LANSING (_stiffly_): I can’t allow that, Mr. President. They’re good,\r\n patriotic Americans.\r\n\r\n WILSON: Who says they aren’t? Who suggests for one moment that they\r\n won’t do their best for America and the Allies? But will they do the\r\n best for the world? (LANSING _is silent_.) Will they tie the world\r\n up in a League against war; or will they inflict a vindictive peace,\r\n that’ll do no more than sow the seeds of another?\r\n\r\n LANSING: You distrust their patriotism?\r\n\r\n WILSON: Never. I distrust their passions. Or say I’m wrong. Say their\r\n conception of the peace is the proper one, and mine a delusion. How\r\n can we work together? The Delegation couldn’t be depended on to agree\r\n in the smallest particular. I should just be playing a lone hand; and\r\n the Allies, knowing my house to be divided against itself, would put\r\n me aside in the Conference like a cipher. No, Lansing. I’ll go to\r\n Paris with those on whom I can rely. I’ll so tie up the peace with\r\n the League, that the one can’t live without the other; and if, as you\r\n prophesy, I find myself deserted by Congress, I’ll go over their heads\r\n to the American people in whose ideals the thing has its roots. That\r\n is my final decision.\r\n\r\n LANSING: I hope you’ll not regret it.\r\n\r\n (_He takes his leave. The others follow him with their eyes. The\r\n President gives a half laugh._)\r\n\r\n WILSON: Ah, if one could only add to the good qualities one’s friends\r\n possess, the good qualities one would have them possess.... (_He\r\n sighs_). These Commissions (_holding up the papers he has signed_),\r\n they’re all in order now?\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: Yes, Governor.\r\n\r\n WILSON: Deliver them yourself. (_He reads out the names as he hands\r\n them over._) House ... Lansing ... White.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE CLOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE II.--WILSON’S _house in the Place des Etats Unis, Paris, in the\r\n year 1919. A spring morning. The windows of the room look out upon an\r\n old-world square--made safe for democracy by American detectives._\r\n\r\n WOODROW WILSON _sits in a deep armchair by the table. His colleagues_\r\n CLEMENCEAU, DAVID LLOYD GEORGE _and_ ORLANDO _are grouped around him_.\r\n\r\n WILSON: Gentlemen, a little merriment would season our labours.\r\n (_Polite murmurs._) There was a man, a Confederate soldier, in our\r\n civil war, who soliloquised thus on a long hard march: “I love my\r\n country, and I’m fighting for my country; but if this war ends I’ll be\r\n dad-burned if I ever love another country.”\r\n\r\n THE OTHERS (_spiritlessly_): Ha! Ha! Ha!\r\n\r\n WILSON: Signor Orlando, you don’t laugh.\r\n\r\n ORLANDO: No, sare.\r\n\r\n WILSON: I’m sorry. The point of my story was somewhat directed to\r\n you. I feel rather like that Confederate soldier. I took the American\r\n people into war; but I don’t mean to have them dragged into another by\r\n a bad territorial settlement in the Adriatic!\r\n\r\n ORLANDO: Well, Fiume can be waiting.\r\n\r\n WILSON: All things can wait. But don’t, I beg you, fall into error. My\r\n view of that matter will never change. Monsieur Clemenceau, Gentlemen,\r\n be with me in this I entreat you. (_A brief silence._) And now, Part I\r\n of the Treaty. We are agreed to incorporate the Covenant of the League\r\n of Nations there? (_There is still silence._) Gentlemen, I can’t\r\n think that you hesitate----\r\n\r\n CLEMENCEAU: Sur cette question de la Société des Nations. Il est bien\r\n entendu, n’est ce pas, que la Traité de Garantie, La Pacte, entre La\r\n France, Les Etats Unis, et la Grande Bretagne----?\r\n\r\n WILSON: Why, Mr. Lloyd George will answer for England, but I guess\r\n there’s no doubt at all concerning America.\r\n\r\n LLOYD GEORGE: As the President says, I answer for Great Britain. I\r\n have agreed in her name that, in certain conditions, she shall be\r\n bound to act with France. On the fulfilment of those conditions, she\r\n will so act.\r\n\r\n CLEMENCEAU: Alors, en principe je suis d’accord.\r\n\r\n WILSON: In principle. Yes, Monsieur. In principle we have never\r\n differed. But on the concrete proposition that this Covenant as\r\n drafted be embodied in the Treaty----?\r\n\r\n CLEMENCEAU: Well, I do not object.\r\n\r\n WILSON: You take a weight from my mind.... I wish to be frank,\r\n Gentlemen. I am not happy about the voting of the British Empire\r\n in the Assembly of the League. I can’t disguise from you that it’s\r\n a difficult provision to explain to the American people. It may\r\n antagonise them. I make a final effort. Mr. Lloyd George, would your\r\n Dominions be irreconcilable to exercising their vote in one Empire\r\n delegation?\r\n\r\n LLOYD GEORGE: They would reject it, Mr. President. I myself would move\r\n the rejection. (_A brief pause._)\r\n\r\n WILSON: I put the question formally. That the Covenant, as drafted,\r\n stand embodied in the Treaty of Peace. (_Aye._) Gentlemen, I thank\r\n you for your forbearance. These questions of the Saar Valley and\r\n Danzig.... (_They pass to other business._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE CLOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE III.--_The anteroom of a public hall at Pueblo in the Western\r\n States, during_ PRESIDENT WILSON’S _tour on behalf of the Treaty of\r\n Versailles. September 25th, 1919. When the door is open, the speaker’s\r\n voice in the main hall is distinctly audible._\r\n\r\n ADMIRAL GRAYSON _is waiting anxiously_. MRS. WILSON _hurries in_.\r\n\r\n MRS. WILSON: The President--it’s critical. He must be persuaded\r\n against continuing this tour.\r\n\r\n GRAYSON: I have been saying that, ma’am, for a long time.\r\n\r\n MRS. WILSON: But it grows more urgent. I left the platform to find\r\n you. How he’ll finish I don’t know. He was swaying and the utterance\r\n seemed more difficult each minute. Nothing but his iron determination\r\n sustains him.\r\n\r\n GRAYSON: Nothing but the depth of his convictions and his devotion to\r\n the task he has begun, have brought him so far.\r\n\r\n MRS. WILSON: You must prevail on him, Admiral. If he breaks, the\r\n League breaks. Use that with him.\r\n\r\n GRAYSON: Prevail. Have you ever tried, ma’am, to prevail upon a\r\n monolith? (TUMULTY _enters, jubilant_). How does it go?\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: He’s carrying them. The old wonderful Wilson touch. Listen.\r\n\r\n _He throws open the door. The President’s rich, musical voice, full of\r\n power, is borne in upon them._\r\n\r\n MRS. WILSON: Why, he sounds to be quite recovered.\r\n\r\n GRAYSON (_reverently_): Hush, ma’am. It is the voice of a prophet.\r\n\r\n WILSON (_off_): Now that the mists of this great question have cleared\r\n away, I believe that men will see the truth, eye to eye and face to\r\n face. There is one thing that the American people always rise to and\r\n extend their hand to, and that is the truth of justice and of liberty\r\n and of peace. We have accepted that truth, and we are going to be led\r\n by it; and it is going to lead us, and through us the world, out into\r\n pastures of quietness and peace, such as the world never dreamed of\r\n before.\r\n\r\n _Prolonged applause. The President enters, followed by local magnates\r\n and his staff._\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: Oh, Governor, this is the best you’ve ever done.\r\n\r\n WILSON: Tumulty, it does me good to hear you speak so. I guess--why,\r\n surely this building is strangely unsteady--or--Everything’s going.\r\n Why, Grayson, it’s--it’s dark.\r\n\r\n GRAYSON: Bear up, Sir. A touch of vertigo. You’re tired.\r\n\r\n WILSON (_horror in his eyes_): No. My speech. Failing. I\r\n can’t--articulate.\r\n\r\n _He sinks into_ GRAYSON’S _arms, and is lowered into a chair_. MRS.\r\n WILSON _falls on her knees beside him_.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: In God’s name, Admiral----?\r\n\r\n GRAYSON: Paralysis. The tour is over.\r\n\r\n _They prepare to carry the President away._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE CLOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE IV.--_A room in the White House.

The President is reading a telegram._\r\n\r\n WILSON: Tumulty, this is bitter. Bitter.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: Yes, Governor.\r\n\r\n WILSON: They’re meeting beyond the sea in Paris. The League that\r\n received birth in American ideals. And the chair of America is empty,\r\n not by the declared wish of the people--I’d not believe it, were such\r\n a wish expressed--but by the strength of personal rancour in the\r\n Senate. It’s unbelievable.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: And no one there to represent American ideals and aspirations!\r\n\r\n WILSON: Brazil. This telegram says the Brazilian spoke for the whole\r\n American continent: that was brave and far-sighted of him. But it cuts\r\n me to the heart to think that the duty of speaking for America should\r\n rest elsewhere than on us.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: It’s hard.\r\n\r\n WILSON: Hard? It’s cynically false. Tumulty. I can’t believe that is\r\n the wish of the country. I will take them the Covenant with my two\r\n hands, reason with them, explain....\r\n\r\n TUMULTY (_gently_): No, dear Governor, you have done all that a man\r\n could do. Another effort would waste your life----\r\n\r\n WILSON: I would give it gladly.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: To no purpose, now.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE CLOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE V.--_The Presidential Room at the Capitol, Washington. Just\r\n before 12 noon on March 4th, 1921_.\r\n\r\n WOODROW WILSON, MARSHALL, _the Vice-President, and_ TUMULTY _are\r\n waiting for the hour to strike that will make_ WARREN HARDING\r\n _President of the United States of America, and_ WILSON _a free\r\n citizen again._\r\n\r\n WILSON: They have been great years to live in. I’ve tried to be worthy\r\n of them.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: And succeeded, with Lincoln and George Washington, Governor.\r\n\r\n WILSON (_shyly_): You put me in mighty good company. Anyone can\r\n be great in great times. The events we’ve been through called for\r\n something superhuman. I wish I could have given that.\r\n\r\n MARSHALL: No man could have done more, Mr. President. Some day the\r\n world will see it.\r\n\r\n WILSON: Marshall, I’m not ambitious for the world to see any such\r\n thing. I want my work to prosper. That is all.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: It has made a beginning.\r\n\r\n WILSON: A small beginning, a halting beginning, but a beginning, yes.\r\n Yet when I think of what the League could be doing to facilitate a\r\n general settling down to peace, if only America were behind it-- And\r\n yet again, perhaps it is well. Maybe, if things had not so fallen\r\n out, the weaknesses of the thing we made would not have become\r\n manifest, until it was too late for improvement.\r\n\r\n MARSHALL: You think it has weaknesses?\r\n\r\n WILSON: The highest product of man’s mind, the law, is full of\r\n weaknesses, Marshall. How can this new conception have escaped them?\r\n But the idea will surely triumph. I have faith.\r\n\r\n TUMULTY: The new administration will kill it, if they can.\r\n\r\n WILSON: I have faith.... It must be nearly time now.\r\n\r\n _A tall, spare man followed by his colleagues walks into the Chamber.\r\n This is_ SENATOR LODGE, _the President’s life-long political foe_.\r\n\r\n LODGE (_stiffly_): Mr. President, we have come, as a Committee of\r\n the Senate, to notify you that the Senate and the House are about to\r\n adjourn, and await your pleasure.\r\n\r\n WILSON (_rising with majesty_): Senator Lodge, I have no further\r\n communication to make. I thank you.... The few seconds now remaining\r\n no more than suffice me to lay down the authority derived from my\r\n office. (_The clock strikes twelve._) Gentlemen, I wish you well, and\r\n farewell. Come, Tumulty.\r\n\r\n _He goes. Simultaneously a roar of applause without, proclaims the\r\n accession of_ PRESIDENT HARDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENE CLOSES.\r\n\r\n[THE END.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEMIMA BLOGGS\r\n\r\n(_A Play of Life as it is, in the Manchester manner of Mr. St. John\r\nErvine._)\r\n\r\n\r\nACT I\r\n\r\n SCENE: _A dingy parlour in a London Suburb. Two men in ill-fitting\r\n garments are sitting glumly, in comfortless chairs with shabby and\r\n rather soiled covers, on either side of a dismal mockery of a fire.\r\n The room is lit with incandescent gas, which shows a sickly yellow\r\n through a raw haze, offensively compounded of “London Particular” and\r\n the penetrating yellow fumes of cheap coal. The men are_ JOSEPH BLOGGS\r\n _(52), one of life’s many failures, and_ HENRY HOOKER _(49), another\r\n of them. Their tired white faces are resting on their hands, and\r\n they are staring into the smoking grate. At last_ HOOKER _breaks the\r\n intolerable silence_.\r\n\r\n HOOKER (_gloomily_): The fire’s smoking.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: Yes. (_He pokes it. The fire smoulders angrily. They cough.\r\n There is a pause._ HOOKER _looks out of the window_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n HOOKER (_darkly_): It’s raining.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_with a deep sigh_): Yes.... Has the fog lifted?\r\n\r\n HOOKER: No. It’s getting thicker.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_with resignation_): Ah, well. (JEMIMA (42) _comes in,\r\n tiredly. She is the wife of_ BLOGGS, _a thin, prematurely grey-haired\r\n woman, haggard with cares. The fire welcomes her with a spiteful\r\n volley of lyddite._)\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_wearily_): You’re here, are you?\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: Yes.... The fire’s smoking.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_with a sigh_): I’ll make it up. (_She makes a listless attack\r\n on it with the poker. The fire goes out._) The coals are so bad. (_She\r\n painfully rekindles it._)\r\n\r\n HOOKER: Yes.\r\n\r\n Jemima (_addressing_ BLOGGS): That kid’s very bad again. She’s\r\n coughing something awful.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: Better have the doctor.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Perhaps Mr. Hooker would tell him on his way home?\r\n\r\n HOOKER: Yes.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: The gas company’s going to cut off the gas to-morrow,\r\n unless--Joseph, couldn’t we pay something on account?\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: I’ll see what I can do.\r\n\r\n HOOKER: Life’s very hard.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Yes. (_She begins to lay the table with enamel cups and\r\n saucers._) You’ll stay for tea, Mr. Hooker?\r\n\r\n HOOKER (_drearily_): Yes. I suppose so. (_They wait in silent misery\r\n for the kettle to boil._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURTAIN FALLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOOKER: Life’s very hard.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE: _The same room, slightly more dingy._ JEMIMA BLOGGS, _her\r\n husband, and a_ DOCTOR _are standing under the gas bracket_. HOOKER,\r\n _as usual, is crouching over the starveling fire_.\r\n\r\n THE DOCTOR (_curtly_): She can’t live. It’s only a matter of days,\r\n perhaps hours. I must go.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: Can nothing be done?\r\n\r\n THE DOCTOR: Can you send her to the Riviera?\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: No. Would that cure her?\r\n\r\n THE DOCTOR: It might.... I’m sorry. Good-day. (_He goes._)\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_in a shaking voice_): I’ll get your tea, Joseph. (_She begins\r\n taking down the cups and laying the table._)\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_as if in a trance_): The Riviera might save her. (_He takes\r\n his hat._)\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Won’t you wait for tea before you go?\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: I don’t want any tea. (_He slouches miserably out._)\r\n\r\n HOOKER: The fog’s very thick.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Yes.\r\n\r\n HOOKER: It’s still raining. (_He takes his hat and coat._)\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Won’t you stay for tea, Mr. Hooker?\r\n\r\n HOOKER: I don’t feel equal to tea. (_He goes out unsteadily._ JEMIMA\r\n _sits wretchedly by the smouldering hearth. The child cries out in its\r\n delirium. The fog steals into the room obscuring everything._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURTAIN FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE: _The same room--if possible dingier than ever._ JEMIMA _is\r\n sitting hunched up by the fire, which is enveloping her in a yellow\r\n cloud_. BLOGGS _is pushed into the room by a hard-faced man_.\r\n\r\n THE HARD-FACED MAN (_grimly_): I’ve brought you back your husband,\r\n ma’am. You may as well know he’s discharged from my employment.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_tonelessly_): Oh?\r\n\r\n THE H.F.M.: And lucky he’s not prosecuted.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_as before_): Oh?\r\n\r\n THE H.F.M.: Embezzlement’s a serious thing.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Yes.... Starvation’s serious too.\r\n\r\n THE H.F.M.: That’s your affair.... I don’t want thanks. I don’t intend\r\n to prosecute, because it’s a nuisance. That’s all.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Yes.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_inadvertently stepping out of the picture_): I tell you I\r\n did it to save my little girl. She’s dying. I must have money to save\r\n her--to send her abroad. Oh, Amy, Amy, my child. (_He tries in vain to\r\n sob._)\r\n\r\n THE H.F.M. (_chillingly_): No sentiment, please! This is not the\r\n Lyceum.... Now, I’m going. I hope I never see either of you again. I\r\n don’t care two straws whether the girl dies or not. And I won’t wish\r\n you luck, because I don’t specially want you to have it, and anyway\r\n you wouldn’t get it. (_But they are paying no attention, and he goes._)\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_listlessly_): Doctor’s been again.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_the same_): Oh yes?\r\n\r\n JEMIMA: Says she’s getting better.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: Is she? (_He sits by the fire in his hat and coat. The\r\n inevitable_ HOOKER _slouches in, similarly clad, and takes his place\r\n on the other side. A melancholy silence reigns._)\r\n\r\n HOOKER (_at last_): It’s raining again.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_bringing in the milk-jug_): The thunder’s turned the milk\r\n sour.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_dismally_): I thought it would.\r\n\r\n HOOKER (_shivering, and hugging himself in his coat_): There’s a thick\r\n fog, and it’s very damp.\r\n\r\n BLOGGS (_gloomily_): There always is.\r\n\r\n HOOKER: Yes. (_The fire contributes to the general depression by a\r\n shower of soot, and a sudden belch of acrid yellow fumes._)\r\n\r\n BLOGGS: Jemima, the fire’s smoking.\r\n\r\n JEMIMA (_wearily_): I’ll make it up in a minute. (_She worries it\r\n with various implements. More soot falls and the smoke increases. She\r\n stirs it aimlessly with the poker. It flickers and goes out for the\r\n last time. They, and the audience, are too depressed to care. They sit\r\n staring blankly at the grate as the cold and fog gradually invade the\r\n room._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURTAIN FALLS VERY SLOWLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER EASTERN SKIES\r\n\r\n(_A Romantic Drama suitable for performance at His Majesty’s Theatre_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n FIRST SCENE.--_A street in Damascus, copied, with meticulous\r\n exactitude, from the Byway of Beggars in that famous city. Even the\r\n smells are there--thanks to an ingenious contrivance of concealed\r\n sprays, by means of which the appropriate odour is insinuated into the\r\n nostrils of the audience._\r\n\r\n _A party of camels, an elephant and a couple of giraffes, are\r\n loitering about in the charge of officials from the Zoological Gardens\r\n disguised as Bedouin Sheiks._ ALI BABA, SINBAD THE SAILOR, SHIBLI\r\n BAGARAG, _and other familiar Eastern figures are exchanging hoarse\r\n Oriental salutations from their houses and shops. Goats, sheep,\r\n goatwomen, shepherds, etc., complete the picture._\r\n\r\n ALI BABA (_in a wailing shriek_): Inshallah, wullahy, eywallah.\r\n\r\n SHIBLI BAGARAG (_lamenting_): Eywah! Traadisveribadahii! (_He beats\r\n his breast_).\r\n\r\n A PASSER-BY (_indignantly addressing a stolid camel-driver_):\r\n Bismillah, O Son of my Uncle, have thy camels, on whom be peace,\r\n acquired a _firman_ investing in them the sole use of this highway?\r\n\r\n THE OUTRAGED CAMEL-DRIVER (_forgetting his part and falling back on\r\n the language of Regent’s Park_): ’Ere. Look ’ere----\r\n\r\n ANOTHER PASSER-BY (_hastily interrupting, and turning upon the first\r\n with contumely_): Hence, brother of a baboon. Mock not dumb beasts, as\r\n it is written.\r\n\r\n A GOAT: M-a-a-a-a.\r\n\r\n A GOATWOMAN: Aie, little one, muzzle thy tongue ... (_resuming her\r\n conversation_). In sooth, O my father, as thou dost say----\r\n\r\n THE GOAT (_rebelliously_): M-a-a-a-a-a.\r\n\r\n THE GOATWOMAN: Arree, be silent, child of misfortune, or thou shalt\r\n see the inside of a stewpan. (_The goat thinks better of it._)\r\n\r\n THE HAJJI OSKARASHI BEN DAOUD BEN ISMAIL (_a holy and very dirty\r\n man of enormous size, sinister appearance and awe-inspiring voice,\r\n appearing from a hovel_): Alms. Alms for the love of Allah. (_People\r\n give him money. He takes it nonchalantly and without thanks._) Alms in\r\n the name of the Compassionate. (_He moves majestically on, until he\r\n meets a disreputable-looking being who has just emerged from a side\r\n street. Aside to this apparition._) Is all arranged?\r\n\r\n HIS CONFEDERATE (_in a low tone_): Ya, holy one. (_At the top of his\r\n voice in order to deceive everyone except the audience._) Nay, I have\r\n nothing for thee, thou evil-smelling and consummate old humbug.\r\n\r\n OSKARASHI (_whining_): Deny not of thy plenty, O gracious benefactor,\r\n as it is written. (_Aside_) What is the signal?\r\n\r\n HIS CONFEDERATE (_giving money with bad grace_): Veialeikum a-salaam,\r\n O holy one. (_Aside_) Three raps on the outer postern gate: and\r\n then----\r\n\r\n OSKARASHI (_showing his teeth in a terrible smile_): And then--blood\r\n and much booty (_passing on_). Alms in the name of Allah.\r\n\r\n THE GOAT (_unable to contain itself_): M-a-a-a-a-a!\r\n\r\n THE CAMELS AND GIRAFFES: M-o-o-o-o-o!\r\n\r\n THE ELEPHANT--_But no, we cannot describe the cry of the elephant._\r\n\r\n A MUEZZIN (_appearing on his minaret_): La Allah il Allah (_a bell\r\n tolls. The faithful prostrate themselves towards the East_).\r\n\r\n\r\n SECOND SCENE.--_Bagdad. The harem of Oskarashi ben Daoud, etc. We\r\n deduce either that alms-seeking in the East is a highly lucrative\r\n profession, or else that the “much booty,” referred to in the first\r\n scene, proved even more abundant than was expected. The harem is\r\n an enormous apartment, about the size of the Albert Hall, with a\r\n swimming pool fed by a golden fountain in the centre, and rows of\r\n marble colonnades receding in all directions into an apparently\r\n illimitable distance. A vast concourse of beautiful and, despite their\r\n biscuit-coloured complexions, unmistakably European young women,\r\n languish on cushions of every variety of texture and colouring._\r\n\r\n _A pair of acrobats, a jazz band of strange instruments, and some kind\r\n of Oriental glee party are giving a simultaneous performance. Some\r\n withered crones with birches are chastising certain recalcitrant wives\r\n in a corner. Our friends the camels, giraffes and elephants have been\r\n replaced by a party of leopards, duck-billed platypuses, anthropoid\r\n apes, okapis and tapirs._ OSKARASHI _himself, comatose after an\r\n enormous Eastern supper, is keeping awake with difficulty, propped up\r\n against a mound of cushions piled on a huge divan. Entwined around\r\n him, serpent-wise, is Zobeide el Okra, the Bulbul of the harem._\r\n\r\n THE GLEE PARTY (_bursting into the well-known Eastern ditty_):\r\n\r\n    We sit and gobble with chopsticks and spoon\r\n    From the midnight hour to the stroke of noon,\r\n    Gobble at work and----\r\n\r\n OSKARASHI: Enough. Let them be dispatched. (_Black slaves hurl them\r\n into the Tigris, which obligingly flows near by._) Let the feast\r\n proceed. (_An obsequious conjurer appears; nobody, however, pays any\r\n attention, except the junior members of the audience, who are properly\r\n fascinated._)\r\n\r\n ONE OF THE ACROBATS (_drawing aside his disguise and revealing himself\r\n as the terrible_ ASWARAK--_whom we forgot to mention in Scene I, but\r\n who plays an important part in the proceedings. He addresses one of\r\n the attendants, who draws aside his disguise and reveals the features\r\n of the dreaded_ BOO BOO): All is ready?\r\n\r\n BOO BOO (_grimly_): Ya Aswarak. Allah hath favoured us. Every door is\r\n stopped and the black guards have received their price.\r\n\r\n ASWARAK: It is well.... Remember she is to be mine.\r\n\r\n BOO BOO: Whom--I mean who?\r\n\r\n ASWARAK (_rapturously_): The Bulbul of the night, the reward of the\r\n favoured of Islam.\r\n\r\n BOO BOO: Have a care, Holy One, we may be overheard.\r\n\r\n ASWARAK: And the signal?\r\n\r\n BOO BOO: Thy song. (_The conjurer concludes his entertainment._)\r\n\r\n ASWARAK: I will now sing.\r\n\r\n EVERYONE: Oh, Allah, must this be?\r\n\r\n OSKARASHI (_grimly_): Let him sing. Guards be at hand to do my bidding.\r\n\r\n ASWARAK (_aside_): Thy last bidding in this world, O corpulent Father\r\n of Obscenity. (_Aloud_) As thou sayest, O Protector of the Poor. (_He\r\n takes his lute and sings, gazing ardently--almost too ardently--at\r\n Zobeide_):\r\n\r\n             Ah, when the sun\r\n             Gives up the ghost;\r\n             And lovers run,\r\n             With ardent boast,\r\n\r\n             To woo the one\r\n             Each fancies most--\r\n             The stars arise\r\n             Behind thine eyes\r\n             O Bulbul.\r\n\r\n    ALL:     O Bul-bul-bul.\r\n\r\n    ASWARAK: And I thy sighs\r\n             Apostrophize\r\n             O Bulbul.\r\n\r\n    ALL:     O Bul-bul-bul--\r\n\r\n OSKARASHI (_who has no intention of allowing this kind of thing to go\r\n on_): Enough! Well sung, Minstrel. (_Darkly_) Thy reward?\r\n\r\n ASWARAK (_throwing off his disguise_): Thy head, Father of\r\n Abomination. (_Tumult. He draws a sword and rushes at the divan.\r\n The wives scuttle wailing, pursued by the guards, who pour into\r\n the chamber. Everyone runs shouting after someone else._ OSKARASHI\r\n _strikes his assailants into a heap, and hurls himself roaring into\r\n the Tigris. The curtain falls upon a writhing mass of humanity._)\r\n\r\n\r\n THIRD SCENE.--_The action has for some reason shifted to\r\n China--probably in order that Mr. Gloomy Bishop, the celebrated\r\n producer, may be enabled to show the London public what he is really\r\n capable of, when he cares to extend himself. The stage, therefore,\r\n is a blaze of red lacquer and Chinese Lanterns, supplemented by\r\n pagodas, palanquins and pigtails. A forbidding archway of crumbling\r\n masonry--flanked on either side by a barbaric figure armed with\r\n crossbow, javelin, long horsehair moustache and a hideous expression\r\n of brutality, indicates that the action is about to continue at\r\n the Gateway of the Lotus--a bypath in Old Pekin._ OSKARASHI, _the\r\n Venerable Hajji, has lain here in honourable concealment ever\r\n since his escape in the Tigris. But ah! his hiding place has been\r\n discovered. This is made apparent by the highly suspicious conduct of\r\n two strolling passers-by, whose physical characteristics appear to\r\n correspond more or less accurately with those of_ ASWARAK _and the\r\n odious_ BOO BOO.\r\n\r\n FIRST STROLLER (_accosting the other with all the honeyed courtesy of\r\n the Celestial Empire_): Honourable Dweller in a foreign land, deign\r\n to accept of my accursed superfluity. (_Gives money and continues in\r\n an undertone_) The detested of Islam has been discovered.\r\n\r\n SECOND STROLLER (_performing the ceremonies, observances and\r\n obeisances prescribed in the canons of Celestial etiquette_): May the\r\n shadow of this undeserving one diminish and disappear, if he should\r\n unworthily be found wanting in gratitude to your honourable and\r\n beatific and excellent self. (_Pouches the coins and continues also in\r\n an undertone_) Where, O Father of Procrastination?\r\n\r\n FIRST STROLLER: As Confucius justly remarks, charity--(_dropping his\r\n voice_). In a certain hovel in the back street beyond the wall, he\r\n conceals himself, plying the disreputable calling--may his porkers\r\n perish--of a seller of swine’s flesh--the curse of the prophet’s beard\r\n be upon him. Everything is arranged. To-night we surround the house:\r\n rush in at the appointed hour: and nail him to the counter in the\r\n midst of his abominable merchandise. Bismillah.\r\n\r\n SECOND STROLLER (_fiercely_): Inshallah! (_Louder_) The honourable\r\n greeting of your illustrious Excellency has brought sunshine and hope\r\n into the miserable existence of this one.\r\n\r\n FIRST STROLLER: Your honourable praise is sweeter in the ears of this\r\n obsequious rubbish-heap, than the music of the Celestial stars. Peace\r\n be with you.\r\n\r\n _They depart. A bundle of rags and blankets in a neighbouring corner\r\n suddenly comes to life, and reveals the familiar lineaments of\r\n Oskarashi, as he slinks away, like an enormous anthropoid ape, to his\r\n hovel in the back street beyond the wall._\r\n\r\n\r\n FOURTH SCENE.--_We now find ourselves at night in an even more ancient\r\n and dilapidated part of the city--the neighbourhood of the hovel in\r\n the back street, beyond the wall. A number of American tourists,\r\n shepherded by an unsightly and bespectacled Baboo from the local\r\n Cook’s office, are making a tour of these rather unsavoury precincts,\r\n before embarking to join the P. and O. steamer at Hong Kong. Lurking\r\n in the background are_ ASWARAK, BOO BOO AND CO., with an arsenal of\r\n weapons, closing in upon their enemy.\r\n\r\n THE BABOO (_addressing his audience collectively_):\r\n And--here--we--have--a--typical--example--of--the--ar--chitecture--of\r\n old--Pekin--dating--to--a--time--co--eval--with--Ginghis\r\n Khan--in--my--country.\r\n\r\n A TOURIST: My, Sally. Look at here! (_To the guide_) Say, cutey, what\r\n you callum this? (_She points to a procession forming up among the\r\n houses._)\r\n\r\n THE BABOO: This--is--a very--fortunate--circumstance.\r\n Ladies--and--gentlemen--we--are--about--to--witness--a--Manchu--funeral.\r\n\r\n ANOTHER TOURIST: Some guy pegged out, I guess.\r\n\r\n THE BABOO: We must--withdraw--to--one--side. (_They do so._)\r\n\r\n ASWARAK (_or_ BOO BOO): A thousand curses. We must delay the assault\r\n until this pig of an unbeliever has been taken away. (_They confer._)\r\n\r\n _The procession advances, headed by the Mourners, who are singing a\r\n terrible wailing melody. As they approach the words become audible._\r\n\r\n THE MOURNERS (_dolefully_):\r\n\r\n    Honourable mandarin gone west,\r\n    Welly sick belly and pain in chest,\r\n    Silly fellow leave off winter vest,\r\n    No can facee breeze.\r\n    First catchee chicken-pox, then get croup,\r\n    Double pneumonia, and off he poop:\r\n    Chop-suey, Laichee, Birds-nest-soup,\r\n    That’s good stage Chinese.\r\n\r\n (_They go out with their melancholy burden._)\r\n\r\n THE BABOO: We--will--now--return--in\r\n time--for--the--especial--dance--for--ladies--and\r\n gentlemen--at--the--Nautical--Club. (_He takes his tribe away._)\r\n\r\n (_The stage darkens._ ASWARAK AND CO. _begin to emerge stealthily from\r\n their hiding place. Red limelight illumines the stage. Weird music.\r\n They rush into the hovel. Reappear raving like Bedlamites._ OSKARASHI\r\n _has escaped. They realise that he was in the coffin of the Manchu\r\n funeral. In the thick of the hubbub, the voices of the returning\r\n mourners are heard._)\r\n\r\n THE MOURNERS (_returning_):\r\n\r\n    Chinky Chinky Chip Chip Choop,\r\n    And any damn rot you please,\r\n    Chop-suey, Laichee, Birds-nest-soup\r\n    Welly good stage Chinese.\r\n\r\n ASWARAK (_foaming at the mouth_): Halt, evil-tongued progeny of\r\n obscene mothers!\r\n\r\n THE MOURNERS (_tearing off their disguises_): What? Offal-eating scum\r\n of the bazaar! (_They fall on each other. The curtain falls on the\r\n familiar spectacle of writhing humanity._)\r\n\r\nThe last scene we are not sure about. It depends largely on the\r\ntemperamental judgment of Mr. Gloomy Bishop. It was originally planned\r\nto be the courtyard of the Dalai Lamasery of Thibet. Mr. Bishop,\r\nhowever, leans in favour of a Patagonian village or alternatively a\r\nstreet scene in Tristan d’Acunha. He thinks the latter might enable\r\nhim to introduce a talking penguin as a counterweight to Mr. Charles\r\nCochran’s singing duck. And he is not absolutely certain that he\r\nwouldn’t like a Honolulu surf scene, or perhaps a salt mining camp on\r\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria. Mr. Bishop is not sure; and he must have time\r\nto think it over.\r\n\r\nThings, therefore, are held up until the producer and author can come\r\nto an agreement. But on one thing the author is adamant. Oskarashi has\r\ngot to come to a sticky end. The author absolutely refuses to allow the\r\nfellow to be perpetuated in another play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VODKA BOTTLE\r\n\r\n(_A Play of Russian Life in the manner of Anton Tchekov._)\r\n\r\n\r\n _The study of Ivan Ivanovitch Bougárov, a wealthy landowner. Bougárov\r\n is alone at the desk. A vodka bottle and a measuring glass are at his\r\n elbow._\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_sniffing the glass_): It’s strong enough, I think.... Brr,\r\n what a filthy stench!... Where are the directions? (_He gropes for\r\n a piece of paper._) Here they are. Sprinkle it on toasted cheese,\r\n and leave it lying about in the vicinity of their holes. (_Examining\r\n the bottle._) That ought to be sufficient for all the rats in Little\r\n Russia as the saying is. (_Enter_ STEPAN STEPANOVITCH RUMBUNKSKI.)\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: Good morning, honoured Ivan Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Little Fathers, Stepan Stepanovitch, how you startled me.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: Your nerves are upset, my darling. You must give up the\r\n vodka, and all that.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: But my dear little Stepan Stepanovitch, you are wrong;\r\n because you see, my dearest little Stepan Stepanovitch, I don’t drink\r\n vodka now, and so it can’t be vodka.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: Don’t drink vodka?\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: No, my precious, I don’t drink it any more; so you see you\r\n must be wrong, my little woodchuck.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: But, Ivan Ivanovitch, my dear fellow, don’t try to\r\n stuff my head, as the French say. You must drink vodka, because\r\n there’s a bottle and glass on the table before you. I don’t say you\r\n drink to excess, my dearest little love-bird, but you must drink it\r\n sometimes--or you wouldn’t have it always on the table in front of\r\n you, and so on.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Stepan Stepanovitch, be careful how you contradict me,\r\n because I can’t stand it, my dear little flying-fish, and that’s a\r\n fact. You ought to know better than to come into a brother landowner’s\r\n house and accuse him of drunkenness to his face. It’s mean; it’s\r\n beastly; it’s not worthy of you, my little alligator.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: I didn’t accuse you of anything of the kind. I only\r\n said----\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Well, well, you withdraw. That’s all right. We’ll say no\r\n more about it.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: But excuse me, my dear Ivan Ivanovitch, I don’t withdraw,\r\n because I have said nothing that calls for withdrawal. I didn’t make\r\n any beastly accusation and all that. All I said----\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Oh, little God Almighty, won’t you stop talking! I can’t\r\n stand it, I tell you. My head’s bursting, and I’ve got a terrible pain\r\n in my shoulder blades. And both my ears are burning.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: All I said was that vodka didn’t agree with you, and you\r\n know it doesn’t. Why everyone knows perfectly well that one night, at\r\n Roobikov’s, you----\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Excuse me, Stepan Stepanovitch, but you’d better go. Yes,\r\n you had better go. I might do you a mischief, and so on; and I shall\r\n be sorry afterwards. That night at Roobikov’s, let me tell you, you\r\n were in a disgusting state yourself, and unfit to pass an opinion on\r\n anybody.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: That’s a lie, Ivan Ivanovitch: you were always a liar and\r\n an intriguer. And as for doing me a mischief, come and try, that’s all!\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Oh, little Mothers, help me to be patient. You’re a skunk\r\n and a coward, Stepan Stepanovitch. A skunk. You know you’re safe in\r\n threatening me, because I’m on my last legs with disease, and dying\r\n out, and all that, and so you think you can insult me with impunity.\r\n But when Dmitri Dmitriov thrashed you with a cane----\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: What’s this? What’s this lie about Dmitri Dmitriov. Oh,\r\n Little Uncles and Aunts, this is a bit too much!\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Yes. Dmitri Dmitriov thrashed you, didn’t he? And you ran\r\n squealing about the room, trying to hide under the furniture----\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: Ivan Ivanovitch, how can you tell such falsehoods? I was\r\n wounded at the time and couldn’t put up a fight. But I settled him\r\n afterwards.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Yes. By having him waylaid and thrashed by Yats, the\r\n blacksmith.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: Ivan Ivanovitch, you impugn my honour. You insult me. If\r\n you weren’t an old infirm vodka drunkard I’d smash you into a jelly.\r\n I’d stamp on your face. But please don’t imagine I shall marry your\r\n daughter now. I say, please don’t. That’s finished. You don’t marry\r\n into a family that insults you. No. Never.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV: Now, my dear Stepan Stepanovitch, do be reasonable. Anything\r\n harsh that I may have said you brought on yourself, my darling. You\r\n shouldn’t have begun about the vodka, my dearest little duck-billed\r\n platypus.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: So I’m a coward, am I? Just wait. I’ll get my breath, and\r\n then you’ll see.... I’m sick. I must have a drink. (_Seizes the vodka\r\n bottle._)\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_trying to take it away_): Not that, my dear fellow. Give it\r\n back, I implore you.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: I must have a drink, I tell you... I’m seeing stars ...\r\n bats are flying round my head ... I’m falling--(_drinks from the\r\n bottle_). T’shoo! Pfui!! What disgusting liquor.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_protesting_): It isn’t liquor at all, honoured Stepan\r\n Stepanovitch. It’s poison, my dearest little frog. I told you it\r\n wasn’t vodka, and you wouldn’t believe me.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI (_in wild horror_): Poison. Where’s an emetic?... I can’t\r\n see.... My head’s going to burst.... Now my heart’s come to pieces.\r\n My nose is twitching. Both my eyes are falling out. Ah--h----(_falls\r\n into a chair sobbing hysterically_).\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_yelling_): He’s poisoned. I’m a rat-catcher ... we’re all\r\n murderers.... Little Fathers, have pity! (_Enter_ IRENA IVANOVNA,\r\n _Bougárov’s daughter_.) There. Your husband to be. I’ve murdered him.\r\n Lock me up. Suffocate yourself. Tickle his throat. Give him mustard\r\n and water. A drink. I’m fainting. Quick. (_She gives him the glass\r\n from the desk. He drains it._) Pouagh! Now I’m poisoned too.... My\r\n ears have gone to sleep.... All my teeth are aching. I’m agony all\r\n over (_collapses on the sofa screaming_).\r\n\r\n IRENA IVANOVNA (_wildly_): Vodka--Champagne--Mustard and Water. (_She\r\n plies them with assorted liquors, which they drink gratefully. They\r\n are shaken by internal tempests. They recover slowly._)\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_faintly_): Give thanks to Irena Ivanovna, my dear Stepan\r\n Stepanovitch. Without the presence of mind of your wife-to-be you’d be\r\n a dead man, my little angel-elect.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI (_feebly_): I say no. I’ve told you I won’t marry her.\r\n Impugn my honour and all that. A thousand times no.\r\n\r\n IRENA (_tenderly_): Nobody’s impugned your honour, illustrious Stepan\r\n Stepanovitch. Your mind is affected by the poison, my little darling.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: No. He did (_indicates_ BOUGÁROV). He accuses me of\r\n waylaying Dmitri Dmitriov. Not that he has any right to talk after\r\n what was done to Andrey Andreyvitch.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_as violently as he is able_): Now I give you one chance,\r\n Stepan Stepanovitch. Either stop these insinuations or leave my house.\r\n Yes. I’m sick of you. Yes. I’ve had enough. Enough, I say.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI (_staggering_): I’ll go. Yes. I’d better go. I’m fainting\r\n with pain, and I’ve such a bilious attack I can hardly move without\r\n nausea; but I’d sooner suffer any torments than put up with false\r\n friends.\r\n\r\n IRENA: False friends? Take care what you say, Stepan Stepanovitch.\r\n When you talk about false friends remember how you betrayed Nicolai\r\n Nicolaivitch at Moscow, and so on. Think of the Cheka and all that,\r\n before you talk of disloyalty, my little wood pigeon.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_sneering_): And remember that even if I am a dying man with\r\n heart disease and paralysis, I’ve got people in my house who are good\r\n enough to settle the hash of a lame hen like you, honoured Stepan\r\n Stepanovitch Rumbunkski.\r\n\r\n RUMBUNKSKI: Ah, you threaten, do you? Wait a bit.... Ah, Little\r\n Fathers, this poison. I’m dead again. (_He falls over sideways._)\r\n\r\n IRENA IVANOVNA (_screaming at_ BOUGÁROV): He’s dead. Unnatural father.\r\n Murderer.\r\n\r\n BOUGÁROV (_at the top of his voice_): Don’t yell like that. You\r\n inflict me with the most acute palpitations.... I can’t see.... I’m a\r\n dead man. (_He sinks back in his chair._)\r\n\r\n IRENA IVANOVNA: Little Fathers and Mothers!... I must escape. (_She\r\n drains the vodka bottle and falls prostrate. They all lie motionless.\r\n You think they are dead; but they are not. Just as the light is\r\n failing they come to life one by one and resume their dispute. The\r\n fall of the curtain and the end of the play leave nothing decided._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUMBUNKSKI: Ah!

A vast concourse of people,\r\n Druids and Burghers among them. Flourish of trumpets. Enter_ KING\r\n DAVID, _attended by_ ALFRED, KNIGHT OF SWANSEA, _and_ RIDDELL OF\r\n WALTON HEATH.\r\n\r\n THE KNIGHT OF SWANSEA: Gif me your attentions, I pray you, and mark\r\n vell dese vorts. Ve Velshman haf great traditions. Ve are proud and\r\n ancient peoples. Some tink perhaps ve shows too much ze pride of race,\r\n yes? Ze fierce Celtic patriotism?

Have silence there.\r\n\r\n VOICES FROM THE CROWD: Silence for David.\r\n\r\n OTHER VOICES: Peace for the Man of Wales.\r\n\r\n  RIDDELL (_aside_):\r\n\r\n  Mark, Swansea, how impregnable he looks,\r\n  Like some proud eagle, weary of scouring the skies,\r\n  That pauses on a lofty pinnacle\r\n  Refashioning his pinions, whetting his beak\r\n  Ready to swoop again.\r\n\r\n  KING DAVID:\r\n\r\n                          Good countrymen,\r\n  And ye, my immemorial Cymric Hills,\r\n  I came among ye in my indecision\r\n  To steel myself anew.\r\n                          Good countrymen,\r\n  I have well pondered here in Criccieth\r\n  And now have made resolve, in which I’ll pray\r\n  A moment hence for your support; but first\r\n  ’Tis meet I should explain.\r\n                         Ye well do know\r\n  How lately has arisen from the ranks\r\n  A party sutler, subtle enough it seems,\r\n  Older than I, yet Younger by God’s grace,\r\n  Who seeks to take direction by the throat,\r\n  Sow discord where was harmony before,\r\n  Bring ruin on the Coalition, bind\r\n  Our fortunes, mine and yours, to Torydom,\r\n  Vex all my policies, overthrow my plans,\r\n  And make of our political affairs\r\n  The kind of stew the French call _bouillabaisse_.\r\n\r\n THE CROWD (_murmuring_): We’ll have none of that. None of that. We’ll\r\n rise and storm their strongholds. We’ll burn down their castles to the\r\n ground.\r\n\r\n  KING DAVID:\r\n\r\n  Peace, peace, my friends, and hear me out.\r\n                                   They say\r\n  (Insolent curs), these Younger statesmen say,\r\n  They’d have my leadership because they know,\r\n  Perchance, that I have prowess in the field.\r\n  But in the Council Chamber I’ll be nought,\r\n  A thing, a cipher, ordered here and there....\r\n  What? Shall we now on Unionists depend?\r\n  Sue them for favours, fawn on them for smiles?\r\n  Eat from the dish of infamy the food\r\n  They’d grudge to give had they the giving of it?\r\n  Not in these trousers, sirs!\r\n\r\n  DRUIDS:\r\n\r\n                              Nay, never! Never!\r\n  He’s been despitefully and most vilely used.\r\n\r\n  KING DAVID:\r\n\r\n  Must I go on and watch complacently\r\n  The fairest promise turned to rottenness\r\n  By bigots--dull, reactionary fools?\r\n  Why, I could form a better Government\r\n  (With Riddell’s and my faithful Swansea’s help)\r\n  Of certain Davieses and sundry Jones,\r\n  Llewellyns a few, an Evans here and there,\r\n  A sprinkle of the goodly Williams blood;\r\n  And not a Chamberlain among the lot\r\n  To dull our spirits with his laggard’s breath.\r\n\r\n THE DAVIESES (_talking among themselves_): There’s much in this.\r\n\r\n THE WILLIAMSES: Most true and notable.\r\n\r\n THE EVANSES: Not to be lightly put aside, look you.\r\n\r\n A DRUID: Peace, he begins again.\r\n\r\n  KING DAVID:\r\n\r\n                              My noble friends,\r\n  This, then, the resolution I have formed.\r\n  I’ll back to Westminster and beard them there\r\n  And put this Younger’s power to the test.\r\n  If, as I think, he fall before my lance,\r\n  Why, we’ll admit them to some sort of quarter;\r\n  But if, as may be, they resist my terms,\r\n  Then to the hustings with our banners high,\r\n  Our hopes and hearts and courage higher still;\r\n  And I, and doughty Riddell, and wise Mond,\r\n  Fisher and Greenwood, Churchill and Monro,\r\n  And all these gallant gentlemen of ours,\r\n  Will armour up and lead our forces out\r\n  ’Gainst Bonar and his liver-hearted crew\r\n  Of purse-proud commoners and needy peers,\r\n  And bear them down and roll them in the dust.\r\n  Heads shall fall right and left, Curzon’s and Chamberlain’s,\r\n  Amery’s, Baldwin’s. We’ll have Ormsby’s gore,\r\n  Young F.

Away. We’ll to the fray, amain;\r\n        And see Welsh David cleanse the land again.\r\n\r\n  (_Sound a flourish._ EXEUNT.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD\r\n\r\n(_A Play in the Irish Manner._)\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE I.--_A hovel by the sea at Ballycottin, near Queenstown. Eamon,\r\n in squalid garments and in an appropriate attitude of misery, is\r\n crouched over the fire. Seamus Smitha is distilling poteen by the\r\n door. Peadar Roabensôn and the Men of Gunn (a war-like clan) are\r\n lurking in the background. Caitilin ni Houlihan, Bridgeen Dick, and\r\n the Widow Markiewicz are watching Eamon with speechless devotion. The\r\n door is flung open and Sean de Browna bursts in._\r\n\r\n SEAN: Where’s himself?\r\n\r\n SEAMUS: Taking a bit of sleep, maybe, if he’s able--God help him!\r\n\r\n SEAN (_exultantly_): There’s fine doings on the sands this night, with\r\n great ships boarded and sunk and the lads making grand talk. Rifles\r\n and cannon we’ve taken, and munitions would be enough for a great war.\r\n\r\n THE MEN OF GUNN (_murmuring appreciatively_): Bully for you, Kid!\r\n\r\n PEADAR: It’s himself will bless these tidings. (_Addressing Eamon with\r\n conspicuous timidity_): Mister, honey, he’s after saying they’ve sunk\r\n the British Navy, and captured all the munitions in the western world.\r\n\r\n EAMON: The blessing of Gunn upon those words! (_Dropping his voice_):\r\n I say, what d’you imagine they’ve really got?\r\n\r\n PEADAR (_dropping his_): Oh, I don’t know--a few dozen rifles, I\r\n suppose, and a couple of boxes of S.A.A. One has to exaggerate a bit\r\n in an Irish drama.\r\n\r\n (_Enter Boûgus, claimant to the throne of Ulster, followed by Naisi\r\n and Narsti, the sons of Gunn._)\r\n\r\n BOÛGUS (_in bloodthirsty tones_): It’s taking the arms up to the caves\r\n they are, till all’s ready to strike the blow; and it’s fine gory\r\n heads there’ll be, and great masses of dead bodies that day in the six\r\n counties, and throughout the land, so you’ll not avoid to tread on\r\n the white upturned faces of the dead, they lying so thick. And I’ll\r\n be king that day in Ulster, and the black Orangemen destroyed and\r\n vanquished.\r\n\r\n THE MEN OF GUNN (_with appreciation_): Sa-ay, kid, that’s talking.\r\n\r\n EAMON: Let you go down now, Boûgus, with Naisi and Narsti and the men\r\n of Gunn; for I’ve word that Cosgrave, or perhaps Mulcahy, do be coming\r\n to Castlebar or maybe Dundalk, and it’s there he must be sent away\r\n with scorn and laughter, and maybe a leaden bullet or two.\r\n\r\n THE MEN OF GUNN (_springing to their feet_): Easy money. Get right\r\n after it, boys.\r\n\r\n BOÛGUS (_bursting into song_): Oh, Alannah, Acushla, Asthore, Macree,\r\n Honomandhiaul!!! (_He dashes out at the head of the party. Eamon wraps\r\n himself complacently in his rags and nods over the fire. The women\r\n continue to regard him with speechless devotion._)\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE II.--_A hovel by the sea at Ballyruff. The roar of breakers\r\n almost drowns the voices of the speakers. Enter Seamus Smitha and\r\n Peadar hurriedly_.\r\n\r\n SEAMUS: Where’s himself?\r\n\r\n SEAN: Asleep, God help him, and dreaming of Caitilin ni Houlihan, the\r\n creature, and her wedded to him in these coming days.\r\n\r\n PEADAR (_roughly_): It’s her he can put from his mind then, for she’s\r\n up there on the hillside with Cosgrave and Mulcahy, and James Craig,\r\n and they going on together with dancing and merriment, the way would\r\n surprise the stags for leppin’; and her that let on to be a decent\r\n woman would marry a holy man.\r\n\r\n BRIDGEEN DICK (_sharply_): Let yourself be holding your tongue now,\r\n Peadar Roabensôn, with your great noises to waken the seven sleepers,\r\n and he not stretched in his bed a dozen hours to be resting after his\r\n great labours.\r\n\r\n BOÛGUS (_rushing in, followed by Naisi and Narsti_): It’s destroyed we\r\n are, entirely.\r\n\r\n EAMON (_sitting up suddenly_): I beg your pardon? Did you say\r\n destroyed?\r\n\r\n BOÛGUS: Aye, destroyed.... She’s turned against us, and joined the\r\n hands of Cosgrave and James in friendship--as Deirdre, in the days of\r\n old, did try with Conchubor and the sons of Usna.\r\n\r\n EAMON (_in an undertone, to one of his personal retinue_): My God,\r\n what are we to do now?\r\n\r\n THE OTHER (_whispering_): You must make a speech in Gaelic.\r\n\r\n EAMON (_also whispering_): I can’t. I’ve left the book at the Mansion\r\n House.\r\n\r\n THE OTHER: Well, you must think of something appropriate in English,\r\n then.\r\n\r\n BOÛGUS (_keening_): Oh, whirra, whirra, Ochone, Ochone. (_They all\r\n burst into tears._)\r\n\r\n EAMON (_as one pronouncing a curse_): If the sun could have darkened\r\n to hide her shame, and the waters of the great ocean given themselves\r\n to wash away her faithlessness, it’s a strange, black, arid world we’d\r\n be living in this day. O’Connell, Parnell, Redmond, she’s broken the\r\n heart in all of them; and now it’s mine she’s broken, too; and it’s\r\n not Cosgrave and James that she’ll spare in the days to come.--I will\r\n go out with the Men of Gunn....\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE III.--_A hovel by the sea among the Balmy Stones of\r\n Claptrapatrick, near Ballyidiocee. Enter_ SEAMUS _as usual_.\r\n\r\n SEAMUS: Where’s himself?\r\n\r\n SEAN: Musha avick, how many more times will I be telling you in this\r\n play that he’s asleep, God help him, the holy man, and maybe dreaming,\r\n if he’s able, of the grand goings on there’ll be when they’re after\r\n making him Pope and King of all the world, and he a scraggy, thin,\r\n weakly man would put you in mind of an old hen, or maybe a worn-out\r\n jackass to be taken from the shafts and turned away among the roots\r\n and grasses to die.\r\n\r\n PEADAR: Sure, I’m thinking that’s not what he’d be dreaming at all,\r\n but the great joy of making combats and running here and there in high\r\n spirits, with the Men of Gunn around him.\r\n\r\n EAMON (_mournfully_): The heart’s broke in me, Seamus Smitha, for\r\n it’s all put aside and finished now, and there’s no more doings I can\r\n contrive; and there’s nothing left but to go back, the way we came,\r\n among the Bohunks and Dagoes, and die in a little dirty state in the\r\n hind end of America.\r\n\r\n THE WIDOW MARKIEWICZ (_scornfully_): And isn’t there land called\r\n England over across a dirty bit of water would hardly wet your boots\r\n to cross it; where do be fine houses, and gold ornaments, and a\r\n stupid uncomplaining people to govern, and a crazy Parliament over it\r\n all is calling for ever on the Mother of God to send an alternative\r\n Government?\r\n\r\n THE MEN OF GUNN: Gee whiz!!\r\n\r\n THE WIDOW: How do you say, Eamon! Will you take this country and\r\n people and make a new Ireland there; and be leaving the North and the\r\n South to slit the throats on each other?\r\n\r\n EAMON (_in a great voice_): I’ll do it, so.... And won’t it be the\r\n fine adventure to hold it over the heads of Cosgrave and Mulcahy, when\r\n I’m sitting in the seat of Lloyd George with the Kings and Emperors\r\n and Presidents of the world around under my feet, and Boûgus beside\r\n me, and Naisi and Narsti on my either hand, and the Men of Gunn\r\n holding the fair land of England, and me Lord of it all?\r\n\r\n BRIDGEEN: And haven’t you the right, Mister honey, to be sitting in\r\n that place and taking your ease, and a sup of whiskey itself maybe;\r\n for it’s you surely is destroyed by thinking and fighting in these\r\n days in Ireland, and where would there be your match for craft and\r\n savagery in all the western islands?\r\n\r\n EAMON: I have so. (_To Naisi and Narsti_): Call up the Men of Gunn,\r\n and let Boûgus be there, and Seamus, and Sean, and Peadar Roabensôn,\r\n and any other man would make his future, so; and I’ll lead them out to\r\n England, or Russia itself if need be, and split the brainpan on Lloyd\r\n George and all of them, and be master of the world in their places;\r\n and so I will. (_They go out._)\r\n\r\n THE WIDOW MARKIEWICZ (_looking after them as they go_): And isn’t he\r\n the fine handsome lad to be riding forth on a great adventure; and he,\r\n God help him, nothing but a poor crazy scholar, with a great savagery\r\n and bitterness in his heart?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA man, or woman, who has just been elected to Parliament may be\r\npardoned if, in the words of Gilbert, “the compliment implied,\r\ninflates” him (or her) “with legitimate pride.” It is rather difficult,\r\nwhen the declaration of the poll is announced by the Returning Officer,\r\nand you find yourself, by a swinging (or narrow) majority, the elected\r\nrepresentative of some 30,000 people, to avoid a certain feeling of\r\npleasurable self-congratulation. For the first time in your life you\r\nare, suddenly, the central figure of a great demonstration. You are\r\nastonished at your own popularity. Strangers rush up and clasp you\r\nby the hand; bearded men kiss you on both cheeks; you are taken in\r\ncharge by the police, to save you from being torn limb from limb by\r\nyour almost too enthusiastic friends. And, if there is a fleeting\r\nresemblance, in the triumphal march from the returning office to the\r\nheadquarters of your organisation, to the old-time procession to the\r\nscaffold of a popular highwayman--a resemblance heightened by the\r\nnecessity for making a speech on a crazy wooden erection usually known\r\nas “the hustings,” that air of spurious importance is, for the most\r\npart, effaced next day, when you leave your constituency by train,\r\nunrecognised and even unremarked. After the splendours of the previous\r\nnight, this anonymity is an almost painful contrast; but there are\r\nlower depths of abasement to be reached. You have yet to pay your first\r\nvisit to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between your election and the summoning of Parliament,\r\nyou have probably to some extent recovered your normal self-confidence.\r\nYou have doubtless secured a home near Westminster, “to be near the\r\nHouse, you know.” You may even have been interviewed by a provincial\r\npaper. It is just possible that one of the leaders of your party--a\r\njunior one--in the first generous glow of the election results, may\r\nhave shaken you by the hand. Perhaps (but this happens very rarely)\r\nthe august personage who speaks from the Front Bench in the name of\r\nyour party, may have stared you out of countenance at Lady Broadside’s\r\nreception. You are actually beginning to feel that you are Somebody\r\nafter all; and so you nerve yourself to make your first visit to the\r\nscene of your future labours.\r\n\r\nSomehow, as you slink into Old Palace Yard, the fine fervour of\r\nenthusiasm, that accompanied you in your walk along Victoria Street,\r\nseems to have largely abated. You cannot help secretly wondering\r\nwhether you will be required to produce credentials by the doorkeeper.\r\nYou visualise a painful moment, when a gigantic functionary will say\r\npolitely, but oh so firmly, in response to your frantic asseverations,\r\n“Very sorry, sir, but if you can’t prove you’re a member, I can’t let\r\nyou in.” You wonder whether he will accept the evidence of the birth\r\ncertificate, and the cutting from the “Times” announcing your victory,\r\nwhich you hastily stuffed into your pocket before starting out; or\r\nwhether you had better lie in wait for some senior member of your\r\nparty, and steal in, in his wake. And, whilst these fearful doubts are\r\ninvading your mind, you find yourself at the entrance, and an enormous,\r\ngenial, rubicund policeman accosts you smilingly: “Good morning, Sir!\r\nNew member, Sir?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “New Member, Sir?”]\r\n\r\nDown, swelling heart!\r\n\r\nYou try to avoid bursting with pride; acknowledge his salute; and walk\r\nin. But ah, you think, the terrors are yet to come. Another constable\r\nequally large, equally genial, touches his hat as you pass through\r\nthe swing doors, and says: “Cloakroom on the right, sir.” “Here at\r\nleast,” you fear, “there will be a challenge.” An attendant comes up to\r\nyou. He gives you a searching look. Your heart sinks into your boots.\r\n“Good Heavens,” you think to yourself, “I am in the wrong part of the\r\nbuilding--this is probably reserved for Cabinet Ministers.” You are\r\nabout to mutter an excuse and slink away. Quite unnecessary. He was\r\nonly memorising your face. “Name, sir?” he asks. You give it; you\r\nwill never have to do so again. Like your face and appearance, it has\r\nbeen indelibly recorded for future reference. “Your peg’s here, sir,”\r\nhe says; and you find, rather to your astonishment, that a peg has\r\nalready been reserved for you, and bears your name. Two or three other\r\nmembers come in--old members evidently, for he knows them personally.\r\nThey exchange greetings; and you think to yourself: now where have I\r\nseen something like this before?--Your mind, in a flash, bridges a\r\ngulf of a quarter of a century, and takes you back to your first day\r\nat your public school.... “New boy, sir?” said the janitor, committing\r\nyour face and name to memory. “Mr. ----’s house, sir? That’s your peg\r\nin that corner; them’s the school notices under that shed, see? You\r\nought to read them every day; and that’s the tuckshop the other side\r\nof the road opposite the gates.” ... “New member, sir?” enquires the\r\nattendant. “There’s your peg, sir; you’ll find the Post Office at the\r\ntop of the stairs on the left of the Lobby; you ought to ask there for\r\nthe letters. Smoking-room, sir? Along the corridor, turn to the right;\r\nand it’s on your left-hand side.”\r\n\r\nTruly the boy is father to the man.\r\n\r\nYou leave your coat, and wander up the stairs to the inner Lobby. You\r\nsample the thrill of receiving your first batch of letters in the House\r\nof Commons. You peep reverentially into the empty Chamber--half afraid\r\nto go inside for fear of inadvertently transgressing some rule of the\r\nHouse. You would like to look at the Library and the smoking-room; and\r\nyet you feel a certain unwillingness to trouble the attendants with\r\nquestions. Suddenly a stranger, noticing your irresolution, saunters up\r\nto you. “New member?” he asks affably (as who should say “New boy?”);\r\nand when you have admitted the soft impeachment--“Thought so,” he\r\ncontinues, “I think I knew most of the last Parliament. Care to look\r\nround? I’ve nothing to do for an hour.”\r\n\r\nAnd, even as you accept, you remember how Williams (or Brown), who\r\nafterwards grew to be your _alter ego_, took pity on you in the old\r\ndays at Greyfriars, led you round and “put you wise”; and, whilst your\r\nnew friend is explaining the mysteries of the Chamber--the Chair, the\r\nCross Benches, the Bar, the Galleries--leading you through the Library,\r\nalong the passages to the House of Lords, and making you acquainted\r\nwith your new public school, you think with gratitude, and some wonder,\r\nof the eternal youth of human institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOES OF THE WHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chief Whip of a Party is a very august personage. He shares in the\r\ncouncils of the Party leaders. He is one of the links that bind them\r\nto the Headquarters organisation, and the constituencies. He holds\r\nthe party together on the lines laid down by the Leader. He keeps a\r\nwatchful eye upon recalcitrants, like a sheep-dog with wayward sheep.\r\nHe is, in fact, the Chief of Staff; and his lot is not an unenviable\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe Junior Whips are another matter. Rebellious members of the party\r\nwho would, however, feel some compunction about speaking their minds\r\nto the Chief Whip, lay bare their grievances, with embarrassing\r\nplain-spokenness, to the juniors. The Scottish and Welsh Whips\r\nmust often find themselves like to the unfortunate victims of that\r\nmythological giant, whose habit it was to tie the legs of his foes to\r\nopposing fir-trees, and, releasing the trees, divide them in twain--by\r\nreason of the rival claims of their own particular groups of members\r\nand of the Chief Whip himself. Needless to say, in all parties, there\r\nis the fullest opportunity for members to bring their point of view\r\nto the notice of the leaders, both through the Whips and at party\r\nmeetings. But once a party decision has been taken, it is obvious that,\r\nfor the sake of the unity of the party, it is highly important that\r\nits members should present a consolidated front. And it is when the\r\npreconceived opinions of individual members, or special circumstances\r\nin their constituencies, happen to be at variance with the general\r\npolicy of the party, that the troubles of the Junior Whips begin.\r\nThey have obviously an inclination towards those who compose their\r\nown group, such as the Welsh members or Scottish members; they have\r\nalso their duty towards the party as a whole--not always easily to\r\nbe reconciled. Anyone who experienced the unenviable position of a\r\nJunior Staff Officer in one of the feuds that habitually raged between\r\nbattalion and brigade, or between brigade and division, during the war,\r\nwill have a fairly accurate understanding of the trials of a Junior\r\nWhip.\r\n\r\nBut that is not all. The Whips are responsible for the social side\r\nof the party as well. Sir Augustus and Lady Broadside, let us say,\r\noffer to arrange a reception. For some reason, limitation of space\r\nfor instance, it is not possible to invite everybody. On the Whips\r\nfalls the invidious duty of making the selection, who shall be asked\r\nand who not. And when this difficult task has been performed, it is\r\ndiscovered that, by an oversight, there is no record of the fact that\r\nsome new member is married--consequently he is asked and his wife is\r\nnot, with inevitable heartburnings as the result. Or, again, there\r\nare ceremonial duties to be attended to. Members wishing to attend\r\nthe King’s Levee must have their paths made smooth. The presentation\r\nat Court of the wives and daughters of members must be arranged. The\r\nWhips must expect to be consulted, as well, on sumptuary questions,\r\nsuch, for instance, as whether a member ought to buy a levee dress, or\r\nwhether it will be considered sufficient if he avails himself of the\r\nnew regulation, and attends in evening coat and knee breeches; and what\r\nis the most appropriate garment, other than a white sheet, in which to\r\nmake a maiden speech.\r\n\r\nAs if that was not enough, there are the speaking arrangements to be\r\nmade. It does not, of course, follow that the list will be adhered\r\nto, but, for the convenience of the Speaker, it is usual for him to\r\nbe furnished “through the usual channels,” which means in other words\r\nby the Whips, with a list of members of each party who would like to\r\nspeak in any Debate. Obviously some selection must be made, or in a\r\nParliament of active politicians, such as the present, the list of each\r\nparty would be impossibly large. More than half a dozen names for each\r\nparty would be more of a hindrance to the Speaker than a help, because\r\nthere would be no possibility of getting them all in--seeing that the\r\nnormal hours of Debate are between four in the afternoon and eleven\r\nat night--seven hours in all--and the average duration of speeches is\r\ntwenty minutes, giving a maximum of twenty-one speakers. This process\r\nof selection calls for tact of the highest order. On the one hand, if\r\nthe list is too full, the Whip must not put off further volunteers\r\nin such a manner as to discourage them. On the other hand, he must\r\nbe careful not to create the impression that he wants them to speak\r\nalways, or they will never leave him in peace. Even the most sensible\r\nand level-headed people are touchy about their speaking; and the effect\r\nof a hasty word may easily take a whole session to efface from the mind\r\nof the person to whom it was addressed.\r\n\r\nNor do the Whip’s duties end there. A question suddenly arises needing\r\ninstant determination. On the one hand, the leader may make up his mind\r\nat once as to the party attitude; in that case the Whips must hurry\r\nround, and communicate it to the members of the party. On the other\r\nhand, the leader may wish to know the feelings of his party before\r\ndeciding on a course of action; there is no opportunity for holding a\r\nparty meeting, the decision must be taken probably within half an hour;\r\nit now becomes the duty of the Whips to flit from member to member,\r\ncollecting opinions and suggestions for communication to the Leader by\r\nthe “Chief.” Or it may be necessary to “keep a house” for one of the\r\nback-benchers who is “raising a question on the adjournment”; again the\r\nbusy Whips must hurry here and there lobbying their party to make sure\r\nthat forty members will be present, to protect their colleague against\r\nthe misfortune of being “counted out.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, on top of all this, there is liaison with the other parties,\r\nwhich in practice is more or less reserved for the Chief Whip\r\nhimself--for this kind of work demands the delicacy of Agag. These are\r\nthe accommodations, arrangements of business, exchange of party views,\r\nthat necessarily go on behind the scenes as a preliminary to the set\r\nDebates--especially in connection with the procedure of the House and\r\nthe settlement of the order of public business.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain glamour in being styled a Whip. Your name and,\r\nprobably, your photograph are published in the papers; you are given\r\nspecial facilities for entertaining your fellow-members; if your party\r\nhappens to be in power, you hold a junior office in the Treasury.\r\nThe Chief Whip, despite his responsibilities, has, on the whole, an\r\ninteresting job. He is largely concerned with what is sometimes called\r\nthe kitchen side of politics; but his function of linking up the\r\nParliamentary party with the leader, calls for high qualities; and his\r\nweight, in the determination of the party programme in the conclave of\r\nleaders, is considerable. The Junior Whips are devotees of a high order\r\nto their party’s organisation. Their task is a thankless one. They\r\ncondemn themselves to well-nigh Trappist vows in the Chamber, because\r\nthey are almost always at work outside it. They place themselves\r\nat everyone’s beck and call. They are in demand to smooth out any\r\ndifficulty that may arise.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as a man once said, who was A.D.C. to a Colonial Governor:\r\n“It’s a spittoon of a life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MEN AND “MAIDENS”\r\n\r\n\r\nDefer it as you may, upon one pretext or another, the fatal moment will\r\ncome at last when you must make your maiden speech. There have, it is\r\nto be supposed, been members of Parliament of such agonising modesty\r\nor such iron self-restraint, that they would have been willing to pass\r\ntheir entire Parliamentary lives in silence. But sooner or later, and\r\nprobably sooner than later, an aggregation of pressures--duty to the\r\nconstituency, the spur of _amour propre_, green jealousy of the triumph\r\nof X., who so impressed the House by his speech on the Protection of\r\nInsects Bill, the subtle encouragement of some fair flatterer who, when\r\nX.’s speech was discussed, eyed you archly and murmured, “Of course\r\n_you_ ...” leaving your vanity to fill in the blanks--these, and other\r\ncompelling reasons, combine to persuade you to the irrevocable step of\r\ngiving in your name to the Whips, after which, feeling like a man who\r\nhas made an appointment with his dentist, you slink away and prepare\r\nfor the worst.\r\n\r\nWith becoming modesty, you select some insignificant, and relatively\r\ntrivial, subject--such as World Federation, the Solar system, or the\r\nrelations of the Almighty and the Universe, as affording you scope\r\nfor the pronouncement you feel it in you to make. You collect a whole\r\npantechnicon-load of authorities, which, when you have read them\r\nthrough, are allowed to lie piled in the darkest passages of your house\r\nfor the servants to fall over; you take a ticket for the British Museum\r\nLibrary; you apply yourself to study with all the fervour of a Bengalee\r\ncompeting for an examination. And then, one or at the most two days\r\nbefore the great oration is scheduled to be delivered, your Whip says\r\ncasually, “Oh, we’ve had to change the arrangements. We’re getting\r\nyou in on the Committee stage of the Impurities in Milk (Abolition)\r\nBill”; and all your labour is shown to be wasted and vain. There are\r\nonly three days left. You rush to the Dairy Produce Association,\r\nthe Institute of Milkmaids, and the Society for the Preservation of\r\nCattle and Kine, from each of which you receive an undigested mass of\r\npropaganda, disguised in the form of scientific tracts. There is no\r\ntime to push your investigations beyond these, so you set yourself to\r\nlearn them word by word. You come down to the House on the fatal day\r\nprimed with knowledge, with lactialities on your lips and the milk of\r\nhuman kindness bubbling from your heart--and you discover that, before\r\nyour arrival, a member of your own party, interested in the welfare\r\nof subject populations of the Empire, has moved the Adjournment of\r\nthe House to draw attention to a matter of urgent and definite public\r\nimportance, namely, the refusal of the Government to issue practising\r\nlicences and a charter of incorporation to the witch-doctors in the\r\nU-Ba-Be district of Abeokeuta.\r\n\r\nYou seek out your Whip, demanding information. He tells you that the\r\nGovernment has changed its mind about the Bill on which you were to\r\nspeak, and intends, in its place, to introduce an Amending Act in\r\nconnection with the Acquisition of Mineral Royalties in Zanzibar,\r\nProclamation of 1872. Having no knowledge whatever of Zanzibar or\r\nminerals, other than those in bottles, and only a nodding acquaintance\r\nwith the lesser grades of royalty, you feel bound to demur, when he\r\nsuggests that you should “give tongue” at such short notice on this\r\nsubject. Whereupon he offers you your choice between the Protection of\r\nHerrings (Scotland) Bill, Second Reading; the Civil Service and Revenue\r\nDepartments (grants in respect of medical referees, destitute aliens,\r\nand port and riparian sanitary authorities) Vote on Account; and the\r\nArmy and Air Force Annual Bill. Smitten with despair at the prospect\r\nof the vigils, prayer and fasting entailed in the mastery of any one\r\nof these three subjects, and fortified by a hazy recollection of “King\r\nSolomon’s Mines,” you quaveringly ask whether it would not be possible\r\nfor you to speak on the Witch Doctors Adjournment. As your Whip has\r\nbeen searching high and low for someone to do this very thing, he\r\nalmost invites you to dinner in his relief; and hurries away with your\r\nname to the Speaker. In due course he seeks you out in the Library,\r\nwhere you are sitting, in a cold perspiration at your own temerity,\r\nand struggling to master a report on “Witchcraft and the Black Arts as\r\npractised in the Continent of Africa,” furnished through the medium\r\nof the Aborigines Suppression Society in 1850--apparently the only\r\nstandard work on the subject. He informs you that you will be called\r\nimmediately after the Government has replied. Your heart sinks into\r\nyour boots; a clammy sweat breaks out upon your forehead; and you apply\r\nyourself assiduously to the report.\r\n\r\nJust before 8.15 p.m. you stagger into the Chamber. To your excited\r\nfancy it seems to have grown very large. The seat on which you are\r\naccustomed to sit, seems an immense distance from the Speaker’s Chair.\r\nBut, as the House is practically empty, you sneak into somebody’s\r\ncorner seat, and hope for the best. The one encouraging factor in the\r\nwhole proceedings is that, in spite of the ghastly hash that the mover\r\nof the resolution seems to be making, the patient House is attentively\r\nlistening in silence. After all, you think, remembering your own\r\ntriumphant speeches during the election, the swing of the words, the\r\nthrill of the audience, the storm of applause--after all, it can’t be\r\nas difficult as all that.... An Under-Secretary begins a half-hearted\r\ndefence of the Government. He says he is quite certain that in this\r\ncase the House will consider that the House ought to be extremely\r\ncareful before responding to the suggestion made by his hon. and\r\ngallant friend that the House is at liberty to vary a former decision\r\nof that House, as hon. members below the gangway seem to imagine.\r\nHe goes on to say, er--that the Government--er--will, of course, be\r\nruled--er--or perhaps he ought to say guided--er--by the view of the\r\nHouse towards--er--or with regard to the matter--assuming that in that\r\nmatter or--er--as he would rather put it, in such questions--er--the\r\nopinion of the House must be the governing consideration. Furthermore,\r\nhe would remind the House, with the permission of the House, that the\r\nHouse is always reluctant to set aside a privilege won by the House in\r\nformer times and upheld on the floor of the House by statesmen like\r\nDrigg and Bulgman with the full approval of the House--an approval, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, which, as the House is aware, is recorded in the journals of\r\nthe House, and which he is satisfied--nay, assured--that all members\r\nof the House would pause before challenging.\r\n\r\nWith this adjuration he resumes his place. You climb tremulously to\r\nyour feet. The Speaker calls: “Mr. Wutherspoon.” And immediately\r\nmost of the people in the Chamber rise, and hurry out, with looks of\r\ndisgust and loathing. The bustle of their exit rather takes away from\r\nthe effect of your carefully prepared opening sentences; and your\r\nbiting gibe at the expense of the Minister seems in some mysterious\r\nway to have lost the greater part of its sting. Those to whom it\r\nis audible ejaculate a mirthless “Ha, ha,” to encourage a maiden\r\nspeaker, and vanish in the wake of those members who have already\r\nleft. You wonder to yourself, in dismay, whatever induced you to\r\nembark upon a Parliamentary career; and at the same moment, stumbling,\r\nquite by accident, upon some happy phrase, you are greeted, to your\r\nastonishment, with modified cheering. This is what you were waiting\r\nfor. You feel that Parliament is not so insensible to your merits, as\r\nyou had at first supposed. You seize the lapel of your coat with your\r\nleft hand, and, throwing out your right in a generous half-circle, you\r\nventure boldly upon the great passage in your speech, beginning, “The\r\nwitch-doctors of U-Ba-Be, a humble section of our fellow-subjects,\r\norganised, as who shall say they have no right to be organised, in a\r\nsociety, union or corporation, turn their eyes and lift up their voices\r\nto this House of Commons imploring....” Somehow, by the malignant\r\nintervention of unhappy chance, before you have said half a dozen\r\nwords of this moving passage, a deathly silence has fallen upon the\r\nChamber; all eyes are fixed upon you; you stumble and falter; and\r\nmurmured conversation at once begins. Again you blunder on a telling\r\nphrase. Once more you find you are being listened to. This is a pity,\r\nbecause it betrays you into a touch of self-confidence. Immediately,\r\nall around you, faces, like flowers in the morning sun, expand into\r\nsmiling bloom. But you are getting into your stride: you correct that\r\nmistake with a modest remark and a deprecating movement of the hand.\r\nWhereupon, you are cheered. You turn with graceful assurance towards\r\nthe Chair. “Why, Mr. Speaker, the witch-doctors of U-Ba-Be,” you begin;\r\nand you find that the Speaker, who has a legion of duties beyond\r\nlistening to the speeches, is in earnest conversation over the arm of\r\nthe Chair with one of the Whips, or perhaps is writing, or--and this is\r\nso disconcerting as almost to petrify one with astonishment--he has\r\nvacated the Chair to the Deputy-Speaker, who wearing neither wig nor\r\ngown, is well-nigh invisible under the mighty canopy. In the dismay of\r\nthis paralysing discovery, your legs endeavour to collapse under you.\r\nYou nerve yourself for a prodigious effort, jettison the witch-doctors\r\ninto space, and endeavour to sweep into the peroration, so carefully\r\nprepared on the subject of World Peace, adapted later to the Milk Bill,\r\nand now, with suitable alterations, doing service on behalf of the\r\nsubject populations of the Empire. You get along very nicely for about\r\ntwo minutes; you feel that you are taking the House into your arms;\r\nyou carefully avoid a second glance at the Chair, and look along the\r\nbenches, warming to your work. Alas! at that moment somebody laughs.\r\nIn all human probability his laughter had nothing to do with anything\r\nyou said. In a feverish effort to recall your words, for purposes of\r\ncorrection, you lose the sequence of ideas, and the peroration follows\r\nthe witch-doctors into the limbo of forgotten things. You lamely thank\r\nthe House for its indulgence; and sit down covered with ignominy and\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nThen, to your astonishment, other members turn round, and nod to\r\nyou--nods of approval. Somebody says “Well done.” Somebody else leans\r\nforward, and pats you on the back. One of the leaders on the Front\r\nBench actually turns round and looks at you. The Whip who arranged for\r\nyour call offers words of congratulation.\r\n\r\nYou congratulate yourself--on having got it over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONT BENCHES AND BACK BENCHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Front Bench, which faces the Treasury Box, and is located on the\r\nright of the Speaker’s Chair, is reserved for Ministers of the Crown.\r\nThe Front Opposition Bench, which is on the left of the Speaker’s\r\nChair and faces a similar box, is reserved for ex-Ministers and\r\nPrivy Councillors in opposition. What secrets of State these massive\r\nbrass-bound boxes contain, must be a source of anxious wonder to\r\neveryone who attends a Debate and looks down upon them from one of the\r\nGalleries. They look as though they are the very Holy of Holies of the\r\nConstitution, the arcana in which repose the mystic foundations of our\r\ngreatness. You feel that, at least, they ought to contain Doomsday\r\nBook, the original manuscript of Magna Carta, and the Declaration of\r\nRights. So massive and monumental is their appearance, so hallowed\r\ntheir associations, that you would not be surprised to discover that\r\nthe special form of oath in the House of Commons was to swear “By the\r\nTreasury Box!” as kings of old did swear _par le splendeur Dex_.\r\n\r\nLovers of Stevenson will recall how, during his stay on the Island of\r\nApemama, having been afflicted by influenza, and when all Western\r\nmedicines had failed, he put himself in the hands of Tembinok’s Chief\r\nMagician, who, by invoking the deity Chench, effected a miraculous\r\ncure--so shaking the scepticism of Stevenson that he pursued\r\ninvestigations with the magician, which culminated in the discovery\r\nthat Chench occupied a small wooden box in the Warlock’s house.\r\nInsatiable in his desire to extend his theological knowledge, he\r\nsucceeded, after protracted bargaining, in acquiring the tenement of\r\nthe god, bore it home in triumph, found himself, like one of his own\r\ncharacters in the story of the Bottle Imp, unable to resist the pangs\r\nof curiosity, and, with who can guess what delicious anticipations of\r\nthe unknown, removed the lid--only to discover three cowrie shells\r\nand a little piece of matting. Such are the disappointments of the\r\nseeker after truth who should bring himself to open the Treasury boxes,\r\nfor one is empty and the other contains a cheaply bound and quite\r\nunremarkable copy of the Bible and a couple of pieces of cardboard\r\nbearing a certain family resemblance to that part of the paraphernalia\r\nof the optician that he hangs on the wall to test your sight by--which\r\nare, in fact, copies in large letters of the oath, the Scotch oath and\r\nthe Affirmation, required by law to be taken on signing the roll of\r\nParliament, and embodied in this form for the convenience of the Clerk\r\nwho administers them.\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression from the Front and Back Benches. The two\r\nmembers for the City of London, by some curious old survival, are\r\nentitled to sit on the Front Bench of their party; but in practice,\r\nsince both Front Benches are notoriously insufficient to accommodate\r\nall claimants to seats, this traditional right of the City members\r\nis only exercised on the first day of a new Session, as who should\r\nput a barrier once a year across a private road, to prevent the right\r\nfrom lapsing. Nowadays with three large parties in the House, the\r\nthird headed by two ex-Prime Ministers and a number of distinguished\r\nex-Ministers and Privy Councillors, the front bench below the gangway,\r\non the right of the Speaker’s Chair, has, by the Speaker’s ruling,\r\nbecome a Front Bench. Its opposite number on the left of the Chair\r\nhas no special status. By virtue of their office, the Whips sit on\r\nthe front benches of their respective parties. All the remainder of\r\nthe House constitutes the back benches, with the exception of the\r\nCross-benches--which, however, though actually within the Chamber, are,\r\nby a fiction, outside the House, being behind the Bar. It follows that\r\na member may not address the House from the Cross-benches; but since,\r\nby way of compensation, the Members’ Galleries on either side of the\r\nHouse, though outside the Chamber, are, in fact, by a similar fiction,\r\ninside the House, a member may, and in Mr. Pemberton Billing’s time\r\ndid, address the House from these lofty altitudes above it (if he is\r\nso fortunate as to catch the Speaker’s eye), giving himself, in the\r\nexercise of this privilege, the appearance of a contemplative passenger\r\nleaning over the side of a ship.\r\n\r\nSo much for the physical difference between the Front and Back Benches.\r\nWhat of the Front and Back Benchers? The Front Bencher is the finished\r\nproduct of the Parliamentary machine. He is, to the humble majority of\r\nhis fellows, what the members of those august and mystic societies,\r\nlike “Pop” at Eton, are reputed to be, to their less distinguished\r\nbrethren. A Front Bencher is, by tradition of the House, entitled to\r\ncatch the Speaker’s eye in preference to any Back Bencher. He need not\r\nattend prayers: indeed, if he values the privileges of his order, he\r\nwill be careful never to attend prayers, but will saunter in to take\r\nhis place whilst the Speaker’s Chaplain is bowing his way backwards\r\ndown the floor of the House. He has the privilege of putting his feet\r\non the Table, a practice which he not infrequently carries into his\r\nown home--to the mingled pride of his family and astonishment of his\r\nfriends. But if the position has these privileges to give, it has also\r\nits responsibilities. Front Benchers must behave with decorum, and\r\nthat is more than is expected of anyone else. They are the Sixth Form\r\nboys, and must set an example.\r\n\r\nThe successful Back Bencher should approach his work in the spirit\r\nof the Lower Third. Whilst he should not actually permit himself the\r\nrelaxation of practical joking, and would perhaps be called to order\r\nif he shook a mouse out of his trouser leg, like “Pater” Winton in\r\nKipling’s story, he has within reasonable limits of good humour, an\r\nample licence to make sport. One well-known member of the House spends\r\nthe greater part of his Parliamentary time twisting order papers into\r\nsomething between a spill and a spear, which he then ostentatiously\r\nthrows upon the floor, as though he feared to encounter the temptation\r\nof continuing to hold them. Another is assiduous in the manufacture of\r\npaper darts, which as yet have never been thrown.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of other deliberative Assemblies have taught the House\r\nof Commons that Back Benchers are not to be trusted with inkwells.\r\nThis is probably the reason why there is no provision for making\r\nnotes, except upon one’s knee. But a lot of quiet fun can be had out\r\nof raising points of order that are not points of order, and by the\r\njudicious organisation of a hum of conversation to drown an opponent’s\r\nspeech. Isolated interjections, if possible foreign to the subject of\r\nthe Debate, and Supplementary Questions bearing no relation whatever\r\nto the original question, are also amongst the legitimate weapons\r\nof the Back Benchers. And finally, there is the great Parliamentary\r\ninstrument, the use of which is almost entirely confined to Back\r\nBenchers, of moving the Adjournment of the House. Where some luckless\r\nMinister can be tripped up in answering a question, and it can be\r\nmade to appear that the answer reveals a state of affairs definite,\r\nurgent and of public importance, the Speaker may be asked for leave to\r\nmove the adjournment. If leave be granted, the motion is made, and,\r\nif supported by 40 members, is set down for discussion at 8.15 on the\r\nsame evening, irrespective of what business has been allotted to that\r\nhour. This, in the hands of senior Back Benchers, can be turned to very\r\neffective account. Junior Back Benchers are well advised to master the\r\nuse of the lesser Parliamentary weapons to begin with.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, there is a noticeable difference between Front\r\nand Back Benchers, noticeable whether you put Back Benchers on the\r\nfront benches or Front Benchers on the back benches. Thus, in the last\r\nParliament, Mr. Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Lloyd George, addressing\r\nthe House from back bench corner seats, contrived to present the\r\nappearance of Gullivers amid Lilliputian surroundings--a phenomenon\r\nlargely attributable to the Front Bench manner. Some members of the\r\nnew Government (and one or two members of the last Government) who\r\nhave not yet attained to Front Bench dimensions, present an equally\r\nastonishing contrast of the opposite kind. Their painfully unsuccessful\r\nefforts to command attention are a source of dismay to their friends\r\nand discomfort to their foes. The secret of successful Front Benchery\r\nis heavy thinking, and a heavier form of expression. His chief weapon\r\nis the polysyllable. A Back Bencher does best to study plain speech,\r\nthe simpler the better. He may enliven his argument with jest and\r\nflippancy. He may controvert his opponent with a plain denial.\r\n\r\nWoe to the leader who makes a joke. “Pas de plaisanteries, Madame,”\r\nobserved a scandalised European monarch, to his jesting spouse: and\r\nthat is a safe rule for Front Benchers in Debate. If a man is dull\r\nenough he can get almost anywhere, once he has reached the Front\r\nBench; but ah, how difficult are the demands upon those behind him!\r\nThe speeches which the House would fill to hear from the Front Bench,\r\nwould, with equal certainty, denude it of all occupants, if delivered\r\nfrom behind. A Front Bench speech may run half an hour, three-quarters\r\nof an hour, and even, in the case of the leaders, an hour. No Back\r\nBencher should speak for more than twenty minutes, and fifteen is\r\nbetter. The Front Bench speech should be sonorous, well documented,\r\nweighty, responsible--in fact, a pronouncement. The Back Bench speech\r\nshould be pithy, strictly to the point, not too serious, and, above\r\nall, modest--in the nature of a tentative expression of opinion.\r\n\r\nFortunately Front Benchers are not always dull--though they do their\r\nbest. And Back Benchers as a rule are far from modest.\r\n\r\nFor a consequence the proceedings often provide such a feast of good\r\nfun, that successive Chancellors of the Exchequer have only narrowly\r\nresisted the imposition of an Entertainment Tax. This would be fair\r\nenough, if substantial compensation were payable for enduring the\r\nagonies of devastating boredom entailed by sitting through, for\r\ninstance, some of the Scot----\r\n\r\nHush! There are too many Members of that virile race, for such remarks\r\nto be altogether wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ORDER, ORDER”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other lands they manage things differently. The President of the\r\nLower House is enthroned on a majestic dais, at the head of a steep\r\nflight of steps; the Tribune, from which speeches are made, is beneath\r\nhim; and he could, if he wished, bring the orator to reason, or, if\r\nneed be, to the conclusion of his discourse, by a few steadying taps on\r\nthe head with the ivory mallet which (auctioneer-wise) is his normal\r\ninstrument for obtaining order. The mallet is reinforced by a large\r\nmuffin bell, which, in times of distress, the President rings. And his\r\nfinal means of expressing disapproval is to put on his hat--a custom\r\nwhich perhaps furnishes us with the source of the jolly old folk tale,\r\nrecorded in _Grimm_, of the King who used to suppress insurrections by\r\npulling down his hat over his eyes, whereby cannons were fired off in\r\nall directions. This picturesque ceremonial, far more imposing than\r\nthe procedure of the House of Commons, is also less effective for\r\nthe maintenance of order. In the course of really closely reasoned\r\narguments, in those less reticent assemblies, inkwells have been known\r\nto fly, the members have been kept from each other’s throats only by\r\nthe intervention of the sabre-girt attendants, and the very citadel of\r\nthe President himself has been beset; whereat, jangling his bell with\r\none hand, and repulsing his assailants with a ruler in the other, he\r\nhas resolutely maintained his hat upon his head, in testimony of the\r\nfact that, legally speaking and despite “the tumult and the shouting,”\r\nthe _séance_ has long been at an end.\r\n\r\nBut in the House of Commons the powers of the Speaker are\r\nsatisfactorily real; not only has he temporary jurisdiction over all\r\npersons within the precincts of the Palace, he has also unassailable\r\npower to deal with the members. He is himself both a member and\r\nsomething more than a member. He is chosen by the vote of the House;\r\nand, once approved by the King, is vested with supreme authority in\r\nthe management of the Commons. Should a point of procedure arise, his\r\ndecision is final. Should a question be put of which he disapproves\r\nhe may disallow it. Should a member say that which, in the Speaker’s\r\nopinion, should not have been said, he may order the member to\r\nwithdraw. Should his ruling be disobeyed he may send a member out of\r\nthe Chamber. Should the defiance be persisted in, he may suspend the\r\nmember from the service of the House, whereafter that member may not be\r\nadmitted to the precincts, until, by resolution, the House itself has\r\nterminated his suspension. Yet the Speaker, omnipotent though he seems,\r\nis also the servant of the House. It was instructive not long ago\r\nto hear Speaker Whitley define his powers, in relation to the Crown,\r\nalmost in the very words used by Speaker Lenthall, well-nigh three\r\nhundred years before: “For myself I think my reply must be that I have\r\nno tongue to speak in this place, but as the House is pleased to direct\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the Speaker exercises his\r\nfunctions of authority harshly. His principal weapon, in fact, is\r\na kind of awful benignity. It is doubtful if there has ever been\r\na Speaker of the House of Commons who maintained his position by\r\nseverity; indeed, the House of Commons, which is far from being the\r\nunintelligent assembly one might suppose, if one judged by the Press,\r\nwould never choose a person with whom there was the slightest risk\r\nof friction; for the House is very jealous of the rights of members.\r\nAn indication of the kind of results that might be produced by an\r\nassumption of too pedagogic a heaviness, on the part of the Chair, was\r\ngiven in the Debate on the Army and Air Force Annual Bill in the last\r\nParliament. In the early hours of the morning, after a trying all-night\r\nsitting, Sir Frederick Banbury, who was temporarily in the Chair,\r\nraised his voice a little beyond the pitch of good humour in calling\r\nto order Mr. Lansbury, who was addressing the House, whereat the\r\nlatter bluffly retorted: “You must not shout at me. Order yourself.”\r\nStrictly speaking, Mr. Lansbury was out of order in making this retort.\r\nHe should have deferred to the ruling of the temporary Chairman, and,\r\nif necessary, raised the matter with the Speaker after questions on\r\nthe following day. But there has never been in modern times a member\r\nso jealous of the privileges of the House as Sir Frederick Banbury.\r\nHe realised that tempers, his own perhaps included, had worn a little\r\nfrayed during the sitting; and therefore, contenting himself by\r\nreminding the offender that he must not challenge the decisions of the\r\nChair, he dexterously shepherded the discussion into safer channels.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Whitley keeps order by an unbroken suavity of manner, a great\r\nsense of fair play and a wise lenience towards faults committed in\r\nerror, from which it will be seen that his hold upon the House is very\r\nlargely due to the feelings of personal affection, in addition to\r\nnatural respect and loyalty, with which he is regarded by all members,\r\neven the most junior. He is quite capable of administering a rebuke,\r\nbut he prefers to conquer by gentleness: that is his peculiar quality.\r\nWith Speaker Lowther it was a keen sense of humour and, if necessary,\r\na blasting and ironic wit, that gave him his ascendancy. This is not\r\nto say that Speaker Whitley is always grave; far from it. His rulings\r\nare most often touched with humour. But it is a quiet, gentle humour,\r\nlike the man himself--the humour of a serious man, not the _esprit_ of\r\na wit. With Mr. Speaker Peel the governing factor was a tremendous,\r\nawe-inspiring dignity--something of the same kind as that traditionally\r\nascribed to Dr. Arnold of Rugby School.\r\n\r\nIt must not, indeed, be imagined that the House of Commons never gets\r\nout of hand: nor must it be imagined that the House of Commons has\r\nonly got out of hand since the Labour Party grew large. The House of\r\nCommons must always have been a troublesome body. “Scenes” in the House\r\nhave taken place right back to the days of Oliver Cromwell; indeed,\r\nMr. Drinkwater in his play gave a vivid representation of a scene in\r\nthe House in those days. The very carpets on the floor are eloquent of\r\nwhat took place in former times; for the red line, down the outer edge\r\nof the strip that borders the front benches, is no less than a warning\r\nto members that, in speaking, they must not put their feet beyond it,\r\non pain of being “out of order”: and the purpose of this rule is to\r\nkeep them from engaging each other with their swords instead of their\r\ntongues in the heat of Debate! There were scenes in the House, constant\r\nscenes, in the old Reform Bill days and in the old Irish days. Mr.\r\nT. P. O’Connor still tells the dramatic story of the expulsion of\r\nBradlaugh, and equally dramatic stories of the bodily removal of\r\nIrish members. Mr. Lloyd George himself has stories of suspension to\r\ntell. There were scenes in Parliament just before the war--when, for\r\ninstance, Mr. McNeill threw a book at Mr. Churchill. There were scenes\r\nin the last Parliament, as when the four Labour members were suspended,\r\nand on other occasions. There will inevitably be scenes in the present\r\nParliament; and it is safe to say that scenes will take place so long\r\nas the Commons shall survive.\r\n\r\nBut whereas in other countries, despite the muffin bell and the\r\ntop hat, the President cannot avoid being drawn in, in the Mother\r\nof Parliaments the Speaker is something more than a restraining\r\ninfluence, he is the embodiment of law and order. He has behind him\r\nfor the suppression of disorder the whole power of the State. He could\r\nfill the House of Commons with police, and suppress disorder of any\r\nmagnitude; and if such an occasion arose, and threatened, as it would,\r\nour whole Parliamentary institution, the Speaker for the time being\r\nwould unhesitatingly do so. But that situation will hardly arise. We\r\ndo most things in this country in the spirit in which we play our\r\ngames. Members know that, if they transgress the rules beyond a\r\ncertain point, they will be suspended. They know that when suspended\r\nthe Speaker will sign to the Sergeant-at-Arms and the Sergeant-at-Arms,\r\nadvancing up the floor of the House, will require them to leave the\r\nChamber. And because it is part of the rules of the game that they must\r\ndo so, they will do so, in the same spirit as they would accept the\r\ndecision of the umpire in a cricket match. So much for individuals. And\r\nif a party--which happened once in the last Parliament--as an organised\r\nwhole, were to make business impossible by concerted noise, the Speaker\r\nhas yet another weapon in his armoury. Under Standing Order he may, “in\r\nview of grave disorder,” adjourn the House “without question put,” and\r\ngive the forces of reason time to reassert themselves.\r\n\r\nHow undramatic! Yes. But the whole point about the Speaker is that he\r\nis not a Loud-Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORDS AND COMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThough housed in the same building, though separated by a mere matter\r\nof yards of stone-flagged corridor and lobby, no two assemblies more\r\nessentially different in character, than the House of Commons and the\r\nHouse of Peers, could easily be imagined. They exist, it is true, for\r\nlegislative purposes, the one being complementary to the other; but\r\nwhen that has been said not many points of similarity remain. The\r\nSpeaker of the Commons is enthroned in a majestic canopied chair,\r\ndominating the Assembly over which he rules; the Lord Chancellor,\r\nwho presides over the proceedings of the House of Lords, squats on a\r\nmonstrous crimson cushion, like a feather-bed gone mad, facing a yet\r\nmore monstrous crimson cushion upon which, on occasions of State,\r\nHis Majesty’s Judges sit back to back, reproducing that obsolete\r\nformation, the hollow square, with which we won the battle of\r\nWaterloo. The Speaker of the Commons is so called because he so seldom\r\nspeaks--because, indeed, he is the only member of the House who may\r\nnot speak, except as the House directs him. The Lord Chancellor, on\r\nthe other hand, may, and habitually does, indulge in any flights of\r\ndithyrambic eloquence that happen to surge out of his teeming brain;\r\nand, though, unlike the Speaker, it does not lie with him to determine\r\nthe order in which Noble Lords shall address the House, he might, if he\r\nchose, monopolise the whole time with his own speeches. Indeed, when\r\nLord Birkenhead was Chancellor such a happening was not regarded as....\r\n\r\nFortunately, no such proceeding is possible in the House of Commons,\r\nor, with a series of stunning reports, Mr. Pringle, Commander Kenworthy\r\nand Mr. David Kirkwood would explode from suppressed mortification;\r\nand there are others whose peace of mind would be seriously impaired.\r\nBut in the House of Lords they are only too anxious to avoid speaking;\r\nindeed, the difficulty usually seems to be, to overcome the natural\r\nreluctance of Noble Lords to allow their voices to be heard, in that\r\nrarefied atmosphere, before they have reached the years of threescore\r\nand ten, laid down by the Psalmist as the normal span of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances of difference what wonder that each House regards\r\nthe other as a sort of _lusus naturæ_, a freak, a giant pumpkin? This\r\nsense of strangeness finds the extreme of its expression, in the House\r\nof Commons, in such outbursts as Mr. Jack Jones’s bitter expostulation\r\nagainst “those marionettes,” on the occasion when the Commons were\r\nsent for by the Lords to hear a Commission read, and found in the\r\nGilded Chamber five Lords Commissioners resplendent in robes, seated in\r\nline; a solitary Back Bench Bishop, and one very junior Peer, probably\r\na mere Baron, who, having wandered in by mistake, sought to efface\r\nhimself under the lee of Black Rod’s box. “That,” said Mr. Jack Jones\r\nbitterly, “is what they think of _Us_.” Indeed, a chilling disdain is\r\nthe chief characteristic of the public attitude of the Upper towards\r\nthe Lower House--as for instance when the latter, in a new Parliament,\r\nare haughtily bidden to “repair to the place where you are to sit,”\r\nas though they were fowls, “and proceed to the choice of some proper\r\nperson to be your Speaker,” as though, without that admonition, they\r\nwould choose somebody from the neighbourhood of Leicester Square. This\r\nwell-bred contempt is repaid, in the Commons, by veiled references to\r\n“another place.” On this exchange of courtesies, the Peers seem to\r\ncome off best; though, when it comes to practicalities, the positions\r\nare reversed, as any student of the Parliament Act knows only too\r\nwell--little now remaining to the Peers of their former legislative\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nThey get it back upon the faithful Commons, in virtue of their position\r\nin the Constitution as the Supreme Judicial Tribunal of the kingdom,\r\nwhereby it follows that, if, under the Parliament Act, they cannot\r\noppose indefinitely the legislative will of the Commons, they can to\r\nsome small extent indemnify themselves, in their capacity of final\r\ninterpretative authority, after the legislation has been passed. In\r\npractice they delegate this function to the Law Lords, five of whom,\r\nseated on the red benches with rickety desks in front of them, spend\r\ninterminable mornings appraising subtle and circumlocutory arguments\r\naddressed to them from the Bar of the House by learned Counsel,\r\nstanding at a kind of lectern, and surrounded by their fellows eager\r\nto propound distinctions. There is, however, nothing to prevent any\r\nNoble Lord so minded from partaking in this intellectual feast. Indeed,\r\na legend obtains of a sturdy independent Peer, jealous of what would\r\nbe called in the House of Commons “private members’ rights,” who,\r\nfor years, insisted on attending, on these occasions, and delivering\r\nhimself of ponderous allocutions of which no one present, himself\r\nleast of all, understood one word of the meaning. It says much for the\r\nself-restraint of our Hereditary Nobles that his example has not been\r\nfollowed in modern times--though with Sir Frederick Banbury elevated to\r\nthe Peerage one can never be quite sure.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords, in short, is a living example of the utility of the\r\nunworkable, the practicality of the impracticable, and the incredible\r\nsanity of the British Constitution. By all the rules of the game, in\r\na Chamber composed of more than 600 people, fully half of whom have\r\nno serious political interests, governed apparently by no rules of\r\nprocedure, and held in check, in fact, by nothing except tradition, the\r\nproceedings might be expected to be those of a disorderly rabble. In\r\nfact, 80 members is a good attendance, and 50 is nearer the average.\r\nThe speeches are as a rule so closely reasoned, so admirably informed\r\nand of such excellence of style, as to be a source of never-ending envy\r\nto members of the Commons. Such a thing as a “constituency” speech is,\r\nof course, unknown. There are no “dockyard” members. Nothing need be\r\nsaid with a view to a general election. Nor can a member of the Upper\r\nChamber be imagined making a speech, for the sake of speaking. It is\r\nnot exactly an inviting atmosphere for such an undertaking. Imagine\r\nyourself standing up to address a huge and almost empty chamber,\r\nfurnished with crimson benches, and tenanted by a smattering of elderly\r\ngentlemen all staring with polite fixity at their boots. It really\r\nlooks as though this undemocratic and almost atavistic body, despite\r\nall its anomalies, was in practice something of an example to its\r\nelective fellow-House, both in the expeditious transaction of business\r\nand in the orderliness of its proceedings. Their very method of voting\r\nis indicative of their critical keenness, their impatience with the\r\ninstitutions of this world, their determination to be satisfied with\r\nnothing less than perfection. The form of the vote is not, as in the\r\nCommons, “Aye” and “No,” but “Content” and “Not Content.”\r\n\r\nUsually they are not content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRREVERENT INTERVIEWS AND OTHER IRRELEVANCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH LORD BALFOUR AT THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe received me with exquisite courtesy, waved me into a chair, sank\r\ninto another himself, and sat, with folded hands and an expression\r\ncompounded of saintly refinement and dignified composure, regarding me\r\ngravely through limpid, untroubled eyes, protected from the tarnishing\r\nrealities of the world by horn-rimmed spectacles. His silky, white hair\r\ngleamed softly in the half-light. His moustache reposed over a mouth\r\ntouched with wistful sadness, but serene and courageous. Rarely have\r\nI seen anything more placid and self-possessed. But he had his small\r\nirritations. I was one of them.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he began, with the faintest air of hesitation, “yes. It’s\r\ngood of you to have come--er. Er--most obliging, I’m sure. It’s a\r\npity they didn’t tell me about it. You see, I’d already arranged....\r\nYes--(_really troubled_)--most unfortunate! (_Brightening._) We might\r\nwalk a little way together. (_Troubled again._) But perhaps that\r\nwouldn’t suit you--no. It would? That’s very lucky. Shall we go now?...\r\nThey’ll give me a hat, I suppose?...”\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves walking down a prodigious staircase, and I heard\r\nhim say, “Extraordinary buildings these American hotels! I always\r\nwonder on what principle they’re constructed. The groining of the roof,\r\nfor instance....” Well, to be truthful, I’m not really sure that he\r\nsaid “groining,” for my mind (I confess it with shame) was wandering\r\nspeculatively among the mysterious “them” by whom all great men are\r\nsurrounded. “They” are always lurking in the background. “They” do all\r\nthe interesting things; but when some really unpleasant job comes along\r\n“they” always work it off on “him.” You can picture “them” planning out\r\nthe day. “Now,” they say, “there’s your speech on the Irish question,\r\nyour report for the League of Nations, the article you promised to\r\nwrite for the _Hibbert Journal_, new socks and ties, another hat, and\r\nthat awful check waistcoat you bought to be exchanged for something\r\nquieter. We’ll do all that. Then there’s the christening of the Infant\r\nPrincess Vodkha, and General Thing’s funeral. You’d better take those.\r\nThey’re very important. Oh, and there’s the Pilgrims’ dinner in the\r\nevening. You can go to that, too. Mind you say nothing in your speech\r\nthat we shall be sorry for afterwards.” I should like to be one of\r\n“them,” and feel that I was really pulling my weight in the country.\r\n\r\nThat, roughly, was the train of my thoughts, when I remembered that\r\nan interviewer’s business is to interview and not to acquiesce in\r\nexcursions into the by-paths of architecture. “They” would never allow\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“--and I’ve wondered sometimes,” he was saying, “whether the cantilever\r\nhad anything to do with it. But--but, no doubt, you can tell me that.”\r\n\r\n“I can,” I said, “but it would take too long to explain. Besides, the\r\npublic expects me to put my few moments with you to a better purpose\r\nthan discussing mechanics. The world is expecting a new era to date\r\nfrom the Washington Conference; and, as the chief British delegate----”\r\n\r\n“The trouble with the world,” he replied, “is that it is perpetually\r\nexpecting the millennium. They expected it after the Congress of\r\nBerlin. They expected it to emerge from the Hague Peace Conference,\r\nand they got the Great War! They expected a new Heaven and a new Earth\r\nout of the Peace Treaty; they got the League of Nations, which was an\r\nenormous step forward. And because the League hasn’t revolutionised\r\nhumanity, because in the space of two years it hasn’t yet effectively\r\ncounter-checked all the instincts and passions which man has inherited\r\nfrom the anthropoid ape, they brand it as a failure--or, at best, a\r\nhalf success--and turn their eyes to Washington; and if we should not\r\nbe able (and who can predict that we shall be able?) to realise all the\r\npassionate hopes and aspirations in their hearts, they’ll turn away\r\nfrom our work in despair (however useful and practical it may be),\r\nand they’ll go on staring into the future, straining their sight in\r\nsearch of changes, that, by their very nature, are not to be perceived;\r\nand, because they cannot watch a kind of sensational picture-drama\r\nof evolution unfolding before their eyes, they will condemn each\r\nprogressive step as a futility.”\r\n\r\n“Now, in this particular case,” I began, for he had paused dreamily.\r\n\r\n“I have always had warm feelings for America,” he continued,\r\ninconsequently as it seemed; “indeed, some of my earliest public\r\nspeeches were devoted--Yes? Were you about to say anything?--were\r\ndevoted to pleading for what one might call a Pax Anglo-Americana, as\r\nsomething wider than the Pax Britannica, and as a step towards--a step\r\ntowards some better understanding between the various states of the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nI sought to pin him down. “And is that your expectation of the outcome\r\nof this Conference?”\r\n\r\n“I see no reason why one should not hope, and ... and, indeed, there\r\nseems to me every reason for believing, that our ... our discussions\r\nand conversations will reveal sufficient of our respective points of\r\nview to serve as a basis for future negotiations, and possibly to give\r\na broad indication of the lines upon which a general agreement might\r\nultimately be reached.”\r\n\r\nI changed front swiftly. “You were in the United States in 1917?”\r\n\r\n“In 1917, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you notice many changes?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help feeling that there is a certain popular aridity which, I\r\nshould have said, was conspicuously absent on the occasion of my last\r\nvisit. Naturally, during a war, public opinion tends to be exuberant\r\nand ... and, indeed, at times fluid----”\r\n\r\n“Then you think the political atmosphere of America has become\r\nnoticeably drier?”\r\n\r\n“I think you must not ask me to discuss the politics of a friendly\r\nPower within ... within the confines of that Power. Or, indeed, you may\r\nask, of course, but I feel it would be improper to answer.”\r\n\r\nI flung myself upon him from another angle.\r\n\r\n“People in England cannot help wondering what effect Mr. Hara’s\r\nassassination will have on the Conference.”\r\n\r\n“I have always thought,” he replied, after a pause, “that in a society\r\nso constituted as ours, it is impossible that such an incident--or, or,\r\nindeed, any incident--should be devoid of effect and significance.”\r\n\r\n“It might prejudice the issue?”\r\n\r\n“Conceivably. Or, on the other hand, in certain circumstances, by\r\ndrawing attention to what is called the War Party in Japan--if such a\r\nparty exists, as to which I say nothing--it might, in the long run,\r\nexercise quite the opposite influence.”\r\n\r\nI tried a more direct approach. “Might I ask what will be the policy of\r\nthe British Delegation?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. The policy of the British Delegation, subject to the\r\napproval of His Majesty’s Government, will be that decided upon, after\r\ndue deliberation, by the Chief Delegate in consultation with his\r\ncolleagues.”\r\n\r\nWe walked on a few yards in silence--I struggling to frame a question\r\nthat he could not evade, he with his eyes on the horizon and his\r\nthoughts (I imagine) in another planet. To relieve my evident distress,\r\nhe said at last, “Would you like me to say anything further?”\r\n\r\nI threw diplomacy to the winds and faced him with savage determination.\r\nI said to myself that I would not be trifled with.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” I cried, “we have talked for half an hour. I think I know less\r\nof your thoughts on this subject now than before we began. In the name\r\nof the publicity for which I have heard you appeal in the League of\r\nNations, say something specific of your hopes and fears, something to\r\nwhich posterity may point a finger, saying, ‘Here was a statesman with\r\nvision. He _knew_.’”\r\n\r\n“That,” he replied with gentle gravity, “is a little difficult.\r\nEr--as ... as you know, I am always unwilling to assume the _rôle_ of\r\nprophet. Indeed, I am not prepared to say that in the scheme of things\r\nas I understand it--and using ... using the word in the sense that is\r\ncustomary to me--that such a thing as a prophecy has any existence at\r\nall. But I feel--yes, I feel the necessity which you have urged upon me\r\nwith--er--with--er ... so eloquently; and I am above all things--and at\r\nall times--desirous of affording such proper information as the public\r\nought to receive, upon such a topic as our present Conference, to those\r\nwhose ... whose work it is to--to disseminate--er--such information.\r\nI see no harm, therefore, in acceding to your request, at the same\r\ntime making it clear that, since these issues are momentous and easily\r\nimperilled, you must observe the ... the greatest discretion in any\r\nuse--er--in any use to which you may put my words.”\r\n\r\nOverpowered at the apparent success of my appeal to his better\r\nfeelings, I could only bow my thanks. The veteran statesman veiled his\r\neyes with their tired lids and seemed to ponder.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said at last, “subject to what I have already stated, I see\r\nno reason why I should not say that the Outlook is not ... is not as\r\nbad as it might be. And now--yes, this is where I must leave you. It\r\nhas been a great pleasure to speak so frankly; and I know you will be\r\ndiscreet. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he left me and strolled on his way with serene detachment. But\r\nwhether the “Outlook” to which he referred was the paper of that name,\r\nor the prospect before the Washington Conference, those who have read\r\nso far are as well able to judge as I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH MONSIEUR BRIAND AFTER THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great liner warped into the quay. Hushed expectation poised itself\r\nover the multitude. A dumpy figure, almost incredibly small against the\r\nvastness of the ship, appeared at the head of the accommodation ladder,\r\nand waddled slowly down the side, followed, at a respectful distance,\r\nby obsequious midgets. It approached nearer, resolving itself into\r\na small round-shouldered man with a heavy, pale face, distinguished\r\neyebrows and prodigious moustaches. His eyes were grey and meditative;\r\nhis hair a shaggy, black mane, bursting irrepressibly from under his\r\nhat. He strode ashore, and prostrated himself on the soil of his\r\nbeloved country.\r\n\r\n“_Ah, la patrie_,” he cried in his thrilling, resonant voice, rising\r\nfrom his knees as he spoke, and lifting his right hand in solemn\r\ninvocation. “Ah, my country, thy faithful Aristide, thy humble servitor\r\nsalutes thee. He returns, inflated with no Imperialism, but none the\r\nless from the depths of his heart proud to have upheld, in thy name,\r\nbefore all the assembled conscience of mankind, those principles of\r\nliberty, those imperishable ideals of justice, of international comity\r\nand brotherhood, that fine spirit of self-abnegation in which it has\r\never been the boast of France to lead the world. Oh, liberty, what\r\nsacrifice would we not willingly offer in thy behalf? Oh, freedom,\r\nwhere is thy source if not in France? Oh, humanity----”\r\n\r\nI tapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been waiting for you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“_Vous dites, M’sieur?_” he asked indignantly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been waiting for you,” I repeated sternly. “What do I hear\r\nthat you’ve been saying in Washington about British warships and\r\nsardine-hunting, French submarines and botanical expeditions, and the\r\nunknown X?”\r\n\r\nHe showed his teeth in a grim smile.\r\n\r\n“The unknown X? _Qu’est-ce que c’est ça? M’sieur veut dire peut-être\r\n‘La femme X’?_”\r\n\r\n“No evasions,” I warned him. “I am here in the interests of the British\r\npublic. They are pained, Monsieur, pained! They know nothing of\r\ninternational politics, and very little about politicians--even their\r\nown. But they know that, in their quiet way, they’ve grown to be fond\r\nof your people. They see that you misunderstand them. And it hurts them\r\nto think that the Entente Cordiale----”\r\n\r\nHe flicked his fingers impatiently.\r\n\r\n“_L’entente cordiale! Ah, M’sieu, l’entente cordiale!_ ... Are you\r\nunderstanding French?”\r\n\r\n“Not noticeably,” I confessed.\r\n\r\n“_Alors!_ Well, I shall tell you in English.... What is it, this\r\nEntente Cordiale? _Hein?_ An understanding of friends, _n’est ce pas_?\r\nWhat the Americans call a ‘gentleman’s agreement.’ You make it because\r\nyou trust so much, that you will not care to have a Treaty. Well,\r\nthen, but you must trust your _vis-à-vis_. You must not put all the\r\nbad construction on his doing. Not even a Treaty will stand that. You\r\ncannot have Entente, and then go on nag, nag, nag, like an old peasant\r\nwoman with the toothache. Oh, it is impossible, _M’sieu_, impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Angora?” I hinted.\r\n\r\n“Angora....” He shrugged bluffly. “Well, yes, Angora. That is, perhaps,\r\na pity. We are--we are in the soup with Angora.” He passed it off with\r\na disarming grin. “But, _après tout_, what can you expect of Bouillon?\r\nWe shall settle all that.... And it is not Angora that threaten our\r\nEntente, M’sieu. Ah, no! That is a small thing. A few Kemalist do not\r\nimperil Anglo-French relations. Pouf!...”\r\n\r\nHis face grew troubled and sad.\r\n\r\n“M’sieu, you know perfectly. It is Germany. Yes. You talk a lot of\r\nthe separate peace with Turkey. In the letter that is so; but in the\r\nspirit you make a separate peace with Germany. Oh, yes. This is not\r\nepigram--it is truth. Germany, she does not intend to pay. Perhaps\r\nshe cannot pay. I do not know. It is possible she cannot; but you in\r\nEngland pretend to her that she _cannot_ pay and to us that she _will_\r\npay. _Ménager la chèvre et le chou!_ Is that entente cordiale?...”\r\n\r\n“You see,” I endeavoured to explain, “this is a subject on which\r\nthere are two views in England. One side holds that Germany can pay\r\nsomething--the precise sum varies according to the knowledge and\r\ndispassion of the thinker. The other party contends that she can pay\r\nnothing at all--that it would be wiser in the general interest of\r\nEurope to cancel the whole debt; and that view, not widely held, is\r\ngaining ground----”\r\n\r\n“At the expense of France,” he interjected sharply. “Yes. Not at your\r\nexpense, my generous friend, but at the expense of France.”\r\n\r\n“That,” I answered, “is partly true; but not entirely true. Viewed in\r\nits immediate context, it may be so; but taken in perspective, the\r\ntrade revival in Germany----”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he cried, “_Ah, ça, M’sieu!_ The trade revival in Germany.\r\nAnd then, _M’sieu_, and then? The political revival of Germany. The\r\nmilitary revival of Germany. The German hegemony. Mittel Europa.\r\n_Merci, M’sieu!_ And France, what of France?”\r\n\r\n“France,” I began, “is a member of the League of Nations.”\r\n\r\n“And Germany,” he replied, “is not. And America is not. And Russia,\r\nwith her army of two millions, is not. Thank you for your League of\r\nNations, _M’sieu_. What will it be in ten years? Perhaps the great\r\nco-ordinating harmoniser of the whole world. Perhaps not. What is\r\nAmerica wishing since I leave Washington. They will have a new League,\r\nwith no Covenant. _C’est à dire_ nothing that binds--nothing that give\r\nsecurity to such as France. Just a lot of amiable pleasantry, that\r\nyou interpret as you please. Much of your Press are support them. Do\r\nthat give confidence to France?... First we are to have the Tripartite\r\nTreaty--England, America, France. Then that is not ratify. And our\r\nEnglish friends say, ‘Never mind. You have it all in Article 10. The\r\nLeague of Nations will protect you.’ Now, perhaps, the League will\r\nfollow the Tripartite Treaty. Oh, yes, I know they say the Association\r\nwill be side by side with the League. But how can you have that? It is\r\na rival system. They say it will be found upon The Hague Tribunal. Then\r\nwhat comes to the International Court? It is to make of international\r\npolitics a kind of _bouillabaisse_.... _Non, M’sieu!_ I am head of a\r\nGovernment. I am responsible to a nation. Do you seriously advise me to\r\ntrust in the League of Nations?”\r\n\r\n“I advise you,” I answered, “to trust more in ideas, and less in\r\nthings. Ideas let loose in the world cannot be destroyed. The League of\r\nNations is an idea--not an office at Geneva. Civilisation is an idea;\r\nreligion is an idea. What banded the nations together for the Great\r\nWar? The strength of an idea.”\r\n\r\n“Self-preservation,” he muttered, cynically.\r\n\r\n“_Monsieur le Président_, that is unworthy.” (He bowed ironically at\r\nthe rebuke.) “It is the contemptible argument of the materialist. What\r\ndrew our young men to fight in 1914? Self-preservation. Never! I doubt\r\nif half of them knew the meaning of it. It was the conviction that an\r\nevil thing was being done, and the belief that it was their duty to\r\nprevent it.”\r\n\r\n“Some of your Statesmen,” he continued, as if my remark had not\r\nbeen made, “are so kind as to teach my Government his business.\r\nThey stand up in public and lecture us, warn us. Italy go wild with\r\nrage, because some lying journalist attribute to me what I have not\r\nsaid. England and America link arms and get drunk on formulas of\r\ndisarmament, that perhaps mean nothing in the light of science to-day.\r\nJapan disguise herself as a mandarin and go behind the scenes in\r\nChina ... and Germany and Russia look on with sardonic satisfaction\r\nto see the isolation of France, and prepare for the next ‘Day’!\r\nThat give one great encouragement to disarm. And all the time to be\r\nuncertain--uncertain of one’s friends.... You say your people, they\r\nhave love for France. _Ma foi_, they take a strange method to show\r\nit!... I do not understand. No, I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Must one,” I asked him, “must one always understand? Cannot one have\r\nfaith in a friendship, tried and proved?”\r\n\r\n“You say to have faith,” he mused. “Yes, but that is not so easy. For\r\nevery belief there must be a foundation--the rock on which the Church\r\nis build. Where is my rock?”\r\n\r\n“The English dead,” I murmured.\r\n\r\nHis voice suddenly softened.\r\n\r\n“_Ah, M’sieu_, those dead. I was forgetting.... We have all lived\r\nat so much pressure since the Peace, that we forget too often the\r\nfundamentals. We live for so many such strenuous years steeped in\r\nsentiment, that now we have a reaction.... Those dead in their quiet\r\ngraves in the North of France--sleeping there till the end of time.\r\n\r\n“Yes. We have been too impatient, and we say things that we do not\r\nmean. It is not only here in France; your Ministers, too, have been at\r\nfault. But, _au fond_, it means nothing.\r\n\r\n“Listen. I shall tell you. Let us speak no more of _L’Entente\r\nCordiale_. It is a phrase of politicians and tradesmen. We shall say\r\nin future _La Grande Amitié_. It shall be--it is--a great love between\r\ntwo peoples, sanctified in a bitter struggle for a common aim.... I am\r\nglad to have talked with you, _M’sieu_. Perhaps our conversation can be\r\nhaving good results.\r\n\r\n“Do not be too hasty with us. Remember, France have much to fear on the\r\nContinent. If we do what seem to you wrong, then be patient. It is not\r\nperversity, always.”\r\n\r\nHe clambered into the car that waited, and drove away through the\r\ncheering ranks of his fellow-countrymen....\r\n\r\nAnd I wondered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH MR. LLOYD GEORGE DURING HIS PREMIERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n“... And which of us,” he said, smiling at me over the breakfast table,\r\n“which of us do you wish to see?”\r\n\r\nI murmured that I did not understand--er....\r\n\r\n“A friend of yours writing in the press,” he explained drily, “has been\r\ngood enough to find in me a second Jekyll and Hyde. Very well. With\r\nwhich of us do you wish to talk--Lloyd Jekyll or Hyde George?”\r\n\r\n“Which,” I asked cautiously, “is which?”\r\n\r\n“Both,” he replied, “are Me. Your friend misconceives the situation.\r\nHe attributes all my political mistakes and failures to Hyde; and the\r\nsuccesses I attain to Jekyll. But the truth is that between them they\r\nhave always pulled me this way and that; and most of my actions are a\r\ncompromise between their conflicting injunctions. Hyde is still the\r\nshrewd Welsh solicitor, who sharpened his wits from morning to night,\r\nthat Jekyll might have his opportunity. Jekyll is still the idealist\r\nwho dreamt in his youth of Welsh Home Rule; who upheld the Boers in\r\nhis middle age because of the nobility of their struggle against\r\noverwhelming odds; and now in the fullness of maturity has conferred\r\nupon Ireland the freedom she has sought for centuries.”\r\n\r\n“But----” I interjected.\r\n\r\nHe waved me aside. An inspiration had mastered him.\r\n\r\n“The clouds of despair,” he chanted, “were gathered over our heads.\r\nThey menaced our security, they threatened our national safety. No\r\navenue of peace has been left unexplored.... The helmsman stands stark\r\nand firm, on the crosstrees. The ship of State lurches perilously on\r\nthe ocean. The captain cons the passage with anxious eyes, the binnacle\r\nclasped in his hand, his belaying-pin beside him. Mountainous billows\r\ntower above us. The hour is dark. The time is nigh. Shipwreck, despite\r\nall our efforts, appears inevitable.... But faith, like a little child,\r\nsteals in with the dawn; and the splendour of the sunlight, bursting\r\nupon the immemorial hills, floods the valleys with limpid rapture,\r\nand bathes all nature in joy unspeakable. The sheep frolic around the\r\nhomestead. The housewife plies her needle with diligent care. And\r\nthe ship of State, with its lonely pilot, worn but triumphant on the\r\nforecastle, glides in safety into the appointed harbour----”\r\n\r\n“This,” I protested, “is not an Eisteddfodd,” but he ignored me.\r\n\r\n“The tempest,” he continued, “the tempest will abate; the watchers will\r\ncome down upon the shore with gladness in their hearts; and the golden\r\nglory of my native hills will shine in the souls of men, leading them\r\nupward, and ever toward the light.”\r\n\r\nA galvanic sweep of the arms brought this whirlwind of speech to a\r\nconclusion. A dish of eggs and bacon abruptly clattered on the floor.\r\nHe pushed the muffins towards me, and refilled his teacup.\r\n\r\n“Hyde has been trying to persuade me for some time,” he began, leaning\r\nforward confidentially, “to go to the country on the Irish issue. A\r\nfar stronger rallying cry than ‘Hang the Kaiser!’ and ‘Search their\r\npockets!’ Better even than the ‘Land fit for heroes’ and the ‘Bulging\r\ncorn-bins.’ It would have been quite easy, you know, to break off\r\nnegotiations on the question of allegiance. From the point of view of\r\nexpediency there was a lot to be said for it. It might have swept the\r\ncountry. But Jekyll refused. I think he was right.\r\n\r\n“All the same, Hyde’s a shrewd fellow. He sees in a flash what can\r\nbe turned to good account. He prides himself on knowing what the\r\npublic wants; and he makes me give it to them. My speech just now,\r\nfor instance, would have been immensely successful in the House of\r\nCommons.... It--er--it didn’t seem to appeal to you.”\r\n\r\n“It reminded me,” I replied, “if I may say so without offence, of your\r\nChristmas message to the _Lloyd George Liberal Magazine_.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, “another of Hyde’s activities. You read the\r\nmagazine, then?”\r\n\r\n“Not often,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” he said, “I am afraid you found my message wanting in\r\nliterary flavour.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I should say its flavour was almost too pronounced.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled ruefully.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “you may be right--though personally I thought one or\r\ntwo passages rather fine. But, of course, Hyde ... the truth is, the\r\nfellow has an unerring flair for political situations; and he’s always\r\nbringing forward these highly flavoured sentiments and fathering them\r\non to me, on the plea that they’re what the public wants. And the worst\r\nof it is, he’s right. The public likes that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n“Not the intelligent public,” I remonstrated.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by that. If you mean the _intelligentsia_,\r\nthey don’t count politically.... Suppose my Government fell, what would\r\nhappen? There’d be a General Election--in which I’m afraid Hyde George\r\nwould come to the front--which I might lose. Another Government would\r\nreplace me--perhaps Edward Grey and Bob Cecil. And then? One of two\r\nthings. Either they’d carry on in the same quiet, undistinguished and\r\noften shifty manner, as I do, balancing one interest against another,\r\nand being satisfied with the occasional inch of progress that one makes\r\nfrom time to time; or they’d launch out in an ambitious way, and the\r\nconflicting interests of modern society would crush them in six months.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” I said, “government in accordance with principle----”\r\n\r\n“The fundamental principle of Government,” he interrupted, “is\r\nreputed to be the consent of the governed. But one is not always\r\ndealing with first principles; and for practical purposes one of the\r\nmost indispensable things is the goodwill of the Press. The Press\r\nis controlled by capital interests. That is a consideration. The\r\norganisation of Labour is another consideration--powerful, though less\r\npowerful than formerly. There is the Entente with France to maintain,\r\nwithout going so far to maintain it as will offend large numbers of\r\npeople here. There is an understanding to keep with America, and\r\nan Alliance to modify with Japan. There is a part to be played in\r\nthe League of Nations, and that must often inevitably conflict with\r\nthe cordiality of this country’s relations with certain countries,\r\nthat are doing us no harm but are misconducting their relations with\r\nother countries--instances abound. There is the question of raising\r\nrevenue--who is to contribute; in what proportions; how? Every\r\ndecision you make on any detail of these subjects, is going to hit\r\nsomebody hard in the pocket, perhaps turn him out of employment.... And\r\nyou talk of principles like a professor of mathematics considering the\r\nfunctions of π. I get so tired of this unpractical nonsense. That’s\r\nwhy I can’t get on with Bob Cecil. It’s a thousand pities; for if only\r\nhe’d recognise these things and take his head out of the clouds, he’d\r\nbe invaluable at the Foreign Office.... But to hear him talk, anyone\r\nwould think, not only that my Government was a set of ill-balanced,\r\nself-seeking opportunists, inaccessible to any consideration except\r\ntheir own profit, but that what he calls honest government was as\r\nsimple as beggar-my-neighbour.”\r\n\r\n“You know, sir,” I interjected deferentially, “some people can’t help\r\nfeeling that a little more adherence to principle in dealing with\r\nIreland would have saved----”\r\n\r\n“My dear young friend,” he said in a pitying tone, “have you ever\r\nstudied the Irish question divorced from the rhodomontade of Ulster,\r\nand the hysteria of the South? If you have, you’ll see that there’s\r\nright--a lot of it--on both sides. It would have been easy enough to\r\napply a catchpenny solution to Ireland--that’s what we’ve been doing\r\nfor generations, as each successive crisis occurred. Any twopenny\r\nTory demagogue can denounce me for not giving Ireland another taste\r\nof Cromwell. But can you see British troops engaged in the process?\r\nAny paltry crank can storm at my want of faith in not giving them a\r\nRepublic long ago; but can you see this country acquiescing in the\r\nBalkanisation of the British Isles? And can you see the outside world\r\nwelcoming the creation of another small State in Europe?... You’ve got\r\nto come to solutions slowly in these matters; and the only principle\r\nthat counts, is the preservation of the Commonwealth of Nations to\r\nwhich we belong.”\r\n\r\n“And have you preserved that by your settlement?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“It depends,” he said gravely, “on the spirit in which it is carried\r\nout. If neither party in Ireland can agree, and if they will not be\r\nreconciled to us, then we have achieved nothing. But if,” his voice\r\ngrew in volume, “if there is a purpose in life; and if great trust\r\nbreeds great trust, as I believe; and if faith and hope are more than\r\nwords to humanity, and direct our thoughts and inspire our bravest\r\nacts; then, surely, this work will endure.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand, solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” I said, “I have travelled much in our Empire. The Dominions are\r\nmy second home. Are they to be Dominions still? Or, if they claim it,\r\nare they to become Free States also?”\r\n\r\n“It is a Dominion status,” he replied. “The name does not matter.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?”\r\n\r\n“The real tie,” he answered, “must be one of loyalty and love. It is a\r\nsmall matter how the thing is called: and if those qualities are absent\r\nyou will not better it by the name of Dominion....\r\n\r\n“And now,” he said, “I’ve talked long enough. I’ve a Cabinet Council\r\nand an interview with the Foreign Secretary to get through before\r\nlunch; and there are three confounded deputations which Hyde insists on\r\nmy seeing personally. So you must go.”\r\n\r\nWherewith he disappeared through one of the multitude of doors\r\nsurrounding his breakfast-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH LORD BIRKENHEAD ON THE WOOLSACK\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had thrown himself negligently into a formidable wooden armchair.\r\nLace ruffles of the eighteenth century clung round his wrists, and\r\npartly concealed his hands. Crossed over its fellow-knee, he displayed\r\nwith pardonable ostentation a powerful calf, set on a shapely ankle,\r\nand set off by the silken hose of his high office. A prodigious\r\ncigar--Flor Monumento--protruded from the corner of his mouth.\r\nIntellectual intolerance was the distinguishing characteristic of his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen ushers, marshals, petty bag keepers, javelin men and\r\nother menials, who had heralded me into the presence, bowed themselves\r\nobsequiously out. I sat down nervously on the edge of a chair. He eyed\r\nme with a freezing compound of disdainful curiosity and disfavour.\r\nAbashed out of countenance, I slipped out of my hands and fell on\r\nthe floor with a faint thud. It seemed that it would only add to the\r\nsolecism if I began groping about on the floor for myself--I made up my\r\nmind that I would let myself lie where I had fallen, until he wasn’t\r\nlooking; but, somewhat to my surprise, he picked me up in the most\r\ncourtly manner, dusted me, and restored me to my chair.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed,” he said reassuringly. “It’s the look that does it.\r\nNo witness has ever resisted it yet. They used to curl up, and go limp,\r\nand lean over the side of the box, when I began my cross-examination;\r\nand it has not lost its power.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever tried it on Mr. Lloyd George?” I gasped.\r\n\r\n“Once,” he replied, “only once, and that long ago--for, you understand,\r\nit would hardly be fitting in me to hamper and embarrass His Majesty’s\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\n“Was it effective?”\r\n\r\n“I think I may claim that it impaired his digestion seriously for a few\r\ndays. He tried to resist it, you see, and the after-effects in such a\r\ncase become cumulatively more powerful.... As a matter of fact, his\r\nvisit to Gairloch--well, perhaps I’d better say nothing further. Of\r\ncourse, the remainder of the Cabinet are the merest children. I can\r\nquell Fisher or Horne with comparative ease; I have even succeeded in\r\nmaking Curzon blush; and, as you know, on a recent occasion I overthrew\r\npoor Carson so severely that for several days they despaired of his\r\nreason. My castigations are notorious. Let me warn you to take great\r\ncare....”\r\n\r\n“Would it,” I began nervously, “would it fall under the heading of\r\nincurring a castigation, if I were so presumptuous as to inquire about\r\nyour hobbies?”\r\n\r\n“By no means. A very proper question. I am devoted to all sports.\r\nFootball, cricket, tennis, water polo, lion hunting, kiss-in-the-ring\r\nand spillikins are among my favourites; but I think that most of all\r\nI enjoy a quiet game of pogo with the Cabinet.... Sing? Yes, I sing\r\nfrequently. My favourite song? I think my favourite is that fine old\r\nditty, ‘Rendle, My Son.’ You are unacquainted with it?” He broke into a\r\nprodigious baritone:\r\n\r\n    “Where have you been all the night, Rendle, my son?\r\n     Where have you been all the night, my pretty one?\r\n       _At the O.P. Club, dear mother.\r\n       Make my bed soon,\r\n       For F. E. was there, and I fain would lie down._”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” he continued, “I am devoted to simple old songs of all\r\nkinds--‘Weel May the Dail Row,’ for instance, and ‘Solly in Our Alley.’”\r\n\r\n“And now,” I ventured to say, “... I was instructed to ask you for a\r\nChristmas message to the public.”\r\n\r\n“If you will write something of the necessary degree of sickliness,\r\nI’ve no objection to signing it,” he replied. “Or wait.... It happens\r\nthat I have to deliver a judgment in the House this afternoon, in the\r\ncase of a curious old man named Klaus against the Attorney-General\r\nfor detinue, wrongful imprisonment, and a declaration of nationality.\r\nHe has been excluded from the country under some of the numerous\r\nregulations of the Defence of the Realm Act, and his sack, which\r\nappears to contain an astonishing miscellany of objects, has been\r\nconfiscated by the Customs authorities.... Would that serve your\r\npurpose? It will figure in the next edition of my judgments.”\r\n\r\n“If I might hear it, perhaps....”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.” He drew a formidable case-book from the shelf behind him,\r\nadjusted a pair of horn spectacles, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n“In this case your lordships have been moved to set aside a decision\r\nby the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision of the King’s Bench,\r\nwhereby the Attorney-General, the Sheriff, and the Justices of Lower\r\nMudhaven were upheld in refusing admission into this country to the\r\nappellant, S. Klaus, a person of indubitable ex-enemy origin, but\r\nwidely esteemed in this country, who carries on an old-established\r\nbusiness in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\n“It has been claimed on behalf of the appellant that, by long use, he\r\nhas acquired a prescriptive domicile amounting to British nationality,\r\nwhich, since it has been enjoyed without interruption for more than\r\nninety years, is to be taken, by irrebuttable presumption, as having\r\narisen in time immemorial, which, as we are all aware, means from the\r\ntime of Richard I. It was contended for the Crown, that, by reason\r\nof the various statutes and regulations prohibiting the presence of\r\nenemies in this country during the war of 1914-1918, this user was in\r\nlaw interrupted, and therefore is bad as a plea. The appellant replies\r\nthat, despite the prohibitions, he did, in fact, continue to ply his\r\ncalling here during the four years in question; and in the Court below\r\nhe called a number of witnesses, whose credit is in no way impeached,\r\nto depose that, to their knowledge, at a certain season in each year,\r\nhe visited this country in order to keep his business afloat. This is\r\ncertainly a matter to which the attention of the proper authorities\r\nought to be drawn, for clearly at that time the appropriate person to\r\nhave carried on his affairs was the Controller of Enemy Businesses\r\nunder the supervision of the Public Trustee; and some inquiry seems to\r\nme to be called for, into the neglect of that official to carry out his\r\nduties. This, however, by the way.\r\n\r\n“Passing over the testimony of Elsie Biggers and John Marmaduke\r\nBaxter-Cunliffe, also known by the alias of ‘Tweety,’ both of whom\r\ndepose to having seen the appellant descend through the chimney in\r\ntheir respective houses a year ago, but whose tender years--three in\r\nthe first case and two and a-half, as I believe, in the second--raise\r\na doubt in my mind as to their understanding of the nature of an oath,\r\nthere is unquestionable and unimpeachable evidence of some person or\r\npersons unknown having placed a variety of articles in the houses, and,\r\nindeed, in the stockings, of a number of the deponents in this cause,\r\nwhich were not there before. The appellant avers that it was he who\r\nplaced them there; and, as no alternative hypothesis has been advanced\r\nby the Crown, I should, I think, be disposed to accept the appellant’s\r\nword as conclusive, were it necessary for me, in advising your\r\nlordships as to the judgment which your lordships will shortly deliver,\r\nto pronounce either upon one side or upon the other in this conflict of\r\ntestimony--so far as it can be so called.\r\n\r\n“But is it necessary to go into these questions? Mr. Attorney-General,\r\n_arguendo_, has urged upon us that, where a person performs an act of\r\nwhich he is legally incapable, then it is as if the act in question had\r\nnot been performed; and he cites the cases of a child under seven, who\r\nis _doli incapax_, and of a child between seven and fourteen, who is\r\n_prima facie doli incapax_, and the case of a minor incurring a debt\r\nother than for necessaries, and of a person who makes a will, not in\r\ndue form of law. From these premises, he contends that, since it was\r\nillegal for the appellant to come to, or be in, this country, it must\r\nbe taken, for our purposes, that he was never there; and the plea of\r\nprescriptive domicile must fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n“My lords, I am unable to resist this argument. Where a person, whether\r\nwilfully or not, steps outside the ambit of the law, it is clearly\r\nestablished that he does so at his own risk; and ignorance will not\r\nthereafter avail him as an excuse. I must advise your lordships to\r\npronounce, that, despite the evidence, the appellant was not in this\r\ncountry during the war, that the user upon which he bases his title was\r\ninterrupted during that time, and, consequently, that his first plea\r\nmust fail----”\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and looked at me, quizzically.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of that reasoning?” he asked. “Ingenious, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly ingenuous though,” I murmured; “and it seems to me----”\r\n\r\nHe drew himself to his full height, and glared. One corner of his mouth\r\nwent down, and the other rose to the level of his lower eyelid. It was\r\nthe celebrated sneer.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” he said icily, “no doubt in the purlieus of Tooting Bec or\r\nBrockley, whichever you inhabit, remarks of that kind pass current as\r\nwit. I daresay, among cannibals and anthropoid apes, there is to be\r\nfound a rough sense of coarse buffoonery that is tickled by such vulgar\r\nexuberance; but, among the aristocracy of an old civilisation, your\r\nbehaviour would provoke pity, rather than mirth, were it not that, with\r\nus, the impudence of a scavenger is accounted a more noxious thing than\r\nhis trade----”\r\n\r\n“Really,” I began, “I must protest----”\r\n\r\n“What? Argument?” he cried harshly. He smote a bell. An old and\r\ntrembling man doddered into the room. He pointed dramatically.\r\n\r\n“Remove it,” he ordered.... I judged it best to remove myself.\r\n\r\nAnd as I walked away along the corridor the notes of “Rendle, My Son”\r\nfloated after me. Only at that distance I could not be quite sure that\r\nthe name was Rendle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD TORY\r\n\r\n\r\n    Spurn the Liberals: do not love them,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n    We are very much above them,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n    But we want to rule the nation;\r\n    So, for mere self-preservation,\r\n    We will steal their legislation,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n\r\n    Never trust the Labour Party,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n    They’re as wicked as Astarte,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n    And the voter is a noodle;\r\n    So we’ll win on _this_ flapdoodle--\r\n    “They will strip you of your boodle,”\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n\r\n    When we’ve carried all before us,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n    We will praise ourselves in chorus,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n    We’ll acclaim ourselves as sages,\r\n    We’ll do all our jobs by stages,\r\n    And we’ll hang things up for ages,\r\n                                Son o’ mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD AND EUSTACE\r\n\r\n_A Tale with a Moral._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh, uncle, why is Mister Wood\r\n    So unequivocally good?\r\n    And, in the name of mercy,\r\n    Why does his comrade look so riled,\r\n    So rigid and unreconciled,\r\n    So stern of purpose?\r\n                          Hush, my child,\r\n        _That_ is Lord Eustace Percy.\r\n\r\n    A most exemplary young man,\r\n    A blameless Sabbatarian--\r\n        By happy dispensation,\r\n    They used to rule, E.
