I then intended, as soon as I could, to present them\r\nmore fully, but the opportunity did not for a long time occur. In the\r\nmeanwhile I became even more firmly convinced of their truth, and saw\r\nmore completely and clearly their relations; and I also saw how many\r\nfalse ideas and erroneous habits of thought stood in the way of their\r\nrecognition, and how necessary it was to go over the whole ground.\r\n\r\nThis I have here tried to do, as thoroughly as space would permit. It\r\nhas been necessary for me to clear away before I could build up, and\r\nto write at once for those who have made no previous study of such\r\nsubjects, and for those who are familiar with economic reasonings;\r\nand, so great is the scope of the argument that it has been impossible\r\nto treat with the fullness they deserve many of the questions raised.\r\nWhat I have most endeavored to do is to establish general principles,\r\ntrusting to my readers to carry further their applications where this\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\nIn certain respects this book will be best appreciated by those who\r\nhave some knowledge of economic literature; but no previous reading\r\nis necessary to the understanding of the argument or the passing of\r\njudgment upon its conclusions. The facts upon which I have relied are\r\nnot facts which can be verified only by a search through libraries.\r\nThey are facts of common observation and common knowledge, which every\r\nreader can verify for himself, just as he can decide whether the\r\nreasoning from them is or is not valid.\r\n\r\nBeginning with a brief statement of facts which suggest this inquiry,\r\nI proceed to examine the explanation currently given in the name of\r\npolitical economy of the reason why, in spite of the increase of\r\nproductive power, wages tend to the minimum of a bare living. This\r\nexamination shows that the current doctrine of wages is founded upon\r\na misconception; that, in truth, wages are produced by the labor for\r\nwhich they are paid, and should, other things being equal, increase\r\nwith the number of laborers. Here the inquiry meets a doctrine which\r\nis the foundation and center of most important economic theories,\r\nand which has powerfully influenced thought in all directions—the\r\nMalthusian doctrine, that population tends to increase faster than\r\nsubsistence. Examination, however, shows that this doctrine has no\r\nreal support either in fact or in analogy, and that when brought to a\r\ndecisive test it is utterly disproved.\r\n\r\nThus far the results of the inquiry, though extremely important, are\r\nmainly negative. They show that current theories do not satisfactorily\r\nexplain the connection of poverty with material progress, but throw\r\nno light upon the problem itself, beyond showing that its solution\r\nmust be sought in the laws which govern the distribution of wealth.\r\nIt therefore becomes necessary to carry the inquiry into this field.\r\nA preliminary review shows that the three laws of distribution must\r\nnecessarily correlate with each other, which as laid down by the\r\ncurrent political economy they fail to do, and an examination of the\r\nterminology in use reveals the confusion of thought by which this\r\ndiscrepancy has been slurred over. Proceeding then to work out the laws\r\nof distribution, I first take up the law of rent. This, it is readily\r\nseen, is correctly apprehended by the current political economy. But it\r\nis also seen that the full scope of this law has not been appreciated,\r\nand that it involves as corollaries the laws of wages and interest—the\r\ncause which determines what part of the produce shall go to the land\r\nowner necessarily determining what part shall be left for labor and\r\ncapital. Without resting here, I proceed to an independent deduction\r\nof the laws of interest and wages. I have stopped to determine the\r\nreal cause and justification of interest, and to point out a source of\r\nmuch misconception—the confounding of what are really the profits of\r\nmonopoly with the legitimate earnings of capital. Then returning to the\r\nmain inquiry, investigation shows that interest must rise and fall with\r\nwages, and depends ultimately upon the same thing as rent—the margin\r\nof cultivation or point in production where rent begins. A similar but\r\nindependent investigation of the law of wages yields similar harmonious\r\nresults. Thus the three laws of distribution are brought into mutual\r\nsupport and harmony, and the fact that with material progress rent\r\neverywhere advances is seen to explain the fact that wages and interest\r\ndo not advance.\r\n\r\nWhat causes this advance of rent is the next question that arises,\r\nand it necessitates an examination of the effect of material progress\r\nupon the distribution of wealth. Separating the factors of material\r\nprogress into increase of population and improvements in the arts,\r\nit is first seen that increase in population tends constantly, not\r\nmerely by reducing the margin of cultivation, but by localizing the\r\neconomies and powers which come with increased population, to increase\r\nthe proportion of the aggregate produce which is taken in rent, and to\r\nreduce that which goes as wages and interest. Then eliminating increase\r\nof population, it is seen that improvement in the methods and powers of\r\nproduction tends in the same direction, and, land being held as private\r\nproperty, would produce in a stationary population all the effects\r\nattributed by the Malthusian doctrine to pressure of population.\r\nAnd then a consideration of the effects of the continuous increase\r\nin land values which thus spring from material progress reveals in\r\nthe speculative advance inevitably begotten when land is private\r\nproperty a derivative but most powerful cause of the increase of rent\r\nand the crowding down of wages. Deduction shows that this cause must\r\nnecessarily produce periodical industrial depressions, and induction\r\nproves the conclusion; while from the analysis which has thus been made\r\nit is seen that the necessary result of material progress, land being\r\nprivate property, is, no matter what the increase in population, to\r\nforce laborers to wages which give but a bare living.\r\n\r\nThis identification of the cause that associates poverty with progress\r\npoints to the remedy, but it is to so radical a remedy that I have\r\nnext deemed it necessary to inquire whether there is any other remedy.\r\nBeginning the investigation again from another starting point, I have\r\npassed in examination the measures and tendencies currently advocated\r\nor trusted in for the improvement of the condition of the laboring\r\nmasses. The result of this investigation is to prove the preceding\r\none, as it shows that nothing short of making land common property can\r\npermanently relieve poverty and check the tendency of wages to the\r\nstarvation point.\r\n\r\nThe question of justice now naturally arises, and the inquiry passes\r\ninto the field of ethics. An investigation of the nature and basis\r\nof property shows that there is a fundamental and irreconcilable\r\ndifference between property in things which are the product of labor\r\nand property in land; that the one has a natural basis and sanction\r\nwhile the other has none, and that the recognition of exclusive\r\nproperty in land is necessarily a denial of the right of property\r\nin the products of labor. Further investigation shows that private\r\nproperty in land always has, and always must, as development proceeds,\r\nlead to the enslavement of the laboring class; that land owners can\r\nmake no just claim to compensation if society choose to resume its\r\nright; that so far from private property in land being in accordance\r\nwith the natural perceptions of men, the very reverse is true, and\r\nthat in the United States we are already beginning to feel the effects\r\nof having admitted this erroneous and destructive principle.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry then passes to the field of practical statesmanship. It\r\nis seen that private property in land, instead of being necessary to\r\nits improvement and use, stands in the way of improvement and use, and\r\nentails an enormous waste of productive forces; that the recognition\r\nof the common right to land involves no shock or dispossession, but is\r\nto be reached by the simple and easy method of abolishing all taxation\r\nsave that upon land values. And this an inquiry into the principles of\r\ntaxation shows to be, in all respects, the best subject of taxation.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the effects of the change proposed then shows that\r\nit would enormously increase production; would secure justice in\r\ndistribution; would benefit all classes; and would make possible an\r\nadvance to a higher and nobler civilization.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry now rises to a wider field, and recommences from another\r\nstarting point. For not only do the hopes which have been raised\r\ncome into collision with the widespread idea that social progress is\r\npossible only by slow race improvement, but the conclusions we have\r\narrived at assert certain laws which, if they are really natural laws,\r\nmust be manifest in universal history. As a final test, it therefore\r\nbecomes necessary to work out the law of human progress, for certain\r\ngreat facts which force themselves on our attention, as soon as we\r\nbegin to consider this subject, seem utterly inconsistent with what\r\nis now the current theory. This inquiry shows that differences in\r\ncivilization are not due to differences in individuals, but rather\r\nto differences in social organization; that progress, always kindled\r\nby association, always passes into retrogression as inequality is\r\ndeveloped; and that even now, in modern civilization, the causes which\r\nhave destroyed all previous civilizations are beginning to manifest\r\nthemselves, and that mere political democracy is running its course\r\ntoward anarchy and despotism. But it also identifies the law of social\r\nlife with the great moral law of justice, and, proving previous\r\nconclusions, shows how retrogression may be prevented and a grander\r\nadvance begun. This ends the inquiry. The final chapter will explain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of this inquiry will be obvious. If it has been\r\ncarefully and logically pursued, its conclusions completely change the\r\ncharacter of political economy, give it the coherence and certitude of\r\na true science, and bring it into full sympathy with the aspirations of\r\nthe masses of men, from which it has long been estranged. What I have\r\ndone in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have\r\nsought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school\r\nof Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the schools of Proudhon\r\nand Lasalle; to show that _laissez faire_ (in its full true meaning)\r\nopens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to\r\nidentify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the\r\nminds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions.\r\n\r\nThis work was written between August, 1877, and March, 1879, and\r\nthe plates finished by September of that year. Since that time new\r\nillustrations have been given of the correctness of the views herein\r\nadvanced, and the march of events—and especially that great movement\r\nwhich has begun in Great Britain in the Irish land agitation—shows\r\nstill more clearly the pressing nature of the problem I have endeavored\r\nto solve. But there has been nothing in the criticisms they have\r\nreceived to induce the change or modification of these views—in fact,\r\nI have yet to see an objection not answered in advance in the book\r\nitself. And except that some verbal errors have been corrected and a\r\npreface added, this edition is the same as previous ones.\r\n\r\n  HENRY GEORGE.\r\n  NEW YORK, _November_,

PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ye build! ye build! but ye enter not in,\r\n    Like the tribes whom the desert devoured in their sin;\r\n    From the land of promise ye fade and die,\r\n    Ere its

in\r\nwealth-producing power. The utilization of steam and electricity, the\r\nintroduction of improved processes and labor-saving machinery, the\r\ngreater subdivision and grander scale of production, the wonderful\r\nfacilitation of exchanges, have multiplied enormously the effectiveness\r\nof labor.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this marvelous era it was natural to expect, and\r\nit was expected, that labor-saving inventions would lighten the toil\r\nand improve the condition of the laborer; that the enormous increase in\r\nthe power of producing wealth would make real poverty a thing of the\r\npast. Could a man of the last century—a Franklin or a Priestley—have\r\nseen, in a vision of the future, the steamship taking the place of the\r\nsailing vessel, the railroad train of the wagon, the reaping machine\r\nof the scythe, the threshing machine of the flail; could he have heard\r\nthe throb of the engines that in obedience to human will, and for the\r\nsatisfaction of human desire, exert a power greater than that of all\r\nthe men and all the beasts of burden of the earth combined; could he\r\nhave seen the forest tree transformed into finished lumber—into doors,\r\nsashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly the touch of a human\r\nhand; the great workshops where boots and shoes are turned out by the\r\ncase with less labor than the old-fashioned cobbler could have put on\r\na sole; the factories where, under the eye of a girl, cotton becomes\r\ncloth faster than hundreds of stalwart weavers could have turned it out\r\nwith their handlooms; could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth\r\nshafts and mighty anchors, and delicate machinery making tiny watches;\r\nthe diamond drill cutting through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil\r\nsparing the whale; could he have realized the enormous saving of labor\r\nresulting from improved facilities of exchange and communication—sheep\r\nkilled in Australia eaten fresh in England, and the order given by the\r\nLondon banker in the afternoon executed in San Francisco in the morning\r\nof the same day; could he have conceived of the hundred thousand\r\nimprovements which these only suggest, what would he have inferred as\r\nto the social condition of mankind?\r\n\r\nIt would not have seemed like an inference; further than the vision\r\nwent it would have seemed as though he saw; and his heart would have\r\nleaped and his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from a height\r\nbeholds just ahead of the thirst-stricken caravan the living gleam of\r\nrustling woods and the glint of laughing waters. Plainly, in the sight\r\nof the imagination, he would have beheld these new forces elevating\r\nsociety from its very foundations, lifting the very poorest above the\r\npossibility of want, exempting the very lowest from anxiety for the\r\nmaterial needs of life; he would have seen these slaves of the lamp of\r\nknowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse, these muscles of\r\niron and sinews of steel making the poorest laborer’s life a holiday,\r\nin which every high quality and noble impulse could have scope to grow.\r\n\r\nAnd out of these bounteous material conditions he would have seen\r\narising, as necessary sequences, moral conditions realizing the golden\r\nage of which mankind have always dreamed. Youth no longer stunted and\r\nstarved; age no longer harried by avarice; the child at play with the\r\ntiger; the man with the muck-rake drinking in the glory of the stars!\r\nFoul things fled, fierce things tame; discord turned to harmony! For\r\nhow could there be greed where all had enough? How could the vice, the\r\ncrime, the ignorance, the brutality, that spring from poverty and the\r\nfear of poverty, exist where poverty had vanished? Who should crouch\r\nwhere all were freemen; who oppress where all were peers?\r\n\r\nMore or less vague or clear, these have been the hopes, these the\r\ndreams born of the improvements which give this wonderful century\r\nits preëminence. They have sunk so deeply into the popular mind as\r\nradically to change the currents of thought, to recast creeds and\r\ndisplace the most fundamental conceptions. The haunting visions of\r\nhigher possibilities have not merely gathered splendor and vividness,\r\nbut their direction has changed—instead of seeing behind the faint\r\ntinges of an expiring sunset, all the glory of the daybreak has decked\r\nthe skies before.\r\n\r\nIt is true that disappointment has followed disappointment, and that\r\ndiscovery upon discovery, and invention after invention, have neither\r\nlessened the toil of those who most need respite, nor brought plenty to\r\nthe poor. But there have been so many things to which it seemed this\r\nfailure could be laid, that up to our time the new faith has hardly\r\nweakened. We have better appreciated the difficulties to be overcome;\r\nbut not the less trusted that the tendency of the times was to overcome\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there can\r\nbe no mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come complaints\r\nof industrial depression; of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;\r\nof capital massed and wasting; of pecuniary distress among business\r\nmen; of want and suffering and anxiety among the working classes. All\r\nthe dull, deadening pain, all the keen, maddening anguish, that to\r\ngreat masses of men are involved in the words “hard times,” afflict\r\nthe world to-day. This state of things, common to communities differing\r\nso widely in situation, in political institutions, in fiscal and\r\nfinancial systems, in density of population and in social organization,\r\ncan hardly be accounted for by local causes. There is distress where\r\nlarge standing armies are maintained, but there is also distress where\r\nthe standing armies are nominal; there is distress where protective\r\ntariffs stupidly and wastefully hamper trade, but there is also\r\ndistress where trade is nearly free; there is distress where autocratic\r\ngovernment yet prevails, but there is also distress where political\r\npower is wholly in the hands of the people; in countries where paper is\r\nmoney, and in countries where gold and silver are the only currency.\r\nEvidently, beneath all such things as these, we must infer a common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThat there is a common cause, and that it is either what we call\r\nmaterial progress or something closely connected with material\r\nprogress, becomes more than an inference when it is noted that the\r\nphenomena we class together and speak of as industrial depression are\r\nbut intensifications of phenomena which always accompany material\r\nprogress, and which show themselves more clearly and strongly as\r\nmaterial progress goes on. Where the conditions to which material\r\nprogress everywhere tends are most fully realized—that is to say, where\r\npopulation is densest, wealth greatest, and the machinery of production\r\nand exchange most highly developed—we find the deepest poverty, the\r\nsharpest struggle for existence, and the most of enforced idleness.\r\n\r\nIt is to the newer countries—that is, to the countries where material\r\nprogress is yet in its earlier stages—that laborers emigrate in search\r\nof higher wages, and capital flows in search of higher interest. It is\r\nin the older countries—that is to say, the countries where material\r\nprogress has reached later stages—that widespread destitution is\r\nfound in the midst of the greatest abundance. Go into one of the new\r\ncommunities where Anglo-Saxon vigor is just beginning the race of\r\nprogress; where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude\r\nand inefficient; where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough\r\nto enable any class to live in ease and luxury; where the best house is\r\nbut a cabin of logs or a cloth and paper shanty, and the richest man is\r\nforced to daily work—and though you will find an absence of wealth and\r\nall its concomitants, you will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but\r\nthere is no destitution. No one makes an easy living, nor a very good\r\nliving; but every one _can_ make a living, and no one able and willing\r\nto work is oppressed by the fear of want.\r\n\r\nBut just as such a community realizes the conditions which all\r\ncivilized communities are striving for, and advances in the scale\r\nof material progress—just as closer settlement and a more intimate\r\nconnection with the rest of the world, and greater utilization of\r\nlabor-saving machinery, make possible greater economies in production\r\nand exchange, and wealth in consequence increases, not merely in the\r\naggregate, but in proportion to population—so does poverty take a\r\ndarker aspect. Some get an infinitely better and easier living, but\r\nothers find it hard to get a living at all. The “tramp” comes with\r\nthe locomotive, and almshouses and prisons are as surely the marks\r\nof “material progress” as are costly dwellings, rich warehouses, and\r\nmagnificent churches. Upon streets lighted with gas and patrolled by\r\nuniformed policemen, beggars wait for the passer-by, and in the shadow\r\nof college, and library, and museum, are gathering the more hideous\r\nHuns and fiercer Vandals of whom Macaulay prophesied.\r\n\r\nThis fact—the great fact that poverty and all its concomitants show\r\nthemselves in communities just as they develop into the conditions\r\ntoward which material progress tends—proves that the social\r\ndifficulties existing wherever a certain stage of progress has been\r\nreached, do not arise from local circumstances, but are, in some way or\r\nanother, engendered by progress itself.\r\n\r\nAnd, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming\r\nevident that the enormous increase in productive power which has marked\r\nthe present century and is still going on with accelerating ratio,\r\nhas no tendency to extirpate poverty or to lighten the burdens of\r\nthose compelled to toil. It simply widens the gulf between Dives and\r\nLazarus, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The march\r\nof invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century ago\r\nthe boldest imagination could not have dreamed. But in factories where\r\nlabor-saving machinery has reached its most wonderful development,\r\nlittle children are at work; wherever the new forces are anything like\r\nfully utilized, large classes are maintained by charity or live on the\r\nverge of recourse to it; amid the greatest accumulations of wealth,\r\nmen die of starvation, and puny infants suckle dry breasts; while\r\neverywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows the force of\r\nthe fear of want. The promised land flies before us like the mirage.\r\nThe fruits of the tree of knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of\r\nSodom that crumble at the touch.\r\n\r\nIt is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the\r\naverage of comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but these\r\ngains are not general. In them the lowest class do not share.[1] I do\r\nnot mean that the condition of the lowest class has nowhere nor in\r\nanything been improved; but that there is nowhere any improvement which\r\ncan be credited to increased productive power. I mean that the tendency\r\nof what we call material progress is in nowise to improve the condition\r\nof the lowest class in the essentials of healthy, happy human life.\r\nNay, more, that it is still further to depress the condition of the\r\nlowest class. The new forces, elevating in their nature though they be,\r\ndo not act upon the social fabric from underneath, as was for a long\r\ntime hoped and believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between\r\ntop and bottom. It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not\r\nunderneath society, but through society. Those who are above the point\r\nof separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down.\r\n\r\nThis depressing effect is not generally realized, for it is not\r\napparent where there has long existed a class just able to live. Where\r\nthe lowest class barely lives, as has been the case for a long time\r\nin many parts of Europe, it is impossible for it to get any lower,\r\nfor the next lowest step is out of existence, and no tendency to\r\nfurther depression can readily show itself. But in the progress of new\r\nsettlements to the conditions of older communities it may clearly be\r\nseen that material progress does not merely fail to relieve poverty—it\r\nactually produces it. In the United States it is clear that squalor\r\nand misery, and the vices and crimes that spring from them, everywhere\r\nincrease as the village grows to the city, and the march of development\r\nbrings the advantages of the improved methods of production and\r\nexchange. It is in the older and richer sections of the Union that\r\npauperism and distress among the working classes are becoming most\r\npainfully apparent. If there is less deep poverty in San Francisco than\r\nin New York, is it not because San Francisco is yet behind New York in\r\nall that both cities are striving for? When San Francisco reaches the\r\npoint where New York now is, who can doubt that there will also be\r\nragged and barefooted children on her streets?\r\n\r\nThis association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our\r\ntimes. It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social,\r\nand political difficulties that perplex the world, and with which\r\nstatesmanship and philanthropy and education grapple in vain. From it\r\ncome the clouds that overhang the future of the most progressive and\r\nself-reliant nations. It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts\r\nto our civilization, and which not to answer is to be destroyed. So\r\nlong as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but\r\nto build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the\r\ncontrast between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is\r\nnot real and cannot be permanent. The reaction must come. The tower\r\nleans from its foundations, and every new story but hastens the final\r\ncatastrophe. To educate men who must be condemned to poverty, is but to\r\nmake them restive; to base on a state of most glaring social inequality\r\npolitical institutions under which men are theoretically equal, is to\r\nstand a pyramid on its apex.\r\n\r\nAll-important as this question is, pressing itself from every quarter\r\npainfully upon attention, it has not yet received a solution which\r\naccounts for all the facts and points to any clear and simple remedy.\r\nThis is shown by the widely varying attempts to account for the\r\nprevailing depression. They exhibit not merely a divergence between\r\nvulgar notions and scientific theories, but also show that the\r\nconcurrence which should exist between those who avow the same general\r\ntheories breaks up upon practical questions into an anarchy of opinion.\r\nUpon high economic authority we have been told that the prevailing\r\ndepression is due to overconsumption; upon equally high authority,\r\nthat it is due to overproduction; while the wastes of war, the\r\nextension of railroads, the attempts of workmen to keep up wages, the\r\ndemonetization of silver, the issues of paper money, the increase of\r\nlabor-saving machinery, the opening of shorter avenues to trade, etc.,\r\nare separately pointed out as the cause, by writers of reputation.\r\n\r\nAnd while professors thus disagree, the ideas that there is a necessary\r\nconflict between capital and labor, that machinery is an evil, that\r\ncompetition must be restrained and interest abolished, that wealth may\r\nbe created by the issue of money, that it is the duty of government\r\nto furnish capital or to furnish work, are rapidly making way among\r\nthe great body of the people, who keenly feel a hurt and are sharply\r\nconscious of a wrong. Such ideas, which bring great masses of men,\r\nthe repositories of ultimate political power, under the leadership of\r\ncharlatans and demagogues, are fraught with danger; but they cannot be\r\nsuccessfully combated until political economy shall give some answer to\r\nthe great question which shall be consistent with all her teachings,\r\nand which shall commend itself to the perceptions of the great masses\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nIt must be within the province of political economy to give such\r\nan answer. For political economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the\r\nexplanation of a certain set of facts. It is the science which, in the\r\nsequence of certain phenomena, seeks to trace mutual relations and to\r\nidentify cause and effect, just as the physical sciences seek to do in\r\nother sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations upon firm ground. The\r\npremises from which it makes its deductions are truths which have the\r\nhighest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which we safely\r\nbase the reasoning and actions of everyday life, and which may be\r\nreduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion\r\nseeks the line of least resistance—viz., that men seek to gratify their\r\ndesires with the least exertion. Proceeding from a basis thus assured,\r\nits processes, which consist simply in identification and separation,\r\nhave the same certainty. In this sense it is as exact a science as\r\ngeometry, which, from similar truths relative to space, obtains its\r\nconclusions by similar means, and its conclusions when valid should\r\nbe as self-apparent. And although in the domain of political economy\r\nwe cannot test our theories by artificially produced combinations\r\nor conditions, as may be done in some of the other sciences, yet\r\nwe can apply tests no less conclusive, by comparing societies in\r\nwhich different conditions exist, or by, in imagination, separating,\r\ncombining, adding or eliminating forces or factors of known direction.\r\n\r\nI propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the methods of\r\npolitical economy the great problem I have outlined. I propose to seek\r\nthe law which associates poverty with progress, and increases want with\r\nadvancing wealth; and I believe that in the explanation of this paradox\r\nwe shall find the explanation of those recurring seasons of industrial\r\nand commercial paralysis which, viewed independently of their relations\r\nto more general phenomena, seem so inexplicable. Properly commenced\r\nand carefully pursued, such an investigation must yield a conclusion\r\nthat will stand every test, and as truth, will correlate with all other\r\ntruth. For in the sequence of phenomena there is no accident. Every\r\neffect has a cause, and every fact implies a preceding fact.\r\n\r\nThat political economy, as at present taught, does not explain the\r\npersistence of poverty amid advancing wealth in a manner which accords\r\nwith the deep-seated perceptions of men; that the unquestionable truths\r\nwhich it does teach are unrelated and disjointed; that it has failed to\r\nmake the progress in popular thought that truth, even when unpleasant,\r\nmust make; that, on the contrary, after a century of cultivation,\r\nduring which it has engrossed the attention of some of the most\r\nsubtle and powerful intellects, it should be spurned by the statesman,\r\nscouted by the masses, and relegated in the opinion of many educated\r\nand thinking men to the rank of a pseudo-science in which nothing is\r\nfixed or can be fixed—must, it seems to me, be due not to any inability\r\nof the science when properly pursued, but to some false step in its\r\npremises, or overlooked factor in its estimates. And as such mistakes\r\nare generally concealed by the respect paid to authority, I propose in\r\nthis inquiry to take nothing for granted, but to bring even accepted\r\ntheories to the test of first principles, and should they not stand the\r\ntest, freshly to interrogate facts in the endeavor to discover their\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI propose to beg no question, to shrink from no conclusion, but to\r\nfollow truth wherever it may lead. Upon us is the responsibility of\r\nseeking the law, for in the very heart of our civilization to-day women\r\nfaint and little children moan. But what that law may prove to be is\r\nnot our affair. If the conclusions that we reach run counter to our\r\nprejudices, let us not flinch; if they challenge institutions that have\r\nlong been deemed wise and natural, let us not turn back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nWAGES AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.—THE CURRENT DOCTRINE—ITS INSUFFICIENCY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.—THE MEANING OF THE TERMS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.—WAGES NOT DRAWN FROM CAPITAL, BUT PRODUCED BY THE LABOR.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.—THE MAINTENANCE OF LABORERS NOT DRAWN FROM CAPITAL.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.—THE REAL FUNCTIONS OF CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  He that is to follow philosophy must be a freeman in mind.\r\n          —_Ptolemy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE CURRENT DOCTRINE OF WAGES—ITS INSUFFICIENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nReducing to its most compact form the problem we have set out to\r\ninvestigate, let us examine, step by step, the explanation which\r\npolitical economy, as now accepted by the best authority, gives of it.\r\n\r\nThe cause which produces poverty in the midst of advancing wealth is\r\nevidently the cause which exhibits itself in the tendency, everywhere\r\nrecognized, of wages to a minimum. Let us, therefore, put our inquiry\r\ninto this compact form:\r\n\r\n _Why, in spite of increase in productive power, do wages tend to a\r\n minimum which will give but a bare living?_\r\n\r\nThe answer of the current political economy is, that wages are fixed\r\nby the ratio between the number of laborers and the amount of capital\r\ndevoted to the employment of labor, and constantly tend to the lowest\r\namount on which laborers will consent to live and reproduce, because\r\nthe increase in the number of laborers tends naturally to follow and\r\novertake any increase in capital. The increase of the divisor being\r\nthus held in check only by the possibilities of the quotient, the\r\ndividend may be increased to infinity without greater result.\r\n\r\nIn current thought this doctrine holds all but undisputed sway. It\r\nbears the indorsement of the very highest names among the cultivators\r\nof political economy, and though there have been attacks upon it, they\r\nare generally more formal than real.[2] It is assumed by Buckle as\r\nthe basis of his generalizations of universal history. It is taught in\r\nall, or nearly all, the great English and American universities, and\r\nis laid down in text-books which aim at leading the masses to reason\r\ncorrectly upon practical affairs, while it seems to harmonize with the\r\nnew philosophy, which, having in a few years all but conquered the\r\nscientific world, is now rapidly permeating the general mind.\r\n\r\nThus entrenched in the upper regions of thought, it is in cruder form\r\neven more firmly rooted in what may be styled the lower. What gives to\r\nthe fallacies of protection such a tenacious hold, in spite of their\r\nevident inconsistencies and absurdities, is the idea that the sum to\r\nbe distributed in wages is in each community a fixed one, which the\r\ncompetition of “foreign labor” must still further subdivide. The same\r\nidea underlies most of the theories which aim at the abolition of\r\ninterest and the restriction of competition, as the means whereby the\r\nshare of the laborer in the general wealth can be increased; and it\r\ncrops out in every direction among those who are not thoughtful enough\r\nto have any theories, as may be seen in the columns of newspapers and\r\nthe debates of legislative bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, widely accepted and deeply rooted as it is, it seems to me\r\nthat this theory does not tally with obvious facts. For, if wages\r\ndepend upon the ratio between the amount of labor seeking employment\r\nand the amount of capital devoted to its employment, the relative\r\nscarcity or abundance of one factor must mean the relative abundance\r\nor scarcity of the other. Thus, capital must be relatively abundant\r\nwhere wages are high, and relatively scarce where wages are low. Now,\r\nas the capital used in paying wages must largely consist of the capital\r\nconstantly seeking investment, the current rate of interest must be\r\nthe measure of its relative abundance or scarcity. So, if it be true\r\nthat wages depend upon the ratio between the amount of labor seeking\r\nemployment and the capital devoted to its employment, then high wages,\r\nthe mark of the relative scarcity of labor, must be accompanied by low\r\ninterest, the mark of the relative abundance of capital, and reversely,\r\nlow wages must be accompanied by high interest.\r\n\r\nThis is not the fact, but the contrary. Eliminating from interest the\r\nelement of insurance, and regarding only interest proper, or the return\r\nfor the use of capital, is it not a general truth that interest is\r\nhigh where and when wages are high, and low where and when wages are\r\nlow? Both wages and interest have been higher in the United States\r\nthan in England, in the Pacific than in the Atlantic States. Is it\r\nnot a notorious fact that where labor flows for higher wages, capital\r\nalso flows for higher interest? Is it not true that wherever there has\r\nbeen a general rise or fall in wages there has been at the same time\r\na similar rise or fall in interest? In California, for instance, when\r\nwages were higher than anywhere else in the world, so also was interest\r\nhigher. Wages and interest have in California gone down together. When\r\ncommon wages were $5 a day, the ordinary bank rate of interest was\r\ntwenty-four per cent. per annum. Now that common wages are $2 or $2.50\r\na day, the ordinary bank rate is from ten to twelve per cent.\r\n\r\nNow, this broad, general fact, that wages are higher in new countries,\r\nwhere capital is relatively scarce, than in old countries, where\r\ncapital is relatively abundant, is too glaring to be ignored. And\r\nalthough very lightly touched upon, it is noticed by the expounders\r\nof the current political economy. The manner in which it is noticed\r\nproves what I say, that it is utterly inconsistent with the accepted\r\ntheory of wages. For in explaining it such writers as Mill, Fawcett,\r\nand Price virtually give up the theory of wages upon which, in the\r\nsame treatises, they formally insist. Though they declare that wages\r\nare fixed by the ratio between capital and laborers, they explain the\r\nhigher wages and interest of new countries by the greater relative\r\nproduction of wealth. I shall hereafter show that this is not the fact,\r\nbut that, on the contrary, the production of wealth is relatively\r\nlarger in old and densely populated countries than in new and sparsely\r\npopulated countries. But at present I merely wish to point out the\r\ninconsistency. For to say that the higher wages of new countries are\r\ndue to greater proportionate production, is clearly to make the ratio\r\nwith production, and not the ratio with capital, the determinator of\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThough this inconsistency does not seem to have been perceived by\r\nthe class of writers to whom I refer, it has been noticed by one of\r\nthe most logical of the expounders of the current political economy.\r\nProfessor Cairnes[3] endeavors in a very ingenious way to reconcile\r\nthe fact with the theory, by assuming that in new countries, where\r\nindustry is generally directed to the production of food and what in\r\nmanufactures is called raw material, a much larger proportion of the\r\ncapital used in production is devoted to the payment of wages than in\r\nolder countries where a greater part must be expended in machinery and\r\nmaterial, and thus, in the new country, though capital is scarcer, and\r\ninterest is higher, the amount determined to the payment of wages is\r\nreally larger, and wages are also higher. For instance, of $100,000\r\ndevoted in an old country to manufactures, $80,000 would probably\r\nbe expended for buildings, machinery and the purchase of materials,\r\nleaving but $20,000 to be paid out in wages; whereas in a new country,\r\nof $30,000 devoted to agriculture, etc., not more than $5,000 would be\r\nrequired for tools, etc., leaving $25,000 to be distributed in wages.\r\nIn this way it is explained that the wage fund may be comparatively\r\nlarge where capital is comparatively scarce, and high wages and high\r\ninterest accompany each other.\r\n\r\nIn what follows I think I shall be able to show that this explanation\r\nis based upon a total misapprehension of the relations of labor to\r\ncapital—a fundamental error as to the fund from which wages are drawn;\r\nbut at present it is necessary only to point out that the connection\r\nin the fluctuation of wages and interest in the same countries and\r\nin the same branches of industry cannot thus be explained. In those\r\nalternations known as “good times” and “hard times” a brisk demand\r\nfor labor and good wages is always accompanied by a brisk demand for\r\ncapital and stiff rates of interest. While, when laborers cannot find\r\nemployment and wages droop, there is always an accumulation of capital\r\nseeking investment at low rates.[4] The present depression has been\r\nno less marked by want of employment and distress among the working\r\nclasses than by the accumulation of unemployed capital in all the great\r\ncenters, and by nominal rates of interest on undoubted security. Thus,\r\nunder conditions which admit of no explanation consistent with the\r\ncurrent theory, do we find high interest coinciding with high wages,\r\nand low interest with low wages—capital seemingly scarce when labor is\r\nscarce, and abundant when labor is abundant.\r\n\r\nAll these well known facts, which coincide with each other, point to\r\na relation between wages and interest, but it is to a relation of\r\nconjunction, not of opposition. Evidently they are utterly inconsistent\r\nwith the theory that wages are determined by the ratio between labor\r\nand capital, or any part of capital.\r\n\r\nHow, then, it will be asked, could such a theory arise? How is it that\r\nit has been accepted by a succession of economists, from the time of\r\nAdam Smith to the present day?\r\n\r\nIf we examine the reasoning by which in current treatises this theory\r\nof wages is supported, we see at once that it is not an induction from\r\nobserved facts, but a deduction from a previously assumed theory—viz.,\r\nthat wages are drawn from capital. It being assumed that capital is the\r\nsource of wages, it necessarily follows that the gross amount of wages\r\nmust be limited by the amount of capital devoted to the employment\r\nof labor, and hence that the amount individual laborers can receive\r\nmust be determined by the ratio between their number and the amount of\r\ncapital existing for their recompense.[5] This reasoning is valid, but\r\nthe conclusion, as we have seen, does not correspond with the facts.\r\nThe fault, therefore, must be in the premises. Let us see.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the theorem that wages are drawn from capital is\r\none of the most fundamental and apparently best settled of current\r\npolitical economy, and that it has been accepted as axiomatic by all\r\nthe great thinkers who have devoted their powers to the elucidation\r\nof the science. Nevertheless, I think it can be demonstrated to be\r\na fundamental error—the fruitful parent of a long series of errors,\r\nwhich vitiate most important practical conclusions. This demonstration\r\nI am about to attempt. It is necessary that it should be clear and\r\nconclusive, for a doctrine upon which so much important reasoning is\r\nbased, which is supported by such a weight of authority, which is so\r\nplausible in itself, and is so liable to recur in different forms,\r\ncannot be safely brushed aside in a paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe proposition I shall endeavor to prove, is:\r\n\r\n _That wages, instead of being drawn from capital, are in reality drawn\r\n from the product of the labor for which they are paid._[6]\r\n\r\nNow, inasmuch as the current theory that wages are drawn from capital\r\nalso holds that capital is reimbursed from production, this at first\r\nglance may seem a distinction without a difference—a mere change\r\nin terminology, to discuss which would be but to add to those\r\nunprofitable disputes that render so much that has been written upon\r\npolitico-economic subjects as barren and worthless as the controversies\r\nof the various learned societies about the true reading of the\r\ninscription on the stone that Mr. Pickwick found. But that it is much\r\nmore than a formal distinction will be apparent when it is considered\r\nthat upon the difference between the two propositions are built up all\r\nthe current theories as to the relations of capital and labor; that\r\nfrom it are deduced doctrines that, themselves regarded as axiomatic,\r\nbound, direct, and govern the ablest minds in the discussion of the\r\nmost momentous questions. For, upon the assumption that wages are drawn\r\ndirectly from capital, and not from the product of the labor, is based,\r\nnot only the doctrine that wages depend upon the ratio between capital\r\nand labor, but the doctrine that industry is limited by capital—that\r\ncapital must be accumulated before labor is employed, and labor cannot\r\nbe employed except as capital is accumulated; the doctrine that every\r\nincrease of capital gives or is capable of giving additional employment\r\nto industry; the doctrine that the conversion of circulating capital\r\ninto fixed capital lessens the fund applicable to the maintenance of\r\nlabor; the doctrine that more laborers can be employed at low than\r\nat high wages; the doctrine that capital applied to agriculture will\r\nmaintain more laborers than if applied to manufactures; the doctrine\r\nthat profits are high or low as wages are low or high, or that they\r\ndepend upon the cost of the subsistence of laborers; together with such\r\nparadoxes as that a demand for commodities is not a demand for labor,\r\nor that certain commodities may be increased in cost by a reduction in\r\nwages or diminished in cost by an increase in wages.\r\n\r\nIn short, all the teachings of the current political economy, in the\r\nwidest and most important part of its domain, are based more or less\r\ndirectly upon the assumption that labor is maintained and paid out\r\nof existing capital before the product which constitutes the ultimate\r\nobject is secured. If it be shown that this is an error, and that\r\non the contrary the maintenance and payment of labor do not even\r\ntemporarily trench on capital, but are directly drawn from the product\r\nof the labor, then all this vast superstructure is left without support\r\nand must fall. And so likewise must fall the vulgar theories which also\r\nhave their base in the belief that the sum to be distributed in wages\r\nis a fixed one, the individual shares in which must necessarily be\r\ndecreased by an increase in the number of laborers.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the current theory and the one I advance is, in\r\nfact, similar to that between the mercantile theory of international\r\nexchanges and that with which Adam Smith supplanted it. Between the\r\ntheory that commerce is the exchange of commodities for money, and the\r\ntheory that it is the exchange of commodities for commodities, there\r\nmay seem no real difference when it is remembered that the adherents\r\nof the mercantile theory did not assume that money had any other use\r\nthan as it could be exchanged for commodities. Yet, in the practical\r\napplication of these two theories, there arises all the difference\r\nbetween rigid governmental protection and free trade.\r\n\r\nIf I have said enough to show the reader the ultimate importance of\r\nthe reasoning through which I am about to ask him to follow me, it\r\nwill not be necessary to apologize in advance either for simplicity\r\nor prolixity. In arraigning a doctrine of such importance—a doctrine\r\nsupported by such a weight of authority, it is necessary to be both\r\nclear and thorough.\r\n\r\nWere it not for this I should be tempted to dismiss with a sentence\r\nthe assumption that wages are drawn from capital. For all the vast\r\nsuperstructure which the current political economy builds upon this\r\ndoctrine is in truth based upon a foundation which has been merely\r\ntaken for granted, without the slightest attempt to distinguish the\r\napparent from the real. Because wages are generally paid in money, and\r\nin many of the operations of production are paid before the product\r\nis fully completed, or can be utilized, it is inferred that wages are\r\ndrawn from pre-existing capital, and, therefore, that industry is\r\nlimited by capital—that is to say that labor cannot be employed until\r\ncapital has been accumulated, and can only be employed to the extent\r\nthat capital has been accumulated.\r\n\r\nYet in the very treatises in which the limitation of industry by\r\ncapital is laid down without reservation and made the basis for the\r\nmost important reasonings and elaborate theories, we are told that\r\ncapital is stored-up or accumulated labor—“that part of wealth which\r\nis saved to assist future production.” If we substitute for the word\r\n“capital” this definition of the word, the proposition carries its own\r\nrefutation, for that labor cannot be employed until the results of\r\nlabor are saved becomes too absurd for discussion.\r\n\r\nShould we, however, with this _reductio ad absurdum_, attempt to\r\nclose the argument, we should probably be met with the explanation,\r\nnot that the first laborers were supplied by Providence with the\r\ncapital necessary to set them to work, but that the proposition merely\r\nrefers to a state of society in which production has become a complex\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nBut the fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must\r\nbe firmly grasped, and never let go, is that society in its most\r\nhighly developed form is but an elaboration of society in its rudest\r\nbeginnings, and that principles obvious in the simpler relations of\r\nmen are merely disguised and not abrogated or reversed by the more\r\nintricate relations that result from the division of labor and the\r\nuse of complex tools and methods. The steam grist mill, with its\r\ncomplicated machinery exhibiting every diversity of motion, is simply\r\nwhat the rude stone mortar dug up from an ancient river bed was in\r\nits day—an instrument for grinding corn. And every man engaged in it,\r\nwhether tossing wood into the furnace, running the engine, dressing\r\nstones, printing sacks or keeping books, is really devoting his labor\r\nto the same purpose that the pre-historic savage did when he used his\r\nmortar—the preparation of grain for human food.\r\n\r\nAnd so, if we reduce to their lowest terms all the complex operations\r\nof modern production, we see that each individual who takes part in\r\nthis infinitely subdivided and intricate network of production and\r\nexchange is really doing what the primeval man did when he climbed the\r\ntrees for fruit or followed the receding tide for shellfish—endeavoring\r\nto obtain from nature by the exertion of his powers the satisfaction of\r\nhis desires. If we keep this firmly in mind, if we look upon production\r\nas a whole—as the co-operation of all embraced in any of its great\r\ngroups to satisfy the various desires of each, we plainly see that the\r\nreward each obtains for his exertions comes as truly and as directly\r\nfrom nature as the result of that exertion, as did that of the first\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: In the simplest state of which we can conceive, each\r\nman digs his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantages of the\r\ndivision of labor soon become apparent, and one digs bait while the\r\nothers fish. Yet evidently the one who digs bait is in reality doing\r\nas much toward the catching of fish as any of those who actually take\r\nthe fish. So when the advantages of canoes are discovered, and instead\r\nof all going a-fishing, one stays behind and makes and repairs canoes,\r\nthe canoe-maker is in reality devoting his labor to the taking of fish\r\nas much as the actual fishermen, and the fish which he eats at night\r\nwhen the fishermen come home are as truly the product of his labor as\r\nof theirs. And thus when the division of labor is fairly inaugurated,\r\nand instead of each attempting to satisfy all of his wants by direct\r\nresort to nature, one fishes, another hunts, a third picks berries, a\r\nfourth gathers fruit, a fifth makes tools, a sixth builds huts, and a\r\nseventh prepares clothing—each one is to the extent he exchanges the\r\ndirect product of his own labor for the direct product of the labor of\r\nothers really applying his own labor to the production of the things he\r\nuses—is in effect satisfying his particular desires by the exertion of\r\nhis particular powers; that is to say, what he receives he in reality\r\nproduces. If he digs roots and exchanges them for venison, he is in\r\neffect as truly the procurer of the venison as though he had gone in\r\nchase of the deer and left the huntsman to dig his own roots. The\r\ncommon expression, “I made so and so,” signifying “I earned so and so,”\r\nor “I earned money with which I purchased so and so,” is, economically\r\nspeaking, not metaphorically but literally true. Earning is making.\r\n\r\nNow, if we follow these principles, obvious enough in a simpler state\r\nof society, through the complexities of the state we call civilized,\r\nwe shall see clearly that in every case in which labor is exchanged\r\nfor commodities, production really precedes enjoyment; that wages are\r\nthe earnings—that is to say, the makings of labor—not the advances of\r\ncapital, and that the laborer who receives his wages in money (coined\r\nor printed, it may be, before his labor commenced) really receives in\r\nreturn for the addition his labor has made to the general stock of\r\nwealth, a draft upon that general stock, which he may utilize in any\r\nparticular form of wealth that will best satisfy his desires; and that\r\nneither the money, which is but the draft, nor the particular form of\r\nwealth which he uses it to call for, represents advances of capital\r\nfor his maintenance, but on the contrary represents the wealth, or\r\na portion of the wealth, his labor has already added to the general\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nKeeping these principles in view we see that the draughtsman, who, shut\r\nup in some dingy office on the banks of the Thames, is drawing the\r\nplans for a great marine engine, is in reality devoting his labor to\r\nthe production of bread and meat as truly as though he were garnering\r\nthe grain in California or swinging a lariat on a La Plata pampa; that\r\nhe is as truly making his own clothing as though he were shearing sheep\r\nin Australia or weaving cloth in Paisley, and just as effectually\r\nproducing the claret he drinks at dinner as though he gathered the\r\ngrapes on the banks of the Garonne. The miner who, two thousand feet\r\nunder ground in the heart of the Comstock, is digging out silver ore,\r\nis, in effect, by virtue of a thousand exchanges, harvesting crops in\r\nvalleys five thousand feet nearer the earth’s center; chasing the whale\r\nthrough Arctic icefields; plucking tobacco leaves in Virginia; picking\r\ncoffee berries in Honduras; cutting sugar cane on the Hawaiian Islands;\r\ngathering cotton in Georgia or weaving it in Manchester or Lowell;\r\nmaking quaint wooden toys for his children in the Hartz Mountains; or\r\nplucking amid the green and gold of Los Angeles orchards the oranges\r\nwhich, when his shift is relieved, he will take home to his sick\r\nwife. The wages which he receives on Saturday night at the mouth of\r\nthe shaft, what are they but the certificate to all the world that he\r\nhas done these things—the primary exchange in the long series which\r\ntransmutes his labor into the things he has really been laboring for?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this is clear when looked at in this way; but to meet this\r\nfallacy in all its strongholds and lurking places we must change our\r\ninvestigation from the deductive to the inductive form. Let us now\r\nsee, if, beginning with facts and tracing their relations, we arrive\r\nat the same conclusions as are thus obvious when, beginning with first\r\nprinciples, we trace their exemplification in complex facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It is true that the poorest may now in certain ways enjoy what\r\nthe richest a century ago could not have commanded, but this does not\r\nshow improvement of condition so long as the ability to obtain the\r\nnecessaries of life is not increased. The beggar in a great city may\r\nenjoy many things from which the backwoods farmer is debarred, but that\r\ndoes not prove the condition of the city beggar better than that of the\r\nindependent farmer.\r\n\r\n[2] This seems to me true of Mr. Thornton’s objections, for while he\r\ndenies the existence of a predetermined wage fund, consisting of a\r\nportion of capital set apart for the purchase of labor, he yet holds\r\n(which is the essential thing) that wages are drawn from capital, and\r\nthat increase or decrease of capital is increase or decrease of the\r\nfund available for the payment of wages. The most vital attack upon\r\nthe wage fund doctrine of which I know is that of Professor Francis A.\r\nWalker (The Wages Question: New York, 1876), yet he admits that wages\r\nare in large part advanced from capital—which, so far as it goes,\r\nis all that the stanchest supporter of the wage fund theory could\r\nclaim—while he fully accepts the Malthusian theory. Thus his practical\r\nconclusions in nowise differ from those reached by expounders of the\r\ncurrent theory.\r\n\r\n[3] Some Leading Principles of Political Economy Newly Expounded,\r\nChapter 1, Part 2.\r\n\r\n[4] Times of commercial panic are marked by high rates of discount, but\r\nthis is evidently not a high rate of interest, properly so-called, but\r\na high rate of insurance against risk.\r\n\r\n[5] For instance McCulloch (Note VI to Wealth of Nations) says: “That\r\nportion of the capital or wealth of a country which the employers of\r\nlabor intend to or are willing to pay out in the purchase of labor,\r\nmay be much larger at one time than another. But whatever may be its\r\nabsolute magnitude, it obviously forms the only source from which any\r\nportion of the wages of labor can be derived. No other fund is in\r\nexistence from which the laborer, as such, can draw a single shilling.\r\nAnd hence _it follows_ that the average rate of wages, or the share of\r\nthe national capital appropriated to the employment of labor falling,\r\nat an average, to each laborer, must entirely depend on its amount as\r\ncompared with the number of those amongst whom it has to be divided.”\r\nSimilar citations might be made from all the standard economists.\r\n\r\n[6] We are speaking of labor expended in production, to which it is\r\nbest for the sake of simplicity to confine the inquiry. Any question\r\nwhich may arise in the reader’s mind as to wages for unproductive\r\nservices had best therefore be deferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF THE TERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further in our inquiry, let us make sure of the\r\nmeaning of our terms, for indistinctness in their use must inevitably\r\nproduce ambiguity and indeterminateness in reasoning. Not only is it\r\nrequisite in economic reasoning to give to such words as “wealth,”\r\n“capital,” “rent,” “wages,” and the like, a much more definite sense\r\nthan they bear in common discourse, but, unfortunately, even in\r\npolitical economy there is, as to some of these terms, no certain\r\nmeaning assigned by common consent, different writers giving to the\r\nsame term different meanings, and the same writers often using a term\r\nin different senses. Nothing can add to the force of what has been\r\nsaid by so many eminent authors as to the importance of clear and\r\nprecise definitions, save the example, not an infrequent one, of the\r\nsame authors falling into grave errors from the very cause they warned\r\nagainst. And nothing so shows the importance of language in thought as\r\nthe spectacle of even acute thinkers basing important conclusions upon\r\nthe use of the same word in varying senses. I shall endeavor to avoid\r\nthese dangers. It will be my effort throughout, as any term becomes of\r\nimportance, to state clearly what I mean by it, and to use it in that\r\nsense and in no other. Let me ask the reader to note and to bear in\r\nmind the definitions thus given, as otherwise I cannot hope to make\r\nmyself properly understood. I shall not attempt to attach arbitrary\r\nmeanings to words, or to coin terms, even when it would be convenient\r\nto do so, but shall conform to usage as closely as is possible, only\r\nendeavoring so to fix the meaning of words that they may clearly\r\nexpress thought.\r\n\r\nWhat we have now on hand is to discover whether, as a matter of fact,\r\nwages are drawn from capital. As a preliminary, let us settle what\r\nwe mean by wages and what we mean by capital. To the former word a\r\nsufficiently definite meaning has been given by economic writers,\r\nbut the ambiguities which have attached to the use of the latter in\r\npolitical economy will require a detailed examination.\r\n\r\nAs used in common discourse “wages” means a compensation paid to a\r\nhired person for his services; and we speak of one man “working for\r\nwages,” in contradistinction to another who is “working for himself.”\r\nThe use of the term is still further narrowed by the habit of applying\r\nit solely to compensation paid for manual labor. We do not speak of\r\nthe wages of professional men, managers or clerks, but of their fees,\r\ncommissions, or salaries. Thus the common meaning of the word wages\r\nis the compensation paid to a hired person for manual labor. But in\r\npolitical economy the word wages has a much wider meaning, and includes\r\nall returns for exertion. For, as political economists explain, the\r\nthree agents or factors in production are land, labor, and capital, and\r\nthat part of the produce which goes to the second of these factors is\r\nby them styled wages.\r\n\r\nThus the term labor includes all human exertion in the production of\r\nwealth, and wages, being that part of the produce which goes to labor,\r\nincludes all reward for such exertion. There is, therefore, in the\r\npolitico-economic sense of the term wages no distinction as to the kind\r\nof labor, or as to whether its reward is received through an employer\r\nor not, but wages means the return received for the exertion of labor,\r\nas distinguished from the return received for the use of capital, and\r\nthe return received by the landholder for the use of land. The man who\r\ncultivates the soil for himself receives his wages in its produce,\r\njust as, if he uses his own capital and owns his own land, he may also\r\nreceive interest and rent; the hunter’s wages are the game he kills;\r\nthe fisherman’s wages are the fish he takes. The gold washed out by\r\nthe self-employing gold-digger is as much his wages as the money paid\r\nto the hired coal miner by the purchaser of his labor,[7] and, as Adam\r\nSmith shows, the high profits of retail storekeepers are in large part\r\nwages, being the recompense of their labor and not of their capital.\r\nIn short, whatever is received as the result or reward of exertion is\r\n“wages.”\r\n\r\nThis is all it is now necessary to note as to “wages,” but it is\r\nimportant to keep this in mind. For in the standard economic works this\r\nsense of the term wages is recognized with greater or less clearness\r\nonly to be subsequently ignored.\r\n\r\nBut it is more difficult to clear away from the idea of capital the\r\nambiguities that beset it, and to fix the scientific use of the\r\nterm. In general discourse, all sorts of things that have a value or\r\nwill yield a return are vaguely spoken of as capital, while economic\r\nwriters vary so widely that the term can hardly be said to have a\r\nfixed meaning. Let us compare with each other the definitions of a few\r\nrepresentative writers:\r\n\r\n“That part of a man’s stock,” says Adam Smith (Book II, Chap. I),\r\n“which he expects to afford him a revenue, is called his capital,”\r\nand the capital of a country or society, he goes on to say, consists\r\nof (1) machines and instruments of trade which facilitate and abridge\r\nlabor; (2) buildings, not mere dwellings, but which may be considered\r\ninstruments of trade—such as shops, farmhouses, etc.; (3) improvements\r\nof land which better fit it for tillage or culture; (4) the acquired\r\nand useful abilities of all the inhabitants; (5) money; (6) provisions\r\nin the hands of producers and dealers, from the sale of which they\r\nexpect to derive a profit; (7) the material of, or partially completed,\r\nmanufactured articles still in the hands of producers or dealers;\r\n(8) completed articles still in the hands of producers or dealers.\r\nThe first four of these he styles fixed capital, and the last four\r\ncirculating capital, a distinction of which it is not necessary to our\r\npurpose to take any note.\r\n\r\nRicardo’s definition is:\r\n\r\n “Capital is that part of the wealth of a country which is employed\r\n in production, and consists of food, clothing, tools, raw materials,\r\n machinery, etc., necessary to give effect to labor.”—_Principles of\r\n Political Economy, Chapter V._\r\n\r\nThis definition, it will be seen, is very different from that of\r\nAdam Smith, as it excludes many of the things which he includes—as\r\nacquired talents, articles of mere taste or luxury in the possession\r\nof producers or dealers; and includes some things he excludes—such as\r\nfood, clothing, etc., in the possession of the consumer.\r\n\r\nMcCulloch’s definition is:\r\n\r\n “The capital of a nation really comprises all those portions of the\r\n produce of industry existing in it that _may be_ directly employed\r\n either to support human existence or to facilitate production.”—_Notes\r\n on Wealth of Nations, Book II, Chap. I._\r\n\r\nThis definition follows the line of Ricardo’s, but is wider. While\r\nit excludes everything that is not capable of aiding production, it\r\nincludes everything that is so capable, without reference to actual\r\nuse or necessity for use—the horse drawing a pleasure carriage being,\r\naccording to McCulloch’s view, as he expressly states, as much capital\r\nas the horse drawing a plow, because he may, if need arises, be used to\r\ndraw a plow.\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, following the same general line as Ricardo and\r\nMcCulloch, makes neither the use nor the capability of use, but the\r\ndetermination to use, the test of capital. He says:\r\n\r\n “Whatever things are destined to supply productive labor with the\r\n shelter, protection, tools and materials which the work requires, and\r\n to feed and otherwise maintain the laborer during the process, are\r\n capital.”—_Principles of Political Economy, Book I, Chap. IV._\r\n\r\nThese quotations sufficiently illustrate the divergence of the masters.\r\nAmong minor authors the variance is still greater, as a few examples\r\nwill suffice to show.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wayland, whose “Elements of Political Economy” has long been\r\na favorite text-book in American educational institutions, where there\r\nhas been any pretense of teaching political economy, gives this lucid\r\ndefinition:\r\n\r\n “The word capital is used in two senses. In relation to product it\r\n means any substance on which industry is to be exerted. In relation\r\n to industry, the material on which industry is about to confer value,\r\n that on which it has conferred value; the instruments which are used\r\n for the conferring of value, as well as the means of sustenance by\r\n which the being is supported while he is engaged in performing the\r\n operation.”—_Elements of Political Economy, Book I, Chap. I._\r\n\r\nHenry C. Carey, the American apostle of protectionism, defines capital\r\nas “the instrument by which man obtains mastery over nature, including\r\nin it the physical and mental powers of man himself.” Professor Perry,\r\na Massachusetts free trader, very properly objects to this that it\r\nhopelessly confuses the boundaries between capital and labor, and then\r\nhimself hopelessly confuses the boundaries between capital and land\r\nby defining capital as “any valuable thing outside of man himself\r\nfrom whose use springs a pecuniary increase or profit.” An English\r\neconomic writer of high standing, Mr. Wm. Thornton, begins an elaborate\r\nexamination of the relations of labor and capital (“On Labor”) by\r\nstating that he will include land with capital, which is very much as\r\nif one who proposed to teach algebra should begin with the declaration\r\nthat he would consider the signs plus and minus as meaning the same\r\nthing and having the same value. An American writer, also of high\r\nstanding, Professor Francis A. Walker, makes the same declaration in\r\nhis elaborate book on “The Wages Question.” Another English writer,\r\nN. A. Nicholson (“The Science of Exchanges,” London, 1873), seems to\r\ncap the climax of absurdity by declaring in one paragraph (p. 26) that\r\n“capital must of course be accumulated by saving,” and in the very next\r\nparagraph stating that “the land which produces a crop, the plow which\r\nturns the soil, the labor which secures the produce, and the produce\r\nitself, if a material profit is to be derived from its employment,\r\nare all alike capital.” But how land and labor are to be accumulated\r\nby saving them he nowhere condescends to explain. In the same way a\r\nstandard American writer, Professor Amasa Walker (p. 66, “Science of\r\nWealth”), first declares that capital arises from the net savings of\r\nlabor and then immediately afterward declares that land is capital.\r\n\r\nI might go on for pages, citing contradictory and self-contradictory\r\ndefinitions. But it would only weary the reader. It is unnecessary\r\nto multiply quotations. Those already given are sufficient to show\r\nhow wide a difference exists as to the comprehension of the term\r\ncapital. Any one who wants further illustration of the “confusion\r\nworse confounded” which exists on this subject among the professors of\r\npolitical economy may find it in any library where the works of these\r\nprofessors are ranged side by side.\r\n\r\nNow, it makes little difference what name we give to things, if when\r\nwe use the name we always keep in view the same things and no others.\r\nBut the difficulty arising in economic reasoning from these vague and\r\nvarying definitions of capital is that it is only in the premises of\r\nreasoning that the term is used in the peculiar sense assigned by the\r\ndefinition, while in the practical conclusions that are reached it is\r\nalways used, or at least it is always understood, in one general and\r\ndefinite sense. When, for instance, it is said that wages are drawn\r\nfrom capital, the word capital is understood in the same sense as when\r\nwe speak of the scarcity or abundance, the increase or decrease, the\r\ndestruction or increment, of capital—a commonly understood and definite\r\nsense which separates capital from the other factors of production,\r\nland and labor, and also separates it from like things used merely for\r\ngratification. In fact, most people understand well enough what capital\r\nis until they begin to define it, and I think their works will show\r\nthat the economic writers who differ so widely in their definitions use\r\nthe term in this commonly understood sense in all cases except in their\r\ndefinitions and the reasoning based on them.\r\n\r\nThis common sense of the term is that of wealth devoted to procuring\r\nmore wealth. Dr. Adam Smith correctly expresses this common idea\r\nwhen he says: “That part of a man’s stock which he expects to afford\r\nhim revenue is called his capital.” And the capital of a community\r\nis evidently the sum of such individual stocks, or that part of the\r\naggregate stock which is expected to procure more wealth. This also is\r\nthe derivative sense of the term. The word capital, as philologists\r\ntrace it, comes down to us from a time when wealth was estimated in\r\ncattle, and a man’s income depended upon the number of head he could\r\nkeep for their increase.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which beset the use of the word capital, as an exact\r\nterm, and which are even more strikingly exemplified in current\r\npolitical and social discussions than in the definitions of economic\r\nwriters, arise from two facts—first, that certain classes of things,\r\nthe possession of which to the individual is precisely equivalent\r\nto the possession of capital, are not part of the capital of the\r\ncommunity; and, second, that things of the same kind may or may not be\r\ncapital, according to the purpose to which they are devoted.\r\n\r\nWith a little care as to these points, there should be no difficulty in\r\nobtaining a sufficiently clear and fixed idea of what the term capital\r\nas generally used properly includes; such an idea as will enable us\r\nto say what things are capital and what are not, and to use the word\r\nwithout ambiguity or slip.\r\n\r\nLand, labor, and capital are the three factors of production. If we\r\nremember that capital is thus a term used in contradistinction to\r\nland and labor, we at once see that nothing properly included under\r\neither one of these terms can be properly classed as capital. The\r\nterm land necessarily includes, not merely the surface of the earth\r\nas distinguished from the water and the air, but the whole material\r\nuniverse outside of man himself, for it is only by having access to\r\nland, from which his very body is drawn, that man can come in contact\r\nwith or use nature. The term land embraces, in short, all natural\r\nmaterials, forces, and opportunities, and, therefore, nothing that is\r\nfreely supplied by nature can be properly classed as capital. A fertile\r\nfield, a rich vein of ore, a falling stream which supplies power,\r\nmay give to the possessor advantages equivalent to the possession of\r\ncapital, but to class such things as capital would be to put an end to\r\nthe distinction between land and capital, and, so far as they relate to\r\neach other, to make the two terms meaningless. The term labor, in like\r\nmanner, includes all human exertion, and hence human powers whether\r\nnatural or acquired can never properly be classed as capital. In common\r\nparlance we often speak of a man’s knowledge, skill, or industry as\r\nconstituting his capital; but this is evidently a metaphorical use of\r\nlanguage that must be eschewed in reasoning that aims at exactness.\r\nSuperiority in such qualities may augment the income of an individual\r\njust as capital would, and an increase in the knowledge, skill, or\r\nindustry of a community may have the same effect in increasing its\r\nproduction as would an increase of capital; but this effect is due to\r\nthe increased power of labor and not to capital. Increased velocity\r\nmay give to the impact of a cannon ball the same effect as increased\r\nweight, yet, nevertheless, weight is one thing and velocity another.\r\n\r\nThus we must exclude from the category of capital everything that\r\nmay be included either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only\r\nthings which are neither land nor labor, but which have resulted from\r\nthe union of these two original factors of production. Nothing can be\r\nproperly capital that does not consist of these—that is to say, nothing\r\ncan be capital that is not wealth.\r\n\r\nBut it is from ambiguities in the use of this inclusive term wealth\r\nthat many of the ambiguities which beset the term capital are derived.\r\n\r\nAs commonly used the word “wealth” is applied to anything having an\r\nexchange value. But when used as a term of political economy it must\r\nbe limited to a much more definite meaning, because many things are\r\ncommonly spoken of as wealth which in taking account of collective or\r\ngeneral wealth cannot be considered as wealth at all. Such things have\r\nan exchange value, and are commonly spoken of as wealth, insomuch as\r\nthey represent as between individuals, or between sets of individuals,\r\nthe power of obtaining wealth; but they are not truly wealth, inasmuch\r\nas their increase or decrease does not affect the sum of wealth.\r\nSuch are bonds, mortgages, promissory notes, bank bills, or other\r\nstipulations for the transfer of wealth. Such are slaves, whose value\r\nrepresents merely the power of one class to appropriate the earnings\r\nof another class. Such are lands, or other natural opportunities,\r\nthe value of which is but the result of the acknowledgment in favor\r\nof certain persons of an exclusive right to their use, and which\r\nrepresents merely the power thus given to the owners to demand a share\r\nof the wealth produced by those who use them. Increase in the amount of\r\nbonds, mortgages, notes, or bank bills cannot increase the wealth of\r\nthe community that includes as well those who promise to pay as those\r\nwho are entitled to receive. The enslavement of a part of their number\r\ncould not increase the wealth of a people, for what the enslavers\r\ngained the enslaved would lose. Increase in land values does not\r\nrepresent increase in the common wealth, for what land owners gain by\r\nhigher prices, the tenants or purchasers who must pay them will lose.\r\nAnd all this relative wealth, which, in common thought and speech, in\r\nlegislation and law, is undistinguished from actual wealth, could,\r\nwithout the destruction or consumption of anything more than a few\r\ndrops of ink and a piece of paper, be utterly annihilated. By enactment\r\nof the sovereign political power debts might be canceled, slaves\r\nemancipated, and land resumed as the common property of the whole\r\npeople, without the aggregate wealth being diminished by the value of a\r\npinch of snuff, for what some would lose others would gain. There would\r\nbe no more destruction of wealth than there was creation of wealth\r\nwhen Elizabeth Tudor enriched her favorite courtiers by the grant of\r\nmonopolies, or when Boris Godoonof made Russian peasants merchantable\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAll things which have an exchange value are, therefore, not wealth, in\r\nthe only sense in which the term can be used in political economy. Only\r\nsuch things can be wealth the production of which increases and the\r\ndestruction of which decreases the aggregate of wealth. If we consider\r\nwhat these things are, and what their nature is, we shall have no\r\ndifficulty in defining wealth.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of a community increasing in wealth—as when we say that\r\nEngland has increased in wealth since the accession of Victoria, or\r\nthat California is a wealthier country than when it was a Mexican\r\nterritory—we do not mean to say that there is more land, or that\r\nthe natural powers of the land are greater, or that there are more\r\npeople, for when we wish to express that idea we speak of increase of\r\npopulation; or that the debts or dues owing by some of these people\r\nto others of their number have increased; but we mean that there is\r\nan increase of certain tangible things, having an actual and not\r\nmerely a relative value—such as buildings, cattle, tools, machinery,\r\nagricultural and mineral products, manufactured goods, ships, wagons,\r\nfurniture, and the like. The increase of such things constitutes an\r\nincrease of wealth; their decrease is a lessening of wealth; and the\r\ncommunity that, in proportion to its numbers, has most of such things\r\nis the wealthiest community. The common character of these things is\r\nthat they consist of natural substances or products which have been\r\nadapted by human labor to human use or gratification, their value\r\ndepending on the amount of labor which upon the average would be\r\nrequired to produce things of like kind.\r\n\r\nThus wealth, as alone the term can be used in political economy,\r\nconsists of natural products that have been secured, moved, combined,\r\nseparated, or in other ways modified by human exertion, so as to fit\r\nthem for the gratification of human desires. It is, in other words,\r\nlabor impressed upon matter in such a way as to store up, as the heat\r\nof the sun is stored up in coal, the power of human labor to minister\r\nto human desires. Wealth is not the sole object of labor, for labor is\r\nalso expended in ministering directly to desire; but it is the object\r\nand result of what we call productive labor—that is, labor which gives\r\nvalue to material things. Nothing which nature supplies to man without\r\nhis labor is wealth, nor yet does the expenditure of labor result in\r\nwealth unless there is a tangible product which has and retains the\r\npower of ministering to desire.\r\n\r\nNow, as capital is wealth devoted to a certain purpose, nothing can\r\nbe capital which does not fall within this definition of wealth. By\r\nrecognizing and keeping this in mind, we get rid of misconceptions\r\nwhich vitiate all reasoning in which they are permitted, which befog\r\npopular thought, and have led into mazes of contradiction even acute\r\nthinkers.\r\n\r\nBut though all capital is wealth, all wealth is not capital. Capital is\r\nonly a part of wealth—that part, namely, which is devoted to the aid of\r\nproduction. It is in drawing this line between the wealth that is and\r\nthe wealth that is not capital that a second class of misconceptions\r\nare likely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe errors which I have been pointing out, and which consist in\r\nconfounding with wealth and capital things essentially distinct, or\r\nwhich have but a relative existence, are now merely vulgar errors.\r\nThey are widespread, it is true, and have a deep root, being held,\r\nnot merely by the less educated classes, but seemingly by a large\r\nmajority of those who in such advanced countries as England and\r\nthe United States mold and guide public opinion, make the laws in\r\nParliaments, Congresses and Legislatures, and administer them in the\r\ncourts. They crop out, moreover, in the disquisitions of many of those\r\nflabby writers who have burdened the press and darkened counsel by\r\nnumerous volumes which are dubbed political economy, and which pass\r\nas text-books with the ignorant and as authority with those who do\r\nnot think for themselves. Nevertheless, they are only vulgar errors,\r\ninasmuch as they receive no countenance from the best writers on\r\npolitical economy. By one of those lapses which flaw his great work\r\nand strikingly evince the imperfections of the highest talent, Adam\r\nSmith counts as capital certain personal qualities, an inclusion which\r\nis not consistent with his original definition of capital as stock\r\nfrom which revenue is expected. But this error has been avoided by his\r\nmost eminent successors, and in the definitions, previously given, of\r\nRicardo, McCulloch, and Mill, it is not involved. Neither in their\r\ndefinitions nor in that of Smith is involved the vulgar error which\r\nconfounds as real capital things which are only relatively capital,\r\nsuch as evidences of debt, land values, etc. But as to things which are\r\nreally wealth, their definitions differ from each other, and widely\r\nfrom that of Smith, as to what is and what is not to be considered\r\nas capital. The stock of a jeweler would, for instance, be included\r\nas capital by the definition of Smith, and the food or clothing in\r\npossession of a laborer would be excluded. But the definitions of\r\nRicardo and McCulloch would exclude the stock of the jeweler, as would\r\nalso that of Mill, if understood as most persons would understand the\r\nwords I have quoted. But as explained by him, it is neither the nature\r\nnor the destination of the things themselves which determines whether\r\nthey are or are not capital, but the intention of the owner to devote\r\neither the things or the value received from their sale to the supply\r\nof productive labor with tools, materials, and maintenance. All these\r\ndefinitions, however, agree in including as capital the provisions and\r\nclothing of the laborer, which Smith excludes.\r\n\r\nLet us consider these three definitions, which represent the best\r\nteachings of current political economy:\r\n\r\nTo McCulloch’s definition of capital as “all those portions of the\r\nproduce of industry that may be directly employed either to support\r\nhuman existence or to facilitate production,” there are obvious\r\nobjections. One may pass along any principal street in a thriving town\r\nor city and see stores filled with all sorts of valuable things, which,\r\nthough they cannot be employed either to support human existence or to\r\nfacilitate production, undoubtedly constitute part of the capital of\r\nthe storekeepers and part of the capital of the community. And he can\r\nalso see products of industry capable of supporting human existence\r\nor facilitating production being consumed in ostentation or useless\r\nluxury. Surely these, though they might, _do not_ constitute part of\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nRicardo’s definition avoids including as capital things which might\r\nbe but are not employed in production, by covering only such as are\r\nemployed. But it is open to the first objection made to McCulloch’s. If\r\nonly wealth that may be, or that is, or that is destined to be, used\r\nin supporting producers, or assisting production, is capital, then the\r\nstocks of jewelers, toy dealers, tobacconists, confectioners, picture\r\ndealers, etc.—in fact, all stocks that consist of, and all stocks in so\r\nfar as they consist of articles of luxury, are not capital.\r\n\r\nIf Mill, by remitting the distinction to the mind of the capitalist,\r\navoids this difficulty (which does not seem to me clear), it is by\r\nmaking the distinction so vague that no power short of omniscience\r\ncould tell in any given country at any given time what was and what was\r\nnot capital.\r\n\r\nBut the great defect which these definitions have in common is\r\nthat they include what clearly cannot be accounted capital, if any\r\ndistinction is to be made between laborer and capitalist. For they\r\nbring into the category of capital the food, clothing, etc., in the\r\npossession of the day laborer, which he will consume whether he works\r\nor not, as well as the stock in the hands of the capitalist, with which\r\nhe proposes to pay the laborer for his work.\r\n\r\nYet, manifestly, this is not the sense in which the term capital is\r\nused by these writers when they speak of labor and capital as taking\r\nseparate parts in the work of production and separate shares in the\r\ndistribution of its proceeds; when they speak of wages as drawn from\r\ncapital, or as depending upon the ratio between labor and capital, or\r\nin any of the ways in which the term is generally used by them. In\r\nall these cases the term capital is used in its commonly understood\r\nsense, as that portion of wealth which its owners do not propose to use\r\ndirectly for their own gratification, but for the purpose of obtaining\r\nmore wealth. In short, by political economists, in everything except\r\ntheir definitions and first principles, as well as by the world at\r\nlarge, “that part of a man’s stock,” to use the words of Adam Smith,\r\n“which he expects to afford him revenue is called his capital.” This is\r\nthe only sense in which the term capital expresses any fixed idea—the\r\nonly sense in which we can with any clearness separate it from wealth\r\nand contrast it with labor. For, if we must consider as capital\r\neverything which supplies the laborer with food, clothing, shelter,\r\netc., then to find a laborer who is not a capitalist we shall be forced\r\nto hunt up an absolutely naked man, destitute even of a sharpened\r\nstick, or of a burrow in the ground—a situation in which, save as the\r\nresult of exceptional circumstances, human beings have never yet been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the variance and inexactitude in these definitions\r\narise from the fact that the idea of what capital is has been deduced\r\nfrom a preconceived idea of how capital assists production. Instead of\r\ndetermining what capital is, and then observing what capital does, the\r\nfunctions of capital have first been assumed, and then a definition of\r\ncapital made which includes all things which do or may perform those\r\nfunctions. Let us reverse this process, and, adopting the natural\r\norder, ascertain what the thing is before settling what it does. All\r\nwe are trying to do, all that it is necessary to do, is to fix, as\r\nit were, the metes and bounds of a term that in the main is well\r\napprehended—to make definite, that is, sharp and clear on its verges, a\r\ncommon idea.\r\n\r\nIf the articles of actual wealth existing at a given time in a given\r\ncommunity were presented _in situ_ to a dozen intelligent men who\r\nhad never read a line of political economy, it is doubtful if they\r\nwould differ in respect to a single item, as to whether it should be\r\naccounted capital or not. Money which its owner holds for use in his\r\nbusiness or in speculation would be accounted capital; money set aside\r\nfor household or personal expenses would not. That part of a farmer’s\r\ncrop held for sale or for seed, or to feed his help in part payment of\r\nwages, would be accounted capital; that held for the use of his own\r\nfamily would not be. The horses and carriage of a hackman would be\r\nclassed as capital, but an equipage kept for the pleasure of its owner\r\nwould not. So no one would think of counting as capital the false hair\r\non the head of a woman, the cigar in the mouth of a smoker, or the toy\r\nwith which a child is playing; but the stock of a hair dealer, of a\r\ntobacconist, or of the keeper of a toy store, would be unhesitatingly\r\nset down as capital. A coat which a tailor had made for sale would be\r\naccounted capital, but not the coat he had made for himself. Food in\r\nthe possession of a hotel-keeper or a restaurateur would be accounted\r\ncapital, but not the food in the pantry of a housewife, or in the lunch\r\nbasket of a workman. Pig iron in the hands of the smelter, or founder,\r\nor dealer, would be accounted capital, but not the pig iron used as\r\nballast in the hold of a yacht. The bellows of a blacksmith, the looms\r\nof a factory, would be capital, but not the sewing machine of a woman\r\nwho does only her own work; a building let for hire, or used for\r\nbusiness or productive purposes, but not a homestead. In short, I think\r\nwe should find that now, as when Dr. Adam Smith wrote, “that part of\r\na man’s stock which he expects to yield him a revenue is called his\r\ncapital.” And, omitting his unfortunate slip as to personal qualities,\r\nand qualifying somewhat his enumeration of money, it is doubtful if\r\nwe could better list the different articles of capital than did Adam\r\nSmith in the passage which in the previous part of this chapter I have\r\ncondensed.\r\n\r\nNow, if, after having thus separated the wealth that is capital from\r\nthe wealth that is not capital, we look for the distinction between\r\nthe two classes, we shall not find it to be as to the character,\r\ncapabilities, or final destination of the things themselves, as has\r\nbeen vainly attempted to draw it; but it seems to me that we shall\r\nfind it to be as to whether they are or are not in the possession of\r\nthe consumer.[8] Such articles of wealth as in themselves, in their\r\nuses, or in their products, are yet to be exchanged are capital;\r\nsuch articles of wealth as are in the hands of the consumer are not\r\ncapital. Hence, if we define capital as _wealth in course of exchange_,\r\nunderstanding exchange to include not merely the passing from hand to\r\nhand, but also such transmutations as occur when the reproductive or\r\ntransforming forces of nature are utilized for the increase of wealth,\r\nwe shall, I think, comprehend all the things that the general idea of\r\ncapital properly includes, and shut out all it does not. Under this\r\ndefinition, it seems to me, for instance, will fall all such tools as\r\nare really capital. For it is as to whether its services or uses are\r\nto be exchanged or not which makes a tool an article of capital or\r\nmerely an article of wealth. Thus, the lathe of a manufacturer used\r\nin making things which are to be exchanged is capital, while the lathe\r\nkept by a gentleman for his own amusement is not. Thus, wealth used\r\nin the construction of a railroad, a public telegraph line, a stage\r\ncoach, a theater, a hotel, etc., may be said to be placed in the course\r\nof exchange. The exchange is not effected all at once, but little by\r\nlittle, with an indefinite number of people. Yet there is an exchange,\r\nand the “consumers” of the railroad, the telegraph line, the stage\r\ncoach, theater or hotel, are not the owners, but the persons who from\r\ntime to time use them.\r\n\r\nNor is this definition inconsistent with the idea that capital is that\r\npart of wealth devoted to production. It is too narrow an understanding\r\nof production which confines it merely to the making of things.\r\nProduction includes not merely the making of things, but the bringing\r\nof them to the consumer. The merchant or storekeeper is thus as truly a\r\nproducer as is the manufacturer, or farmer, and his stock or capital is\r\nas much devoted to production as is theirs. But it is not worth while\r\nnow to dwell upon the functions of capital, which we shall be better\r\nable to determine hereafter. Nor is the definition of capital I have\r\nsuggested of any importance. I am not writing a text-book, but only\r\nattempting to discover the laws which control a great social problem,\r\nand if the reader has been led to form a clear idea of what things are\r\nmeant when we speak of capital my purpose is served.\r\n\r\nBut before closing this digression let me call attention to what is\r\noften forgotten—namely, that the terms “wealth,” “capital,” “wages,”\r\nand the like, as used in political economy are abstract terms, and\r\nthat nothing can be generally affirmed or denied of them that cannot\r\nbe affirmed or denied of the whole class of things they represent. The\r\nfailure to bear this in mind has led to much confusion of thought,\r\nand permits fallacies, otherwise transparent, to pass for obvious\r\ntruths. Wealth being an abstract term, the idea of wealth, it must be\r\nremembered, involves the idea of exchange ability. The possession of\r\nwealth to a certain amount is potentially the possession of any or all\r\nspecies of wealth to that equivalent in exchange. And, consequently, so\r\nof capital.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] This was recognized in common speech in California, where the\r\nplacer miners styled their earnings their “wages,” and spoke of making\r\nhigh wages or low wages according to the amount of gold taken out.\r\n\r\n[8] Money may be said to be in the hands of the consumer when devoted\r\nto the procurement of gratification, as, though not in itself devoted\r\nto consumption, it represents wealth which is; and thus what in the\r\nprevious paragraph I have given as the common classification would be\r\ncovered by this distinction, and would be substantially correct. In\r\nspeaking of money in this connection, I am of course speaking of coin,\r\nfor although paper money may perform all the functions of coin, it is\r\nnot wealth, and cannot therefore be capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWAGES NOT DRAWN FROM CAPITAL, BUT PRODUCED BY THE LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of this digression will, I think, become more and more\r\napparent as we proceed in our inquiry, but its pertinency to the branch\r\nwe are now engaged in may at once be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is at first glance evident that the economic meaning of the term\r\nwages is lost sight of, and attention is concentrated upon the common\r\nand narrow meaning of the word, when it is affirmed that wages are\r\ndrawn from capital. For, in all those cases in which the laborer is\r\nhis own employer and takes directly the produce of his labor as its\r\nreward, it is plain enough that wages are not drawn from capital, but\r\nresult directly as the product of the labor. If, for instance, I devote\r\nmy labor to gathering birds’ eggs or picking wild berries, the eggs or\r\nberries I thus get are my wages. Surely no one will contend that in\r\nsuch a case wages are drawn from capital. There is no capital in the\r\ncase. An absolutely naked man, thrown on an island where no human being\r\nhas before trod, may gather birds’ eggs or pick berries.\r\n\r\nOr if I take a piece of leather and work it up into a pair of shoes,\r\nthe shoes are my wages—the reward of my exertion. Surely they are not\r\ndrawn from capital—either my capital or any one else’s capital—but are\r\nbrought into existence by the labor of which they become the wages; and\r\nin obtaining this pair of shoes as the wages of my labor, capital is\r\nnot even momentarily lessened one iota. For, if we call in the idea of\r\ncapital, my capital at the beginning consists of the piece of leather,\r\nthe thread, etc. As my labor goes on, value is steadily added, until,\r\nwhen my labor results in the finished shoes, I have my capital plus the\r\ndifference in value between the material and the shoes. In obtaining\r\nthis additional value—my wages—how is capital at any time drawn upon?\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, who gave the direction to economic thought that has\r\nresulted in the current elaborate theories of the relation between\r\nwages and capital, recognized the fact that in such simple cases as I\r\nhave instanced, wages are the produce of labor, and thus begins his\r\nchapter upon the wages of labor (Chapter VIII):\r\n\r\n “_The produce of labor constitutes the natural recompense or wages\r\n of labor._ In that original state of things which precedes both the\r\n appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce\r\n of labor belongs to the laborer. He has neither landlord nor master to\r\n share with him.”\r\n\r\nHad the great Scotchman taken this as the initial point of his\r\nreasoning, and continued to regard the produce of labor as the natural\r\nwages of labor, and the landlord and master but as sharers, his\r\nconclusions would have been very different, and political economy\r\nto-day would not embrace such a mass of contradictions and absurdities;\r\nbut instead of following the truth obvious in the simple modes of\r\nproduction as a clew through the perplexities of the more complicated\r\nforms, he momentarily recognizes it, only immediately to abandon it,\r\nand stating that “in every part of Europe twenty workmen serve under a\r\nmaster for one that is independent,” he recommences the inquiry from a\r\npoint of view in which the master is considered as providing from his\r\ncapital the wages of his workmen.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in thus placing the proportion of self-employing\r\nworkmen as but one in twenty, Adam Smith had in mind but the mechanic\r\narts, and that, including all laborers, the proportion who take their\r\nearnings directly, without the intervention of an employer, must,\r\neven in Europe a hundred years ago, have been much greater than this.\r\nFor, besides the independent laborers who in every community exist in\r\nconsiderable numbers, the agriculture of large districts of Europe has,\r\nsince the time of the Roman Empire, been carried on by the metayer\r\nsystem, under which the capitalist receives his return from the laborer\r\ninstead of the laborer from the capitalist. At any rate, in the United\r\nStates, where any general law of wages must apply as fully as in\r\nEurope, and where in spite of the advance of manufactures a very large\r\npart of the people are yet self-employing farmers, the proportion of\r\nlaborers who get their wages through an employer must be comparatively\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to discuss the ratio in which self-employing\r\nlaborers anywhere stand to hired laborers, nor is it necessary to\r\nmultiply illustrations of the truism that where the laborer takes\r\ndirectly his wages they are the product of his labor, for as soon as\r\nit is realized that the term wages includes all the earnings of labor,\r\nas well when taken directly by the laborer in the results of his labor\r\nas when received from an employer, it is evident that the assumption\r\nthat wages are drawn from capital, on which as a universal truth such\r\na vast superstructure is in standard politico-economic treatises so\r\nunhesitatingly built, is at least in large part untrue, and the utmost\r\nthat can with any plausibility be affirmed, is that some wages, _i.e._\r\nwages received by the laborer from an employer, are drawn from capital.\r\nThis restriction of the major premise at once invalidates all the\r\ndeductions that are made from it; but without resting here, let us see\r\nwhether even in this restricted sense it accords with the facts. Let\r\nus pick up the clew where Adam Smith dropped it, and advancing step\r\nby step, see whether the relation of facts which is obvious in the\r\nsimplest forms of production does not run through the most complex.\r\n\r\nNext in simplicity to “that original state of things,” of which many\r\nexamples may yet be found, where the whole produce of labor belongs to\r\nthe laborer, is the arrangement in which the laborer, though working\r\nfor another person, or with the capital of another person, receives\r\nhis wages in kind—that is to say, in the things his labor produces. In\r\nthis case it is as clear as in the case of the self-employing laborer\r\nthat the wages are really drawn from the product of the labor, and not\r\nat all from capital. If I hire a man to gather eggs, to pick berries,\r\nor to make shoes, paying him from the eggs, the berries, or the shoes\r\nthat his labor secures, there can be no question that the source of\r\nthe wages is the labor for which they are paid. Of this form of hiring\r\nis the saer-and-daer stock tenancy, treated of with such perspicuity\r\nby Sir Henry Maine in his “Early History of Institutions,” and which\r\nso clearly involved the relation of employer and employed as to render\r\nthe acceptor of cattle the man or vassal of the capitalist who thus\r\nemployed him. It was on such terms as these that Jacob worked for\r\nLaban, and to this day, even in civilized countries, it is not an\r\ninfrequent mode of employing labor. The farming of land on shares,\r\nwhich prevails to a considerable extent in the Southern States of the\r\nUnion and in California, the metayer system of Europe, as well as the\r\nmany cases in which superintendents, salesmen, etc., are paid by a\r\npercentage of profits, what are they but the employment of labor for\r\nwages which consist of part of its produce?\r\n\r\nThe next step in the advance from simplicity to complexity is where the\r\nwages, though estimated in kind, are paid in an equivalent of something\r\nelse. For instance, on American whaling ships the custom is not to\r\npay fixed wages, but a “lay,” or proportion of the catch, which varies\r\nfrom a sixteenth to a twelfth to the captain down to a three-hundredth\r\nto the cabin-boy. Thus, when a whaleship comes into New Bedford or San\r\nFrancisco after a successful cruise, she carries in her hold the wages\r\nof her crew, as well as the profits of her owners, and an equivalent\r\nwhich will reimburse them for all the stores used up during the voyage.\r\nCan anything be clearer than that these wages—this oil and bone which\r\nthe crew of the whaler have taken—have not been drawn from capital,\r\nbut are really a part of the produce of their labor? Nor is this fact\r\nchanged or obscured in the slightest degree where, as a matter of\r\nconvenience, instead of dividing up between the crew their proportion\r\nof the oil and bone, the value of each man’s share is estimated at the\r\nmarket price, and he is paid for it in money. The money is but the\r\nequivalent of the real wages, the oil and bone. In no way is there any\r\nadvance of capital in this payment. The obligation to pay wages does\r\nnot accrue until the value from which they are to be paid is brought\r\ninto port. At the moment when the owner takes from his capital money to\r\npay the crew he adds to his capital oil and bone.\r\n\r\nSo far there can be no dispute. Let us now take another step, which\r\nwill bring us to the usual method of employing labor and paying wages.\r\n\r\nThe Farallone Islands, off the Bay of San Francisco, are a hatching\r\nground of sea-fowl, and a company who claim these islands employ men in\r\nthe proper season to collect the eggs. They might employ these men for\r\na proportion of the eggs they gather, as is done in the whale fishery\r\nand probably would do so if there were much uncertainty attending the\r\nbusiness; but as the fowl are plentiful and tame, and about so many\r\neggs can be gathered by so much labor, they find it more convenient to\r\npay their men fixed wages. The men go out and remain on the islands,\r\ngathering the eggs and bringing them to a landing, whence, at intervals\r\nof a few days, they are taken in a small vessel to San Francisco\r\nand sold. When the season is over the men return and are paid their\r\nstipulated wages in coin. Does not this transaction amount to the same\r\nthing as if, instead of being paid in coin, the stipulated wages were\r\npaid in an equivalent of the eggs gathered? Does not the coin represent\r\nthe eggs, by the sale of which it was obtained, and are not these\r\nwages as much the product of the labor for which they are paid as the\r\neggs would be in the possession of a man who gathered them for himself\r\nwithout the intervention of any employer?\r\n\r\nTo take another example, which shows by reversion the identity of wages\r\nin money with wages in kind. In San Buenaventura lives a man who makes\r\nan excellent living by shooting for their oil and skins the common hair\r\nseals which frequent the islands forming the Santa Barbara Channel.\r\nWhen on these sealing expeditions he takes two or three Chinamen along\r\nto help him, whom at first he paid wholly in coin. But it seems that\r\nthe Chinese highly value some of the organs of the seal, which they dry\r\nand pulverize for medicine, as well as the long hairs in the whiskers\r\nof the male seal, which, when over a certain length, they greatly\r\nesteem for some purpose that to outside barbarians is not very clear.\r\nAnd this man soon found that the Chinamen were very willing to take\r\ninstead of money these parts of the seals killed, so that now, in large\r\npart, he thus pays them their wages.\r\n\r\nNow, is not what may be seen in all these cases—the identity of wages\r\nin money with wages in kind—true of all cases in which wages are paid\r\nfor productive labor? Is not the fund created by the labor really the\r\nfund from which the wages are paid?\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be said: “There is this difference— where a man works\r\nfor himself, or where, when working for an employer, he takes his\r\nwages in kind, his wages depend upon the result of his labor. Should\r\nthat, from any misadventure, prove futile, he gets nothing. When he\r\nworks for an employer, however, he gets his wages anyhow—they depend\r\nupon the performance of the labor, not upon the result of the labor.”\r\nBut this is evidently not a real distinction. For on the average, the\r\nlabor that is rendered for fixed wages not only yields the amount of\r\nthe wages, but more; else employers could make no profit. When wages\r\nare fixed, the employer takes the whole risk and is compensated for\r\nthis assurance, for wages when fixed are always somewhat less than\r\nwages contingent. But though when fixed wages are stipulated the\r\nlaborer who has performed his part of the contract has usually a\r\nlegal claim upon the employer, it is frequently, if not generally,\r\nthe case that the disaster which prevents the employer from reaping\r\nbenefit from the labor prevents him from paying the wages. And in one\r\nimportant department of industry the employer is legally exempt in\r\ncase of disaster, although the contract be for wages certain and not\r\ncontingent. For the maxim of admiralty law is, that “freight is the\r\nmother of wages,” and though the seaman may have performed his part,\r\nthe disaster which prevents the ship from earning freight deprives him\r\nof claim for his wages.\r\n\r\nIn this legal maxim is embodied the truth for which I am contending.\r\nProduction is always the mother of wages. Without production, wages\r\nwould not and could not be. It is from the produce of labor, not from\r\nthe advances of capital that wages come.\r\n\r\nWherever we analyze the facts this will be found to be true. For labor\r\nalways precedes wages. This is as universally true of wages received\r\nby the laborer from an employer as it is of wages taken directly by\r\nthe laborer who is his own employer. In the one class of cases as\r\nin the other, reward is conditioned upon exertion. Paid sometimes by\r\nthe day, oftener by the week or month, occasionally by the year, and\r\nin many branches of production by the piece, the payment of wages by\r\nan employer to an employee always implies the previous rendering of\r\nlabor by the employee for the benefit of the employer, for the few\r\ncases in which advance payments are made for personal services are\r\nevidently referable either to charity or to guarantee and purchase. The\r\nname “retainer,” given to advance payments to lawyers, shows the true\r\ncharacter of the transaction, as does the name “blood money” given in\r\n’longshore vernacular to a payment which is nominally wages advanced\r\nto sailors, but which in reality is purchase money—both English and\r\nAmerican law considering a sailor as much a chattel as a pig.\r\n\r\nI dwell on this obvious fact that labor always precedes wages, because\r\nit is all-important to an understanding of the more complicated\r\nphenomena of wages that it should be kept in mind. And obvious as it\r\nis, as I have put it, the plausibility of the proposition that wages\r\nare drawn from capital—a proposition that is made the basis for such\r\nimportant and far-reaching deductions—comes in the first instance from\r\na statement that ignores and leads the attention away from this truth.\r\nThat statement is, that labor cannot exert its productive power unless\r\nsupplied by capital with maintenance.[9] The unwary reader at once\r\nrecognizes the fact that the laborer must have food, clothing, etc.,\r\nin order to enable him to perform the work, and having been told that\r\nthe food, clothing, etc., used by productive laborers are capital, he\r\nassents to the conclusion that the consumption of capital is necessary\r\nto the application of labor, and from this it is but an obvious\r\ndeduction that industry is limited by capital—that the demand for labor\r\ndepends upon the supply of capital, and hence that wages depend upon\r\nthe ratio between the number of laborers looking for employment and the\r\namount of capital devoted to hiring them.\r\n\r\nBut I think the discussion in the previous chapter will enable any\r\none to see wherein lies the fallacy of this reasoning—a fallacy\r\nwhich has entangled some of the most acute minds in a web of their\r\nown spinning. It is in the use of the term capital in two senses. In\r\nthe primary proposition that capital is necessary to the exertion of\r\nproductive labor, the term “capital” is understood as including all\r\nfood, clothing, shelter, etc.; whereas, in the deductions finally\r\ndrawn from it, the term is used in its common and legitimate meaning\r\nof wealth devoted, not to the immediate gratification of desire, but\r\nto the procurement of more wealth—of wealth in the hands of employers\r\nas distinguished from laborers. The conclusion is no more valid than\r\nit would be from the acceptance of the proposition that a laborer\r\ncannot go to work without his breakfast and some clothes, to infer\r\nthat no more laborers can go to work than employers first furnish\r\nwith breakfasts and clothes. Now, the fact is that laborers generally\r\nfurnish their own breakfasts and the clothes in which they go to work;\r\nand the further fact is that capital (in the sense in which the word\r\nis used in distinction to labor) in exceptional cases sometimes may,\r\nbut is never compelled to make advances to labor before the work\r\nbegins. Of all the vast number of unemployed laborers in the civilized\r\nworld to-day, there is probably not a single one willing to work who\r\ncould not be employed without any advance of wages. A great proportion\r\nwould doubtless gladly go to work on terms which did not require the\r\npayment of wages before the end of a month; it is doubtful if there are\r\nenough to be called a class who would not go to work and wait for their\r\nwages until the end of the week, as most laborers habitually do; while\r\nthere are certainly none who would not wait for their wages until the\r\nend of the day, or if you please, until the next meal hour. The precise\r\ntime of the payment of wages is immaterial; the essential point—the\r\npoint I lay stress on—is that it is _after_ the performance of work.\r\n\r\nThe payment of wages, therefore, always implies the previous rendering\r\nof labor. Now, what does the rendering of labor in production imply?\r\nEvidently the production of wealth, which, if it is to be exchanged\r\nor used in production, is capital. Therefore, the payment of capital\r\nin wages pre-supposes a production of capital by the labor for which\r\nthe wages are paid. And as the employer generally makes a profit, the\r\npayment of wages is, so far as he is concerned, but the return to the\r\nlaborer of a portion of the capital he has received from the labor. So\r\nfar as the employee is concerned, it is but the receipt of a portion of\r\nthe capital his labor has previously produced. As the value paid in the\r\nwages is thus exchanged for a value brought into being by the labor,\r\nhow can it be said that wages are drawn from capital or advanced by\r\ncapital? As in the exchange of labor for wages the employer always gets\r\nthe capital created by the labor before he pays out capital in the\r\nwages, at what point is his capital lessened even temporarily?[10]\r\n\r\nBring the question to the test of facts. Take, for instance, an\r\nemploying manufacturer who is engaged in turning raw material into\r\nfinished products—cotton into cloth, iron into hardware, leather into\r\nboots, or so on, as may be, and who pays his hands, as is generally\r\nthe case, once a week. Make an exact inventory of his capital on\r\nMonday morning before the beginning of work, and it will consist of\r\nhis buildings, machinery, raw materials, money on hand, and finished\r\nproducts in stock. Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that he\r\nneither buys nor sells during the week, and after work has stopped\r\nand he has paid his hands on Saturday night, take a new inventory of\r\nhis capital. The item of money will be less, for it has been paid\r\nout in wages; there will be less raw material, less coal, etc., and\r\na proper deduction must be made from the value of the buildings\r\nand machinery for the week’s wear and tear. But if he is doing a\r\nremunerative business, which must on the average be the case, the item\r\nof finished products will be so much greater as to compensate for all\r\nthese deficiencies and show in the summing up an increase of capital.\r\nManifestly, then, the value he paid his hands in wages was not drawn\r\nfrom his capital, or from any one else’s capital. It came, not from\r\ncapital, but from the value created by the labor itself. There was no\r\nmore advance of capital than if he had hired his hands to dig clams,\r\nand paid them with a part of the clams they dug. Their wages were as\r\ntruly the produce of their labor as were the wages of the primitive\r\nman, when, long “before the appropriation of land and the accumulation\r\nof stock,” he obtained an oyster by knocking it with a stone from the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAs the laborer who works for an employer does not get his wages until\r\nhe has performed the work, his case is similar to that of the depositor\r\nin a bank who cannot draw money out until he has put money in. And as\r\nby drawing out what he has previously put in, the bank depositor does\r\nnot lessen the capital of the bank, neither can laborers by receiving\r\nwages lessen even temporarily either the capital of the employer or\r\nthe aggregate capital of the community. Their wages no more come from\r\ncapital than the checks of depositors are drawn against bank capital.\r\nIt is true that laborers in receiving wages do not generally receive\r\nback wealth in the same form in which they have rendered it, any more\r\nthan bank depositors receive back the identical coins or bank notes\r\nthey have deposited, but they receive it in equivalent form, and as\r\nwe are justified in saying that the depositor receives from the bank\r\nthe money he paid in, so are we justified in saying that the laborer\r\nreceives in wages the wealth he has rendered in labor.\r\n\r\nThat this universal truth is so often obscured, is largely due to that\r\nfruitful source of economic obscurities, the confounding of wealth with\r\nmoney; and it is remarkable to see so many of those who, since Dr. Adam\r\nSmith made the egg stand on its head, have copiously demonstrated the\r\nfallacies of the mercantile system, fall into delusions of the very\r\nsame kind in treating of the relations of capital and labor. Money\r\nbeing the general medium of exchanges, the common flux through which\r\nall transmutations of wealth from one form to another take place,\r\nwhatever difficulties may exist to an exchange will generally show\r\nthemselves on the side of reduction to money, and thus it is sometimes\r\neasier to exchange money for any other form of wealth than it is to\r\nexchange wealth in a particular form into money, for the reason that\r\nthere are more holders of wealth who desire to make some exchange\r\nthan there are who desire to make any particular exchange. And so a\r\nproducing employer who has paid out his money in wages may sometimes\r\nfind it difficult to turn quickly back into money the increased value\r\nfor which his money has really been exchanged, and is spoken of as\r\nhaving exhausted or advanced his capital in the payment of wages. Yet,\r\nunless the new value created by the labor is less than the wages paid,\r\nwhich can be only an exceptional case, the capital which he had before\r\nin money he now has in goods—it has been changed in form, but not\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nThere is one branch of production in regard to which the confusions of\r\nthought which arise from the habit of estimating capital in money are\r\nleast likely to occur, inasmuch as its product is the general material\r\nand standard of money. And it so happens that this business furnishes\r\nus, almost side by side, with illustrations of production passing from\r\nthe simplest to most complex forms.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of California, as afterward in Australia, the placer\r\nminer, who found in river bed or surface deposit the glittering\r\nparticles which the slow processes of nature had for ages been\r\naccumulating, picked up or washed out his “wages” (so, too, he called\r\nthem) in actual money, for coin being scarce, gold dust passed as\r\ncurrency by weight, and at the end of the day had his wages in money\r\nin a buckskin bag in his pocket. There can be no dispute as to whether\r\nthese wages came from capital or not. They were manifestly the produce\r\nof his labor. Nor could there be any dispute when the holder of a\r\nspecially rich claim hired men to work for him and paid them off in the\r\nidentical money which their labor had taken from gulch or bar. As coin\r\nbecame more abundant, its greater convenience in saving the trouble and\r\nloss of weighing assigned gold dust to the place of a commodity, and\r\nwith coin obtained by the sale of the dust their labor had procured,\r\nthe employing miner paid off his hands. Where he had coin enough to do\r\nso, instead of selling his gold dust at the nearest store and paying\r\na dealer’s profit, he retained it until he got enough to take a trip,\r\nor send by express to San Francisco, where at the mint he could have\r\nit turned into coin without charge. While thus accumulating gold dust\r\nhe was lessening his stock of coin; just as the manufacturer, while\r\naccumulating a stock of goods, lessens his stock of money. Yet no one\r\nwould be obtuse enough to imagine that in thus taking in gold dust and\r\npaying out coin the miner was lessening his capital.\r\n\r\nBut the deposits that could be worked without preliminary labor\r\nwere soon exhausted, and gold mining rapidly took a more elaborate\r\ncharacter. Before claims could be opened so as to yield any return\r\ndeep shafts had to be sunk, great dams constructed, long tunnels cut\r\nthrough the hardest rock, water brought for miles over mountain ridges\r\nand across deep valleys, and expensive machinery put up. These works\r\ncould not be constructed without capital. Sometimes their construction\r\nrequired years, during which no return could be hoped for, while the\r\nmen employed had to be paid their wages every week, or every month.\r\nSurely, it will be said, in such cases, even if in no others, that\r\nwages do actually come from capital; are actually advanced by capital;\r\nand must necessarily lessen capital in their payment! Surely here, at\r\nleast, industry is limited by capital, for without capital such works\r\ncould not be carried on! Let us see:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is cases of this class that are always instanced as showing that\r\nwages are advanced from capital. For where wages are paid before the\r\nobject of the labor is obtained, or is finished—as in agriculture,\r\nwhere plowing and sowing must precede by several months the harvesting\r\nof the crop; as in the erection of buildings, the construction of\r\nships, railroads, canals, etc.—it is clear that the owners of the\r\ncapital paid in wages cannot expect an immediate return, but, as the\r\nphrase is, must “outlay it,” or “lie out of it” for a time, which\r\nsometimes amounts to many years. And hence, if first principles are\r\nnot kept in mind, it is easy to jump to the conclusion that wages are\r\nadvanced by capital.\r\n\r\nBut such cases will not embarrass the reader to whom in what has\r\npreceded I have made myself clearly understood. An easy analysis will\r\nshow that these instances where wages are paid before the product is\r\nfinished, or even produced, do not afford any exception to the rule\r\napparent where the product is finished before wages are paid.\r\n\r\nIf I go to a broker to exchange silver for gold, I lay down my silver,\r\nwhich he counts and puts away, and then hands me the equivalent in\r\ngold, minus his commission. Does the broker advance me any capital?\r\nManifestly not. What he had before in gold he now has in silver, plus\r\nhis profit. And as he got the silver before he paid out the gold, there\r\nis on his part not even momentarily an advance of capital.\r\n\r\nNow, this operation of the broker is precisely analogous to what the\r\ncapitalist does, when, in such cases as we are now considering, he\r\npays out capital in wages. As the rendering of labor precedes the\r\npayment of wages, and as the rendering of labor in production implies\r\nthe creation of value, the employer receives value before he pays out\r\nvalue—he but exchanges capital of one form for capital of another form.\r\nFor the creation of value does not depend upon the finishing of the\r\nproduct; it takes place at every stage of the process of production, as\r\nthe immediate result of the application of labor, and hence, no matter\r\nhow long the process in which it is engaged, labor always adds to\r\ncapital by its exertion before it takes from capital in its wages.\r\n\r\nHere is a blacksmith at his forge making picks. Clearly he is making\r\ncapital—adding picks to his employer’s capital before he draws money\r\nfrom it in wages. Here is a machinist or boilermaker working on\r\nthe keel-plates of a Great Eastern. Is not he also just as clearly\r\ncreating value—making capital? The giant steamship, as the pick, is\r\nan article of wealth, an instrument of production, and though the one\r\nmay not be completed for years, while the other is completed in a\r\nfew minutes, each day’s work, in the one case as in the other, is as\r\nclearly a production of wealth—an addition to capital. In the case of\r\nthe steamship, as in the case of the pick, it is not the last blow,\r\nany more than the first blow, that creates the value of the finished\r\nproduct—the creation of value is continuous, it immediately results\r\nfrom the exertion of labor.\r\n\r\nWe see this very clearly wherever the division of labor has made it\r\ncustomary for different parts of the full process of production to be\r\ncarried on by different sets of producers—that is to say, wherever we\r\nare in the habit of estimating the amount of value which the labor\r\nexpended in any preparatory stage of production has created. And a\r\nmoment’s reflection will show that this is the case as to the vast\r\nmajority of products. Take a ship, a building, a jackknife, a book,\r\na lady’s thimble or a loaf of bread. They are finished products. But\r\nthey were not produced at one operation or by one set of producers.\r\nAnd this being the case, we readily distinguish different points or\r\nstages in the creation of the value which as completed articles they\r\nrepresent. When we do not distinguish different parts in the final\r\nprocess of production we do distinguish the value of the materials.\r\nThe value of these materials may often be again decomposed many times,\r\nexhibiting as many clearly defined steps in the creation of the final\r\nvalue. At each of these steps we habitually estimate a creation of\r\nvalue, an addition to capital. The batch of bread which the baker is\r\ntaking from the oven has a certain value. But this is composed in part\r\nof the value of the flour from which the dough was made. And this again\r\nis composed of the value of the wheat, the value given by milling, etc.\r\nIron in the form of pigs is very far from being a completed product.\r\nIt must yet pass through several, or, perhaps, through many, stages of\r\nproduction before it results in the finished articles that were the\r\nultimate objects for which the iron ore was extracted from the mine.\r\nYet, is not pig iron capital? And so the process of production is not\r\nreally completed when a crop of cotton is gathered, nor yet when it is\r\nginned and pressed; nor yet when it arrives at Lowell or Manchester;\r\nnor yet when it is converted into yarn; nor yet when it becomes cloth;\r\nbut only when it is finally placed in the hands of the consumer. Yet\r\nat each step in this progress there is clearly enough a creation of\r\nvalue—an addition to capital. Why, therefore, although we do not so\r\nhabitually distinguish and estimate it, is there not a creation of\r\nvalue—an addition to capital—when the ground is plowed for the crop?\r\nIs it because it may possibly be a bad season and the crop may fail?\r\nEvidently not; for a like possibility of misadventure attends every one\r\nof the many steps in the production of the finished article. On the\r\naverage a crop is sure to come up, and so much plowing and sowing will\r\non the average result in so much cotton in the boll, as surely as so\r\nmuch spinning of cotton yarn will result in so much cloth.\r\n\r\nIn short, as the payment of wages is always conditioned upon the\r\nrendering of labor, the payment of wages in production, no matter\r\nhow long the process, never involves any advance of capital, or even\r\ntemporarily lessens capital. It may take a year, or even years, to\r\nbuild a ship, but the creation of value of which the finished ship will\r\nbe the sum goes on day by day, and hour by hour, from the time the keel\r\nis laid or even the ground is cleared. Nor by the payment of wages\r\nbefore the ship is completed, does the master builder lessen either his\r\ncapital or the capital of the community, for the value of the partially\r\ncompleted ship stands in place of the value paid out in wages. There is\r\nno advance of capital in this payment of wages, for the labor of the\r\nworkmen during the week or month creates and renders to the builder\r\nmore capital than is paid back to them at the end of the week or month,\r\nas is shown by the fact that if the builder were at any stage of the\r\nconstruction asked to sell a partially completed ship he would expect a\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when a Sutro or St. Gothard tunnel or a Suez canal is cut,\r\nthere is no advance of capital. The tunnel or canal, as it is cut,\r\nbecomes capital as much as the money spent in cutting it—or, if you\r\nplease, the powder, drills, etc., used in the work, and the food,\r\nclothes, etc., used by the workmen—as is shown by the fact that the\r\nvalue of the capital stock of the company is not lessened as capital in\r\nthese forms is gradually changed into capital in the form of tunnel or\r\ncanal. On the contrary, it probably, and on the average, increases as\r\nthe work progresses, just as the capital invested in a speedier mode of\r\nproduction would on the average increase.\r\n\r\nAnd this is obvious in agriculture also. That the creation of value\r\ndoes not take place all at once when the crop is gathered, but step\r\nby step during the whole process which the gathering of the crop\r\nconcludes, and that no payment of wages in the interim lessens the\r\nfarmer’s capital, is tangible enough when land is sold or rented\r\nduring the process of production, as a plowed field will bring more\r\nthan an unplowed field, or a field that has been sown more than one\r\nmerely plowed. It is tangible enough when growing crops are sold, as\r\nis sometimes done, or where the farmer does not harvest himself, but\r\nlets a contract to the owner of harvesting machinery. It is tangible in\r\nthe case of orchards and vineyards which, though not yet in bearing,\r\nbring prices proportionate to their age. It is tangible in the case\r\nof horses, cattle and sheep, which increase in value as they grow\r\ntoward maturity. And if not always tangible between what may be called\r\nthe usual exchange points in production, this increase of value as\r\nsurely takes place with every exertion of labor. Hence, where labor\r\nis rendered before wages are paid, the advance of capital is really\r\nmade by labor, and is from the employed to the employer, not from the\r\nemployer to the employed.\r\n\r\n“Yet,” it may be said, “in such cases as we have been considering\r\ncapital is required!” Certainly; I do not dispute that. But it is not\r\nrequired in order to make advances to labor. It is required for quite\r\nanother purpose. What that purpose is we may readily see.\r\n\r\nWhen wages are paid in kind—that is to say, in wealth of the same\r\nspecies as the labor produces; as, for instance, if I hire men to cut\r\nwood, agreeing to give them as wages a portion of the wood they cut, a\r\nmethod sometimes adopted by the owners or lessees of woodland, it is\r\nevident that no capital is required for the payment of wages. Nor yet\r\nwhen, for the sake of mutual convenience, arising from the fact that\r\na large quantity of wood can be more readily and more advantageously\r\nexchanged than a number of small quantities, I agree to pay wages\r\nin money, instead of wood, shall I need any capital, provided I can\r\nmake the exchange of the wood for money before the wages are due. It\r\nis only when I cannot make such an exchange, or such an advantageous\r\nexchange as I desire, until I accumulate a large quantity of wood that\r\nI shall need capital. Nor even then shall I need capital if I can make\r\na partial or tentative exchange by borrowing on my wood. If I cannot,\r\nor do not choose, either to sell the wood or to borrow upon it, and\r\nyet wish to go ahead accumulating a large stock of wood, I shall need\r\ncapital. But manifestly, I need this capital, not for the payment of\r\nwages, but for the accumulation of a stock of wood. Likewise in cutting\r\na tunnel. If the workmen were paid in tunnel (which, if convenient,\r\nmight easily be done by paying them in stock of the company), no\r\ncapital for the payment of wages would be required. It is only when\r\nthe undertakers wish to accumulate capital in the shape of a tunnel\r\nthat they will need capital. To recur to our first illustration: The\r\nbroker to whom I sell my silver cannot carry on his business without\r\ncapital. But he does not need this capital because he makes any advance\r\nof capital to me when he receives my silver and hands me gold. He needs\r\nit because the nature of the business requires the keeping of a certain\r\namount of capital on hand, in order that when a customer comes he may\r\nbe prepared to make the exchange the customer desires.\r\n\r\nAnd so we shall find it in every branch of production. Capital has\r\nnever to be set aside for the payment of wages when the produce of the\r\nlabor for which the wages are paid is exchanged as soon as produced;\r\nit is only required when this produce is stored up, or what is to the\r\nindividual the same thing, placed in the general current of exchanges\r\nwithout being at once drawn against—that is, sold on credit. But the\r\ncapital thus required is not required for the payment of wages, nor\r\nfor advances to labor, as it is always represented in the produce of\r\nthe labor. It is never as an employer of labor that any producer needs\r\ncapital; when he does need capital, it is because he is not only an\r\nemployer of labor, but a merchant or speculator in, or an accumulator\r\nof, the products of labor. This is generally the case with employers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: The man who works for himself gets his wages in the\r\nthings he produces, as he produces them, and exchanges this value\r\ninto another form whenever he sells the produce. The man who works\r\nfor another for stipulated wages in money works under a contract of\r\nexchange. He also creates his wages as he renders his labor, but he\r\ndoes not get them except at stated times, in stated amounts, and in a\r\ndifferent form. In performing the labor he is advancing in exchange;\r\nwhen he gets his wages the exchange is completed. During the time he\r\nis earning the wages he is advancing capital to his employer, but at\r\nno time, unless wages are paid before work is done, is the employer\r\nadvancing capital to him. Whether the employer who receives this\r\nproduce in exchange for the wages immediately re-exchanges it, or\r\nkeeps it for awhile, no more alters the character of the transaction\r\nthan does the final disposition of the product made by the ultimate\r\nreceiver, who may, perhaps, be in another quarter of the globe and at\r\nthe end of a series of exchanges numbering hundreds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MAINTENANCE OF LABORERS NOT DRAWN FROM CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a stumbling block may yet remain, or may recur, in the mind of the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nAs the plowman cannot eat the furrow, nor a partially completed steam\r\nengine aid in any way in producing the clothes the machinist wears,\r\nhave I not, in the words of John Stuart Mill, “forgotten that the\r\npeople of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied, not\r\nby the produce of present labor, but of past?” Or, to use the language\r\nof a popular elementary work—that of Mrs. Fawcett—have I not “forgotten\r\nthat many months must elapse between the sowing of the seed and the\r\ntime when the produce of that seed is converted into a loaf of bread,”\r\nand that “it is, therefore, evident that laborers cannot live upon\r\nthat which their labor is assisting to produce, but are maintained by\r\nthat wealth which their labor, or the labor of others, has previously\r\nproduced, which wealth is capital?”[11]\r\n\r\nThe assumption made in these passages—the assumption that it is so\r\nself-evident that labor must be subsisted from capital that the\r\nproposition has but to be stated to compel recognition—runs through\r\nthe whole fabric of current political economy. And so confidently is\r\nit held that the maintenance of labor is drawn from capital that the\r\nproposition that “population regulates itself by the funds which are\r\nto employ it, and, therefore, always increases or diminishes with\r\nthe increase or diminution of capital,”[12] is regarded as equally\r\naxiomatic, and in its turn made the basis of important reasoning.\r\n\r\nYet being resolved, these propositions are seen to be, not\r\nself-evident, but absurd; for they involve the idea that labor cannot\r\nbe exerted until the products of labor are saved—thus putting the\r\nproduct before the producer.\r\n\r\nAnd being examined, they will be seen to derive their apparent\r\nplausibility from a confusion of thought.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the fallacy, concealed by an erroneous\r\ndefinition, which underlies the proposition that because food, raiment\r\nand shelter are necessary to productive labor, therefore industry\r\nis limited by capital. To say that a man must have his breakfast\r\nbefore going to work is not to say that he cannot go to work unless a\r\ncapitalist furnishes him with a breakfast, for his breakfast may, and\r\nin point of fact in any country where there is not actual famine will,\r\ncome not from wealth set apart for the assistance of production, but\r\nfrom wealth set apart for subsistence. And, as has been previously\r\nshown, food, clothing, etc.—in short, all articles of wealth—are only\r\ncapital so long as they remain in the possession of those who propose,\r\nnot to consume, but to exchange them for other commodities or for\r\nproductive services, and cease to be capital when they pass into the\r\npossession of those who will consume them; for in that transaction\r\nthey pass from the stock of wealth held for the purpose of procuring\r\nother wealth, and pass into the stock of wealth held for purposes of\r\ngratification, irrespective of whether their consumption will aid in\r\nthe production of wealth or not. Unless this distinction is preserved\r\nit is impossible to draw the line between the wealth that is capital\r\nand the wealth that is not capital, even by remitting the distinction\r\nto the “mind of the possessor,” as does John Stuart Mill. For men do\r\nnot eat or abstain, wear clothes or go naked, as they propose to engage\r\nin productive labor or not. They eat because they are hungry, and wear\r\nclothes because they would be uncomfortable without them. Take the\r\nfood on the breakfast table of a laborer who will work or not that day\r\nas he gets the opportunity. If the distinction between capital and\r\nnon-capital be the support of productive labor, is this food capital or\r\nnot? It is as impossible for the laborer himself as for any philosopher\r\nof the Ricardo-Mill school to tell. Nor yet can it be told when it gets\r\ninto his stomach; nor, supposing that he does not get work at first,\r\nbut continues the search, can it be told until it has passed into the\r\nblood and tissues. Yet the man will eat his breakfast all the same.\r\n\r\nBut, though it would be logically sufficient, it is hardly safe to rest\r\nhere and leave the argument to turn on the distinction between wealth\r\nand capital. Nor is it necessary. It seems to me that the proposition\r\nthat present labor must be maintained by the produce of past labor will\r\nupon analysis prove to be true only in the sense that the afternoon’s\r\nlabor must be performed by the aid of the noonday meal, or that before\r\nyou eat the hare he must be caught and cooked. And this, manifestly,\r\nis not the sense in which the proposition is used to support the\r\nimportant reasoning that is made to hinge upon it. That sense is, that\r\nbefore a work which will not immediately result in wealth available\r\nfor subsistence can be carried on, there must exist such a stock of\r\nsubsistence as will support the laborers during the process. Let us see\r\nif this be true:\r\n\r\nThe canoe which Robinson Crusoe made with such infinite toil and pains\r\nwas a production in which his labor could not yield an immediate\r\nreturn. But was it necessary that, before he commenced, he should\r\naccumulate a stock of food sufficient to maintain him while he felled\r\nthe tree, hewed out the canoe, and finally launched her into the sea?\r\nNot at all. It was necessary only that he should devote part of his\r\ntime to the procurement of food while he was devoting part of his time\r\nto the building and launching of the canoe. Or supposing a hundred men\r\nto be landed, without any stock of provisions, in a new country. Will\r\nit be necessary for them to accumulate a season’s stock of provisions\r\nbefore they can begin to cultivate the soil? Not at all. It will be\r\nnecessary only that fish, game, berries, etc., shall be so abundant\r\nthat the labor of a part of the hundred may suffice to furnish daily\r\nenough of these for the maintenance of all, and that there shall be\r\nsuch a sense of mutual interest, or such a correlation of desires, as\r\nshall lead those who in the present get the food to divide (exchange)\r\nwith those whose efforts are directed to future recompense.\r\n\r\nWhat is true in these cases is true in all cases. It is not necessary\r\nto the production of things that cannot be used as subsistence, or\r\ncannot be immediately utilized, that there should have been a previous\r\nproduction of the wealth required for the maintenance of the laborers\r\nwhile the production is going on. It is only necessary that there\r\nshould be, somewhere within the circle of exchange, a contemporaneous\r\nproduction of sufficient subsistence for the laborers, and a\r\nwillingness to exchange this subsistence for the thing on which the\r\nlabor is being bestowed.\r\n\r\nAnd as a matter of fact, is it not true, in any normal condition of\r\nthings, that consumption is supported by contemporaneous production?\r\n\r\nHere is a luxurious idler, who does no productive work either with\r\nhead or hand, but lives, we say, upon wealth which his father left\r\nhim securely invested in government bonds. Does his subsistence, as\r\na matter of fact, come from wealth accumulated in the past or from\r\nthe productive labor that is going on around him? On his table are\r\nnew-laid eggs, butter churned but a few days before, milk which the\r\ncow gave this morning, fish which twenty-four hours ago were swimming\r\nin the sea, meat which the butcher boy has just brought in time to be\r\ncooked, vegetables fresh from the garden, and fruit from the orchard—in\r\nshort, hardly anything that has not recently left the hand of the\r\nproductive laborer (for in this category must be included transporters\r\nand distributors as well as those who are engaged in the first stages\r\nof production), and nothing that has been produced for any considerable\r\nlength of time, unless it may be some bottles of old wine. What this\r\nman inherited from his father, and on which we say he lives, is not\r\nactually wealth at all, but only the power of commanding wealth as\r\nothers produce it. And it is from this contemporaneous production that\r\nhis subsistence is drawn.\r\n\r\nThe fifty square miles of London undoubtedly contain more wealth\r\nthan within the same space anywhere else exists. Yet were productive\r\nlabor in London absolutely to cease, within a few hours people would\r\nbegin to die like rotten sheep, and within a few weeks, or at most a\r\nfew months, hardly one would be left alive. For an entire suspension\r\nof productive labor would be a disaster more dreadful than ever yet\r\nbefell a beleaguered city. It would not be a mere external wall of\r\ncircumvallation, such as Titus drew around Jerusalem, which would\r\nprevent the constant incoming of the supplies on which a great city\r\nlives, but it would be the drawing of a similar wall around each\r\nhousehold. Imagine such a suspension of labor in any community, and you\r\nwill see how true it is that mankind really live from hand to mouth;\r\nthat it is the daily labor of the community that supplies the community\r\nwith its daily bread.\r\n\r\nJust as the subsistence of the laborers who built the Pyramids was\r\ndrawn not from a previously hoarded stock, but from the constantly\r\nrecurring crops of the Nile Valley; just as a modern government\r\nwhen it undertakes a great work of years does not appropriate to it\r\nwealth already produced, but wealth yet to be produced, which is\r\ntaken from producers in taxes as the work progresses; so it is that\r\nthe subsistence of the laborers engaged in production which does not\r\ndirectly yield subsistence comes from the production of subsistence in\r\nwhich others are simultaneously engaged.\r\n\r\nIf we trace the circle of exchange by which work done in the production\r\nof a great steam engine secures to the worker bread, meat, clothes and\r\nshelter, we shall find that though between the laborer on the engine\r\nand the producers of the bread, meat, etc., there may be a thousand\r\nintermediate exchanges, the transaction, when reduced to its lowest\r\nterms, really amounts to an exchange of labor between him and them.\r\nNow the cause which induces the expenditure of the labor on the engine\r\nis evidently that some one who has power to give what is desired by\r\nthe laborer on the engine wants in exchange an engine—that is to say,\r\nthere exists a demand for an engine on the part of those producing\r\nbread, meat, etc., or on the part of those who are producing what the\r\nproducers of the bread, meat, etc., desire. It is this demand which\r\ndirects the labor of the machinist to the production of the engine, and\r\nhence, reversely, the demand of the machinist for bread, meat, etc.,\r\nreally directs an equivalent amount of labor to the production of these\r\nthings, and thus his labor, actually exerted in the production of the\r\nengine, virtually produces the things in which he expends his wages.\r\n\r\nOr, to formularize this principle:\r\n\r\n _The demand for consumption determines the direction in which labor\r\n will be expended in production._\r\n\r\nThis principle is so simple and obvious that it needs no further\r\nillustration, yet in its light all the complexities of our subject\r\ndisappear, and we thus reach the same view of the real objects and\r\nrewards of labor in the intricacies of modern production that we gained\r\nby observing in the first beginnings of society the simpler forms of\r\nproduction and exchange. We see that now, as then, each laborer is\r\nendeavoring to obtain by his exertions the satisfaction of his own\r\ndesires; we see that although the minute division of labor assigns to\r\neach producer the production of but a small part, or perhaps nothing\r\nat all, of the particular things he labors to get, yet, in aiding in\r\nthe production of what other producers want, he is directing other\r\nlabor to the production of the things he wants—in effect, producing\r\nthem himself. And thus, if he make jack-knives and eat wheat, the wheat\r\nis really as much the produce of his labor as if he had grown it for\r\nhimself and left wheat-growers to make their own jack-knives.\r\n\r\nWe thus see how thoroughly and completely true it is, that in whatever\r\nis taken or consumed by laborers in return for labor rendered, there\r\nis no advance of capital to the laborers. If I have made jack-knives,\r\nand with the wages received have bought wheat, I have simply exchanged\r\njack-knives for wheat—added jack-knives to the existing stock of wealth\r\nand taken wheat from it. And as the demand for consumption determines\r\nthe direction in which labor will be expended in production, it cannot\r\neven be said, so long as the limit of wheat production has not been\r\nreached, that I have lessened the stock of wheat, for, by placing\r\njack-knives in the exchangeable stock of wealth and taking wheat out,\r\nI have determined labor at the other end of a series of exchanges\r\nto the production of wheat, just as the wheat grower, by putting in\r\nwheat and demanding jack-knives, determined labor to the production of\r\njack-knives, as the easiest way by which wheat could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAnd so the man who is following the plow—though the crop for which he\r\nis opening the ground is not yet sown, and after being sown will take\r\nmonths to arrive at maturity—he is yet, by the exertion of his labor in\r\nplowing, virtually producing the food he eats and the wages he\r\nreceives. For, though plowing is but a part of the operation of\r\nproducing a crop, it _is_ a part, and as necessary a part as\r\nharvesting. The doing of it is a step toward procuring a crop, which,\r\nby the assurance which it gives of the future crop, sets free from the\r\nstock constantly held the subsistence and wages of the plowman. This is\r\nnot merely theoretically true, it is practically and literally true. At\r\nthe proper time for plowing, let plowing cease. Would not the symptoms\r\nof scarcity at once manifest themselves without waiting for the time of\r\nthe harvest? Let plowing cease, and would not the effect at once be\r\nfelt in counting-room, and machine shop, and factory? Would not loom\r\nand spindle soon stand as idle as the plow? That this would be so, we\r\nsee in the effect which immediately follows a bad season. And if this\r\nwould be so, is not the man who plows really producing his subsistence\r\nand wages as much as though during the day or week his labor actually\r\nresulted in the things for which his labor is exchanged?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, where there is labor looking for employment, the\r\nwant of capital does not prevent the owner of land which promises a\r\ncrop for which there is a demand from hiring it. Either he makes an\r\nagreement to cultivate on shares, a common method in some parts of the\r\nUnited States, in which case the laborers, if they are without means of\r\nsubsistence, will, on the strength of the work they are doing, obtain\r\ncredit at the nearest store; or, if he prefers to pay wages, the farmer\r\nwill himself obtain credit, and thus the work done in cultivation is\r\nimmediately utilized or exchanged as it is done. If anything more\r\nwill be used up than would be used up if the laborers were forced to\r\nbeg instead of to work (for in any civilized country during a normal\r\ncondition of things the laborers must be supported anyhow), it will be\r\nthe reserve capital drawn out by the prospect of replacement, and which\r\nis in fact replaced by the work as it is done. For instance, in the\r\npurely agricultural districts of Southern California there was in 1877\r\na total failure of the crop, and of millions of sheep nothing remained\r\nbut their bones. In the great San Joaquin Valley were many farmers\r\nwithout food enough to support their families until the next harvest\r\ntime, let alone to support any laborers. But the rains came again in\r\nproper season, and these very farmers proceeded to hire hands to plow\r\nand to sow. For every here and there was a farmer who had been holding\r\nback part of his crop. As soon as the rains came he was anxious to sell\r\nbefore the next harvest brought lower prices, and the grain thus held\r\nin reserve, through the machinery of exchanges and advances, passed to\r\nthe use of the cultivators—set free, in effect produced, by the work\r\ndone for the next crop.\r\n\r\nThe series of exchanges which unite production and consumption may be\r\nlikened to a curved pipe filled with water. If a quantity of water is\r\npoured in at one end, a like quantity is released at the other. It is\r\nnot identically the same water, but is its equivalent. And so they\r\nwho do the work of production put in as they take out—they receive in\r\nsubsistence and wages but the produce of their labor.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Industry is limited by capital.... There can be no more industry\r\nthan is supplied with materials to work up and food to eat.\r\nSelf-evident as the thing is, it is often forgotten that the people\r\nof a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the\r\nproduce of present labor, but of past. They consume what has been\r\nproduced, not what is about to be produced. Now, of what has been\r\nproduced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor,\r\nand there will not and cannot be more of that labor than the portion\r\nso allotted (which is the capital of the country) can feed and provide\r\nwith the materials and instruments of production.—_John Stuart Mill,\r\nPrinciples of Political Economy, Book I, Chap. V, Sec. I._\r\n\r\n[10] I speak of labor producing capital for the sake of greater\r\nclearness. What labor always procures is either wealth, which may or\r\nmay not be capital, or services, the cases in which nothing is obtained\r\nbeing merely exceptional cases of misadventure. Where the object of\r\nthe labor is simply the gratification of the employer, as where I\r\nhire a man to black my boots, I do not pay the wages from capital,\r\nbut from wealth which I have devoted, not to reproductive uses, but\r\nto consumption for my own satisfaction. Even if wages thus paid be\r\nconsidered as drawn from capital, then by that act they pass from the\r\ncategory of capital to that of wealth devoted to the gratification of\r\nthe possessor, as when a cigar dealer takes a dozen cigars from the\r\nstock he has for sale and puts them in his pocket for his own use.\r\n\r\n[11] Political Economy for Beginners, by Millicent Garrett Fawcett,\r\nChap. III, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[12] The words quoted are Ricardo’s (Chap. II); but the idea is common\r\nin standard works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE REAL FUNCTIONS OF CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may now be asked, If capital is not required for the payment of\r\nwages or the support of labor during production, what, then, are its\r\nfunctions?\r\n\r\nThe previous examination has made the answer clear. Capital, as we have\r\nseen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of more wealth, as\r\ndistinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction of desire;\r\nor, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange.\r\n\r\nCapital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth:\r\n(1) By enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by\r\ndigging up clams with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel\r\nby shoveling coal into a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By\r\nenabling labor to avail itself of the reproductive forces of nature,\r\nas to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals by breeding them. (3) By\r\npermitting the division of labor, and thus, on the one hand, increasing\r\nthe efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization of\r\nspecial capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of\r\nwaste; and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor\r\nat their highest, by taking advantage of the diversities of soil,\r\nclimate and situation, so as to obtain each particular species of\r\nwealth where nature is most favorable to its production.\r\n\r\nCapital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth,\r\nas is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by\r\nnature. But such materials partially worked up and in the course of\r\nexchange are capital.\r\n\r\nCapital does not supply or advance wages, as is erroneously taught.\r\nWages are that part of the produce of his labor obtained by the laborer.\r\n\r\nCapital does not maintain laborers during the progress of their work,\r\nas is erroneously taught. Laborers are maintained by their labor, the\r\nman who produces, in whole or in part, anything that will exchange for\r\narticles of maintenance, virtually producing that maintenance.\r\n\r\nCapital, therefore, does not limit industry, as is erroneously taught,\r\nthe only limit to industry being the access to natural material. But\r\ncapital may limit the form of industry and the productiveness of\r\nindustry, by limiting the use of tools and the division of labor.\r\n\r\nThat capital may limit the form of industry is clear. Without the\r\nfactory, there could be no factory operatives; without the sewing\r\nmachine, no machine sewing; without the plow, no plowman; and without\r\na great capital engaged in exchange, industry could not take the\r\nmany special forms which are concerned with exchanges. It is also as\r\nclear that the want of tools must greatly limit the productiveness\r\nof industry. If the farmer must use the spade because he has not\r\ncapital enough for a plow, the sickle instead of the reaping machine,\r\nthe flail instead of the thresher; if the machinist must rely upon\r\nthe chisel for cutting iron; the weaver on the hand loom, and so\r\non, the productiveness of industry cannot be a tithe of what it is\r\nwhen aided by capital in the shape of the best tools now in use.\r\nNor could the division of labor go further than the very rudest and\r\nalmost imperceptible beginnings, nor the exchanges which make it\r\npossible extend beyond the nearest neighbors, unless a portion of the\r\nthings produced were constantly kept in stock or in transit. Even the\r\npursuits of hunting, fishing, gathering nuts, and making weapons\r\ncould not be specialized so that an individual could devote himself to\r\nany one, unless some part of what was procured by each was reserved\r\nfrom immediate consumption, so that he who devoted himself to the\r\nprocurement of things of one kind could obtain the others as he wanted\r\nthem, and could make the good luck of one day supply the shortcomings\r\nof the next. While to permit the minute subdivision of labor that is\r\ncharacteristic of, and necessary to, high civilization, a great amount\r\nof wealth of all descriptions must be constantly kept in stock or in\r\ntransit. To enable the resident of a civilized community to exchange\r\nhis labor at option with the labor of those around him and with the\r\nlabor of men in the most remote parts of the globe, there must be\r\nstocks of goods in warehouses, in stores, in the holds of ships, and in\r\nrailway cars, just as to enable the denizen of a great city to draw at\r\nwill a cupful of water, there must be thousands of millions of gallons\r\nstored in reservoirs and moving through miles of pipe.\r\n\r\nBut to say that capital may limit the form of industry or the\r\nproductiveness of industry is a very different thing from saying that\r\ncapital limits industry. For the dictum of the current political\r\neconomy that “capital limits industry,” means not that capital limits\r\nthe form of labor or the productiveness of labor, but that it limits\r\nthe exertion of labor. This proposition derives its plausibility\r\nfrom the assumption that capital supplies labor with materials and\r\nmaintenance—an assumption that we have seen to be unfounded, and which\r\nis indeed transparently preposterous the moment it is remembered that\r\ncapital is produced by labor, and hence that there must be labor before\r\nthere can be capital. Capital may limit the form of industry and the\r\nproductiveness of industry; but this is not to say that there could be\r\nno industry without capital, any more than it is to say that without\r\nthe power loom there could be no weaving; without the sewing machine\r\nno sewing; no cultivation without the plow; or that in a community of\r\none, like that of Robinson Crusoe, there could be no labor because\r\nthere could be no exchange.\r\n\r\nAnd to say that capital _may_ limit the form and productiveness of\r\nindustry is a different thing from saying that capital _does_. For the\r\ncases in which it can be truly said that the form of productiveness\r\nof the industry of a community is limited by its capital, will, I\r\nthink, appear upon examination to be more theoretical than real.\r\nIt is evident that in such a country as Mexico or Tunis the larger\r\nand more general use of capital would greatly change the forms of\r\nindustry and enormously increase its productiveness; and it is often\r\nsaid of such countries that they need capital for the development of\r\ntheir resources. But is there not something back of this—a want which\r\nincludes the want of capital? Is it not the rapacity and abuses of\r\ngovernment, the insecurity of property, the ignorance and prejudice of\r\nthe people, that prevent the accumulation and use of capital? Is not\r\nthe real limitation in these things, and not in the want of capital,\r\nwhich would not be used even if placed there? We can, of course,\r\nimagine a community in which the want of capital would be the only\r\nobstacle to an increased productiveness of labor, but it is only by\r\nimagining a conjunction of conditions that seldom, if ever, occurs,\r\nexcept by accident or as a passing phase. A community in which capital\r\nhas been swept away by war, conflagration, or convulsion of nature,\r\nand, possibly, a community composed of civilized people just settled in\r\na new land, seem to me to furnish the only examples. Yet how quickly\r\nthe capital habitually used is reproduced in a community that has been\r\nswept by war, has long been noticed, while the rapid production of the\r\ncapital it can, or is disposed to use, is equally noticeable in the\r\ncase of a new community.\r\n\r\nI am unable to think of any other than such rare and passing conditions\r\nin which the productiveness of labor is really limited by the want of\r\ncapital. For, although there may be in a community individuals who from\r\nwant of capital cannot apply their labor as efficiently as they would,\r\nyet so long as there is a sufficiency of capital in the community at\r\nlarge, the real limitation is not the want of capital, but the want\r\nof its proper distribution. If bad government rob the laborer of his\r\ncapital, if unjust laws take from the producer the wealth with which\r\nhe would assist production, and hand it over to those who are mere\r\npensioners upon industry, the real limitation to the effectiveness\r\nof labor is in misgovernment, and not in want of capital. And so of\r\nignorance, or custom, or other conditions which prevent the use of\r\ncapital. It is they, not the want of capital, that really constitute\r\nthe limitation. To give a circular saw to a Terra del Fuegan, a\r\nlocomotive to a Bedouin Arab, or a sewing machine to a Flathead squaw,\r\nwould not be to add to the efficiency of their labor. Neither does it\r\nseem possible by giving anything else to add to their capital, for any\r\nwealth beyond what they had been accustomed to use as capital would\r\nbe consumed or suffered to waste. It is not the want of seeds and\r\ntools that keeps the Apache and the Sioux from cultivating the soil.\r\nIf provided with seeds and tools they would not use them productively\r\nunless at the same time restrained from wandering and taught to\r\ncultivate the soil. If all the capital of a London were given them in\r\ntheir present condition, it would simply cease to be capital, for they\r\nwould only use productively such infinitesimal part as might assist in\r\nthe chase, and would not even use that until all the edible part of the\r\nstock thus showered upon them had been consumed. Yet such capital as\r\nthey do want they manage to acquire, and in some forms in spite of the\r\ngreatest difficulties. These wild tribes hunt and fight with the best\r\nweapons that American and English factories produce, keeping up with\r\nthe latest improvements. It is only as they became civilized that they\r\nwould care for such other capital as the civilized state requires, or\r\nthat it would be of any use to them.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of George IV., some returning missionaries took with them\r\nto England a New Zealand chief called Hongi. His noble appearance\r\nand beautiful tatooing attracted much attention, and when about to\r\nreturn to his people he was presented by the monarch and some of the\r\nreligious societies with a considerable stock of tools, agricultural\r\ninstruments, and seeds. The grateful New Zealander did use this capital\r\nin the production of food, but it was in a manner of which his English\r\nentertainers little dreamed. In Sydney, on his way back, he exchanged\r\nit all for arms and ammunition, with which, on getting home, he began\r\nwar against another tribe with such success that on the first battle\r\nfield three hundred of his prisoners were cooked and eaten, Hongi\r\nhaving preluded the main repast by scooping out and swallowing the\r\neyes and sucking the warm blood of his mortally wounded adversary, the\r\nopposing chief.[13] But now that their once constant wars have ceased,\r\nand the remnant of the Maoris have largely adopted European habits,\r\nthere are among them many who have and use considerable amounts of\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nLikewise it would be a mistake to attribute the simple modes of\r\nproduction and exchange which are resorted to in new communities solely\r\nto a want of capital. These modes, which require little capital, are\r\nin themselves rude and inefficient, but when the conditions of such\r\ncommunities are considered, they will be found in reality the most\r\neffective. A great factory with all the latest improvements is the most\r\nefficient instrument that has yet been devised for turning wool or\r\ncotton into cloth, but only so where large quantities are to be made.\r\nThe cloth required for a little village could be made with far less\r\nlabor by the spinning wheel and hand loom. A perfecting press will, for\r\neach man required, print many thousand impressions while a man and a\r\nboy would be printing a hundred with a Stanhope or Franklin press; yet\r\nto work off the small edition of a country newspaper the old-fashioned\r\npress is by far the most efficient machine. To carry occasionally two\r\nor three passengers, a canoe is a better instrument than a steamboat;\r\na few sacks of flour can be transported with less expenditure of\r\nlabor by a pack horse than by a railroad train; to put a great stock\r\nof goods into a cross-roads store in the backwoods would be but to\r\nwaste capital. And, generally, it will be found that the rude devices\r\nof production and exchange which obtain among the sparse populations\r\nof new countries result not so much from the want of capital as from\r\ninability profitably to employ it.\r\n\r\nAs, no matter how much water is poured in, there can never be in a\r\nbucket more than a bucketful, so no greater amount of wealth will be\r\nused as capital than is required by the machinery of production and\r\nexchange that under all the existing conditions—intelligence, habit,\r\nsecurity, density of population, etc.—best suit the people. And I am\r\ninclined to think that as a general rule this amount will be had—that\r\nthe social organism secretes, as it were, the necessary amount of\r\ncapital just as the human organism in a healthy condition secretes the\r\nrequisite fat.\r\n\r\nBut whether the amount of capital ever does limit the productiveness\r\nof industry, and thus fix a maximum which wages cannot exceed, it is\r\nevident that it is not from any scarcity of capital that the poverty\r\nof the masses in civilized countries proceeds. For not only do wages\r\nnowhere reach the limit fixed by the productiveness of industry, but\r\nwages are relatively the lowest where capital is most abundant. The\r\ntools and machinery of production are in all the most progressive\r\ncountries evidently in excess of the use made of them, and any prospect\r\nof remunerative employment brings out more than the capital needed. The\r\nbucket is not only full; it is overflowing. So evident is this, that\r\nnot only among the ignorant, but by men of high economic reputation, is\r\nindustrial depression attributed to the abundance of machinery and the\r\naccumulation of capital; and war, which is the destruction of capital,\r\nis looked upon as the cause of brisk trade and high wages—an idea\r\nstrangely enough, so great is the confusion of thought on such matters,\r\ncountenanced by many who hold that capital employs labor and pays wages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur purpose in this inquiry is to solve the problem to which so many\r\nself-contradictory answers are given. In ascertaining clearly what\r\ncapital really is and what capital really does, we have made the\r\nfirst, and an all-important step. But it is only a first step. Let us\r\nrecapitulate and proceed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the current theory that wages depend upon the ratio\r\nbetween the number of laborers and the amount of capital devoted to the\r\nemployment of labor is inconsistent with the general fact that wages\r\nand interest do not rise and fall inversely, but conjointly.\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy having led us to an examination of the grounds of\r\nthe theory, we have seen, further, that, contrary to the current\r\nidea, wages are not drawn from capital at all, but come directly from\r\nthe produce of the labor for which they are paid. We have seen that\r\ncapital does not advance wages or subsist laborers, but that its\r\nfunctions are to assist labor in production with tools, seed, etc., and\r\nwith the wealth required to carry on exchanges.\r\n\r\nWe are thus irresistibly led to practical conclusions so important as\r\namply to justify the pains taken to make sure of them.\r\n\r\nFor if wages are drawn, not from capital, but from the produce of\r\nlabor, the current theories as to the relations of capital and labor\r\nare invalid, and all remedies, whether proposed by professors of\r\npolitical economy or workingmen, which look to the alleviation of\r\npoverty either by the increase of capital or the restriction of the\r\nnumber of laborers or the efficiency of their work, must be condemned.\r\n\r\nIf each laborer in performing the labor really creates the fund from\r\nwhich his wages are drawn, then wages cannot be diminished by the\r\nincrease of laborers, but, on the contrary, as the efficiency of labor\r\nmanifestly increases with the number of laborers, the more laborers,\r\nother things being equal, the higher should wages be.\r\n\r\nBut this necessary proviso, “other things being equal,” brings us to a\r\nquestion which must be considered and disposed of before we can further\r\nproceed. That question is, Do the productive powers of nature tend\r\nto diminish with the increasing drafts made upon them by increasing\r\npopulation?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] New Zealand and its Inhabitants.

The current doctrine as to the derivation and law of wages\r\nfinds its strongest support in a doctrine as generally accepted—the\r\ndoctrine to which Malthus has given his name—that population naturally\r\ntends to increase faster than subsistence. These two doctrines, fitting\r\nin with each other, frame the answer which the current political\r\neconomy gives to the great problem we are endeavoring to solve.\r\n\r\nIn what has preceded, the current doctrine that wages are determined\r\nby the ratio between capital and laborers has, I think, been shown to\r\nbe so utterly baseless as to excite surprise as to how it could so\r\ngenerally and so long obtain. It is not to be wondered at that such a\r\ntheory should have arisen in a state of society where the great body of\r\nlaborers seem to depend for employment and wages upon a separate class\r\nof capitalists, nor yet that under these conditions it should have\r\nmaintained itself among the masses of men, who rarely take the trouble\r\nto separate the real from the apparent. But it is surprising that a\r\ntheory which on examination appears to be so groundless could have been\r\nsuccessively accepted by so many acute thinkers as have during the\r\npresent century devoted their powers to the elucidation and development\r\nof the science of political economy.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this otherwise unaccountable fact is to be found in\r\nthe general acceptance of the Malthusian theory. The current theory of\r\nwages has never been fairly put upon its trial, because, backed by the\r\nMalthusian theory, it has seemed in the minds of political economists a\r\nself-evident truth. These two theories mutually blend with, strengthen,\r\nand defend each other, while they both derive additional support from a\r\nprinciple brought prominently forward in the discussions of the theory\r\nof rent—viz., that past a certain point the application of capital and\r\nlabor to land yields a diminishing return. Together they give such\r\nan explanation of the phenomena presented in a highly organized and\r\nadvancing society as seems to fit all the facts, and which has thus\r\nprevented closer investigation.\r\n\r\nWhich of these two theories is entitled to historical precedence it is\r\nhard to say. The theory of population was not formulated in such a way\r\nas to give it the standing of a scientific dogma until after that had\r\nbeen done for the theory of wages. But they naturally spring up and\r\ngrow with each other, and were both held in a form more or less crude\r\nlong prior to any attempt to construct a system of political economy.\r\nIt is evident, from several passages, that though he never fully\r\ndeveloped it, the Malthusian theory was in rudimentary form present in\r\nthe mind of Adam Smith, and to this, it seems to me, must be largely\r\ndue the misdirection which on the subject of wages his speculations\r\ntook. But, however this may be, so closely are the two theories\r\nconnected, so completely do they complement each other, that Buckle,\r\nreviewing the history of the development of political economy in his\r\n“Examination of the Scotch Intellect during the Eighteenth Century,”\r\nattributes mainly to Malthus the honor of “decisively proving” the\r\ncurrent theory of wages by advancing the current theory of the pressure\r\nof population upon subsistence. He says in his “History of Civilization\r\nin England,” Vol. 3, Chap. 5:\r\n\r\n  “Scarcely had the Eighteenth Century passed away when it was\r\n decisively proved that the reward of labor depends solely on two\r\n things; namely, the magnitude of that national fund out of which all\r\n labor is paid, and the number of laborers among whom the fund is to\r\n be divided. This vast step in our knowledge is due, mainly, though\r\n not entirely, to Malthus, whose work on population, besides marking\r\n an epoch in the history of speculative thought, has already produced\r\n considerable practical results, and will probably give rise to others\r\n more considerable still. It was published in 1798; so that Adam Smith,\r\n who died in 1790, missed what to him would have been the intense\r\n pleasure of seeing how, in it, his own views were expanded rather\r\n than corrected. Indeed, it is certain that without Smith there would\r\n have been no Malthus; that is, unless Smith had laid the foundation,\r\n Malthus could not have raised the superstructure.”\r\n\r\nThe famous doctrine which ever since its enunciation has so powerfully\r\ninfluenced thought, not alone in the province of political economy,\r\nbut in regions of even higher speculation, was formulated by Malthus\r\nin the proposition that, as shown by the growth of the North American\r\ncolonies, the natural tendency of population is to double itself\r\nat least every twenty-five years, thus increasing in a geometrical\r\nratio, while the subsistence that can be obtained from land “under\r\ncircumstances the most favorable to human industry could not possibly\r\nbe made to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio, or by an\r\naddition every twenty-five years of a quantity equal to what it at\r\npresent produces.” “The necessary effects of these two different\r\nrates of increase, when brought together,” Mr. Malthus naïvely goes\r\non to say, “will be very striking.” And thus (Chap. I) he brings them\r\ntogether:\r\n\r\n “Let us call the population of this island eleven millions; and\r\n suppose the present produce equal to the easy support of such a\r\n number. In the first twenty-five years the population would be\r\n twenty-two millions, and the food being also doubled, the means of\r\n subsistence would be equal to this increase. In the next twenty-five\r\n years the population would be forty-four millions, and the means of\r\n subsistence only equal to the support of thirty-three millions. In the\r\n next period the population would be equal to eighty-eight millions,\r\n and the means of subsistence just equal to the support of half that\r\n number. And at the conclusion of the first century, the population\r\n would be a hundred and seventy-six millions, and the means of\r\n subsistence only equal to the support of fifty-five millions; leaving\r\n a population of a hundred and twenty-one millions totally unprovided\r\n for.\r\n\r\n “Taking the whole earth instead of this island, emigration would of\r\n course be excluded; and supposing the present population equal to a\r\n thousand millions, the human species would increase as the numbers\r\n 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and subsistence as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n 6, 7, 8, 9. In two centuries the population would be to the means of\r\n subsistence as 256 to 9; in three centuries, 4,096 to 13, and in two\r\n thousand years the difference would be almost incalculable.”\r\n\r\nSuch a result is of course prevented by the physical fact that no\r\nmore people can exist than can find subsistence, and hence Malthus’\r\nconclusion is, that this tendency of population to indefinite increase\r\nmust be held back either by moral restraint upon the reproductive\r\nfaculty, or by the various causes which increase mortality, which he\r\nresolves into vice and misery. Such causes as prevent propagation he\r\nstyles the preventive check; such causes as increase mortality he\r\nstyles the positive check. This is the famous Malthusian doctrine, as\r\npromulgated by Malthus himself in the “Essay on Population.”\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to dwell upon the fallacy involved in the\r\nassumption of geometrical and arithmetical rates of increase, a play\r\nupon proportions which hardly rises to the dignity of that in the\r\nfamiliar puzzle of the hare and the tortoise, in which the hare is\r\nmade to chase the tortoise through all eternity without coming up with\r\nhim. For this assumption is not necessary to the Malthusian doctrine,\r\nor at least is expressly repudiated by some of those who fully accept\r\nthat doctrine; as, for instance, John Stuart Mill, who speaks of it\r\nas “an unlucky attempt to give precision to things which do not\r\nadmit of it, which every person capable of reasoning must see is\r\nwholly superfluous to the argument.”[14] The essence of the Malthusian\r\ndoctrine is, that population tends to increase faster than the power of\r\nproviding food, and whether this difference be stated as a geometrical\r\nratio for population and an arithmetical ratio for subsistence, as\r\nby Malthus; or as a constant ratio for population and a diminishing\r\nratio for subsistence, as by Mill, is only a matter of statement. The\r\nvital point, on which both agree, is, to use the words of Malthus,\r\n“that there is a natural tendency and constant effort in population to\r\nincrease beyond the means of subsistence.”\r\n\r\nThe Malthusian doctrine, as at present held, may be thus stated in its\r\nstrongest and least objectionable form:\r\n\r\nThat population, constantly tending to increase, must, when\r\nunrestrained, ultimately press against the limits of subsistence, not\r\nas against a fixed, but as against an elastic barrier, which makes the\r\nprocurement of subsistence progressively more and more difficult. And\r\nthus, wherever reproduction has had time to assert its power, and is\r\nunchecked by prudence, there must exist that degree of want which will\r\nkeep population within the bounds of subsistence.\r\n\r\nAlthough in reality not more repugnant to the sense of harmonious\r\nadaptation by creative beneficence and wisdom than the complacent\r\nno-theory which throws the responsibility for poverty and its\r\nconcomitants upon the inscrutable decrees of Providence, without\r\nattempting to trace them, this theory, in avowedly making vice and\r\nsuffering the necessary results of a natural instinct with which are\r\nlinked the purest and sweetest affections, comes rudely in collision\r\nwith ideas deeply rooted in the human mind, and it was, as soon as\r\nformally promulgated, fought with a bitterness in which zeal was often\r\nmore manifest than logic. But it has triumphantly withstood the ordeal,\r\nand in spite of the refutations of the Godwins, the denunciations of\r\nthe Cobbetts, and all the shafts that argument, sarcasm, ridicule, and\r\nsentiment could direct against it, to-day it stands in the world of\r\nthought as an accepted truth, which compels the recognition even of\r\nthose who would fain disbelieve it.\r\n\r\nThe causes of its triumph, the sources of its strength, are not\r\nobscure. Seemingly backed by an indisputable arithmetical truth—that a\r\ncontinuously increasing population must eventually exceed the capacity\r\nof the earth to furnish food or even standing room, the Malthusian\r\ntheory is supported by analogies in the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\r\nwhere life everywhere beats wastefully against the barriers that hold\r\nits different species in check—analogies to which the course of modern\r\nthought, in leveling distinctions between different forms of life, has\r\ngiven a greater and greater weight; and it is apparently corroborated\r\nby many obvious facts, such as the prevalence of poverty, vice, and\r\nmisery amid dense populations; the general effect of material progress\r\nin increasing population without relieving pauperism; the rapid growth\r\nof numbers in newly settled countries and the evident retardation of\r\nincrease in more densely settled countries by the mortality among the\r\nclass condemned to want.\r\n\r\nThe Malthusian theory furnishes a general principle which accounts\r\nfor these and similar facts, and accounts for them in a way which\r\nharmonizes with the doctrine that wages are drawn from capital, and\r\nwith all the principles that are deduced from it. According to the\r\ncurrent doctrine of wages, wages fall as increase in the number of\r\nlaborers necessitates a more minute division of capital; according\r\nto the Malthusian theory, poverty appears as increase in population\r\nnecessitates the more minute division of subsistence. It requires but\r\nthe identification of capital with subsistence, and number of laborers\r\nwith population, an identification made in the current treatises on\r\npolitical economy, where the terms are often converted, to make the\r\ntwo propositions as identical formally as they are substantially.[15]\r\nAnd thus it is, as stated by Buckle in the passage previously quoted,\r\nthat the theory of population advanced by Malthus has appeared to prove\r\ndecisively the theory of wages advanced by Smith.\r\n\r\nRicardo, who a few years subsequent to the publication of the “Essay on\r\nPopulation” corrected the mistake into which Smith had fallen as to the\r\nnature and cause of rent, furnished the Malthusian theory an additional\r\nsupport by calling attention to the fact that rent would increase as\r\nthe necessities of increasing population forced cultivation to less\r\nand less productive lands, or to less and less productive points on\r\nthe same lands, thus explaining the rise of rent. In this way was\r\nformed a triple combination, by which the Malthusian theory has been\r\nbuttressed on both sides—the previously received doctrine of wages and\r\nthe subsequently received doctrine of rent exhibiting in this view but\r\nspecial examples of the operation of the general principle to which the\r\nname of Malthus has been attached—the fall in wages and the rise in\r\nrents which come with increasing population being but modes in which\r\nthe pressure of population upon subsistence shows itself.\r\n\r\nThus taking its place in the very framework of political economy (for\r\nthe science as currently accepted has undergone no material change or\r\nimprovement since the time of Ricardo, though in some minor points\r\nit has been cleared and illustrated), the Malthusian theory, though\r\nrepugnant to sentiments before alluded to, is not repugnant to other\r\nideas, which, in older countries at least, generally prevail among the\r\nworking classes; but, on the contrary, like the theory of wages by\r\nwhich it is supported and in turn supports, it harmonizes with them. To\r\nthe mechanic or operative the cause of low wages and of the inability\r\nto get employment is obviously the competition caused by the pressure\r\nof numbers, and in the squalid abodes of poverty what seems clearer\r\nthan that there are too many people?\r\n\r\nBut the great cause of the triumph of this theory is, that, instead\r\nof menacing any vested right or antagonizing any powerful interest,\r\nit is eminently soothing and reassuring to the classes who, wielding\r\nthe power of wealth, largely dominate thought. At a time when old\r\nsupports were falling away, it came to the rescue of the special\r\nprivileges by which a few monopolize so much of the good things of this\r\nworld, proclaiming a natural cause for the want and misery which, if\r\nattributed to political institutions, must condemn every government\r\nunder which they exist. The “Essay on Population” was avowedly a reply\r\nto William Godwin’s “Inquiry concerning Political Justice,” a work\r\nasserting the principle of human equality; and its purpose was to\r\njustify existing inequality by shifting the responsibility for it from\r\nhuman institutions to the laws of the Creator. There was nothing new\r\nin this, for Wallace, nearly forty years before, had brought forward\r\nthe danger of excessive multiplication as the answer to the demands of\r\njustice for an equal distribution of wealth; but the circumstances of\r\nthe times were such as to make the same idea, when brought forward by\r\nMalthus, peculiarly grateful to a powerful class, in whom an intense\r\nfear of any questioning of the existing state of things had been\r\ngenerated by the outburst of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nNow, as then, the Malthusian doctrine parries the demand for reform,\r\nand shelters selfishness from question and from conscience by the\r\ninterposition of an inevitable necessity. It furnishes a philosophy by\r\nwhich Dives as he feasts can shut out the image of Lazarus who faints\r\nwith hunger at his door; by which wealth may complacently button up\r\nits pocket when poverty asks an alms, and the rich Christian bend\r\non Sundays in a nicely upholstered pew to implore the good gifts of\r\nthe All Father without any feeling of responsibility for the squalid\r\nmisery that is festering but a square away. For poverty, want, and\r\nstarvation are by this theory not chargeable either to individual\r\ngreed or to social mal-adjustments; they are the inevitable results\r\nof universal laws, with which, if it were not impious, it were as\r\nhopeless to quarrel as with the law of gravitation. In this view, he\r\nwho in the midst of want has accumulated wealth, has but fenced in a\r\nlittle oasis from the driving sand which else would have overwhelmed\r\nit. He has gained for himself, but has hurt nobody. And even if the\r\nrich were literally to obey the injunctions of Christ and divide their\r\nwealth among the poor, nothing would be gained. Population would be\r\nincreased, only to press again upon the limits of subsistence or\r\ncapital, and the equality that would be produced would be but the\r\nequality of common misery. And thus reforms which would interfere with\r\nthe interests of any powerful class are discouraged as hopeless. As the\r\nmoral law forbids any forestalling of the methods by which the natural\r\nlaw gets rid of surplus population and thus holds in check a tendency\r\nto increase potent enough to pack the surface of the globe with human\r\nbeings as sardines are packed in a box, nothing can really be done,\r\neither by individual or by combined effort, to extirpate poverty,\r\nsave to trust to the efficacy of education and preach the necessity of\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\nA theory that, falling in with the habits of thought of the poorer\r\nclasses, thus justifies the greed of the rich and the selfishness of\r\nthe powerful, will spread quickly and strike its roots deep. This has\r\nbeen the case with the theory advanced by Malthus.\r\n\r\nAnd of late years the Malthusian theory has received new support in\r\nthe rapid change of ideas as to the origin of man and the genesis of\r\nspecies. That Buckle was right in saying that the promulgation of\r\nthe Malthusian theory marked an epoch in the history of speculative\r\nthought could, it seems to me, be easily shown; yet to trace its\r\ninfluence in the higher domains of philosophy, of which Buckle’s own\r\nwork is an example, would, though extremely interesting, carry us\r\nbeyond the scope of this investigation. But how much be reflex and how\r\nmuch original, the support which is given to the Malthusian theory\r\nby the new philosophy of development, now rapidly spreading in every\r\ndirection, must be noted in any estimate of the sources from which\r\nthis theory derives its present strength. As in political economy, the\r\nsupport received from the doctrine of wages and the doctrine of rent\r\ncombined to raise the Malthusian theory to the rank of a central truth,\r\nso the extension of similar ideas to the development of life in all its\r\nforms has the effect of giving it a still higher and more impregnable\r\nposition. Agassiz, who, to the day of his death, was a strenuous\r\nopponent of the new philosophy, spoke of Darwinism as “Malthus all\r\nover,”[16] and Darwin himself says the struggle for existence “is the\r\ndoctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms.”[17]\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, seem to me exactly correct to say that the theory\r\nof development by natural selection or survival of the fittest is\r\nextended Malthusianism, for the doctrine of Malthus did not originally\r\nand does not necessarily involve the idea of progression. But this\r\nwas soon added to it. McCulloch[18] attributes to the “principle of\r\nincrease” social improvement and the progress of the arts, and declares\r\nthat the poverty that it engenders acts as a powerful stimulus to the\r\ndevelopment of industry, the extension of science and the accumulation\r\nof wealth by the upper and middle classes, without which stimulus\r\nsociety would quickly sink into apathy and decay. What is this but the\r\nrecognition in regard to human society of the developing effects of the\r\n“struggle for existence” and “survival of the fittest,” which we are\r\nnow told on the authority of natural science have been the means which\r\nNature has employed to bring forth all the infinitely diversified and\r\nwonderfully adapted forms which the teeming life of the globe assumes?\r\nWhat is it but the recognition of the force, which, seemingly cruel and\r\nremorseless, has yet in the course of unnumbered ages developed the\r\nhigher from the lower type, differentiated the man and the monkey, and\r\nmade the Nineteenth Century succeed the age of stone?\r\n\r\nThus commended and seemingly proved, thus linked and buttressed, the\r\nMalthusian theory—the doctrine that poverty is due to the pressure\r\nof population against subsistence, or, to put it in its other form,\r\nthe doctrine that the tendency to increase in the number of laborers\r\nmust always tend to reduce wages to the minimum on which laborers can\r\nreproduce—is now generally accepted as an unquestionable truth, in\r\nthe light of which social phenomena are to be explained, just as for\r\nages the phenomena of the sidereal heavens were explained upon the\r\nsupposition of the fixity of the earth, or the facts of geology upon\r\nthat of the literal inspiration of the Mosaic record. If authority were\r\nalone to be considered, formally to deny this doctrine would require\r\nalmost as much audacity as that of the colored preacher who recently\r\nstarted out on a crusade against the opinion that the earth moves\r\naround the sun, for in one form or another, the Malthusian doctrine has\r\nreceived in the intellectual world an almost universal indorsement,\r\nand in the best as in the most common literature of the day may be\r\nseen cropping out in every direction. It is indorsed by economists\r\nand by statesmen, by historians and by natural investigators; by\r\nsocial science congresses and by trade unions; by churchmen and by\r\nmaterialists; by conservatives of the strictest sect and by the most\r\nradical of radicals. It is held and habitually reasoned from by many\r\nwho never heard of Malthus and who have not the slightest idea of what\r\nhis theory is.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as the grounds of the current theory of wages have\r\nvanished when subjected to a candid examination, so, do I believe, will\r\nvanish the grounds of this, its twin. In proving that wages are not\r\ndrawn from capital we have raised this Antæus from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Principles of Political Economy, Book II, Chap. IX., Sec. VI.—Yet\r\nnotwithstanding what Mill says, it is clear that Malthus himself lays\r\ngreat stress upon his geometrical and arithmetical ratios, and it\r\nis also probable that it is to these ratios that Malthus is largely\r\nindebted for his fame, as they supplied one of those high-sounding\r\nformulas that with many people carry far more weight than the clearest\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\n[15] The effect of the Malthusian doctrine upon the definitions of\r\ncapital may, I think, be seen by comparing (see pp. 32, 33, 34) the\r\ndefinition of Smith, who wrote prior to Malthus, with the definitions\r\nof Ricardo, McCulloch and Mill, who wrote subsequently.\r\n\r\n[16] Address before Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, 1872.\r\nReport U.

The facts\r\ncited to show this simply show that where, owing to the sparseness\r\nof population, as in new countries, or where, owing to the unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth, as among the poorer classes in old countries,\r\nhuman life is occupied with the physical necessities of existence,\r\nthe tendency to reproduce is at a rate which would, were it to go on\r\nunchecked, some time exceed subsistence. But it is not a legitimate\r\ninference from this that the tendency to reproduce would show itself\r\nin the same force where population was sufficiently dense and wealth\r\ndistributed with sufficient evenness to lift a whole community above\r\nthe necessity of devoting their energies to a struggle for mere\r\nexistence. Nor can it be assumed that the tendency to reproduce, by\r\ncausing poverty, must prevent the existence of such a community; for\r\nthis, manifestly, would be assuming the very point at issue, and\r\nreasoning in a circle. And even if it be admitted that the tendency to\r\nmultiply must ultimately produce poverty, it cannot from this alone\r\nbe predicated of existing poverty that it is due to this cause, until\r\nit be shown that there are no other causes which can account for it—a\r\nthing in the present state of government, laws, and customs, manifestly\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThis is abundantly shown in the “Essay on Population” itself. This\r\nfamous book, which is much oftener spoken of than read, is still well\r\nworth perusal, if only as a literary curiosity. The contrast between\r\nthe merits of the book itself and the effect it has produced, or is\r\nat least credited with (for though Sir James Stewart, Mr. Townsend,\r\nand others, share with Malthus the glory of discovering “the principle\r\nof population,” it was the publication of the “Essay on Population”\r\nthat brought it prominently forward), is, it seems to me, one of the\r\nmost remarkable things in the history of literature; and it is easy to\r\nunderstand how Godwin, whose “Political Justice” provoked the “Essay\r\non Population,” should until his old age have disdained a reply. It\r\nbegins with the assumption that population tends to increase in a\r\ngeometrical ratio, while subsistence can at best be made to increase\r\nonly in an arithmetical ratio—an assumption just as valid, and no\r\nmore so, than it would be, from the fact that a puppy doubled the\r\nlength of his tail while he added so many pounds to his weight, to\r\nassert a geometric progression of tail and an arithmetical progression\r\nof weight. And, the inference from the assumption is just such as\r\nSwift in satire might have credited to the savans of a previously\r\ndogless island, who, by bringing these two ratios together, might\r\ndeduce the very “striking consequence” that by the time the dog grew\r\nto a weight of fifty pounds his tail would be over a mile long, and\r\nextremely difficult to wag, and hence recommend the prudential check\r\nof a bandage as the only alternative to the positive check of constant\r\namputations. Commencing with such an absurdity, the essay includes a\r\nlong argument for the imposition of a duty on the importation, and\r\nthe payment of a bounty for the exportation of corn, an idea that has\r\nlong since been sent to the limbo of exploded fallacies. And it is\r\nmarked throughout the argumentative portions by passages which show on\r\nthe part of the reverend gentleman the most ridiculous incapacity for\r\nlogical thought—as, for instance, that if wages were to be increased\r\nfrom eighteen pence or two shillings per day to five shillings, meat\r\nwould necessarily increase in price from eight or nine pence to two or\r\nthree shillings per pound, and the condition of the laboring classes\r\nwould therefore not be improved, a statement to which I can think of\r\nno parallel so close as a proposition I once heard a certain printer\r\ngravely advance—that because an author, whom he had known, was forty\r\nyears old when he was twenty, the author must now be eighty years old\r\nbecause he (the printer) was forty. This confusion of thought does not\r\nmerely crop out here and there; it characterizes the whole work.[19]\r\nThe main body of the book is taken up with what is in reality a\r\nrefutation of the theory which the book advances, for Malthus’\r\nreview of what he calls the positive checks to population is simply\r\nthe showing that the results which he attributes to over-population\r\nactually arise from other causes. Of all the cases cited, and pretty\r\nmuch the whole globe is passed over in the survey, in which vice and\r\nmisery check increase by limiting marriages or shortening the term of\r\nhuman life, there is not a single case in which the vice and misery can\r\nbe traced to an actual increase in the number of mouths over the power\r\nof the accompanying hands to feed them; but in every case the vice and\r\nmisery are shown to spring either from unsocial ignorance and rapacity,\r\nor from bad government, unjust laws or destructive warfare.\r\n\r\nNor what Malthus failed to show has any one since him shown. The globe\r\nmay be surveyed and history may be reviewed in vain for any instance\r\nof a considerable country[20] in which poverty and want can be fairly\r\nattributed to the pressure of an increasing population. Whatever be the\r\npossible dangers involved in the power of human increase, they have\r\nnever yet appeared. Whatever may some time be, this never yet has been\r\nthe evil that has afflicted mankind. Population always tending to\r\noverpass the limit of subsistence! How is it, then, that this globe of\r\nours, after all the thousands, and it is now thought millions, of years\r\nthat man has been upon the earth, is yet so thinly populated? How is\r\nit, then, that so many of the hives of human life are now deserted—that\r\nonce cultivated fields are rank with jungle, and the wild beast licks\r\nher cubs where once were busy haunts of men?\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, that, as we count our increasing millions, we are apt\r\nto lose sight of—nevertheless it is a fact—that in what we know of\r\nthe world’s history decadence of population is as common as increase.\r\nWhether the aggregate population of the earth is now greater than at\r\nany previous epoch is a speculation which can deal only with guesses.\r\nSince Montesquieu, in the early part of the last century, asserted,\r\nwhat was then probably the prevailing impression, that the population\r\nof the earth had, since the Christian era, greatly declined, opinion\r\nhas run the other way. But the tendency of recent investigation\r\nand exploration has been to give greater credit to what have been\r\ndeemed the exaggerated accounts of ancient historians and travelers,\r\nand to reveal indications of denser populations and more advanced\r\ncivilizations than had before been suspected, as well as of a higher\r\nantiquity in the human race. And in basing our estimates of population\r\nupon the development of trade, the advance of the arts, and the size\r\nof cities, we are apt to underrate the density of population which the\r\nintensive cultivations, characteristic of the earlier civilizations,\r\nare capable of maintaining—especially where irrigation is resorted\r\nto. As we may see from the closely cultivated districts of China and\r\nEurope a very great population of simple habits can readily exist with\r\nvery little commerce and a much lower stage of those arts in which\r\nmodern progress has been most marked, and without that tendency to\r\nconcentrate in cities which modern populations show.[21]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the only continent which we can be sure now contains\r\na larger population than ever before is Europe. But this is not true\r\nof all parts of Europe. Certainly Greece, the Mediterranean Islands,\r\nand Turkey in Europe, probably Italy, and possibly Spain, have\r\ncontained larger populations than now, and this may be likewise true of\r\nNorthwestern and parts of Central and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nAmerica also has increased in population during the time we know of\r\nit; but this increase is not so great as is popularly supposed, some\r\nestimates giving to Peru alone at the time of the discovery a greater\r\npopulation than now exists on the whole continent of South America. And\r\nall the indications are that previous to the discovery the population\r\nof America had been declining. What great nations have run their\r\ncourse, what empires have arisen and fallen in “that new world which\r\nis the old,” we can only imagine. But fragments of massive ruins yet\r\nattest a grander pre-Incan civilization; amid the tropical forests of\r\nYucatan and Central America are the remains of great cities forgotten\r\nere the Spanish conquest; Mexico, as Cortez found it, showed the\r\nsuperimposition of barbarism upon a higher social development, while\r\nthrough a great part of what is now the United States are scattered\r\nmounds which prove a once relatively dense population, and here and\r\nthere, as in the Lake Superior copper mines, are traces of higher arts\r\nthan were known to the Indians with whom the whites came in contact.\r\n\r\nAs to Africa there can be no question. Northern Africa can contain but\r\na fraction of the population that it had in ancient times; the Nile\r\nValley once held an enormously greater population than now, while south\r\nof the Sahara there is nothing to show increase within historic times,\r\nand widespread depopulation was certainly caused by the slave trade.\r\n\r\nAs for Asia, which even now contains more than half the human race,\r\nthough it is not much more than half as densely populated as Europe,\r\nthere are indications that both India and China once contained larger\r\npopulations than now, while that great breeding ground of men from\r\nwhich issued swarms that overran both countries and sent great waves\r\nof people rolling upon Europe, must have been once far more populous.\r\nBut the most marked change is in Asia Minor, Syria, Babylonia, Persia,\r\nand in short that vast district which yielded to the conquering arms of\r\nAlexander. Where were once great cities and teeming populations are now\r\nsqualid villages and barren wastes.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange that among all the theories that have been\r\nraised, that of a fixed quantity to human life on this earth has not\r\nbeen broached. It would at least better accord with historical facts\r\nthan that of the constant tendency of population to outrun subsistence.\r\nIt is clear that population has here ebbed and there flowed; its\r\ncenters have changed; new nations have arisen and old nations declined;\r\nsparsely settled districts have become populous and populous districts\r\nhave lost their population; but as far back as we can go without\r\nabandoning ourselves wholly to inference, there is nothing to show\r\ncontinuous increase, or even clearly to show an aggregate increase\r\nfrom time to time. The advance of the pioneers of peoples has, so far\r\nas we can discern, never been into uninhabited lands—their march has\r\nalways been a battle with some other people previously in possession;\r\nbehind dim empires vaguer ghosts of empire loom. That the population\r\nof the world must have had its small beginnings we confidently infer,\r\nfor we know that there was a geologic era when human life could not\r\nhave existed, and we cannot believe that men sprang up all at once, as\r\nfrom the dragon teeth sowed by Cadmus; yet through long vistas, where\r\nhistory, tradition and antiquities shed a light that is lost in faint\r\nglimmers, we may discern large populations. And during these long\r\nperiods the principle of population has not been strong enough fully\r\nto settle the world, or even so far as we can clearly see materially\r\nto increase its aggregate population. Compared with its capacities to\r\nsupport human life the earth as a whole is yet most sparsely populated.\r\n\r\nThere is another broad, general fact which cannot fail to strike any\r\none who, thinking of this subject, extends his view beyond modern\r\nsociety. Malthusianism predicates a universal law—that the natural\r\ntendency of population is to outrun subsistence. If there be such a\r\nlaw, it must, wherever population has attained a certain density,\r\nbecome as obvious as any of the great natural laws which have been\r\neverywhere recognized. How is it, then, that neither in classical\r\ncreeds and codes, nor in those of the Jews, the Egyptians, the Hindoos,\r\nthe Chinese, nor any of the peoples who have lived in close association\r\nand have built up creeds and codes, do we find any injunctions to the\r\npractice of the prudential restraints of Malthus; but that, on the\r\ncontrary, the wisdom of the centuries, the religions of the world, have\r\nalways inculcated ideas of civic and religious duty the very reverse\r\nof those which the current political economy enjoins, and which Annie\r\nBesant is now trying to popularize in England?\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that there have been societies in which the\r\ncommunity guaranteed to every member employment and subsistence. John\r\nStuart Mill says (Book II, Chap. XII, Sec. 2), that to do this without\r\nstate regulation of marriages and births, would be to produce a state\r\nof general misery and degradation. “These consequences,” he says, “have\r\nbeen so often and so clearly pointed out by authors of reputation\r\nthat ignorance of them on the part of educated persons is no longer\r\npardonable.” Yet in Sparta, in Peru, in Paraguay, as in the industrial\r\ncommunities which appear almost everywhere to have constituted the\r\nprimitive agricultural organization, there seems to have been an utter\r\nignorance of these dire consequences of a natural tendency.\r\n\r\nBesides the broad, general facts I have cited, there are facts\r\nof common knowledge which seem utterly inconsistent with such an\r\noverpowering tendency to multiplication. If the tendency to reproduce\r\nbe so strong as Malthusianism supposes, how is it that families so\r\noften become extinct—families in which want is unknown? How is it,\r\nthen, that when every premium is offered by hereditary titles and\r\nhereditary possessions, not alone to the principle of increase, but\r\nto the preservation of genealogical knowledge and the proving up of\r\ndescent, that in such an aristocracy as that of England, so many\r\npeerages should lapse, and the House of Lords be kept up from century\r\nto century only by fresh creations?\r\n\r\nFor the solitary example of a family that has survived any great\r\nlapse of time, even though assured of subsistence and honor, we must\r\ngo to unchangeable China. The descendants of Confucius still exist\r\nthere, and enjoy peculiar privileges and consideration, forming,\r\nin fact, the only hereditary aristocracy. On the presumption that\r\npopulation tends to double every twenty-five years, they should,\r\nin 2,150 years after the death of Confucius, have amounted to\r\n859,559,193,106,709,670,198,710,528 souls. Instead of any such\r\nunimaginable number, the descendants of Confucius, 2,150 years after\r\nhis death, in the reign of Kanghi, numbered 11,000 males, or say 22,000\r\nsouls. This is quite a discrepancy, and is the more striking when it\r\nis remembered that the esteem in which this family is held on account\r\nof their ancestor, “the Most Holy Ancient Teacher,” has prevented\r\nthe operation of the positive check, while the maxims of Confucius\r\ninculcate anything but the prudential check.\r\n\r\nYet, it may be said, that even this increase is a great one. Twenty-two\r\nthousand persons descended from a single pair in 2,150 years is far\r\nshort of the Malthusian rate. Nevertheless, it is suggestive of\r\npossible overcrowding.\r\n\r\nBut consider. Increase of descendants does not show increase of\r\npopulation. It could only do this when the breeding was in and in.\r\nSmith and his wife have a son and daughter, who marry respectively some\r\none else’s daughter and son, and each have two children. Smith and his\r\nwife would thus have four grandchildren; but there would be in the\r\none generation no greater number than in the other—each child would\r\nhave four grandparents. And supposing this process were to go on, the\r\nline of descent might constantly spread out into hundreds, thousands\r\nand millions; but in each generation of descendants there would be no\r\nmore individuals than in any previous generation of ancestors. The web\r\nof generations is like lattice-work or the diagonal threads in cloth.\r\nCommencing at any point at the top, the eye follows lines which at the\r\nbottom widely diverge; but beginning at any point at the bottom, the\r\nlines diverge in the same way to the top. How many children a man may\r\nhave is problematical. But that he had two parents is certain, and\r\nthat these again had two parents each is also certain. Follow this\r\ngeometrical progression through a few generations and see if it does\r\nnot lead to quite as “striking consequences” as Mr. Malthus’ peopling\r\nof the solar systems.\r\n\r\nBut from such considerations as these let us advance to a more definite\r\ninquiry. I assert that the cases commonly cited as instances of\r\nover-population will not bear investigation. India, China, and Ireland\r\nfurnish the strongest of these cases. In each of these countries, large\r\nnumbers have perished by starvation and large classes are reduced to\r\nabject misery or compelled to emigrate. But is this really due to\r\nover-population?\r\n\r\nComparing total population with total area, India and China are far\r\nfrom being the most densely populated countries of the world. According\r\nto the estimates of MM. Behm and Wagner, the population of India is\r\nbut 132 to the square mile and that of China 119, whereas Saxony has\r\na population of 442 to the square mile; Belgium 441; England 422; the\r\nNetherlands 291; Italy 234 and Japan 233.[22] There are thus in both\r\ncountries large areas unused or not fully used, but even in their more\r\ndensely populated districts there can be no doubt that either could\r\nmaintain a much greater population in a much higher degree of comfort,\r\nfor in both countries is labor applied to production in the rudest and\r\nmost inefficient ways, and in both countries great natural resources\r\nare wholly neglected. This arises from no innate deficiency in the\r\npeople, for the Hindoo, as comparative philology has shown, is of our\r\nown blood, and China possessed a high degree of civilization and the\r\nrudiments of the most important modern inventions when our ancestors\r\nwere wandering savages. It arises from the form which the social\r\norganization has in both countries taken, which has shackled productive\r\npower and robbed industry of its reward.\r\n\r\nIn India from time immemorial, the working classes have been ground\r\ndown by exactions and oppressions into a condition of helpless and\r\nhopeless degradation. For ages and ages the cultivator of the soil\r\nhas esteemed himself happy if, of his produce, the extortion of the\r\nstrong hand left him enough to support life and furnish seed; capital\r\ncould nowhere be safely accumulated or to any considerable extent be\r\nused to assist production; all wealth that could be wrung from the\r\npeople was in the possession of princes who were little better than\r\nrobber chiefs quartered on the country, or in that of their farmers\r\nor favorites, and was wasted in useless or worse than useless luxury,\r\nwhile religion, sunken into an elaborate and terrible superstition,\r\ntyrannized over the mind as physical force did over the bodies of\r\nmen. Under these conditions, the only arts that could advance were\r\nthose that ministered to the ostentation and luxury of the great. The\r\nelephants of the rajah blazed with gold of exquisite workmanship, and\r\nthe umbrellas that symbolized his regal power glittered with gems; but\r\nthe plow of the ryot was only a sharpened stick. The ladies of the\r\nrajah’s harem wrapped themselves in muslins so fine as to take the name\r\nof woven wind, but the tools of the artisan were of the poorest and\r\nrudest description, and commerce could only be carried on, as it were,\r\nby stealth.\r\n\r\nIs it not clear that this tyranny and insecurity have produced the want\r\nand starvation of India; and not, as according to Buckle, the pressure\r\nof population upon subsistence that has produced the want, and the\r\nwant the tyranny.[23] Says the Rev. William Tennant, a chaplain in the\r\nservice of the East India Company, writing in 1796, two years before\r\nthe publication of the “Essay on Population:”\r\n\r\n “When we reflect upon the great fertility of Hindostan, it is amazing\r\n to consider the frequency of famine. It is evidently not owing to\r\n any sterility of soil or climate; the evil must be traced to some\r\n political cause, and it requires but little penetration to discover\r\n it in the avarice and extortion of the various governments. The great\r\n spur to industry, that of security, is taken away. Hence no man raises\r\n more grain than is barely sufficient for himself, and the first\r\n unfavorable season produces a famine.\r\n\r\n “The Mogul government at no period offered full security to the\r\n prince, still less to his vassals; and to peasants the most scanty\r\n protection of all. It was a continued tissue of violence and\r\n insurrection, treachery and punishment, under which neither commerce\r\n nor the arts could prosper, nor agriculture assume the appearance of a\r\n system. Its downfall gave rise to a state still more afflictive, since\r\n anarchy is worse than misrule. The Mohammedan government, wretched\r\n as it was, the European nations have not the merit of overturning.\r\n It fell beneath the weight of its own corruption, and had already\r\n been succeeded by the multifarious tyranny of petty chiefs, whose\r\n right to govern consisted in their treason to the state, and whose\r\n exactions on the peasants were as boundless as their avarice. The\r\n rents to government were, and, where natives rule, still are, levied\r\n twice a year by a merciless banditti, under the semblance of an army,\r\n who wantonly destroy or carry off whatever part of the produce may\r\n satisfy their caprice or satiate their avidity, after having hunted\r\n the ill-fated peasants from the villages to the woods. Any attempt\r\n of the peasants to defend their persons or property within the mud\r\n walls of their villages only calls for the more signal vengeance on\r\n those useful, but ill-fated mortals. They are then surrounded and\r\n attacked with musketry and field pieces till resistance ceases, when\r\n the survivors are sold, and their habitations burned and leveled\r\n with the ground. Hence you will frequently meet with the ryots\r\n gathering up the scattered remnants of what had yesterday been their\r\n habitation, if fear has permitted them to return; but oftener the\r\n ruins are seen smoking, after a second visitation of this kind,\r\n without the appearance of a human being to interrupt the awful silence\r\n of desolation. This description does not apply to the Mohammedan\r\n chieftains alone; it is equally applicable to the Rajahs in the\r\n districts governed by Hindoos.”[24]\r\n\r\nTo this merciless rapacity, which would have produced want and famine\r\nwere the population but one to a square mile and the land a Garden\r\nof Eden, succeeded, in the first era of British rule in India, as\r\nmerciless a rapacity, backed by a far more irresistible power. Says\r\nMacaulay, in his essay on Lord Clive:\r\n\r\n “Enormous fortunes were rapidly accumulated at Calcutta, while\r\n millions of human beings were reduced to the extremity of\r\n wretchedness. They had been accustomed to live under tyranny, but\r\n never under tyranny like this. They found the little finger of the\r\n Company thicker than the loins of Surajah Dowlah. * * * It resembled\r\n the government of evil genii, rather than the government of human\r\n tyrants. Sometimes they submitted in patient misery. Sometimes they\r\n fled from the white man as their fathers had been used to fly from the\r\n Maharatta, and the palanquin of the English traveler was often carried\r\n through silent villages and towns that the report of his approach had\r\n made desolate.”\r\n\r\nUpon horrors that Macaulay thus but touches, the vivid eloquence of\r\nBurke throws a stronger light—whole districts surrendered to the\r\nunrestrained cupidity of the worst of human kind, poverty-stricken\r\npeasants fiendishly tortured to compel them to give up their little\r\nhoards, and once populous tracts turned into deserts.\r\n\r\nBut the lawless license of early English rule has been long restrained.\r\nTo all that vast population the strong hand of England has given a\r\nmore than Roman peace; the just principles of English law have been\r\nextended by an elaborate system of codes and law officers designed\r\nto secure to the humblest of these abject peoples the rights of\r\nAnglo-Saxon freemen; the whole peninsula has been intersected by\r\nrailways, and great irrigation works have been constructed. Yet, with\r\nincreasing frequency, famine has succeeded famine, raging with greater\r\nintensity over wider areas.\r\n\r\nIs not this a demonstration of the Malthusian theory? Does it not\r\nshow that no matter how much the possibilities of subsistence are\r\nincreased, population still continues to press upon it? Does it not\r\nshow, as Malthus contended, that, to shut up the sluices by which\r\nsuperabundant population is carried off, is but to compel nature to\r\nopen new ones, and that unless the sources of human increase are\r\nchecked by prudential regulation, the alternative of war is famine?\r\nThis has been the orthodox explanation. But the truth, as may be seen\r\nin the facts brought forth in recent discussions of Indian affairs in\r\nthe English periodicals, is that these famines, which have been, and\r\nare now, sweeping away their millions, are no more due to the pressure\r\nof population upon the natural limits of subsistence than was the\r\ndesolation of the Carnatic when Hyder Ali’s horsemen burst upon it in a\r\nwhirlwind of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe millions of India have bowed their necks beneath the yokes of\r\nmany conquerors, but worst of all is the steady, grinding weight of\r\nEnglish domination—a weight which is literally crushing millions out\r\nof existence, and, as shown by English writers, is inevitably tending\r\nto a most frightful and widespread catastrophe. Other conquerors have\r\nlived in the land, and, though bad and tyrannous in their rule, have\r\nunderstood and been understood by the people; but India now is like a\r\ngreat estate owned by an absentee and alien landlord. A most expensive\r\nmilitary and civil establishment is kept up, managed and officered by\r\nEnglishmen who regard India as but a place of temporary exile; and an\r\nenormous sum, estimated as at least £20,000,000 annually, raised from a\r\npopulation where laborers are in many places glad in good times to work\r\nfor 1½d. to 4d. a day, is drained away to England in the shape of\r\nremittances, pensions, home charges of the government, etc.—a tribute\r\nfor which there is no return. The immense sums lavished on railroads\r\nhave, as shown by the returns, been economically unproductive; the\r\ngreat irrigation works are for the most part costly failures. In large\r\nparts of India the English, in their desire to create a class of landed\r\nproprietors, turned over the soil in absolute possession to hereditary\r\ntax-gatherers, who rack-rent the cultivators most mercilessly. In\r\nother parts, where the rent is still taken by the State in the shape\r\nof a land tax, assessments are so high, and taxes are collected so\r\nrelentlessly, as to drive the ryots, who get but the most scanty living\r\nin good seasons, into the claws of money lenders, who are, if possible,\r\neven more rapacious than the zemindars. Upon salt, an article of prime\r\nnecessity everywhere, and of especial necessity where food is almost\r\nexclusively vegetable, a tax of nearly twelve hundred per cent. is\r\nimposed, so that its various industrial uses are prohibited, and large\r\nbodies of the people cannot get enough to keep either themselves or\r\ntheir cattle in health. Below the English officials are a horde of\r\nnative employees who oppress and extort. The effect of English law,\r\nwith its rigid rules, and, to the native, mysterious proceedings, has\r\nbeen but to put a potent instrument of plunder into the hands of the\r\nnative money lenders, from whom the peasants are compelled to borrow on\r\nthe most extravagant terms to meet their taxes, and to whom they are\r\neasily induced to give obligations of which they know not the meaning.\r\n“We do not care for the people of India,” writes Florence Nightingale,\r\nwith what seems like a sob. “The saddest sight to be seen in the\r\nEast—nay, probably in the world—is the peasant of our Eastern Empire.”\r\nAnd she goes on to show the causes of the terrible famines, in taxation\r\nwhich takes from the cultivators the very means of cultivation, and the\r\nactual slavery to which the ryots are reduced as “the consequences of\r\nour own laws;” producing in “the most fertile country in the world, a\r\ngrinding, chronic semi-starvation in many places where what is called\r\nfamine does not exist.”[25] “The famines which have been devastating\r\nIndia,” says H. M. Hyndman,[26] “are in the main financial famines.\r\nMen and women cannot get food, because they cannot save the money to\r\nbuy it. Yet we are driven, so we say, to tax these people more.” And\r\nhe shows how, even from famine stricken districts, food is exported in\r\npayment of taxes, and how the whole of India is subjected to a steady\r\nand exhausting drain, which, combined with the enormous expenses of\r\ngovernment, is making the population year by year poorer. The exports\r\nof India consist almost exclusively of agricultural products. For at\r\nleast one-third of these, as Mr. Hyndman shows, no return whatever is\r\nreceived; they represent tribute—remittances made by Englishmen in\r\nIndia, or expenses of the English branch of the Indian government.[27]\r\nAnd for the rest, the return is for the most part government stores, or\r\narticles of comfort and luxury used by the English masters of India. He\r\nshows that the expenses of government have been enormously increased\r\nunder Imperial rule; that the relentless taxation of a population so\r\nmiserably poor that the masses are not more than half fed, is robbing\r\nthem of their scanty means for cultivating the soil; that the number\r\nof bullocks (the Indian draft animal) is decreasing, and the scanty\r\nimplements of culture being given up to money lenders, from whom “we,\r\na business people, are forcing the cultivators to borrow at 12, 24, 60\r\nper cent.[28] to build and pay the interest on the cost of vast public\r\nworks, which have never paid nearly five per cent.” Says Mr. Hyndman:\r\n“The truth is that Indian society as a whole has been frightfully\r\nimpoverished under our rule, and that the process is now going on at an\r\nexceedingly rapid rate”—a statement which cannot be doubted, in view of\r\nthe facts presented not only by such writers as I have referred to, but\r\nby Indian officials themselves. The very efforts made by the government\r\nto alleviate famines do, by the increased taxation imposed, but\r\nintensify and extend their real cause. Although in the recent famine\r\nin Southern India six millions of people, it is estimated, perished\r\nof actual starvation, and the great mass of those who survived were\r\nactually stripped, yet the taxes were not remitted and the salt tax,\r\nalready prohibitory to the great bulk of these poverty stricken people,\r\nwas increased forty per cent., just as after the terrible Bengal famine\r\nin 1770 the revenue was actually driven up, by raising assessments upon\r\nthe survivors and rigorously enforcing collection.\r\n\r\nIn India now, as in India in past times, it is only the most\r\nsuperficial view that can attribute want and starvation to pressure of\r\npopulation upon the ability of the land to produce subsistence. Could\r\nthe cultivators retain their little capital—could they be released\r\nfrom the drain which, even in non-famine years, reduces great masses\r\nof them to a scale of living not merely below what is deemed necessary\r\nfor the sepoys, but what English humanity gives to the prisoners in\r\nthe jails—reviving industry, assuming more productive forms, would\r\nundoubtedly suffice to keep a much greater population. There are still\r\nin India great areas uncultivated, vast mineral resources untouched,\r\nand it is certain that the population of India does not reach, as\r\nwithin historical times it never has reached, the real limit of the\r\nsoil to furnish subsistence, or even the point where this power begins\r\nto decline with the increasing drafts made upon it. The real cause\r\nof want in India has been, and yet is, the rapacity of man, not the\r\nniggardliness of nature.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of India is true of China. Densely populated as China is\r\nin many parts, that the extreme poverty of the lower classes is to be\r\nattributed to causes similar to those which have operated in India,\r\nand not to too great population, is shown by many facts. Insecurity\r\nprevails, production goes on under the greatest disadvantages, and\r\nexchange is closely fettered. Where the government is a succession of\r\nsqueezings, and security for capital of any sort must be purchased of\r\na mandarin; where men’s shoulders are the great reliance for inland\r\ntransportation; where the junk is obliged to be constructed so as to\r\nunfit it for a sea-boat; where piracy is a regular trade, and robbers\r\noften march in regiments, poverty would prevail and the failure of a\r\ncrop result in famine, no matter how sparse the population.[29] That\r\nChina is capable of supporting a much greater population is shown not\r\nonly by the great extent of uncultivated land to which all travelers\r\ntestify, but by the immense unworked mineral deposits which are there\r\nknown to exist. China, for instance, is said to contain the largest and\r\nfinest deposit of coal yet anywhere discovered. How much the working\r\nof these coal beds would add to the ability to support a greater\r\npopulation, may readily be imagined. Coal is not food, it is true; but\r\nits production is equivalent to the production of food. For, not only\r\nmay coal be exchanged for food, as is done in all mining districts, but\r\nthe force evolved by its consumption may be used in the production of\r\nfood, or may set labor free for the production of food.\r\n\r\nNeither in India nor China, therefore, can poverty and starvation be\r\ncharged to the pressure of population against subsistence. It is not\r\ndense population, but the causes which prevent social organization\r\nfrom taking its natural development and labor from securing its full\r\nreturn, that keep millions just on the verge of starvation, and every\r\nnow and again force millions beyond it. That the Hindoo laborer thinks\r\nhimself fortunate to get a handful of rice, that the Chinese eat rats\r\nand puppies, is no more due to the pressure of population than it is\r\ndue to the pressure of population that the Digger Indians live on\r\ngrasshoppers, or the aboriginal inhabitants of Australia eat the worms\r\nfound in rotten wood.\r\n\r\nLet me be understood. I do not mean merely to say that India or China\r\ncould, with a more highly developed civilization, maintain a greater\r\npopulation, for to this any Malthusian would agree. The Malthusian\r\ndoctrine does not deny that an advance in the productive arts would\r\npermit a greater population to find subsistence. But the Malthusian\r\ntheory affirms—and this is its essence—that, whatever be the capacity\r\nfor production, the natural tendency of population is to come up with\r\nit, and, in the endeavor to press beyond it, to produce, to use the\r\nphrase of Malthus, that degree of vice and misery which is necessary\r\nto prevent further increase; so that as productive power is increased,\r\npopulation will correspondingly increase, and in a little time produce\r\nthe same results as before. What I say is this: that nowhere is there\r\nany instance which will support this theory; that nowhere can want be\r\nproperly attributed to the pressure of population against the power to\r\nprocure subsistence in the then existing degree of human knowledge;\r\nthat everywhere the vice and misery attributed to over-population\r\ncan be traced to the warfare, tyranny, and oppression which prevent\r\nknowledge from being utilized and deny the security essential to\r\nproduction. The reason why the natural increase of population does not\r\nproduce want, we shall come to hereafter. The fact that it has not\r\nyet anywhere done so, is what we are now concerned with. This fact\r\nis obvious with regard to India and China. It will be obvious, too,\r\nwherever we trace to their causes the results which on superficial view\r\nare often taken to proceed from over-population.\r\n\r\nIreland, of all European countries, furnishes the great stock example\r\nof over-population. The extreme poverty of the peasantry and the low\r\nrate of wages there prevailing, the Irish famine, and Irish emigration,\r\nare constantly referred to as a demonstration of the Malthusian theory\r\nworked out under the eyes of the civilized world. I doubt if a more\r\nstriking instance can be cited of the power of a preaccepted theory to\r\nblind men as to the true relations of facts. The truth is, and it lies\r\non the surface, that Ireland has never yet had a population which the\r\nnatural powers of the country, in the existing state of the productive\r\narts, could not have maintained in ample comfort. At the period of her\r\ngreatest population (1840-45) Ireland contained something over eight\r\nmillions of people. But a very large proportion of them managed merely\r\nto exist—lodging in miserable cabins, clothed with miserable rags, and\r\nwith but potatoes for their staple food. When the potato blight came,\r\nthey died by thousands. But was it the inability of the soil to support\r\nso large a population that compelled so many to live in this miserable\r\nway, and exposed them to starvation on the failure of a single root\r\ncrop? On the contrary, it was the same remorseless rapacity that robbed\r\nthe Indian ryot of the fruits of his toil and left him to starve where\r\nnature offered plenty. A merciless banditti of tax-gatherers did not\r\nmarch through the land plundering and torturing, but the laborer was\r\njust as effectually stripped by as merciless a horde of landlords,\r\namong whom the soil had been divided as their absolute possession,\r\nregardless of any rights of those who lived upon it.\r\n\r\nConsider the conditions of production under which this eight millions\r\nmanaged to live until the potato blight came. It was a condition to\r\nwhich the words used by Mr. Tennant in reference to India may as\r\nappropriately be applied—“the great spur to industry, that of security,\r\nwas taken away.” Cultivation was for the most part carried on by\r\ntenants at will, who, even if the rack-rents which they were forced\r\nto pay had permitted them, did not dare to make improvements which\r\nwould have been but the signal for an increase of rent. Labor was\r\nthus applied in the most inefficient and wasteful manner, and labor\r\nwas dissipated in aimless idleness that, with any security for its\r\nfruits, would have been applied unremittingly. But even under these\r\nconditions, it is a matter of fact that Ireland did more than support\r\neight millions. For when her population was at its highest, Ireland\r\nwas a food-exporting country. Even during the famine, grain and meat\r\nand butter and cheese were carted for exportation along roads lined\r\nwith the starving and past trenches into which the dead were piled. For\r\nthese exports of food, or at least for a great part of them, there was\r\nno return. So far as the people of Ireland were concerned, the food\r\nthus exported might as well have been burned up or thrown into the sea,\r\nor never produced. It went not as an exchange, but as a tribute—to pay\r\nthe rent of absentee landlords; a levy wrung from producers by those\r\nwho in no wise contributed to production.\r\n\r\nHad this food been left to those who raised it; had the cultivators\r\nof the soil been permitted to retain and use the capital their labor\r\nproduced; had security stimulated industry and permitted the adoption\r\nof economical methods, there would have been enough to support in\r\nbounteous comfort the largest population Ireland ever had, and the\r\npotato blight might have come and gone without stinting a single\r\nhuman being of a full meal. For it was not the imprudence “of Irish\r\npeasants,” as English economists coldly say, which induced them to\r\nmake the potato the staple of their food. Irish emigrants, when they\r\ncan get other things, do not live upon the potato, and certainly in\r\nthe United States the prudence of the Irish character, in endeavoring\r\nto lay by something for a rainy day, is remarkable. They lived on the\r\npotato, because rack-rents stripped everything else from them. The\r\ntruth is, that the poverty and misery of Ireland have never been fairly\r\nattributable to over-population.\r\n\r\nMcCulloch, writing in 1838, says, in Note IV to “Wealth of Nations:”\r\n\r\n “The wonderful density of population in Ireland is the immediate cause\r\n of the abject poverty and depressed condition of the great bulk of\r\n the people. It is not too much to say that there are at present more\r\n than double the persons in Ireland it is, with its existing means of\r\n production, able either fully to employ or to maintain in a moderate\r\n state of comfort.”\r\n\r\nAs in 1841 the population of Ireland was given as 8,175,124, we\r\nmay set it down in 1838 as about eight millions. Thus, to change\r\nMcCulloch’s negative into an affirmative, Ireland would, according\r\nto the over-population theory, have been able to employ fully and\r\nmaintain in a moderate state of comfort something less than four\r\nmillion persons. Now, in the early part of the preceding century, when\r\nDean Swift wrote his “Modest Proposal,” the population of Ireland was\r\nabout two millions. As neither the means nor the arts of production\r\nhad perceptibly advanced in Ireland during the interval, then—if the\r\nabject poverty and depressed condition of the Irish people in 1838 were\r\nattributable to over-population—there should, upon McCulloch’s own\r\nadmission, have been in Ireland in 1727 more than full employment, and\r\nmuch more than a moderate state of comfort, for the whole two millions.\r\nYet, instead of this being the case, the abject poverty and depressed\r\ncondition of the Irish people in 1727 were such, that, with burning,\r\nblistering irony, Dean Swift proposed to relieve surplus population\r\nby cultivating a taste for roasted babies, and bringing yearly to the\r\nshambles, as dainty food for the rich, 100,000 Irish infants!\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for one who has been looking over the literature of\r\nIrish misery, as while writing this chapter I have been doing, to\r\nspeak in decorous terms of the complacent attribution of Irish want\r\nand suffering to over-population which are to be found even in the\r\nworks of such high-minded men as Mill and Buckle. I know of nothing\r\nbetter calculated to make the blood boil than the cold accounts of\r\nthe grasping, grinding tyranny to which the Irish people have been\r\nsubjected, and to which, and not to any inability of the land to\r\nsupport its population, Irish pauperism and Irish famine are to be\r\nattributed; and were it not for the enervating effect which the history\r\nof the world proves to be everywhere the result of abject poverty, it\r\nwould be difficult to resist something like a feeling of contempt for\r\na race who, stung by such wrongs, have only occasionally murdered a\r\nlandlord!\r\n\r\nWhether over-population ever did cause pauperism and starvation, may be\r\nan open question; but the pauperism and starvation of Ireland can no\r\nmore be attributed to this cause than can the slave trade be attributed\r\nto the over-population of Africa, or the destruction of Jerusalem\r\nto the inability of subsistence to keep pace with reproduction. Had\r\nIreland been by nature a grove of bananas and bread-fruit, had her\r\ncoasts been lined by the guano-deposits of the Chinchas, and the sun\r\nof lower latitudes warmed into more abundant life her moist soil, the\r\nsocial conditions that have prevailed there would still have brought\r\nforth poverty and starvation. How could there fail to be pauperism and\r\nfamine in a country where rack-rents wrested from the cultivator of\r\nthe soil all the produce of his labor except just enough to maintain\r\nlife in good seasons; where tenure at will forbade improvements and\r\nremoved incentive to any but the most wasteful and poverty-stricken\r\nculture; where the tenant dared not accumulate capital, even if he\r\ncould get it, for fear the landlord would demand it in the rent; where\r\nin fact he was an abject slave, who, at the nod of a human being like\r\nhimself, might at any time be driven from his miserable mud cabin, a\r\nhouseless, homeless, starving wanderer, forbidden even to pluck the\r\nspontaneous fruits of the earth, or to trap a wild hare to satisfy\r\nhis hunger? No matter how sparse the population, no matter what\r\nthe natural resources, are not pauperism and starvation necessary\r\nconsequences in a land where the producers of wealth are compelled to\r\nwork under conditions which deprive them of hope, of self-respect, of\r\nenergy, of thrift; where absentee landlords drain away without return\r\nat least a fourth of the net produce of the soil, and when, besides\r\nthem, a starving industry must support resident landlords, with their\r\nhorses and hounds, agents, jobbers, middlemen and bailiffs, an alien\r\nstate church to insult religious prejudices, and an army of policemen\r\nand soldiers to overawe and hunt down any opposition to the iniquitous\r\nsystem? Is it not impiety far worse than atheism to charge upon natural\r\nlaws misery so caused?\r\n\r\nWhat is true in these three cases will be found upon examination true\r\nof all cases. So far as our knowledge of facts goes, we may safely deny\r\nthat the increase of population has ever yet pressed upon subsistence\r\nin such a way as to produce vice and misery; that increase of numbers\r\nhas ever yet decreased the relative production of food. The famines of\r\nIndia, China, and Ireland can no more be credited to over-population\r\nthan the famines of sparsely populated Brazil. The vice and misery\r\nthat come of want can no more be attributed to the niggardliness of\r\nNature than can the six millions slain by the sword of Genghis Khan,\r\nTamerlane’s pyramid of skulls, or the extermination of the ancient\r\nBritons or of the aboriginal inhabitants of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Malthus’ other works, though written after he became famous, made\r\nno mark, and are treated with contempt even by those who find in the\r\nEssay a great discovery. The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance,\r\nthough fully accepting the Malthusian theory, says of Malthus’\r\nPolitical Economy: “It is very ill arranged, and is in no respect\r\neither a practical or a scientific exposition of the subject. It is\r\nin great part occupied with an examination of parts of Mr. Ricardo’s\r\npeculiar doctrines, and with an inquiry into the nature and causes\r\nof value. Nothing, however, can be more unsatisfactory than these\r\ndiscussions. In truth Mr. Malthus never had any clear or accurate\r\nperception of Mr. Ricardo’s theories, or of the principles which\r\ndetermine the value in exchange of different articles.”\r\n\r\n[20] I say considerable country, because there may be small islands,\r\nsuch as Pitcairn’s Island, cut off from communication with the rest\r\nof the world and consequently from the exchanges which are necessary\r\nto the improved modes of production resorted to as population\r\nbecomes dense, which may seem to offer examples in point. A moment’s\r\nreflection, however, will show that these exceptional cases are not in\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[21] As may be seen from the map in H. H. Bancroft’s “Native Races,”\r\nthe State of Vera Cruz is not one of those parts of Mexico noticeable\r\nfor its antiquities. Yet Hugo Fink, of Cordova, writing to the\r\nSmithsonian Institute (Reports 1870), says there is hardly a foot in\r\nthe whole State in which by excavation either a broken obsidian knife\r\nor a broken piece of pottery is not found; that the whole country is\r\nintersected with parallel lines of stones intended to keep the earth\r\nfrom washing away in the rainy season, which show that even the very\r\npoorest land was put into requisition, and that it is impossible to\r\nresist the conclusion that the ancient population was at least as dense\r\nas it is at present in the most populous districts of Europe.\r\n\r\n[22] I take these figures from the Smithsonian Report for 1873, leaving\r\nout decimals. MM. Behm and Wagner put the population of China at\r\n446,500,000, though there are some who contend that it does not exceed\r\n150,000,000. They put the population of Hither India at 206,225,580,\r\ngiving 132.39 to the square mile; of Ceylon at 2,405,287 or 97.36 to\r\nthe square mile; of Further India at 21,018,062, or 27.94 to the square\r\nmile. They estimate the population of the world at 1,377,000,000, an\r\naverage of 26.64 to the square mile.\r\n\r\n[23] History of Civilization. Vol. I., Chap. 2. In this chapter\r\nBuckle has collected a great deal of evidence of the oppression\r\nand degradation of the people of India from the most remote times,\r\na condition which, blinded by the Malthusian doctrine, he has\r\naccepted and made the cornerstone of his theory of the development of\r\ncivilization, he attributes to the ease with which food can there be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[24] Indian Recreations. By Rev. Wm. Tennant. London, 1804. Vol. I.,\r\nSec. XXXIX.\r\n\r\n[25] Miss Nightingale (The People of India, in “Nineteenth Century”\r\nfor August, 1878) gives instances, which she says represent millions\r\nof cases, of the state of peonage to which the cultivators of Southern\r\nIndia have been reduced through the facilities afforded by the Civil\r\nCourts to the frauds and oppressions of money lenders and minor native\r\nofficials. “Our Civil Courts are regarded as institutions for enabling\r\nthe rich to grind the faces of the poor, and many are fain to seek a\r\nrefuge from their jurisdiction within native territory,” says Sir David\r\nWedderburn, in an article on Protected Princes in India, in a previous\r\n(July) number of the same magazine, in which he also gives a native\r\nState, where taxation is comparatively light, as an instance of the\r\nmost prosperous population of India.\r\n\r\n[26] See articles in “Nineteenth Century” for October, 1878, and March,\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n[27] Prof. Fawcett, in a recent article on the Proposed Loans to India,\r\ncalls attentions to such items as £1,200 for outfit and passage of a\r\nmember of the Governor General’s Council; £2,450 for outfit and passage\r\nof Bishops of Calcutta and Bombay.\r\n\r\n[28] Florence Nightingale says 100 per cent. is common, and even then\r\nthe cultivator is robbed in ways which she illustrates. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that these rates, like those of the pawnbroker, are\r\nnot interest in the economic sense of the term.\r\n\r\n[29] The seat of recent famine in China was not the most thickly\r\nsettled districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINFERENCES FROM ANALOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we turn from an examination of the facts brought forward in\r\nillustration of the Malthusian theory to consider the analogies by\r\nwhich it is supported, we shall find the same inconclusiveness.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the reproductive force in the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms—such facts as that a single pair of salmon might, if preserved\r\nfrom their natural enemies for a few years, fill the ocean; that a\r\npair of rabbits would, under the same circumstances, soon overrun a\r\ncontinent; that many plants scatter their seeds by the hundred fold,\r\nand some insects deposit thousands of eggs; and that everywhere through\r\nthese kingdoms each species constantly tends to press, and when not\r\nlimited by the number of its enemies, evidently does press, against\r\nthe limits of subsistence—is constantly cited, from Malthus down to\r\nthe text-books of the present day, as showing that population likewise\r\ntends to press against subsistence, and, when unrestrained by other\r\nmeans, its natural increase must necessarily result in such low wages\r\nand want, or, if that will not suffice, and the increase still goes\r\non, in such actual starvation, as will keep it within the limits of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nBut is this analogy valid? It is from the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms that man’s food is drawn, and hence the greater strength of\r\nthe reproductive force in the vegetable and animal kingdoms than in\r\nman simply proves the power of subsistence to increase faster than\r\npopulation. Does not the fact that all of the things which furnish\r\nman’s subsistence have the power to multiply many fold—some of them\r\nmany thousand fold, and some of them many million or even billion\r\nfold—while he is only doubling his numbers, show that, let human beings\r\nincrease to the full extent of their reproductive power, the increase\r\nof population can never exceed subsistence? This is clear when it\r\nis remembered that though in the vegetable and animal kingdoms each\r\nspecies, by virtue of its reproductive power, naturally and necessarily\r\npresses against the conditions which limit its further increase, yet\r\nthese conditions are nowhere fixed and final. No species reaches the\r\nultimate limit of soil, water, air, and sunshine; but the actual limit\r\nof each is in the existence of other species, its rivals, its enemies,\r\nor its food. Thus the conditions which limit the existence of such of\r\nthese species as afford him subsistence man can extend (in some cases\r\nhis mere appearance will extend them), and thus the reproductive forces\r\nof the species which supply his wants, instead of wasting themselves\r\nagainst their former limit, start forward in his service at a pace\r\nwhich his powers of increase cannot rival. If he but shoot hawks,\r\nfood-birds will increase, if he but trap foxes the wild rabbits will\r\nmultiply; the honey bee moves with the pioneer, and on the organic\r\nmatter with which man’s presence fills the rivers, fishes feed.\r\n\r\nEven if any consideration of final causes be excluded; even if it be\r\nnot permitted to suggest that the high and constant reproductive force\r\nin vegetables and animals has been ordered to enable them to subserve\r\nthe uses of man, and that therefore the pressure of the lower forms of\r\nlife against subsistence does not tend to show that it must likewise be\r\nso with man, “the roof and crown of things;” yet there still remains a\r\ndistinction between man and all other forms of life that destroys the\r\nanalogy. Of all living things, man is the only one who can give play\r\nto the reproductive forces, more powerful than his own, which supply\r\nhim with food. Beast, insect, bird, and fish take only what they find.\r\nTheir increase is at the expense of their food, and when they have\r\nreached the existing limits of food, their food must increase before\r\nthey can increase. But unlike that of any other living thing, the\r\nincrease of man involves the increase of his food. If bears instead of\r\nmen had been shipped from Europe to the North American continent, there\r\nwould now be no more bears than in the time of Columbus, and possibly\r\nfewer, for bear food would not have been increased nor the conditions\r\nof bear life extended, by the bear immigration, but probably the\r\nreverse. But within the limits of the United States alone, there are\r\nnow forty-five millions of men where then there were only a few hundred\r\nthousand, and yet there is now within that territory much more food\r\nper capita for the forty-five millions than there was then for the few\r\nhundred thousand. It is not the increase of food that has caused this\r\nincrease of men; but the increase of men that has brought about the\r\nincrease of food. There is more food, simply because there are more men.\r\n\r\nHere is a difference between the animal and the man. Both the jay-hawk\r\nand the man eat chickens, but the more jay-hawks the fewer chickens,\r\nwhile the more men the more chickens. Both the seal and the man eat\r\nsalmon, but when a seal takes a salmon there is a salmon the less, and\r\nwere seals to increase past a certain point salmon must diminish; while\r\nby placing the spawn of the salmon under favorable conditions man can\r\nso increase the number of salmon as more than to make up for all he may\r\ntake, and thus, no matter how much men may increase, their increase\r\nneed never outrun the supply of salmon.\r\n\r\nIn short, while all through the vegetable and animal kingdoms the\r\nlimit of subsistence is independent of the thing subsisted, with man\r\nthe limit of subsistence is, within the final limits of earth, air,\r\nwater, and sunshine, dependent upon man himself. And this being the\r\ncase, the analogy which it is sought to draw between the lower forms of\r\nlife and man manifestly fails. While vegetables and animals do press\r\nagainst the limits of subsistence, man cannot press against the limits\r\nof his subsistence until the limits of the globe are reached. Observe,\r\nthis is not merely true of the whole, but of all the parts. As we\r\ncannot reduce the level of the smallest bay or harbor without reducing\r\nthe level not merely of the ocean with which it communicates, but of\r\nall the seas and oceans of the world, so the limit of subsistence in\r\nany particular place is not the physical limit of that place, but the\r\nphysical limit of the globe. Fifty square miles of soil will in the\r\npresent state of the productive arts yield subsistence for only some\r\nthousands of people, but on the fifty square miles which comprise the\r\ncity of London some three and a half millions of people are maintained,\r\nand subsistence increases as population increases. So far as the limit\r\nof subsistence is concerned, London may grow to a population of a\r\nhundred millions, or five hundred millions, or a thousand millions, for\r\nshe draws for subsistence upon the whole globe, and the limit which\r\nsubsistence sets to her growth in population is the limit of the globe\r\nto furnish food for its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBut here will arise another idea from which the Malthusian theory\r\nderives great support—that of the diminishing productiveness of land.\r\nAs conclusively proving the law of diminishing productiveness it is\r\nsaid in the current treatises that were it not true that beyond a\r\ncertain point land yields less and less to additional applications\r\nof labor and capital, increasing population would not cause any\r\nextension of cultivation, but that all the increased supplies needed\r\ncould and would be raised without taking into cultivation any fresh\r\nground. Assent to this seems to involve assent to the doctrine that\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining subsistence must increase with increasing\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nBut I think the necessity is only in seeming. If the proposition be\r\nanalyzed it will be seen to belong to a class that depend for validity\r\nupon an implied or suggested qualification—a truth relatively, which\r\ntaken absolutely becomes a non-truth. For that man cannot exhaust or\r\nlessen the powers of nature follows from the indestructibility of\r\nmatter and the persistence of force. Production and consumption are\r\nonly relative terms. Speaking absolutely, man neither produces nor\r\nconsumes. The whole human race, were they to labor to infinity, could\r\nnot make this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter,\r\ncould not add to or diminish by one iota the sum of the forces whose\r\neverlasting circling produces all motion and sustains all life. As\r\nthe water that we take from the ocean must again return to the ocean,\r\nso the food we take from the reservoirs of nature is, from the moment\r\nwe take it, on its way back to those reservoirs. What we draw from\r\na limited extent of land may temporarily reduce the productiveness\r\nof that land, because the return may be to other land, or may be\r\ndivided between that land and other land, or, perhaps, all land; but\r\nthis possibility lessens with increasing area, and ceases when the\r\nwhole globe is considered. That the earth could maintain a thousand\r\nbillions of people as easily as a thousand millions is a necessary\r\ndeduction from the manifest truths that, at least so far as our agency\r\nis concerned, matter is eternal and force must forever continue to\r\nact. Life does not use up the forces that maintain life. We come into\r\nthe material universe bringing nothing; we take nothing away when we\r\ndepart. The human being, physically considered, is but a transient form\r\nof matter, a changing mode of motion. The matter remains and the force\r\npersists. Nothing is lessened, nothing is weakened. And from this it\r\nfollows that the limit to the population of the globe can be only the\r\nlimit of space.\r\n\r\nNow this limitation of space—this danger that the human race may\r\nincrease beyond the possibility of finding elbow room—is so far off as\r\nto have for us no more practical interest than the recurrence of the\r\nglacial period or the final extinguishment of the sun. Yet remote and\r\nshadowy as it is, it is this possibility which gives to the Malthusian\r\ntheory its apparently self-evident character. But if we follow it, even\r\nthis shadow will disappear. It, also, springs from a false analogy.\r\nThat vegetable and animal life tend to press against the limits of\r\nspace does not prove the same tendency in human life.\r\n\r\nGranted that man is only a more highly developed animal; that the\r\nring-tailed monkey is a distant relative who has gradually developed\r\nacrobatic tendencies, and the hump-backed whale a far-off connection\r\nwho in early life took to the sea—granted that back of these he is kin\r\nto the vegetable, and is still subject to the same laws as plants,\r\nfishes, birds, and beasts. Yet there is still this difference between\r\nman and all other animals—he is the only animal whose desires increase\r\nas they are fed; the only animal that is never satisfied. The wants\r\nof every other living thing are uniform and fixed. The ox of to-day\r\naspires to no more than did the ox when man first yoked him. The\r\nsea gull of the English Channel, who poises himself above the swift\r\nsteamer, wants no better food or lodging than the gulls who circled\r\nround as the keels of Cæsar’s galleys first grated on a British beach.\r\nOf all that nature offers them, be it ever so abundant, all living\r\nthings save man can take, and care for, only enough to supply wants\r\nwhich are definite and fixed. The only use they can make of additional\r\nsupplies or additional opportunities is to multiply.\r\n\r\nBut not so with man. No sooner are his animal wants satisfied than new\r\nwants arise. Food he wants first, as does the beast; shelter next, as\r\ndoes the beast; and these given, his reproductive instincts assert\r\ntheir sway, as do those of the beast. But here man and beast part\r\ncompany. The beast never goes further; the man has but set his feet on\r\nthe first step of an infinite progression—a progression upon which the\r\nbeast never enters; a progression away from and above the beast.\r\n\r\nThe demand for quantity once satisfied, he seeks quality. The very\r\ndesires that he has in common with the beast become extended, refined,\r\nexalted. It is not merely hunger, but taste, that seeks gratification\r\nin food; in clothes, he seeks not merely comfort, but adornment; the\r\nrude shelter becomes a house; the undiscriminating sexual attraction\r\nbegins to transmute itself into subtile influences, and the hard and\r\ncommon stock of animal life to blossom and to bloom into shapes of\r\ndelicate beauty. As power to gratify his wants increases, so does\r\naspiration grow. Held down to lower levels of desire, Lucullus will\r\nsup with Lucullus; twelve boars turn on spits that Antony’s mouthful\r\nof meat maybe done to a turn; every kingdom of Nature be ransacked to\r\nadd to Cleopatra’s charms, and marble colonnades and hanging gardens\r\nand pyramids that rival the hills arise. Passing into higher forms of\r\ndesire, that which slumbered in the plant and fitfully stirred in the\r\nbeast, awakes in the man. The eyes of the mind are opened, and he longs\r\nto know. He braves the scorching heat of the desert and the icy blasts\r\nof the polar sea, but not for food; he watches all night, but it is\r\nto trace the circling of the eternal stars. He adds toil to toil, to\r\ngratify a hunger no animal has felt; to assuage a thirst no beast can\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nOut upon nature, in upon himself, back through the mists that shroud\r\nthe past, forward into the darkness that overhangs the future, turns\r\nthe restless desire that arises when the animal wants slumber in\r\nsatisfaction. Beneath things, he seeks the law; he would know how the\r\nglobe was forged and the stars were hung, and trace to their origins\r\nthe springs of life. And, then, as the man develops his nobler nature,\r\nthere arises the desire higher yet—the passion of passions, the hope\r\nof hopes—the desire that he, even he, may somehow aid in making life\r\nbetter and brighter, in destroying want and sin, sorrow and shame. He\r\nmasters and curbs the animal; he turns his back upon the feast and\r\nrenounces the place of power; he leaves it to others to accumulate\r\nwealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to bask themselves in the warm\r\nsunshine of the brief day. He works for those he never saw and never\r\ncan see; for a fame, or maybe but for a scant justice, that can only\r\ncome long after the clods have rattled upon his coffin lid. He toils\r\nin the advance, where it is cold, and there is little cheer from men,\r\nand the stones are sharp and the brambles thick. Amid the scoffs of the\r\npresent and the sneers that stab like knives, he builds for the future;\r\nhe cuts the trail that progressive humanity may hereafter broaden into\r\na highroad. Into higher, grander spheres desire mounts and beckons, and\r\na star that rises in the east leads him on. Lo! the pulses of the man\r\nthrob with the yearnings of the god—he would aid in the process of the\r\nsuns!\r\n\r\nIs not the gulf too wide for the analogy to span? Give more food,\r\nopen fuller conditions of life, and the vegetable or animal can but\r\nmultiply; the man will develop. In the one the expansive force can but\r\nextend existence in new numbers; in the other, it will inevitably tend\r\nto extend existence in higher forms and wider powers. Man is an animal;\r\nbut he is an animal plus something else. He is the mythic earth-tree,\r\nwhose roots are in the ground, but whose topmost branches may blossom\r\nin the heavens!\r\n\r\nWhichever way it be turned, the reasoning by which this theory of\r\nthe constant tendency of population to press against the limits\r\nof subsistence is supported shows an unwarranted assumption, an\r\nundistributed middle, as the logicians would say. Facts do not warrant\r\nit, analogy does not countenance it. It is a pure chimera of the\r\nimagination, such as those that for a long time prevented men from\r\nrecognizing the rotundity and motion of the earth. It is just such a\r\ntheory as that underneath us everything not fastened to the earth must\r\nfall off; as that a ball dropped from the mast of a ship in motion must\r\nfall behind the mast; as that a live fish placed in a vessel full of\r\nwater will displace no water. It is as unfounded, if not as grotesque,\r\nas an assumption we can imagine Adam might have made had he been of\r\nan arithmetical turn of mind and figured on the growth of his first\r\nbaby from the rate of its early months. From the fact that at birth it\r\nweighed ten pounds and in eight months thereafter twenty pounds, he\r\nmight, with the arithmetical knowledge which some sages have supposed\r\nhim to possess, have ciphered out a result quite as striking as that\r\nof Mr. Malthus; namely, that by the time it got to be ten years old it\r\nwould be as heavy as an ox, at twelve as heavy as an elephant, and at\r\nthirty would weigh no less than 175,716,339,548 tons.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, there is no more reason for us to trouble ourselves about\r\nthe pressure of population upon subsistence than there was for Adam\r\nto worry himself about the rapid growth of his baby. So far as an\r\ninference is really warranted by facts and suggested by analogy, it\r\nis that the law of population includes such beautiful adaptations as\r\ninvestigation has already shown in other natural laws, and that we are\r\nno more warranted in assuming that the instinct of reproduction, in\r\nthe natural development of society, tends to produce misery and vice,\r\nthan we should be in assuming that the force of gravitation must hurl\r\nthe moon to the earth and the earth to the sun, or than in assuming\r\nfrom the contraction of water with reductions of temperature down to\r\nthirty-two degrees that rivers and lakes must freeze to the bottom\r\nwith every frost, and the temperate regions of earth be thus rendered\r\nuninhabitable by even moderate winters. That, besides the positive and\r\nprudential checks of Malthus, there is a third check which comes into\r\nplay with the elevation of the standard of comfort and the development\r\nof the intellect, is pointed to by many well-known facts. The\r\nproportion of births is notoriously greater in new settlements, where\r\nthe struggle with nature leaves little opportunity for intellectual\r\nlife, and among the poverty-bound classes of older countries, who in\r\nthe midst of wealth are deprived of all its advantages and reduced\r\nto all but an animal existence, than it is among the classes to whom\r\nthe increase of wealth has brought independence, leisure, comfort,\r\nand a fuller and more varied life. This fact, long ago recognized in\r\nthe homely adage, “a rich man for luck, and a poor man for children,”\r\nwas noted by Adam Smith, who says it is not uncommon to find a poor\r\nhalf-starved Highland woman has been the mother of twenty-three or\r\ntwenty-four children, and is everywhere so clearly perceptible that it\r\nis only necessary to allude to it.\r\n\r\nIf the real law of population is thus indicated, as I think it must\r\nbe, then the tendency to increase, instead of being always uniform, is\r\nstrong where a greater population would give increased comfort, and\r\nwhere the perpetuity of the race is threatened by the mortality induced\r\nby adverse conditions; but weakens just as the higher development of\r\nthe individual becomes possible and the perpetuity of the race is\r\nassured. In other words, the law of population accords with and is\r\nsubordinate to the law of intellectual development, and any danger\r\nthat human beings may be brought into a world where they cannot be\r\nprovided for arises not from the ordinances of nature, but from social\r\nmal-adjustments that in the midst of wealth condemn men to want. The\r\ntruth of this will, I think, be conclusively demonstrated when, after\r\nhaving cleared the ground, we trace out the true laws of social growth.\r\nBut it would disturb the natural order of the argument to anticipate\r\nthem now. If I have succeeded in maintaining a negative—in showing that\r\nthe Malthusian theory is not proved by the reasoning by which it is\r\nsupported—it is enough for the present. In the next chapter I propose\r\nto take the affirmative and show that it is disproved by facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDISPROOF OF THE MALTHUSIAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo deeply rooted and thoroughly entwined with the reasonings of the\r\ncurrent political economy is this doctrine that increase of population\r\ntends to reduce wages and produce poverty, so completely does it\r\nharmonize with many popular notions, and so liable is it to recur in\r\ndifferent shapes, that I have thought it necessary to meet and show\r\nin some detail the insufficiency of the arguments by which it is\r\nsupported, before bringing it to the test of facts; for the general\r\nacceptance of this theory adds a most striking instance to the many\r\nwhich the history of thought affords of how easily men ignore facts\r\nwhen blindfolded by a preaccepted theory.\r\n\r\nTo the supreme and final test of facts we can easily bring this theory.\r\nManifestly the question whether increase of population necessarily\r\ntends to reduce wages and cause want, is simply the question whether it\r\ntends to reduce the amount of wealth that can be produced by a given\r\namount of labor.\r\n\r\nThis is what the current doctrine holds. The accepted theory is, that\r\nthe more that is required from nature the less generously does she\r\nrespond, so that doubling the application of labor will not double the\r\nproduct; and hence, increase of population must tend to reduce wages\r\nand deepen poverty, or, in the phrase of Malthus, must result in vice\r\nand misery. To quote the language of John Stuart Mill:\r\n\r\n  “A greater number of people cannot, in any given state of\r\n civilization, be collectively so well provided for as a smaller. The\r\n niggardliness of nature, not the injustice of society, is the cause\r\n of the penalty attached to over-population. An unjust distribution\r\n of wealth does not aggravate the evil, but, at most, causes it be\r\n somewhat earlier felt. It is in vain to say that all mouths which\r\n the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands.\r\n The new mouths require as much food as the old ones, and the hands\r\n do not produce as much. If all instruments of production were held\r\n in joint property by the whole people, and the produce divided with\r\n perfect equality among them, and if in a society thus constituted,\r\n industry were as energetic and the produce as ample as at the present\r\n time, there would be enough to make all the existing population\r\n extremely comfortable; but when that population had doubled itself,\r\n as, with existing habits of the people, under such an encouragement,\r\n it undoubtedly would in little more than twenty years, what would\r\n then be their condition? Unless the arts of production were in the\r\n same time improved in an almost unexampled degree, the inferior\r\n soils which must be resorted to, and the more laborious and scantily\r\n remunerative cultivation which must be employed on the superior\r\n soils, to procure food for so much larger a population, would, by\r\n an insuperable necessity, render every individual in the community\r\n poorer than before. If the population continued to increase at the\r\n same rate, a time would soon arrive when no one would have more than\r\n mere necessaries, and, soon after, a time when no one would have a\r\n sufficiency of those, and the further increase of population would be\r\n arrested by death.”[30]\r\n\r\nAll this I deny. I assert that the very reverse of these propositions\r\nis true. I assert that in any given state of civilization a greater\r\nnumber of people can collectively be better provided for than a\r\nsmaller. I assert that the injustice of society, not the niggardliness\r\nof nature, is the cause of the want and misery which the current theory\r\nattributes to over-population. I assert that the new mouths which an\r\nincreasing population calls into existence require no more food than\r\nthe old ones, while the hands they bring with them can in the natural\r\norder of things produce more. I assert that, other things being equal,\r\nthe greater the population, the greater the comfort which an equitable\r\ndistribution of wealth would give to each individual. I assert that in\r\na state of equality the natural increase of population would constantly\r\ntend to make every individual richer instead of poorer.\r\n\r\nI thus distinctly join issue, and submit the question to the test of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nBut observe (for even at the risk of repetition I wish to warn the\r\nreader against a confusion of thought that is observable even in\r\nwriters of great reputation), that the question of fact into which\r\nthis issue resolves itself is not in what stage of population is\r\nmost subsistence produced? but in what stage of population is there\r\nexhibited the greatest power of producing wealth? For the power of\r\nproducing wealth in any form is the power of producing subsistence—and\r\nthe consumption of wealth in any form, or of wealth-producing power,\r\nis equivalent to the consumption of subsistence. I have, for instance,\r\nsome money in my pocket. With it I may buy either food or cigars\r\nor jewelry or theater tickets, and just as I expend my money do I\r\ndetermine labor to the production of food, of cigars, of jewelry, or\r\nof theatrical representations. A set of diamonds has a value equal\r\nto so many barrels of flour—that is to say, it takes on the average\r\nas much labor to produce the diamonds as it would to produce so much\r\nflour. If I load my wife with diamonds, it is as much an exertion of\r\nsubsistence-producing power as though I had devoted so much food to\r\npurposes of ostentation. If I keep a footman, I take a possible plowman\r\nfrom the plow. The breeding and maintenance of a race-horse require\r\ncare and labor which would suffice for the breeding and maintenance\r\nof many work-horses. The destruction of wealth involved in a general\r\nillumination or the firing of a salute is equivalent to the burning\r\nup of so much food; the keeping of a regiment of soldiers, or of a\r\nwar-ship and her crew, is the diversion to unproductive uses of labor\r\nthat could produce subsistence for many thousands of people. Thus the\r\npower of any population to produce the necessaries of life is not to\r\nbe measured by the necessaries of life actually produced, but by the\r\nexpenditure of power in all modes.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity for abstract reasoning. The question is one of\r\nsimple fact. Does the relative power of producing wealth decrease with\r\nthe increase of population?\r\n\r\nThe facts are so patent that it is only necessary to call attention\r\nto them. We have, in modern times, seen many communities advance in\r\npopulation. Have they not at the same time advanced even more rapidly\r\nin wealth? We see many communities still increasing in population. Are\r\nthey not also increasing their wealth still faster? Is there any doubt\r\nthat while England has been increasing her population at the rate of\r\ntwo per cent. per annum, her wealth has been growing in still greater\r\nproportion? Is it not true that while the population of the United\r\nStates has been doubling every twenty-nine[31] years her wealth has\r\nbeen doubling at much shorter intervals? Is it not true that under\r\nsimilar conditions—that is to say, among communities of similar people\r\nin a similar stage of civilization—the most densely populated community\r\nis also the richest? Are not the more densely populated Eastern States\r\nricher in proportion to population than the more sparsely populated\r\nWestern or Southern States? Is not England, where population is\r\neven denser than in the Eastern States of the Union, also richer in\r\nproportion? Where will you find wealth devoted with the most lavishness\r\nto non-productive use—costly buildings, fine furniture, luxurious\r\nequipages, statues, pictures, pleasure gardens and yachts? Is it not\r\nwhere population is densest rather than where it is sparsest? Where\r\nwill you find in largest proportion those whom the general production\r\nsuffices to keep without productive labor on their part—men of income\r\nand of elegant leisure, thieves, policemen, menial servants, lawyers,\r\nmen of letters, and the like? Is it not where population is dense\r\nrather than where it is sparse? Whence is it that capital overflows for\r\nremunerative investment? Is it not from densely populated countries\r\nto sparsely populated countries? These things conclusively show that\r\nwealth is greatest where population is densest; that the production of\r\nwealth to a given amount of labor increases as population increases.\r\nThese things are apparent wherever we turn our eyes. On the same level\r\nof civilization, the same stage of the productive arts, government,\r\netc., the most populous countries are always the most wealthy.\r\n\r\nLet us take a particular case, and that a case which of all that\r\ncan be cited seems at first blush best to support the theory we are\r\nconsidering—the case of a community where, while population has largely\r\nincreased, wages have greatly decreased, and it is not a matter of\r\ndubious inference but of obvious fact that the generosity of nature\r\nhas lessened. That community is California. When upon the discovery of\r\ngold the first wave of immigration poured into California it found a\r\ncountry in which nature was in the most generous mood. From the river\r\nbanks and bars the glittering deposits of thousands of years could be\r\ntaken by the most primitive appliances, in amounts which made an ounce\r\n($16) per day only ordinary wages. The plains, covered with nutritious\r\ngrasses, were alive with countless herds of horses and cattle, so\r\nplenty that any traveler was at liberty to shift his saddle to a fresh\r\nsteed, or to kill a bullock if he needed a steak, leaving the hide, its\r\nonly valuable part, for the owner. From the rich soil which came first\r\nunder cultivation, the mere plowing and sowing brought crops that\r\nin older countries, if procured at all, can only be procured by the\r\nmost thorough manuring and cultivation. In early California, amid this\r\nprofusion of nature, wages and interest were higher than anywhere else\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThis virgin profusion of nature has been steadily giving way before\r\nthe greater and greater demands which an increasing population has\r\nmade upon it. Poorer and poorer diggings have been worked, until now\r\nno diggings worth speaking of can be found, and gold mining requires\r\nmuch capital, large skill, and elaborate machinery, and involves great\r\nrisks. “Horses cost money,” and cattle bred on the sage-brush plains\r\nof Nevada are brought by railroad across the mountains and killed in\r\nSan Francisco shambles, while farmers are beginning to save their straw\r\nand look for manure, and land is in cultivation which will hardly\r\nyield a crop three years out of four without irrigation. At the same\r\ntime wages and interest have steadily gone down. Many men are now glad\r\nto work for a week for less than they once demanded for the day, and\r\nmoney is loaned by the year for a rate which once would hardly have\r\nbeen thought extortionate by the month. Is the connection between the\r\nreduced productiveness of nature and the reduced rate of wages that of\r\ncause and effect? Is it true that wages are lower because labor yields\r\nless wealth? On the contrary! Instead of the wealth-producing power of\r\nlabor being less in California in 1879 than in 1849, I am convinced\r\nthat it is greater. And, it seems to me, that no one who considers how\r\nenormously during these years the efficiency of labor in California\r\nhas been increased by roads, wharves, flumes, railroads, steamboats,\r\ntelegraphs, and machinery of all kinds; by a closer connection with the\r\nrest of the world; and by the numberless economies resulting from a\r\nlarger population, can doubt that the return which labor receives from\r\nnature in California is on the whole much greater now than it was in\r\nthe days of unexhausted placers and virgin soil—the increase in the\r\npower of the human factor having more than compensated for the decline\r\nin the power of the natural factor. That this conclusion is the correct\r\none is proved by many facts which show that the consumption of wealth\r\nis now much greater, as compared with the number of laborers, than it\r\nwas then. Instead of a population composed almost exclusively of men\r\nin the prime of life, a large proportion of women and children are\r\nnow supported, and other non-producers have increased in much greater\r\nratio than the population; luxury has grown far more than wages have\r\nfallen; where the best houses were cloth and paper shanties, are now\r\nmansions whose magnificence rivals European palaces; there are liveried\r\ncarriages on the streets of San Francisco and pleasure yachts on her\r\nbay; the class who can live sumptuously on their incomes has steadily\r\ngrown; there are rich men beside whom the richest of the earlier years\r\nwould seem little better than paupers—in short, there are on every hand\r\nthe most striking and conclusive evidences that the production and\r\nconsumption of wealth have increased with even greater rapidity than\r\nthe increase of population, and that if any class obtains less it is\r\nsolely because of the greater inequality of distribution.\r\n\r\nWhat is obvious in this particular instance is obvious where the\r\nsurvey is extended. The richest countries are not those where nature\r\nis most prolific; but those where labor is most efficient—not Mexico,\r\nbut Massachusetts; not Brazil, but England. The countries where\r\npopulation is densest and presses hardest upon the capabilities of\r\nnature, are, other things being equal, the countries where the largest\r\nproportion of the produce can be devoted to luxury and the support of\r\nnon-producers, the countries where capital overflows, the countries\r\nthat upon exigency, such as war, can stand the greatest drain. That\r\nthe production of wealth must, in proportion to the labor employed,\r\nbe greater in a densely populated country like England than in new\r\ncountries where wages and interest are higher, is evident from the fact\r\nthat, though a much smaller proportion of the population is engaged in\r\nproductive labor, a much larger surplus is available for other purposes\r\nthan that of supplying physical needs. In a new country the whole\r\navailable force of the community is devoted to production—there is no\r\nwell man who does not do productive work of some kind, no well woman\r\nexempt from household tasks. There are no paupers or beggars, no idle\r\nrich, no class whose labor is devoted to ministering to the convenience\r\nor caprice of the rich, no purely literary or scientific class, no\r\ncriminal class who live by preying upon society, no large class\r\nmaintained to guard society against them. Yet with the whole force of\r\nthe community thus devoted to production, no such consumption of wealth\r\nin proportion to the whole population takes place, or can be afforded,\r\nas goes on in the old country; for, though the condition of the lowest\r\nclass is better, and there is no one who cannot get a living, there is\r\nno one who gets much more—few or none who can live in anything like\r\nwhat would be called luxury, or even comfort, in the older country.\r\nThat is to say, that in the older country the consumption of wealth in\r\nproportion to population is greater, although the proportion of labor\r\ndevoted to the production of wealth is less—or that fewer laborers\r\nproduce more wealth; for wealth must be produced before it can be\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be said, that the superior wealth of older countries\r\nis due not to superior productive power, but to the accumulations of\r\nwealth which the new country has not yet had time to make.\r\n\r\nIt will be well for a moment to consider this idea of accumulated\r\nwealth. The truth is, that wealth can be accumulated but to a slight\r\ndegree, and that communities really live, as the vast majority of\r\nindividuals live, from hand to mouth. Wealth will not bear much\r\naccumulation; except in a few unimportant forms it will not keep. The\r\nmatter of the universe, which, when worked up by labor into desirable\r\nforms, constitutes wealth, is constantly tending back to its original\r\nstate. Some forms of wealth will last for a few hours, some for a few\r\ndays, some for a few months, some for a few years; and there are very\r\nfew forms of wealth that can be passed from one generation to another.\r\nTake wealth in some of its most useful and permanent forms—ships,\r\nhouses, railways, machinery. Unless labor is constantly exerted in\r\npreserving and renewing them, they will almost immediately become\r\nuseless. Stop labor in any community, and wealth would vanish almost\r\nas the jet of a fountain vanishes when the flow of water is shut off.\r\nLet labor again exert itself, and wealth will almost as immediately\r\nreappear. This has been long noticed where war or other calamity has\r\nswept away wealth, leaving population unimpaired. There is not less\r\nwealth in London to-day because of the great fire of 1666; nor yet\r\nis there less wealth in Chicago because of the great fire of 1870.\r\nOn those fire-swept acres have arisen, under the hand of labor, more\r\nmagnificent buildings, filled with greater stocks of goods; and the\r\nstranger who, ignorant of the history of the city, passes along those\r\nstately avenues would not dream that a few years ago all lay so black\r\nand bare. The same principle—that wealth is constantly recreated—is\r\nobvious in every new city. Given the same population and the same\r\nefficiency of labor, and the town of yesterday will possess and\r\nenjoy as much as the town founded by the Romans. No one who has seen\r\nMelbourne or San Francisco can doubt that if the population of England\r\nwere transported to New Zealand, leaving all accumulated wealth behind,\r\nNew Zealand would soon be as rich as England is now; or, conversely,\r\nthat if the population of England were reduced to the sparseness of the\r\npresent population of New Zealand, in spite of accumulated wealth, they\r\nwould soon be as poor. Accumulated wealth seems to play just about such\r\na part in relation to the social organism as accumulated nutriment does\r\nto the physical organism. Some accumulated wealth is necessary, and to\r\na certain extent it may be drawn upon in exigencies; but the wealth\r\nproduced by past generations can no more account for the consumption\r\nof the present than the dinners he ate last year can supply a man with\r\npresent strength.\r\n\r\nBut without these considerations, which I allude to more for their\r\ngeneral than for their special bearing, it is evident that superior\r\naccumulations of wealth can account for greater consumption of wealth\r\nonly in cases where accumulated wealth is decreasing, and that wherever\r\nthe volume of accumulated wealth is maintained, and even more obviously\r\nwhere it is increasing, a greater consumption of wealth must imply\r\na greater production of wealth. Now, whether we compare different\r\ncommunities with each other, or the same community at different\r\ntimes, it is obvious that the progressive state, which is marked by\r\nincrease of population, is also marked by an increased consumption\r\nand an increased accumulation of wealth, not merely in the aggregate,\r\nbut per capita. And hence, increase of population, so far as it has\r\nyet anywhere gone, does not mean a reduction, but an increase in the\r\naverage production of wealth.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason of this is obvious. For, even if the increase of\r\npopulation does reduce the power of the natural factor of wealth, by\r\ncompelling a resort to poorer soils, etc., it yet so vastly increases\r\nthe power of the human factor as more than to compensate. Twenty men\r\nworking together will, where nature is niggardly, produce more than\r\ntwenty times the wealth that one man can produce where nature is\r\nmost bountiful. The denser the population the more minute becomes the\r\nsubdivision of labor, the greater the economies of production and\r\ndistribution, and, hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine\r\nis true; and, within the limits in which we have reason to suppose\r\nincrease would still go on, in any given state of civilization a\r\ngreater number of people can produce a larger proportionate amount of\r\nwealth, and more fully supply their wants, than can a smaller number.\r\n\r\nLook simply at the facts. Can anything be clearer than that the cause\r\nof the poverty which festers in the centers of civilization is not in\r\nthe weakness of the productive forces? In countries where poverty is\r\ndeepest, the forces of production are evidently strong enough, if fully\r\nemployed, to provide for the lowest not merely comfort but luxury.\r\nThe industrial paralysis, the commercial depression which curses the\r\ncivilized world to-day, evidently springs from no lack of productive\r\npower. Whatever be the trouble, it is clearly not in the want of\r\nability to produce wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is this very fact—that want appears where productive power is\r\ngreatest and the production of wealth is largest—that constitutes the\r\nenigma which perplexes the civilized world, and which we are trying\r\nto unravel. Evidently the Malthusian theory, which attributes want to\r\nthe decrease of productive power, will not explain it. That theory is\r\nutterly inconsistent with all the facts. It is really a gratuitous\r\nattribution to the laws of God of results which, even from this\r\nexamination, we may infer really spring from the mal-adjustments of\r\nmen—an inference which, as we proceed, will become a demonstration.

The first philosophical systems, in the same manner,\r\n are always the most complex, and a particular connecting chain, or\r\n principle, is generally thought necessary to unite every two seemingly\r\n disjointed appearances; but it often happens that one great connecting\r\n principle is afterward found to be sufficient to bind together all the\r\n discordant phenomena that occur in a whole species of things.—_Adam\r\n Smith_, _Essay on the Principles which Lead and Direct Philosophical\r\n Inquiries, as Illustrated by the History of Astronomy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE INQUIRY NARROWED TO THE LAWS OF DISTRIBUTION—THE NECESSARY RELATION\r\nOF THESE LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding examination has, I think, conclusively shown that the\r\nexplanation currently given, in the name of political economy, of the\r\nproblem we are attempting to solve, is no explanation at all.\r\n\r\nThat with material progress wages fail to increase, but rather tend\r\nto decrease, cannot be explained by the theory that the increase of\r\nlaborers constantly tends to divide into smaller portions the capital\r\nsum from which wages are paid. For, as we have seen, wages do not come\r\nfrom capital, but are the direct produce of labor. Each productive\r\nlaborer, as he works, creates his wages, and with every additional\r\nlaborer there is an addition to the true wages fund—an addition to the\r\ncommon stock of wealth, which, generally speaking, is considerably\r\ngreater than the amount he draws in wages.\r\n\r\nNor, yet, can it be explained by the theory that nature yields less to\r\nthe increasing drafts which an increasing population make upon her; for\r\nthe increased efficiency of labor makes the progressive state a state\r\nof continually increasing production per capita, and the countries of\r\ndensest population, other things being equal, are always the countries\r\nof greatest wealth.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have only increased the perplexities of the problem. We\r\nhave overthrown a theory which did, in some sort of fashion, explain\r\nexisting facts; but in doing so have only made existing facts seem\r\nmore inexplicable. It is as though, while the Ptolemaic theory was\r\nyet in its strength, it had been proved simply that the sun and\r\nstars do not revolve about the earth. The phenomena of day and night,\r\nand of the apparent motion of the celestial bodies, would yet remain\r\nunexplained, inevitably to reinstate the old theory unless a better\r\none took its place. Our reasoning has led us to the conclusion that\r\neach productive laborer produces his own wages, and that increase in\r\nthe number of laborers should increase the wages of each; whereas,\r\nthe apparent facts are that there are many laborers who cannot obtain\r\nremunerative employment, and that increase in the number of laborers\r\nbrings diminution of wages. We have, in short, proved that wages ought\r\nto be highest where in reality they are lowest.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even in doing this we have made some progress. Next to\r\nfinding what we look for, is to discover where it is useless to look.\r\nWe have at least narrowed the field of inquiry. For this, at least, is\r\nnow clear—that the cause which, in spite of the enormous increase of\r\nproductive power, confines the great body of producers to the least\r\nshare of the product upon which they will consent to live, is not the\r\nlimitation of capital, nor yet the limitation of the powers of nature\r\nwhich respond to labor. As it is not, therefore, to be found in the\r\nlaws which bound the production of wealth, it must be sought in the\r\nlaws which govern distribution. To them let us turn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to review in its main branches the whole subject\r\nof the distribution of wealth. To discover the cause which, as\r\npopulation increases and the productive arts advance, deepens the\r\npoverty of the lowest class, we must find the law which determines\r\nwhat part of the produce is distributed to labor as wages. To find the\r\nlaw of wages, or at least to make sure when we have found it, we must\r\nalso determine the laws which fix the part of the produce which goes\r\nto capital and the part which goes to land owners, for as land, labor,\r\nand capital join in producing wealth, it is between these three that\r\nthe produce must be divided. What is meant by the produce or production\r\nof a community is the sum of the wealth produced by that community—the\r\ngeneral fund from which, as long as previously existing stock is not\r\nlessened, all consumption must be met and all revenues drawn. As I\r\nhave already explained, production does not merely mean the making of\r\nthings, but includes the increase of value gained by transporting or\r\nexchanging things. There is a produce of wealth in a purely commercial\r\ncommunity, as there is in a purely agricultural or manufacturing\r\ncommunity; and in the one case, as in the others, some part of this\r\nproduce will go to capital, some part to labor, and some part, if\r\nland have any value, to the owners of land. As a matter of fact, a\r\nportion of the wealth produced is constantly going to the replacement\r\nof capital, which is constantly consumed and constantly replaced. But\r\nit is not necessary to take this into account, as it is eliminated by\r\nconsidering capital as continuous, which, in speaking or thinking of\r\nit, we habitually do. When we speak of the produce, we mean, therefore,\r\nthat part of the wealth produced above what is necessary to replace the\r\ncapital consumed in production; and when we speak of interest, or the\r\nreturn to capital, we mean what goes to capital after its replacement\r\nor maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt is, further, a matter of fact, that in every community which has\r\npassed the most primitive stage some portion of the produce is taken\r\nin taxation and consumed by government. But it is not necessary, in\r\nseeking the laws of distribution, to take this into consideration. We\r\nmay consider taxation either as not existing, or as by so much reducing\r\nthe produce. And so, too, of what is taken from the produce by certain\r\nforms of monopoly, which will be considered in a subsequent chapter\r\n(Chap. IV), and which exercise powers analogous to taxation. After we\r\nhave discovered the laws of distribution we can then see what bearing,\r\nif any, taxation has upon them.\r\n\r\nWe must discover these laws of distribution for ourselves—or, at least,\r\ntwo out of the three. For, that they are not, at least as a whole,\r\ncorrectly apprehended by the current political economy, may be seen,\r\nirrespective of our preceding examination of one of them, in any of the\r\nstandard treatises.\r\n\r\nThis is evident, in the first place, from the terminology employed.\r\n\r\nIn all politico-economic works we are told that the three factors in\r\nproduction are land, labor, and capital, and that the whole produce\r\nis primarily distributed into three corresponding parts. Three terms,\r\ntherefore, are needed, each of which shall clearly express one of these\r\nparts to the exclusion of the others. Rent, as defined, clearly enough\r\nexpresses the first of these parts—that which goes to the owners of\r\nland. Wages, as defined, clearly enough expresses the second—that part\r\nwhich constitutes the return to labor. But as to the third term—that\r\nwhich should express the return to capital—there is in the standard\r\nworks a most puzzling ambiguity and confusion.\r\n\r\nOf words in common use, that which comes nearest to exclusively\r\nexpressing the idea of return for the use of capital, is interest,\r\nwhich, as commonly used, implies the return for the use of capital,\r\nexclusive of any labor in its use or management, and exclusive of any\r\nrisk, except such as may be involved in the security. The word profits,\r\nas commonly used, is almost synonymous with revenue; it means a gain,\r\nan amount received in excess of an amount expended, and frequently\r\nincludes receipts that are properly rent; while it nearly always\r\nincludes receipts which are properly wages, as well as compensations\r\nfor the risk peculiar to the various uses of capital. Unless extreme\r\nviolence is done to the meaning of the word, it cannot, therefore, be\r\nused in political economy to signify that share of the produce which\r\ngoes to capital, in contradistinction to those parts which go to labor\r\nand to land owners.\r\n\r\nNow, all this is recognized in the standard works on political economy.\r\nAdam Smith well illustrates how wages and compensation for risk largely\r\nenter into profits, pointing out how the large profits of apothecaries\r\nand small retail dealers are in reality wages for their labor, and not\r\ninterest on their capital; and how the great profits sometimes made in\r\nrisky businesses, such as smuggling and the lumber trade, are really\r\nbut compensations for risk, which, in the long run, reduce the returns\r\nto capital so used to the ordinary, or below the ordinary, rate.\r\nSimilar illustrations are given in most of the subsequent works, where\r\nprofit is formally defined in its common sense, with, perhaps, the\r\nexclusion of rent. In all these works, the reader is told that profits\r\nare made up of three elements—wages of superintendence, compensation\r\nfor risk, and _interest_, or the return for the use of capital.\r\n\r\nThus, neither in its common meaning nor in the meaning expressly\r\nassigned to it in the current political economy, can profits have any\r\nplace in the discussion of the distribution of wealth between the three\r\nfactors of production. Either in its common meaning or in the meaning\r\nexpressly assigned to it, to talk about the distribution of wealth into\r\nrent, wages, and profits is like talking of the division of mankind\r\ninto men, women, and human beings.\r\n\r\nYet this, to the utter bewilderment of the reader, is what is done in\r\nall the standard works. After formally decomposing profits into wages\r\nof superintendence, compensation for risk, and interest—the net return\r\nfor the use of capital—they proceed to treat of the distribution of\r\nwealth between the rent of land, the wages of labor, and the PROFITS of\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nI doubt not that there are thousands of men who have vainly puzzled\r\ntheir brains over this confusion of terms, and abandoned the effort\r\nin despair, thinking that as the fault could not be in such great\r\nthinkers, it must be in their own stupidity. If it is any consolation\r\nto such men they may turn to Buckle’s “History of Civilization,” and\r\nsee how a man who certainly got a marvelously clear idea of what he\r\nread, and who had read carefully the principal economists from Smith\r\ndown, was inextricably confused by this jumble of profits and interest.\r\nFor Buckle (Vol. 1, Chap. II, and notes) persistently speaks of the\r\ndistribution of wealth into rent, wages, interest, _and_ profits.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not to be wondered at. For, after formally decomposing\r\nprofits into wages of superintendence, insurance, and interest, these\r\neconomists, in assigning causes which fix the general rate of profit,\r\nspeak of things which evidently affect only that part of profits which\r\nthey have denominated interest; and then, in speaking of the rate of\r\ninterest, either give the meaningless formula of supply and demand,\r\nor speak of causes which affect the compensation for risk; evidently\r\nusing the word in its common sense, and not in the economic sense they\r\nhave assigned to it, from which compensation for risk is eliminated.\r\nIf the reader will take up John Stuart Mill’s “Principles of Political\r\nEconomy,” and compare the chapter on Profits (Book II, Chap. 15) with\r\nthe chapter on Interest (Book III, Chap. 23), he will see the confusion\r\nthus arising exemplified in the case of the most logical of English\r\neconomists, in a more striking manner than I would like to characterize.\r\n\r\nNow, such men have not been led into such confusion of thought without\r\na cause. If they, one after another, have followed Dr. Adam Smith,\r\nas boys play “follow my leader,” jumping where he jumped, and falling\r\nwhere he fell, it has been that there was a fence where he jumped and a\r\nhole where he fell.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty from which this confusion has sprung is in the\r\npreaccepted theory of wages. For reasons which I have before assigned,\r\nit has seemed to them a self-evident truth that the wages of certain\r\nclasses of laborers depended upon the ratio between capital and the\r\nnumber of laborers. But there are certain kinds of reward for exertion\r\nto which this theory evidently will not apply, so the term wages has in\r\nuse been contracted to include only wages in the narrow common sense.\r\nThis being the case, if the term interest were used, as consistently\r\nwith their definitions it should have been used, to represent the third\r\npart of the division of the produce, all rewards of personal exertion,\r\nsave those of what are commonly called wage-workers, would clearly have\r\nbeen left out. But by treating the division of wealth as between rent,\r\nwages, and profits, instead of between rent, wages, and interest, this\r\ndifficulty is glossed over, all wages which will not fall under the\r\npreaccepted law of wages being vaguely grouped under profits, as wages\r\nof superintendence.\r\n\r\nTo read carefully what economists say about the distribution of wealth\r\nis to see that, though they correctly define it, wages, as they use\r\nit in this connection, is what logicians would call an undistributed\r\nterm—it does not mean all wages, but only some wages—viz., the wages\r\nof manual labor paid by an employer. So other wages are thrown over\r\nwith the return to capital, and included under the term profits,\r\nand any clear distinction between the returns to capital and the\r\nreturns to human exertion thus avoided. The fact is that the current\r\npolitical economy fails to give any clear and consistent account of the\r\ndistribution of wealth. The law of rent _is_ clearly stated, but it\r\nstands unrelated. The rest is a confused and incoherent jumble.\r\n\r\nThe very arrangement of these works shows this confusion and\r\ninconclusiveness of thought. In no politico-economic treatise that I\r\nknow of are these laws of distribution brought together, so that the\r\nreader can take them in at a glance and recognize their relation to\r\neach other; but what is said about each one is enveloped in a mass of\r\npolitical and moral reflections and dissertations. And the reason is\r\nnot far to seek. To bring together the three laws of distribution as\r\nthey are now taught, is to show at a glance that they lack necessary\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the distribution of wealth are obviously laws of\r\nproportion, and must be so related to each other that any two being\r\ngiven the third may be inferred. For to say that one of the three parts\r\nof a whole is increased or decreased, is to say that one or both of the\r\nother parts is, reversely, decreased or increased. If Tom, Dick, and\r\nHarry are partners in business, the agreement which fixes the share of\r\none in the profits must at the same time fix either the separate or the\r\njoint shares of the other two. To fix Tom’s share at forty per cent. is\r\nto leave but sixty per cent. to be divided between Dick and Harry. To\r\nfix Dick’s share at forty per cent. and Harry’s share at thirty-five\r\nper cent. is to fix Tom’s share at twenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\nBut between the laws of the distribution of wealth, as laid down in\r\nthe standard works, there is no such relation. If we fish them out and\r\nbring them together, we find them to be as follows:\r\n\r\nWages are determined by the ratio between the amount of capital devoted\r\nto the payment and subsistence of labor and the number of laborers\r\nseeking employment.\r\n\r\nRent is determined by the margin of cultivation; all lands yielding as\r\nrent that part of their produce which exceeds what an equal application\r\nof labor and capital could procure from the poorest land in use.\r\n\r\nInterest is determined by the equation between the demands of borrowers\r\nand the supply of capital offered by lenders. Or, if we take what is\r\ngiven as the law of profits, it is determined by wages, falling as\r\nwages rise and rising as wages fall—or, to use the phrase of Mill, by\r\nthe cost of labor to the capitalist.\r\n\r\nThe bringing together of these current statements of the laws of the\r\ndistribution of wealth shows at a glance that they lack the relation to\r\neach other which the true laws of distribution must have. They do not\r\ncorrelate and co-ordinate. Hence, at least two of these three laws are\r\neither wrongly apprehended or wrongly stated. This tallies with what we\r\nhave already seen, that the current apprehension of the law of wages,\r\nand, inferentially, of the law of interest, will not bear examination.\r\nLet us, then, seek the true laws of the distribution of the produce of\r\nlabor into wages, rent, and interest. The proof that we have found them\r\nwill be in their correlation—that they meet, and relate, and mutually\r\nbound each other.\r\n\r\nWith profits this inquiry has manifestly nothing to do. We want to\r\nfind what it is that determines the division of their joint produce\r\nbetween land, labor, and capital; and profits is not a term that\r\nrefers exclusively to any one of these three divisions. Of the three\r\nparts into which profits are divided by political economists—namely,\r\ncompensation for risk, wages of superintendence, and return for the use\r\nof capital—the latter falls under the term interest, which includes\r\nall the returns for the use of capital, and excludes everything else;\r\nwages of superintendence falls under the term wages, which includes\r\nall returns for human exertion, and excludes everything else; and\r\ncompensation for risk has no place whatever, as risk is eliminated\r\nwhen all the transactions of a community are taken together. I shall,\r\ntherefore, consistently with the definitions of political economists,\r\nuse the term interest as signifying that part of the produce which\r\ngoes to capital.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate:\r\n\r\nLand, labor, and capital are the factors of production. The term land\r\nincludes all natural opportunities or forces; the term labor, all human\r\nexertion; and the term capital, all wealth used to produce more wealth.\r\nIn returns to these three factors is the whole produce distributed.\r\nThat part which goes to land owners as payment for the use of natural\r\nopportunities is called rent; that part which constitutes the reward\r\nof human exertion is called wages; and that part which constitutes the\r\nreturn for the use of capital is called interest. These terms mutually\r\nexclude each other. The income of any individual may be made up from\r\nany one, two, or all three of these sources; but in the effort to\r\ndiscover the laws of distribution we must keep them separate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me premise the inquiry which we are about to undertake by saying\r\nthat the miscarriage of political economy, which I think has now been\r\nabundantly shown, can, it seems to me, be traced to the adoption of an\r\nerroneous standpoint. Living and making their observations in a state\r\nof society in which a capitalist generally rents land and hires labor,\r\nand thus seems to be the undertaker or first mover in production, the\r\ngreat cultivators of the science have been led to look upon capital\r\nas the prime factor in production, land as its instrument, and labor\r\nas its agent or tool. This is apparent on every page—in the form and\r\ncourse of their reasoning, in the character of their illustrations,\r\nand even in their choice of terms. Everywhere capital is the starting\r\npoint, the capitalist the central figure. So far does this go that both\r\nSmith and Ricardo use the term “natural wages” to express the minimum\r\nupon which laborers can live; whereas, unless injustice is natural, all\r\nthat the laborer produces should rather be held as his natural wages.\r\nThis habit of looking upon capital as the employer of labor has led\r\nboth to the theory that wages depend upon the relative abundance of\r\ncapital, and to the theory that interest varies inversely with wages,\r\nwhile it has led away from truths that but for this habit would have\r\nbeen apparent. In short, the misstep which, so far as the great laws of\r\ndistribution are concerned, has led political economy into the jungles,\r\ninstead of upon the mountain tops, was taken when Adam Smith, in his\r\nfirst book, left the standpoint indicated in the sentence, “The produce\r\nof labor constitutes the natural recompense or wages of labor,” to take\r\nthat in which capital is considered as employing labor and paying wages.\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the origin and natural sequence of things, this\r\norder is reversed; and capital instead of first is last; instead of\r\nbeing the employer of labor, it is in reality employed by labor. There\r\nmust be land before labor can be exerted, and labor must be exerted\r\nbefore capital can be produced. Capital is a result of labor, and is\r\nused by labor to assist it in further production. Labor is the active\r\nand initial force, and labor is therefore the employer of capital.\r\nLabor can be exerted only upon land, and it is from land that the\r\nmatter which it transmutes into wealth must be drawn. Land therefore is\r\nthe condition precedent, the field and material of labor. The natural\r\norder is land, labor, capital; and, instead of starting from capital as\r\nour initial point, we should start from land.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing to be observed. Capital is not a necessary\r\nfactor in production. Labor exerted upon land can produce wealth\r\nwithout the aid of capital, and in the necessary genesis of things must\r\nso produce wealth before capital can exist. Therefore the law of rent\r\nand the law of wages must correlate each other and form a perfect whole\r\nwithout reference to the law of capital, as otherwise these laws would\r\nnot fit the cases which can readily be imagined, and which to some\r\ndegree actually exist, in which capital takes no part in production.\r\nAnd as capital is, as is often said, but stored-up labor, it is but a\r\nform of labor, a subdivision of the general term labor; and its law\r\nmust be subordinate to, and independently correlate with, the law of\r\nwages, so as to fit cases in which the whole produce is divided between\r\nlabor and capital, without any deduction for rent. To resort to the\r\nillustration before used: The division of the produce between land,\r\nlabor and capital must be as it would be between Tom, Dick, and Harry,\r\nif Tom and Dick were the original partners, and Harry came in but as an\r\nassistant to and sharer with Dick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nRENT AND THE LAW OF RENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term rent, in its economic sense—that is, when used, as I am\r\nusing it, to distinguish that part of the produce which accrues to\r\nthe owners of land or other natural capabilities by virtue of their\r\nownership—differs in meaning from the word rent as commonly used.\r\nIn some respects this economic meaning is narrower than the common\r\nmeaning; in other respects it is wider.\r\n\r\nIt is narrower in this: In common speech, we apply the word rent to\r\npayments for the use of buildings, machinery, fixtures, etc., as well\r\nas to payments for the use of land or other natural capabilities; and\r\nin speaking of the rent of a house or the rent of a farm, we do not\r\nseparate the price for the use of the improvements from the price for\r\nthe use of the bare land. But in the economic meaning of rent, payments\r\nfor the use of any of the products of human exertion are excluded, and\r\nof the lumped payments for the use of houses, farms, etc., only that\r\npart is rent which constitutes the consideration for the use of the\r\nland—that part paid for the use of buildings or other improvements\r\nbeing properly interest, as it is a consideration for the use of\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIt is wider in this: In common speech we speak of rent only when owner\r\nand user are distinct persons. But in the economic sense there is also\r\nrent where the same person is both owner and user. Where owner and user\r\nare thus the same person, whatever part of his income he might obtain\r\nby letting the land to another is rent, while the return for his labor\r\nand capital are that part of his income which they would yield him did\r\nhe hire instead of owning the land. Rent is also expressed in a selling\r\nprice. When land is purchased, the payment which is made for the\r\nownership, or right to perpetual use, is rent commuted or capitalized.\r\nIf I buy land for a small price and hold it until I can sell it for\r\na large price, I have become rich, not by wages for my labor or by\r\ninterest upon my capital, but by the increase of rent. Rent, in short,\r\nis the share in the wealth produced which the exclusive right to the\r\nuse of natural capabilities gives to the owner. Wherever land has an\r\nexchange value there is rent in the economic meaning of the term.\r\nWherever land having a value is used, either by owner or hirer, there\r\nis rent actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a value, there\r\nis rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent which gives\r\nvalue to land. Until its ownership will confer some advantage, land has\r\nno value.[32]\r\n\r\nThus rent or land value does not arise from the productiveness or\r\nutility of land. It in no wise represents any help or advantage given\r\nto production, but simply the power of securing apart of the results\r\nof production. No matter what are its capabilities, land can yield\r\nno rent and have no value until some one is willing to give labor or\r\nthe results of labor for the privilege of using it; and what any one\r\nwill thus give depends not upon the capacity of the land, but upon its\r\ncapacity as compared with that of land that can be had for nothing. I\r\nmay have very rich land, but it will yield no rent and have no value\r\nso long as there is other land as good to be had without cost. But\r\nwhen this other land is appropriated, and the best land to be had for\r\nnothing is inferior, either in fertility, situation, or other quality,\r\nmy land will begin to have a value and yield rent. And though the\r\nproductiveness of my land may decrease, yet if the productiveness of\r\nthe land to be had without charge decreases in greater proportion, the\r\nrent I can get, and consequently the value of my land, will steadily\r\nincrease. Rent, in short, is the price of monopoly, arising from the\r\nreduction to individual ownership of natural elements which human\r\nexertion can neither produce nor increase.\r\n\r\nIf one man owned all the land accessible to any community, he could,\r\nof course, demand any price or condition for its use that he saw fit;\r\nand, as long as his ownership was acknowledged, the other members of\r\nthe community would have but death or emigration as the alternative to\r\nsubmission to his terms. This has been the case in many communities;\r\nbut in the modern form of society, the land, though generally reduced\r\nto individual ownership, is in the hands of too many different persons\r\nto permit the price which can be obtained for its use to be fixed\r\nby mere caprice or desire. While each individual owner tries to get\r\nall he can, there is a limit to what he can get, which constitutes\r\nthe market price or market rent of the land, and which varies with\r\ndifferent lands and at different times. The law, or relation, which,\r\nunder these circumstances of free competition among all parties, the\r\ncondition which in tracing out the principles of political economy is\r\nalways to be assumed, determines what rent or price can be got by the\r\nowner, is styled the law of rent. This fixed with certainty, we have\r\nmore than a starting point from which the laws which regulate wages\r\nand interest may be traced. For, as the distribution of wealth is a\r\ndivision, in ascertaining what fixes the share of the produce which\r\ngoes as rent, we also ascertain what fixes the share which is left for\r\nwages, where there is no co-operation of capital; and what fixes the\r\njoint share left for wages and interest, where capital does co-operate\r\nin production.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as to the law of rent there is no necessity for\r\ndiscussion. Authority here coincides with common sense,[33] and the\r\naccepted dictum of the current political economy has the self-evident\r\ncharacter of a geometric axiom. This accepted law of rent, which John\r\nStuart Mill denominates the _pons asinorum_ of political economy, is\r\nsometimes styled “Ricardo’s law of rent,” from the fact that, although\r\nnot the first to announce it, he first brought it prominently into\r\nnotice.[34] It is:\r\n\r\n_The rent of land is determined by the excess of its produce over that\r\nwhich the same application can secure from the least productive land in\r\nuse._\r\n\r\nThis law, which of course applies to land used for other purposes than\r\nagriculture, and to all natural agencies, such as mines, fisheries,\r\netc., has been exhaustively explained and illustrated by all the\r\nleading economists since Ricardo. But its mere statement has all the\r\nforce of a self-evident proposition, for it is clear that the effect of\r\ncompetition is to make the lowest reward for which labor and capital\r\nwill engage in production, the highest that they can claim; and hence\r\nto enable the owner of more productive land to appropriate in rent\r\nall the return above that required to recompense labor and capital at\r\nthe ordinary rate—that is to say, what they can obtain upon the least\r\nproductive land in use, or at the least productive point, where, of\r\ncourse, no rent is paid.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may conduce to a fuller understanding of the law of rent to\r\nput it in this form: The ownership of a natural agent of production\r\nwill give the power of appropriating so much of the wealth produced by\r\nthe exertion of labor and capital upon it as exceeds the return which\r\nthe same application of labor and capital could secure in the least\r\nproductive occupation in which they freely engage.\r\n\r\nThis, however, amounts to precisely the same thing, for there is no\r\noccupation in which labor and capital can engage which does not require\r\nthe use of land; and, furthermore, the cultivation or other use of land\r\nwill always be carried to as low a point of remuneration, all things\r\nconsidered, as is freely accepted in any other pursuit. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, a community in which part of the labor and capital is devoted\r\nto agriculture and part to manufactures. The poorest land cultivated\r\nyields an average return which we will call 20, and 20 therefore will\r\nbe the average return to labor and capital, as well in manufactures\r\nas in agriculture. Suppose that from some permanent cause the return\r\nin manufactures is now reduced to 15. Clearly, the labor and capital\r\nengaged in manufactures will turn to agriculture; and the process will\r\nnot stop until, either by the extension of cultivation to inferior\r\nlands or to inferior points on the same land, or by an increase in\r\nthe relative value of manufactured products, owing to the diminution\r\nof production—or, as a matter of fact, by both processes—the yield to\r\nlabor and capital in both pursuits has, all things considered, been\r\nbrought again to the same level, so that whatever be the final point of\r\nproductiveness at which manufactures are still carried on, whether it\r\nbe 18 or 17 or 16, cultivation will also be extended to that point.\r\nAnd, thus, to say that rent will be the excess in productiveness over\r\nthe yield at the margin, or lowest point, of cultivation, is the same\r\nthing as to say that it will be the excess of produce over what the\r\nsame amount of labor and capital obtains in the least remunerative\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThe law of rent is, in fact, but a deduction from the law of\r\ncompetition, and amounts simply to the assertion that as wages\r\nand interest tend to a common level, all that part of the general\r\nproduction of wealth which exceeds what the labor and capital employed\r\ncould have secured for themselves, if applied to the poorest natural\r\nagent in use, will go to land owners in the shape of rent. It rests,\r\nin the last analysis, upon the fundamental principle, which is to\r\npolitical economy what the attraction of gravitation is to physics—that\r\nmen will seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the law of rent. Although many standard treatises follow\r\ntoo much the example of Ricardo, who seems to view it merely in its\r\nrelation to agriculture, and in several places speaks of manufactures\r\nyielding no rent, when, in truth, manufactures and exchange yield\r\nthe highest rents, as is evinced by the greater value of land in\r\nmanufacturing and commercial cities, thus hiding the full importance of\r\nthe law, yet, ever since the time of Ricardo, the law itself has been\r\nclearly apprehended and fully recognized. But not so its corollaries.\r\nPlain as they are, the accepted doctrine of wages (backed and fortified\r\nnot only as has been hitherto explained, but by considerations\r\nwhose enormous weight will be seen when the logical conclusion\r\ntoward which we are tending is reached) has hitherto prevented their\r\nrecognition.[35] Yet, is it not as plain as the simplest geometrical\r\ndemonstration, that the corollary of the law of rent is the law of\r\nwages, where the division of the produce is simply between rent and\r\nwages; or the law of wages and interest taken together, where the\r\ndivision is into rent, wages, and interest? Stated reversely, the law\r\nof rent is necessarily the law of wages and interest taken together,\r\nfor it is the assertion, that no matter what be the production which\r\nresults from the application of labor and capital, these two factors\r\nwill receive in wages and interest only such part of the produce as\r\nthey could have produced on land free to them without the payment of\r\nrent—that is, the least productive land or point in use. For, if, of\r\nthe produce, all over the amount which labor and capital could secure\r\nfrom land for which no rent is paid must go to land owners as rent,\r\nthen all that can be claimed by labor and capital as wages and interest\r\nis the amount which they could have secured from land yielding no rent.\r\n\r\nOr to put it in algebraic form:\r\n\r\nAs Produce = Rent + Wages + Interest,\r\n\r\nTherefore, Produce-Rent = Wages + Interest.\r\n\r\nThus wages and interest do not depend upon the produce of labor and\r\ncapital, but upon what is left after rent is taken out; or, upon the\r\nproduce which they could obtain without paying rent—that is, from the\r\npoorest land in use. And hence, no matter what be the increase in\r\nproductive power, if the increase in rent keeps pace with it, neither\r\nwages nor interest can increase.\r\n\r\nThe moment this simple relation is recognized, a flood of light streams\r\nin upon what was before inexplicable, and seemingly discordant facts\r\nrange themselves under an obvious law. The increase of rent which\r\ngoes on in progressive countries is at once seen to be the key which\r\nexplains why wages and interest fail to increase with increase of\r\nproductive power. For the wealth produced in every community is divided\r\ninto two parts by what may be called the rent line, which is fixed by\r\nthe margin of cultivation, or the return which labor and capital could\r\nobtain from such natural opportunities as are free to them without\r\nthe payment of rent. From the part of the produce below this line\r\nwages and interest must be paid. All that is above goes to the owners\r\nof land. Thus, where the value of land is low, there may be a small\r\nproduction of wealth, and yet a high rate of wages and interest, as\r\nwe see in new countries. And, where the value of land is high, there\r\nmay be a very large production of wealth, and yet a low rate of wages\r\nand interest, as we see in old countries. And, where productive power\r\nincreases, as it is increasing in all progressive countries, wages and\r\ninterest will be affected, not by the increase, but by the manner in\r\nwhich rent is affected. If the value of land increases proportionately,\r\nall the increased production will be swallowed up by rent, and wages\r\nand interest will remain as before. If the value of land increases in\r\ngreater ratio than productive power, rent will swallow up even more\r\nthan the increase; and while the produce of labor and capital will be\r\nmuch larger, wages and interest will fall. It is only when the value of\r\nland fails to increase as rapidly as productive power, that wages and\r\ninterest can increase with the increase of productive power. All this\r\nis exemplified in actual fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] In speaking of the value of land I use and shall use the words as\r\nreferring to the value of the bare land. When I wish to speak of the\r\nvalue of land and improvements I shall use those words.\r\n\r\n[33] I do not mean to say that the accepted law of rent has never been\r\ndisputed. In all the nonsense that in the present disjointed condition\r\nof the science has been printed as political economy, it would be\r\nhard to find anything that has not been disputed. But I mean to say\r\nthat it has the sanction of all economic writers who are really to be\r\nregarded as authority. As John Stuart Mill says (Book II., Chap. XVI.),\r\n“there are few persons who have refused their assent to it, except\r\nfrom not having thoroughly understood it. The loose and inaccurate\r\nway in which it is often apprehended by those who affect to refute\r\nit is very remarkable.” An observation which has received many later\r\nexemplifications.\r\n\r\n[34] According to McCulloch the law of rent was first stated in a\r\npamphlet by Dr. James Anderson of Edinburgh in 1777, and simultaneously\r\nin the beginning of this century by Sir Edward West, Mr. Malthus, and\r\nMr. Ricardo.\r\n\r\n[35] Buckle (Chap. II., History of Civilization) recognizes the\r\nnecessary relation between rent, interest, and wages, but evidently\r\nnever worked it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF INTEREST AND THE CAUSE OF INTEREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made sure of the law of rent, we have obtained as its necessary\r\ncorollary the law of wages, where the division is between rent and\r\nwages; and the law of wages and interest taken together, where the\r\ndivision is between the three factors. What proportion of the produce\r\nis taken as rent must determine what proportion is left for wages, if\r\nbut land and labor are concerned; or to be divided between wages and\r\ninterest, if capital joins in the production.\r\n\r\nBut without reference to this deduction, let us seek each of these laws\r\nseparately and independently. If, when obtained in this way, we find\r\nthat they correlate, our conclusions will have the highest certainty.\r\n\r\nAnd, inasmuch as the discovery of the law of wages is the ultimate\r\npurpose of our inquiry, let us take up first the subject of interest.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the difference in meaning between the terms\r\nprofits and interest. It may be worth while, further, to say that\r\ninterest, as an abstract term in the distribution of wealth, differs\r\nin meaning from the word as commonly used, in this: That it includes\r\nall returns for the use of capital, and not merely those that pass from\r\nborrower to lender; and that it excludes compensation for risk, which\r\nforms so great a part of what is commonly called interest. Compensation\r\nfor risk is evidently only an equalization of return between different\r\nemployments of capital. What we want to find is, what fixes the general\r\nrate of interest proper? The different rates of compensation for risk\r\nadded to this will give the current rates of commercial interest.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that the greatest differences in what is ordinarily\r\ncalled interest are due to differences in risk; but it is also evident\r\nthat between different countries and different times there are also\r\nconsiderable variations in the rate of interest proper. In California\r\nat one time two per cent. a month would not have been considered\r\nextravagant interest on security on which loans could now be effected\r\nat seven or eight per cent. per annum, and though some part of the\r\ndifference may be due to an increased sense of general stability, the\r\ngreater part is evidently due to some other general cause. In the\r\nUnited States generally the rate of interest has been higher than in\r\nEngland; and in the newer States of the Union higher than in the older\r\nStates; and the tendency of interest to sink as society progresses is\r\nwell marked and has long been noticed. What is the law which will bind\r\nall these variations together and exhibit their cause?\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to dwell more than has hitherto incidentally been\r\ndone upon the failure of the current political economy to determine the\r\ntrue law of interest. Its speculations upon this subject have not the\r\ndefiniteness and coherency which have enabled the accepted doctrine of\r\nwages to withstand the evidence of fact, and do not require the same\r\nelaborate review. That they run counter to the facts is evident. That\r\ninterest does not depend on the productiveness of labor and capital\r\nis proved by the general fact that where labor and capital are most\r\nproductive interest is lowest. That it does not depend reversely upon\r\nwages (or the cost of labor), lowering as wages rise, and increasing as\r\nwages fall, is proved by the general fact that interest is high when\r\nand where wages are high, and low when and where wages are low.\r\n\r\nLet us begin at the beginning. The nature and functions of capital have\r\nalready been sufficiently shown, but even at the risk of something\r\nlike a digression, let us endeavor to ascertain the cause of interest\r\nbefore considering its law. For in addition to aiding our inquiry by\r\ngiving us a firmer and clearer grasp of the subject now in hand, it\r\nmay lead to conclusions whose practical importance will be hereafter\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason and justification of interest? Why should the\r\nborrower pay back to the lender more than he received? These questions\r\nare worth answering, not merely from their speculative, but from\r\ntheir practical importance. The feeling that interest is the robbery\r\nof industry is widespread and growing, and on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic shows itself more and more in popular literature and in\r\npopular movements. The expounders of the current political economy say\r\nthat there is no conflict between labor and capital, and oppose as\r\ninjurious to labor, as well as to capital, all schemes for restricting\r\nthe reward which capital obtains; yet in the same works the doctrine\r\nis laid down that wages and interest bear to each other an inverse\r\nrelation, and that interest will be low or high as wages are high or\r\nlow.[36] Clearly, then, if this doctrine is correct, the only objection\r\nthat from the standpoint of the laborer can be logically made to\r\nany scheme for the reduction of interest is that it will not work,\r\nwhich is manifestly very weak ground while ideas of the omnipotence\r\nof legislatures are yet so widespread; and though such an objection\r\nmay lead to the abandonment of any one particular scheme, it will not\r\nprevent the search for another.\r\n\r\nWhy should interest be? Interest, we are told, in all the standard\r\nworks, is the reward of abstinence. But, manifestly, this does not\r\nsufficiently account for it. Abstinence is not an active, but a passive\r\nquality; it is not a doing—it is simply a not doing. Abstinence in\r\nitself produces nothing. Why, then, should any part of what is produced\r\nbe claimed for it? If I have a sum of money which I lock up for a\r\nyear, I have exercised as much abstinence as though I had loaned it.\r\nYet, though in the latter case I will expect it to be returned to me\r\nwith an additional sum by way of interest, in the former I will have\r\nbut the same sum, and no increase. But the abstinence is the same. If\r\nit be said that in lending it I do the borrower a service, it may be\r\nreplied that he also does me a service in keeping it safely—a service\r\nthat under some conditions may be very valuable, and for which I would\r\nwillingly pay, rather than not have it; and a service which, as to\r\nsome forms of capital, may be even more obvious than as to money.\r\nFor there are many forms of capital which will not keep, but must be\r\nconstantly renewed; and many which are onerous to maintain if one has\r\nno immediate use for them. So, if the accumulator of capital helps the\r\nuser of capital by loaning it to him, does not the user discharge the\r\ndebt in full when he hands it back? Is not the secure preservation,\r\nthe maintenance, the re-creation of capital, a complete offset to the\r\nuse? Accumulation is the end and aim of abstinence. Abstinence can go\r\nno further and accomplish no more; nor of itself can it even do this.\r\nIf we were merely to abstain from using it, how much wealth would\r\ndisappear in a year! And how little would be left at the end of two\r\nyears! Hence, if more is demanded for abstinence than the safe return\r\nof capital, is not labor wronged? Such ideas as these underlie the\r\nwidespread opinion that interest can accrue only at the expense of\r\nlabor, and is in fact a robbery of labor which in a social condition\r\nbased on justice would be abolished.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to refute these views do not appear to me always\r\nsuccessful. For instance, as it illustrates the usual reasoning, take\r\nBastiat’s oft-quoted illustration of the plane. One carpenter, James,\r\nat the expense of ten days’ labor, makes himself a plane, which will\r\nlast in use for 290 of the 300 working days of the year. William,\r\nanother carpenter, proposes to borrow the plane for a year, offering\r\nto give back at the end of that time, when the plane will be worn out,\r\na new plane equally as good. James objects to lending the plane on\r\nthese terms, urging that if he merely gets back a plane he will have\r\nnothing to compensate him for the loss of the advantage which the use\r\nof the plane during the year would give him. William, admitting this,\r\nagrees not merely to return a plane, but, in addition, to give James\r\na new plank. The agreement is carried out to mutual satisfaction. The\r\nplane is used up during the year, but at the end of the year James\r\nreceives as good a one, and a plank in addition. He lends the new\r\nplane again and again, until finally it passes into the hands of his\r\nson, “who still continues to lend it,” receiving a plank each time.\r\nThis plank, which represents interest, is said to be a natural and\r\nequitable remuneration, as by giving it in return for the use of the\r\nplane, William “obtains the power which exists in the tool to increase\r\nthe productiveness of labor,” and is no worse off than he would have\r\nbeen had he not borrowed the plane; while James obtains no more than he\r\nwould have had if he had retained and used the plane instead of lending\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIs this really so? It will be observed that it is not affirmed that\r\nJames could make the plane and William could not, for that would be\r\nto make the plank the reward of superior skill. It is only that James\r\nhad abstained from consuming the result of his labor until he had\r\naccumulated it in the form of a plane—which is the essential idea of\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nNow, if James had not lent the plane he could have used it for 290\r\ndays, when it would have been worn out, and he would have been obliged\r\nto take the remaining ten days of the working year to make a new\r\nplane. If William had not borrowed the plane he would have taken\r\nten days to make himself a plane, which he could have used for the\r\nremaining 290 days. Thus, if we take a plank to represent the fruits\r\nof a day’s labor with the aid of a plane, at the end of the year, had\r\nno borrowing taken place, each would have stood with reference to the\r\nplane as he commenced, James with a plane, and William with none, and\r\neach would have had as the result of the year’s work 290 planks. If\r\nthe condition of the borrowing had been what William first proposed,\r\nthe return of a new plane, the same relative situation would have been\r\nsecured. William would have worked for 290 days, and taken the last\r\nten days to make the new plane to return to James. James would have\r\ntaken the first ten days of the year to make another plane which would\r\nhave lasted for 290 days, when he would have received a new plane from\r\nWilliam. Thus, the simple return of the plane would have put each in\r\nthe same position at the end of the year as if no borrowing had taken\r\nplace. James would have lost nothing to the gain of William, and\r\nWilliam would have gained nothing to the loss of James. Each would have\r\nhad the return his labor would otherwise have yielded—viz., 290 planks,\r\nand James would have had the advantage with which he started, a new\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nBut when, in addition to the return of a plane, a plank is given, James\r\nat the end of the year will be in a better position than if there had\r\nbeen no borrowing, and William in a worse. James will have 291 planks\r\nand a new plane, and William 289 planks and no plane. If William now\r\nborrows the plank as well as the plane on the same terms as before,\r\nhe will at the end of the year have to return to James a plane, two\r\nplanks and a fraction of a plank; and if this difference be again\r\nborrowed, and so on, is it not evident that the income of the one\r\nwill progressively decline, and that of the other will progressively\r\nincrease, until at length, if the operation be continued, the time will\r\ncome when, as the result of the original lending of a plane, James will\r\nobtain the whole result of William’s labor—that is to say, William will\r\nbecome virtually his slave?\r\n\r\nIs interest, then, natural and equitable? There is nothing in this\r\nillustration to show it to be. Evidently what Bastiat (and many others)\r\nassigns as the basis of interest, “the power which exists in the\r\ntool to increase the productiveness of labor,” is neither in justice\r\nnor in fact the basis of interest. The fallacy which makes Bastiat’s\r\nillustration pass as conclusive with those who do not stop to analyze\r\nit, as we have done, is that with the loan of the plane they associate\r\nthe transfer of the increased productive power which a plane gives to\r\nlabor. But this is really not involved. The essential thing which James\r\nloaned to William was not the increased power which labor acquires\r\nfrom using planes. To suppose this, we should have to suppose that the\r\nmaking and using of planes was a trade secret or a patent right, when\r\nthe illustration would become one of monopoly, not of capital. The\r\nessential thing which James loaned to William was not the privilege of\r\napplying his labor in a more effective way, but the use of the concrete\r\nresult of ten days’ labor. If “the power which exists in tools to\r\nincrease the productiveness of labor” were the cause of interest, then\r\nthe rate of interest would increase with the march of invention. This\r\nis not so. Nor yet will I be expected to pay more interest if I borrow\r\na fifty-dollar sewing machine than if I borrow fifty dollars’ worth of\r\nneedles; if I borrow a steam engine than if I borrow a pile of bricks\r\nof equal value. Capital, like wealth, is interchangeable. It is not\r\none thing; it is anything to that value within the circle of exchange.\r\nNor yet does the improvement of tools add to the reproductive power of\r\ncapital; it adds to the productive power of labor.\r\n\r\nAnd I am inclined to think that if all wealth consisted of such things\r\nas planes, and all production was such as that of carpenters—that is\r\nto say, if wealth consisted but of the inert matter of the universe,\r\nand production of working up this inert matter into different shapes,\r\nthat interest would be but the robbery of industry, and could not\r\nlong exist. This is not to say that there would be no accumulation,\r\nfor though the hope of increase is a motive for turning wealth into\r\ncapital, it is not the motive, or, at least, not the main motive, for\r\naccumulating. Children will save their pennies for Christmas; pirates\r\nwill add to their buried treasure; Eastern princes will accumulate\r\nhoards of coin; and men like Stewart or Vanderbilt, having become once\r\npossessed of the passion of accumulating, would continue as long as\r\nthey could to add to their millions, even though accumulation brought\r\nno increase. Nor yet is it to say that there would be no borrowing\r\nor lending, for this, to a large extent, would be prompted by mutual\r\nconvenience. If William had a job of work to be immediately begun and\r\nJames one that would not commence until ten days thereafter, there\r\nmight be a mutual advantage in the loan of the plane, though no plank\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\nBut all wealth is not of the nature of planes, or planks, or money,\r\nwhich has no reproductive power; nor is all production merely the\r\nturning into other forms of this inert matter of the universe. It is\r\ntrue that if I put away money, it will not increase. But suppose,\r\ninstead, I put away wine. At the end of a year I will have an increased\r\nvalue, for the wine will have improved in quality. Or supposing that\r\nin a country adapted to them, I set out bees; at the end of a year I\r\nwill have more swarms of bees, and the honey which they have made.\r\nOr, supposing, where there is a range, I turn out sheep, or hogs, or\r\ncattle; at the end of the year I will, upon the average, also have an\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nNow what gives the increase in these cases is something which, though\r\nit generally requires labor to utilize it, is yet distinct and\r\nseparable from labor—the active power of nature; the principle of\r\ngrowth, of reproduction, which everywhere characterizes all the forms\r\nof that mysterious thing or condition which we call life. And it seems\r\nto me that it is this which is the cause of interest, or the increase\r\nof capital over and above that due to labor. There are, so to speak,\r\nin the movements which make up the everlasting flux of nature, certain\r\nvital currents, which will, if we use them, aid us, with a force\r\nindependent of our own efforts, in turning matter into the forms we\r\ndesire—that is to say, into wealth.\r\n\r\nWhile many things might be mentioned which, like money, or planes, or\r\nplanks, or engines, or clothing, have no innate power of increase, yet\r\nother things are included in the terms wealth and capital which, like\r\nwine, will of themselves increase in quality up to a certain point;\r\nor, like bees or cattle, will of themselves increase in quantity; and\r\ncertain other things, such as seeds, which, though the conditions which\r\nenable them to increase may not be maintained without labor, yet will,\r\nwhen these conditions are maintained, yield an increase, or give a\r\nreturn over and above that which is to be attributed to labor.\r\n\r\nNow the interchangeability of wealth necessarily involves an average\r\nbetween all the species of wealth of any special advantage which\r\naccrues from the possession of any particular species, for no one\r\nwould keep capital in one form when it could be changed into a more\r\nadvantageous form. No one, for instance, would grind wheat into flour\r\nand keep it on hand for the convenience of those who desire from time\r\nto time to exchange wheat or its equivalent for flour, unless he could\r\nby such exchange secure an increase equal to that which, all things\r\nconsidered, he could secure by planting his wheat. No one, if he could\r\nkeep them, would exchange a flock of sheep now for their net weight in\r\nmutton to be returned next year; for by keeping the sheep he would not\r\nonly have the same amount of mutton next year, but also the lambs and\r\nthe fleeces. No one would dig an irrigating ditch, unless those who by\r\nits aid are enabled to utilize the reproductive forces of nature would\r\ngive him such a portion of the increase they receive as to make his\r\ncapital yield him as much as theirs. And so, in any circle of exchange,\r\nthe power of increase which the reproductive or vital force of nature\r\ngives to some species of capital must average with all; and he who\r\nlends, or uses in exchange, money, or planes, or bricks, or clothing,\r\nis not deprived of the power to obtain an increase, any more than if he\r\nhad lent or put to a reproductive use so much capital in a form capable\r\nof increase.\r\n\r\nThere is also in the utilization of the variations in the powers of\r\nnature and of man which is effected by exchange, an increase which\r\nsomewhat resembles that produced by the vital forces of nature. In\r\none place, for instance, a given amount of labor will secure 200\r\nin vegetable food or 100 in animal food. In another place, these\r\nconditions are reversed, and the same amount of labor will produce 100\r\nin vegetable food or 200 in animal. In the one place, the relative\r\nvalue of vegetable to animal food will be as two to one, and in the\r\nother as one to two; and, supposing equal amounts of each to be\r\nrequired, the same amount of labor will in either place secure 150 of\r\nboth. But by devoting labor in the one place to the procurement of\r\nvegetable food, and in the other, to the procurement of animal food,\r\nand exchanging to the quantity required, the people of each place\r\nwill be enabled by the given amount of labor to procure 200 of both,\r\nless the losses and expenses of exchange; so that in each place the\r\nproduce which is taken from use and devoted to exchange brings back an\r\nincrease. Thus Whittington’s cat, sent to a far country where cats are\r\nscarce and rats are plenty, returns in bales of goods and bags of gold.\r\n\r\nOf course, labor is necessary to exchange, as it is to the utilization\r\nof the reproductive forces of nature, and the produce of exchange,\r\nas the produce of agriculture, is clearly the produce of labor; but\r\nyet, in the one case as in the other, there is a distinguishable force\r\ncooperating with that of labor, which makes it impossible to measure\r\nthe result solely by the amount of labor expended, but renders the\r\namount of capital and the time it is in use integral parts in the\r\nsum of forces. Capital aids labor in all of the different modes of\r\nproduction, but there is a distinction between the relations of the two\r\nin such modes of production as consist merely of changing the form or\r\nplace of matter, as planing boards or mining coal; and such modes of\r\nproduction as avail themselves of the reproductive forces of nature, or\r\nof the power of increase arising from differences in the distribution\r\nof natural and human powers, such as the raising of grain or the\r\nexchange of ice for sugar. In production of the first kind, labor\r\nalone is the efficient cause; when labor stops, production stops. When\r\nthe carpenter drops his plane as the sun sets, the increase of value,\r\nwhich he with his plane is producing, ceases until he begins his labor\r\nagain the following morning. When the factory bell rings for closing,\r\nwhen the mine is shut down, production ends until work is resumed.\r\nThe intervening time, so far as regards production, might as well be\r\nblotted out. The lapse of days, the change of seasons is no element in\r\nthe production that depends solely upon the amount of labor expended.\r\nBut in the other modes of production to which I have referred, and in\r\nwhich the part of labor may be likened to the operations of lumbermen\r\nwho throw their logs into the stream, leaving it to the current to\r\ncarry them to the boom of the sawmill many miles below, time _is_ an\r\nelement. The seed in the ground germinates and grows while the farmer\r\nsleeps or plows new fields, and the everflowing currents of air and\r\nocean bear Whittington’s cat toward the rat-tormented ruler in the\r\nregions of romance.\r\n\r\nTo recur now to Bastiat’s illustration. It is evident that if there is\r\nany reason why William at the end of the year should return to James\r\nmore than an equally good plane, it does not spring, as Bastiat has\r\nit, from the increased power which the tool gives to labor, for that,\r\nas I have shown, is not an element; but it springs from the element\r\nof time—the difference of a year between the lending and return of\r\nthe plane. Now, if the view is confined to the illustration, there is\r\nnothing to suggest how this element should operate, for a plane at the\r\nend of the year has no greater value than a plane at the beginning. But\r\nif we substitute for the plane a calf, it is clearly to be seen that to\r\nput James in as good a position as if he had not lent, William at the\r\nend of the year must return, not a calf, but a cow. Or, if we suppose\r\nthat the ten days’ labor had been devoted to planting corn, it is\r\nevident that James would not have been fully recompensed if at the end\r\nof the year he had received simply so much planted corn, for during the\r\nyear the planted corn would have germinated and grown and multiplied;\r\nand so if the plane had been devoted to exchange, it might during the\r\nyear have been turned over several times, each exchange yielding an\r\nincrease to James. Now, therefore, as James’ labor might have been\r\napplied in any of those ways—or what amounts to the same thing, some of\r\nthe labor devoted to making planes might have been thus transferred—he\r\nwill not make a plane for William to use for the year unless he gets\r\nback more than a plane. And William can afford to give back more than\r\na plane, because the same general average of the advantages of labor\r\napplied in different modes will enable him to obtain from his labor an\r\nadvantage from the element of time. It is this general averaging, or\r\nas we may say, “pooling” of advantages, which necessarily takes place\r\nwhere the exigencies of society require the simultaneous carrying on\r\nof the different modes of production, which gives to the possession of\r\nwealth incapable in itself of increase an advantage similar to that\r\nwhich attaches to wealth used in such a way as to gain from the element\r\nof time. And, in the last analysis, the advantage which is given by\r\nthe lapse of time springs from the generative force of nature and the\r\nvarying powers of nature and of man.\r\n\r\nWere the quality and capacity of matter everywhere uniform, and all\r\nproductive power in man, there would be no interest. The advantage\r\nof superior tools might at times be transferred on terms resembling\r\nthe payment of interest, but such transactions would be irregular and\r\nintermittent—the exception, not the rule. For the power of obtaining\r\nsuch returns would not, as now, inhere in the possession of capital,\r\nand the advantage of time would operate only in peculiar circumstances.\r\nThat I, having a thousand dollars, can certainly let it out at\r\ninterest, does not arise from the fact that there are others, not\r\nhaving a thousand dollars, who will gladly pay me for the use of it,\r\nif they can get it no other way; but from the fact that the capital\r\nwhich my thousand dollars represents has the power of yielding an\r\nincrease to whomsoever has it, even though he be a millionaire. For the\r\nprice which anything will bring does not depend upon what the buyer\r\nwould be willing to give rather than go without it, so much as upon\r\nwhat the seller can otherwise get. For instance, a manufacturer who\r\nwishes to retire from business has machinery to the value of $100,000.\r\nIf he cannot, should he sell, take this $100,000 and invest it so\r\nthat it will yield him interest, it will be immaterial to him, risk\r\nbeing eliminated, whether he obtains the whole price at once or in\r\ninstallments, and if the purchaser has the requisite capital, which we\r\nmust suppose in order that the transaction may rest on its own merits,\r\nit will be immaterial whether he pay at once or after a time. If the\r\npurchaser has not the required capital, it may be to his convenience\r\nthat payments should be delayed, but it would be only in exceptional\r\ncircumstances that the seller would ask, or the buyer would consent, to\r\npay any premium on this account; nor in such cases would this premium\r\nbe properly interest. For interest is not properly a payment made for\r\nthe use of capital, but a return accruing from the increase of capital.\r\nIf the capital did not yield an increase, the cases would be few and\r\nexceptional in which the owner would get a premium. William would soon\r\nfind out if it did not pay him to give a plank for the privilege of\r\ndeferring payment on James’ plane.\r\n\r\nIn short, when we come to analyze production we find it to fall into\r\nthree modes—viz:\r\n\r\nADAPTING, or changing natural products either in form or in place so as\r\nto fit them for the satisfaction of human desire.\r\n\r\nGROWING, or utilizing the vital forces of nature, as by raising\r\nvegetables or animals.\r\n\r\nEXCHANGING, or utilizing, so as to add to the general sum of wealth,\r\nthe higher powers of those natural forces which vary with locality,\r\nor of those human forces which vary with situation, occupation, or\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn each of these three modes of production capital may aid labor—or, to\r\nspeak more precisely, in the first mode capital may aid labor, but is\r\nnot absolutely necessary; in the others capital must aid labor, or is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nNow, while by adapting capital in proper forms we may increase the\r\neffective power of labor to impress upon matter the character of\r\nwealth, as when we adapt wood and iron to the form and use of a plane;\r\nor iron, coal, water, and oil to the form and use of a steam engine;\r\nor stone, clay, timber, and iron to that of a building, yet the\r\ncharacteristic of this use of capital is, that the benefit is in the\r\nuse. When, however, we employ capital in the second of these modes, as\r\nwhen we plant grain in the ground, or place animals on a stock farm,\r\nor put away wine to improve with age, the benefit arises, not from\r\nthe use, but from the increase. And so, when we employ capital in the\r\nthird of these modes, and instead of using a thing we exchange it, the\r\nbenefit is in the increase or greater value of the things received in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the benefits which arise from use go to labor, and the\r\nbenefits which arise from increase, to capital. But, inasmuch as the\r\ndivision of labor and the interchangeability of wealth necessitate and\r\nimply an averaging of benefits, in so far as these different modes of\r\nproduction correlate with each other, the benefits that arise from one\r\nwill average with the benefits that arise from the others, for neither\r\nlabor nor capital will be devoted to any mode of production while any\r\nother mode which is open to them will yield a greater return. That is\r\nto say, labor expended in the first mode of production will get, not\r\nthe whole return, but the return minus such part as is necessary to\r\ngive to capital such an increase as it could have secured in the other\r\nmodes of production, and capital engaged in the second and third modes\r\nwill obtain, not the whole increase, but the increase minus what is\r\nsufficient to give to labor such reward as it could have secured if\r\nexpended in the first mode.\r\n\r\nThus interest springs from the power of increase which the reproductive\r\nforces of nature, and the in effect analogous capacity for exchange,\r\ngive to capital. It is not an arbitrary, but a natural thing; it is\r\nnot the result of a particular social organization, but of laws of the\r\nuniverse which underlie society. It is, therefore, just.\r\n\r\nThey who talk about abolishing interest fall into an error similar to\r\nthat previously pointed out as giving its plausibility to the doctrine\r\nthat wages are drawn from capital. When they thus think of interest,\r\nthey think only of that which is paid by the user of capital to the\r\nowner of capital. But, manifestly, this is not all interest, but only\r\nsome interest. Whoever uses capital and obtains the increase it is\r\ncapable of giving receives interest. If I plant and care for a tree\r\nuntil it comes to maturity, I receive, in its fruit, interest upon the\r\ncapital I have thus accumulated—that is, the labor I have expended. If\r\nI raise a cow, the milk which she yields me, morning and evening, is\r\nnot merely the reward of the labor then exerted; but interest upon the\r\ncapital which my labor, expended in raising her, has accumulated in the\r\ncow. And so, if I use my own capital in directly aiding production,\r\nas by machinery, or in indirectly aiding production, in exchange, I\r\nreceive a special and distinguishable advantage from the reproductive\r\ncharacter of capital, which is as real, though perhaps not as clear, as\r\nthough I had lent my capital to another and he had paid me interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] This is really said of profits, but with the evident meaning of\r\nreturns to capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF SPURIOUS CAPITAL AND OF PROFITS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR INTEREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belief that interest is the robbery of industry is, I am persuaded,\r\nin large part due to a failure to discriminate between what is really\r\ncapital and what is not, and between profits which are properly\r\ninterest and profits which arise from other sources than the use of\r\ncapital. In the speech and literature of the day every one is styled a\r\ncapitalist who possesses what, independent of his labor, will yield him\r\na return, while whatever is thus received is spoken of as the earnings\r\nor takings of capital, and we everywhere hear of the conflict of labor\r\nand capital. Whether there is, in reality, any conflict between labor\r\nand capital, I do not yet ask the reader to make up his mind; but it\r\nwill be well here to clear away some misapprehensions which confuse the\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been called to the fact that land values, which\r\nconstitute such an enormous part of what is commonly called capital,\r\nare not capital at all; and that rent, which is as commonly included in\r\nthe receipts of capital, and which takes an ever-increasing portion of\r\nthe produce of an advancing community, is not the earnings of capital,\r\nand must be carefully separated from interest. It is not necessary now\r\nto dwell further upon this point. Attention has likewise been called to\r\nthe fact that the stocks, bonds, etc., which constitute another great\r\npart of what is commonly called capital, are not capital at all; but,\r\nin some of their shapes, these evidences of indebtedness so closely\r\nresemble capital, and in some cases actually perform, or seem to\r\nperform, the functions of capital, while they yield a return to their\r\nowners which is not only spoken of as interest, but has every semblance\r\nof interest, that it is worth while, before attempting to clear the\r\nidea of interest from some other ambiguities that beset it, to speak\r\nagain of these at greater length.\r\n\r\nNothing can be capital, let it always be remembered, that is not\r\nwealth—that is to say, nothing can be capital that does not consist\r\nof actual, tangible things, not the spontaneous offerings of nature,\r\nwhich have in themselves, and not by proxy, the power of directly or\r\nindirectly ministering to human desire.\r\n\r\nThus, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the\r\nrepresentative of capital. The capital that was once received for\r\nit by the government has been consumed unproductively—blown away\r\nfrom the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships, expended in keeping\r\nmen marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond cannot\r\nrepresent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent\r\ncapital at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government\r\nwill, some time or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock\r\nof the people, so much wealth, which it will turn over to the holder\r\nof the bond; and that, in the meanwhile, it will, from time to time,\r\ntake, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder the increase\r\nwhich so much capital as it some day promises to give him would yield\r\nhim were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are\r\nthus taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on\r\npublic debts are not the earnings or increase of capital—are not really\r\ninterest in the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the\r\nproduce of labor and capital, leaving so much less for wages and so\r\nmuch less for real interest.\r\n\r\nBut, supposing the bonds have been issued for the deepening of a river\r\nbed, the construction of lighthouses, or the erection of a public\r\nmarket; or supposing, to embody the same idea while changing the\r\nillustration, they have been issued by a railroad company. Here they do\r\nrepresent capital, existing and applied to productive uses, and like\r\nstock in a dividend paying company may be considered as evidences of\r\nthe ownership of capital. But they can be so considered only in so far\r\nas they actually represent capital, and not as they have been issued in\r\nexcess of the capital used. Nearly all our railroad companies and other\r\nincorporations are loaded down in this way. Where one dollar’s worth of\r\ncapital has been really used, certificates for two, three, four, five,\r\nor even ten, have been issued, and upon this fictitious amount interest\r\nor dividends are paid with more or less regularity. Now, what, in\r\nexcess of the amount due as interest to the real capital invested, is\r\nthus earned by these companies and thus paid out, as well as the large\r\nsums absorbed by managing rings and never accounted for, is evidently\r\nnot taken from the aggregate produce of the community on account of the\r\nservices rendered by capital—it is not interest. If we are restricted\r\nto the terminology of economic writers who decompose profits into\r\ninterest, insurance, and wages of superintendence, it must fall into\r\nthe category of wages of superintendence.\r\n\r\nBut while wages of superintendence clearly enough include the income\r\nderived from such personal qualities as skill, tact, enterprise,\r\norganizing ability, inventive power, character, etc., to the profits we\r\nare speaking of there is another contributing element, which can only\r\narbitrarily be classed with these—the element of monopoly.\r\n\r\nWhen James I. granted to his minion the exclusive privilege of making\r\ngold and silver thread, and prohibited, under severe penalties, every\r\none else from making such thread, the income which Buckingham enjoyed\r\nin consequence did not arise from the interest upon the capital\r\ninvested in the manufacture, nor from the skill, etc., of those\r\nwho really conducted the operations, but from what he got from the\r\nking—viz., the exclusive privilege—in reality the power to levy a tax\r\nfor his own purposes upon all the users of such thread. From a similar\r\nsource comes a large part of the profits which are commonly confounded\r\nwith the earnings of capital. Receipts from the patents granted for\r\na limited term of years for the purpose of encouraging invention\r\nare clearly attributable to this source, as are the returns derived\r\nfrom monopolies created by protective tariffs under the pretense of\r\nencouraging home industry. But there is another far more insidious\r\nand far more general form of monopoly. In the aggregation of large\r\nmasses of capital under a common control there is developed a new and\r\nessentially different power from that power of increase which is a\r\ngeneral characteristic of capital and which gives rise to interest.\r\nWhile the latter is, so to speak, constructive in its nature, the power\r\nwhich, as aggregation proceeds, rises upon it is destructive. It is\r\na power of the same kind as that which James granted to Buckingham,\r\nand it is often exercised with as reckless a disregard, not only of\r\nthe industrial, but of the personal rights of individuals. A railroad\r\ncompany approaches a small town as a highwayman approaches his victim.\r\nThe threat, “If you do not accede to our terms we will leave your\r\ntown two or three miles to one side!” is as efficacious as the “Stand\r\nand deliver,” when backed by a cocked pistol. For the threat of the\r\nrailroad company is not merely to deprive the town of the benefits\r\nwhich the railroad might give; it is to put it in a far worse position\r\nthan if no railroad had been built. Or if, where there is water\r\ncommunication, an opposition boat is put on; rates are reduced until\r\nshe is forced off, and then the public are compelled to pay the cost of\r\nthe operation, just as the Rohillas were obliged to pay the forty lacs\r\nwith which Surajah Dowlah hired of Warren Hastings an English force to\r\nassist him in desolating their country and decimating their people.\r\nAnd just as robbers unite to plunder in concert and divide the spoil,\r\nso do the trunk lines of railroad unite to raise rates and pool their\r\nearnings, or the Pacific roads form a combination with the Pacific Mail\r\nSteamship Company by which toll gates are virtually established on\r\nland and ocean. And just as Buckingham’s creatures, under authority of\r\nthe gold thread patent, searched private houses, and seized papers and\r\npersons for purposes of lust and extortion, so does the great telegraph\r\ncompany which, by the power of associated capital deprives the people\r\nof the United States of the full benefits of a beneficent invention,\r\ntamper with correspondence and crush out newspapers which offend it.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary only to allude to these things, not to dwell on them.\r\nEvery one knows the tyranny and rapacity with which capital when\r\nconcentrated in large amounts is frequently wielded to corrupt, to\r\nrob, and to destroy. What I wish to call the reader’s attention to is\r\nthat profits thus derived are not to be confounded with the legitimate\r\nreturns of capital as an agent of production. They are for the most\r\npart to be attributed to a maladjustment of forces in the legislative\r\ndepartment of government, and to a blind adherence to ancient\r\nbarbarisms and the superstitious reverence for the technicalities of a\r\nnarrow profession in the administration of law; while the general cause\r\nwhich in advancing communities tends, with the concentration of wealth,\r\nto the concentration of power, is the solution of the great problem we\r\nare seeking for, but have not yet found.\r\n\r\nAny analysis will show that much of the profits which are, in common\r\nthought, confounded with interest are in reality due, not to the\r\npower of capital, but to the power of concentrated capital, or of\r\nconcentrated capital acting upon bad social adjustments. And it will\r\nalso show that what are clearly and properly wages of superintendence\r\nare very frequently confounded with the earnings of capital.\r\n\r\nAnd, so, profits properly due to the elements of risk are frequently\r\nconfounded with interest. Some people acquire wealth by taking chances\r\nwhich to the majority of people must necessarily bring loss. Such are\r\nmany forms of speculation, and especially that mode of gambling known\r\nas stock dealing. Nerve, judgment, the possession of capital, skill in\r\nwhat in lower forms of gambling are known as the arts of the confidence\r\nman and blackleg, give advantage to the individual; but, just as at a\r\ngaming table, whatever one gains some one else must lose.\r\n\r\nNow, taking the great fortunes that are so often referred to as\r\nexemplifying the accumulative power of capital—the Dukes of Westminster\r\nand Marquises of Bute, the Rothschilds, Astors, Stewarts, Vanderbilts,\r\nGoulds, Stanfords, and Floods—it is upon examination readily seen that\r\nthey have been built up, in greater or less part, not by interest, but\r\nby elements such as we have been reviewing.\r\n\r\nHow necessary it is to note the distinctions to which I have been\r\ncalling attention is shown in current discussions, where the shield\r\nseems alternately white or black as the standpoint is shifted from\r\none side to the other. On the one hand we are called upon to see, in\r\nthe existence of deep poverty side by side with vast accumulations of\r\nwealth, the aggressions of capital on labor, and in reply it is pointed\r\nout that capital aids labor, and hence we are asked to conclude that\r\nthere is nothing unjust or unnatural in the wide gulf between rich and\r\npoor; that wealth is but the reward of industry, intelligence, and\r\nthrift; and poverty but the punishment of indolence, ignorance, and\r\nimprudence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF INTEREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the law of interest, keeping in mind two things to\r\nwhich attention has heretofore been called—viz:\r\n\r\n_First_—That it is not capital which employs labor, but labor which\r\nemploys capital.\r\n\r\n_Second_—That capital is not a fixed quantity, but can always be\r\nincreased or decreased, (1) by the greater or less application of labor\r\nto the production of capital, and (2) by the conversion of wealth into\r\ncapital, or capital into wealth, for capital being but wealth applied\r\nin a certain way, wealth is the larger and inclusive term.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that under conditions of freedom the maximum that can be\r\ngiven for the use of capital will be the increase it will bring, and\r\nthe minimum or zero will be the replacement of capital; for above the\r\none point the borrowing of capital would involve a loss, and below the\r\nother, capital could not be maintained.\r\n\r\nObserve, again: It is not, as is carelessly stated by some writers, the\r\nincreased efficiency given to labor by the adaptation of capital to any\r\nspecial form or use which fixes this maximum, but the average power\r\nof increase which belongs to capital generally. The power of applying\r\nitself in advantageous forms is a power of labor, which capital as\r\ncapital cannot claim nor share. A bow and arrows will enable an Indian\r\nto kill, let us say, a buffalo every day, while with sticks and stones\r\nhe could hardly kill one in a week; but the weapon maker of the tribe\r\ncould not claim from the hunter six out of every seven buffaloes\r\nkilled as a return for the use of a bow and arrows; nor will capital\r\ninvested in a woolen factory yield to the capitalist the difference\r\nbetween the produce of the factory and what the same amount of labor\r\ncould have obtained with the spinning-wheel and hand-loom. William when\r\nhe borrows a plane from James does not in that obtain the advantage of\r\nthe increased efficiency of labor when using a plane for the smoothing\r\nof boards over what it has when smoothing them with a shell or flint.\r\nThe progress of knowledge has made the advantage involved in the use of\r\nplanes a common property and power of labor. What he gets from James is\r\nmerely such advantage as the element of a year’s time will give to the\r\npossession of so much capital as is represented by the plane.\r\n\r\nNow, if the vital forces of nature which give an advantage to the\r\nelement of time be the cause of interest, it would seem to follow that\r\nthis maximum rate of interest would be determined by the strength of\r\nthese forces and the extent to which they are engaged in production.\r\nBut while the reproductive force of nature seems to vary enormously,\r\nas, for instance, between the salmon, which spawns thousands of eggs,\r\nand the whale, which brings forth a single calf at intervals of years;\r\nbetween the rabbit and the elephant, the thistle and the gigantic\r\nredwood, it appears from the way the natural balance is maintained that\r\nthere is an equation between the reproductive and destructive forces of\r\nnature, which in effect brings the principle of increase to a uniform\r\npoint. This natural balance man has within narrow limits the power\r\nto disturb, and by the modification of natural conditions may avail\r\nhimself at will of the varying strength of the reproductive force in\r\nnature. But when he does so, there arises from the wide scope of his\r\ndesires another principle which brings about in the increase of wealth\r\na similar equation and balance to that which is effected in nature\r\nbetween the different forms of life. This equation exhibits itself\r\nthrough values. If, in a country adapted to both, I go to raising\r\nrabbits and you to raising horses, my rabbits may, until the natural\r\nlimit is reached, increase faster than your horses. But my capital will\r\nnot increase faster, for the effect of the varying rates of increase\r\nwill be to lower the value of rabbits as compared with horses, and to\r\nincrease the value of horses as compared with rabbits.\r\n\r\nThough the varying strength of the vital forces of nature is thus\r\nbrought to uniformity, there may be a difference in the different\r\nstages of social development as to the proportionate extent to\r\nwhich, in the aggregate production of wealth, these vital forces are\r\nenlisted. But as to this, there are two remarks to be made. In the\r\nfirst place, although in such a country as England the part taken by\r\nmanufactures in the aggregate wealth production has very much increased\r\nas compared with the part taken by agriculture, yet it is to be\r\nnoticed that to a very great extent this is true only of the political\r\nor geographical division, and not of the industrial community. For\r\nindustrial communities are not limited by political divisions, or\r\nbounded by seas or mountains. They are limited only by the scope of\r\ntheir exchanges, and the proportion which in the industrial economy of\r\nEngland agriculture and stock-raising bear to manufactures is averaged\r\nwith Iowa and Illinois, with Texas and California, with Canada and\r\nIndia, with Queensland and the Baltic—in short, with every country to\r\nwhich the world-wide exchanges of England extend. In the next place,\r\nit is to be remarked that although in the progress of civilization\r\nthe tendency is to the relative increase of manufactures, as compared\r\nwith agriculture, and consequently to a proportionately less reliance\r\nupon the reproductive forces of nature, yet this is accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding extension of exchanges, and hence a greater calling in\r\nof the power of increase which thus arises. So these tendencies, to a\r\ngreat extent, and, probably, so far as we have yet gone, completely,\r\nbalance each other, and preserve the equilibrium which fixes the\r\naverage increase of capital, or the normal rate of interest.\r\n\r\nNow, this normal point of interest, which lies between the necessary\r\nmaximum and the necessary minimum of the return to capital, must,\r\nwherever it rests, be such that all things (such as the feeling of\r\nsecurity, desire for accumulation, etc.) considered, the reward of\r\ncapital and the reward of labor will be equal—that is to say, will give\r\nan equally attractive result for the exertion or sacrifice involved.\r\nIt is impossible, perhaps, to formulate this point, as wages are\r\nhabitually estimated in quantity and interest in a ratio; but if we\r\nsuppose a given quantity of wealth to be the produce of a given amount\r\nof labor, cooperating for a stated time with a certain amount of\r\ncapital, the proportion in which the produce would be divided between\r\nthe labor and the capital would afford a comparison. There must be such\r\na point at, or rather, about, which the rate of interest must tend to\r\nsettle; since, unless such an equilibrium were effected, labor would\r\nnot accept the use of capital, or capital would not be placed at the\r\ndisposal of labor. For labor and capital are but different forms of\r\nthe same thing—human exertion. Capital is produced by labor; it is,\r\nin fact, but labor impressed upon matter—labor stored up in matter,\r\nto be released again as needed, as the heat of the sun stored up in\r\ncoal is released in the furnace. The use of capital in production\r\nis, therefore, but a mode of labor. As capital can be used only by\r\nbeing consumed, its use is the expenditure of labor, and for the\r\nmaintenance of capital, its production by labor must be commensurate\r\nwith its consumption in aid of labor. Hence the principle that, under\r\ncircumstances which permit free competition, operates to bring wages\r\nto a common standard and profits to a substantial equality—the\r\nprinciple that men will seek to gratify their desires with the least\r\nexertion—operates to establish and maintain this equilibrium between\r\nwages and interest.\r\n\r\nThis natural relation between interest and wages—this equilibrium at\r\nwhich both will represent equal returns to equal exertions—may be\r\nstated in a form which suggests a relation of opposition; but this\r\nopposition is only apparent. In a partnership between Dick and Harry,\r\nthe statement that Dick receives a certain proportion of the profits\r\nimplies that the portion of Harry is less or greater as Dick’s is\r\ngreater or less; but where, as in this case, each gets only what he\r\nadds to the common fund, the increase of the portion of the one does\r\nnot decrease what the other receives.\r\n\r\nAnd this relation fixed, it is evident that interest and wages must\r\nrise and fall together, and that interest cannot be increased without\r\nincreasing wages; nor wages lowered without depressing interest. For if\r\nwages fall, interest must also fall in proportion, else it becomes more\r\nprofitable to turn labor into capital than to apply it directly; while,\r\nif interest falls, wages must likewise proportionately fall, or else\r\nthe increment of capital would be checked.\r\n\r\nWe are, of course, not speaking of particular wages and particular\r\ninterest, but of the general rate of wages and the general rate of\r\ninterest, meaning always by interest the return which capital can\r\nsecure, less insurance and wages of superintendence. In a particular\r\ncase, or a particular employment, the tendency of wages and interest to\r\nan equilibrium may be impeded; but between the general rate of wages\r\nand the general rate of interest, this tendency must be prompt to act.\r\nFor though in a particular branch of production the line may be clearly\r\ndrawn between those who furnish labor and those who furnish capital,\r\nyet even in communities where there is the sharpest distinction\r\nbetween the general class laborers and the general class capitalists,\r\nthese two classes shade off into each other by imperceptible\r\ngradations, and on the extremes where the two classes meet in the same\r\npersons, the interaction which restores equilibrium, or rather prevents\r\nits disturbance, can go on without obstruction, whatever obstacles may\r\nexist where the separation is complete. And, furthermore, it must be\r\nremembered, as has before been stated, that capital is but a portion\r\nof wealth, distinguished from wealth generally only by the purpose to\r\nwhich it is applied, and, hence, the whole body of wealth has upon\r\nthe relations of capital and labor the same equalizing effect that a\r\nfly-wheel has upon the motion of machinery, taking up capital when\r\nit is in excess and giving it out again when there is a deficiency,\r\njust as a jeweler may give his wife diamonds to wear when he has a\r\nsuperabundant stock, and put them in his showcase again when his stock\r\nbecomes reduced. Thus any tendency on the part of interest to rise\r\nabove the equilibrium with wages must immediately beget not only a\r\ntendency to direct labor to the production of capital, but also the\r\napplication of wealth to the uses of capital; while any tendency of\r\nwages to rise above the equilibrium with interest must in like manner\r\nbeget not only a tendency to turn labor from the production of capital,\r\nbut also to lessen the proportion of capital by diverting from a\r\nproductive to a non-productive use some of the articles of wealth of\r\nwhich capital is composed.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: There is a certain relation or ratio between wages and\r\ninterest, fixed by causes, which, if not absolutely permanent, slowly\r\nchange, at which enough labor will be turned into capital to supply the\r\ncapital which, in the degree of knowledge, state of the arts, density\r\nof population, character of occupations, variety, extent and rapidity\r\nof exchanges, will be demanded for production, and this relation or\r\nratio the interaction of labor and capital constantly maintains; hence\r\ninterest must rise and fall with the rise and fall of wages.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: The price of flour is determined by the price of wheat\r\nand cost of milling. The cost of milling varies slowly and but little,\r\nthe difference being, even at long intervals, hardly perceptible; while\r\nthe price of wheat varies frequently and largely. Hence we correctly\r\nsay that the price of flour is governed by the price of wheat. Or,\r\nto put the proposition in the same form as the preceding: There is a\r\ncertain relation or ratio between the value of wheat and the value\r\nof flour, fixed by the cost of milling, which relation or ratio the\r\ninteraction between the demand for flour and the supply of wheat\r\nconstantly maintains; hence the price of flour must rise and fall with\r\nthe rise and fall of the price of wheat.\r\n\r\nOr, as, leaving the connecting link, the price of wheat, to inference,\r\nwe say that the price of flour depends upon the character of the\r\nseasons, wars, etc., so may we put the law of interest in a form which\r\ndirectly connects it with the law of rent, by saying that the general\r\nrate of interest will be determined by the return to capital upon the\r\npoorest land to which capital is freely applied—that is to say, upon\r\nthe best land open to it without the payment of rent. Thus we bring the\r\nlaw of interest into a form which shows it to be a corollary of the law\r\nof rent.\r\n\r\nWe may prove this conclusion in another way: For that interest must\r\ndecrease as rent increases, we can plainly see if we eliminate wages.\r\nTo do this, we must, to be sure, imagine a universe organized on\r\ntotally different principles. Nevertheless, we may imagine what Carlyle\r\nwould call a fool’s paradise, where the production of wealth went on\r\nwithout the aid of labor, and solely by the reproductive force of\r\ncapital—where sheep bore ready-made clothing on their backs, cows\r\npresented butter and cheese, and oxen, when they got to the proper\r\npoint of fatness, carved themselves into beefsteaks and roasting\r\nribs; where houses grew from the seed, and a jackknife thrown upon\r\nthe ground would take root and in due time bear a crop of assorted\r\ncutlery. Imagine certain capitalists transported, with their capital in\r\nappropriate forms, to such a place. Manifestly, they would get, as the\r\nreturn for their capital, the whole amount of wealth it produced only\r\nso long as none of its produce was demanded as rent. When rent arose,\r\nit would come out of the produce of capital, and as it increased,\r\nthe return to the owners of capital must necessarily diminish. If we\r\nimagine the place where capital possessed this power of producing\r\nwealth without the aid of labor to be of limited extent, say an island,\r\nwe shall see that as soon as capital had increased to the limit of the\r\nisland to support it, the return to capital must fall to a trifle above\r\nits minimum of mere replacement, and the land owners would receive\r\nnearly the whole produce as rent, for the only alternative capitalists\r\nwould have would be to throw their capital into the sea. Or, if we\r\nimagine such an island to be in communication with the rest of the\r\nworld, the return to capital would settle at the rate of return in\r\nother places. Interest there would be neither higher nor lower than\r\nanywhere else. Rent would obtain the whole of the superior advantage,\r\nand the land of such an island would have a great value.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the law of interest is this:\r\n\r\n _The relation between wages and interest is determined by the\r\n average power of increase which attaches to capital from its use in\r\n reproductive modes. As rent arises, interest will fall as wages fall,\r\n or will be determined by the margin of cultivation._\r\n\r\nI have endeavored at this length to trace out and illustrate the law\r\nof interest more in deference to the existing terminology and modes\r\nof thought than from the real necessities of our inquiry, were it\r\nunembarrassed by befogging discussions. In truth, the primary division\r\nof wealth in distribution is dual, not tripartite. Capital is but a\r\nform of labor, and its distinction from labor is in reality but a\r\nsubdivision, just as the division of labor into skilled and unskilled\r\nwould be. In our examination we have reached the same point as would\r\nhave been attained had we simply treated capital as a form of labor,\r\nand sought the law which divides the produce between rent and wages;\r\nthat is to say, between the possessors of the two factors, natural\r\nsubstances and powers, and human exertion—which two factors by their\r\nunion produce all wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWAGES AND THE LAW OF WAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have by inference already obtained the law of wages. But to verify\r\nthe deduction and to strip the subject of all ambiguities, let us seek\r\nthe law from an independent starting point.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no such thing as a common rate of wages, in\r\nthe sense that there is at any given time and place a common rate\r\nof interest. Wages, which include all returns received from labor,\r\nnot only vary with the differing powers of individuals, but, as the\r\norganization of society becomes elaborate, vary largely as between\r\noccupations. Nevertheless, there is a certain general relation between\r\nall wages, so that we express a clear and well-understood idea when\r\nwe say that wages are higher or lower in one time or place than in\r\nanother. In their degrees, wages rise and fall in obedience to a common\r\nlaw. What is this law?\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of human action—the law that is to political\r\neconomy what the law of gravitation is to physics—is that men\r\nseek to gratify their desires with the least exertion. Evidently,\r\nthis principle must bring to an equality, through the competition\r\nit induces, the reward gained by equal exertions under similar\r\ncircumstances. When men work for themselves, this equalization will\r\nbe largely affected by the equation of prices; and between those who\r\nwork for themselves and those who work for others, the same tendency\r\nto equalization will operate. Now, under this principle, what, in\r\nconditions of freedom, will be the terms at which one man can hire\r\nothers to work for him? Evidently, they will be fixed by what the men\r\ncould make if laboring for themselves. The principle which will prevent\r\nhim from having to give anything above this, except what is necessary\r\nto induce the change, will also prevent them from taking less. Did\r\nthey demand more, the competition of others would prevent them from\r\ngetting employment. Did he offer less, none would accept the terms,\r\nas they could obtain greater results by working for themselves. Thus,\r\nalthough the employer wishes to pay as little as possible, and the\r\nemployee to receive as much as possible, wages will be fixed by the\r\nvalue or produce of such labor to the laborers themselves. If wages\r\nare temporarily carried either above or below this line, a tendency to\r\ncarry them back at once arises.\r\n\r\nBut the result, or the earnings of labor, as is readily seen in those\r\nprimary and fundamental occupations in which labor first engages,\r\nand which, even in the most highly developed condition of society,\r\nstill form the base of production, does not depend merely upon the\r\nintensity or quality of the labor itself. Wealth is the product of two\r\nfactors, land and labor, and what a given amount of labor will yield\r\nwill vary with the powers of the natural opportunities to which it is\r\napplied. This being the case, the principle that men seek to gratify\r\ntheir desires with the least exertion will fix wages at the produce\r\nof such labor at the point of highest natural productiveness open to\r\nit. Now, by virtue of the same principle, the highest point of natural\r\nproductiveness open to labor under existing conditions will be the\r\nlowest point at which production continues, for men, impelled by a\r\nsupreme law of the human mind to seek the satisfaction of their desires\r\nwith the least exertion, will not expend labor at a lower point of\r\nproductiveness while a higher is open to them. Thus the wages which\r\nan employer must pay will be measured by the lowest point of natural\r\nproductiveness to which production extends, and wages will rise or fall\r\nas this point rises or falls.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: In a simple state of society, each man, as is the\r\nprimitive mode, works for himself—some in hunting, let us say, some in\r\nfishing, some in cultivating the ground. Cultivation, we will suppose,\r\nhas just begun, and the land in use is all of the same quality,\r\nyielding a similar return to similar exertions. Wages, therefore—for,\r\nthough there is neither employer nor employed, there are yet wages—will\r\nbe the full produce of labor, and, making allowance for the difference\r\nof agreeableness, risk, etc., in the three pursuits, they will be on\r\nthe average equal in each—that is to say, equal exertions will yield\r\nequal results. Now, if one of their number wishes to employ some of his\r\nfellows to work for him instead of for themselves, he must pay wages\r\nfixed by this full, average produce of labor.\r\n\r\nLet a period of time elapse. Cultivation has extended, and, instead of\r\nland of the same quality, embraces lands of different qualities. Wages,\r\nnow, will not be as before, the average produce of labor. They will be\r\nthe average produce of labor at the margin of cultivation, or the point\r\nof lowest return. For, as men seek to satisfy their desires with the\r\nleast possible exertion, the point of lowest return in cultivation must\r\nyield to labor a return equivalent to the average return in hunting\r\nand fishing.[37] Labor will no longer yield equal returns to equal\r\nexertions, but those who expend their labor on the superior land will\r\nobtain a greater produce for the same exertion than those who cultivate\r\nthe inferior land. Wages, however, will still be equal, for this excess\r\nwhich the cultivators of the superior land receive is in reality rent,\r\nand if land has been subjected to individual ownership will give it a\r\nvalue. Now, if, under these changed circumstances, one member of this\r\ncommunity wishes to hire others to work for him, he will have to pay\r\nonly what the labor yields at the lowest point of cultivation. If\r\nthereafter the margin of cultivation sinks to points of lower and lower\r\nproductiveness, so must wages sink; if, on the contrary, it rises,\r\nso also must wages rise; for, just as a free body tends to take the\r\nshortest route to the earth’s center, so do men seek the easiest mode\r\nto the gratification of their desires.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the law of wages, as a deduction from a principle\r\nmost obvious and most universal. That wages depend upon the margin of\r\ncultivation—that they will be greater or less as the produce which\r\nlabor can obtain from the highest natural opportunities open to it is\r\ngreater or less, flows from the principle that men will seek to satisfy\r\ntheir wants with the least exertion.\r\n\r\nNow, if we turn from simple social states to the complex phenomena of\r\nhighly civilized societies, we shall find upon examination that they\r\nalso fall under this law.\r\n\r\nIn such societies, wages differ widely, but they still bear a more\r\nor less definite and obvious relation to each other. This relation\r\nis not invariable, as at one time a philosopher of repute may earn\r\nby his lectures many fold the wages of the best mechanic, and at\r\nanother can hardly hope for the pay of a footman; as in a great city\r\noccupations may yield relatively high wages, which in a new settlement\r\nwould yield relatively low wages; yet these variations between wages\r\nmay, under all conditions, and in spite of arbitrary divergences\r\ncaused by custom, law, etc., be traced to certain circumstances. In\r\none of his most interesting chapters Adam Smith thus enumerates the\r\nprincipal circumstances “which make up for a small pecuniary gain\r\nin some employments and counterbalance a great one in others: First,\r\nthe agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves.\r\nSecondly, the easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of\r\nlearning them. Thirdly, the constancy or inconstancy of employment in\r\nthem. Fourthly, the small or great trust which must be reposed in them.\r\nFifthly, the probability or improbability of success in them.”[38] It\r\nis not necessary to dwell in detail on these causes of variation in\r\nwages between different employments. They have been admirably explained\r\nand illustrated by Adam Smith and the economists who have followed\r\nhim, who have well worked out the details, even if they have failed to\r\napprehend the main law.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all the circumstances which give rise to the differences\r\nbetween wages in different occupations may be included as supply and\r\ndemand, and it is perfectly correct to say that the wages in different\r\noccupations will vary relatively according to differences in the supply\r\nand demand of labor—meaning by demand the call which the community\r\nas a whole makes for services of the particular kind, and by supply\r\nthe relative amount of labor which, under the existing conditions,\r\ncan be determined to the performance of those particular services.\r\nBut though this is true as to the relative differences of wages, when\r\nit is said, as is commonly said, that the general rate of wages is\r\ndetermined by supply and demand, the words are meaningless. For supply\r\nand demand are but relative terms. The supply of labor can only mean\r\nlabor offered in exchange for labor or the produce of labor, and the\r\ndemand for labor can only mean labor or the produce of labor offered\r\nin exchange for labor. Supply is thus demand, and demand supply, and,\r\nin the whole community, one must be co-extensive with the other. This\r\nis clearly apprehended by the current political economy in relation to\r\nsales, and the reasoning of Ricardo, Mill, and others, which proves\r\nthat alterations in supply and demand cannot produce a general rise\r\nor fall of values, though they may cause a rise or fall in the value\r\nof a particular thing, is as applicable to labor. What conceals the\r\nabsurdity of speaking generally of supply and demand in reference to\r\nlabor is the habit of considering the demand for labor as springing\r\nfrom capital and as something distinct from labor; but the analysis to\r\nwhich this idea has been heretofore subjected has sufficiently shown\r\nits fallacy. It is indeed evident from the mere statement, that wages\r\ncan never permanently exceed the produce of labor, and hence that there\r\nis no fund from which wages can for any time be drawn, save that which\r\nlabor constantly creates.\r\n\r\nBut, though all the circumstances which produce the differences in\r\nwages between occupations may be considered as operating through\r\nsupply and demand, they, or rather, their effects, for sometimes the\r\nsame cause operates in both ways, may be separated into two classes,\r\naccording as they tend only to raise apparent wages or as they tend\r\nto raise real wages—that is, to increase the average reward for equal\r\nexertion. The high wages of some occupations much resemble what Adam\r\nSmith compares them to, the prizes of a lottery, in which the great\r\ngain of one is made up from the losses of many others. This is not\r\nonly true of the professions by means of which Dr. Smith illustrates\r\nthe principle, but is largely true of the wages of superintendence\r\nin mercantile pursuits, as shown by the fact that over ninety per\r\ncent. of the mercantile firms that commence business ultimately\r\nfail. The higher wages of those occupations which can be prosecuted\r\nonly in certain states of the weather, or are otherwise intermittent\r\nand uncertain, are also of this class; while differences that arise\r\nfrom hardship, discredit, unhealthiness, etc., imply differences of\r\nsacrifice, the increased compensation for which only preserves the\r\nlevel of equal returns for equal exertions. All these differences are,\r\nin fact, equalizations, arising from circumstances which, to use\r\nthe words of Adam Smith, “make up for a small pecuniary gain in some\r\nemployments and counterbalance a great one in others.” But, besides\r\nthese merely apparent differences, there are real differences in wages\r\nbetween occupations, which are caused by the greater or less rarity\r\nof the qualities required—greater abilities or skill, whether natural\r\nor acquired, commanding on the average greater wages. Now, these\r\nqualities, whether natural or acquired, are essentially analogous to\r\ndifferences in strength and quickness in manual labor, and as in manual\r\nlabor the higher wages paid the man who can do more would be based upon\r\nwages paid to those who can do only the average amount, so wages in the\r\noccupations requiring superior abilities and skill must depend upon the\r\ncommon wages paid for ordinary abilities and skill.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, evident from observation, as it must be from theory,\r\nthat whatever be the circumstances which produce the differences of\r\nwages in different occupations, and although they frequently vary in\r\nrelation to each other, producing, as between time and time, and place\r\nand place, greater or less relative differences, yet the rate of wages\r\nin one occupation is always dependent on the rate in another, and so\r\non, down, until the lowest and widest stratum of wages is reached, in\r\noccupations where the demand is more nearly uniform and in which there\r\nis the greatest freedom to engage.\r\n\r\nFor, although barriers of greater or less difficulty may exist, the\r\namount of labor which can be determined to any particular pursuit is\r\nnowhere absolutely fixed. All mechanics could act as laborers, and many\r\nlaborers could readily become mechanics; all storekeepers could act\r\nas shopmen, and many shopmen could easily become storekeepers; many\r\nfarmers would, upon inducement, become hunters or miners, fishermen or\r\nsailors, and many hunters, miners, fishermen, and sailors know enough\r\nof farming to turn their hands to it on demand. In each occupation\r\nthere are men who unite it with others, or who alternate between\r\noccupations, while the young men who are constantly coming in to fill\r\nup the ranks of labor are drawn in the direction of the strongest\r\ninducements and least resistances. And further than this, all the\r\ngradations of wages shade into each other by imperceptible degrees,\r\ninstead of being separated by clearly defined gulfs. The wages, even\r\nof the poorer paid mechanics, are generally higher than the wages\r\nof simple laborers, but there are always some mechanics who do not,\r\non the whole, make as much as some laborers; the best paid lawyers\r\nreceive much higher wages than the best paid clerks, but the best paid\r\nclerks make more than some lawyers, and in fact the worst paid clerks\r\nmake more than the worst paid lawyers. Thus, on the verge of each\r\noccupation, stand those to whom the inducements between one occupation\r\nand another are so nicely balanced that the slightest change is\r\nsufficient to determine their labor in one direction or another. Thus,\r\nany increase or decrease in the demand for labor of a certain kind\r\ncannot, except temporarily, raise wages in that occupation above, nor\r\ndepress them below, the relative level with wages in other occupations,\r\nwhich is determined by the circumstances previously adverted to,\r\nsuch as relative agreeableness or continuity of employment, etc.\r\nEven, as experience shows, where artificial barriers are imposed\r\nto this interaction, such as limiting laws, guild regulations, the\r\nestablishment of caste, etc., they may interfere with, but cannot\r\nprevent, the maintenance of this equilibrium. They operate only as\r\ndams, which pile up the water of a stream above its natural level, but\r\ncannot prevent its overflow.\r\n\r\nThus, although they may from time to time alter in relation to each\r\nother, as the circumstances which determine relative levels change, yet\r\nit is evident that wages in all strata must ultimately depend upon\r\nwages in the lowest and widest stratum—the general rate of wages rising\r\nor falling as these rise or fall.\r\n\r\nNow, the primary and fundamental occupations, upon which, so to\r\nspeak, all others are built up, are evidently those which procure\r\nwealth directly from nature; hence the law of wages in them must be\r\nthe general law of wages. And, as wages in such occupations clearly\r\ndepend upon what labor can produce at the lowest point of natural\r\nproductiveness to which it is habitually applied; therefore, wages\r\ngenerally depend upon the margin of cultivation, or, to put it more\r\nexactly, upon the highest point of natural productiveness to which\r\nlabor is free to apply itself without the payment of rent.\r\n\r\nSo obvious is this law that it is often apprehended without being\r\nrecognized. It is frequently said of such countries as California and\r\nNevada that cheap labor would enormously aid their development, as it\r\nwould enable the working of the poorer but most extensive deposits of\r\nore. A relation between low wages and a low point of production is\r\nperceived by those who talk in this way, but they invert cause and\r\neffect. It is not low wages which will cause the working of low-grade\r\nore, but the extension of production to the lower point which will\r\ndiminish wages. If wages could be arbitrarily forced down, as has\r\nsometimes been attempted by statute, the poorer mines would not be\r\nworked so long as richer mines could be worked. But if the margin of\r\nproduction were arbitrarily forced down, as it might be, were the\r\nsuperior natural opportunities in the ownership of those who chose\r\nrather to wait for future increase of value than to permit them to be\r\nused now, wages would necessarily fall.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration is complete. The law of wages we have thus obtained\r\nis that which we previously obtained as the corollary of the law of\r\nrent, and it completely harmonizes with the law of interest. It is,\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n _Wages depend upon the margin of production, or upon the produce which\r\n labor can obtain at the highest point of natural productiveness open\r\n to it without the payment of rent._\r\n\r\nThis law of wages accords with and explains universal facts that\r\nwithout its apprehension seem unrelated and contradictory. It shows\r\nthat:\r\n\r\nWhere land is free and labor is unassisted by capital, the whole\r\nproduce will go to labor as wages.\r\n\r\nWhere land is free and labor is assisted by capital, wages will consist\r\nof the whole produce, less that part necessary to induce the storing up\r\nof labor as capital.\r\n\r\nWhere land is subject to ownership and rent arises, wages will be fixed\r\nby what labor could secure from the highest natural opportunities open\r\nto it without the payment of rent.\r\n\r\nWhere natural opportunities are all monopolized, wages may be forced by\r\nthe competition among laborers to the minimum at which laborers will\r\nconsent to reproduce.\r\n\r\nThis necessary minimum of wages (which by Smith and Ricardo is\r\ndenominated the point of “natural wages,” and by Mill supposed to\r\nregulate wages, which will be higher or lower as the working classes\r\nconsent to reproduce at a higher or lower standard of comfort) is,\r\nhowever, included in the law of wages as previously stated, as it is\r\nevident that the margin of production cannot fall below that point at\r\nwhich enough will be left as wages to secure the maintenance of labor.\r\n\r\nLike Ricardo’s law of rent of which it is the corollary, this law of\r\nwages carries with it its own proof and becomes self-evident by mere\r\nstatement. For it is but an application of the central truth that is\r\nthe foundation of economic reasoning—that men will seek to satisfy\r\ntheir desires with the least exertion. The average man will not work\r\nfor an employer for less, all things considered, than he can earn by\r\nworking for himself; nor yet will he work for himself for less than he\r\ncan earn by working for an employer, and hence the return which labor\r\ncan secure from such natural opportunities as are free to it must fix\r\nthe wages which labor everywhere gets. That is to say, the line of rent\r\nis the necessary measure of the line of wages. In fact, the accepted\r\nlaw of rent depends for its recognition upon a previous, though in many\r\ncases it seems to be an unconscious, acceptance of this law of wages.\r\nWhat makes it evident that land of a particular quality will yield as\r\nrent the surplus of its produce over that of the least productive land\r\nin use, is the apprehension of the fact that the owner of the higher\r\nquality of land can procure the labor to work his land by the payment\r\nof what that labor could produce if exerted upon land of the poorer\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nIn its simpler manifestations, this law of wages is recognized by\r\npeople who do not trouble themselves about political economy, just\r\nas the fact that a heavy body would fall to the earth was long\r\nrecognized by those who never thought of the law of gravitation. It\r\ndoes not require a philosopher to see that if in any country natural\r\nopportunities were thrown open which would enable laborers to make\r\nfor themselves wages higher than the lowest now paid, the general\r\nrate of wages would rise; while the most ignorant and stupid of the\r\nplacer miners of early California knew that as the placers gave out or\r\nwere monopolized, wages must fall. It requires no fine-spun theory to\r\nexplain why wages are so high relatively to production in new countries\r\nwhere land is yet unmonopolized. The cause is on the surface. One man\r\nwill not work for another for less than his labor will really yield,\r\nwhen he can go upon the next quarter section and take up a farm for\r\nhimself. It is only as land becomes monopolized and these natural\r\nopportunities are shut off from labor, that laborers are obliged to\r\ncompete with each other for employment, and it becomes possible for the\r\nfarmer to hire hands to do his work while he maintains himself on the\r\ndifference between what their labor produces and what he pays them for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith himself saw the cause of high wages where land was yet\r\nopen to settlement, though he failed to appreciate the importance and\r\nconnection of the fact. In treating of the Causes of the Prosperity of\r\nNew Colonies (Chapter VII, Book IV, “Wealth of Nations,”) he says:\r\n\r\n “Every colonist gets more land than he can possibly cultivate. He has\r\n no rent and scarce any taxes to pay. * * He is eager, therefore, to\r\n collect laborers from every quarter and to pay them the most liberal\r\n wages. But these liberal wages, joined to the plenty and cheapness of\r\n land, soon make these laborers leave him in order to become landlords\r\n themselves, and to reward with equal liberality other laborers who\r\n soon leave them for the same reason they left their first masters.”\r\n\r\nThis chapter contains numerous expressions which, like the opening\r\nsentence in the chapter on The Wages of Labor, show that Adam Smith\r\nfailed to appreciate the true laws of the distribution of wealth only\r\nbecause he turned away from the more primitive forms of society to\r\nlook for first principles amid complex social manifestations, where he\r\nwas blinded by a preaccepted theory of the functions of capital, and,\r\nas it seems to me, by a vague acceptance of the doctrine which, two\r\nyears after his death, was formulated by Malthus. And it is impossible\r\nto read the works of the economists who since the time of Smith have\r\nendeavored to build up and elucidate the science of political economy\r\nwithout seeing how, over and over again, they stumble over the law of\r\nwages without once recognizing it. Yet, “if it were a dog it would bite\r\nthem!” Indeed, it is difficult to resist the impression that some\r\nof them really saw this law of wages, but, fearful of the practical\r\nconclusions to which it would lead, preferred to ignore and cover it\r\nup, rather than use it as the key to problems which without it are so\r\nperplexing. A great truth to an age which has rejected and trampled on\r\nit, is not a word of peace, but a sword!\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be well to remind the reader, before closing this\r\nchapter, of what has been before stated—that I am using the word wages\r\nnot in the sense of a quantity, but in the sense of a proportion. When\r\nI say that wages fall as rent rises, I do not mean that the quantity\r\nof wealth obtained by laborers as wages is necessarily less, but that\r\nthe proportion which it bears to the whole produce is necessarily\r\nless. The proportion may diminish while the quantity remains the same\r\nor even increases. If the margin of cultivation descends from the\r\nproductive point which we will call 25, to the productive point we will\r\ncall 20, the rent of all lands that before paid rent will increase by\r\nthis difference, and the proportion of the whole produce which goes\r\nto laborers as wages will to the same extent diminish; but if, in the\r\nmeantime, the advance of the arts or the economies that become possible\r\nwith greater population have so increased the productive power of labor\r\nthat at 20 the same exertion will produce as much wealth as before at\r\n25, laborers will get as wages as great a quantity as before, and the\r\nrelative fall of wages will not be noticeable in any diminution of the\r\nnecessaries or comforts of the laborer, but only in the increased value\r\nof land and the greater incomes and more lavish expenditure of the\r\nrent-receiving class.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] This equalization will be effected by the equation of prices.\r\n\r\n[38] This last, which is analogous to the element of risk in profits,\r\naccounts for the high wages of successful lawyers, physicians,\r\ncontractors, actors, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE CORRELATION AND CO-ORDINATION OF THESE LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusions we have reached as to the laws which govern the\r\ndistribution of wealth recast a large and most important part of the\r\nscience of political economy, as at present taught, overthrowing some\r\nof its most highly elaborated theories and shedding a new light on\r\nsome of its most important problems. Yet, in doing this, no disputable\r\nground has been occupied; not a single fundamental principle advanced\r\nthat is not already recognized.\r\n\r\nThe law of interest and the law of wages which we have substituted\r\nfor those now taught are necessary deductions from the great law\r\nwhich alone makes any science of political economy possible—the\r\nall-compelling law that is as inseparable from the human mind as\r\nattraction is inseparable from matter, and without which it would be\r\nimpossible to previse or calculate upon any human action, the most\r\ntrivial or the most important. This fundamental law, that men seek to\r\ngratify their desires with the least exertion, becomes, when viewed in\r\nits relation to one of the factors of production, the law of rent; in\r\nrelation to another, the law of interest; and in relation to a third,\r\nthe law of wages. And in accepting the law of rent, which, since the\r\ntime of Ricardo, has been accepted by every economist of standing, and\r\nwhich, like a geometrical axiom, has but to be understood to compel\r\nassent, the law of interest and law of wages, as I have stated them,\r\nare inferentially accepted, as its necessary sequences. In fact,\r\nit is only relatively that they can be called sequences, as in the\r\nrecognition of the law of rent they too must be recognized. For on\r\nwhat depends the recognition of the law of rent? Evidently upon the\r\nrecognition of the fact that the effect of competition is to prevent\r\nthe return to labor and capital being anywhere greater than upon the\r\npoorest land in use. It is in seeing this that we see that the owner\r\nof land will be able to claim as rent all of its produce which exceeds\r\nwhat would be yielded to an equal application of labor and capital on\r\nthe poorest land in use.\r\n\r\nThe harmony and correlation of the laws of distribution as we have now\r\napprehended them are in striking contrast with the want of harmony\r\nwhich characterizes these laws as presented by the current political\r\neconomy. Let us state them side by side:\r\n\r\n   _The Current Statement._            _The True Statement._\r\n\r\n  RENT depends on the margin         RENT depends on the margin\r\n    of cultivation, rising as it      of cultivation, rising as it\r\n    falls and falling as it rises.    falls and falling as it rises.\r\n\r\n  WAGES depend upon the              WAGES depend on the margin\r\n    ratio between the number          of cultivation, falling\r\n    of laborers and the amount        as it falls and rising as it\r\n    of capital devoted to their       rises.\r\n    employment.\r\n\r\n  INTEREST depends upon the          INTEREST (its ratio with wages\r\n    equation between the supply       being fixed by the net\r\n    of and demand for                 power of increase which\r\n    capital; or, as is stated of      attaches to capital) depends\r\n    profits, upon wages (or           on the margin of\r\n    the cost of labor), rising        cultivation, falling as it\r\n    as wages fall, and falling        falls and rising as it rises.\r\n    as wages rise.\r\n\r\nIn the current statement the laws of distribution have no common\r\ncenter, no mutual relation; they are not the correlating divisions of\r\na whole, but measures of different qualities. In the statement we have\r\ngiven, they spring from one point, support and supplement each other,\r\nand form the correlating divisions of a complete whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STATICS OF THE PROBLEM THUS EXPLAINED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now obtained a clear, simple, and consistent theory of the\r\ndistribution of wealth, which accords with first principles and\r\nexisting facts, and which, when understood, will commend itself as\r\nself-evident.\r\n\r\nBefore working out this theory, I have deemed it necessary to show\r\nconclusively the insufficiency of current theories; for, in thought,\r\nas in action, the majority of men do but follow their leaders, and a\r\ntheory of wages which has not merely the support of the highest names,\r\nbut is firmly rooted in common opinions and prejudices, will, until it\r\nhas been proved untenable, prevent any other theory from being even\r\nconsidered, just as the theory that the earth was the center of the\r\nuniverse prevented any consideration of the theory that it revolves on\r\nits own axis and circles round the sun, until it was clearly shown that\r\nthe apparent movements of the heavenly bodies could not be explained in\r\naccordance with the theory of the fixity of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is in truth a marked resemblance between the science of political\r\neconomy, as at present taught, and the science of astronomy, as taught\r\nprevious to the recognition of the Copernican theory. The devices by\r\nwhich the current political economy endeavors to explain the social\r\nphenomena that are now forcing themselves upon the attention of the\r\ncivilized world may well be compared to the elaborate system of cycles\r\nand epicycles constructed by the learned to explain the celestial\r\nphenomena in a manner according with the dogmas of authority and the\r\nrude impressions and prejudices of the unlearned. And, just as the\r\nobservations which showed that this theory of cycles and epicycles\r\ncould not explain all the phenomena of the heavens cleared the way for\r\nthe consideration of the simpler theory that supplanted it, so will a\r\nrecognition of the inadequacy of the current theories to account for\r\nsocial phenomena clear the way for the consideration of a theory that\r\nwill give to political economy all the simplicity and harmony which the\r\nCopernican theory gave to the science of astronomy.\r\n\r\nBut at this point the parallel ceases. That “the fixed and steadfast\r\nearth” should be really whirling through space with inconceivable\r\nvelocity is repugnant to the first apprehensions of men in every\r\nstate and situation; but the truth I wish to make clear is naturally\r\nperceived, and has been recognized in the infancy of every people,\r\nbeing obscured only by the complexities of the civilized state, the\r\nwarpings of selfish interests, and the false direction which the\r\nspeculations of the learned have taken. To recognize it, we have but to\r\ncome back to first principles and heed simple perceptions. Nothing can\r\nbe clearer than the proposition that the failure of wages to increase\r\nwith increasing productive power is due to the increase of rent.\r\n\r\nThree things unite to production—labor, capital, and land.\r\n\r\nThree parties divide the produce—the laborer, the capitalist, and the\r\nland owner.\r\n\r\nIf, with an increase of production the laborer gets no more and the\r\ncapitalist no more it is a necessary inference that the land owner\r\nreaps the whole gain.\r\n\r\nAnd the facts agree with the inference. Though neither wages nor\r\ninterest anywhere increase as material progress goes on, yet the\r\ninvariable accompaniment and mark of material progress is the increase\r\nof rent—the rise of land values.\r\n\r\nThe increase of rent explains why wages and interest do not increase.\r\nThe cause which gives to the land holder is the cause which denies to\r\nthe laborer and capitalist. That wages and interest are higher in new\r\nthan in old countries is not, as the standard economists say, because\r\nnature makes a greater return to the application of labor and capital,\r\nbut because land is cheaper, and, therefore, as a smaller proportion\r\nof the return is taken by rent, labor and capital can keep for their\r\nshare a larger proportion of what nature does return. It is not the\r\ntotal produce, but the net produce, after rent has been taken from it,\r\nthat determines what can be divided as wages and interest. Hence, the\r\nrate of wages and interest is everywhere fixed, not so much by the\r\nproductiveness of labor as by the value of land. Wherever the value\r\nof land is relatively low, wages and interest are relatively high;\r\nwherever land is relatively high, wages and interest are relatively low.\r\n\r\nIf production had not passed the simple stage in which all labor is\r\ndirectly applied to the land and all wages are paid in its produce, the\r\nfact that when the land owner takes a larger portion the laborer must\r\nput up with a smaller portion could not be lost sight of.\r\n\r\nBut the complexities of production in the civilized state, in which so\r\ngreat a part is borne by exchange, and so much labor is bestowed upon\r\nmaterials after they have been separated from the land, though they may\r\nto the unthinking disguise, do not alter the fact that all production\r\nis still the union of the two factors, land and labor, and that rent\r\n(the share of the land holder) cannot be increased except at the\r\nexpense of wages (the share of the laborer) and interest (the share of\r\ncapital). Just as the portion of the crop, which in the simpler forms\r\nof industrial organization the owner of agricultural land receives at\r\nthe end of the harvest as his rent, lessens the amount left to the\r\ncultivator as wages and interest, so does the rental of land on which\r\na manufacturing or commercial city is built lessen the amount which can\r\nbe divided as wages and interest between the laborer and capital there\r\nengaged in the production and exchange of wealth.\r\n\r\nIn short, the value of land depending wholly upon the power which its\r\nownership gives of appropriating wealth created by labor, the increase\r\nof land values is always at the expense of the value of labor. And,\r\nhence, that the increase of productive power does not increase wages,\r\nis because it does increase the value of land. Rent swallows up the\r\nwhole gain and pauperism accompanies progress.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to refer to facts. They will suggest themselves to\r\nthe reader. It is the general fact, observable everywhere, that as\r\nthe value of land increases, so does the contrast between wealth and\r\nwant appear. It is the universal fact, that where the value of land is\r\nhighest, civilization exhibits the greatest luxury side by side with\r\nthe most piteous destitution. To see human beings in the most abject,\r\nthe most helpless and hopeless condition, you must go, not to the\r\nunfenced prairies and the log cabins of new clearings in the backwoods,\r\nwhere man single-handed is commencing the struggle with nature, and\r\nland is yet worth nothing, but to the great cities, where the ownership\r\nof a little patch of ground is a fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF MATERIAL PROGRESS UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.—THE DYNAMICS OF THE PROBLEM YET TO SEEK.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.—EFFECT OF INCREASE OF POPULATION UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF\r\n WEALTH.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.—EFFECT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ARTS UPON THE DISTRIBUTION\r\n OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.—EFFECT OF THE EXPECTATION RAISED BY MATERIAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Hitherto, it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made\r\n have lightened the day’s toil of any human being.—_John Stuart Mill._\r\n\r\n    Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,\r\n        Ere the sorrow comes with years?\r\n    They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,\r\n        And _that_ cannot stop their tears.\r\n    The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;\r\n      The young birds are chirping in the nest;\r\n    The young fawns are playing with the shadows;\r\n      The young flowers are blowing toward the west—\r\n    But the young, young children, O, my brothers,\r\n        They are weeping bitterly!\r\n    They are weeping in the playtime of the others,\r\n        In the country of the free.\r\n\r\n    —_Mrs. Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DYNAMICS OF THE PROBLEM YET TO SEEK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn identifying rent as the receiver of the increased production which\r\nmaterial progress gives, but which labor fails to obtain; in seeing\r\nthat the antagonism of interests is not between labor and capital, as\r\nis popularly believed, but is in reality between labor and capital\r\non the one side and land ownership on the other, we have reached a\r\nconclusion that has most important practical bearings. But it is not\r\nworth while to dwell on them now, for we have not yet fully solved the\r\nproblem which was at the outset proposed. To say that wages remain low\r\nbecause rent advances is like saying that a steamboat moves because\r\nits wheels turn around. The further question is, What causes rent to\r\nadvance? What is the force or necessity that, as productive power\r\nincreases, distributes a greater and greater proportion of the produce\r\nas rent?\r\n\r\nThe only cause pointed out by Ricardo as advancing rent is the increase\r\nof population, which by requiring larger supplies of food necessitates\r\nthe extension of cultivation to inferior lands, or to points of\r\ninferior production on the same lands, and in current works of other\r\nauthors attention is so exclusively directed to the extension of\r\nproduction from superior to inferior lands as the cause of advancing\r\nrents that Mr. Carey (followed by Professor Perry and others) has\r\nimagined that he has overthrown the Ricardian theory of rent by denying\r\nthat the progress of agriculture is from better to worse lands.[39]\r\n\r\nNow, while it is unquestionably true that the increasing pressure of\r\npopulation which compels a resort to inferior points of production\r\nwill raise rents, and does raise rents, I do not think that all the\r\ndeductions commonly made from this principle are valid, nor yet that\r\nit fully accounts for the increase of rent as material progress goes\r\non. There are evidently other causes which conspire to raise rent, but\r\nwhich seem to have been wholly or partially hidden by the erroneous\r\nviews as to the functions of capital and genesis of wages which have\r\nbeen current. To see what these are, and how they operate, let us trace\r\nthe effect of material progress upon the distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe changes which constitute or contribute to material progress are\r\nthree: (1) increase in population; (2) improvements in the arts of\r\nproduction and exchange; and (3) improvements in knowledge, education,\r\ngovernment, police, manners, and morals, so far as they increase the\r\npower of producing wealth. Material progress, as commonly understood,\r\nconsists of these three elements or directions of progression, in\r\nall of which the progressive nations have for some time past been\r\nadvancing, though in different degrees. As, considered in the light\r\nof material forces or economies, the increase of knowledge, the\r\nbetterment of government, etc., have the same effect as improvements\r\nin the arts, it will not be necessary in this view to consider them\r\nseparately. What bearing intellectual or moral progress, merely as\r\nsuch, has upon our problem we may hereafter consider. We are at present\r\ndealing with material progress, to which these things contribute only\r\nas they increase wealth-producing power, and shall see their effects\r\nwhen we see the effect of improvements in the arts.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the effects of material progress upon the distribution\r\nof wealth, let us, therefore, consider the effects of increase of\r\npopulation apart from improvement in the arts, and then the effect of\r\nimprovement in the arts apart from increase of population.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] As to this, it may be worth while to say: (1) That the general\r\nfact, as shown by the progress of agriculture in the newer States of\r\nthe Union and by the character of the land left out of cultivation in\r\nthe older, is that the course of cultivation _is_ from the better to\r\nthe worse qualities of land. (2) That, whether the course of production\r\nbe from the absolutely better to the absolutely worse lands or the\r\nreverse (and there is much to indicate that better or worse in this\r\nconnection merely relates to our knowledge, and that future advances\r\nmay discover compensating qualities in portions of the earth now\r\nesteemed most sterile), it is always, and from the nature of the human\r\nmind, _must_ always tend to be, from land under existing conditions\r\ndeemed better, to land under existing conditions deemed worse. (3)\r\nThat Ricardo’s law of rent does not depend upon the direction of the\r\nextension of cultivation, but upon the proposition that if land of a\r\ncertain quality will yield something, land of a better quality will\r\nyield more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF INCREASE OF POPULATION UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which increasing population advances rent, as explained\r\nand illustrated in current treatises, is that the increased demand\r\nfor subsistence forces production to inferior soil or to inferior\r\nproductive points. Thus, if, with a given population, the margin of\r\ncultivation is at 30, all lands of productive power over 30 will pay\r\nrent. If the population be doubled, an additional supply is required,\r\nwhich cannot be obtained without an extension of cultivation that will\r\ncause lands to yield rent that before yielded none. If the extension\r\nbe to 20, then all the land between 20 and 30 will yield rent and\r\nhave a value, and all land over 30 will yield increased rent and have\r\nincreased value.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the Malthusian doctrine receives from the current\r\nelucidations of the theory of rent the support of which I spoke when\r\nenumerating the causes that have combined to give that doctrine an\r\nalmost undisputed sway in current thought. According to the Malthusian\r\ntheory, the pressure of population against subsistence becomes\r\nprogressively harder as population increases, and although two hands\r\ncome into the world with every new mouth, it becomes, to use the\r\nlanguage of John Stuart Mill, harder and harder for the new hands to\r\nsupply the new mouths. According to Ricardo’s theory of rent, rent\r\narises from the difference in productiveness of the lands in use, and\r\nas explained by Ricardo and the economists who have followed him, the\r\nadvance in rents which, experience shows, accompanies increasing\r\npopulation, is caused by the inability of procuring more food except\r\nat a greater cost, which thus forces the margin of population to lower\r\nand lower points of production, commensurately increasing rent. Thus\r\nthe two theories, as I have before explained, are made to harmonize\r\nand blend, the law of rent becoming but a special application of the\r\nmore general law propounded by Malthus, and the advance of rents with\r\nincreasing population a demonstration of its resistless operation. I\r\nrefer to this incidentally, because it now lies in our way to see the\r\nmisapprehension which has enlisted the doctrine of rent in the support\r\nof a theory to which it in reality gives no countenance. The Malthusian\r\ntheory has been already disposed of, and the cumulative disproof which\r\nwill prevent the recurrence of a lingering doubt will be given when it\r\nis shown, further on, that the phenomena attributed to the pressure\r\nof population against subsistence would, under existing conditions,\r\nmanifest themselves were population to remain stationary.\r\n\r\nThe misapprehension to which I now refer, and which, to a proper\r\nunderstanding of the effect of increase of population upon the\r\ndistribution of wealth, it is necessary to clear up, is the\r\npresumption, expressed or implied in all the current reasoning upon\r\nthe subject of rent in connection with population, that the recourse\r\nto lower points of production involves a smaller aggregate produce\r\nin proportion to the labor expended; though that this is not always\r\nthe case is clearly recognized in connection with agricultural\r\nimprovements, which, to use the words of Mill, are considered “as\r\na partial relaxation of the bonds which confine the increase of\r\npopulation.” But it is not involved even where there is no advance in\r\nthe arts, and the recourse to lower points of production is clearly\r\nthe result of the increased demand of an increased population. For\r\nincreased population, of itself, and without any advance in the arts,\r\nimplies an increase in the productive power of labor. The labor of 100\r\nmen, other things being equal, will produce much more than one hundred\r\ntimes as much as the labor of one man, and the labor of 1,000 men much\r\nmore than ten times as much as the labor of 100 men; and, so, with\r\nevery additional pair of hands which increasing population brings,\r\nthere is a more than proportionate addition to the productive power of\r\nlabor. Thus, with an increasing population, there may be a recourse to\r\nlower natural powers of production, not only without any diminution in\r\nthe average production of wealth as compared to labor, but without any\r\ndiminution at the lowest point. If population be doubled, land of but\r\n20 productiveness may yield to the same amount of labor as much as land\r\nof 30 productiveness could before yield. For it must not be forgotten\r\n(what often _is_ forgotten) that the productiveness either of land\r\nor labor is not to be measured in any one thing, but in all desired\r\nthings. A settler and his family may raise as much corn on land a\r\nhundred miles away from the nearest habitation as they could raise were\r\ntheir land in the center of a populous district. But in the populous\r\ndistrict they could obtain with the same labor as good a living from\r\nmuch poorer land, or from land of equal quality could make as good\r\na living after paying a high rent, because in the midst of a large\r\npopulation their labor would have become more effective; not, perhaps,\r\nin the production of corn, but in the production of wealth generally—or\r\nthe obtaining of all the commodities and services which are the real\r\nobject of their labor.\r\n\r\nBut even where there is a diminution in the productiveness of labor at\r\nthe lowest point—that is to say, where the increasing demand for wealth\r\nhas driven production to a lower point of natural productiveness than\r\nthe addition to the power of labor from increasing population suffices\r\nto make up for—it does not follow that the aggregate production, as\r\ncompared with the aggregate labor, has been lessened.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose land of diminishing qualities. The best would naturally\r\nbe settled first, and as population increased production would take in\r\nthe next lower quality, and so on. But, as the increase of population,\r\nby permitting greater economies, adds to the effectiveness of labor,\r\nthe cause which brought each quality of land successively into\r\ncultivation would at the same time increase the amount of wealth that\r\nthe same quality of labor could produce from it. But it would also\r\ndo more than this—it would increase the power of producing wealth on\r\nall the superior lands already in cultivation. If the relations of\r\nquantity and quality were such that increasing population added to\r\nthe effectiveness of labor faster than it compelled a resort to less\r\nproductive qualities of land, though the margin of cultivation would\r\nfall and rent would rise, the minimum return to labor would increase.\r\nThat is to say, though wages as a proportion would fall, wages as a\r\nquantity would rise. The average production of wealth would increase.\r\nIf the relations were such that the increasing effectiveness of labor\r\njust compensated for the diminishing productiveness of the land as it\r\nwas called into use, the effect of increasing population would be to\r\nincrease rent by lowering the margin of cultivation without reducing\r\nwages as a quantity, and to increase the average production. If we now\r\nsuppose population still increasing, but, between the poorest quality\r\nof land in use and the next lower quality, to be a difference so great\r\nthat the increased power of labor which comes with the increased\r\npopulation that brings it into cultivation cannot compensate for\r\nit—the minimum return to labor will be reduced, and with the rise of\r\nrents, wages will fall, not only as a proportion, but as a quantity.\r\nBut unless the descent in the quality of land is far more precipitous\r\nthan we can well imagine, or than, I think, ever exists, the average\r\nproduction will still be increased, for the increased effectiveness\r\nwhich comes by reason of the increased population that compels resort\r\nto the inferior quality of land attaches to all labor, and the gain\r\non the superior qualities of land will more than compensate for the\r\ndiminished production on the quality last brought in. The aggregate\r\nwealth production, as compared with the aggregate expenditure of labor,\r\nwill be greater, though its distribution will be more unequal.\r\n\r\nThus, increase of population, as it operates to extend production to\r\nlower natural levels, operates to increase rent and reduce wages as a\r\nproportion, and may or may not reduce wages as a quantity; while it\r\nseldom can, and probably never does, reduce the aggregate production of\r\nwealth as compared with the aggregate expenditure of labor, but on the\r\ncontrary increases, and frequently largely increases it.\r\n\r\nBut while the increase of population thus increases rent by lowering\r\nthe margin of cultivation, it is a mistake to look upon this as the\r\nonly mode by which rent advances as population grows. Increasing\r\npopulation increases rent, without reducing the margin of cultivation;\r\nand notwithstanding the dicta of such writers as McCulloch, who assert\r\nthat rent would not arise were there an unbounded extent of equally\r\ngood land, increases it without reference to the natural qualities of\r\nland, for the increased powers of co-operation and exchange which come\r\nwith increased population are equivalent to—nay, I think we can say\r\nwithout metaphor, that they give—an increased capacity to land.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say merely that, like an improvement in the methods\r\nor tools of production, the increased power which comes with increased\r\npopulation gives to the same labor an increased result, which is\r\nequivalent to an increase in the natural powers of land; but that\r\nit brings out a superior power in labor, which is localized on\r\nland—which attaches not to labor generally, but only to labor exerted\r\non particular land; and which thus inheres in the land as much as any\r\nqualities of soil, climate, mineral deposit, or natural situation, and\r\npasses, as they do, with the possession of the land.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in the method of cultivation which, with the same\r\noutlay, will give two crops a year in place of one, or an improvement\r\nin tools and machinery which will double the result of labor, will\r\nmanifestly, on a particular piece of ground, have the same effect\r\non the produce as a doubling of the fertility of the land. But the\r\ndifference is in this respect—the improvement in method or in tools\r\ncan be utilized on any land; but the improvement in fertility can be\r\nutilized only on the particular land to which it applies. Now, in large\r\npart, the increased productiveness of labor which arises from increased\r\npopulation can be utilized only on particular land, and on particular\r\nland in greatly varying degrees.\r\n\r\nHere, let us imagine, is an unbounded savannah, stretching off in\r\nunbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler\r\ntires of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant.\r\nWhere to settle he cannot tell—every acre seems as good as every other\r\nacre. As to wood, as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there\r\nis absolutely no choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of\r\nrichness. Tired out with the search for one place that is better than\r\nanother, he stops—somewhere, anywhere—and starts to make himself a\r\nhome. The soil is virgin and rich, game is abundant, the streams flash\r\nwith the finest trout. Nature is at her very best. He has what, were he\r\nin a populous district, would make him rich; but he is very poor. To\r\nsay nothing of the mental craving, which would lead him to welcome the\r\nsorriest stranger, he labors under all the material disadvantages of\r\nsolitude. He can get no temporary assistance for any work that requires\r\na greater union of strength than that afforded by his own family, or\r\nby such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has cattle, he\r\ncannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill a\r\nbullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and\r\ncobbler—in short, a “jack of all trades and master of none.” He cannot\r\nhave his children schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and\r\nmaintain a teacher. Such things as he cannot produce himself, he must\r\nbuy in quantities and keep on hand, or else go without, for he cannot\r\nbe constantly leaving his work and making a long journey to the verge\r\nof civilization; and when forced to do so, the getting of a vial of\r\nmedicine or the replacement of a broken auger may cost him the labor of\r\nhimself and horses for days. Under such circumstances, though nature is\r\nprolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him to get enough\r\nto eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy only the\r\nsimplest wants in the rudest way.\r\n\r\nSoon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section of\r\nthe boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is\r\nnot beset by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land\r\nis the same, there is one place that is clearly better for him than\r\nany other place, and that is where there is already a settler and he\r\nmay have a neighbor. He settles by the side of the first comer, whose\r\ncondition is at once greatly improved, and to whom many things are now\r\npossible that were before impossible, for two men may help each other\r\nto do things that one man could never do.\r\n\r\nAnother immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles\r\nwhere there are already two. Another, and another, until around\r\nour first comer there are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an\r\neffectiveness which, in the solitary state, it could not approach.\r\nIf heavy work is to be done, the settlers have a log-rolling, and\r\ntogether accomplish in a day what singly would require years. When\r\none kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they\r\nkill, and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a\r\nschoolmaster, and the children of each are taught for a fractional part\r\nof what similar teaching would have cost the first settler. It becomes\r\na comparatively easy matter to send to the nearest town, for some one\r\nis always going. But there is less need for such journeys. A blacksmith\r\nand a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our settler can have his tools\r\nrepaired for a small part of the labor it formerly cost him. A store\r\nis opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a post-office,\r\nsoon added, gives him regular communication with the rest of the world.\r\nThen come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness-maker, a doctor; and a\r\nlittle church soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the\r\nsolitary state were impossible. There are gratifications for the social\r\nand the intellectual nature—for that part of the man that rises above\r\nthe animal. The power of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the\r\nemulation of comparison and contrast, open a wider, and fuller, and\r\nmore varied life. In rejoicing, there are others to rejoice; in sorrow,\r\nthe mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees, and apple\r\nparings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered and\r\nthe orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the\r\nstrain, and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are\r\nothers to admire and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers;\r\nby the open grave, stands human sympathy to sustain the mourners.\r\nOccasionally, comes a straggling lecturer to open up glimpses of the\r\nworld of science, of literature, or of art; in election times, come\r\nstump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and power,\r\nas the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John\r\nDoe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes\r\nthe circus, talked of months before, and opening to children whose\r\nhorizon has been the prairie, all the realms of the imagination—princes\r\nand princesses of fairy tale, mail-clad crusaders and turbaned Moors,\r\nCinderella’s fairy coach, and the giants of nursery lore; lions such\r\nas crouched before Daniel, or in circling Roman amphitheater tore the\r\nsaints of God; ostriches who recall the sandy deserts; camels such\r\nas stood around when the wicked brethren raised Joseph from the well\r\nand sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the Alps with\r\nHannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music that\r\nthrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome\r\nof Kubla Khan.\r\n\r\nGo to our settler now, and say to him: “You have so many fruit trees\r\nwhich you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house—in\r\nshort, you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your\r\nland itself is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by\r\nand by it will need manure. I will give you the full value of all your\r\nimprovements if you will give it to me, and go again with your family\r\nbeyond the verge of settlement.” He would laugh at you. His land yields\r\nno more wheat or potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of\r\nall the necessaries and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring\r\nno heavier crops, and, we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it\r\nwill bring far more of all the other things for which men work. The\r\npresence of other settlers—the increase of population—has added to\r\nthe productiveness, in these things, of labor bestowed upon it, and\r\nthis added productiveness gives it a superiority over land of equal\r\nnatural quality where there are as yet no settlers. If no land remains\r\nto be taken up, except such as is as far removed from population as\r\nwas our settler’s land when he first went upon it, the value or rent\r\nof this land will be measured by the whole of this added capability.\r\nIf, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous stretch of\r\nequal land, over which population is now spreading, it will not be\r\nnecessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did the\r\nfirst. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get the\r\nadvantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler’s\r\nland will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the\r\ncenter of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the\r\nmargin of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of\r\nproduction will be raised.\r\n\r\nPopulation still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the\r\neconomies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the\r\nproductiveness of the land. Our first settler’s land, being the center\r\nof population, the store, the blacksmith’s forge, the wheelwright’s\r\nshop, are set up on it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village,\r\nwhich rapidly grows into a town, the center of exchanges for the people\r\nof the whole district. With no greater agricultural productiveness\r\nthan it had at first, this land now begins to develop a productiveness\r\nof a higher kind. To labor expended in raising corn, or wheat, or\r\npotatoes, it will yield no more of those things than at first; but to\r\nlabor expended in the subdivided branches of production which require\r\nproximity to other producers, and, especially, to labor expended in\r\nthat final part of production, which consists in distribution, it will\r\nyield much larger returns. The wheat-grower may go further on, and\r\nfind land on which his labor will produce as much wheat, and nearly as\r\nmuch wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper, the\r\nprofessional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center\r\nof exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a\r\nlittle distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for\r\nsuch purposes the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its\r\nwheat-producing power. And so our settler is able to sell in building\r\nlots a few of his acres for prices which it would not bring for\r\nwheat-growing if its fertility had been multiplied many times. With the\r\nproceeds, he builds himself a fine house, and furnishes it handsomely.\r\nThat is to say, to reduce the transaction to its lowest terms, the\r\npeople who wish to use the land build and furnish the house for him,\r\non condition that he will let them avail themselves of the superior\r\nproductiveness which the increase of population has given the land.\r\n\r\nPopulation still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater\r\nutility to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town\r\nhas grown into a city—a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco—and\r\nstill it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with\r\nthe best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of\r\nlabor becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency;\r\nexchanges are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the\r\nminimum of friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the\r\nvast social organism that has grown up from the germ of the first\r\nsettlement; here has developed one of the great ganglions of the human\r\nworld. Hither run all roads, hither set all currents, through all the\r\nvast regions round about. Here, if you have anything to sell, is the\r\nmarket; here, if you have anything to buy, is the largest and the\r\nchoicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered into a focus,\r\nand here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision of mind\r\nwith mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries\r\nof knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are\r\nmuseums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and\r\nall things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great\r\nactors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in\r\nshort, is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.\r\n\r\nSo enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the\r\napplication of labor that instead of one man with a span of horses\r\nscratching over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to\r\nthe acre, working tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other,\r\nfive, six, seven and eight stories from the ground, while underneath\r\nthe surface of the earth engines are throbbing with pulsations that\r\nexert the force of thousands of horses.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and\r\nno other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of\r\npopulation—the focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of\r\nthe highest forms of industry. The productive powers which density\r\nof population has attached to this land are equivalent to the\r\nmultiplication of its original fertility by the hundred fold and the\r\nthousand fold. And rent, which measures the difference between this\r\nadded productiveness and that of the least productive land in use, has\r\nincreased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever has succeeded to his\r\nright to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another Rip Van Winkle,\r\nhe may have lain down and slept; still he is rich—not from anything\r\nhe has done, but from the increase of population. There are lots from\r\nwhich for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more than an\r\naverage mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for more than\r\nwould suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal streets are\r\ntowering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass, finished\r\nin the most expensive style, replete with every convenience. Yet they\r\nare not worth as much as the land upon which they rest—the same land,\r\nin nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon it had no\r\nvalue at all.\r\n\r\nThat this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully\r\nacts in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look\r\naround him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his\r\neyes. The increasing difference in the productiveness of the land in\r\nuse, which causes an increasing rise in rent, results not so much\r\nfrom the necessities of increased population compelling the resort to\r\ninferior land, as from the increased productiveness which increased\r\npopulation gives to the lands already in use. The most valuable lands\r\non the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are not lands of\r\nsurpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing utility\r\nhas been given by the increase of population.\r\n\r\nThe increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population\r\ngives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling\r\nattention, attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The\r\nvaluable quality of land that has become a center of population is its\r\nsuperficial capacity—it makes no difference whether it is fertile,\r\nalluvial soil like that of Philadelphia; rich bottom land like that of\r\nNew Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that of St. Petersburg, or a sandy\r\nwaste like the greater part of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAnd where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such\r\nas deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or\r\nheavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are\r\nbrought out, rendered tangible, by population. The coal and iron fields\r\nof Pennsylvania, that to-day are worth enormous sums, were fifty years\r\nago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference? Simply\r\nthe difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming and\r\nMontana, which to-day are valueless, will, in fifty years from now, be\r\nworth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population\r\nwill have greatly increased.\r\n\r\nIt is a well provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If\r\nthe bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch\r\nand there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very\r\ngreat command over the services of others comes to those who as the\r\nhatches are opened are permitted to say, “This is mine!”\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: The effect of increasing population upon the\r\ndistribution of wealth is to increase rent, and consequently to\r\ndiminish the proportion of the produce which goes to capital and labor,\r\nin two ways: First, By lowering the margin of cultivation. Second, By\r\nbringing out in land special capabilities otherwise latent, and by\r\nattaching special capabilities to particular lands.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to think that the latter mode, to which little attention\r\nhas been given by political economists, is really the more important.\r\nBut this, in our inquiry, is not a matter of moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ARTS UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEliminating improvements in the arts, we have seen the effects of\r\nincrease of population upon the distribution of wealth. Eliminating\r\nincrease of population, let us now see what effect improvements in the\r\narts of production have upon distribution.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that increase of population increases rent, rather by\r\nincreasing the productiveness of labor than by decreasing it. If it\r\ncan now be shown that, irrespective of the increase of population, the\r\neffect of improvements in methods of production and exchange is to\r\nincrease rent, the disproof of the Malthusian theory—and of all the\r\ndoctrines derived from or related to it—will be final and complete, for\r\nwe shall have accounted for the tendency of material progress to lower\r\nwages and depress the condition of the lowest class, without recourse\r\nto the theory of increasing pressure against the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nThat this is the case will, I think, appear on the slightest\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe effect of inventions and improvements in the productive arts is to\r\nsave labor—that is, to enable the same result to be secured with less\r\nlabor, or a greater result with the same labor.\r\n\r\nNow, in a state of society in which the existing power of labor served\r\nto satisfy all material desires, and there was no possibility of new\r\ndesires being called forth by the opportunity of gratifying them,\r\nthe effect of labor-saving improvements would be simply to reduce\r\nthe amount of labor expended. But such a state of society, if it can\r\nanywhere be found, which I do not believe, exists only where the human\r\nmost nearly approaches the animal. In the state of society called\r\ncivilized, and which in this inquiry we are concerned with, the very\r\nreverse is the case. Demand is not a fixed quantity, that increases\r\nonly as population increases. In each individual it rises with _his_\r\npower of getting the things demanded. Man is not an ox, who, when he\r\nhas eaten his fill, lies down to chew the cud; he is the daughter\r\nof the horse leech, who constantly asks for more. “When I get some\r\nmoney,” said Erasmus, “I will buy me some Greek books and afterward\r\nsome clothes.” The amount of wealth produced is nowhere commensurate\r\nwith the desire for wealth, and desire mounts with every additional\r\nopportunity for gratification.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, the effect of labor-saving improvements will\r\nbe to increase the production of wealth. Now, for the production of\r\nwealth, two things are required—labor and land. Therefore, the effect\r\nof labor-saving improvements will be to extend the demand for land,\r\nand wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached, to\r\nbring into cultivation lands of less natural productiveness, or to\r\nextend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural\r\nproductiveness. And thus, while the primary effect of labor-saving\r\nimprovements is to increase the power of labor, the secondary\r\neffect is to extend cultivation, and, where this lowers the margin\r\nof cultivation, to increase rent. Thus, where land is entirely\r\nappropriated, as in England, or where it is either appropriated or is\r\ncapable of appropriation as rapidly as it is needed for use, as in\r\nthe United States, the ultimate effect of labor-saving machinery or\r\nimprovements is to increase rent without increasing wages or interest.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this be fully understood, for it shows that\r\neffects attributed by current theories to increase of population are\r\nreally due to the progress of invention, and explains the otherwise\r\nperplexing fact that labor-saving machinery everywhere fails to benefit\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\nYet, to grasp fully this truth, it is necessary to keep in mind what\r\nI have already more than once adverted to—the interchangeability of\r\nwealth. I refer to this again, only because it is so persistently\r\nforgotten or ignored by writers who speak of agricultural production as\r\nthough it were to be distinguished from production in general, and of\r\nfood or subsistence as though it were not included in the term wealth.\r\n\r\nLet me ask the reader to bear in mind, what has already been\r\nsufficiently illustrated, that the possession or production of any\r\nform of wealth is virtually the possession or production of any\r\nother form of wealth for which it will exchange—in order that he may\r\nclearly see that it is not merely improvements which effect a saving\r\nin labor directly applied to land that tend to increase rent, but all\r\nimprovements that in any way save labor.\r\n\r\nThat the labor of any individual is applied exclusively to the\r\nproduction of one form of wealth is solely the result of the division\r\nof labor. The object of labor on the part of any individual is not the\r\nobtainment of wealth in one particular form, but the obtainment of\r\nwealth in all the forms that consort with his desires. And, hence, an\r\nimprovement which effects a saving in the labor required to produce\r\none of the things desired, is, in effect, an increase in the power of\r\nproducing all the other things. If it take half a man’s labor to keep\r\nhim in food, and the other half to provide him clothing and shelter,\r\nan improvement which would increase his power of producing food would\r\nalso increase his power of providing clothing and shelter. If his\r\ndesires for more or better food, and for more or better clothing\r\nand shelter, were equal, an improvement in one department of labor\r\nwould be precisely equivalent to a like improvement in the other. If\r\nthe improvement consisted in a doubling of the power of his labor in\r\nproducing food, he would give one-third less labor to the production\r\nof food, and one-third more to the providing of clothing and shelter.\r\nIf the improvement doubled his power to provide clothing and shelter\r\nhe would give one-third less labor to the production of these things,\r\nand one-third more to the production of food. In either case, the\r\nresult would be the same—he would be enabled with the same labor to get\r\none-third more in quantity or quality of all the things he desired.\r\n\r\nAnd, so, where production is carried on by the division of labor\r\nbetween individuals, an increase in the power of producing one of the\r\nthings sought by production in the aggregate adds to the power of\r\nobtaining others, and will increase the production of the others, to\r\nan extent determined by the proportion which the saving of labor bears\r\nto the total amount of labor expended, and by the relative strength\r\nof desires. I am unable to think of any form of wealth, the demand\r\nfor which would not be increased by a saving in the labor required to\r\nproduce the others. Hearses and coffins have been selected as examples\r\nof things for which the demand is little likely to increase; but this\r\nis true only as to quantity. That increased power of supply would lead\r\nto a demand for more expensive hearses and coffins, no one can doubt\r\nwho has noticed how strong is the desire to show regard for the dead by\r\ncostly funerals.\r\n\r\nNor is the demand for food limited, as in economic reasoning is\r\nfrequently, but erroneously, assumed. Subsistence is often spoken of\r\nas though it were a fixed quantity; but it is fixed only as having a\r\ndefinite minimum. Less than a certain amount will not keep a human\r\nbeing alive, and less than a somewhat larger amount will not keep a\r\nhuman being in good health. But, above this minimum, the subsistence\r\nwhich a human being can use may be increased almost indefinitely.\r\nAdam Smith says, and Ricardo indorses the statement, that the desire\r\nfor food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human\r\nstomach; but this, manifestly, is true only in the sense that when\r\na man’s belly is filled, hunger is satisfied. His demands for food\r\nhave no such limit. The stomach of a Louis XIV., a Louis XV., or\r\na Louis XVI., could not hold or digest more than the stomach of a\r\nFrench peasant of equal stature, yet, while a few rods of ground would\r\nsupply the black bread and herbs which constituted the subsistence\r\nof the peasant, it took hundreds of thousands of acres to supply the\r\ndemands of the king, who, besides his own wasteful use of the finest\r\nqualities of food, required immense supplies for his servants, horses\r\nand dogs. And in the common facts of daily life, in the unsatisfied,\r\nthough perhaps latent, desires which each one has, we may see how every\r\nincrease in the power of producing any form of wealth must result in\r\nan increased demand for land and the direct products of land. The man\r\nwho now uses coarse food, and lives in a small house, will, as a rule,\r\nif his income be increased, use more costly food, and move to a larger\r\nhouse. If he grows richer and richer he will procure horses, servants,\r\ngardens and lawns, his demand for the use of land constantly increasing\r\nwith his wealth. In the city where I write, is a man—but the type of\r\nmen everywhere to be found—who used to boil his own beans and fry his\r\nown bacon, but who, now that he has got rich, maintains a town house\r\nthat takes up a whole block and would answer for a first-class hotel,\r\ntwo or three country houses with extensive grounds, a large stud of\r\nracers, a breeding farm, private track, etc. It certainly takes at\r\nleast a thousand times, it may be several thousand times, as much land\r\nto supply the demands of this man now as it did when he was poor.\r\n\r\nAnd, so, every improvement or invention, no matter what it be, which\r\ngives to labor the power of producing more wealth, causes an increased\r\ndemand for land and its direct products, and thus tends to force\r\ndown the margin of cultivation, just as would the demand caused by\r\nan increased population. This being the case, every labor-saving\r\ninvention, whether it be a steam plow, a telegraph, an improved process\r\nof smelting ores, a perfecting printing press, or a sewing machine, has\r\na tendency to increase rent.\r\n\r\nOr to state this truth concisely:\r\n\r\n _Wealth in all its forms being the product of labor applied to land or\r\n the products of land, any increase in the power of labor, the demand\r\n for wealth being unsatisfied, will be utilized in procuring more\r\n wealth, and thus increase the demand for land._\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this effect of labor-saving machinery and improvements,\r\nlet us suppose a country where, as in all the countries of the\r\ncivilized world, the land is in the possession of but a portion of the\r\npeople. Let us suppose a permanent barrier fixed to further increase\r\nof population, either by the enactment and strict enforcement of an\r\nHerodian law, or from such a change in manners and morals as might\r\nresult from an extensive circulation of Annie Besant’s pamphlets.\r\nLet the margin of cultivation, or production, be represented by 20.\r\nThus land or other natural opportunities which, from the application\r\nof labor and capital, will yield a return of 20, will just give the\r\nordinary rate of wages and interest, without yielding any rent; while\r\nall lands yielding to equal applications of labor and capital more\r\nthan 20 will yield the excess as rent. Population remaining fixed,\r\nlet there be made inventions and improvements which will reduce by\r\none-tenth the expenditure of labor and capital necessary to produce\r\nthe same amount of wealth. Now, either one-tenth of the labor and\r\ncapital may be freed, and production remain the same as before; or\r\nthe same amount of labor and capital may be employed, and production\r\nbe correspondingly increased. But the industrial organization, as\r\nin all civilized countries, is such that labor and capital, and\r\nespecially labor, must press for employment on any terms—the industrial\r\norganization is such that mere laborers are not in a position to demand\r\ntheir fair share in the new adjustment, and that any reduction in the\r\napplication of labor to production will, at first, at least, take the\r\nform, not of giving each laborer the same amount of produce for less\r\nwork, but of throwing some of the laborers out of work and giving them\r\nnone of the produce. Now, owing to the increased efficiency of labor\r\nsecured by the new improvements, as great a return can be secured at\r\nthe point of natural productiveness represented by 18, as before at 20.\r\nThus, the unsatisfied desire for wealth, the competition of labor and\r\ncapital for employment, would insure the extension of the margin of\r\nproduction, we will say to 18, and thus rent would be increased by the\r\ndifference between 18 and 20, while wages and interest, in quantity,\r\nwould be no more than before, and, in proportion to the whole produce,\r\nwould be less. There would be a greater production of wealth, but land\r\nowners would get the whole benefit, subject to temporary deductions,\r\nwhich will be hereafter stated.\r\n\r\nIf invention and improvement still go on, the efficiency of labor\r\nwill be still further increased, and the amount of labor and capital\r\nnecessary to produce a given result further diminished. The same causes\r\nwill lead to the utilization of this new gain in productive power for\r\nthe production of more wealth; the margin of cultivation will be\r\nagain extended, and rent will increase, both in proportion and amount,\r\nwithout any increase in wages and interest. And, so, as invention\r\nand improvement go on, constantly adding to the efficiency of labor,\r\nthe margin of production will be pushed lower and lower, and rent\r\nconstantly increased, though population should remain stationary.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the lowering of the margin of production\r\nwould always exactly correspond with the increase in productive power,\r\nany more than I mean to say that the process would be one of clearly\r\ndefined steps. Whether, in any particular case, the lowering of the\r\nmargin of production lags behind or exceeds the increase in productive\r\npower, will depend, I conceive, upon what may be called the area of\r\nproductiveness that can be utilized before cultivation is forced to\r\nthe next lowest point. For instance, if the margin of cultivation be\r\nat 20, improvements which enable the same produce to be obtained with\r\none-tenth less capital and labor will not carry the margin to 18, if\r\nthe area having a productiveness of 19 is sufficient to employ all the\r\nlabor and capital displaced from the cultivation of the superior lands.\r\nIn this case, the margin of cultivation would rest at 19, and rents\r\nwould be increased by the difference between 19 and 20, and wages and\r\ninterest by the difference between 18 and 19. But if, with the same\r\nincrease in productive power the area of productiveness between 20\r\nand 18 should not be sufficient to employ all the displaced labor and\r\ncapital, the margin of cultivation must, if the same amount of labor\r\nand capital press for employment, be carried lower than 18. In this\r\ncase, rent would gain more than the increase in the product, and wages\r\nand interest would be less than before the improvements which increased\r\nproductive power.\r\n\r\nNor is it precisely true that the labor set free by each improvement\r\nwill all be driven to seek employment in the production of more wealth.\r\nThe increased power of satisfaction, which each fresh improvement gives\r\nto a certain portion of the community, will be utilized in demanding\r\nleisure or services, as well as in demanding wealth. Some laborers\r\nwill, therefore, become idlers and some will pass from the ranks of\r\nproductive to those of unproductive laborers—the proportion of which,\r\nas observation shows, tends to increase with the progress of society.\r\n\r\nBut, as I shall presently refer to a cause, as yet unconsidered, which\r\nconstantly tends to lower the margin of cultivation, to steady the\r\nadvance of rent, and even carry it beyond the proportion that would be\r\nfixed by the actual margin of cultivation, it is not worth while to\r\ntake into account these perturbations in the downward movement of the\r\nmargin of cultivation and the upward movement of rent. All I wish to\r\nmake clear is that, without any increase in population, the progress of\r\ninvention constantly tends to give a larger proportion of the produce\r\nto the owners of land, and a smaller and smaller proportion to labor\r\nand capital.\r\n\r\nAnd, as we can assign no limits to the progress of invention, neither\r\ncan we assign any limits to the increase of rent, short of the whole\r\nproduce. For, if labor-saving inventions went on until perfection\r\nwas attained, and the necessity of labor in the production of wealth\r\nwas entirely done away with, then everything that the earth could\r\nyield could be obtained without labor, and the margin of cultivation\r\nwould be extended to zero. Wages would be nothing, and interest would\r\nbe nothing, while rent would take everything. For the owners of the\r\nland, being enabled without labor to obtain all the wealth that could\r\nbe procured from nature, there would be no use for either labor or\r\ncapital, and no possible way in which either could compel any share of\r\nthe wealth produced. And no matter how small population might be, if\r\nanybody but the land owners continued to exist, it would be at the whim\r\nor by the mercy of the land owners—they would be maintained either for\r\nthe amusement of the land owners, or, as paupers, by their bounty.\r\n\r\nThis point, of the absolute perfection of labor-saving inventions, may\r\nseem very remote, if not impossible of attainment; but it is a point\r\ntoward which the march of invention is every day more strongly tending.\r\nAnd in the thinning out of population in the agricultural districts\r\nof Great Britain, where small farms are being converted into larger\r\nones, and in the great machine-worked wheat-fields of California and\r\nDakota, where one may ride for miles and miles through waving grain\r\nwithout seeing a human habitation, there are already suggestions of the\r\nfinal goal toward which the whole civilized world is hastening. The\r\nsteam plow and the reaping machine are creating in the modern world\r\nlatifundia of the same kind that the influx of slaves from foreign wars\r\ncreated in ancient Italy. And to many a poor fellow as he is shoved\r\nout of his accustomed place and forced to move on—as the Roman farmers\r\nwere forced to join the proletariat of the great city, or sell their\r\nblood for bread in the ranks of the legions—it seems as though these\r\nlabor-saving inventions were in themselves a curse, and we hear men\r\ntalking of work, as though the wearying strain of the muscles were, in\r\nitself, a thing to be desired.\r\n\r\nIn what has preceded, I have, of course, spoken of inventions and\r\nimprovements when generally diffused. It is hardly necessary to say\r\nthat as long as an invention or an improvement is used by so few that\r\nthey derive a special advantage from it, it does not, to the extent of\r\nthis special advantage, affect the general distribution of wealth. So,\r\nin regard to the limited monopolies created by patent laws, or by the\r\ncauses which give the same character to railroad and telegraph lines,\r\netc. Although generally mistaken for profits of capital, the special\r\nprofits thus arising are really the returns of monopoly, as has been\r\nexplained in a previous chapter, and, to the extent that they subtract\r\nfrom the benefits of an improvement, do not primarily affect general\r\ndistribution. For instance, the benefits of a railroad or similar\r\nimprovement in cheapening transportation are diffused or monopolized,\r\nas its charges are reduced to a rate which will yield ordinary interest\r\non the capital invested, or kept up to a point which will yield an\r\nextraordinary return, or cover the stealing of the constructors or\r\ndirectors. And, as is well known, the rise in rent or land values\r\ncorresponds with the reduction in the charges.\r\n\r\nAs has before been said, in the improvements which advance rent, are\r\nnot only to be included the improvements which directly increase\r\nproductive power, but also such improvements in government, manners,\r\nand morals as indirectly increase it. Considered as material forces,\r\nthe effect of all these is to increase productive power, and, like\r\nimprovements in the productive arts, their benefit is ultimately\r\nmonopolized by the possessors of the land. A notable instance of this\r\nis to be found in the abolition of protection by England. Free trade\r\nhas enormously increased the wealth of Great Britain, without lessening\r\npauperism. It has simply increased rent. And if the corrupt governments\r\nof our great American cities were to be made models of purity and\r\neconomy, the effect would simply be to increase the value of land, not\r\nto raise either wages or interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE EXPECTATION RAISED BY MATERIAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that while advancing population tends to advance rent,\r\nso all the causes that in a progressive state of society operate to\r\nincrease the productive power of labor tend, also, to advance rent, and\r\nnot to advance wages or interest. The increased production of wealth\r\ngoes ultimately to the owners of land in increased rent; and, although,\r\nas improvement goes on, advantages may accrue to individuals not land\r\nholders, which concentrate in their hands considerable portions of the\r\nincreased produce, yet there is in all this improvement nothing which\r\ntends to increase the general return either to labor or to capital.\r\n\r\nBut there is a cause, not yet adverted to, which must be taken into\r\nconsideration fully to explain the influence of material progress upon\r\nthe distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nThat cause is the confident expectation of the future enhancement of\r\nland values, which arises in all progressive countries from the steady\r\nincrease of rent, and which leads to speculation, or the holding of\r\nland for a higher price than it would then otherwise bring.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto assumed, as is generally assumed in elucidations\r\nof the theory of rent, that the actual margin of cultivation\r\nalways coincides with what may be termed the necessary margin of\r\ncultivation—that is to say, we have assumed that cultivation extends to\r\nless productive points only as it becomes necessary from the fact that\r\nnatural opportunities are at the more productive points fully utilized.\r\n\r\nThis, probably, is the case in stationary or very slowly progressing\r\ncommunities, but in rapidly progressing communities, where the\r\nswift and steady increase of rent gives confidence to calculations\r\nof further increase, it is not the case. In such communities, the\r\nconfident expectation of increased prices produces, to a greater or\r\nless extent, the effects of a combination among land holders, and tends\r\nto the withholding of land from use, in expectation of higher prices,\r\nthus forcing the margin of cultivation farther than required by the\r\nnecessities of production.\r\n\r\nThis cause must operate to some extent in all progressive communities,\r\nthough in such countries as England, where the tenant system prevails\r\nin agriculture, it may be shown more in the selling price of land than\r\nin the agricultural margin of cultivation, or actual rent. But in\r\ncommunities like the United States, where the user of land generally\r\nprefers, if he can, to own it, and where there is a great extent of\r\nland to overrun, it operates with enormous power.\r\n\r\nThe immense area over which the population of the United States is\r\nscattered shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern seaboard in\r\nsearch of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without\r\npaying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass\r\nfor long distances through half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas\r\nof virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be had free\r\nof rent—_i.e._, by homestead entry or pre-emption. He (and, with him,\r\nthe margin of cultivation) is forced so much farther than he otherwise\r\nneed have gone, by the speculation which is holding these unused lands\r\nin expectation of increased value in the future. And when he settles,\r\nhe will, in his turn, take up, if he can, more land than he can use, in\r\nthe belief that it will soon become valuable; and so those who follow\r\nhim are again forced farther on than the necessities of production\r\nrequire, carrying the margin of cultivation to still less productive,\r\nbecause still more remote points.\r\n\r\nThe same thing may be seen in every rapidly growing city. If the land\r\nof superior quality as to location were always fully used before land\r\nof inferior quality were resorted to, no vacant lots would be left as\r\na city extended, nor would we find miserable shanties in the midst of\r\ncostly buildings. These lots, some of them extremely valuable, are\r\nwithheld from use, or from the full use to which they might be put,\r\nbecause their owners, not being able or not wishing to improve them,\r\nprefer, in expectation of the advance of land values, to hold them for\r\na higher rate than could now be obtained from those willing to improve\r\nthem. And, in consequence of this land being withheld from use, or from\r\nthe full use of which it is capable, the margin of the city is pushed\r\naway so much farther from the center.\r\n\r\nBut when we reach the limits of the growing city—the actual margin\r\nof building, which corresponds to the margin of cultivation in\r\nagriculture—we shall not find the land purchasable at its value for\r\nagricultural purposes, as it would be were rent determined simply by\r\npresent requirements; but we shall find that for a long distance beyond\r\nthe city land bears a speculative value, based upon the belief that it\r\nwill be required in the future for urban purposes, and that to reach\r\nthe point at which land can be purchased at a price not based upon\r\nurban rent, we must go very far beyond the actual margin of urban use.\r\n\r\nOr, to take another case of a different kind, instances similar to\r\nwhich may doubtless be found in every locality. There is in Marin\r\nCounty, within easy access of San Francisco, a fine belt of redwood\r\ntimber. Naturally, this would be first used, before resorting for the\r\nsupply of the San Francisco market to timber lands at a much greater\r\ndistance. But it yet remains uncut, and lumber procured many miles\r\nbeyond is daily hauled past it on the railroad, because its owner\r\nprefers to hold for the greater price it will bring in the future.\r\nThus, by the withholding from use of this body of timber, the margin\r\nof production of redwood is forced so much farther up and down the\r\nCoast Range. That mineral land, when reduced to private ownership,\r\nis frequently withheld from use while poorer deposits are worked, is\r\nwell known, and in new States it is common to find individuals who\r\nare called “land poor”—that is, who remain poor, sometimes almost to\r\ndeprivation, because they insist on holding land, which they themselves\r\ncannot use, at prices at which no one else can profitably use it.\r\n\r\nTo recur now to the illustration we made use of in the preceding\r\nchapter: With the margin of cultivation standing at 20, an increase\r\nin the power of production takes place, which renders the same result\r\nobtainable with one-tenth less labor. For reasons before stated, the\r\nmargin of production must now be forced down, and if it rests at 18,\r\nthe return to labor and capital will be the same as before, when the\r\nmargin stood at 20. Whether it will be forced to 18 or be forced lower\r\ndepends upon what I have called the area of productiveness which\r\nintervenes between 20 and 18. But if the confident expectation of a\r\nfurther increase of rents leads the land owners to demand 3 rent for\r\n20 land, 2 for 19, and 1 for 18 land, and to withhold their land from\r\nuse until these terms are complied with, the area of productiveness\r\nmay be so reduced that the margin of cultivation must fall to 17 or\r\neven lower; and thus, as the result of the increase in the efficiency\r\nof labor, laborers would get less than before, while interest would be\r\nproportionately reduced, and rent would increase in greater ratio than\r\nthe increase in productive power.\r\n\r\nWhether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production,\r\nor as a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the\r\ninfluence of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact\r\nwhich cannot be ignored in any complete theory of the distribution of\r\nwealth in progressive countries. It is the force, evolved by material\r\nprogress, which tends constantly to increase rent in a greater ratio\r\nthan progress increases production, and thus constantly tends, as\r\nmaterial progress goes on and productive power increases, to reduce\r\nwages, not merely relatively, but absolutely. It is this expansive\r\nforce which, operating with great power in new countries, brings to\r\nthem, seemingly long before their time, the social diseases of older\r\ncountries; produces “tramps” on virgin acres, and breeds paupers on\r\nhalf-tilled soil.\r\n\r\nIn short, the general and steady advance in land values in a\r\nprogressive community necessarily produces that additional tendency\r\nto advance which is seen in the case of commodities when any general\r\nand continuous cause operates to increase their price. As, during the\r\nrapid depreciation of currency which marked the latter days of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, the fact that whatever was bought one day could\r\nbe sold for a higher price the next, operated to carry up the prices of\r\ncommodities even faster than the depreciation of the currency, so does\r\nthe steady increase of land values, which material progress produces,\r\noperate still further to accelerate the increase. We see this secondary\r\ncause operating in full force in those manias of land speculation which\r\nmark the growth of new communities; but though these are the abnormal\r\nand occasional manifestations, it is undeniable that the cause steadily\r\noperates, with greater or less intensity, in all progressive societies.\r\n\r\nThe cause which limits speculation in commodities, the tendency of\r\nincreasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot limit the\r\nspeculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,\r\nwhich human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is\r\nnevertheless a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by\r\nlabor and capital as the condition of engaging in production. If it\r\nwere possible continuously to reduce wages until zero were reached,\r\nit would be possible continuously to increase rent until it swallowed\r\nup the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently reduced\r\nbelow the point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce,\r\nnor interest below the point at which capital will be devoted to\r\nproduction, there is a limit which restrains the speculative advance\r\nof rent. Hence speculation cannot have the same scope to advance rent\r\nin countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum, as\r\nin countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there is\r\nin all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative\r\nadvance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,\r\nI think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis—a matter\r\nwhich will be more fully examined in the next book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM SOLVED.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.—THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF RECURRING PAROXYSMS OF INDUSTRIAL\r\n DEPRESSION.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.—THE PERSISTENCE OF POVERTY AMID ADVANCING WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n To whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belong the fruits\r\n of it.

We may now marshal the results.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the industrial depressions, to account for which so many\r\ncontradictory and self-contradictory theories are broached.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the manner in which the speculative advance in\r\nland values cuts down the earnings of labor and capital and checks\r\nproduction leads, I think, irresistibly to the conclusion that this\r\nis the main cause of those periodical industrial depressions to which\r\nevery civilized country, and all civilized countries together, seem\r\nincreasingly liable.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that there are not other proximate causes. The\r\ngrowing complexity and interdependence of the machinery of production,\r\nwhich makes each shock or stoppage propagate itself through a widening\r\ncircle; the essential defect of currencies which contract when most\r\nneeded, and the tremendous alternations in volume that occur in the\r\nsimpler forms of commercial credit, which, to a much greater extent\r\nthan currency in any form, constitute the medium or flux of exchanges;\r\nthe protective tariffs which present artificial barriers to the\r\ninterplay of productive forces, and other similar causes, undoubtedly\r\nbear important part in producing and continuing what are called\r\nhard times. But, both from the consideration of principles and the\r\nobservation of phenomena, it is clear that the great initiatory cause\r\nis to be looked for in the speculative advance of land values.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I have shown that the speculative advance in\r\nland values tends to press the margin of cultivation, or production,\r\nbeyond its normal limit, thus compelling labor and capital to accept\r\nof a smaller return, or (and this is the only way they can resist the\r\ntendency) to cease production. Now, it is not only natural that labor\r\nand capital should resist the crowding down of wages and interest\r\nby the speculative advance of rent, but they are driven to this in\r\nself-defense, inasmuch as there is a minimum of return below which\r\nlabor cannot exist nor capital be maintained. Hence, from the fact of\r\nspeculation in land, we may infer all the phenomena which mark these\r\nrecurring seasons of industrial depression.\r\n\r\nGiven a progressive community, in which population is increasing and\r\none improvement succeeds another, and land must constantly increase in\r\nvalue. This steady increase naturally leads to speculation in which\r\nfuture increase is anticipated, and land values are carried beyond the\r\npoint at which, under the existing conditions of production, their\r\naccustomed returns would be left to labor and capital. Production,\r\ntherefore, begins to stop. Not that there is necessarily, or even\r\nprobably, an absolute diminution in production; but that there is\r\nwhat in a progressive community would be equivalent to an absolute\r\ndiminution of production in a stationary community—a failure in\r\nproduction to increase proportionately, owing to the failure of new\r\nincrements of labor and capital to find employment at the accustomed\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nThis stoppage of production at some points must necessarily show itself\r\nat other points of the industrial network, in a cessation of demand,\r\nwhich would again check production there, and thus the paralysis would\r\ncommunicate itself through all the interlacings of industry and\r\ncommerce, producing everywhere a partial disjointing of production\r\nand exchange, and resulting in the phenomena that seem to show\r\noverproduction or overconsumption, according to the standpoint from\r\nwhich they are viewed.\r\n\r\nThe period of depression thus ensuing would continue until (1) the\r\nspeculative advance in rents had been lost; or (2) the increase in the\r\nefficiency of labor, owing to the growth of population and the progress\r\nof improvement, had enabled the normal rent line to overtake the\r\nspeculative rent line; or (3) labor and capital had become reconciled\r\nto engaging in production for smaller returns. Or, most probably, all\r\nthree of these causes would co-operate to produce a new equilibrium,\r\nat which all the forces of production would again engage, and a season\r\nof activity ensue; whereupon rent would begin to advance again, a\r\nspeculative advance again take place, production again be checked, and\r\nthe same round be gone over.\r\n\r\nIn the elaborate and complicated system of production which is\r\ncharacteristic of modern civilization, where, moreover, there is no\r\nsuch thing as a distinct and independent industrial community, but\r\ngeographically or politically separated communities blend and interlace\r\ntheir industrial organizations in different modes and varying measures,\r\nit is not to be expected that effect should be seen to follow cause as\r\nclearly and definitely as would be the case in a simpler development of\r\nindustry, and in a community forming a complete and distinct industrial\r\nwhole; but, nevertheless, the phenomena actually presented by these\r\nalternate seasons of activity and depression clearly correspond with\r\nthose we have inferred from the speculative advance of rent.\r\n\r\nDeduction thus shows the actual phenomena as resulting from the\r\nprinciple. If we reverse the process, it is as easy by induction to\r\nreach the principle by tracing up the phenomena.\r\n\r\nThese seasons of depression are always preceded by seasons of activity\r\nand speculation, and on all hands the connection between the two is\r\nadmitted—the depression being looked upon as the reaction from the\r\nspeculation, as the headache of the morning is the reaction from the\r\ndebauch of the night. But as to the manner in which the depression\r\nresults from the speculation, there are two classes or schools of\r\nopinion, as the attempts made on both sides of the Atlantic to account\r\nfor the present industrial depression will show.\r\n\r\nOne school says that the speculation produced the depression by causing\r\noverproduction, and point to the warehouses filled with goods that\r\ncannot be sold at remunerative prices, to mills closed or working on\r\nhalf time, to mines shut down and steamers laid up, to money lying idly\r\nin bank vaults, and workmen compelled to idleness and privation. They\r\npoint to these facts as showing that the production has exceeded the\r\ndemand for consumption, and they point, moreover, to the fact that when\r\ngovernment during war enters the field as an enormous consumer, brisk\r\ntimes prevail, as in the United States during the civil war and in\r\nEngland during the Napoleonic struggle.\r\n\r\nThe other school says that the speculation has produced the depression\r\nby leading to overconsumption, and point to full warehouses, rusting\r\nsteamers, closed mills, and idle workmen as evidences of a cessation of\r\neffective demand, which, they say, evidently results from the fact that\r\npeople, made extravagant by a fictitious prosperity, have lived beyond\r\ntheir means, and are now obliged to retrench—that is, to consume less\r\nwealth. They point, moreover, to the enormous consumption of wealth by\r\nwars, by the building of unremunerative railroads, by loans to bankrupt\r\ngovernments, etc., as extravagances which, though not felt at the time,\r\njust as the spendthrift does not at the moment feel the impairment of\r\nhis fortune, must now be made up by a season of reduced consumption.\r\n\r\nNow, each of these theories evidently expresses one side or phase of a\r\ngeneral truth, but each of them evidently fails to comprehend the full\r\ntruth. As an explanation of the phenomena, each is equally and utterly\r\npreposterous.\r\n\r\nFor while the great masses of men want more wealth than they can get,\r\nand while they are willing to give for it that which is the basis and\r\nraw material of wealth—their labor—how can there be overproduction? And\r\nwhile the machinery of production wastes and producers are condemned to\r\nunwilling idleness, how can there be overconsumption?\r\n\r\nWhen, with the desire to consume more, there co-exist the ability and\r\nwillingness to produce more, industrial and commercial paralysis cannot\r\nbe charged either to overproduction or to overconsumption. Manifestly,\r\nthe trouble is that production and consumption cannot meet and satisfy\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nHow does this inability arise? It is evidently and by common consent\r\nthe result of speculation. But of speculation in what?\r\n\r\nCertainly not of speculation in things which are the products of\r\nlabor—in agricultural or mineral productions, or manufactured goods,\r\nfor the effect of speculation in such things, as is well shown in\r\ncurrent treatises that spare me the necessity of illustration, is\r\nsimply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady the interplay\r\nof production and consumption by an action analogous to that of a\r\nfly-wheel in a machine.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if speculation be the cause of these industrial depressions,\r\nit must be speculation in things not the production of labor, but yet\r\nnecessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth—of\r\nthings of fixed quantity; that is to say, it must be speculation in\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThat land speculation is the true cause of industrial depression is,\r\nin the United States, clearly evident. In each period of industrial\r\nactivity land values have steadily risen, culminating in speculation\r\nwhich carried them up in great jumps. This has been invariably followed\r\nby a partial cessation of production, and its correlative, a cessation\r\nof effective demand (dull trade), generally accompanied by a commercial\r\ncrash; and then has succeeded a period of comparative stagnation,\r\nduring which the equilibrium has been again slowly established, and the\r\nsame round been run again. This relation is observable throughout the\r\ncivilized world. Periods of industrial activity always culminate in a\r\nspeculative advance of land values, followed by symptoms of checked\r\nproduction, generally shown at first by cessation of demand from the\r\nnewer countries, where the advance in land values has been greatest.\r\n\r\nThat this must be the main explanation of these periods of depression,\r\nwill be seen by an analysis of the facts.\r\n\r\nAll trade, let it be remembered, is the exchange of commodities for\r\ncommodities, and hence the cessation of demand for some commodities,\r\nwhich marks the depression of trade, is really a cessation in the\r\nsupply of other commodities. That dealers find their sales declining\r\nand manufacturers find orders falling off, while the things which they\r\nhave to sell, or stand ready to make, are things for which there is\r\nyet a widespread desire, simply shows that the supply of other things,\r\nwhich in the course of trade would be given for them, has declined. In\r\ncommon parlance we say that “buyers have no money,” or that “money is\r\nbecoming scarce,” but in talking in this way we ignore the fact that\r\nmoney is but the medium of exchange. What the would-be buyers really\r\nlack is not money, but commodities which they can turn into money—what\r\nis really becoming scarcer, is produce of some sort. The diminution\r\nof the effective demand of consumers is therefore but a result of the\r\ndiminution of production.\r\n\r\nThis is seen very clearly by storekeepers in a manufacturing town when\r\nthe mills are shut down and operatives thrown out of work. It is the\r\ncessation of production which deprives the operatives of means to make\r\nthe purchases they desire, and thus leaves the storekeeper with what,\r\nin view of the lessened demand, is a superabundant stock, and forces\r\nhim to discharge some of his clerks and otherwise reduce his demands.\r\nAnd the cessation of demand (I am speaking, of course, of general\r\ncases and not of any alteration in relative demand from such causes as\r\nchange of fashion), which has left the manufacturer with superabundant\r\nstock and compelled him to discharge his hands, must arise in the same\r\nway. Somewhere, it may be at the other end of the world, a check in\r\nproduction has produced a check in the demand for consumption. That\r\ndemand is lessened without want being satisfied, shows that production\r\nis somewhere checked.\r\n\r\nPeople want the things the manufacturer makes as much as ever, just\r\nas the operatives want the things the storekeeper has to sell. But\r\nthey do not have as much to give for them. Production has somewhere\r\nbeen checked, and this reduction in the supply of some things has\r\nshown itself in cessation of demand for others, the check propagating\r\nitself through the whole framework of industry and exchange. Now,\r\nthe industrial pyramid manifestly rests on the land. The primary and\r\nfundamental occupations, which create a demand for all others, are\r\nevidently those which extract wealth from nature, and, hence, if we\r\ntrace from one exchange point to another, and from one occupation to\r\nanother, this check to production, which shows itself in decreased\r\npurchasing power, we must ultimately find it in some obstacle which\r\nchecks labor in expending itself on land. And that obstacle, it is\r\nclear, is the speculative advance in rent, or the value of land, which\r\nproduces the same effects, as in fact, it is, a lock-out of labor and\r\ncapital by land owners. This check to production, beginning at the\r\nbasis of interlaced industry, propagates itself from exchange point to\r\nexchange point, cessation of supply becoming failure of demand, until,\r\nso to speak, the whole machine is thrown out of gear, and the spectacle\r\nis everywhere presented of labor going to waste while laborers suffer\r\nfrom want.\r\n\r\nThis strange and unnatural spectacle of large numbers of willing men\r\nwho cannot find employment is enough to suggest the true cause to\r\nwhomsoever can think consecutively. For, though custom has dulled us\r\nto it, it _is_ a strange and unnatural thing that men who wish to labor,\r\nin order to satisfy their wants, cannot find the opportunity—as, since\r\nlabor is that which produces wealth, the man who seeks to exchange\r\nlabor for food, clothing, or any other form of wealth, is like one who\r\nproposes to give bullion for coin, or wheat for flour. We talk about\r\nthe supply of labor and the demand for labor, but, evidently, these are\r\nonly relative terms. The supply of labor is everywhere the same—two\r\nhands always come into the world with one mouth, twenty-one boys to\r\nevery twenty girls; and the demand for labor must always exist as long\r\nas men want things which labor alone can procure. We talk about the\r\n“want of work,” but, evidently, it is not work that is short while want\r\ncontinues; evidently, the supply of labor cannot be too great, nor the\r\ndemand for labor too small, when people suffer for the lack of things\r\nthat labor produces. The real trouble must be that supply is somehow\r\nprevented from satisfying demand, that somewhere there is an obstacle\r\nwhich prevents labor from producing the things that laborers want.\r\n\r\nTake the case of any one of these vast masses of unemployed men, to\r\nwhom, though he never heard of Malthus, it to-day seems that there\r\nare too many people in the world. In his own wants, in the needs of\r\nhis anxious wife, in the demands of his half-cared-for, perhaps even\r\nhungry and shivering children, there is demand enough for labor, Heaven\r\nknows! In his own willing hands is the supply. Put him on a solitary\r\nisland, and though cut off from all the enormous advantages which the\r\nco-operation, combination, and machinery of a civilized community give\r\nto the productive powers of man, yet his two hands can fill the mouths\r\nand keep warm the backs that depend upon them. Yet where productive\r\npower is as its highest development they cannot. Why? Is it not because\r\nin the one case he has access to the material and forces of nature, and\r\nin the other this access is denied?\r\n\r\nIs it not the fact that labor is thus shut off from nature which can\r\nalone explain the state of things that compels men to stand idle who\r\nwould willingly supply their wants by their labor? The proximate cause\r\nof enforced idleness with one set of men may be the cessation of demand\r\non the part of other men for the particular things they produce, but\r\ntrace this cause from point to point, from occupation to occupation,\r\nand you will find that enforced idleness in one trade is caused by\r\nenforced idleness in another, and that the paralysis which produces\r\ndullness in all trades cannot be said to spring from too great a supply\r\nof labor or too small a demand for labor, but must proceed from the\r\nfact that supply cannot meet demand by producing the things which\r\nsatisfy want and are the object of labor.\r\n\r\nNow, what is necessary to enable labor to produce these things, is\r\nland. When we speak of labor creating wealth, we speak metaphorically.\r\nMan creates nothing. The whole human race, were they to labor forever,\r\ncould not create the tiniest mote that floats in a sunbeam—could not\r\nmake this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter. In\r\nproducing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural forces, but works up,\r\ninto the forms desired, pre-existing matter, and, to produce wealth,\r\nmust, therefore, have access to this matter and to these forces—that\r\nis to say, to land. The land is the source of all wealth. It is the\r\nmine from which must be drawn the ore that labor fashions. It is the\r\nsubstance to which labor gives the form. And, hence, when labor cannot\r\nsatisfy its wants, may we not with certainty infer that it can be from\r\nno other cause than that labor is denied access to land?\r\n\r\nWhen in all trades there is what we call scarcity of employment; when,\r\neverywhere, labor wastes, while desire is unsatisfied, must not the\r\nobstacle which prevents labor from producing the wealth it needs, lie\r\nat the foundation of the industrial structure? That foundation is land.\r\nMilliners, optical instrument makers, gilders, and polishers, are\r\nnot the pioneers of new settlements. Miners did not go to California\r\nor Australia because shoemakers, tailors, machinists, and printers\r\nwere there. But those trades followed the miners, just as they are\r\nnow following the gold diggers into the Black Hills and the diamond\r\ndiggers into South Africa. It is not the storekeeper who is the cause\r\nof the farmer, but the farmer who brings the storekeeper. It is not\r\nthe growth of the city that develops the country, but the development\r\nof the country that makes the city grow. And, hence, when, through\r\nall trades, men willing to work cannot find opportunity to do so, the\r\ndifficulty must arise in the employment that creates a demand for all\r\nother employments—it must be because labor is shut out from land.\r\n\r\nIn Leeds or Lowell, in Philadelphia or Manchester, in London or New\r\nYork, it may require a grasp of first principles to see this; but\r\nwhere industrial development has not become so elaborate, nor the\r\nextreme links of the chain so widely separated, one has but to look\r\nat obvious facts. Although not yet thirty years old, the city of San\r\nFrancisco, both in population and in commercial importance, ranks\r\namong the great cities of the world, and, next to New York, is the\r\nmost metropolitan of American cities. Though not yet thirty years old,\r\nshe has had for some years an increasing number of unemployed men.\r\nClearly, here, it is because men cannot find employment in the country\r\nthat there are so many unemployed in the city; for when the harvest\r\nopens they go trooping out, and when it is over they come trooping\r\nback to the city again. If these now unemployed men were producing\r\nwealth from the land, they would not only be employing themselves, but\r\nwould be employing all the mechanics of the city, giving custom to the\r\nstorekeepers, trade to the merchants, audiences to the theaters, and\r\nsubscribers and advertisements to the newspapers—creating effective\r\ndemand that would be felt in New England and Old England, and wherever\r\nthroughout the world come the articles that, when they have the means\r\nto pay for them, such a population consumes.\r\n\r\nNow, why is it that this unemployed labor cannot employ itself upon the\r\nland? Not that the land is all in use. Though all the symptoms that\r\nin older countries are taken as showing a redundancy of population\r\nare beginning to manifest themselves in San Francisco, it is idle to\r\ntalk of redundancy of population in a State that with greater natural\r\nresources than France has not yet a million of people. Within a few\r\nmiles of San Francisco is unused land enough to give employment to\r\nevery man who wants it. I do not mean to say that every unemployed man\r\ncould turn farmer or build himself a house, if he had the land; but\r\nthat enough could and would do so to give employment to the rest. What\r\nis it, then, that prevents labor from employing itself on this land?\r\nSimply, that it has been monopolized and is held at speculative prices,\r\nbased not upon present value, but upon the added value that will come\r\nwith the future growth of population.\r\n\r\nWhat may thus be seen in San Francisco by whoever is willing to see,\r\nmay, I doubt not, be seen as clearly in other places.\r\n\r\nThe present commercial and industrial depression, which first\r\nclearly manifested itself in the United States in 1872, and has\r\nspread with greater or less intensity over the civilized world, is\r\nlargely attributed to the undue extension of the railroad system,\r\nwith which there are many things that seem to show its relation. I\r\nam fully conscious that the construction of railroads before they\r\nare actually needed may divert capital and labor from more to less\r\nproductive employments, and make a community poorer instead of richer;\r\nand when the railroad mania was at its highest, I pointed this out\r\nin a political tract addressed to the people of California;[40] but\r\nto assign to this wasting of capital such a widespread industrial\r\ndead-lock seems to me like attributing an unusually low tide to the\r\ndrawing of a few extra bucketfuls of water. The waste of capital\r\nand labor during the civil war was enormously greater than it could\r\npossibly be by the construction of unnecessary railroads, but without\r\nproducing any such result. And, certainly, there seems to be little\r\nsense in talking of the waste of capital and labor in railroads as\r\ncausing this depression, when the prominent feature of the depression\r\nhas been the superabundance of capital and labor seeking employment.\r\n\r\nYet, that there is a connection between the rapid construction of\r\nrailroads and industrial depression, any one who understands what\r\nincreased land values mean, and who has noticed the effect which the\r\nconstruction of railroads has upon land speculation, can easily see.\r\nWherever a railroad was built or projected, lands sprang up in value\r\nunder the influence of speculation, and thousands of millions of\r\ndollars were added to the nominal values which capital and labor were\r\nasked to pay outright, or to pay in installments, as the price of being\r\nallowed to go to work and produce wealth. The inevitable result was to\r\ncheck production, and this check to production propagated itself in a\r\ncessation of demand, which checked production to the furthest verge of\r\nthe wide circle of exchanges, operating with accumulated force in the\r\ncenters of the great industrial commonwealth into which commerce links\r\nthe civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe primary operations of this cause can, perhaps, be nowhere more\r\nclearly traced than in California, which, from its comparative\r\nisolation, has constituted a peculiarly well-defined community.\r\n\r\nUntil almost its close, the last decade was marked in California by\r\nthe same industrial activity which was shown in the Northern States,\r\nand, in fact, throughout the civilized world, when the interruption of\r\nexchanges and the disarrangement of industry caused by the war and the\r\nblockade of Southern ports is considered. This activity could not be\r\nattributed to inflation of the currency or to lavish expenditures of\r\nthe General Government, to which in the Eastern States the comparative\r\nactivity of the same period has since been attributed; for, in spite\r\nof legal tender laws, the Pacific Coast adhered to a coin currency,\r\nand the taxation of the Federal Government took away very much more\r\nthan was returned in Federal expenditures. It was attributable solely\r\nto normal causes, for, though placer mining was declining, the Nevada\r\nsilver mines were being opened, wheat and wool were beginning to take\r\nthe place of gold in the table of exports, and an increasing population\r\nand the improvement in the methods of production and exchange were\r\nsteadily adding to the efficiency of labor.\r\n\r\nWith this material progress went on a steady enhancement in land\r\nvalues—its consequence. This steady advance engendered a speculative\r\nadvance, which, with the railroad era, ran up land values in every\r\ndirection. If the population of California had steadily grown when\r\nthe long, costly, fever-haunted Isthmus route was the principal mode\r\nof communication with the Atlantic States, it must, it was thought,\r\nincrease enormously with the opening of a road which would bring New\r\nYork harbor and San Francisco Bay within seven days’ easy travel, and\r\nwhen in the State itself the locomotive took the place of stage coach\r\nand freight wagon. The expected increase of land values which would\r\nthus accrue was discounted in advance. Lots on the outskirts of San\r\nFrancisco rose hundreds and thousands per cent., and farming land was\r\ntaken up and held for high prices, in whichever direction an immigrant\r\nwas likely to go.\r\n\r\nBut the anticipated rush of immigrants did not take place. Labor\r\nand capital could not pay so much for land and make fair returns.\r\nProduction was checked, if not absolutely, at least relatively. As the\r\ntranscontinental railroad approached completion, instead of increased\r\nactivity symptoms of depression began to manifest themselves; and, when\r\nit was completed, to the season of activity had succeeded a period\r\nof depression which has not since been fully recovered from, during\r\nwhich wages and interest have steadily fallen. What I have called the\r\nactual rent line, or margin of cultivation, is thus (as well as by the\r\nsteady march of improvement and increase of population, which, though\r\nslower than it otherwise would have been, still goes on) approaching\r\nthe speculative rent line, but the tenacity with which a speculative\r\nadvance in the price of land is maintained in a developing community is\r\nwell known.[41]\r\n\r\nNow, what thus went on in California went on in every progressive\r\nsection of the Union. Everywhere that a railroad was built or\r\nprojected, land was monopolized in anticipation, and the benefit of the\r\nimprovement was discounted in increased land values. The speculative\r\nadvance in rent thus outrunning the normal advance, production was\r\nchecked, demand was decreased, and labor and capital were turned back\r\nfrom occupations more directly concerned with land, to glut those in\r\nwhich the value of land is a less perceptible element. It is thus\r\nthat the rapid extension of railroads is related to the succeeding\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nAnd what went on in the United States went on in a greater or less\r\nobvious degree all over the progressive world. Everywhere land values\r\nhave been steadily increasing with material progress, and everywhere\r\nthis increase begot a speculative advance. The impulse of the primary\r\ncause not only radiated from the newer sections of the Union to the\r\nolder sections, and from the United States to Europe, but everywhere\r\nthe primary cause was acting. And, hence, a world-wide depression of\r\nindustry and commerce, begotten of a world-wide material progress.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which, it may seem, I have overlooked, in\r\nattributing these industrial depressions to the speculative advance\r\nof rent or land values as a main and primary cause. The operation of\r\nsuch a cause, though it may be rapid, must be progressive—resembling\r\na pressure, not a blow. But these industrial depressions seem to come\r\nsuddenly—they have, at their beginning, the character of a paroxysm,\r\nfollowed by a comparative lethargy, as if of exhaustion. Everything\r\nseems to be going on as usual, commerce and industry vigorous and\r\nexpanding, when suddenly there comes a shock, as of a thunderbolt\r\nout of a clear sky—a bank breaks, a great manufacturer or merchant\r\nfails, and, as if a blow had thrilled through the entire industrial\r\norganization, failure succeeds failure, and on every side workmen\r\nare discharged from employment, and capital shrinks into profitless\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nLet me explain what I think to be the reason of this: To do so, we\r\nmust take into account the manner in which exchanges are made, for\r\nit is by exchanges that all the varied forms of industry are linked\r\ntogether into one mutually related and interdependent organization. To\r\nenable exchanges to be made between producers far removed by space and\r\ntime, large stocks must be kept in store and in transit, and this, as\r\nI have already explained, I take to be the great function of capital,\r\nin addition to that of supplying tools and seed. These exchanges are,\r\nperhaps necessarily, largely made upon credit—that is to say, the\r\nadvance upon one side is made before the return is received on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nNow, without stopping to inquire as to the causes, it is manifest that\r\nthese advances are, as a rule, from the more highly organized and\r\nlater developed industries to the more fundamental. The West Coast\r\nAfrican, for instance, who exchanges palm oil and cocoanuts for gaudy\r\ncalico and Birmingham idols, gets his return immediately; the English\r\nmerchant, on the contrary, has to lay out of his goods a long while\r\nbefore he gets his returns. The farmer can sell his crop as soon as it\r\nis harvested, and for cash; the great manufacturer must keep a large\r\nstock, send his goods long distances to agents, and, generally, sell on\r\ntime. Thus, as advances and credits are generally from what we may call\r\nthe secondary, to what we may call the primary industries, it follows\r\nthat any check to production which proceeds from the latter will not\r\nimmediately manifest itself in the former. The system of advances and\r\ncredits constitutes, as it were, an elastic connection, which will give\r\nconsiderably before breaking, but which, when it breaks, will break\r\nwith a snap.\r\n\r\nOr, to illustrate in another way what I mean: The great pyramid of\r\nGizeh is composed of layers of masonry, the bottom layer, of course,\r\nsupporting all the rest. Could we by some means gradually contract\r\nthis bottom layer, the upper part of the pyramid would for some\r\ntime retain its form, and then, when gravitation at length overcame\r\nthe adhesiveness of the material, would not diminish gradually and\r\nregularly, but would break off suddenly, in large pieces. Now, the\r\nindustrial organization may be likened to such a pyramid. What is the\r\nproportion which in a given stage of social development the various\r\nindustries bear to each other, it is difficult, and perhaps impossible,\r\nto say; but it is obvious that there is such a proportion, just as\r\nin a printer’s font of type there is a certain proportion between\r\nthe various letters. Each form of industry, as it is developed by\r\ndivision of labor, springs from and rises out of the others, and all\r\nrest ultimately upon land; for, without land, labor is as impotent\r\nas would be a man in void space. To make the illustration closer to\r\nthe condition of a progressive country, imagine a pyramid composed\r\nof superimposed layers—the whole constantly growing and expanding.\r\nImagine the growth of the layer nearest the ground to be checked. The\r\nothers will for a time keep on expanding—in fact, for the moment, the\r\ntendency will be to quicker expansion, for the vital force which is\r\nrefused scope on the ground layer will strive to find vent in those\r\nabove—until, at length, there is a decided overbalance and a sudden\r\ncrumbling along all the faces of the pyramid.\r\n\r\nThat the main cause and general course of the recurring paroxysms of\r\nindustrial depression, which are becoming so marked a feature of modern\r\nsocial life, are thus explained, is, I think, clear. And let the reader\r\nremember that it is only the main causes and general courses of such\r\nphenomena that we are seeking to trace or that, in fact, it is possible\r\nto trace with any exactness. Political economy can deal, and has need\r\nto deal, only with general tendencies. The derivative forces are so\r\nmultiform, the actions and reactions are so various, that the exact\r\ncharacter of the phenomena cannot be predicted. We know that if a tree\r\nis cut through it will fall, but precisely in what direction will be\r\ndetermined by the inclination of the trunk, the spread of the branches,\r\nthe impact of the blows, the quarter and force of the wind; and even a\r\nbird lighting on a twig, or a frightened squirrel leaping from bough\r\nto bough, will not be without its influence. We know that an insult\r\nwill arouse a feeling of resentment in the human breast, but to say how\r\nfar and in what way it will manifest itself, would require a synthesis\r\nwhich would build up the entire man and all his surroundings, past and\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the sufficient cause to which I have traced\r\nthem explains the main features of these industrial depressions is\r\nin striking contrast with the contradictory and self-contradictory\r\nattempts which have been made to explain them on the current theories\r\nof the distribution of wealth. That a speculative advance in rent or\r\nland values invariably precedes each of these sea sons of industrial\r\ndepression is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the\r\nrelations of cause and effect, is obvious to whomsoever considers the\r\nnecessary relations between land and labor.\r\n\r\nAnd that the present depression is running its course, and that, in the\r\nmanner previously indicated, a new equilibrium is being established,\r\nwhich will result in another season of comparative activity, may\r\nalready be seen in the United States. The normal rent line and the\r\nspeculative rent line are being brought together: (1) By the fall in\r\nspeculative land values, which is very evident in the reduction of\r\nrents and shrinkage of real estate values in the principal cities.\r\n(2) By the increased efficiency of labor, arising from the growth of\r\npopulation and the utilization of new inventions and discoveries,\r\nsome of which almost as important as that of the use of steam we seem\r\nto be on the verge of grasping. (3) By the lowering of the habitual\r\nstandard of interest and wages, which, as to interest, is shown by the\r\nnegotiation of a government loan at four per cent., and as to wages is\r\ntoo generally evident for any special citation. When the equilibrium\r\nis thus re-established, a season of renewed activity, culminating in\r\na speculative advance of land values will set in.[42] But wages and\r\ninterest will not recover their lost ground. The net result of all\r\nthese perturbations or wave-like movements is the gradual forcing of\r\nwages and interest toward their minimum. These temporary and recurring\r\ndepressions exhibit, in fact, as was noticed in the opening chapter,\r\nbut intensifications of the general movement which accompanies material\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] The Subsidy Question and the Democratic Party, 1871.\r\n\r\n[41] It is astonishing how in a new country of great expectations\r\nspeculative prices of land will be kept up. It is common to hear the\r\nexpression, “There is no market for real estate; you cannot sell it at\r\nany price,” and yet, at the same time, if you go to buy it, unless you\r\nfind somebody who is absolutely compelled to sell, you must pay the\r\nprices that prevailed when speculation ran high. For owners, believing\r\nthat land values must ultimately advance, hold on as long as they can.\r\n\r\n[42] This was written a year ago. It is now (July, 1879) evident that\r\na new period of activity has commenced, as above predicted, and in New\r\nYork and Chicago real estate prices have already begun to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PERSISTENCE OF POVERTY AMID ADVANCING WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great problem, of which these recurring seasons of industrial\r\ndepression are but peculiar manifestations, is now, I think, fully\r\nsolved, and the social phenomena which all over the civilized world\r\nappall the philanthropist and perplex the statesman, which hang with\r\nclouds the future of the most advanced races, and suggest doubts of the\r\nreality and ultimate goal of what we have fondly called progress, are\r\nnow explained.\r\n\r\n _The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages\r\n constantly tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is\r\n that, with increase in productive power, rent tends to even greater\r\n increase, thus producing a constant tendency to the forcing down of\r\n wages._\r\n\r\nIn every direction, the direct tendency of advancing civilization\r\nis to increase the power of human labor to satisfy human desires—to\r\nextirpate poverty, and to banish want and the fear of want. All the\r\nthings in which progress consists, all the conditions which progressive\r\ncommunities are striving for, have for their direct and natural result\r\nthe improvement of the material (and consequently the intellectual\r\nand moral) condition of all within their influence. The growth of\r\npopulation, the increase and extension of exchanges, the discoveries\r\nof science, the march of invention, the spread of education, the\r\nimprovement of government, and the amelioration of manners, considered\r\nas material forces, have all a direct tendency to increase the\r\nproductive power of labor—not of some labor, but of all labor; not in\r\nsome departments of industry, but in all departments of industry; for\r\nthe law of the production of wealth in society is the law of “each for\r\nall, and all for each.”\r\n\r\nBut labor cannot reap the benefits which advancing civilization\r\nthus brings, because they are intercepted. Land being necessary to\r\nlabor, and being reduced to private ownership, every increase in the\r\nproductive power of labor but increases rent—the price that labor\r\nmust pay for the opportunity to utilize its powers; and thus all the\r\nadvantages gained by the march of progress go to the owners of land,\r\nand wages do not increase. Wages cannot increase; for the greater the\r\nearnings of labor the greater the price that labor must pay out of its\r\nearnings for the opportunity to make any earnings at all. The mere\r\nlaborer has thus no more interest in the general advance of productive\r\npower than the Cuban slave has in advance in the price of sugar. And\r\njust as an advance in the price of sugar may make the condition of the\r\nslave worse, by inducing the master to drive him harder, so may the\r\ncondition of the free laborer be positively, as well as relatively,\r\nchanged for the worse by the increase in the productive power of his\r\nlabor. For, begotten of the continuous advance of rents, arises a\r\nspeculative tendency which discounts the effect of future improvements\r\nby a still further advance of rent, and thus tends, where this has not\r\noccurred from the normal advance of rent, to drive wages down to the\r\nslave point—the point at which the laborer can just live.\r\n\r\nAnd thus robbed of all the benefits of the increase in productive\r\npower, labor is exposed to certain effects of advancing civilization\r\nwhich, without the advantages that naturally accompany them, are\r\npositive evils, and of themselves tend to reduce the free laborer to\r\nthe helpless and degraded condition of the slave.\r\n\r\nFor all improvements which add to productive power as civilization\r\nadvances consist in, or necessitate, a still further subdivision of\r\nlabor, and the efficiency of the whole body of laborers is increased\r\nat the expense of the independence of the constituents. The individual\r\nlaborer acquires knowledge of and skill in but an infinitesimal part of\r\nthe varied processes which are required to supply even the commonest\r\nwants. The aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small,\r\nbut each member is capable of an independent life. He can build his\r\nown habitation, hew out or stitch together his own canoe, make his own\r\nclothing, manufacture his own weapons, snares, tools and ornaments.\r\nHe has all the knowledge of nature possessed by his tribe—knows what\r\nvegetable productions are fit for food, and where they may be found;\r\nknows the habits and resorts of beasts, birds, fishes, and insects;\r\ncan pilot himself by the sun or the stars, by the turning of blossoms\r\nor the mosses on the trees; is, in short, capable of supplying all his\r\nwants. He may be cut off from his fellows and still live; and thus\r\npossesses an independent power which makes him a free contracting party\r\nin his relations to the community of which he is a member.\r\n\r\nCompare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized\r\nsociety, whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener\r\nbut the infinitesimal part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of\r\nthings that constitute the wealth of society and go to supply even the\r\nmost primitive wants; who not only cannot make even the tools required\r\nfor his work, but often works with tools that he does not own, and can\r\nnever hope to own. Compelled to even closer and more continuous labor\r\nthan the savage, and gaining by it no more than the savage gets—the\r\nmere necessaries of life—he loses the independence of the savage. He\r\nis not only unable to apply his own powers to the direct satisfaction\r\nof his own wants, but, without the concurrence of many others, he is\r\nunable to apply them indirectly to the satisfaction of his wants. He is\r\na mere link in an enormous chain of producers and consumers, helpless\r\nto separate himself, and helpless to move, except as they move. The\r\nworse his position in society, the more dependent is he on society; the\r\nmore utterly unable does he become to do anything for himself. The very\r\npower of exerting his labor for the satisfaction of his wants passes\r\nfrom his own control, and may be taken away or restored by the actions\r\nof others, or by general causes over which he has no more influence\r\nthan he has over the motions of the solar system. The primeval curse\r\ncomes to be looked upon as a boon, and men think, and talk, and clamor,\r\nand legislate as though monotonous manual labor in itself were a good\r\nand not an evil, an end and not a means. Under such circumstances,\r\nthe man loses the essential quality of manhood—the godlike power of\r\nmodifying and controlling conditions. He becomes a slave, a machine, a\r\ncommodity—a thing, in some respects, lower than the animal.\r\n\r\nI am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas\r\nof the untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand,\r\nor Cooper. I am conscious of its material and mental poverty, and\r\nits low and narrow range. I believe that civilization is not only\r\nthe natural destiny of man, but the enfranchisement, elevation, and\r\nrefinement of all his powers, and think that it is only in such moods\r\nas may lead him to envy the cud-chewing cattle, that a man who is free\r\nto the advantages of civilization could look with regret upon the\r\nsavage state. But, nevertheless, I think no one who will open his eyes\r\nto the facts can resist the conclusion that there are in the heart of\r\nour civilization large classes with whom the veriest savage could not\r\nafford to exchange. It is my deliberate opinion that if, standing on\r\nthe threshold of being, one were given the choice of entering life as\r\na Tierra del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux in the\r\nArctic Circle, or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized\r\ncountry as Great Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in\r\nselecting the lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of\r\nwealth are condemned to want suffer all the privations of the savage,\r\nwithout his sense of personal freedom; they are condemned to more than\r\nhis narrowness and littleness, without opportunity for the growth\r\nof his rude virtues; if their horizon is wider, it is but to reveal\r\nblessings that they cannot enjoy.\r\n\r\nThere are some to whom this may seem like exaggeration, but it is\r\nonly because they have never suffered themselves to realize the\r\ntrue condition of those classes upon whom the iron heel of modern\r\ncivilization presses with full force. As De Tocqueville observes, in\r\none of his letters to Mme. Swetchine, “we so soon become used to the\r\nthought of want that we do not feel that an evil which grows greater\r\nto the sufferer the longer it lasts becomes less to the observer by\r\nthe very fact of its duration;” and perhaps the best proof of the\r\njustice of this observation is that in cities where there exists a\r\npauper class and a criminal class, where young girls shiver as they\r\nsew for bread, and tattered and barefooted children make a home in\r\nthe streets, money is regularly raised to send missionaries to the\r\nheathen! Send missionaries to the heathen! it would be laughable if it\r\nwere not so sad. Baal no longer stretches forth his hideous, sloping\r\narms; but in Christian lands mothers slay their infants for a burial\r\nfee! And I challenge the production from any authentic accounts of\r\nsavage life of such descriptions of degradation as are to be found in\r\nofficial documents of highly civilized countries—in reports of Sanitary\r\nCommissioners and of inquiries into the condition of the laboring poor.\r\n\r\nThe simple theory which I have outlined (if indeed it can be called\r\na theory which is but the recognition of the most obvious relations)\r\nexplains this conjunction of poverty with wealth, of low wages with\r\nhigh productive power, of degradation amid enlightenment, of virtual\r\nslavery in political liberty. It harmonizes, as results flowing from\r\na general and inexorable law, facts otherwise most perplexing, and\r\nexhibits the sequence and relation between phenomena that without\r\nreference to it are diverse and contradictory. It explains why interest\r\nand wages are higher in new than in older communities, though the\r\naverage, as well as the aggregate, production of wealth is less. It\r\nexplains why improvements which increase the productive power of\r\nlabor and capital increase the reward of neither. It explains what is\r\ncommonly called the conflict between labor and capital, while proving\r\nthe real harmony of interest between them. It cuts the last inch of\r\nground from under the fallacies of protection, while showing why free\r\ntrade fails to benefit permanently the working classes. It explains why\r\nwant increases with abundance, and wealth tends to greater and greater\r\naggregations. It explains the periodically recurring depressions of\r\nindustry without recourse either to the absurdity of “overproduction”\r\nor the absurdity of “overconsumption.” It explains the enforced\r\nidleness of large numbers of would-be producers, which wastes the\r\nproductive force of advanced communities, without the absurd assumption\r\nthat there is too little work to do or that there are too many to do\r\nit. It explains the ill effects upon the laboring classes which often\r\nfollow the introduction of machinery, without denying the natural\r\nadvantages which the use of machinery gives. It explains the vice and\r\nmisery which show themselves amid dense population, without attributing\r\nto the laws of the All-Wise and All-Beneficent defects which belong\r\nonly to the short-sighted and selfish enactments of men.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is in accordance with all the facts.\r\n\r\nLook over the world to-day. In countries the most widely\r\ndiffering—under conditions the most diverse as to government, as to\r\nindustries, as to tariffs, as to currency—you will find distress among\r\nthe working classes; but everywhere that you thus find distress and\r\ndestitution in the midst of wealth you will find that the land is\r\nmonopolized; that instead of being treated as the common property of\r\nthe whole people, it is treated as the private property of individuals;\r\nthat, for its use by labor, large revenues are extorted from the\r\nearnings of labor. Look over the world to-day, comparing different\r\ncountries with each other, and you will see that it is not the\r\nabundance of capital or the productiveness of labor that makes wages\r\nhigh or low; but the extent to which the monopolizers of land can, in\r\nrent, levy tribute upon the earnings of labor. Is it not a notorious\r\nfact, known to the most ignorant, that new countries, where the\r\naggregate wealth is small, but where land is cheap, are always better\r\ncountries for the laboring classes than the rich countries, where land\r\nis dear? Wherever you find land relatively low, will you not find\r\nwages relatively high? And wherever land is high, will you not find\r\nwages low? As land increases in value, poverty deepens and pauperism\r\nappears. In the new settlements, where land is cheap, you will find\r\nno beggars, and the inequalities in condition are very slight. In the\r\ngreat cities, where land is so valuable that it is measured by the\r\nfoot, you will find the extremes of poverty and of luxury. And this\r\ndisparity in condition between the two extremes of the social scale\r\nmay always be measured by the price of land. Land in New York is more\r\nvaluable than in San Francisco; and in New York, the San Franciscan may\r\nsee squalor and misery that will make him stand aghast. Land is more\r\nvaluable in London than in New York; and in London, there is squalor\r\nand destitution worse than that of New York.\r\n\r\nCompare the same country in different times, and the same relation\r\nis obvious. As the result of much investigation, Hallam says he is\r\nconvinced that the wages of manual labor were greater in amount in\r\nEngland during the middle ages than they are now. Whether this is so\r\nor not, it is evident that they could not have been much, if any,\r\nless. The enormous increase in the efficiency of labor, which even\r\nin agriculture is estimated at seven or eight hundred per cent., and\r\nin many branches of industry is almost incalculable, has only added\r\nto rent. The rent of agricultural land in England is now, according\r\nto Professor Rogers, 120 times as great, measured in money, as it\r\nwas 500 years ago, and 14 times as great, measured in wheat; while\r\nin the rent of building land, and mineral land, the advance has been\r\nenormously greater. According to the estimate of Professor Fawcett,\r\nthe capitalized rental value of the land of England now amounts to\r\n£4,500,000,000, or $21,870,000,000—that is to say, a few thousand of\r\nthe people of England hold a lien upon the labor of the rest, the\r\ncapitalized value of which is more than twice as great as, at the\r\naverage price of Southern negroes in 1860 would be the value of her\r\nwhole population were they slaves.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium and Flanders, in France and Germany, the rent and selling\r\nprice of agricultural land have doubled within the last thirty\r\nyears.[43] In short, increased power of production has everywhere added\r\nto the value of land; nowhere has it added to the value of labor; for\r\nthough actual wages may in some places have somewhat risen, the rise\r\nis clearly attributable to other causes. In more places they have\r\nfallen—that is, where it has been possible for them to fall—for there\r\nis a minimum below which laborers cannot keep up their numbers. And,\r\neverywhere, wages, as a proportion of the produce, have decreased.\r\n\r\nHow the Black Death brought about the great rise of wages in England in\r\nthe Fourteenth Century is clearly discernible, in the efforts of the\r\nland holders to regulate wages by statute. That that awful reduction in\r\npopulation, instead of increasing, really reduced the effective power\r\nof labor, there can be no doubt; but the lessening of competition for\r\nland still more greatly reduced rent, and wages advanced so largely\r\nthat force and penal laws were called in to keep them down. The reverse\r\neffect followed the monopolization of land that went on in England\r\nduring the reign of Henry VIII., in the inclosure of commons and the\r\ndivision of the church lands between the panders and parasites who were\r\nthus enabled to found noble families. The result was the same as that\r\nto which a speculative increase in land values tends. According to\r\nMalthus (who, in his “Principles of Political Economy,” mentions the\r\nfact without connecting it with land tenures), in the reign of Henry\r\nVII., half a bushel of wheat would purchase but little more than a\r\nday’s common labor, but in the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nhalf a bushel of wheat would purchase three days’ common labor. I can\r\nhardly believe that the reduction in wages could have been so great\r\nas this comparison would indicate; but that there was a reduction in\r\ncommon wages, and great distress among the laboring classes, is evident\r\nfrom the complaints of “sturdy vagrants” and the statutes made to\r\nsuppress them. The rapid monopolization of the land, the carrying of\r\nthe speculative rent line beyond the normal rent line, produced tramps\r\nand paupers, just as like effects from like causes have lately been\r\nevident in the United States.\r\n\r\n“Land which went heretofore for twenty or forty pounds a year,” said\r\nHugh Latimer, “now is let for fifty or a hundred. My father was a\r\nyeoman, and had no lands of his own; only he had a farm at a rent of\r\nthree or four pounds by the year at the uttermost, and thereupon he\r\ntilled so much as kept half a dozen men. He had walk for a hundred\r\nsheep, and my mother milked thirty kine; he was able and did find the\r\nKing a harness with himself and his horse when he came to the place\r\nthat he should receive the King’s wages. I can remember that I buckled\r\nhis harness when he went to Blackheath Field. He kept me to school; he\r\nmarried my sisters with five pound apiece, so that he brought them up\r\nin godliness and fear of God. He kept hospitality for his neighbors and\r\nsome alms he gave to the poor. And all this he did of the same farm,\r\nwhere he that now hath it payeth sixteen pounds rent or more by year,\r\nand is not able to do anything for his Prince, for himself, nor for his\r\nchildren, nor to give a cup of drink to the poor.”\r\n\r\n“In this way,” said Sir Thomas More, referring to the ejectment of\r\nsmall farmers which characterized this advance of rent, “it comes to\r\npass that these poor wretches, men, women, husbands, orphans, widows,\r\nparents with little children, householders greater in number than in\r\nwealth, all of these emigrate from their native fields, without knowing\r\nwhere to go.”\r\n\r\nAnd so from the stuff of the Latimers and Mores—from the sturdy spirit\r\nthat amid the flames of the Oxford stake cried, “Play the man, Master\r\nRidley!” and the mingled strength and sweetness that neither prosperity\r\ncould taint nor the ax of the executioner abash—were evolved thieves\r\nand vagrants, the mass of criminality and pauperism that still blights\r\nthe innermost petals and preys a gnawing worm at the root of England’s\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nBut it were as well to cite historical illustrations of the attraction\r\nof gravitation. The principle is as universal and as obvious. That rent\r\n_must_ reduce wages, is as clear as that the greater the subtractor the\r\nless the remainder. That rent _does_ reduce wages, any one, wherever\r\nsituated, can see by merely looking around him.\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery as to the cause which so suddenly and so largely\r\nraised wages in California in 1849, and in Australia in 1852. It was\r\nthe discovery of the placer mines in unappropriated land to which labor\r\nwas free that raised the wages of cooks in San Francisco restaurants to\r\n$500 a month, and left ships to rot in the harbor without officers or\r\ncrew until their owners would consent to pay rates that in any other\r\npart of the globe seemed fabulous. Had these mines been on appropriated\r\nland, or had they been immediately monopolized so that rent could have\r\narisen, it would have been land values that would have leaped upward,\r\nnot wages. The Comstock lode has been richer than the placers, but the\r\nComstock lode was readily monopolized, and it is only by virtue of the\r\nstrong organization of the Miners’ Association and the fears of the\r\ndamage which it might do, that enables men to get four dollars a day\r\nfor parboiling themselves two thousand feet underground, where the\r\nair that they breathe must be pumped down to them. The wealth of the\r\nComstock lode has added to rent. The selling price of these mines runs\r\nup into hundreds of millions, and it has produced individual fortunes\r\nwhose monthly returns can be estimated only in hundreds of thousands,\r\nif not in millions. Nor is there any mystery about the cause which has\r\noperated to reduce wages in California from the maximum of the early\r\ndays to very nearly a level with wages in the Eastern States, and that\r\nis still operating to reduce them. The productiveness of labor has not\r\ndecreased, on the contrary it has increased, as I have before shown;\r\nbut, out of what it produces labor has now to pay rent. As the placer\r\ndeposits were exhausted, labor had to resort to the deeper mines and to\r\nagricultural land, but monopolization of these being permitted, men\r\nnow walk the streets of San Francisco ready to go to work for almost\r\nanything—for natural opportunities are now no longer free to labor.\r\n\r\nThe truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive\r\nthought this question:\r\n\r\n“Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German\r\nOcean a No-man’s land on which common labor to an unlimited amount\r\nshould be able to make ten shillings a day and which should remain\r\nunappropriated and of free access, like the commons which once\r\ncomprised so large a part of English soil. What would be the effect\r\nupon wages in England?”\r\n\r\nHe would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must\r\nsoon increase to ten shillings a day.\r\n\r\nAnd in response to another question, “What would be the effect\r\non rents?” he would at a moment’s reflection say that rents must\r\nnecessarily fall; and if he thought out the next step he would tell\r\nyou that all this would happen without any very large part of English\r\nlabor being diverted to the new natural opportunities, or the forms and\r\ndirection of industry being much changed; only that kind of production\r\nbeing abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together less\r\nthan labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in\r\nwages would be at the expense of rent.\r\n\r\nTake now the same man or another—some hard-headed business man, who has\r\nno theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: “Here is a little\r\nvillage; in ten years it will be a great city—in ten years the railroad\r\nwill have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the\r\ncandle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so\r\nenormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years,\r\ninterest be any higher?”\r\n\r\nHe will tell you, “No!”\r\n\r\n“Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for a\r\nman who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?”\r\n\r\nHe will tell you, “No; the wages of common labor will not be any\r\nhigher; on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower;\r\nit will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent\r\nliving; the chances are that it will be harder.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, will be higher?”\r\n\r\n“Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold\r\npossession.”\r\n\r\nAnd if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do\r\nnothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around\r\nlike the lazzaroni of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in\r\na balloon, or down a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke\r\nof work, without adding one iota to the wealth of the community, in\r\nten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious\r\nmansion; but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.\r\n\r\nIn all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple\r\ntruth: That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the\r\nproduction of wealth, to command the land which is necessary to labor,\r\nis to command all the fruits of labor save enough to enable labor\r\nto exist. We have been advancing as through an enemy’s country, in\r\nwhich every step must be secured, every position fortified, and every\r\nby-path explored; for this simple truth, in its application to social\r\nand political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly by\r\nits very simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and\r\nerroneous habits of thought which lead them to look in every direction\r\nbut the right one for an explanation of the evils which oppress and\r\nthreaten the civilized world. And back of these elaborate fallacies and\r\nmisleading theories is an active, energetic power, a power that in\r\nevery country, be its political forms what they may, writes laws and\r\nmolds thought—the power of a vast and dominant pecuniary interest.\r\n\r\nBut so simple and so clear is this truth, that to see it fully once\r\nis always to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked at\r\nagain and again, present only a confused labyrinth of lines or scroll\r\nwork—a landscape, trees, or something of the kind—until once the\r\nattention is called to the fact that these things make up a face or a\r\nfigure. This relation once recognized, is always afterward clear. It\r\nis so in this case. In the light of this truth all social facts group\r\nthemselves in an orderly relation, and the most diverse phenomena are\r\nseen to spring from one great principle. It is not in the relations\r\nof capital and labor; it is not in the pressure of population against\r\nsubsistence, that an explanation of the unequaled development of our\r\ncivilization is to be found. The great cause of inequality in the\r\ndistribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The\r\nownership of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately\r\ndetermines the social, the political, and consequently the intellectual\r\nand moral condition of a people. And it must be so. For land is the\r\nhabitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw for all his\r\nneeds, the material to which his labor must be applied for the supply\r\nof all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,\r\nthe light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,\r\nwithout the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from\r\nit we live, to it we return again—children of the soil as truly as is\r\nthe blade of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all\r\nthat belongs to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material\r\nprogress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add\r\nto the power of producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is\r\nmonopolized, it might go on to infinity without increasing wages or\r\nimproving the condition of those who have but their labor. It can but\r\nadd to the value of land and the power which its possession gives.\r\nEverywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is\r\nthe base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source\r\nof power. As said the Brahmins, ages ago—\r\n\r\n “_To whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belong the fruits\r\n of it. White parasols and elephants mad with pride are the flowers of\r\n a grant of land._”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] Systems of Land Tenure, published by the Cobden Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n This Memorial Edition of the Writings of Henry George is limited to\r\n one thousand numbered copies, of which this is\r\n\r\n No. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  MEMORIAL EDITION\r\n  OF THE WRITINGS\r\n  OF HENRY GEORGE\r\n\r\n  VOL.

The remedy to\r\nwhich our conclusions point is at once radical and simple—so radical\r\nthat, on the one side, it will not be fairly considered so long as\r\nany faith remains in the efficacy of less caustic measures; so simple\r\nthat, on the other side, its real efficacy and comprehensiveness are\r\nlikely to be overlooked, until the effect of more elaborate measures is\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies and measures which current literature and discussions\r\nshow to be more or less relied on or advocated as calculated to relieve\r\npoverty and distress among the masses may be divided into six classes.\r\nI do not mean that there are so many distinct parties or schools of\r\nthought, but merely that, for the purpose of our inquiry, prevailing\r\nopinions and proposed measures may be so grouped for review. Remedies\r\nwhich for the sake of greater convenience and clearness we shall\r\nconsider separately are often combined in thought.\r\n\r\nThere are many persons who still retain a comfortable belief that\r\nmaterial progress will ultimately extirpate poverty, and there are many\r\nwho look to prudential restraint upon the increase of population as the\r\nmost efficacious means, but the fallacy of these views has already\r\nbeen sufficiently shown. Let us now consider what may be hoped for:\r\n\r\nI. From greater economy in government.\r\n\r\nII. From the better education of the working classes and improved\r\nhabits of industry and thrift.\r\n\r\nIII. From combinations of workmen for the advance of wages.\r\n\r\nIV. From the co-operation of labor and capital.\r\n\r\nV. From governmental direction and interference.\r\n\r\nVI. From a more general distribution of land.\r\n\r\nUnder these six heads I think we may in essential form review all hopes\r\nand propositions for the relief of social distress short of the simple\r\nbut far-reaching measure which I shall propose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.—From Greater Economy in Government._\r\n\r\nUntil a very few years ago it was an article of faith with Americans—a\r\nbelief shared by European liberals—that the poverty of the down-trodden\r\nmasses of the Old World was due to aristocratic and monarchical\r\ninstitutions. This belief has rapidly passed away with the appearance\r\nin the United States, under republican institutions, of social distress\r\nof the same kind, if not of the same intensity, as that prevailing in\r\nEurope. But social distress is still largely attributed to the immense\r\nburdens which existing governments impose—the great debts, the military\r\nand naval establishments, the extravagance which is characteristic\r\nas well of republican as of monarchical rulers, and especially\r\ncharacteristic of the administration of great cities. To these must be\r\nadded, in the United States, the robbery involved in the protective\r\ntariff, which for every twenty-five cents it puts in the treasury takes\r\na dollar and it may be four or five out of the pocket of the consumer.\r\nNow, there seems to be an evident connection between the immense sums\r\nthus taken from the people and the privations of the lower classes,\r\nand it is upon a superficial view natural to suppose that a reduction\r\nin the enormous burdens thus uselessly imposed would make it easier for\r\nthe poorest to get a living. But a consideration of the matter in the\r\nlight of the economic principles heretofore traced out will show that\r\nthis would not be the effect. A reduction in the amount taken from the\r\naggregate produce of a community by taxation would be simply equivalent\r\nto an increase in the power of net production. It would in effect add\r\nto the productive power of labor just as do the increasing density of\r\npopulation and improvement in the arts. And as the advantage in the one\r\ncase goes, and must go, to the owners of land, in increased rent, so\r\nwould the advantage in the other.\r\n\r\nFrom the produce of the labor and capital of England are now supported\r\nthe burden of an immense debt, an Established Church, an expensive\r\nroyal family, a large number of sinecurists, a great army and great\r\nnavy. Suppose the debt repudiated, the Church disestablished, the royal\r\nfamily set adrift to make a living for themselves, the sinecurists cut\r\noff, the army disbanded, the officers and men of the navy discharged\r\nand the ships sold. An enormous reduction in taxation would thus become\r\npossible. There would be a great addition to the net produce which\r\nremains to be distributed among the parties to production. But it\r\nwould be only such an addition as improvement in the arts has been for\r\na long time constantly making, and not so great an addition as steam\r\nand machinery have made within the last twenty or thirty years. And as\r\nthese additions have not alleviated pauperism, but have only increased\r\nrent, so would this. English land owners would reap the whole benefit.\r\nI will not dispute that if all these things could be done suddenly, and\r\nwithout the destruction and expense involved in a revolution, there\r\nmight be a temporary improvement in the condition of the lowest class;\r\nbut such a sudden and peaceable reform is manifestly impossible. And\r\nif it were, any temporary improvement would, by the process we now see\r\ngoing on in the United States, be ultimately swallowed up by increased\r\nland values.\r\n\r\nAnd, so, in the United States, if we were to reduce public expenditures\r\nto the lowest possible point, and meet them by revenue taxation, the\r\nbenefit could certainly not be greater than that which railroads have\r\nbrought. There would be more wealth left in the hands of the people as\r\na whole, just as the railroads have put more wealth in the hands of the\r\npeople as a whole, but the same inexorable laws would operate as to its\r\ndistribution. The condition of those who live by their labor would not\r\nultimately be improved.\r\n\r\nA dim consciousness of this pervades—or, rather, is beginning to\r\npervade—the masses, and constitutes one of the grave political\r\ndifficulties that are closing in around the American republic. Those\r\nwho have nothing but their labor, and especially the proletarians\r\nof the cities—a growing class—care little about the prodigality of\r\ngovernment, and in many cases are disposed to look upon it as a good\r\nthing—“furnishing employment,” or “putting money in circulation.”\r\nTweed, who robbed New York as a guerrilla chief might levy upon a\r\ncaptured town (and who was but a type of the new banditti who are\r\ngrasping the government of all our cities), was undoubtedly popular\r\nwith a majority of the voters, though his thieving was notorious,\r\nand his spoils were blazoned in big diamonds and lavish personal\r\nexpenditure. After his indictment, he was triumphantly elected to the\r\nSenate; and, even when a recaptured fugitive, was frequently cheered on\r\nhis way from court to prison. He had robbed the public treasury of many\r\nmillions, but the proletarians felt that he had not robbed them. And\r\nthe verdict of political economy is the same as theirs.\r\n\r\nLet me be clearly understood. I do not say that governmental\r\neconomy is not desirable; but simply that reduction in the expenses\r\nof government can have no direct effect in extirpating poverty and\r\nincreasing wages, so long as land is monopolized.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is true, yet even with sole reference to the interests\r\nof the lowest class, no effort should be spared to keep down useless\r\nexpenditures. The more complex and extravagant government becomes, the\r\nmore it gets to be a power distinct from and independent of the people,\r\nand the more difficult does it become to bring questions of real public\r\npolicy to a popular decision. Look at our elections in the United\r\nStates—upon what do they turn? The most momentous problems are pressing\r\nupon us, yet so great is the amount of money in politics, so large are\r\nthe personal interests involved, that the most important questions of\r\ngovernment are but little considered. The average American voter has\r\nprejudices, party feelings, general notions of a certain kind, but he\r\ngives to the fundamental questions of government not much more thought\r\nthan a street-car horse does to the profits of the line. Were this not\r\nthe case, so many hoary abuses could not have survived and so many new\r\nones been added. Anything that tends to make government simple and\r\ninexpensive tends to put it under control of the people and to bring\r\nquestions of real importance to the front. But no reduction in the\r\nexpenses of government can of itself cure or mitigate the evils that\r\narise from a constant tendency to the unequal distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.—From the Diffusion of Education and Improved Habits of Industry\r\nand Thrift._\r\n\r\nThere is, and always has been, a widespread belief among the more\r\ncomfortable classes that the poverty and suffering of the masses are\r\ndue to their lack of industry, frugality, and intelligence. This\r\nbelief, which at once soothes the sense of responsibility and flatters\r\nby its suggestion of superiority, is probably even more prevalent in\r\ncountries like the United States, where all men are politically equal,\r\nand where, owing to the newness of society, the differentiation into\r\nclasses has been of individuals rather than of families, than it is\r\nin older countries, where the lines of separation have been longer,\r\nand are more sharply, drawn. It is but natural for those who can trace\r\ntheir own better circumstances to the superior industry and frugality\r\nthat gave them a start, and the superior intelligence that enabled them\r\nto take advantage of every opportunity,[44] to imagine that those who\r\nremain poor do so simply from lack of these qualities.\r\n\r\nBut whoever has grasped the laws of the distribution of wealth, as in\r\nprevious chapters they have been traced out, will see the mistake in\r\nthis notion. The fallacy is similar to that which would be involved\r\nin the assertion that every one of a number of competitors might\r\nwin a race. That _any_ one might is true; that _every_ one might is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nFor, as soon as land acquires a value, wages, as we have seen, do\r\nnot depend upon the real earnings or product of labor, but upon\r\nwhat is left to labor after rent is taken out; and when land is all\r\nmonopolized, as it is everywhere except in the newest communities, rent\r\nmust drive wages down to the point at which the poorest paid class\r\nwill be just able to live and reproduce, and thus wages are forced\r\nto a minimum fixed by what is called the standard of comfort—that\r\nis, the amount of necessaries and comforts which habit leads the\r\nworking classes to demand as the lowest on which they will consent\r\nto maintain their numbers. This being the case, industry, skill,\r\nfrugality, and intelligence can avail the individual only in so far\r\nas they are superior to the general level—just as in a race speed can\r\navail the runner only in so far as it exceeds that of his competitors.\r\nIf one man work harder, or with superior skill or intelligence than\r\nordinary, he will get ahead; but if the average of industry, skill, or\r\nintelligence be brought up to the higher point, the increased intensity\r\nof application will secure but the old rate of wages, and he who would\r\nget ahead must work harder still.\r\n\r\nOne individual may save money from his wages by living as Dr. Franklin\r\ndid when, during his apprenticeship and early journeyman days, he\r\nconcluded to practice vegetarianism; and many poor families might be\r\nmade more comfortable by being taught to prepare the cheap dishes to\r\nwhich Franklin tried to limit the appetite of his employer Keimer, as\r\na condition to his acceptance of the position of confuter of opponents\r\nto the new religion of which Keimer wished to become the prophet,[45]\r\nbut if the working classes generally came to live in that way, wages\r\nwould ultimately fall in proportion, and whoever wished to get ahead by\r\nthe practice of economy, or to mitigate poverty by teaching it, would\r\nbe compelled to devise some still cheaper mode of keeping soul and body\r\ntogether. If, under existing conditions, American mechanics would come\r\ndown to the Chinese standard of living, they would ultimately have to\r\ncome down to the Chinese standard of wages; or if English laborers\r\nwould content themselves with the rice diet and scanty clothing of the\r\nBengalee, labor would soon be as ill paid in England as in Bengal. The\r\nintroduction of the potato into Ireland was expected to improve the\r\ncondition of the poorer classes, by increasing the difference between\r\nthe wages they received and the cost of their living. The consequences\r\nthat did ensue were a rise of rent and a lowering of wages, and, with\r\nthe potato blight, the ravages of famine among a population that had\r\nalready reduced its standard of comfort so low that the next step was\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nAnd, so, if one individual work more hours than the average, he will\r\nincrease his wages; but the wages of all cannot be increased in this\r\nway. It is notorious that in occupations where working hours are long,\r\nwages are not higher than where working hours are shorter; generally\r\nthe reverse, for the longer the working day, the more helpless does\r\nthe laborer become—the less time has he to look around him and develop\r\nother powers than those called forth by his work; the less becomes his\r\nability to change his occupation or to take advantage of circumstances.\r\nAnd, so, the individual workman who gets his wife and children to\r\nassist him may thus increase his income; but in occupations where\r\nit has become habitual for the wife and children of the laborer to\r\nsupplement his work, it is notorious that the wages earned by the whole\r\nfamily do not on the average exceed those of the head of the family in\r\noccupations where it is usual for him only to work. Swiss family labor\r\nin watch making competes in cheapness with American machinery. The\r\nBohemian cigar makers of New York, who work, men, women, and children,\r\nin their tenement-house rooms, have reduced the prices of cigar making\r\nto less than the Chinese in San Francisco were getting.\r\n\r\nThese general facts are well known. They are fully recognized in\r\nstandard politico-economic works, where, however, they are explained\r\nupon the Malthusian theory of the tendency of population to multiply\r\nup to the limit of subsistence. The true explanation, as I have\r\nsufficiently shown, is in the tendency of rent to reduce wages.\r\n\r\nAs to the effects of education, it may be worth while to say a few\r\nwords specially, for there is a prevailing disposition to attribute to\r\nit something like a magical influence. Now, education is only education\r\nin so far as it enables a man more effectively to use his natural\r\npowers, and this is something that what we call education in very great\r\npart fails to do. I remember a little girl, pretty well along in her\r\nschool geography and astronomy, who was much astonished to find that\r\nthe ground in her mother’s back yard was really the surface of the\r\nearth, and, if you talk with them, you will find that a good deal of\r\nthe knowledge of many college graduates is much like that of the little\r\ngirl. They seldom think any better, and sometimes not so well as men\r\nwho have never been to college.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who had spent many years in Australia, and knew intimately\r\nthe habits of the aborigines (Rev. Dr. Bleesdale), after giving some\r\ninstances of their wonderful skill in the use of their weapons, in\r\nforetelling changes in the wind and weather and in trapping the shyest\r\nbirds, once said to me: “I think it a great mistake to look on these\r\nblack fellows as ignorant. Their knowledge is different from ours,\r\nbut in it they are generally better educated. As soon as they begin\r\nto toddle, they are taught to play with little boomerangs and other\r\nweapons, to observe and to judge, and, when they are old enough to\r\ntake care of themselves, they are fully able to do so—are, in fact,\r\nin reference to the nature of their knowledge, what I should call\r\nwell-educated gentlemen; which is more than I can say for many of our\r\nyoung fellows who have had what we call the best advantages, but who\r\nenter upon manhood unable to do anything either for themselves or for\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it is evident that intelligence, which is or should\r\nbe the aim of education, until it induces and enables the masses to\r\ndiscover and remove the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth,\r\ncan operate upon wages only by increasing the effective power of labor.\r\nIt has the same effect as increased skill or industry. And it can raise\r\nthe wages of the individual only in so far as it renders him superior\r\nto others. When to read and write were rare accomplishments, a clerk\r\ncommanded high respect and large wages, but now the ability to read and\r\nwrite has become so nearly universal as to give no advantage. Among\r\nthe Chinese the ability to read and write seems absolutely universal,\r\nbut wages in China touch the lowest possible point. The diffusion of\r\nintelligence, except as it may make men discontented with a state of\r\nthings which condemns producers to a life of toil while non-producers\r\nloll in luxury, cannot tend to raise wages generally, or in any way\r\nimprove the condition of the lowest class—the “mud-sills” of society,\r\nas a Southern Senator once called them—who must rest on the soil,\r\nno matter how high the superstructure may be carried. No increase\r\nof the effective power of labor can increase general wages, so long\r\nas rent swallows up all the gain. This is not merely a deduction\r\nfrom principles. It is the fact, proved by experience. The growth of\r\nknowledge and the progress of invention have multiplied the effective\r\npower of labor over and over again without increasing wages. In England\r\nthere are over a million paupers. In the United States almshouses are\r\nincreasing and wages are decreasing.\r\n\r\nIt is true that greater industry and skill, greater prudence, and a\r\nhigher intelligence, are, as a rule, found associated with a better\r\nmaterial condition of the working classes; but that this is effect, not\r\ncause, is shown by the relation of the facts. Wherever the material\r\ncondition of the laboring classes has been improved, improvement in\r\ntheir personal qualities has followed, and wherever their material\r\ncondition has been depressed, deterioration in these qualities has\r\nbeen the result; but nowhere can improvement in material condition be\r\nshown as the result of the increase of industry, skill, prudence, or\r\nintelligence in a class condemned to toil for a bare living, though\r\nthese qualities when once attained (or, rather, their concomitant—the\r\nimprovement in the standard of comfort) offer a strong, and, in many\r\ncases, a sufficient, resistance to the lowering of material condition.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the qualities that raise man above the animal are\r\nsuperimposed on those which he shares with the animal, and that it is\r\nonly as he is relieved from the wants of his animal nature that his\r\nintellectual and moral nature can grow. Compel a man to drudgery for\r\nthe necessities of animal existence, and he will lose the incentive to\r\nindustry—the progenitor of skill—and will do only what he is forced to\r\ndo. Make his condition such that it cannot be much worse, while there\r\nis little hope that anything he can do will make it much better, and he\r\nwill cease to look beyond the day. Deny him leisure—and leisure does\r\nnot mean the want of employment, but the absence of the need which\r\nforces to uncongenial employment—and you cannot, even by running the\r\nchild through a common school and supplying the man with a newspaper,\r\nmake him intelligent.\r\n\r\nIt is true that improvement in the material condition of a people\r\nor class may not show immediately in mental and moral improvement.\r\nIncreased wages may at first be taken out in idleness and dissipation.\r\nBut they will ultimately bring increased industry, skill, intelligence,\r\nand thrift. Comparisons between different countries; between different\r\nclasses in the same country; between the same people at different\r\nperiods; and between the same people when their conditions are changed\r\nby emigration, show, as an invariable result, that the personal\r\nqualities of which we are speaking appear as material conditions are\r\nimproved, and disappear as material conditions are depressed. Poverty\r\nis the Slough of Despond which Bunyan saw in his dream, and into\r\nwhich good books may be tossed forever without result. To make people\r\nindustrious, prudent, skillful, and intelligent, they must be relieved\r\nfrom want. If you would have the slave show the virtues of the freeman,\r\nyou must first make him free.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.—From Combinations of Workmen._\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the laws of distribution, as previously traced,\r\nthat combinations of workmen _can_ advance wages, and this not at\r\nthe expense of other workmen, as is sometimes said, nor yet at the\r\nexpense of capital, as is generally believed; but, ultimately, at the\r\nexpense of rent. That no general advance in wages can be secured by\r\ncombination; that any advance in particular wages thus secured must\r\nreduce other wages or the profits of capital, or both—are ideas that\r\nspring from the erroneous notion that wages are drawn from capital.\r\nThe fallacy of these ideas is demonstrated, not alone by the laws of\r\ndistribution as we have worked them out, but by experience, so far as\r\nit has gone. The advance of wages in particular trades by combinations\r\nof workmen, of which there are many examples, has nowhere shown any\r\neffect in lowering wages in other trades, or in reducing the rate\r\nof profits. Except as it may affect his fixed capital or current\r\nengagements, a diminution of wages can benefit, and an increase of\r\nwages injure an employer only in so far as it gives him an advantage\r\nor puts him at a disadvantage as compared with other employers. The\r\nemployer who first succeeds in reducing the wages of his hands, or is\r\nfirst compelled to pay an advance, gains an advantage, or is put at\r\na disadvantage in regard to his competitors, which ceases when the\r\nmovement includes them also. So far, however, as the change in wages\r\naffects his contracts or stock on hand, by changing the relative cost\r\nof production, it may be to him a real gain or loss, though this gain\r\nor loss, being purely relative, disappears when the whole community\r\nis considered. And, if the change in wages works a change in relative\r\ndemand, it may render capital fixed in machinery, buildings, or\r\notherwise, more or less profitable. But, in this, a new equilibrium is\r\nsoon reached; for, especially in a progressive country, fixed capital\r\nis only somewhat less mobile than circulating capital. If there is too\r\nlittle in a certain form, the tendency of capital to assume that form\r\nsoon brings it up to the required amount; if there is too much, the\r\ncessation of increment soon restores the level.\r\n\r\nBut, while a change in the rate of wages in any particular occupation\r\nmay induce a change in the relative demand for labor, it can produce\r\nno change in the aggregate demand. For instance, let us suppose that\r\na combination of the workmen engaged in any particular manufacture\r\nraise wages in one country, while a combination of employers reduce\r\nwages in the same manufacture in another country. If the change be\r\ngreat enough, the demand, or part of the demand, in the first country\r\nwill now be supplied by importation of such manufactures from the\r\nsecond. But, evidently, this increase in importations of a particular\r\nkind must necessitate either a corresponding decrease in importations\r\nof other kinds, or a corresponding increase in exportations. For, it\r\nis only with the produce of its labor and capital that one country\r\ncan demand, or can obtain, in exchange, the produce of the labor and\r\ncapital of another. The idea that the lowering of wages can increase,\r\nor the increase of wages can diminish, the trade of a country, is as\r\nbaseless as the idea that the prosperity of a country can be increased\r\nby taxes on imports, or diminished by the removal of restrictions on\r\ntrade. If all wages in any particular country were to be doubled, that\r\ncountry would continue to export and import the same things, and in\r\nthe same proportions; for exchange is determined not by absolute, but\r\nby relative, cost of production. But, if wages in some branches of\r\nproduction were doubled, and in others not increased, or not increased\r\nso much, there would be a change in the proportion of the various\r\nthings imported, but no change in the proportion between exports and\r\nimports.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the objections made to the combination of workmen for\r\nthe advance of wages are thus baseless, while the success of such\r\ncombinations cannot reduce other wages, or decrease the profits of\r\ncapital, or injuriously affect national prosperity, yet so great are\r\nthe difficulties in the way of the effective combinations of laborers,\r\nthat the good that can be accomplished by them is extremely limited,\r\nwhile there are inherent disadvantages in the process.\r\n\r\nTo raise wages in a particular occupation or occupations, which is all\r\nthat any combination of workmen yet made has been equal to attempting,\r\nis manifestly a task the difficulty of which progressively increases.\r\nFor the higher are wages of any particular kind raised above their\r\nnormal level with other wages, the stronger are the tendencies to bring\r\nthem back. Thus, if a printers’ union, by a successful or threatened\r\nstrike, raise the wages of typesetting ten per cent. above the normal\r\nrate as compared with other wages, relative demand and supply are at\r\nonce affected. On the one hand, there is a tendency to a diminution\r\nof the amount of typesetting called for; and, on the other, the\r\nhigher rate of wages tends to increase the number of compositors in\r\nways the strongest combination cannot altogether prevent. If the\r\nincrease be twenty per cent., these tendencies are much stronger; if\r\nit is fifty per cent., they become stronger still, and so on. So that\r\npractically—even in countries like England, where the lines between\r\ndifferent trades are much more distinct and difficult to pass than\r\nin countries like the United States—that which trades’ unions, even\r\nwhen supporting each other, can do in the way of raising wages is\r\ncomparatively little, and this little, moreover, is confined to their\r\nown sphere, and does not affect the lower stratum of unorganized\r\nlaborers, whose condition most needs alleviation and ultimately\r\ndetermines that of all above them. The only way by which wages could be\r\nraised to any extent and with any permanence by this method would be\r\nby a general combination, such as was aimed at by the Internationals,\r\nwhich should include laborers of all kinds. But such a combination\r\nmay be set down as practically impossible, for the difficulties of\r\ncombination, great enough in the most highly paid and smallest trades,\r\nbecome greater and greater as we descend in the industrial scale.\r\n\r\nNor, in the struggle of endurance, which is the only method which\r\ncombinations not to work for less than a certain minimum have of\r\neffecting the increase of wages, must it be forgotten who are the real\r\nparties pitted against each other. It is not labor and capital. It\r\nis laborers on the one side and the owners of land on the other. If\r\nthe contest were between labor and capital, it would be on much more\r\nequal terms. For the power of capital to stand out is only some little\r\ngreater than that of labor. Capital not only ceases to earn anything\r\nwhen not used, but it goes to waste—for in nearly all its forms it can\r\nbe maintained only by constant reproduction. But land will not starve\r\nlike laborers or go to waste like capital—its owners can wait. They may\r\nbe inconvenienced, it is true, but what is inconvenience to them, is\r\ndestruction to capital and starvation to labor.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural laborers in certain parts of England are now\r\nendeavoring to combine for the purpose of securing an increase in\r\ntheir miserably low wages. If it was capital that was receiving the\r\nenormous difference between the real produce of their labor and\r\nthe pittance they get out of it, they would have but to make an\r\neffective combination to secure success; for the farmers, who are\r\ntheir direct employers, can afford to go without labor but little,\r\nif any, better than the laborers can afford to go without wages. But\r\nthe farmers cannot yield much without a reduction of rent; and thus\r\nit is between the land owners and the laborers that the real struggle\r\nmust come. Suppose the combination to be so thorough as to include\r\nall agricultural laborers, and to prevent from doing so all who might\r\nbe tempted to take their places. The laborers refuse to work except\r\nat a considerable advance of wages; the farmers can give it only by\r\nsecuring a considerable reduction of rent, and have no way to back\r\ntheir demands except as the laborers back theirs, by refusing to go on\r\nwith production. If cultivation thus comes to a dead-lock, the land\r\nowners would lose only their rent, while the land improved by lying\r\nfallow. But the laborers would starve. And if English laborers of all\r\nkinds were united in one grand league for a general increase of wages,\r\nthe real contest would be the same, and under the same conditions.\r\nFor wages could not be increased except to the decrease of rent; and\r\nin a general dead-lock, land owners could live, while laborers of all\r\nsorts must starve or emigrate. The owners of the land of England are by\r\nvirtue of their ownership the masters of England. So true is it that\r\n“to whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belong the fruits\r\nof it.” The white parasols and the elephants mad with pride passed with\r\nthe grant of English land, and the people at large can never regain\r\ntheir power until that grant is resumed. What is true of England, is\r\nuniversally true.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that such a dead-lock in production could never occur.\r\nThis is true; but true only because no such thorough combination of\r\nlabor as might produce it is possible. But the fixed and definite\r\nnature of land enables land owners to combine much more easily and\r\nefficiently than either laborers or capitalists. How easy and efficient\r\ntheir combination is, there are many historical examples. And the\r\nabsolute necessity for the use of land, and the certainty in all\r\nprogressive countries that it must increase in value, produce among\r\nland owners, without any formal combination, all the effects that\r\ncould be produced by the most rigorous combination among laborers or\r\ncapitalists. Deprive a laborer of opportunity of employment, and he\r\nwill soon be anxious to get work on any terms, but when the receding\r\nwave of speculation leaves nominal land values clearly above real\r\nvalues, whoever has lived in a growing country knows with what tenacity\r\nland owners hold on.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides these practical difficulties in the plan of forcing by\r\nendurance an increase of wages, there are in such methods inherent\r\ndisadvantages which workingmen should not blink. I speak without\r\nprejudice, for I am still an honorary member of the union which, while\r\nworking at my trade, I always loyally supported. But, see: The methods\r\nby which a trade union can alone act are necessarily destructive;\r\nits organization is necessarily tyrannical. A strike, which is the\r\nonly recourse by which a trade union can enforce its demands, is a\r\ndestructive contest—just such a contest as that to which an eccentric,\r\ncalled “The Money King,” once, in the early days of San Francisco,\r\nchallenged a man who had taunted him with meanness, that they should\r\ngo down to the wharf and alternately toss twenty-dollar pieces into\r\nthe bay until one gave in. The struggle of endurance involved in a\r\nstrike is, really, what it has often been compared to—a war; and, like\r\nall war, it lessens wealth. And the organization for it must, like\r\nthe organization for war, be tyrannical. As even the man who would\r\nfight for freedom, must, when he enters an army, give up his personal\r\nfreedom and become a mere part in a great machine, so must it be with\r\nworkmen who organize for a strike. These combinations are, therefore,\r\nnecessarily destructive of the very things which workmen seek to gain\r\nthrough them—wealth and freedom.\r\n\r\nThere is an ancient Hindoo mode of compelling the payment of a just\r\ndebt, traces of something akin to which Sir Henry Maine has found in\r\nthe laws of the Irish Brehons. It is called, sitting _dharna_—the\r\ncreditor seeking enforcement of his debt by sitting down at the door of\r\nthe debtor, and refusing to eat or drink until he is paid.\r\n\r\nLike this is the method of labor combinations. In their strikes,\r\ntrades’ unions sit _dharna_. But, unlike the Hindoo, they have not the\r\npower of superstition to back them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.—From Co-operation._\r\n\r\nIt is now, and has been for some time, the fashion to preach\r\nco-operation as the sovereign remedy for the grievances of the working\r\nclasses. But, unfortunately for the efficacy of co-operation as a\r\nremedy for social evils, these evils, as we have seen, do not arise\r\nfrom any conflict between labor and capital; and if co-operation were\r\nuniversal, it could not raise wages or relieve poverty. This is readily\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nCo-operation is of two kinds—co-operation in supply and co-operation\r\nin production. Now, co-operation in supply, let it go as far as it\r\nmay in excluding middlemen, only reduces the cost of exchanges. It\r\nis simply a device to save labor and eliminate risk, and its effect\r\nupon distribution can be only that of the improvements and inventions\r\nwhich have in modern times so wonderfully cheapened and facilitated\r\nexchanges—viz., to increase rent. And co-operation in production is\r\nsimply a reversion to that form of wages which still prevails in the\r\nwhaling service, and is there termed a “lay.” It is the substitution of\r\nproportionate wages for fixed wages—a substitution of which there are\r\noccasional instances in almost all employments; or, if the management\r\nis left to the workmen, and the capitalist but takes his proportion of\r\nthe net produce, it is simply the system that has prevailed to a large\r\nextent in European agriculture since the days of the Roman Empire—the\r\ncolonial or metayer system. All that is claimed for co-operation in\r\nproduction is, that it makes the workman more active and industrious—in\r\nother words, that it increases the efficiency of labor. Thus its effect\r\nis in the same direction as the steam engine, the cotton gin, the\r\nreaping machine—in short, all the things in which material progress\r\nconsists, and it can produce only the same result—viz., the increase of\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking proof of how first principles are ignored in dealing\r\nwith social problems, that in current economic and semi-economic\r\nliterature so much importance is attached to co-operation as a means\r\nfor increasing wages and relieving poverty. That it can have no such\r\ngeneral tendency is apparent.\r\n\r\nWaiving all the difficulties that under present conditions beset\r\nco-operation either of supply or of production, and supposing it so\r\nextended as to supplant present methods—that co-operative stores\r\nmade the connection between producer and consumer with the minimum\r\nof expense, and co-operative workshops, factories, farms, and mines,\r\nabolished the employing capitalist who pays fixed wages, and greatly\r\nincreased the efficiency of labor—what then? Why, simply that it would\r\nbecome possible to produce the same amount of wealth with less labor,\r\nand consequently that the owners of land, the source of all wealth,\r\ncould command a greater amount of wealth for the use of their land.\r\nThis is not a matter of mere theory; it is proved by experience and\r\nby existing facts. Improved methods and improved machinery have the\r\nsame effect that co-operation aims at—of reducing the cost of bringing\r\ncommodities to the consumer and increasing the efficiency of labor, and\r\nit is in these respects that the older countries have the advantage of\r\nnew settlements. But, as experience has amply shown, improvements in\r\nthe methods and machinery of production and exchange have no tendency\r\nto improve the condition of the lowest class, and wages are lower\r\nand poverty deeper where exchange goes on at the minimum of cost and\r\nproduction has the benefit of the best machinery. The advantage but\r\nadds to rent.\r\n\r\nBut suppose co-operation between producers and land owners? That\r\nwould simply amount to the payment of rent in kind—the same system\r\nunder which much land is rented in California and the Southern States\r\nwhere the land owner gets a share of the crop. Save as a matter of\r\ncomputation it in no wise differs from the system which prevails in\r\nEngland of a fixed money rent. Call it co-operation, if you choose,\r\nthe terms of the co-operation would still be fixed by the laws which\r\ndetermine rent, and wherever land was monopolized, increase in\r\nproductive power would simply give the owners of the land the power to\r\ndemand a larger share.\r\n\r\nThat co-operation is by so many believed to be the solution of the\r\n“labor question” arises from the fact that, where it has been tried,\r\nit has in many instances improved perceptibly the condition of those\r\nimmediately engaged in it. But this is due simply to the fact that\r\nthese cases are isolated. Just as industry, economy, or skill may\r\nimprove the condition of the workmen who possess them in superior\r\ndegree, but cease to have this effect when improvement in these\r\nrespects becomes general, so a special advantage in procuring supplies,\r\nor a special efficiency given to some labor, may secure advantages\r\nwhich would be lost as soon as these improvements became so general\r\nas to affect the general relations of distribution. And the truth\r\nis, that, save possibly in educational effects, co-operation can\r\nproduce no general results that competition will not produce. Just as\r\nthe cheap-for-cash stores have a similar effect upon prices as the\r\nco-operative supply associations, so does competition in production\r\nlead to a similar adjustment of forces and division of proceeds as\r\nwould co-operative production. That increasing productive power does\r\nnot add to the reward of labor, is not because of competition, but\r\nbecause competition is one-sided. Land, without which there can be no\r\nproduction, is monopolized, and the competition of producers for its\r\nuse forces wages to a minimum and gives all the advantage of increasing\r\nproductive power to land owners, in higher rents and increased land\r\nvalues. Destroy this monopoly, and competition could exist only to\r\naccomplish the end which co-operation aims at—to give to each what\r\nhe fairly earns. Destroy this monopoly, and industry must become the\r\nco-operation of equals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V.—From Governmental Direction and Interference._\r\n\r\nThe limits within which I wish to keep this book will not permit\r\nan examination in detail of the methods in which it is proposed to\r\nmitigate or extirpate poverty by governmental regulation of industry\r\nand accumulation, and which in their most thorough-going form are\r\ncalled socialistic. Nor is it necessary, for the same defects attach\r\nto them all. These are the substitution of governmental direction for\r\nthe play of individual action, and the attempt to secure by restriction\r\nwhat can better be secured by freedom. As to the truths that are\r\ninvolved in socialistic ideas I shall have something to say hereafter;\r\nbut it is evident that whatever savors of regulation and restriction\r\nis in itself bad, and should not be resorted to if any other mode\r\nof accomplishing the same end presents itself. For instance, to take\r\none of the simplest and mildest of the class of measures I refer to—a\r\ngraduated tax on incomes. The object at which it aims, the reduction\r\nor prevention of immense concentrations of wealth, is good; but this\r\nmeans involves the employment of a large number of officials clothed\r\nwith inquisitorial powers; temptations to bribery, and perjury, and\r\nall other means of evasion, which beget a demoralization of opinion,\r\nand put a premium upon unscrupulousness and a tax upon conscience;\r\nand, finally, just in proportion as the tax accomplishes its effect, a\r\nlessening in the incentive to the accumulation of wealth, which is one\r\nof the strong forces of industrial progress. While, if the elaborate\r\nschemes for regulating everything and finding a place for everybody\r\ncould be carried out, we should have a state of society resembling that\r\nof ancient Peru, or that which, to their eternal honor, the Jesuits\r\ninstituted and so long maintained in Paraguay.\r\n\r\nI will not say that such a state as this is not a better social state\r\nthan that to which we now seem to be tending, for in ancient Peru,\r\nthough production went on under the greatest disadvantages, from the\r\nwant of iron and the domestic animals, yet there was no such thing\r\nas want, and the people went to their work with songs. But this it\r\nis unnecessary to discuss. Socialism in anything approaching such\r\na form, modern society cannot successfully attempt. The only force\r\nthat has ever proved competent for it—a strong and definite religious\r\nfaith—is wanting and is daily growing less. We have passed out of the\r\nsocialism of the tribal state, and cannot re-enter it again except by\r\na retrogression that would involve anarchy and perhaps barbarism. Our\r\ngovernments, as is already plainly evident, would break down in the\r\nattempt. Instead of an intelligent award of duties and earnings, we\r\nshould have a Roman distribution of Sicilian corn, and the demagogue\r\nwould soon become the Imperator.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of socialism is grand and noble; and it is, I am convinced,\r\npossible of realization; but such a state of society cannot be\r\nmanufactured—it must grow. Society is an organism, not a machine. It\r\ncan live only by the individual life of its parts. And in the free and\r\nnatural development of all the parts will be secured the harmony of the\r\nwhole. All that is necessary to social regeneration is included in the\r\nmotto of those Russian patriots sometimes called Nihilists—“Land and\r\nLiberty!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_VI.—From a More General Distribution of Land._\r\n\r\nThere is a rapidly growing feeling that the tenure of land is in some\r\nmanner connected with the social distress which manifests itself in\r\nthe most progressive countries; but this feeling as yet mostly shows\r\nitself in propositions which look to the more general division of\r\nlanded property—in England, free trade in land, tenant right, or the\r\nequal partition of landed estates among heirs; in the United States,\r\nrestrictions upon the size of individual holdings. It has been also\r\nproposed in England that the state should buy out the landlords, and\r\nin the United States that grants of money should be made to enable the\r\nsettlements of colonies upon public lands. The former proposition let\r\nus pass for the present; the latter, so far as its distinctive feature\r\nis concerned, falls into the category of the measures considered in\r\nthe last section. It needs no argument to show to what abuses and\r\ndemoralization grants of public money or credit would lead.\r\n\r\nHow what the English writers call “free trade in land”—the removal of\r\nduties and restrictions upon conveyances—could facilitate the division\r\nof ownership in agricultural land, I cannot see, though it might to\r\nsome extent have that effect as regards town property. The removal of\r\nrestrictions upon buying and selling would merely permit the ownership\r\nof land to assume more quickly the form to which it tends. Now, that\r\nthe tendency in Great Britain is to concentration is shown by the fact\r\nthat, in spite of the difficulties interposed by the cost of transfer,\r\nland ownership has been and is steadily concentrating there, and that\r\nthis tendency is a general one is shown by the fact that the same\r\nprocess of concentration is observable in the United States. I say this\r\nunhesitatingly in regard to the United States, although statistical\r\ntables are sometimes quoted to show a different tendency. But how,\r\nin such a country as the United States, the ownership of land may be\r\nreally concentrating, while census tables show rather a diminution\r\nin the average size of holdings, is readily seen. As land is brought\r\ninto use, and, with the growth of population, passes from a lower to\r\na higher or intenser use, the size of holdings tends to diminish.\r\nA small stock range would be a large farm, a small farm would be a\r\nlarge orchard, vineyard, nursery, or vegetable garden, and a patch of\r\nland which would be small even for these purposes would make a very\r\nlarge city property. Thus, the growth of population, which puts land\r\nto higher or intenser uses, tends naturally to reduce the size of\r\nholdings, by a process very marked in new countries; but with this may\r\ngo on a tendency to the concentration of land ownership, which, though\r\nnot revealed by tables which show the average size of holdings, is just\r\nas clearly seen. Average holdings of one acre in a city may show a much\r\ngreater concentration of land ownership than average holdings of 640\r\nacres in a newly settled township. I refer to this to show the fallacy\r\nin the deductions drawn from the tables which are frequently paraded in\r\nthe United States to show that land monopoly is an evil that will cure\r\nitself. On the contrary, it is obvious that the proportion of land\r\nowners to the whole population is constantly decreasing.\r\n\r\nAnd that there is in the United States, as there is in Great Britain, a\r\nstrong tendency to the concentration of land ownership in agriculture\r\nis clearly seen. As, in England and Ireland, small farms are being\r\nthrown into larger ones, so in New England, according to the reports\r\nof the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the size of farms\r\nincreasing. This tendency is even more clearly noticeable in the newer\r\nStates and Territories. Only a few years ago a farm of 320 acres would,\r\nunder the system of agriculture prevailing in the northern parts of\r\nthe Union, have anywhere been a large one, probably as much as one man\r\ncould cultivate to advantage. In California now there are farms (not\r\ncattle ranges) of five, ten, twenty, forty and sixty thousand acres,\r\nwhile the model farm of Dakota embraces 100,000 acres. The reason is\r\nobvious. It is the application of machinery to agriculture and the\r\ngeneral tendency to production on a large scale. The same tendency\r\nwhich substitutes the factory, with its army of operatives, for many\r\nindependent hand-loom weavers, is beginning to exhibit itself in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nNow, the existence of this tendency shows two things: first, that any\r\nmeasures which merely permit or facilitate the greater subdivision of\r\nland would be inoperative; and, second, that any measures which would\r\ncompel it would have a tendency to check production. If land in large\r\nbodies can be cultivated more cheaply than land in small bodies, to\r\nrestrict ownership to small bodies will reduce the aggregate production\r\nof wealth, and, in so far as such restrictions are imposed and take\r\neffect, will they tend to diminish the general productiveness of labor\r\nand capital.\r\n\r\nThe effort, therefore, to secure a fairer division of wealth by such\r\nrestrictions is liable to the drawback of lessening the amount to\r\nbe divided. The device is like that of the monkey, who, dividing the\r\ncheese between the cats, equalized matters by taking a bite off the\r\nbiggest piece.\r\n\r\nBut there is not merely this objection, which weighs against every\r\nproposition to restrict the ownership of land, with a force that\r\nincreases with the efficiency of the proposed measure. There is the\r\nfurther and fatal objection that restriction will not secure the end\r\nwhich is alone worth aiming at—a fair division of the produce. It will\r\nnot reduce rent, and therefore cannot increase wages. It may make the\r\ncomfortable classes larger, but will not improve the condition of those\r\nin the lowest class.\r\n\r\nIf what is known as the Ulster tenant right were extended to the whole\r\nof Great Britain, it would be but to carve out of the estate of the\r\nlandlord an estate for the tenant. The condition of the laborer would\r\nnot be a whit improved. If landlords were prohibited from asking an\r\nincrease of rent from their tenants and from ejecting a tenant so\r\nlong as the fixed rent was paid, the body of the producers would gain\r\nnothing. Economic rent would still increase, and would still steadily\r\nlessen the proportion of the produce going to labor and capital. The\r\nonly difference would be that the tenants of the first landlords, who\r\nwould become landlords in their turn, would profit by the increase.\r\n\r\nIf by a restriction upon the amount of land any one individual might\r\nhold, by the regulation of devises and successions, or by cumulative\r\ntaxation, the few thousand land holders of Great Britain should be\r\nincreased by two or three million, these two or three million people\r\nwould be gainers. But the rest of the population would gain nothing.\r\nThey would have no more share in the advantages of land ownership than\r\nbefore. And if, what is manifestly impossible, a fair distribution of\r\nthe land were made among the whole population, giving to each his\r\nequal share, and laws enacted which would interpose a barrier to the\r\ntendency to concentration by forbidding the holding by any one of more\r\nthan the fixed amount, what would become of the increase of population?\r\n\r\nJust what may be accomplished by the greater division of land may be\r\nseen in those districts of France and Belgium where minute division\r\nprevails. That such a division of land is on the whole much better,\r\nand that it gives a far more stable basis to the state than that which\r\nprevails in England, there can be no doubt. But that it does not make\r\nwages any higher or improve the condition of the class who have only\r\ntheir labor, is equally clear. These French and Belgian peasants\r\npractice a rigid economy unknown to any of the English-speaking\r\npeoples. And if such striking symptoms of the poverty and distress of\r\nthe lowest class are not apparent as on the other side of the channel,\r\nit must, I think, be attributed, not only to this fact, but to another\r\nfact, which accounts for the continuance of the minute division of the\r\nland—that material progress has not been so rapid.\r\n\r\nNeither has population increased with the same rapidity (on the\r\ncontrary it has been nearly stationary), nor have improvements in the\r\nmodes of production been so great. Nevertheless, M. de Laveleye, all\r\nof whose prepossessions are in favor of small holdings, and whose\r\ntestimony will therefore carry more weight than that of English\r\nobservers, who may be supposed to harbor a prejudice for the system of\r\ntheir own country, states in his paper on the Land Systems of Belgium\r\nand Holland, printed by the Cobden Club, that the condition of the\r\nlaborer is worse under this system of the minute division of land\r\nthan it is in England; while the tenant farmers—for tenancy largely\r\nprevails even where the _morcellment_ is greatest—are rack-rented with\r\na mercilessness unknown in England, and even in Ireland, and the\r\nfranchise “so far from raising them in the social scale, is but a\r\nsource of mortification and humiliation to them, for they are forced to\r\nvote according to the dictates of the landlord instead of following the\r\ndictates of their own inclination and convictions.”\r\n\r\nBut while the subdivision of land can thus do nothing to cure the evils\r\nof land monopoly, while it can have no effect in raising wages or in\r\nimproving the condition of the lowest classes, its tendency is to\r\nprevent the adoption or even advocacy of more thorough-going measures,\r\nand to strengthen the existing unjust system by interesting a larger\r\nnumber in its maintenance. M. de Laveleye, in concluding the paper from\r\nwhich I have quoted, urges the greater division of land as the surest\r\nmeans of securing the great land owners of England from something far\r\nmore radical. Although in the districts where land is so minutely\r\ndivided, the condition of the laborer is, he states, the worst in\r\nEurope and the renting farmer is much more ground down by his landlord\r\nthan the Irish tenant, yet “feelings hostile to social order,” M. de\r\nLaveleye goes on to say, “do not manifest themselves,” because—\r\n\r\n “The tenant, although ground down by the constant rise of rents,\r\n lives among his equals, peasants like himself who have tenants whom\r\n they use just as the large land holder does his. His father, his\r\n brother, perhaps the man himself, possesses something like an acre of\r\n land, which he lets at as high a rent as he can get. In the public\r\n house peasant proprietors will boast of the high rents they get for\r\n their lands, just as they might boast of having sold their pigs or\r\n potatoes very dear. Letting at as high a rent as possible comes thus\r\n to seem to him to be quite a matter of course, and he never dreams of\r\n finding fault with either the land owners as a class or with property\r\n in land. His mind is not likely to dwell on the notion of a caste\r\n of domineering landlords, of “bloodthirsty tyrants,” fattening on\r\n the sweat of impoverished tenants and doing no work themselves; for\r\n those who drive the hardest bargains are not the great land owners\r\n but his own fellows. Thus, the distribution of a number of small\r\n properties among the peasantry forms a kind of rampart and safeguard\r\n for the holders of large estates, and peasant property may without\r\n exaggeration be called the lightning conductor that averts from\r\n society dangers which might otherwise lead to violent catastrophes.\r\n\r\n “The concentration of land in large estates among a small number\r\n of families is a sort of provocation of leveling legislation. The\r\n position of England, so enviable in many respects, seems to me to be\r\n in this respect full of danger for the future.”\r\n\r\nTo me, for the very same reason that M. de Laveleye expresses, the\r\nposition of England seems full of hope.\r\n\r\nLet us abandon all attempt to get rid of the evils of land monopoly\r\nby restricting land ownership. An equal distribution of land is\r\nimpossible, and anything short of that would be only a mitigation,\r\nnot a cure, and a mitigation that would prevent the adoption of a\r\ncure. Nor is any remedy worth considering that does not fall in with\r\nthe natural direction of social development, and swim, so to speak,\r\nwith the current of the times. That concentration is the order of\r\ndevelopment there can be no mistaking—the concentration of people in\r\nlarge cities, the concentration of handicrafts in large factories, the\r\nconcentration of transportation by railroad and steamship lines, and of\r\nagricultural operations in large fields. The most trivial businesses\r\nare being concentrated in the same way—errands are run and carpet\r\nsacks are carried by corporations. All the currents of the time run to\r\nconcentration. To resist it successfully we must throttle steam and\r\ndischarge electricity from human service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have traced the unequal distribution of wealth which is the curse\r\nand menace of modern civilization to the institution of private\r\nproperty in land. We have seen that so long as this institution\r\nexists no increase in productive power can permanently benefit the\r\nmasses; but, on the contrary, must tend still further to depress their\r\ncondition. We have examined all the remedies, short of the abolition of\r\nprivate property in land, which are currently relied on or proposed for\r\nthe relief of poverty and the better distribution of wealth, and have\r\nfound them all inefficacious or impracticable.\r\n\r\nThere is but one way to remove an evil—and that is, to remove its\r\ncause. Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down\r\nwhile productive power grows, because land, which is the source of\r\nall wealth and the field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate\r\npoverty, to make wages what justice commands they should be, the\r\nfull earnings of the laborer, we must therefore substitute for the\r\nindividual ownership of land a common ownership. Nothing else will go\r\nto the cause of the evil—in nothing else is there the slightest hope.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the remedy for the unjust and unequal distribution of\r\nwealth apparent in modern civilization, and for all the evils which\r\nflow from it:\r\n\r\n _We must make land common property._\r\n\r\nWe have reached this conclusion by an examination in which every step\r\nhas been proved and secured. In the chain of reasoning no link is\r\nwanting and no link is weak. Deduction and induction have brought us\r\nto the same truth—that the unequal ownership of land necessitates the\r\nunequal distribution of wealth. And as in the nature of things unequal\r\nownership of land is inseparable from the recognition of individual\r\nproperty in land, it necessarily follows that the only remedy for the\r\nunjust distribution of wealth is in making land common property.\r\n\r\nBut this is a truth which, in the present state of society, will arouse\r\nthe most bitter antagonism, and must fight its way, inch by inch. It\r\nwill be necessary, therefore, to meet the objections of those who,\r\neven when driven to admit this truth, will declare that it cannot be\r\npractically applied.\r\n\r\nIn doing this we shall bring our previous reasoning to a new and\r\ncrucial test. Just as we try addition by subtraction and multiplication\r\nby division, so may we, by testing the sufficiency of the remedy, prove\r\nthe correctness of our conclusions as to the cause of the evil.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the universe are harmonious. And if the remedy to which we\r\nhave been led is the true one, it must be consistent with justice; it\r\nmust be practicable of application; it must accord with the tendencies\r\nof social development and must harmonize with other reforms.\r\n\r\nAll this I propose to show. I propose to meet all practical objections\r\nthat can be raised, and to show that this simple measure is not only\r\neasy of application; but that it is a sufficient remedy for all the\r\nevils which, as modern progress goes on, arise from the greater\r\nand greater inequality in the distribution of wealth—that it will\r\nsubstitute equality for inequality, plenty for want, justice for\r\ninjustice, social strength for social weakness, and will open the way\r\nto grander and nobler advances of civilization.\r\n\r\nI thus propose to show that the laws of the universe do not deny the\r\nnatural aspirations of the human heart; that the progress of society\r\nmight be, and, if it is to continue, must be, toward equality, not\r\ntoward inequality; and that the economic harmonies prove the truth\r\nperceived by the Stoic Emperor—\r\n\r\n “_We are made for co-operation—like feet, like hands, like eyelids,\r\n like the rows of the upper and lower teeth._”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] To say nothing of superior want of conscience, which is often the\r\ndetermining quality which makes a millionaire out of one who otherwise\r\nmight have been a poor man.\r\n\r\n[45] Franklin, in his inimitable way, relates how Keimer finally broke\r\nhis resolution and ordering a roast pig invited two lady friends to\r\ndine with him, but the pig being brought in before the company arrived,\r\nKeimer could not resist the temptation and ate it all himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE OF THE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.—INJUSTICE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.—ENSLAVEMENT OF LABORERS THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF PRIVATE\r\n PROPERTY IN LAND.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.—CLAIM OF LAND OWNERS TO COMPENSATION.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.—PROPERTY IN LAND HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.—PROPERTY IN LAND IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Justice is a relation of congruity which really subsists between two\r\n things. This relation is always the same, whatever being considers it,\r\n whether it be God, or an angel, or lastly a man.—_Montesquieu._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE INJUSTICE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is proposed to abolish private property in land the first\r\nquestion that will arise is that of justice. Though often warped by\r\nhabit, superstition, and selfishness into the most distorted forms, the\r\nsentiment of justice is yet fundamental to the human mind, and whatever\r\ndispute arouses the passions of men, the conflict is sure to rage, not\r\nso much as to the question “Is it wise?” as to the question “Is it\r\nright?”\r\n\r\nThis tendency of popular discussions to take an ethical form has\r\na cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it rests upon a\r\nvague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the deepest\r\ntruth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone is\r\nenduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions and\r\nindividual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider\r\nfield of national life it everywhere stands out.\r\n\r\nI bow to this arbitrament, and accept this test. If our inquiry into\r\nthe cause which makes low wages and pauperism the accompaniments of\r\nmaterial progress has led us to a correct conclusion, it will bear\r\ntranslation from terms of political economy into terms of ethics, and\r\nas the source of social evils show a wrong. If it will not do this, it\r\nis disproved. If it will do this, it is proved by the final decision.\r\nIf private property in land be just, then is the remedy I propose a\r\nfalse one; if, on the contrary, private property in land be unjust,\r\nthen is this remedy the true one.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes the rightful basis of property? What is it that\r\nenables a man justly to say of a thing, “It is mine?” From what springs\r\nthe sentiment which acknowledges his exclusive right as against all the\r\nworld? Is it not, primarily, the right of a man to himself to the use\r\nof his own powers, to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own exertions?\r\nIs it not this individual right, which springs from and is testified\r\nto by the natural facts of individual organization—the fact that each\r\nparticular pair of hands obey a particular brain and are related to a\r\nparticular stomach; the fact that each man is a definite, coherent,\r\nindependent whole—which alone justifies individual ownership? As a man\r\nbelongs to himself, so his labor when put in concrete form belongs to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd for this reason, that which a man makes or produces is his own, as\r\nagainst all the world—to enjoy or to destroy, to use, to exchange, or\r\nto give. No one else can rightfully claim it, and his exclusive right\r\nto it involves no wrong to any one else. Thus there is to everything\r\nproduced by human exertion a clear and indisputable title to exclusive\r\npossession and enjoyment, which is perfectly consistent with justice,\r\nas it descends from the original producer, in whom it vested by natural\r\nlaw. The pen with which I am writing is justly mine. No other human\r\nbeing can rightfully lay claim to it, for in me is the title of the\r\nproducers who made it. It has become mine, because transferred to me by\r\nthe stationer, to whom it was transferred by the importer, who obtained\r\nthe exclusive right to it by transfer from the manufacturer, in whom,\r\nby the same process of purchase, vested the rights of those who dug the\r\nmaterial from the ground and shaped it into a pen. Thus, my exclusive\r\nright of ownership in the pen springs from the natural right of the\r\nindividual to the use of his own faculties.\r\n\r\nNow, this is not only the original source from which all ideas of\r\nexclusive ownership arise—as is evident from the natural tendency\r\nof the mind to revert to it when the idea of exclusive ownership is\r\nquestioned, and the manner in which social relations develop—but it is\r\nnecessarily the only source. There can be to the ownership of anything\r\nno rightful title which is not derived from the title of the producer\r\nand does not rest upon the natural right of the man to himself. There\r\ncan be no other rightful title, because (1st) there is no other natural\r\nright from which any other title can be derived, and (2d) because the\r\nrecognition of any other title is inconsistent with and destructive of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nFor (1st) what other right exists from which the right to the exclusive\r\npossession of anything can be derived, save the right of a man to\r\nhimself? With what other power is man by nature clothed, save the power\r\nof exerting his own faculties? How can he in any other way act upon or\r\naffect material things or other men? Paralyze the motor nerves, and\r\nyour man has no more external influence or power than a log or stone.\r\nFrom what else, then, can the right of possessing and controlling\r\nthings be derived? If it spring not from man himself, from what can it\r\nspring? Nature acknowledges no ownership or control in man save as the\r\nresult of exertion. In no other way can her treasures be drawn forth,\r\nher powers directed, or her forces utilized or controlled. She makes\r\nno discriminations among men, but is to all absolutely impartial. She\r\nknows no distinction between master and slave, king and subject, saint\r\nand sinner. All men to her stand upon an equal footing and have equal\r\nrights. She recognizes no claim but that of labor, and recognizes that\r\nwithout respect to the claimant. If a pirate spread his sails, the wind\r\nwill fill them as well as it will fill those of a peaceful merchantman\r\nor missionary bark; if a king and a common man be thrown overboard,\r\nneither can keep his head above water except by swimming; birds will\r\nnot come to be shot by the proprietor of the soil any quicker than\r\nthey will come to be shot by the poacher; fish will bite or will not\r\nbite at a hook in utter disregard as to whether it is offered them by\r\na good little boy who goes to Sunday-school, or a bad little boy who\r\nplays truant; grain will grow only as the ground is prepared and the\r\nseed is sown; it is only at the call of labor that ore can be raised\r\nfrom the mine; the sun shines and the rain falls, alike upon just and\r\nunjust. The laws of nature are the decrees of the Creator. There is\r\nwritten in them no recognition of any right save that of labor; and in\r\nthem is written broadly and clearly the equal right of all men to the\r\nuse and enjoyment of nature; to apply to her by their exertions, and to\r\nreceive and possess her reward. Hence, as nature gives only to labor,\r\nthe exertion of labor in production is the only title to exclusive\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n2d. This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the\r\npossibility of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully\r\nentitled to the produce of his labor, then no one can be rightfully\r\nentitled to the ownership of anything which is not the produce of his\r\nlabor, or the labor of some one else from whom the right has passed\r\nto him. If production give to the producer the right to exclusive\r\npossession and enjoyment, there can rightfully be no exclusive\r\npossession and enjoyment of anything not the production of labor, and\r\nthe recognition of private property in land is a wrong. For the right\r\nto the produce of labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free\r\nuse of the opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of\r\nproperty in these is to deny the right of property in the produce of\r\nlabor. When non-producers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth\r\ncreated by producers, the right of the producers to the fruits of their\r\nlabor is to that extent denied.\r\n\r\nThere is no escape from this position. To affirm that a man can\r\nrightfully claim exclusive ownership in his own labor when embodied in\r\nmaterial things, is to deny that any one can rightfully claim exclusive\r\nownership in land. To affirm the rightfulness of property in land,\r\nis to affirm a claim which has no warrant in nature, as against a\r\nclaim founded in the organization of man and the laws of the material\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nWhat most prevents the realization of the injustice of private\r\nproperty in land is the habit of including all the things that are\r\nmade the subject of ownership in one category, as property, or, if any\r\ndistinction is made, drawing the line, according to the unphilosophical\r\ndistinction of the lawyers, between personal property and real\r\nestate, or things movable and things immovable. The real and natural\r\ndistinction is between things which are the produce of labor and things\r\nwhich are the gratuitous offerings of nature; or, to adopt the terms of\r\npolitical economy, between wealth and land.\r\n\r\nThese two classes of things are in essence and relations widely\r\ndifferent, and to class them together as property is to confuse all\r\nthought when we come to consider the justice or the injustice, the\r\nright or the wrong of property.\r\n\r\nA house and the lot on which it stands are alike property, as being\r\nthe subject of ownership, and are alike classed by the lawyers as real\r\nestate. Yet in nature and relations they differ widely. The one is\r\nproduced by human labor, and belongs to the class in political economy\r\nstyled wealth. The other is a part of nature, and belongs to the class\r\nin political economy styled land.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of the one class of things is that they embody\r\nlabor, are brought into being by human exertion, their existence\r\nor non-existence, their increase or diminution, depending on man.\r\nThe essential character of the other class of things is that they\r\ndo not embody labor, and exist irrespective of human exertion and\r\nirrespective of man; they are the field or environment in which man\r\nfinds himself; the storehouse from which his needs must be supplied,\r\nthe raw material upon which, and the forces with which alone his labor\r\ncan act.\r\n\r\nThe moment this distinction is realized, that moment is it seen that\r\nthe sanction which natural justice gives to one species of property is\r\ndenied to the other; that the rightfulness which attaches to individual\r\nproperty in the produce of labor implies the wrongfulness of individual\r\nproperty in land; that, whereas the recognition of the one places all\r\nmen upon equal terms, securing to each the due reward of his labor,\r\nthe recognition of the other is the denial of the equal rights of men,\r\npermitting those who do not labor to take the natural reward of those\r\nwho do.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said for the institution of private property in land,\r\nit is therefore plain that it cannot be defended on the score of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThe equal right of all men to the use of land is as clear as their\r\nequal right to breathe the air—it is a right proclaimed by the fact of\r\ntheir existence. For we cannot suppose that some men have a right to be\r\nin this world and others no right.\r\n\r\nIf we are all here by the equal permission of the Creator, we are all\r\nhere with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty—with an equal\r\nright to the use of all that nature so impartially offers.[46] This is\r\na right which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests\r\nin every human being as he enters the world, and which during his\r\ncontinuance in the world can be limited only by the equal rights of\r\nothers. There is in nature no such thing as a fee simple in land. There\r\nis on earth no power which can rightfully make a grant of exclusive\r\nownership in land. If all existing men were to unite to grant away\r\ntheir equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those who\r\nfollow them. For what are we but tenants for a day? Have we made the\r\nearth, that we should determine the rights of those who after us shall\r\ntenant it in their turn? The Almighty, who created the earth for man\r\nand man for the earth, has entailed it upon all the generations of\r\nthe children of men by a decree written upon the constitution of all\r\nthings—a decree which no human action can bar and no prescription\r\ndetermine. Let the parchments be ever so many, or possession ever\r\nso long, natural justice can recognize no right in one man to the\r\npossession and enjoyment of land that is not equally the right of all\r\nhis fellows. Though his titles have been acquiesced in by generation\r\nafter generation, to the landed estates of the Duke of Westminster\r\nthe poorest child that is born in London to-day has as much right as\r\nhas his eldest son.[47] Though the sovereign people of the State of\r\nNew York consent to the lauded possessions of the Astors, the puniest\r\ninfant that comes wailing into the world in the squalidest room of the\r\nmost miserable tenement house, becomes at that moment seized of an\r\nequal right with the millionaires. And it is robbed if the right is\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\nOur previous conclusions, irresistible in themselves, thus stand\r\napproved by the highest and final test. Translated from terms of\r\npolitical economy into terms of ethics they show a wrong as the source\r\nof the evils which increase as material progress goes on.\r\n\r\nThe masses of men, who in the midst of abundance suffer want; who,\r\nclothed with political freedom, are condemned to the wages of slavery;\r\nto whose toil labor-saving inventions bring no relief, but rather seem\r\nto rob them of a privilege, instinctively feel that “there is something\r\nwrong.” And they are right.\r\n\r\nThe wide-spreading social evils which everywhere oppress men amid\r\nan advancing civilization spring from a great primary wrong—the\r\nappropriation, as the exclusive property of some men, of the land on\r\nwhich and from which all must live. From this fundamental injustice\r\nflow all the injustices which distort and endanger modern development,\r\nwhich condemn the producer of wealth to poverty and pamper the\r\nnon-producer in luxury, which rear the tenement house with the palace,\r\nplant the brothel behind the church, and compel us to build prisons as\r\nwe open new schools.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that are\r\nnow perplexing the world. It is not that material progress is not in\r\nitself a good; it is not that nature has called into being children\r\nfor whom she has failed to provide; it is not that the Creator has\r\nleft on natural laws a taint of injustice at which even the human mind\r\nrevolts, that material progress brings such bitter fruits. That amid\r\nour highest civilization men faint and die with want is not due to the\r\nniggardliness of nature, but to the injustice of man. Vice and misery,\r\npoverty and pauperism, are not the legitimate results of increase\r\nof population and industrial development; they only follow increase\r\nof population and industrial development because land is treated as\r\nprivate property—they are the direct and necessary results of the\r\nviolation of the supreme law of justice, involved in giving to some men\r\nthe exclusive possession of that which nature provides for all men.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of individual proprietorship of land is the denial of\r\nthe natural rights of other individuals—it is a wrong which _must_\r\nshow itself in the inequitable division of wealth. For as labor cannot\r\nproduce without the use of land, the denial of the equal right to the\r\nuse of land is necessarily the denial of the right of labor to its own\r\nproduce. If one man can command the land upon which others must labor,\r\nhe can appropriate the produce of their labor as the price of his\r\npermission to labor. The fundamental law of nature, that her enjoyment\r\nby man shall be consequent upon his exertion, is thus violated. The one\r\nreceives without producing; the others produce without receiving. The\r\none is unjustly enriched; the others are robbed. To this fundamental\r\nwrong we have traced the unjust distribution of wealth which is\r\nseparating modern society into the very rich and the very poor. It\r\nis the continuous increase of rent—the price that labor is compelled\r\nto pay for the use of land, which strips the many of the wealth they\r\njustly earn, to pile it up in the hands of the few, who do nothing to\r\nearn it.\r\n\r\nWhy should they who suffer from this injustice hesitate for one moment\r\nto sweep it away? Who are the land holders that they should thus be\r\npermitted to reap where they have not sown?\r\n\r\nConsider for a moment the utter absurdity of the titles by which we\r\npermit to be gravely passed from John Doe to Richard Roe the right\r\nexclusively to possess the earth, giving absolute dominion as against\r\nall others. In California our land titles go back to the Supreme\r\nGovernment of Mexico, who took from the Spanish King, who took from\r\nthe Pope, when he by a stroke of the pen divided lands yet to be\r\ndiscovered between the Spanish or Portuguese—or if you please they rest\r\nupon conquest. In the Eastern States they go back to treaties with\r\nIndians and grants from English Kings; in Louisiana to the Government\r\nof France; in Florida to the Government of Spain; while in England they\r\ngo back to the Norman conquerors. Everywhere, not to a right which\r\nobliges, but to a force which compels. And when a title rests but on\r\nforce, no complaint can be made when force annuls it. Whenever the\r\npeople, having the power, choose to annul those titles, no objection\r\ncan be made in the name of justice. There have existed men who had\r\nthe power to hold or to give exclusive possession of portions of the\r\nearth’s surface, but when and where did there exist the human being who\r\nhad the right?\r\n\r\nThe right to exclusive ownership of anything of human production is\r\nclear. No matter how many the hands through which it has passed,\r\nthere was, at the beginning of the line, human labor—some one who,\r\nhaving procured or produced it by his exertions, had to it a clear\r\ntitle as against all the rest of mankind, and which could justly pass\r\nfrom one to another by sale or gift. But at the end of what string of\r\nconveyances or grants can be shown or supposed a like title to any part\r\nof the material universe? To improvements such an original title can\r\nbe shown; but it is a title only to the improvements, and not to the\r\nland itself. If I clear a forest, drain a swamp, or fill a morass, all\r\nI can justly claim is the value given by these exertions. They give me\r\nno right to the land itself, no claim other than to my equal share with\r\nevery other member of the community in the value which is added to it\r\nby the growth of the community.\r\n\r\nBut it will be said: There are improvements which in time become\r\nindistinguishable from the land itself! Very well; then the title\r\nto the improvements becomes blended with the title to the land; the\r\nindividual right is lost in the common right. It is the greater that\r\nswallows up the less, not the less that swallows up the greater. Nature\r\ndoes not proceed from man, but man from nature, and it is into the\r\nbosom of nature that he and all his works must return again.\r\n\r\nYet, it will be said: As every man has a right to the use and enjoyment\r\nof nature, the man who is using land must be permitted the exclusive\r\nright to its use in order that he may get the full benefit of his\r\nlabor. But there is no difficulty in determining where the individual\r\nright ends and the common right begins. A delicate and exact test is\r\nsupplied by value, and with its aid there is no difficulty, no matter\r\nhow dense population may become, in determining and securing the\r\nexact rights of each, the equal rights of all. The value of land, as\r\nwe have seen, is the price of monopoly. It is not the absolute, but\r\nthe relative, capability of land that determines its value. No matter\r\nwhat may be its intrinsic qualities, land that is no better than other\r\nland which may be had for the using can have no value. And the value\r\nof land always measures the difference between it and the best land\r\nthat may be had for the using. Thus, the value of land expresses in\r\nexact and tangible form the right of the community in land held by an\r\nindividual; and rent expresses the exact amount which the individual\r\nshould pay to the community to satisfy the equal rights of all other\r\nmembers of the community. Thus, if we concede to priority of possession\r\nthe undisturbed use of land, confiscating rent for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity, we reconcile the fixity of tenure which is necessary for\r\nimprovement with a full and complete recognition of the equal rights of\r\nall to the use of land.\r\n\r\nAs for the deduction of a complete and exclusive individual right\r\nto land from priority of occupation, that is, if possible, the most\r\nabsurd ground on which land ownership can be defended. Priority of\r\noccupation give exclusive and perpetual title to the surface of a globe\r\non which, in the order of nature, countless generations succeed each\r\nother! Had the men of the last generation any better right to the use\r\nof this world than we of this? or the men of a hundred years ago? or\r\nof a thousand years ago? Had the mound-builders, or the cave-dwellers,\r\nthe contemporaries of the mastodon and the three-toed horse, or the\r\ngenerations still further back, who, in dim æons that we can think\r\nof only as geologic periods, followed each other on the earth we now\r\ntenant for our little day?\r\n\r\nHas the first comer at a banquet the right to turn back all the chairs\r\nand claim that none of the other guests shall partake of the food\r\nprovided, except as they make terms with him? Does the first man who\r\npresents a ticket at the door of a theater, and passes in, acquire by\r\nhis priority the right to shut the doors and have the performance go\r\non for him alone? Does the first passenger who enters a railroad car\r\nobtain the right to scatter his baggage over all the seats and compel\r\nthe passengers who come in after him to stand up?\r\n\r\nThe cases are perfectly analogous. We arrive and we depart, guests\r\nat a banquet continually spread, spectators and participants in an\r\nentertainment where there is room for all who come; passengers from\r\nstation to station, on an orb that whirls through space—our rights to\r\ntake and possess cannot be exclusive; they must be bounded everywhere\r\nby the equal rights of others. Just as the passenger in a railroad car\r\nmay spread himself and his baggage over as many seats as he pleases,\r\nuntil other passengers come in, so may a settler take and use as much\r\nland as he chooses, until it is needed by others—a fact which is shown\r\nby the land acquiring a value—when his right must be curtailed by the\r\nequal rights of the others, and no priority of appropriation can give\r\na right which will bar these equal rights of others. If this were not\r\nthe case, then by priority of appropriation one man could acquire and\r\ncould transmit to whom he pleased, not merely the exclusive right to\r\n160 acres, or to 640 acres, but to a whole township, a whole State, a\r\nwhole continent.\r\n\r\nAnd to this manifest absurdity does the recognition of individual right\r\nto land come when carried to its ultimate—that any one human being,\r\ncould he concentrate in himself the individual rights to the land of\r\nany country, could expel therefrom all the rest of its inhabitants; and\r\ncould he thus concentrate the individual rights to the whole surface of\r\nthe globe, he alone of all the teeming population of the earth would\r\nhave the right to live.\r\n\r\nAnd what upon this supposition would occur is, upon a smaller scale,\r\nrealized in actual fact. The territorial lords of Great Britain, to\r\nwhom grants of land have given the “white parasols and elephants mad\r\nwith pride,” have over and over again expelled from large districts\r\nthe native population, whose ancestors had lived on the land from\r\nimmemorial times—driven them off to emigrate, to become paupers, or\r\nto starve. And on uncultivated tracts of land in the new State of\r\nCalifornia may be seen the blackened chimneys of homes from which\r\nsettlers have been driven by force of laws which ignore natural right,\r\nand great stretches of land which might be populous are desolate,\r\nbecause the recognition of exclusive ownership has put it in the\r\npower of one human creature to forbid his fellows from using it. The\r\ncomparative handful of proprietors who own the surface of the British\r\nIslands would be doing only what English law gives them full power\r\nto do, and what many of them have done on a smaller scale already,\r\nwere they to exclude the millions of British people from their native\r\nislands. And such an exclusion, by which a few hundred thousand should\r\nat will banish thirty million people from their native country, while\r\nit would be more striking, would not be a whit more repugnant to\r\nnatural right than the spectacle now presented, of the vast body of the\r\nBritish people being compelled to pay such enormous sums to a few of\r\ntheir number for the privilege of being permitted to live upon and use\r\nthe land which they so fondly call their own; which is endeared to them\r\nby memories so tender and so glorious, and for which they are held in\r\nduty bound, if need be, to spill their blood and lay down their lives.\r\n\r\nI refer only to the British Islands, because, land ownership being\r\nmore concentrated there, they afford a more striking illustration of\r\nwhat private property in land necessarily involves. “To whomsoever the\r\nsoil at any time belongs, to him belong the fruits of it,” is a truth\r\nthat becomes more and more apparent as population becomes denser and\r\ninvention and improvement add to productive power; but it is everywhere\r\na truth—as much in our new States as in the British Islands or by the\r\nbanks of the Indus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] In saying that private property in land can, in the ultimate\r\nanalysis, be justified only on the theory that some men have a better\r\nright to existence than others, I am stating only what the advocates\r\nof the existing system have themselves perceived. What gave to Malthus\r\nhis popularity among the ruling classes—what caused his illogical book\r\nto be received as a new revelation, induced sovereigns to send him\r\ndecorations, and the meanest rich man in England to propose to give him\r\na living, was the fact that he furnished a plausible reason for the\r\nassumption that some have a better right to existence than others—an\r\nassumption which is necessary for the justification of private property\r\nin land, and which Malthus clearly states in the declaration that the\r\ntendency of population is constantly to bring into the world human\r\nbeings for whom nature refuses to provide, and who consequently “have\r\nnot the slightest right to any share in the existing store of the\r\nnecessaries of life;” whom she tells as interlopers to begone, “and\r\ndoes not hesitate to extort by force obedience to her mandates,”\r\nemploying for that purpose “hunger and pestilence, war and crime,\r\nmortality and neglect of infantine life, prostitution and syphilis.”\r\nAnd to-day this Malthusian doctrine is the ultimate defense upon which\r\nthose who justify private property in land fall back. In no other way\r\ncan it be logically defended.\r\n\r\n[47] This natural and inalienable right to the equal use and enjoyment\r\nof land is so apparent that it has been recognized by men wherever\r\nforce or habit has not blunted first perceptions. To give but one\r\ninstance: The white settlers of New Zealand found themselves unable\r\nto get from the Maoris what the latter considered a complete title\r\nto land, because, although a whole tribe might have consented to a\r\nsale, they would still claim with every new child born among them an\r\nadditional payment on the ground that they had parted with only their\r\nown rights, and could not sell those of the unborn. The government was\r\nobliged to step in and settle the matter by buying land for a tribal\r\nannuity, in which every child that is born acquires a share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ENSLAVEMENT OF LABORERS THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN\r\nLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf chattel slavery be unjust, then is private property in land unjust.\r\n\r\nFor let the circumstances be what they may—the ownership of land will\r\nalways give the ownership of men, to a degree measured by the necessity\r\n(real or artificial) for the use of land. This is but a statement in\r\ndifferent form of the law of rent.\r\n\r\nAnd when that necessity is absolute—when starvation is the alternative\r\nto the use of land, then does the ownership of men involved in the\r\nownership of land become absolute.\r\n\r\nPlace one hundred men on an island from which there is no escape, and\r\nwhether you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other\r\nninety-nine, or the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make\r\nno difference either to him or to them.\r\n\r\nIn the one case, as the other, the one will be the absolute master of\r\nthe ninety-nine—his power extending even to life and death, for simply\r\nto refuse them permission to live upon the island would be to force\r\nthem into the sea.\r\n\r\nUpon a larger scale, and through more complex relations, the same cause\r\nmust operate in the same way and to the same end—the ultimate result,\r\nthe enslavement of laborers, becoming apparent just as the pressure\r\nincreases which compels them to live on and from land which is treated\r\nas the exclusive property of others. Take a country in which the soil\r\nis divided among a number of proprietors, instead of being in the\r\nhands of one, and in which, as in modern production, the capitalist has\r\nbeen specialized from the laborer, and manufactures and exchange, in\r\nall their many branches, have been separated from agriculture. Though\r\nless direct and obvious, the relations between the owners of the soil\r\nand the laborers will, with increase of population and the improvement\r\nof the arts, tend to the same absolute mastery on the one hand and the\r\nsame abject helplessness on the other, as in the case of the island\r\nwe have supposed. Rent will advance, while wages will fall. Of the\r\naggregate produce, the land owner will get a constantly increasing, the\r\nlaborer a constantly diminishing share. Just as removal to cheaper land\r\nbecomes difficult or impossible, laborers, no matter what they produce,\r\nwill be reduced to a bare living, and the free competition among them,\r\nwhere land is monopolized, will force them to a condition which, though\r\nthey may be mocked with the titles and insignia of freedom, will be\r\nvirtually that of slavery.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing strange in the fact that, in spite of the enormous\r\nincrease in productive power which this century has witnessed, and\r\nwhich is still going on, the wages of labor in the lower and wider\r\nstrata of industry should everywhere tend to the wages of slavery—just\r\nenough to keep the laborer in working condition. For the ownership\r\nof the land on which and from which a man must live is virtually the\r\nownership of the man himself, and in acknowledging the right of some\r\nindividuals to the exclusive use and enjoyment of the earth, we condemn\r\nother individuals to slavery as fully and as completely as though we\r\nhad formally made them chattels.\r\n\r\nIn a simpler form of society, where production chiefly consists in\r\nthe direct application of labor to the soil, the slavery that is the\r\nnecessary result of according to some the exclusive right to the soil\r\nfrom which all must live, is plainly seen in helotism, in villeinage,\r\nin serfdom.\r\n\r\nChattel slavery originated in the capture of prisoners in war, and,\r\nthough it has existed to some extent in every part of the globe, its\r\narea has been small, its effects trivial, as compared with the forms of\r\nslavery which have originated in the appropriation of land. No people\r\nas a mass have ever been reduced to chattel slavery to men of their own\r\nrace, nor yet on any large scale has any people ever been reduced to\r\nslavery of this kind by conquest. The general subjection of the many\r\nto the few, which we meet with wherever society has reached a certain\r\ndevelopment, has resulted from the appropriation of land as individual\r\nproperty. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere gives the\r\nownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind\r\nto which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt\r\nyet bear witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a\r\nvague tradition in the biblical story of the famine during which the\r\nPharaoh purchased up the lands of the people. It was slavery of this\r\nkind to which, in the twilight of history, the conquerors of Greece\r\nreduced the original inhabitants of that peninsula, transforming them\r\ninto helots by making them pay rent for their lands. It was the growth\r\nof the _latifundia_, or great landed estates, which transmuted the\r\npopulation of ancient Italy, from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose\r\nrobust virtues conquered the world, into a race of cringing bondsmen;\r\nit was the appropriation of the land as the absolute property of their\r\nchieftains which gradually turned the descendants of free and equal\r\nGallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and villains, and\r\nwhich changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village communities\r\ninto the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted the\r\nfeudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made\r\nthe High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their\r\nfellows. How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors\r\nwho, as comparative philology tells us, descended from the common\r\nbirthplace of the Indo-Germanic race into the lowlands of India, were\r\nturned into the suppliant and cringing Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse\r\nwhich I have before quoted gives us a hint. The white parasols and the\r\nelephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the flowers of grants\r\nof land. And could we find the key to the records of the long-buried\r\ncivilizations that lie entombed in the gigantic ruins of Yucatan and\r\nGuatemala, telling at once of the pride of a ruling class and the\r\nunrequited toil to which the masses were condemned, we should read,\r\nin all human probability, of a slavery imposed upon the great body of\r\nthe people through the appropriation of the land as the property of\r\na few—of another illustration of the universal truth that they who\r\npossess the land are masters of the men who dwell upon it.\r\n\r\nThe necessary relation between labor and land, the absolute power which\r\nthe ownership of land gives over men who cannot live but by using it,\r\nexplains what is otherwise inexplicable—the growth and persistence of\r\ninstitutions, manners, and ideas so utterly repugnant to the natural\r\nsense of liberty and equality.\r\n\r\nWhen the idea of individual ownership, which so justly and naturally\r\nattaches to things of human production, is extended to land, all the\r\nrest is a mere matter of development. The strongest and most cunning\r\neasily acquire a superior share in this species of property, which is\r\nto be had, not by production, but by appropriation, and in becoming\r\nlords of the land they become necessarily lords of their fellow-men.\r\nThe ownership of land is the basis of aristocracy. It was not nobility\r\nthat gave land, but the possession of land that gave nobility. All the\r\nenormous privileges of the nobility of medieval Europe flowed from\r\ntheir position as the owners of the soil. The simple principle of the\r\nownership of the soil produced, on the one side, the lord, on the\r\nother, the vassal—the one having all rights, the other none. The right\r\nof the lord to the soil acknowledged and maintained, those who lived\r\nupon it could do so only upon his terms. The manners and conditions of\r\nthe times made those terms include services and servitudes, as well as\r\nrents in produce or money, but the essential thing that compelled them\r\nwas the ownership of land. This power exists wherever the ownership\r\nof land exists, and can be brought out wherever the competition for\r\nthe use of land is great enough to enable the landlord to make his\r\nown terms. The English land owner of to-day has, in the law which\r\nrecognizes his exclusive right to the land, essentially all the power\r\nwhich his predecessor the feudal baron had. He might command rent in\r\nservices or servitudes. He might compel his tenants to dress themselves\r\nin a particular way, to profess a particular religion, to send their\r\nchildren to a particular school, to submit their differences to his\r\ndecision, to fall upon their knees when he spoke to them, to follow him\r\naround dressed in his livery, or to sacrifice to him female honor, if\r\nthey would prefer these things to being driven off his land. He could\r\ndemand, in short, any terms on which men would still consent to live\r\non his land, and the law could not prevent him so long as it did not\r\nqualify his ownership, for compliance with them would assume the form\r\nof a free contract or voluntary act. And English landlords do exercise\r\nsuch of these powers as in the manners of the times they care to.\r\nHaving shaken off the obligation of providing for the defense of the\r\ncountry, they no longer need the military service of their tenants, and\r\nthe possession of wealth and power being now shown in other ways than\r\nby long trains of attendants, they no longer care for personal service.\r\nBut they habitually control the votes of their tenants, and dictate to\r\nthem in many little ways. That “right reverend father in God,” Bishop\r\nLord Plunkett, evicted a number of his poor Irish tenants because they\r\nwould not send their children to Protestant Sunday-schools; and to\r\nthat Earl of Leitrim for whom Nemesis tarried so long before she sped\r\nthe bullet of an assassin, even darker crimes are imputed; while, at\r\nthe cold promptings of greed, cottage after cottage has been pulled\r\ndown and family after family forced into the roads. The principle that\r\npermits this is the same principle that in ruder times and a simpler\r\nsocial state enthralled the great masses of the common people and\r\nplaced such a wide gulf between noble and peasant. Where the peasant\r\nwas made a serf, it was simply by forbidding him to leave the estate\r\non which he was born, thus artificially producing the condition we\r\nsupposed on the island. In sparsely settled countries this is necessary\r\nto produce absolute slavery, but where land is fully occupied,\r\ncompetition may produce substantially the same conditions. Between the\r\ncondition of the rack-rented Irish peasant and the Russian serf, the\r\nadvantage was in many things on the side of the serf. The serf did not\r\nstarve.\r\n\r\nNow, as I think I have conclusively proved, it is the same cause which\r\nhas in every age degraded and enslaved the laboring masses that is\r\nworking in the civilized world to-day. Personal liberty—that is to say,\r\nthe liberty to move about—is everywhere conceded, while of political\r\nand legal inequality there are in the United States no vestiges,\r\nand in the most backward civilized countries but few. But the great\r\ncause of inequality remains, and is manifesting itself in the unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth. The essence of slavery is that it takes from\r\nthe laborer all he produces save enough to support an animal existence,\r\nand to this minimum the wages of free labor, under existing conditions,\r\nunmistakably tend. Whatever be the increase of productive power, rent\r\nsteadily tends to swallow up the gain, and more than the gain.\r\n\r\nThus the condition of the masses in every civilized country is, or\r\nis tending to become, that of virtual slavery under the forms of\r\nfreedom. And it is probable that of all kinds of slavery this is the\r\nmost cruel and relentless. For the laborer is robbed of the produce\r\nof his labor and compelled to toil for a mere subsistence; but his\r\ntaskmasters, instead of human beings, assume the form of imperious\r\nnecessities. Those to whom his labor is rendered and from whom his\r\nwages are received are often driven in their turn—contact between the\r\nlaborers and the ultimate beneficiaries of their labor is sundered,\r\nand individuality is lost. The direct responsibility of master to\r\nslave, a responsibility which exercises a softening influence upon\r\nthe great majority of men, does not arise; it is not one human being\r\nwho seems to drive another to unremitting and ill-requited toil,\r\nbut “the inevitable laws of supply and demand,” for which no one in\r\nparticular is responsible. The maxims of Cato the Censor—maxims which\r\nwere regarded with abhorrence even in an age of cruelty and universal\r\nslave-holding—that after as much work as possible is obtained from a\r\nslave he should be turned out to die, become the common rule; and even\r\nthe selfish interest which prompts the master to look after the comfort\r\nand well-being of the slave is lost. Labor has become a commodity, and\r\nthe laborer a machine. There are no masters and slaves, no owners and\r\nowned, but only buyers and sellers. The higgling of the market takes\r\nthe place of every other sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the slaveholders of the South looked upon the condition of the\r\nfree laboring poor in the most advanced civilized countries, it is no\r\nwonder that they easily persuaded themselves of the divine institution\r\nof slavery. That the field hands of the South were as a class better\r\nfed, better lodged, better clothed; that they had less anxiety and\r\nmore of the amusements and enjoyments of life than the agricultural\r\nlaborers of England there can be no doubt; and even in the Northern\r\ncities, visiting slaveholders might see and hear of things impossible\r\nunder what they called their organization of labor. In the Southern\r\nStates, during the days of slavery, the master who would have compelled\r\nhis negroes to work and live as large classes of free white men and\r\nwomen are compelled in free countries to work and live, would have\r\nbeen deemed infamous, and if public opinion had not restrained him,\r\nhis own selfish interest in the maintenance of the health and strength\r\nof his chattels would. But in London, New York, and Boston, among\r\npeople who have given, and would give again, money and blood to free\r\nthe slave, where no one could abuse a beast in public without arrest\r\nand punishment, barefooted and ragged children may be seen running\r\naround the streets even in the winter time, and in squalid garrets and\r\nnoisome cellars women work away their lives for wages that fail to\r\nkeep them in proper warmth and nourishment. Is it any wonder that to\r\nthe slaveholders of the South the demand for the abolition of slavery\r\nseemed like the cant of hypocrisy?\r\n\r\nAnd now that slavery has been abolished, the planters of the South\r\nfind they have sustained no loss. Their ownership of the land upon\r\nwhich the freedmen must live gives them practically as much command of\r\nlabor as before, while they are relieved of responsibility, sometimes\r\nvery expensive. The negroes as yet have the alternative of emigrating,\r\nand a great movement of that kind seems now about commencing, but as\r\npopulation increases and land becomes dear, the planters will get a\r\ngreater proportionate share of the earnings of their laborers than\r\nthey did under the system of chattel slavery, and the laborers a less\r\nshare—for under the system of chattel slavery the slaves always got\r\nat least enough to keep them in good physical health, but in such\r\ncountries as England there are large classes of laborers who do not get\r\nthat.[48]\r\n\r\nThe influences which, wherever there is personal relation between\r\nmaster and slave, slip in to modify chattel slavery, and to prevent the\r\nmaster from exerting to its fullest extent his power over the slave,\r\nalso showed themselves in the ruder forms of serfdom that characterized\r\nthe earlier periods of European development, and aided by religion,\r\nand, perhaps, as in chattel slavery, by the more enlightened but still\r\nselfish interests of the lord, and hardening into custom, universally\r\nfixed a limit to what the owner of the land could extort from the serf\r\nor peasant, so that the competition of men without means of existence\r\nbidding against each other for access to the means of existence, was\r\nnowhere suffered to go to its full length and exert its full power of\r\ndeprivation and degradation. The helots of Greece, the métayers of\r\nItaly, the serfs of Russia and Poland, the peasants of feudal Europe,\r\nrendered to their landlords a fixed proportion either of their produce\r\nor their labor, and were not generally squeezed past that point. But\r\nthe influences which thus stepped in to modify the extortive power of\r\nland ownership, and which may still be seen on English estates where\r\nthe landlord and his family deem it their duty to send medicines and\r\ncomforts to the sick and infirm, and to look after the well-being of\r\ntheir cottagers, just as the Southern planter was accustomed to look\r\nafter his negroes, are lost in the more refined and less obvious form\r\nwhich serfdom assumes in the more complicated processes of modern\r\nproduction, which separates so widely and by so many intermediate\r\ngradations the individual whose labor is appropriated from him who\r\nappropriates it, and makes the relations between the members of the\r\ntwo classes not direct and particular, but indirect and general. In\r\nmodern society, competition has free play to force from the laborer the\r\nvery utmost he can give, and with what terrific force it is acting may\r\nbe seen in the condition of the lowest class in the centers of wealth\r\nand industry. That the condition of this lowest class is not yet more\r\ngeneral, is to be attributed to the great extent of fertile land which\r\nhas hitherto been open on this continent, and which has not merely\r\nafforded an escape for the increasing population of the older sections\r\nof the Union, but has greatly relieved the pressure in Europe—in one\r\ncountry, Ireland, the emigration having been so great as actually to\r\nreduce the population. This avenue of relief cannot last forever. It\r\nis already fast closing up, and as it closes, the pressure must become\r\nharder and harder.\r\n\r\nIt is not without reason that the wise crow in the Ramayana, the crow\r\nBushanda, “who has lived in every part of the universe and knows all\r\nevents from the beginnings of time,” declares that, though contempt of\r\nworldly advantages is necessary to supreme felicity, yet the keenest\r\npain possible is inflicted by extreme poverty. The poverty to which in\r\nadvancing civilization great masses of men are condemned, is not the\r\nfreedom from distraction and temptation which sages have sought and\r\nphilosophers have praised; it is a degrading and embruting slavery,\r\nthat cramps the higher nature, dulls the finer feelings, and drives\r\nmen by its pain to acts which the brutes would refuse. It is into\r\nthis helpless, hopeless poverty, that crushes manhood and destroys\r\nwomanhood, that robs even childhood of its innocence and joy, that the\r\nworking classes are being driven by a force which acts upon them like a\r\nresistless and unpitying machine. The Boston collar manufacturer who\r\npays his girls two cents an hour may commiserate their condition, but\r\nhe, as they, is governed by the law of competition, and cannot pay more\r\nand carry on his business, for exchange is not governed by sentiment.\r\nAnd so, through all intermediate gradations, up to those who receive\r\nthe earnings of labor without return, in the rent of land, it is the\r\ninexorable laws of supply and demand, a power with which the individual\r\ncan no more quarrel or dispute than with the winds and the tides, that\r\nseem to press down the lower classes into the slavery of want.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, the cause is that which always has and always must\r\nresult in slavery—the monopolization by some of what nature has\r\ndesigned for all.\r\n\r\nOur boasted freedom necessarily involves slavery, so long as we\r\nrecognize private property in land. Until that is abolished,\r\nDeclarations of Independence and Acts of Emancipation are in vain. So\r\nlong as one man can claim the exclusive ownership of the land from\r\nwhich other men must live, slavery will exist, and as material progress\r\ngoes on, must grow and deepen!\r\n\r\nThis—and in previous chapters of this book we have traced the process,\r\nstep by step—is what is going on in the civilized world to-day. Private\r\nownership of land is the nether millstone. Material progress is the\r\nupper millstone. Between them, with an increasing pressure, the working\r\nclasses are being ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] One of the anti-slavery agitators (Col. J. A. Collins) on a visit\r\nto England addressed a large audience in a Scotch manufacturing town,\r\nand wound up as he had been used to in the United States, by giving the\r\nration which in the slave codes of some of the States fixed the minimum\r\nof maintenance for a slave. He quickly discovered that to many of his\r\nhearers it was an anti-climax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCLAIM OF LAND OWNERS TO COMPENSATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth is, and from this truth there can be no escape, that there is\r\nand can be no just title to an exclusive possession of the soil, and\r\nthat private property in land is a bold, bare, enormous wrong, like\r\nthat of chattel slavery.\r\n\r\nThe majority of men in civilized communities do not recognize this,\r\nsimply because the majority of men do not think. With them whatever is,\r\nis right, until its wrongfulness has been frequently pointed out, and\r\nin general they are ready to crucify whoever first attempts this.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible for any one to study political economy, even as at\r\npresent taught, or to think at all upon the production and distribution\r\nof wealth, without seeing that property in land differs essentially\r\nfrom property in things of human production, and that it has no warrant\r\nin abstract justice.\r\n\r\nThis is admitted, either expressly or tacitly, in every standard work\r\non political economy, but in general merely by vague admission or\r\nomission. Attention is in general called away from the truth, as a\r\nlecturer on moral philosophy in a slave-holding community might call\r\naway attention from too close a consideration of the natural rights of\r\nmen, and private property in land is accepted without comment, as an\r\nexisting fact, or is assumed to be necessary to the proper use of land\r\nand the existence of the civilized state.\r\n\r\nThe examination through which we have passed has proved conclusively\r\nthat private property in land cannot be justified on the ground of\r\nutility—that, on the contrary, it is the great cause to which are to\r\nbe traced the poverty, misery, and degradation, the social disease\r\nand the political weakness which are showing themselves so menacingly\r\namid advancing civilization. Expediency, therefore, joins justice in\r\ndemanding that we abolish it.\r\n\r\nWhen expediency thus joins justice in demanding that we abolish an\r\ninstitution that has no broader base or stronger ground than a mere\r\nmunicipal regulation, what reason can there be for hesitation?\r\n\r\nThe consideration that seems to cause hesitation, even on the part of\r\nthose who see clearly that land by right is common property, is the\r\nidea that having permitted land to be treated as private property for\r\nso long, we should in abolishing it be doing a wrong to those who have\r\nbeen suffered to base their calculations upon its permanence; that\r\nhaving permitted land to be held as rightful property, we should by\r\nthe resumption of common rights be doing injustice to those who have\r\npurchased it with what was unquestionably their rightful property.\r\nThus, it is held that if we abolish private property in land, justice\r\nrequires that we should fully compensate those who now possess it, as\r\nthe British Government, in abolishing the purchase and sale of military\r\ncommissions, felt itself bound to compensate those who held commissions\r\nwhich they had purchased in the belief that they could sell them again,\r\nor as in abolishing slavery in the British West Indies $100,000,000 was\r\npaid the slaveholders.\r\n\r\nEven Herbert Spencer, who in his “Social Statics” has so clearly\r\ndemonstrated the invalidity of every title by which the exclusive\r\npossession of land is claimed, gives countenance to this idea (though\r\nit seems to me inconsistently) by declaring that justly to estimate\r\nand liquidate the claims of the present landholders “who have either\r\nby their own acts or by the acts of their ancestors given for their\r\nestates equivalents of honestly-earned wealth,” to be “one of the most\r\nintricate problems society will one day have to solve.”\r\n\r\nIt is this idea that suggests the proposition, which finds advocates\r\nin Great Britain, that the government shall purchase at its market\r\nprice the individual proprietorship of the land of the country, and it\r\nwas this idea which led John Stuart Mill, although clearly perceiving\r\nthe essential injustice of private property in land, to advocate,\r\nnot a full resumption of the land, but only a resumption of accruing\r\nadvantages in the future. His plan was that a fair and even liberal\r\nestimate should be made of the market value of all the land in the\r\nkingdom, and that future additions to that value, not due to the\r\nimprovements of the proprietor, should be taken by the state.\r\n\r\nTo say nothing of the practical difficulties which such cumbrous plans\r\ninvolve, in the extension of the functions of government which they\r\nwould require and the corruption they would beget, their inherent\r\nand essential defect lies in the impossibility of bridging over by\r\nany compromise the radical difference between wrong and right. Just\r\nin proportion as the interests of the land holders are conserved,\r\njust in that proportion must general interests and general rights be\r\ndisregarded, and if land holders are to lose nothing of their special\r\nprivileges, the people at large can gain nothing. To buy up individual\r\nproperty rights would merely be to give the land holders in another\r\nform a claim of the same kind and amount that their possession of\r\nland now gives them; it would be to raise for them by taxation the\r\nsame proportion of the earnings of labor and capital that they are\r\nnow enabled to appropriate in rent. Their unjust advantage would be\r\npreserved and the unjust disadvantage of the non-landholders would be\r\ncontinued. To be sure there would be a gain to the people at large\r\nwhen the advance of rents had made the amount which the land holders\r\nwould take under the present system greater than the interest upon the\r\npurchase price of the land at present rates, but this would be only a\r\nfuture gain, and in the meanwhile there would not only be no relief,\r\nbut the burden imposed upon labor and capital for the benefit of the\r\npresent land holders would be much increased. For one of the elements\r\nin the present market value of land is the expectation of future\r\nincrease of value, and thus, to buy up the lands at market rates and\r\npay interest upon the purchase money would be to saddle producers not\r\nonly with the payment of actual rent, but with the payment in full\r\nof speculative rent. Or to put it in another way: The land would be\r\npurchased at prices calculated upon a lower than the ordinary rate of\r\ninterest (for the prospective increase in land values always makes the\r\nmarket price of land much greater than would be the price of anything\r\nelse yielding the same present return), and interest upon the purchase\r\nmoney would be paid at the ordinary rate. Thus, not only all that the\r\nland yields them now would have to be paid the land owners, but a\r\nconsiderably larger amount. It would be, virtually, the state taking a\r\nperpetual lease from the present land holders at a considerable advance\r\nin rent over what they now receive. For the present the state would\r\nmerely become the agent of the land holders in the collection of their\r\nrents, and would have to pay over to them not only what they received,\r\nbut considerably more.\r\n\r\nMr. Mill’s plan for nationalizing the future “unearned increase in the\r\nvalue of land,” by fixing the present market value of all lands and\r\nappropriating to the state future increase in value, would not add to\r\nthe injustice of the present distribution of wealth, but it would not\r\nremedy it. Further speculative advance of rent would cease, and in\r\nthe future the people at large would gain the difference between the\r\nincrease of rent and the amount at which that increase was estimated\r\nin fixing the present value of land, in which, of course, prospective,\r\nas well as present, value is an element. But it would leave, for all\r\nthe future, one class in possession of the enormous advantage over\r\nothers which they now have. All that can be said of this plan is, that\r\nit might be better than nothing.\r\n\r\nSuch inefficient and impracticable schemes may do to talk about, where\r\nany proposition more efficacious would not at present be entertained,\r\nand their discussion is a hopeful sign, as it shows the entrance of the\r\nthin end of the wedge of truth. Justice in men’s mouths is cringingly\r\nhumble when she first begins a protest against a time-honored wrong,\r\nand we of the English-speaking nations still wear the collar of the\r\nSaxon thrall, and have been educated to look upon the “vested rights”\r\nof land owners with all the superstitious reverence that ancient\r\nEgyptians looked upon the crocodile. But when the times are ripe for\r\nthem, ideas grow, even though insignificant in their first appearance.\r\nOne day, the Third Estate covered their heads when the king put on his\r\nhat. A little while thereafter, and the head of a son of St. Louis\r\nrolled from the scaffold. The anti-slavery movement in the United\r\nStates commenced with talk of compensating owners, but when four\r\nmillions of slaves were emancipated, the owners got no compensation,\r\nnor did they clamor for any. And by the time the people of any such\r\ncountry as England or the United States are sufficiently aroused to the\r\ninjustice and disadvantages of individual ownership of land to induce\r\nthem to attempt its nationalization, they will be sufficiently aroused\r\nto nationalize it in a much more direct and easy way than by purchase.\r\nThey will not trouble themselves about compensating the proprietors of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nNor is it right that there should be any concern about the proprietors\r\nof land. That such a man as John Stuart Mill should have attached so\r\nmuch importance to the compensation of land owners as to have urged the\r\nconfiscation merely of the future increase in rent, is explainable only\r\nby his acquiescence in the current doctrines that wages are drawn from\r\ncapital and that population constantly tends to press upon subsistence.\r\nThese blinded him as to the full effects of the private appropriation\r\nof land. He saw that “the claim of the land holder is altogether\r\nsubordinate to the general policy of the state,” and that “when private\r\nproperty in land is not expedient, it is unjust,”[49] but, entangled in\r\nthe toils of the Malthusian doctrine, he attributed, as he expressly\r\nstates in a paragraph I have previously quoted, the want and suffering\r\nthat he saw around him to “the niggardliness of nature, not to the\r\ninjustice of man,” and thus to him the nationalization of land seemed\r\ncomparatively a little thing, that could accomplish nothing toward the\r\neradication of pauperism and the abolition of want—ends that could\r\nbe reached only as men learned to repress a natural instinct. Great\r\nas he was and pure as he was—warm heart and noble mind—he yet never\r\nsaw the true harmony of economic laws, nor realized how from this one\r\ngreat fundamental wrong flow want and misery, and vice and shame.\r\nElse he could never have written this sentence: “The land of Ireland,\r\nthe land of every country, belongs to the people of that country. The\r\nindividuals called land owners have no right in morality and justice to\r\nanything but the rent, or compensation for its salable value.”\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Prophet—figs! If the land of any country belong to\r\nthe people of that country, what right, in morality and justice, have\r\nthe individuals called land owners to the rent? If the land belong to\r\nthe people, why in the name of morality and justice should the people\r\npay its salable value for their own?\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer says:[50] “_Had_ we to deal with the parties who\r\noriginally robbed the human race of its heritage, we might make short\r\nwork of the matter?” Why not make short work of the matter anyhow? For\r\nthis robbery is not like the robbery of a horse or a sum of money, that\r\nceases with the act. It is a fresh and continuous robbery, that goes\r\non every day and every hour. It is not from the produce of the past\r\nthat rent is drawn; it is from the produce of the present. It is a\r\ntoll levied upon labor constantly and continuously. Every blow of the\r\nhammer, every stroke of the pick, every thrust of the shuttle, every\r\nthrob of the steam engine, pay it tribute. It levies upon the earnings\r\nof the men who, deep under ground, risk their lives, and of those who\r\nover white surges hang to reeling masts; it claims the just reward of\r\nthe capitalist and the fruits of the inventor’s patient effort; it\r\ntakes little children from play and from school, and compels them to\r\nwork before their bones are hard or their muscles are firm; it robs\r\nthe shivering of warmth; the hungry, of food; the sick, of medicine;\r\nthe anxious, of peace. It debases, and embrutes, and embitters. It\r\ncrowds families of eight and ten into a single squalid room; it herds\r\nlike swine agricultural gangs of boys and girls; it fills the gin\r\npalace and groggery with those who have no comfort in their homes;\r\nit makes lads who might be useful men candidates for prisons and\r\npenitentiaries; it fills brothels with girls who might have known the\r\npure joy of motherhood; it sends greed and all evil passions prowling\r\nthrough society as a hard winter drives the wolves to the abodes of\r\nmen; it darkens faith in the human soul, and across the reflection of\r\na just and merciful Creator draws the veil of a hard, and blind, and\r\ncruel fate!\r\n\r\nIt is not merely a robbery in the past; it is a robbery in the\r\npresent—a robbery that deprives of their birthright the infants that\r\nare now coming into the world! Why should we hesitate about making\r\nshort work of such a system? Because I was robbed yesterday, and the\r\nday before, and the day before that, is it any reason that I should\r\nsuffer myself to be robbed to-day and to-morrow? any reason that I\r\nshould conclude that the robber has acquired a vested right to rob me?\r\n\r\nIf the land belong to the people, why continue to permit land owners\r\nto take the rent, or compensate them in any manner for the loss of\r\nrent? Consider what rent is. It does not arise spontaneously from land;\r\nit is due to nothing that the land owners have done. It represents a\r\nvalue created by the whole community. Let the land holders have, if\r\nyou please, all that the possession of the land would give them in the\r\nabsence of the rest of the community. But rent, the creation of the\r\nwhole community, necessarily belongs to the whole community.\r\n\r\nTry the case of the land holders by the maxims of the common law by\r\nwhich the rights of man and man are determined. The common law we\r\nare told is the perfection of reason, and certainly the land owners\r\ncannot complain of its decision, for it has been built up by and for\r\nland owners. Now what does the law allow to the innocent possessor when\r\nthe land for which he paid his money is adjudged rightfully to belong\r\nto another? Nothing at all. That he purchased in good faith gives him\r\nno right or claim whatever. The law does not concern itself with the\r\n“intricate question of compensation” to the innocent purchaser. The\r\nlaw does not say, as John Stuart Mill says: “The land belongs to A,\r\ntherefore B who has thought himself the owner has no right to anything\r\nbut the rent, or compensation for its salable value.” For that would be\r\nindeed like a famous fugitive slave case decision in which the Court\r\nwas said to have given the law to the North and the nigger to the\r\nSouth. The law simply says: “The land belongs to A, let the Sheriff put\r\nhim in possession!” It gives the innocent purchaser of a wrongful title\r\nno claim, it allows him no compensation. And not only this, it takes\r\nfrom him all the improvements that he has in good faith made upon the\r\nland. You may have paid a high price for land, making every exertion\r\nto see that the title is good; you may have held it in undisturbed\r\npossession for years without thought or hint of an adverse claimant;\r\nmade it fruitful by your toil or erected upon it a costly building of\r\ngreater value than the land itself, or a modest home in which you hope,\r\nsurrounded by the fig-trees you have planted and the vines you have\r\ndressed, to pass your declining days; yet if Quirk, Gammon & Snap can\r\nmouse out a technical flaw in your parchments or hunt up some forgotten\r\nheir who never dreamed of his rights, not merely the land, but all\r\nyour improvements, may be taken away from you. And not merely that.\r\nAccording to the common law, when you have surrendered the land and\r\ngiven up your improvements, you may be called upon to account for the\r\nprofits you derived from the land during the time you had it.\r\n\r\nNow if we apply to this case of The People _vs._ The Land Owners the\r\nsame maxims of justice that have been formulated by land owners into\r\nlaw, and are applied every day in English and American courts to\r\ndisputes between man and man, we shall not only not think of giving\r\nthe land holders any compensation for the land, but shall take all the\r\nimprovements and whatever else they may have as well.\r\n\r\nBut I do not propose, and I do not suppose that any one else will\r\npropose, to go so far. It is sufficient if the people resume the\r\nownership of the land. Let the land owners retain their improvements\r\nand personal property in secure possession.\r\n\r\nAnd in this measure of justice would be no oppression, no injury to any\r\nclass. The great cause of the present unequal distribution of wealth,\r\nwith the suffering, degradation, and waste that it entails, would be\r\nswept away. Even land holders would share in the general gain. The gain\r\nof even the large land holders would be a real one. The gain of the\r\nsmall land holders would be enormous. For in welcoming Justice, men\r\nwelcome the handmaid of Love. Peace and Plenty follow in her train,\r\nbringing their good gifts, not to some, but to all.\r\n\r\nHow true this is, we shall hereafter see.\r\n\r\nIf in this chapter I have spoken of justice and expediency as if\r\njustice were one thing and expediency another, it has been merely to\r\nmeet the objections of those who so talk. In justice is the highest and\r\ntruest expediency.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[49] Principles of Political Economy, Book I, Chap. 3, Sec. 6.\r\n\r\n[50] Social Statics, page 142. [It may be well to say in the new\r\nreprint of this book (1897) that this and all other references to\r\nHerbert Spencer’s “Social Statics” are from the edition of that book\r\npublished by D. Appleton & Co., New York, with his consent, from 1864\r\nto 1892. At that time “Social Statics” was repudiated, and a new\r\nedition under the name of “Social Statics, abridged and revised,” has\r\ntaken its place. From this, all that the first Social Statics had said\r\nin denial of property in land has been eliminated, and it of course\r\ncontains nothing here referred to. Mr. Spencer has also been driven by\r\nthe persistent heckling of the English single tax men, who insisted\r\non asking him the questions suggested in the first Social Statics, to\r\nbring out a small volume, entitled “Mr. Herbert Spencer on the Land\r\nQuestion,” in which are reprinted in parallel columns Chapter IX of\r\nSocial Statics, with what he considers valid answers to himself as\r\ngiven in “Justice,” 1891. This has also been reprinted by D. Appleton &\r\nCo., and constitutes, I think, the very funniest answer to himself ever\r\nmade by a man who claimed to be a philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat more than anything else prevents the realization of the essential\r\ninjustice of private property in land and stands in the way of a candid\r\nconsideration of any proposition for abolishing it, is that mental\r\nhabit which makes anything that has long existed seem natural and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe are so used to the treatment of land as individual property, it is\r\nso thoroughly recognized in our laws, manners, and customs, that the\r\nvast majority of people never think of questioning it; but look upon\r\nit as necessary to the use of land. They are unable to conceive, or at\r\nleast it does not enter their heads to conceive, of society as existing\r\nor as possible without the reduction of land to private possession. The\r\nfirst step to the cultivation or improvement of land seems to them to\r\nget for it a particular owner, and a man’s land is looked on by them as\r\nfully and as equitably his, to sell, to lease, to give, or to bequeath,\r\nas his house, his cattle, his goods, or his furniture. The “sacredness\r\nof property” has been preached so constantly and effectively,\r\nespecially by those “conservators of ancient barbarism,” as Voltaire\r\nstyled the lawyers, that most people look upon the private ownership of\r\nland as the very foundation of civilization, and if the resumption of\r\nland as common property is suggested, think of it at first blush either\r\nas a chimerical vagary, which never has and never can be realized, or\r\nas a proposition to overturn society from its base and bring about a\r\nreversion to barbarism.\r\n\r\nIf it were true that land had always been treated as private property,\r\nthat would not prove the justice or necessity of continuing so to treat\r\nit, any more than the universal existence of slavery, which might once\r\nhave been safely affirmed, would prove the justice or necessity of\r\nmaking property of human flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nNot long ago monarchy seemed all but universal, and not only the kings\r\nbut the majority of their subjects really believed that no country\r\ncould get along without a king. Yet, to say nothing of America, France\r\nnow gets along without a king; the Queen of England and Empress of\r\nIndia has about as much to do with governing her realms as the wooden\r\nfigurehead of a ship has in determining its course, and the other\r\ncrowned heads of Europe sit, metaphorically speaking, upon barrels of\r\nnitro-glycerine.\r\n\r\nSomething over a hundred years ago, Bishop Butler, author of the famous\r\nAnalogy, declared that “a constitution of civil government without any\r\nreligious establishment is a chimerical project of which there is no\r\nexample.” As for there being no example, he was right. No government at\r\nthat time existed, nor would it have been easy to name one that ever\r\nhad existed, without some sort of an established religion; yet in the\r\nUnited States we have since proved by the practice of a century that it\r\nis possible for a civil government to exist without a state church.\r\n\r\nBut while, were it true, that land had always and everywhere been\r\ntreated as private property would not prove that it should always be\r\nso treated, this is _not_ true. On the contrary, the common right to\r\nland has everywhere been primarily recognized, and private ownership\r\nhas nowhere grown up save as the result of usurpation. The primary and\r\npersistent perceptions of mankind are that all have an equal right\r\nto land, and the opinion that private property in land is necessary\r\nto society is but an offspring of ignorance that cannot look beyond\r\nits immediate surroundings—an idea of comparatively modern growth, as\r\nartificial and as baseless as that of the right divine of kings.\r\n\r\nThe observations of travelers, the researches of the critical\r\nhistorians who within a recent period have done so much to reconstruct\r\nthe forgotten records of the people, the investigations of such men\r\nas Sir Henry Maine, Emile de Laveleye, Professor Nasse of Bonn, and\r\nothers, into the growth of institutions, prove that wherever human\r\nsociety has formed, the common right of men to the use of the earth has\r\nbeen recognized, and that nowhere has unrestricted individual ownership\r\nbeen freely adopted. Historically, as ethically, private property in\r\nland is robbery. It nowhere springs from contract; it can nowhere be\r\ntraced to perceptions of justice or expediency; it has everywhere had\r\nits birth in war and conquest, and in the selfish use which the cunning\r\nhave made of superstition and law.\r\n\r\nWherever we can trace the early history of society, whether in Asia,\r\nin Europe, in Africa, in America, or in Polynesia, land has been\r\nconsidered, as the necessary relations which human life has to it would\r\nlead to its consideration—as common property, in which the rights\r\nof all who had admitted rights were equal. That is to say, that all\r\nmembers of the community, all citizens, as we should say, had equal\r\nrights to the use and enjoyment of the land of the community. This\r\nrecognition of the common right to land did not prevent the full\r\nrecognition of the particular and exclusive right in things which\r\nare the result of labor, nor was it abandoned when the development\r\nof agriculture had imposed the necessity of recognizing exclusive\r\npossession of land in order to secure the exclusive enjoyment of the\r\nresults of the labor expended in cultivating it. The division of\r\nland between the industrial units, whether families, joint families,\r\nor individuals, went only as far as was necessary for that purpose,\r\npasture and forest lands being retained as common, and equality as to\r\nagricultural land being secured, either by a periodical re-division, as\r\namong the Teutonic races, or by the prohibition of alienation, as in\r\nthe law of Moses.\r\n\r\nThis primary adjustment still exists, in more or less intact form, in\r\nthe village communities of India, Russia, and the Sclavonic countries\r\nyet, or until recently, subjected to Turkish rule; in the mountain\r\ncantons of Switzerland; among the Kabyles in the north of Africa, and\r\nthe Kaffirs in the south; among the native population of Java, and\r\nthe aborigines of New Zealand—that is to say, wherever extraneous\r\ninfluences have left intact the form of primitive social organization.\r\nThat it everywhere existed has been within late years abundantly proved\r\nby the researches of many independent students and observers, and which\r\nare, to my knowledge, best summarized in the “Systems of Land Tenures\r\nin Various Countries,” published under authority of the Cobden Club,\r\nand in M. Emile de Laveleye’s “Primitive Property,” to which I would\r\nrefer the reader who desires to see this truth displayed in detail.\r\n\r\n“In all primitive societies,” says M. de Laveleye, as the result of\r\nan investigation which leaves no part of the world unexplored—“in all\r\nprimitive societies, the soil was the joint property of the tribes and\r\nwas subject to periodical distribution among all the families, so that\r\nall might live by their labor as nature has ordained. The comfort of\r\neach was thus proportioned to his energy and intelligence; no one, at\r\nany rate, was destitute of the means of subsistence, and inequality\r\nincreasing from generation to generation was provided against.”\r\n\r\nIf M. de Laveleye be right in this conclusion, and that he is right\r\nthere can be no doubt, how, it will be asked, has the reduction of land\r\nto private ownership become so general?\r\n\r\nThe causes which have operated to supplant this original idea of the\r\nequal right to the use of land by the idea of exclusive and unequal\r\nrights may, I think, be everywhere vaguely but certainly traced. They\r\nare everywhere the same which have led to the denial of equal personal\r\nrights and to the establishment of privileged classes.\r\n\r\nThese causes may be summarized as the concentration of power in the\r\nhands of chieftains and the military class, consequent on a state of\r\nwarfare, which enabled them to monopolize common lands; the effect of\r\nconquest, in reducing the conquered to a state of predial slavery, and\r\ndividing their lands among the conquerors, and in disproportionate\r\nshare to the chiefs; the differentiation and influence of a sacerdotal\r\nclass, and the differentiation and influence of a class of professional\r\nlawyers, whose interests were served by the substitution of exclusive,\r\nin place of common, property in land[51]—inequality once produced\r\nalways tending to greater inequality, by the law of attraction.\r\n\r\nIt was the struggle between this idea of equal rights to the soil and\r\nthe tendency to monopolize it in individual possession, that caused\r\nthe internal conflicts of Greece and Rome; it was the check given to\r\nthis tendency—in Greece by such institutions as those of Lycurgus and\r\nSolon, and in Rome by the Licinian Law and subsequent divisions of\r\nland—that gave to each their days of strength and glory; and it was\r\nthe final triumph of this tendency that destroyed both. Great estates\r\nruined Greece, as afterward “great estates ruined Italy,”[52] and as\r\nthe soil, in spite of the warnings of great legislators and statesmen,\r\npassed finally into the possession of a few, population declined, art\r\nsank, the intellect became emasculate, and the race in which humanity\r\nhad attained its most splendid development became a by-word and\r\nreproach among men.\r\n\r\nThe idea of absolute individual property in land, which modern\r\ncivilization derived from Rome, reached its full development there in\r\nhistoric times. When the future mistress of the world first looms up,\r\neach citizen had his little homestead plot, which was inalienable,\r\nand the general domain—“the corn-land which was of public right”—was\r\nsubject to common use, doubtless under regulations or customs which\r\nsecured equality, as in the Teutonic mark and Swiss allmend. It was\r\nfrom this public domain constantly extended by conquest, that the\r\npatrician families succeeded in carving their great estates. These\r\ngreat estates by the power with which the great attracts the less, in\r\nspite of temporary checks by legal limitation and recurring divisions,\r\nfinally crushed out all the small proprietors, adding their little\r\npatrimonies to the _latifundia_ of the enormously rich, while they\r\nthemselves were forced into the slave gangs, became rent-paying\r\ncolonii, or else were driven into the freshly conquered foreign\r\nprovinces, where land was given to the veterans of the legions; or to\r\nthe metropolis, to swell the ranks of the proletariat who had nothing\r\nto sell but their votes.\r\n\r\nCæsarism, soon passing into an unbridled despotism of the Eastern\r\ntype, was the inevitable political result, and the empire, even while\r\nit embraced the world, became in reality a shell, kept from collapse\r\nonly by the healthier life of the frontiers, where the land had\r\nbeen divided among military settlers or the primitive usages longer\r\nsurvived. But the _latifundia_, which had devoured the strength of\r\nItaly, crept steadily outward, carving the surface of Sicily, Africa,\r\nSpain, and Gaul into great estates cultivated by slaves or tenants.\r\nThe hardy virtues born of personal independence died out, an exhaustive\r\nagriculture impoverished the soil, and wild beasts supplanted men,\r\nuntil at length, with a strength nurtured in equality, the barbarians\r\nbroke through; Rome perished; and of a civilization once so proud\r\nnothing was left but ruins.\r\n\r\nThus came to pass that marvelous thing, which at the time of Rome’s\r\ngrandeur would have seemed as impossible as it seems now to us that\r\nthe Comanches or Flatheads should conquer the United States, or the\r\nLaplanders should desolate Europe. The fundamental cause is to be\r\nsought in the tenure of land. On the one hand, the denial of the common\r\nright to land had resulted in decay; on the other, equality gave\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“Freedom,” says M. de Laveleye (“Primitive Property,” p. 116),\r\n“freedom, and, as a consequence, the ownership of an undivided share\r\nof the common property, to which the head of every family in the clan\r\nwas equally entitled, were in the German village essential rights.\r\nThis system of absolute equality impressed a remarkable character on\r\nthe individual, which explains how small bands of barbarians made\r\nthemselves masters of the Roman Empire, in spite of its skillful\r\nadministration, its perfect centralization and its civil law, which has\r\npreserved the name of written reason.”\r\n\r\nIt was, on the other hand, that the heart was eaten out of that great\r\nempire. “Rome perished,” says Professor Seeley, “from the failure of\r\nthe crop of men.”\r\n\r\nIn his lectures on the “History of Civilization in Europe,” and more\r\nelaborately in his lectures on the “History of Civilization in France,”\r\nM. Guizot has vividly described the chaos that in Europe succeeded\r\nthe fall of the Roman Empire—a chaos which, as he says, “carried all\r\nthings in its bosom,” and from which the structure of modern society\r\nwas slowly evolved. It is a picture which cannot be compressed into a\r\nfew lines, but suffice it to say that the result of this infusion of\r\nrude but vigorous life into Romanized society was a disorganization\r\nof the German, as well as the Roman structure—both a blending and an\r\nadmixture of the idea of common rights in the soil with the idea of\r\nexclusive property, substantially as occurred in those provinces of the\r\nEastern Empire subsequently overrun by the Turks. The feudal system,\r\nwhich was so readily adopted and so widely spread, was the result of\r\nsuch a blending; but underneath, and side by side with the feudal\r\nsystem, a more primitive organization, based on the common rights of\r\nthe cultivators, took root or revived, and has left its traces all\r\nover Europe. This primitive organization, which allots equal shares of\r\ncultivated ground and the common use of uncultivated ground, and which\r\nexisted in Ancient Italy as in Saxon England, has maintained itself\r\nbeneath absolutism and serfdom in Russia, beneath Moslem oppression in\r\nServia, and in India has been swept, but not entirely destroyed, by\r\nwave after wave of conquest, and century after century of oppression.\r\n\r\nThe feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe, but seems to be the\r\nnatural result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among\r\nwhom equality and individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in\r\ntheory at least, that the land belongs to society at large, not to the\r\nindividual. Rude outcome of an age in which might stood for right as\r\nnearly as it ever can (for the idea of right is ineradicable from the\r\nhuman mind, and must in some shape show itself even in the association\r\nof pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted in no one\r\nthe uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially\r\na trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign,\r\ntheoretically the representative of the collective power and rights of\r\nthe whole people, was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land.\r\nAnd though land was granted to individual possession, yet in its\r\npossession were involved duties, by which the enjoyer of its revenues\r\nwas supposed to render back to the commonwealth an equivalent for the\r\nbenefits which from the delegation of the common right he received.\r\n\r\nIn the feudal scheme the crown lands supported public expenditures\r\nwhich are now included in the civil list; the church lands defrayed the\r\ncost of public worship and instruction, of the care of the sick and of\r\nthe destitute, and maintained a class of men who were supposed to be,\r\nand no doubt to a great extent were, devoting their lives to purposes\r\nof public good; while the military tenures provided for the public\r\ndefense. In the obligation under which the military tenant lay to bring\r\ninto the field such and such a force when need should be, as well as in\r\nthe aid he had to give when the sovereign’s eldest son was knighted,\r\nhis daughter married, or the sovereign himself made prisoner of war,\r\nwas a rude and inefficient recognition, but still unquestionably a\r\nrecognition, of the fact, obvious to the natural perceptions of all\r\nmen, that land is not individual but common property.\r\n\r\nNor yet was the control of the possessor of land allowed to extend\r\nbeyond his own life. Although the principle of inheritance soon\r\ndisplaced the principle of selection, as where power is concentrated it\r\nalways must, yet feudal law required that there should always be some\r\nrepresentative of a fief, capable of discharging the duties as well as\r\nof receiving the benefits which were annexed to a landed estate, and\r\nwho this should be was not left to individual caprice, but rigorously\r\ndetermined in advance. Hence wardship and other feudal incidents. The\r\nsystem of primogeniture and its outgrowth, the entail, were in their\r\nbeginnings not the absurdities they afterward became.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the feudal system was the absolute ownership of the\r\nland, an idea which the barbarians readily acquired in the midst\r\nof a conquered population to whom it was familiar; but over this,\r\nfeudalism threw a superior right, and the process of infeudation\r\nconsisted of bringing individual dominion into subordination to the\r\nsuperior dominion, which represented the larger community or nation.\r\nIts units were the land owners, who by virtue of their ownership were\r\nabsolute lords on their own domains, and who there performed the office\r\nof protection which M. Taine has so graphically described, though\r\nperhaps with too strong a coloring, in the opening chapter of his\r\n“Ancient Régime.” The work of the feudal system was to bind together\r\nthese units into nations, and to subordinate the powers and rights of\r\nthe individual lords of land to the powers and rights of collective\r\nsociety, as represented by the suzerain or king.\r\n\r\nThus the feudal system, in its rise and development, was a triumph of\r\nthe idea of the common right to land, changing an absolute tenure into\r\na conditional tenure, and imposing peculiar obligations in return for\r\nthe privilege of receiving rent. And during the same time, the power\r\nof land ownership was trenched, as it were, from below, the tenancy\r\nat will of the cultivators of the soil very generally hardening into\r\ntenancy by custom, and the rent which the lord could exact from the\r\npeasant becoming fixed and certain.\r\n\r\nAnd amid the feudal system there remained, or there grew up,\r\ncommunities of cultivators, more or less subject to feudal dues, who\r\ntilled the soil as common property; and although the lords, where and\r\nwhen they had the power, claimed pretty much all they thought worth\r\nclaiming, yet the idea of common right was strong enough to attach\r\nitself by custom to a considerable part of the land. The commons, in\r\nfeudal ages, must have embraced a very large proportion of the area of\r\nmost European countries. For in France (although the appropriations of\r\nthese lands by the aristocracy, occasionally checked and rescinded by\r\nroyal edict, had gone on for some centuries prior to the Revolution,\r\nand during the Revolution and First Empire large distributions and\r\nsales were made), the common or communal lands still amount, according\r\nto M. de Laveleye, to 4,000,000 hectares, or 9,884,400 acres. The\r\nextent of the common land of England during the feudal ages may be\r\ninferred from the fact that though inclosures by the landed aristocracy\r\nbegan during the reign of Henry VII., it is stated that no less than\r\n7,660,413 acres of common lands were inclosed under Acts passed between\r\n1710 and 1843, of which 600,000 acres have been inclosed since 1845;\r\nand it is estimated that there still remain 2,000,000 acres of common\r\nin England, though of course the most worthless parts of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these common lands, there existed in France, until the\r\nRevolution, and in parts of Spain, until our own day, a custom having\r\nall the force of law, by which cultivated lands, after the harvest\r\nhad been gathered, became common for purposes of pasturage or travel,\r\nuntil the time had come to use the ground again; and in some places a\r\ncustom by which any one had the right to go upon ground which its owner\r\nneglected to cultivate, and there to sow and reap a crop in security.\r\nAnd if he chose to use manure for the first crop, he acquired the right\r\nto sow and gather a second crop without let or hindrance from the owner.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely the Swiss allmend, the Ditmarsh mark, the Servian\r\nand Russian village communities; not merely the long ridges which\r\non English ground, now the exclusive property of individuals, still\r\nenable the antiquarian to trace out the great fields in ancient time\r\ndevoted to the triennial rotation of crops, and in which each villager\r\nwas annually allotted his equal plot; not merely the documentary\r\nevidence which careful students have within late years drawn from old\r\nrecords; but the very institutions under which modern civilization has\r\ndeveloped, which prove the universality and long persistence of the\r\nrecognition of the common right to the use of the soil.\r\n\r\nThere still remain in our legal systems survivals that have lost their\r\nmeaning, that, like the still existing remains of the ancient commons\r\nof England, point to this. The doctrine of eminent domain, existing as\r\nwell in Mohammedan law, which makes the sovereign theoretically the\r\nonly absolute owner of land, springs from nothing but the recognition\r\nof the sovereign as the representative of the collective rights of the\r\npeople; primogeniture and entail, which still exist in England, and\r\nwhich existed in some of the American States a hundred years ago, are\r\nbut distorted forms of what was once an outgrowth of the apprehension\r\nof land as common property. The very distinction made in legal\r\nterminology between real and personal property is but the survival of\r\na primitive distinction between what was originally looked upon as\r\ncommon property and what from its nature was always considered the\r\npeculiar property of the individual. And the greater care and ceremony\r\nwhich are yet required for the transfer of land is but a survival, now\r\nmeaningless and useless, of the more general and ceremonious consent\r\nonce required for the transfer of rights which were looked upon, not as\r\nbelonging to any one member, but to every member of a family or tribe.\r\n\r\nThe general course of the development of modern civilization since the\r\nfeudal period has been to the subversion of these natural and primary\r\nideas of collective ownership in the soil. Paradoxical as it may\r\nappear, the emergence of liberty from feudal bonds has been accompanied\r\nby a tendency in the treatment of land to the form of ownership which\r\ninvolves the enslavement of the working classes, and which is now\r\nbeginning to be strongly felt all over the civilized world, in the\r\npressure of an iron yoke, which cannot be relieved by any extension\r\nof mere political power or personal liberty, and which political\r\neconomists mistake for the pressure of natural laws, and workmen for\r\nthe oppressions of capital.\r\n\r\nThis is clear—that in Great Britain to-day the right of the people\r\nas a whole to the soil of their native country is much less fully\r\nacknowledged than it was in feudal times. A much smaller proportion of\r\nthe people own the soil, and their ownership is much more absolute.\r\nThe commons, once so extensive and so largely contributing to the\r\nindependence and support of the lower classes, have, all but a small\r\nremnant of yet worthless land, been appropriated to individual\r\nownership and inclosed; the great estates of the church, which were\r\nessentially common property devoted to a public purpose, have been\r\ndiverted from that trust to enrich individuals; the dues of the\r\nmilitary tenants have been shaken off, and the cost of maintaining\r\nthe military establishment and paying the interest upon an immense\r\ndebt accumulated by wars has been saddled upon the whole people, in\r\ntaxes upon the necessaries and comforts of life. The crown lands have\r\nmostly passed into private possession, and for the support of the royal\r\nfamily and all the petty princelings who marry into it, the British\r\nworkman must pay in the price of his mug of beer and pipe of tobacco.\r\nThe English yeoman—the sturdy breed who won Crecy, and Poictiers, and\r\nAgincourt—is as extinct as the mastodon. The Scottish clansman, whose\r\nright to the soil of his native hills was then as undisputed as that of\r\nhis chieftain, has been driven out to make room for the sheep ranges\r\nor deer parks of that chieftain’s descendant; the tribal right of the\r\nIrishman has been turned into a tenancy-at-will. Thirty thousand men\r\nhave legal power to expel the whole population from five-sixths of the\r\nBritish Islands, and the vast majority of the British people have no\r\nright whatever to their native land save to walk the streets or trudge\r\nthe roads. To them may be fittingly applied the words of a Tribune\r\nof the Roman People: “_Men of Rome_,” said Tiberius Gracchus—“_men\r\nof Rome, you are called the lords of the world, yet have no right to\r\na square foot of its soil! The wild beasts have their dens, but the\r\nsoldiers of Italy have only water and air!_”\r\n\r\nThe result has, perhaps, been more marked in England than anywhere\r\nelse, but the tendency is observable everywhere, having gone further\r\nin England owing to circumstances which have developed it with greater\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe reason, I take it, that with the extension of the idea of personal\r\nfreedom has gone on an extension of the idea of private property in\r\nland, is that as in the progress of civilization the grosser forms of\r\nsupremacy connected with land ownership were dropped, or abolished, or\r\nbecame less obvious, attention was diverted from the more insidious,\r\nbut really more potential forms, and the land owners were easily\r\nenabled to put property in land on the same basis as other property.\r\n\r\nThe growth of national power, either in the form of royalty or\r\nparliamentary government, stripped the great lords of individual power\r\nand importance, and of their jurisdiction and power over persons,\r\nand so repressed striking abuses, as the growth of Roman Imperialism\r\nrepressed the more striking cruelties of slavery. The disintegration of\r\nthe large feudal estates, which, until the tendency to concentration\r\narising from the modern tendency to production upon a large scale is\r\nstrongly felt, operated to increase the number of land owners, and\r\nthe abolition of the restraints by which land owners when population\r\nwas sparser endeavored to compel laborers to remain on their estates\r\nalso contributed to draw away attention from the essential injustice\r\ninvolved in private property in land; while the steady progress of\r\nlegal ideas drawn from the Roman law, which has been the great mine\r\nand storehouse of modern jurisprudence, tended to level the natural\r\ndistinction between property in land and property in other things.\r\nThus, with the extension of personal liberty, went on an extension of\r\nindividual proprietorship in land.\r\n\r\nThe political power of the barons was, moreover, not broken by the\r\nrevolt of the classes who could clearly feel the injustice of land\r\nownership. Such revolts took place, again and again; but again and\r\nagain were they repressed with terrific cruelties. What broke the\r\npower of the barons was the growth of the artisan and trading classes,\r\nbetween whose wages and rent there is not the same obvious relation.\r\nThese classes, too, developed under a system of close guilds and\r\ncorporations, which, as I have previously explained in treating of\r\ntrade combinations and monopolies, enabled them somewhat to fence\r\nthemselves in from the operation of the general law of wages, and which\r\nwere much more easily maintained than now, when the effect of improved\r\nmethods of transportation, and the diffusion of rudimentary education\r\nand of current news, is steadily making population more mobile. These\r\nclasses did not see, and do not yet see, that the tenure of land is\r\nthe fundamental fact which must ultimately determine the conditions of\r\nindustrial, social, and political life. And so the tendency has been to\r\nassimilate the idea of property in land with that of property in things\r\nof human production, and even steps backward have been taken, and been\r\nhailed, as steps in advance. The French Constituent Assembly, in 1789,\r\nthought it was sweeping away a relic of tyranny when it abolished\r\ntithes and imposed the support of the clergy on general taxation.\r\nThe Abbé Sieyès stood alone when he told them that they were simply\r\nremitting to the proprietors a tax which was one of the conditions on\r\nwhich they held their lands, and reimposing it on the labor of the\r\nnation. But in vain. The Abbé Sieyès, being a priest, was looked on as\r\ndefending the interests of his order, when in truth he was defending\r\nthe rights of man. In those tithes, the French people might have\r\nretained a large public revenue which would not have taken one centime\r\nfrom the wages of labor or the earnings of capital.\r\n\r\nAnd so the abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long\r\nParliament, ratified after the accession of Charles II., though simply\r\nan appropriation of public revenues by the feudal land holders, who\r\nthus got rid of the consideration on which they held the common\r\nproperty of the nation, and saddled it on the people at large, in the\r\ntaxation of all consumers, has long been characterized, and is still\r\nheld up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom. Yet\r\nhere is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.\r\nHad the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better\r\nadapted to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned\r\nthe incurring of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor\r\nand capital of England need not have been taxed a single farthing for\r\nthe maintenance of a military establishment. All this would have come\r\nfrom rent, which the land holders since that time have appropriated to\r\nthemselves—from the tax which land ownership levies on the earnings\r\nof labor and capital. The land holders of England got their land on\r\nterms which required them even in the sparse population of Norman days\r\nto put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand perfectly equipped\r\nhorsemen,[53] and on the further condition of various fines and\r\nincidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would\r\nprobably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various\r\nservices and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the\r\nland holders been kept to this contract and no land been permitted\r\nto be inclosed except upon similar terms, the income accruing to the\r\nnation from English land would to-day be greater by many millions\r\nthan the entire public revenues of the United Kingdom. England to-day\r\nmight have enjoyed absolute free trade. There need not have been a\r\ncustoms duty, an excise, license, or income tax, yet all the present\r\nexpenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to be devoted to\r\nany purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being of the\r\nwhole people.\r\n\r\nTurning back, wherever there is light to guide us, we may everywhere\r\nsee that in their first perceptions, all peoples have recognized the\r\ncommon ownership in land, and that private property is an usurpation, a\r\ncreation of force and fraud.\r\n\r\nAs Madame de Stael said, “Liberty is ancient.” Justice, if we turn to\r\nthe most ancient records, will always be found to have the title of\r\nprescription.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] The influence of the lawyers has been very marked in Europe, both\r\non the continent and in Great Britain, in destroying all vestiges\r\nof the ancient tenure, and substituting the idea of the Roman law,\r\nexclusive ownership.\r\n\r\n[52] Latifundia perdidere Italiam.—_Pliny._\r\n\r\n[53] Andrew Bisset, in “The Strength of Nations,” London, 1859, a\r\nsuggestive work in which he calls the attention of the English people\r\nto this measure by which the land owners avoided the payment of their\r\nrent to the nation, disputes the statement of Blackstone that a\r\nknight’s service was but for 40 days, and says it was during necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOF PROPERTY IN LAND IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages of civilization we see that land is everywhere\r\nregarded as common property. And, turning from the dim past to our own\r\ntimes, we may see that natural perceptions are still the same, and that\r\nwhen placed under circumstances in which the influence of education and\r\nhabit is weakened, men instinctively recognize the equality of right to\r\nthe bounty of nature.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in California brought together in a new country\r\nmen who had been used to look on land as the rightful subject of\r\nindividual property, and of whom probably not one in a thousand had\r\never dreamed of drawing any distinction between property in land and\r\nproperty in anything else. But, for the first time in the history of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon race, these men were brought into contact with land\r\nfrom which gold could be obtained by the simple operation of washing it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHad the land with which they were thus called upon to deal been\r\nagricultural, or grazing, or forest land, of peculiar richness; had\r\nit been land which derived peculiar value from its situation for\r\ncommercial purposes, or by reason of the water power which it afforded;\r\nor even had it contained rich mines of coal, iron or lead, the land\r\nsystem to which they had been used would have been applied, and it\r\nwould have been reduced to private ownership in large tracts, as even\r\nthe pueblo lands of San Francisco, really the most valuable in the\r\nState, which by Spanish law had been set apart to furnish homes for\r\nthe future residents of that city, were reduced, without any protest\r\nworth speaking of. But the novelty of the case broke through habitual\r\nideas, and threw men back upon first principles, and it was by common\r\nconsent declared that this gold-bearing land should remain common\r\nproperty, of which no one might take more than he could reasonably use,\r\nor hold for a longer time than he continued to use it. This perception\r\nof natural justice was acquiesced in by the General Government and the\r\ncourts, and while placer mining remained of importance, no attempt was\r\nmade to overrule this reversion to primitive ideas. The title to the\r\nland remained in the government, and no individual could acquire more\r\nthan a possessory claim. The miners in each district fixed the amount\r\nof ground an individual could take and the amount of work that must\r\nbe done to constitute use. If this work were not done, any one could\r\nre-locate the ground. Thus, no one was allowed to forestall or to lock\r\nup natural resources. Labor was acknowledged as the creator of wealth,\r\nwas given a free field, and secured in its reward. The device would not\r\nhave assured complete equality of rights under the conditions that in\r\nmost countries prevail; but under the conditions that there and then\r\nexisted—a sparse population, an unexplored country, and an occupation\r\nin its nature a lottery, it secured substantial justice. One man might\r\nstrike an enormously rich deposit, and others might vainly prospect\r\nfor months and years, but all had an equal chance. No one was allowed\r\nto play the dog in the manger with the bounty of the Creator. The\r\nessential idea of the mining regulations was to prevent forestalling\r\nand monopoly. Upon the same principle are based the mining laws of\r\nMexico; and the same principle was adopted in Australia, in British\r\nColumbia, and in the diamond fields of South Africa, for it accords\r\nwith natural perceptions of justice.\r\n\r\nWith the decadence of placer mining in California, the accustomed\r\nidea of private property finally prevailed in the passage of a law\r\npermitting the patenting of mineral lands. The only effect is to lock\r\nup opportunities—to give the owner of mining ground the power of saying\r\nthat no one else may use what he does not choose to use himself. And\r\nthere are many cases in which mining ground is thus withheld from\r\nuse for speculative purposes, just as valuable building lots and\r\nagricultural land are withheld from use. But while thus preventing\r\nuse, the extension to mineral land of the same principle of private\r\nownership which marks the tenure of other lands has done nothing for\r\nthe security of improvements. The greatest expenditures of capital in\r\nopening and developing mines—expenditures that in some cases amounted\r\nto millions of dollars—were made upon possessory titles.\r\n\r\nHad the circumstances which beset the first English settlers in North\r\nAmerica been such as to call their attention _de novo_ to the question\r\nof land ownership, there can be no doubt that they would have reverted\r\nto first principles, just as they reverted to first principles in\r\nmatters of government; and individual land ownership would have been\r\nrejected, just as aristocracy and monarchy were rejected. But while\r\nin the country from which they came this system had not yet fully\r\ndeveloped itself, nor its effects been fully felt, the fact that in\r\nthe new country an immense continent invited settlement prevented any\r\nquestion of the justice and policy of private property in land from\r\narising. For in a new country, equality seems sufficiently assured if\r\nno one is permitted to take land to the exclusion of the rest. At first\r\nno harm seems to be done by treating this land as absolute property.\r\nThere is plenty of land left for those who choose to take it, and the\r\nslavery that in a later stage of development necessarily springs from\r\nthe individual ownership of land is not felt.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia and to the South, where the settlement had an aristocratic\r\ncharacter, the natural complement of the large estates into which the\r\nland was carved was introduced in the shape of negro slaves. But the\r\nfirst settlers of New England divided the land as, twelve centuries\r\nbefore, their ancestors had divided the land of Britain, giving to each\r\nhead of a family his town lot and his seed lot, while beyond lay the\r\nfree common. So far as concerned the great proprietors whom the English\r\nkings by letters patent endeavored to create, the settlers saw clearly\r\nenough the injustice of the attempted monopoly, and none of these\r\nproprietors got much from their grants; but the plentifulness of land\r\nprevented attention from being called to the monopoly which individual\r\nland ownership, even when the tracts are small, must involve when land\r\nbecomes scarce. And so it has come to pass that the great republic\r\nof the modern world has adopted at the beginning of its career an\r\ninstitution that ruined the republics of antiquity; that a people who\r\nproclaim the inalienable rights of all men to life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness have accepted without question a principle which,\r\nin denying the equal and inalienable right to the soil, finally denies\r\nthe equal right to life and liberty; that a people who at the cost of a\r\nbloody war have abolished chattel slavery, yet permit slavery in a more\r\nwidespread and dangerous form to take root.\r\n\r\nThe continent has seemed so wide, the area over which population might\r\nyet pour so vast, that familiarized by habit with the idea of private\r\nproperty in land, we have not realized its essential injustice. For not\r\nmerely has this background of unsettled land prevented the full effect\r\nof private appropriation from being felt, even in the older sections,\r\nbut to permit a man to take more land than he could use, that he might\r\ncompel those who afterwards needed it to pay him for the privilege of\r\nusing it, has not seemed so unjust when others in their turn might\r\ndo the same thing by going further on. And more than this, the very\r\nfortunes that have resulted from the appropriation of land, and\r\nthat have thus really been drawn from taxes levied upon the wages of\r\nlabor, have seemed, and have been heralded, as prizes held out to the\r\nlaborer. In all the newer States, and even to a considerable extent in\r\nthe older ones, our landed aristocracy is yet in its first generation.\r\nThose who have profited by the increase in the value of land have been\r\nlargely men who began life without a cent. Their great fortunes, many\r\nof them running up high into the millions, seem to them, and to many\r\nothers, as the best proofs of the justice of existing social conditions\r\nin rewarding prudence, foresight, industry, and thrift; whereas, the\r\ntruth is that these fortunes are but the gains of monopoly, and are\r\nnecessarily made at the expense of labor. But the fact that those thus\r\nenriched started as laborers hides this, and the same feeling which\r\nleads every ticket holder in a lottery to delight in imagination in the\r\nmagnitude of the prizes has prevented even the poor from quarreling\r\nwith a system which thus made many poor men rich.\r\n\r\nIn short, the American people have failed to see the essential\r\ninjustice of private property in land, because as yet they have not\r\nfelt its full effects. This public domain—the vast extent of land yet\r\nto be reduced to private possession, the enormous common to which the\r\nfaces of the energetic were always turned, has been the great fact\r\nthat, since the days when the first settlements began to fringe the\r\nAtlantic Coast, has formed our national character and colored our\r\nnational thought. It is not that we have eschewed a titled aristocracy\r\nand abolished primogeniture; that we elect all our officers from school\r\ndirector up to president; that our laws run in the name of the people,\r\ninstead of in the name of a prince; that the State knows no religion,\r\nand our judges wear no wigs—that we have been exempted from the ills\r\nthat Fourth of July orators used to point to as characteristic of the\r\neffete despotisms of the Old World. The general intelligence, the\r\ngeneral comfort, the active invention, the power of adaptation and\r\nassimilation, the free, independent spirit, the energy and hopefulness\r\nthat have marked our people, are not causes, but results—they have\r\nsprung from unfenced land. This public domain has been the transmuting\r\nforce which has turned the thriftless, unambitious European peasant\r\ninto the self-reliant Western farmer; it has given a consciousness\r\nof freedom even to the dweller in crowded cities, and has been a\r\nwell-spring of hope even to those who have never thought of taking\r\nrefuge upon it. The child of the people, as he grows to manhood\r\nin Europe, finds all the best seats at the banquet of life marked\r\n“taken,” and must struggle with his fellows for the crumbs that fall,\r\nwithout one chance in a thousand of forcing or sneaking his way to\r\na seat. In America, whatever his condition, there has always been\r\nthe consciousness that the public domain lay behind him; and the\r\nknowledge of this fact, acting and reacting, has penetrated our whole\r\nnational life, giving to it generosity and independence, elasticity\r\nand ambition. All that we are proud of in the American character; all\r\nthat makes our conditions and institutions better than those of older\r\ncountries, we may trace to the fact that land has been cheap in the\r\nUnited States, because new soil has been open to the emigrant.\r\n\r\nBut our advance has reached the Pacific. Further west we cannot go, and\r\nincreasing population can but expand north and south and fill up what\r\nhas been passed over. North, it is already filling up the valley of\r\nthe Red River, pressing into that of the Saskatchewan and pre-empting\r\nWashington Territory; south, it is covering Western Texas and taking up\r\nthe arable valleys of New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe republic has entered upon a new era, an era in which the monopoly\r\nof the land will tell with accelerating effect. The great fact which\r\nhas been so potent is ceasing to be. The public domain is almost\r\ngone—a very few years will end its influence, already rapidly failing.\r\nI do not mean to say that there will be no public domain. For a long\r\ntime to come there will be millions of acres of public lands carried\r\non the books of the Land Department. But it must be remembered that\r\nthe best part of the continent for agricultural purposes is already\r\noverrun, and that it is the poorest land that is left. It must be\r\nremembered that what remains comprises the great mountain ranges, the\r\nsterile deserts, the high plains fit only for grazing. And it must\r\nbe remembered that much of this land which figures in the reports as\r\nopen to settlement is unsurveyed land, which has been appropriated\r\nby possessory claims or locations which do not appear until the land\r\nis returned as surveyed. California figures on the books of the\r\nLand Department as the greatest land State of the Union, containing\r\nnearly 100,000,000 acres of public land—something like one-twelfth of\r\nthe whole public domain. Yet so much of this is covered by railroad\r\ngrants or held in the way of which I have spoken; so much consists of\r\nuntillable mountains or plains which require irrigation; so much is\r\nmonopolized by locations which command the water, that as a matter of\r\nfact it is difficult to point the immigrant to any part of the State\r\nwhere he can take up a farm on which he can settle and maintain a\r\nfamily, and so men, weary of the quest, end by buying land or renting\r\nit on shares. It is not that there is any real scarcity of land in\r\nCalifornia—for, an empire in herself, California will some day maintain\r\na population as large as that of France—but appropriation has got ahead\r\nof the settler and manages to keep just ahead of him.\r\n\r\nSome twelve or fifteen years ago the late Ben Wade of Ohio said, in a\r\nspeech in the United States Senate, that by the close of this century\r\nevery acre of ordinary agricultural land in the United States would be\r\nworth $50 in gold. It is already clear that if he erred at all, it\r\nwas in overstating the time. In the twenty-one years that remain of\r\nthe present century, if our population keep on increasing at the rate\r\nwhich it has maintained since the institution of the government, with\r\nthe exception of the decade which included the civil war, there will\r\nbe an addition to our present population of something like forty-five\r\nmillions, an addition of some seven millions more than the total\r\npopulation of the United States as shown by the census of 1870, and\r\nnearly half as much again as the present population of Great Britain.\r\nThere is no question about the ability of the United States to support\r\nsuch a population and many hundreds of millions more, and, under proper\r\nsocial adjustments, to support them in increased comfort; but in view\r\nof such an increase of population, what becomes of the unappropriated\r\npublic domain? Practically there will soon cease to be any. It will be\r\na very long time before it is all in use; but it will be a very short\r\ntime, as we are going, before all that men can turn to use will have an\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nBut the evil effects of making the land of a whole people the exclusive\r\nproperty of some do not wait for the final appropriation of the public\r\ndomain to show themselves. It is not necessary to contemplate them in\r\nthe future; we may see them in the present. They have grown with our\r\ngrowth, and are still increasing.\r\n\r\nWe plow new fields, we open new mines, we found new cities; we drive\r\nback the Indian and exterminate the buffalo; we girdle the land with\r\niron roads and lace the air with telegraph wires; we add knowledge to\r\nknowledge, and utilize invention after invention; we build schools and\r\nendow colleges; yet it becomes no easier for the masses of our people\r\nto make a living. On the contrary, it is becoming harder. The wealthy\r\nclass is becoming more wealthy; but the poorer class is becoming more\r\ndependent. The gulf between the employed and the employer is growing\r\nwider; social contrasts are becoming sharper; as liveried carriages\r\nappear, so do barefooted children. We are becoming used to talk of the\r\nworking classes and the propertied classes; beggars are becoming so\r\ncommon that where it was once thought a crime little short of highway\r\nrobbery to refuse food to one who asked for it, the gate is now barred\r\nand the bulldog loosed, while laws are passed against vagrants which\r\nsuggest those of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nWe call ourselves the most progressive people on earth. But what is the\r\ngoal of our progress, if these are its wayside fruits?\r\n\r\nThese are the results of private property in land—the effects of a\r\nprinciple that must act with increasing and increasing force. It is\r\nnot that laborers have increased faster than capital; it is not that\r\npopulation is pressing against subsistence; it is not that machinery\r\nhas made “work scarce;” it is not that there is any real antagonism\r\nbetween labor and capital—it is simply that land is becoming more\r\nvaluable; that the terms on which labor can obtain access to the\r\nnatural opportunities which alone enable it to produce are becoming\r\nharder and harder. The public domain is receding and narrowing.\r\nProperty in land is concentrating. The proportion of our people who\r\nhave no legal right to the land on which they live is becoming steadily\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nSays the New York _World_: “A non-resident proprietary, like that\r\nof Ireland, is getting to be the characteristic of large farming\r\ndistricts in New England, adding yearly to the nominal value of\r\nleasehold farms; advancing yearly the rent demanded, and steadily\r\ndegrading the character of the tenantry.” And the _Nation_, alluding\r\nto the same section, says: “Increased nominal value of land, higher\r\nrents, fewer farms occupied by owners; diminished product; lower\r\nwages; a more ignorant population; increasing number of women employed\r\nat hard, outdoor labor (surest sign of a declining civilization),\r\nand a steady deterioration in the style of farming—these are the\r\nconditions described by a cumulative mass of evidence that is perfectly\r\nirresistible.”\r\n\r\nThe same tendency is observable in the new States, where the large\r\nscale of cultivation recalls the _latifundia_ that ruined ancient\r\nItaly. In California a very large proportion of the farming land is\r\nrented from year to year, at rates varying from a fourth to even half\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nThe harder times, the lower wages, the increasing poverty perceptible\r\nin the United States are but results of the natural laws we have\r\ntraced—laws as universal and as irresistible as that of gravitation. We\r\ndid not establish the republic when, in the face of principalities and\r\npowers, we flung the declaration of the inalienable rights of man; we\r\nshall never establish the republic until we practically carry out that\r\ndeclaration by securing to the poorest child born among us an equal\r\nright to his native soil! We did not abolish slavery when we ratified\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment; to abolish slavery we must abolish private\r\nproperty in land! Unless we come back to first principles, unless we\r\nrecognize natural perceptions of equity, unless we acknowledge the\r\nequal right of all to land, our free institutions will be in vain; our\r\ncommon schools will be in vain; our discoveries and inventions will but\r\nadd to the force that presses the masses down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF THE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.—PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND INCONSISTENT WITH THE BEST USE OF\r\n LAND.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.—HOW EQUAL RIGHTS TO THE LAND MAY BE ASSERTED AND SECURED.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.—THE PROPOSITION TRIED BY THE CANONS OF TAXATION.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.—INDORSEMENTS AND OBJECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why hesitate?

R. Taylor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND INCONSISTENT WITH THE BEST USE OF LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a delusion resulting from the tendency to confound the\r\naccidental with the essential—a delusion which the law writers have\r\ndone their best to extend, and political economists generally have\r\nacquiesced in, rather than endeavored to expose—that private property\r\nin land is necessary to the proper use of land, and that again to make\r\nland common property would be to destroy civilization and revert to\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\nThis delusion may be likened to the idea which, according to Charles\r\nLamb, so long prevailed among the Chinese after the savor of roast\r\npork had been accidentally discovered by the burning down of Ho-ti’s\r\nhut—that to cook a pig it was necessary to set fire to a house. But,\r\nthough in Lamb’s charming dissertation it was required that a sage\r\nshould arise to teach people that they might roast pigs without burning\r\ndown houses, it does not take a sage to see that what is required for\r\nthe improvement of land is not absolute ownership of the land, but\r\nsecurity for the improvements. This will be obvious to whoever will\r\nlook around him. While there is no more necessity for making a man\r\nthe absolute and exclusive owner of land, in order to induce him to\r\nimprove it, than there is of burning down a house in order to cook a\r\npig; while the making of land private property is as rude, wasteful,\r\nand uncertain a device for securing improvement, as the burning down\r\nof a house is a rude, wasteful, and uncertain device for roasting a\r\npig, we have not the excuse for persisting in the one that Lamb’s\r\nChinamen had for persisting in the other. Until the sage arose who\r\ninvented the rude gridiron, which according to Lamb, preceded the spit\r\nand oven, no one had known or heard of a pig being roasted, except by\r\na house being burned. But, among us, nothing is more common than for\r\nland to be improved by those who do not own it. The greater part of\r\nthe land of Great Britain is cultivated by tenants, the greater part\r\nof the buildings of London are built upon leased ground, and even in\r\nthe United States the same system prevails everywhere to a greater or\r\nless extent. Thus it is a common matter for use to be separated from\r\nownership.\r\n\r\nWould not all this land be cultivated and improved just as well if the\r\nrent went to the State or municipality, as now, when it goes to private\r\nindividuals? If no private ownership in land were acknowledged, but\r\nall land were held in this way, the occupier or user paying rent to\r\nthe State, would not land be used and improved as well and as securely\r\nas now? There can be but one answer: Of course it would. Then would\r\nthe resumption of land as common property in nowise interfere with the\r\nproper use and improvement of land.\r\n\r\nWhat is necessary for the use of land is not its private ownership,\r\nbut the security of improvements. It is not necessary to say to a man,\r\n“this land is yours,” in order to induce him to cultivate or improve\r\nit. It is only necessary to say to him, “whatever your labor or capital\r\nproduces on this land shall be yours.” Give a man security that he may\r\nreap, and he will sow; assure him of the possession of the house he\r\nwants to build, and he will build it. These are the natural rewards of\r\nlabor. It is for the sake of the reaping that men sow; it is for the\r\nsake of possessing houses that men build. The ownership of land has\r\nnothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nIt was for the sake of obtaining this security, that in the beginning\r\nof the feudal period so many of the smaller land holders surrendered\r\nthe ownership of their lands to a military chieftain, receiving back\r\nthe use of them in fief or trust, and kneeling bareheaded before the\r\nlord, with their hands between his hands, swore to serve him with life,\r\nand limb, and worldly honor. Similar instances of the giving up of\r\nownership in land for the sake of security in its enjoyment are to be\r\nseen in Turkey, where a peculiar exemption from taxation and extortion\r\nattaches to _vakouf_, or church lands, and where it is a common thing\r\nfor a land owner to sell his land to a mosque for a nominal price, with\r\nthe understanding that he may remain as tenant upon it at a fixed rent.\r\n\r\nIt is not the magic of property, as Arthur Young said, that has turned\r\nFlemish sands into fruitful fields. It is the magic of security to\r\nlabor. This can be secured in other ways than making land private\r\nproperty, just as the heat necessary to roast a pig can be secured in\r\nother ways than by burning down houses. The mere pledge of an Irish\r\nlandlord that for twenty years he would not claim in rent any share\r\nin their cultivation induced Irish peasants to turn a barren mountain\r\ninto gardens; on the mere security of a fixed ground rent for a term of\r\nyears the most costly buildings of such cities as London and New York\r\nare erected on leased ground. If we give improvers such security, we\r\nmay safely abolish private property in land.\r\n\r\nThe complete recognition of common rights to land need in no way\r\ninterfere with the complete recognition of individual right to\r\nimprovements or produce. Two men may own a ship without sawing her in\r\nhalf. The ownership of a railway may be divided into a hundred thousand\r\nshares, and yet trains be run with as much system and precision as\r\nif there were but a single owner. In London, joint stock companies\r\nhave been formed to hold and manage real estate. Everything could go\r\non as now, and yet the common right to land be fully recognized by\r\nappropriating rent to the common benefit. There is a lot in the center\r\nof San Francisco to which the common rights of the people of that city\r\nare yet legally recognized. This lot is not cut up into infinitesimal\r\npieces nor yet is it an unused waste. It is covered with fine\r\nbuildings, the property of private individuals, that stand there in\r\nperfect security. The only difference between this lot and those around\r\nit, is that the rent of the one goes into the common school fund, the\r\nrent of the others into private pockets. What is to prevent the land of\r\na whole country being held by the people of the country in this way?\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to select any portion of the territory of the\r\nUnited States in which the conditions commonly taken to necessitate\r\nthe reduction of land to private ownership exist in higher degree\r\nthan on the little islets of St. Peter and St. Paul, in the Aleutian\r\nArchipelago, acquired by the Alaska purchase from Russia. These\r\nislands are the breeding places of the fur seal, an animal so timid\r\nand wary that the slightest fright causes it to abandon its accustomed\r\nresort, never to return. To prevent the utter destruction of this\r\nfishery, without which the islands are of no use to man, it is not\r\nonly necessary to avoid killing the females and young cubs, but even\r\nsuch noises as the discharge of a pistol or the barking of a dog. The\r\nmen who do the killing must be in no hurry, but quietly walk around\r\namong the seals who line the rocky beaches, until the timid animals, so\r\nclumsy on land but so graceful in water, show no more sign of fear than\r\nlazily to waddle out of the way. Then those who can be killed without\r\ndiminution of future increase are carefully separated and gently\r\ndriven inland, out of sight and hearing of the herds, where they are\r\ndispatched with clubs. To throw such a fishery as this open to whoever\r\nchose to go and kill—which would make it to the interest of each\r\nparty to kill as many as they could at the time without reference to\r\nthe future—would be utterly to destroy it in a few seasons, as similar\r\nfisheries in other oceans have been destroyed. But it is not necessary,\r\ntherefore, to make these islands private property. Though for reasons\r\ngreatly less cogent, the great public domain of the American people has\r\nbeen made over to private ownership as fast as anybody could be got\r\nto take it, these islands have been leased at a rent of $317,500 per\r\nyear,[54] probably not very much less than they could have been sold\r\nfor at the time of the Alaska purchase. They have already yielded two\r\nmillions and a half to the national treasury, and they are still, in\r\nunimpaired value (for under the careful management of the Alaska Fur\r\nCompany the seals increase rather than diminish), the common property\r\nof the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nSo far from the recognition of private property in land being necessary\r\nto the proper use of land, the contrary is the case. Treating land as\r\nprivate property stands in the way of its proper use. Were land treated\r\nas public property it would be used and improved as soon as there was\r\nneed for its use or improvement, but being treated as private property,\r\nthe individual owner is permitted to prevent others from using or\r\nimproving what he cannot or will not use or improve himself. When the\r\ntitle is in dispute, the most valuable land lies unimproved for years;\r\nin many parts of England improvement is stopped because, the estates\r\nbeing entailed, no security to improvers can be given; and large tracts\r\nof ground which, were they treated as public property, would be covered\r\nwith buildings and crops, are kept idle to gratify the caprice of\r\nthe owner. In the thickly settled parts of the United States there is\r\nenough land to maintain three or four times our present population,\r\nlying unused, because its owners are holding it for higher prices, and\r\nimmigrants are forced past this unused land to seek homes where their\r\nlabor will be far less productive. In every city valuable lots may be\r\nseen lying vacant for the same reason. If the best use of land be the\r\ntest, then private property in land is condemned, as it is condemned\r\nby every other consideration. It is as wasteful and uncertain a mode\r\nof securing the proper use of land as the burning down of houses is of\r\nroasting pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] The fixed rent under the lease to the Alaska Fur Company is\r\n$55,000 a year, with a payment of $2.62½ on each skin, which on\r\n100,000 skins, to which the take is limited, amounts to $262,500—a\r\ntotal rent of $317,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHOW EQUAL RIGHTS TO THE LAND MAY BE ASSERTED AND SECURED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have traced the want and suffering that everywhere prevail among\r\nthe working classes, the recurring paroxysms of industrial depression,\r\nthe scarcity of employment, the stagnation of capital, the tendency of\r\nwages to the starvation point, that exhibit themselves more and more\r\nstrongly as material progress goes on, to the fact that the land on\r\nwhich and from which all must live is made the exclusive property of\r\nsome.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there is no possible remedy for these evils but\r\nthe abolition of their cause; we have seen that private property in\r\nland has no warrant in justice, but stands condemned as the denial\r\nof natural right—a subversion of the law of nature that as social\r\ndevelopment goes on must condemn the masses of men to a slavery the\r\nhardest and most degrading.\r\n\r\nWe have weighed every objection, and seen that neither on the ground\r\nof equity or expediency is there anything to deter us from making land\r\ncommon property by confiscating rent.\r\n\r\nBut a question of method remains. How shall we do it?\r\n\r\nWe should satisfy the law of justice, we should meet all economic\r\nrequirements, by at one stroke abolishing all private titles, declaring\r\nall land public property, and letting it out to the highest bidders in\r\nlots to suit, under such conditions as would sacredly guard the private\r\nright to improvements.\r\n\r\nThus we should secure, in a more complex state of society, the\r\nsame equality of rights that in a ruder state were secured by equal\r\npartitions of the soil, and by giving the use of the land to whoever\r\ncould procure the most from it, we should secure the greatest\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nSuch a plan, instead of being a wild, impracticable vagary, has (with\r\nthe exception that he suggests compensation to the present holders of\r\nland—undoubtedly a careless concession which he upon reflection would\r\nreconsider) been indorsed by no less eminent a thinker than Herbert\r\nSpencer, who (“Social Statics,” Chap. IX, Sec. 8) says of it:\r\n\r\n “Such a doctrine is consistent with the highest state of civilization;\r\n may be carried out without involving a community of goods, and need\r\n cause no very serious revolution in existing arrangements. The change\r\n required would simply be a change of landlords. Separate ownership\r\n would merge into the joint-stock ownership of the public. Instead of\r\n being in the possession of individuals, the country would be held\r\n by the great corporate body—society. Instead of leasing his acres\r\n from an isolated proprietor, the farmer would lease them from the\r\n nation. Instead of paying his rent to the agent of Sir John or his\r\n Grace, he would pay it to an agent or deputy agent of the community.\r\n Stewards would be public officials instead of private ones, and\r\n tenancy the only land tenure. A state of things so ordered would be\r\n in perfect harmony with the moral law. Under it all men would be\r\n equally landlords, all men would be alike free to become tenants. * *\r\n * Clearly, therefore, on such a system, the earth might be enclosed,\r\n occupied and cultivated, in entire subordination to the law of equal\r\n freedom.”\r\n\r\nBut such a plan, though perfectly feasible, does not seem to me the\r\nbest. Or rather I propose to accomplish the same thing in a simpler,\r\neasier, and quieter way, than that of formally confiscating all the\r\nland and formally letting it out to the highest bidders.\r\n\r\nTo do that would involve a needless shock to present customs and habits\r\nof thought—which is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nTo do that would involve a needless extension of governmental\r\nmachinery—which is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of\r\ntyranny have understood and acted upon—that great changes can best be\r\nbrought about under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the\r\nsame truth. It is the natural method. When nature would make a higher\r\ntype, she takes a lower one and develops it. This, also, is the law of\r\nsocial growth. Let us work by it. With the current we may glide fast\r\nand far. Against it, it is hard pulling and slow progress.\r\n\r\nI do not propose either to purchase or to confiscate private property\r\nin land. The first would be unjust; the second, needless. Let the\r\nindividuals who now hold it still retain, if they want to, possession\r\nof what they are pleased to call _their_ land. Let them continue to\r\ncall it _their_ land. Let them buy and sell, and bequeath and devise\r\nit. We may safely leave them the shell, if we take the kernel. _It is\r\nnot necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary to confiscate\r\nrent._\r\n\r\nNor to take rent for public uses is it necessary that the State\r\nshould bother with the letting of lands, and assume the chances of\r\nthe favoritism, collusion, and corruption this might involve. It is\r\nnot necessary that any new machinery should be created. The machinery\r\nalready exists. Instead of extending it, all we have to do is to\r\nsimplify and reduce it. By leaving to land owners a percentage of rent\r\nwhich would probably be much less than the cost and loss involved in\r\nattempting to rent lands through State agency, and by making use of\r\nthis existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert the\r\ncommon right to land by taking rent for public uses.\r\n\r\nWe already take some rent in taxation. We have only to make some\r\nchanges in our modes of taxation to take it all.\r\n\r\nWhat I, therefore, propose, as the simple yet sovereign remedy,\r\nwhich will raise wages, increase the earnings of capital, extirpate\r\npauperism, abolish poverty, give remunerative employment to whoever\r\nwishes it, afford free scope to human powers, lessen crime, elevate\r\nmorals, and taste, and intelligence, purify government and carry\r\ncivilization to yet nobler heights, is—_to appropriate rent by\r\ntaxation_.\r\n\r\nIn this way the State may become the universal landlord without calling\r\nherself so, and without assuming a single new function. In form, the\r\nownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land need be\r\ndispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount of land\r\nany one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes, land,\r\nno matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held, would\r\nbe really common property, and every member of the community would\r\nparticipate in the advantages of its ownership.\r\n\r\nNow, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily\r\nbe increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition\r\ninto practical form by proposing—\r\n\r\n_To abolish all taxation save that upon land values._\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society\r\nnothing, but as society develops by the increase of population and the\r\nadvance of the arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized\r\ncountry, even the newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is\r\nsufficient to bear the entire expenses of government. In the better\r\ndeveloped countries it is much more than sufficient. Hence it will not\r\nbe enough merely to place all taxes upon the value of land. It will\r\nbe necessary, where rent exceeds the present governmental revenues,\r\ncommensurately to increase the amount demanded in taxation, and to\r\ncontinue this increase as society progresses and rent advances. But\r\nthis is so natural and easy a matter, that it may be considered as\r\ninvolved, or at least understood, in the proposition to put all taxes\r\non the value of land. That is the first step, upon which the practical\r\nstruggle must be made. When the hare is once caught and killed, cooking\r\nhim will follow as a matter of course. When the common right to land is\r\nso far appreciated that all taxes are abolished save those which fall\r\nupon rent, there is no danger of much more than is necessary to induce\r\nthem to collect the public revenues being left to individual land\r\nholders.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught me (for I have been for some years endeavoring to\r\npopularize this proposition) that wherever the idea of concentrating\r\nall taxation upon land values finds lodgment sufficient to induce\r\nconsideration, it invariably makes way, but that there are few of the\r\nclasses most to be benefited by it, who at first, or even for a long\r\ntime afterward, see its full significance and power. It is difficult\r\nfor workingmen to get over the idea that there is a real antagonism\r\nbetween capital and labor. It is difficult for small farmers and\r\nhomestead owners to get over the idea that to put all taxes on the\r\nvalue of land would be unduly to tax them. It is difficult for both\r\nclasses to get over the idea that to exempt capital from taxation would\r\nbe to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. These ideas spring\r\nfrom confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice there is a\r\npowerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature, education,\r\nand opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong which\r\nin every civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty and\r\nwant, will not die without a bitter struggle.\r\n\r\nI do not think the ideas of which I speak can be entertained by the\r\nreader who has followed me thus far; but inasmuch as any popular\r\ndiscussion must deal with the concrete, rather than with the abstract,\r\nlet me ask him to follow me somewhat further, that we may try the\r\nremedy I have proposed by the accepted canons of taxation. In doing\r\nso, many incidental bearings may be seen that otherwise might escape\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSITION TRIED BY THE CANONS OF TAXATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that\r\nwhich will closest conform to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. That it bear as lightly as possible upon production—so as least to\r\ncheck the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid\r\nand the community maintained.\r\n\r\n2. That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may\r\nbe upon the ultimate payers—so as to take from the people as little as\r\npossible in addition to what it yields the government.\r\n\r\n3. That it be certain—so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny\r\nor corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to\r\nlaw-breaking and evasion on the part of the taxpayers.\r\n\r\n4. That it bear equally—so as to give no citizen an advantage or put\r\nany at a disadvantage, as compared with others.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what form of taxation best accords with these\r\nconditions. Whatever it be, that evidently will be the best mode in\r\nwhich the public revenues can be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.—The Effect of Taxes upon Production._\r\n\r\nAll taxes must evidently come from the produce of land and labor,\r\nsince there is no other source of wealth than the union of human\r\nexertion with the material and forces of nature. But the manner in\r\nwhich equal amounts of taxation may be imposed may very differently\r\naffect the production of wealth. Taxation which lessens the reward of\r\nthe producer necessarily lessens the incentive to production; taxation\r\nwhich is conditioned upon the act of production, or the use of any of\r\nthe three factors of production, necessarily discourages production.\r\nThus taxation which diminishes the earnings of the laborer or the\r\nreturns of the capitalist tends to render the one less industrious\r\nand intelligent, the other less disposed to save and invest. Taxation\r\nwhich falls upon the processes of production interposes an artificial\r\nobstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation which falls upon labor\r\n_as_ it is exerted, wealth _as_ it is used as capital, and _as_ it is\r\ncultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production much more\r\npowerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers,\r\nwhether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or\r\nunproductively, or upon land whether cultivated or left waste.\r\n\r\nThe mode of taxation is, in fact, quite as important as the amount.\r\nAs a small burden badly placed may distress a horse that could carry\r\nwith ease a much larger one properly adjusted, so a people may be\r\nimpoverished and their power of producing wealth destroyed by taxation,\r\nwhich, if levied in another way, could be borne with ease. A tax on\r\ndate-trees, imposed by Mohammed Ali, caused the Egyptian fellahs to cut\r\ndown their trees; but a tax of twice the amount imposed on the land\r\nproduced no such result. The tax of ten per cent. on all sales, imposed\r\nby the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, would, had it been maintained,\r\nhave all but stopped exchange while yielding but little revenue.\r\n\r\nBut we need not go abroad for illustrations. The production of wealth\r\nin the United States is largely lessened by taxation which bears upon\r\nits processes. Ship-building, in which we excelled, has been all but\r\ndestroyed, so far as the foreign trade is concerned, and many branches\r\nof production and exchange seriously crippled, by taxes which divert\r\nindustry from more to less productive forms.\r\n\r\nThis checking of production is in greater or less degree characteristic\r\nof most of the taxes by which the revenues of modern governments are\r\nraised. All taxes upon manufactures, all taxes upon commerce, all taxes\r\nupon capital, all taxes upon improvements, are of this kind. Their\r\ntendency is the same as that of Mohammed Ali’s tax on date-trees,\r\nthough their effect may not be so clearly seen.\r\n\r\nAll such taxes have a tendency to reduce the production of wealth, and\r\nshould, therefore, never be resorted to when it is possible to raise\r\nmoney by taxes which do not check production. This becomes possible\r\nas society develops and wealth accumulates. Taxes which fall upon\r\nostentation would simply turn into the public treasury what otherwise\r\nwould be wasted in vain show for the sake of show; and taxes upon wills\r\nand devises of the rich would probably have little effect in checking\r\nthe desire for accumulation, which, after it has fairly got hold of a\r\nman, becomes a blind passion. But the great class of taxes from which\r\nrevenue may be derived without interference with production are taxes\r\nupon monopolies—for the profit of monopoly is in itself a tax levied\r\nupon production, and to tax it is simply to divert into the public\r\ncoffers what production must in any event pay.\r\n\r\nThere are among us various sorts of monopolies. For instance, there\r\nare the temporary monopolies created by the patent and copyright\r\nlaws. These it would be extremely unjust and unwise to tax, inasmuch\r\nas they are but recognitions of the right of labor to its intangible\r\nproductions, and constitute a reward held out to invention and\r\nauthorship.[55] There are also the onerous monopolies alluded to in\r\nChapter IV of Book III, which result from the aggregation of capital in\r\nbusinesses which are of the nature of monopolies. But while it would\r\nbe extremely difficult, if not altogether impossible, to levy taxes\r\nby general law so that they would fall exclusively on the returns of\r\nsuch monopoly and not become taxes on production or exchange, it is\r\nmuch better that these monopolies should be abolished. In large part\r\nthey spring from legislative commission or omission, as, for instance,\r\nthe ultimate reason that San Francisco merchants are compelled to\r\npay more for goods sent direct from New York to San Francisco by the\r\nIsthmus route than it costs to ship them from New York to Liverpool\r\nor Southampton and thence to San Francisco, is to be found in the\r\n“protective” laws which make it so costly to build American steamers\r\nand which forbid foreign steamers to carry goods between American\r\nports. The reason that residents of Nevada are compelled to pay as\r\nmuch freight from the East as though their goods were carried to\r\nSan Francisco and back again, is that the authority which prevents\r\nextortion on the part of a hack driver is not exercised in respect to\r\na railroad company. And it may be said generally that businesses which\r\nare in their nature monopolies are properly part of the functions of\r\nthe State, and should be assumed by the State. There is the same reason\r\nwhy Government should carry telegraphic messages as that it should\r\ncarry letters; that railroads should belong to the public as that\r\ncommon roads should.\r\n\r\nBut all other monopolies are trivial in extent as compared with the\r\nmonopoly of land. And the value of land expressing a monopoly, pure and\r\nsimple, is in every respect fitted for taxation. That is to say, while\r\nthe value of a railroad or telegraph line, the price of gas or of a\r\npatent medicine, may express the price of monopoly, it also expresses\r\nthe exertion of labor and capital; but the value of land, or economic\r\nrent, as we have seen, is in no part made up from these factors, and\r\nexpresses nothing but the advantage of appropriation. Taxes levied upon\r\nthe value of land cannot check production in the slightest degree,\r\nuntil they exceed rent, or the value of land taken annually, for\r\nunlike taxes upon commodities, or exchange, or capital, or any of the\r\ntools or processes of production, they do not bear upon production. The\r\nvalue of land does not express the reward of production, as does the\r\nvalue of crops, of cattle, of buildings, or any of the things which are\r\nstyled personal property and improvements. It expresses the exchange\r\nvalue of monopoly. It is not in any case the creation of the individual\r\nwho owns the land; it is created by the growth of the community.\r\nHence the community can take it all without in any way lessening the\r\nincentive to improvement or in the slightest degree lessening the\r\nproduction of wealth. Taxes may be imposed upon the value of land until\r\nall rent is taken by the State, without reducing the wages of labor\r\nor the reward of capital one iota; without increasing the price of a\r\nsingle commodity, or making production in any way more difficult.\r\n\r\nBut more than this. Taxes on the value of land not only do not\r\ncheck production as do most other taxes, but they tend to increase\r\nproduction, by destroying speculative rent. How speculative rent checks\r\nproduction may be seen not only in the valuable land withheld from use,\r\nbut in the paroxysms of industrial depression which, originating in\r\nthe speculative advance in land values, propagate themselves over the\r\nwhole civilized world, everywhere paralyzing industry, and causing more\r\nwaste and probably more suffering than would a general war. Taxation\r\nwhich would take rent for public uses would prevent all this; while if\r\nland were taxed to anything near its rental value, no one could afford\r\nto hold land that he was not using, and, consequently, land not in\r\nuse would be thrown open to those who would use it. Settlement would\r\nbe closer, and, consequently, labor and capital would be enabled to\r\nproduce much more with the same exertion. The dog in the manger who, in\r\nthis country especially, so wastes productive power, would be choked\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThere is yet an even more important way by which, through its effect\r\nupon distribution, the taking of rent to public uses by taxation would\r\nstimulate the production of wealth. But reference to that may be\r\nreserved. It is sufficiently evident that with regard to production,\r\nthe tax upon the value of land is the best tax that can be imposed.\r\nTax manufactures, and the effect is to check manufacturing; tax\r\nimprovements, and the effect is to lessen improvement; tax commerce,\r\nand the effect is to prevent exchange; tax capital, and the effect\r\nis to drive it away. But the whole value of land may be taken in\r\ntaxation, and the only effect will be to stimulate industry, to open\r\nnew opportunities to capital, and to increase the production of wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.—As to Ease and Cheapness of Collection._\r\n\r\nWith, perhaps, the exception of certain licenses and stamp duties,\r\nwhich may be made almost to collect themselves, but which can be relied\r\non for only a trivial amount of revenue, a tax upon land values can,\r\nof all taxes, be most easily and cheaply collected. For land cannot be\r\nhidden or carried off; its value can be readily ascertained, and the\r\nassessment once made, nothing but a receiver is required for collection.\r\n\r\nAnd as under all fiscal systems some part of the public revenues is\r\ncollected from taxes on land, and the machinery for that purpose\r\nalready exists and could as well be made to collect all as a part, the\r\ncost of collecting the revenue now obtained by other taxes might be\r\nentirely saved by substituting the tax on land values for all other\r\ntaxes. What an enormous saving might thus be made can be inferred from\r\nthe horde of officials now engaged in collecting these taxes.\r\n\r\nThis saving would largely reduce the difference between what taxation\r\nnow costs the people and what it yields, but the substitution of a\r\ntax on land values for all other taxes would operate to reduce this\r\ndifference in an even more important way.\r\n\r\nA tax on land values does not add to prices, and is thus paid directly\r\nby the persons on whom it falls; whereas, all taxes upon things of\r\nunfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of exchange are\r\nshifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go. If we impose a tax\r\nupon money loaned, as has been often attempted, the lender will charge\r\nthe tax to the borrower, and the borrower must pay it or not obtain the\r\nloan. If the borrower uses it in his business, he in his turn must get\r\nback the tax from his customers, or his business becomes unprofitable.\r\nIf we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must finally\r\npay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until building rents\r\nbecome high enough to pay the regular profit and the tax besides. If\r\nwe impose a tax upon manufactures or imported goods, the manufacturer\r\nor importer will charge it in a higher price to the jobber, the jobber\r\nto the retailer, and the retailer to the consumer. Now, the consumer,\r\non whom the tax thus ultimately falls, must not only pay the amount of\r\nthe tax, but also a profit on this amount to every one who has thus\r\nadvanced it—for profit on the capital he has advanced in paying taxes\r\nis as much required by each dealer as profit on the capital he has\r\nadvanced in paying for goods. Manila cigars cost, when bought of the\r\nimporter in San Francisco, $70 a thousand, of which $14 is the cost of\r\nthe cigars laid down in this port and $56 is the customs duty. But the\r\ndealer who purchases these cigars to sell again must charge a profit,\r\nnot on $14, the real cost of the cigars, but on $70, the cost of the\r\ncigars plus the duty. In this way all taxes which add to prices are\r\nshifted from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately\r\nrest upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the\r\ngovernment. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost\r\nof production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human\r\nproduction, and taxes upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though\r\na tax on rent compels the land owners to pay more, it gives them no\r\npower to obtain more for the use of their land, as it in no way tends\r\nto reduce the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling those who\r\nhold land on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on\r\nland values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus\r\nto reduce the price of land.\r\n\r\nThus in all respects a tax upon land values is the cheapest tax by\r\nwhich a large revenue can be raised—giving to the government the\r\nlargest net revenue in proportion to the amount taken from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.—As to Certainty._\r\n\r\nCertainty is an important element in taxation, for just as the\r\ncollection of a tax depends upon the diligence and faithfulness of the\r\ncollectors and the public spirit and honesty of those who are to pay\r\nit, will opportunities for tyranny and corruption be opened on the one\r\nside, and for evasions and frauds on the other.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which the bulk of our revenues are collected are\r\ncondemned on this ground, if on no other. The gross corruptions and\r\nfraud occasioned in the United States by the whisky and tobacco taxes\r\nare well known; the constant undervaluations of the Custom House, the\r\nridiculous untruthfulness of income tax returns, and the absolute\r\nimpossibility of getting anything like a just valuation of personal\r\nproperty, are matters of notoriety. The material loss which such taxes\r\ninflict—the item of cost which this uncertainty adds to the amount\r\npaid by the people but not received by the government—is very great.\r\nWhen, in the days of the protective system of England, her coasts\r\nwere lined with an army of men endeavoring to prevent smuggling, and\r\nanother army of men were engaged in evading them, it is evident that\r\nthe maintenance of both armies had to come from the produce of labor\r\nand capital; that the expenses and profits of the smugglers, as well as\r\nthe pay and bribes of the Custom House officers, constituted a tax upon\r\nthe industry of the nation, in addition to what was received by the\r\ngovernment. And so, all douceurs to assessors; all bribes to customs\r\nofficials; all moneys expended in electing pliable officers or in\r\nprocuring acts or decisions which avoid taxation; all the costly modes\r\nof bringing in goods so as to evade duties, and of manufacturing so as\r\nto evade imposts; all moieties, and expenses of detectives and spies;\r\nall expenses of legal proceedings and punishments, not only to the\r\ngovernment, but to those prosecuted, are so much which these taxes take\r\nfrom the general fund of wealth, without adding to the revenue.\r\n\r\nYet this is the least part of the cost. Taxes which lack the element\r\nof certainty tell most fearfully upon morals. Our revenue laws as a\r\nbody might well be entitled, “Acts to promote the corruption of public\r\nofficials, to suppress honesty and encourage fraud, to set a premium\r\nupon perjury and the subornation of perjury, and to divorce the idea\r\nof law from the idea of justice.” This is their true character, and\r\nthey succeed admirably. A Custom House oath is a by-word; our assessors\r\nregularly swear to assess all property at its full, true, cash value,\r\nand habitually do nothing of the kind; men who pride themselves on\r\ntheir personal and commercial honor bribe officials and make false\r\nreturns; and the demoralizing spectacle is constantly presented of the\r\nsame court trying a murderer one day and a vendor of unstamped matches\r\nthe next!\r\n\r\nSo uncertain and so demoralizing are these modes of taxation that the\r\nNew York Commission, composed of David A. Wells, Edwin Dodge and George\r\nW. Cuyler, who investigated the subject of taxation in that State,\r\nproposed to substitute for most of the taxes now levied, other than\r\nthat on real estate, an arbitrary tax on each individual, estimated on\r\nthe rental value of the premises he occupied.\r\n\r\nBut there is no necessity of resorting to any arbitrary assessment. The\r\ntax on land values, which is the least arbitrary of taxes, possesses\r\nin the highest degree the element of certainty. It may be assessed\r\nand collected with a definiteness that partakes of the immovable and\r\nunconcealable character of the land itself. Taxes levied on land may\r\nbe collected to the last cent, and though the assessment of land\r\nis now often unequal, yet the assessment of personal property is\r\nfar more unequal, and these inequalities in the assessment of land\r\nlargely arise from the taxation of improvements with land, and from\r\nthe demoralization that, springing from the causes to which I have\r\nreferred, affects the whole scheme of taxation. Were all taxes placed\r\nupon land values, irrespective of improvements, the scheme of taxation\r\nwould be so simple and clear, and public attention would be so directed\r\nto it, that the valuation of taxation could and would be made with\r\nthe same certainty that a real estate agent can determine the price a\r\nseller can get for a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.—As to Equality._\r\n\r\nAdam Smith’s canon is, that “The subjects of every state ought to\r\ncontribute toward the support of the government as nearly as possible\r\nin proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion\r\nto the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of\r\nthe state.” Every tax, he goes on to say, which falls only upon rent,\r\nor only upon wages, or only upon interest, is necessarily unequal. In\r\naccordance with this is the common idea which our systems of taxing\r\neverything vainly attempt to carry out—that every one should pay taxes\r\nin proportion to his means, or in proportion to his income.\r\n\r\nBut, waiving all the insuperable practical difficulties in the way of\r\ntaxing every one according to his means, it is evident that justice\r\ncannot be thus attained.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, are two men of equal means, or equal incomes, one\r\nhaving a large family, the other having no one to support but himself.\r\nUpon these two men indirect taxes fall very unequally, as the one\r\ncannot avoid the taxes on the food, clothing, etc., consumed by his\r\nfamily, while the other need pay only upon the necessaries consumed by\r\nhimself. But, supposing taxes levied directly, so that each pays the\r\nsame amount. Still there is injustice. The income of the one is charged\r\nwith the support of six, eight, or ten persons; the income of the other\r\nwith that of but a single person. And unless the Malthusian doctrine be\r\ncarried to the extent of regarding the rearing of a new citizen as an\r\ninjury to the state, here is a gross injustice.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that this is a difficulty which cannot be got over;\r\nthat it is Nature herself that brings human beings helpless into\r\nthe world and devolves their support upon the parents, providing in\r\ncompensation therefor her own sweet and great rewards. Very well, then,\r\nlet us turn to Nature, and read the mandates of justice in her law.\r\n\r\nNature gives to labor; and to labor alone. In a very Garden of Eden\r\na man would starve but for human exertion. Now, here are two men of\r\nequal incomes—that of the one derived from the exertion of his labor,\r\nthat of the other from the rent of land. Is it just that they should\r\nequally contribute to the expenses of the state? Evidently not. The\r\nincome of the one represents wealth he creates and adds to the general\r\nwealth of the state; the income of the other represents merely wealth\r\nthat he takes from the general stock, returning nothing. The right of\r\nthe one to the enjoyment of his income rests on the warrant of nature,\r\nwhich returns wealth to labor; the right of the other to the enjoyment\r\nof his income is a mere fictitious right, the creation of municipal\r\nregulation, which is unknown and unrecognized by nature. The father\r\nwho is told that from his labor he must support his children must\r\nacquiesce, for such is the natural decree; but he may justly demand\r\nthat from the income gained by his labor not one penny shall be taken,\r\nso long as a penny remains of incomes which are gained by a monopoly of\r\nthe natural opportunities which Nature offers impartially to all, and\r\nin which his children have as their birthright an equal share.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith speaks of incomes as “enjoyed under the protection of the\r\nstate;” and this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all\r\nspecies of property is commonly insisted upon—that it is equally\r\nprotected by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the\r\nenjoyment of property is made possible by the state—that there is a\r\nvalue created and maintained by the community, which is justly called\r\nupon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?\r\nOnly of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until\r\na community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the\r\ngrowth of the community. It exists only as the community exists.\r\nScatter again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would\r\nhave no value at all. With every increase of population the value of\r\nland rises; with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else\r\nsave of things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature\r\nmonopolies.\r\n\r\nThe tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all\r\ntaxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar\r\nand valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit\r\nthey receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use of the\r\ncommunity, of that value which is the creation of the community. It\r\nis the application of the common property to common uses. When all\r\nrent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will\r\nthe equality ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an\r\nadvantage over any other citizen save as is given by his industry,\r\nskill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly earns.\r\nThen, but not till then, will labor get its full reward, and capital\r\nits natural return.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] Following the habit of confounding the exclusive right granted by\r\na patent and that granted by a copyright as recognitions of the right\r\nof labor to its intangible productions, I in this fell into error which\r\nI subsequently acknowledged and corrected in the _Standard_ of June\r\n23, 1888. The two things are not alike, but essentially different. The\r\ncopyright is not a right to the exclusive use of a fact, an idea, or\r\na combination, which by the natural law of property all are free to\r\nuse; but only to the labor expended in the thing itself. It does not\r\nprevent any one from using for himself the facts, the knowledge, the\r\nlaws or combinations for a similar production, but only from using\r\nthe identical form of the particular book or other production—the\r\nactual labor which has in short been expended in producing it. It\r\nrests therefore upon the natural, moral right of each one to enjoy the\r\nproducts of his own exertion, and involves no interference with the\r\nsimilar right of any one else to do likewise.\r\n\r\nThe patent, on the other hand, prohibits any one from doing a similar\r\nthing, and involves, usually for a specified time, an interference\r\nwith the equal liberty on which the right of ownership rests. The\r\ncopyright is therefore in accordance with the moral law—it gives to\r\nthe man who has expended the intangible labor required to write a\r\nparticular book or paint a picture security against the copying of\r\nthat identical thing. The patent is in defiance of this natural right.\r\nIt prohibits others from doing what has been already attempted. Every\r\none has a moral right to think what I think, or to perceive what I\r\nperceive, or to do what I do—no matter whether he gets the hint from me\r\nor independently of me. Discovery can give no right of ownership, for\r\nwhatever is discovered must have been already here to be discovered.\r\nIf a man make a wheelbarrow, or a book, or a picture, he has a moral\r\nright to that particular wheelbarrow, or book, or picture, but no right\r\nto ask that others be prevented from making similar things. Such a\r\nprohibition, though given for the purpose of stimulating discovery and\r\ninvention, really in the long run operates as a check upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENTS AND OBJECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grounds from which we have drawn the conclusion that the tax on\r\nland values or rent is the best method of raising public revenues have\r\nbeen admitted expressly or tacitly by all economists of standing, since\r\nthe determination of the nature and law of rent.\r\n\r\nRicardo says (Chap. X), “a tax on rent would fall wholly on landlords,\r\nand could not be shifted to any class of consumers,” for it “would\r\nleave unaltered the difference between the produce obtained from the\r\nleast productive land in cultivation and that obtained from land of\r\nevery other quality. * * * A tax on rent would not discourage the\r\ncultivation of fresh land, for such land pays no rent and would be\r\nuntaxed.”\r\n\r\nMcCulloch (Note XXIV to “Wealth of Nations”) declares that “in a\r\npractical point of view taxes on the rent of land are among the\r\nmost unjust and impolitic that can be imagined,” but he makes this\r\nassertion solely on the ground of his assumption that it is practically\r\nimpossible to distinguish in taxation between the sum paid for the use\r\nof the soil and that paid on account of the capital expended upon it.\r\nBut, supposing that this separation could be effected, he admits that\r\nthe sum paid to landlords for the use of the natural powers of the soil\r\nmight be entirely swept away by a tax without their having it in their\r\npower to throw any portion of the burden upon any one else, and without\r\naffecting the price of produce.\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill not only admits all this, but expressly declares the\r\nexpediency and justice of a peculiar tax on rent, asking what right\r\nthe landlords have to the accession of riches that comes to them from\r\nthe general progress of society without work, risk, or economizing on\r\ntheir part, and although he expressly disapproves of interfering with\r\ntheir claim to the present value of land, he proposes to take the whole\r\nfuture increase as belonging to society by natural right.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fawcett, in the little compendium of the writings of her husband,\r\nentitled “Political Economy for Beginners,” says: “The land tax,\r\nwhether small or great in amount, partakes of the nature of a rent paid\r\nby the owner of land to the state. In a great part of India the land is\r\nowned by the government and therefore the land tax is rent paid direct\r\nto the state. The economic perfection of this system of tenure may be\r\nreadily perceived.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, that rent should, both on grounds of expediency and justice,\r\nbe the peculiar subject of taxation, is involved in the accepted\r\ndoctrine of rent, and may be found in embryo in the works of all\r\neconomists who have accepted the law of Ricardo. That these principles\r\nhave not been pushed to their necessary conclusions, as I have pushed\r\nthem, evidently arises from the indisposition to endanger or offend the\r\nenormous interest involved in private ownership in land, and from the\r\nfalse theories in regard to wages and the cause of poverty which have\r\ndominated economic thought.\r\n\r\nBut there has been a school of economists who plainly perceived,\r\nwhat is clear to the natural perceptions of men when uninfluenced\r\nby habit—that the revenues of the common property, land, ought to\r\nbe appropriated to the common service. The French Economists of the\r\nlast century, headed by Quesnay and Turgot, proposed just what I\r\nhave proposed, that all taxation should be abolished save a tax upon\r\nthe value of land. As I am acquainted with the doctrines of Quesnay\r\nand his disciples only at second hand through the medium of the\r\nEnglish writers, I am unable to say how far his peculiar ideas as to\r\nagriculture being the only productive avocation, etc., are erroneous\r\napprehensions, or mere peculiarities of terminology. But of this I am\r\ncertain from the proposition in which his theory culminated—that he\r\nsaw the fundamental relation between land and labor which has since\r\nbeen lost sight of, and that he arrived at practical truth, though,\r\nit may be, through a course of defectively expressed reasoning. The\r\ncauses which leave in the hands of the landlord a “produce net” were\r\nby the Physiocrats no better explained than the suction of a pump was\r\nexplained by the assumption that nature abhors a vacuum, but the fact\r\nin its practical relations to social economy was recognized, and the\r\nbenefit which would result from the perfect freedom given to industry\r\nand trade by a substitution of a tax on rent for all the impositions\r\nwhich hamper and distort the application of labor was doubtless as\r\nclearly seen by them as it is by me. One of the things most to be\r\nregretted about the French Revolution is that it overwhelmed the\r\nideas of the Economists, just as they were gaining strength among\r\nthe thinking classes, and were apparently about to influence fiscal\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing anything of Quesnay or his doctrines, I have reached\r\nthe same practical conclusion by a route which cannot be disputed, and\r\nhave based it on grounds which cannot be questioned by the accepted\r\npolitical economy.\r\n\r\nThe only objection to the tax on rent or land values which is to be\r\nmet with in standard politico-economic works is one which concedes\r\nits advantages—for it is, that from the difficulty of separation, we\r\nmight, in taxing the rent of land, tax something else. McCulloch,\r\nfor instance, declares taxes on the rent of land to be impolitic\r\nand unjust because the return received for the natural and inherent\r\npowers of the soil cannot be clearly distinguished from the return\r\nreceived from improvements and meliorations, which might thus be\r\ndiscouraged. Macaulay somewhere says that if the admission of the\r\nattraction of gravitation were inimical to any considerable pecuniary\r\ninterest, there would not be wanting arguments against gravitation—a\r\ntruth of which this objection is an illustration. For admitting\r\nthat it is impossible invariably to separate the value of land from\r\nthe value of improvements, is this necessity of continuing to tax\r\n_some_ improvements any reason why we should continue to tax _all_\r\nimprovements? If it discourage production to tax values which labor and\r\ncapital have intimately combined with that of land, how much greater\r\ndiscouragement is involved in taxing not only these, but all the\r\nclearly distinguishable values which labor and capital create?\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, the value of land can always be readily\r\ndistinguished from the value of improvements. In countries like the\r\nUnited States there is much valuable land that has never been improved;\r\nand in many of the States the value of the land and the value of\r\nimprovements are habitually estimated separately by the assessors,\r\nthough afterward reunited under the term real estate. Nor where ground\r\nhas been occupied from immemorial times, is there any difficulty in\r\ngetting at the value of the bare land, for frequently the land is owned\r\nby one person and the buildings by another, and when a fire occurs\r\nand improvements are destroyed, a clear and definite value remains in\r\nthe land. In the oldest country in the world no difficulty whatever\r\ncan attend the separation, if all that be attempted is to separate\r\nthe value of the clearly distinguishable improvements, made within a\r\nmoderate period, from the value of the land, should they be destroyed.\r\nThis, manifestly, is all that justice or policy requires. Absolute\r\naccuracy is impossible in any system, and to attempt to separate all\r\nthat the human race has done from what nature originally provided would\r\nbe as absurd as impracticable. A swamp drained or a hill terraced by\r\nthe Romans constitutes now as much a part of the natural advantages of\r\nthe British Isles as though the work had been done by earthquake or\r\nglacier. The fact that after a certain lapse of time the value of such\r\npermanent improvements would be considered as having lapsed into that\r\nof the land, and would be taxed accordingly, could have no deterrent\r\neffect on such improvements, for such works are frequently undertaken\r\nupon leases for years. The fact is, that each generation builds and\r\nimproves for itself, and not for the remote future. And the further\r\nfact is, that each generation is heir, not only to the natural powers\r\nof the earth, but to all that remains of the work of past generations.\r\n\r\nAn objection of a different kind may however be made. It may be said\r\nthat where political power is diffused, it is highly desirable that\r\ntaxation should fall not on one class, such as land owners, but on\r\nall; in order that all who exercise political power may feel a proper\r\ninterest in economical government. Taxation and representation, it will\r\nbe said, cannot safely be divorced.\r\n\r\nBut however desirable it may be to combine with political power the\r\nconsciousness of public burdens, the present system certainly does not\r\nsecure it. Indirect taxes are largely raised from those who pay little\r\nor nothing consciously. In the United States the class is rapidly\r\ngrowing who not only feel no interest in taxation, but who have no\r\nconcern in good government. In our large cities elections are in great\r\nmeasure determined not by considerations of public interest, but by\r\nsuch influences as determined elections in Rome when the masses had\r\nceased to care for anything but bread and the circus.\r\n\r\nThe effect of substituting for the manifold taxes now imposed a single\r\ntax on the value of land would hardly lessen the number of conscious\r\ntaxpayers, for the division of land now held on speculation would\r\nmuch increase the number of land holders. But it would so equalize\r\nthe distribution of wealth as to raise even the poorest above that\r\ncondition of abject poverty in which public considerations have no\r\nweight; while it would at the same time cut down those overgrown\r\nfortunes which raise their possessors above concern in government. The\r\ndangerous classes politically are the very rich and very poor. It is\r\nnot the taxes that he is conscious of paying that gives a man a stake\r\nin the country, an interest in its government; it is the consciousness\r\nof feeling that he is an integral part of the community; that its\r\nprosperity is his prosperity, and its disgrace his shame. Let but the\r\ncitizen feel this; let him be surrounded by all the influences that\r\nspring from and cluster round a comfortable home, and the community may\r\nrely upon him, even to limb or to life. Men do not vote patriotically,\r\nany more than they fight patriotically, because of their payment of\r\ntaxes. Whatever conduces to the comfortable and independent material\r\ncondition of the masses will best foster public spirit, will make the\r\nultimate governing power more intelligent and more virtuous.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked: If the tax on land values is so advantageous\r\na mode of raising revenue, how is it that so many other taxes are\r\nresorted to in preference by all governments?\r\n\r\nThe answer is obvious: The tax on land values is the only tax of any\r\nimportance that does not distribute itself. It falls upon the owners of\r\nland, and there is no way in which they can shift the burden upon any\r\none else. Hence, a large and powerful class are directly interested in\r\nkeeping down the tax on land values and substituting, as a means for\r\nraising the required revenue, taxes on other things, just as the land\r\nowners of England, two hundred years ago, succeeded in establishing\r\nan excise, which fell on all consumers, for the dues under the feudal\r\ntenures, which fell only on them.\r\n\r\nThere is, thus, a definite and powerful interest opposed to the\r\ntaxation of land values; but to the other taxes upon which modern\r\ngovernments so largely rely there is no special opposition. The\r\ningenuity of statesmen has been exercised in devising schemes of\r\ntaxation which drain the wages of labor and the earnings of capital as\r\nthe vampire bat is said to suck the lifeblood of its victim. Nearly\r\nall of these taxes are ultimately paid by that indefinable being, the\r\nconsumer; and he pays them in a way which does not call his attention\r\nto the fact that he is paying a tax—pays them in such small amounts and\r\nin such insidious modes that he does not notice it, and is not likely\r\nto take the trouble to remonstrate effectually. Those who pay the money\r\ndirectly to the tax collector are not only not interested in opposing a\r\ntax which they so easily shift from their own shoulders, but are very\r\nfrequently interested in its imposition and maintenance, as are other\r\npowerful interests which profit, or expect to profit, by the increase\r\nof prices which such taxes bring about.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the manifold taxes by which the people of the United\r\nStates are now burdened have been imposed rather with a view to\r\nprivate advantage than to the raising of revenue, and the great\r\nobstacle to the simplification of taxation is these private interests,\r\nwhose representatives cluster in the lobby whenever a reduction of\r\ntaxation is proposed, to see that the taxes by which they profit are\r\nnot reduced. The fastening of a protective tariff upon the United\r\nStates has been due to these influences, and not to the acceptance of\r\nabsurd theories of protection upon their own merits. The large revenue\r\nwhich the civil war rendered necessary was the golden opportunity of\r\nthese special interests, and taxes were piled up on every possible\r\nthing, not so much to raise revenue as to enable particular classes\r\nto participate in the advantages of tax-gathering and tax-pocketing.\r\nAnd, since the war, these interested parties have constituted the\r\ngreat obstacle to the reduction of taxation; those taxes which cost\r\nthe people least having, for this reason, been found easier to abolish\r\nthan those taxes which cost the people most. And, thus, even popular\r\ngovernments, which have for their avowed principle the securing of\r\nthe greatest good to the greatest number, are, in a most important\r\nfunction, used to secure a questionable good to a small number, at the\r\nexpense of a great evil to the many.\r\n\r\nLicense taxes are generally favored by those on whom they are imposed,\r\nas they tend to keep others from entering the business; imposts upon\r\nmanufactures are frequently grateful to large manufacturers for\r\nsimilar reasons, as was seen in the opposition of the distillers to\r\nthe reduction of the whisky tax; duties on imports not only tend to\r\ngive certain producers special advantages, but accrue to the benefit\r\nof importers or dealers who have large stocks on hand; and so, in the\r\ncase of all such taxes, there are particular interests, capable of\r\nready organization and concerted action, which favor the imposition of\r\nthe tax, while, in the case of a tax upon the value of land, there is a\r\nsolid and sensitive interest steadily and bitterly to oppose it.\r\n\r\nBut if once the truth which I am trying to make clear is understood by\r\nthe masses, it is easy to see how a union of political forces strong\r\nenough to carry it into practice becomes possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.—OF THE EFFECT UPON THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.—OF THE EFFECT UPON DISTRIBUTION AND THENCE UPON PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.—OF THE EFFECT UPON INDIVIDUALS AND CLASSES.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.—OF THE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE WROUGHT IN SOCIAL\r\n ORGANIZATION AND SOCIAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I cannot play upon any stringed instrument; but I can tell you how of\r\n a little village to make a great and glorious city.—_Themistocles._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the\r\n brier shall come up the myrtle tree.\r\n\r\n And they shall build houses and inhabit them; and they shall plant\r\n vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another\r\n inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat.—_Isaiah._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOF THE EFFECT UPON THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to\r\nsubstitute one single tax on rent (the _impôt unique_) for all other\r\ntaxes, as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or\r\nthe substitution of the use of money for barter.\r\n\r\nTo whomsoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an\r\nevidence of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages\r\nwhich would be gained by substituting for the numerous taxes by\r\nwhich the public revenues are now raised, a single tax levied upon\r\nthe value of land, will appear more and more important the more they\r\nare considered. This is the secret which would transform the little\r\nvillage into the great city. With all the burdens removed which now\r\noppress industry and hamper exchange, the production of wealth would\r\ngo on with a rapidity now undreamed of. This, in its turn, would lead\r\nto an increase in the value of land—a new surplus which society might\r\ntake for general purposes. And released from the difficulties which\r\nattend the collection of revenue in a way that begets corruption and\r\nrenders legislation the tool of special interests, society could assume\r\nfunctions which the increasing complexity of life makes it desirable to\r\nassume, but which the prospect of political demoralization under the\r\npresent system now leads thoughtful men to shrink from.\r\n\r\nConsider the effect upon the production of wealth.\r\n\r\nTo abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every\r\nwheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be\r\nlike removing an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with\r\nfresh energy, production would start into new life, and trade would\r\nreceive a stimulus which would be felt to the remotest arteries. The\r\npresent method of taxation operates upon exchange like artificial\r\ndeserts and mountains; it costs more to get goods through a custom\r\nhouse than it does to carry them around the world. It operates upon\r\nenergy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those\r\nqualities. If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while\r\nyou have been contented to live in a hovel, the tax-gatherer now comes\r\nannually to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by\r\ntaxing me more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct,\r\nwhile you are exempt. If a man build a ship we make him pay for his\r\ntemerity, as though he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad\r\nbe opened, down comes the tax-collector upon it, as though it were a\r\npublic nuisance; if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual\r\nsum which would go far toward making a handsome profit. We say we want\r\ncapital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among us, we charge\r\nhim for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We punish with a\r\ntax the man who covers barren fields with ripening grain; we fine him\r\nwho puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp. How heavily these\r\ntaxes burden production only those realize who have attempted to follow\r\nour system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have before\r\nsaid, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased\r\nprices. But manifestly these taxes are in their nature akin to the\r\nEgyptian Pasha’s tax upon date-trees. If they do not cause the trees to\r\nbe cut down, they at least discourage the planting.\r\n\r\nTo abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of\r\ntaxation from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the\r\ngreat manufactory; the cart-horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat\r\nand the steamship; the farmer’s plow and the merchant’s stock, would be\r\nalike untaxed. All would be free to make or to save, to buy or to sell,\r\nunfined by taxes, unannoyed by the tax-gatherer. Instead of saying to\r\nthe producer, as it does now, “The more you add to the general wealth\r\nthe more shall you be taxed!” the state would say to the producer, “Be\r\nas industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising as you choose, you shall\r\nhave your full reward! You shall not be fined for making two blades of\r\ngrass grow where one grew before; you shall not be taxed for adding to\r\nthe aggregate wealth.”\r\n\r\nAnd will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that\r\nlays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that\r\ntreadeth out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and\r\nskill, their natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the\r\ncommunity also a natural reward. The law of society is, each for all,\r\nas well as all for each. No one can keep to himself the good he may do,\r\nany more than he can keep the bad. Every productive enterprise, besides\r\nits return to those who undertake it, yields collateral advantages to\r\nothers. If a man plant a fruit-tree, his gain is that he gathers the\r\nfruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a\r\ngain to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by\r\nthe increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and\r\nwide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his field;\r\nand, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings a\r\nsense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,\r\na factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get\r\nthe direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is like the squirrel\r\nwho buries his nuts and refrains from digging them up again. Lo! they\r\nsprout and grow into trees. In fine linen, steeped in costly spices,\r\nthe mummy is laid away. Thousands and thousands of years thereafter,\r\nthe Bedouin cooks his food by a fire of its encasings, it generates the\r\nsteam by which the traveler is whirled on his way, or it passes into\r\nfar-off lands to gratify the curiosity of another race. The bee fills\r\nthe hollow tree with honey, and along comes the bear or the man.\r\n\r\nWell may the community leave to the individual producer all that\r\nprompts him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full\r\nreward of his labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital.\r\nFor the more that labor and capital produce, the greater grows the\r\ncommon wealth in which all may share. And in the value or rent of land\r\nis this general gain expressed in a definite and concrete form. Here\r\nis a fund which the state may take while leaving to labor and capital\r\ntheir full reward. With increased activity of production this would\r\ncommensurately increase.\r\n\r\nAnd to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the\r\nvalue or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the\r\nproduction of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under\r\nthis system no one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land\r\nnow withheld from use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.\r\n\r\nThe selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive\r\nits deathblow; land monopolization would no longer pay. Millions and\r\nmillions of acres from which settlers are now shut out by high prices\r\nwould be abandoned by their present owners or sold to settlers upon\r\nnominal terms. And this not merely on the frontiers, but within what\r\nare now considered well settled districts. Within a hundred miles of\r\nSan Francisco would be thus thrown open land enough to support, even\r\nwith present modes of cultivation, an agricultural population equal\r\nto that now scattered from the Oregon boundary to the Mexican line—a\r\ndistance of 800 miles. In the same degree would this be true of most of\r\nthe Western States, and in a great degree of the older Eastern States,\r\nfor even in New York and Pennsylvania is population yet sparse as\r\ncompared with the capacity of the land. And even in densely populated\r\nEngland would such a policy throw open to cultivation many hundreds\r\nof thousands of acres now held as private parks, deer preserves, and\r\nshooting grounds.\r\n\r\nFor this simple device of placing all taxes on the value of land would\r\nbe in effect putting up the land at auction to whomsoever would pay the\r\nhighest rent to the state. The demand for land fixes its value, and\r\nhence, if taxes were placed so as very nearly to consume that value,\r\nthe man who wished to hold land without using it would have to pay very\r\nnearly what it would be worth to any one who wanted to use it.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to\r\nagricultural land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open\r\nto use, just as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one\r\ncould afford to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the\r\noutskirts to demand more for it than the use to which it could at the\r\ntime be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had attained a value,\r\ntaxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,\r\nwould operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or\r\nsowed a field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter\r\nhow costly, would have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much\r\nland idle. The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much\r\nas though his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and\r\nwith stock. The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much\r\nfor the privilege of keeping other people off of it until he wanted\r\nto use it, as his neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot. It would\r\ncost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable\r\nland as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great\r\nwarehouses filled with costly goods.\r\n\r\nThus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid\r\nbefore labor can be exerted would disappear. The farmer would not have\r\nto pay out half his means, or mortgage his labor for years, in order\r\nto obtain land to cultivate; the builder of a city homestead would not\r\nhave to lay out as much for a small lot as for the house he puts upon\r\nit; the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to\r\nexpend a great part of their capital for a site. And what would be paid\r\nfrom year to year to the state would be in lieu of all the taxes now\r\nlevied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.\r\n\r\nConsider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition\r\nwould no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing\r\nwith each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down\r\nwages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be\r\ncompeting for laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of\r\nlabor. For into the labor market would have entered the greatest of\r\nall competitors for the employment of labor, a competitor whose demand\r\ncannot be satisfied until want is satisfied—the demand of labor itself.\r\nThe employers of labor would not have merely to bid against other\r\nemployers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased\r\nprofits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own\r\nemployers upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the\r\ntax which prevented monopolization.\r\n\r\nWith natural opportunities thus free to labor; with capital and\r\nimprovements exempt from tax, and exchange released from restrictions,\r\nthe spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor into the things\r\nthey are suffering for would become impossible; the recurring paroxysms\r\nwhich paralyze industry would cease; every wheel of production would\r\nbe set in motion; demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with\r\ndemand; trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on\r\nevery hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE EFFECT UPON DISTRIBUTION AND THENCE UPON PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of\r\nall public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully\r\nappreciated until we consider the effect upon the distribution of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nTracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which\r\nappears in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater\r\nand greater inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it\r\nin the fact that, as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now\r\nin private hands, gives a greater and greater power of appropriating\r\nthe wealth produced by labor and capital.\r\n\r\nThus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and\r\nindirect, and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it\r\nwent, to counteract this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far\r\nas to take in taxation the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would\r\nbe totally destroyed. Rent, instead of causing inequality, as now,\r\nwould then promote equality. Labor and capital would then receive the\r\nwhole produce, minus that portion taken by the state in the taxation of\r\nland values, which, being applied to public purposes, would be equally\r\ndistributed in public benefits.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided\r\ninto two portions. One part would be distributed in wages and interest\r\nbetween individual producers, according to the part each had taken in\r\nthe work of production; the other part would go to the community as a\r\nwhole, to be distributed in public benefits to all its members. In\r\nthis all would share equally—the weak with the strong, young children\r\nand decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as\r\nthe vigorous. And justly so—for while one part represents the result\r\nof individual effort in production, the other represents the increased\r\npower with which the community as a whole aids the individual.\r\n\r\nThus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by\r\nthe community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to\r\nproduce inequality as material progress goes on would then tend to\r\nproduce greater and greater equality. Fully to understand this effect,\r\nlet us revert to principles previously worked out.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that wages and interest must everywhere be fixed by the\r\nrent line or margin of cultivation—that is to say, by the reward\r\nwhich labor and capital can secure on land for which no rent is paid;\r\nthat the aggregate amount of wealth, which the aggregate of labor and\r\ncapital employed in production will receive, will be the amount of\r\nwealth produced (or rather, when we consider taxes, the net amount),\r\nminus what is taken as rent.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that with material progress, as it is at present going\r\non, there is a twofold tendency to the advance of rent. Both are to\r\nthe increase of the proportion of the wealth produced which goes as\r\nrent, and to the decrease of the proportion which goes as wages and\r\ninterest. But the first, or natural tendency, which results from the\r\nlaws of social development, is to the increase of rent as a quantity,\r\nwithout the reduction of wages and interest as quantities, or even with\r\ntheir quantitative increase. The other tendency, which results from\r\nthe unnatural appropriation of land to private ownership, is to the\r\nincrease of rent as a quantity by the reduction of wages and interest\r\nas quantities.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that to take rent in taxation for public purposes,\r\nwhich virtually abolishes private ownership in land, would be to\r\ndestroy the tendency to an absolute decrease in wages and interest, by\r\ndestroying the speculative monopolization of land and the speculative\r\nincrease in rent. It would be very largely to increase wages and\r\ninterest, by throwing open natural opportunities now monopolized and\r\nreducing the price of land. Labor and capital would thus not merely\r\ngain what is now taken from them in taxation, but would gain by the\r\npositive decline in rent caused by the decrease in speculative land\r\nvalues. A new equilibrium would be established, at which the common\r\nrate of wages and interest would be much higher than now.\r\n\r\nBut this new equilibrium established, further advances in productive\r\npower, and the tendency in this direction would be greatly accelerated,\r\nwould result in still increasing rent, not at the expense of wages and\r\ninterest, but by new gains in production, which, as rent would be taken\r\nby the community for public uses, would accrue to the advantage of\r\nevery member of the community. Thus, as material progress went on, the\r\ncondition of the masses would constantly improve. Not merely one class\r\nwould become richer, but all would become richer; not merely one class\r\nwould have more of the necessaries, conveniences, and elegancies of\r\nlife, but all would have more. For, the increasing power of production,\r\nwhich comes with increasing population, with every new discovery in\r\nthe productive arts, with every labor-saving invention, with every\r\nextension and facilitation of exchanges, could be monopolized by none.\r\nThat part of the benefit which did not go directly to increase the\r\nreward of labor and capital would go to the state—that is to say, to\r\nthe whole community. With all the enormous advantages, material and\r\nmental, of a dense population, would be united the freedom and equality\r\nthat can now be found only in new and sparsely settled districts.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, consider how equalization in the distribution of wealth\r\nwould react upon production, everywhere preventing waste, everywhere\r\nincreasing power.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to express in figures the direct pecuniary loss\r\nwhich society suffers from the social mal-adjustments which condemn\r\nlarge classes to poverty and vice, the estimate would be appalling.\r\nEngland maintains over a million paupers on official charity; the\r\ncity of New York alone spends over seven million dollars a year in a\r\nsimilar way. But what is spent from public funds, what is spent by\r\ncharitable societies and what is spent in individual charity, would,\r\nif aggregated, be but the first and smallest item in the account. The\r\npotential earnings of the labor thus going to waste, the cost of the\r\nreckless, improvident and idle habits thus generated; the pecuniary\r\nloss, to consider nothing more, suggested by the appalling statistics\r\nof mortality, and especially infant mortality, among the poorer\r\nclasses; the waste indicated by the gin palaces or low groggeries\r\nwhich increase as poverty deepens; the damage done by the vermin\r\nof society that are bred of poverty and destitution—the thieves,\r\nprostitutes, beggars, and tramps; the cost of guarding society against\r\nthem, are all items in the sum which the present unjust and unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth takes from the aggregate which, with present\r\nmeans of production, society might enjoy. Nor yet shall we have\r\ncompleted the account. The ignorance and vice, the recklessness and\r\nimmorality engendered by the inequality in the distribution of wealth\r\nshow themselves in the imbecility and corruption of government; and the\r\nwaste of public revenues, and the still greater waste involved in the\r\nignorant and corrupt abuse of public powers and functions, are their\r\nlegitimate consequences.\r\n\r\nBut the increase in wages, and the opening of new avenues of employment\r\nwhich would result from the appropriation of rent to public purposes,\r\nwould not merely stop these wastes and relieve society of these\r\nenormous losses; new power would be added to labor. It is but a truism\r\nthat labor is most productive where its wages are largest. Poorly paid\r\nlabor is inefficient labor, the world over.\r\n\r\nWhat is remarked between the efficiency of labor in the agricultural\r\ndistricts of England where different rates of wages prevail; what\r\nBrassey noticed as between the work done by his better paid English\r\nnavvies and that done by the worse paid labor of the continent; what\r\nwas evident in the United States as between slave labor and free\r\nlabor; what is seen by the astonishing number of mechanics or servants\r\nrequired in India or China to get anything done, is universally true.\r\nThe efficiency of labor always increases with the habitual wages of\r\nlabor—for high wages mean increased self-respect, intelligence, hope,\r\nand energy. Man is not a machine, that will do so much and no more; he\r\nis not an animal, whose powers may reach thus far and no further. It is\r\nmind, not muscle, which is the great agent of production. The physical\r\npower evolved in the human frame is one of the weakest of forces, but\r\nfor the human intelligence the resistless currents of nature flow, and\r\nmatter becomes plastic to the human will. To increase the comforts,\r\nand leisure, and independence of the masses is to increase their\r\nintelligence; it is to bring the brain to the aid of the hand; it is\r\nto engage in the common work of life the faculty which measures the\r\nanimalcule and traces the orbits of the stars!\r\n\r\nWho can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity\r\nof labor may not be raised by social adjustments which will give\r\nto the producers of wealth their fair proportion of its advantages\r\nand enjoyments! With present processes the gain would be simply\r\nincalculable, but just as wages are high, so do the invention and\r\nutilization of improved processes and machinery go on with greater\r\nrapidity and ease. That the wheat crops of Southern Russia are\r\nstill reaped with the scythe and beaten out with the flail is simply\r\nbecause wages are there so low. American invention, American aptitude\r\nfor labor-saving processes and machinery are the result of the\r\ncomparatively high wages that have prevailed in the United States. Had\r\nour producers been condemned to the low reward of the Egyptian fellah\r\nor Chinese coolie, we would be drawing water by hand and transporting\r\ngoods on the shoulders of men. The increase in the reward of labor and\r\ncapital would still further stimulate invention and hasten the adoption\r\nof improved processes, and these would truly appear, what in themselves\r\nthey really are—an unmixed good. The injurious effects of labor-saving\r\nmachinery upon the working classes, that are now so often apparent, and\r\nthat, in spite of all argument, make so many people regard machinery as\r\nan evil instead of a blessing, would disappear. Every new power engaged\r\nin the service of man would improve the condition of all. And from the\r\ngeneral intelligence and mental activity springing from this general\r\nimprovement of condition would come new developments of power of which\r\nwe as yet cannot dream.\r\n\r\nBut I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that\r\nwhile thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor,\r\nthe equalization in the distribution of wealth that would result from\r\nthe simple plan of taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity\r\nwith which wealth is pursued. It seems to me that in a condition of\r\nsociety in which no one need fear poverty, no one would desire great\r\nwealth—at least, no one would take the trouble to strive and to strain\r\nfor it as men do now. For, certainly, the spectacle of men who have\r\nonly a few years to live, slaving away their time for the sake of dying\r\nrich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state of society\r\nwhere the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated the envious\r\nadmiration with which the masses of men now regard the possession of\r\ngreat riches, whoever would toil to acquire more than he cared to use\r\nwould be looked upon as we would now look on a man who would thatch\r\nhis head with half a dozen hats, or walk around in the hot sun with an\r\novercoat on. When every one is sure of being able to get enough, no one\r\nwill care to make a pack-horse of himself.\r\n\r\nAnd though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not\r\nspare it? Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage\r\nof development, it is not needed now. The dangers that menace\r\nour civilization do not come from the weakness of the springs of\r\nproduction. What it suffers from, and what, if a remedy be not applied,\r\nit must die from, is unequal distribution!\r\n\r\nNor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the\r\nstandpoint of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate\r\nof production is greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are\r\npursued, is one of the most obtrusive facts of modern society. While,\r\nwere this insane desire to get rich at any cost lessened, mental\r\nactivities now devoted to scraping together riches would be translated\r\ninto far higher spheres of usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF THE EFFECT UPON INDIVIDUALS AND CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, and\r\nthus confiscate rent, all land holders are likely to take the alarm,\r\nand there will not be wanting appeals to the fears of small farm and\r\nhomestead owners, who will be told that this is a proposition to rob\r\nthem of their hard-earned property. But a moment’s reflection will show\r\nthat this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests\r\nas land holders do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or\r\ncapitalists, or both. And further consideration will show that though\r\nthe large land holders may lose relatively, yet even in their case\r\nthere will be an absolute gain. For, the increase in production will\r\nbe so great that labor and capital will gain very much more than will\r\nbe lost to private land ownership, while in these gains, and in the\r\ngreater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the whole\r\ncommunity, including the land owners themselves, will share.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter I have gone over the question of what is due to\r\nthe present land holders, and have shown that they have no claim to\r\ncompensation. But there is still another ground on which we may dismiss\r\nall idea of compensation. They will not really be injured.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly\r\nbenefit all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of\r\nhead—laborers, operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of\r\nall sorts. It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those\r\nwho live partly by wages and partly by the earnings of their\r\ncapital—storekeepers, merchants, manufacturers, employing or\r\nundertaking producers and exchangers of all sorts—from the peddler or\r\ndrayman to the railroad or steamship owner—and it is likewise manifest\r\nthat it will increase the incomes of those whose incomes are drawn from\r\nthe earnings of capital, or from investments other than in lands, save\r\nperhaps the holders of government bonds or other securities bearing\r\nfixed rates of interest, which will probably depreciate in selling\r\nvalue, owing to the rise in the general rate of interest, though the\r\nincome from them will remain the same.\r\n\r\nTake, now, the case of the homestead owner—the mechanic, storekeeper,\r\nor professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he\r\nlives, and which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from\r\nwhich his family cannot be ejected in case of his death. He will not\r\nbe injured; on the contrary, he will be the gainer. The selling value\r\nof his lot will diminish—theoretically it will entirely disappear. But\r\nits usefulness to him will not disappear. It will serve his purpose as\r\nwell as ever. While, as the value of all other lots will diminish or\r\ndisappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security of always\r\nhaving a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only\r\nas the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be a\r\nloser by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be\r\njust as useful to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper.\r\nSo, to the homestead owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he\r\nlook forward to getting a larger lot, or having his children, as they\r\ngrow up, get homesteads of their own, he will, even in the matter of\r\nlots, be the gainer. And in the present, other things considered,\r\nhe will be much the gainer. For though he will have more taxes to\r\npay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house and\r\nimprovements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that\r\nhe and his family eat, drink, and wear, while his earnings will be\r\nlargely increased by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and\r\nthe increased briskness of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants\r\nto sell his lot without getting another, and this will be a small loss\r\ncompared with the great gain.\r\n\r\nAnd so with the farmer. I speak not now of the farmers who never touch\r\nthe handles of a plow, who cultivate thousands of acres and enjoy\r\nincomes like those of the rich Southern planters before the war; but\r\nof the working farmers who constitute such a large class in the United\r\nStates—men who own small farms, which they cultivate with the aid of\r\ntheir boys, and perhaps some hired help, and who in Europe would be\r\ncalled peasant proprietors. Paradoxical as it may appear to these\r\nmen until they understand the full bearings of the proposition, of\r\nall classes above that of the mere laborer they have most to gain by\r\nplacing all taxes upon the value of land. That they do not now get as\r\ngood a living as their hard work ought to give them, they generally\r\nfeel, though they may not be able to trace the cause. The fact is that\r\ntaxation, as now levied, falls on them with peculiar severity. They are\r\ntaxed on all their improvements—houses, barns, fences, crops, stock.\r\nThe personal property which they have cannot be as readily concealed\r\nor undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which are concentrated\r\nin the cities. They are not only taxed on personal property and\r\nimprovements, which the owners of unused land escape, but their land\r\nis generally taxed at a higher rate than land held on speculation,\r\nsimply because it is improved. But further than this, all taxes imposed\r\non commodities, and especially the taxes which, like our protective\r\nduties, are imposed with a view of raising the prices of commodities,\r\nfall on the farmer without mitigation. For in a country like the\r\nUnited States, which exports agricultural produce, the farmer cannot be\r\nprotected. Whoever gains, he must lose. Some years ago the Free Trade\r\nLeague of New York published a broadside containing cuts of various\r\narticles of necessity marked with the duties imposed by the tariff, and\r\nwhich read something in this wise: “The farmer rises in the morning\r\nand draws on his pantaloons taxed 40 per cent. and his boots taxed 30\r\nper cent., striking a light with a match taxed 200 per cent.,” and so\r\non, following him through the day and through life, until, killed by\r\ntaxation, he is lowered into the grave with a rope taxed 45 per cent.\r\nThis is but a graphic illustration of the manner in which such taxes\r\nultimately fall. The farmer would be a great gainer by the substitution\r\nof a single tax upon the value of land for all these taxes, for the\r\ntaxation of land values would fall with greatest weight, not upon the\r\nagricultural districts, where land values are comparatively small, but\r\nupon the towns and cities where land values are high; whereas taxes\r\nupon personal property and improvements fall as heavily in the country\r\nas in the city. And in sparsely settled districts there would be hardly\r\nany taxes at all for the farmer to pay. For taxes, being levied upon\r\nthe value of the bare land, would fall as heavily upon unimproved as\r\nupon improved land. Acre for acre, the improved and cultivated farm,\r\nwith its buildings, fences, orchard, crops, and stock could be taxed\r\nno more than unused land of equal quality. The result would be that\r\nspeculative values would be kept down, and that cultivated and improved\r\nfarms would have no taxes to pay until the country around them had been\r\nwell settled. In fact, paradoxical as it may at first seem to them,\r\nthe effect of putting all taxation upon the value of land would be to\r\nrelieve the harder working farmers of all taxation.\r\n\r\nBut the great gain of the working farmer can be seen only when the\r\neffect upon the distribution of population is considered. The\r\ndestruction of speculative land values would tend to diffuse population\r\nwhere it is too dense and to concentrate it where it is too sparse; to\r\nsubstitute for the tenement house, homes surrounded by gardens, and\r\nfully to settle agricultural districts before people were driven far\r\nfrom neighbors to look for land. The people of the cities would thus\r\nget more of the pure air and sunshine of the country, the people of the\r\ncountry more of the economies and social life of the city. If, as is\r\ndoubtless the case, the application of machinery tends to large fields,\r\nagricultural population will assume the primitive form and cluster in\r\nvillages. The life of the average farmer is now unnecessarily dreary.\r\nHe is not only compelled to work early and late, but he is cut off by\r\nthe sparseness of population from the conveniences, the amusements, the\r\neducational facilities, and the social and intellectual opportunities\r\nthat come with the closer contact of man with man. He would be far\r\nbetter off in all these respects, and his labor would be far more\r\nproductive, if he and those around him held no more land than they\r\nwanted to use.[56] While his children, as they grew up, would neither\r\nbe so impelled to seek the excitement of a city nor would they be\r\ndriven so far away to seek farms of their own. Their means of living\r\nwould be in their own hands, and at home.\r\n\r\nIn short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as\r\nwell as a land owner, and it is by his labor and capital that his\r\nliving is made. His loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nIn varying degrees is this true of all land holders. Many land\r\nholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would be hard to\r\nfind a land owner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist—while\r\nthe general rule is, that the larger the land owner the greater the\r\ncapitalist. So true is this that in common thought the characters are\r\nconfounded. Thus to put all taxes on the value of land, while it would\r\nbe largely to reduce all great fortunes, would in no case leave the\r\nrich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster, who owns a considerable\r\npart of the site of London, is probably the richest land owner in the\r\nworld. To take all his ground rents by taxation would largely reduce\r\nhis enormous income, but would still leave him his buildings and all\r\nthe income from them, and doubtless much personal property in various\r\nother shapes. He would still have all he could by any possibility\r\nenjoy, and a much better state of society in which to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nSo would the Astors of New York remain very rich. And so, I think, it\r\nwill be seen throughout—this measure would make no one poorer but such\r\nas could be made a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It\r\nwould cut down great fortunes, but it would impoverish no one.\r\n\r\nWealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally\r\ndistributed. I do not mean that each individual would get the same\r\namount of wealth. That would not be equal distribution, so long as\r\ndifferent individuals have different powers and different desires.\r\nBut I mean that wealth would be distributed in accordance with the\r\ndegree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence of each\r\ncontributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates\r\nwealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the\r\nhands of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued\r\nto exist would be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities\r\nproduced by the denial of natural law. The non-producer would no longer\r\nroll in luxury while the producer got but the barest necessities of\r\nanimal existence.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly of the land gone, there need be no fear of large fortunes.\r\nFor then the riches of any individual must consist of wealth, properly\r\nso-called—of wealth, which is the product of labor, and which\r\nconstantly tends to dissipation, for national debts, I imagine, would\r\nnot long survive the abolition of the system from which they spring.\r\nAll fear of great fortunes might be dismissed, for when every one gets\r\nwhat he fairly earns, no one can get more than he fairly earns. How\r\nmany men are there who fairly earn a million dollars?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] Besides the enormous increase in the productive power of labor\r\nwhich would result from the better distribution of population, there\r\nwould be also a similar economy in the productive power of land. The\r\nconcentration of population in cities fed by the exhaustive cultivation\r\nof large, sparsely populated areas, results in a literal draining into\r\nthe sea of the elements of fertility. How enormous this waste is may\r\nbe seen from the calculations that have been made as to the sewage of\r\nour cities, and its practical result is to be seen in the diminishing\r\nproductiveness of agriculture in large sections. In a great part of the\r\nUnited States we are steadily exhausting our lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE WROUGHT IN SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND SOCIAL\r\nLIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are dealing only with general principles. There are some matters\r\nof detail—such as those arising from the division of revenues between\r\nlocal and general governments—which upon application of these\r\nprinciples would come up, but these it is not necessary here to\r\ndiscuss. When once principles are settled, details will be readily\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nNor without too much elaboration is it possible to notice all the\r\nchanges which would be wrought, or would become possible, by a change\r\nwhich would readjust the very foundation of society, but to some main\r\nfeatures let me call attention.\r\n\r\nNoticeable among these is the great simplicity which would become\r\npossible in government. To collect taxes, to prevent and punish\r\nevasions, to check and countercheck revenues drawn from so many\r\ndistinct sources, now make up probably three-fourths, perhaps\r\nseven-eighths of the business of government, outside of the\r\npreservation of order, the maintenance of the military arm, and the\r\nadministration of justice. An immense and complicated network of\r\ngovernmental machinery would thus be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of justice there would be a like saving of\r\nstrain. Much of the civil business of our courts arises from disputes\r\nas to ownership of land. These would cease when the state was virtually\r\nacknowledged as the sole owner of land, and all occupiers became\r\npractically rent-paying tenants. The growth of morality consequent\r\nupon the cessation of want would tend to a like diminution in other\r\ncivil business of the courts, which could be hastened by the adoption\r\nof the common sense proposition of Bentham to abolish all laws for\r\nthe collection of debts and the enforcement of private contracts. The\r\nrise of wages, the opening of opportunities for all to make an easy\r\nand comfortable living, would at once lessen and would soon eliminate\r\nfrom society the thieves, swindlers, and other classes of criminals who\r\nspring from the unequal distribution of wealth. Thus the administration\r\nof the criminal law, with all its paraphernalia of policemen,\r\ndetectives, prisons, and penitentiaries, would, like the administration\r\nof the civil law, cease to make such a drain upon the vital force and\r\nattention of society. We should get rid, not only of many judges,\r\nbailiffs, clerks and prison keepers, but of the great host of lawyers\r\nwho are now maintained at the expense of producers; and talent now\r\nwasted in legal subtleties would be turned to higher pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe legislative, judicial, and executive functions of government would\r\nin this way be vastly simplified. Nor can I think that the public\r\ndebts and the standing armies, which are historically the outgrowth\r\nof the change from feudal to allodial tenures, would long remain\r\nafter the reversion to the old idea that the land of a country is the\r\ncommon right of the people of the country. The former could readily be\r\npaid off by a tax that would not lessen the wages of labor nor check\r\nproduction, and the latter the growth of intelligence and independence\r\namong the masses, aided, perhaps, by the progress of invention, which\r\nis revolutionizing the military art, must soon cause to disappear.\r\n\r\nSociety would thus approach the ideal of Jeffersonian democracy, the\r\npromised land of Herbert Spencer, the abolition of government. But of\r\ngovernment only as a directing and repressive power. It would at the\r\nsame time, and in the same degree, become possible for it to realize\r\nthe dream of socialism. All this simplification and abrogation of the\r\npresent functions of government would make possible the assumption\r\nof certain other functions which are now pressing for recognition.\r\nGovernment could take upon itself the transmission of messages by\r\ntelegraph, as well as by mail; of building and operating railroads,\r\nas well as of opening and maintaining common roads. With present\r\nfunctions so simplified and reduced, functions such as these could be\r\nassumed without danger or strain, and would be under the supervision\r\nof public attention, which is now distracted. There would be a great\r\nand increasing surplus revenue from the taxation of land values, for\r\nmaterial progress, which would go on with greatly accelerated rapidity,\r\nwould tend constantly to increase rent. This revenue arising from\r\nthe common property could be applied to the common benefit, as were\r\nthe revenues of Sparta. We might not establish public tables—they\r\nwould be unnecessary; but we could establish public baths, museums,\r\nlibraries, gardens, lecture rooms, music and dancing halls, theaters,\r\nuniversities, technical schools, shooting galleries, play grounds,\r\ngymnasiums, etc. Heat, light, and motive power, as well as water,\r\nmight be conducted through our streets at public expense; our roads\r\nbe lined with fruit trees; discoverers and inventors rewarded,\r\nscientific investigations supported; and in a thousand ways the\r\npublic revenues made to foster efforts for the public benefit. We\r\nshould reach the ideal of the socialist, but not through governmental\r\nrepression. Government would change its character, and would become the\r\nadministration of a great co-operative society. It would become merely\r\nthe agency by which the common property was administered for the common\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem impracticable? Consider for a moment the vast changes\r\nthat would be wrought in social life by a change which would assure to\r\nlabor its full reward; which would banish want and the fear of want;\r\nand give to the humblest freedom to develop in natural symmetry.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of the possibilities of social organization, we are apt to\r\nassume that greed is the strongest of human motives, and that systems\r\nof administration can be safely based only upon the idea that the fear\r\nof punishment is necessary to keep men honest—that selfish interests\r\nare always stronger than general interests. Nothing could be further\r\nfrom the truth.\r\n\r\nFrom whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men tread\r\neverything pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice all\r\nthe higher possibilities of life; which converts civility into a hollow\r\npretense, patriotism into a sham, and religion into hypocrisy; which\r\nmakes so much of civilized existence an Ishmaelitish warfare, of which\r\nthe weapons are cunning and fraud?\r\n\r\nDoes it not spring from the existence of want? Carlyle somewhere\r\nsays that poverty is the hell of which the modern Englishman is most\r\nafraid. And he is right. Poverty is the open-mouthed, relentless hell\r\nwhich yawns beneath civilized society. And it is hell enough. The\r\nVedas declare no truer thing than when the wise crow Bushanda tells\r\nthe eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest pain is in poverty. For\r\npoverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame, degradation; the\r\nsearing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and mental nature as\r\nwith hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses and the sweetest\r\naffections; the wrenching of the most vital nerves. You love your wife,\r\nyou love your children; but would it not be easier to see them die than\r\nto see them reduced to the pinch of want in which large classes in\r\nevery highly civilized community live? The strongest of animal passions\r\nis that with which we cling to life, but it is an everyday occurrence\r\nin civilized societies for men to put poison to their mouths or pistols\r\nto their heads from fear of poverty, and for one who does this there\r\nare probably a hundred who have the desire, but are restrained by\r\ninstinctive shrinking, by religious considerations, or by family ties.\r\n\r\nFrom this hell of poverty, it is but natural that men should make\r\nevery effort to escape. With the impulse to self-preservation and\r\nself-gratification combine nobler feelings, and love as well as fear\r\nurges in the struggle. Many a man does a mean thing, a dishonest thing,\r\na greedy and grasping and unjust thing, in the effort to place above\r\nwant, or the fear of want, mother or wife or children.\r\n\r\nAnd out of this condition of things arises a public opinion which\r\nenlists, as an impelling power in the struggle to grasp and to keep,\r\none of the strongest—perhaps with many men the very strongest—springs\r\nof human action. The desire for approbation, the feeling that urges\r\nus to win the respect, admiration, or sympathy of our fellows, is\r\ninstinctive and universal. Distorted sometimes into the most abnormal\r\nmanifestations, it may yet be everywhere perceived. It is potent\r\nwith the veriest savage, as with the most highly cultivated member\r\nof the most polished society; it shows itself with the first gleam\r\nof intelligence, and persists to the last breath. It triumphs over\r\nthe love of ease, over the sense of pain, over the dread of death. It\r\ndictates the most trivial and the most important actions.\r\n\r\nThe child just beginning to toddle or to talk will make new efforts\r\nas its cunning little tricks excite attention and laughter; the dying\r\nmaster of the world gathers his robes around him, that he may pass\r\naway as becomes a king; Chinese mothers will deform their daughters’\r\nfeet by cruel stocks, European women will sacrifice their own comfort\r\nand the comfort of their families to similar dictates of fashion; the\r\nPolynesian, that he may excite admiration by his beautiful tattoo,\r\nwill hold himself still while his flesh is torn by sharks’ teeth; the\r\nNorth American Indian, tied to the stake, will bear the most fiendish\r\ntortures without a moan, and, that he may be respected and admired as\r\na great brave, will taunt his tormentors to new cruelties. It is this\r\nthat leads the forlorn hope; it is this that trims the lamp of the pale\r\nstudent; it is this that impels men to strive, to strain, to toil, and\r\nto die. It is this that raised the pyramids and that fired the Ephesian\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nNow, men admire what they desire. How sweet to the storm-stricken seems\r\nthe safe harbor; food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, warmth to\r\nthe shivering, rest to the weary, power to the weak, knowledge to him\r\nin whom the intellectual yearnings of the soul have been aroused. And\r\nthus the sting of want and the fear of want make men admire above all\r\nthings the possession of riches, and to become wealthy is to become\r\nrespected, and admired, and influential. Get money—honestly, if you\r\ncan, but at any rate get money! This is the lesson that society is\r\ndaily and hourly dinning in the ears of its members. Men instinctively\r\nadmire virtue and truth, but the sting of want and the fear of want\r\nmake them even more strongly admire the rich and sympathize with the\r\nfortunate. It is well to be honest and just, and men will commend it;\r\nbut he who by fraud and injustice gets him a million dollars will have\r\nmore respect, and admiration, and influence, more eye service and lip\r\nservice, if not heart service, than he who refuses it. The one may have\r\nhis reward in the future; he may know that his name is writ in the\r\nBook of Life, and that for him is the white robe and the palm branch\r\nof the victor against temptation; but the other has his reward in the\r\npresent. His name is writ in the list of “our substantial citizens;”\r\nhe has the courtship of men and the flattery of women; the best pew\r\nin the church and the personal regard of the eloquent clergyman who\r\nin the name of Christ preaches the Gospel of Dives, and tones down\r\ninto a meaningless flower of Eastern speech the stern metaphor of the\r\ncamel and the needle’s eye. He may be a patron of arts, a Mæcenas to\r\nmen of letters; may profit by the converse of the intelligent, and be\r\npolished by the attrition of the refined. His alms may feed the poor,\r\nand help the struggling, and bring sunshine into desolate places; and\r\nnoble public institutions commemorate, after he is gone, his name and\r\nhis fame. It is not in the guise of a hideous monster, with horns and\r\ntail, that Satan tempts the children of men, but as an angel of light.\r\nHis promises are not alone of the kingdoms of the world, but of mental\r\nand moral principalities and powers. He appeals not only to the animal\r\nappetites, but to the cravings that stir in man because he is more than\r\nan animal.\r\n\r\nTake the case of those miserable “men with muckrakes,” who are to be\r\nseen in every community as plainly as Bunyan saw their type in his\r\nvision—who, long after they have accumulated wealth enough to satisfy\r\nevery desire, go on working, scheming, striving to add riches to\r\nriches. It was the desire “to be something;” nay, in many cases, the\r\ndesire to do noble and generous deeds, that started them on a career of\r\nmoney getting. And what compels them to it long after every possible\r\nneed is satisfied, what urges them still with unsatisfied and ravenous\r\ngreed, is not merely the force of tyrannous habit, but the subtler\r\ngratifications which the possession of riches gives—the sense of power\r\nand influence, the sense of being looked up to and respected, the sense\r\nthat their wealth not merely raises them above want, but makes them men\r\nof mark in the community in which they live. It is this that makes the\r\nrich man so loath to part with his money, so anxious to get more.\r\n\r\nAgainst temptations that thus appeal to the strongest impulses of our\r\nnature, the sanctions of law and the precepts of religion can effect\r\nbut little; and the wonder is, not that men are so self-seeking, but\r\nthat they are not much more so. That under present circumstances men\r\nare not more grasping, more unfaithful, more selfish than they are,\r\nproves the goodness and fruitfulness of human nature, the ceaseless\r\nflow of the perennial fountains from which its moral qualities are fed.\r\nAll of us have mothers; most of us have children, and so faith, and\r\npurity, and unselfishness can never be utterly banished from the world,\r\nhowsoever bad be social adjustments.\r\n\r\nBut whatever is potent for evil may be made potent for good. The change\r\nI have proposed would destroy the conditions that distort impulses in\r\nthemselves beneficent, and would transmute the forces which now tend to\r\ndisintegrate society into forces which would tend to unite and purify\r\nit.\r\n\r\nGive labor a free field and its full earnings; take for the benefit\r\nof the whole community that fund which the growth of the community\r\ncreates, and want and the fear of want would be gone. The springs of\r\nproduction would be set free, and the enormous increase of wealth would\r\ngive the poorest ample comfort. Men would no more worry about finding\r\nemployment than they worry about finding air to breathe; they need\r\nhave no more care about physical necessities than do the lilies of the\r\nfield. The progress of science, the march of invention, the diffusion\r\nof knowledge, would bring their benefits to all.\r\n\r\nWith this abolition of want and the fear of want, the admiration of\r\nriches would decay, and men would seek the respect and approbation\r\nof their fellows in other modes than by the acquisition and display\r\nof wealth. In this way there would be brought to the management of\r\npublic affairs, and the administration of common funds, the skill, the\r\nattention, the fidelity, and integrity that can now be secured only\r\nfor private interests, and a railroad or gas works might be operated\r\non public account, not only more economically and efficiently than\r\nas at present, under joint stock management, but as economically and\r\nefficiently as would be possible under a single ownership. The prize\r\nof the Olympian games, that called forth the most strenuous exertions\r\nof all Greece, was but a wreath of wild olive; for a bit of ribbon men\r\nhave over and over again performed services no money could have bought.\r\n\r\nShortsighted is the philosophy which counts on selfishness as the\r\nmaster motive of human action. It is blind to facts of which the world\r\nis full. It sees not the present, and reads not the past aright. If\r\nyou would move men to action, to what shall you appeal? Not to their\r\npockets, but to their patriotism; not to selfishness, but to sympathy.\r\nSelf-interest is, as it were, a mechanical force—potent, it is true;\r\ncapable of large and wide results. But there is in human nature\r\nwhat may be likened to a chemical force; which melts and fuses and\r\noverwhelms; to which nothing seems impossible. “All that a man hath\r\nwill he give for his life”—that is self-interest. But in loyalty to\r\nhigher impulses men will give even life.\r\n\r\nIt is not selfishness that enriches the annals of every people with\r\nheroes and saints. It is not selfishness that on every page of the\r\nworld’s history bursts out in sudden splendor of noble deeds or sheds\r\nthe soft radiance of benignant lives. It was not selfishness that\r\nturned Gautama’s back to his royal home or bade the Maid of Orleans\r\nlift the sword from the altar; that held the Three Hundred in the Pass\r\nof Thermopylæ, or gathered into Winkelried’s bosom the sheaf of spears;\r\nthat chained Vincent de Paul to the bench of the galley, or brought\r\nlittle starving children, during the Indian famine, tottering to the\r\nrelief stations with yet weaker starvelings in their arms. Call it\r\nreligion, patriotism, sympathy, the enthusiasm for humanity, or the\r\nlove of God—give it what name you will; there is yet a force which\r\novercomes and drives out selfishness; a force which is the electricity\r\nof the moral universe; a force beside which all others are weak.\r\nEverywhere that men have lived it has shown its power, and to-day, as\r\never, the world is full of it. To be pitied is the man who has never\r\nseen and never felt it. Look around! among common men and women, amid\r\nthe care and the struggle of daily life, in the jar of the noisy street\r\nand amid the squalor where want hides—every here and there is the\r\ndarkness lighted with the tremulous play of its lambent flames. He who\r\nhas not seen it has walked with shut eyes. He who looks may see, as\r\nsays Plutarch, that “the soul has a principle of kindness in itself,\r\nand is born to love, as well as to perceive, think, or remember.”\r\n\r\nAnd this force of forces—that now goes to waste or assumes perverted\r\nforms—we may use for the strengthening, and building up, and ennobling\r\nof society, if we but will, just as we now use physical forces that\r\nonce seemed but powers of destruction. All we have to do is but to\r\ngive it freedom and scope. The wrong that produces inequality; the\r\nwrong that in the midst of abundance tortures men with want or harries\r\nthem with the fear of want; that stunts them physically, degrades them\r\nintellectually, and distorts them morally, is what alone prevents\r\nharmonious social development. For “all that is from the gods is full\r\nof providence. We are made for co-operation—like feet, like hands, like\r\neyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.”\r\n\r\nThere are people into whose heads it never enters to conceive of any\r\nbetter state of society than that which now exists—who imagine that the\r\nidea that there could be a state of society in which greed would be\r\nbanished, prisons stand empty, individual interests be subordinated to\r\ngeneral interests, and no one seek to rob or to oppress his neighbor,\r\nis but the dream of impracticable dreamers, for whom these practical\r\nlevel-headed men, who pride themselves on recognizing facts as they\r\nare, have a hearty contempt. But such men—though some of them write\r\nbooks, and some of them occupy the chairs of universities, and some of\r\nthem stand in pulpits—do not think.\r\n\r\nIf they were accustomed to dine in such eating houses as are to be\r\nfound in the lower quarters of London and Paris, where the knives\r\nand forks are chained to the table, they would deem it the natural,\r\nineradicable disposition of man to carry off the knife and fork with\r\nwhich he has eaten.\r\n\r\nTake a company of well-bred men and women dining together. There is\r\nno struggling for food, no attempt on the part of any one to get\r\nmore than his neighbor; no attempt to gorge or to carry off. On the\r\ncontrary, each one is anxious to help his neighbor before he partakes\r\nhimself; to offer to others the best rather than pick it out for\r\nhimself; and should any one show the slightest disposition to prefer\r\nthe gratification of his own appetite to that of the others, or in any\r\nway to act the pig or pilferer, the swift and heavy penalty of social\r\ncontempt and ostracism would show how such conduct is reprobated by\r\ncommon opinion.\r\n\r\nAll this is so common as to excite no remark, as to seem the natural\r\nstate of things. Yet it is no more natural that men should not be\r\ngreedy of food than that they should not be greedy of wealth. They\r\n_are_ greedy of food when they are not assured that there will be a\r\nfair and equitable distribution which will give each enough. But when\r\nthese conditions are assured, they cease to be greedy of food. And so\r\nin society, as at present constituted, men are greedy of wealth because\r\nthe conditions of distribution are so unjust that instead of each\r\nbeing sure of enough, many are certain to be condemned to want. It\r\nis the “devil catch the hindmost” of present social adjustments that\r\ncauses the race and scramble for wealth, in which all considerations\r\nof justice, mercy, religion, and sentiment are trampled under foot; in\r\nwhich men forget their own souls, and struggle to the very verge of the\r\ngrave for what they cannot take beyond. But an equitable distribution\r\nof wealth, that would exempt all from the fear of want, would destroy\r\nthe greed of wealth, just as in polite society the greed of food has\r\nbeen destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn the crowded steamers of the early California lines there was often\r\na marked difference between the manners of the steerage and the cabin,\r\nwhich illustrates this principle of human nature. An abundance of food\r\nwas provided for the steerage as for the cabin, but in the former\r\nthere were no regulations which insured efficient service, and the\r\nmeals became a scramble. In the cabin, on the contrary, where each was\r\nallotted his place and there was no fear that every one would not get\r\nenough, there was no such scrambling and waste as were witnessed in the\r\nsteerage. The difference was not in the character of the people, but\r\nsimply in this fact. The cabin passenger transferred to the steerage\r\nwould participate in the greedy rush, and the steerage passenger\r\ntransferred to the cabin would at once become decorous and polite.\r\nThe same difference would show itself in society in general were the\r\npresent unjust distribution of wealth replaced by a just distribution.\r\n\r\nConsider this existing fact of a cultivated and refined society, in\r\nwhich all the coarser passions are held in check, not by force, not\r\nby law, but by common opinion and the mutual desire of pleasing. If\r\nthis is possible for a part of a community, it is possible for a whole\r\ncommunity. There are states of society in which every one has to go\r\narmed—in which every one has to hold himself in readiness to defend\r\nperson and property with the strong hand. If we have progressed beyond\r\nthat, we may progress still further.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, to banish want and the fear of want, would be to\r\ndestroy the stimulus to exertion; men would become simply idlers, and\r\nsuch a happy state of general comfort and content would be the death\r\nof progress. This is the old slaveholders’ argument, that men can be\r\ndriven to labor only with the lash. Nothing is more untrue.\r\n\r\nWant might be banished, but desire would remain. Man is the unsatisfied\r\nanimal. He has but begun to explore, and the universe lies before him.\r\nEach step that he takes opens new vistas and kindles new desires. He is\r\nthe constructive animal; he builds, he improves, he invents, and puts\r\ntogether, and the greater the thing he does, the greater the thing he\r\nwants to do. He is more than an animal. Whatever be the intelligence\r\nthat breathes through nature, it is in that likeness that man is made.\r\nThe steamship, driven by her throbbing engines through the sea, is in\r\nkind, though not in degree, as much a creation as the whale that swims\r\nbeneath. The telescope and the microscope, what are they but added\r\neyes, which man has made for himself; the soft webs and fair colors in\r\nwhich our women array themselves, do they not answer to the plumage\r\nthat nature gives the bird? Man must be doing something, or fancy that\r\nhe is doing something, for in him throbs the creative impulse; the mere\r\nbasker in the sunshine is not a natural, but an abnormal man.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a child can command its muscles, it will begin to make mud\r\npies or dress a doll; its play is but the imitation of the work of its\r\nelders; its very destructiveness arises from the desire to be doing\r\nsomething, from the satisfaction of seeing itself accomplish something.\r\nThere is no such thing as the pursuit of pleasure for the sake of\r\npleasure. Our very amusements amuse only as they are, or simulate, the\r\nlearning or the doing of something. The moment they cease to appeal\r\neither to our inquisitive or to our constructive powers, they cease to\r\namuse. It will spoil the interest of the novel reader to be told just\r\nhow the story will end; it is only the chance and the skill involved in\r\nthe game that enable the card-player to “kill time” by shuffling bits\r\nof pasteboard. The luxurious frivolities of Versailles were possible to\r\nhuman beings only because the king thought he was governing a kingdom\r\nand the courtiers were in pursuit of fresh honors and new pensions.\r\nPeople who lead what are called lives of fashion and pleasure must have\r\nsome other object in view, or they would die of _ennui_; they support\r\nit only because they imagine that they are gaining position, making\r\nfriends, or improving the chances of their children. Shut a man up, and\r\ndeny him employment, and he must either die or go mad.\r\n\r\nIt is not labor in itself that is repugnant to man; it is not the\r\nnatural necessity for exertion which is a curse. It is only labor which\r\nproduces nothing—exertion of which he cannot see the results. To toil\r\nday after day, and yet get but the necessaries of life, this is indeed\r\nhard; it is like the infernal punishment of compelling a man to pump\r\nlest he be drowned, or to trudge on a treadmill lest he be crushed.\r\nBut, released from this necessity, men would but work the harder and\r\nthe better, for then they would work as their inclinations led them;\r\nthen would they seem to be really doing something for themselves or\r\nfor others. Was Humboldt’s life an idle one? Did Franklin find no\r\noccupation when he retired from the printing business with enough to\r\nlive on? Is Herbert Spencer a laggard? Did Michael Angelo paint for\r\nboard and clothes?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the work which improves the condition of mankind,\r\nthe work which extends knowledge and increases power, and enriches\r\nliterature, and elevates thought, is not done to secure a living. It is\r\nnot the work of slaves, driven to their task either by the lash of a\r\nmaster or by animal necessities. It is the work of men who perform it\r\nfor its own sake, and not that they may get more to eat or drink, or\r\nwear, or display. In a state of society where want was abolished, work\r\nof this sort would be enormously increased.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the result of confiscating rent in the\r\nmanner I have proposed would be to cause the organization of labor,\r\nwherever large capitals were used, to assume the co-operative form,\r\nsince the more equal diffusion of wealth would unite capitalist and\r\nlaborer in the same person. But whether this would be so or not is of\r\nlittle moment. The hard toil of routine labor would disappear. Wages\r\nwould be too high and opportunities too great to compel any man to\r\nstint and starve the higher qualities of his nature, and in every\r\navocation the brain would aid the hand. Work, even of the coarser\r\nkinds, would become a lightsome thing, and the tendency of modern\r\nproduction to subdivision would not involve monotony or the contraction\r\nof ability in the worker; but would be relieved by short hours, by\r\nchange, by the alternation of intellectual with manual occupations.\r\nThere would result, not only the utilization of productive forces\r\nnow going to waste; not only would our present knowledge, now so\r\nimperfectly applied, be fully used; but from the mobility of labor\r\nand the mental activity which would be generated, there would result\r\nadvances in the methods of production that we now cannot imagine.\r\n\r\nFor, greatest of all the enormous wastes which the present constitution\r\nof society involves, is that of mental power. How infinitesimal are the\r\nforces that concur to the advance of civilization, as compared to the\r\nforces that lie latent! How few are the thinkers, the discoverers,\r\nthe inventors, the organizers, as compared with the great mass of the\r\npeople! Yet such men are born in plenty; it is the conditions that\r\npermit so few to develop. There are among men infinite diversities of\r\naptitude and inclination, as there are such infinite diversities in\r\nphysical structure that among a million there will not be two that\r\ncannot be told apart. But, both from observation and reflection, I\r\nam inclined to think that the differences of natural power are no\r\ngreater than the differences of stature or of physical strength. Turn\r\nto the lives of great men, and see how easily they might never have\r\nbeen heard of. Had Cæsar come of a proletarian family; had Napoleon\r\nentered the world a few years earlier; had Columbus gone into the\r\nChurch instead of going to sea; had Shakespeare been apprenticed to a\r\ncobbler or chimney-sweep; had Sir Isaac Newton been assigned by fate\r\nthe education and the toil of an agricultural laborer; had Dr. Adam\r\nSmith been born in the coal hews, or Herbert Spencer forced to get his\r\nliving as a factory operative, what would their talents have availed?\r\nBut there would have been, it will be said, other Cæsars or Napoleons,\r\nColumbuses or Shakespeares, Newtons, Smiths or Spencers. This is true.\r\nAnd it shows how prolific is our human nature. As the common worker is\r\non need transformed into queen bee, so, when circumstances favor his\r\ndevelopment, what might otherwise pass for a common man rises into a\r\nhero or leader, discoverer or teacher, sage or saint. So widely has the\r\nsower scattered the seed, so strong is the germinative force that bids\r\nit bud and blossom. But, alas, for the stony ground, and the birds and\r\nthe tares! For one who attains his full stature, how many are stunted\r\nand deformed.\r\n\r\nThe will within us is the ultimate fact of consciousness. Yet how\r\nlittle have the best of us, in acquirements, in position, even in\r\ncharacter, that may be credited entirely to ourselves; how much to the\r\ninfluences that have molded us. Who is there, wise, learned, discreet,\r\nor strong, who might not, were he to trace the inner history of his\r\nlife, turn, like the Stoic Emperor, to give thanks to the gods, that by\r\nthis one and that one, and here and there, good examples have been set\r\nhim, noble thoughts have reached him, and happy opportunities opened\r\nbefore him. Who is there, who, with his eyes about him, has reached\r\nthe meridian of life, who has not sometimes echoed the thought of the\r\npious Englishman, as the criminal passed to the gallows, “But for the\r\ngrace of God, there go I.” How little does heredity count as compared\r\nwith conditions. This one, we say, is the result of a thousand years\r\nof European progress, and that one of a thousand years of Chinese\r\npetrifaction; yet, placed an infant in the heart of China, and but for\r\nthe angle of the eye or the shade of the hair, the Caucasian would\r\ngrow up as those around him, using the same speech, thinking the same\r\nthoughts, exhibiting the same tastes. Change Lady Vere de Vere in her\r\ncradle with an infant of the slums, and will the blood of a hundred\r\nearls give you a refined and cultured woman?\r\n\r\nTo remove want and the fear of want, to give to all classes leisure,\r\nand comfort, and independence, the decencies and refinements of life,\r\nthe opportunities of mental and moral development, would be like\r\nturning water into a desert. The sterile waste would clothe itself\r\nwith verdure, and the barren places where life seemed banned would ere\r\nlong be dappled with the shade of trees and musical with the song of\r\nbirds. Talents now hidden, virtues unsuspected, would come forth to\r\nmake human life richer, fuller, happier, nobler. For in these round men\r\nwho are stuck into three-cornered holes, and three-cornered men who are\r\njammed into round holes; in these men who are wasting their energies\r\nin the scramble to be rich; in these who in factories are turned into\r\nmachines, or are chained by necessity to bench or plow; in these\r\nchildren who are growing up in squalor, and vice, and ignorance, are\r\npowers of the highest order, talents the most splendid. They need but\r\nthe opportunity to bring them forth.\r\n\r\nConsider the possibilities of a state of society that gave that\r\nopportunity to all. Let imagination fill out the picture; its colors\r\ngrow too bright for words to paint. Consider the moral elevation, the\r\nintellectual activity, the social life. Consider how by a thousand\r\nactions and interactions the members of every community are linked\r\ntogether, and how in the present condition of things even the fortunate\r\nfew who stand upon the apex of the social pyramid must suffer, though\r\nthey know it not, from the want, ignorance, and degradation that are\r\nunderneath. Consider these things and then say whether the change I\r\npropose would not be for the benefit of every one—even the greatest\r\nland holder? Would he not be safer of the future of his children in\r\nleaving them penniless in such a state of society than in leaving them\r\nthe largest fortune in this? Did such a state of society anywhere\r\nexist, would he not buy entrance to it cheaply by giving up all his\r\npossessions?\r\n\r\nI have now traced to their source social weakness and disease. I have\r\nshown the remedy. I have covered every point and met every objection.\r\nBut the problems that we have been considering, great as they are, pass\r\ninto problems greater yet—into the grandest problems with which the\r\nhuman mind can grapple. I am about to ask the reader who has gone with\r\nme so far, to go with me further, into still higher fields. But I ask\r\nhim to remember that in the little space which remains of the limits to\r\nwhich this book must be confined, I cannot fully treat the questions\r\nwhich arise. I can but suggest some thoughts, which may, perhaps, serve\r\nas hints for further thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF HUMAN PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.—THE CURRENT THEORY OF HUMAN PROGRESS—ITS INSUFFICIENCY.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.—DIFFERENCES IN CIVILIZATION—TO WHAT DUE.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.—THE LAW OF HUMAN PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.—HOW MODERN CIVILIZATION MAY DECLINE.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.—THE CENTRAL TRUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    What in me is dark\r\n    Illumine, what is low raise and support;\r\n    That to the height of this great argument\r\n    I may assert eternal Providence\r\n    And justify the ways of God to men.\r\n\r\n    —_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE CURRENT THEORY OF HUMAN PROGRESS—ITS INSUFFICIENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the conclusions at which we have arrived are correct, they will fall\r\nunder a larger generalization.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, recommence our inquiry from a higher standpoint,\r\nwhence we may survey a wider field.\r\n\r\n _What is the law of human progress?_\r\n\r\nThis is a question which, were it not for what has gone before, I\r\nshould hesitate to review in the brief space I can now devote to it, as\r\nit involves, directly or indirectly, some of the very highest problems\r\nwith which the human mind can engage. But it is a question which\r\nnaturally comes up. Are or are not the conclusions to which we have\r\ncome consistent with the great law under which human development goes\r\non?\r\n\r\nWhat is that law? We must find the answer to our question; for the\r\ncurrent philosophy, though it clearly recognizes the existence of\r\nsuch a law, gives no more satisfactory account of it than the current\r\npolitical economy does of the persistence of want amid advancing wealth.\r\n\r\nLet us, as far as possible, keep to the firm ground of facts. Whether\r\nman was or was not gradually developed from an animal, it is not\r\nnecessary to inquire. However intimate may be the connection between\r\nquestions which relate to man as we know him and questions which relate\r\nto his genesis, it is only from the former upon the latter that light\r\ncan be thrown. Inference cannot proceed from the unknown to the known.\r\nIt is only from facts of which we are cognizant that we can infer what\r\nhas preceded cognizance.\r\n\r\nHowever man may have originated, all we know of him is as man—just as\r\nhe is now to be found. There is no record or trace of him in any lower\r\ncondition than that in which savages are still to be met. By whatever\r\nbridge he may have crossed the wide chasm which now separates him from\r\nthe brutes, there remain of it no vestiges. Between the lowest savages\r\nof whom we know and the highest animals, there is an irreconcilable\r\ndifference—a difference not merely of degree, but of kind. Many of the\r\ncharacteristics, actions, and emotions of man are exhibited by the\r\nlower animals; but man, no matter how low in the scale of humanity, has\r\nnever yet been found destitute of one thing of which no animal shows\r\nthe slightest trace, a clearly recognizable but almost undefinable\r\nsomething, which gives him the power of improvement—which makes him the\r\nprogressive animal.\r\n\r\nThe beaver builds a dam, and the bird a nest, and the bee a cell; but\r\nwhile beavers’ dams, and birds’ nests, and bees’ cells are always\r\nconstructed on the same model, the house of the man passes from the\r\nrude hut of leaves and branches to the magnificent mansion replete with\r\nmodern conveniences. The dog can to a certain extent connect cause\r\nand effect, and may be taught some tricks; but his capacity in these\r\nrespects has not been a whit increased during all the ages he has been\r\nthe associate of improving man, and the dog of civilization is not a\r\nwhit more accomplished or intelligent than the dog of the wandering\r\nsavage. We know of no animal that uses clothes, that cooks its food,\r\nthat makes itself tools or weapons, that breeds other animals that it\r\nwishes to eat, or that has an articulate language. But men who do not\r\ndo such things have never yet been found, or heard of, except in fable.\r\nThat is to say, man, wherever we know him, exhibits this power—of\r\nsupplementing what nature has done for him by what he does for himself;\r\nand, in fact, so inferior is the physical endowment of man, that there\r\nis no part of the world, save perhaps some of the small islands of the\r\nPacific, where without this faculty he could maintain an existence.\r\n\r\nMan everywhere and at all times exhibits this faculty—everywhere and at\r\nall times of which we have knowledge he has made some use of it. But\r\nthe degree in which this has been done greatly varies. Between the rude\r\ncanoe and the steamship; between the boomerang and the repeating rifle;\r\nbetween the roughly carved wooden idol and the breathing marble of\r\nGrecian art; between savage knowledge and modern science; between the\r\nwild Indian and the white settler; between the Hottentot woman and the\r\nbelle of polished society, there is an enormous difference.\r\n\r\nThe varying degrees in which this faculty is used cannot be ascribed to\r\ndifferences in original capacity—the most highly improved peoples of\r\nthe present day were savages within historic times, and we meet with\r\nthe widest differences between peoples of the same stock. Nor can they\r\nbe wholly ascribed to differences in physical environment—the cradles\r\nof learning and the arts are now in many cases tenanted by barbarians,\r\nand within a few years great cities rise on the hunting grounds of\r\nwild tribes. All these differences are evidently connected with social\r\ndevelopment. Beyond perhaps the veriest rudiments, it becomes possible\r\nfor man to improve only as he lives with his fellows. All these\r\nimprovements, therefore, in man’s powers and condition we summarize in\r\nthe term civilization. Men improve as they become civilized, or learn\r\nto co-operate in society.\r\n\r\nWhat is the law of this improvement? By what common principle can\r\nwe explain the different stages of civilization at which different\r\ncommunities have arrived? In what consists essentially the progress\r\nof civilization, so that we may say of varying social adjustments,\r\nthis favors it, and that does not; or explain why an institution or\r\ncondition which may at one time advance it may at another time retard\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThe prevailing belief now is, that the progress of civilization is\r\na development or evolution, in the course of which men’s powers are\r\nincreased and his qualities improved by the operation of causes\r\nsimilar to those which are relied upon as explaining the genesis\r\nof species—viz., the survival of the fittest and the hereditary\r\ntransmission of acquired qualities.\r\n\r\nThat civilization is an evolution—that it is, in the language of\r\nHerbert Spencer, a progress from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity\r\nto a definite, coherent heterogeneity—there is no doubt; but to say\r\nthis is not to explain or identify the causes which forward or retard\r\nit. How far the sweeping generalizations of Spencer, which seek to\r\naccount for all phenomena under terms of matter and force, may,\r\nproperly understood, include all these causes, I am unable to say; but,\r\nas scientifically expounded, the development philosophy has either\r\nnot yet definitely met this question, or has given birth, or rather\r\ncoherency, to an opinion which does not accord with the facts.\r\n\r\nThe vulgar explanation of progress is, I think, very much like the\r\nview naturally taken by the money maker of the causes of the unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth. His theory, if he has one, usually is, that\r\nthere is plenty of money to be made by those who have will and ability,\r\nand that it is ignorance, or idleness, or extravagance, that makes the\r\ndifference between the rich and the poor. And so the common explanation\r\nof differences of civilization is of differences in capacity. The\r\ncivilized races are the superior races, and advance in civilization\r\nis according to this superiority—just as English victories were, in\r\ncommon English opinion, due to the natural superiority of Englishmen to\r\nfrog-eating Frenchmen; and popular government, active invention, and\r\ngreater average comfort are, or were until lately, in common American\r\nopinion, due to the greater “smartness of the Yankee Nation.”\r\n\r\nNow, just as the politico-economic doctrines which in the beginning of\r\nthis inquiry we met and disproved, harmonize with the common opinion of\r\nmen who see capitalists paying wages and competition reducing wages;\r\njust as the Malthusian theory harmonized with existing prejudices\r\nboth of the rich and the poor; so does the explanation of progress as\r\na gradual race improvement harmonize with the vulgar opinion which\r\naccounts by race differences for differences in civilization. It has\r\ngiven coherence and a scientific formula to opinions which already\r\nprevailed. Its wonderful spread since the time Darwin first startled\r\nthe world with his “Origin of Species” has not been so much a conquest\r\nas an assimilation.\r\n\r\nThe view which now dominates the world of thought is this: That the\r\nstruggle for existence, just in proportion as it becomes intense,\r\nimpels men to new efforts and inventions. That this improvement and\r\ncapacity for improvement is fixed by hereditary transmission, and\r\nextended by the tendency of the best adapted individual, or most\r\nimproved individual, to survive and propagate among individuals, and of\r\nthe best adapted, or most improved tribe, nation, or race to survive in\r\nthe struggle between social aggregates. On this theory the differences\r\nbetween man and the animals, and differences in the relative progress\r\nof men, are now explained as confidently, and all but as generally,\r\nas a little while ago they were explained upon the theory of special\r\ncreation and divine interposition.\r\n\r\nThe practical outcome of this theory is in a sort of hopeful fatalism,\r\nof which current literature is full.[57] In this view, progress is the\r\nresult of forces which work slowly, steadily and remorselessly, for\r\nthe elevation of man. War, slavery, tyranny, superstition, famine, and\r\npestilence, the want and misery which fester in modern civilization,\r\nare the impelling causes which drive man on, by eliminating poorer\r\ntypes and extending the higher; and hereditary transmission is\r\nthe power by which advances are fixed, and past advances made the\r\nfooting for new advances. The individual is the result of changes\r\nthus impressed upon and perpetuated through a long series of past\r\nindividuals, and the social organization takes its form from the\r\nindividuals of which it is composed. Thus, while this theory is, as\r\nHerbert Spencer says[58]—“radical to a degree beyond anything which\r\ncurrent radicalism conceives;” inasmuch as it looks for changes in\r\nthe very nature of man; it is at the same time “conservative to a\r\ndegree beyond anything conceived by current conservatism,” inasmuch\r\nas it holds that no change can avail save these slow changes in\r\nmen’s natures. Philosophers may teach that this does not lessen the\r\nduty of endeavoring to reform abuses, just as the theologians who\r\ntaught predestinarianism insisted on the duty of all to struggle for\r\nsalvation; but, as generally apprehended, the result is fatalism—“do\r\nwhat we may, the mills of the gods grind on regardless either of our\r\naid or our hindrance.” I allude to this only to illustrate what I\r\ntake to be the opinion now rapidly spreading and permeating common\r\nthought; not that in the search for truth any regard for its effects\r\nshould be permitted to bias the mind. But this I take to be the current\r\nview of civilization: That it is the result of forces, operating in\r\nthe way indicated, which slowly change the character, and improve and\r\nelevate the powers of man; that the difference between civilized man\r\nand savage is of a long race education, which has become permanently\r\nfixed in mental organization; and that this improvement tends to go on\r\nincreasingly, to a higher and higher civilization. We have reached such\r\na point that progress seems to be natural with us, and we look forward\r\nconfidently to the greater achievements of the coming race—some even\r\nholding that the progress of science will finally give men immortality\r\nand enable them to make bodily the tour not only of the planets, but\r\nof the fixed stars, and at length to manufacture suns and systems for\r\nthemselves.[59]\r\n\r\nBut without soaring to the stars, the moment that this theory\r\nof progression, which seems so natural to us amid an advancing\r\ncivilization, looks around the world, it comes against an enormous\r\nfact—the fixed, petrified civilizations. The majority of the human race\r\nto-day have no idea of progress; the majority of the human race to-day\r\nlook (as until a few generations ago our own ancestors looked) upon\r\nthe past as the time of human perfection. The difference between the\r\nsavage and the civilized man may be explained on the theory that the\r\nformer is as yet so imperfectly developed that his progress is hardly\r\napparent; but how, upon the theory that human progress is the result of\r\ngeneral and continuous causes, shall we account for the civilizations\r\nthat have progressed so far and then stopped? It cannot be said of\r\nthe Hindoo and of the Chinaman, as it may be said of the savage, that\r\nour superiority is the result of a longer education; that we are, as\r\nit were, the grown men of nature, while they are the children. The\r\nHindoos and the Chinese were civilized when we were savages. They had\r\ngreat cities, highly organized and powerful governments, literatures,\r\nphilosophies, polished manners, considerable division of labor, large\r\ncommerce, and elaborate arts, when our ancestors were wandering\r\nbarbarians, living in huts and skin tents, not a whit further advanced\r\nthan the American Indians. While we have progressed from this savage\r\nstate to Nineteenth Century civilization, they have stood still. If\r\nprogress be the result of fixed laws, inevitable and eternal, which\r\nimpel men forward, how shall we account for this?\r\n\r\nOne of the best popular expounders of the development philosophy,\r\nWalter Bagehot (“Physics and Politics”), admits the force of this\r\nobjection, and endeavors in this way to explain it: That the first\r\nthing necessary to civilize man is to tame him; to induce him to live\r\nin association with his fellows in subordination to law; and hence a\r\nbody or “cake” of laws and customs grows up, being intensified and\r\nextended by natural selection, the tribe or nation thus bound together\r\nhaving an advantage over those who are not. That this cake of custom\r\nand law finally becomes too thick and hard to permit further progress,\r\nwhich can go on only as circumstances occur which introduce discussion,\r\nand thus permit the freedom and mobility necessary to improvement.\r\n\r\nThis explanation, which Mr. Bagehot offers, as he says, with some\r\nmisgivings, is I think at the expense of the general theory. But it is\r\nnot worth while speaking of that, for it, manifestly, does not explain\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nThe hardening tendency of which Mr. Bagehot speaks would show itself\r\nat a very early period of development, and his illustrations of\r\nit are nearly all drawn from savage or semi-savage life. Whereas,\r\nthese arrested civilizations had gone a long distance before they\r\nstopped. There must have been a time when they were very far advanced\r\nas compared with the savage state, and were yet plastic, free, and\r\nadvancing. These arrested civilizations stopped at a point which was\r\nhardly in anything inferior and in many respects superior to European\r\ncivilization of, say, the sixteenth or at any rate the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Up to that point then there must have been discussion, the\r\nhailing of what was new, and mental activity of all sorts. They had\r\narchitects who carried the art of building, necessarily by a series of\r\ninnovations or improvements, up to a very high point; ship-builders who\r\nin the same way, by innovation after innovation, finally produced as\r\ngood a vessel as the war ships of Henry VIII.; inventors who stopped\r\nonly on the verge of our most important improvements, and from some\r\nof whom we can yet learn; engineers who constructed great irrigation\r\nworks and navigable canals; rival schools of philosophy and conflicting\r\nideas of religion. One great religion, in many respects resembling\r\nChristianity, rose in India, displaced the old religion, passed into\r\nChina, sweeping over that country, and was displaced again in its old\r\nseats, just as Christianity was displaced in its first seats. There was\r\nlife, and active life, and the innovation that begets improvement, long\r\nafter men had learned to live together. And, moreover, both India and\r\nChina have received the infusion of new life in conquering races, with\r\ndifferent customs and modes of thought.\r\n\r\nThe most fixed and petrified of all civilizations of which we\r\nknow anything was that of Egypt, where even art finally assumed a\r\nconventional and inflexible form. But we know that behind this must\r\nhave been a time of life and vigor—a freshly developing and expanding\r\ncivilization, such as ours is now—or the arts and sciences could never\r\nhave been carried to such a pitch. And recent excavations have brought\r\nto light from beneath what we before knew of Egypt an earlier Egypt\r\nstill—in statues and carvings which, instead of a hard and formal type,\r\nbeam with life and expression, which show art struggling, ardent,\r\nnatural, and free, the sure indication of an active and expanding life.\r\nSo it must have been once with all now unprogressive civilizations.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely these arrested civilizations that the current\r\ntheory of development fails to account for. It is not merely that men\r\nhave gone so far on the path of progress and then stopped; it is that\r\nmen have gone far on the path of progress and then gone back. It is\r\nnot merely an isolated case that thus confronts the theory—_it is the\r\nuniversal rule_. Every civilization that the world has yet seen has had\r\nits period of vigorous growth, of arrest and stagnation; its decline\r\nand fall. Of all the civilizations that have arisen and flourished,\r\nthere remain to-day but those that have been arrested, and our own,\r\nwhich is not yet as old as were the pyramids when Abraham looked upon\r\nthem—while behind the pyramids were twenty centuries of recorded\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThat our own civilization has a broader base, is of a more advanced\r\ntype, moves quicker and soars higher than any preceding civilization is\r\nundoubtedly true; but in these respects it is hardly more in advance\r\nof the Greco-Roman civilization than that was in advance of Asiatic\r\ncivilization; and if it were, that would prove nothing as to its\r\npermanence and future advance, unless it be shown that it is superior\r\nin those things which caused the ultimate failure of its predecessors.\r\nThe current theory does not assume this.\r\n\r\nIn truth, nothing could be further from explaining the facts of\r\nuniversal history than this theory that civilization is the result\r\nof a course of natural selection which operates to improve and\r\nelevate the powers of man. That civilization has arisen at different\r\ntimes in different places and has progressed at different rates, is\r\nnot inconsistent with this theory; for that might result from the\r\nunequal balancing of impelling and resisting forces; but that progress\r\neverywhere commencing, for even among the lowest tribes it is held\r\nthat there has been some progress, has nowhere been continuous,\r\nbut has everywhere been brought to a stand or retrogression, _is_\r\nabsolutely inconsistent. For if progress operated to fix an improvement\r\nin man’s nature and thus to produce further progress, though there\r\nmight be occasional interruption, yet the general rule would be that\r\nprogress would be continuous—that advance would lead to advance, and\r\ncivilization develop into higher civilization.\r\n\r\nNot merely the general rule, but _the universal rule_, is the reverse\r\nof this. The earth is the tomb of the dead empires, no less than of\r\ndead men. Instead of progress fitting men for greater progress, every\r\ncivilization that was in its own time as vigorous and advancing as\r\nours is now, has of itself come to a stop. Over and over again, art\r\nhas declined, learning sunk, power waned, population become sparse,\r\nuntil the people who had built great temples and mighty cities, turned\r\nrivers and pierced mountains, cultivated the earth like a garden and\r\nintroduced the utmost refinement into the minute affairs of life,\r\nremained but in a remnant of squalid barbarians, who had lost even the\r\nmemory of what their ancestors had done, and regarded the surviving\r\nfragments of their grandeur as the work of genii, or of the mighty race\r\nbefore the flood. So true is this, that when we think of the past, it\r\nseems like the inexorable law, from which we can no more hope to be\r\nexempt than the young man who “feels his life in every limb” can hope\r\nto be exempt from the dissolution which is the common fate of all.\r\n“Even this, O Rome, must one day be thy fate!” wept Scipio over the\r\nruins of Carthage, and Macaulay’s picture of the New Zealander musing\r\nupon the broken arch of London Bridge appeals to the imagination of\r\neven those who see cities rising in the wilderness and help to lay the\r\nfoundations of new empire. And so, when we erect a public building we\r\nmake a hollow in the largest corner stone and carefully seal within it\r\nsome mementos of our day, looking forward to the time when our works\r\nshall be ruins and ourselves forgot.\r\n\r\nNor whether this alternate rise and fall of civilization, this\r\nretrogression that always follows progression, be, or be not, the\r\nrhythmic movement of an ascending line (and I think, though I will\r\nnot open the question, that it would be much more difficult to prove\r\nthe affirmative than is generally supposed) makes no difference; for\r\nthe current theory is in either case disproved. Civilizations have\r\ndied and made no sign, and hard-won progress has been lost to the race\r\nforever, but, even if it be admitted that each wave of progress has\r\nmade possible a higher wave and each civilization passed the torch\r\nto a greater civilization, the theory that civilization advances by\r\nchanges wrought in the nature of man fails to explain the facts; for in\r\nevery case it is not the race that has been educated and hereditarily\r\nmodified by the old civilization that begins the new, but a fresh\r\nrace coming from a lower level. It is the barbarians of the one epoch\r\nwho have been the civilized men of the next; to be in their turn\r\nsucceeded by fresh barbarians. For it has been heretofore always the\r\ncase that men under the influences of civilization, though at first\r\nimproving, afterward degenerate. The civilized man of to-day is vastly\r\nthe superior of the uncivilized; but so in the time of its vigor was\r\nthe civilized man of every dead civilization. But there are such\r\nthings as the vices, the corruptions, the enervations of civilization,\r\nwhich past a certain point have always heretofore shown themselves.\r\nEvery civilization that has been overwhelmed by barbarians has really\r\nperished from internal decay.\r\n\r\nThis universal fact, the moment that it is recognized, disposes of the\r\ntheory that progress is by hereditary transmission. Looking over the\r\nhistory of the world, the line of greatest advance does not coincide\r\nfor any length of time with any line of heredity. On any particular\r\nline of heredity, retrogression seems always to follow advance.\r\n\r\nShall we therefore say that there is a national or race life, as there\r\nis an individual life—that every social aggregate has, as it were, a\r\ncertain amount of energy, the expenditure of which necessitates decay?\r\nThis is an old and widespread idea, that is yet largely held, and that\r\nmay be constantly seen cropping out incongruously in the writings of\r\nthe expounders of the development philosophy. Indeed, I do not see why\r\nit may not be stated in terms of matter and of motion so as to bring\r\nit clearly within the generalizations of evolution. For considering\r\nits individuals as atoms, the growth of society is “an integration of\r\nmatter and concomitant dissipation of motion; during which the matter\r\npasses from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a definite,\r\ncoherent heterogeneity, and during which the retained motion undergoes\r\na parallel transformation.”[60] And thus an analogy may be drawn\r\nbetween the life of a society and the life of a solar system upon the\r\nnebular hypothesis. As the heat and light of the sun are produced by\r\nthe aggregation of atoms evolving motion, which finally ceases when the\r\natoms at length come to a state of equilibrium or rest, and a state of\r\nimmobility succeeds, which can be broken in again only by the impact of\r\nexternal forces, which reverse the process of evolution, integrating\r\nmotion and dissipating matter in the form of gas, again to evolve\r\nmotion by its condensation; so, it may be said, does the aggregation of\r\nindividuals in a community evolve a force which produces the light and\r\nwarmth of civilization, but when this process ceases and the individual\r\ncomponents are brought into a state of equilibrium, assuming their\r\nfixed places, petrifaction ensues, and the breaking up and diffusion\r\ncaused by an incursion of barbarians is necessary to the recommencement\r\nof the process and a new growth of civilization.\r\n\r\nBut analogies are the most dangerous modes of thought. They may connect\r\nresemblances and yet disguise or cover up the truth. And all such\r\nanalogies are superficial. While its members are constantly reproduced\r\nin all the fresh vigor of childhood, a community cannot grow old, as\r\ndoes a man, by the decay of its powers. While its aggregate force must\r\nbe the sum of the forces of its individual components, a community\r\ncannot lose vital power unless the vital powers of its components are\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nYet in both the common analogy which likens the life power of a nation\r\nto that of an individual, and in the one I have supposed, lurks the\r\nrecognition of an obvious truth—the truth that the obstacles which\r\nfinally bring progress to a halt are raised by the course of progress;\r\nthat what has destroyed all previous civilizations has been the\r\nconditions produced by the growth of civilization itself.\r\n\r\nThis is a truth which in the current philosophy is ignored; but it is\r\na truth most pregnant. Any valid theory of human progress must account\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] In semi-scientific or popularized form this may perhaps be seen\r\nin best, because frankest, expression in “The Martyrdom of Man,” by\r\nWinwood Reade, a writer of singular vividness and power. This book is\r\nin reality a history of progress, or, rather, a monograph upon its\r\ncauses and methods, and will well repay perusal for its vivid pictures,\r\nwhatever may be thought of the capacity of the author for philosophic\r\ngeneralization. The connection between subject and title may be seen\r\nby the conclusion: “I give to universal history a strange but true\r\ntitle—_The Martyrdom of Man_. In each generation the human race has\r\nbeen tortured that their children might profit by their woes. Our own\r\nprosperity is founded on the agonies of the past. Is it therefore\r\nunjust that we also should suffer for the benefit of those who are to\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\n[58] “The Study of Sociology”—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n[59] Winwood Reade, “The Martyrdom of Man.”\r\n\r\n[60] Herbert Spencer’s definition of Evolution, “First Principles,” p.\r\n396.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES IN CIVILIZATION—TO WHAT DUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to discover the law of human progress, the first step\r\nmust be to determine the essential nature of those differences which we\r\ndescribe as differences in civilization.\r\n\r\nThat the current philosophy, which attributes social progress to\r\nchanges wrought in the nature of man, does not accord with historical\r\nfacts, we have already seen. And we may also see, if we consider\r\nthem, that the differences between communities in different stages\r\nof civilization cannot be ascribed to innate differences in the\r\nindividuals who compose these communities. That there are natural\r\ndifferences is true, and that there is such a thing as hereditary\r\ntransmission of peculiarities is undoubtedly true; but the great\r\ndifferences between men in different states of society cannot be\r\nexplained in this way. The influence of heredity, which it is now\r\nthe fashion to rate so highly, is as nothing compared with the\r\ninfluences which mold the man after he comes into the world. What\r\nis more ingrained in habit than language, which becomes not merely\r\nan automatic trick of the muscles, but the medium of thought? What\r\npersists longer, or will quicker show nationality? Yet we are not born\r\nwith a predisposition to any language. Our mother tongue is our mother\r\ntongue only because we learned it in infancy. Although his ancestors\r\nhave thought and spoken in one language for countless generations, a\r\nchild who hears from the first nothing else, will learn with equal\r\nfacility any other tongue. And so of other national or local or class\r\npeculiarities. They seem to be matters of education and habit, not of\r\ntransmission. Cases of white children captured by Indians in infancy\r\nand brought up in the wigwam show this. They become thorough Indians.\r\nAnd so, I believe, with children brought up by Gypsies.\r\n\r\nThat this is not so true of the children of Indians or other distinctly\r\nmarked races brought up by whites is, I think, due to the fact that\r\nthey are never treated precisely as white children. A gentleman who\r\nhad taught a colored school once told me that he thought the colored\r\nchildren, up to the age of ten or twelve, were really brighter and\r\nlearned more readily than white children, but that after that age\r\nthey seemed to get dull and careless. He thought this proof of innate\r\nrace inferiority, and so did I at the time. But I afterward heard a\r\nhighly intelligent negro gentleman (Bishop Hillery) incidentally make a\r\nremark which to my mind seems a sufficient explanation. He said: “Our\r\nchildren, when they are young, are fully as bright as white children,\r\nand learn as readily. But as soon as they get old enough to appreciate\r\ntheir status—to realize that they are looked upon as belonging to an\r\ninferior race, and can never hope to be anything more than cooks,\r\nwaiters, or something of that sort, they lose their ambition and cease\r\nto keep up.” And to this he might have added, that being the children\r\nof poor, uncultivated and unambitious parents, home influences told\r\nagainst them. For, I believe it is a matter of common observation that\r\nin the primary part of education the children of ignorant parents are\r\nquite as receptive as the children of intelligent parents, but by\r\nand by the latter, as a general rule, pull ahead and make the most\r\nintelligent men and women. The reason is plain. As to the first simple\r\nthings which they learn only at school, they are on a par, but as their\r\nstudies become more complex, the child who at home is accustomed to\r\ngood English, hears intelligent conversation, has access to books, can\r\nget questions answered, etc., has an advantage which tells.\r\n\r\nThe same thing may be seen later in life. Take a man who has raised\r\nhimself from the ranks of common labor, and just as he is brought\r\ninto contact with men of culture and men of affairs, will he become\r\nmore intelligent and polished. Take two brothers, the sons of poor\r\nparents, brought up in the same home and in the same way. One is put to\r\na rude trade, and never gets beyond the necessity of making a living\r\nby hard daily labor; the other, commencing as an errand boy, gets a\r\nstart in another direction, and becomes finally a successful lawyer,\r\nmerchant, or politician. At forty or fifty the contrast between them\r\nwill be striking, and the unreflecting will credit it to the greater\r\nnatural ability which has enabled the one to push himself ahead. But\r\njust as striking a difference in manners and intelligence will be\r\nmanifested between two sisters, one of whom, married to a man who\r\nhas remained poor, has her life fretted with petty cares and devoid\r\nof opportunities, and the other of whom has married a man whose\r\nsubsequent position brings her into cultured society and opens to\r\nher opportunities which refine taste and expand intelligence. And so\r\ndeteriorations may be seen. That “evil communications corrupt good\r\nmanners” is but an expression of the general law that human character\r\nis profoundly modified by its conditions and surroundings.\r\n\r\nI remember once seeing, in a Brazilian seaport, a negro man dressed\r\nin what was an evident attempt at the height of fashion, but without\r\nshoes and stockings. One of the sailors with whom I was in company,\r\nand who had made some runs in the slave trade, had a theory that a\r\nnegro was not a man, but a sort of monkey, and pointed to this as\r\nevidence in proof, contending that it was not natural for a negro to\r\nwear shoes, and that in his wild state he would wear no clothes at\r\nall. I afterward learned that it was not considered “the thing” there\r\nfor slaves to wear shoes, just as in England it is not considered the\r\nthing for a faultlessly attired butler to wear jewelry, though for that\r\nmatter I have since seen white men at liberty to dress as they pleased\r\nget themselves up as incongruously as the Brazilian slave. But a great\r\nmany of the facts adduced as showing hereditary transmission have\r\nreally no more bearing than this of our forecastle Darwinian.\r\n\r\nThat, for instance, a large number of criminals and recipients of\r\npublic relief in New York have been shown to have descended from\r\na pauper three or four generations back is extensively cited as\r\nshowing hereditary transmission. But it shows nothing of the kind,\r\ninasmuch as an adequate explanation of the facts is nearer. Paupers\r\nwill raise paupers, even if the children be not their own, just as\r\nfamiliar contact with criminals will make criminals of the children of\r\nvirtuous parents. To learn to rely on charity is necessarily to lose\r\nthe self-respect and independence necessary for self-reliance when\r\nthe struggle is hard. So true is this that, as is well known, charity\r\nhas the effect of increasing the demand for charity, and it is an\r\nopen question whether public relief and private alms do not in this\r\nway do far more harm than good. And so of the disposition of children\r\nto show the same feelings, tastes, prejudices, or talents as their\r\nparents. They imbibe these dispositions just as they imbibe from their\r\nhabitual associates. And the exceptions prove the rule, as dislikes or\r\nrevulsions may be excited.\r\n\r\nAnd there is, I think, a subtler influence which often accounts for\r\nwhat are looked upon as atavisms of character—the same influence that\r\nmakes the boy who reads dime novels want to be a pirate. I once knew a\r\ngentleman in whose veins ran the blood of Indian chiefs. He used to\r\ntell me traditions learned from his grandfather, which illustrated what\r\nis difficult for a white man to comprehend—the Indian habit of thought,\r\nthe intense but patient blood thirst of the trail, and the fortitude\r\nof the stake. From the way in which he dwelt on these, I have no doubt\r\nthat under certain circumstances, highly educated, civilized man\r\nthat he was, he would have shown traits which would have been looked\r\non as due to his Indian blood; but which in reality would have been\r\nsufficiently explained by the broodings of his imagination upon the\r\ndeeds of his ancestors.[61]\r\n\r\nIn any large community we may see, as between different classes and\r\ngroups, differences of the same kind as those which exist between\r\ncommunities which we speak of as differing in civilization—differences\r\nof knowledge, belief, customs, tastes, and speech, which in their\r\nextremes show among people of the same race, living in the same\r\ncountry, differences almost as great as those between civilized and\r\nsavage communities. As all stages of social development, from the stone\r\nage up, are yet to be found in contemporaneously existing communities,\r\nso in the same country and in the same city are to be found, side by\r\nside, groups which show similar diversities. In such countries as\r\nEngland and Germany, children of the same race, born and reared in the\r\nsame place, will grow up, speaking the language differently, holding\r\ndifferent beliefs, following different customs, and showing different\r\ntastes; and even in such a country as the United States differences\r\nof the same kind, though not of the same degree, may be seen between\r\ndifferent circles or groups.\r\n\r\nBut these differences are certainly not innate. No baby is born a\r\nMethodist or Catholic, to drop its h’s or to sound them. All these\r\ndifferences which distinguish different groups or circles are derived\r\nfrom association in these circles.\r\n\r\nThe Janissaries were made up of youths torn from Christian parents\r\nat an early age, but they were none the less fanatical Moslems and\r\nnone the less exhibited all the Turkish traits; the Jesuits and other\r\norders show distinct character, but it is certainly not perpetuated\r\nby hereditary transmissions; and even such associations as schools\r\nor regiments, where the components remain but a short time and are\r\nconstantly changing, exhibit general characteristics, which are the\r\nresult of mental impressions perpetuated by association.\r\n\r\nNow, it is this body of traditions, beliefs, customs, laws, habits, and\r\nassociations, which arise in every community and which surround every\r\nindividual—this “super-organic environment,” as Herbert Spencer calls\r\nit, that, as I take it, is the great element in determining national\r\ncharacter. It is this, rather than hereditary transmission, which makes\r\nthe Englishman differ from the Frenchman, the German from the Italian,\r\nthe American from the Chinaman, and the civilized man from the savage\r\nman. It is in this way that national traits are preserved, extended, or\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nWithin certain limits, or, if you choose, without limits in itself,\r\nhereditary transmission may develop or alter qualities, but this is\r\nmuch more true of the physical than of the mental part of a man,\r\nand much more true of animals than it is even of the physical part\r\nof man. Deductions from the breeding of pigeons or cattle will not\r\napply to man, and the reason is clear. The life of man, even in his\r\nrudest state, is infinitely more complex. He is constantly acted\r\non by an infinitely greater number of influences, amid which the\r\nrelative influence of heredity becomes less and less. A race of men\r\nwith no greater mental activity than the animals—men who only ate,\r\ndrank, slept, and propagated—might, I doubt not, by careful treatment\r\nand selection in breeding, be made, in course of time, to exhibit as\r\ngreat diversities in bodily shape and character as similar means have\r\nproduced in the domestic animals. But there are no such men; and in\r\nmen as they are, mental influences, acting through the mind upon the\r\nbody, would constantly interrupt the process. You cannot fatten a man\r\nwhose mind is on the strain by cooping him up and feeding him as you\r\nwould fatten a pig. In all probability men have been upon the earth\r\nlonger than many species of animals. They have been separated from\r\neach other under differences of climate that produce the most marked\r\ndifferences in animals, and yet the physical differences between the\r\ndifferent races of men are hardly greater than the difference between\r\nwhite horses and black horses—they are certainly nothing like as\r\ngreat as between dogs of the same sub-species, as, for instance, the\r\ndifferent varieties of the terrier or spaniel. And even these physical\r\ndifferences between races of men, it is held by those who account for\r\nthem by natural selection and hereditary transmission, were brought out\r\nwhen man was much nearer the animal—that is to say, when he had less\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAnd if this be true of the physical constitution of man, in how much\r\nhigher degree is it true of his mental constitution? All our physical\r\nparts we bring with us into the world; but the mind develops afterward.\r\n\r\nThere is a stage in the growth of every organism in which it cannot be\r\ntold, except by the environment, whether the animal that is to be will\r\nbe fish or reptile, monkey or man. And so with the new-born infant;\r\nwhether the mind that is yet to awake to consciousness and power is to\r\nbe English or German, American or Chinese—the mind of a civilized man\r\nor the mind of a savage—depends entirely on the social environment in\r\nwhich it is placed.\r\n\r\nTake a number of infants born of the most highly civilized parents\r\nand transport them to an uninhabited country. Suppose them in some\r\nmiraculous way to be sustained until they come of age to take care of\r\nthemselves, and what would you have? More helpless savages than any we\r\nknow of. They would have fire to discover; the rudest tools and weapons\r\nto invent; language to construct. They would, in short, have to stumble\r\ntheir way to the simplest knowledge which the lowest races now possess,\r\njust as a child learns to walk. That they would in time do all these\r\nthings I have not the slightest doubt, for all these possibilities are\r\nlatent in the human mind just as the power of walking is latent in\r\nthe human frame, but I do not believe they would do them any better\r\nor worse, any slower or quicker, than the children of barbarian\r\nparents placed in the same conditions. Given the very highest mental\r\npowers that exceptional individuals have ever displayed, and what\r\ncould mankind be if one generation were separated from the next by an\r\ninterval of time, as are the seventeen-year locusts? One such interval\r\nwould reduce mankind, not to savagery, but to a condition compared with\r\nwhich savagery, as we know it, would seem civilization.\r\n\r\nAnd, reversely, suppose a number of savage infants could, unknown to\r\nthe mothers, for even this would be necessary to make the experiment a\r\nfair one, be substituted for as many children of civilization, can we\r\nsuppose that growing up they would show any difference? I think no one\r\nwho has mixed much with different peoples and classes will think so.\r\nThe great lesson that is thus learned is that “human nature is human\r\nnature all the world over.” And this lesson, too, may be learned in\r\nthe library. I speak not so much of the accounts of travelers, for the\r\naccounts given of savages by the civilized men who write books are very\r\noften just such accounts as savages would give of us did they make\r\nflying visits and then write books; but of those mementos of the life\r\nand thoughts of other times and other peoples, which, translated into\r\nour language of to-day, are like glimpses of our own lives and gleams\r\nof our own thought. The feeling they inspire is that of the essential\r\nsimilarity of men. “This,” says Emanuel Deutsch—“this is the end of all\r\ninvestigation into history or art. _They were even as we are._”\r\n\r\nThere is a people to be found in all parts of the world who well\r\nillustrate what peculiarities are due to hereditary transmission and\r\nwhat to transmission by association. The Jews have maintained the\r\npurity of their blood more scrupulously and for a far longer time than\r\nany of the European races, yet I am inclined to think that the only\r\ncharacteristic that can be attributed to this is that of physiognomy,\r\nand this is in reality far less marked than is conventionally supposed,\r\nas any one who will take the trouble may see on observation. Although\r\nthey have constantly married among themselves, the Jews have everywhere\r\nbeen modified by their surroundings—the English, Russian, Polish,\r\nGerman, and Oriental Jews differing from each other in many respects\r\nas much as do the other people of those countries. Yet they have much\r\nin common, and have everywhere preserved their individuality. The\r\nreason is clear. It is the Hebrew religion—and certainly religion is\r\nnot transmitted by generation, but by association—which has everywhere\r\npreserved the distinctiveness of the Hebrew race. This religion, which\r\nchildren derive, not as they derive their physical characteristics, but\r\nby precept and association, is not merely exclusive in its teachings,\r\nbut has, by engendering suspicion and dislike, produced a powerful\r\noutside pressure which, even more than its precepts, has everywhere\r\nconstituted of the Jews a community within a community. Thus has been\r\nbuilt up and maintained a certain peculiar environment which gives a\r\ndistinctive character. Jewish intermarriage has been the effect, not\r\nthe cause of this. What persecution which stopped short of taking\r\nJewish children from their parents and bringing them up outside of this\r\npeculiar environment could not accomplish, will be accomplished by the\r\nlessening intensity of religious belief, as is already evident in the\r\nUnited States, where the distinction between Jew and Gentile is fast\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to me that the influence of this social net or environment\r\nwill explain what is so often taken as proof of race differences—the\r\ndifficulty which less civilized races show in receiving higher\r\ncivilization, and the manner in which some of them melt away before it.\r\nJust as one social environment persists, so does it render it difficult\r\nor impossible for those subject to it to accept another.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese character is fixed if that of any people is. Yet the\r\nChinese in California acquire American modes of working, trading,\r\nthe use of machinery, etc., with such facility as to prove that they\r\nhave no lack of flexibility, or natural capacity. That they do not\r\nchange in other respects is due to the Chinese environment that still\r\npersists and still surrounds them. Coming from China, they look forward\r\nto return to China, and live while here in a little China of their\r\nown, just as the Englishmen in India maintain a little England. It is\r\nnot merely that we naturally seek association with those who share\r\nour peculiarities, and that thus language, religion and custom tend\r\nto persist where individuals are not absolutely isolated; but that\r\nthese differences provoke an external pressure, which compels such\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThese obvious principles fully account for all the phenomena which\r\nare seen in the meeting of one stage or body of culture with another,\r\nwithout resort to the theory of ingrained differences. For instance,\r\nas comparative philology has shown, the Hindoo is of the same race as\r\nhis English conqueror, and individual instances have abundantly shown\r\nthat if he could be placed completely and exclusively in the English\r\nenvironment (which, as before stated, could be thoroughly done only by\r\nplacing infants in English families in such a way that neither they,\r\nas they grow up, nor those around them, would be conscious of any\r\ndistinction) one generation would be all required to thoroughly implant\r\nEuropean civilization. But the progress of English ideas and habits in\r\nIndia must be necessarily very slow, because they meet there the web of\r\nideas and habits constantly perpetuated through an immense population,\r\nand interlaced with every act of life.\r\n\r\nMr. Bagehot (“Physics and Politics”) endeavors to explain the reason\r\nwhy barbarians waste away before our civilization, while they did\r\nnot before that of the ancients, by assuming that the progress of\r\ncivilization has given us tougher physical constitutions. After\r\nalluding to the fact that there is no lament in any classical writer\r\nfor the barbarians, but that everywhere the barbarian endured the\r\ncontact with the Roman and the Roman allied himself to the barbarian,\r\nhe says (pp. 47-8):\r\n\r\n “Savages in the first year of the Christian era were pretty much what\r\n they were in the eighteen hundredth; and if they stood the contact of\r\n ancient civilized men and cannot stand ours, it follows that our race\r\n is presumably tougher than the ancient; for we have to bear, and do\r\n bear, the seeds of greater diseases than the ancients carried with\r\n them. We may use, perhaps, the unvarying savage as a meter to gauge\r\n the vigor of the constitution to whose contact he is exposed.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bagehot does not attempt to explain how it is that eighteen\r\nhundred years ago civilization did not give the like relative advantage\r\nover barbarism that it does now. But there is no use of talking\r\nabout that, or of the lack of proof that the human constitution has\r\nbeen a whit improved. To any one who has seen how the contact of our\r\ncivilization affects the inferior races, a much readier though less\r\nflattering explanation will occur.\r\n\r\nIt is not because our constitutions are naturally tougher than those\r\nof the savage, that diseases which are comparatively innocuous to us\r\nare certain death to him. It is that we know and have the means of\r\ntreating those diseases, while he is destitute both of knowledge and\r\nmeans. The same diseases with which the scum of civilization that\r\nfloats in its advance inoculates the savage would prove as destructive\r\nto civilized men, if they knew no better than to let them run, as he\r\nin his ignorance has to let them run; and as a matter of fact they\r\nwere as destructive, until we found out how to treat them. And not\r\nmerely this, but the effect of the impingement of civilization upon\r\nbarbarism is to weaken the power of the savage without bringing him\r\ninto the conditions that give power to the civilized man. While his\r\nhabits and customs still tend to persist, and do persist as far as they\r\ncan, the conditions to which they were adapted are forcibly changed.\r\nHe is a hunter in a land stripped of game; a warrior deprived of his\r\narms and called on to plead in legal technicalities. He is not merely\r\nplaced between cultures, but, as Mr. Bagehot says of the European\r\nhalf-breeds in India, he is placed between moralities, and learns the\r\nvices of civilization without its virtues. He loses his accustomed\r\nmeans of subsistence, he loses self-respect, he loses morality; he\r\ndeteriorates and dies away. The miserable creatures who may be seen\r\nhanging around frontier towns or railroad stations, ready to beg, or\r\nsteal, or solicit a viler commerce, are not fair representatives of the\r\nIndian before the white man had encroached upon his hunting grounds.\r\nThey have lost the strength and virtues of their former state, without\r\ngaining those of a higher. In fact, civilization, as it pushes the red\r\nman, shows no virtues. To the Anglo-Saxon of the frontier, as a rule,\r\nthe aborigine has no rights which the white man is bound to respect.\r\nHe is impoverished, misunderstood, cheated, and abused. He dies\r\nout, as, under similar conditions, we should die out. He disappears\r\nbefore civilization as the Romanized Britons disappeared before Saxon\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\nThe true reason why there is no lament in any classic writer for the\r\nbarbarian, but that the Roman civilization assimilated instead of\r\ndestroying, is, I take it, to be found not only in the fact that the\r\nancient civilization was much nearer akin to the barbarians which\r\nit met, but in the more important fact that it was not extended as\r\nours has been. It was carried forward, not by an advancing line of\r\ncolonists, but by conquest which merely reduced the new province to\r\ngeneral subjection, leaving the social, and generally the political\r\norganization of the people to a great degree unimpaired, so that,\r\nwithout shattering or deterioration, the process of assimilation went\r\non. In a somewhat similar way the civilization of Japan seems to be now\r\nassimilating itself to European civilization.\r\n\r\nIn America the Anglo-Saxon has exterminated, instead of civilizing,\r\nthe Indian, simply because he has not brought the Indian into his\r\nenvironment, nor yet has the contact been in such a way as to induce\r\nor permit the Indian web of habitual thought and custom to be changed\r\nrapidly enough to meet the new conditions into which he has been\r\nbrought by the proximity of new and powerful neighbors. That there is\r\nno innate impediment to the reception of our civilization by these\r\nuncivilized races has been shown over and over again in individual\r\ncases. And it has likewise been shown, so far as the experiments have\r\nbeen permitted to go, by the Jesuits in Paraguay, the Franciscans in\r\nCalifornia, and the Protestant missionaries on some of the Pacific\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of physical improvement in the race within any time\r\nof which we have knowledge is utterly without warrant, and within\r\nthe time of which Mr. Bagehot speaks, it is absolutely disproved. We\r\nknow from classic statues, from the burdens carried and the marches\r\nmade by ancient soldiers, from the records of runners and the feats\r\nof gymnasts, that neither in proportions nor strength has the race\r\nimproved within two thousand years. But the assumption of mental\r\nimprovement, which is even more confidently and generally made, is\r\nstill more preposterous. As poets, artists, architects, philosophers,\r\nrhetoricians, statesmen, or soldiers, can modern civilization show\r\nindividuals of greater mental power than can the ancient? There is no\r\nuse in recalling names—every schoolboy knows them. For our models and\r\npersonifications of mental power we go back to the ancients, and if\r\nwe can for a moment imagine the possibility of what is held by that\r\noldest and most widespread of all beliefs—that belief which Lessing\r\ndeclared on this account the most probably true, though he accepted it\r\non metaphysical grounds—and suppose Homer or Virgil, Demosthenes or\r\nCicero, Alexander, Hannibal or Cæsar, Plato or Lucretius, Euclid or\r\nAristotle, as re-entering this life again in the Nineteenth Century,\r\ncan we suppose that they would show any inferiority to the men of\r\nto-day? Or if we take any period since the classic age, even the\r\ndarkest, or any previous period of which we know anything, shall we\r\nnot find men who in the conditions and degree of knowledge of their\r\ntimes showed mental power of as high an order as men show now? And\r\namong the less advanced races do we not to-day, whenever our attention\r\nis called to them, find men who in their conditions exhibit mental\r\nqualities as great as civilization can show? Did the invention of the\r\nrailroad, coming when it did, prove any greater inventive power than\r\ndid the invention of the wheelbarrow when wheelbarrows were not? We of\r\nmodern civilization are raised far above those who have preceded us\r\nand those of the less advanced races who are our contemporaries. But\r\nit is because we stand on a pyramid, not that we are taller. What the\r\ncenturies have done for us is not to increase our stature, but to build\r\nup a structure on which we may plant our feet.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat: I do not mean to say that all men possess the same\r\ncapacities, or are mentally alike, any more than I mean to say that\r\nthey are physically alike. Among all the countless millions who have\r\ncome and gone on this earth, there were probably never two who either\r\nphysically or mentally were exact counterparts. Nor yet do I mean to\r\nsay that there are not as clearly marked race differences in mind as\r\nthere are clearly marked race differences in body. I do not deny the\r\ninfluence of heredity in transmitting peculiarities of mind in the\r\nsame way, and possibly to the same degree, as bodily peculiarities\r\nare transmitted. But nevertheless, there is, it seems to me, a common\r\nstandard and natural symmetry of mind, as there is of body, toward\r\nwhich all deviations tend to return. The conditions under which we fall\r\nmay produce such distortions as the Flatheads produce by compressing\r\nthe heads of their infants or the Chinese by binding their daughters’\r\nfeet. But as Flathead babies continue to be born with naturally shaped\r\nheads and Chinese babies with naturally shaped feet, so does nature\r\nseem to revert to the normal mental type. A child no more inherits\r\nhis father’s knowledge than he inherits his father’s glass eye or\r\nartificial leg; the child of the most ignorant parents may become a\r\npioneer of science or a leader of thought.\r\n\r\nBut this is the great fact with which we are concerned: That the\r\ndifferences between the people of communities in different places\r\nand at different times, which we call differences of civilization,\r\nare not differences which inhere in the individuals, but differences\r\nwhich inhere in the society; that they are not, as Herbert Spencer\r\nholds, differences resulting from differences in the units; but that\r\nthey are differences resulting from the conditions under which these\r\nunits are brought in the society. In short, I take the explanation\r\nof the differences which distinguish communities to be this: That\r\neach society, small or great, necessarily weaves for itself a web of\r\nknowledge, beliefs, customs, language, tastes, institutions, and laws.\r\nInto this web, woven by each society, or rather, into these webs,\r\nfor each community above the simplest is made up of minor societies,\r\nwhich overlap and interlace each other, the individual is received at\r\nbirth and continues until his death. This is the matrix in which mind\r\nunfolds and from which it takes its stamp. This is the way in which\r\ncustoms, and religions, and prejudices, and tastes, and languages,\r\ngrow up and are perpetuated. This is the way that skill is transmitted\r\nand knowledge is stored up, and the discoveries of one time made the\r\ncommon stock and stepping stone of the next. Though it is this that\r\noften offers the most serious obstacles to progress, it is this that\r\nmakes progress possible. It is this that enables any schoolboy in our\r\ntime to learn in a few hours more of the universe than Ptolemy knew;\r\nthat places the most humdrum scientist far above the level reached by\r\nthe giant mind of Aristotle. This is to the race what memory is to the\r\nindividual. Our wonderful arts, our far-reaching science, our marvelous\r\ninventions—they have come through this.\r\n\r\nHuman progress goes on as the advances made by one generation are in\r\nthis way secured as the common property of the next, and made the\r\nstarting point for new advances.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] Wordsworth, in his “Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle,” has in\r\nhighly poetical form alluded to this influence:\r\n\r\n    Armor rusting in his halls\r\n    On the blood of Clifford calls:\r\n    “Quell the Scot,” exclaims the lance;\r\n    “Bear me to the heart of France,”\r\n    Is the longing of the shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF HUMAN PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the law of human progress—the law under which\r\ncivilization advances?\r\n\r\nIt must explain clearly and definitely, and not by vague generalities\r\nor superficial analogies, why, though mankind started presumably with\r\nthe same capacities and at the same time, there now exist such wide\r\ndifferences in social development. It must account for the arrested\r\ncivilizations and for the decayed and destroyed civilizations; for the\r\ngeneral facts as to the rise of civilization, and for the petrifying\r\nor enervating force which the progress of civilization has heretofore\r\nalways evolved. It must account for retrogression as well as for\r\nprogression; for the differences in general character between Asiatic\r\nand European civilizations; for the difference between classical and\r\nmodern civilizations; for the different rates at which progress goes\r\non; and for those bursts, and starts, and halts of progress which are\r\nso marked as minor phenomena. And, thus, it must show us what are the\r\nessential conditions of progress, and what social adjustments advance\r\nand what retard it.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to discover such a law. We have but to look and\r\nwe may see it. I do not pretend to give it scientific precision, but\r\nmerely to point it out.\r\n\r\nThe incentives to progress are the desires inherent in human nature—the\r\ndesire to gratify the wants of the animal nature, the wants of the\r\nintellectual nature, and the wants of the sympathetic nature; the\r\ndesire to be, to know, and to do—desires that short of infinity can\r\nnever be satisfied, as they grow by what they feed on.\r\n\r\nMind is the instrument by which man advances, and by which each advance\r\nis secured and made the vantage ground for new advances. Though he may\r\nnot by taking thought add a cubit to his stature, man may by taking\r\nthought extend his knowledge of the universe and his power over it,\r\nin what, so far as we can see, is an infinite degree. The narrow span\r\nof human life allows the individual to go but a short distance, but\r\nthough each generation may do but little, yet generations, succeeding\r\nto the gain of their predecessors, may gradually elevate the status of\r\nmankind, as coral polyps, building one generation upon the work of the\r\nother, gradually elevate themselves from the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nMental power is, therefore, the motor of progress, and men tend to\r\nadvance in proportion to the mental power expended in progression—the\r\nmental power which is devoted to the extension of knowledge, the\r\nimprovement of methods, and the betterment of social conditions.\r\n\r\nNow mental power is a fixed quantity—that is to say, there is a limit\r\nto the work a man can do with his mind, as there is to the work\r\nhe can do with his body; therefore, the mental power which can be\r\ndevoted to progress is only what is left after what is required for\r\nnon-progressive purposes.\r\n\r\nThese non-progressive purposes in which mental power is consumed may be\r\nclassified as maintenance and conflict. By maintenance I mean, not only\r\nthe support of existence, but the keeping up of the social condition\r\nand the holding of advances already gained. By conflict I mean not\r\nmerely warfare and preparation for warfare, but all expenditure of\r\nmental power in seeking the gratification of desire at the expense of\r\nothers, and in resistance to such aggression.\r\n\r\nTo compare society to a boat. Her progress through the water will not\r\ndepend upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion devoted\r\nto propelling her. This will be lessened by any expenditure of force\r\nrequired for bailing, or any expenditure of force in fighting among\r\nthemselves, or in pulling in different directions.\r\n\r\nNow, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to\r\nmaintain existence, and mental power is set free for higher uses only\r\nby the association of men in communities, which permits the division\r\nof labor and all the economies which come with the co-operation of\r\nincreased numbers, association is the first essential of progress.\r\nImprovement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful\r\nassociation, and the wider and closer the association, the greater\r\nthe possibilities of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of\r\nmental power in conflict becomes greater or less as the moral law which\r\naccords to each an equality of rights is ignored or is recognized,\r\nequality (or justice) is the second essential of progress.\r\n\r\nThus association in equality is the law of progress. Association frees\r\nmental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or justice,\r\nor freedom—for the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition\r\nof the moral law—prevents the dissipation of this power in fruitless\r\nstruggles.\r\n\r\nHere is the law of progress, which will explain all diversities, all\r\nadvances, all halts, and retrogressions. Men tend to progress just as\r\nthey come closer together, and by co-operation with each other increase\r\nthe mental power that may be devoted to improvement, but just as\r\nconflict is provoked, or association develops inequality of condition\r\nand power, this tendency to progression is lessened, checked, and\r\nfinally reversed.\r\n\r\nGiven the same innate capacity, and it is evident that social\r\ndevelopment will go on faster or slower, will stop or turn back,\r\naccording to the resistances it meets. In a general way these\r\nobstacles to improvement may, in relation to the society itself, be\r\nclassed as external and internal—the first operating with greater\r\nforce in the earlier stages of civilization, the latter becoming more\r\nimportant in the later stages.\r\n\r\nMan is social in his nature. He does not require to be caught and tamed\r\nin order to induce him to live with his fellows. The utter helplessness\r\nwith which he enters the world, and the long period required for the\r\nmaturity of his powers, necessitate the family relation; which, as\r\nwe may observe, is wider, and in its extensions stronger, among the\r\nruder than among the more cultivated peoples. The first societies\r\nare families, expanding into tribes, still holding a mutual blood\r\nrelationship, and even when they have become great nations claiming a\r\ncommon descent.\r\n\r\nGiven beings of this kind, placed on a globe of such diversified\r\nsurface and climate as this, and it is evident that, even with\r\nequal capacity, and an equal start, social development must be very\r\ndifferent. The first limit or resistance to association will come\r\nfrom the conditions of physical nature, and as these greatly vary\r\nwith locality, corresponding differences in social progress must show\r\nthemselves. The net rapidity of increase, and the closeness with which\r\nmen, as they increase, can keep together, will, in the rude state\r\nof knowledge in which reliance for subsistence must be principally\r\nupon the spontaneous offerings of nature, very largely depend upon\r\nclimate, soil, and physical conformation. Where much animal food and\r\nwarm clothing are required; where the earth seems poor and niggard;\r\nwhere the exuberant life of tropical forests mocks barbarous man’s\r\npuny efforts to control; where mountains, deserts, or arms of the sea\r\nseparate and isolate men; association, and the power of improvement\r\nwhich it evolves, can at first go but a little way. But on the rich\r\nplains of warm climates, where human existence can be maintained with\r\na smaller expenditure of force, and from a much smaller area, men\r\ncan keep closer together, and the mental power which can at first be\r\ndevoted to improvement is much greater. Hence civilization naturally\r\nfirst arises in the great valleys and table lands where we find its\r\nearliest monuments.\r\n\r\nBut these diversities in natural conditions, not merely thus directly\r\nproduce diversities in social development, but, by producing\r\ndiversities in social development, bring out in man himself an\r\nobstacle, or rather an active counterforce, to improvement. As\r\nfamilies and tribes are separated from each other, the social feeling\r\nceases to operate between them, and differences arise in language,\r\ncustom, tradition, religion—in short, in the whole social web which\r\neach community, however small or large, constantly spins. With these\r\ndifferences, prejudices grow, animosities spring up, contact easily\r\nproduces quarrels, aggression begets aggression, and wrong kindles\r\nrevenge.[62] And so between these separate social aggregates arises the\r\nfeeling of Ishmael and the spirit of Cain, warfare becomes the chronic\r\nand seemingly natural relation of societies to each other, and the\r\npowers of men are expended in attack or defense, in mutual slaughter\r\nand mutual destruction of wealth, or in warlike preparations. How\r\nlong this hostility persists, the protective tariffs and the standing\r\narmies of the civilized world to-day bear witness; how difficult it is\r\nto get over the idea that it is not theft to steal from a foreigner,\r\nthe difficulty in procuring an international copyright act will show.\r\nCan we wonder at the perpetual hostilities of tribes and clans? Can we\r\nwonder that when each community was isolated from the others—when each,\r\nuninfluenced by the others, was spinning its separate web of social\r\nenvironment, which no individual can escape, that war should have been\r\nthe rule and peace the exception? “They were even as we are.”\r\n\r\nNow, warfare is the negation of association. The separation of men into\r\ndiverse tribes, by increasing warfare, thus checks improvement; while\r\nin the localities where a large increase in numbers is possible without\r\nmuch separation, civilization gains the advantage of exemption from\r\ntribal war, even when the community as a whole is carrying on warfare\r\nbeyond its borders. Thus, where the resistance of nature to the close\r\nassociation of men is slightest, the counterforce of warfare is likely\r\nat first to be least felt; and in the rich plains where civilization\r\nfirst begins, it may rise to a great height while scattered tribes are\r\nyet barbarous. And thus, when small, separated communities exist in a\r\nstate of chronic warfare which forbids advance, the first step to their\r\ncivilization is the advent of some conquering tribe or nation that\r\nunites these smaller communities into a larger one, in which internal\r\npeace is preserved. Where this power of peaceable association is broken\r\nup, either by external assaults or internal dissensions, the advance\r\nceases and retrogression begins.\r\n\r\nBut it is not conquest alone that has operated to promote association,\r\nand, by liberating mental power from the necessities of warfare,\r\nto promote civilization. If the diversities of climate, soil, and\r\nconfiguration of the earth’s surface operate at first to separate\r\nmankind, they also operate to encourage exchange. And commerce, which\r\nis in itself a form of association or co-operation, operates to promote\r\ncivilization, not only directly, but by building up interests which are\r\nopposed to warfare, and dispelling the ignorance which is the fertile\r\nmother of prejudices and animosities.\r\n\r\nAnd so of religion. Though the forms it has assumed and the animosities\r\nit has aroused have often sundered men and produced warfare, yet it\r\nhas at other times been the means of promoting association. A common\r\nworship has often, as among the Greeks, mitigated war and furnished\r\nthe basis of union, while it is from the triumph of Christianity over\r\nthe barbarians of Europe that modern civilization springs. Had not the\r\nChristian Church existed when the Roman Empire went to pieces, Europe,\r\ndestitute of any bond of association, might have fallen to a condition\r\nnot much above that of the North American Indians or only received\r\ncivilization with an Asiatic impress from the conquering scimitars\r\nof the invading hordes which had been welded into a mighty power by\r\na religion which, springing up in the deserts of Arabia, had united\r\ntribes separated from time immemorial, and, thence issuing, brought\r\ninto the association of a common faith a great part of the human race.\r\n\r\nLooking over what we know of the history of the world, we thus see\r\ncivilization everywhere springing up where men are brought into\r\nassociation, and everywhere disappearing as this association is broken\r\nup. Thus the Roman civilization, spread over Europe by the conquests\r\nwhich insured internal peace, was overwhelmed by the incursions of the\r\nnorthern nations that broke society again into disconnected fragments;\r\nand the progress that now goes on in our modern civilization began as\r\nthe feudal system again began to associate men in larger communities,\r\nand the spiritual supremacy of Rome to bring these communities into a\r\ncommon relation, as her legions had done before. As the feudal bonds\r\ngrew into national autonomies, and Christianity worked the amelioration\r\nof manners, brought forth the knowledge that during the dark days she\r\nhad hidden, bound the threads of peaceful union in her all-pervading\r\norganization, and taught association in her religious orders, a greater\r\nprogress became possible, which, as men have been brought into closer\r\nand closer association and co-operation, has gone on with greater and\r\ngreater force.\r\n\r\nBut we shall never understand the course of civilization, and the\r\nvaried phenomena which its history presents, without a consideration\r\nof what I may term the internal resistances, or counter forces, which\r\narise in the heart of advancing society, and which can alone explain\r\nhow a civilization once fairly started should either come of itself to\r\na halt or be destroyed by barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe mental power, which is the motor of social progress, is set free by\r\nassociation, which is, what, perhaps, it may be more properly called,\r\nan integration. Society in this process becomes more complex; its\r\nindividuals more dependent upon each other. Occupations and functions\r\nare specialized. Instead of wandering, population becomes fixed.\r\nInstead of each man attempting to supply all of his wants, the various\r\ntrades and industries are separated—one man acquires skill in one\r\nthing, and another in another thing. So, too, of knowledge, the body\r\nof which constantly tends to become vaster than one man can grasp,\r\nand is separated into different parts, which different individuals\r\nacquire and pursue. So, too, the performance of religious ceremonies\r\ntends to pass into the hands of a body of men specially devoted to that\r\npurpose, and the preservation of order, the administration of justice,\r\nthe assignment of public duties and the distribution of awards, the\r\nconduct of war, etc., to be made the special functions of an organized\r\ngovernment. In short, to use the language in which Herbert Spencer\r\nhas defined evolution, the development of society is, in relation to\r\nits component individuals, the passing from an indefinite, incoherent\r\nhomogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity. The lower the\r\nstage of social development, the more society resembles one of those\r\nlowest of animal organisms which are without organs or limbs, and from\r\nwhich a part may be cut and yet live. The higher the stage of social\r\ndevelopment, the more society resembles those higher organisms in\r\nwhich functions and powers are specialized, and each member is vitally\r\ndependent on the others.\r\n\r\nNow, this process of integration, of the specialization of functions\r\nand powers, as it goes on in society, is, by virtue of what is probably\r\none of the deepest laws of human nature, accompanied by a constant\r\nliability to inequality. I do not mean that inequality is the necessary\r\nresult of social growth, but that it is the constant tendency of social\r\ngrowth if unaccompanied by changes in social adjustments, which, in\r\nthe new conditions that growth produces, will secure equality. I\r\nmean, so to speak, that the garment of laws, customs, and political\r\ninstitutions, which each society weaves for itself, is constantly\r\ntending to become too tight as the society develops. I mean, so to\r\nspeak, that man, as he advances, threads a labyrinth, in which, if he\r\nkeeps straight ahead, he will infallibly lose his way, and through\r\nwhich reason and justice can alone keep him continuously in an\r\nascending path.\r\n\r\nFor, while the integration which accompanies growth tends in itself to\r\nset free mental power to work improvement, there is, both with increase\r\nof numbers and with increase in complexity of the social organization,\r\na counter tendency set up to the production of a state of inequality,\r\nwhich wastes mental power, and, as it increases, brings improvement to\r\na halt.\r\n\r\nTo trace to its highest expression the law which thus operates to\r\nevolve with progress the force which stops progress, would be, it seems\r\nto me, to go far to the solution of a problem deeper than that of the\r\ngenesis of the material universe—the problem of the genesis of evil.\r\nLet me content myself with pointing out the manner in which, as society\r\ndevelops, there arise tendencies which check development.\r\n\r\nThere are two qualities of human nature which it will be well, however,\r\nto first call to mind. The one is the power of habit—the tendency to\r\ncontinue to do things in the same way; the other is the possibility\r\nof mental and moral deterioration. The effect of the first in social\r\ndevelopment is to continue habits, customs, laws and methods, long\r\nafter they have lost their original usefulness, and the effect of the\r\nother is to permit the growth of institutions and modes of thought from\r\nwhich the normal perceptions of men instinctively revolt.\r\n\r\nNow the growth and development of society not merely tend to make\r\neach more and more dependent upon all, and to lessen the influence\r\nof individuals, even over their own conditions, as compared with the\r\ninfluence of society; but the effect of association or integration is\r\nto give rise to a collective power which is distinguishable from the\r\nsum of individual powers. Analogies, or, perhaps, rather illustrations\r\nof the same law, may be found in all directions. As animal organisms\r\nincrease in complexity, there arise, above the life and power of the\r\nparts, a life and power of the integrated whole; above the capability\r\nof involuntary movements, the capability of voluntary movements. The\r\nactions and impulses of bodies of men are, as has often been observed,\r\ndifferent from those which, under the same circumstances, would be\r\ncalled forth in individuals. The fighting qualities of a regiment may\r\nbe very different from those of the individual soldiers. But there is\r\nno need of illustrations. In our inquiries into the nature and rise\r\nof rent, we traced the very thing to which I allude. Where population\r\nis sparse, land has no value; just as men congregate together, the\r\nvalue of land appears and rises—a clearly distinguishable thing from\r\nthe values produced by individual effort; a value which springs\r\nfrom association, which increases as association grows greater, and\r\ndisappears as association is broken up. And the same thing is true of\r\npower in other forms than those generally expressed in terms of wealth.\r\n\r\nNow, as society grows, the disposition to continue previous social\r\nadjustments tends to lodge this collective power, as it arises, in the\r\nhands of a portion of the community; and this unequal distribution\r\nof the wealth and power gained as society advances tends to produce\r\ngreater inequality, since aggression grows by what it feeds on, and the\r\nidea of justice is blurred by the habitual toleration of injustice.\r\n\r\nIn this way the patriarchal organization of society can easily grow\r\ninto hereditary monarchy, in which the king is as a god on earth, and\r\nthe masses of the people mere slaves of his caprice. It is natural that\r\nthe father should be the directing head of the family, and that at his\r\ndeath the eldest son, as the oldest and most experienced member of the\r\nlittle community, should succeed to the headship. But to continue this\r\narrangement as the family expands, is to lodge power in a particular\r\nline, and the power thus lodged necessarily continues to increase,\r\nas the common stock becomes larger and larger, and the power of the\r\ncommunity grows. The head of the family passes into the hereditary\r\nking, who comes to look upon himself and to be looked upon by others\r\nas a being of superior rights. With the growth of the collective power\r\nas compared with the power of the individual, his power to reward and\r\nto punish increases, and so increase the inducements to flatter and to\r\nfear him; until finally, if the process be not disturbed, a nation\r\ngrovels at the foot of a throne, and a hundred thousand men toil for\r\nfifty years to prepare a tomb for one of their own mortal kind.\r\n\r\nSo the war-chief of a little band of savages is but one of their\r\nnumber, whom they follow as their bravest and most wary. But when large\r\nbodies come to act together, personal selection becomes more difficult,\r\na blinder obedience becomes necessary and can be enforced, and from the\r\nvery necessities of warfare when conducted on a large scale absolute\r\npower arises.\r\n\r\nAnd so of the specialization of function. There is a manifest gain in\r\nproductive power when social growth has gone so far that instead of\r\nevery producer being summoned from his work for fighting purposes, a\r\nregular military force can be specialized; but this inevitably tends\r\nto the concentration of power in the hands of the military class or\r\ntheir chiefs. The preservation of internal order, the administration\r\nof justice, the construction and care of public works, and, notably,\r\nthe observances of religion, all tend in similar manner to pass into\r\nthe hands of special classes, whose disposition it is to magnify their\r\nfunction and extend their power.\r\n\r\nBut the great cause of inequality is in the natural monopoly which\r\nis given by the possession of land. The first perceptions of men\r\nseem always to be that land is common property; but the rude devices\r\nby which this is at first recognized—such as annual partitions\r\nor cultivation in common—are consistent with only a low stage of\r\ndevelopment. The idea of property, which naturally arises with\r\nreference to things of human production, is easily transferred to\r\nland, and an institution which when population is sparse merely\r\nsecures to the improver and user the due reward of his labor, finally,\r\nas population becomes dense and rent arises, operates to strip the\r\nproducer of his wages. Not merely this, but the appropriation of rent\r\nfor public purposes, which is the only way in which, with anything like\r\na high development, land can be readily retained as common property,\r\nbecomes, when political and religious power passes into the hands of\r\na class, the ownership of the land by that class, and the rest of the\r\ncommunity become merely tenants. And wars and conquests, which tend to\r\nthe concentration of political power and to the institution of slavery,\r\nnaturally result, where social growth has given land a value, in the\r\nappropriation of the soil. A dominant class, who concentrate power in\r\ntheir hands, will likewise soon concentrate ownership of the land. To\r\nthem will fall large partitions of conquered land, which the former\r\ninhabitants will till as tenants or serfs, and the public domain, or\r\ncommon lands, which in the natural course of social growth are left\r\nfor awhile in every country, and in which state the primitive system\r\nof village culture leaves pasture and woodland, are readily acquired,\r\nas we see by modern instances. And inequality once established, the\r\nownership of land tends to concentrate as development goes on.\r\n\r\nI am merely attempting to set forth the general fact that as a social\r\ndevelopment goes on, inequality tends to establish itself, and not to\r\npoint out the particular sequence, which must necessarily vary with\r\ndifferent conditions. But this main fact makes intelligible all the\r\nphenomena of petrifaction and retrogression. The unequal distribution\r\nof the power and wealth gained by the integration of men in society\r\ntends to check, and finally to counterbalance, the force by which\r\nimprovements are made and society advances. On the one side, the\r\nmasses of the community are compelled to expend their mental powers\r\nin merely maintaining existence. On the other side, mental power is\r\nexpended in keeping up and intensifying the system of inequality, in\r\nostentation, luxury, and warfare. A community divided into a class\r\nthat rules and a class that is ruled—into the very rich and the very\r\npoor, may “build like giants and finish like jewelers;” but it will be\r\nmonuments of ruthless pride and barren vanity, or of a religion turned\r\nfrom its office of elevating man into an instrument for keeping him\r\ndown. Invention may for awhile to some degree go on; but it will be the\r\ninvention of refinements in luxury, not the inventions that relieve\r\ntoil and increase power. In the arcana of temples or in the chambers of\r\ncourt physicians knowledge may still be sought; but it will be hidden\r\nas a secret thing, or if it dares come out to elevate common thought or\r\nbrighten common life, it will be trodden down as a dangerous innovator.\r\nFor as it tends to lessen the mental power devoted to improvement, so\r\ndoes inequality tend to render men adverse to improvement. How strong\r\nis the disposition to adhere to old methods among the classes who are\r\nkept in ignorance by being compelled to toil for a mere existence,\r\nis too well known to require illustration, and on the other hand the\r\nconservatism of the classes to whom the existing social adjustment\r\ngives special advantages is equally apparent. This tendency to resist\r\ninnovation, even though it be improvement, is observable in every\r\nspecial organization—in religion, in law, in medicine, in science, in\r\ntrade guilds; and it becomes intense just as the organization is close.\r\nA close corporation has always an instinctive dislike of innovation and\r\ninnovators, which is but the expression of an instinctive fear that\r\nchange may tend to throw down the barriers which hedge it in from the\r\ncommon herd, and so rob it of importance and power; and it is always\r\ndisposed to guard carefully its special knowledge or skill.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that petrifaction succeeds progress. The advance of\r\ninequality necessarily brings improvement to a halt, and as it still\r\npersists or provokes unavailing reactions, draws even upon the mental\r\npower necessary for maintenance, and retrogression begins.\r\n\r\nThese principles make intelligible the history of civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the localities where climate, soil, and physical conformation tended\r\nleast to separate men as they increased, and where, accordingly,\r\nthe first civilizations grew up, the internal resistances to\r\nprogress would naturally develop in a more regular and thorough\r\nmanner than where smaller communities, which in their separation\r\nhad developed diversities, were afterward brought together into a\r\ncloser association. It is this, it seems to me, which accounts for\r\nthe general characteristics of the earlier civilizations as compared\r\nwith the later civilizations of Europe. Such homogeneous communities,\r\ndeveloping from the first without the jar of conflict between different\r\ncustoms, laws, religions, etc., would show a much greater uniformity.\r\nThe concentrating and conservative forces would all, so to speak, pull\r\ntogether. Rival chieftains would not counterbalance each other, nor\r\ndiversities of belief hold the growth of priestly influence in check.\r\nPolitical and religious power, wealth and knowledge, would thus tend\r\nto concentrate in the same centers. The same causes which tended to\r\nproduce the hereditary king and hereditary priest would tend to produce\r\nthe hereditary artisan and laborer, and to separate society into\r\ncastes. The power which association sets free for progress would thus\r\nbe wasted, and barriers to further progress be gradually raised. The\r\nsurplus energies of the masses would be devoted to the construction\r\nof temples, palaces, and pyramids; to ministering to the pride and\r\npampering the luxury of their rulers; and should any disposition to\r\nimprovement arise among the classes of leisure it would at once be\r\nchecked by the dread of innovation. Society developing in this way must\r\nat length stop in a conservatism which permits no further progress.\r\n\r\nHow long such a state of complete petrifaction, when once reached,\r\nwill continue, seems to depend upon external causes, for the iron bonds\r\nof the social environment which grows up repress disintegrating forces\r\nas well as improvement. Such a community can be most easily conquered,\r\nfor the masses of the people are trained to a passive acquiescence in\r\na life of hopeless labor. If the conquerors merely take the place of\r\nthe ruling class, as the Hyksos did in Egypt and the Tartars in China,\r\neverything will go on as before. If they ravage and destroy, the glory\r\nof palace and temple remains but in ruins, population becomes sparse,\r\nand knowledge and art are lost.\r\n\r\nEuropean civilization differs in character from civilizations of\r\nthe Egyptian type because it springs not from the association of a\r\nhomogeneous people developing from the beginning, or at least for\r\na long time, under the same conditions, but from the association\r\nof peoples who in separation had acquired distinctive social\r\ncharacteristics, and whose smaller organizations longer prevented\r\nthe concentration of power and wealth in one center. The physical\r\nconformation of the Grecian peninsula is such as to separate the people\r\nat first into a number of small communities. As those petty republics\r\nand nominal kingdoms ceased to waste their energies in warfare, and the\r\npeaceable co-operation of commerce extended, the light of civilization\r\nblazed up. But the principle of association was never strong enough\r\nto save Greece from inter-tribal war, and when this was put an end to\r\nby conquest, the tendency to inequality, which had been combated with\r\nvarious devices by Grecian sages and statesmen, worked its result, and\r\nGrecian valor, art, and literature became things of the past. And so in\r\nthe rise and extension, the decline and fall, of Roman civilization,\r\nmay be seen the working of these two principles of association and\r\nequality, from the combination of which springs progress.\r\n\r\nSpringing from the association of the independent husbandmen and\r\nfree citizens of Italy, and gaining fresh strength from conquests\r\nwhich brought hostile nations into common relations, the Roman power\r\nhushed the world in peace. But the tendency to inequality, checking\r\nreal progress from the first, increased as the Roman civilization\r\nextended. The Roman civilization did not petrify as did the homogeneous\r\ncivilizations where the strong bonds of custom and superstition that\r\nheld the people in subjection probably also protected them, or at any\r\nrate kept the peace between rulers and ruled; it rotted, declined and\r\nfell. Long before Goth or Vandal had broken through the cordon of the\r\nlegions, even while her frontiers were advancing, Rome was dead at the\r\nheart. Great estates had ruined Italy. Inequality had dried up the\r\nstrength and destroyed the vigor of the Roman world. Government became\r\ndespotism, which even assassination could not temper; patriotism became\r\nservility; vices the most foul flouted themselves in public; literature\r\nsank to puerilities; learning was forgotten; fertile districts became\r\nwaste without the ravages of war—everywhere inequality produced decay,\r\npolitical, mental, moral, and material. The barbarism which overwhelmed\r\nRome came not from without, but from within. It was the necessary\r\nproduct of the system which had substituted slaves and colonii for the\r\nindependent husbandmen of Italy, and carved the provinces into estates\r\nof senatorial families.\r\n\r\nModern civilization owes its superiority to the growth of equality with\r\nthe growth of association. Two great causes contributed to this—the\r\nsplitting up of concentrated power into innumerable little centers by\r\nthe influx of the Northern nations, and the influence of Christianity.\r\nWithout the first there would have been the petrifaction and slow decay\r\nof the Eastern Empire, where church and state were closely married and\r\nloss of external power brought no relief of internal tyranny. And but\r\nfor the other there would have been barbarism, without principle of\r\nassociation or amelioration. The petty chiefs and allodial lords who\r\neverywhere grasped local sovereignty held each other in check. Italian\r\ncities recovered their ancient liberty, free towns were founded,\r\nvillage communities took root, and serfs acquired rights in the soil\r\nthey tilled. The leaven of Teutonic ideas of equality worked through\r\nthe disorganized and disjointed fabric of society. And although society\r\nwas split up into an innumerable number of separated fragments, yet\r\nthe idea of closer association was always present—it existed in the\r\nrecollections of a universal empire; it existed in the claims of a\r\nuniversal church.\r\n\r\nThough Christianity became distorted and alloyed in percolating\r\nthrough a rotting civilization; though pagan gods were taken into her\r\npantheon, and pagan forms into her ritual, and pagan ideas into her\r\ncreed; yet her essential idea of the equality of men was never wholly\r\ndestroyed. And two things happened of the utmost moment to incipient\r\ncivilization—the establishment of the papacy and the celibacy of the\r\nclergy. The first prevented the spiritual power from concentrating in\r\nthe same lines as the temporal power; and the latter prevented the\r\nestablishment of a priestly caste, during a time when all power tended\r\nto hereditary form.\r\n\r\nIn her efforts for the abolition of slavery; in her Truce of God;\r\nin her monastic orders; in her councils which united nations, and\r\nher edicts which ran without regard to political boundaries; in the\r\nlow-born hands in which she placed a sign before which the proudest\r\nknelt; in her bishops who by consecration became the peers of the\r\ngreatest nobles; in her “Servant of Servants,” for so his official\r\ntitle ran, who, by virtue of the ring of a simple fisherman, claimed\r\nthe right to arbitrate between nations, and whose stirrup was held\r\nby kings; the Church, in spite of everything, was yet a promoter of\r\nassociation, a witness for the natural equality of men; and by the\r\nChurch herself was nurtured a spirit that, when her early work of\r\nassociation and emancipation was well-nigh done—when the ties she had\r\nknit had become strong, and the learning she had preserved had been\r\ngiven to the world—broke the chains with which she would have fettered\r\nthe human mind, and in a great part of Europe rent her organization.\r\n\r\nThe rise and growth of European civilization is too vast and complex\r\na subject to be thrown into proper perspective and relation in a\r\nfew paragraphs; but in all its details, as in its main features, it\r\nillustrates the truth that progress goes on just as society tends\r\ntoward closer association and greater equality. Civilization is\r\nco-operation. Union and liberty are its factors. The great extension of\r\nassociation—not alone in the growth of larger and denser communities,\r\nbut in the increase of commerce and the manifold exchanges which\r\nknit each community together and link them with other though widely\r\nseparated communities; the growth of international and municipal law;\r\nthe advances in security of property and of person, in individual\r\nliberty, and towards democratic government—advances, in short, towards\r\nthe recognition of the equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness—it is these that make our modern civilization so much\r\ngreater, so much higher, than any that has gone before. It is these\r\nthat have set free the mental power which has rolled back the veil of\r\nignorance which hid all but a small portion of the globe from men’s\r\nknowledge; which has measured the orbits of the circling spheres and\r\nbids us see moving, pulsing life in a drop of water; which has opened\r\nto us the antechamber of nature’s mysteries and read the secrets of a\r\nlong-buried past; which has harnessed in our service physical forces\r\nbeside which man’s efforts are puny; and increased productive power by\r\na thousand great inventions.\r\n\r\nIn that spirit of fatalism to which I have alluded as pervading current\r\nliterature, it is the fashion to speak even of war and slavery as means\r\nof human progress. But war, which is the opposite of association,\r\ncan aid progress only when it prevents further war or breaks down\r\nanti-social barriers which are themselves passive war.\r\n\r\nAs for slavery, I cannot see how it could ever have aided in\r\nestablishing freedom, and freedom, the synonym of equality, is, from\r\nthe very rudest state in which man can be imagined, the stimulus and\r\ncondition of progress. Auguste Comte’s idea that the institution of\r\nslavery destroyed cannibalism is as fanciful as Elia’s humorous notion\r\nof the way mankind acquired a taste for roast pig. It assumes that\r\na propensity that has never been found developed in man save as the\r\nresult of the most unnatural conditions—the direst want or the most\r\nbrutalizing superstitions[63]—is an original impulse, and that he, even\r\nin his lowest state the highest of all animals, has natural appetites\r\nwhich the nobler brutes do not show. And so of the idea that slavery\r\nbegan civilization by giving slave owners leisure for improvement.\r\n\r\nSlavery never did and never could aid improvement. Whether the\r\ncommunity consist of a single master and a single slave, or of\r\nthousands of masters and millions of slaves, slavery necessarily\r\ninvolves a waste of human power; for not only is slave labor less\r\nproductive than free labor, but the power of masters is likewise\r\nwasted in holding and watching their slaves, and is called away\r\nfrom directions in which real improvement lies. From first to last,\r\nslavery, like every other denial of the natural equality of men, has\r\nhampered and prevented progress. Just in proportion as slavery plays an\r\nimportant part in the social organization does improvement cease. That\r\nin the classical world slavery was so universal, is undoubtedly the\r\nreason why the mental activity which so polished literature and refined\r\nart never hit on any of the great discoveries and inventions which\r\ndistinguish modern civilization. No slave-holding people ever were an\r\ninventive people. In a slave-holding community the upper classes may\r\nbecome luxurious and polished; but never inventive. Whatever degrades\r\nthe laborer and robs him of the fruits of his toil stifles the spirit\r\nof invention and forbids the utilization of inventions and discoveries\r\neven when made. To freedom alone is given the spell of power which\r\nsummons the genii in whose keeping are the treasures of earth and the\r\nviewless forces of the air.\r\n\r\nThe law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just as social\r\nadjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the equality of\r\nright between man and man, just as they insure to each the perfect\r\nliberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of every other,\r\nmust civilization advance. Just as they fail in this, must advancing\r\ncivilization come to a halt and recede. Political economy and social\r\nscience cannot teach any lessons that are not embraced in the simple\r\ntruths that were taught to poor fishermen and Jewish peasants by\r\nOne who eighteen hundred years ago was crucified—the simple truths\r\nwhich, beneath the warpings of selfishness and the distortions of\r\nsuperstition, seem to underlie every religion that has ever striven to\r\nformulate the spiritual yearnings of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] How easy it is for ignorance to pass into contempt and dislike;\r\nhow natural it is for us to consider any difference in manners,\r\ncustoms, religion, etc., as proof of the inferiority of those who\r\ndiffer from us, any one who has emancipated himself in any degree from\r\nprejudice, and who mixes with different classes, may see in civilized\r\nsociety. In religion, for instance, the spirit of the hymn—\r\n\r\n    “I’d rather be a Baptist, and wear a shining face,\r\n    Than for to be a Methodist and always fall from grace,”\r\n\r\nis observable in all denominations. As the English Bishop said,\r\n“Orthodoxy is my doxy, and heterodoxy is any other doxy,” while the\r\nuniversal tendency is to classify all outside of the orthodoxies and\r\nheterodoxies of the prevailing religion as heathens or atheists. And\r\nthe like tendency is observable as to all other differences.\r\n\r\n[63] The Sandwich Islanders did honor to their good chiefs by eating\r\ntheir bodies. Their bad and tyrannical chiefs they would not touch. The\r\nNew Zealanders had a notion that by eating their enemies they acquired\r\ntheir strength and valor. And this seems to be the general origin of\r\neating prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW MODERN CIVILIZATION MAY DECLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion we have thus reached harmonizes completely with our\r\nprevious conclusions.\r\n\r\nThis consideration of the law of human progress not only brings the\r\npolitico-economic laws, which in this inquiry we have worked out,\r\nwithin the scope of a higher law—perhaps the very highest law our minds\r\ncan grasp—but it proves that the making of land common property in the\r\nway I have proposed would give an enormous impetus to civilization,\r\nwhile the refusal to do so must entail retrogression. A civilization\r\nlike ours must either advance or go back; it cannot stand still. It\r\nis not like those homogeneous civilizations, such as that of the Nile\r\nValley, which molded men for their places and put them in it like\r\nbricks into a pyramid. It much more resembles that civilization whose\r\nrise and fall is within historic times, and from which it sprung.\r\n\r\nThere is just now a disposition to scoff at any implication that we are\r\nnot in all respects progressing, and the spirit of our times is that of\r\nthe edict which the flattering premier proposed to the Chinese Emperor\r\nwho burned the ancient books—“that all who may dare to speak together\r\nabout the She and the Shoo be put to death; that those who make mention\r\nof the past so as to blame the present be put to death along with their\r\nrelatives.”\r\n\r\nYet it is evident that there have been times of decline, just as there\r\nhave been times of advance; and it is further evident that these epochs\r\nof decline could not at first have been generally recognized.\r\n\r\nHe would have been a rash man who, when Augustus was changing the\r\nRome of brick to the Rome of marble, when wealth was augmenting and\r\nmagnificence increasing, when victorious legions were extending the\r\nfrontier, when manners were becoming more refined, language more\r\npolished, and literature rising to higher splendors—he would have been\r\na rash man who then would have said that Rome was entering her decline.\r\nYet such was the case.\r\n\r\nAnd whoever will look may see that though our civilization is\r\napparently advancing with greater rapidity than ever, the same cause\r\nwhich turned Roman progress into retrogression is operating now.\r\n\r\nWhat has destroyed every previous civilization has been the tendency\r\nto the unequal distribution of wealth and power. This same tendency,\r\noperating with increasing force, is observable in our civilization\r\nto-day, showing itself in every progressive community, and with greater\r\nintensity the more progressive the community. Wages and interest tend\r\nconstantly to fall, rent to rise, the rich to become very much richer,\r\nthe poor to become more helpless and hopeless, and the middle class to\r\nbe swept away.\r\n\r\nI have traced this tendency to its cause. I have shown by what simple\r\nmeans this cause may be removed. I now wish to point out _how_, if this\r\nis not done, progress must turn to decadence, and modern civilization\r\ndecline to barbarism, as have all previous civilizations. It is worth\r\nwhile to point out _how_ this may occur, as many people, being unable\r\nto see how progress may pass into retrogression, conceive such a thing\r\nimpossible. Gibbon, for instance, thought that modern civilization\r\ncould never be destroyed because there remained no barbarians to\r\noverrun it, and it is a common idea that the invention of printing by\r\nso multiplying books has prevented the possibility of knowledge ever\r\nagain being lost.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of social progress, as we have traced the law, are\r\nassociation and equality. The general tendency of modern development,\r\nsince the time when we can first discern the gleams of civilization in\r\nthe darkness which followed the fall of the Western Empire, has been\r\ntoward political and legal equality—to the abolition of slavery; to the\r\nabrogation of status; to the sweeping away of hereditary privileges;\r\nto the substitution of parliamentary for arbitrary government; to the\r\nright of private judgment in matters of religion; to the more equal\r\nsecurity in person and property of high and low, weak and strong; to\r\nthe greater freedom of movement and occupation, of speech and of the\r\npress. The history of modern civilization is the history of advances in\r\nthis direction—of the struggles and triumphs of personal, political,\r\nand religious freedom. And the general law is shown by the fact that\r\njust as this tendency has asserted itself civilization has advanced,\r\nwhile just as it has been repressed or forced back civilization has\r\nbeen checked.\r\n\r\nThis tendency has reached its full expression in the American Republic,\r\nwhere political and legal rights are absolutely equal, and, owing to\r\nthe system of rotation in office, even the growth of a bureaucracy\r\nis prevented; where every religious belief or non-belief stands on\r\nthe same footing; where every boy may hope to be President, every\r\nman has an equal voice in public affairs, and every official is\r\nmediately or immediately dependent for the short lease of his place\r\nupon a popular vote. This tendency has yet some triumphs to win in\r\nEngland, in extending the suffrage, and sweeping away the vestiges\r\nof monarchy, aristocracy, and prelacy; while in such countries as\r\nGermany and Russia, where divine right is yet a good deal more than\r\na legal fiction, it has a considerable distance to go. But it is the\r\nprevailing tendency, and how soon Europe will be completely republican\r\nis only a matter of time, or rather of accident. The United States are\r\ntherefore, in this respect, the most advanced of all the great nations,\r\nin a direction in which all are advancing, and in the United States we\r\nsee just how much this tendency to personal and political freedom can\r\nof itself accomplish.\r\n\r\nNow, the first effect of the tendency to political equality was to the\r\nmore equal distribution of wealth and power; for, while population\r\nis comparatively sparse, inequality in the distribution of wealth is\r\nprincipally due to the inequality of personal rights, and it is only\r\nas material progress goes on that the tendency to inequality involved\r\nin the reduction of land to private ownership strongly appears. But it\r\nis now manifest that absolute political equality does not in itself\r\nprevent the tendency to inequality involved in the private ownership of\r\nland, and it is further evident that political equality, co-existing\r\nwith an increasing tendency to the unequal distribution of wealth, must\r\nultimately beget either the despotism of organized tyranny or the worse\r\ndespotism of anarchy.\r\n\r\nTo turn a republican government into a despotism the basest and most\r\nbrutal, it is not necessary formally to change its constitution or\r\nabandon popular elections. It was centuries after Cæsar before the\r\nabsolute master of the Roman world pretended to rule other than by\r\nauthority of a Senate that trembled before him.\r\n\r\nBut forms are nothing when substance has gone, and the forms of popular\r\ngovernment are those from which the substance of freedom may most\r\neasily go. Extremes meet, and a government of universal suffrage and\r\ntheoretical equality may, under conditions which impel the change,\r\nmost readily become a despotism. For there despotism advances in the\r\nname and with the might of the people. The single source of power once\r\nsecured, everything is secured. There is no unfranchised class to\r\nwhom appeal may be made, no privileged orders who in defending their\r\nown rights may defend those of all. No bulwark remains to stay the\r\nflood, no eminence to rise above it. They were belted barons led by a\r\nmitered archbishop who curbed the Plantagenet with Magna Charta; it\r\nwas the middle classes who broke the pride of the Stuarts; but a mere\r\naristocracy of wealth will never struggle while it can hope to bribe a\r\ntyrant.\r\n\r\nAnd when the disparity of condition increases, so does universal\r\nsuffrage make it easy to seize the source of power, for the greater\r\nis the proportion of power in the hands of those who feel no direct\r\ninterest in the conduct of government; who, tortured by want and\r\nembruted by poverty, are ready to sell their votes to the highest\r\nbidder or follow the lead of the most blatant demagogue; or who, made\r\nbitter by hardships, may even look upon profligate and tyrannous\r\ngovernment with the satisfaction we may imagine the proletarians\r\nand slaves of Rome to have felt, as they saw a Caligula or Nero\r\nraging among the rich patricians. Given a community with republican\r\ninstitutions, in which one class is too rich to be shorn of its\r\nluxuries, no matter how public affairs are administered, and another\r\nso poor that a few dollars on election day will seem more than any\r\nabstract consideration; in which the few roll in wealth and the many\r\nseethe with discontent at a condition of things they know not how to\r\nremedy, and power must pass into the hands of jobbers who will buy and\r\nsell it as the Prætorians sold the Roman purple, or into the hands of\r\ndemagogues who will seize and wield it for a time, only to be displaced\r\nby worse demagogues.\r\n\r\nWhere there is anything like an equal distribution of wealth—that is to\r\nsay, where there is general patriotism, virtue, and intelligence—the\r\nmore democratic the government the better it will be; but where there\r\nis gross inequality in the distribution of wealth, the more democratic\r\nthe government the worse it will be; for, while rotten democracy\r\nmay not in itself be worse than rotten autocracy, its effects upon\r\nnational character will be worse. To give the suffrage to tramps, to\r\npaupers, to men to whom the chance to labor is a boon, to men who must\r\nbeg, or steal, or starve, is to invoke destruction. To put political\r\npower in the hands of men embittered and degraded by poverty is to tie\r\nfirebrands to foxes and turn them loose amid the standing corn; it\r\nis to put out the eyes of a Samson and to twine his arms around the\r\npillars of national life.\r\n\r\nEven the accidents of hereditary succession or of selection by lot, the\r\nplan of some of the ancient republics, may sometimes place the wise\r\nand just in power; but in a corrupt democracy the tendency is always\r\nto give power to the worst. Honesty and patriotism are weighted, and\r\nunscrupulousness commands success. The best gravitate to the bottom,\r\nthe worst float to the top, and the vile will only be ousted by the\r\nviler. While as national character must gradually assimilate to the\r\nqualities that win power, and consequently respect, that demoralization\r\nof opinion goes on which in the long panorama of history we may see\r\nover and over again transmuting races of freemen into races of slaves.\r\n\r\nAs in England in the last century, when Parliament was but a close\r\ncorporation of the aristocracy, a corrupt oligarchy clearly fenced off\r\nfrom the masses may exist without much effect on national character,\r\nbecause in that case power is associated in the popular mind with other\r\nthings than corruption. But where there are no hereditary distinctions,\r\nand men are habitually seen to raise themselves by corrupt qualities\r\nfrom the lowest places to wealth and power, tolerance of these\r\nqualities finally becomes admiration. A corrupt democratic government\r\nmust finally corrupt the people, and when a people become corrupt there\r\nis no resurrection. The life is gone, only the carcass remains; and it\r\nis left but for the plowshares of fate to bury it out of sight.\r\n\r\nNow this transformation of popular government into despotism of the\r\nvilest and most degrading kind, which must inevitably result from the\r\nunequal distribution of wealth, is not a thing of the far future. It\r\nhas already begun in the United States, and is rapidly going on under\r\nour eyes. That our legislative bodies are steadily deteriorating in\r\nstandard; that men of the highest ability and character are compelled\r\nto eschew politics, and the arts of the jobber count for more than\r\nthe reputation of the statesman; that voting is done more recklessly\r\nand the power of money is increasing; that it is harder to arouse\r\nthe people to the necessity of reforms and more difficult to carry\r\nthem out; that political differences are ceasing to be differences of\r\nprinciple, and abstract ideas are losing their power; that parties\r\nare passing into the control of what in general government would be\r\noligarchies and dictatorships; are all evidences of political decline.\r\n\r\nThe type of modern growth is the great city. Here are to be found the\r\ngreatest wealth and the deepest poverty. And it is here that popular\r\ngovernment has most clearly broken down. In all the great American\r\ncities there is to-day as clearly defined a ruling class as in the most\r\naristocratic countries of the world. Its members carry wards in their\r\npockets, make up the slates for nominating conventions, distribute\r\noffices as they bargain together, and—though they toil not, neither do\r\nthey spin—wear the best of raiment and spend money lavishly. They are\r\nmen of power, whose favor the ambitious must court and whose vengeance\r\nhe must avoid. Who are these men? The wise, the good, the learned—men\r\nwho have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens by the purity\r\nof their lives, the splendor of their talents, their probity in public\r\ntrusts, their deep study of the problems of government? No; they are\r\ngamblers, saloon keepers, pugilists, or worse, who have made a trade\r\nof controlling votes and of buying and selling offices and official\r\nacts. They stand to the government of these cities as the Prætorian\r\nGuards did to that of declining Rome. He who would wear the purple,\r\nfill the curule chair, or have the fasces carried before him, must go\r\nor send his messengers to their camps, give them donatives and make\r\nthem promises. It is through these men that the rich corporations\r\nand powerful pecuniary interests can pack the Senate and the bench\r\nwith their creatures. It is these men who make School Directors,\r\nSupervisors, Assessors, members of the Legislature, Congressmen. Why,\r\nthere are many election districts in the United States in which a\r\nGeorge Washington, a Benjamin Franklin or a Thomas Jefferson could\r\nno more go to the lower house of a State Legislature than under the\r\nAncient Régime a base-born peasant could become a Marshal of France.\r\nTheir very character would be an insuperable disqualification.\r\n\r\nIn theory we are intense democrats. The proposal to sacrifice swine in\r\nthe temple would hardly have excited greater horror and indignation in\r\nJerusalem of old than would among us that of conferring a distinction\r\nof rank upon our most eminent citizen. But is there not growing up\r\namong us a class who have all the power without any of the virtues of\r\naristocracy? We have simple citizens who control thousands of miles of\r\nrailroad, millions of acres of land, the means of livelihood of great\r\nnumbers of men; who name the Governors of sovereign States as they\r\nname their clerks, choose Senators as they choose attorneys, and whose\r\nwill is as supreme with Legislatures as that of a French King sitting\r\nin bed of justice. The undercurrents of the times seem to sweep us\r\nback again to the old conditions from which we dreamed we had escaped.\r\nThe development of the artisan and commercial classes gradually broke\r\ndown feudalism after it had become so complete that men thought of\r\nheaven as organized on a feudal basis, and ranked the first and\r\nsecond persons of the Trinity as suzerain and tenant-in-chief. But\r\nnow the development of manufactures and exchange, acting in a social\r\norganization in which land is made private property, threatens to\r\ncompel every worker to seek a master, as the insecurity which followed\r\nthe final break-up of the Roman Empire compelled every freeman to seek\r\na lord. Nothing seems exempt from this tendency. Industry everywhere\r\ntends to assume a form in which one is master and many serve. And when\r\none is master and the others serve, the one will control the others,\r\neven in such matters as votes. Just as the English landlord votes his\r\ntenants, so does the New England mill owner vote his operatives.\r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking it—the very foundations of society are being\r\nsapped before our eyes, while we ask, _how_ is it possible that such\r\na civilization as this, with its railroads, and daily newspapers,\r\nand electric telegraphs, should ever be destroyed? While literature\r\nbreathes but the belief that we have been, are, and for the future must\r\nbe, leaving the savage state further and further behind us, there are\r\nindications that we are actually turning back again toward barbarism.\r\nLet me illustrate: One of the characteristics of barbarism is the low\r\nregard for the rights of person and of property. That the laws of our\r\nAnglo-Saxon ancestors imposed as penalty for murder a fine proportioned\r\nto the rank of the victim, while our law knows no distinction of rank,\r\nand protects the lowest from the highest, the poorest from the richest,\r\nby the uniform penalty of death, is looked upon as evidence of their\r\nbarbarism and our civilization. And so, that piracy, and robbery, and\r\nslave-trading, and blackmailing, were once regarded as legitimate\r\noccupations, is conclusive proof of the rude state of development from\r\nwhich we have so far progressed.\r\n\r\nBut it is a matter of fact that, in spite of our laws, any one who has\r\nmoney enough and wants to kill another may go into any one of our great\r\ncenters of population and business, and gratify his desire, and then\r\nsurrender himself to justice, with the chances as a hundred to one that\r\nhe will suffer no greater penalty than a temporary imprisonment and the\r\nloss of a sum proportioned partly to his own wealth and partly to the\r\nwealth and standing of the man he kills. His money will be paid, not to\r\nthe family of the murdered man, who have lost their protector; not to\r\nthe state, which has lost a citizen; but to lawyers who understand how\r\nto secure delays, to find witnesses, and get juries to disagree.\r\n\r\nAnd so, if a man steal enough, he may be sure that his punishment will\r\npractically amount but to the loss of a part of the proceeds of his\r\ntheft; and if he steal enough to get off with a fortune, he will be\r\ngreeted by his acquaintances as a viking might have been greeted after\r\na successful cruise. Even though he robbed those who trusted him; even\r\nthough he robbed the widow and the fatherless; he has only to get\r\nenough, and he may safely flaunt his wealth in the eyes of day.\r\n\r\nNow, the tendency in this direction is an increasing one. It is shown\r\nin greatest force where the inequalities in the distribution of wealth\r\nare greatest, and it shows itself as they increase. If it be not a\r\nreturn to barbarism, what is it? The failures of justice to which I\r\nhave alluded are only illustrative of the increasing debility of our\r\nlegal machinery in every department. It is becoming common to hear\r\nmen say that it would be better to revert to first principles and\r\nabolish law, for then in self-defense the people would form Vigilance\r\nCommittees and take justice into their own hands. Is this indicative of\r\nadvance or retrogression?\r\n\r\nAll this is matter of common observation. Though we may not speak it\r\nopenly, the general faith in republican institutions is, where they\r\nhave reached their fullest development, narrowing and weakening. It\r\nis no longer that confident belief in republicanism as the source of\r\nnational blessings that it once was. Thoughtful men are beginning to\r\nsee its dangers, without seeing how to escape them; are beginning to\r\naccept the view of Macaulay and distrust that of Jefferson.[64] And the\r\npeople at large are becoming used to the growing corruption. The most\r\nominous political sign in the United States to-day is the growth of a\r\nsentiment which either doubts the existence of an honest man in public\r\noffice or looks on him as a fool for not seizing his opportunities.\r\nThat is to say, the people themselves are becoming corrupted. Thus in\r\nthe United States to-day is republican government running the course\r\nit must inevitably follow under conditions which cause the unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nWhere that course leads is clear to whoever will think. As corruption\r\nbecomes chronic; as public spirit is lost; as traditions of honor,\r\nvirtue, and patriotism are weakened; as law is brought into contempt\r\nand reforms become hopeless; then in the festering mass will be\r\ngenerated volcanic forces, which shatter and rend when seeming accident\r\ngives them vent. Strong, unscrupulous men, rising up upon occasion,\r\nwill become the exponents of blind popular desires or fierce popular\r\npassions, and dash aside forms that have lost their vitality. The sword\r\nwill again be mightier than the pen, and in carnivals of destruction\r\nbrute force and wild frenzy will alternate with the lethargy of a\r\ndeclining civilization.\r\n\r\nI speak of the United States only because the United States is the most\r\nadvanced of all the great nations. What shall we say of Europe, where\r\ndams of ancient law and custom pen up the swelling waters and standing\r\narmies weigh down the safety valves, though year by year the fires\r\ngrow hotter underneath? Europe tends to republicanism under conditions\r\nthat will not admit of true republicanism—under conditions that\r\nsubstitute for the calm and august figure of Liberty the petroleuse and\r\nthe guillotine!\r\n\r\nWhence shall come the new barbarians? Go through the squalid quarters\r\nof great cities, and you may see, even now, their gathering hordes! How\r\nshall learning perish? Men will cease to read, and books will kindle\r\nfires and be turned into cartridges!\r\n\r\nIt is startling to think how slight the traces that would be left of\r\nour civilization did it pass through the throes which have accompanied\r\nthe decline of every previous civilization. Paper will not last like\r\nparchment, nor are our most massive buildings and monuments to be\r\ncompared in solidity with the rock-hewn temples and titanic edifices of\r\nthe old civilizations.[65] And invention has given us, not merely the\r\nsteam engine and the printing press, but petroleum, nitro-glycerine,\r\nand dynamite.\r\n\r\nYet to hint, to-day, that our civilization may possibly be tending to\r\ndecline, seems like the wildness of pessimism. The special tendencies\r\nto which I have alluded are obvious to thinking men, but with the\r\nmajority of thinking men, as with the great masses, the belief in\r\nsubstantial progress is yet deep and strong—a fundamental belief which\r\nadmits not the shadow of a doubt.\r\n\r\nBut any one who will think over the matter will see that this\r\nmust necessarily be the case where advance gradually passes into\r\nretrogression. For in social development, as in everything else, motion\r\ntends to persist in straight lines, and therefore, where there has been\r\na previous advance, it is extremely difficult to recognize decline,\r\neven when it has fully commenced; there is an almost irresistible\r\ntendency to believe that the forward movement which has been advance,\r\nand is still going on, is still advance. The web of beliefs, customs,\r\nlaws, institutions, and habits of thought, which each community is\r\nconstantly spinning, and which produces in the individual environed\r\nby it all the differences of national character, is never unraveled.\r\nThat is to say, in the decline of civilization, communities do not go\r\ndown by the same paths that they came up. For instance, the decline of\r\ncivilization as manifested in government would not take us back from\r\nrepublicanism to constitutional monarchy, and thence to the feudal\r\nsystem; it would take us to imperatorship and anarchy. As manifested in\r\nreligion, it would not take us back into the faiths of our forefathers,\r\ninto Protestantism or Catholicity, but into new forms of superstition,\r\nof which possibly Mormonism and other even grosser “isms” may give some\r\nvague idea. As manifested in knowledge, it would not take us toward\r\nBacon, but toward the literati of China.\r\n\r\nAnd how the retrogression of civilization, following a period of\r\nadvance, may be so gradual as to attract no attention at the time;\r\nnay, how that decline must necessarily, by the great majority of men,\r\nbe mistaken for advance, is easily seen. For instance, there is an\r\nenormous difference between Grecian art of the classic period and that\r\nof the lower empire; yet the change was accompanied, or rather caused,\r\nby a change of taste. The artists who most quickly followed this change\r\nof taste were in their day regarded as the superior artists. And so of\r\nliterature. As it became more vapid, puerile, and stilted, it would be\r\nin obedience to an altered taste, which would regard its increasing\r\nweakness as increasing strength and beauty. The really good writer\r\nwould not find readers; he would be regarded as rude, dry, or dull.\r\nAnd so would the drama decline; not because there was a lack of good\r\nplays, but because the prevailing taste became more and more that of a\r\nless cultured class, who, of course, regard that which they most admire\r\nas the best of its kind. And so, too, of religion; the superstitions\r\nwhich a superstitious people will add to it will be regarded by them as\r\nimprovements. While, as the decline goes on, the return to barbarism,\r\nwhere it is not in itself regarded as an advance, will seem necessary\r\nto meet the exigencies of the times.\r\n\r\nFor instance, flogging, as a punishment for certain offenses, has\r\nbeen recently restored to the penal code of England, and has been\r\nstrongly advocated on this side of the Atlantic. I express no opinion\r\nas to whether this is or is not a better punishment for crime than\r\nimprisonment. I only point to the fact as illustrating how an\r\nincreasing amount of crime and an increasing embarrassment as to the\r\nmaintenance of prisoners, both obvious tendencies at present, might\r\nlead to a fuller return to the physical cruelty of barbarous codes.\r\nThe use of torture in judicial investigations, which steadily grew\r\nwith the decline of Roman civilization, it is thus easy to see, might,\r\nas manners brutalized and crime increased, be demanded as a necessary\r\nimprovement of the criminal law.\r\n\r\nWhether in the present drifts of opinion and taste there are as yet\r\nany indications of retrogression, it is not necessary to inquire; but\r\nthere are many things about which there can be no dispute, which go\r\nto show that our civilization has reached a critical period, and that\r\nunless a new start is made in the direction of social equality, the\r\nnineteenth century may to the future mark its climax. These industrial\r\ndepressions, which cause as much waste and suffering as famines\r\nor wars, are like the twinges and shocks which precede paralysis.\r\nEverywhere is it evident that the tendency to inequality, which is\r\nthe necessary result of material progress where land is monopolized,\r\ncannot go much further without carrying our civilization into that\r\ndownward path which is so easy to enter and so hard to abandon.\r\nEverywhere the increasing intensity of the struggle to live, the\r\nincreasing necessity for straining every nerve to prevent being thrown\r\ndown and trodden under foot in the scramble for wealth, is draining\r\nthe forces which gain and maintain improvements. In every civilized\r\ncountry pauperism, crime, insanity, and suicides are increasing. In\r\nevery civilized country the diseases are increasing which come from\r\noverstrained nerves, from insufficient nourishment, from squalid\r\nlodgings, from unwholesome and monotonous occupations, from premature\r\nlabor of children, from the tasks and crimes which poverty imposes\r\nupon women. In every highly civilized country the expectation of life,\r\nwhich gradually rose for several centuries, and which seems to have\r\nculminated about the first quarter of this century, appears to be now\r\ndiminishing.[66]\r\n\r\nIt is not an advancing civilization that such figures show. It is a\r\ncivilization which in its undercurrents has already begun to recede.\r\nWhen the tide turns in bay or river from flood to ebb, it is not all at\r\nonce; but here it still runs on, though there it has begun to recede.\r\nWhen the sun passes the meridian, it can be told only by the way the\r\nshort shadows fall; for the heat of the day yet increases. But as sure\r\nas the turning tide must soon run full ebb; as sure as the declining\r\nsun must bring darkness, so sure is it, that though knowledge yet\r\nincreases and invention marches on, and new states are being settled,\r\nand cities still expand, yet civilization has begun to wane when, in\r\nproportion to population, we must build more and more prisons, more and\r\nmore almshouses, more and more insane asylums. It is not from top to\r\nbottom that societies die; it is from bottom to top.\r\n\r\nBut there are evidences far more palpable than any that can be given\r\nby statistics, of tendencies to the ebb of civilization. There is a\r\nvague but general feeling of disappointment; an increased bitterness\r\namong the working classes; a widespread feeling of unrest and brooding\r\nrevolution. If this were accompanied by a definite idea of how relief\r\nis to be obtained, it would be a hopeful sign; but it is not. Though\r\nthe schoolmaster has been abroad some time, the general power of\r\ntracing effect to cause does not seem a whit improved. The reaction\r\ntoward protectionism, as the reaction toward other exploded fallacies\r\nof government, shows this.[67] And even the philosophic free-thinker\r\ncannot look upon that vast change in religious ideas that is now\r\nsweeping over the civilized world without feeling that this tremendous\r\nfact may have most momentous relations, which only the future can\r\ndevelop. For what is going on is not a change in the form of religion,\r\nbut the negation and destruction of the ideas from which religion\r\nsprings. Christianity is not simply clearing itself of superstitions,\r\nbut in the popular mind it is dying at the root, as the old paganisms\r\nwere dying when Christianity entered the world. And nothing arises to\r\ntake its place. The fundamental ideas of an intelligent Creator and of\r\na future life are in the general mind rapidly weakening. Now, whether\r\nthis may or may not be in itself an advance, the importance of the part\r\nwhich religion has played in the world’s history shows the importance\r\nof the change that is now going on. Unless human nature has suddenly\r\naltered in what the universal history of the race shows to be its\r\ndeepest characteristics, the mightiest actions and reactions are thus\r\npreparing. Such stages of thought have heretofore always marked periods\r\nof transition. On a smaller scale and to a less depth (for I think any\r\none who will notice the drift of our literature, and talk upon such\r\nsubjects with the men he meets, will see that it is sub-soil and not\r\nsurface plowing that materialistic ideas are now doing), such a state\r\nof thought preceded the French revolution. But the closest parallel to\r\nthe wreck of religious ideas now going on is to be found in that period\r\nin which ancient civilization began to pass from splendor to decline.\r\nWhat change may come, no mortal man can tell, but that some great\r\nchange _must_ come, thoughtful men begin to feel. The civilized world\r\nis trembling on the verge of a great movement. Either it must be a leap\r\nupward, which will open the way to advances yet undreamed of, or it\r\nmust be a plunge downward, which will carry us back toward barbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] See Macaulay’s letter to Randall, the biographer of Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[65] It is also, it seems to me, instructive to note how inadequate and\r\nutterly misleading would be the idea of our civilization which could be\r\ngained from the religious and funereal monuments of our time, which are\r\nall we have from which to gain our ideas of the buried civilizations.\r\n\r\n[66] Statistics which show these things are collected in convenient\r\nform in a volume entitled “Deterioration and Race Education,” by Samuel\r\nRoyce, which has been largely distributed by the venerable Peter Cooper\r\nof New York. Strangely enough, the only remedy proposed by Mr. Royce is\r\nthe establishment of Kindergarten schools.\r\n\r\n[67] In point of constructive statesmanship—the recognition of\r\nfundamental principles and the adaptation of means to ends, the\r\nConstitution of the United States, adopted a century ago, is greatly\r\nsuperior to the latest State Constitutions, the most recent of which is\r\nthat of California—a piece of utter botchwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL TRUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short space to which this latter part of our inquiry is\r\nnecessarily confined, I have been obliged to omit much that I would\r\nlike to say, and to touch briefly where an exhaustive consideration\r\nwould not be out of place.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this, at least, is evident, that the truth to which we\r\nwere led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry is as clearly\r\napparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay of\r\ncivilizations, and that it accords with those deep-seated recognitions\r\nof relation and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus\r\nhave been given to our conclusions the greatest certitude and highest\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nThis truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the\r\nevils arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which\r\nare becoming more and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are\r\nnot incidents of progress, but tendencies which must bring progress to\r\na halt; that they will not cure themselves, but, on the contrary, must,\r\nunless their cause is removed, grow greater and greater, until they\r\nsweep us back into barbarism by the road every previous civilization\r\nhas trod. But it also shows that these evils are not imposed by natural\r\nlaws; that they spring solely from social mal-adjustments which ignore\r\nnatural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving an\r\nenormous impetus to progress.\r\n\r\nThe poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and imbrutes men,\r\nand all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of\r\njustice. In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which\r\nnature freely offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of\r\njustice—for, so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large\r\nscale, justice seems to be the supreme law of the universe. But by\r\nsweeping away this injustice and asserting the rights of all men to\r\nnatural opportunities, we shall conform ourselves to the law—we shall\r\nremove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution of\r\nwealth and power; we shall abolish poverty; tame the ruthless passions\r\nof greed; dry up the springs of vice and misery; light in dark places\r\nthe lamp of knowledge; give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse\r\nto discovery; substitute political strength for political weakness; and\r\nmake tyranny and anarchy impossible.\r\n\r\nThe reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically,\r\nsocially, or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform,\r\nfor it will make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying\r\nout in letter and spirit of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence—the “self-evident” truth that is the heart and soul of the\r\nDeclaration—“_That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by\r\ntheir Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!_”\r\n\r\nThese rights are denied when the equal right to land—on which and\r\nby which men alone can live—is denied. Equality of political rights\r\nwill not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty\r\nof nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied,\r\nbecomes, as population increases and invention goes on, merely the\r\nliberty to compete for employment at starvation wages. This is the\r\ntruth that we have ignored. And so there come beggars in our streets\r\nand tramps on our roads; and poverty enslaves men whom we boast are\r\npolitical sovereigns; and want breeds ignorance that our schools\r\ncannot enlighten; and citizens vote as their masters dictate; and the\r\ndemagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and gold weighs in the\r\nscales of justice; and in high places sit those who do not pay to\r\ncivic virtue even the compliment of hypocrisy; and the pillars of the\r\nrepublic that we thought so strong already bend under an increasing\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nWe honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound\r\nher praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so\r\ngrow her demands. She will have no half service!\r\n\r\nLiberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty\r\nboastings. For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural\r\nlaw—the law of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nThey who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when\r\nshe has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who\r\nthink of her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of\r\nlife, have not seen her real grandeur—to them the poets who have sung\r\nof her must seem rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is\r\nthe lord of life, as well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce\r\nthe clouds, but support all growth, supply all motion, and call forth\r\nfrom what would otherwise be a cold and inert mass all the infinite\r\ndiversities of being and beauty, so is liberty to mankind. It is not\r\nfor an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every age the\r\nwitnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nWe speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge,\r\ninvention, national strength and national independence as other things.\r\nBut, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary\r\ncondition. She is to virtue what light is to color; to wealth what\r\nsunshine is to grain; to knowledge what eyes are to sight. She is the\r\ngenius of invention, the brawn of national strength, the spirit of\r\nnational independence. Where Liberty rises, there virtue grows, wealth\r\nincreases, knowledge expands, invention multiplies human powers, and in\r\nstrength and spirit the freer nation rises among her neighbors as Saul\r\namid his brethren—taller and fairer. Where Liberty sinks, there virtue\r\nfades, wealth diminishes, knowledge is forgotten, invention ceases, and\r\nempires once mighty in arms and arts become a helpless prey to freer\r\nbarbarians!\r\n\r\nOnly in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet\r\nbeamed among men, but all progress hath she called forth.\r\n\r\nLiberty came to a race of slaves crouching under Egyptian whips, and\r\nled them forth from the House of Bondage. She hardened them in the\r\ndesert and made of them a race of conquerors. The free spirit of the\r\nMosaic law took their thinkers up to heights where they beheld the\r\nunity of God, and inspired their poets with strains that yet phrase the\r\nhighest exaltations of thought. Liberty dawned on the Phœnician coast,\r\nand ships passed the Pillars of Hercules to plow the unknown sea. She\r\nshed a partial light on Greece, and marble grew to shapes of ideal\r\nbeauty, words became the instruments of subtlest thought, and against\r\nthe scanty militia of free cities the countless hosts of the Great King\r\nbroke like surges against a rock. She cast her beams on the four-acre\r\nfarms of Italian husbandmen, and born of her strength a power came\r\nforth that conquered the world. They glinted from shields of German\r\nwarriors, and Augustus wept his legions. Out of the night that followed\r\nher eclipse, her slanting rays fell again on free cities, and a lost\r\nlearning revived, modern civilization began, a new world was unveiled;\r\nand as Liberty grew, so grew art, wealth, power, knowledge, and\r\nrefinement. In the history of every nation we may read the same truth.\r\nIt was the strength born of Magna Charta that won Crecy and Agincourt.\r\nIt was the revival of Liberty from the despotism of the Tudors that\r\nglorified the Elizabethan age. It was the spirit that brought a crowned\r\ntyrant to the block that planted here the seed of a mighty tree. It was\r\nthe energy of ancient freedom that, the moment it had gained unity,\r\nmade Spain the mightiest power of the world, only to fall to the lowest\r\ndepth of weakness when tyranny succeeded liberty. See, in France, all\r\nintellectual vigor dying under the tyranny of the Seventeenth Century\r\nto revive in splendor as Liberty awoke in the Eighteenth, and on the\r\nenfranchisement of French peasants in the Great Revolution, basing the\r\nwonderful strength that has in our time defied defeat.\r\n\r\nShall we not trust her?\r\n\r\nIn our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that,\r\nproducing inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin\r\nto lower. Liberty calls to us again. We must follow her further; we\r\nmust trust her fully. Either we must wholly accept her or she will not\r\nstay. It is not enough that men should vote; it is not enough that they\r\nshould be theoretically equal before the law. They must have liberty\r\nto avail themselves of the opportunities and means of life; they must\r\nstand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature. Either\r\nthis, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this, or darkness comes\r\non, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that\r\nwork destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of\r\nthe centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social\r\nstructure cannot stand.\r\n\r\nOur primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one\r\nman to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we\r\nhave made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material\r\nprogress goes on. This is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do\r\nnot realize is extracting from the masses in every civilized country\r\nthe fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more\r\nhopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed; that is\r\nbringing political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon\r\ntransmute democratic institutions into anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse.\r\nIt is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid\r\ntenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with\r\nwant and consumes them with greed; that robs women of the grace and\r\nbeauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little children the joy\r\nand innocence of life’s morning.\r\n\r\nCivilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe\r\nforbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that is in\r\nevery soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something grander than\r\nBenevolence, something more august than Charity—it is Justice herself\r\nthat demands of us to right this wrong. Justice that will not be\r\ndenied; that cannot be put off—Justice that with the scales carries\r\nthe sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies and prayers? Shall\r\nwe avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches when hungry\r\ninfants moan and weary mothers weep?\r\n\r\nThough it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that\r\nattributes to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and\r\nbrutishness that come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the\r\nAll-Father and lays on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of\r\nour great cities. We degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One.\r\nA merciful man would have better ordered the world; a just man would\r\ncrush with his foot such an ulcerous anthill! It is not the Almighty,\r\nbut we who are responsible for the vice and misery that fester amid our\r\ncivilization. The Creator showers upon us his gifts—more than enough\r\nfor all. But like swine scrambling for food, we tread them in the\r\nmire—tread them in the mire, while we tear and rend each other!\r\n\r\nIn the very centers of our civilization to-day are want and suffering\r\nenough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel\r\nhis nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?\r\nSupposing the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the\r\nuniverse sprang into being there should glow in the sun a greater\r\npower; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor the soil; that for every\r\nblade of grass that now grows two should spring up, and the seed that\r\nnow increases fifty-fold should increase a hundred-fold! Would poverty\r\nbe abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit would\r\naccrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the\r\nmaterial universe could be utilized only through land. And land, being\r\nprivate property, the classes that now monopolize the bounty of the\r\nCreator would monopolize all the new bounty. Land owners would alone\r\nbe benefited. Rents would increase, but wages would still tend to the\r\nstarvation point!\r\n\r\nThis is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact\r\nof experience. We know it because we have seen it. Within our own\r\ntimes, under our very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all,\r\nand through all; that Power of which the whole universe is but the\r\nmanifestation; that Power which maketh all things, and without which is\r\nnot anything made that is made, has increased the bounty which men may\r\nenjoy, as truly as though the fertility of nature had been increased.\r\nInto the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the\r\nservice of mankind. To the inner ear of another was whispered the\r\nsecret that compels the lightning to bear a message round the globe.\r\nIn every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; in every\r\ndepartment of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers of steel,\r\nwhose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely the same\r\nas an increase in the fertility of nature. What has been the result?\r\nSimply that land owners get all the gain. The wonderful discoveries and\r\ninventions of our century have neither increased wages nor lightened\r\ntoil. The effect has simply been to make the few richer; the many more\r\nhelpless!\r\n\r\nCan it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated\r\nwith impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its\r\nearnings while greed rolls in wealth—that the many should want while\r\nthe few are surfeited? Turn to history, and on every page may be read\r\nthe lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that\r\nfollows injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around to-day. Can\r\nthis state of things continue? May we even say, “After us the deluge!”\r\nNay; the pillars of the state are trembling even now, and the very\r\nfoundations of society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that glow\r\nunderneath. The struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in\r\nruin, is near at hand, if it be not already begun.\r\n\r\nThe fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers\r\nborn of progress, forces have entered the world that will either\r\ncompel us to a higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation,\r\nas civilization after civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It\r\nis the delusion which precedes destruction that sees in the popular\r\nunrest with which the civilized world is feverishly pulsing only the\r\npassing effect of ephemeral causes. Between democratic ideas and\r\nthe aristocratic adjustments of society there is an irreconcilable\r\nconflict. Here in the United States, as there in Europe, it may be seen\r\narising. We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to\r\ntramp. We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools\r\nand then refusing them the right to earn an honest living. We cannot\r\ngo on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying the\r\ninalienable right to the bounty of the Creator. Even now, in old\r\nbottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces gather for\r\nthe strife!\r\n\r\nBut if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her,\r\nif we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten\r\nmust disappear, the forces that now menace will turn to agencies of\r\nelevation. Think of the powers now wasted; of the infinite fields\r\nof knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities of which the\r\nwondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint. With want\r\ndestroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the fraternity\r\nthat is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy and fear\r\nthat now array men against each other; with mental power loosed by\r\nconditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure; and who shall\r\nmeasure the heights to which our civilization may soar? Words fail the\r\nthought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung and high-raised\r\nseers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which has\r\nalways haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor. It is what he saw\r\nwhose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is the culmination of\r\nChristianity—the City of God on earth, with its walls of jasper and its\r\ngates of pearl! It is the reign of the Prince of Peace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The days of the nations bear no trace\r\n      Of all the sunshine so far foretold;\r\n    The cannon speaks in the teacher’s place—\r\n      The age is weary with work and gold,\r\n    And high hopes wither, and memories wane;\r\n      On hearths and altars the fires are dead;\r\n    But that brave faith hath not lived in vain—\r\n      And this is all that our watcher said.\r\n\r\n    —_Frances Brown._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy task is done.\r\n\r\nYet the thought still mounts. The problems we have been considering\r\nlead into a problem higher and deeper still. Behind the problems of\r\nsocial life lies the problem of individual life. I have found it\r\nimpossible to think of the one without thinking of the other, and so,\r\nI imagine, will it be with those who, reading this book, go with me\r\nin thought. For, as says Guizot, “when the history of civilization\r\nis completed, when there is nothing more to say as to our present\r\nexistence, man inevitably asks himself whether all is exhausted,\r\nwhether he has reached the end of all things?”\r\n\r\nThis problem I cannot now discuss. I speak of it only because the\r\nthought which, while writing this book, has come with inexpressible\r\ncheer to me, may also be of cheer to some who read it; for, whatever\r\nbe its fate, it will be read by some who in their heart of hearts\r\nhave taken the cross of a new crusade. This thought will come to them\r\nwithout my suggestion; but we are surer that we see a star when we know\r\nthat others also see it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe truth that I have tried to make clear will not find easy\r\nacceptance. If that could be, it would have been accepted long ago.\r\nIf that could be, it would never have been obscured. But it will find\r\nfriends—those who will toil for it; suffer for it; if need be, die for\r\nit. This is the power of Truth.\r\n\r\nWill it at length prevail? Ultimately, yes. But in our own times, or\r\nin times of which any memory of us remains, who shall say?\r\n\r\nFor the man who, seeing the want and misery, the ignorance and\r\nbrutishness caused by unjust social institutions, sets himself, in so\r\nfar as he has strength, to right them, there is disappointment and\r\nbitterness. So it has been of old time. So is it even now. But the\r\nbitterest thought—and it sometimes comes to the best and bravest—is\r\nthat of the hopelessness of the effort, the futility of the sacrifice.\r\nTo how few of those who sow the seed is it given to see it grow, or\r\neven with certainty to know that it will grow.\r\n\r\nLet us not disguise it. Over and over again has the standard of Truth\r\nand Justice been raised in this world. Over and over again has it been\r\ntrampled down—oftentimes in blood. If they are weak forces that are\r\nopposed to Truth, how should Error so long prevail? If Justice has but\r\nto raise her head to have Injustice flee before her, how should the\r\nwail of the oppressed so long go up?\r\n\r\nBut for those who see Truth and would follow her; for those who\r\nrecognize Justice and would stand for her, success is not the only\r\nthing. Success! Why, Falsehood has often that to give; and Injustice\r\noften has that to give. Must not Truth and Justice have something to\r\ngive that is their own by proper right—theirs in essence, and not by\r\naccident?\r\n\r\nThat they have, and that here and now, every one who has felt their\r\nexaltation knows. But sometimes the clouds sweep down. It is sad, sad\r\nreading, the lives of the men who would have done something for their\r\nfellows. To Socrates they gave the hemlock; Gracchus they killed with\r\nsticks and stones; and One, greatest and purest of all, they crucified.\r\nThese seem but types. To-day Russian prisons are full, and in long\r\nprocessions, men and women, who, but for high-minded patriotism, might\r\nhave lived in ease and luxury, move in chains toward the death-in-life\r\nof Siberia. And in penury and want, in neglect and contempt, destitute\r\neven of the sympathy that would have been so sweet, how many in every\r\ncountry have closed their eyes? This we see.\r\n\r\n_But do we see it all?_\r\n\r\nIn writing I have picked up a newspaper. In it is a short account,\r\nevidently translated from a semi-official report, of the execution of\r\nthree Nihilists at Kieff—the Prussian subject Brandtner, the unknown\r\nman calling himself Antonoff, and the nobleman Ossinsky. At the foot of\r\nthe gallows they were permitted to kiss one another. “Then the hangman\r\ncut the rope, the surgeons pronounced the victims dead, the bodies were\r\nburied at the foot of the scaffold, and the Nihilists were given up to\r\neternal oblivion.” Thus says the account. I do not believe it. No; not\r\nto oblivion!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have in this inquiry followed the course of my own thought. When, in\r\nmind, I set out on it I had no theory to support, no conclusions to\r\nprove. Only, when I first realized the squalid misery of a great city,\r\nit appalled and tormented me, and would not let me rest, for thinking\r\nof what caused it and how it could be cured.\r\n\r\nBut out of this inquiry has come to me something I did not think to\r\nfind, and a faith that was dead revives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe yearning for a further life is natural and deep. It grows with\r\nintellectual growth, and perhaps none really feel it more than those\r\nwho have begun to see how great is the universe and how infinite are\r\nthe vistas which every advance in knowledge opens before us—vistas\r\nwhich would require nothing short of eternity to explore. But in the\r\nmental atmosphere of our times, to the great majority of men on whom\r\nmere creeds have lost their hold, it seems impossible to look on this\r\nyearning save as a vain and childish hope, arising from man’s egotism,\r\nand for which there is not the slightest ground or warrant, but which,\r\non the contrary, seems inconsistent with positive knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow, when we come to analyze and trace up the ideas that thus destroy\r\nthe hope of a future life, we shall find them, I think, to have their\r\nsource, not in any revelations of physical science, but in certain\r\nteachings of political and social science which have deeply permeated\r\nthought in all directions. They have their root in the doctrines,\r\nthat there is a tendency to the production of more human beings than\r\ncan be provided for; that vice and misery are the result of natural\r\nlaws, and the means by which advance goes on; and that human progress\r\nis by a slow race development. These doctrines, which have been\r\ngenerally accepted as approved truth, do what, except as scientific\r\ninterpretations have been colored by them, the extensions of physical\r\nscience do not do—they reduce the individual to insignificance; they\r\ndestroy the idea that there can be in the ordering of the universe any\r\nregard for his existence, or any recognition of what we call moral\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to reconcile the idea of human immortality with the\r\nidea that nature wastes men by constantly bringing them into being\r\nwhere there is no room for them. It is impossible to reconcile the\r\nidea of an intelligent and beneficent Creator with the belief that\r\nthe wretchedness and degradation which are the lot of such a large\r\nproportion of human kind result from his enactments; while the idea\r\nthat man mentally and physically is the result of slow modifications\r\nperpetuated by heredity, irresistibly suggests the idea that it is\r\nthe race life, not the individual life, which is the object of human\r\nexistence. Thus has vanished with many of us, and is still vanishing\r\nwith more of us, that belief which in the battles and ills of life\r\naffords the strongest support and deepest consolation.\r\n\r\nNow, in the inquiry through which we have passed, we have met these\r\ndoctrines and seen their fallacy. We have seen that population does not\r\ntend to outrun subsistence; we have seen that the waste of human powers\r\nand the prodigality of human suffering do not spring from natural laws,\r\nbut from the ignorance and selfishness of men in refusing to conform\r\nto natural laws. We have seen that human progress is not by altering\r\nthe nature of men; but that, on the contrary, the nature of men seems,\r\ngenerally speaking, always the same.\r\n\r\nThus the nightmare which is banishing from the modern world the\r\nbelief in a future life is destroyed. Not that all difficulties\r\nare removed—for turn which way we may, we come to what we cannot\r\ncomprehend; but that difficulties are removed which seem conclusive and\r\ninsuperable. And, thus, hope springs up.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPolitical Economy has been called the dismal science, and as currently\r\ntaught, _is_ hopeless and despairing. But this, as we have seen,\r\nis solely because she has been degraded and shackled; her truths\r\ndislocated; her harmonies ignored; the word she would utter gagged in\r\nher mouth, and her protest against wrong turned into an indorsement\r\nof injustice. Freed, as I have tried to free her—in her own proper\r\nsymmetry, Political Economy is radiant with hope.\r\n\r\nFor properly understood, the laws which govern the production and\r\ndistribution of wealth show that the want and injustice of the present\r\nsocial state are not necessary; but that, on the contrary, a social\r\nstate is possible in which poverty would be unknown, and all the better\r\nqualities and higher powers of human nature would have opportunity for\r\nfull development.\r\n\r\nAnd, further than this, when we see that social development is governed\r\nneither by a Special Providence nor by a merciless fate, but by law,\r\nat once unchangeable and beneficent; when we see that human will is\r\nthe great factor, and that taking men in the aggregate, their condition\r\nis as they make it; when we see that economic law and moral law are\r\nessentially one, and that the truth which the intellect grasps after\r\ntoilsome effort is but that which the moral sense reaches by a quick\r\nintuition, a flood of light breaks in upon the problem of individual\r\nlife. These countless millions like ourselves, who on this earth of\r\nours have passed and still are passing, with their joys and sorrows,\r\ntheir toil and their striving, their aspirations and their fears, their\r\nstrong perceptions of things deeper than sense, their common feelings\r\nwhich form the basis even of the most divergent creeds—their little\r\nlives do not seem so much like meaningless waste.\r\n\r\nThe great fact which Science in all her branches shows is the\r\nuniversality of law. Wherever he can trace it, whether in the fall\r\nof an apple or in the revolution of binary suns, the astronomer sees\r\nthe working of the same law, which operates in the minutest divisions\r\nin which we may distinguish space, as it does in the immeasurable\r\ndistances with which his science deals. Out of that which lies beyond\r\nhis telescope comes a moving body and again it disappears. So far as\r\nhe can trace its course the law is ignored. Does he say that this is\r\nan exception? On the contrary, he says that this is merely a part of\r\nits orbit that he has seen; that beyond the reach of his telescope the\r\nlaw holds good. He makes his calculations, and after centuries they are\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nNow, if we trace out the laws which govern human life in society,\r\nwe find that in the largest as in the smallest community, they are\r\nthe same. We find that what seem at first sight like divergences and\r\nexceptions are but manifestations of the same principles. And we find\r\nthat everywhere we can trace it, the social law runs into and conforms\r\nwith the moral law; that in the life of a community, justice infallibly\r\nbrings its reward and injustice its punishment. But this we cannot\r\nsee in individual life. If we look merely at individual life we cannot\r\nsee that the laws of the universe have the slightest relation to good\r\nor bad, to right or wrong, to just or unjust.[68] Shall we then say\r\nthat the law which is manifest in social life is not true of individual\r\nlife? It is not scientific to say so. We would not say so in reference\r\nto anything else. Shall we not rather say this simply proves that we do\r\nnot see the whole of individual life?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe laws which Political Economy discovers, like the facts and\r\nrelations of physical nature, harmonize with what seems to be the law\r\nof mental development—not a necessary and involuntary progress, but a\r\nprogress in which the human will is an initiatory force. But in life,\r\nas we are cognizant of it, mental development can go but a little\r\nway. The mind hardly begins to awake ere the bodily powers decline—it\r\nbut becomes dimly conscious of the vast fields before it, but begins\r\nto learn and use its strength, to recognize relations and extend its\r\nsympathies, when, with the death of the body, it passes away. Unless\r\nthere is something more, there seems here a break, a failure. Whether\r\nit be a Humboldt or a Herschel, a Moses who looks from Pisgah, a Joshua\r\nwho leads the host, or one of those sweet and patient souls who in\r\nnarrow circles live radiant lives, there seems, if mind and character\r\nhere developed can go no further, a purposelessness inconsistent with\r\nwhat we can see of the linked sequence of the universe.\r\n\r\nBy a fundamental law of our minds—the law, in fact, upon which\r\nPolitical Economy relies in all her deductions—we cannot conceive\r\nof a means without an end; a contrivance without an object. Now, to\r\nall nature, so far as we come in contact with it in this world, the\r\nsupport and employment of the intelligence that is in man furnishes\r\nsuch an end and object. But unless man himself may rise to or bring\r\nforth something higher, his existence is unintelligible. So strong\r\nis this metaphysical necessity that those who deny to the individual\r\nanything more than this life are compelled to transfer the idea of\r\nperfectibility to the race. But as we have seen, and the argument could\r\nhave been made much more complete, there is nothing whatever to show\r\nany essential race improvement. Human progress is not the improvement\r\nof human nature. The advances in which civilization consists are not\r\nsecured in the constitution of man, but in the constitution of society.\r\nThey are thus not fixed and permanent, but may at any time be lost—nay,\r\nare constantly tending to be lost. And further than this, if human\r\nlife does not continue beyond what we see of it here, then we are\r\nconfronted, with regard to the race, with the same difficulty as with\r\nthe individual! For it is as certain that the race must die as it is\r\nthat the individual must die. We know that there have been geologic\r\nconditions under which human life was impossible on this earth. We know\r\nthat they must return again. Even now, as the earth circles on her\r\nappointed orbit, the northern ice cap slowly thickens, and the time\r\ngradually approaches, when its glaciers will flow again, and austral\r\nseas, sweeping northward, bury the seats of present civilization under\r\nocean wastes, as it may be they now bury what was once as high a\r\ncivilization as our own, And beyond these periods, science discerns\r\na dead earth, an exhausted sun—a time when, clashing together, the\r\nsolar system shall resolve itself into a gaseous form, again to begin\r\nimmeasurable mutations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat then is the meaning of life—of life absolutely and inevitably\r\nbounded by death? To me it seems intelligible only as the avenue and\r\nvestibule to another life. And its facts seem explainable only upon a\r\ntheory which cannot be expressed but in myth and symbol, and which,\r\neverywhere and at all times, the myths and symbols in which men have\r\ntried to portray their deepest perceptions do in some form express.\r\n\r\nThe scriptures of the men who have been and gone—the Bibles, the Zend\r\nAvestas, the Vedas, the Dhammapadas, and the Korans; the esoteric\r\ndoctrines of old philosophies, the inner meaning of grotesque\r\nreligions, the dogmatic constitutions of Ecumenical Councils, the\r\npreachings of Foxes, and Wesleys, and Savonarolas, the traditions of\r\nred Indians, and beliefs of black savages, have a heart and core in\r\nwhich they agree—a something which seems like the variously distorted\r\napprehensions of a primary truth. And out of the chain of thought we\r\nhave been following there seems vaguely to rise a glimpse of what\r\nthey vaguely saw—a shadowy gleam of ultimate relations, the endeavor\r\nto express which inevitably falls into type and allegory. A garden in\r\nwhich are set the trees of good and evil. A vineyard in which there is\r\nthe Master’s work to do. A passage—from life behind to life beyond. A\r\ntrial and a struggle, of which we cannot see the end.\r\n\r\nLook around to-day.\r\n\r\nLo! here, now, in our civilized society, the old allegories yet have a\r\nmeaning, the old myths are still true. Into the Valley of the Shadow of\r\nDeath yet often leads the path of duty, through the streets of Vanity\r\nFair walk Christian and Faithful, and on Greatheart’s armor ring the\r\nclanging blows. Ormuzd still fights with Ahriman—the Prince of Light\r\nwith the Powers of Darkness. He who will hear, to him the clarions of\r\nthe battle call.\r\n\r\nHow they call, and call, and call, till the heart swells that hears\r\nthem! Strong soul and high endeavor, the world needs them now. Beauty\r\nstill lies imprisoned, and iron wheels go over the good and true and\r\nbeautiful that might spring from human lives.\r\n\r\nAnd they who fight with Ormuzd, though they may not know each\r\nother—somewhere, sometime, will the muster roll be called.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough Truth and Right seem often overborne, we may not see it all.\r\nHow can we see it all? All that is passing, even here, we cannot tell.\r\nThe vibrations of matter which give the sensations of light and color\r\nbecome to us indistinguishable when they pass a certain point. It\r\nis only within a like range that we have cognizance of sounds. Even\r\nanimals have senses which we have not. And, here? Compared with the\r\nsolar system our earth is but an indistinguishable speck; and the solar\r\nsystem itself shrivels into nothingness when gauged with the star\r\ndepths. Shall we say that what passes from _our_ sight passes into\r\noblivion? No; not into oblivion. Far, far beyond our ken the eternal\r\nlaws must hold their sway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hope that rises is the heart of all religions! The poets have\r\nsung it, the seers have told it, and in its deepest pulses the heart\r\nof man throbs responsive to its truth. This, that Plutarch said, is\r\nwhat in all times and in all tongues has been said by the pure hearted\r\nand strong sighted, who, standing as it were, on the mountain tops of\r\nthought and looking over the shadowy ocean, have beheld the loom of\r\nland:\r\n\r\n  “_Men’s souls, encompassed here with bodies and passions, have no\r\n communication with God, except what they can reach to in conception\r\n only, by means of philosophy, as by a kind of an obscure dream. But\r\n when they are loosed from the body, and removed into the unseen,\r\n invisible, impassable, and pure region, this God is then their leader\r\n and king; they there, as it were, hanging on him wholly, and beholding\r\n without weariness and passionately affecting that beauty which cannot\r\n be expressed or uttered by men._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] Let us not delude our children. If for no other reason than for\r\nthat which Plato gives, that when they come to discard that which we\r\ntold them as pious fable they will also discard that which we told them\r\nas truth. The virtues which relate to self do generally bring their\r\nreward.
