We may therefore picture to ourselves Augustus reading\r\nLivy's \"History of the Civil Wars\" (in which the historian's republican\r\nsympathies were freely expressed), and learning therefrom that there\r\nwere two sides to the strife which rent Rome. As we are more than\r\nforty-six years distant from our own Civil War, is it not incumbent on\r\nNortherners to endeavor to see the Southern side? We may be certain that\r\nthe historian a hundred years hence, when he contemplates the lining-up\r\nof five and one-half million people against twenty-two millions, their\r\nequal in religion, morals, regard for law, and devotion to the common\r\nConstitution, will, as matter of course, aver that the question over\r\nwhich they fought for four years had two sides; that all the right was\r\nnot on one side and all the wrong on the other. The North should\r\nwelcome, therefore, accounts of the conflict written by candid Southern\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert, reared and educated in the South, believing in the moral\r\nand economical right of slavery, served as a Confederate soldier during\r\nthe war, but after Appomattox, when thirty-one years old, he told his\r\nfather he had arrived at the conviction that slavery was wrong. Twelve\r\nyears later, when home-rule was completely restored to the South (1877),\r\nhe went into public life as a Member of Congress, sitting in the House\r\nfor sixteen years. At the end of his last term, in 1893, he was\r\nappointed Secretary of the Navy by President Cleveland, whom he\r\nfaithfully served during his second administration.\r\n\r\nSuch an experience is an excellent training for the treatment of any\r\naspect of the Civil War. Mr. Herbert's devotion to the Constitution, the\r\nUnion, and the flag now equals that of any soldier of the North who\r\nfought against him. We should expect therefore that his work would be\r\npervaded by practical knowledge and candor.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful reading of the manuscript I have no hesitation in saying\r\nthat the expectation is realized. Naturally unable to agree entirely\r\nwith his presentation of the subject, I believe that his work exhibits a\r\nside that entitles it to a large hearing. I hope that it will be placed\r\nbefore the younger generation, who, unaffected by any memory of the heat\r\nof the conflict, may truly say:\r\n\r\n     Tros Tyriusve, mihi nullo discrimine agetur.\r\n\r\n                                                    JAMES FORD RHODES.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, _November_, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mr. L. E. Chittenden, who had been United States Treasurer under\r\nPresident Lincoln, published an interesting account of $10,000,000\r\nUnited States bonds secretly sent to England, as he said, in 1862, and\r\nhe told all about what thereupon took place across the water. It was a\r\nreminiscence. General Charles Francis Adams in his recent instructive\r\nvolume, \"Studies Military and Diplomatic,\" takes up this narrative and,\r\nin a chapter entitled \"An Historical Residuum,\" conclusively shows from\r\ncontemporaneous evidence that the bonds were sent, not in 1862, but in\r\n1863, but that, as for the rest of the story, the residuum of truth in\r\nit was about like the speck of moisture that is left when a soap bubble\r\nis pricked by a needle.\r\n\r\nGeneral Adams did not mean that Mr. Chittenden knew he was drawing on\r\nhis imagination. He was only demonstrating that one who intends to\r\nwrite history cannot rely on his memory.\r\n\r\nThe author, in the following pages, is undertaking to write a connected\r\nstory of events that happened, most of them, in his lifetime, and as to\r\nmany of the most important of which he has vivid recollections; but,\r\nsave in one respect, he has not relied upon his own memory for any\r\nimportant fact. The picture he has drawn of the relations between the\r\nslave-holder and non-slave-holder in the South is, much of it, given as\r\nhe recollects it. His opportunities for observation were somewhat\r\nextensive, and here he is willing to be considered in part as a witness.\r\nElsewhere he has relied almost entirely upon contemporaneous written\r\nevidence, memory, however, often indicating to him sources of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nNowhere are there so many valuable lessons for the student of American\r\nhistory as in the story of the great sectional movement of 1831, and of\r\nits results, which have profoundly affected American conditions through\r\ngeneration after generation.\r\n\r\nAn effort is here made to tell that story succinctly, tracing it, step\r\nafter step, from cause to effect. The subject divides itself naturally\r\ninto four historic periods:\r\n\r\n1. The anti-slavery crusade, 1831 to 1860.\r\n\r\n2. Secession and four years of war, 1861 to 1865.\r\n\r\n3. Reconstruction under the Lincoln-Johnson plan, with the overthrow by\r\nCongress of that plan and the rule of the negro and carpet-bagger, from\r\n1865 to 1876.\r\n\r\n4. Restoration of self-government in the South, and the results that\r\nhave followed.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the book is devoted to the first period--1831 to\r\n1860, the period of causation. The sequences running through the three\r\nremaining periods are more briefly sketched.\r\n\r\nItalics, throughout the book, it may be mentioned here, are the\r\nauthor's.\r\n\r\nNow that the country is happily reunited in a Union which all agree is\r\nindissoluble, the South wants the true history of the times here treated\r\nof spread before its children; so does the North. The mistakes that were\r\ncommitted on both sides during that lamentable and prolonged sectional\r\nquarrel (and they were many) should be known of all, in order that like\r\nmistakes may not be committed in the future. The writer has, with\r\ndiffidence, attempted to lay the facts before his readers, and so to\r\ncondense the story that it may be within the reach of the ordinary\r\nstudent. How far he has succeeded will be for his readers to say. The\r\nverdict he ventures to hope for is that he has made an honest effort to\r\nbe fair.\r\n\r\nThe author takes this occasion to thank that accomplished young teacher\r\nof history, Mr. Paul Micou, for valuable suggestions, and his friend,\r\nMr. Thomas H. Clark, who with his varied attainments has aided him in\r\nmany ways.\r\n\r\n                                                    HILARY A. HERBERT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

To-day that government has been in\r\nexistence one hundred and twenty-three years, and we proudly claim that\r\nthe experiment of 1789 has been the success of the ages.\r\n\r\nHappy should we be if we could boast that, during all this period, the\r\nConstitution had never been violated in any respect!\r\n\r\nThe first palpable infringement of its provisions occurred in the\r\nenactment of the alien and sedition laws of 1798. The people at the\r\npolls indignantly condemned these enactments, and for years thereafter\r\nthe government proceeded peacefully; the people were prosperous, and the\r\nUnion and the Constitution grew in favor.\r\n\r\nLater, there grew up a rancorous sectional controversy about slavery\r\nthat lasted many years; that quarrel was followed by a bloody sectional\r\nwar; after that war came the reconstruction of the Southern States.\r\nDuring each of these three trying eras it did sometimes seem as if that\r\nold piece of \"parchment,\" derided by Lord Brougham, had been utterly\r\nforgotten. Nevertheless, and despite all these trying experiences, we\r\nhave in the meantime advanced to the very front rank of nations, and our\r\npeople have long since turned, not only to the Union, but, we are happy\r\nto think, to the Constitution as well, with more devotion than ever.\r\n\r\nIt may be further said that, notwithstanding all the bitter animosities\r\nthat for long divided our country into two hostile sections, that\r\nwonderful old Constitution, handed down to us by our fathers, was\r\nalways, and in all seasons, in the hearts of our people, and that never\r\nfor a moment was it out of mind. Even in our sectional war Confederates\r\nand Federals were both fighting for it--one side to maintain it over\r\nthemselves as an independent nation; the other to maintain it over the\r\nwhole of the old Union. In the very madness of reconstruction the\r\nfundamental idea of the Constitution, the equality of the States,\r\nultimately prevailed--this idea it was that imperatively demanded the\r\nfinal restoration of the seceded States, with the right of\r\nself-government unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe future is now bright before us. The complex civilization of the\r\npresent is, we do not forget, continually presenting new and complex\r\nproblems of government, and we are mindful, too, that, for the people\r\nwho must deal with these problems, a higher culture is required, but to\r\nall this our national and State governments seem to be fully alive. We\r\nare everywhere erecting memorials to our patriotic dead, we have our\r\n\"flag day\" and many ceremonies to stimulate patriotism, and, throughout\r\nour whole country, young Americans are being taught more and more of\r\nAmerican history and American traditions.\r\n\r\nThe essence of these teachings presumably is that time has hallowed our\r\nConstitution, and that experience has fully shown the wisdom of its\r\nprovisions. In this land of ours, where there are so much property and\r\nso many voters who want it, and where the honor and emoluments of high\r\nplace are so tempting to the demagogue, there can be no such security\r\nfor either life, liberty, or property as those safeguards which our\r\nfathers devised in the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nOur teachers of history must therefore expose fearlessly every violation\r\nin the past of our Constitution, and point out the penalties that\r\nfollowed; and, above all, they cannot afford to condone, or to pass by\r\nin silence, the conduct of those who have heretofore advocated, or acted\r\non, any law which to them was _higher than the American Constitution_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious troubles in the past, many think our greatest,\r\nwas our terrible war among ourselves. Perhaps, after the lapse of nearly\r\nfifty years, we can all now agree that if our people and our States had\r\nalways, between 1830 and 1860, faithfully observed the Federal\r\nConstitution we should have not had that war. However that may be, the\r\ncrusade of the Abolitionists, which began in 1831, was the beginning of\r\nan agitation in the North against the existence of slavery in the South,\r\nwhich continued, in one form or another, until the outbreak of that war.\r\n\r\nThe negro is now located, geographically, much as he was then. If\r\nanother attempt shall be made to project his personal status into\r\nnational politics, the voters of the country ought to know and consider\r\nthe mistakes that occurred, North and South, during the unhappy era of\r\nthat sectional warfare. This little book is a study of that period of\r\nour history. It concludes with a glance at the war between the North and\r\nSouth, and the reconstruction that followed.\r\n\r\nThe story of Cromwell and the Great Revolution it was impossible for any\r\nEnglishman to tell correctly for nearly or quite two centuries. The\r\nchanges that had been wrought were too profound, too far-reaching; and\r\nEnglish writers were too human. The changes--economic, political, and\r\nsocial--wrought in our country by the great controversy over slavery and\r\nState-rights, and by the war that ended it, have been quite as profound,\r\nand the revolution in men's ideas and ways of looking at their past\r\nhistory has been quite as complete as those which followed the downfall\r\nof the government founded by Cromwell. But we are now in the twentieth\r\ncentury; history is becoming a science, and we ought to succeed better\r\nin writing our past than the Englishmen did.\r\n\r\nThe culture of this day is very exacting in its demands, and if one is\r\nwriting about our own past the need of fairness is all the more\r\nimperative. And why not? The masses of the people, who clashed on the\r\nbattlefields of a war in which one side fought for the supremacy of the\r\nUnion and the other for the sovereignty of the States, had honest\r\nconvictions; they differed in their convictions; they had made honest\r\nmistakes about each other; now they would like their histories to tell\r\njust where those mistakes were; they do not wish these mistakes to be\r\nrepeated hereafter. Nor is there any reason why the whole history of\r\nthat great controversy should not now be written with absolute fairness;\r\nthe two sections of our country have come together in a most wonderful\r\nway. There has been reunion after reunion of the blue and the gray. The\r\nsurvivors of a New Jersey regiment, forty-four years after the bloody\r\nbattle of Salem Church, put up on its site a monument to their dead, on\r\none side of which was a tablet to the memory of the \"brave Alabama\r\nboys,\" who were their opponents in that fight. One of those \"Alabama\r\nboys\" wrote the story of that battle for the archives of his own State,\r\nand the State of New Jersey has published it in her archives, as a fair\r\naccount of the battle.\r\n\r\nThe author has attempted to approach his subject in a spirit like this,\r\nand while he hopes to be absolutely fair, he is perfectly aware that he\r\nsees things from a Southern view-point. For this, however, no apology is\r\nneeded. Truth is many-sided and must be seen from every direction.\r\n\r\nNearly all the school-books dealing with the period here treated of, and\r\nnow considered as authority, have been written from a Northern\r\nstand-point; and many of the extended histories that are most widely\r\nread seem to the writer to be more or less partisan, although the\r\nauthors were apparently quite unconscious of it. Attempts made here to\r\npoint out some of the errors in these books are, as is conceived, in the\r\ninterests of history.\r\n\r\nOf course it is important that readers should know the stand-point of an\r\nauthor who writes at this day of events as recent as those here treated\r\nof. Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, professor of history in Harvard\r\nUniversity, in the preface to his \"Slavery and Abolition\" (Harper\r\nBrothers, 1906), says of himself: \"It is hard for a son and grandson of\r\nabolitionists to approach so explosive a question with impartiality.\"\r\nFollowing this example, the writer must tell that he was born in the\r\nSouth, of slave-holding parents, three years after the Abolition crusade\r\nbegan in 1831. Growing up in the South under the stress of that crusade,\r\nhe maintained all through the war, in which he was a loyal Confederate\r\nsoldier, the belief in which he had been educated--that slavery was\r\nright, morally and economically.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long after Appomattox, he told his father he had reached\r\nthe conclusion that slavery was wrong. The reply was, to the writer's\r\nsurprise, that his mother in early life had been an avowed\r\nemancipationist; that she (who had lived until the writer was sixteen\r\nyears old) had never felt at liberty to discuss slavery after the rise\r\nof the new abolitionists and the Nat Turner insurrection; and then\r\nfollowed the further information that when, in 1846, the family removed\r\nfrom South Carolina to Alabama, Greenville, Ala., was chosen for a home\r\nbecause it was thought that the danger from slave insurrections would be\r\nless there than in one of the richer \"black counties.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a creature of circumstances man is! The writer's belief about a\r\ngreat moral question, his home, his school-mates, and the companions of\r\nhis youth, were all determined by a movement begun in Boston,\r\nMassachusetts, before he was born in the far South!\r\n\r\nWith a vivid personal recollection of the closing years of the great\r\nanti-slavery crusade always in his mind, the writer has studied closely\r\nmany of the histories dealing with that movement, and he has found quite\r\na consensus of opinion among Northern writers--a view that has even been\r\nsometimes accepted in the South--that it was not so much the fear of\r\ninsurrections, created by Abolition agitation, that shut off discussion\r\nin the South about the rightfulness of slavery as it was the invention\r\nof the cotton-gin, that made cotton growing and slavery profitable. The\r\ncotton-gin was invented in 1792, and was in common use years before the\r\nwriter's mother was born. A native of, she grew to maturity entirely in,\r\nthe South, and in 1830 was an avowed emancipationist. The subject was\r\nthen being freely discussed.\r\n\r\nThe author has ventured to relate in the pages that follow this\r\nintroduction two or three incidents that were more or less personal, in\r\nthe hope that their significance may be his sufficient excuse.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having spoken of himself as a Southerner, the author thinks it\r\nbut fair, when invoking for the following pages fair consideration, to\r\nadd that, since 1865, he has never ceased to rejoice that slavery is no\r\nmore, and that secession is now only an academic question; and, further,\r\nthat he has, since Appomattox, served the government of the United\r\nStates for twenty years as loyally as he ever served the Confederacy. He\r\ntherefore respectfully submits that his experiences ought to render him\r\nquite as well qualified for an impartial consideration of the\r\nanti-slavery crusade and its consequences as are those who have never,\r\neither themselves or through the eyes of their ancestors, seen more than\r\none side of those questions. Certain he is, in his own mind, that this\r\nUnion has now no better friend than is he who submits this little study,\r\nconscious of its many shortcomings, claiming for it nothing except that\r\nit is the result of an honest effort to be fair in every statement of\r\nfacts and in the conclusions reached.\r\n\r\nNot much effort has been made in the direction of original research.\r\nFacts deemed sufficient to illustrate salient points, which alone can be\r\ntreated of in a short story, have been found in published documents,\r\nand other facts have been purposely taken, most of them, from Northern\r\nwriters; and the authorities have been duly cited. These facts have been\r\ncompressed into a small compass, so that the book may be available to\r\nsuch students as have not time for a more extended examination.\r\n\r\nOf the results of the crusade of the Abolitionists, and the consequent\r\nsectional war, George Ticknor Curtis, one of New England's distinguished\r\nbiographers, says in his \"Life of Buchanan,\" vol. II, p. 283:\r\n\r\n\"It is cause for exultation that slavery no longer exists in the broad\r\ndomain of this republic--that our theory of government and practice are\r\nnow in complete accord. But it is no cause for national pride that we\r\ndid not accomplish this result without the cost of a million of precious\r\nlives and untold millions of money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSECESSION AND ITS DOCTRINE\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske has said in his school history: \"Under the government of\r\nEngland before the Revolution the thirteen commonwealths were\r\nindependent of one another, and were held together juxtaposed, rather\r\nthan united, only through their allegiance to the British Crown. Had\r\nthat allegiance been maintained there is no telling how long they might\r\nhave gone on thus disunited.\"\r\n\r\nThey won their independence under a very imperfect union, a government\r\nimprovised for the occasion. The \"Articles of Confederation,\" the first\r\nformal constitution of the United States of America, were not ratified\r\nby Maryland, the last to ratify, until in 1781, shortly before Yorktown.\r\nIn 1787 the thirteen States, each claiming to be still sovereign, came\r\ntogether in convention at Philadelphia and formed the present\r\nConstitution, looking to \"a more perfect union.\" The Constitution that\r\ncreated this new government has been rightly said to be \"the most\r\nwonderful work ever struck off, at a given time, by the brain and\r\npurpose of man.\"[1] And so it was, but it left unsettled the great\r\nquestion whether a State, if it believed that its rights were denied to\r\nit by the general government, could peaceably withdraw from the Union.\r\n\r\n  [1] Gladstone, \"Kin Beyond the Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government was given by the Constitution only limited\r\npowers, powers that it could not transcend. Nowhere on the face of that\r\nConstitution was any right expressly conferred on the general government\r\nto decide exclusively and finally upon the extent of the powers granted\r\nto it. If any such right had been clearly given, it is certain that many\r\nof the States would not have entered into the Union. As it was, the\r\nConstitution was only adopted by eleven of the States after months of\r\ndiscussion. Then the new government was inaugurated, with two of the\r\nStates, Rhode Island and North Carolina, still out of the Union. They\r\nremained outside, one of them for eighteen months and the other for a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe States were reluctant to adopt the Constitution, because they were\r\njealous of, and did not mean to give up, the right of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution knew that the question of the right of a\r\nState to secede was thus left unsettled. They knew, too, that this might\r\ngive trouble in the future. Their hope was that, as the advantages of\r\nthe Union became, in process of time, more and more apparent, the Union\r\nwould grow in favor and come to be regarded in the minds and hearts of\r\nthe people as indissoluble.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the government there were many, including\r\nstatesmen of great influence, who continued to be jealous of the right\r\nof self-government, and insisted that no powers should be exercised by\r\nthe Federal Government except such as were very clearly granted in the\r\nConstitution. These soon became a party and called themselves\r\nRepublicans. Some thirty years later they called themselves Democrats.\r\nThose, on the other hand, who believed in construing the grants of\r\npower in the Constitution liberally or broadly, called themselves\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\nWashington was a Federalist, but such was his influence that the dispute\r\nbetween the Republicans and the Federalists about the meaning of the\r\nConstitution did not, during his administration, assume a serious\r\naspect; but when a new president, John Adams, also a Federalist, came in\r\nwith a congress in harmony with him, the Republicans made bitter war\r\nupon them. France, then at war with England, was even waging what has\r\nbeen denominated a \"quasi war\" upon us, to compel the United States,\r\nunder the old treaty of the Revolution, to take her part against\r\nEngland; and England was also threatening us. Plots to force the\r\ngovernment into the war as an ally of France were in the air.\r\n\r\nAdams and his followers believed in a strong and spirited government. To\r\nstrike a fatal blow at the plotters against the public peace, and to\r\ncrush the Republicans at the same time, Congress now passed the famous\r\nalien and sedition laws.\r\n\r\nOne of the alien laws, June 25, 1798, gave the President, for two years\r\nfrom its passage, power to order out of the country, _at his own will,\r\nand without \"trial by jury\" or other \"process of law,\" any alien he\r\ndeemed dangerous_ to the peace and safety of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe sedition law, July 14, 1798, made criminal any unlawful conspiracy\r\nto oppose any measure of the government of the United States \"which was\r\ndirected by proper authority,\" as well as also any \"false and scandalous\r\naccusations against the Government, the President, or the Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe opportunity of the Republicans had come. They determined to call\r\nupon the country to condemn the alien and sedition laws, and at the\r\npresidential election in 1800 the Federalists received their death-blow.\r\nThe party as an organization survived that election only a few years,\r\nand in localities the very name, Federalist, later became a reproach.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans began their campaign against the alien and sedition laws\r\nby a series of resolutions, which, drawn by Jefferson, were passed by\r\nthe Kentucky legislature in November, 1798. Other quite similar\r\nresolutions, drawn by Madison, passed the Virginia assembly the next\r\nyear; and these together became the celebrated Kentucky and Virginia\r\nresolutions of 1798-9.[2] The alien and sedition laws were denounced in\r\nthese resolutions for the exercise of powers not delegated to the\r\ngeneral government. Adverting to the sedition law, it was declared that\r\nno power over the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of\r\nthe press had been given. On the contrary, it had been expressly\r\nprovided by the Constitution that \"Congress shall make no law respecting\r\nan establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\r\n_or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press_.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Warfield, in his \"Kentucky Resolutions of 1798,\" relates that John\r\n  Breckenridge introduced the Kentucky and John Taylor, of Caroline, moved\r\n  the Virginia resolutions. In 1814 Taylor made it known that Madison was\r\n  the author of the Virginia resolves, but not till 1821 did Jefferson\r\n  admit his authorship of the Kentucky resolutions. Jefferson was\r\n  Vice-President when they were drawn, and it would have been thought\r\n  unseemly for him to appear openly in a canvass against the President,\r\n  but by correspondence with his friends he \"gradually drew out a program\r\n  of action\" (Warfield, p. 17). The Kentucky Resolutions were sent by the\r\n  Governor to the Legislatures of the other States, ten of which, being\r\n  controlled by the Federalists, are known to have declared against them\r\n  (Warfield, p. 115). But of course the resolutions were canvassed by the\r\n  public before the presidential election of 1800.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Kentucky resolutions was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the several States composing the United States of\r\n     America, are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to\r\n     their general government, _but that by compact_, under the style\r\n     and title of a constitution for the United States, and of\r\n     amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for\r\n     specific purposes, delegated to that Government certain definite\r\n     powers, _reserving, each State to itself_, the residuary mass of\r\n     right to their own self-government; and _that whensoever the\r\n     general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are\r\n     unauthoritative, void, and of no effect_: That to this _compact\r\n     each State acceded as a State_, and is an integral party, its\r\n     co-States forming, as to itself, the other party: That the\r\n     government created by _this compact, was not made the exclusive or\r\n     final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself_, since\r\n     that would have made its direction, and not the Constitution, the\r\n     measure of its powers; but that, _as in all other cases of compact\r\n     among parties having no common judge, each party has a right to\r\n     judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure\r\n     of redress._\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it is from the famous resolutions of 1798-9 that the\r\nsecessionists of a later date drew their arguments. The authors of these\r\ncelebrated resolutions were, both of them, devoted friends of the Union\r\nthey had helped to construct. Why should they announce a theory of the\r\nConstitution that was so full of dangerous possibilities?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, they were announcing the theory upon which the States, or\r\nat least many of the States, had ten years before ratified the\r\nConstitution. A crisis in the life of the new government had now come.\r\nCongress had usurped powers not given; it had exercised powers that had\r\nbeen prohibited, and the government was enforcing the obnoxious statutes\r\nwith a high hand. Dissatisfaction was intense.\r\n\r\nJefferson and Madison were undoubtedly Republican partisans, Jefferson\r\nespecially; but it is equally certain that they were both friends of the\r\nUnion, and as such they concluded, with the lights before them, that the\r\nwise course would be to submit to the people, in ample time for full\r\nconsideration, before the then coming presidential election, a full,\r\nclear, and comprehensive exposition of the Constitution precisely as\r\nthey, and as the people, then understood it. This they did in the\r\nresolutions of 1798 and 1799, and the very same voters who had created\r\nthe Constitution of 1789, now, with their sons to aid them, endorsed\r\nthese resolutions in the election of 1800, which had been laid before\r\nthem by the legislatures of two Republican States as a correct\r\nconstruction of that instrument.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans under Jefferson came into power with an immense\r\nmajority. The people were satisfied with the Constitution as it had been\r\nconstrued in the election of 1800, and the country under control of the\r\nRepublicans was happy and prosperous for three decades. Then the party\r\nin power began to split into National Republicans and Democratic\r\nRepublicans. The National Republicans favored a liberal construction of\r\nthe Constitution and became Whigs; the Democratic Republicans dropped\r\nthe name Republican and became Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sketch has been given with no intent to write a political\r\nhistory, but only to show with what emphasis the American people\r\ncondemned all violations of the Constitution up to the time when, in\r\n1831, our story of the Abolitionists is to begin. The sketch has also\r\nserved to explain the theory of State-rights, as it was held in early\r\ndays, and later, by the Southern people.\r\n\r\nWhether the union of the States under the Constitution as expounded by\r\nthe Kentucky and Virginia resolutions would survive every trial that was\r\nto come, remained to be seen. The question was destined to perplex Mr.\r\nJefferson himself, more than once.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even while Washington was President there had been disunion\r\nsentiment in Congress. In 1794 the celebrated Virginian, John Taylor, of\r\nCaroline, shortly after he had expressed an intention of publicly\r\nresigning from the United States Senate, was approached in the privacy\r\nof a committee room by Rufus King, senator from New York, and Oliver\r\nEllsworth, a senator from Massachusetts, both Federalists, with a\r\nproposition for a dissolution of the Union by mutual consent, the line\r\nof division to be somewhere from the Potomac to the Hudson. This was on\r\nthe ground \"that it was utterly impossible for the Union to continue.\r\nThat the Southern and the Eastern people thought quite differently,\"\r\netc. Taylor contended for the Union, and nothing came of the\r\nconference, the story of which remained a secret for over a hundred\r\nyears.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] Taylor was so deeply impressed by the conference, which was\r\n  protracted, that two days later, May 11, 1794, he made an extended note\r\n  of it which he sent to Mr. Madison. At the foot of his note Taylor says,\r\n  among other things: \"He (T.) is thoroughly convinced that the design to\r\n  break up the Union is contemplated. The assurance, the manner, the\r\n  earnestness, and the countenances with which the idea was uttered, all\r\n  disclosed the most serious intention. It is also probable that K. (King)\r\n  and E. (Ellsworth) having heard that T. (Taylor) was against the\r\n  (adoption of) the Constitution have hence imbibed a mistaken opinion\r\n  that he was secretly an enemy of the Union, and conceived that he was a\r\n  fit instrument (as he was about retiring) to infuse notions into the\r\n  anti-federal temper of Virginia, consonant to their views.\"--\"Disunion\r\n  Sentiment in the Congress in 1794\" (with fac-simile of Taylor\r\n  memorandum), by Gaillard Hunt, Editor of Writings of James Madison.\r\n  Lowdermilk Co., Washington, D. C., 1905.\r\n\r\n\"In the winter of 1803-4, immediately after, and as a consequence of,\r\nthe acquisition of Louisiana, certain leaders of the Federal party\r\nconceived the project of the dissolution of the Union and the\r\nestablishment of a Northern Confederacy, the justifying causes to those\r\nwho entertained it, that the acquisition of Louisiana to the Union\r\ntranscended the constitutional powers of the government of the United\r\nStates; that it created, in fact, a new confederacy to which the States,\r\nunited by the former compact, were not bound to adhere; that it was\r\noppressive of the interests and destructive of the influence of the\r\nnorthern section of the Confederacy, whose right and duty it was\r\ntherefore to secede from the new body politic, and to constitute one of\r\ntheir own.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] C. F. Robertson, \"The Louisiana Purchase,\" etc. \"Papers of the\r\n  American Association,\" vol. I, pp. 262, 263.\r\n\r\nThis project did not assume serious proportions.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske in his school history says: \"John Quincy Adams, a supporter\r\nof the embargo act of 1807, privately informed President Jefferson (in\r\nFebruary, 1809) that further attempts to enforce it in the New England\r\nStates would be likely to drive them to secession. Accordingly, the\r\nembargo was repealed, and the non-intercourse act substituted for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of nationality was yet in its infancy, threats of secession\r\nwere common, and they came then mostly from New England. These threats\r\nwere in no wise connected with slavery; agitators had not then made\r\nslavery a national issue; the idea of separation was prompted by the\r\nfear that power in the councils of the Union would pass into the hands\r\nof other sections.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was heard from again in 1811, when the State of Louisiana,\r\nthe first to be carved from the Louisiana purchase, asked to come into\r\nthe Union. In discussing the bill for her admission, Josiah Quincy said:\r\n\"Why, sir, I have already heard of six States, and some say there will\r\nbe at no great distance of time more. I have also heard that the mouth\r\nof the Ohio will be far to the east of the contemplated empire.... It\r\nis impossible that such a power could be granted. It was not for these\r\nmen that our fathers fought. It was not for them this Constitution\r\nwas adopted. You have no authority to throw the rights and liberties\r\nand property of this people into hotchpot with the wild men on\r\nthe Missouri, or with the mixed, though more respectable, race of\r\nAnglo-Hispano-Gallo-Americans who bask in the sands in the mouth of the\r\nMississippi.... _I am compelled to declare it as my deliberate opinion\r\nthat, if this bill passes, the bonds of the Union are virtually\r\ndissolved; that the States which compose it are free from their moral\r\nobligations; and that, as it will be the right of all, so it will be\r\nthe duty of some, to prepare definitely for a separation--amicably, if\r\nthey can; violently, if they must._\"\r\n\r\nJune 15, 1813, the Massachusetts legislature endorsed the position taken\r\nin this speech.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] \"American State Documents and Federal Relations,\" p. 21.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1814, a convention of representative New England statesmen met\r\nat Hartford, to consider of secession unless the non-intercourse act,\r\nwhich also bore hard on New England, should be repealed; but the war\r\nthen pending was soon to close, and the danger from that quarter was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nBut secession was not exclusively a New England doctrine. \"When the\r\nConstitution was adopted by the votes of States in popular conventions,\r\nit is safe to say there was not a man in the country, from Washington\r\nand Hamilton, on the one side, to George Clinton and George Mason, on\r\nthe other, who regarded the new system as anything but an experiment,\r\nentered into by the States, and from which each and every State had the\r\nright to withdraw, a right which was very likely to be exercised.\"[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] Henry Cabot Lodge's \"Webster,\" p. 176.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1844 the threat of secession was to come again from\r\nMassachusetts. The great State of Texas was applying for admission to\r\nthe Union. But Texas was a slave State; Abolitionists had now for\r\nthirteen years been arousing in the old Bay State a spirit of hostility\r\nagainst the existence of slavery in her sister States of the South, and\r\nin 1844 the Massachusetts legislature resolved that \"the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts, faithful to the _compact_ between the people of the\r\nUnited States, according to the plain meaning and intent in which it was\r\nunderstood by them, is sincerely anxious for its preservation; but that\r\nit is determined, as it _doubts not other States are, to submit to\r\nundelegated powers in no body of men on earth_,\" and that \"the project\r\nof the annexation of Texas, unless arrested at the threshold, may tend\r\nto drive _these States into a dissolution of the Union_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was _just seventeen years before the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\r\nbegan to arm her sons to put down secession in the South_!\r\n\r\nThe Southern reader must not, however, conclude from this startling\r\nabout-face on the question of secession, that the people of\r\nMassachusetts, and of the North, did not, _in 1861_, honestly believe\r\nthat under the Constitution the Union was indissoluble, or that the\r\nNorth went to war simply for the purpose of perpetuating its power over\r\nthe South. Such a conclusion would be grossly unjust. The spirit of\r\nnationality, veneration of the Union, was a growth, and, after it had\r\nfairly begun, a rapid growth. It grew, as our country grew in prestige\r\nand power. The splendid triumphs of our ships at sea, in the War of\r\n1812, and our victory at New Orleans over British regulars, added to it;\r\nthe masterful decisions of our great Chief Justice John Marshall,\r\npointing out how beneficently our Federal Constitution was adapted to\r\nthe preservation not only of local self-government but of the liberties\r\nof the citizen as well; peace with, and the respect of, foreign nations;\r\nfree trade between the people of all sections, and abounding\r\nprosperity--all these things created a deep impression, and Americans\r\nbegan to hark back to the words of Washington in his farewell address:\r\n\"The unity of our government, which now constitutes you one people, is\r\nalso dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the\r\nedifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquillity at\r\nhome, your peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that\r\nvery liberty which you so highly prize.\"\r\n\r\nBut far and away above every other single element contributing to the\r\ndevelopment of Union sentiment was the wonderful speech of Daniel\r\nWebster, January 26, 1830, in his debate in the United States Senate\r\nwith Hayne, of South Carolina. Hayne was eloquently defending States'\r\nrights, and his argument was unanswerable if his premise was admitted,\r\nthat, as had been theretofore conceded, the Constitution was _a compact\r\nbetween the States_. Webster saw this and he took new ground; the\r\nConstitution was, he contended, not a compact, but the formation of a\r\ngovernment. His arguments were like fruitful seed sown upon a soil\r\nprepared for their reception. No speech delivered in this country ever\r\ncreated so profound an impression. It was the foundation of a new school\r\nof political thought. It concluded with this eloquent peroration: \"When\r\nmy eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time the sun in heaven,\r\nmay I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a\r\nonce glorious Union; on States dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a\r\nland rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood!\r\nLet their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gracious\r\nensign of the republic, now known and honored throughout the earth,\r\nstill full high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their\r\noriginal lustre, not a stripe erased or polluted, not a single star\r\nobscured, bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as 'What\r\nis all this worth?' nor those other words of delusion and folly,\r\n'Liberty first and Union afterwards,' but everywhere, spread all over\r\nwith living light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they float over\r\nthe sea and over the land, and in every wind under the whole heavens,\r\nthat other sentiment, dear to every American heart--'Liberty _and_\r\nUnion, now and forever, one and inseparable.'\"\r\n\r\nFor many years every school-house in the land resounded with these\r\nwords. By 1861 they had been imprinted on the minds and had sunk into\r\nthe hearts of a whole generation. Their effect was incalculable.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that the secession resolution of the Massachusetts\r\nlegislature of 1844 was passed fourteen years after Webster's speech,\r\nbut the Garrisonians had then been agitating the slavery question within\r\nher borders for fourteen years, and the old State was now beside herself\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\nThere was another great factor in the rapid manufacture of Union\r\nsentiment at the North that had practically no existence at the South.\r\nIt was immigration.\r\n\r\nThe new-comers from over the sea knew nothing, and cared less, about the\r\nhistory of the Constitution or the dialectics of secession. They had\r\nsought a land of liberty that to them was one nation, with one flag\r\nflying over it, and in their eyes secession was rebellion. Immigrants to\r\nAmerica, practically all settling in Northern States, were during the\r\nthirty years, 1831-1860, 4,910,590; and these must, with their natural\r\nincrease, have numbered at least six millions in 1860. In other words,\r\nfar more than one-fourth of the people of the North in 1860 were not,\r\nthemselves or their fathers, in the country in the early days when the\r\ndoctrine of States' rights had been in the ascendant; and, as a rule, to\r\nthese new people that old doctrine was folly.\r\n\r\nIn the South the situation was reversed. Slavery had kept immigrants\r\naway. The whites were nearly all of the old revolutionary stock, and had\r\ninherited the old ideas. Still, love of and pride in the Union had grown\r\nin them too. Nor were the Southerners all followers of Jefferson. From\r\nthe earliest days much of the wealth and intelligence of the country,\r\nNorth and South, had opposed the Democracy, first as Federalists and\r\nlater as Whigs. In the South the Whigs have been described as \"a fine\r\nupstanding old party, a party of blue broadcloth, silver buttons, and a\r\ncoach and four.\" It was not until anti-slavery sentiment had begun to\r\narray the North, as a section, against the South, that Southern Whigs\r\nbegan to look for protection to the doctrine of States' rights.\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson says, in \"Division and Reunion,\" p. 47, of Daniel\r\nWebster's great speech in 1830: \"The North was now beginning to insist\r\nupon a national government; the South was continuing to insist upon the\r\noriginal understanding of the Constitution; that was all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in those attitudes the two sections stood in 1860-61, one upon the\r\nmodern theory of an indestructible Union; the other upon the old idea\r\nthat States had the right to secede from the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 there occurred in Ireland the \"Rebellion of the Young Irishmen.\"\r\nAmong the leaders of that rebellion were Thomas F. Meagher and John\r\nMitchel. Both were banished to Great Britain's penal colony. Both made\r\ntheir way, a few years later, to America. Both were devotees of liberty,\r\nboth men of brilliant intellect and high culture. Meagher settled in the\r\nNorth, Mitchel in the South. This was about 1855. Each from his new\r\nstand-point studied the history and the Constitution of his adopted\r\ncountry. Meagher, when the war between the North and South came on,\r\nbecame a general in the Union army. Mitchel entered the civil service of\r\nthe Confederacy and his son died a Confederate soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Union or Confederate partisan who has been taught that his side was\r\n\"eternally right, and the other side eternally wrong,\" should consider\r\nthe story of these two \"Young Irishmen.\"\r\n\r\nHow fortunate it is that the ugly question of secession has been\r\nsettled, and will never again divide Americans, or those who come to\r\nAmerica!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION PRIOR TO 1831\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Dutch, French, Portuguese,\r\nSpanish, English, and American vessels brought many thousands of negroes\r\nfrom Africa, and sold them as slaves in the British West Indies and in\r\nthe British-American colonies. William Goodell, a distinguished\r\nAbolitionist writer, tells us[7] that \"in the importation of slaves for\r\nthe Southern colonies the merchants of New England competed with those\r\nof New York and the South\" (which never had much shipping). \"They appear\r\nindeed to have outstripped them, and to have _almost monopolized_ at one\r\ntime the profits of this detestable trade. Boston, Salem, and\r\nNewburyport in Massachusetts, and Newport and Bristol in Rhode Island,\r\namassed, in the persons of a few of their citizens, vast sums of this\r\nrapidly acquired and ill-gotten wealth.\"[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] \"Slavery and Anti-Slavery,\" 3d ed., 1885.\r\n\r\nThe slaves coming to America went chiefly to the Southern colonies,\r\nbecause there only was slave labor profitable. The laws and conditions\r\nunder which these negroes were sold in the American colonies were\r\nprecisely the same as in the West Indies, except that the whites in the\r\nislands, so far as is known, never objected, whereas the records show\r\nthat earnest protests came from Virginia[8] and also from Georgia[9] and\r\nNorth Carolina.[10] The King of England was interested in the profits of\r\nthe iniquitous trade and all protests were in vain.\r\n\r\n  [8] _Am. Archives_, 4th series, vol. I, p. 696.\r\n\r\n  [9] _Ib._, p. 1136.\r\n\r\n  [10] _Ib._, p. 735.\r\n\r\nOf the rightfulness, however, of slavery itself there was but little\r\nquestion in the minds of Christian peoples until the closing years of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Then the cruelties practised by ship-masters in\r\nthe Middle Passage attracted attention, and then came gradually a\r\nrevolution in public opinion. This revolution, in which the churches\r\ntook a prominent part, originated in England, but it soon swept over\r\nAmerica also, both North and South.\r\n\r\nEngland abolished the slave trade in 1807. The United States followed\r\nin 1808; the Netherlands in 1814; France in 1818; Spain in 1820;\r\nPortugal in 1830. The great Wilberforce, Buxton, and others, who had\r\nbrought about the abolition of the slave trade in England, continued\r\ntheir exertions in favor of the slave until finally, in 1833, Parliament\r\nabolished slavery in the British West Indies, appropriating twenty\r\nmillions sterling ($100,000,000) as compensation to owners--this because\r\ninvestments in slave property had been made under the sanction of\r\nexisting law.\r\n\r\n\"Great Britain, loaded with an unprecedented debt and with a grinding\r\ntaxation, contracted a new debt of a hundred millions of dollars to give\r\nfreedom, not to Englishmen, but to the degraded African. This was not an\r\nact of policy, but the work of statesmen. Parliament but registered the\r\nedict of the people. The English nation, with one heart and one voice,\r\nunder a strong Christian impulse and without distinction of rank, sex,\r\nparty, or religious names, decreed freedom to the slave. I know not that\r\nhistory records a national act so disinterested, so sublime.\"\r\n\r\nSo wrote Dr. Channing, the great New England pulpit orator, in his\r\ncelebrated letter on Texas annexation, to Henry Clay, in 1837.\r\n\r\nWhile the rightfulness of slavery was being discussed in England, the\r\nAmerican conscience had also been aroused, and emancipation was making\r\nprogress on this side of the water.\r\n\r\nEmancipation was an easy task in the Northern States, where slaves were\r\nfew, their labor never having been profitable, and by 1804 the last of\r\nthese States had provided for the ultimate abolition of slavery within\r\nits borders. But the problem was more difficult in the Southern States,\r\nwhere the climate was adapted to slave labor. There slaves were\r\nnumerous, and slavery was interwoven, economically and socially, with\r\nthe very fabric of existence. Naturally, it occurred to thoughtful men\r\nthat there ought to be some such solution as that which was subsequently\r\nadopted in England, and which, as we have seen, was so highly extolled\r\nby Dr. Channing--emancipation of the slaves with compensation to the\r\nowners by the general government. The difficulty in our country was\r\nthat the Federal Constitution conferred upon the Federal Government no\r\npower over slavery in the States--no power to emancipate slaves or\r\ncompensate owners; and that for the individual States where the negroes\r\nwere numerous the problem seemed too big. Free negroes and whites in\r\ngreat numbers, it was thought, could not live together. To get rid of\r\nthe negroes, if they should be freed, was for the States a very serious,\r\nif not an unsurmountable task.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of January, 1824, the following resolutions, proposed\r\nas a solution of the problem, were passed by the legislature of\r\nOhio:[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] \"State Documents on Federal Relations,\" Ames, pp. 203-4.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the consideration of a system providing for the\r\n     gradual emancipation of the people of color, held in servitude in\r\n     the United States, be recommended to the legislatures of the\r\n     several States of the American Union, and to the Congress of the\r\n     United States.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, in the opinion of the general assembly, a system\r\n     of foreign colonization, with correspondent measures, might be\r\n     adopted that would in due time effect the entire emancipation of\r\n     the slaves of our country without any violation of the national\r\n     compact, or infringement of the rights of individuals; by the\r\n     passage of a law by the general government (with the consent of the\r\n     slave-holding States) which would provide that all children of\r\n     persons now held in slavery, born after the passage of the law,\r\n     should be free at the age of twenty-one years (being supported\r\n     during their minority by the persons claiming the service of their\r\n     parents), provided they then consent to be transported to the\r\n     intended place of colonization. Also:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is expedient that such a system should be\r\n     predicated upon the principle that the evil of slavery is a\r\n     national one, and that the people and the States of the Union ought\r\n     mutually to participate in the duties and burthens of removing it.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That His Excellency the Governor be requested to\r\n     forward a copy of the foregoing resolutions to His Excellency the\r\n     Governor of each of the United States, requesting him to lay the\r\n     same before the legislature thereof; and that His Excellency will\r\n     also forward a like copy to each of our senators and\r\n     representatives in Congress, requesting their co-operation in all\r\n     national measures having a tendency to effect the grave object\r\n     embraced therein.\r\n\r\nBy June of 1825 eight other Northern States had endorsed the\r\nproposition, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts. Six of the slave-holding States emphatically disapproved\r\nof the suggestion, _viz._, Georgia, South Carolina, Missouri,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama.[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] Ames, p. 203.\r\n\r\nReasons which in great part influenced all the Southern States thus\r\nrejecting the proposition may be gathered from the following words of\r\nGovernor Wilson, of South Carolina, in submitting the resolutions: \"A\r\nfirm determination to resist, at the threshold, every _invasion of our\r\ndomestic tranquillity_, and to _preserve our sovereignty and\r\nindependence as a State_, is earnestly recommended.\"[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] _Ib._, p. 206.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions required of the Southern States a complete surrender in\r\nthis regard of their reserved rights; they feared what Governor Wilson\r\ncalled \"the overwhelming powers of the general government,\" and were\r\nunwilling to make the admission required, that the slavery in the South\r\nwas a question for the nation.\r\n\r\nAnother reason was that, although there was a quite common desire in the\r\nSouthern States to get rid of slavery, the majority sentiment doubtless\r\nwas not yet ready for the step.\r\n\r\nBasing this plan on the \"consent of the slave-holding States,\" as the\r\nOhio legislature did, was an acknowledgment that the North had no power\r\nover the matter; while the proposition to share in the expense of\r\ntransporting the negroes, after they were manumitted, seems to be a\r\nrecognition of the joint responsibility of both sections for the\r\nexistence of slavery in the South. However that may be, the generous\r\nconcurrence of nine of the thirteen Northern States indicates how kindly\r\nthe temper of the North toward the South was before the rise of the \"New\r\nAbolitionism\" in 1831. Had emancipation been, under the Federal\r\nConstitution, a national and not a local question, it is possible that\r\nslavery might have been abolished in America, as it was in the mother\r\ncountry, peacefully and with compensation to owners.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio idea of freeing and at the same time colonizing the slaves, was\r\nno doubt suggested by the scheme of the African Colonization Society.\r\nThis Colonization Society grew out of a resolution passed by the General\r\nAssembly of Virginia, December 23, 1816. Its purpose was to rid the\r\ncountry of such free negroes and subsequently manumitted slaves as\r\nshould be willing to go to Liberia, where a home was secured for them,\r\nand a government set up that was to be eventually controlled by the\r\nnegro from America. The plan was endorsed by Georgia in 1817, Maryland\r\nin 1818, Tennessee in 1818, and Vermont in 1819.[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] Ames, 195.\r\n\r\nThe Colonization Society was composed of Southern and Northern\r\nphilanthropists and statesmen of the most exalted character. Among its\r\npresidents were, at times, President Monroe and ex-President Madison.\r\nChief Justice Marshall was one of its presidents. Colonization, while\r\nrelieving America, was also to give the negro an opportunity for\r\nself-government and self-development in his native country, aided at the\r\noutset by experienced white men, and Abraham Lincoln, when he was\r\neulogizing the dead Henry Clay, one of the eloquent advocates of the\r\nscheme, seemed to be in love with the idea of restoring the poor African\r\nto that land from which he had been rudely snatched by the rapacious\r\nwhite man. The society, with much aid from philanthropists and some from\r\nthe Federal Government, was making progress when, from 1831 to 1835,\r\nthe Abolitionists halted it.[15] They got the ears of the negro and\r\npersuaded him not to go to Liberia. Its friends thought the enterprise\r\nwould stimulate emancipation by furnishing a home for such negroes as\r\ntheir owners were willing to manumit; but the new friends of the negro\r\ntold him it was a trick of the slave-holder, and intended to perpetuate\r\nslavery--it was banishment. And Dr. Hart now, in his \"Abolition and\r\nSlavery,\" calls it a move for the \"expatriation of the negro.\"\r\n\r\n  [15] See Garrison's \"Garrison.\"\r\n\r\nAll together only a few thousand negroes went to Liberia. The enterprise\r\nlagged, and finally failed, partly because of opposition, but chiefly\r\nbecause the negroes were slothful and incapable of self-government. The\r\nword came back that they were not prospering. For a time, while white\r\nmen were helping them in their government, the outlook for Liberia had\r\nmore or less promise in it. When the whites, to give the negroes their\r\nopportunity for self-development withdrew their case was hopeless.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] See article in _Independent_, 1906, Miss Mahony.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, while emancipation was still being freely canvassed North and\r\nSouth, Benjamin Lundy, an Abolition editor in charge of _The Genius of\r\nEmancipation_, then being published at Baltimore, in a slave State, went\r\nto Boston to \"stir up\" the Northern people \"to the work of abolishing\r\nslavery in the South.\" Dr. Channing, who has been previously quoted,\r\nwrote a letter to Daniel Webster on the 28th of May, 1828, in which,\r\nafter reciting the purpose of Lundy, and saying that he was \"aware how\r\ncautiously exertions are to be made for it in this part of the country,\"\r\nit being a local question, he said: \"It seems to me that, before moving\r\nin this matter, we ought to say to them (our Southern brethren)\r\ndistinctly, 'We consider slavery _as your calamity, not your crime_, and\r\n_we will share with you the burden_ of putting an end to it. We will\r\nconsent that the public lands shall be appropriated to this object; or\r\nthat the general government shall be _clothed with the power to apply a\r\nportion of revenue to it_.'\r\n\r\n\"I throw out these suggestions merely to illustrate my views. We must\r\nfirst let the Southern States see that we are their _friends_ in this\r\naffair; that we sympathize with them and, from principles _of patriotism\r\nand philanthropy, are willing to share the toil and expense_ of\r\nabolishing slavery, or, I fear, our interference will avail\r\nnothing.\"[17] Mr. Webster never gave out this letter until February 15,\r\n1851.[18]\r\n\r\n  [17] \"Webster's Works,\" vol. V, pp. 366-67, 1851.\r\n\r\n  [18] _Ib._, ed. 1851, vol. V, pp. 266-67.\r\n\r\nIn less than three years after that letter was written, Lundy's friend,\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, started in Boston a crusade against slavery in\r\nthe South, on the ground that instead of being the \"_calamity_,\" as Dr.\r\nChanning deemed it to be, it was the \"_crime_\" of the South. Had no such\r\nexasperating sectional cry as this ever been raised, the story told in\r\nthis little book would have been very different from that which is to\r\nfollow. Even Spain, the laggard of nations, since that day has abolished\r\nslavery in her colonies. Brazil long ago fell into line, and it is\r\nimpossible for one not blinded by the sectional strife of the past, now\r\nto conceive that the Southern States of this Union, whose people in 1830\r\nwere among the foremost of the world in all the elements of Christian\r\ncivilization, would not long, long ago, if left to themselves, have\r\nfound some means by which to rid themselves of an institution condemned\r\nby the public sentiment of the world and even then deplored by the\r\nSoutherners themselves.\r\n\r\nThe crime, if crime it was, of slavery in the South in 1830 was one for\r\nwhich the two sections of the Union were equally to blame. Abraham\r\nLincoln said in his debate with Douglas at Peoria, Illinois, October 15,\r\n1858: \"When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for\r\nslavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the\r\ninstitution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it, in\r\nany satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I\r\nsurely do not blame them for not doing what I would not know how to do\r\nmyself.\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] \"The Negro Problem,\" Pickett, 1809.\r\n\r\nPrior to the rise of the Abolitionists in 1831, emancipationists in the\r\nSouth had been free to grapple with conditions as they found them. What\r\nthey and what the people of the North had accomplished we may gather\r\nfrom the United States census reports. The tables following are taken\r\nfrom \"Larned's History of Ready Reference,\" vol. V. The classifications\r\nare his. We have numbered three of his tables, for the sake of\r\nreference, and have added columns 4 and 5, calculated from Larned's\r\nfigures, to show \"excess of free blacks\" and \"increase of free blacks,\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\nLet the reader assume as a fact, which will perhaps not be questioned,\r\nthat \"free blacks\" in the census means freedmen and their increase, and\r\nthese tables tell their own story, a story to which must be added the\r\nstatement that slaves in the South had been freed only by voluntary\r\nsacrifices of owners.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in 1790 the total \"blacks\" in the North was\r\n67,479, and, although emancipation in these States had begun some years\r\nbefore, the excess of \"free blacks\" in the South was over 5,000. Also\r\nthat at every succeeding census, down to and including that of 1830, the\r\n\"excess of free blacks\" increased with considerable regularity until\r\n1830, when that excess is 44,547.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+----------+-------+---------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n  |                      |          |       |         |       |       |        |\r\n  |                      |          |       |         | TOTAL |EXCESS |INCREASE|\r\n  |                      |  WHITES  |  FREE |  SLAVES |BLACKS,|OF FREE|IN FREE |\r\n  |                      |          | BLACKS|         | NORTH |BLACKS,|BLACKS, |\r\n  |                      |          |       |         |       | SOUTH | SOUTH  |\r\n  |                      |          |       |         |       |       |        |\r\n  +----------------------+----------+-------+---------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n  |                      |          |       |         |       |       |        |\r\n  |1790: North, 9 States | 1,900,976| 27,109|   40,370| 67,479|  .... |   .... |\r\n  |      South, 8 States | 1,271,488| 32,357|  657,527|  .... | 5,248 |   .... |\r\n  |                      |          |       |         |       |       |        |\r\n  |1800: North, 11 States| 2,601,521| 47,154|   35,946| 83,100|  .... | 20,045 |\r\n  |      South,  9 States| 1,702,980| 61,241|  857,095|  .... |14,087 | 28,884 |\r\n  |      and D.C.        |          |       |         |       |       |        |\r\n  |                      |          |       |         |       |       |        |\r\n  |1810: North, 13 States| 3,653,219| 78,181|   27,510|105,691|  .... | 31,027 |\r\n  |      South, 11 States| 2,208,785|108,265|1,163,854|  .... |30,084 | 47,024 |\r\n  |            and D.

But there was not enough of it to\r\ninfluence legislation. In all but three or four of these States,\r\nemancipation was made difficult by laws which, among other conditions,\r\nrequired that slaves after being freed should leave the State.\r\n\r\nEmancipation in the North had not been completed in 1830. Professor\r\nIngram, president of the Royal Irish Academy, says in his \"History of\r\nSlavery,\" London, 1895, p. 184: \"The Northern States--beginning with\r\nVermont in 1777 and ending with New Jersey in 1804--either abolished\r\nslavery or adopted measures to effect its gradual abolition within their\r\nboundaries. But the principal operation of (at least) the latter change\r\nwas to transfer Northern slaves to Southern markets.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been in 1820 an angry discussion in Congress about the\r\nadmission of Missouri--with or without slavery--which was finally\r\nsettled by the Missouri Compromise. This dispute over the admission of\r\nMissouri is often said to have been the beginning of the sectional\r\nquarrel that finally ended in secession; but the controversy over\r\nMissouri and that begun by the \"New Abolitionists\" in 1831 were\r\nentirely distinct. They were conducted on different plans.\r\n\r\nIn the Missouri controversy the only questions were as to the expediency\r\nand constitutionality of denying to a new State the right to enter the\r\nUnion, with or without slavery, as she might choose. The entire dispute\r\nwas settled to the satisfaction of both sections by an agreement that\r\nStates thereafter, south of 36 deg. 30', might enter the Union with or\r\nwithout slavery; _and nobody denied, during all that discussion about\r\nMissouri, or at any time previous to_ 1831, _that every citizen was\r\nbound to maintain the Constitution and all laws passed in pursuance of\r\nit, including the fugitive slave law_.\r\n\r\n\"The North submitted at that time (1828) to the obligations imposed upon\r\nit by the fugitive slave-catching clause of the Constitution and the\r\nfugitive slave law of 1793.\"[20] So say the biographers of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison for the purpose of establishing, as they afterwards do, their\r\nclaim that Garrison conducted a successful revolt against that provision\r\nof the Constitution. What strengthens the statement that the North in\r\n1828 submitted without protest to the \"fugitive slave-catching clause of\r\nthe Constitution,\" is that the Compromise Act of 1820 contained a\r\nprovision extending the fugitive slave law over the territory made free\r\nby the act, while it should continue to be territory, and until there\r\nshould be formed from it States, to which the existing law would\r\nautomatically apply. Every subsequent _nullification of the fugitive\r\nslave laws_ of the United States, whether by governors or state\r\nlegislatures, was therefore a palpable _violation of a provision that\r\nwas of the essence of the Missouri Compromise_.\r\n\r\n  [20] Garrison's \"Garrison,\" vol. I, p. 113.\r\n\r\nThe South was content with the Missouri Compromise, and from that date,\r\n1820, until the rise of the \"New Abolitionists,\" slavery was in all that\r\nregion an open question. Judge Temple says in his \"Covenanter, Cavalier,\r\nand Puritan,\" p. 208: \"In 1826, of the 143 emancipation societies in the\r\nUnited States, 103 were in the South.\"\r\n\r\nThe questions for Southern emancipationists were: How could the slaves\r\nbe freed, and in what time? How about compensation to owners? Where\r\ncould the freed slaves be sent, and how? And, if deportation should\r\nprove impossible, what system could be devised whereby the two races\r\ncould dwell together peacefully? These were indeed serious problems, and\r\nrequired time and grave consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Who can doubt,\" says Mr. Curtis, to quote once more his \"Life of\r\nBuchanan,\" \"that all such questions could have been satisfactorily\r\nanswered, if the Christianity of the South had been left to its own time\r\nand mode of answering them, and without any external force but the force\r\nof kindly, respectful consideration and forebearing Christian\r\nfellowship?\"[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] George Ticknor Curtis's \"Life of Buchanan,\" vol. II, p. 283.\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ABOLITIONISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day of January, 1831, there came out in Boston a new paper,\r\n_The Liberator_, William Lloyd Garrison, editor. That was the beginning,\r\nhistorians now generally agree, of \"New Abolitionism.\" The editor of the\r\nnew paper was the founder of the new sect.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Lundy was a predecessor of Garrison, on much the same lines as\r\nthose pursued by the latter. Lundy had previously formed many Abolition\r\nsocieties. _The Philanthropist_ of March, 1828, estimated the number of\r\nanti-slavery societies as \"upwards of 130, and most of them in the slave\r\nStates, and of Lundy's formation, among the Quakers.\"[22] But Garrison\r\nbecame the leader and Lundy the disciple.\r\n\r\n  [22] Garrison's \"Garrison,\" vol. I.\r\n\r\nGarrison was a man of pleasing personal appearance, abstemious in\r\nhabits, and of remarkable energy and will power. He was a vigorous and\r\nforceful writer. Denunciation was his chief weapon, and he had \"a genius\r\nfor infuriating his antagonists.\" The following is a fair specimen of\r\nhis style. Speaking of himself and his fellow-workers as the \"soldiers\r\nof God,\" he said: \"Their feet are shod with the preparation of the\r\n_gospel of peace_.... Hence, when smitten on one cheek they turn the\r\nother also, being defamed they entreat, being reviled they bless,\" etc.\r\nAnd on that same page,[23] and in the same prospectus, showing how he\r\n\"blesses\" those who, as he understands, are outside of the \"Kingdom of\r\nGod,\" he says: \"All without are dogs and sorcerers, and ... and\r\nmurderers, and idolaters, and whatsoever loveth a lie.\"\r\n\r\n  [23] _Ib._, Vol. II, p. 202.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrison had no perspective, no sense of relation or proportion. In\r\nhis eye the most humane slave-holder was a wicked monster. He had a\r\ngenius for organization, and a year after the first issue of _The\r\nLiberator_ he and his little body of brother fanatics had grown into the\r\nNew England Anti-Slavery Society.\r\n\r\nThe new sect called themselves for a time the \"New Abolitionists,\"\r\nbecause their doctrines were new. The principles upon which this\r\norganization was to be based were not all formulated at once. The\r\nkey-note was sounded in Garrison's \"Address to the Public\" in the first\r\nnumber of _The Liberator_:\r\n\r\n     I shall strenuously contend for the immediate enfranchisement of\r\n     our slave population. I shall be as harsh as truth and as\r\n     uncompromising as justice on this subject. _I do not wish to think\r\n     or speak or write with moderation._\r\n\r\nIn an earlier issue, after denouncing slavery as a \"damning crime,\" the\r\neditor said: \"Therefore my efforts shall be directed to _the exposure of\r\nthose who practise it_.\"\r\n\r\nThe substance of Garrison's teachings was that slavery, anywhere in the\r\nUnited States, was the concern of all, and that it was to be put down by\r\nmaking not only slavery but also the slave-holder odious. And, further,\r\nit was the slave, not the slave-owner, who was entitled to compensation.\r\n\r\nThus the distinctive features of the new crusade were to be warfare upon\r\nthe personal character of every slave-holder and the confiscation of\r\nhis property. It was, too, the beginning of that sectional war by people\r\nof the North against the existence of slavery in the South, which, as we\r\nhave seen, was deprecated by Dr. Channing in his letter three years\r\nbefore to Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\nThe new sect began by assailing slavery in States other than their own,\r\nand very soon they were openly denouncing the Constitution of their\r\ncountry because under it slavery in those sections was none of their\r\nbusiness; and of course they repudiated the Missouri Compromise\r\nabsolutely, the essence of that compromise being that slavery was the\r\nbusiness of the States in which it existed.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of their scheme to send circulars depicting the evils of\r\nslavery broadcast through the South; and they were sent especially to\r\nthe free negroes of that section.\r\n\r\n\"In 1820,\" says Dr. Hart in his \"Slavery and Abolition,\" \"at Charleston\r\n(South Carolina), Denmark Vesey, a free negro, made an elaborate plot to\r\nrise, massacre the white population, seize the shipping in the harbor,\r\nand, if hard pressed, to sail away to the West Indies. One of the\r\nnegroes gave evidence, Vesey was seized, duly tried, and with\r\nthirty-four others was hanged.\"[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] Hart's \"Slavery and Abolition,\" p. 163.\r\n\r\nThis plot, so nearly successful, was fresh in the minds of Southerners\r\nwhen the Abolitionists began their programme, and naturally, the South\r\nat once took the alarm--an alarm that was increased by the massacre, in\r\nthe Nat Turner insurrection, of sixty-one men, women, and children,\r\nwhich took place in Virginia seven months after the first issue of _The\r\nLiberator_. One of Turner's lieutenants is stated to have been a free\r\nnegro. This insurrection the South attributed to _The Liberator_.\r\nProfessor Hart says a free negro named Walker had previously sent out to\r\nthe South, from Boston, a pamphlet, \"the tone of which was\r\nunmistakable,\" and that \"this pamphlet is known to have reached\r\nVirginia, and may possibly have influenced the Nat Turner\r\ninsurrection.\"[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] _Ib._, pp. 217-20.\r\n\r\nIf this surmise be correct, knowledge that Walker, a free negro, had\r\nbeen responsible for the Turner insurrection, would have lessened\r\nneither the guilt of the Abolitionists nor the fears of the Southerners.\r\n\r\nBut in 1832 Abolition agitation and the fears of insurrection had not\r\nas yet entirely stifled the discussion of slavery in the South. A debate\r\non slavery took place that year in the Virginia Assembly, the immediate\r\ncause of which was no doubt the Turner insurrection. The members of that\r\nbody had not been elected on any issue of that character. The discussion\r\nthus precipitated shows, therefore, the state of public opinion in\r\nVirginia on slavery. Of this debate a distinguished Northern writer\r\nsays:[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] \"Life of James Buchanan,\" George Ticknor Curtis, vol. II, pp.\r\n  277-78.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1832 there was, nowhere in the world, a more enlightened\r\nsense of the wrong and evil of slavery than there was among the public\r\nmen and people of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Assembly of that year Mr. Randolph brought forward a bill _to\r\naccomplish gradual emancipation_. Mr. Curtis continues:\r\n\r\n\"No member of the House defended slavery.... There could be nothing said\r\nanywhere, there had been nothing said out of Virginia, stronger and\r\ntruer in deprecating the evils of slavery, than was said in that\r\ndiscussion, by Virginia gentlemen, debating in their own legislature, a\r\nmatter that concerned themselves and their people.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was not pressed to a vote, but the House, by a vote of 65 to\r\n38, declared \"that they were profoundly sensible of the great evils\r\narising from the condition of the colored population of the Commonwealth\r\nand were induced by policy, as well as humanity, to attempt the\r\nimmediate removal of the free negroes; but that further action for the\r\n_removal of the slaves should await a more definite development of\r\npublic opinion_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph, who was from the large slave-holding county of Albemarle,\r\nwas re-elected to the next assembly.\r\n\r\nBut when the early summer of 1835 had come the fear of insurrection had\r\ncreated such wide-spread terror throughout the whole South that every\r\nemancipation society in that region had long since closed its doors; and\r\nnow the Abolitionists were sending South their circulars in numbers.\r\nMany were sent to Charleston, South Carolina,[27] where fifteen years\r\nbefore[28] the free negro, Denmark Vesey, had laid the plot to massacre\r\nthe whites, that had been discovered just in time to prevent its\r\nconsummation.\r\n\r\n  [27] Referred to in \"Life of Andrew Jackson,\" W. G. Sumner, p. 350.\r\n\r\n  [28] Hart, _supra._\r\n\r\nThe President, Andrew Jackson, in his next message to Congress,\r\nDecember, 1835, called their \"attention to the painful excitement\r\nproduced in the South by attempts to circulate through the mails\r\n_inflammatory appeals addressed to the passions of the slaves, in prints\r\nand in various sorts of publications calculated to stimulate them to\r\ninsurrection and produce all the horrors of a servile war_.\"\r\n\r\nThe good people of Boston were now thoroughly aroused. They had from the\r\nfirst frowned on the Abolition movement. Garrison was complaining that\r\nin all the city his society could not \"hire a hall or a meeting-house.\"\r\nThe Abolition idea had been for a time thought chimerical and therefore\r\nnegligible. Later, civic, business, social, and religious organizations\r\nhad all of them in their several spheres been earnest and active in\r\ntheir opposition; now it seemed to be time for concerted action.\r\n\r\nIn Garrison's \"Garrison\" (vol. I, p. 495), we read that \"the _social_,\r\n_political_, _religious and intellectual elite_ of Boston filled\r\nFaneuil Hall on the afternoon of Friday, August 3, 1835, to frame an\r\nindictment against their fellow-citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"indictment\" the _Boston Transcript_ reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the people of the United States by the\r\n     Constitution under which, by the Divine blessing, they hold their\r\n     most valuable political privileges, have solemnly agreed with each\r\n     other to leave to their respective States the jurisdiction\r\n     pertaining to the relation of master and slave within their\r\n     boundaries, and that no man or body of men, except the people of\r\n     the governments of those States, can of right do any act to\r\n     dissolve or impair the obligations of that contract.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we hold in reprobation all attempts, in whatever\r\n     guise they may appear, to coerce any of the United States to\r\n     abolish slavery by _appeals to the terror of the master or the\r\n     passions of the slave_.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we disapprove of all associations instituted in\r\n     the non-slave-holding States with the intent to act, within the\r\n     slave-holding States, on the subject of slavery in those States\r\n     without their consent. For the purpose of securing freedom of\r\n     individual thought they are needless--and they afford to those\r\n     persons in the Southern States, whose object is to effect a\r\n     dissolution of the Union (if any such there may be now or\r\n     hereafter), a pretext for the furtherance of their schemes.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That all measures adopted, _the natural and direct\r\n     tendency of which is to excite the slaves of the South to revolt,\r\n     or of spreading among them a spirit of insubordination_, are\r\n     repugnant to the duties of the man and the citizen, and that where\r\n     such measures become manifest by overt acts, which are recognizable\r\n     by constitutional laws, we will aid by all means in our power in\r\n     the support of those laws.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while we recommend to others the duty of\r\n     sacrificing their opinions, passions and sympathies upon the altar\r\n     of the laws, we are bound to show that a regard to the supremacy of\r\n     those laws is the rule of our conduct--and consequently to\r\n     deprecate all tumultuous assemblies, all riotous or violent\r\n     proceedings, all outrages on person and property, and all illegal\r\n     notions of the right or duty of executing summary and vindictive\r\n     justice in any mode unsanctioned by law.\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the last resolution is to a then recent lynching of\r\nnegroes in Mississippi charged with insurrection.\r\n\r\nIn speaking to these resolutions, Harrison Gray Otis, a great\r\nconservative leader, denounced the Abolition agitators, accusing them of\r\n\"wishing to 'scatter among our Southern brethren _firebrands_, _arrows_,\r\nand _death_,' and of attempting to force Abolition by appeals to the\r\nterror of the masters and the passions of the slaves,\" and decrying\r\ntheir \"measures, the natural and direct tendency of which is to excite\r\nthe slaves of the South to revolt,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnother of the speakers, ex-Senator Peleg Sprague, said (p. 496,\r\nGarrison's \"Garrison\") that \"if their sentiments prevailed it would be\r\nall over with the Union, which would give place to two hostile\r\nconfederacies, with forts and standing armies.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions and speeches, viewed in the light of what followed,\r\nread now like prophecy.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar rule of law that a contemporaneous exposition of a\r\nstatute is to be given extraordinary weight by the courts, the reason\r\nbeing that the judge then sitting knows the surrounding circumstances.\r\nThat Boston meeting pronounced the deliberate judgment of the most\r\nintelligent men of Boston on the situation, as they knew it to be that\r\nday; it was in their midst that _The Liberator_ was being published;\r\nthere the new sect had its head-quarters, and there it was doing its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nQuite as strong as the evidence furnished by that great Faneuil Hall\r\nmeeting is the testimony of the churches.\r\n\r\nThe churches and religious bodies in America had heartily favored the\r\ngeneral anti-slavery movement that was sweeping over all America between\r\n1770 and 1831, while it was proceeding in an orderly manner and with due\r\nregard to law.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the Methodist General Conference voted that no slave-holder\r\ncould continue as a local elder. The Presbyterian General Assembly in\r\n1818 unanimously resolved that \"slavery was a gross violation of the\r\nmost precious and moral rights of human nature,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThese bodies represented both the North and the South, and this\r\nparagraph shows what was, and continued to be, the general attitude of\r\nAmerican churches until after the Abolitionists had begun their assault\r\non both slavery in the South and the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwhich protected it. Then, in view of the awful social and political\r\ncataclysm that seemed to be threatened, there occurred a stupendous\r\nchange. We learn from Hart that Garrison \"soon found that neither\r\nminister _nor church anywhere in the lower South continued_ (as before)\r\nto protest against slavery; _that the cloth in the North was arrayed\r\nagainst him_; and that many Northern divines vigorously opposed him.\"\r\nAlso that Moses Stuart, professor of Hebrew in Andover Theological\r\nSeminary; President Lord, of Dartmouth College, and Hopkins, the\r\nEpiscopal bishop of Vermont, now became defenders of slavery. \"The\r\npositive opposition of churches soon followed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then we have cited, condemnations of Abolitionism by the Methodist\r\nConference of 1836, by the New York Methodist Conference of 1838, by the\r\nAmerican Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, by the American\r\nHome Missionary Society, the American Bible Society, the Protestant\r\nEpiscopal Church, and the Baptists. See for these statements, Hart, pp.\r\n211-12.\r\n\r\nThe import of all this is unmistakable; and this \"about-face\" of\r\nreligious organizations on the question of the morality of slavery has\r\nno parallel in all the history of Christian churches. Its significance\r\ncannot be overstated. It took place North and South. It meant opposition\r\nto a movement that was outside the church _and with which religion could\r\nhave no concern, except in so far as it was a vital assault upon the\r\nState, and the peace of the State_. To make their opposition effective\r\nthe Christians of that day did this remarkable thing. _They reversed\r\ntheir religious views on slavery, which the Abolitionists were now\r\nassailing, and which they themselves had previously opposed._ They\r\nre-examined their Bibles and found arguments that favored slavery. These\r\narguments they used in an attempt to stem an agitation that, as they saw\r\nit, was arraying section against section and threatening the perpetuity\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nUnited testimony from all these Christian bodies is more conclusive\r\ncontemporaneous evidence against the agitators and their methods than\r\neven the proceedings of all conservative Boston at Faneuil Hall in\r\nAugust, 1835.\r\n\r\nThis new attitude of the church toward slavery meant perhaps also\r\nsomething further--it meant that slavery, as it actually existed, was\r\nnot then as horrible to Northerners, who could go across the line and\r\nsee it, which many of them did, as it is now to those whose ideas of it\r\ncome chiefly from \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of this phenomenal movement of Northern Christians it is not\r\nstrange that Southern churches adhered, throughout the deadly struggle\r\nthat was now on, to the position into which they had been driven--that\r\nslavery was sanctioned by the Bible--nor is it matter of wonder that, as\r\nProfessor Hart makes prominent on p. 137, \"not a single Southern man of\r\nlarge reputation and influence failed to stand by slavery.\"\r\n\r\nHistorians of to-day usually narrate without comment that nearly all the\r\nAmerican churches and divines at first opposed the Abolitionists. It\r\nillustrates the courage with which the Abolitionists stood, as Dr. Hart\r\ndelights to point out, \"for a despised cause.\" They assuredly did stand\r\nby their guns.\r\n\r\nLater, another change came about in the attitude of the churches. In\r\n1844 the Abolitionists were to achieve their first victory in the great\r\nreligious world. The Methodist Church was then disrupted, \"squarely on\r\nthe question whether a bishop could own slaves, and all the Southern\r\nmembers withdrew and organized the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\"\r\nProfessor Hart, p. 214, says of this: \"Clearly, the impassioned\r\nagitation of the Abolitionists had made it impossible for a great number\r\nof Northern anti-slavery men _to remain on terms of friendship with\r\ntheir Southern brethren_.\"\r\n\r\nThat great Faneuil Hall meeting of August 31, 1835, was followed some\r\nweeks later by a lamentable anti-Garrison mob, which did not stand\r\nalone. In the years 1835, 1836, and 1837 a great wave of anti-Abolition\r\nexcitement swept over the North. In New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati,\r\nAlton (Illinois), and many other places, there were anti-Abolition\r\nriots, sometimes resulting in arson and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the great, peace-loving, patriotic, and theretofore happy\r\nand contented North, was at that time stirred with the profoundest\r\nindignation against the Abolitionists. Northern opinion then was that\r\nthe Abolitionists, by their unpatriotic course and their nefarious\r\nmethods, were driving the South to desperation and endangering the\r\nUnion. If the North at that time saw the situation as it really was, the\r\nhistorian of the present day should say so. If, on the other hand, the\r\npeople of both the North and South were then laboring under delusions,\r\nas to the facts that were occurring among them, those of this\r\ngeneration, who are wiser than their ancestors, should give us the\r\nsources of their information. To know the lessons of history we must\r\nhave the facts.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] The late Professor William Graham Sumner, of Yale, in his \"Life of\r\n  Andrew Jackson,\" 1888, treats of the excitement at Charleston, South\r\n  Carolina, in 1835, during Jackson's administration, over Abolition\r\n  circulars, etc. Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, Professor of History at\r\n  Harvard, in his \"Abolition and Slavery,\" 1906, treats of the same\r\n  subject. The following extracts from these books will show how these\r\n  authors picture that exciting period, and our italics will emphasize the\r\n  _sang-froid_ with which they touch off what so profoundly affected\r\n  public sentiment, both North and South, _when the events were\r\n  occurring_. Professor Sumner has this to say:\r\n\r\n  \"The Abolition Society adopted the policy of sending documents, papers,\r\n  and pictures against slavery to the Southern States.\r\n\r\n  \"_If the intention was_, as charged, to excite the slaves to revolt,\r\n  _the device, as it seems to us now_, must have fallen short of its\r\n  object, for the chance that anything could get into the hands of the\r\n  black man must _have been poor indeed_.\r\n\r\n  \"These publications, however, caused _a panic_ and _a wild indignation_\r\n  in the South.\"--Sumner's \"Jackson,\" p. 350.\r\n\r\n  Why should the Southerners of that day go _wild_ over conduct for which\r\n  the professor of this era has no word of condemnation?\r\n\r\n  Dr. Hart follows Professor Sumner's treatment. These are his words:\r\n\r\n  \"The free negroes of the South, the Abolitionists could not reach except\r\n  by _mailing publications to them_, a process which _fearfully\r\n  exasperated_ the South _without reaching the persons\r\n  addressed_.\"--Hart's \"Abolition and Slavery,\" p. 216.\r\n\r\n  Why should Southerners be \"fearful\" when they were intercepting all the\r\n  dangerous circulars, etc., they could find? And why should they be\r\n  exasperated at all?\r\n\r\n  Dr. Hart's chair at Harvard is within gunshot of Faneuil Hall, yet the\r\n  great meeting there of August 31, 1835, is not mentioned in either his\r\n  or Professor Sumner's book, nor is there to be found in either of them\r\n  _any explanation of the reasons underlying the general and emphatic\r\n  condemnation throughout the North at that period of the Abolitionists\r\n  and their methods_.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, at Framingham, Massachusetts, the Abolitionists celebrated the\r\nFourth of July thus: Their leader, William Lloyd Garrison, held up and\r\nburned to ashes, before the applauding multitude, one after another,\r\ncopies of\r\n\r\n1st. The fugitive slave law.\r\n\r\n2d. The decision of Commissioner Loring in the case of Burns, a fugitive\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n3d. The charge to the Grand Jury of Judge Benjamin R. Curtis in\r\nreference to the effort of a mob to secure a fugitive slave.\r\n\r\n4th. \"Then, holding up the United States Constitution, he branded it as\r\nthe source and parent of all other atrocities, 'a covenant with death\r\nand an agreement with hell,' and consumed it to ashes on the spot,\r\nexclaiming, 'So perish all compromises with tyranny! And let all the\r\npeople say, Amen!' A tremendous shout of 'Amen!' went up to heaven in\r\nratification of the deed, mingled with a few hisses and wrathful\r\nexclamations from some, who evidently were in a _rowdyish_ state of\r\nmind, but who were at once cowed by the popular feeling.\"[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Garrison's \"Garrison,\" vol. III, p. 412.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionist movement was radical; it was revolutionary. When an\r\naccredited teacher of history, in one of the greatest of our\r\nuniversities, writes a volume on \"Abolition and Slavery,\" why should he\r\nrestrict himself in comment, as Dr. Hart thus does in his preface? The\r\nbook is \"intended to show that there was more than one side to the\r\ncontroversy, and that both the milder form of opposition called\r\nanti-slavery and _the extreme form called Abolition_, were _confronted\r\nby practical difficulties_ which to many public men seemed\r\ninsurmountable.\"\r\n\r\nWhy should not the historian, in addition to pointing out the\r\n\"difficulties\" encountered by these extremists, _show how and why the\r\npeople of that day condemned their conduct_?\r\n\r\nCondonation of the Abolitionists, and a proper regard for the\r\nConstitution of the United States, cannot be taught to the youth of\r\nAmerica at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nThe writer has been unable to find any of the incendiary pamphlets that\r\nhad proved so inflammatory. He has, however, before him a little\r\nanonymous publication entitled \"Slavery Illustrated in its Effects upon\r\nWoman,\" Isaac Knapp, Boston, 1837. It was for circulation in the North,\r\nbeing \"Affectionately Inscribed to all the Members of Female\r\nAnti-Slavery Societies,\" and it is only cited here as an illustration of\r\nthe almost inconceivable venom with which the crusade was carried on to\r\n_embitter the North against the South_. It is a vicious attack upon the\r\nmorality of Southern men and women, and upon Southern churches. None of\r\nits charges does it claim to authenticate, and it gives no names or\r\ndates. One incident, related as typical, is of two white women, all the\r\ntime in full communion with their church, under pretence of a\r\nboarding-house, keeping a brothel, negro women being the inmates.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter entitled \"Impurity of the Christian Churches\" is this\r\nsentence: \"At present the Southern Churches are only one vast\r\nconsociation of hypocrites and sinners.\"\r\n\r\nThe booklet was published anonymously, but at that time any prurient\r\nstory about slavery in the South would circulate, no matter whether\r\nvouched for or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFEELING IN THE SOUTH--1835\r\n\r\n\r\nNot stronger than the proceedings of a great non-partisan public\r\nmeeting, or than the action of religious bodies, but going more into\r\ndetail as to public opinion in the South and the effect upon it of\r\nAbolition agitation, is the evidence of a quiet observer, Professor E.\r\nA. Andrews, who, in July, 1835, had been sent out as the agent of \"The\r\nBoston Union for the Relief and Improvement of the Colored Race.\" His\r\nreports from both Northern and Southern States, consisting of letters\r\nfrom various points, constitute a book, \"Slavery and the Domestic Slave\r\nTrade,\" Boston, 1836.\r\n\r\nJuly 17, 1835, from Baltimore, Professor Andrews reports that a resident\r\nclergyman, who appears to have his entire confidence, says, among other\r\nthings, \"that a disposition to emancipate their slaves is very prevalent\r\namong the slave-holders of this State, could they see any way to do so\r\nconsistently with the true interest of the slave, but that it is their\r\nuniversal belief that no means of doing this is now presented except\r\nthat of colonizing them in Africa.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the same city, July 17, 1835, he writes, p. 53: \"In this city there\r\nappears to be no strong attachment to slavery and no wish to perpetuate\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on p. 95: \"There is but one sentiment amongst those with whom I\r\nhave conversed in this city, respecting the possibility of the white and\r\ncolored races living peaceably together in freedom, nor during my\r\nresidence at the South and my subsequent intercourse with the Southern\r\npeople, _did I ever meet with one who believed it possible for the two\r\nraces to continue together after emancipation_.... When the slaves of\r\nthe South are liberated they form an integral part of the population of\r\nthe country, and must influence its destiny for ages--perhaps forever.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Fredericksburg, Virginia, Professor Andrews writes:\r\n\r\n     Since I entered the slave-holding country I have seen but one man\r\n     who did not deprecate wholly and absolutely the direct interference\r\n     of Northern Abolitionists with the institutions of the South. \"I\r\n     was an Abolitionist,\" has been the language of numbers of those\r\n     with whom I have conversed; \"I was an Abolitionist, _and was\r\n     laboring earnestly to bring about a prospective system of\r\n     emancipation. I even saw, as I believed, the certain and complete\r\n     success of the friends of the colored race at no distant period,\r\n     when these Northern Abolitionists interfered, and by their\r\n     extravagant and impracticable schemes frustrated all our hopes....\r\n     Our people have become exasperated, the friends of the slaves\r\n     alarmed_, etc....[31] Equally united are they in the opinion that\r\n     the servitude of the slaves is far more rigorous now than it would\r\n     have been had there been no interference with them. _In proportion\r\n     to the danger of revolt and insurrection, have been_ the severity\r\n     of the enactments for controlling them and the diligence with which\r\n     the laws have been executed.\"\r\n\r\n  [31] \"Slavery and the Domestic Slave Trade,\" Andrews, pp. 156-57.\r\n\r\nFrom a private letter, written at Greenville, Alabama, August 30, 1835,\r\nby a distinguished lawyer, John W. Womack, to his brother, we quote:\r\n\r\n     The anti-slavery societies in the Northern and Middle States are\r\n     doing all they can to destroy our domestic harmony by sending among\r\n     us pamphlets, tracts, and newspapers--for the purpose of exciting\r\n     dissatisfaction and insurrection among our slaves.... Meetings have\r\n     been held in Mobile, in Montgomery, in Greensboro, and in\r\n     Tuscaloosa, and in different parts of all the Southern States. At\r\n     these meetings resolutions have been adopted, disclaiming (_sic_)\r\n     and denying the right of the Northern people to interfere in any\r\n     manner in our internal domestic concerns.... It is my solemn\r\n     opinion that this question (to wit, slavery) will ultimately bring\r\n     about a dissolution of the Union of the States.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that in 1832 the massacre in Santo Domingo of\r\nall the whites by the blacks was fresh in mind. It had occurred in\r\n1814--after manumission--and had produced, especially in the minds of\r\nstatesmen and of all observers of the many signs of antagonism between\r\nthe two races, a profound and lasting impression.\r\n\r\nThe fear that the races, both free, could not live together was in the\r\nmind of Thomas Jefferson, of Henry Clay, and of every other Southern\r\nemancipationist. And deportation, its expense, and the want of a home to\r\nwhich to send the negro--here was a stumbling-block in the way of\r\nSouthern emancipation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the incompatibility of the races was an appalling thought in the\r\nminds of Southerners for the whole thirty years of anti-slavery\r\nagitation. It was even with Abraham Lincoln, and weighed upon his mind\r\nwhen, at last, in 1862, military necessity placed upon his shoulders the\r\nresponsibility of emancipating the Southern slaves. Serious as was the\r\nresponsibility, the question was not new to him. When Mr. Lincoln said,\r\nin his celebrated Springfield speech in 1858, \"I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free,\" and added that he\r\ndid not expect the government to fail, he certainly expected that\r\nemancipation in the South was coming; and, of course, he thought over\r\nwhat the consequences might be.\r\n\r\nIn that same debate with Douglas, in his speech at Charleston, Illinois,\r\nMr. Lincoln said: \"There is a physical difference between the white and\r\nblack races, which, I believe, will forever forbid the two races living\r\ntogether on terms of social and political equality.\"\r\n\r\nIn his memorial address on Henry Clay, in 1852, he had said: \"If, as the\r\nfriends of colonization hope, the present and coming generations of our\r\ncountrymen shall by some means succeed in freeing our land from the\r\ndangerous presence of slavery, and at the same time in restoring a\r\ncaptive people to their long lost father-land, ... it will, indeed, be a\r\nglorious consummation. And if to such a contribution the efforts of Mr.\r\nClay shall have contributed ... none of his labors will have been more\r\nvaluable to his country and his kind.\"\r\n\r\nIn his famous emancipation proclamation he promised \"that the effort to\r\ncolonize persons of African descent upon this continent or elsewhere,\r\nwith the consent of the government existing there, will be continued.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have been with a heavy heart that the great President announced\r\nthe failure of all his efforts to find a home outside of America for the\r\nfreedmen, _when he informed Congress in his December message, 1862, that\r\nall in vain he had asked permission to send the negroes, when freed, to\r\nthe British, the Danish, and the French West Indies; and that the\r\nSpanish-American countries in Central America had also refused his\r\nrequest_. He could find no places except Hayti and Liberia. He even made\r\nthe futile experiment of sending a ship-load to a little island off\r\nHayti.[32] Hume, in \"The Abolitionists,\" tells us that Mr. Lincoln for a\r\ntime _considered setting Texas apart as a home for the negroes_--so much\r\nwas he disturbed by this trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [32] Within perhaps a year Mr. Lincoln was compelled to bring these\r\n  negroes home; they were starving.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nANTI-ABOLITION AT THE NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nSoutherners, save perhaps a few who were wise enough to foresee what the\r\nconsequences might be, were deeply gratified when they read (1835-1838)\r\nof the violent opposition in the North to the desperate schemes of the\r\nAbolitionists. Surely these mobs fairly represented public opinion, and\r\nthat public opinion certainly was a strong guaranty to the South of\r\nfuture peace and security.\r\n\r\nBut the Abolitionists themselves were not dismayed. They may have\r\nmisread, indeed it is certain they did misunderstand, the signs of the\r\ntimes. Garrison in his _Liberator_ took the ground--as do his children\r\nin their life of him, written fifty years later--that the great Faneuil\r\nHall meeting of August 31, 1835, which they themselves declare\r\nrepresented \"the intelligence, the wealth, the culture, and the religion\r\nof Boston,\" was but an indication of the \"pro-slavery\" sentiment then\r\nexisting. In reality it was just what it purported to be--an\r\nauthoritative condemnation, not of the anti-slavery opinions, but of the\r\navowed purposes and methods of the new sect. The mobbing of Garrison and\r\nthe sacking of his printing office in Boston on September 26th, however,\r\nand the lawless violence to Abolitionists that followed the\r\ndenunciations of that despised sect by speakers, and by the public\r\npress, in New York, in Philadelphia, in Cincinnati, and elsewhere in the\r\nNorth, proved disastrous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nWhile that great wave of anti-Abolition feeling was sweeping over that\r\nwhole region from East to West, there were many good people who deluded\r\nthemselves with the idea that this new sect with its visionary and\r\nimpracticable ideas was being consigned to oblivion, but in what\r\nfollowed we have a lesson that unfortunately some of our people have not\r\nyet fully learned. Mob law in any portion of our free country, where\r\nthere is law with officers to enforce it, is a mistake, a mistake that\r\nis likely to be followed sooner or later by most disastrous results. The\r\nmobs that marked the beginning of our Revolution in 1774 were\r\nlegitimate; they meant revolt, revolt against constituted authorities.\r\nBut where a mob does not mean the overthrow of government, where it only\r\nmeans to substitute its own blind will for the arm of the law, not good\r\nbut evil--it may be long deferred, but evil eventually--is sure to\r\nfollow. When mobs assailed Abolitionists because they threatened the\r\npeace and tranquillity of the country, evil followed swiftly.\r\n\r\nViolent and harsh treatment of these mischievous agitators almost\r\neverywhere in the North, and the heroism with which they endured\r\nignominy and insult, brought about a revulsion of public sentiment. To\r\nunderstand the philosophy of this, read two extracts from the writings\r\nof that great, and universally admired, pulpit orator, Dr. William E.\r\nChanning of Boston, the first written sometime prior to that August\r\nmeeting:\r\n\r\n     The adoption of the common system of agitation by the Abolitionists\r\n     has not been justified by success. From the beginning it has\r\n     created alarm in the considerate, and strengthened the sympathies\r\n     of the Free States with the slave-holder. It has made converts of\r\n     a few individuals, but alienated multitudes. _Its influence at the\r\n     South has been almost wholly evil. It has stirred up bitter\r\n     passions, and a fierce fanaticism, which have shut every ear and\r\n     every heart against its arguments and persuasions._ These efforts\r\n     are more to be deplored, because the hope of freedom to the slave\r\n     lies chiefly in the dispositions of his master. The Abolitionist\r\n     proposed indeed to convert the slave-holder; and for this end he\r\n     _approached them with vituperation, and exhausted upon them the\r\n     vocabulary of reproach_. And he has reaped as he sowed.... Perhaps\r\n     (though I am anxious to repel the thought) something has been lost\r\n     to the cause of freedom and humanity.[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] \"Channing's Works,\" vol. II, ed. 1837, pp. 131-32.\r\n\r\nThese were Dr. Channing's opinions of the Abolitionists prior to August,\r\n1835, and he seems to have kept silent for a time after the mobbing that\r\nfollowed that great Faneuil Hall meeting; but a year later, when many\r\nother things had happened along the same line, he spoke out in an open\r\nletter to James G. Birney, an Abolitionist editor who had been driven\r\nfrom Cincinnati, and whose press, on which _The Philanthropist_ was\r\nprinted, had been broken up. In that letter, p. 157, _supra_, speaking\r\nof course not for himself alone, Dr. Channing says:\r\n\r\n     I think it best ... to extend my remarks to the spirit of violence\r\n     and persecution which has broken out against the Abolitionists\r\n     throughout the whole country. Of their merits and demerits as\r\n     Abolitionists I have formerly spoken.... I have expressed my\r\n     fervent attachment to the great end to which they are pledged and\r\n     at the same time _my disapprobation, to a certain extent, of their\r\n     spirit and measures_.... Deliberate, systematic efforts have been\r\n     made, _not here and there, but far and wide_, to wrest from its\r\n     adherents that _liberty of speech and the press_, which our fathers\r\n     asserted in blood, and which our National and State Governments are\r\n     pledged to protect as our most sacred right. Its most conspicuous\r\n     advocates have been hunted and stoned, its meetings scattered, its\r\n     presses broken up, and nothing but the patience, constancy and\r\n     intrepidity of its members has saved it from extinction.... They\r\n     are _sufferers for the liberty of thought, speech and press; and in\r\n     maintaining this liberty, amidst insult and violence, they deserve\r\n     a place among its honorable defenders_.\r\n\r\nStill admitting that \"their writings have been blemished by a spirit of\r\nintolerance, sweeping censure, and rash, injurious judgment,\" this great\r\nman now threw all the weight of his influence on the side of the\r\nAbolitionists, because they were _the champions of free speech_. Their\r\nmoral worth and steady adherence to their ideas of non-resistance he\r\npointed to admiringly, and it must always be remembered to their credit\r\nthat the private lives of Garrison and his leading co-workers were\r\nirreproachable. Indeed, the unselfish devotion of these agitators and\r\ntheir high moral character were in themselves a serious misfortune. They\r\nsoon attracted a lot of zealots, male and female, who became as reckless\r\nas they were. And these out-and-out fanatics were not themselves\r\noffice-seekers. What they feared, they said, was that a \"lot of soulless\r\nscamps would jump on to their shoulders to ride into office\";[34] and\r\nthere really was the great danger, as appeared later.\r\n\r\n  [34] Garrison's \"Garrison,\" vol. III, p. 214.\r\n\r\nIn the results that followed the mobbing of Abolitionists in the North,\r\nfrom 1834 to 1836, is to be found another lesson for those voters of\r\nthis day who can profit by the teachings of history. The violent\r\nassaults on the Abolitionists by the friends of the Constitution and the\r\nUnion constituted an epoch in the lives of these people. It gave them a\r\nfooting and a hearing and many converts.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted some wonderful and instructive changes in the tide\r\nof events set in motion by the radical teachings of the New\r\nAbolitionists. The churches, as has been shown, to save the country,\r\nNorth and South, changed their attitude on slavery itself. Dr. Channing,\r\nwho had opposed the methods of the Abolitionists, became, as many others\r\ndid with him, when mobs had assailed these people, their defender and\r\neulogist, because they were martyrs for the sake of free speech; and now\r\nwe are to see in John Quincy Adams another change, equally notable, a\r\nchange that was to make Mr. Adams thenceforward the most momentous\r\nfigure, at least during its earlier stages, in the tragic drama that is\r\nthe subject of our story.\r\n\r\nElected to the House of Representatives after the expiration of his term\r\nas President, Mr. Adams was not in sympathy with the methods of the\r\nAbolitionists. Indeed, prior to December 31, 1831, he had shown as\r\nlittle interest in slavery as he did when on that day in presenting to\r\nthe House fifteen petitions against slavery he \"deprecated a discussion\r\nwhich would lead to ill-will, to heart-burning, to mutual hatred ...\r\nwithout accomplishing anything else.\"[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] Hart's \"Slavery and Abolition,\" p. 256.\r\n\r\nThe petitions presented by Mr. Adams were referred to a committee.\r\n\r\nThe Southerners had not then become so exasperated as to insist on\r\nCongress refusing to receive Abolition petitions. But multiplying these\r\npetitions was a ready means of provoking the slave-holders, and soon\r\npetitions poured in from many quarters, couched, most of them, in\r\nlanguage, not disrespectful to Congress but provoking to slave-holders.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the lower house of Congress on May 26, 1836, which was\r\nwhile mobs in the North were still trying to put down the Abolitionists,\r\npassed a resolution that all such petitions, etc., should thereafter be\r\nlaid upon the table, _without further action_. Adams voted against it as\r\n\"a direct violation of the Constitution of the United States.\" The\r\nConstitution forbids any law \"abridging the freedom of speech ... or the\r\nright ... to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" The\r\nresolution to lay all anti-slavery petitions on the table without\r\nfurther action was passed, \"with the hope that it might put a stop to\r\nthe agitation that seemed to endanger the existence of the Union.\" But\r\nit had the opposite effect. It soon became known as the \"gag\r\nresolution,\" and was, for years, the centre of the most aggravating\r\ndiscussions that had, up to that time, ever occurred in Congress. Mr.\r\nAdams in these debates became, without, it seems, ever having been in\r\nfull sympathy with the agitators, thenceforward their champion in\r\nCongress, and so continued until the day of his death in 1848.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists were happy. They were succeeding in their\r\nprogramme--making the Southern slave-holder odious by exasperating him\r\ninto offending Northern sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA CRISIS AND A COMPROMISE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1840 there were 200 Abolition societies, with a membership of over\r\n200,000. Agitation had created all over the North a spirit of hostility\r\nto slavery as it existed in the South, and especially to the admission\r\nof new slave States into the Union. In 1840 the struggle over the\r\napplication of Texas for admission into the Union had already, for three\r\nyears, been mooted. Objections to the admission of the new State were\r\nmany, such as: American adventurers had wrongfully wrested control of\r\nthe new State from Mexico; boundary lines were unsettled; war with\r\nMexico would follow, etc.; but chiefly, Texas was a slave State, which\r\nwas, in the South, a strong reason for annexation. There were, however,\r\nmany sound and unanswerable arguments for the admission of the new\r\nState, just such as had influenced Jefferson in purchasing the\r\nLouisiana territory: Texas was contiguous, her territory and resources\r\nimmense.\r\n\r\nOn the issue thus joined the first great gun had been fired by Dr.\r\nChanning, who, though still more moderate than some, might now be\r\nclassed as an Abolitionist. August 1, 1837, he wrote a long open letter\r\nto Henry Clay against annexation, and in that letter he said:\r\n\r\n     To me it seems not only the right but the duty of the Free States,\r\n     in case of the annexation of Texas, to say to the slave-holding\r\n     States, \"We regard this act as the dissolution of the Union; the\r\n     essential conditions of the National Compact are violated.\"[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] \"Channing's Works,\" vol. II, ed. 1847, p. 237.\r\n\r\nThis was very like the pronunciamento already made by Garrison--\"no\r\nunion with slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe underlying reasons that controlled Southern statesmen in this\r\ncontest over Texas, and the motives that animated them in the fierce\r\nbattles they fought later for new slave States, are thus stated by Mr.\r\nGeorge Ticknor Curtis, of New England.[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] \"Life of Buchanan,\" vol. II, p. 280.\r\n\r\n     It should in justice be remembered that the effort _at that period\r\n     to enlarge the area of slavery was an effort on the part of the\r\n     South, dictated by a desire to remain in the Union, and not to\r\n     accept the issue of an inherent incompatibility of a political\r\n     union between slave-holding and non-slave-holding States_.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the first effort for the annexation of Texas, by treaty, was\r\ndefeated in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIf the Southerners had been as ready to accept the doctrine of an\r\ninherent incompatibility between slave and free States as were Dr.\r\nChanning and those other Abolitionists who were now declaring for \"no\r\nunion with slave-holders,\" they would at once have seceded and joined\r\nTexas; but the South still loved the Union, and strove, down to 1860,\r\npersistently, and often passionately, for power that would enable it to\r\nremain safely in its folds.\r\n\r\nTexas was finally admitted in 1845, after annexation had been passed on\r\nby the people in the presidential election of 1844. In that election\r\nClay was defeated by the Abolitionists. Because Clay was not\r\nunreservedly against annexation the Abolitionists drew from the Whigs in\r\nNew York State enough votes, casting them for Birney, to defeat Clay and\r\nelect Polk; and now Abolitionism was a factor in national politics.\r\n\r\nThe two great national parties were the Democrats and the Whigs, the\r\nvoters somewhat equally divided between them. For years both parties had\r\nregarded the Abolitionists precisely as did the non-partisan meeting at\r\nFaneuil Hall, in August, 1835--as a band of agitators, organized for the\r\npurpose of interfering with slavery where it was none of their business;\r\nand both parties had meted out to this new and, as they deemed it,\r\npestilent sect, unstinted condemnation. But at last the voters of this\r\ndespised cult had turned a presidential election and were making inroads\r\nin both parties. Half a dozen Northern States, in which in 1835 \"no\r\nprotest had been made against the fugitive slave law of 1793,\" had\r\nalready passed \"personal liberty laws\" intended to obstruct and nullify\r\nthat law. And now it was \"slave-catchers\" and not Abolitionists who were\r\nbeing mobbed in the North.\r\n\r\nBoston had reversed its attitude toward the Abolitionists. On May 31,\r\n1849, the New England Anti-Slavery Society was holding its annual\r\nconvention in that very Faneuil Hall where, in 1835, Abolitionism had\r\nbeen so roundly condemned; and now Wendell Phillips, pointing to one of\r\ntwo fugitive slaves, who then sat triumphantly on the platform, said,\r\n\"amid great applause, ... 'We say that they may make their little laws\r\nin Washington, but that _Faneuil Hall repeals them_, in the name of the\r\nhumanity of Massachusetts.'\"[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Garrison's \"Garrison,\" vol. III, p. 247.\r\n\r\nPoets headed by Whittier and Longfellow, authors like Emerson and\r\nLowell, and orators like Theodore Parker and Wendell Phillips, had\r\njoined the agitators, and all united in assaulting the fugitive slave\r\nlaw. The following, from James Russell Lowell's \"Biglow Papers,\" No. 1,\r\nJune, 1840, is a specimen of the literature that was stirring up\r\nhostility against slavery and the \"slave-catcher\" in the breasts of many\r\nthousands, who were joining in an anti-slavery crusade while disdaining\r\ncompanionship with the Abolitionists:\r\n\r\n  \"Ain't it cute to see a Yankee\r\n  Take such everlastin' pains\r\n  All to get the Devil's Thankee\r\n  Helpin' on 'em weld their chains?\"\r\n  W'y it's jest es clear es figgers,\r\n  Clear es one and one makes two,\r\n  Chaps that makes black slaves of niggers\r\n  Want to make w'ite slaves o' you.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the people of the South, much excited, were resorting to\r\nrepression, passing laws to prevent slaves from being taught to read,\r\nand laws, in some States, inhibiting assemblages of slaves above given\r\nnumbers, unless some white person were present--all as safeguards\r\nagainst insurrection. Thus, in 1835, an indictment was found in\r\nTuscaloosa County, Alabama, against one Williams, who had never been in\r\nAlabama, for circulating there an alleged incendiary document, and\r\nGovernor Gayle made requisition on Governor Marcy, of New York, for the\r\nextradition of Williams. Governor Marcy denied the request. The case was\r\nthe same as that more recently decided by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, when it held that editors of New York and Indiana papers\r\ncould not be brought to the District of Columbia for trial.\r\n\r\nThe South, all the while clamoring to have the agitators put down, had\r\nby still other means than these contributed to the ever-increasing\r\nexcitement in the North. Southerners had mobbed Abolitionists, and\r\nwhipped and driven out of the country persons found in possession of\r\n_The Liberator_ or suspected of circulating other incendiary literature.\r\nAnd violence in the South against the Abolitionists had precisely the\r\nsame effect on the Northern mind as the violence against them in the\r\nNorth had from 1835 to 1838, but there was this difference: the refugee\r\nfrom the distant South, whether he were an escaped slave or a fleeing\r\nAbolitionist, could color and exaggerate the wrongs he had suffered and\r\nso parade himself as a martyr. While this was true, it was also quite\r\noften true that the outrage committed in the South against the suspect\r\nwas real enough--a mob had whipped and expelled him without any trial.\r\n_And this is another of the lessons as to the evil effects of mob law\r\nthat crop out all through the history of the anti-slavery crusade. No\r\ngood can come from violating the law._\r\n\r\nIn 1848 another presidential election turned on the anti-slavery vote,\r\nthis time again in New York State. Anti-slavery Democrats bolted the\r\nDemocratic ticket, thus electing General Taylor, the Whig candidate.\r\n\r\nIn the canvass preceding this election originated, we are told, the\r\ncatch-phrase applied to Cass, the Democratic candidate--\"a Northern man\r\nwith Southern principles.\" The phrase soon became quite common, South\r\nand North--\"a Southern man with Northern principles,\" and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe invention and use of it in 1848 shows the progress that had been\r\nmade in arraying one section of the Union against the other. Later, a\r\ntelling piece of doggerel in Southern canvasses, and it must also have\r\nbeen used North, was\r\n\r\n  He wired in and wired out,\r\n  Leaving the people all in doubt,\r\n  Whether the snake that made the track\r\n  Was going North, or coming back.\r\n\r\nOver the admission of California in 1849 there was another battle.\r\nCalifornia, 734 miles long, with about 50,000 people (less than the\r\nusual number), and with a constitution improvised under military\r\ngovernment, applied for admission as a State. Southerners insisted on\r\nextending the line of the Missouri Compromise to the Pacific, thereby\r\nmaking of the new territory two States. The South had been much\r\nembittered by the opposition to the admission of Texas. Texas was,\r\nnearly all of it, below the Missouri Compromise line, and the South\r\nthought it was equitably entitled to come in under that agreement. Its\r\ncase, too, differed from that of Missouri, which already belonged to the\r\nUnited States when it applied for admission as a State. Texas, with all\r\nits vast wealth, was asking to come in without price.\r\n\r\nAnother continuing and increasing cause of distraction had been the use\r\nmade by Abolitionists of the right of petition. As already shown,\r\npetitions to Congress against slavery had been received without question\r\ntill 1836, when Northern conservatives and Southern members, hoping to\r\nabate this source of agitation, had combined to pass a resolution to lay\r\nthem on the table, which meant that they were to be no further noticed.\r\nThe Abolitionists were so delighted over the indefensible position into\r\nwhich they had driven the conservatives--the \"gag law\"--that they\r\ncontinued, up to the crisis of 1850, with unflagging zeal to hurry in\r\nmonster petitions, one after another. The debates provoked by the\r\npresentation of these petitions, and the more and more heated\r\ndiscussions in Congress of _slavery in the States_, which was properly\r\n_a local and not a national question_, now attracted still wider public\r\nattention. The Abolitionists had almost succeeded in arraying the entire\r\nsections against each other, in making of the South and North two\r\nhostile nations. Professor John W. Burgess, dean of the Faculty of\r\nPolitical Science in Columbia University, says: \"It would not be\r\nextravagant to say that the whole course of the internal history of the\r\nUnited States from 1836 to 1861 was more largely determined by the\r\nstruggle in Congress, over the _Abolition petitions_ and the use of the\r\nmails for the Abolition literature, than anything else.\"[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] \"The Middle Period,\" John W. Burgess, p. 274.\r\n\r\nThe South had its full share in the hot debates that took place over\r\nthese matters in Congress. Its congressmen were quite as aggressive as\r\nthose from the North, and they were accused of being imperious in\r\nmanner, when demanding that a stop should be put to Abolition petitions,\r\nand Abolition literature going South in the mails.\r\n\r\nThere was another cause of complaint from the South, and this was grave.\r\nBy the \"two underground railroads\" that had been established, slaves,\r\nestimated at 2,000 annually, abducted or voluntarily escaping, were\r\nsecretly escorted into or through the free States to Canada. To show how\r\nall this was then regarded by those who sympathized with the\r\nAbolitionists, and how it is still looked upon by some modern\r\nhistorians, the following is given from Hart's \"Abolition and Slavery\":\r\n\r\n\"The underground railroad was manned chiefly by orderly citizens,\r\nmembers of churches, and philanthropical citizens. _To law-abiding folk_\r\nwhat could be more delightful than the sensation of aiding an oppressed\r\nslave, _exasperating_ a cruel master, and at the same time incurring the\r\npenalties of _defying an unrighteous law_?\"\r\n\r\nSoutherners at that time thought that conductors on that line were\r\npractising, and readers of the above paragraph will probably think that\r\nDr. Hart in his attractive rhetoric is now extolling in his history,\r\n\"higher law doctrines.\"\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that, in 1850, a large majority of the Northern\r\npeople strongly disapproved of the Abolitionists and their methods.\r\nModern historians carefully point out the difference between the great\r\nbody of Northern anti-slavery people and the Abolitionists.\r\nNevertheless, here were majorities in eleven Northern States voting for,\r\nand sustaining, the legislators who passed and kept upon the statute\r\nbooks laws which were intended to enable Southern slaves to escape from\r\ntheir masters. The enactment and the support of these laws was an attack\r\nupon the constitutional rights of slave-holders; and Southern people\r\nlooked upon all the voters who sustained these laws, and all the\r\nanti-slavery lecturers, speakers, pulpit orators, and writers of the\r\nNorth, as engaged with the Abolitionists in one common crusade against\r\nslavery. From the Southern stand-point a difference between them could\r\nonly be made by a Hudibras:\r\n\r\n  He was in logic a great critic\r\n  Profoundly skilled in analytic,\r\n  He could distinguish and divide\r\n  A hair 'twixt South and South West side.\r\n\r\nAs to how much of the formidable anti-slavery sentiment of that day had\r\nbeen created by the Abolitionists, we have this opinion of a\r\ndistinguished English traveller and observer. Mr. L. W. A. Johnston was\r\nin Washington, in 1850, studying America. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Extreme men like Garrison seldom have justice done to them. It is true\r\nthey may be impracticable, both as to their measures and their men, but\r\nthat unmixed evil is the result of their exertions, all history of\r\nopinion in every country, I think, contradicts. Such ultra men are as\r\nnecessary as the more moderate and reasonable advocates of any growing\r\nopinion; and, as _an impartial person_, who never happened to fall in\r\nwith one of the party in the course of my tour, I must express my belief\r\nthat the present wide diffusion of anti-slavery sentiment in the United\r\nStates is, in no small degree, owing to their exertions.\"[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] \"Notes on North America,\" London, 1851, vol. II, p. 486.\r\n\r\nAnd Professor Smith, of Williams College, speaking of the anti-slavery\r\nfeeling in the North in 1850, says:\r\n\r\n\"This sentiment of the free States regarding slavery was to a large\r\ndegree the result of an agitation for its abolition which had been\r\nactive for a score of years (1831-1850) without any positive\r\nresults.\"[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] \"Parties and Slavery,\" Smith, pp. 3, 4.\r\n\r\nBut no matter what had produced it, the anti-slavery sentiment that\r\npervaded the North in 1850 boded ill to slavery and to the Constitution,\r\nand the South was bitterly complaining. Congress met in December, 1849,\r\nand was to sit until October, 1850. Lovers of the Union, North and\r\nSouth, watched its proceedings with the deepest anxiety. The South was\r\nmuch excited. The continual torrent of abuse to which it was subjected,\r\nthe refusal to allow slavery in States to be created from territory in\r\nthe South-west that was below the parallel of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nand the complete nullification of the fugitive slave law, seemed to many\r\nto be no longer tolerable, and from sundry sources in that section came\r\nthreats of secession.\r\n\r\nIn 1849-50 the South was demanding a division of California, an\r\nefficient fugitive slave law, and that the territories of New Mexico and\r\nArizona should be organized with no restrictions as to slavery. Other\r\nminor demands were unimportant.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay, Daniel Webster, Stephen A. Douglas, Lewis Cass, and other\r\nconservative leaders came forward and, after long and heated debates in\r\nCongress, the Compromise of 1850 was agreed on. To satisfy the North,\r\nCalifornia, as a whole, came in as a free State, and the slave trade was\r\nabolished in the District of Columbia. To satisfy the South, a new and\r\nstringent fugitive slave law was agreed on, and the territories of New\r\nMexico and Arizona were organized with no restrictions as to slavery.\r\n\r\nIn bringing about this compromise, Daniel Webster was, next to Clay, the\r\nmost conspicuous figure. He was the favorite son of New England and the\r\ngreatest statesman in all the North. On the 7th of March, 1850, Mr.\r\nWebster made one of the greatest speeches of his life on the Compromise\r\nmeasures. Rising above the sectional prejudices of the hour, he spoke\r\nfor the Constitution and the Union. The manner in which he and his\r\nreputation were treated by popular historians in the North, for half a\r\ncentury afterward, on account of this speech, is the most pathetic and,\r\nat the same time, the most instructive story in the whole history of the\r\nanti-slavery crusade.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was under the ban of Northern public opinion for all this\r\nhalf a century, not because of inconsistency between that speech and his\r\nformer avowals, an averment often made and never proven, but because he\r\nwas consistent. He stood squarely upon his record, and the venom of the\r\nassaults that were afterward made upon him was just in proportion to the\r\nlove and veneration which had been his before he offended. His offence\r\nwas that he would not move with the anti-slavery movement.[42] He did\r\nnot stand with his section in a sectional dispute.\r\n\r\n  [42] McMaster says: \"The great statesman was behind the\r\n  times.\"--\"Webster,\" p. 19.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay, old and feeble, had come back into the Senate to render his\r\nlast service to his country. He was the author of the Compromise. Daniel\r\nWebster was everywhere known as the champion of the Union. Henry Clay\r\nwas known as the \"Old Man Eloquent,\" and he now spoke with all his\r\nold-time fire; but Webster's great speech probably had more influence on\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up Mr. Webster's speech his previous attitude toward\r\nslavery must be noted. The purpose of the friends of the Union was, of\r\ncourse, to effect a compromise that would, if possible, put an end to\r\nsectional strife. Compromise means concession, and a compromise of\r\npolitical differences, made by statesmen, may involve some concession of\r\nview previously held by those who advocate as well as by those who\r\naccept it. Webster thought his section of the Union should now make\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nFanaticism, however, concedes nothing; it never compromises, although\r\nstatesmanship does. One of the most notable utterances of Edmund Burke\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n\"_All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue\r\nand every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter._\"\r\n\r\nGreat statesmen, on great occasions, speak not only to their countrymen\r\nand for the time being, but they speak to all mankind and for all time.\r\nSo spoke Burke in that famous sentence when advocating, in the British\r\nParliament in 1776, \"conciliation with America\"; and so did Daniel\r\nWebster speak, in the Senate of the United States, on the 7th of March,\r\n1850, for \"the Constitution and the Union.\" If George III and Lord North\r\nhad heeded Burke, and if the British government and people, from that\r\nday forth, had followed the wise counsels given in that speech by their\r\ngreatest statesman, all the English-speaking peoples of the world, now\r\nnumbering over 170,000,000, might have been to-day under one government,\r\nthat government commanding the peace of the world. And if all the people\r\nof the United States in 1850 and from that time on, had heeded the words\r\nof Daniel Webster, we should have been spared the bloodiest war in the\r\nbook of time; every State of the Union would have been left free to\r\nsolve its own domestic problems, and it is not too much to say that\r\nthese problems would have been solved in full accord with the advancing\r\ncivilization of the age.\r\n\r\nThe sole charge of inconsistency against Webster that has in it a shadow\r\nof truth relates to the proposition he made in his speech as to the\r\n\"Wilmot proviso.\" That celebrated proviso was named for David Wilmot, of\r\nPennsylvania, its author. It provided against slavery in all the\r\nterritory acquired from Mexico. The South had opposed the Wilmot proviso\r\nbecause the territory in question, much of it, was south of the Missouri\r\nCompromise line extended. Mr. Webster had often voted for the Wilmot\r\nproviso, as all knew. In his speech for the Compromise, by which the\r\nSouth was urged to and did give up its contentions as to the admission\r\nof California, and its contentions as to the slave trade in the District\r\nof Columbia, Webster argued that _the North might forego_ the proviso as\r\nto New Mexico and Arizona for the reason that the proviso was, as to\r\nthese territories, _immaterial_. Those territories, he argued, would\r\nnever come in as slave States, because the God of nature had so\r\ndetermined. Climate and soil would forbid. Time vindicated this\r\nargument. In 1861 Charles Francis Adams said, in Congress, that New\r\nMexico, open to slave-holders and their slaves for more than ten years,\r\nthen had only twelve slaves domiciled on the surface of over 200,000\r\nsquare miles of her extent.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] \"Vindication of Webster,\" William C. Wilkinson, p. 69.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster's services to the cause of the Union, the preservation of\r\nwhich had been the passion of his life, had been absolutely\r\nunparalleled. It is perhaps true that without him Abraham Lincoln and\r\nthe armies of the Union in 1861-65 would have been impossible. The sole\r\nand, as he then stated and as time proved, immaterial concession this\r\nchampion of the Union now (1850) made for the sake of preserving the\r\nUnion was his proposition as to New Mexico and Arizona.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay spoke before Webster. These words were the key-note of Clay's\r\ngreat speech: \"In my opinion the body politic cannot be preserved unless\r\nthis agitation, this distraction, this exasperation, which is going on\r\nbetween the two sections of the country, shall cease.\"\r\n\r\nThe country waited with anxiety to hear from Webster. Hundreds of\r\nsuggestions and appeals went to him. Both sides were hopeful.[44]\r\nAnti-slavery people knew his aversion to slavery. He had never\r\ncountenanced anti-slavery agitation, but he had voted for the Wilmot\r\nproviso. They knew, too, that he had long been ambitious to be\r\nPresident, and, carried away by their enthusiasm, they hoped that\r\nWebster would swim along with the tide that was sweeping over the\r\nmajority section of the Union. In view of Mr. Webster's past record,\r\nhowever, it would be difficult to believe that Abolitionists were really\r\ndisappointed in him had we not many such proofs as the following stanza\r\nfrom Whittier's ode, published after the speech:\r\n\r\n  Oh! dumb be passing, stormy rage\r\n    When he who might\r\n  Have lighted up and led his age\r\n    Falls back in night!\r\n\r\n  [44] McMaster's \"Webster.\"\r\n\r\nThe conservatives also were hopeful. They knew that, though Webster had\r\nalways been, as an individual, opposed to slavery, he had at all times\r\nstood by the Constitution, as well as the Union. At no time had he ever\r\nqualified or retracted these words in his speech at Niblo's Garden in\r\n1839: \"Slavery, as it exists in the States, is beyond the reach of\r\nCongress. It is a concern of the States themselves. They have never\r\nsubmitted it to Congress, and Congress has no rightful power over it. I\r\nshall concur therefore in _no act_, _no measure_, _no menace_, no\r\nindication of purpose which _shall interfere or threaten to interfere\r\nwith the exclusive authority_ of the several States over the subject of\r\nslavery, as it exists within their respective limits. All this appears\r\nto me to be matter of plain imperative duty.\"\r\n\r\nNullifying the fugitive slave law was a plain \"interference\" with the\r\nrights of the slave States.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's intent, when he spoke on the Compromise measures, is best\r\nexplained by his own words, on June 17, while these measures were still\r\npending: \"Sir, my object is peace. My object is reconciliation. My\r\npurpose is not to make up a case _for the North_ or a case _for the\r\nSouth_. My object is not to continue useless and irritating\r\ncontroversies. I am against agitators, North and South, and all narrow\r\nlocal contests. I am an American, and I know no locality but America.\"\r\n\r\nIn his speech made on the 7th of March he dwelt at length on existing\r\nconditions, on the attitude of the North toward the fugitive slave law,\r\nand argued fully the questions involved in the \"personal liberty\" laws\r\npassed by Northern States. Referring to the complaints of the South\r\nabout these, he said: \"In that respect _the South, in my judgment, is\r\nright and the North is wrong_. Every member of every Northern\r\nlegislature is bound by oath, like every other officer in the country,\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States; and the article of the\r\nConstitution which says to these States that they shall deliver up\r\nfugitives from service _is as binding in honor and conscience as any\r\nother article_. _No man fulfils his duty in any legislature who sets\r\nhimself to find excuses, evasions, escapes, from this constitutional\r\nobligation._\"\r\n\r\nAnd further on he said: \"Then, sir, there are the Abolition societies,\r\nof which I am unwilling to speak, but in regard to which I have very\r\nclear notions and opinions. I do not think them useful. _I think their\r\noperations for the last twenty years have produced nothing good or\r\nvaluable.... I cannot but see what mischief their interference with the\r\nSouth has produced._\"\r\n\r\nIn these statements is the substance of Webster's offending.\r\n\r\nWebster's speech was followed, on the 11th of March, by the speech of\r\nSenator Seward, of New York, in the same debate. Quoting the fugitive\r\nslave provision of the Federal Constitution, Mr. Seward said: \"This is\r\nfrom the Constitution of the United States in 1787, and the parties were\r\nthe Republican States of the Union. The law of nations _disavows such\r\ncompacts; the law of nature, written on the hearts and consciences of\r\nfreemen, repudiates them_.\"[45] The people of the North, instead of\r\nfollowing Webster, chose to follow Seward, the apostle of a _law higher\r\nthan the Constitution_; and when, ten years later, it appeared to them\r\nthat the whole North had given in its adhesion to the \"higher law\"\r\ndoctrine, the people of eleven Southern States seceded, and put over\r\nthemselves in very substance the Constitution that Seward had flouted\r\nand Webster had pleaded for in vain.\r\n\r\n  [45] _Congressional Globe_, 31st Congress, 1st session, Appendix, p.\r\n  263.\r\n\r\nAnti-slavery enthusiasts in the North generally, and Abolitionists\r\nespecially, in their comments on Webster's speech scouted the idea that\r\nthe preservation of the Union depended upon the faithful execution of\r\nthe fugitive slave law or the cessation of anti-slavery agitation.\r\n\"What,\" said Theodore Parker, \"cast off the North! They set up for\r\nthemselves! Tush! Tush! Fear boys with bugs!... I think Mr. Webster knew\r\nthere was no danger of a dissolution of the Union.\"[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] \"Vindication of Webster,\" William C. Wilkinson, p. 191.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the speech was wonderful; congratulations poured\r\nin upon Mr. Webster from conservative classes in every quarter, and he\r\nmust have felt gratified to know that he had contributed greatly to the\r\nenactment of measures that, for a time, had some effect in allaying\r\nsectional strife. But the revilings of the Abolitionists prevailed, and\r\nit turned out that Daniel Webster, great as he was, had undertaken a\r\ntask that was too much even for him. His enemies struck out boldly at\r\nonce: and years afterward, when the anti-slavery movement that Webster's\r\nappeals could not arrest had culminated in secession, and when the\r\nUnion had been saved by arms, the triumphant hosts of the anti-slavery\r\ncrusade all but succeeded in writing Daniel Webster down permanently in\r\nthe history of his country as an apostate from principle for the sake of\r\nan office he did not get. Here is their verdict, which Mr. Lodge, a\r\nbiographer of Webster, passes on into history:\r\n\r\n\"The _popular verdict_ has been given against the 7th of March speech,\r\n_and that verdict has passed into history_. Nothing can be said or done\r\nwhich will alter the fact that the people of this country, _who\r\nmaintained and saved the Union, have passed judgment on Mr. Webster_,\r\nand condemned what he said on the 7th of March as _wrong in principle\r\nand mistaken in policy_.\"\r\n\r\nHere are specimens of the assaults that were made on Webster after his\r\nspeech. They are selected from among many given by one of his\r\nbiographers.[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] McMaster's \"Webster,\" p. 316 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\"'Webster,' said Horace Mann, 'is a fallen star! Lucifer descended from\r\nHeaven.'... 'Webster,' said Sumner, 'has placed himself in the dark\r\nlist of apostates.' When Whittier named him Ichabod, and mourned for him\r\nin verse as one dead, he did but express the feeling of half New\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\n  'Let not the land once proud of him\r\n      Mourn for him now,\r\n  Nor brand with deeper shame his dim\r\n      Dishonored brow.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Then pay the reverence of old days\r\n      To his dead fame!\r\n  Walk backward with averted gaze\r\n      And hide his shame.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter much more to the same effect, Professor McMaster proceeds: \"The\r\nattack by the press, the _expressions of horror_ that rose from New\r\nEngland, Webster felt keenly, but the absolute isolation in which he was\r\nleft by his New England colleagues cut him to the quick.\"[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] Professor McMaster in the chapter preceding that containing these\r\n  extracts, has collected much evidence to show that Webster aspired to be\r\n  President, and the biographer entitles the chapter, \"Longing for the\r\n  Presidency,\" apparently the author's clod on the grave of a buried\r\n  reputation.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Webster's speech, its purpose and effect, we have this opinion\r\nfrom Mr. Lodge:\r\n\r\n\"The speech, if exactly defined, is in reality a powerful effort, not\r\nfor a compromise, or for the fugitive slave law, or for any other one\r\nthing, _but to arrest the whole anti-slavery movement_, and in that way\r\n_put an end to the danger which threatened the Union and restore harmony\r\nto the jarring sections_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he adds:\r\n\r\n\"_It was a mad project. Mr. Webster might as well have attempted to stay\r\nthe incoming tide at Marshfield with a rampart of sand, as to check the\r\nanti-slavery movement with a speech._\"\r\n\r\nTo undertake at this time to arrest the whole anti-slavery movement by\r\nholding up the Constitution was indeed useless.\r\n\r\nSeward, who had spoken for the \"higher law,\" was riding on the tide of\r\nanti-slavery sentiment that was submerging \"the Sage of Marshfield,\" who\r\nhad stood for the Constitution. Seward's reputation, in the years\r\nfollowing, went steadily up, while Webster's was going down. Webster\r\ndied, in dejection, in 1852.\r\n\r\nSeward, at Rochester, in 1854, later on in the same crusade, made\r\nanother famous declaration--there was an \"irrepressible conflict between\r\nslavery and freedom.\" The conflict was \"irrepressible,\" as Seward well\r\nknew; and this was simply and solely because the anti-slavery crusade\r\ncould not be suppressed. Clay and Webster, now both dead and gone, had\r\ntried it in vain. Every one knew that if, in 1850, or at any other time,\r\nthe anti-slavery hosts had halted, and asked for, or consented to,\r\npeace, they could have had it at once.\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge, in the following paragraph, seems to have almost made up his\r\nmind to defend Webster. He says: \"What most shocked the North were his\r\nutterances in regard to the fugitive slave law. There can be no doubt\r\nthat, _under the Constitution_, the South had a _perfect right_ to claim\r\nthe extradition of fugitive slaves. The legal _argument to support that\r\nright was excellent_.\" This would seem to justify the speech in that\r\nregard. \"But,\" Mr. Lodge adds, \"the Northern people could not feel that\r\nit was _necessary_ for _Daniel Webster_ to make it.\" They wanted him to\r\nbe sectional or to hold his tongue. Then Mr. Lodge goes on to say: \"The\r\nfugitive slave law was in _absolute conflict with the awakened\r\nconscience and moral sentiment of the North_.\"\r\n\r\nThe conscience of _the North_ at that time, Mr. Lodge means, was a\r\n_higher law_ than the _Constitution_; and Webster's \"excellent\r\nargument,\" therefore, fell on deaf ears.\r\n\r\nNo American historian stands higher as an authority than Mr. Rhodes. He\r\nsays on page 161, vol. I, of his \"History of the United States,\"\r\npublished in 1892: \"_Until the closing years of our century a\r\ndispassionate judgment could not be made of Webster_; but we see now\r\nthat in the war of secession his principles were mightier than those of\r\nGarrison. It was not 'No Union with slave-holders,' but _Liberty and\r\nUnion_ that won.\"\r\n\r\nThis tribute to services Webster had rendered to the Union in his great\r\nspeech in 1850, in which he advocated \"Liberty and Union, now and\r\nforever,\" exactly as he was advocating it in 1830, is just. How pathetic\r\nthat the historian was impelled also to record the fact, in the same\r\nsentence, that for nearly half a century partisan prejudice had rendered\r\nit impossible to form a dispassionate judgment of him who had pleaded in\r\nvain for the Union without war!\r\n\r\nAfter an able analysis of his \"7th of March speech,\" and a discussion of\r\nhis record, in which he paralleled Webster and Edmund Burke, Mr. Rhodes\r\ndeclares: \"His dislike of slavery was strong, but his love of the Union\r\nwas stronger, and the more powerful motive outweighed the other, for he\r\nbelieved that _the crusade against slavery had arrived at a point where\r\nits further prosecution was hurtful to the Union_. As has been said of\r\nBurke, 'He changed his front but he never changed his ground.'\"[49]\r\n\r\n  [49] _Ib._, p. 160.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster's name and its place in history may be likened to a giant\r\noak, a monarch of the forest, that, while towering high above all\r\nothers, was stripped of its branches; for a time it stood, a rugged\r\ntrunk, robbed of its glory by a cyclone; but its roots were deep down in\r\nthe rich earth; the storm is passing away; the tree has put out buds\r\nagain; now its branches are stretching out once more into the clear\r\nreaches of the upper air.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes seems to be the first historian of note to do justice to\r\nDaniel Webster and the great speech which, McMaster takes pains to\r\ninform us, historians have written down as his \"7th of March speech,\" in\r\nspite of the fact that Mr. Webster himself entitled it \"The\r\nConstitution and the Union.\"\r\n\r\nOther historians besides Mr. Rhodes have come to the rescue of Webster's\r\nspeech for \"the Constitution and the Union.\" Mr. John Fiske says of it\r\nin a volume (posthumous) published in 1907: \"So far as Mr. Webster's\r\nmoral attitude was concerned, although he was not prepared for the\r\nbitter hostility that his speech provoked in many quarters, he must\r\nnevertheless have known it was quite as likely to injure him at the\r\nNorth as to gain support for him in the South, and his resolute adoption\r\nof a policy that he regarded as national rather than sectional was\r\nreally an instance of high moral courage.\"[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] \"Daniel Webster and the Sentiment of Union,\" John Fiske, \"Essays\r\n  Historical and Literary,\" pp. 408-9.\r\n\r\nMr. William C. Wilkinson has recently written an able \"Vindication of\r\nDaniel Webster,\" and, after a conclusive argument on that branch of his\r\nsubject, he says: \"Webster's consistency stands like a rock on the shore\r\nafter the fretful waves are tired with beating upon it in vain.\"[51]\r\n\r\n  [51] \"Daniel Webster: A Vindication,\" p. 47.\r\n\r\nMr. E. P. Wheeler, concluding a masterly sketch of Daniel Webster,\r\nsetting forth his services as statesman and expounder of the\r\nConstitution, and not deigning to notice the partisan charges against\r\nhim, concludes with these words:\r\n\r\n\"Great men elevate and ennoble their countrymen. In the glory of Webster\r\nwe find the glory of our whole country.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of Daniel Webster and his great speech in 1850 has been told\r\nat some length because it is instructive. The historians who had set\r\nthemselves to the task of upholding the idea that it was the\r\naggressiveness of the South, during the controversy over slavery, and\r\nnot that of the North, that brought on secession and war, could not make\r\ngood their contention while Daniel Webster and his speech for \"the\r\nConstitution and the Union\" stood in their way. They, therefore, wrote\r\nthe great statesman \"down and out,\" as they conceived. But Webster and\r\nthat speech still stand as beacon lights in the history of that crusade.\r\nThe attack came from the North. The South, standing for its\r\nconstitutional rights in the Union, was the conservative party.\r\nSouthern leaders, it is true, were, during the controversy over\r\nslavery, often aggressive, but they were on the defensive-aggressive,\r\njust as Lee was when he made his campaign into Pennsylvania for the\r\npurpose of stopping the invasion of his own land; and the South lost in\r\nher political campaign just for the same reason that Lee lost in his\r\nGettysburg campaign: numbers and resources were against her. \"The stars\r\nin their courses fought against Sisera.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster in his great speech for \"the Constitution and the Union,\" as\r\nbecame a great statesman pleading for conciliation, measured the terms\r\nin which he condemned \"personal liberty\" laws and Abolitionism. But\r\nafterward, irritated by the attacks made upon him, he naturally spoke\r\nout more emphatically. McMaster quotes several expressions from his\r\nspeeches and letters replying to these assaults, and says: \"His hatred\r\nof Abolitionists and Free-soilers grew stronger and stronger. To him\r\nthese men were a 'band of sectionalists, narrow of mind, wanting in\r\npatriotism, without a spark of national feeling, and quite ready to see\r\nthe Union go to pieces if their own selfish ends were gained.'\" Such,\r\nif this is a fair summing up of his views, was Webster's final opinion\r\nof those who were carrying on the great anti-slavery crusade.[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] McMaster's \"Webster,\" p. 340.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEFFORTS FOR PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desire for peace in 1850 was wide-spread. Union loving people, North\r\nand South, hoped that the Compromise would result in a cessation of the\r\nstrife that had so long divided the section; and the election of\r\nFranklin Pierce, in 1852, as President, on a platform strongly approving\r\nthat Compromise, was promising. But anti-slavery leaders, instead of\r\nbeing convinced by such arguments as those of Webster, were deeply\r\noffended by the contention that legislators, in passing personal liberty\r\nlaws, had violated their oaths to support the Constitution. They were\r\nangered also by the presumptuous attempt to \"arrest the whole\r\nanti-slavery movement.\"\r\n\r\nThe new fugitive slave law was stringent; it did not give jury trial; it\r\nrequired bystanders to assist the officers in \"slave-catching,\" etc. For\r\nthese and other reasons the law was assailed as unconstitutional. All\r\nthese contentions were overruled by the Supreme Court when a case\r\neventually came before it. The court decided that the act was, in all\r\nits provisions, fully authorized by the Constitution.[53] But in their\r\npresent mood, no law that was efficient would have been satisfactory to\r\nthe multitudes of people, by no means all \"Abolitionists,\" who had\r\nalready made up their minds against the \"wicked\" provision of the\r\nConstitution that required the delivery of fugitive slaves. This\r\ndeep-seated feeling of opposition to the return to their masters of\r\nescaping slaves was soon to be wrought up to a high pitch by a novel\r\nthat went into nearly every household throughout the North--\"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin.\" On its appearance the poet Whittier, who had so ferociously\r\nattacked Webster in the verses quoted in the last chapter, \"offered up\r\nthanks for the fugitive slave law, for it gave us 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'\"\r\n\r\n  [53] Ableman _v._ Boothe, 21 How., 506.\r\n\r\nRufus Choate, a celebrated lawyer and Whig leader, is reported to have\r\nsaid of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\": \"That book will make two millions of\r\nAbolitionists.\" Drawing, as it did, a very dark picture of slavery, it\r\naroused sympathy for the escaping slave and pictured in glowing colors\r\nthe dear, sweet men and women who dared, for his sake, the perils of the\r\nroad in the darkness of night and all the dangers of the law. Mrs. Stowe\r\nwas _making heroes of law-breakers, preaching the higher law_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe declared she had not written the book for political effect;\r\nshe certainly did not anticipate the marvellous results that followed\r\nit. That book made vast multitudes of its readers ready for the new\r\nsectional and anti-slavery party that was to be organized two years\r\nafter its appearance. It was the most famous and successful novel ever\r\nwritten. It was translated into every language that has a literature,\r\nand has been more read by American people than any other book except the\r\nBible. As a picture of what was conceivable under the laws relating to\r\nslavery there was a basis for it. Though there were laws limiting the\r\nmaster's power, cruelty was nevertheless possible.\r\n\r\nHere, then, Mrs. Stowe's imagination had full scope. Her book, however,\r\nhas in it none of the strident harshness, none of the purblind ferocity\r\nof Garrison, in whose eyes every slave-holder was a fiend. \"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin\" assailed a system; it did not assault personally, as the\r\narch-agitator did, every man and woman to whom slaves had come, whether\r\nby choice or chance. Light and shadow and the play of human nature made\r\nMrs. Stowe's picture as attractive in many of its pages as it was\r\nrepulsive and unfair in others. Mrs. Shelby was a type of many a noble\r\nmistress, a Christian woman, and when financial misfortunes compelled\r\nthe sale of the Shelby slaves and the separation of families, we have\r\nnot only what might have been, but what sometimes was, one of the evils\r\nof slavery, which, by reason of the prevailing agitation, the humanity\r\nof the age could not remedy. But Mrs. Stowe's slave-master, Legree, was\r\nimpossible. The theory was inconceivable that it was cheaper to work to\r\ndeath in seven years a slave costing a thousand dollars, than to work\r\nhim for forty years. Millions of our people, however, have accepted\r\n\"Uncle Tom\" as a fact, and have wept over him; they have accepted also\r\nas a fact the monster Legree.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" lives to-day as a classic on book shelves and as a\r\npopular play. The present generation get most of their opinions about\r\nslavery as it was in the South from its pages, and not one in ten\r\nthousand of those who read it ever thinks of the inconsistency between\r\nthe picture of slavery drawn there and that other picture, which all the\r\nworld now knows of--the Confederate soldier away in the army, his wife\r\nand children at home faithfully protected by slaves--not a case of\r\nviolence, not even a single established case, during four years,\r\nalthough there were four millions of negroes in the South, of that crime\r\nagainst white women that, after the reconstruction had demoralized the\r\nfreedmen, became so common in that section.\r\n\r\nThe unwavering fidelity during the four years of war of so many slaves\r\nto the families of their absent masters, and the fact that those who,\r\nduring that war, left their homes to seek their freedom invariably went\r\nwithout doing any vengeful act, is a phenomenon that speaks for itself.\r\nIt tells of kindly relations between master and slave. It is not to be\r\ndenied that where the law gave so much power to the master there were\r\nindividual instances of cruelty, nor is it supposable that there were\r\nnot many slaves who were revengeful; but at the same time there was,\r\nquite naturally, among slaves who were all in like case, a more clannish\r\nand all-pervading public opinion than could have been found elsewhere.\r\nIt was that all-pervading and rigid standard of kindly feeling among the\r\nslaves to their masters that made the rule universal--fidelity toward\r\nthe master's family, at least to the extent of inflicting no injury.\r\n\r\nWhat a surprise to many this conduct of the slave was may be gathered\r\nfrom a telling Republican speech made by Carl Schurz during the campaign\r\nof 1860.[54] A devotee of liberty, recently a revolutionist in his\r\nnative land, and, like other foreigners, disregarding all constitutional\r\nobstacles, Mr. Schurz had naturally espoused the cause of anti-slavery\r\nin this country. He had absorbed the views of his political associates\r\nand now contended that secession was an empty threat and that secession\r\nwas impossible. \"The mere anticipation of a negro insurrection,\" he\r\nsaid, \"will paralyze the whole South.\" And, after ridiculing the alarm\r\ncreated by the John Brown invasion, the orator said that in case of a\r\nwar between the South and the North, \"they will not have men enough to\r\nquiet their friends at home; what will they have to oppose to the enemy?\r\nEvery township will want its home regiment; every plantation its\r\ngarrison; and what will be left for its field army?\"\r\n\r\n  [54] Fite, \"Presidential Campaign of 1860,\" p. 243.\r\n\r\nSlavery in the South eventually proved to be, instead of a weakness, an\r\nelement of strength to the Confederates, and Mr. Lincoln finally felt\r\nhimself compelled to issue his proclamation of emancipation as a\r\nmilitary necessity--the avowed purpose being to deprive the Confederates\r\nof the slaves who were by their labor supporting their armies in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe faithfulness during the war of the slave to his master has been a\r\nlesson to the Northerner, and it has been a lesson, too, to the\r\nSoutherner. It argues that the danger of bloody insurrections was\r\nperhaps not as great as had been apprehended where incendiary\r\npublications were sent among them. That danger, however, did exist, and\r\nif the fear of it was exaggerated, it was nevertheless real, and was\r\ntraceable to the Abolitionists.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the South in the territories had now been discussed for\r\nyears and Stephen A. Douglas, a Democratic senator from Illinois, had\r\nreached the conclusion that under the Constitution Southerner and\r\nNortherner had exactly the same right to carry their property, whatever\r\nit might be, into the territories, which had been purchased with the\r\ncommon blood and treasure of both sections, a view afterward sustained\r\nby the Supreme Court of the United States in the Dred Scott case.\r\nDouglas, \"entirely of his own motion,\"[55] introduced, and Congress\r\npassed, such a bill--the Kansas-Nebraska act. The new act replaced the\r\nMissouri Compromise. This the Southerners considered had been a dead\r\nletter for years. Every \"personal liberty\" law passed by a Northern\r\nState was a violation of it.\r\n\r\n  [55] \"Parties and Slavery,\" Theodore Clarke Smith, professor of history\r\n  in Williams College, p. 96.\r\n\r\nAmbition was now playing its part in the sectional controversy. Douglas\r\nwas a Democrat looking to the presidency and had here made a bid for\r\nSouthern support. On the other hand was Seward, an \"old line Whig,\"\r\naspiring to the same office. The South had been the dominant element in\r\nnational politics and the North was getting tired of it. Seward's idea\r\nwas to organize all the anti-slavery voters and to appeal at the same\r\ntime to the pride and jealousy of the North as a section.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the Kansas-Nebraska act was to aggravate\r\nsectionalism. It opened up the territory of Kansas, allowing it to come\r\ninto the Union with or without slavery, as it might choose. Slave State\r\nand free State adventurers rushed into the new territory and struggled,\r\nand even fought, for supremacy. The Southerners lost. Their resources\r\ncould not match the means of organized anti-slavery societies, and the\r\nresult was an increase, North and South, of sectional animosity.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming defeat of the old Whig party in 1852 presaged its\r\ndissolution. Until that election, both the Whig and Democratic parties\r\nhad been national, each endeavoring to hold and acquire strength, North\r\nand South, and each combating, as best it could, the spirit of\r\nsectionalism that had been steadily growing in the North, and South as\r\nwell, ever since the rise of Abolitionism. Both these old parties had\r\nwatched with anxiety the increase of anti-slavery sentiment in the\r\nNorth. Both parties feared it. Alliance with the anti-slavery North\r\nwould deprive a party of support South and denationalize it. For years\r\nprior to 1852 the drift of Northern voters who were opposed to slavery\r\nhad been as to the two national parties toward the Whigs, and the\r\ntendency of conservative Northerners had been toward the Democratic\r\nparty. Thus the great body of the Whig voters in the North had become\r\nimbued with anti-slavery sentiments, and now, with no hope of victory as\r\na national party and left in a hopeless minority, the majority of that\r\nold party in that section were ready to join a sectional party when it\r\nshould be formed two years later. William H. Seward was still a Whig\r\nwhen he made in the United States Senate his anti-slavery \"higher law\"\r\nspeech of 1850.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas-Nebraska act was a political blunder. The South, on any\r\ndispassionate consideration, could not have expected to make Kansas a\r\nslave State. The act was a blunder, too, because it gave the opponents\r\nof the Democratic party a plausible pretext for the contention, which\r\nthey put forth then and which has been persisted in till this day, that\r\nthe new Republican party, immediately thereafter organized, was called\r\ninto existence by, and only by, the Kansas-Nebraska act.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1850 it was clear that a new party, based on the\r\nanti-slavery sentiment that had been created by twenty years of\r\nagitation, was inevitable. Mr. Rhodes, speaking of conditions then,\r\nsays: \"It was, moreover, obvious to an astute politician like Seward,\r\nand probably to others, that a dissolution of parties was imminent; that\r\nto oppose the extension of slavery, _the different anti-slavery elements\r\nmust be organized as a whole_; it might be called Whig or some other\r\nname, but it would be based on the principle of the Wilmot\r\nproviso\"[56]--the meaning of which was, no more slave States.\r\n\r\n  [56] \"Rhodes,\" vol. I, p. 192.\r\n\r\nBetween 1850 and the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska act in 1854, new\r\nimpulse had been given anti-slavery sentiment by fierce assaults on the\r\nnew fugitive slave law and, as has been seen, by \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"\r\nThe Kansas-Nebraska act did serve as a cry for the rallying of all\r\nanti-slavery voters. That was all. It was a drum-call, in answer to\r\nwhich soldiers already enlisted fell into ranks, under a new banner. Any\r\nother drum-call--the application of another slave State for admission\r\ninto the Union--would have served quite as well. Thus the Republican\r\nparty came into existence in 1854. Mr. Rhodes sums up the reason for the\r\nexistence of the new party and what it subsequently accomplished in the\r\nfollowing pregnant sentence, \"The moral agitation had accomplished its\r\nwork, the cause (of anti-slavery) ... was to be consigned to a political\r\nparty that brought to a successful conclusion the movement begun by the\r\nmoral sentiment of the community,\"[57]--which successful conclusion was,\r\nof course, _the freeing of the slaves by a successful war_.\r\n\r\n  [57] Vol. I, p. 66.\r\n\r\nFor a time the new Republican party had a powerful competitor in another\r\nnew organization. This was the American or Know-Nothing party. This\r\nother aspirant for power made an honest effort to revitalize the old\r\nWhig party under a new name and, by gathering in all the conservatives\r\nNorth and South, to put an end to sectionalism. Its signal failure\r\nconveys an instructive lesson. After many and wide-spread rumors of its\r\ncoming, the birth of the American party was formally announced in 1854.\r\nIt had been organized in secret and was bound together with oaths and\r\npasswords; its members delighted to mystify inquirers by refusing to\r\nanswer questions, and soon they got the name of \"Know-Nothings.\" The\r\nparty had grown out of the \"Order of the Star Spangled Banner,\"\r\norganized in 1850 to oppose the spread of Catholicism and indiscriminate\r\nimmigration--the two dangers that were said to threaten American\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe American party made its appeal: For the Union and against\r\nsectionalism; for Protestantism, the faith of the Fathers, against\r\nCatholicism that was being imported by foreigners; its shibboleth was\r\n\"America for the Americans.\"\r\n\r\nThe Americans or Know-Nothings everywhere put out in 1854 full tickets\r\nand showed at once surprising strength. In the fall elections of that\r\nyear they polled over one-fourth of all the votes in New York,\r\ntwo-fifths in Pennsylvania, and over two-thirds in Massachusetts, where\r\nthey made a clean sweep of the State and Federal offices.[58]\r\n\r\n  [58] Smith, \"Parties and Slavery,\" pp. 118-20.\r\n\r\nThey struck directly at sectionalism by exacting of their adherents the\r\nfollowing oath:\r\n\r\n\"You do further swear that you will not vote for any one ... whom you\r\nknow or believe to be in favor of a dissolution of the Union ... or who\r\nis endeavoring to produce that result.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this oath at the South was almost magical. The Whig party\r\nthere was speedily absorbed by the Americans, and Southern Democrats by\r\nthousands joined the new party that promised to save the Union.[59] But\r\nthe attitude of the Northern and Southern members of the American party\r\nsoon became fundamentally different. Southerners saw their Northern\r\nallies in Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts passing \"personal liberty\"\r\nlaws.[60]\r\n\r\n  [59] The writer's father, who had been a nullifier and a lifelong\r\n  follower of Calhoun, joined the Know-Nothings in the hope of saving the\r\n  Union, but withdrew when he found that in the North the party was not\r\n  true to its Union pledges. Here was a typical case of Southern\r\n  unwillingness to resort to secession.\r\n\r\n  [60] _Ib._, pp. 138-9.\r\n\r\nThe Know-Nothings were strong enough in the elections of 1855 to\r\ndirectly check the progress of the new Republican party; but the\r\nAmerican party, though it succeeded in electing a Speaker of the\r\nnational House of Representatives in February, 1856, soon afterward went\r\ndown to defeat. Even though led by such patriots as John Bell, of\r\nTennessee, and Edward Everett, of Massachusetts, it could not stand\r\nagainst the storm of passion that had been aroused by the crusade\r\nagainst slavery.\r\n\r\nThere was a fierce and protracted struggle between the pro-slavery and\r\nanti-slavery men in Kansas for possession of the territorial government.\r\nRival constitutions were submitted to Congress, and the debates over\r\nthese were extremely bitter. In their excitement the Democrats again\r\ndelighted their adversaries by committing what now seems to have been\r\nanother blunder. They advocated the admission of Kansas under the\r\n\"Lecompton Constitution.\" A review of the conflicting evidence appears\r\nto show that the Southerners were fairly outnumbered in Kansas and that\r\nthe Lecompton Constitution did not express the will of the people.[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] Theodore Clarke Smith, \"Parties and Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nWhile \"the war in Kansas\" was going on, Charles Sumner, an Abolitionist\r\nfrom Massachusetts, delivered in the Senate a speech of which he wrote\r\nhis friends beforehand: \"I shall pronounce the most thorough Philippic\r\never delivered in a legislative body.\" He was a classical scholar. _His\r\npurpose was to stir up in the North a greater fury against the South\r\nthan Demosthenes had aroused in Athens against its enemies, the\r\nMacedonians._ His speech occupied two days, May 28 and 29, 1855. At its\r\nconclusion, Senator Cass, of Michigan, arose at once and pronounced it\r\n\"the most un-American and unpatriotic that ever grated on the ears of\r\nthis high body.\" The speech attacked, without any sufficient excuse, the\r\npersonal character of an absent senator, Butler of South Carolina, a\r\ngentleman of high character and older than Sumner. Among other\r\nunfounded charges, it accused him of falsehood. Preston Brooks, a\r\nrepresentative from South Carolina, attacked Sumner in the Senate\r\nchamber during a recess of that body and beat him unmercifully with a\r\ncane. The provocation was bitter, indeed, but Brooks's assault was\r\nunjustifiable. Nevertheless, the exasperated South applauded it, while\r\nthe North glorified Sumner as a martyr for free speech.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn less than two years the new Republican party had absorbed all the\r\nAbolition voters, and in the election of 1856 was in the field with its\r\ncandidates for the presidency and vice-presidency--Fremont and\r\nDayton--upon a platform declaring it the duty of Congress to abolish in\r\nthe territories \"those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\"\r\n\r\nExcitement during that election was intense. Rufus Choate, the great\r\nMassachusetts lawyer, theretofore a Whig, voiced the sentiment of\r\nconservatives when he said it was the \"duty of every one to prevent the\r\nmadness of the times from working its maddest act--the permanent\r\nformation and the actual present triumph of a party which knows one-half\r\nof America only to hate it,\" etc.\r\n\r\nSenator Toombs, of Georgia, said: \"The object of Fremont's friends is\r\nthe conquest of the South. I am content that they shall own us when they\r\nconquer us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democrats elected Buchanan; Democrats 174 electoral votes;\r\nRepublicans 74, all Northern; and the Know-Nothings, combined with a\r\nremnant of Whigs, 8.\r\n\r\nThe work of sectionalism was nearly completed.\r\n\r\nThe extremes to which some of the Southern people now resorted show the\r\nmadness of the times. They encouraged filibustering expeditions to\r\ncapture Cuba and Nicaragua. These wild ventures were absolutely\r\nindefensible. They had no official sanction and were only spontaneous\r\nmovements, but they met with favor from the Southern public, the\r\noutgrowth of a feeling that, if these countries should be captured and\r\nannexed as slave States, the South could the better, by their aid,\r\ndefend its rights in the Union. _The Wanderer_ and one or two other\r\nvessels, contrary to the laws of the United States, imported slaves\r\nfrom Africa, and when the participants were, some of them, indicted,\r\nSouthern juries absolutely refused to convict.\r\n\r\n  \"Judgment had fled to brutish beasts,\r\n    And men had lost their reason.\"\r\n\r\nWhen later the Southern States had seceded and formed a government of\r\ntheir own their constitution absolutely prohibited the slave traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nINCOMPATIBILITY OF SLAVERY AND FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it was possible for slave States and free States to coexist under\r\nour Federal Constitution was the belief of its framers and of most of\r\nour people down to 1861. The first to announce the absolute\r\nimpossibility of such coexistence seems to have been William Lloyd\r\nGarrison. In 1840, at Lynn, Massachusetts, the Essex County Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety adopted this resolution, offered by him:\r\n\r\n\"That freedom and slavery are natural and irreconcilable enemies; that\r\nit is morally impossible for them to endure together in the same nation,\r\nand that the existence of the one can only be secured by the destruction\r\nof the other.\"[62]\r\n\r\n  [62] Garrison's \"Garrison.\"\r\n\r\nGarrison's remedy was disunion. Near that time his paper's motto was \"No\r\nUnion with Slave-Holders.\"\r\n\r\nThe next to announce the idea of the incompatibility of slave States and\r\nfree States seems to have been one who did not dream of disunion. No\r\nsuch thought was in the mind of Abraham Lincoln when, in a speech at\r\nSpringfield, Illinois, June 15, 1858, he said:\r\n\r\n\"_A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the\r\nUnion to be divided. It will become one thing or the other._ Either the\r\nopponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it\r\nwhere the public mind will rest in the belief that _it is in the course\r\nof ultimate extinction_; or its advocates will push it forward until it\r\nshall become alike lawful in all the States--old as well as new--North\r\nas well as South.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Southerners read that statement they concluded that, as Mr.\r\nLincoln knew very well that the South could not, if it would, force\r\nslavery on the North, he was announcing the intention of his party to\r\nplace slavery \"in course of ultimate extinction,\" constitution or no\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nSenator Seward, at Rochester, New York, some weeks later, reannounced\r\nthe doctrine, declaring that the contest was \"an irrepressible conflict\r\nbetween opposing and enduring forces; and it means that the United\r\nStates _must and will_, sooner or later, become either an entirely\r\nslave-holding nation or entirely a free labor nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe utterances of Lincoln and Seward were distinctly radical. The\r\nquestion was, would this radical idea ultimately dominate the Republican\r\nparty?\r\n\r\nLess than eighteen months after the announcement in 1858 of the doctrine\r\nof the \"irrepressible conflict,\" John Brown raided Virginia to incite\r\ninsurrections. With a few followers and 1,300 stands of arms for the\r\nslaves who were to join him, he captured the United States arsenal at\r\nHarper's Ferry. Only a few slaves came to him and, after a brief\r\nstruggle, with some bloodshed, Brown was captured, tried by a jury, and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\nIn the South the excitement was intense; the horror and indignation in\r\nthat section it is impossible to describe. Brown was already well known\r\nto the public. He was not a lunatic. Not long before this, in Kansas,\r\n\"at the head of a small group of men, including two of his sons and a\r\nson-in-law, he went at night down Pottowattamie Creek, stopping at three\r\nhouses. The men who lived in them were well known pro-slavery men; they\r\nseem to have been rough characters; their most specific offence\r\n(according to Sanborn, Brown's biographer and eulogist) was the driving\r\nfrom his home, by violent threats, of an inoffensive old man. John Brown\r\nand his party went down the creek, called at one after the other of\r\nthree houses, took five men away from their wives and children, and\r\ndeliberately shot one and hacked the others to death with swords.\"[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] \"The Negro and the Nation,\" George Spring Merriam, p. 120.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of people, some of them men of eminence in the North,\r\naided Brown in his enterprise. Among the men of repute were Gerrit\r\nSmith, a former candidate for the presidency; and Theodore Parker, Dr.\r\nHowe, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson, of Boston, who were all members of\r\na \"secret committee to collect money and arms for the expedition.\" With\r\nthem was F. S. Sanborn, who has since the war vauntingly revealed the\r\nscheme in his \"Life of John Brown.\"[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] Sanborn's \"Life of John Brown,\" p. 466.\r\n\r\nSanborn intimates that Henry Wilson, subsequently vice-president, was\r\nmore or less privy to the design.[65] At various places in the North\r\nchurch bells were tolled on the day of John Brown's execution; meetings\r\nwere held and orators extolled him as a martyr. Emerson, the greatest\r\nthinker in all that region, declared that if John Brown was hanged he\r\nwould glorify the gallows as Jesus glorified the cross; and now many\r\nSouthern men who loved the Union reluctantly concluded that separation\r\nwas inevitable. John Bell, of Tennessee, Union candidate for President\r\nin 1860, is said to have cried like a child when he heard of Brown's\r\nraid.\r\n\r\n  [65] _Ib._, p. 515.\r\n\r\nThe great body of the Northern people condemned John Brown's expedition\r\nwithout stint. Edward Everett, voicing the opinion of all who were\r\nreally conservative, said of Brown's raid, in a speech at Faneuil Hall,\r\nthat its design was to \"let loose the hell hounds of a servile\r\ninsurrection, and to bring on a struggle which, for magnitude,\r\natrocity, and horror, would have stood alone in the history of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nBut they who had been preaching the \"irrepressible conflict,\" they whom\r\npublic opinion might hold responsible, did not feel precisely as Mr.\r\nEverett did. They were concerned about political consequences, as\r\nappears from a letter written somewhat later during the State canvass in\r\nNew York by Horace Greeley to Schuyler Colfax. Horace Greeley afterward\r\nproved himself in many ways a broad-minded, magnanimous man, but now he\r\nwrote: \"Do not be downhearted about the old John Brown business. Its\r\npresent effect is bad and throws a heavy load on us in this State ...\r\n_but the ultimate effect is to be good.... It will drive the slave power\r\nto new outrages.... It presses on the irrepressible conflict_.\"[66]\r\n\r\n  [66] \"History of United States,\" Rhodes, vol. I.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such a man as Horace Greeley was taking comfort because\r\nthat outrage would \"drive the slave power to new outrages\"[67] throws a\r\nstrong side-light on the tactics of the anti-slavery leaders. They were\r\nfollowing Garrison. Garrison, the father of the Abolitionists, had\r\nbegun his campaign against slave-holders by \"exhausting upon them the\r\nvocabulary of abuse,\" and he had shown \"a genius for infuriating his\r\nantagonists.\"[68] The new party--his successor and beneficiary, was now\r\nfelicitating itself that ultimate good would come, even from the John\r\nBrown raid. It would further their policy of \"_driving the slave power\r\nto new outrages_.\"\r\n\r\n  [67] Channing.\r\n\r\n  [68] Hart.\r\n\r\nPeople at the North, conservatives and all, held their breath for a time\r\nafter Harper's Ferry. Then the crusade went on, in the press, on the\r\nrostrum, and from the pulpit, with as much virulence as ever. No\r\nassertion was too extravagant for belief, provided only its tendency was\r\nto disparage the Southern white man or win sympathy for the negro. From\r\nthe noted \"Brownlow and Pryne's Debate,\" Philadelphia (_Lippincott_), we\r\ntake the following as a specimen of the abuse a portion of the Northern\r\npress was then heaping on the Southern people. Brownlow quotes from the\r\n_New York Independent_ of November, 1856:\r\n\r\n\"The mass of the population of the Atlantic Coast of the slave region\r\nof the South are descended from the transported convicts and outcasts of\r\nGreat Britain.... Oh, glorious chivalry and hereditary aristocracy of\r\nthe South! Peerless first families of Virginia and Carolina!... Progeny\r\nof the highwaymen, and horse-thieves and sheep-stealers, and\r\npick-pockets of Old England!\"\r\n\r\nThe South was not to be outdone, and here was a retort from _De Bow's\r\nReview_, July, 1858:\r\n\r\n\"The basis, framework, and controlling influence of Northern sentiment\r\nis Puritanism--the old Roundhead, rebel refuse of England, which ... has\r\never been an unruly sect of Pharisees ... the worst bigots on earth and\r\nthe meanest of tyrants when they have the power to exercise it.\"[69]\r\n\r\n  [69] Theodore Clarke Smith, \"Parties and Slavery,\" p. 303.\r\n\r\nAnd the non-slave-holder of the South did not escape from the pitiless\r\npelting of the storm. He was sustaining the slave-holder, and this was\r\nnot only an offence but a puzzle.\r\n\r\nIt became quite common in the North for anti-slavery writers to classify\r\nthe non-slave-holding agricultural classes of the South as \"poor\r\nwhites,\" thus distinguishing them from the slave-holders; and the idea\r\nis current even now in that section that as a class the lordly\r\nslave-holder despised his poor white fellow-citizen. The average\r\nnon-slave-holding Southern agriculturist, whether farming for himself or\r\nfor others, was a type of man that no one who knew him, least of all the\r\nSouthern slave-holder, his neighbor and political ally, could despise.\r\nEducated and uneducated, these people were independent voters and honest\r\njurors, the very backbone of Southern State governments that always will\r\nbe notable in history for efficiency, purity, and economy.\r\n\r\nThis class of voters, however, came in for much abuse in the literature\r\nof the crusade. They were all lumped together as \"poor whites,\"\r\nsometimes as \"poor white trash,\" and the belief was inculcated that\r\ntheir imperious slave-holding neighbors applied that term to them. \"Poor\r\nwhite trash,\" on its face, is \"nigger talk,\" caught up, doubtless, from\r\nSouthern negro barbers and bootblacks, and used by writers who, from\r\ninformation thus derived, pictured Southern society.\r\n\r\nThis is a sample of the numerous errors that crept into the literature\r\nof one section of our Union about social conditions in the other during\r\nthat memorable sectional controversy. It is on a par with the idea that\r\nprevailed, in some quarters in the South, that the Yankee cared for\r\nnothing but money, and would not fight even for that.\r\n\r\nSoutherners were practically all of the old British stock. Homogeneity,\r\ncommon memories of the wars of the Revolution, of 1812, and with Mexico,\r\nand Fourth of July celebrations, all tended to bind together strongly\r\nthe Southern slave-holder and non-slave-holder.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many classes of non-slave-holders--the thrifty\r\nfarmer, the unthrifty, and the laborer who worked for hire, but more\r\nfrequently for \"shares of the crop.\" Then there were others--the\r\ninhabitants of the \"sand-hills\" and the mountain regions. These people\r\nwere, as a rule, very shiftless; too lazy to work, they were still too\r\nproud to beg, as the very poor usually do in other countries. The\r\nmountaineers were hardier than the sand-hillers, and it was from the\r\nmountains of Tennessee, Alabama, etc., that the Union armies gathered\r\nmany recruits. This was not, as is often stated, because mountaineers\r\nlove liberty better than others, but because these mountaineers never\r\ncame into contact with either master or slave. The crusade against\r\nslavery, therefore, did not threaten to affect their personal status.\r\n\r\nThere were very few public schools in the South, but in the cities and\r\ntowns there were academies and high-schools, and the country was dotted\r\nwith \"old field schools,\" most of them not good, but sufficient to train\r\nthose who became efficient leaders in social, religious, and political\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful progress made by the Southern white man during the last\r\nthirty-five years is by no means all due to the abolition of slavery.\r\nLabor, it is true, is held in higher esteem. This is a great gain, but\r\nstill more is due to improved transportation, to better prices for\r\ntimber and cotton, to commercial fertilizers, and an awakening interest\r\nin education. The South is also developing its mineral resources and is\r\nnow rapidly forging to the front. The white man is making more cotton\r\nthan the negro.\r\n\r\nBut the very strongest bond that bound together the Southern\r\nslave-holder and non-slave-holder was the pride of caste. Every white\r\nman was a freeman; he belonged to the superior, the dominant race.\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke, England's philosopher-statesman, in his speech on\r\n\"Conciliation with America\" at the beginning of our Revolution,\r\ncomplimented in high terms the spirit of liberty among the dissenting\r\nprotestants of New England. Then, alluding to the hopes indulged in by\r\nsome gentlemen, that the Southern colonies would be loyal to Great\r\nBritain because the Church of England had there a large establishment,\r\nhe said: \"It is certainly true. There is, however, a circumstance\r\nattending these colonies which in my opinion fully counter-balances this\r\ndifference, and makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty\r\nthan in those to the Northward. It is, that in Virginia and Carolina\r\nthey have a vast multitude of slaves. Where this is the case, in any\r\npart of the world, _those who are free are by far the most proud and\r\njealous of their freedom_. Freedom with them is not only an enjoyment,\r\nbut a kind of _rank and privilege_.\"\r\n\r\nThe privilege of belonging to the superior race and of being free was a\r\nbond that tied all Southern whites together, and it was infinitely\r\nstrengthened by a crusade that seemed, from a Southern stand-point, to\r\nhave for its purpose the levelling of all distinctions between the white\r\nman and the slave hard by.\r\n\r\nSocially, there were classes in the South as there are everywhere. The\r\ncontrolling class consisted of professional men, lawyers, physicians,\r\nteachers, and high-class merchants (though the merchant prince was\r\nunknown), and slave-holders. Slave-holders were, of course, divided into\r\nclasses, chiefly two: those who had acquired culture and breeding from\r\nslave-holding ancestors, and those who had little culture or breeding,\r\nprincipally the newly rich. It was the former class that gave tone to\r\nSouthern society. The performance of duty always ennobles, and this is\r\nespecially true of duty done by superiors to inferiors. The master and\r\nmistress of a slave establishment were responsible for the moral and\r\nmaterial welfare of their dependents. When they appreciated and\r\nfulfilled their responsibilities, as the best families usually did,\r\nthere was found what was called the Southern aristocracy. The habit of\r\ncommand, assured position, and high ideals, coming down, as these often\r\ndid, with family traditions, gave these favored people ease and grace,\r\nand they were social favorites, both in the North and Europe. At home\r\nthey dispensed a hospitality that made the South famous. They were\r\nexemplars, giving tone to society, and it was notable that breeding and\r\nculture, and not wealth, gave tone to Southern society. There was\r\nperhaps in Virginia and South Carolina an aristocracy that was somewhat\r\nmore exclusive than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSlavery was at its worst when masters were not equal to their\r\nresponsibilities, for want of either culture or Christian feeling, or\r\nboth, as also when, as was now and then the case, a brutal overseer was\r\nin charge of a plantation far away from the eye of the owner.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the slave-holder and his lavish hospitality did not\r\nmake for thrift among his less fortunate brethren; it made perhaps for\r\nprodigality, but it also made for a high sense of honor among\r\nslave-holders and non-slave-holders as well. Both slave-holders and\r\nnon-slave-holders were extremely punctilious. Money did not count where\r\nhonor was concerned, and Southerners do well to be proud of the record\r\nin this respect that has been made by their statesmen.\r\n\r\nAmong the more cultured classes in the period here treated of, the duel\r\nprevailed, a practice now very properly condemned. But it made for a\r\nhigh sense of honor. Demagogues were not common when a false statement\r\non \"the stump\" was apt to result in a mortal combat.\r\n\r\nAmong the less cultured classes insult was answered with a blow of the\r\nfist. Fisticuffs, too, were quite common to ascertain who was the \"best\r\nman\" in a community or county. The rules were not according to the\r\nMarquis of Queensbury, but they always secured \"fair play.\"[70]\r\n\r\n  [70] For the humorous side of life in the South in the old day, see\r\n  \"Simon Suggs,\" J. J. Hooper; \"Georgia Scenes,\" Judge Longstreet; and\r\n  \"Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi,\" by Baldwin.\r\n\r\nThis combative spirit of Southerners was undoubtedly a result of the\r\nspirit of caste that came from slavery. Sometimes it was unduly\r\nexhibited in Congress during the controversy over slavery and State's\r\nrights, and excited Southerners occasionally subjected themselves to the\r\ncharge of arrogance.\r\n\r\nOne of the great evils of slavery was that, as a rule, neither the\r\nslave-holder nor the non-slave-holder properly appreciated the dignity\r\nof labor. A witty student at a Southern university said that his chief\r\nobjection to college life was that he could not have a negro to learn\r\nhis lessons for him. The slave-holder quite generally disdained manual\r\nlabor, and the non-slave-holder was also inclined to deprecate the\r\nnecessity that compelled him to work.\r\n\r\nThe sudden abolition of slavery was the ruin of thousands of innocent\r\nfamilies--a loss for which there was no recompense. But for the South at\r\nlarge, and especially to this generation, it is a blessing that all\r\nclasses have come to see, that to labor and to be useful is not only a\r\nduty, but a privilege.\r\n\r\nPolitical conditions, North and South, differed widely. The North was\r\nthe majority section. Its majority could protect its rights; recourse to\r\nthe limitations of the Federal Constitution was seldom necessary. The\r\nSouth, a minority section, with a devotion that never failed, held high\r\nthe \"Constitution of the fathers, the palladium\" of its rights. To one\r\nsection the Constitution was the bond of a Federal Union that was the\r\nsecurity for interstate commerce and national prosperity; to the other\r\nit was a guaranty of peace abroad and local self-government at home. In\r\nthe one section the brightest minds were for the most part engaged in\r\nbusiness or in literary pursuits; in the other, politics absorbed much\r\nof its talent. In the North the staple of political discussion was\r\nusually some business or moral question, while in the South the\r\npolitical arena was a great school in which the masses were not only\r\neducated in the history of the formation of the Constitution, but taught\r\nan affectionate regard for that instrument as a revered \"gift from the\r\nfathers\" and the only safeguard of American liberty. Joint political\r\ndiscussions, which were common between the ablest men of opposing\r\nparties, were always numerously attended, and the Federal Constitution\r\nwas an unfailing topic. The result was, an amount of political\r\ninformation in the average Confederate soldier that the average Union\r\nsoldier in his business training had never acquired, and a devotion of\r\nthe Southerner to the Constitution of his country which even the ablest\r\nhistorians of to-day have failed to comprehend.\r\n\r\nIt is often stated, as if it were an important fact in the consideration\r\nof the great anti-slavery crusade, that not many of the Abolitionists\r\nwere as radical as Garrison, and that of the anti-slavery voters very\r\nfew favored social equality between whites and blacks. Southerners did\r\nnot stop to make distinctions like these. They saw the Abolitionists\r\nadvocating mixed schools and favoring laws authorizing mixed marriages;\r\nsaw them practising social equality; saw the general trend in that\r\ndirection; and so from its very beginning the Republican party, which\r\nhad absorbed the Abolitionists, was dubbed, North and South, the \"Black\r\nRepublican\" party.\r\n\r\nThe whites of the South believed that the triumph of the \"Black\r\nRepublican\" party, as they called it, would be ultimately the triumph of\r\nits most radical elements. Judge Reagan, of Texas, United States\r\ncongressman in 1860-61, Confederate Postmaster-General, later United\r\nStates senator, and always until 1860 an avowed friend of the Union, in\r\nhis farewell speech to the Congress of the United States in January,\r\n1861, gave expression to this idea when he said:\r\n\r\n\"And now you tender to us the inhuman alternative of unconditional\r\nsubmission to _Republican rule on abolition principles, and ultimately\r\nto free negro equality, and a government of mongrels_, or a war of races\r\non the one hand, and on the other, secession and a bloody and desolating\r\ncivil war.\"[71]\r\n\r\n  [71] \"Memoirs of John H. Reagan,\" p. 261.\r\n\r\nJudge Reagan was expressing in Congress the opinion that animated the\r\nConfederate soldier in the war that was to follow secession, an opinion\r\nthe ex-Confederate did not see much reason to change when the era of\r\nReconstruction had been reached, and the ballot had been given to every\r\nnegro, while the leading whites were disfranchised.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Hinton Rowan Helper, of North Carolina, wrote a notable book to\r\nshow that slavery was a curse to the South, and especially to the\r\nnon-slave-holders. It was an appeal to the latter to become\r\nAbolitionists. His arguments availed nothing; back of his book was the\r\nRepublican party, now planting itself, as Garrison had planted himself,\r\non an extract from the first sentence of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, \"all men are created equal.\" The Republican contention\r\nwas, in platforms and speeches, that the Declaration of Independence\r\ncovered negroes as well as whites,[72] and Southern whites, nearly all\r\nof Revolutionary stock, resented the idea. They rebelled at the\r\nsuggestion that the signers, every one of whom, save possibly those from\r\nMassachusetts, represented slave-holding constituents, intended to say\r\nthat the negroes then in the colonies were the equals of the whites. If\r\nso, why were these negroes kept in slavery, and why were they not\r\nimmediately given the right to vote, to sit on juries, to be educated,\r\nand to intermarry with the whites?\r\n\r\n  [72] Mr. Lincoln took that position in his great speech at Chicago, in\r\n  1858, when beginning his campaign for the senatorship.\r\n\r\nAll this, the Southerners said, as, indeed, did many Northerners also,\r\nwas to be the logical outcome of the Republican doctrine, that negroes\r\nand whites were equals. It is passing strange that modern historians so\r\noften have failed to note that this thought was in the minds of all the\r\nopponents of the Republican party from the day of its birth--North and\r\nSouth it was called the \"Black Republican\" party. Douglas, in his debate\r\nwith Lincoln, gave it that name and stood by it. In his speech at\r\nJonesboro, Illinois, September 15, 1858, he charges the Republicans with\r\nadvocating \"negro citizenship and negro equality, putting the white man\r\nand the negro on the same basis under the law.\"[73]\r\n\r\n  [73] Lincoln, \"Complete Works,\" vol. IV, p. 9.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Calhoun, in a memorial to the Southern people in 1849, signed by\r\nmany other congressmen, had said that Northern fanaticism would not stop\r\nat emancipation. \"Another step would be taken to raise them [the\r\nnegroes] to a political and social equality with their former owners, by\r\ngiving them the right of voting and holding public office under the\r\nFederal Government.... But when raised to an equality they would become\r\nthe fast political associates of the North, acting and voting with them\r\non all questions, and by this perfect union between them holding the\r\nSouth in complete subjection. _The blacks and the profligate whites that\r\nmight unite with them_ would become the principal recipients of Federal\r\npatronage, and would, in consequence, be raised above the whites of the\r\nSouth in the social and political scale. We would, in a word, change\r\nconditions with them, _a degradation greater than has as yet fallen to\r\nthe lot of a free and enlightened people_.\"[74]\r\n\r\n  [74] \"Calhoun's Works,\" vol. VI, p. 311.\r\n\r\nIn the light of Reconstruction, this was prophecy.\r\n\r\nThese words, once heard by a Southern white man, of course sank into his\r\nheart. They could never have been forgotten. The argument of Helper fell\r\non deaf ears. If Helper had come with the promise (and an assurance of\r\nits fulfilment) that the negroes, when emancipated, would be sent to\r\nLiberia, or elsewhere _out of the country_, the South would have become\r\nRepublicanized at once. Even if the slave-holder had been unwilling, the\r\nSouthern non-slave-holder, with his three, and often five, to one\r\nmajority, would have seen to it.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not too much to say that if the negro had been, as the\r\nAbolitionists and ultimately many Republicans contended he was, the\r\nequal of the white man, Liberia would have been a success. What a\r\nglorious consummation of the dreams of statesmen and philanthropists\r\nthat would have been! Abolitionists, unable to frustrate their scheme,\r\nand the American negro, profiting by the civilization here received from\r\ncontact with the white man, building by his own energy happy homes for\r\nhimself and his kinsmen, and enjoying the blessings of a great\r\ngovernment of his own, in his own great continent!\r\n\r\nAfrica with its vast resources is a prize that all Europe is now\r\ncontending for. It is believed to be adapted even to white men. Most\r\nassuredly, for the negro Liberia offered far better opportunities than\r\ndid the rocky coast of New England to the white men who settled it.\r\nLiberia had been carefully selected as a desirable part of Africa. It\r\nwas an unequalled group of statesmen and philanthropists that had\r\nplanted the colony; they provided for it and set it on its feet. But it\r\nfailed; failed just for the same reason that prevented the aboriginal\r\nAfrican from catching on to the civilization that began to develop\r\nthousands of years ago, close by his side on the borders of the\r\nMediterranean; failed for the same reason that Hayti, now free for a\r\ncentury, has failed. The failure of the plan of the American\r\nColonization Society to repatriate the American negro in Africa was due\r\n_primarily to the incapacity of the negro_.\r\n\r\nA very complete and convincing story will be found in an article\r\nentitled \"Liberia, an Example of Negro Self-Government,\"[75] by Miss\r\nAgnes P. Mahony, for five years a missionary in that country. The author\r\nof the article was a sympathizing friend. She says: \"In 1847 the colony\r\nwas considered healthy enough to stand alone.... So our flag was lowered\r\non the African continent, and the protectors of the colony retired,\r\nleaving the people to govern the country in their own way.\" Then she\r\nrecites that in order to test their capacity for self-government their\r\nconstitution (1847) provided that no white man should hold property in\r\nthe country; and to this Miss Mahony traces the failure that followed.\r\nWhen she wrote, the Liberian negroes, for fifty-nine years under the\r\nprotectorship of the United States, had been troubled by no foreign\r\nenemy; yet their failure was complete--not a foot of railroad, no cable\r\ncommunication with foreign countries, no telegraphic communication with\r\nthe interior, etc. Still the devoted missionary thinks that Liberia\r\nmight prosper, if it could but have \"_the encouraging example of and\r\ncontact with the right kind of white men_.\"\r\n\r\n  [75] _Independent_, 1906.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe presidential campaign of 1860 was very exciting. There were four\r\ntickets in the field, Douglas and Johnson, Democrats; Breckenridge and\r\nLane, Democrats; Lincoln and Hamlin, Republicans, and Bell and Everett\r\nrepresenting the \"Constitutional Union\" party. As the election\r\napproached it became apparent that the Republicans were leading, and\r\nfar-seeing men, like Samuel J. Tilden, of New York, became much alarmed\r\nfor fear that the election of Lincoln would bring about secession in the\r\nSouth. Mr. Tilden, in view of the danger that to him was apparent,\r\nwrote, shortly before the election, to William Kent, of New York City,\r\nan open letter in which he earnestly urged a combination in New York\r\nState of the supporters of other candidates, in order to defeat Abraham\r\nLincoln. The letter was so alarming that some of Tilden's friends\r\nthought he had lost his balance; but now that letter is regarded as a\r\nremarkable proof of his sagacity. In the first volume of Mr. Tilden's\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" by Bigelow, appears an \"Appreciation\" by James C.\r\nCarter and an analysis of this letter. Of this the following is a brief\r\nabstract: Mr. Tilden first argued that two strictly sectional parties,\r\narrayed upon the question of destroying an institution which one of\r\nthem, not unnaturally, regarded as essential to self-existence, would\r\nbring war.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Tilden further said that if the Republican party should be\r\nsuccessful in establishing its dominion over the South, the national\r\ngovernment in the Southern States would cease to be self-government and\r\nbecome a government of one people over a distinct people, a thing\r\nimpossible with our race, except as a consequence of a successful war,\r\nand even then incompatible with our democratic institutions. He also\r\nsaid: \"I assert that a controversy between powerful communities,\r\norganized into governments, of a nature like that which now divides the\r\nNorth and South, can be settled only by convention or by war.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"A condition of parties in which the Federative Government\r\nshall be carried on by a party, having no affiliations in the Southern\r\nStates, is impossible to continue. Such a government would be out of all\r\nrelations to those States. It would have neither the nerves of\r\nsensation, which convey intelligence to the intellect of the body\r\npolitic, nor the ligaments and muscles, which hold its parts together\r\nand move them in harmony. It would be in substance the government of one\r\npeople by another people. That system will not do for our race.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden, when he spoke of \"two sectional parties arrayed upon the\r\nquestion of destroying an institution,\" _viz._, slavery, saw the\r\nsituation exactly as the South did. To prove that the Republican party\r\nwas looking to the ultimate destruction of the institution, Mr. Tilden\r\ncited the leadership of Chase and his speeches in which he was\r\npropounding the higher law theory; asserting that the conflict was\r\n\"irrepressible\"; suggesting the power of the North to amend the\r\nConstitution, etc.\r\n\r\nThe South noted this, and it regarded, not the platform, but the record\r\nof the Republican party and of the statesmen the party was following.\r\n\r\nLong before 1860, that great American scholar, George Ticknor, saw the\r\ndilemma in which the North was involving itself by its concern over\r\nslavery in the South, and he thus stated it, in a letter to his friend,\r\nWilliam Ellery Channing, April 30, 1842:[76]\r\n\r\n  [76] Life and Letters and Journals of George Ticknor.\r\n\r\n\"On the subject of our relations with the South and its slavery, we\r\nmust--as I have always thought--do one of two things; either keep\r\nhonestly the bargain of the Constitution as it shall be interpreted by\r\nthe authorities--of which the Supreme Court of the United States is the\r\nchief and safest--or declare honestly that we can no longer in our\r\nconscience consent to keep it, and break it.\"\r\n\r\nThe North had failed to \"keep honestly the bargain of the Constitution\"\r\nby faithfully delivering fugitive slaves and leaving the question of\r\nslavery to be dealt with by the States in which it existed, and was now,\r\nin 1860, upon the other horn of the dilemma--repudiating and denouncing\r\na decision of the Supreme Court, which, as Mr. Ticknor had said, was the\r\n\"chief and safest authority.\" But during that campaign of 1860 very\r\nmany, perhaps a majority of the Republican voters, failed to realize\r\nwhat their party was standing for. Indeed, down to this day the members\r\nof that organization, taught as they have been, indignantly deny that a\r\nvote for Lincoln and Hamlin in 1860 looked to an interference with\r\nslavery in the States.\r\n\r\nBut now Professor Emerson David Fite, of Yale University, sees in 1911\r\nwhat was the underlying hope, and consequently the ultimate aim, of the\r\nRepublican party in 1860, exactly as the South saw it then. In a\r\npowerful summing up of more evidence than there is room to recite here,\r\nhe says: \"The testimony of the Democracy and of the leaders of the\r\nRepublican party accords well with the evidence of daily events in\r\n_revealing Republican aggression_. _The party hoped to destroy slavery,\r\nand this was something new in a large political organization._\"[77]\r\n\r\n  [77] \"The Presidential Campaign of 1860,\" p. 195, Fite, 1911.\r\n\r\nThat this party, when it should ultimately come into full power, would,\r\nto carry out the purpose which Professor Fite now sees, ignore the\r\nFederal Constitution was, in 1860, evident to Southerners from the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the governor of Virginia demanded of the governor of New York\r\nthe extradition of two men indicted in Virginia for enticing away slaves\r\nfrom their masters. Governor Seward, of New York, refused the demand, on\r\nthe ground that no such offence existed in New York. This case did not\r\ngo to the courts, but in 1860 the governor of Kentucky made a similar\r\ndemand in a like case on the governor of Ohio, who placed his refusal on\r\nthe same grounds as had Governor Seward in the former case. The Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States in this case decided that the governor of\r\nOhio, in refusing to deliver up the fugitive, was violating the\r\nConstitution. The court further said:\r\n\r\n\"If the governor of Ohio refuses to _discharge this duty there is no\r\npower delegated to the general government_, either through the judicial\r\ndepartment or any other department, to use any coercive means to compel\r\nhim.\"[78]\r\n\r\n  [78] \"Virginia's Attitude on Slavery and Secession,\" Mumford, pp.\r\n  211-12.\r\n\r\nIf these two governors had defied the Federal Constitution, so had\r\neleven State legislatures. From 1854 to 1860, inclusive, Vermont, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas,\r\nOhio, and Pennsylvania, had all passed new \"personal liberty laws\" to\r\nabrogate the new fugitive slave law of 1850.\r\n\r\nOf these laws Professor Alexander Johnston said:\r\n\r\n\"There is absolutely no excuse for the personal liberty laws. If the\r\nrendition of fugitive slaves was a federal obligation, the personal\r\nliberty laws were flat disobedience to the law; if the obligation was\r\nupon the States, they were a gross breach of good faith, for they were\r\nintended and operated to prevent rendition; and, in either case, they\r\nwere in violation of the Constitution.\"[79]\r\n\r\n  [79] Alexander Johnston, \"Lalor's Encyclopaedia,\" vol. III, p. 163.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the State of Wisconsin. Its Supreme Court intervened and\r\ntook from the hands of the federal authorities an alleged fugitive\r\nslave. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the case and\r\nordered the slave back into the custody of the United States\r\nmarshal;[80] and thereupon the General Assembly of Wisconsin expressly\r\nrepudiated the authority of the United States Supreme Court. The\r\nWisconsin assembly asserted its right to nullify the Federal law, basing\r\nits action on the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798--a recrudescence of a\r\ndoctrine long since abandoned even in the South.\r\n\r\n  [80] Ableman _v._ Booth, 21 How.\r\n\r\nIn reality all this defiance of the Constitution of the United States by\r\nState executives, State legislatures, and a State court, was on the\r\nground that whatever was dictated by conscience to these officials was a\r\n\"higher law than the Constitution of the United States\"; and modern\r\nhistorians recognize, as Tilden did, the leadership of the statesman who\r\nin 1850 announced that startling doctrine. It is Alexander Johnston who\r\nsays, \"Seward's speeches in the Senate made him the leader of the\r\nRepublican party from its first organization.\"[81]\r\n\r\n  [81] Alexander Johnston, \"Lalor's Encyclopaedia,\" vol. III, p. 707.\r\n\r\nTo the minds of Southerners it seemed clear that _if the Southern States\r\ndesired to preserve for themselves the Constitution of the fathers, they\r\nmust secede and set it up over a government of their own_. This eleven\r\nof these States did. Many of them were reluctant to take the step; all\r\ntheir people had loved the old Union, but they passed their ordinances\r\nof secession, united as the Confederate States of America, and their\r\nofficials took an oath to maintain inviolate the old Constitution,\r\nwhich, with unimportant changes in it, they had adopted.\r\n\r\nThe new government sent delegates to ask that the separation should be\r\npeaceful. The application was denied and the war followed. Attempts to\r\nsecede were made in Kentucky and Missouri. In neither of these States\r\ndid the seceders get full control. They were represented, however, in\r\nthe Confederate Congress by senators and representatives elected by the\r\ntroops from those States that were serving in the Confederate army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFOUR YEARS OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bitter fruits of anti-slavery agitation were secession and four\r\nyears of bloody war. The Federal Government waged war to coerce the\r\nseceding States to remain in the Union. With the North it was a war for\r\nthe Union; the South was fighting for independence--denominated by\r\nNorthern writers as \"the Civil War.\" It was in reality a war between the\r\neleven States which had seceded, as autonomous States, and were fighting\r\nfor independence, as the Confederate States of America, against the\r\nother twenty-two States, which, as the United States of America, fought\r\nagainst secession and for the Union of all the States. It is true the\r\nStates remaining in the Union had with them the army and the navy and\r\nthe old government, but that government could not, and did not, exercise\r\nits functions within the borders of the seceded States until by force of\r\narms in the war that was now waged it had conquered a control. It was a\r\nwar between the States for such control; for independence on the one\r\nhand, and for the Union on the other. It was not, save in exceptional\r\ncases, a war between neighbor and neighbor; it was a war between States\r\nas entities, and therefore not properly a civil war. The result of the\r\nwar did not change the principles upon which it was fought, though it\r\ndid decide finally the issues that were involved, the right of secession\r\nprimarily, and slavery incidentally.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, afterward the much-loved President of the Confederacy,\r\nin his farewell speech in the United States Senate, March 21, 1861, thus\r\nstated the case of the South: \"Then, senators, we recur to the compact\r\nwhich binds us together. We recur to the principles upon which this\r\ngovernment was founded, and _when you deny them_, and when you deny to\r\nus the right to withdraw from a Union which thus perverted _threatens to\r\nbe destructive of our rights, we but tread in the path of our fathers\r\nwhen we proclaim our independence and take the hazard_. This is done not\r\nin hostility to others, not to injure any section of our country, _not\r\neven for our own pecuniary benefit, but from the high and solemn motive\r\nof defending and protecting the rights we inherited and which it is our\r\nduty to transmit unshorn to our children_.\"\r\n\r\nSoutherners were, as Mr. Davis understood it, treading in the path of\r\ntheir fathers when they proclaimed their independence and fought for the\r\nright of self-government.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fite, of Yale, justifies secession on the following ground:\r\n\r\n\"In the last analysis the one complete justification of secession was\r\nthe necessity of saving the vast property of slavery from destruction;\r\nsecession was a commercial necessity designed to make those billions\r\nsecure from outside interference. Viewed in this light, secession was\r\nright, for any people, prompted by the commonest motives of self-defence\r\nand with no moral scruples against slavery, would have followed the same\r\ncourse. The present generation of Northerners, born and reared after the\r\nwar, must shake off their inherited political passions and prejudices\r\nand pronounce the verdict of justification for the South. Believing\r\nslavery to be right, it was the duty of the South to defend it. It is\r\ntime that the words 'traitors,' 'conspirators,' 'rebels,' and\r\n'rebellion' be discarded.\"[82]\r\n\r\n  [82] \"The Presidential Campaign of 1860,\" Emerson David Fite, 1911,\r\n  introductory chapter.\r\n\r\nThese words of Professor Fite will waken a responsive echo in the hearts\r\nof Southerners, but Southerners place, and their fathers planted,\r\nthemselves on higher ground than commercial considerations. The\r\nConfederates were defending their inherited right of local\r\nself-government and the Federal Constitution that secured it. It was for\r\nthese rights that, as Mr. Davis had said, they were willing to _follow\r\nthe path their fathers trod_.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the Union the North was fighting for, was a noble\r\nmotive; it looked to the future greatness and glory of the republic; but\r\ndevotion to the Union had been a growth, the product largely of a single\r\ngeneration; the devotion of the South to the right of local\r\nself-government was an older and deeper conviction; it had been bred in\r\nthe bone for three generations; it dated from Bunker Hill and Valley\r\nForge and Yorktown. Close as the non-slave-holders of the South were to\r\nthe slave-holders, of the same British stock, and with the same\r\ntraditions, blood kinsmen as they were, they might not have been willing\r\nto dare all and do all for the protection of property in which they were\r\nnot interested; but they were ready to, and they did, wage a death\r\nstruggle to maintain against a hostile sectional majority, their\r\ninherited right to govern themselves in their own way. Added to this was\r\nthe ever-present conviction of Southerners all, that they were battling\r\nnot only for the supremacy of their race but for the preservation of\r\ntheir homes. There was a little ditty quite prevalent in the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia, of which nothing is now remembered except the\r\nrefrain, but that of itself speaks volumes. It ran:\r\n\r\n  \"Do you belong to the rebel band\r\n  Fighting for your home?\"\r\n\r\nNortherners had, most of them, convinced themselves that the South would\r\nnever dare to secede. The danger of servile insurrections, if nothing\r\nelse, would prevent it.[83] Many Southerners, on the other hand, could\r\nnot see how, under the Constitution, the North could venture on coercion.\r\n\r\n  [83] See Fite, \"Campaign of 1860,\" passim, and especially speech of\r\n  Schurz, p. 244 _et seq._\r\n\r\nBut to the South the greatest surprise furnished by the events of that\r\nera has been Abraham Lincoln--as he appears now in the light of history.\r\nWhat, in the minds of Southerners, fixed his status personally, during\r\nthe canvass of 1860, was the statement he had made in his speech at\r\nChicago, preliminary to his great debate with Douglas in 1858, that the\r\nUnion could not \"continue to exist half slave and half free.\" And he was\r\nnow the candidate of the \"Black Republican\" party, a party that was\r\ndenouncing a decision of the Supreme Court; that, in nearly every State\r\nin the North, had nullified the fugitive slave law, and that stood for\r\n\"negro equality,\" as the South termed it.\r\n\r\nThere were other statements by Mr. Lincoln in that debate with Douglas\r\nthat the South has had especial reason to take note of since the period\r\nof Reconstruction. At Springfield, Illinois, September 18, 1858, he\r\nsaid: \"There is a physical difference between the white and black races\r\nwhich, I believe, will forever forbid the two races living together on\r\nterms of social and political equality, and, _inasmuch as they can not\r\nso live, while they do live together there must be the position of\r\nsuperior and inferior; and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of\r\nhaving that position assigned to the white man_.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Confederacy took the Constitution of the United States, so\r\nmodified as to make it read plainly as Jefferson had expounded it in the\r\nKentucky Resolutions of 1798. Other changes were slight. The\r\npresidential term was extended to six years and the President was not to\r\nbe re-eligible. The slave trade was prohibited and Congress was\r\nauthorized to forbid the introduction of slaves from the old Union.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln became President, with a fixed resolve to preserve the\r\nUnion but with no intent to abolish slavery. Had the war for the Union\r\nbeen as successful as he hoped it would be, slavery would not have been\r\nabolished by any act of his. It is clear that, when inaugurated, he had\r\nnot changed his opinions expressed at Springfield, nor those others,\r\nwhich, at Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, 1854, he had stated thus:\r\n\"When our Southern brethren tell us they are no more responsible for\r\nslavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said the\r\ninstitution exists and it is very difficult to get rid of it in any\r\nsatisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I will\r\nsurely not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do\r\nmyself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do\r\nas to the institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves\r\nand send them to Liberia, their native land.\"\r\n\r\nThis, he said, it was impracticable to do, at least suddenly, and then\r\nproceeded: \"To free them all and keep them among us as underlings--is it\r\nquite certain that this would better their condition?... What next? Free\r\nthem and make them politically and socially our equals?\" This question\r\nhe answered in the negative, and continued: \"It does seem to me that\r\nsystems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their\r\ntardiness I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South.\"\r\n\r\nIn these extracts from his speeches we find a central thread that runs\r\nthrough the history of his whole administration. We see it again when,\r\npressed by extremists, Mr. Lincoln said in an open letter to Horace\r\nGreeley, August 22, 1862: \"My paramount object in this struggle is to\r\nsave the Union, and it is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I\r\ncould save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it; and if I\r\ncould save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could\r\nsave it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Congress had, in 1861, by joint resolution declared that the\r\nsole purpose of the war was the preservation of the Union. In no other\r\nway, and for no other purpose, could the North at that time have been\r\ninduced to wage war against the South.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, the President of the United States, and Jefferson\r\nDavis, the President of the Confederate States, were both Kentuckians by\r\nbirth, both Americans. In the purity of their lives, public and private,\r\nin patriotic devotion to the preservation of American institutions as\r\nunderstood by each of them, they were alike; but they represented\r\ndifferent phases of American thought, and each was the creature more or\r\nless of his environment. Both were men of commanding ability, but the\r\ndestiny of each was shaped by agencies that now seem to have been\r\ndirected by the hand of Fate. Mr. Lincoln, by nature a political genius,\r\nwas carried to Illinois when a child, reared in the North-west among\r\nthose to whom, with the Mississippi River as their only outlet to the\r\nmarkets of the world, disunion, with its loss of their highway to the\r\nsea, was unthinkable. Lincoln became a Whig, with the Union of the\r\nStates the passion of his life, and finally, by forces he had not\r\nhimself put in motion, he was placed at the head of the Federal\r\nGovernment at a time when sectionalism had decided that the question of\r\nthe permanence of the Union was to be tried out, once and forever.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis went from Kentucky further South. He was a Democrat, and\r\nenvironment also moulded his opinions. During the long sectional\r\ncontroversy between the North and the South, \"State-rights\" became the\r\npassion of his life, and when the clash between the sections came, he\r\nfound himself, without his seeking, at the head of the Confederacy. He\r\nhad been prominent among the Southerners at Washington, who had hoped\r\nthat the South, by threats of secession, might obtain its rights in the\r\nUnion, as had been done in Jefferson's days by New England. In the\r\nmovement (1860-61) that resulted in secession, the people at home had\r\nbeen ahead of their congressmen. William L. Yancey, then in Alabama, not\r\nJefferson Davis at Washington, was the actual leader of the\r\nsecessionists. Mr. Davis feared a long and bloody war and, unlike\r\nYancey, he had doubts as to its result.[84]\r\n\r\n  [84] Mrs. Chestnut, wife of the Confederate general, James Chestnut,\r\n  writes in her \"Diary from Dixie,\" under date of 1861, at Montgomery,\r\n  Alabama, then the Confederate capital: \"In Mrs. Davis's drawing-room\r\n  last night, the President took a seat by me on the sofa where I sat. He\r\n  talked for nearly an hour. He laughed at our faith in our own powers. We\r\n  are like the British. We think every Southerner equal to three Yankees\r\n  at least. We will have to be equivalent to a dozen now. After his\r\n  experience of the fighting qualities of Southerners in Mexico, he\r\n  believes that we will do all that can be done by pluck and muscle,\r\n  endurance and dogged courage, dash, and red-hot patriotism. And yet his\r\n  tone was not sanguine. _There was a sad refrain running through it all._\r\n  For one thing, either way, he thinks it will be a long war. That floored\r\n  me at once. It has been too long for me already. Then he said, before\r\n  the end came we would have many bitter experiences. He said only fools\r\n  doubted the courage of the Yankees, or their willingness to fight when\r\n  they saw fit. And now that we have stung their pride, we have roused\r\n  them till they will fight like devils.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, standing for the Union, succeeded in the war, but just as\r\nhe was on the threshold of his great work of Reconstruction he fell,\r\nthe victim of a crazy assassin. Martyrdom to his cause has naturally\r\nadded some cubits to the just measure of his wonderful reputation.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis and his cause failed; and the triumphant forces that\r\nswept the Confederacy out of existence have long (and quite naturally)\r\nsought to bury the cause of the South and its chosen leader in ignominy.\r\nBut the days of hate and passion are past; reason is reasserting her\r\nsway; and history will do justice to both the Confederacy and its great\r\nleader, whose ability, patriotism, and courage were conspicuous to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis was also a martyr--his long imprisonment, the manacles he\r\nwore, the sentinel gazing on him in the bright light that day and night\r\ndisturbed his rest; the heroism with which he endured all this, and the\r\nquiet dignity of his after life--these have doubly endeared his memory\r\nto those for whose cause he suffered.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had remarkable political tact--he seemed to know how long to\r\nwait and when to act, and, if we may credit Mr. Welles,[85] his\r\ninflexibly honest Secretary of the Navy, he was, with the members of his\r\ncabinet, wonderfully patient and even long-suffering. And although he\r\nwas the subject of much abuse, especially at the hands of Southerners\r\nwho then totally misunderstood him, he was animated always by the\r\nphilosophy of his own famous words, \"With malice towards none, with\r\ncharity for all.\" Never for one moment did he forget, amidst even the\r\nbitterest of his trials, that the Confederates, then in arms against\r\nhim, were, as he regarded them, his misguided fellow-citizens; and the\r\nsupreme purpose of his life was to bring them back into the Union, not\r\nas conquered foes, but as happy and contented citizens of the great\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n  [85] \"Diary of Gideon Welles,\" 3 vols., passim.\r\n\r\nThe resources of the Confederacy and the United States were very\r\nunequal. The Confederacy had no army, no navy, no factories, save here\r\nand there a flour mill or cotton factory, and practically no machine\r\nshops that could furnish engines for its railroads. It had one cannon\r\nfoundry. The Tredegar Iron Works, at Richmond, Virginia, was a fully\r\nequipped cannon foundry. The Confederacy's arms and munitions of war\r\nwere not sufficient to supply the troops that volunteered during the\r\nfirst six months of military operations. Its further supplies, except\r\nsuch as the Tredegar works furnished, depended on importations through\r\nthe blockade soon to be established and such as might be captured.\r\n\r\nThe North had the army and navy, factories of every description, food in\r\nabundance, and free access to the ports of the world.\r\n\r\nThe population of the North was 22,339,978.\r\n\r\nThe population of the South was 9,103,332, of which 3,653,870 were\r\ncolored. The total white male population of the Confederacy, of all\r\nages, was 2,799,818.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Adjutant-General of the United States, November 9,\r\n1880, show 2,859,132 men mustered into the service of the United States\r\nin 1861-65. General Marcus J. Wright, of the United States War Records\r\nOffice, in his latest estimate of Confederate enlistments, places the\r\noutside number at 700,000. The estimate of Colonel Henderson, of the\r\nstaff of the British army, in his \"Life of Stonewall Jackson,\" is\r\n900,000. Colonel Thomas J. Livermore, of Boston, estimates the\r\nnumber of Confederates at about 1,000,000, and insists that in the\r\nAdjutant-General's reports of the Union enlistments there are errors\r\nthat would bring down the number of Union soldiers to about 2,000,000.\r\nColonel Livermore's estimates are earnestly combated by Confederate\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nGeneral Charles Francis Adams has, in a recently published volume,[86]\r\ncited figures given mostly by different Confederate authorities, which\r\naggregate 1,052,000 Confederate enlistments. What authority these\r\nConfederate writers have relied on is not clear. The enlistments were\r\nfor the most part directly in the Confederate army and not through State\r\nofficials. The captured Confederate records should furnish the highest\r\nevidence. But it is earnestly insisted that these records are\r\nincomplete, and there is no purpose here to discuss a disputed point.\r\n\r\n  [86] \"Studies, Military and Diplomatic,\" p. 282 _et seq._ These studies\r\n  make a volume of rare historic value.\r\n\r\nThe call to arms was answered enthusiastically in both sections, but\r\nthe South was more united in its convictions, and practically all her\r\nyoung manhood fell into line, the rich and the poor, the cultured and\r\nuncultured serving in the ranks side by side.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of the noble women of the North, and of its humanitarian\r\nassociations, to the welfare of the Federal soldiers was remarkable, but\r\nthere was nothing in the situation in that section that could evoke such\r\na wonderful exhibition of heroism and self-sacrifice as was exhibited by\r\nthe devoted women of the South, who made willingly every possible\r\nsacrifice to the cause of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nBoth sides fought bravely. Excluding from the Union armies negroes,\r\nforeigners, and the descendants of recent immigrants, the Confederates\r\nand the Union soldiers were mainly of British stock. The Confederates\r\nhad some notable advantages. Excepting a few Union regiments from the\r\nWest, the Southerners were better shots and better horsemen, especially\r\nin the beginning of the war, than the Northerners; and the Southerners\r\nwere fighting not only for the Constitution of their fathers and the\r\ndefence of their homes, but for the supremacy of their race. They had\r\nalso another military advantage, that would probably have been decisive\r\nbut for the United States navy: they had interior lines of communication\r\nwhich would have enabled them to readily concentrate their forces. But\r\nthe United States navy, hovering around their coast-line, not only\r\nneutralized but turned this advantage into a weakness, thus compelling\r\nthe Confederates to scatter their armies. Every port had to be guarded.\r\n\r\nIn the West the Federals were almost uniformly successful in the greater\r\nbattles, the Confederates winning in these but two decisive victories,\r\nChickamauga and Sabine Cross Roads, in Louisiana. Estimating, according\r\nto the method of military experts, the percentage of losses of the\r\nvictor only, Chickamauga was the bloodiest battle of the world, from and\r\nincluding Waterloo down to the present time. Gettysburg and Sharpsburg\r\nalso rank as high in losses as any battle fought elsewhere in this long\r\nperiod, which takes in the Franco-German and the Russo-Japanese wars. At\r\nSharpsburg or Antietam the losses exceeded those in any other one day's\r\nbattle.[87]\r\n\r\n  [87] According to that standard work, E. P. Alexander's \"Memoirs,\" pp.\r\n  244, 245, and 274, the Confederates, who stood their ground at\r\n  Sharpsburg on the day of battle and the day after, lost in killed and\r\n  wounded thirty-two per cent. The French army at Waterloo entirely\r\n  dissolved, with a loss in killed and wounded of only thirty-one per\r\n  cent. (See figures in Henderson's \"Stonewall Jackson.\")\r\n\r\nThe Confederates were successful, excepting Antietam or Sharpsburg and\r\nGettysburg, and perhaps Seven Pines or Fair Oaks, in all the great\r\nbattles in the East, down to the time when the shattered remnant of\r\nLee's army was overwhelmed at Petersburg and surrendered at Appomattox.\r\nThe _elan_ the Southerners acquired in the many victories they won\r\nfighting for their homes is not to be overlooked. But the failure of the\r\nNorth with its overwhelming numbers and resources, to overcome the\r\nresistance of the half-famished Confederates until nearly four years had\r\nelapsed, can only be fully accounted for, in fairness to the undoubted\r\ncourage of the Union armies, by the fact, on which foreign military\r\ncritics are agreed, that the North had no such generals as Lee and\r\nStonewall Jackson. Only by the superior generalship of their leaders\r\ncould the Confederates have won as many battles as they did against\r\nvastly superior numbers.\r\n\r\nBut against the United States navy the brilliant generalship of the\r\nConfederates and their marvellous courage were powerless.\r\n\r\nAccepted histories of the war have been written largely by the army and\r\nits friends, and, strangely enough, the general historians have been so\r\nattracted by the gallantry displayed in great land battles, and the\r\nimmediate results, that they have utterly failed to appreciate the\r\nservices of the United States navy.\r\n\r\nThe Southerners accomplished remarkable results with torpedoes with the\r\n_Merrimac_ or _Virginia_ and their little fleet of commerce destroyers;\r\nbut the United States navy, by its effective blockade, starved the\r\nConfederacy to death. The Southern government could not market its\r\ncotton, nor could it import or manufacture enough military supplies.\r\nAmong its extremest needs were rails and rolling stock to refit its\r\nlines of communication. For want of transportation it was unable to\r\nconcentrate its armies, and for the same reason its troops were not half\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its services on the blockade, which, in Lord Wolseley's\r\nopinion, decided the war, the navy, with General Grant's help, cut the\r\nConfederacy in twain by way of the Mississippi. It penetrated every\r\nSouthern river, severing Confederate communications and destroying\r\ndepots of supplies. It assisted in the capture, early in the war, of\r\nForts Henry and Donelson, and it conducted Union troops along the\r\nTennessee River into east Tennessee and north Alabama. It furnished\r\nobjective points and supplies at Savannah, Charleston, and Wilmington,\r\nto Sherman on his march from Atlanta; and finally Grant, the great Union\r\ngeneral, who had failed to reach Richmond by way of the Wilderness,\r\nSpottsylvania, and Cold Harbor, achieved success only when the navy was\r\nat his back, holding his base, while he laid a nine months' siege to\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nThat distinguished author, Charles Francis Adams, himself a Union\r\ngeneral in the Army of the Potomac, says that the United States navy was\r\nthe deciding factor in the Civil War. He even says that every single\r\nsuccessful operation of the Union forces \"hinged and depended on naval\r\nsupremacy.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from the preface to \"The Crisis of the Confederacy,\" in\r\nwhich, published in 1905, a foreign expert, Captain Cecil Battine, of\r\nthe King's Hussars, condenses all that needs further to be said here\r\nabout the purely military side of the Civil War:\r\n\r\n     The history of the American Civil War still remains the most\r\n     important theme for the student and the statesman because it was\r\n     waged between adversaries of the highest intelligence and courage,\r\n     who fought by land and sea over an enormous area with every device\r\n     within the reach of human ingenuity, and who had to create every\r\n     organization needed for the purpose after the struggle had begun.\r\n     The admiration which the valor of the Confederate soldiers,\r\n     fighting against superior numbers and resources, excited in Europe;\r\n     the dazzling genius of some of the Confederate generals, and in\r\n     some measure jealousy at the power of the United States, have\r\n     ranged the sympathies of the world during the war and ever since to\r\n     a large degree on the side of the vanquished. Justice has hardly\r\n     been done to the armies which arose time and again from sanguinary\r\n     repulses, and from disasters more demoralizing than any repulse in\r\n     the field, because they were caused by political and military\r\n     incapacity in high places, to redeem which the soldiers freely shed\r\n     their blood as it seemed in vain. If the heroic endurance of the\r\n     Southern people and the fiery valor of the Southern armies thrill\r\n     us to-day with wonder and admiration, the stubborn tenacity and\r\n     courage which succeeded in preserving intact the heritage of the\r\n     American nation, and which triumphed over foes so formidable, are\r\n     not less worthy of praise and imitation. The Americans still hold\r\n     the world's record for hard fighting.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the Union soldiers enlisted for the preservation\r\nof the Union and not for the abolition of slavery. But among these\r\nsoldiers there was an abolition element, and very soon the tramp of\r\nfederal regiments was keeping time to\r\n\r\n  \"John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the ground,\r\n              As we go marching on.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the war Generals Fremont and Butler issued orders declaring\r\nfree the slaves within the Union lines; these orders President Lincoln\r\nrescinded. But Abolition sentiment was growing in the army and at the\r\nNorth, and the pressure upon the President to strike at slavery was\r\nincreasing. The Union forces were suffering repeated defeats; slaves at\r\nhome were growing food crops and caring for the families of Confederates\r\nwho were fighting at the front, and in September, 1862, President\r\nLincoln issued his preliminary proclamation of emancipation, basing it\r\non the ground of military necessity. It was to become effective January\r\n1, 1863.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the same Lincoln who had declared in 1858 his opinion that\r\nwhites and blacks could not live together as equals, socially and\r\npolitically; and it was the very same Lincoln who had repeatedly said he\r\ncherished no ill-will against his Southern brethren. If the slaves were\r\nto be freed, they and the whites should not be left together. He\r\ntherefore _sought diligently to find some home for the freedmen in a\r\nforeign country_. But unfortunately, as already seen, the American\r\nnegro, a bone of contention at home, was now a pariah to other peoples.\r\nMost nations welcome immigrants, but no country was willing to shelter\r\nthe American freedman, save only Liberia, long before a proven failure,\r\nand Hayti, where, under the blacks, anarchy had already been chronic for\r\nhalf a century. Hume tells us, in \"The Abolitionists,\" that for a time\r\nMr. Lincoln even considered setting Texas apart as a home for the negro.\r\n\r\nLater the surrender of the Confederate armies, together with the\r\nadoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, consummated\r\nemancipation, foreseeing which President Lincoln formulated his plan of\r\nReconstruction. Suffrage in the reconstructed States under his plan was\r\nto be limited to those who were qualified to vote at the date of\r\nsecession, which meant the whites. The sole exception he ever made to\r\nthis rule was a suggestion to Governor Hahn, of Louisiana, that it might\r\nbe well for the whites (of Louisiana) to give the ballot to a few of the\r\nmost intelligent of the negroes and to such as had served in the army.\r\n\r\nThe part the soldiers played, Federal and Confederate, in restoring the\r\nUnion, is a short story. The clash between them settled without reserve\r\nthe only question that was really in issue--secession; slavery, that had\r\nbeen the origin of sectional dissensions, was eliminated because it\r\nobstructed the success of the Union armies. By their gallantry in battle\r\nand conduct toward each other the men in blue and the men in gray\r\nrestored between the North and the South the mutual respect that had\r\nbeen lost in the bitterness of sectional strife, and without which\r\nthere could be no fraternal Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, when the war was on, said that the North was endeavoring\r\nto \"propagate free institutions at the point of the sword.\" The North\r\nwas not seeking to propagate in the South any new institution whatever.\r\nMr. Gladstone's paradox loses its point because both sections were\r\nfighting for the preservation of the same system of government.\r\n\r\nThe time has now happily come when, to use the language of Senator Hoar,\r\nas Americans, we can, North and South, discuss the causes that brought\r\nabout our terrible war \"in a friendly and quiet spirit, without\r\nrecrimination and without heat, each understanding the other, each\r\nstriving to help the other, as men who are bearing a common burden and\r\nlooking forward with a common hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe country, it is believed, has already reached the conclusions that\r\nthe South was absolutely honest in maintaining the right of secession\r\nand absolutely unswerving in its devotion to its ideas of the\r\nConstitution, and that the North was equally honest and patriotic in\r\nits fidelity to the Union. We need to advance one step further. Somebody\r\nwas to blame for starting a quarrel between brethren who were dwelling\r\ntogether in amity. If Americans can agree in fixing that blame, the\r\nknowledge thus acquired should help them to avoid such troubles\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a fair conclusion that the _initial cause of all our\r\ntroubles was the formation by Garrison of those Abolition societies_\r\nwhich the Boston people in their resolutions of August 1, 1835,\r\n\"disapproved of\" and described as \"associations instituted in the\r\nnon-slave-holding States, with the intent to act, within the\r\nslave-holding States, on the subject of slavery in those States, without\r\ntheir consent.\" And further, that it was the creation of these\r\nsocieties, the methods they resorted to, and their explicit defiance of\r\nthe Constitution that roused the fears and passions of the South and\r\ncaused that section to take up the quarrel that, afterward became\r\nsectional; and that, after much hot dispute and many regrettable\r\nincidents, North and South, resulted in secession and war.\r\n\r\nIn every dispute about slavery prior to 1831, the Constitution was\r\nalways regarded by every disputant as supreme. _The quarrel that was\r\nfatal to the peace of the Union began when the New Abolitionists put in\r\nthe new claim, that slavery in the South was the concern of the North,\r\nas well as of the South, and that there was a higher law than the\r\nConstitution. If the conscience of the individual, instead of human law,\r\nis to prescribe rules of conduct, society is at the mercy of anarchists.\r\nCzolgosz was conscientious when he murdered McKinley._\r\n\r\nHad all Americans continued to agree, after 1831, as they did before\r\nthat time, that the Constitution of the United States was the supreme\r\nlaw of the land, there would have been no fatal sectional quarrel, no\r\nsecession, and no war between the North and South.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe immediate surrender everywhere of the Confederates in obedience to\r\nthe orders of their generals was an imposing spectacle. There was no\r\nguerilla warfare. The Confederates accepted their defeat in good faith\r\nand have ever since been absolutely loyal to the United States\r\nGovernment, but they have never changed their minds as to the justice of\r\nthe cause they fought for. They fought for liberty regulated by law, and\r\nagainst the idea that there can be, under our system, any higher law\r\nthan the Constitution of our country. That the Constitution should\r\nalways be the supreme law of the land, they still believe, and the\r\nphilosophic student of past and current history should be gratified to\r\nsee the tenacity with which Southern people still cling to that idea. It\r\nsuggests that not only will the Southerners be always ready to stand for\r\nour country against a foreign foe, but that whenever our institutions\r\nshall be assailed, as they will often be hereafter by visionaries who\r\nare impatient of restraints, the cause of liberty, regulated by law,\r\nwill find staunch defenders in the Southern section of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION, LINCOLN-JOHNSON PLAN AND CONGRESSIONAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's theory was that acts of secession were void, and\r\nthat when the seceded States came back into the Union those who were\r\nentitled to vote, by the laws existing at the date of the attempted\r\nsecession, and had been pardoned, should have, and should control, the\r\nright of suffrage. Mr. Lincoln had acted on this theory in Tennessee,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas, and he further advised Congress, in his message of\r\nDecember, 1863, that this was his plan. Congress, after a long debate,\r\nresponded in July, 1864, by an act claiming for itself power over\r\nReconstruction. The President answered by a pocket veto, and after that\r\nveto Mr. Lincoln was, in November, 1864, re-elected on a platform\r\nextolling his \"practical wisdom,\" etc. Congress, during the session that\r\nbegan in December, 1864, did not attempt to reassert its authority but\r\nadjourned, March 4, 1865, in sight of the collapse of the Confederacy,\r\nleaving the President an open field for his declared policy.\r\n\r\nBut unhappily, on the 14th of April, 1865, Mr. Lincoln was assassinated,\r\nand his death just at this time was the most appalling calamity that\r\never befell the American people. The blow fell chiefly upon the South,\r\nand it was the South the assassin had thought to benefit.\r\n\r\nHad the great statesman lived he might, and it is fully believed he\r\nwould, like Washington, have achieved a double success. Washington,\r\nsuccessful in war, was successful in guiding his country through the\r\nfirst eight stormy years of its existence under a new constitution.\r\nLincoln had guided the country through four years of war, and the Union\r\nwas now safe. With Lee's surrender the war was practically at an end.\r\n\r\nGideon Welles says that on the 10th of April, 1865, Mr. Lincoln, \"while\r\nI was with him at the White House, was informed that his fellow-citizens\r\nwould call to congratulate him on the fall of Richmond and surrender of\r\nLee; but he requested their visit should be delayed that he might have\r\ntime to put his thoughts on paper, for he desired that his utterances on\r\nsuch an occasion should be deliberate and not liable to misapprehension,\r\nmisinterpretation, or misconstruction. He therefore addressed the people\r\non the following evening, Tuesday the 11th, in a carefully prepared\r\nspeech intended to promote harmony and union.\r\n\r\n\"In this remarkable speech, delivered three days before his\r\nassassination, he stated he had prepared a plan for the reinauguration\r\nof the sectional authority and reconstruction in 1863, which would be\r\nacceptable to the executive government, and that every member of the\r\ncabinet fully approved the plan,\" etc.[88]\r\n\r\n  [88] Gideon Welles in an essay, \"Lincoln and Johnson,\" _The Galaxy_,\r\n  April, 1872.\r\n\r\nIn view of his death three days later, this, his last and deliberate\r\npublic utterance, may be regarded as Abraham Lincoln's will, devising as\r\na legacy to his countrymen his plan of reconstruction. That plan in the\r\nhands of his successor was defeated by a partisan and radical Congress.\r\nThat it was a wise plan the world now knows.\r\n\r\nSenator John Sherman, of Ohio, was one of the most influential of those\r\nwho succeeded in defeating it, and yet he lived to say, in his book\r\npublished in 1895,[89] Andrew Johnson \"adopted substantially the plan\r\nproposed and acted on by Mr. Lincoln. After this long lapse of time I am\r\nconvinced that Mr. Johnson's scheme of reorganization was wise and\r\njudicious. It was unfortunate that it had not the sanction of Congress\r\nand that events soon brought the President and Congress into hostility.\"\r\n\r\n  [89] \"John Sherman's Recollections,\" vol. I, p. 361.\r\n\r\nAnd the present senator, Shelby Cullom, of Illinois, who as a member of\r\nthe House of Representatives voted to overthrow the Lincoln-Johnson plan\r\nof Reconstruction, has furnished us further testimony. He says in his\r\nbook, published in 1911:[90]\r\n\r\n  [90] \"Fifty Years of Public Service,\" Cullom, p. 146.\r\n\r\n\"To express it in a word, the motive of the opposition to the Johnson\r\nplan of Reconstruction was a firm conviction that its success would\r\nwreck the Republican party and, by restoring the Democracy to power,\r\nbring back Southern supremacy and Northern vassalage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican party, then dominant in Congress, felt when confronting\r\nReconstruction that it was facing a crisis in its existence. The\r\nDemocratic party, unitedly opposed to negro suffrage, was still in\r\nNorthern States a power to be reckoned with. Allied with the Southern\r\nwhites, that old party might again control the government unless, by\r\ngiving the negro the ballot, the Republicans could gain, as Senator\r\nSumner said, the \"allies it needed.\" But the masses at the North were\r\nopposed to negro suffrage, and only two or three State constitutions\r\nsanctioned it. Indeed, it may be safely said that when Congress convened\r\nin December, 1865, a majority of the people of the North were ready to\r\nfollow Johnson and approve the Lincoln plan of Reconstruction. But the\r\nextremists in both branches of the Congress had already determined to\r\ndefeat the plan and to give the ballot to the ex-slave. To prepare the\r\nmind of the Northern people for their programme, they had resolved to\r\nrekindle the passions of the war, which were now smouldering, and\r\nutilize all the machinery, military and civilian, that Congress could\r\nmake effective.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson,[91] who as vice-president now succeeded to the\r\npresidency, though a man of ability, had little personal influence and\r\nnone of Lincoln's tact. Johnson retained Lincoln's cabinet, and\r\nMcCullough, who was Secretary of the Treasury under both presidents,\r\nsays in his \"Men and Measures of Half a Century,\" p. 378:\r\n\r\n  [91] The final estimate of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy under\r\n  both Lincoln and Johnson, is this: \"He (Johnson) has been faithful to\r\n  the Constitution, although his administrative capabilities and\r\n  management may not equal some of his predecessors. Of measures he was a\r\n  good judge but not always of men.\"--\"Diary of Gideon Welles,\" vol. III,\r\n  p. 556.\r\n\r\n\"The very same instrument for restoring the national authority over\r\nNorth Carolina and placing her where she stood before her secession,\r\nwhich had been approved by Mr. Lincoln, was, by Mr. Stanton, presented\r\nat the first cabinet which was held at the executive mansion after Mr.\r\nLincoln's death, and, having been carefully considered at two or three\r\nmeetings, was adopted as the Reconstruction policy of the\r\nadministration.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson carried out this plan. All the eleven seceding States repealed\r\ntheir ordinances of secession. Their voters, from which class many\r\nleaders had been excluded by the presidential proclamation, all took\r\nthe oath of allegiance, and reconstructed their State governments. From\r\nmost of the reconstructed States, senators and representatives were in\r\nWashington asking to be seated when Congress convened, December 4, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe presidential plan of Reconstruction had been promptly accepted by\r\nthe people of the prostrate States. Almost without exception they had,\r\nwhen permitted, taken the oath and returned to their allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe wretchedness of these people in the spring of 1865 was\r\nindescribable. The labor system on which they depended for most of their\r\nmoney-producing crops was destroyed. Including the disabled, twenty per\r\ncent of the whites, who would now have been bread-winners, were gone.\r\nThe credit system had been universal, and credit was gone. Banks were\r\nbankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. Provisions were\r\nscarce and money even scarcer. Many landholders had not even plough\r\nstock with which to make a crop.\r\n\r\nThere was some cotton, however, that had escaped the ravages of war, and\r\na large part of this also escaped the rapacious United States agents,\r\nwho were seizing it as Confederate property. This cotton was a godsend.\r\nThere was another supply of money that came from an unexpected source.\r\nThe old anti-slavery controversy had made it seem perfectly clear to\r\nmany moneyed men, North, that free labor was always superior to slave\r\nlabor; and now, when cotton was bringing a good price, enterprising men\r\ncarried their money, altogether some hundreds of thousands of dollars,\r\ninto the several cotton States, to buy plantations and make cotton with\r\nfree negro labor. Free negro labor was not a success. Those who had\r\nreckoned on it lost their money; but this money went into circulation\r\nand was helpful.\r\n\r\nAbove all else loomed the negro problem. Five millions of whites and\r\nthree and a half millions of blacks were to live together. Thomas\r\nJefferson had said, \"Nothing is more certainly written in the Book of\r\nFate than that these people are to be free; _nor is it less certain that\r\nthe two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government_.\r\n_Nature, habit, opinion have drawn indelible lines between them._\"[92]\r\nAnd it may truly be said of Jefferson that he was, as quite recently he\r\nwas declared to be by Dr. Schurman, President of Cornell University, the\r\n\"apostle of reason, and reason alone.\"\r\n\r\n  [92] \"Jefferson's Works,\" vol. I, p. 48.\r\n\r\nWhat system of laws could Southern conventions and legislatures frame,\r\nthat would enable them to accomplish what Jefferson had declared was\r\nimpossible? This was the question before these bodies when called\r\ntogether in 1865-66 by Johnson to rehabilitate their States. Two dangers\r\nconfronted them. One was, armed bands of negroes, headed by returning\r\nnegro soldiers. Mr. Lincoln had feared this. Early in April of that very\r\nyear, 1865, he said to General Butler: \"I can hardly believe that the\r\nSouth and North can live in peace unless we can get rid of the negroes,\r\nwhom we have armed and disciplined, and who have fought with us, to the\r\namount, I believe, of one hundred and fifty thousand.\" Mississippi, and\r\nperhaps one other State, to guard against the danger from this source,\r\nenacted that negroes were only to bear arms when licensed. This law was\r\nto be fiercely attacked.\r\n\r\nThe other chief danger was that idleness among the negroes would lead to\r\ncrime. It soon became apparent that the negro idea was that freedom\r\nmeant freedom from work. They would not work steadily, even for their\r\nNorthern friends, who were offering ready money for labor in their\r\ncotton fields, and multitudes were loitering in towns and around\r\nFreedmen's Bureau offices. Nothing seemed better than the old-time\r\nremedies, apprenticeship and vagrancy laws, then found in every body of\r\nBritish or American statutes. These laws Southern legislatures copied,\r\nwith what appeared to be necessary modifications, and these laws were\r\nsoon assailed as evidence of an intent to reduce the negro again to\r\nslavery. Mr. James G. Blaine, in his \"Twenty Years,\" selected the\r\nAlabama statutes for his attack. In the writer's book, \"Why the Solid\r\nSouth,\" pp. 31-36, the Alabama statutes cited by Mr. Blaine are shown to\r\nbe very similar to and largely copied from the statutes of Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Lincoln been living he would have sympathized with these\r\nSouthern law-makers in their difficult task. But to the radicals in\r\nCongress nothing could have been satisfactory that did not give Mr.\r\nSumner's party the \"allies it needed.\"\r\n\r\nThe first important step of the Congress that convened December 4, 1865,\r\nwas to refuse admission to the congressmen from the States reconstructed\r\nunder the Lincoln-Johnson plan, and pass a joint resolution for the\r\nappointment of a Committee of Fifteen to inquire into conditions in\r\nthose States.\r\n\r\nThe temper of that Congress may be gauged by the following extract from\r\nthe speech of Mr. Shellabarger, of Ohio, on the passage of the joint\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n\"They framed iniquity and universal murder into law.... Their pirates\r\nburned your unarmed commerce on the sea. They carved the bones of your\r\ndead heroes into ornaments, and drank from goblets made out of their\r\nskulls. They poisoned your fountains; put mines under your soldiers'\r\nprisons; organized bands, whose leaders were concealed in your homes;\r\nand commissions ordered the torch and yellow fever to be carried to your\r\ncities and to your women and children. They planned one universal\r\nbonfire of the North from Lake Ontario to the Missouri,\" etc.\r\n\r\nCongress, while refusing admission to senators elected by the\r\nlegislatures of the reconstructed States, was permitting these very\r\nbodies to pass on amendments to the Federal Constitution; and such votes\r\nwere counted. Congress now proposed the Fourteenth Amendment, Section\r\nIII of which provided that no person should hold office under the United\r\nStates who, having taken an oath, as a Federal or State officer, to\r\nsupport the Constitution, had subsequently engaged in the war against\r\nthe Union. The Southerners would not vote for a provision that would\r\ndisfranchise their leaders; they refused to ratify the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment, and this helped further to inflame the radicals of the North.\r\n\r\nAfter the Committee of Fifteen had been appointed, Congress proceeded to\r\nput the reconstructed States under military control. In the debate on\r\nthe measure, February 18, 1867, James A. Garfield, who was, at a later\r\ndate, to become generous and conservative, said exultingly: \"This bill\r\nsets out by laying its hands on the rebel governments and taking the\r\nvery breath of life out of them; in the next place, it puts the bayonet\r\nat the breast of every rebel in the South; in the next place, it leaves\r\nin the hands of Congress utterly and absolutely the work of\r\nReconstruction.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Congress did its work. Lincoln was in his grave, and Johnson, even\r\nwith his vetoes, was powerless. By the acts of March 2 and March 23,\r\n1867, the reconstructed governments were swept away. Universal suffrage\r\nwas given to the negro and most of the prominent whites were\r\ndisfranchised.\r\n\r\nThe first suffrage bill was for the District of Columbia, during the\r\ndebate on which Senator Sumner said: \"Now, to my mind, nothing is\r\nclearer than the absolute necessity of suffrage for all colored persons\r\nin the disorganized States. It will not be enough, if you give it to\r\nthose who can read and write; you will not in this way acquire the\r\nvoting force you need there for the protection of Unionists, whether\r\nwhite or black. You will not acquire the new allies who are essential to\r\nthe national cause.\"\r\n\r\nIn the forty-first Congress, beginning March 4, 1871, the twelve\r\nreconstructed States, including West Virginia, were represented by\r\ntwenty-two Republicans and two Democrats in the Senate, and forty-eight\r\nRepublicans and twelve Democrats in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's \"new allies\" were ready to answer to the roll-call.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Congress had convened in December, 1865, its radical leaders were\r\nalready bent on universal suffrage for the negro, but the Northern mind\r\nwas not yet prepared for so radical a measure. The \"Committee of\r\nFifteen\" was the first step in the programme, which was to hold the\r\nSouthern States out of the Union and make an appeal to the passions and\r\nprejudices of Northern voters in the congressional elections of\r\nNovember, 1866. Valuable material for the coming campaign was already\r\nbeing furnished by the agents of the Freedmen's Bureau. These\r\n\"adventurers, broken down preachers, and politicians,\" as Senator\r\nFessenden, of Maine, called them, were, and had been for some time,\r\nreporting \"outrages,\" swearing negroes into midnight leagues, and\r\nselecting the offices they hoped to fill.\r\n\r\nBut the chief source of the material relied upon in the congressional\r\ncampaign of 1866 to exasperate the North, and prod voters to the point\r\nof sanctioning negro suffrage in the South, was the official information\r\nfrom the Committee of Fifteen. Its subcommittee of three, to take\r\ntestimony as to Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, and Arkansas, were _all Republicans_. The doings of this\r\nsubcommittee in Alabama illustrate their methods. Only five persons, who\r\nclaimed to be citizens, were examined. These were all Republican\r\npoliticians. The testimony of each was bitterly partisan. \"Under the\r\ngovernment of the State as it then existed, no one of these witnesses\r\ncould hope for official preferment. When this Reconstruction plan had\r\nbeen completed the first of these five witnesses became governor of his\r\nState; the second became a senator in Congress; the third secured a life\r\nposition in one of the departments in Washington; the fourth became a\r\ncircuit judge in Alabama, and the fifth a judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe District of Columbia--all as Republicans. There was no Democrat in\r\nthe subcommittee which examined these gentlemen, to cross-examine them;\r\nand not a citizen of Alabama was called before that subcommittee to\r\nconfute or explain their evidence.\"[93]\r\n\r\n  [93] \"Why the Solid South,\" p. 20.\r\n\r\nWith the material gathered by these means and from these sources, the\r\nhonest voters of the North were deluded into the election of a Congress\r\nthat went to Washington, in December, 1866, armed with authority to pass\r\nthe Reconstruction laws of March, 1867.\r\n\r\nSouthern counsels were now much divided. Many good men, like Governor\r\nBrown, of Georgia; General Longstreet and ex-Senator Albert Gallatin\r\nBrown, of Mississippi, advised acquiescence and assistance, \"not because\r\nwe approve the policy of Reconstruction, but because it is the best we\r\ncan do.\" These advisers hoped that good men, well known to the negroes,\r\nmight control them for the country's good; and zealous efforts were made\r\nalong this line in every State, but they were futile. The blacks had\r\nalready, before they got the suffrage, accepted the leadership of those\r\nclaiming to be the \"men who had freed them.\" These leaders were not only\r\nbureau agents but army camp-followers; and there was still another\r\nbrood, who espied from afar a political Eden in the prostrate States\r\nand forthwith journeyed to it. All these Northern adventurers were\r\ncalled \"carpet-baggers\"--they carried their worldly goods in their\r\nhand-bags. The Southerners who entered into a joint-stock business with\r\nthem became \"scalawags.\" These people mustered the negroes into leagues,\r\nand everywhere whispered it into their ears that the aim of the Southern\r\nwhites was to reenslave them.\r\n\r\nPolitics in the South in the days before the war had always been more or\r\nless intense, partly because there were so many who had leisure, and\r\npartly because the general rule was joint political discussions. The\r\nseams that had divided Whigs and Democrats, Secessionists and Union men,\r\nhad not been entirely closed up, even by the melting fires of the Civil\r\nWar. Old feuds for a time played their part in Southern politics, even\r\nafter March, 1867. These old feuds made it difficult for Southern whites\r\nto get together as a race; and, in fact, conservative men dreaded the\r\nidea. It tended toward an actual race war which, for many years, had\r\nbeen a nightmare; but in every reconstructed State the negro and his\r\nallies finally forced the race issue.\r\n\r\nThe new rulers not only increased taxes and misappropriated the revenues\r\nof counties, cities, and States; they bartered away the credit of State\r\nafter State. Some of the States, after they were redeemed, scaled their\r\ndebts by compromising with creditors; others have struggled along with\r\ntheir increased burdens.\r\n\r\nThere were hundreds of negro policemen, constables, justices of the\r\npeace, and legislators who could not write their names. Justice was in\r\nmany localities a farce. Ex-slaves became judges, representatives in\r\nCongress, and United States senators. The eleven Confederate States had\r\nbeen divided into military districts. Many of the officers and men who\r\nwere scattered over the country to uphold negro rule sympathized with\r\nthe whites and evidenced their sympathy in various ways. Others, either\r\nbecause they were radicals at heart, or to commend themselves to their\r\nsuperiors, who were some of them aspiring to political places, were\r\nsuper-serviceable; and it was not uncommon for a military officer, in a\r\ncase where a negro was a party, to order a judge to leave the bench and\r\nhimself take the place. In communities where negro majorities were\r\noverwhelming there were usually two factions, and when political\r\ncampaigns were on agents for these clans often scoured the fields clear\r\nof laborers to recruit their marching bands. In cities these bands made\r\nnight hideous with shouts and the noise of fifes and drums. The negro\r\nwould tolerate no defection from his ranks to the whites, and negro\r\nwomen were more intolerant than the men. It sometimes happened that a\r\nbloody clash between the races was imminent when white men sought to\r\nprotect a negro who had dared to speak in favor of the Democratic and\r\nConservative party. In truth, the civilization of the South was being\r\nchanged from white to negroid.\r\n\r\nThe final triumph of good government in all the States was at last\r\naccomplished by accepting the race issue, as in Alabama in 1874. The\r\nfirst resolution in the platform of the \"Democratic and Conservative\r\nparty\" in that State then was, \"The radical and dominant faction of the\r\nRepublican party in this State persistently, and by fraudulent\r\nrepresentations, have inflamed the passions and prejudices of the\r\nnegroes, as a race, against the white people, and have thereby made it\r\nnecessary for the white people to unite and act together in self-defence\r\nand for the preservation of white civilization.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of North Carolina recovered the right of self-government in\r\n1870. Other States followed from time to time, the last two being\r\nLouisiana and South Carolina in 1877.\r\n\r\nEdwin L. Godkin, who was for long at the head of the _Nation_ and the\r\n_Evening Post_, of New York, is thought by some competent judges to have\r\nbeen the ablest editor this country has ever had. After the last of the\r\nnegro governments set up in the South had passed away, looking back over\r\nthe whole bad business, Mr. Godkin, in a letter to his friend Charles\r\nEliot Norton, written from Sweet Springs, West Virginia, September 3,\r\n1877, said: \"I do not see in short how the negro is ever to be worked\r\ninto a system of government for which you and I could have much\r\nrespect.\"[94]\r\n\r\n  [94] Ogden's \"Life and Letters of Edwin Lawrence Godkin,\" vol. II, p.\r\n  114.\r\n\r\nGarrison is dead. At the centenary of his birth, December 12, 1904, an\r\neffort was made to arouse enthusiasm. There was only a feeble response;\r\nbut we still have extremists. Professor Josiah Royce, of Harvard, in\r\n\"Race Questions\" (1906), speaking of race antipathies as \"trained\r\nhatred,\" says, pp. 48-49: \"We can remember that they are childish\r\nphenomena in our lives, phenomena on a level with the dread of snakes or\r\nof mice, phenomena that we share with the cats and with the dogs, not\r\nnoble phenomena, but caprices of our complex nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH UNDER SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now more than thirty years, whites and blacks, both free, have lived\r\ntogether in the reconstructed States. In some of them there have been\r\nlocal clashes, but in none of them has there been race war, predicted by\r\nJefferson and feared by Lincoln; and there probably never will be such a\r\nwar, unless it shall come through the intervention of such an outside\r\nforce as produced in the South the conflict between the races at the\r\npolls in 1868-76.\r\n\r\nEvery State government set up under the plan of Congress had wrought\r\nruin, and the ruin was always more complete where the negroes were most\r\nnumerous, as in South Carolina and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe rule of the carpet-bagger and the negro was now superseded by\r\ngovernments based on Abraham Lincoln's idea, the idea he expressed in\r\nthe debate with Douglas in 1858, when he said: \"While they [the two\r\nraces] do remain together _there must be the position of inferior and\r\nsuperior_, and I, as much as any other man, _am in favor of having the\r\nsuperior position assigned to the white man_.\"\r\n\r\nConducted on this basis, the present governments in the reconstructed\r\nStates have endured now for periods varying from thirty-six to forty-two\r\nyears, and in every State, without any exception, the prosperity of both\r\nwhites and blacks has been wonderful, and this in spite of the still\r\nexistent abnormal animosities engendered by congressional\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn the present State governments the race problem seems to have reached,\r\nin its larger lines, its only practicable solution. There is still,\r\nhowever, much friction between whites and blacks. Higher culture among\r\nthe masses, especially of the dominant race, and wise leadership in both\r\nraces, will in time minimize this, but it is not to be expected, nor is\r\nit ever to be desired, that racial antipathies should entirely cease to\r\nexist. The result of such cessation would be amalgamation, a solution\r\nthat American whites will never tolerate.\r\n\r\nDeportation, as a solution of the negro problem, is impracticable. Mr.\r\nLincoln, much as he desired the separation of the races, could not\r\naccomplish it, even when he had all the war power of the government in\r\nhis hands. He was, as we have seen, unable to find a country that would\r\ntake the 3,500,000 of blacks then in the seceded States. Now, there are\r\nin the South, including Delaware, according to the census of 1910,\r\n8,749,390, and, quite naturally, the American negro is more unwilling\r\nthan ever to leave America.\r\n\r\nAnother solution sometimes suggested in the South is the repeal of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment, which declares that the negro shall not be deprived\r\nof the ballot because of his race, but agitation for this would appear\r\nto be worse than useless.\r\n\r\nThe negro vote in the reconstructed States is, and has for years been,\r\nquite small, not large enough to be considered a factor in any of them.\r\nOne cause of this is that the whites enforce against the blacks rigidly\r\nthe tests required by law, but the chief reason is, that the negro, who\r\nis qualified, does not often apply for registration. He finds work now\r\nmore profitable than voting. He can not, he knows, control, nor can he,\r\nif disposed to do so, sell his ballot as he once did. One of the most\r\nsignal and durable evils of Congressional Reconstruction was the utter\r\ndebasement of the suffrage in eleven States where the ballot had\r\nformerly been notably pure. Gideon Welles saw clearly when he said in\r\nhis diary, June 23, 1867 (p. 102, vol. III): \"Under the pretence of\r\nelevating the negro the radicals are degrading the whites and debasing\r\nthe elective franchise, bringing elections into contempt.\" During the\r\nrule of the negro and the alien, in every black county, where the negro\r\nmajority was as two to one, there were, as a rule, two Republican\r\ncandidates for every fat office, and an election meant, for the negro, a\r\ngolden harvest. Rival candidates were mercilessly fleeced by their black\r\nconstituencies, and the belief South is that as a rule the\r\ncarpet-baggers, in their hegira, returned North as poor as when they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nIn the Reconstruction era the whites fought fraud with fraud; and even\r\nafter recovering control they, the whites, felt justified in continuing\r\nto defraud the negro of his vote. To restore the purity of the\r\nballot-box was the chief reason for the amendments to State\r\nconstitutions, by means of which amendments, having in view the\r\nlimitations of the Federal Constitution, as many negroes and as few\r\nwhites as was practicable were excluded.\r\n\r\nThis accounts in part for the smallness of the negro vote South. A more\r\npotent reason is that the Democratic party, dominated by whites, selects\r\nits candidates in primaries; and the negro, seeing no chance to win,\r\ndoes not care to pay a poll tax or otherwise qualify for registration.\r\n\r\nSouthern whites have now for more than three decades been governing the\r\nblacks in their midst. It is the most difficult task that has ever been\r\nundertaken in all the history of popular government, but sad experience\r\nhas demonstrated that legal restriction of the negro vote in the South\r\nthere must be.\r\n\r\nParty spirit tends always to blind the vision, and, as we have seen in\r\nthis review of the past, it often stifles conscience; and this even\r\nwhere the masses of the people are approximately homogeneous. Southern\r\nstatesmen are now dealing not only with party spirit, but with\r\nperpetual race friction manifesting itself in various forms. Failure\r\nthere must be in minor matters and in certain localities; the progress\r\nthat has been made can only be fairly estimated by considering general\r\nresults. Those who sympathize with the South think they see there among\r\nthe whites a growing spirit of altruism, begotten of responsibility, and\r\nthis promises much for the amelioration of race friction.\r\n\r\nSince obtaining control of their State governments the whites in the\r\nSouthern States have as a rule increased appropriations for common\r\nschools by at least four hundred per cent, and though paying themselves\r\nby far the greater proportion of these taxes, they have continued to\r\ndivide revenues pro rata between the white and colored schools.\r\n\r\nIndustrial results have been amazing. The following figures, taken from\r\nthe Annual Blue Book, 1911 edition, of the _Manufacturers' Record_,\r\nBaltimore, Maryland, include West Virginia among the reconstructed\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe population of these States was, in 1880, 13,608,703; in 1910,\r\n23,613,533.\r\n\r\nManufacturing capital, 1880, $147,156,624. In 1900--twenty years--it was\r\n$1,019,056,200.\r\n\r\nCotton crop, whole South, 1880, 5,761,252 bales. In 1911 it was about\r\n15,000,000.\r\n\r\nOf this cotton crop Southern mills took, in 1880, 321,337 bales, and in\r\n1910, 2,344,343 bales.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the twelve reconstructed States cut, of lumber, board measure,\r\n2,981,274,000 feet; and in 1909 22,445,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\nTheir output of pig-iron was, in 1880, 264,991 long tons; in 1910,\r\n3,048,000 tons. The assessed value of taxable property was, in 1880,\r\n$2,106,971,271; in 1910, $6,522,195,139.\r\n\r\nThe negro, though the white man, with his superior energy and capacity,\r\nfar outstrips him, has shared in this material prosperity. His property\r\nin these States has been estimated as high as $500,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade, 1900-1910, the white population of the South\r\nincreased by 24.4 per cent, while the negro population in the same\r\nStates increased only 10.4 per cent. There has been a very considerable\r\ngain of whites over blacks since 1880, the result largely of a greater\r\nnatural increase of whites over blacks, immigrants not counted. All\r\nthis indicates that the negro problem is gradually being minimized.\r\n\r\nTaken in the aggregate, the shortcomings of the negro are numerous and\r\nregrettable, but not greater than was to be expected. The general\r\nadvance of an inferior race will never equal that of one which is\r\nsuperior by nature and already centuries ahead. The laggard and\r\nthriftless among the inferior people will naturally be more, and it is\r\nfrom these classes that prison houses are filled.\r\n\r\nThere is a very considerable class of negroes who are improving mentally\r\nand morally, but improvidence is a characteristic of the race, and very\r\nmany of them, even though they labor more or less steadily, will never\r\naccumulate. The third class, much larger than among the whites, is\r\ncomposed of those who are idle, dissipated, and criminal. Taken\r\naltogether, however, what Booker Washington says is true: \"There cannot\r\nbe found, in the civilized or uncivilized world, a like number of\r\nnegroes whose economic, educational, and religious life is so far\r\nadvanced as that of the ten millions within this country.\"[95] This\r\nadvancement is one of the results of slavery. When the negroes come to\r\nrecognize this, as some of their leaders already do,[96] and come to\r\nappreciate the advantages for further improvement they have had since\r\ntheir emancipation, they will cease to repine over the bondage of their\r\nancestors. There were undoubtedly evils in slavery, but, after all,\r\nthere was some reason in the advice given by the good Spanish Bishop Las\r\nCasas to the King of Spain--that it would be rightful to enslave and\r\nthus Christianize and civilize the African savage. Herbert Spencer,\r\n\"Illustrations of Universal Progress\" (p. 444), says: \"Hateful though it\r\nis to us, and injurious as it would be now, slavery was once beneficial,\r\nwas one of the _necessary phases of human progress_.\"\r\n\r\n  [95] Pickett, pp. 399-400.\r\n\r\n  [96] \"The Negro Problem,\" Pickett, 1909, pp. 399-400.\r\n\r\nSir Harry Johnston, African explorer and student of the negro race, in\r\nboth the old and the new world, and perhaps the most eminent authority\r\non a question he has, in a fashion, made his own, says: \"Intellectually,\r\nand perhaps physically, he (the negro) has attained the highest degree\r\nof advancement as yet in the United States.\"[97]\r\n\r\n  [97] \"The Negro in the New World,\" Sir Harry Johnston, p. 478.\r\n\r\n\"In Alabama (most of all) the American negro is seen at his best, as\r\npeasant, peasant proprietor, artisan, professional man, and member of\r\nsociety.\"[98]\r\n\r\n  [98] _Ib._, p. 470.\r\n\r\nRace animosities are now abnormal, both South and North. The prime\r\nreasons for this are two:\r\n\r\n1. The bitter conflict during reconstruction for race supremacy and the\r\nfalse hopes once held out to the negro of ultimate social equality with\r\nthe whites. Among the early measures of congressional reconstruction was\r\na \"civil rights\" enactment which the negroes regarded as giving to them\r\nall the rights of the white man. Their Supreme Court in Alabama decided,\r\nin \"Burns vs. The State,\" that the \"civil rights\" laws conferred the\r\nright to intermarriage. Negroes, North, no doubt also believed in this\r\nconstruction. But the Supreme Court of the United States later held that\r\nthe States, and not Congress, had jurisdiction over the marriage\r\nrelation within the States. All the Southern and a number of the\r\nNorthern States have since forbidden the intermarriage of whites and\r\nblacks, and so the negro's hopes of equal rights in this regard have\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThis disappointment and his utter failure to secure the social equality\r\nthat once seemed his, have tended to embitter the negro against the\r\nwhite man.\r\n\r\n2. Whites have been embittered against blacks by the frequency in later\r\nyears of the crime of the negro against white women. This horrible\r\noffence began to be common in the South some thirty-two or three years\r\nsince, or perhaps a little earlier, and somewhat later it appeared in\r\nthe North, where it seems to have been as common, negro population\r\nconsidered, as in the South. The crime was almost invariably followed by\r\nlynching, which, however, was not always for the same crime. The\r\nfollowing is the list of lynchings in the sections, as kept by the\r\n_Chicago Tribune_ since it began to compile them:\r\n\r\n1885          184\r\n\r\n1886          138\r\n\r\n1887          122\r\n\r\n1888          142\r\n\r\n1889          176\r\n\r\n1890          127\r\n\r\n1891          192\r\n\r\n1892          205\r\n\r\n1893          200\r\n\r\n1894          190\r\n\r\n1895          171\r\n\r\n1896          181\r\n\r\n1897          166\r\n\r\n1898          127\r\n\r\n1899          107\r\n\r\n1900          107\r\n\r\n1901          185\r\n\r\n1902           96\r\n\r\n1903          104\r\n\r\n1904           87\r\n\r\n1905           66\r\n\r\n1906           66\r\n\r\n1907           68\r\n\r\n1908          100\r\n\r\n1909           87\r\n\r\n1910           74\r\n\r\nThe general decrease, while population is increasing, is encouraging;\r\nbut lynching itself is a horrible crime; and lynching for one crime\r\nbegets lynching for another. Of the total number lynched last year, nine\r\nwere whites; sixty-five were negroes, among them three women; and only\r\ntwenty-two were for crimes of negroes against white women. The other\r\ncrimes were murder, attempts to murder, robbery, arson, etc.\r\n\r\nCensus returns indicate that in the country at large the criminality of\r\nthe negro, as compared with that of the white man, is nearly three times\r\ngreater, and that the ratio of negro criminality is much higher North\r\nthan South. Such returns also indicate that so far education has not\r\nlessened negro criminality,[99] but it is not known that any\r\nwell-educated negro has been guilty of the crime against white women.\r\n\r\n  [99] \"The Negro Problem,\" William Pickett, pp. 136-38. Rare Traits,\r\n  etc., of the Negro, Statistician, Prudential Ins. Co. of America, p. 219\r\n  _et seq._\r\n\r\nIn the South the negro is excluded from many occupations for which the\r\nbest of them are fitted, but in the North his industrial conditions are\r\nworse. Fewer occupations are open to him and the wisest members of his\r\nrace are counselling him to remain in the more favorable industrial\r\natmosphere of the South.\r\n\r\nThe dislike of negroes for whites has been increased South by the laws\r\nwhich separate them from whites in schools, public conveyances, etc. But\r\nit is to be remembered that these laws were intended to prevent\r\nintermarriage; they are in part the result of race antipathies. But the\r\nsound reason for them is that they tend to prevent intimacies which, at\r\nthe points where the races are in closest touch with each other, might\r\nresult in intermarriage. Professor E. D. Cope, of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, one of the very highest of American authorities on the\r\nrace question, in a powerful article published in 1890,[100] advocated\r\nthe deportation of the negroes from the South, no matter at what cost.\r\nOtherwise he predicted eventual amalgamation, which would be the\r\ndestruction of a large portion of the finest race in the world.\r\n\r\n  [100] \"Two Perils of the Indo-European,\" _The Open Court_, January 23,\r\n  1890, p. 2052.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis little study now comes to a close. An effort has been made to\r\nsketch briefly in this chapter the difficulties the South has\r\nencountered in dealing with the negro problem, and to outline the\r\nmeasure of success it has achieved. However imperfectly the author may\r\nhave performed his task, it must be clear to the reader that no such\r\nproblem as the present was ever before presented to a self-governing\r\npeople. Never was there so much need of that culture from which alone\r\ncan come a high sense of duty to others. The negro must be encouraged to\r\nbe self-helpful and useful to the community. If he is to do all this and\r\nremain a separate race, he must have leadership among his own people. In\r\nthe Mississippi Black Belt there is now a town of some 4,000 negroes,\r\nMound Bayou, completely organized and prospering. It may be that in the\r\nfuture negroes seeking among themselves the amenities of life may\r\ncongregate into communities of their own, cultivating adjacent lands, as\r\nthe French do in their agricultural villages. Wherever they may be,\r\nthey must practise the civic virtues, honesty, and obedience to law. W.\r\nH. Councill, a negro teacher, of Huntsville, Alabama, said some years\r\nsince in a magazine article: \"When the gray-haired veterans who followed\r\nLee and Jackson pass away, the negro will have lost his best friends.\"\r\nThis is true, but it is hoped that time and culture, while not producing\r\nsocial equality, will allay race animosities and bring the negro other\r\nfriends to take the place of the departing veterans.\r\n\r\nThe white man, with his pride of race, must more and more be made to\r\nfeel that _noblesse oblige_. His sense of duty to others must measure up\r\nto his responsibilities and opportunities. He must accord to the negro\r\nall his rights under the laws as they exist.\r\n\r\nThe South is exerting itself to better its common schools, but it cannot\r\ncompete in this regard with the North. Northern philanthropists are\r\nquite properly contributing to education in the South. They should\r\nconsider well the needs of both races. Any attempt to give to the\r\nnegroes advantages superior to those of the whites, who are now\r\ntreating the negro fairly in this respect, might look like another\r\nattempt to put, in negro language, \"the bottom rail on top.\"\r\n\r\nLooking over the whole field covered by this sketch, it is wonderful to\r\nnote how the chain of causation stretches back into the past.\r\nReconstruction was a result of the war; secession and war resulted from\r\na movement in the North, in 1831, against conditions then existing in\r\nthe South. The negro, the cause of the old quarrel between the sections,\r\nis located now much as he was then. How full of lessons, for both the\r\nSouth and the North, is the history of the last eighty years!\r\n\r\nThere is even a chord that connects the burning of a negro at\r\nCoatesville, Pennsylvania, by an excited mob on the 13th of August,\r\n1911, with the burning of the Federal Constitution at Framingham,\r\nMassachusetts, by that other excited mob of madmen, under Garrison, on\r\nthe fourth day of July, 1854. One body of outlaws was defying the laws\r\nof Pennsylvania; the other was defying the fundamental laws of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abolitionists, mobbed, 71;\r\n    burn U.
