The\r\nAuthor was then at a great Distance from_ London, _and the Publisher of\r\nhis Work, for Reasons needless to repeat, did not think fit to print the\r\nPrefatory Discourse sent along with the Original. But this Piece being\r\nseasonable at all Times for the Perusal of_ Englishmen _and more\r\nparticularly at this Time, I wou'd no longer keep back from the Publick,\r\nwhat I more than conjecture will be acceptable to all true Lovers of\r\ntheir Country._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nTRANSLATOR's\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nMany Books and Papers have been publish'd since the late _Revolution_,\r\ntending to justify the Proceedings of the People of _England_ at that\r\nhappy juncture; by setting in a true Light our just Rights and\r\nLiberties, together with the solid Foundations of our _Constitution:_\r\nWhich, in truth, is not ours only, but that of almost all _Europe_\r\nbesides; so wisely restor'd and establish'd (if not introduced) by the\r\n_Goths_ and _Franks_, whose Descendants we are.\r\n\r\nThese Books have as constantly had some things, called _Answers_,\r\nwritten to them, by Persons of different Sentiments; who certainly\r\neither never seriously consider'd, that the were thereby endeavouring to\r\ndestroy their own Happiness, and overthrow her Majesty's Title to the\r\nCrown: or (if they knew what they did) presumed upon the _Lenity_ of\r\nthat Government they decry'd; which (were there no better Reason) ought\r\nto have recommended it to their Approbation, since it could patiently\r\nbear with such, as were doing all they could to undermine it.\r\n\r\nNot to mention the Railing, Virulency, or personal false Reflections in\r\nmany of those Answers, (which were always the Signs of a weak Cause, or\r\na feeble Champion) some of them asserted the _Divine Right_ of an\r\n_Hereditary Monarch_, and the Impiety of _Resistance_ upon any Terms\r\nwhatever, notwithstanding any _Authorities_ to the contrary.\r\n\r\nOthers (and those the more judicious) deny'd positively, that sufficient\r\n_Authorities_ could be produced to prove, that a _free People_ have a\r\n_just Power_ to defend themselves, by opposing their _Prince_, who\r\nendeavours to oppress and enslave them: And alledged, that whatever was\r\nsaid or done tending that way, proceeded from a Spirit of _Rebellion_,\r\nand _Antimonarchical Principles_.\r\n\r\nTo confute, or convince this last Sort of Arguers (the first not being\r\nworthy to have Notice taken of them) I set about translating the\r\n_Franco-Gallia_ of that most Learned and Judicious _Civilian_, _Francis\r\nHotoman_; a Grave, Sincere and Unexceptionable Author, even in the\r\nOpinion of his Adversaries. This Book gives an Account of the Ancient\r\nFree State of above Three Parts in Four of _Europe_; and has of a long\r\ntime appeared to me so convincing and instructive in those important\r\nPoints he handles, that I could not be idle whilst it remain'd unknown,\r\nin a manner, to _Englishmen_: who, of all People living, have the\r\ngreatest Reason and Need to be thoroughly instructed in what it\r\ncontains; as having, on the one hand, the most to lose, and on the\r\nother, the least Sense of their Right, to that, which hitherto they seem\r\n(at least in a great measure) to have preserv'd.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious to every Reader, that I have taken no great Pains to\r\nwrite elegantly. What I endeavour at, is as plain a Stile as possible,\r\nwhich on this Occasion I take to be the best: For since the Instruction\r\nof Mankind ought to be the principal Drift of all Writers (of History\r\nespecially); whoever writes to the Capacity of most Readers, in my\r\nOpinion most fully answers the End.\r\n\r\nI am not ignorant, how tiresome and difficult a Piece of Work it is to\r\ntranslate, nor how little valued in the World. My Experience has\r\nconvinced me, that 'tis more troublesome and teazing than to write and\r\ninvent at once. The Idiom of the Language out of which one translates,\r\nruns so in the Head, that 'tis next to impossible not to fall frequently\r\ninto it. And the more bald and incorrect the Stile of the Original is,\r\nthe more shall that of the Translation be so too. Many of the Quotations\r\nin this Book are drawn from Priests, Monks, Friars, and Civil Lawyers,\r\nwho minded more, in those barbarous Ages, the Substance than the Stile\r\nof their Writings: And I hope those Considerations may atone for several\r\nFaults, which might be found in my Share of this Work.\r\n\r\nBut I desire not to be misunderstood, as if (whilst I am craving Favour\r\nfor my self) I were making any Apology for such a Number of mercenary\r\nScribblers, Animadverters, and Translators, as pester us in this Age;\r\nwho generally spoil the good Books which fall into their Hands, and\r\nhinder others from obliging the Publick, who otherwise would do it to\r\ngreater Advantage.\r\n\r\nI take this Author to be one of those few, that has had the good Luck to\r\nescape them; and I make use of this Occasion to declare, that the chief\r\nMotive which induces me to send abroad this small Treatise, is a\r\nsincere desire of instructing the only Possessors of true Liberty in the\r\nWorld, what Right and Title that have to that Liberty; of what a great\r\nValue it is; what Misery follows the Loss of it; how easily, if Care be\r\ntaken in time, it may be preserv'd: And if this either opens the Eyes,\r\nor confirms the honourable Resolutions of any of my worthy Countrymen, I\r\nhave gained a glorious End; and done that in my Study, which I shou'd\r\nhave promoted any other way, had I been called to it. I hope to die with\r\nthe Comfort of believing, that _Old England_ will continue to be a free\r\nCountry, and _know_ itself to be _such_; that my Friends, Relations and\r\nChildren, with their Posterity, will inherit their Share of this\r\ninestimable Blessing, and that I have contributed my Part to it.\r\n\r\nBut there is one very great Discouragement under which both I, and all\r\nother Writers and Translators of Books tending to the acquiring or\r\npreserving the publick Liberty, do lie; and that is, the heavy Calumny\r\nthrown upon us, that we are all _Commonwealth's-Men_: Which (in the\r\nordinary Meaning of the Word) amounts to _Haters_ of _Kingly_\r\nGovernment; now without broad, malicious Insinuations, that we are no\r\ngreat Friends of the present.\r\n\r\nIndeed were the _Laity_ of our Nation (as too many of our _Clergy_\r\nunhappily are) to be guided by the Sense of one of our Universities,\r\nsolemnly and publickly declared by the burning of Twenty seven\r\nPropositions (some of them deserving that Censure, but others being the\r\nvery Foundation of all our Civil Rights;) I, and many like me, would\r\nappear to be very much in the wrong. But since the _Revolution_ in\r\nEighty-eight, that we stand upon another and a better Bottom, tho no\r\nother than our own old one, 'tis time that our _Notions_ should be\r\nsuited to our _Constitution_. And truly, as Matters stand, I have often\r\nwondred, either how so many of our Gentlemen, educated under such\r\nPrejudices, shou'd retain any Sense at all of Liberty, for _the hardest\r\nLesson is to unlearn_; [Footnote: St. Chrysostom] or how an Education so\r\ndiametrically opposite to our Bill of Rights, shou'd be so long\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\nMethinks a _Civil Test_ might be contrived, and prove very convenient to\r\ndistinguish those that own the _Revolution Principles_, from such as\r\nTooth and Nail oppose them; and at the same time do fatally propagate\r\nDoctrines, which lay too heavy a Load upon _Christianity_ it self, and\r\nmake us prove our own Executioners.\r\n\r\nThe Names of _Whig_ and _Tory_ will, I am afraid, last as long among us,\r\nas those of _Guelf_ and _Ghibelline_ did in _Italy_. I am sorry for it:\r\nbut to some they become necessary for Distinction Sake; not so much for\r\nthe Principles formerly adapted to each Name, as for particular and\r\nworse Reasons. For there has been such chopping and changing both of\r\nNames and Principles, that we scarce know who is who. I think it\r\ntherefore necessary, in order to appear in my own Colours, to make a\r\npublick Profession of my _Political Faith_; not doubting but it may\r\nagree in several Particulars with that of many worthy Persons, who are\r\nas undeservedly aspers'd as I am.\r\n\r\nMy Notion of a _Whig_, I mean of a real _Whig_ (for the Nominal are\r\nworse than any Sort of Men) is, That he is one who is exactly for\r\nkeeping up to the Strictness of the true old _Gothick Constitution_,\r\nunder the _Three Estates_ of _King_ (or _Queen_) _Lords_ and _Commons_;\r\nthe _Legislature_ being seated in all Three together, the _Executive_\r\nentrusted with the first, but accountable to the whole Body of the\r\nPeople, in Case of Male Administration.\r\n\r\nA true _Whig_ is of Opinion, that the Executive Power has as just a\r\nTitle to the _Allegiance_ and Obedience of the Subject, according to the\r\n_Rules of known Laws enacted by the Legislative_, as the _Subject_ has\r\nto _Protection, Liberty_ and _Property_: And so on the contrary.\r\n\r\nA true _Whig_ is not afraid of the Name of a _Commonwealthsman_, because\r\nso many foolish People, who know not what it means, run it down: The\r\n_Anarchy_ and _Confusion_ which these Nations fell into near Sixty Years\r\nago, and which was _falsly_ called a _Commonwealth_, frightning them out\r\nof the true Construction of the Word. But Queen _Elizabeth_, and many\r\nother of our best Princes, were not scrupulous of calling our Government\r\na _Commonwealth_, even in their solemn Speeches to _Parliament_. And\r\nindeed if it be not one, I cannot tell by what Name properly to call it:\r\nFor where in the very _Frame_ of the _Constitution_, the Good of the\r\n_Whole_ is taken care of by the _Whole_ (as 'tis in our Case) the having\r\na _King_ or _Queen_ at the Head of it, alters not the Case; and the\r\nsoftning of it by calling it a _Limited Monarchy_, seems a Kind of\r\nContradiction in Terms, invented to please some weak and doubting\r\nPersons.\r\n\r\nAnd because some of our _Princes_ in this last Age, did their utmost\r\nEndeavour to destroy this Union and Harmony of the _Three Estates_, and\r\nto be _arbitrary_ or _independent, they_ ought to be looked upon as the\r\n_Aggressors_ upon our Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis drove the other _Two Estates_ (for the Sake of the publick\r\nPreservation) into the fatal Necessity of providing for themselves; and\r\nwhen once the Wheel was set a running, 'twas not in the Power of Man to\r\nstop it just where it ought to have stopp'd. This is so ordinary in all\r\nviolent Motions, whether mechanick or political, that no body can wonder\r\nat it.\r\n\r\nBut no wise Men approved of the ill Effects of those violent Motions\r\neither way, cou'd they have help'd them. Yet it must be owned they have\r\n(as often as used, thro an extraordinary Piece of good Fortune) brought\r\nus back to our old Constitution again, which else had been lost; for\r\nthere are numberless Instances in History of a Downfal from a State of\r\n_Liberty_ to a _Tyranny_, but very few of a Recovery of _Liberty_ from\r\n_Tyranny_, if this last have had any Length of Time to fix it self and\r\ntake Root.\r\n\r\nLet all such, who either thro Interest or Ignorance are Adorers of\r\n_absolute Monarchs_, say what they please; an _English Whig_ can never\r\nbe so unjust to his Country, and to right Reason, as not to be of\r\nOpinion, that in all Civil Commotions, which Side soever is the\r\n_wrongful Aggressor_, is accountable for all the evil Consequences: And\r\nthro the Course of his reading (tho my Lord _Clarendon's_ Books be\r\nthrown into the Heap) he finds it very difficult to observe, that ever\r\nthe People of _England_ took up Arms against their _Prince_, but when\r\nconstrain'd to it by a necessary Care of their _Liberties_ and true\r\n_Constitution_.\r\n\r\n'Tis certainly as much a _Treason_ and _Rebellion_ against this\r\n_Constitution_, and the _known_ Laws, in a _Prince_ to endeavor to break\r\nthro them, as 'tis in the _People_ to rise against him, whilst he keeps\r\nwithin their Bounds, and does his Duty. Our Constitution is a Government\r\nof _Laws_, not of _Persons. Allegiance_ and _Protection_ are Obligations\r\nthat cannot subsist separately; when one fails, the other falls of\r\nCourse. The true Etymology of the word _Loyalty_ (which has been so\r\nstrangely wrested in the late Reigns) is an entire Obedience to the\r\nPrince in all his Commands according to Law; that is, to the _Laws\r\nthemselves_, to which we owe both an active and passive Obedience.\r\n\r\nBy the old and true Maxim, that _the King can do no Wrong_, nobody is so\r\nfoolish as to conclude, that he has not Strength to murder, to offer\r\nViolence to Women, or Power enough to dispossess a Man wrongfully of his\r\nEstate, or that whatever he does (how wicked soever) is just: but the\r\nMeaning is, he has no _lawful Power_ to do such Things; and our\r\nConstitution considers no _Power_ as _irresistible_, but what is\r\n_lawful_.\r\n\r\nAnd since _Religion_ is become a great and universal Concern, and drawn\r\ninto our Government, as it affects every single Man's Conscience; tho my\r\nprivate Opinion, they ought not to be mingled, nor to have any thing to\r\ndo with each other; (I do not speak of our Church Polity, which is a\r\nPart of our State, and dependent upon it) some account must be given of\r\nthat Matter.\r\n\r\n_Whiggism_ is not circumscrib'd and confin'd to any one or two of the\r\n_Religions_ now profess'd in the World, but diffuses it self among all.\r\nWe have known _Jews_, _Turks_, nay, some Papists, (which I own to be a\r\ngreat Rarity) very great Lovers of the Constitution and Liberty; and\r\nwere there rational Grounds to expect, that any Numbers of them cou'd be\r\nso, I shou'd be against using Severities and Distinctions upon Account\r\nof Religion. For a Papist is not dangerous, nor ought to be ill us'd by\r\nany body, because he prays to Saints, believes Purgatory, or the real\r\nPresence in the Eucharist, and pays Divine Worship to an Image or\r\nPicture (which are the common Topicks of our Writers of Controversy\r\nagainst the Papists;) but because Popery sets up a _foreign Jurisdiction\r\nparamount to our Laws_. So that a _real Papist_ can neither be a true\r\n_Governor_ of a _Protestant_ Country, nor a true _Subject_, and besides,\r\nis the most _Priest-Ridden_ Creature in the World: and (when uppermost)\r\ncan bear with no body that differs from him in Opinion; little\r\nconsidering, that whosoever is against _Liberty of Mind_, is, in effect,\r\nagainst _Liberty of Body_ too. And therefore all Penal _Acts_ of\r\n_Parliament_ for Opinions _purely_ religious, which have no Influence on\r\nthe _State_, are so many Encroachments upon _Liberty_, whilst those\r\nwhich restrain Vice and Injustice are against _Licentiousness_.\r\n\r\nI profess my self to have always been a Member of the _Church_ of\r\n_England_ and am for supporting it in all its _Honours_, _Privileges_\r\nand _Revenues_: but as a Christian and a _Whig_, I must have Charity for\r\nthose that differ from me in _religious_ Opinions, whether _Pagans_,\r\n_Turks_, _Jews_, _Papists_, _Quakers_, _Socinians_, _Presbyterians_, or\r\nothers. I look upon _Bigotry_ to have always been the very Bane of human\r\nSociety, and the Offspring of Interest and Ignorance, which has\r\noccasion'd most of the great Mischiefs that have afflicted Mankind. We\r\nought no more to expect to be all of one Opinion, as to the Worship of\r\nthe _Deity_, than to be all of one Colour or Stature. To stretch or\r\nnarrow any Man's Conscience to the Standard of our own, is no less a\r\nPiece of Cruelty than that of _Procrustes_ the Tyrant of _Attica_, who\r\nused to fit his Guests to the Length of his own Iron Bedsted, either by\r\ncutting them shorter, or racking them longer. What just Reason can I\r\nhave to be angry with, to endeavour to curb the natural Liberty, or to\r\nretrench the Civil Advantages of an honest Man (who follows the golden\r\nRule, of _doing to others, as he wou'd have others do to him_, and is\r\nwilling and able to serve the Publick) only because he thinks his Way to\r\nHeaven surer or shorter than mine? No body can tell which of us is\r\nmistaken, till the Day of Judgment, or whether any of us be so (for\r\nthere may be different Ways to the same End, and I am not for\r\ncircumscribing God Almighty's Mercy:) This I am sure of, one shall meet\r\nwith the same Positiveness in Opinion, in some of the Priests of all\r\nthese Sects; The same Want of Charity, engrossing Heaven by way of\r\n_Monopoly_ to their own _Corporation_, and managing it by a joint Stock,\r\nexclusive of all others (as pernicious in Divinity as in trade, and\r\nperhaps more) The same Pretences to _Miracles, Martyrs, Inspirations,\r\nMerits, Mortifications, Revelations, Austerity, Antiquity_, &c. (as all\r\nPersons conversant with History, or that travel, know to be true) and\r\nthis _cui bono_? I think it the Honour of the Reformed Part of the\r\nChristian Profession, and the Church of _England_ in particular, that it\r\npretends to fewer of these unusual and extraordinary Things, than any\r\nother Religion we know of in the World; being convinced, that these are\r\nnot the distinguishing Marks of the Truth of any Religion (I mean, the\r\nassuming obstinate Pretences to them are not;) and it were not amiss, if\r\nwe farther enlarg'd our Charity, when we can do it with Safety, or\r\nAdvantage to the State.\r\n\r\nLet us but consider, how hard and how impolitick it is to condemn all\r\nPeople, but such as think of the Divinity just as we do. May not the\r\nTables of Persecution be turn'd upon us? A _Mahometan_ in _Turky_ is in\r\nthe right, and I (if I carry my own Religion thither) am in the Wrong.\r\nThey will have it so. If the _Mahometan_ comes with me to _Christendom_,\r\nI am in the right, and he in the wrong; and hate each other heartily for\r\ndiffering in Speculations, which ought to have no Influence on Moral\r\nHonesty. Nay, the _Mahometan_ is the more charitable of the two, and\r\ndoes not push his Zeal so far; for the Christians have been more cruel\r\nand severe in this Point than all the World besides. Surely Reprizals\r\nmay be made upon us; as _Calvin_ burnt _Servetus_ at _Geneva_, Queen\r\n_Mary_ burnt _Cranmer_ at _London_. I am sorry I cannot readily find a\r\nmore exact Parallel. The Sword cuts with both Edges. Why, I pray you,\r\nmay we not all be Fellow-Citizens of the World? And provided it be not\r\nthe Principle of one or more Religions to extirpate all others, and to\r\nturn Persecutors when they get Power (for such are not to be endured;) I\r\nsay, why shou'd we offer to hinder any Man from doing with his own Soul\r\nwhat he thinks fitting? Why shou'd we not make use of his Body, Estate,\r\nand Understanding, for the publick Good? Let a Man's Life, Substance,\r\nand Liberty be under the Protection of the Laws; and I dare answer for\r\nhim (whilst his Stake is among us) he will never be in a different\r\nInterest, nor willing to quit this Protection, or to exchange it for\r\n_Poverty, Slavery_, and _Misery_.\r\n\r\nThe thriving of any one _single Person_ by honest Means, is the Thriving\r\nof the _Commonwealth_ wherein he resides. And in what Place soever of\r\nthe World such Encouragement is given, as that in it one may securely\r\nand peaceably enjoy _Property_ and _Liberty_ both of _Mind_ and _Body_;\r\n'tis impossible but that Place must flourish in _Riches_ and in\r\n_People_, which are the _truest Riches_ of any Country.\r\n\r\nBut as, on the one hand, a true _Whig_ thinks that all Opinions purely\r\nspiritual and notional ought to be indulg'd; so on the other, he is for\r\n_severely punishing_ all _Immoralities, Breach_ of _Laws, Violence_ and\r\n_Injustice_. A Minister's Tythes are as much his Right, as any Layman's\r\nEstate can be his; and no Pretence of Religion or Conscience can warrant\r\nthe substracting of them, whilst the Law is in Being which makes them\r\npayable: For a _Whig_ is far from the Opinion, that they are due by any\r\nother Title. It wou'd make a Man's Ears tingle, to hear the _Divine\r\nRight_ insisted upon for any _human Institutions_; and to find God\r\n_Almighty_ brought in as a Principal there, where there is no Necessity\r\nfor it. To affirm, that _Monarchy, Episcopacy, Synods, Tythes_, the\r\n_Hereditary Succession_ to the _Crown_, &c. are _Jure Divino_; is to\r\ncram them down a Man's Throat; and tell him in plain Terms, that he must\r\nsubmit to any of them under all Inconveniencies, whether the Laws of his\r\nCountry are for it or against it. Every _Whig_ owns _Submission_ to\r\nGovernment to be an _Ordinance_ of God. _Submit your selves to every\r\nOrdinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake_, says the Apostle. Where (by the\r\nway) pray take notice, he calls them _Ordinances of Man_; and gives you\r\nthe true Notion, how far any thing can be said to be _Jure Divino_:\r\nwhich is far short of what your high-flown Assertors of the _Jus\r\nDivinum_ wou'd carry it, and proves as strongly for a _Republican_\r\nGovernment as a _Monarchical_; tho' in truth it affects neither, where\r\nthe very Ends of Government are destroyed.\r\n\r\nA right _Whig_ looks upon _frequent Parliaments_ as such a _fundamental_\r\nPart of the Constitution, that even no _Parliament_ can part with this\r\nRight. _High Whiggism_ is for _Annual_ Parliaments, and _Low Whiggism_\r\nfor _Triennial_, with annual Meetings. I leave it to every Man's\r\nJudgment, which of these wou'd be the truest Representative; wou'd\r\nsoonest ease the House of that Number of Members that have Offices and\r\nEmployments, or take Pensions from the Court; is least liable to\r\nCorruption; wou'd prevent exorbitant Expence, and soonest destroy the\r\npernicious Practice of drinking and bribing for Elections, or is most\r\nconformable to ancient Custom. The Law that lately pass'd with so much\r\nStruggle for _Triennial_ Parliaments shall content me, till the\r\n_Legislative_ shall think fit to make them _Annual_.\r\n\r\nBut methinks (and this I write with great Submission and Deference) that\r\n(since the passing that Act) it seems inconsistent with the Reason of\r\nthe thing, and preposterous, for the _first_ Parliament after any\r\nPrince's _Accession_ to the _Crown_, to give the publick Revenue _arising\r\nby Taxes_, for a longer time than that _Parliament's own Duration_. I\r\ncannot see why the Members of the _first_ Parliament shou'd (as the Case\r\nnow stands) engross to themselves all the Power of giving, as well as\r\nall the Merit and Rewards due to such a Gift: and why _succeeding_\r\nParliaments shou'd not, in their turn, have it in their Power to oblige\r\nthe Prince, or to streighten him, if they saw Occasion; and pare his\r\nNails, if they were convinced he made _ill Use_ of such a _Revenue_. I\r\nam sure we have had Instances of this Kind; and a wise Body of Senators\r\nought always to provide against the worst that might happen. The\r\n_Honey-Moon_ of _Government_ is a dangerous Season; the Rights and\r\nLiberties of the People run a greater Risk at that time, thro their own\r\nRepresentatives Compliments and Compliances, than they are ever likely\r\nto do during that Reign: and 'tis safer to break this Practice, when we\r\nhave the Prospect of a good and gracious Prince upon the Throne, than\r\nwhen we have an inflexible Person, who thinks every Offer an Affront,\r\nwhich comes not up to the Height of what his Predecessor had, without\r\nconsidering whether it were well or ill done at first.\r\n\r\nThe Revenues of our Kings, for many Ages, arose out of their\r\n_Crown-Lands_; Taxes on the Subject were raised only for publick\r\nExigencies. But since we have turn'd the Stream, and been so free of\r\nRevenues for Life, arising from _Impositions_ and _Taxes_, we have given\r\nOccasion to our Princes to dispose of their _Crown-Lands_; and depend\r\nfor Maintenance of their Families on such a Sort of Income, as is\r\nthought unjust and ungodly in most Parts of the World, but in\r\n_Christendom_: for many of the arbitrary _Eastern_ Monarchs think so,\r\nand will not eat the Produce of such a Revenue. Now since Matters are\r\nbrought to this pass, 'tis plain that our Princes must subsist suitable\r\nto their high State and Condition, in the best manner we are able to\r\nprovide for them. And whilst the _Calling_ and _Duration_ of Parliaments\r\nwas _precarious_, it might indeed be an _Act of Imprudence_, tho not of\r\n_Injustice_, for any _one Parliament_ to settle such a Sort of _Revenue_\r\nfor Life on the Prince: But at present, when all the World knows the\r\n_utmost Extent_ of a Parliament's _possible_ Duration, it seems\r\ndisagreeable to Reason, and an Encroachment upon the Right of\r\n_succeeding_ Parliaments (for the future) for any _one Parliament_ to do\r\nthat which _another_ cannot undo, or has not Power to do in its turn.\r\n\r\nAn Old _Whig_ is for chusing such Sort of _Representatives_ to serve in\r\nParliament, as have _Estates_ in the Kingdom; and those not fleeting\r\nones, which may be sent beyond Sea by Bills of Exchange by every\r\nPacquet-Boat, but fix'd and permanent. To which end, every Merchant,\r\nBanker, or other money'd Man, who is ambitious of serving his Country as\r\na _Senator_, shou'd have also a competent, visible _Land Estate_, as a\r\nPledge to his _Electors_ that he intends to abide by them, and has the\r\nsame Interest with theirs in the publick Taxes, Gains and Losses. I have\r\nheard and weigh'd the Arguments of those who, in Opposition to this,\r\nurged the Unfitness of such, whose Lands were engaged in Debts and\r\nMortgages, to serve in Parliament, in comparison with the _mony'd Man_\r\nwho had no _Land:_ But those Arguments never convinced me.\r\n\r\nNo Man can be a sincere Lover of Liberty, that is not for increasing and\r\ncommunicating that Blessing to all People; and therefore the giving or\r\nrestoring it not only to our Brethren of _Scotland_ and _Ireland_, but\r\neven to _France_ it self (were it in our Power) is one of the principal\r\nArticles of _Whiggism_. The Ease and Advantage which wou'd be gain'd by\r\n_uniting_ our own Three Kingdoms upon equal Terms (for upon unequal it\r\nwou'd be no _Union_) is so visible, that if we had not the Example of\r\nthose Masters of the World, the _Romans_, before our Eyes, one wou'd\r\nwonder that our own Experience (in the Instance of uniting _Wales_ to\r\n_England_) shou'd not convince us, that altho both Sides wou'd\r\nincredibly gain by it, yet the rich and opulent Country, to which such\r\nan Addition is made, wou'd be the greater Gainer. 'Tis so much more\r\ndesirable and _secure_ to govern by _Love_ and _common Interest_, than\r\nby _Force_; to expect _Comfort_ and _Assistance_, in Times of Danger,\r\nfrom our next Neighbours, than to find them at such a time a _heavy\r\nClog_ upon the Wheels of our Government, and be in dread lest they\r\nshould take that Occasion to shake off an uneasy Yoak: or to have as\r\nmuch need of entertaining a _standing_ Army against our _Brethren_, as\r\nagainst our known and inveterate _Enemies_; that certainly whoever can\r\noppose so publick and apparent Good, must be esteem'd either _ignorant_\r\nto a strange Degree, or to have _other_ Designs in View, which he wou'd\r\nwillingly have brought to Light.\r\n\r\nI look upon her Majesty's asserting the Liberties and Privileges of the\r\n_Free Cities_ in _Germany_, an Action which will shine in History as\r\nbright (at least) as her giving away her first Fruits and Tenths: To the\r\nMerit of which last, some have assumingly enough ascribed all the\r\nSuccesses she has hitherto been blessed with; as if _one Set of Men_\r\nwere the _peculiar_ Care of Providence and all others (even _Kings_ and\r\n_Princes_) were no otherwise fit to be considered by _God Almighty_, or\r\nPosterity, than according to their _Kindness_ to them. But it has been\r\ngenerally represented so, where Priests are the Historians. From the\r\nfirst Kings in the World down to these Days, many Instances might be\r\ngiven of very wicked Princes, who have been extravagantly commended; and\r\nmany excellent ones, whose Memories lie overwhelmed with Loads of Curses\r\nand Calumny, just as they proved Favourers or Discountenancers of\r\nHigh-Church, without regard to their other Virtues or Vices: for\r\nHigh-Church is to be found in all Religions and Sects, from the Pagan\r\ndown to the Presbyterian; and is equally detrimental in every one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA Genuine _Whig_ is for promoting a _general Naturalization_, upon the\r\nfirm Belief, that whoever comes to be incorporated into us, feels his\r\nShare of all our Advantages and Disadvantages, and consequently can have\r\nno Interest but that of the Publick; to which he will always be a\r\nSupport to the best of his Power, by his _Person, Substance_ and\r\n_Advice_. And if it be a Truth (which few will make a Doubt of) that we\r\nare not one _third_ Part peopled (though we are better so in Proportion\r\nthan any other Part of _Europe, Holland_ excepted) and that our Stock of\r\nMen decreases daily thro our Wars, Plantations, and Sea-Voyages; that\r\nthe ordinary Course of Propagation (even in Times of continued Peace and\r\nHealth) cou'd not in many Ages supply us with the Numbers we want; that\r\nthe Security of Civil and Religious Liberty, and of Property, which thro\r\nGod's great Mercy is firmly establish'd among us, will invite new Comers\r\nas fast as we can entertain them; that most of the rest of the World\r\ngroans under the Weight of _Tyranny_, which will cause all that have\r\nSubstance, and a Sense of Honour and Liberty, to fly to Places of\r\nShelter; which consequently would thoroughly people us with useful and\r\nprofitable Hands in a few Years. What should hinder us from an Act of\r\n_General Naturalization_? Especially when we consider, that no _private_\r\nActs of that Kind are refused; but the Expence is so great, that few\r\nattempt to procure them, and the Benefit which the Publick receives\r\nthereby is inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown us the Folly and Falsity of those plausible\r\nInsinuations, that such a Naturalization would take the Bread out of\r\n_Englishmen's_ Mouths. We are convinced, that the greater Number of\r\nWorkmen of one Trade there is in any Town, the more does that Town\r\nthrive; the greater will be the _Demand_ of the Manufacture, and the\r\n_Vent_ to foreign Parts, and the quicker _Circulation_ of the _Coin_.\r\nThe Consumption of the _Produce_ both of _Land_ and _Industry_ increases\r\nvisibly in Towns full of People; nay, the more shall every particular\r\nindustrious Person thrive in such a Place; tho indeed _Drones_ and\r\n_Idlers_ will not find their Account, who wou'd fain support their own\r\nand their Families superfluous Expences at their Neighbour's Cost; who\r\nmake one or two Day's Labour provide for four Days Extravagancies. And\r\nthis is the common Calamity of most of our _Corporation Towns_, whose\r\nInhabitants do all they can to discourage Plenty, Industry and\r\nPopulation; and will not admit of Strangers but upon too hard Terms,\r\nthro the false Notion, that they themselves, their Children and\r\nApprentices, have the only Right to squander their Town's Revenue, and\r\nto get, at their own Rates, all that is to be gotten within their\r\nPrecincts, or in the Neighbourhood. And therefore such Towns (through\r\nthe Mischief arising by _Combinations_ and _By-Laws_) are at best at a\r\nStand; very few in a thriving Condition (and those are where the\r\n_By-Laws_ are least _restrictive_) but _most_ throughout _England_ fall\r\nto visible Decay, whilst new Villages _not_ incorporated, or more\r\nliberal of their Privileges, grow up in their stead; till, in Process of\r\nTime, the first Sort will become almost as desolate as _Old Sarum_, and\r\nwill as well deserve to lose their Right of sending Representatives to\r\nParliament. For certainly a _Waste_ or a _Desert_ has no Right to be\r\nrepresented, nor by our original Constitution was ever intended to be:\r\nyet I would by no means have those Deputies lost to the Commons, but\r\ntransferr'd to wiser, more industrious, and better peopled Places,\r\nworthy (thro their Numbers and Wealth) of being represented.\r\n\r\nA _Whig_ is against the raising or keeping up a _Standing Army_ in Time\r\nof Peace: but with this Distinction, that if at any time an _Army_ (tho\r\neven in Time of Peace) shou'd be necessary to the Support of this very\r\nMaxim, a _Whig_ is not for being too hasty to destroy that which is to\r\nbe the Defender of his Liberty. I desire to be well understood. Suppose\r\nthen, that Persons, whose known Principle and Practice it has been\r\n(during the Attempts for arbitrary Government) to plead for and promote\r\nsuch an Army in Time of Peace, as wou'd be subservient to the Will of a\r\nTyrant, and contribute towards the enslaving the Nation; shou'd, under a\r\n_legal Government_ (yet before the _Ferment_ of the People was appeas'd)\r\ncry down a _Standing Army_ in Time of Peace: I shou'd shrewdly suspect,\r\nthat the Principles of such Persons are not changed, but that either\r\nthey like not the Hands that _Army_ is in, or the _Cause_ which it\r\nespouses; and look upon it as an Obstruction to _another_ Sort of Army,\r\nwhich they shou'd like _even in Time of Peace_. I say then, that altho\r\nthe Maxim in general be certainly _true_, yet a _Whig_ (without the just\r\nImputation of having deserted his Principles) may be for the _keeping_\r\nup such a Standing Army even in Time of Peace, till the Nation have\r\nrecover'd its _Wits_ again, and chuses Representatives who are against\r\n_Tyranny in any Hands whatsoever_; till the Enemies of our Liberties\r\nwant the Power of raising _another_ Army of _quite different\r\nSentiments_: for till that time, a _Whiggish_ Army is the _Guardian of\r\nour Liberties_, and secures to us the Power of _disbanding its self_,\r\nand prevents the raising of another of a _different Kidney_. As soon as\r\nthis is done effectually, by my Consent, no such thing as a mercenary\r\nSoldier should subsist in _England_. And therefore The _arming_ and\r\n_training_ of all the _Freeholders_ of _England_, as it is our undoubted\r\nancient Constitution, and consequently our Right; so it is the Opinion\r\nof most _Whigs_, that it ought to be put in Practice. This wou'd put us\r\nout of all Fear of foreign Invasions, or disappoint any such when\r\nattempted: This wou'd soon take away the Necessity of maintaining\r\n_Standing_ Armies of _Mercenaries_ in Time of Peace: This wou'd render\r\nus a hundred times more formidable to our Neighbours than we are; and\r\nsecure effectually our Liberties against any _King_ that shou'd have a\r\nmind to invade them at home, which perhaps was the Reason some of our\r\nlate _Kings_ were so averse to it: And whereas, as the Case now stands,\r\nTen Thousand disciplin'd Soldiers (once landed) might march without\r\n_considerable_ Opposition from one End of _England_ to the other; were\r\nour _Militia_ well regulated, and _Fire-Arms_ substituted in the Place\r\nof _Bills, Bows_, and _Arrows_ (the Weapons in Use when our _training\r\nLaws_ were in their Vigor, and for which our Laws are yet in Force) we\r\nneed not fear a Hundred Thousand Enemies, were it possible to land so\r\nmany among us. At every Mile's End, at every River and Pass, the Enemy\r\nwou'd meet with fresh Armies, consisting of Men as well skill'd in\r\nmilitary Discipline as themselves; and more resolv'd to fight, because\r\nthey do it for Property: And the farther such an Enemy advanced into the\r\nCountry, the stronger and more resolved he wou'd find us; as _Hanibal_\r\ndid the _Romans_, when he encamped under the Walls of _Rome_, even after\r\nsuch a Defeat as that at _Cannæ_. And why? Because they were all\r\n_train'd_ Soldiers, they were all _Freemen_ that fought _pro aris &\r\nfocis_: and scorn'd to trust the Preservation of their Lives and\r\nFortunes to _Mercenaries_ or _Slaves_, tho never so able-body'd: They\r\nthought Weapons became not the Hands of such as had nothing to lose, and\r\nupon that Account were unfit Defenders of their Masters Properties; so\r\nthat they never tried the Experiment but in the _utmost Extremity_.\r\n\r\nThat this is not only practicable but easy, the modern Examples of the\r\n_Swissers_ and _Swedes_ is an undeniable Indication. _Englishmen_ have\r\nas much _Courage_, as great _Strength of Body_, and _Capacity of Mind_,\r\nas any People in the Universe: And if our late _Monarchs_ had the\r\n_enervating_ their free Subjects in View, that they might give a\r\nReputation to _Mercenaries_, who depended only on the _Prince_ for their\r\nPay (as 'tis plain they had) I know no Reason why their Example shou'd\r\nbe followed in the Days of _Liberty_, when there is no such Prospect.\r\nThe Preservation of the _Game_ is but a very slender Pretence for\r\nomitting it. I hope no wise Man will put a _Hare_ or a _Partridge_ in\r\nBalance with the _Safety_ and _Liberties_ of _Englishmen_; tho after\r\nall, 'tis well known to Sportsmen, that Dogs, Snares, Nets, and such\r\nsilent Methods as are daily put in Practice, destroy the Game ten times\r\nmore than shooting with Guns.\r\n\r\nIf the restoring us to our Old Constitution in this Instance were ever\r\nnecessary, 'tis more eminently so at this time, when our next Neighbours\r\nof _Scotland_ are by Law armed just in the manner we desire to be, and\r\nthe _Union_ between both Kingdoms not perfected. For the _Militia_, upon\r\nthe Foot it now stands, will be of little Use to us: 'tis generally\r\ncompos'd of Servants, and those not always the same, consequently not\r\nwell train'd; rather such as wink with both Eyes at their own firing a\r\nMusket, and scarce know how to keep it clean, or to charge it aright. It\r\nconsists of People whose Reputation (especially the _Officers_) has been\r\nindustriously diminished, and their Persons, as well as their\r\nEmployment, rendred contemptible on purpose to enhance the Value of\r\nthose that serve for Pay; insomuch that few Gentlemen of Quality will\r\nnow a-days debase themselves so much, as to accept of a Company, or a\r\nRegiment in the _Militia_. But for all this, I can never be persuaded\r\nthat a _Red Coat_, and _Three Pence_ a Day, infuses more Courage into\r\nthe poor _Swaggering Idler_, than the having a Wife and Children, and an\r\nEstate to fight for, with good wholsome Fare in his Kitchen, wou'd into\r\na _Free-born_ Subject, provided the _Freeman_ were as well armed and\r\ntrained as the _Mercenary_.\r\n\r\nI wou'd not have the _Officers_ and _Soldiers_ of our most Brave and\r\nHonest _Army_ to mistake me. I am not arguing against them; for I am\r\nconvinced, as long as there is Work to do abroad, 'tis they (and not our\r\nhome dwelling _Freeholders_) are most proper for it. Our War must now be\r\nan _Offensive_ War; and what I am pleading for, concerns only the bare\r\n_Defensive_ Part. Most of our present Generals and Officers are fill'd\r\nwith the true Sprit of Liberty (a most rare thing) which demonstrates\r\nthe Felicity of her Majesty's Reign, and her standing upon a true\r\nBottom, beyond any other Instance that can be given; insomuch, that\r\nconsidering how great and happy we have been under the Government of\r\n_Queens_, I have sometimes doubted, whether an _Anti-Salick Law_ wou'd\r\nbe to our Disadvantage.\r\n\r\nMost of these _Officers_ do expect, nay (so true do I take them to be to\r\ntheir Country's Interest) do wish, whenever it shall please God to send\r\nus such a Peace as may be relied upon both at home and abroad, to return\r\nto the State of _peaceable Citizens_ again; but 'tis fit they should do\r\nso, with such ample Rewards for their Blood and Labours, as shall\r\nentirely satisfy them. And when they, or the Survivors of them, shall\r\nreturn full of Honour and Scars home to their Relations, after the\r\nFatigues of so glorious a Service to their Country are ended; 'tis their\r\nCountry's Duty to make them easy, without laying a Necessity upon them\r\nof striving for the Continuance of an _Army_ to avoid _starving_. The\r\n_Romans_ used to content them by a Distribution of their Enemies Lands;\r\nand I think their Example so good in every thing, that we could hardly\r\npropose a better. _Oliver Cromwell_ did the like in _Ireland_, to which\r\nwe owe that Kingdom's being a Protestant Kingdom at this Day, and its\r\ncontinuing subject to the Crown of _England_; but if it be too late to\r\nthink of this Method now, some other must be found out by the Wisdom of\r\n_Parliament_, which shall fully answer the End.\r\n\r\nThese Officers and Soldiers thus settled and reduced to a _Civil State_,\r\nwou'd, in a great measure, compose that invincible _Militia_ I am now\r\nforecasting; and by reason of their Skill in military Affairs, wou'd\r\ndeserve the principal Posts and Commands in their respective Counties:\r\nWith this advantageous Change of their Condition, that whereas formerly\r\nthey fought for their Country only as _Soldiers_ of _Fortune_, now they\r\nshou'd defend it as wise and valiant _Citizens_, as _Proprietors_ of the\r\nEstates they fight for; and this will gain them the entire Trust and\r\nConfidence of all the good People of _England_, who, whenever they come\r\nto know their own Minds, do heartily hate _Slavery_. The Manner and\r\nTimes of assembling, with several other necessary Regulations, are only\r\nproper for the _Legislative_ to fix and determine.\r\n\r\nA right _Whig_ lays no Stress upon the _Illegitimacy_ of the _pretended\r\nPrince_ of _Wales_; he goes upon another Principle than they, who carry\r\nthe _Right of Succession_ so far, as (upon that Score), to undo all\r\nMankind. He thinks no Prince fit to govern, whose Principle it must be\r\nto _ruin_ the Constitution, as soon as he can acquire unjust Power to do\r\nso. He judges it Nonsense for one to be the _Head of a Church_, or\r\n_Defender of a Faith_, who thinks himself bound in Duty to overthrow it.\r\nHe never endeavours to justify his taking the Oaths to this Government,\r\nor to quiet his Conscience, by supposing the young _Gentleman_ at _St.\r\nGermains_ unlawfully begotten; since, 'tis certain, that according to\r\nour Law he cannot be looked upon as such. He cannot satisfy himself with\r\nany of the foolish Distinctions trump'd up of late Years to reconcile\r\nbase Interest with a Show of Religion; but deals upon the Square, and\r\nplainly owns to the World, that he is not influenc'd by any particular\r\nSpleen: but that the Exercise of an _Arbitrary, Illegal Power_ in the\r\nNation, so as to undermine the Constitution, wou'd incapacitate either\r\nKing _James_, King _William_, or any other, from being his _King_,\r\nwhenever the _Publick_ has a Power to hinder it.\r\n\r\nAs a necessary Consequence of this Opinion, a _Whig_ must be against\r\n_punishing the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children_, as we do (not\r\nonly to the _Third_ and _Fourth Generation_, but) _for ever_: since our\r\ngracious God has declared, that he will no more pursue such severe\r\nMethods in his Justice, but that _the Soul that sinneth it shall die_.\r\n'Tis very unreasonable, that frail Man, who has so often need of Mercy,\r\nshou'd pretend to exercise higher Severities upon his\r\n_Fellow-Creatures_, than that Fountain of Justice on his most wicked\r\n_revolting Slaves_. To corrupt the Blood of a whole _Family_, and send\r\n_all_ the Offspring a begging after the Father's Head is taken off,\r\nseems a strange Piece of Severity, fit to be redressed in Parliament;\r\nespecially when we come to consider, for what Crime this has been\r\ncommonly done. When Subjects take Arms against their _Prince_, if their\r\nAttempt succeeds, 'tis a _Revolution_; if not, 'tis call'd a\r\n_Rebellion_: 'tis seldom consider'd, whether the first Motives be just\r\nor unjust. Now is it not enough, in such Cases, for the prevailing Party\r\nto hang or behead the _Offenders_, if they can catch them, without\r\nextending the Punishment to _innocent Persons_ for _all Generations_ to\r\ncome?\r\n\r\nThe Sense of this made the late _Bill of Treasons_ (tho it reach'd not\r\nso far as many wou'd have had it) a Favourite of the _Old Whigs_; they\r\nthought it a very desirable one whenever it cou'd be compass'd, and\r\nperhaps if not at that very Juncture, wou'd not have been obtained all:\r\n'twas necessary for Two different Sorts of People to unite in this, in\r\norder for a Majority, whose Weight shou'd be sufficient to enforce it.\r\nAnd I think some _Whigs_ were very unjustly reproach'd by their\r\n_Brethren_, as if by voting for this Bill, they wilfully exposed the\r\nlate _King's_ Person to the wicked Designs of his Enemies.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, The supporting of Parliamentary Credit, promoting of all\r\n_publick Buildings_ and _Highways_, the making all _Rivers Navigable_\r\nthat are capable of it, employing the _Poor_, suppressing _Idlers_,\r\nrestraining _Monopolies_ upon Trade, maintaining the liberty of the\r\n_Press_, the just _paying_ and _encouraging_ of all in the publick\r\nService, especially that best and usefullest Sort of People the\r\n_Seamen_: These (joined to a firm Opinion, that we ought not to hearken\r\nto any _Terms of Peace_ with the _French King_, till it be quite out of\r\nhis Power to hurt us, but rather to dye in Defence of our _own_ and the\r\n_Liberties_ of _Europe_) are all of them Articles of my _Whiggish\r\nBelief_, and I hope none of them are _heterodox_. And if all these\r\ntogether amount to a _Commonwealthsman_, I shall never be asham'd of the\r\nName, tho given with a Design of fixing a Reproach upon me, and such as\r\nthink as I do.\r\n\r\nMany People complain of the Poverty of the Nation, and the Weight of the\r\nTaxes. Some do this without any ill Design, but others hope thereby to\r\nbecome _popular_; and at the same time to _enforce a Peace_ with\r\n_France_, before that Kingdom be reduced to too low a Pitch: fearing,\r\nlest that _King_ shou'd be _disabled_ to accomplish their Scheme of\r\nbringing in the _Pretender_, and assisting him.\r\n\r\nNow altho 'tis acknowledg'd, that the _Taxes_ lye very heavy, and\r\n_Money_ grows scarce; yet let the _Importance_ of our _War_ be\r\nconsidered, together with the _Obstinacy, Perfidy_, and _Strength_ of\r\nour Enemy, can we possibly carry on such a _diffusive_ War without\r\n_Money_ in Proportion? Are the _Queen's_ Subjects more burden'd to\r\nmaintain the publick _Liberty_, than the _French_ King's are to confirm\r\ntheir own _Slavery_? Not so much by three Parts in four, God be prais'd:\r\nBesides, no true _Englishman_ will grudge to pay Taxes whilst he has a\r\nPenny in his Purse, as long as he sees the Publick Money well laid out\r\nfor the great Ends for which 'tis given. And to the Honour of the Queen\r\nand her Ministers it may be justly said, That since _England_ was a\r\nNation, never was the publick Money more frugally managed, or more\r\nfitly apply'd. This is a further Mortification to those _Gentlemen_, who\r\nhave _Designs_ in View which they dare not own: For whatever may be, the\r\n_plausible_ and _specious_ Reasons they give in publick, when they\r\nexclaim against the Ministry; the hidden and true one is, that thro the\r\npresent prudent Administration, their so hopefully-laid Project is in\r\nDanger of being blown quite up; and they begin to despair that they\r\nshall bring in King _James_ the Third by the Means of Queen _Anne_, as I\r\nverily believe they once had the Vanity to imagine.\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\nOF THE\r\nCHAPTERS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Dict. and other\r\n    Authors.\r\n\r\n_Francis Hotoman_ (one of the most learned Lawyers of that Age) was Born\r\nat _Paris_ the 23d of _August_, 1524. His Family was an Ancient and\r\nNoble one, originally of _Breslaw_, the Capital of _Silesia_. _Lambert\r\nHotoman_, his Grandfather, bore Arms in the Service of _Lewis_ the 11th\r\nof _France_, and married a rich Heiress at _Paris_, by whom he had 18\r\nChildren; the Eldest of which (_John Hotoman_) had so plentiful an\r\nEstate, that he laid down the Ransom-Money for King _Francis_ the First,\r\ntaken at the Battel of _Pavia_: _Summo galliæ bono, summâ cum suâ\r\nlaude_, says _Neveletus_, _Peter Hotoman_ his 18th Child, and [Footnote:\r\n_Maistre des Eaux & Forrests._] _Master of the Waters and Forests_ of\r\n_France_ (afterwards a Counsellor in the Parliament of _Paris_) was\r\nFather to _Francis_, the _Author_ of this Book. He sent his Son, at 15\r\nYears of Age, to _Orleans_ to study the _Common Law_; which he did with\r\nso great Applause, that at Three Years End he merited the Degree of\r\nDoctor. His Father designing to surrender to him his Place of Counsellor\r\nof _Parliament_, sent for him home: But the young Gentleman was soon\r\ntired with the Chicane of the Bar, and plung'd himself deep in the\r\nStudies of [Footnote: _Les belles Lettres._] _Humanity_ and the _Roman\r\nLaws_; for which he had a wonderful Inclination. He happen'd to be a\r\nfrequent Spectator of the Protestants Sufferings, who, about that Time,\r\nhad their Tongues cut out, were otherwise tormented, and burnt for their\r\nReligion. This made him curious to dive into those Opinions, which\r\ninspired so much Constancy, Resignation and Contempt of Death; which\r\nbrought him by degrees to a liking of them, so that he turn'd\r\nProtestant. And this put him in Disgrace with his father, who thereupon\r\ndisinherited him; which forced him at last to quit _France_, and to\r\nretire to _Lausanne_ in _Swisserland_ by _Calvin_'s and _Beza_'s Advice;\r\nwhere his great Merit and Piety promoted him to the Humanity-Professor's\r\nChair, which he accepted of for a Livelihood, having no Subsistance from\r\nhis Father. There he married a young _French_ Lady, who had fled her\r\nCountry upon the Score of Religion: He afterwards remov'd to\r\n_Strasburg_, where he also had a Professor's Chair. The Fame of his\r\ngreat Worth was so blown about, that he was invited by all the great\r\nPrinces to their several Countries, particularly by the _Landgrave_ of\r\n_Hesse_, the _Duke_ of _Prussia_, and the _King_ of _Navarre_; and he\r\nactually went to this last about the Beginning of the Troubles. Twice he\r\nwas sent as Ambassador from the Princes of the Blood of _France_, and\r\nthe Queen-Mother, to demand Assistance of the Emperor _Ferdinand:_ The\r\nSpeech that he made at the Diet of _Francfort_ is still extant.\r\nAfterwards he returned to _Strasburg_; but _Jean de Monluc_, the Bishop\r\nof _Valence_, over-persuaded him to accept of the Professorship of Civil\r\nLaw at _Valence_; of which he acquitted himself so well, that he very\r\nmuch heighten'd the Reputation of that University. Here he received two\r\nInvitations from _Margaret_ Dutchess of _Berry_, and Sister to _Henry_\r\nthe Second of _France_, and accepted a Professor's Chair at _Bourges_;\r\nbut continued in it no longer than five Months, by reason of the\r\nintervening Troubles. Afterwards he returned to it, and was there at the\r\ntime of the great _Parisian_ Massacre, having much-a-do to escape with\r\nhis Life; but having once got out of _France_ (with a firm Resolution\r\nnever to return thither again) he took Sanctuary in the House of\r\n_Calvin_ at _Geneva_, and publish'd Books against the Persecution, so\r\nfull of Spirit and good Reasoning, that the Heads of the contrary Party\r\nmade him great Offers in case he wou'd forbear Writing against them; but\r\nhe refused them all, and said, The Truth shou'd never be betray'd or\r\nforsaken by him. _Neveletus_ says, \"That his Reply to those that wou'd\r\nhave tempted him, was this: _Nunquam sibi propugnatam causam quæ iniqua\r\nesset: Nunquam quæ jure & legibus niteretur desertam præmiorum spe vel\r\nmetu periculi._\"--He afterwards went to _Basel_ in _Swisserland_, and\r\nfrom thence (being driven away by the Plague) to _Mountbelliard_, where\r\nhe buried his Wife. He returned then to _Basel_ (after having refused a\r\nProfessor's Chair at _Leyden_) and there he died of a Dropsy in the 65th\r\nYear of his Age, the 12th of _February_, 1590.\r\n\r\nHe writ a great many learned Books, which were all of them in great\r\nEsteem; and among them an excellent Book _de Consolatione_. His\r\n_Francogallia_ was his own Favourite; tho' blamed by several others, who\r\nwere of the contrary Opinion: Yet even these who wrote against him do\r\nunanimously agree, that he had a World of Learning, and a profound\r\nErudition. He had a thorough Knowledge of the Civil Law, which he\r\nmanaged with all the Eloquence imaginable; and was, without dispute, one\r\nof the ablest Civilians that _France_ had ever produced: This is _Thuanus_\r\nand _Barthius_'s Testimony of him. Mr. _Bayle_ indeed passes his Censure\r\nof this Work in the Text of his Dictionary, in these Words: \"_Sa\r\nFrancogallia dont il faisoit grand etat est celuy de tous ses ecrits que\r\nl'on aprouve le moins:_\"--and in his Commentary adds, \"_C'est un Ouvrage\r\nrecommendable du costè de l'Erudition; mais tres indigne d'un\r\njurisconsulte Francois, si l'on en croit mesme plusieurs Protestants._\"\r\nI wou'd not do any Injury to so great a Man as Monsieur _Bayle_; but\r\nevery one that is acquainted with his Character, knows that he is more a\r\nFriend to Tyranny and Tyrants, than seems to be consistent with so free\r\na Spirit. He has been extremely ill used, which sowres him to such a\r\ndegree, that it even perverts his Judgment in some measure; and he seems\r\nresolved to be against Monsieur _Jurieu_, and that Party, in every\r\nthing, right or wrong. Whoever reads his Works, may trace throughout all\r\nParts of them this Disposition of Mind, and see what sticks most at his\r\nHeart. So that he not only loses no Occasion, but often forces one where\r\nit seems improper and unseasonable, to vent his Resentments upon his\r\nEnemies; who surely did themselves a great deal more wrong in making him\r\nso, than they did him. 'Tis too true, that they did all they cou'd to\r\nstarve him; and this great Man was forced to write in haste for Bread;\r\nwhich has been the Cause that some of his Works are shorter than he\r\ndesign'd them; and consequently, that the World is deprived of so much\r\nBenefit, as otherwise it might have reap'd from his prodigious Learning,\r\nand Force of Judgment. One may see by the first Volume of his\r\nDictionary, which goes through but two Letters of the Alphabet, that he\r\nforecasted to make that Work three times as large as it is, cou'd he\r\nhave waited for the Printer's Money so long as was requisite to the\r\nfinishing it according to his first Design. Thus much I thought fit to\r\nsay, in order to abate the Edge of what he seems to speak hardly of the\r\n_Francogallia_; tho' in several other Places he makes my Author amends:\r\nAnd one may without scruple believe him, when he commends a Man, whose\r\nOpinion he condemns. For this is the Character he gives of this Work:\r\n_\"C'est au fond un bel Ouvrage, bien ecrit, & bien rempli d'erudition:\r\nEt d'autant plus incommode au partie contraire que l'Auteur se contente\r\nde citer des faits.\"_ Can any thing in the World be a greater\r\nCommendation of a Work of this Nature, than to say it contains only pure\r\nMatter of Fact? Now if this be so, Monsieur _Bayle_ wou'd do well to\r\ntell us what he means by those Words, _Tres indigne d'un jurisconsulte\r\nFrancois_. Whether a _French_ Civilian be debarr'd telling of Truth\r\n(when that Truth exposes Tyranny) more than a Civilian of any other\r\nNation? This agrees, in some measure, with Monsieur _Teissier_'s\r\nJudgment of the _Francogallia_, and shews, that Monsieur _Bayle_, and\r\nMonsieur _Teissier_ and _Bongars_, were _Bons Francois_ in one and the\r\nsame Sense. \"_Son Livre intitulè, Francogallia, luy attira AVEC RAISON_\r\n(and this he puts in great Letters) _les blame des bons Francois_. For\r\n(says he) therein he endeavours to prove, That _France_, the most\r\nflourishing Kingdom in _Christendom_, is not successive, like the\r\nEstates of particular Persons; but that anciently the Kings came to the\r\nCrown by the Choice and Suffrages of the Nobility and People; insomuch,\r\nthat as in former Times the Power and Authority of _Electing_ their\r\nKings belonged to the _Estates of the Kingdom_, so likewise did the\r\nRight of _Deposing_ their _Princes_ from their Government. And hereupon\r\nhe quotes the Examples of _Philip de Valois_, of _King John_, _Charles\r\nthe Fifth_, and _Charles the Sixth_, and _Lewis the Eleventh_: But what\r\nhe principally insists on, is to show, That as from Times Immemorial,\r\nthe _French_ judg'd Women incapable of Governing; So likewise ought they\r\nto be debarr'd from all Administration of the Publick Affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThis is Mr. _Boyle_'s Quotation of _Teissier_, by which it appears how\r\nfar _Hotoman_ ought to be blamed by all _true Frenchmen, AVEC RAISON_.\r\nBut provided that _Hotoman_ proves irrefragably all that he says (as not\r\nonly Monsieur _Bayle_ himself, but every body else that writes of him\r\nallows) I think it will be a hard matter to persuade a disinteress'd\r\nPerson, or any other but a _bon Francois_, (which, in good _English_, is\r\na _Lover of his Chains_) that here is any just Reason shewn why\r\n_Hotoman_ shou'd be blam'd.\r\n\r\nMonsieur _Teissier_, altho' very much prejudiced against him, was (as\r\none may see by the Tenor of the above Quotation, and his leaving it thus\r\nuncommented on) in his Heart convinc'd of the Truth of it; but no _bon\r\nFrancois_ dares own so much. He was a little too careless when he wrote\r\nagainst _Hotoman_, mistaking one of his Books for another; _viz._ his\r\nCommentary _ad titulum institutionum de Actionibus_, for his little Book\r\n_de gradibus cognationis_; both extremely esteemed by all learned Men,\r\nespecially the first: Of which Monsieur _Bayle_ gives this Testimony:\r\n\"_La beauté du Stile, & la connoissance des antiquités Romaines\r\neclatoient dans cet Ouvrage, & le firent fort estimer._\"\r\n\r\n_Thuanus_, that celebrated disinteress'd Historian, gives this Character\r\nin general of his Writings. \"He composed (says he) several Works very\r\nprofitable towards the explaining of the Civil Law, Antiquity, and all\r\nSorts of fine Literature; which have been collected and publish'd by\r\n_James Lectius_, a famous Lawyer, after they had been review'd and\r\ncorrected by the Author. _Barthius_ says, that he excelled in the\r\nKnowledge of the Civil Law, and of all genteel Learning [Footnote:\r\n_Belles Literature_] _Ceux la mesmes qui ont ecrits contre luy_ (says\r\n_Neveletus_) _tombent d'accord quil avoit beaucoup de lecture & une\r\nprofonde Erudition_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Author of the _Monitoriale adversus Italogalliam_, which some take\r\nto be _Hotoman_ himself, has this Passage relating to the _Francogallia_:\r\n\"Quomodo potest aliquis ei succensere qui est tantum relator & narrator\r\nfacti? _Francogallista_ enim tantum narrationi & relationi simplici\r\nvacat, quod si aliena dicta delerentur, charta remaneret alba.\"\r\n\r\nIt was objected to him, that he unawares furnish'd the Duke of _Guise_\r\nand the _League_ at _Paris_ with Arguments to make good their Attempts\r\nagainst their Kings. This cannot be deny'd; but at the same time it\r\ncannot be imputed to _Hotoman_ as any Crime: Texts of Scripture\r\nthemselves have been made use of for different Purposes, according to\r\nthe Passion or the Interests of Parties. Arguments do not lose their\r\nnative Force for being wrong apply'd: If the Three _Estates of France_\r\nhad such a fundamental Power lodg'd in them; who can help it, if the\r\nWriters for the _League_ made use of Hotoman's Arguments to support a\r\nwrong Cause? And this may suffice to remove this Imputation from his\r\nMemory.\r\n\r\nHe was a Man of a very handsome Person and Shape, tall and comely; his\r\nEyes were blewish, his Nose long, and his Countenance venerable: He\r\njoined a most exemplary Piety and Probity to an eminent Degree of\r\nKnowledge and Learning. No Day pass'd over his Head, wherein he employ'd\r\nnot several Hours in the Exercise of Prayer, and reading of the\r\nScriptures. He wou'd never permit his Picture to be drawn, tho' much\r\nintreated by his Friends; however (when he was at his last Gasp, and\r\ncou'd not hinder it) they got a Painter to his Bed's-side, who took his\r\nLikeness as well as 'twas possible at such a time. _Basilius\r\nAmerbachius_ assisted him during his last Sickness, and _James Grinæus_\r\nmade his Funeral-Sermon. He left two Sons behind him, _John_ and\r\n_Daniel_; besides a great Reputation, and Desire of him, not only among\r\nhis Friends and Acquaintance, but all the Men of Learning and Probity\r\nall over _Europe_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplication of the _Roman_ Names mention'd by _Hotoman_.\r\n\r\n_Ædui_,                People of _Chalons_ and _Nevers_, of _Autun_\r\n                       and _Mascon_.\r\n\r\n_Agrippina Colonia_,  _Cologn_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arverni_,             P. of _Auvergne_ and _Bourbonnais_.\r\n\r\n_Armorica_,           _Bretagne_ and _Normandy_.\r\n\r\n_Aquitani_,            P. of _Guienne_ and _Gascogn_.\r\n\r\n_Atrebates_,           P. of _Artois_.\r\n\r\n_Attuarii_,            P. of _Aire_ in _Gascogn_.\r\n\r\n_Augustodunum_,       _Autun_.\r\n\r\n_Aureliani_,           P. of _Orleans_.\r\n\r\n_Aquisgranum_,        _Aix la Chapelle_.\r\n\r\n_Ambiani_,             P. of _Amiens_.\r\n\r\n_Alsaciones_,          P. of _Alsace_.\r\n\r\n_Bigargium_,          _Bigorre forté_.\r\n\r\n_Bibracte_,           _Bavray_, in the Diocese of _Rheims_.\r\n\r\n_Bituriges_,           P. of _Bourges_.\r\n\r\n_Carisiacum_,         _Crecy_.\r\n\r\n_Cinnesates_,          P. on the Sea-Coast, between the _Elb_ and\r\n                       the _Rhine_.\r\n\r\n_Carnutes_,            P. of _Chartres_ and _Orleans_.\r\n\r\n_Ceutrones_,           P. of _Liege_.\r\n\r\n_Ceutones_,            P. of _Tarentaise_ in _Savoy_.\r\n\r\n_Condrusii_,           P. of the _Condros_ in _Flanders_.\r\n\r\n_Dusiacum_,           _non liquet_.\r\n\r\n_Eburones_,            P. of the Diocese of _Liege_, and of _Namur_.\r\n\r\n_Gorduni_,             P. about _Ghent_ and _Courtray_.\r\n\r\n_Grudii_,              P. of _Lovain_.\r\n\r\n_Hetrusci_,            P. of _Tuscany_.\r\n\r\n_Laudunum_,           _Laon_.\r\n\r\n_Lexovium_,           _Lisieux_.\r\n\r\n_Lentiates_,           People about _Lens_.\r\n\r\n_Levaci_,              P. of _Hainault_.\r\n\r\n_Leuci_,               P. of _Metz_, _Toul_ and _Verdun_.\r\n\r\n_Lingones_,            P. of _Langres_.\r\n\r\n_Lugdunum_,           _Lyons_.\r\n\r\n_Lutetia_,            _Paris_.\r\n\r\n_Massilia_,           _Marseilles_.\r\n\r\n_Marsua_,             _non liquet_.\r\n\r\n_Nervii_,              P. of _Hainault_ and _Cambray_.\r\n\r\n_Nitiobriges_,         P. of _Agenois_.\r\n\r\n_Novemopulonia_,      _Gascony_.\r\n\r\n_Noviomagum_,         _Nimeguen_.\r\n\r\n_Pannonia_,           _Hungary_.\r\n\r\n_Pleumosii_,           P. of _Tornay_ and _Lisle_.\r\n\r\n_Rhatia_,             _Swisserland_.\r\n\r\n_Rhemi_,               P. of _Rheims_.\r\n\r\n_Senones_,             P. of _Sens_ and _Auxerre_.\r\n\r\n_Sequani_,             P. of _Franche Comté_.\r\n\r\n_Sequana_,             the River _Seine_.\r\n\r\n_Suessiones_,          P. of _Soissons_.\r\n\r\n_Trecassini_,          P. of _Tricasses_ in _Champagne_.\r\n\r\n_Treviri_,             P. of _Triers_, and Part of _Luxemburg_.\r\n\r\n_Toxandri_,            P. of _Zealand_.\r\n\r\n_Tolbiacum_,          _non liquet_.\r\n\r\n_Vencti_,              P. of _Vannes_.\r\n\r\n_Vesontini_,           P. of _Besançon_.\r\n\r\n_Ulbanesses_,         _non liquet_.\r\n\r\n_Witmarium_,          _non liquet_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Author's Preface.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To the most Illustrious and Potent Prince _FREDERICK_,\r\n    Count Palatine of the _Rhine_, Duke of _Bavaria_, &c.\r\n    First Elector of the _Roman_ Empire, His most Gracious\r\n    Lord, _Francis Hotoman_, wishes all Health and Prosperity.\r\n\r\n_'Tis an old Saying, of which_ Teucer _the Son of_ Telamon _is the\r\nsupposed Author, and which has been approved of these many Ages_, A\r\nMan's Country is, where-ever he lives at Ease. [Footnote: _Patria est\r\nubicunq; est bene._] _For to bear even Banishment it self with an\r\nunconcern'd Temper of Mind like other Misfortunes and Inconveniences,\r\nand to despise the Injuries of an ungrateful Country, which uses one\r\nmore like a Stepmother than a true Mother, seems to be the Indication of\r\na great Soul. But I am of a quite different Opinion: For if it be a\r\ngreat Crime, and almost an Impiety not to live under and suffer\r\npatiently the Humours and harsh Usage of our Natural Parents; 'tis sure\r\na much greater, not to endure those of our Country, which wise Men have\r\nunanimously preferr'd to their_ Parents. _'Tis indeed the Property of a\r\nwary self-interested Man, to measure his Kindness for his Country by his\r\nown particular Advantages: But such a sort of Carelesness and\r\nIndifferency seems a Part of that Barbarity which was attributed to the_\r\nCynicks _and_ Epicureans; _whence that detestable Saying proceeded_,\r\nWhen I am dead, let the whole World be a Fire. _Which is not unlike the\r\nOld Tyrannical Axiom_; Let my Friends perish, so my Enemies fall along\r\nwith them. [Footnote: _Me mortuo terra misceatur incendio. Pereant amici\r\ndum una inimici intercidant._] _But in gentle Dispositions, there is a\r\ncertain inbred Love of their Country, which they can no more divest\r\nthemselves of, than of Humanity it self. Such a Love as_ Homer\r\n_describes in_ Ulysses, _who preferred_ Ithaca, _tho' no better than a\r\nBird's Nest fix'd to a craggy Rock in the Sea, to all the Delights of\r\nthe Kingdom which_ Calypso _offer'd him_.\r\n\r\n  Nescio quâ natale Solum dulcedine cunctos\r\n  Ducit, & immemores non finit esse sui:\r\n\r\n_Was very truly said by the Ancient Poet; When we think of that Air we\r\nfirst suck'd in, that Earth we first trod on, those Relations,\r\nNeighbours and Acquaintance to whose Conversation we have been\r\naccustomed._\r\n\r\n_But a Man may sometimes say, My_ Country _is grown_ mad _or_ foolish,\r\n_(as_ Plato _said of his) sometimes that it rages and cruelly tears out\r\nits own Bowels.--We are to take care in the first Place, that we do not\r\nascribe_ other Folks _Faults to our innocent_ Country. _There have been\r\nmay cruel_ Tyrants _in_ Rome _and in other Places; these not only\r\ntormented innocent good Men, but even the best deserving Citizens, with\r\nall manner of Severities: Does it therefore follow, that the Madness of\r\nthese Tyrants must be imputed to their Country? The Cruelty of the\r\nEmperor_ Macrinus _is particularly memorable; who as_ Julius Capitolinus\r\n_writes, was nicknamed_ Macellinus, _because his House was stained with\r\nthe Blood of Men, as a Shambles is with that of Beasts. Many such others\r\nare mention'd by Historians, who for the like Cruelty (as the same_\r\nCapitolinus _tells us) were stil'd, one_ Cyclops, _another_ Busiris, _a\r\n3d_ Sciron, _a 4th_ Tryphon, _a 5th_ Gyges. _These were firmly\r\npersuaded, that Kingdoms and Empires cou'd not be secur'd without\r\nCruelty: Wou'd it be therefore reasonable, that good Patriots shou'd lay\r\naside all Care and Solicitude for their Country? Certainly they ought\r\nrather to succour her, when like a miserable oppressed Mother, she\r\nimplores her Childrens Help, and to seek all proper Remedies for the\r\nMischiefs that afflict her._\r\n\r\n_But how fortunate are those Countries that have good and mild Princes!\r\nhow happy are those Subjects, who, thro' the Benignity of their Rulers\r\nmay quietly grow old on their Paternal Seats, in the sweet Society of\r\ntheir Wives and Children! For very often it happens, that the Remedies\r\nwhich are made use of prove worse than the Evils themselves. 'Tis now,\r\nmost Illustrious Prince, about Sixteen Years since God Almighty has\r\ncommitted to your Rule and Government a considerable Part of_ Germany\r\n_situate on the_ Rhine. _During which time, 'tis scarce conceivable what\r\na general Tranquility, what a Calm (as in a smooth Sea) has reigned in\r\nthe whole_ Palatinate; _how peaceable and quiet all things have\r\ncontinued: How piously and religiously they have been governed: Go on\r\nmost Gracious Prince in the same Meekness of Spirit, which I to the\r\nutmost of my Power must always extol. Proceed in the same Course of\r\ngentle and peaceable Virtue_; Macte Virtute; _not in the Sense which_\r\nSeneca _tells us the_ Romans _used this Exclamation in, to salute their\r\nGenerals when they return'd all stain'd with Gore Blood from the Field\r\nof Battel, who were rather true_ Macellinus's: _But do you proceed in\r\nthat Moderation of Mind, Clemency, Piety, Justice, Affability, which\r\nhave occasion'd the Tranquility of your Territories. And because the\r\npresent Condition of your_ Germany _is such as we see it, Men now-a-days\r\nrun away from Countries infested with Plunderers and Oppressors, to take\r\nSanctuary in those that are quiet and peaceable; as Mariners, who\r\nundertake a Voyage, forecast to avoid Streights, &c. and Rocky Seas, and\r\nchase to sail a calm and open Course._\r\n\r\n_There was indeed a Time, when young Gentlemen, desirous of Improvement,\r\nflock'd from all Parts to the Schools and Academies of our_\r\nFrancogallia, _as to the publick Marts of good Literature. Now they\r\ndread them as Men do Seas infested with Pyrates, and detest their\r\nTyrannous Barbarity. The Remembrance of this wounds me to the very Soul;\r\nwhen I consider my unfortunate miserable Country has been for almost\r\ntwelve Years, burning in the Flames of Civil War. But much more am I\r\ngriev'd, when I reflect that so many have not only been idle Spectators\r\nof these dreadful Fires (as_ Nero _was of flaming_ Rome_) but have\r\nendeavour'd by their wicked Speeches and Libels to blow the Bellows,\r\nwhilst few or none have contributed their Assistance towards the\r\nextinguishing them._\r\n\r\n_I am not ignorant how mean and inconsiderable a Man I am; nevertheless\r\nas in a general Conflagration every Man's Help is acceptable, who is\r\nable to fling on but a Bucket of Water, so I hope the Endeavours of any\r\nPerson that offers at a Remedy will be well taken by every Lover of his\r\nCountry. Being very intent for several Months past on the Thoughts of\r\nthese great Calamities, I have perused all the old_ French _and_ German\r\n_Historians that treat of our_ Francogallia, _and collected out of their\r\nWorks a true State of our_ Commonwealth; _in the Condition (wherein they\r\nagree) it flourished for above a Thousand Years. And indeed the great\r\nWisdom of our Ancestors in the first framing of our Constitution, is\r\nalmost incredible; so that I no longer doubted, that the most certain\r\nRemedy for so great Evils must be deduced from their Maxims._\r\n\r\n_For as I more attentively enquired into the Source of these Calamities,\r\nit seemed to me, that even as human Bodies decay and perish, either by\r\nsome outward Violence, or some inward Corruption of Humours, or lastly,\r\nthro' Old Age: So Commonwealths are brought to their Period, sometimes\r\nby Foreign Force, sometimes by Civil Dissentions, at other Times by\r\nbeing worn out and neglected. Now tho' the Misfortunes that have\r\nbefallen our Commonwealth are commonly attributed to our Civil\r\nDissentions, I found, upon Enquiry, these are not so properly to be\r\ncalled the_ Cause _as the_ Beginning _of our Mischiefs. And_ Polybius,\r\n_that grave judicious Historian, teaches us, in the first place, to\r\ndistinguish the_ Beginning _from the_ Cause _of any Accident. Now I\r\naffirm the_ Cause _to have been that great Blow which our Constitution\r\nreceived about 100 Years ago from that_ [Footnote: Lewis _the_ XI.]\r\n_Prince, who ('tis manifest) first of all broke in upon the noble and\r\nsolid Institutions of our Ancestors. And as our natural Bodies when put\r\nout of joint by Violence, can never be recover'd but by replacing and\r\nrestoring every Member to its true Position; so neither can we\r\nreasonably hope our Commonwealth shou'd be restor'd to Health, till\r\nthrough Divine Assistance it shall be put into its true and natural\r\nState again._\r\n\r\n_And because your Highness has always approv'd your self a true Friend\r\nto our Country; I though it my Duty to inscribe, or, as it were, to\r\nconsecrate this Abstract of our History to your Patronage.

I.\r\n\r\n    _The State of_ Gaul, _before it was reduced into a_\r\n    Province _by the_ Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Design being to give an Account of the Laws and Ordinances of our\r\n_Francogallia_, as far as it may tend to the Service of our\r\n_Commonwealth_, in its present Circumstances; I think it proper, in the\r\nfirst place, to set forth the State of _Gaul_, before it was reduced\r\ninto the Form of a _Province_ by the _Romans_: For what _Cæsar,\r\nPolybius, Strabo, Ammianus_, and other Writers have told us concerning\r\nthe _Origin, Antiquity_ and _Valour_ of that People, the Nature and\r\nSituation of their Country, and their private Customs, is sufficiently\r\nknown to all Men, tho' but indifferently learned.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore to understand, that the State of _Gaul_ was such at\r\nthat time, that neither was the _whole_ under the Government of a\r\n_single Person_: Nor were the particular [Footnote: _Civitas_, a\r\nCommonwealth.] _Commonwealths_ under the Dominion of the _Populace_, or\r\nthe _Nobles_ only; but all _Gaul_ was so divided into _Commonwealths_,\r\nthat the most Part were govern'd by the _Advice_ of the _Nobles_; and\r\nthese were called _Free_; the rest had _Kings_. But every one of them\r\nagreed in this _Institute_, that at a certain Time of the Year a\r\n_publick Council_ of the whole Nation should be held; in which\r\n_Council_, whatever seem'd to relate to the whole _Body_ of the\r\n_Commonwealth_ was appointed and establish'd. _Cornelius Tacitus_, in\r\nhis 3d Book, reckons Sixty-four _Croitates_; by which is meant (as\r\n_Cæsar_ explains it) so many Regions or Districts; in each of which, not\r\nonly the same _Language, Manners_ and _Laws_, but also the same\r\n_Magistrates_ were made use of. Such, in many Places of his History, he\r\nprincipally mentions the Cities of the _Ædui_, the _Rhemi_ and _Arverni_\r\nto have been. And therefore _Dumnorix_ the _Æduan_, when _Cæsar_ sent to\r\nhave him slain, began to resist, and to defend himself, and to implore\r\nthe Assistance of his _Fellow Citizens_; often crying out, That he was a\r\n_Freeman_, and Member of a _Free Commonwealth_, lib. 5. cap. 3.\r\n\r\nTo the like purpose Strabo writes in his Fourth Book: [Footnote: [Greek:\r\nAristokratikai d' êsan hai pleious tôn politeiôs, ena d' hêgemona\r\nhêrounto kat eniauton to palaion hôs d' hautôs eis polemon heis hupo tou\r\nplêthous apedeiknuto stratêgos.]] \"_Most_ of the _Commonwealths_ (says\r\nhe) were govern'd by the _Advice_ of the _Nobles_: but every _Year_ they\r\nanciently chose a _Magistrate_; as also the People chose a _General_ to\r\nmanage their Wars.\" The like _Cæsar_, lib. 6. Cap. 4. writes in these\r\nWords: \"Those _Commonwealths_ which are esteem'd to be under the best\r\nAdministration, have made a Law, that if any Man chance to hear a Rumour\r\nor Report abroad among the Bordering People, which concerned the\r\n_Commonwealth_, he ought to inform the _Magistrates_ of it, and\r\ncommunicate it to no body else. The _Magistrates_ conceal what they\r\nthink proper, and acquaint the Multitude with the rest: For of Matters\r\nrelating to the _Community_, it was not permitted to any Person to talk\r\nor discourse, but in _Council_\".--Now concerning this _Common Council_\r\nof the whole Nation, we shall quote these few Passages out of _Cæsar_.\r\n\"They demanded, (says he) _lib._ 1. _cap._ 12. a _General Council_ of\r\n_all Gallia_ to be summon'd; and that this might be done by _Cæsar_'s\r\nConsent.\" Also, _lib._ 7. _cap._ 12.--\"a _Council_ of all _Gallia_ was\r\nsummon'd to meet at _Bibracte_; and there was a vast Concourse from all\r\nParts to that Town.\"--And _lib._ 6. _cap._ 1--\"_Cæsar_ having summon'd\r\nthe _Council_ of _Gaul_ to meet early in the Spring, as he had before\r\ndetermin'd: Finding that the _Senenes, Carnates_ and _Treviri_ came not\r\nwhen all the rest came, he adjourned the _Council_ to Paris.\"--And,\r\n_lib_ 7. _cap._ 6. speaking of _Vercingetorix_,--\"He promis'd himself,\r\nthat he shou'd be able by his Diligence to unite such _Commonwealths_ to\r\nhim as dissented from the rest of the Cities of _Gaul_, and to form a\r\n_General Council_ of all _Gallia_; the Power of which, the whole World\r\nshould not be able to withstand.\"\r\n\r\nNow concerning the _Kings_ which ruled over certain Cities in _Gallia_\r\nthe same Author makes mention of them in very many Places; Out of which\r\nthis is particularly worthy our Observation: That it was the _Romans_\r\nCustom to caress all those _Reguli_ whom they found proper for their\r\nturns: That is, such as were busy men, apt to embroil Affairs, and to\r\nsow Dissentions or Animosities between the several _Commonwealths_.\r\nThese they joined with in Friendship and Society, and by most honourable\r\npublick Decrees called them their _Friends_ and _Confederates_: And many\r\nof these _Kings_ purchased, at a great Expence, this Verbal Honour from\r\nthe _Chief Men_ of _Rome_. Now the _Gauls_ called such, _Reges_, or\r\nrather _Reguli_, which were chosen, not for a certain Term, (as the\r\nMagistrates of the Free Cities were) but for their Lives; tho' their\r\nTerritories were never so small and inconsiderable: And these, when\r\nCustoms came to be changed by Time, were afterwards called by the Names\r\nof _Dukes, Earls_, and _Marquisses_.\r\n\r\nOf the _Commonwealths_ or _Cities_, some were much more potent than\r\nothers; and upon these the lesser _Commonwealths_ depended; these they\r\nput themselves under for Protection: Such weak Cities _Cæsar_ sometimes\r\ncalls the _Tributaries_ and _Subjects_ of the former; but, for the most\r\npart he says, they were in _Confederacy_ with them. _Livius_ writes,\r\n_lib. 5._ that when _Tarquinius Priscus_ reigned in _Rome_, the\r\n_Bituriges_ had the principal Authority among the _Celtæ_, and gave a\r\n_King_ to them. When _Cæsar_ first enter'd _Gaul_, A.U.C. 695. he found\r\nit divided into Two Factions; the _Ædui_ were at the Head of the one,\r\nthe _Arverni_ of the other, who many Years contended for the\r\nSuperiority: But that which greatly increas'd this Contention, was,\r\nBecause the _Bituriges_, who were next Neighbours to the _Arverni_, were\r\nyet _in file & imperio_ that is, Subjects and Allies to the _Ædui_. On\r\nthe other hand, the _Sequani_ (tho' Borderers on the _Ædui_) were under\r\nthe Protection of the _Arverni_, lib. 1. Cap. 12. lib. 6. cap. 4. The\r\n_Romans_ finding such-like Dissention; to be for their Interest; that\r\nis, proper Opportunities to enlarge their own Power, did all they cou'd\r\nto foment them: And therefore made a League with the _Ædui_, whom (with\r\na great many Compliments) they titled _Brothers and Friends of the\r\nPeople of Rome_. Under the Protection and League of the _Ædui_, I find\r\nto have been first the _Senones_, with whom some time before the\r\n_Parisians_ had join'd their _Commonwealth_ in League and Amity. Next,\r\nthe _Bellouaci_, who had nevertheless a great City of their own,\r\nabounding in Numbers of People, and were of principal Authority and\r\nRepute among the _Belgæ_, lib. 2. cap. 4. and lib. 7. cap. 7. _Cæsar_\r\nreckons the _Centrones_, _Grudii_, _Levaci_, _Pleumosii_, _Gordunni_,\r\nunder the Dominion of the _Nervii_, lib. 5. cap. 11. He names the\r\n_Eburones_ and _Condrasii_ as Clients of the _Treviri_, lib. 4. cap. 2.\r\nAnd of the _Commonwealth_ of the _Veneti_ (these are in _Armorica_ or\r\n_Brittanny_) he writes, that their Domination extended over all those\r\nMaritime Regions; and that almost all that frequented those Seas were\r\ntheir Tributaries, _lib._ 3. _cap._ 2. But the Power of the _Arverni_\r\nwas so great, that it not only equall'd that of the Ædui, but a little\r\nbefore _Cæsar_'s Arrival, had got most of their Clients and Dependents\r\nfrom them, _lib._ 6 _cap._ 4. _lib._ 7. _cap._ 10. Whereupon, as Strabo\r\nwrites in his 4th Book, they made War against _Cæsar_ with Four hundred\r\nthousand Men under the Conduct of their General _Vercingetorix_. These\r\nwere very averse to Kingly Government: So that _Celtillus_, Father to\r\n_Vercingetorix_, a Man of great Power and Reputation (reckon'd the first\r\nMan in all _Gaul_,) was put to Death, by _Order_ of his _Commonwealth_,\r\nfor aspiring to the _Kingdom_. The _Sequani_, on the other hand, had a\r\nKing, one _Catamantales_, to whom the _Romans_ gave the Title of their\r\n_Friend_ and _Ally_, lib. 1. cap. 2. Also the _Suessiones_, who were\r\nMasters of most large and fertile Territories, with 12 great Cities, and\r\ncou'd muster Fifty thousand fighting Men, had a little before that time\r\n_Divitiacus_, the most potent Prince of all _Gallia_ for their King; he\r\nhad not only the Command of the greatest Part of _Belgæ_, but even of\r\n_Britanny_. At _Cæsar_'s Arrival they had one _Galba_ for their King,\r\n_lib._ 2. _cap._ 1. In _Aquitania_, the _Grandfather_ of one _Piso_ an\r\n_Aquitanian_ reigned, and was called _Friend_ by the People of _Rome_,\r\nlib. 4. cap. 3. The _Senones_, a People of great Strength and Authority\r\namong the _Gauls_, had for some time _Moritasgus_ their King; whose\r\nAncestors had also been Kings in the same Place, _lib._ 5. _cap._ 13.\r\nThe _Nitiobriges_ or _Agenois_, had _Olovico_ for their King; and he\r\nalso had the Appellation given him of _Friend_ by the _Senate_ of\r\n_Rome_, lib. 7. cap. 6.\r\n\r\nBut concerning all these Kingdoms, one thing is remarkable, and must not\r\nlightly be past by; which is That _they were not hereditary_, but\r\n_conferr'd_ by the _People_ upon such as had the Reputation of being\r\njust Men. Secondly, That they had no _arbitrary_ or _unlimited\r\nAuthority_, but were bound and _circumscribed_ by _Laws_; so that they\r\nwere no less accountable to, and subject to the Power of the People,\r\nthan the People was to theirs; insomuch that those _Kingdoms_ seem'd\r\nnothing else but _Magistracies for Life_. For Cæsar makes mention of\r\nseveral _private Men_, whose _Ancestors_ had formerly been _such Kings_;\r\namong these he reckons _Casticus_, the Son of _Catamantales_, whose\r\nFather had been King of the _Sequani_ many Years, _lib._ 1. _cap._ 2.\r\nand _Piso_ the _Aquitanian_, lib. 4. cap. 3. also _Tasgetius_, whose\r\nAncestors had been Kings among the _Carnutes_, lib. 5. cap. 8.\r\n\r\nNow concerning the Extent of their _Power_ and _Jurisdiction_, he brings\r\nin _Ambiorix_, King of the _Eburones_, giving an account of it, _lib._\r\n5. _cap._ 8. \"The Constitution of our Government is such (says he) that\r\nthe People have no less Power and Authority over me than I have over the\r\nPeople. _Non minus habet in me juris multitudo, quam ipse in\r\nmultitudinem._\" Which Form of Government, _Plato, Aristotle, Polybius_\r\nand _Cicero_ have for this Reason determined to be the _best_ and _most\r\nExcellent_: \"Because (says _Plato_) shou'd Kingly Government be left\r\nwithout a Bridle, when it has attained to supreme Power, as if it stood\r\nupon a slippery Place, it easily falls into Tyranny: And therefore it\r\nought to be restrained as with a Curb, by the Authority of the Nobles;\r\nand such chosen men as the People have empower'd to that End and\r\nPurpose.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n    _Probable Conjectures concerning the_ ancient Language _of\r\n    the_ Gauls.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Place it seems proper to handle a Question much disputed and\r\ncanvass'd by Learned Men; _viz._ What was the Language of the Gauls in\r\nthose old Times? For as to what belongs to their Religion, Laws, and the\r\nCustoms of the People, _Cæsar_, as I said before, has at large given us\r\nan account. In the first place we ought to take notice, that _Cæsar_, in\r\nthe Beginning of his Commentaries, where he divides the Gauls into Three\r\nNations, the _Belgæ_, the _Aquitanæ_, and the _Celtæ_, tells us they all\r\ndiffer'd, not only in their _Customs_, but in their _Language_ [Footnote:\r\n[Greek: all enious micron parallattontas tais glôttais]]: Which also\r\n_Strabo_ confirms, _lib._ 4. where he says they were not [Greek:\r\nhomolhôttous], of one Language, but a little differing in their\r\nLanguages. And the same thing _Ammianus Marcellinus_ testifies in his\r\n15th Book. But what many Learned Men (especially of our own Country)\r\nhave maintain'd, _viz._ That the _Gauls_ commonly used the _Greek\r\nTongue_, may be refuted by this single Instance which _Cæsar_ takes\r\nnotice of _lib._ 5. _cap._ 12. That when _Q. Cicero_ was besieged in his\r\nCamp, he dispatched Letters written in the _Greek_ Language, \"_Lest (if\r\nthey were intercepted) his Designs shou'd be discover'd by the_ Gauls.\"\r\nBut to this some object, what _Strabo_ writes, _lib._ 4. _viz._ \"That\r\nall Sorts of good Literature (and especially that of the _Greek\r\nLanguage_) flourish'd at _Marseilles_ to such a degree, that the\r\n_Gauls_, by the Example of the _Massilians_, were mightily delighted\r\nwith the _Greek_ Tongue, insomuch that they began to write their very\r\nBargains and Contracts in it.\" Now to this there is a short and ready\r\nReply: For, in the first place, if the _Gauls_ learnt _Greek_ by the\r\nExample of the _Massilians_, 'tis plain, 'twas none of their\r\nMother-tongue. Secondly, _Strabo_ in the same place clearly shows us,\r\nthat the Fashion of writing their Contracts in _Greek_ began but in his\r\nTime, when all _Gallia_ was in Subjection to the _Romans_. Besides, he\r\nspeaks precisely only of those _Gauls_ who were Borderers and next\r\nNeighbours to the _Massilians_, of whom he says, that not only many of\r\ntheir private Men, but even their Cities (by publick Decrees, and\r\nproposing great Rewards) invited several Learned Men of _Massilia_ to\r\ninstruct their Youth.\r\n\r\nIt remains that we shou'd clear that place in _Cæsar_, where he tells us\r\nthe _Gauls_, in their publick and private Reckonings, _Græcis literis\r\nusos fuisse_. But let us see whether the word _Græcis_ in that place\r\nought not to be left out, not only as _unnecessary_ but _surreptitious_.\r\nSince it was sufficient to express _Cæsar_'s Meaning to have said, that\r\nthe _Gauls_ made no use of _Letters_ or _Writing_ in the Learning of the\r\n_Druids_, but in all other Matters, and in publick and private Accounts,\r\nthey did make use of _Writing_: For _uti litteris, to use Letters_, is a\r\nfrequent Expression for _Writing_ among Latin Authors. Besides, it had\r\nbeen a Contradiction to say the _Gauls_ were unskill'd in the _Greek_\r\nTongue, as _Cæsar_ had averr'd a little before; and afterwards to say,\r\nthat they wrote all their publick and private Accounts in _Greek_. As to\r\nwhat many suppose, that the words _literis Græcis_ in that place, are\r\nnot to be taken for _Writing Greek_, but only for the _Characters_ of\r\nthe _Letters_; I can less approve of this Explanation than the former;\r\nbecause though many ancient Writers (as we just now said) frequently\r\nused the Expression, _Uti litteris_ for _Scribere_; yet I never\r\nobserv'd, that any of them ever used it to signify the _Forms_ and\r\n_Fashions_ of the _Characters_. Neither does it make at all for their\r\nOpinion, what _Cæsar_ says in the First Book of his Commentaries, _viz._\r\nThat there were found in the _Helvetian_ Camp, Tablets, _literis Græcis\r\nconscriptas_; as if the same Person, who had learnt to make use of the\r\n_Greek Forms_ of _Characters_, might not as easily have learnt the\r\n_Greek Language_; or as if there might not be among the _Helvetii_,\r\n_Priests_ or _Gentlemens Sons_, who might then have learnt _Greek_, as\r\nour's now learn _Latin_; _Greek_ being at that Time a Language in Vogue\r\nand Esteem. The very Neighbourhood of the School of _Massilia_ is\r\nsufficient to confute that Opinion: And therefore _Cæsar_, when he\r\nspeaks of his own Letter to _Cicero_, tells us, he sent that Letter\r\nwritten in _Greek Characters_, lest (in case it were intercepted) his\r\nDesigns shou'd be discover'd by the Enemy. _Justinius_, lib. 20. says,\r\nthere was a Decree of the Senate made, that no _Carthaginian_, after\r\nthat Time, shou'd study the [Footnote: _Græcis literas._] _Greek Language_\r\nor _Writing_, lest he shou'd be able to speak or write to the Enemy\r\nwithout an Interpreter. _Tacitus_, in his Book _de moribus Germanorum_,\r\ntells us, that several Tombs and Monuments were yet to be seen in the\r\nConfines of _Germany_ and _Swisserland_ with _Greek_ Inscriptions on\r\nthem. _Livius_, lib. 9. says, The _Roman_ Boys formerly studied the\r\n_Tuscan_ Language, as now they do the _Greek_. And in his 28th\r\nBook,--\"_Hanibal_ erected an Altar, and dedicated it with a large\r\nInscription of all his Atchievements, in the _Greek_ and _Punick_\r\nTongues. _Idem Lib._ 40. Both Altars and Inscriptions on them in the\r\n_Greek_ and _Latin_ Tongues.\" Lastly, I cannot imagine, that _Cæsar_\r\nwou'd have expressed himself (if he had meant, as these wou'd have him)\r\n_Græcis literis scribere_; but rather, _Græcarum literarum formâ_, as we\r\nsee in _Tacitus_, Lib. 11. \"_Novas literarum formas addidit._\" He added\r\nnew Characters of Letters: Having found, that the _Greek_ Literature was\r\nnot begun and perfected at once. And again,--\"_Et forme literis latinis\r\nquæ veterrimis Græcorum_, &c.\"\r\n\r\nNow lest any body shou'd wonder, how the Word _Græcis_ crept into\r\n_Cæsar_'s Text, I will instance you the like Mischance in _Pliny_,\r\n_lib._ 7. _cap._ 57. where 'tis thus written,--\"_Gentium consensus\r\ntacitus primum omnium conspiravit ut_ IONUM _literis uterentur_.\" And\r\nafterwards,--\"_Sequens gentium consensus in tonsoribus fuit._\" And\r\nagain,--\"_Tertius consensus est in Horarum observatione._\" Now who is\r\nthere that sees not plainly the Word IONUM ought to be left out, as well\r\nbecause 'tis apparently unnecessary, (for _Pliny_ had no farther Design\r\nthan to let us know, that Men first of all consented in the Writing and\r\nForm of their Letters) as because 'tis false, that the _Ionian_ Letters\r\nwere the first invented; as _Pliny_ himself in his foregoing Chapter,\r\nand _Tacitus_, _lib._ 11. have told us? I have observed however two\r\nPlaces, (_Gregorius Turonensis_, lib. 5. and _Aimoinus_, lib. 3. cap.\r\n41.) wherein 'tis intimated, that the _Gauls_ used the _Forms_ of the\r\n_Greek_ Letters: For where they speak of King _Chilperick_,--\"_He added_\r\n(say they) _some Letters to our Letters_; and those were, [Greek: o,\r\nps, z, ph]; and sent Epistles to the several Schools in his Kingdom,\r\nthat the Boys should be so taught.\" _Aimoinus_ mentions only three\r\nLetters, [Greek: ch, th, ph]. But we must understand, that these were\r\n_Franks_, not _Gauls_; or rather _Franco-gauls_, who made use of their\r\nown native Language, the _German_ Tongue; not that ancient Language of\r\nthe _Gauls_, which had grown out of use under the _Roman_ Government:\r\nBesides, if the _Francogalli_ had made use of the _Greek_ Letters, how\r\ncame they at first to except these, when they made use of all the rest?\r\nBut we have said enough, and too much of this Matter. As for their\r\nOpinion who believe that the _Gauls_ spoke the _German_ Language,\r\n_Cæsar_ confutes it in that single place, wherein he tells us, that\r\n_Ariovistus_, by Reason of his long Conversation in _Gallia_, spoke the\r\n_Gallick_ Tongue.\r\n\r\nNow for two Reasons their Opinion seems to me to be most probable, who\r\nwrite, that the _Ancient Gauls_ had a peculiar Language of their own,\r\nnot much differing from the _British_: First, because _Cæsar_ tells us\r\nit was the Custom for these _Gauls_ who had a mind to be thoroughly\r\ninstructed in the Learning of the _Druyds_, to pass over into _Britain_;\r\nand since the _Druyds_ made no use of Books, 'tis agreeable to Reason,\r\nthat they taught in the same Language which was used in _Gallia_.\r\nSecondly, because _Tacitus_ in his Life of _Agricola_, writes, that the\r\nLanguage of the _Gauls_ and _Britains_ differ'd but very little: neither\r\ndoes that Conjecture of _Beatus Rhenanus_ seem unlikely to me, who\r\nbelieves the Language which is now made use of in _Basse Bretayne_\r\n[_Britones Britonantes_] to be the Remains of our ancient Tongue. His\r\nReasons for this Opinion may be better learn'd from his own\r\nCommentaries, than told in this Place. The Language which we at present\r\nmake use of, may easily be known to be a Compound of the several Tongues\r\nof divers Nations. And (to speak plainly and briefly) may be divided\r\ninto four Parts. One half of it we have from the _Romans_, as every one\r\nthat understands _Latin_ ever so little, may observe: For besides, that\r\nthe _Gauls_ being subject to the _Romans_, wou'd naturally fall into\r\ntheir Customs and Language, 'tis manifest that the _Romans_ were very\r\nindustrious to propagate their Tongue, and to make it universal, and (as\r\nit were) venerable among all Nations. And to that End settled Publick\r\nSchools up and down, at _Autan, Besancon, Lyons_, &c. as _Valerius\r\nMaximus, Tacitus_, and _Ausonius_ tell us. The other half of it may be\r\nsubdivided thus. One third of it we hold from the _Ancient Gauls_,\r\nanother from the _Franks_, and the last from the _Greek_ Language: For\r\nit has been demonstrated long since by many Authors, that we find\r\ninnumerable _Frank_ (that is, _German_) Words (as we shall hereafter\r\nprove) in our daily Speech. And several learned Men have shewn us, that\r\nmany _Greek_ Words are adapted to our common Use, which we do not owe to\r\nthe Learning and Schools of the _Druyds_, (who I believe spoke no\r\n_Greek_); but to the Schools and Conversation of the _Massilians_, whom\r\nwe formerly mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n    _The State of_ Gaul, _after it was reduced into the form\r\n    of a_ Province _by the_ Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Tis very well known to all learned Men, that _Gaul_, after having been\r\noften attempted with various Success, during a ten Years War, and many\r\nBattels, was at last totally subdued by _Cæsar_ and reduced into the\r\nForm of a Province. It was the Misfortune of this most valiant and\r\nwarlike People, to submit at length to the _Great Beast_, as it is\r\ncalled in Scripture, with which however they so strove for Empire for\r\neight hundred Years, (as _Josephus_ informs us) that no Wars with any\r\nother Nation, so much terrified _Rome_. And _Plutarch_ in his Lives of\r\n_Marcellus_ and _Camillus; Appian_ in his 2d Book of the Civil Wars;\r\n_Livius, lib._ 8. & 10. have recorded, that the _Romans_ were so afraid\r\nof the _Gauls_, that they made a Law, whereby all the Dispensations\r\n(formerly granted to Priests and old Men, from serving in their Armies)\r\nwere made void, in Case of any Tumult or Danger arising from the\r\n_Gauls_; which _Cicero_ takes notice of in his 2d _Philippick_. _Cæsar_\r\nhimself in his 6th Book, and after him _Tacitus_, lib. _de moribus\r\nGermanorum_, do testify, That there was a time wherein the _Gauls_\r\nexcell'd the _Germans_ in Valour, and carried the War into their\r\nTerritories, settling Colonies (by reason of their _great_ Multitudes of\r\nPeople) beyond the _Rhine_.\r\n\r\nNow _Tacitus_ in his Life of _Agricola_, attributes, the _Loss_ of this\r\ntheir so remarkable _Valour_, to the _Loss_ of their Liberty. _\"Gallos\r\nin bellis floruisse accepimus, mox segnities cum otio intravit, amissa_\r\nVirtute _pariter ac_ Libertate--.\" And I hope the Reader will excuse me,\r\nif the Love of my Country makes me add that remarkable Testimony of the\r\nValour of the _Gauls_, mentioned by _Justin, lib._ 24.--\"The _Gauls_\r\n(says he) finding their Multitudes to increase so fast, that their Lands\r\ncou'd not afford them sufficient Sustenance, sent out Three hundred\r\nthousand Souls to seek for new Habitations. Part of these: seated\r\nthemselves in _Italy_; who both took and burnt the City of _Rome_.\r\nAnother part penetrated as far as the Shores of _Dalmatia_, destroying\r\ninfinite Numbers of the _Barbarians_, and settled themselves at last in\r\n_Pannonia_. A hardy bold and warlike Nation; who ventured next after\r\n_Hercules_, (to whom the like Attempt gave a Reputation of extraordinary\r\nValour, and a Title to Immortality) to cross those almost inaccessible\r\nRocks of the _Alps_, and Places scarce passable by Reason of the Cold:\r\nWhere after having totally subdued the _Pannonians_ they waged War with\r\nthe bordering Provinces for many Years.--And afterwards--being\r\nencouraged by their Success, subdivided their Parties; when some took\r\ntheir Way to _Græcia_ some to _Macedonia_, destroying all before them\r\nwith Fire and Sword. And so great was the Terror of the Name of the\r\n_Gauls_, that several Kings (not in the least threatned by them) of\r\ntheir own accord, purchased their Peace with large Sums of Money--. And\r\nin the following Book, he says,--So great was the Fruitfulness of the\r\n_Gauls_ at that time, that like a Swarm they fill'd all _Asia_. So that\r\nnone of the _Eastern_ Kings either ventured to make War without a\r\nmercenary Army of _Gauls_, or fled for Refuge to other than the _Gauls_,\r\nwhen they were driven out of their Kingdoms.\" And thus much may suffice\r\nconcerning their warlike Praises and Fortitude, which (as _Tacitus_\r\ntells us) was quite _gone, as soon as they lost their Liberty_. Yet some\r\nCities, or _Commonwealths_, (as _Phnius, lib. 4. cap. 11._ tells us)\r\nwere permitted to continue free, after the _Romans_ had reduced _Gallia_\r\nto the Form of a Province. Such were the _Nervii_, _Ulbanesses_,\r\n_Suessiones_ and _Leuci_. Also some of the Confederates: and among these\r\nhe reckons the _Lingones_, _Rhemi_, _Carnutes_ and _Ædui_.\r\n\r\nBut we may easily learn from these Words of _Critegnatus_ the\r\n_Arvernian_, mentioned by _Cæsar, lib. 7._ what the Condition was of\r\nthose _Commonwealths_, which had the Misfortune to be reduced into the\r\nForm of a _Province_. \"If\" (says he) \"you are ignorant after what manner\r\nfar distant Nations are used by the _Romans_, you have no more to do,\r\nbut to look at our neighbouring _Gallia_, now reduced into the Form of a\r\nProvince: Which having its Laws and Customs chang'd, and being subjected\r\nto the Power of the _Axes_, is oppress'd with perpetual Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nWe are to understand, there were three kinds of Servitude, or Slavery.\r\nFirst, _To have a Garison of Soldiers imposed upon them, to keep them in\r\nAwe_; yet such Provinces as seemed peaceable and quiet, had no great\r\nArmies maintained in them. For _Josephus_ writes in his 2d Book of the\r\nHist. of the _Jews_, \"That in the Emperor _Titus's_ time, the _Romans_\r\nhad but 1200 Soldiers in Garison in all _Gaul_, altho'\" (says he) \"they\r\nhad fought with the _Romans_ for their Liberty, almost 800 Years, and\r\nhad near as many Cities, as the _Romans_ had Garison-Soldiers.\" A Second\r\nSort of Servitude was, when any Province was made Tributary, and\r\ncompelled to pay Taxes; and to that End were forced to endure a Number\r\nof Tax-gatherers, that is, _Harpies_ and _Leeches_, which suck'd out the\r\nvery Blood of the _Provincials_. _Eutropius_ tells us, in his 6th Book,\r\nThat _Cæsar_, as soon as he had subdued _Gaul_, impos'd a Tax upon it,\r\nby the Name of a Tribute, which amounted to _H. S. Quadringenties:_\r\nwhich is about a Million of our Crowns. A Third Sort of Servitude was,\r\nwhen the Provinces were not permitted to be govern'd by their _own\r\nLaws_; but had Magistrates and Judges, with full Power and Authority\r\n(_cum imperio & securibus_) over Life and Estate, sent them by the\r\nPeople of _Rome_. This Threefold Slavery not only our _Gallia_, but all\r\nthe other Provinces, took most bitterly to heart; and therefore in\r\n_Tiberius's_ Reign, not long after _Cæsar's_ Conquest, _Tacitus_ tells\r\nus, That the Cities of _Gaul_ rebell'd, because of the Continuance of\r\nTaxes, the Extortions of Usurers, and Insolence of the Soldiery. And\r\nafterwards in _Nero's_ Reign, _Suetonius_ writes, \"That the _Gauls_\r\nbeing weary of his Tyranny, revolted. The World\" (says he) \"having for\r\nnear 13 Years, endured such a Sort of Prince, at last shook him off: The\r\n_Gauls_ beginning the Defection.\" Now all _Gallia_ was divided by the\r\n_Romans_ into 16 Provinces, _viz. Viennensis, Narbonensis prima,\r\nNarbonensis secunda, Aquitania prima, Aquitania secunda, Novempopulana,\r\nAlpes maritimæ, Belgica prima, Belgica secunda, Germania prima,\r\nGermania secunda, Lugdunensis prima, Lugdunensis secunda, Lugdunensis\r\ntertia, Maxima Sequanorum, & Alpes Græcas_, as _Antoninus_ in his\r\n_Itinerary_, and _Sextus Rufus_, give an Account of them. But _Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus_ treats of them more particularly.\r\n\r\nBut to return to what we were speaking of: 'Tis not to be imagined how\r\ngrievously, and with what Indignation the _Gauls_ bore the Indecencies\r\nand Plunderings of the _Romans_; nor how frequently they revolted upon\r\nthat Account and because they were not strong enough of themselves to\r\nshake off the _Roman_ Tyranny, 'twas common Custom with them, to hire\r\n_German_ Auxiliaries. These were the first beginnings of the Colonies of\r\nthe _Franks_; For those _Germans_, whether they were beaten by the\r\n_Romans_, or (which is more likely) were bought off by them, began by\r\nlittle and little, to settle themselves in the borders of _Gallia_. This\r\ngave to _Suetonius_, in his Life of _Augustus_, to say,--\"He drove the\r\n_Germans_ beyond the River _Elb_; but the _Suevi_ and _Sicambri_\r\n(submitting themselves); he transplanted into _Gallia_ where he assign'd\r\nthem Lands near the river _Rhine_.\"--Also in his Life of _Therius_,--\"He\r\nbrought (says he) forty thousand of those that had surrendred themselves\r\nin the _German_ War, over into _Gallia_, and allotted them Settlements\r\nupon the Banks of the _Rhine_.\"--Neither must we omit what _Flavius\r\nVepiseus_ records, concerning the Reign of _Probus_ the Emperor; in\r\nwhose time almost all _Gallia_, that is, sixty Cities, revolted from the\r\n_Romans_; and with common Consent, took up Arms for the Recovery of'\r\ntheir Liberty:--\"Having done these things (says he) he march'd with a\r\nvast Army into _Gaul_, which after _Posthumus's_ Death was all in\r\nCommotion, and when _Aurelianus_ was kill'd, was In a Manner possessed\r\nby the _Germans_; there he gain'd so many Victories, that he recover'd\r\nfrom the _Barbarians_ sixty of the most noble Cities of _Gallia_: And\r\nwhereas they had overspread all _Gallia_ without Controul, he slew near\r\nfour hundred thousand of those that had seated themselves within the\r\n_Roman_ Territories, and transplanted the Remainders of them beyond the\r\nRivers _Neckar_, and _Elb_.\"\r\n\r\nBut how cruel and inhuman the Domination of the _Romans_ was in\r\n_Gallia_: How intolerable their Exactions were: What horrible and wicked\r\nLives they led; and with how great Inveteracy and Bitterness they were\r\nhated upon that Account by the _Gauls_, (especially by the _Christians_)\r\nmay best be learn'd from the Works of _Salvianus_, Bishop of\r\n_Marseilles_, which treat of Providence: Therefore 'tis incredible to\r\ntell, what Multitudes of _Germans_ pour'd themselves into _Gallia_; the\r\n_Gauls_ not only not hindring, but even favouring and calling them in.\r\n_Latinus Pacatus_, in his Speech to _Theodesius_, has this Passage;\r\n\"From whence shou'd I begin my Discourse, but from thy Mischiefs, O\r\n_Gallia_! who may'st justly challenge a Superiority in Sufferings, above\r\nall the Nations of the Earth, that have been vexed with this\r\nPlague?\"--Now 'tis most plain both from _Sidonius Apollinaris_, and\r\nespecially from the above-mentioned _Salvianus_, in many Places of his\r\nWritings, that our _Franks_ were a Part of those _German_ Nations, who\r\nthus entred into _Gallia_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Original of the_ Franks; _who having possessed\r\n    themselves of_ Gallia, _changed its Name, into that of_\r\n    Francia, _or_ Francogallia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Order of our Discourse requires, that we should now enquire into the\r\nOriginal of the _Franks_, and trace them from their first Habitations,\r\nor (as it were) their very Cradles: In which Disquisition 'tis very much\r\nto be admired, that no mention has been made of them by _Ptolomy_,\r\n_Strabo_, or even by _Tacitus_ himself, who of all Writers was most\r\naccurate in describing the Names and Situations of all the _German_\r\nNations: and 'tis plain, the _Franks_ were a _German_ People, who\r\npossessed most part of _Europe_ for many Years, with great Reputation;\r\nof which we will quote but a few Instances out of many.\r\n\r\nFirst, _Joannes Nauclerus_ says thus,--\"_Charles_ the Great was call'd\r\n_King_ of the _Franks_; which is as much as to say, _King_ of _Germany_\r\nand _France_.\" Now 'tis demonstrable, that at that time all _Gallia\r\nTransalpina_, and all _Germany_ from the _Pyrenæen_ Mountains, as far as\r\n_Hungary_, was called _Francia_: This last was called _Eastern France_,\r\nthe former _Western France_; and in this all true Historians agree.\r\n\r\n_Eguinarthus_, in his Life of _Charlemain_, says,--\"The Banks of the\r\nRiver _Sala_, which divides the _Taringi_ from the _Sorabi_, were\r\nafterwards inhabited by those called the _Eastern Franks_.\" _Otto\r\nFrising._ _Chron._ 5. _cap._ 4. speaking of King _Dagaber_'s Reign, \"The\r\nBounds of the _Franks_ Dominions reach'd now (says he) from _Spain_, as\r\nfar as _Hungary_, being two most noble Dukedoms, _Aquitania_ and\r\n_Bavaria_\";--but much more at large, _lib._ 6. _cap._ 17. And after him\r\n_Godfrey_ of _Viterbo_, in his _Chronic. part. 17. sub Anno_ 881,\r\n\"_Arnulphus_ (says he) ruled all _Eastern Francia_, which is now called\r\nthe _Teutonick_ Kingdom, or _Germany_; that is to say, _Bavaria, Suabia,\r\nSaxonia, Turingia, Frisia_ and _Lotharingia_; but _Odo_ was king of\r\n_Western France_.\" Again, _sub Anno_ 913. \"It is apparent by the\r\nAuthority of many Writers, that the Kingdom of _Germany_, which the\r\nEmperor _Frederick_ at present holds, is part of the Kingdom of the\r\n_Franks_; for there (on both sides of the _Rhine_) the first _Franks_\r\nwere seated; which as far as to the Limits of _Bavaria_, is now called\r\n_Eastern France_: But _Western France_ is that Kingdom which lies on\r\nboth Sides the Rivers _Seine_ and _Loire_\"--And again he says, \"In the\r\ntime of _Charles_ the Great, King of the _Franks_, all _Gallia_, that is,\r\n_Celtica, Belgica_, and _Lugdunensis_ and all _Germany_ which reaches\r\nfrom the _Rhine_ as far as _Dalmatia_, made but one Kingdom;\r\nwhich was called _Francia_\"--Almost all which Quotations have been taken\r\nout of _Otto_, as I said before. 'Tis to be noted, that _Rhegino_ writes\r\nthus, in _Chron. anni_ 577.--\"After the Death of King _Pipin_, _Lewis_\r\nhis Son (who had been present at his Father's Decease and celebrated his\r\nFunerals) kept his Residence at _Francfort_, the principal Seat of the\r\n_Eastern Kingdom_.\" _Luitprandus Ticinensis says_, _lib. 1. cap._ 6.--\"It\r\nwas order'd that _Wido_ shou'd have for his Share, that which Men call\r\nthe _Roman France_, and _Berengarius_ shou'd have Italy.\" And a little\r\nafter,--\"When he had march'd thro' the Territories of the _Burgundians_,\r\nhe purposed to enter _Roman France_, &c.\" Now it was call'd _Roman\r\nFrance_, first, because the _Franks_ had possessed themselves of that\r\n_Gallia_, which was under the _Roman_ Obedience. Secondly, because the\r\n_Roman_ Language prevail'd in that Country, as we formerly told you:\r\nWhence arose the Saying, _Loqui Romanum_, of such as used not the\r\n_German_ or _Frank_; but the _Latin_ Tongue. Otto Frisingius, _chron._ 4.\r\n_cap. penult._ says,--\"It seems to me, that those _Franks_ who dwell in\r\n_Gallia_, borrowed the Language, which they make use of to this Day,\r\nfrom the _Romans_; for the others who stay'd about the _Rhine_, and in\r\n_Germany_ use the _Teutonick_ Tongue.\"--And in Imitation of him,\r\n_Godfridus_, part. 17. cap. 1.--\"The _Franks_ (says he) seem to me to\r\nhave learn'd the Language which they make use of to this Day, from the\r\n_Romans_, who formerly dwelt in those Parts.\"--From all these 'tis\r\napparent, that the Reputation and Power of the _Franks_ was\r\nextraordinary great; as 'twas fitting for such as were Masters of a\r\ngreat Part of _Europe_.\r\n\r\nMoreover we find, that those _Germans_ which were transplanted by the\r\nEmperor _Frederick_ the IId, into the Kingdoms of _Naples_ and _Sicily_,\r\nand establish'd there as a presidiary Colony, were called _Franks_.\r\n_Petrus de Vineis, lib. epist. 6. cap. 25._ [Footnote: These are only\r\nbroken pieces of Sentences, to prove, that the _Germans_ (establish'd in\r\n_Naples_ and _Sicily_) were called, and actually were _Franks_.]\r\n--\"_Following (says he) the Law and Custom of the_ Franks, _in this\r\nInstance, that the Eldest Brother to the Exclusion of all the Younger\r\nsucceeds, even in the Camp it self._\" Imp. Freder. 2. Neapol. constit.\r\nlib. 2. tit. 32. speaking of those _Franks, \"who upon Occasion trusted\r\nthe Fortune of their Lives, and of all their Estates, to the Event of a\r\nDuel, or single Combat_.\" And again,--\"_The aforesaid manner of Proof,\r\nwhich all who observe the Rites of the_ Franks _made use of_\"--. Also\r\n_lib. 2. tit. 33_.--\"_which Law, our Will is, shall in all Causes be\r\ncommon both to the_ Franks _and_ Longobards.\"\r\n\r\nMatters being thus plain, 'tis strange that _Gregory_ Bishop of _Tours_\r\n(who writ concerning the Original of the _Franks_ 800 Years ago) shou'd\r\nsay, in the first Part of his History, That altho' he had made diligent\r\nEnquiry about the Rise and Beginning of the _Franks_, he could find\r\nnothing certain: notwithstanding he had seen an ancient Book of a\r\ncertain Historian of theirs, called, _Salpitius Alexander_; who affirms\r\nnothing, either of their first Habitations, or the Beginnings of their\r\nDomination.\r\n\r\nBut we have found out, that these People originally came from that\r\nCountry which lies between the _Rhine_ and the _Elb_, and is bounded on\r\nthe _West_ by the Sea, almost in the same Tract where the greater and\r\nthe lesser _Chauci_ dwelt. \"A People (says _Tacitus_) the most noble\r\namong all the _Germans_, who founded their Greatness and maintained it\r\nby Justice.\" These were next Neighbours to the _Batavians_; for 'tis\r\nagreed on all Hands, that the _Franks_ had their first Seats near the\r\nSea-shore, in very marshy Grounds; and were the most skilful People in\r\nNavigation, and Sea-fights, known at that time: Whereof we have the\r\nfollowing Testimonies. First, in _Claudian_, who congratulating\r\n_Stilicon's_ Victory, writes thus;\r\n\r\n--_Ut jam trans fluvium non indignante_ Chayco\r\n  _Paseat_ Belga _pecus, mediumque ingressa per_ Albin\r\n  Gallica Francorum _montes armenta pererrent_.\r\n\r\nIn which Place he makes use of a Poetical License, and calls those\r\nPeople _Chayci_, which the Geographers call _Chauci_. Now that they were\r\nseated near the Sea, that Panegyrical Oration made to _Constantine_ the\r\nGreat, is a Testimony: \"_Quid loquar rursus_, &c. What should I speak\r\nmore of those remote Nations of the _Franks_, transplanted not from\r\nPlaces which the _Romans_ of old invaded; but plucked from their very\r\noriginal Habitations, and their _farthest Barbarous Shores_, to be\r\nplanted in the waste Places of _Gallia_; where with their Husbandry,\r\nthey may help the _Roman_ Empire in time of Peace; and with their\r\nBodies, supply its Armies in time of War--.\" And in another Panegyrick,\r\nby _Eumenius_ the Rhetorician, we find this Passage, \"_Aut hæc ipsa_,\r\n&c. Or this Country, which was once overspread with the Fierceness of\r\nthe _Franks_, more than if the Waters of their Rivers, _or their Sea_,\r\nhad cover'd it;\" but now ceases to be barbarous, and is civilized. To\r\nthe same Purpose is _Procopius_ Testimony, in his first Book of the\r\n_Gothick War_; for where he describes the place where the _Rhine_ falls\r\ninto the Ocean; \"In these Parts (says he) there are great Marshes, where\r\nof old the _Germans_ dwelt; a barbarous People, and at that time of\r\nsmall Reputation, which now are called _Franks_--.\" And _Zonaras_, in\r\nthe 3d Tome of his _Annals_, quotes this very Passage of _Procopius_.\r\nAlso _Flavius Vopiscus_, in his Life of _Probus_, tells us, That the\r\n_Franks_ were discomfited by _Probus_ in their inaccessible\r\nMarshes.--_Testes sunt Franci inviis strati paludibus._ Also _Sidonius\r\nApollinaris_ says thus;\r\n\r\n   \"_Francorum & penitissimas paludes,\r\n    Intrares venerantibus Sicambris._\"\r\n\r\nNow what we have said concerning the Neighbourhood of the _Franks_ to\r\nthe _Chauci_, may be plainly proved by comparing of Places, and the\r\nDescriptions of their particular Seats. Those of the _Chauci_ are\r\ndescribed by _Pliny_, _lib._ 16. _cap._ 1. Those of the _Franks_ by the\r\n_Rhetorician Panegyrist_, above mentioned: For _Pliny_ says thus, \"We\r\nhave seen in the _Northern_ parts the Nations of the _Chauci_, called\r\n_Majores & Minores_, where twice every 24 Hours the Ocean is forcibly\r\ndriven in a great way over the Land; thro' a vast Passage which is\r\nthere, making it a perpetual Controversy of Nature; and a Doubt, whether\r\nit ought to be reckon'd part of the Land or of the Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe Panegyrist speaks in these Terms, \"_--Quanquam illa Regio_, &c. When\r\nthy noble Expeditions, O _Cæsar_, have proceeded so far, as to clear and\r\nconquer that Country, which the _Rhine_ runs through, with his cunning\r\nMæanders or Windings, [_Meatibus callidis_, for so it must be read, and\r\nnot _Scaldis_, as in some Copies,] and embraces in his Arms a Region,\r\nwhich I can scarce call Land; 'tis so soak'd with Water, that not only\r\nthe Marshy part of it gives way, but even that which seems more firm,\r\nshakes when trod upon, and trembles at a Distance under the Weight of\r\nthe Foot.\"\r\n\r\nWe think therefore we have made it plain from what _Seats_ the Nation of\r\nthe _Franks_ first came into _Gallia_; that is to say, from that marshy\r\nCountry which lies upon the _Ocean_, between the Rivers _Elb_ and _Rhine_:\r\nwhich may be further confirm'd by this Argument. That the _Franks_ were\r\nvery well skill'd in maritime affairs, and sail'd far and near all about\r\nthose Coasts; For so says _Eutropius_, _lib._ 9. where he gives a short\r\nHistory of the Emperor _Galienus_. \"After this time, when _Carausius_\r\nhad in charge to scour the Sea-coasts of _Belgia_ and _Armorica_, then\r\ninfested by the _Franks_ and _Saxons_, &c.\" The very same thing _Paulus\r\nOrosius_ mentions, _lib._ 7. Also what the _Panegyrist_, before cited,\r\nsays in a certain Place, has Reference to this.--\"The _Franks_ (says he)\r\nare cruel above all others; the tide of whose warlike Fury surmounting\r\nthat of their very Ocean it self, carried them to the Sea-coasts of\r\n_Spain_, which they very much infested with their Depredations.\" And\r\ntherefore the Emperor _Justinian_, when he explains to the _General\r\nGovernor_ of _Africk_ the duty of his Office, makes mention of those\r\n_Franks_ which were seated in a certain part of _Gallia_, bordering upon\r\n_Spain_.\r\n\r\nBut we find a very memorable Passage; which highly sets forth the great\r\nGlory of their war-like Atchievements, in another place of that\r\nPanegyrick; _viz._ That a small Body of _Franks_, which _Probus_, the\r\nEmperor had overcome and carried captive into _Pontus_, seiz'd on some\r\nShips, wandred all about the Sea-coasts of _Græcia_ and _Asia_, invaded\r\n_Sicily_, took _Syracusa_, and afterwards laden with Booty, return'd\r\ninto the Ocean thro' the _Streights_ of _Gibraltar_. \"Recursabat in\r\nanimos sub _Divo Probo_ & paucorum ex _Francis_ Captivorum incredibilis\r\naudacia, & indigna foelicitas: qui à Ponto usque correptis navibus,\r\nGræciam Asiamque populati, nec impunè plerisque Lybiæ littoribus\r\nappulsi, ipsas postremò navalibus quondam victoriis nobiles ceperant\r\nSyracusas: & immenso itinere permensi, Oceanum, qua terras rupit\r\nintraverant: atque ita eventu temeritatis, offenderant, nihil esse\r\nclausum piraticæ desperationi quò navigiis pateret accessus.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as farther Arguments of what I have been proving, may be added all\r\nthose Places in several Authors, which inform us that the Habitations of\r\nthe _Franks_ were Bordering upon the _Batavians_. The same\r\n_Rhetorician_, in his Speeches to _Maximianus_ and _Constantine_,\r\nsays,--\"Many thousand _Franks_, who had crossed the _Rhine_, and invaded\r\n_Batavia_, with other Countries on this Side, were slain, driven out, or\r\ncarried away captive.\"\r\n\r\nBesides there is a notable Instance in _Corn. Tacitus_, lib. 20. where\r\nspeaking of the Neighbourhood of _Frisia_ and _Batavia_ to each other,\r\nhe mixes the _Caninesates_ among them, whose Custom in Electing their\r\nKings was, (as I shall hereafter shew) the very same with that of the\r\nFranks.--\"Ambassadors (says he) were sent to the _Caninesates_, to\r\npersuade them to enter into the Confederacy: That People inhabit one\r\npart of the Island, equal as to their Descent, Laws and Valour, to the\r\n_Batavians_; but inferior in Number.--And again--_Brinnio_ being set\r\nupon a Shield (according to the Custom of the Country) and hoisted up on\r\nMen's Shoulders, was chosen their Commander.\" Which Words will prove of\r\nno small Authority for us, when we come hereafter to that Part of the\r\nControversy.\r\n\r\nThe Case being so; I cannot forbear wondring at the Opinion of the\r\nLearned _Andreas Tarnebus_, who despising the Authority of so many grave\r\nand ancient Writers, says, that he thinks the _Franks_ were originally\r\nof _Scandinavia_: because in _Ptolomy_ he finds the _Phirassi_ seated in\r\nthat Peninsula, which Word he will needs suppose to be corrupted; and\r\nthat, instead of it, the Word _Franci_ ought to be there: but brings no\r\nReason for his Opinion more than his own mere guess, tho' this Opinion\r\ndiffers manifestly from all other ancient Authors.\r\n\r\nAs to all those who are pleas'd with Fables, and have deduced the\r\nOriginal of the _Franks_ from the _Trojans_, and from one _Francion_, a\r\nSon of _Priam_, we can only say, that they furnish Materials for _Poets_\r\nrather than _Historians_: And among such, _William Bellay_ deserves the\r\nfirst Place; who, tho' he was a Person of singular Learning and\r\nextraordinary Ingenuity; yet in his Book, which treats of the\r\nAntiquities of _Gallia_ and _France_, seems rather to have design'd a\r\n_Romance_, like that of _Amadis_, than a true History of the\r\n_Francogallican_ Affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Name of the_ Franks, _and their sundry Excursions;\r\n    and what time they first began to establish a Kingdom in_\r\n    Gallia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I think it requisite that we should enquire a little more carefully\r\ninto this Name of _Franks_; which, as we told you before, is not to be\r\nfound in any of the ancient Descriptions of _Germany_. That I may no\r\nlonger detain the Reader in Suspence, it must needs be, that either the\r\nNation of the _Franks_, by which such mighty things were done, was at\r\nfirst very obscure and mean, (as we see in _Switz_, an ordinary Village)\r\nyet because the first beginning of the Liberty of those Countries\r\nproceeded from thence, gave the name of _Switzers_ to all the rest of\r\nthe _Cantons_: Or (which seems to me most probable) this Appellation had\r\nits Original from the Occasion; _viz._ When those that set up for the\r\nprime Leaders and Beginners, in recovering the publick Liberty, called\r\nthemselves _Franks_; by which name the _Germans_ understood such as were\r\n_Free_, and under no Servitude; as the Writers of that Nation do\r\nunanimously hold: And therefore in ordinary Speech, by a _Frank_ was\r\nmeant a _Freeman_, by a _Franchise_, an _Asylum_, or Place of Refuge;\r\nand _Francisare_ signified to restore to liberty and freedom. The first\r\nProof we shall give of this, is, what _Procopius_ in his first Book of\r\nthe Gothick Wars relates. The _Franks_ (says he) were anciently by a\r\ngeneral name call'd _Germans_; but after they exceeded their Limits,\r\nthey obtain'd the name of _Franks_: Of the same Opinion I find _Gregory\r\nof Tours_, the _Abbot_ of _Ursperg_; _Sigibertus_ and _Ado_ of _Vienne_,\r\nand _Godfrey_ of _Viterbo_ to have been, _viz._ That they had the Name\r\nof _Franks_ from their _freedom_, and from their _ferocity_, (alluding\r\nto the sound, of the words _Francos Feroces_), because they refused to\r\nserve as Soldier under _Valentinian_ the Emperor, and to pay Tribute as\r\nother Nations did. A second Proof may be that of _Cornelius Tacitus_,\r\nwho in his 20th Book, speaking of the _Caninesates_, whom we have\r\nformerly demonstrated to have been the very-next Neighbours, if not the\r\ntrue _Franks_ themselves, and, of their Victory over the _Romans_, he\r\nhas this expression: _Clara ea victoria, &c._ \"That Victory (says he) was\r\nof great Reputation to them immediately after it, and of great Profit in\r\nthe Sequel; for having by that Means got both Weapons and Ships into\r\ntheir Possession, which before they were in great want of; their Fame\r\nwas spread over all _Germany_ and _Gaul_, as being the first beginners\r\nof liberty;\" _Libertatis Auctores celebrabantur._ For the _Germans_\r\nthereupon sent Ambassadors, offering their Assistance. May the _Omen_\r\nprove lucky! and may the _Franks_ truly and properly deserve that name;\r\nwho after having shaken off that Yoke of _Slavery_, imposed upon them by\r\n_Tyrants_, have thought fit to preserve to themselves a commendable\r\n_liberty_ even under the Domination of _Kings_: _For to obey a King is\r\nnot servitude_: neither are all who are govern'd by Kings, presently for\r\nthat Reason to be counted _Slaves_, but such as submit themselves to the\r\nunbounded Will of a _Tyrant_, a _Thief_, and _Executioner_, as Sheep\r\nresign themselves to the Knife of the Butcher. Such as these deserve to\r\nbe called by the vile names of _Servants_ and _Slaves_.\r\n\r\nTherefore the _Franks_ had always _Kings_, even at that very time when\r\nthey profess'd themselves the _vindicators_ and _assertors_ of the\r\n_publick liberty_: And when they constituted _Kings_, they never\r\nintended they shou'd be _Tyrants_ or _Executioners_, but _keepers_ of\r\ntheir _Liberties, Protectors, Governors_ and _Tutors_. Such, in short,\r\nas we shall describe hereafter, when we come to give an Account of the\r\n_Francogallican_ Government.\r\n\r\nFor, as to what a certain, foolish and ignorant _Monk_, called _John\r\nTurpin_, has wrote (in his Life, or rather Romance of _Charlemagn_)\r\nconcerning the Origins of the Word _Frank_, viz. That whoever\r\ncontributed Money towards the Building of St. _Denis's Church_, should\r\nbe called _Francus_, that is, a freeman, is not worthy of being\r\nremembred, no more than all the rest of his trifling Works; stuft'd full\r\nof old Wives Tales, and meer Impertinencies.\r\n\r\nBut this may be truly affirm'd, that this name of _Franks_, or (as\r\n_Corn. Tacitus_ interprets it) _Authors_ of _Liberty_, was an _Omen_ so\r\nlucky and fortunate to them, that through it they gain'd almost\r\ninnumerable Victories. For after the _Franks_ had quitted their ancient\r\nSeats upon that glorious Design, they deliver'd not only _Germany_,\r\ntheir common Country, but also _France_ from the Tyranny and Oppression\r\nof the _Romans_; and at last (crossing the _Alps_) even a great part of\r\n_Italy_ itself.\r\n\r\nThe first mention made of this illustrious name, we find in _Trebellius\r\nPollios_ Life of the Emperor _Gallienus_, about the 260th Year after\r\n_Christ_. His Words are these: \"Cum, &c. Whilst _Gallienus_ spent his\r\ntime in nothing but Gluttony and shameful Practices, and govern'd the\r\nCommonwealth after so ridiculous a manner, that it was like Boys play,\r\nwhen they set up Kings in jest among themselves; the _Gauls_, who\r\nnaturally hate luxurious Princes, elected _Posthumus_ for their Emperor,\r\nwho at that time was _Gallienus's_ Lieutenant in _Gaul_ with imperial\r\nAuthority. Gallienus thereupon commenced a War with _Posthumus_; and\r\n_Posthumus_ being assisted by many Auxiliaries, both of the _Celtæ_ and\r\nthe _Franks_, took the Field along with _Victorinus_--.\" By which Words\r\nwe may plainly perceive, that the _Gauls_ crav'd the Assistance of the\r\n_Franks_; that is, of these _Authors_ or _Beginners of liberty_, to\r\nenable them to shake off the Tyrant _Gallienus's_ Yoke: Which same thing\r\n_Zonaras_ hints at in his Life of _Gallienus_, when he says, [Greek:\r\nepolemise de phrangois], &c.--We find another mention made of the same\r\nPeople in _Flavius Vopiscus's_ Life of _Aurelian_, in these Words:--\"At\r\nMentz the Tribune of the 6th Legion discomfited the _Franks_, who had\r\nmade Incursions, and overspread all _Gallia_; he slew 700, and sold 300\r\nCaptives for Slaves.\"--For you must not expect that our _Franks_, any\r\nmore than other Nations in their Wars, were constantly victorious, and\r\ncrown'd with Success. On the contrary, we read that _Constantine_,\r\nafterwards call'd the _Great_, took Prisoners two of their Kings, and\r\nexposed them to the Wild Beasts at the publick shews. Which Story both\r\n_Eutropius_ in his 9th Book, and the _Rhetorician_ in that Panegyrick so\r\noften quoted, make mention of.\r\n\r\nAnd because the same _Rhetorician_ in another place speaks of those Wars\r\nin the Confines of the _Batavi_, which we have shewn not to be far\r\ndistant from the _Franks_, I will set down his Words at Length. _Multa\r\nFrancorum millia, &c._ \"He slew, drove out, and took Prisoners many\r\nthousand _Franks_, who had invaded _Batavia_, and other Territories on\r\nthis side the _Rhine_.\" And in another Place says, \"He clear'd the\r\nCountry of the _Batavians_, which had before been possess'd by several\r\nNations and Kings of the _Franks_; and not satisfied with only\r\novercoming them, he transplanted them into the _Roman_ Territories, and\r\nforced them to lay aside their Fierceness as well as their Weapons.\"\r\nFrom which place we are given to understand, not obscurely, that\r\n_Constantine_, (being constrain'd to do so by the _Franks_) granted them\r\nLands within the Bounds of the _Roman_ Empire. _Ammianus_, lib. 15.\r\nwrites, that the _Franks_, during the Civil Wars between _Constantine_\r\nand _Licinius_, sided with _Constantine_, and fought very valiantly for\r\nhim. And in other places of the same Book he records, that during the\r\nReign of _Constantine_, the Son of _Constantine_, great numbers of\r\n_Franks_ were at that _Court_ in high favour and authority, with\r\n_Cæsar_. \"Afterwards, says he, _Malarichus_ on a sudden got power,\r\nhaving gained the _Franks_; whereof at that time great numbers\r\nflourish'd at Court.\"--During the Reign of _Julian_, call'd the\r\n_Apostate_, the same _Franks_ endeavour'd to restore the City of\r\n_Cologne_ (which was grievously oppress'd by _Roman_ Slavery) to its\r\nliberty: and forced it, after a long Siege, to surrender thro' Famine;\r\nas the same _Ammianus_ tells us, _lib._ 12. And because one Band of\r\nthose _Franks_ fix'd their Habitations upon the Banks of the River\r\n_Sala_, they were thereupon called _Salii_; concerning whom he writes in\r\nthe same Book,--\"Having prepar'd there things, he first of all march'd\r\ntowards the _Franks_; I mean those _Franks_ which were commonly called\r\n_Salii_, who had formerly with great boldness fix'd their Habitations\r\nwithin the _Roman_ Territories, near a place called _Toxiandria_.\"\r\nAgain, in his 20th Book he makes mention of that Country possess'd by\r\nthe _Franks_ beyond the _Rhine_, and called _Francia_.--\"Having on a\r\nsudden pass'd the _Rhine_, he enter'd the Country of those _Franks_\r\ncalled _Attuarii_, a turbulent sort of People, who at that time made\r\ngreat Havock on the Frontiers of _Gallia_.\"--And in his 30th Book, where\r\nhe speaks of King _Macrianus_, with whom _Valentinian_ the Emperor had\r\nlately made a Peace on the Banks of the _Rhine_, in the Territory of\r\n_Mentz_,--\"He died, says he, in _Francia_, whilst he was utterly wasting\r\nwith Fire and Sword all before him, being kill'd in an Ambush laid for\r\nhim by that valiant King _Mellobandes_.\" Now of this _Mellobandes_, King\r\nof the _Franks_, the same Author in his following Book gives this\r\nCharacter; \"That he was brave and valiant, and upon the score of his\r\nMilitary Virtue constituted great Master of the Houshold by the Emperor\r\n_Gratianus_, and Lieutenant-General (in conjunction with _Nannienus_) of\r\nthat Army which was sent against the _Lentiates_, a People of\r\n_Germany_.\" Afterwards, by virtue of a Treaty concluded between the\r\n_Franks_ and the Emperor _Honorius_, they defended the Frontiers of the\r\n_Roman Gallia_ against _Stilicon_: For _Orosius_ tells us in his last\r\nBook, \"That the Nations of the _Alani_, _Suevi_ and _Vandali_, being\r\n(together with many others) encouraged by _Stilicon_; pass'd the\r\n_Rhine_, wasted the Territories of the _Franks_, and invaded _Gallia_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Emperor _Honorius_'s time, we have very little in History\r\nextant concerning the _Frank_'s Warlike Deeds. For to those Times must\r\nbe apply'd what St. _Ambrose_ writes in his Letter (the 29th) to\r\n_Theodesius_ the Emperor: That the _Franks_ both in _Sicily_ and many\r\nother Places, had overthrown _Maximus_ the _Roman_ General. \"He (says\r\nhe, speaking of _Maximus_) was presently beaten by the _Franks_ and\r\n_Saxons_ in all places of the Earth.\" But in the Reign of _Valentinian_\r\nthe 3d, that is, about the 450th Year of _Christ_, 'tis plain, by the\r\nconsent of all Writers, that _Childeric_, the Son of _Meroveus_, King of\r\nthe _Franks_, compleated the Deliverance of _Gallia_ from the _Roman_\r\nTyranny, after a continued Struggle of more than 200 Years; and was the\r\nfirst that established in _Gallia_ a firm and certain Seat of Empire:\r\nFor altho' some reckon _Pharamond_ and _Clodio-crinitus_ as the first\r\nKings of the _Franks_, yet without doubt there were many before them,\r\nwho (like them) had cross'd the _Rhine_, and made Irruptions into\r\n_Gallia_: but none had been able to settle any peaceable Dominion within\r\nthe Limits of _Gallia_. Now _Meroveus_, who is commonly reckon'd the 3d\r\nKing; tho' he was indeed King of the _Franks_, yet he was a Stranger and\r\na Foreigner, not created King in _Gallia_, not King of the\r\n_Francogalli_; that is to say, not elected by the joint Suffrages of\r\nboth Nations united: In short, all these were Kings of the _Franci_, and\r\nnot of the _Francogalli_. But _Childeric_, the Son of _Meroveus_, was\r\n(as we said before) the first that was elected by the publick Council of\r\nthe associated _Franks_ and _Gauls_, and he was created King; of\r\n_Francogallia_ presently after his Father _Meroveus_ had been kill'd in\r\na Battel against _Attila_, during the Reign of _Valentinian_ the Third,\r\na dissolute and profligate Prince. At which time the _Angli_ and _Scoti_\r\ntook Possession of _Great Britain_; the _Burgundians_ of _Burgundy,\r\nSavoy and Dauphine_; the _Goths_ of _Aquitain_: the _Vandals_ of\r\n_Africk_ and _Italy_, nay of _Rome_ it self; the _Hanni_ under their\r\nLeader _Attila_ wasted _Gallia_ with Fire and Sword. This _Attila_ having\r\nan Army of about Five hundred thousand Men, over-ran all _Gallia_ as far\r\nas _Thoulouse_. _Ætius_ was at that time Governor of _Gallia_, who\r\nfearing the Power of _Attila_, made a League with the _Goths_, and by\r\ntheir assistance defeated _Attila_ in a Battel; wherein, 'tis said, they\r\nslew no fewer than a Hundred and eighty thousand Men. But the Conqueror\r\n_Ætius_ being suspected by _Valentinian_ of aspiring to the Empire, was\r\nafterwards, by his Command, put to Death; and within a little while\r\nafter, he himself was slain by _Maximus_ before-mention'd.\r\n\r\nDuring these Transactions, _Meroveus_, King of the _Franks_, taking his\r\nOpportunity, pass'd the _Rhine_, with a great Army; and joyning in\r\nConfederacy with many Cities, who assisted in the common Cause of the\r\npublick Liberty, possess'd himself at length of the innermost Cities\r\nbelonging to the _Celtæ_, between the _Seine_ and the _Garonne_. He\r\nbeing dead, and both Nations (the _Gauls_ and _Franks_) united into one\r\nCommonwealth; they unanimously elected _Childeric_, the Son of\r\n_Meroveus_, for their King, placing him upon a Shield according to\r\nancient Custom; and carrying him upon their Shoulders thrice round the\r\nplace of Assembly, with great Acclamations of Joy, and universal\r\nCongratulation, saluted him _King of Francogallia_. Of all which\r\nparticulars, _Sidonius Apollinaris_, _Gregorius Turonensis_, _Otto\r\nFrising_, _Aimoinus_ and others are Witnesses; whose Testimonies we\r\nshall further produce, when we come to treat of the Manner of the\r\nInauguration of the King.\r\n\r\nThe Words of the same _Otto_, in the last Chapter but one of his 4th\r\nBook concerning their taking possession of several Cities, are\r\nthese.--\"The _Franks_, after having pass'd the _Rhine_, in the first\r\nplace put to flight the _Romans_, who dwelt thereabouts; afterwards they\r\ntook _Tournay_ and _Cambray_, Cities of _Gallia_; and from thence\r\ngaining ground, by degrees they subdued _Rheims_, _Soissons_, _Orleans_,\r\n_Cologne_ and _Triers_.\" And thus much may briefly be said touching the\r\nfirst King of _Francogallia_. To which we shall only subjoin this\r\nRemark: [Footnote: Hotoman's _Francogallia_ was written _Anno_ 1573.] _That\r\naltho' the Francogallican Kingdom_ has lasted from that time to this,\r\nalmost One thousand two hundred Years; yet during so long a space, there\r\nare but three Families reckon'd to have possess'd the Throne, _viz._ the\r\nMerovingians; who beginning from Meroveus, continued it to their\r\nPosterity two hundred eighty three Years. The _Carlovingians_, who\r\ndrawing their Original from _Charles the Great_, enjoy'd it 337 Years:\r\nAnd lastly, the _Capevignians_, who being descended from _Hugh Capet_,\r\nnow rule the Kingdom, and have done so for Five hundred and eighty Years\r\npast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n    _Whether the Kingdom of_ Francogallia _was_ hereditary\r\n    _or_ elective; _and the manner of making its_ Kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut here arises a famous Question; the Decision of which will most\r\nclearly show the Wisdom of our Ancestors.--_Whether the Kingdom of\r\nFrancogallia were Hereditary, or conferr'd by the Choice and Suffrages\r\nof the People_, That the _German_ Kings were created by the _Suffrages_\r\nof the _People_. _Cornelius Tacitus_, in his Book _Demoribus Germanorum_,\r\nproves plainly; and we have shown, that our _Franks_ were a _German_\r\nPeople: _Reges ex nobilitate, Duces ex virtute sumunt_; \"Their _Kings_\r\n(says he) they chuse from amongst those that are most eminent for their\r\n_Nobility_; their _Generals_ out of those _that are Famous for their\r\nValour:\"_ Which Institution, [Footnote: 1574.] to this very day, the\r\n_Germans, Danes, Sweeds and Polanders_ do retain. They _elect_ their\r\nKings in a _Great Council of the Nation_; the Sons of whom have this\r\nprivilege (as _Tacitus_ has recorded) to be preferr'd to other\r\nCandidates. I do not know whether any thing cou'd ever have been devised\r\nmore prudently, or more proper for the Conversation of a Commonwealth,\r\nthan this Institution. For so _Plutarch_, in his Life of _Sylla_,\r\nplainly advises. \"Even (says he) as expert Hunters not only endeavour to\r\nprocure a Dog of a right good Breed, but a Dog that is known to be a\r\nright good Dog himself; or a Horse descended from a generous Sire, but a\r\ntryed good Horse himself: Even so, those that constitute a Commonwealth,\r\nare much mistaken if they have more regard to _kindred_, than to the\r\n_qualification_ of the Prince they are about to set over them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that this was the Wisdom of our Predecessors in constituting the\r\n_Francogallican Kingdom_, we may learn, First, from the last Will and\r\nTestament of the Emperor _Charlemagn_, publish'd by _Joannes Nauclerus_\r\nand _Henricus Mutius_; in which there is this Clause--\"And if any Son\r\nshall hereafter be born to any of these, my three Sons, whom the People\r\nshall be _willing to Elect_ to succeed his Father in the Kingdom; My\r\nWill is, that his Uncles do consent and suffer the Son of their Brother\r\nto reign over that portion of the Kingdom which was formerly his\r\nFather's.\" Secondly, What _Aimoinus, lib._ I. _cap._ 4. says, of\r\n_Pharamond_, commonly counted the first King of the _Franks_, in these\r\nWords.--\"The _Franks electing_ for themselves a King, according to the\r\ncustom of other Nations, raised up _Pharamond_ to the Regal Throne.\" And\r\nagain, _lib._ 4.--\"But the Franks took a certain _Clerk_ or _Priest_\r\ncalled _Daniel_; and as soon as his Hair was grown, _establish'd_ him in\r\nthe Kingdom, calling him _Chilperic_.\" And _lib._ 4. _cap._ 67.--\"King\r\n_Pipin_ being dead, his two Sons, _Charles_ and _Carlomannus_, were\r\n_elected Kings by the consent of all the_ Franks.\" And in another\r\nplace--\"As soon as _Pipin_ was dead, the _Franks_ having appointed a\r\nsolemn _Convention, constituted_ both his Sons Kings over them, upon\r\nthis foregoing condition, that they should divide the whole Kingdom\r\nequally between them.\"--And again, after the Death of one of the\r\nBrothers--\"But _Charles_, after his Brother's Decease, was _constituted_\r\nKing by the _consent_ of all the _Franks_.\" Also, towards the end of his\r\nHistory of _Charles the Great_, he says, \"The Nobility of the _Franks_\r\nbeing solemnly assembled from all parts of the Kingdom; he, in their\r\npresence, called forth to him _Lewis_ King of _Aquitain_, (the only one\r\nof _Heldegardis's_ Sons then living) and _by the advice and consent of\r\nthem all_, constituted him his Associate in the whole Kingdom, and Heir\r\nof the Imperial Dignity.\" Thus much out of _Aimoinus_.\r\n\r\nMany Testimonies of the like nature we find in _Gregorius Turen_ whereof\r\nwe shall cite only these few following, _lib. 2. cap. 12._--\"The\r\n_Franks_ (says he) having _expelled Childeric_; unanimously _elected\r\nEudo_ for their King.\"--Also _lib. 4. cap. 51._--\"Then the _Franks_ (who\r\nonce looked towards _Childebert_ the Elder) sent an Embassy to\r\n_Sigebert_, inviting him to leave _Chilperic_ and come to them, that\r\nthey by _their own Authority_ might make him King.\"--And a little\r\nafter--\"The whole Army was drawn up before him; and having set him upon\r\na Shield, _they appointed_ him to be their King.\"--And in another\r\nplace--\"_Sigebert_ agreeing to the _Franks_ Proposals, was placed upon a\r\nShield, according to the Custom of that Nation, and proclaimed King; and\r\nso got the Kingdom from his Bother _Chilperic_\"--And presently\r\nafter--\"The _Burgundians_ and _Austrasians_ concluded a Peace with the\r\n_Franks_, and made _Clotharius_ King over them in all the three\r\nKingdoms,\" Which particular the _Abbot_ of _Ursperg_ confirms. \"The\r\n_Burgundians_ (says he) and _Austrasians_ having struck up a Peace with\r\nthe _Franks_, advanced _Clotharius_ to be King and sole Ruler of the\r\nwhole Kingdom.\"--And in another place--\"The _Franks_ appointed one of\r\nhis Brothers, called _Hilderic_, who was already King of the\r\n_Austrasians_, to be also their King.\"\r\n\r\nTo this matter belongs what _Luitprandus Ticinensis_ writes, _lib. i.\r\ncap. 6._ \"And when he was about to enter into that _Francia_ which is\r\ncalled _Roman_, (after having cross'd the Countries of the\r\n_Burgundians_) several Ambassadors of the _Franks_ met him, acquainting\r\nhim that they were returning Home again; because being tired with long\r\nexpectation of his coming, and not able any longer to be without a King,\r\nthey had _unanimously_ Chosen _Odo_ or _Wido_, tho' 'tis reported the\r\n_Franks_ did not take _Wido_ upon this occasion for their King, &c.\"\r\n\r\nBut concerning this _Odo_, the Story is memorable which _Sigibert_\r\nrelates; from whence we may more clearly be inform'd of the manner of\r\ntheir _rejecting_ their King's _Son_, and \"_setting up_ another in his\r\nstead.\" For (_sub anno_ 890.) he says thus \"But the _Franks_ neglecting\r\n_Charles_ the Son of _Lewis the Stammerer_, a Boy scarce ten years old;\r\nElected, _Odo_ for their King, who was Son of _Duke Robert_, slain by\r\nthe _Normans_.\" Also _Otto Frinsing Chronic. lib. 6. cap. 10._ \"The\r\n_Western Franks_ (says he) with the consent of _Arnolphus_, chose for\r\ntheir King _Odo_ a valiant Man, and Son of _Robert_.\"--Also in the\r\n_Appendix_ to _Gregory_ of _Tours_, lib. 15. cap. 30. \"After the Death\r\nof _Dagobert, Clodoveus_ his Son obtain'd his Father's Kingdom, being at\r\nthat time very young, and all his _Leudes_ (that is, Subjects) _rais'd_\r\nhim to the Throne, _in Villa Masolano_.\"--Also _Sigebert_, in _chronic.\r\nanno_ 987.--\"_Lewis_ King of the _Franks_ being dead, the _Franks_ had a\r\nmind to transfer the Kingdom to _Charles_ the Brother of _Lotharius_;\r\nbut whilst he spent too much time, deliberating with his Council\r\nconcerning that Affair, _Hugo_ acquires the Kingdom of the _Franks_,\r\n&c.\" There are many Testimonies, of the same Kind in _Ado_, viz. _anno_\r\n686.--\"_Clodoveus_ the King dying, the _Franks_ elect _Clotarius_ his\r\nSon for their King.\" And again, \"--_Clotarius_ having reigned four\r\nYears, died, in whose stead the Franks elected _Theodorick_ his\r\nBrother--.\" Again, _anno_ 669. \"The _Franks_ establish'd in the Kingdom\r\na certain Clerk, called _Daniel_, having caused him to quit his Tonsure\r\nand Orders, and name him _Chilperic_.\" And again,--\"The _Franks_\r\nappoint, as King over them, _Theodoric_ the Son of _Dagobert_\"--. Also\r\n_Otto Frising_ chron. 6. cap. 13.--\"_Otto_ (says he) King of the\r\n_Franks_ being dead, _Charles_ was created King by unanimous Consent--.\"\r\nThe Appendix to _Greg. Turon._ _lib._ 11. _cap._ 101. says thus, \"When\r\n_Theodoric_ was dead, the _Franks_ elected _Clodoveus_ his Son, who was\r\nvery young, to be their King.\" And _cap._ 106. \"But the _Franks_ appoint\r\none _Chilperick_ to be their King.\" Also _Godfrey_ of _Viterbo_, _chron.\r\npart._ 17. _cap._ 4. \"--But _Pipin_ in being elected by the _Franks_,\r\nwas declared King by Pope _Zacharias_, _they having thrust their\r\ncowardly King_ Hilderic _into a Monastery_.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these Proofs, and very many others like them, I think 'tis most\r\nplain, that the Kings of _Francogallia_ were made such rather by the\r\n_Suffrages_ and _Favour_ of the _People_, than by any _Hereditary\r\nRight_. Of which a farther Argument may be the _Forms_ and _Ceremonies_\r\nused by our _Ancestors_, at the Inauguration of their _Kings_. For we\r\nobserve, the very same Custom was continued at the _Election_ of our\r\nKings, which we told you before out of _Cornelius Tacitus_, was formerly\r\npractised by the _Caninesates_, (the _Franks_ own Country-men) _viz._\r\nthat they set their _Elected King_ upon a _Shield_, and carried him on\r\nhigh on Men's Shoulders. So did we; for whoever was chosen by the Votes\r\nof the People, was set upon a _Shield_, and carried thrice round the\r\nplace of publick Meeting for _Election_, or round about the Army on\r\nMen's Shoulders, all the People expressing their joy by Acclamations,\r\nand clapping of Hands. _Greg. Turen. lib._ 2. where he makes mention of\r\nKing _Clodoveus's_ Election,--\"But they (says he) as soon as they heard\r\nthese things, applauding him both with their Hands and Tongues, and\r\nhoisting him on a Shield, _appointed_ him to be their King--.\" Also\r\n_lib._ 7. _cap._ 10. where he speaks of _Gondebaldus_,--\"And there (says\r\nhe) placing their King upon a _Shield_, they lifted him up; but 'tis\r\nreported, that as they were carrying him round the third time, he fell\r\ndown; so that he was scarcely kept from tumbling to the very Ground by\r\nthose that stood about him.\" Of which Accident _Aimoinus, lib. 3. cap.\r\n6._ gives us this Account,--\"They called forth _Gondebaldus_, and\r\naccording to the Custom of the ancient _Franks_, proclaimed him their\r\nKing, and hoisted him on a Shield; and as they were carrying him the\r\nthird time round the whole Army, of a sudden they fell down with him,\r\nand could scarce get him up again from the Ground--.\" The like says\r\n_Ado. Vien._ Ætat. 6.--_\"Sigebertus_ consenting to the _Franks_, was\r\nplaced upon a Shield, according to the _Custom of that Nation_, and\r\nproclaimed King\": And peradventure from hence arose that Form among\r\nthose Writers, who treat of the Creation of a King;--_In Regem elevatus\r\nest._\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the third Part of this Controversy, in order to\r\nunderstand, how great the _Right and Power of the People_ was, both in\r\n_making_ and _continuing_ their Kings. And I think it is plainly prov'd\r\nfrom all our Annals, that the _highest Power_ of _abdicating_ their\r\n_Kings_, was lodged in the _People_. The very first that was created\r\nKing of _Francogallia_, is a remarkable instance of his Power. For when\r\nthe People had found him out to be a profligate lewd Person, wasting his\r\ntime in Adulteries and Whoredoms, they removed him from his Dignity by\r\nuniversal Consent, and constrain'd him to depart out of the Territories\r\nof _France_: and this was done, as our Annals testify, in the Year of\r\nChrist 469. Nay, even _Eudo_, whom they had placed in his stead, abusing\r\nhis Power thro' excessive Pride and Cruelty, was with the like Severity\r\n_turned out_. Which Fact we find attested by _Gregory of Tours, lib. 2.\r\ncap. 12. Aimoinus, lib. 1. cap. 7. Godfrey of Viterbo, part. 17. cap. 1.\r\nSigibertus, sub annis 461, & 469. \"Childeric_ (says _Gregorius_) being\r\ndissolved in Luxury, when he was King of the _Franks_, and beginning to\r\ndeflower their Daughters, was by his Subjects _cast out of the Throne\r\nwith Indignation_; whereupon he finding they had a Design to kill him,\r\nfled into _Thoringia_.\" But the _Abbot of Ursperg_ says, \"the People were\r\nunwilling to kill him, but contented themselves with having _turn'd him\r\nout, because he was a dissolute Man_, and a Debaucher of his Subjects\r\nDaughters--.\" _Sigibertus_ says,--\"_Hilderick_ behaving himself\r\ninsolently and luxuriously, the _Franks thrust him out of the Throne_,\r\nand made _Ægidius_ their King.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this most glorious and famous Deed of our Ancestors, deserves the\r\nmore diligently to be remark'd, for having been done at the very\r\nBeginning, and as it were, the Infancy of that Kingdom; as if it had\r\nbeen a Denunciation, and Declaration, that the Kings of _Francogallia_\r\nwere made such, upon certain _known terms and Conditions_; and were _not\r\nTyrants_ with _absolute unlimited_ and _arbitrary_ Power.\r\n\r\nTheir Successors also, keeping up the same Custom, in the Year of\r\n_Christ_ 679, forced _Childeric_, their Eleventh King, to _Abdicate_,\r\nbecause he had behaved himself insolently and wickedly in his\r\nGovernment. And he having formerly caused a certain Nobleman, called\r\n_Bodilo_, to be tied to a Stake and whipp'd, without bringing him to a\r\nTryal, was a few Days after slain by the same _Bodilo_. Our Authors are\r\n_Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 44_, _Trithemius, anno 678._ and _Sigebertus,\r\nanno 667_.\r\n\r\nThe Severity of our Ancestors appear'd in the same Manner a little while\r\nafter, in the Instance of their 12th King _Theodoric_; who being a\r\nwicked and covetous Prince, \"the _Franks_ (says _Aimoinus_) _rose up\r\nagainst him_, and _cast him out of the Kingdom_, cutting off his hair by\r\n_force_,\" lib. 4. cap. 44.--_Ado_, Ætat. 6. anno 696. but _Sigebertus_\r\nsub anno 667. imputes a great many of his Crimes to _Ebroinus_ his\r\nFavourite and chief General. [Footnote: _Præfectus Regius._] \"King\r\n_Theodorick_\" (says he) \"was _deposed_ by the _Franks_, because of the\r\nInsolence of _Ebroinus_, and his Brother _Hilderick_ was with unanimous\r\nConsent _chosen_ King.\" And _Ado_ says, \"The _Franks_ cast _Theodorick_\r\nout of the Kingdom, shaved _Ebroinus_ in the Monastery of _Lexovium_,\r\nand afterwards raised _Childerick_ to be King over them.\" Also the\r\nAppendix to _Greg. of Tours, lib. II. cap. 64._--\"The _Franks_ rise up\r\nin _Arms_ against _Theodorick, cast him out_ of the Kingdom, and cut off\r\nhis Hair: They shaved also _Ebroinus.\"_\r\n\r\nThe like Virtue our Ancestors exerted in the Case of _Chilperick_ their\r\n18th King, whom they _forced to abdicate the Kingdom_, [Footnote: _Regno se\r\nabdicare coegerunt._] and made him a Monk, judging him unworthy to sit\r\nat the Helm of so great an Empire, [Footnote: _Propter inertiam._] _by\r\nreason of his Sloth._ Whereof _Aimoinus_, lib. 4. cap. 61. _Sigibertus_\r\nand _Trithemius_, anno 750. and _Godfrey_, Chronic. part. 17. cap. 4.\r\nare our Witnesses.\r\n\r\nAgain, a sixth Example of the like Severity is extant in _Charles the\r\nGross_ their 25th King; who for the like _Cowardise_, and because he had\r\ngranted away part of _France_ to the _Normans, suffering his Kingdom to\r\nbe dismembred_, was [Footnote: _Ab optimatibus Regni repudiatas._]\r\n_rejected and turn'd out_ by the _Nobility_ and _Gentry_ of the Kingdom,\r\nas _Sigebertus_ tells us _anno 890_. Which same thing _Godfridus_\r\nrecords, _part. 17._ But more at large _Otto Frising, chron. 6. cap. 9._\r\nwhere he adds this memorable Passage,--\"This Man (says he) who next to\r\n_Charles the Great_, had been the King of greatest Power and Authority\r\nof all the Kings of the Franks, was in a short time reduced to so low a\r\nCondition, that he wanted Bread to eat, and miserably begged a small\r\nAllowance from _Arnolphus_, who was _chosen_ King in his stead, and\r\nthankfully accepted of a poor Pension: From whence we may observe the\r\nuncertain and miserable State of all Human Greatness; that he who had\r\ngovern'd all the _Eastern_ and _Western_ Kingdoms, together with the\r\n_Roman_ Empire, shou'd at last be brought down to such a Degree of\r\nPoverty, as to want even Bread.\" A Seventh Instance is _Odo_ the 26th\r\nKing, who after he had been elected King in the Room of _Charles_ the\r\nSon of _Lewis_ the _Stammerer_, was in the 4th Year of his Reign, by the\r\n_Franks, banish'd_ into _Aquitain_, and commanded to abide there; they\r\nreplacing in his stead the same _Charles_ the Son of _Lewis_. Which Fact\r\nis recorded by _Sigebertus_, sub anno 894. _Aimoinus_ lib. 5. cap. 42.\r\nand _Godfridus_ part. 17.\r\n\r\nWe must add to this Number _Charles_ the 27th King, sirnamed (because of\r\nhis _Dullness_) [Footnote: _Propter Stuporem ingenii._] _Charles_ the\r\n_Simple_: Who having thro' his Folly suffer'd his Kingdom to run to\r\nDecay, and lost _Lorrain_ (which he had before recover'd) was _taken and\r\ncast into Prison_, and _Rodolphus_ was _chosen_ in his place, as\r\n_Aimoinus, lib. 5. cap. 42._ and _Sigebertus, anno 926._ do testify.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n    _What Rule was observ'd concerning the Inheritance of the\r\n    deceased King, when he left more Children than one._\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that we have above said, tends to prove, that the Kingdom of\r\n_Francogallia_ in old times, did not descend to the Children by _Right\r\nof Inheritance_ (as a private Patrimony does); but was wont to be\r\nbestow'd by the _Choice and publick Suffrages of the People_: So that\r\nnow there is the less Room left for the Question,--What Rule was\r\nobserved in Relation to the Children of the deceased King, when he left\r\nmore than one behind him. For since the Supreme Power nor only of\r\n_Creating_, but also of _dethroning_ their Kings, was lodged in the\r\n_Convention_ of the _People_, and _Publick Council_ of the Nation; it\r\nnecessarily follows, that the _ordering_ the _Succession_ (whether they\r\nshould give it entirely to one, or divide it) was likewise in the\r\n_People_. Altho' in this place another Question may arise, _viz._\r\nsupposing the People shou'd _reject_ the Son of their King, and _elect_\r\na Stranger, whether any thing should be allowed to the first to maintain\r\nhis Dignity? For the Solution, of which 'tis to be understood, that\r\nLawyers reckon four Kinds of such Goods, as may be properly said to be\r\nunder the King's [Footnote: _In Regis ditione._] Governance; _viz._ the\r\nGoods of _Cæsar_, the Goods of the _Exchequer_; the Goods of the\r\n_Publick_, and _Private_ Goods. The Goods of _Cæsar_ are such as belong\r\nto the _Patrimony_ of every Prince, not as he is _King_, but as he is\r\nLudovicus, or _Lotharius_, or _Dagobertus_. Now this Patrimony is called\r\nby the _Gallican_ Institutions, _The King's Domain_; which cannot be\r\nalien'd, but by the Consent of the _publick Council_ of the Nation, as\r\nwe shall make it appear hereafter, when we come to treat of the\r\nAuthority of that _Council_. The Goods of the _Exchequer_ are such as\r\nare given by the _People_, partly to defend the King's Dignity, and\r\npartly appropriated to the Uses and Exigencies of the _Commonwealth_.\r\nThe Goods of the _Publick_ (as the Lawyers call them) are such as\r\ninseparably belong to the _Kingdom_ and _Commonwealth_. The _private_\r\nGoods are reckon'd to be such Estate, Goods and Fortune, as are esteemed\r\nto belong to every Father of a Family. Therefore upon the Death of any\r\nKing, if the Kingdom be conferr'd on a Stranger, the _Patrimonial_\r\nEstate, as Lawyers call it, (being what was not in the King's Power to\r\nalienate) shall descend by Inheritance to his Children: But that which\r\nbelongs to the _Kingdom_ and _Commonwealth_, must necessarily go to him\r\nwho is chosen King, because it is part of the _Kingdom_. Altho' it may\r\nbe reasonable, that Dukedoms, Counties, and such like (by Consent of the\r\n_publick Convention_ of the People) may be assigned to such Children for\r\nthe Maintenance of their Quality; as _Otto Frising_, Chron. 5. cap. 9.\r\nand _Godfrey of Viterbo_, tell us, That _Dagobert_ Son of _Lotharius_\r\nbeing made King, assigned certain Towns and Villages near the _Loire_,\r\nto his Brother _Heribert_ for his Maintenance. Which _Aimoinus_\r\nconfirms, _lib._ 4. cap. 17. and further adds, that he made a Bargain\r\nwith him, to live as a private Person, and to expect no more of his\r\nFather's Kingdom. Also in his 61. _chap._ where he speaks of King\r\n_Pipin_, \"He bestowed (says he) some Counties on his Brother _Grison_,\r\naccording to the _Order_ of the Twelve Peers.\" And to this belongs what\r\n_Greg. Turon._ writes, _lib. 7. cap. 32._--\"_Gondobaldus_ sent two\r\nAmbassadors to the King with consecrated Rods in their hands, (that no\r\nViolence might be offer'd them by any body, according to the Rites of\r\nthe _Franks_) who spoke these Words to the King, _Gondobaldus_ says, he\r\nis a Son of King _Clotharius_, and has sent us to claim a due Portion of\r\nhis Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Question, as far as it relates to the Succession of\r\nthe Kingdom; I can find out no certain Rule or Law in _Francogallia_\r\ntouching that Matter; because (as I said before) the Kingdom was not\r\nhereditary. 'Tis true, that in many _Noble Patrimonies_ there was what\r\nwe call _Fiefs_, Feuda; as _Otto Frising. lib. 2. cap. 29._ observes,\r\n\"'Tis the Custom (says he) in _Burgundy_, which is also in most of the\r\nother Provinces of _France_, that the Authority of the Paternal\r\nInheritance always falls to the Elder Brother, and his Children, whether\r\nMale or Female; the others looking on him as their Lord--.\" And that the\r\nsame was practised among the whole Nation of the _Franks, Petrus de\r\nVincis_, lib. epist. 6. epist. 25. and in other Places of his Writings,\r\nsets forth at large. But in the Succession of the Kingdom a different\r\nRule was observ'd. For our Records do testify, that in old times the\r\nKingdom of _Francogallia_, upon the Death of the King, was very often,\r\nnot bestowed by the People on any one of his Sons, but divided into\r\nconvenient Parcels, and a part assigned to each of them. Therefore when\r\n_Clodoveus_ the 2d King dyed, _anno_ 515. who left four Sons,\r\n_Theodorick, Clodoveus, Childebert_, and _Clotharius_, we find the\r\nKingdom was thus divided among them; _Theodorick_ had the Kingdom of\r\n_Metz_ for his Share, _Clodoveus_ that of _Orleans, Clotharius_ that of\r\n_Soissons_, and _Childebertus_ that of _Paris_, as 'tis recorded by\r\n_Agathius_, lib. hist. 1. _Greg. Turon._ lib. 3. cap. 1. _Aimoinus_ lib.\r\n2. cap. 1. _Rhegino_ sub anno 421.\r\n\r\nAgain, after the Death of _Clotharius_ the 4th King, the Kingdom was\r\ndivided among his four Sons. So that _Cherebertus_ had that of _Paris:\r\nGuntranus, Orleans: Chilpericus, Soissons:_ and _Sigebertus_ that of\r\n_Rheims_--, Greg. _lib. 4. cap. 22._ Aimoinus _lib. 3. cap. 1._ Rhegino\r\n_sub anno_ 498.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, _Otto Frising._ chron. 5. cap. 9. and _God. Viterb._\r\ntell us, That about the Year 630, when _Lotharius_ the 7th King died,\r\n_Dagobertus_ his Son reigned _singly_ in _France_, and assigned to his\r\nBrother _Heribert_ some Cities and Villages on the River _Loire_, for\r\nhis Maintenance. For from _Clodoveus_'s Time till now, the Kingdom of\r\nthe _Franks_ was confusedly subdivided among the Sons, and the Sons\r\nSons, each of which reigned over the part allotted him.--\"The Extent of\r\nthe Kingdom of the _Franks_ reaching now from _Spain_, as far as to\r\n_Hungary: Dagobert_ being sole King of all the _Franks_, gave Laws to\r\nthe _Bavarians_.\" So says _Godefridus_, not without good Grounds, as\r\nmany wise Men have thought. For, as _Justin_ tells us, _lib. 21._ \"That\r\nKingdom will be much more potent, which remains under the Domination of\r\none Person, than when 'tis divided among many Brothers.\"\r\n\r\nBut after some Years, when the Kingdom of the _Franks_ was excessively\r\nenlarged on all Sides, and King _Pipin_ was dead, the _General Council_\r\nof the _Gauls_ changed this Method again. Which serves to confirm what\r\nwe said before; _viz._ That the _whole Power_, relating to that Matter,\r\nwas lodged in that _Council._ For _Eguinarthus_, in his Life of\r\n_Charlemagn_, writes thus, \"--After King _Pipin'_s Death, the _Franks_\r\nhaving assembled themselves in a _solemn general Convention_, did there\r\n_appoint_ both his Sons to be their Kings, upon this Condition, that\r\nthey shou'd equally divide the whole body of the Kingdom between them:\r\nAnd that _Charles_ shou'd reign over that part of it, which their Father\r\n_Pipin_ enjoy'd; and _Carloman_ over the other Part which their _Uncle_\r\nheld.\"\r\n\r\nAlso the _Abbot of Ursperg_ says,--\"When _Pipin_ was dead, his two Sons\r\n_Charles_ and _Carloman_, by the _Consent of all the Franks_, were\r\ncreated Kings, upon Condition, that they shou'd divide the whole body of\r\nthe Kingdom equally between them.--\" The same Method in dividing the\r\nKingdom, was practised after the Death of _Charlemagn_, as 'tis manifest\r\nby his last Will and Testament, recorded by _Johannes Nauclerus_, and\r\n_Eguinarthus_'s History of his Life. Wherein we find almost all _Europe_\r\nso divided among his three Sons, that nothing was assigned either as a\r\nPortion or Dower, to his Daughters; but the marrying and providing for\r\nthem was entirely trusted to the Care and Prudence of their Brothers.\r\n_Otto Frisingensis_, chron. 6. cap. 6. and _Rhegino_ in chron. anno 877.\r\nassure us, that the same Manner of dividing the Kingdom was practis'd in\r\n_East-France_, after the Death of _King Lewis the Stammerer_, in 874.\r\nAgain, some Years after, _anno_ 880. after King _Lewis_ the 23d King's\r\nDeath, the very same way of dividing the Kingdom was made use of; which\r\nhowever we are to observe, was _not in_ the _Power_ and _Arbitriment_ of\r\n_the Kings themselves_; but done by the _Authority_ of the _Publick\r\nCouncil_, as we may easily collect from these Words of _Aimoinus_, lib.\r\n5. cap. 40. \"The Sons (says he) of _Lewis_, late King of the _Franks_,\r\nmet at _Amiens_, and divided their Father's Kingdom between them,\r\n_according to the Direction of their faithful Subjects._\"\r\n\r\nFrom all which Arguments 'tis very plain, that anciently there was no\r\ncertain Law or Right of _Francogallia_ touching this Matter; but the\r\n_whole Power of disposing_ of it was lodged in the _Publick Council_ of\r\nthe Nation. Indeed afterwards in the Reign of _Philip_ the 3d, (the 41st\r\nKing) it was ordained, that certain Lordships might be set out and\r\nassigned to younger Brothers: But even of this Law there were various\r\nInterpretations, and many Controversies arose concerning Daughters; so\r\nthat we can deliver nothing for certain in this Affair; only thus much\r\nwe may truly say, That _if the Ancient Institution of our Ancestors\r\nought to be our Rule, the Determination of this whole Matter must be\r\nleft to the Publick General Council of the Nation:_ that according to\r\nthe Number of Children, some particular Lordships or Territories, may\r\n_(by its Authority)_ be assigned for their Maintenance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n    _Of the_ Salick Law, _and what Right_ Women _had in the\r\n    King's their Father's Inheritance_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause we have undertaken to give an Account of the _Law_ and _Right_\r\nof _Regal Inheritance_, we must not omit making Mention of the _Salick\r\nLaw_; which is both daily discours'd of by our Countrymen, and in the\r\nMemory of our Forefathers serv'd to appease a great and dangerous\r\nContention, which arose touching the Succession to the Crown. For when\r\n(_Anno_ 1328.) _Charles the Fair_, Son of _Philip the Fair_, died,\r\nleaving his Wife with Child of a Daughter, (which some Months after was\r\nborn) _Edward King of England_ (Son of _Isabella_, the Daughter of\r\n_Philip the fair_, and Sister to _Charles_ lately dead) claimed the\r\nInheritance of his Grandfather's Kingdom as his Right. But _Philip of\r\nValois_, Cousin germain by the Father's Side to the deceased King,\r\nstanding up, alledged that there was an ancient Regal Law, called the\r\n_Salick Law_, by which _all Women_ were excluded from the Inheritance of\r\nthe Crown. Now this Law both _Gaguinus_ and other Writers of like Stamp\r\ntell us, was written by _Pharamond_; and he calls it a most famous Law,\r\neven to his Time. For in his Life of _Philip of Valois_; \"The _Salick_\r\nLaw (says he) was a Bar to _Edward_'s Title; which Law being first given\r\nby _Pharamond_ to the _Franks_, has been religiously observed, even to\r\nthose Days. By that Law, only the Heirs Male of our Kings are capable of\r\ngoverning the Kingdom, and no Females can be admitted to that Dignity.\r\nThe Words of that Law are these: _Nulla hereditatis portio de terrâ\r\nSalicâ ad mulierem venito; Let no Part of the Inheritance of_ Salick\r\n_Land come to a Woman_. Now (says _Gaguinus_) the _French_ Lawyers call\r\n_Salick_ Land, such as belongs only to the King, and is different from\r\nthe _Alodial_ which concerns the Subjects; to whom, by that Law, is\r\ngranted a free Dominion of any thing, not excluding the Princely\r\nAuthority.\" And to the same Purpose, not only almost all the\r\n_Francogallican Historians_, but even all the _Lawyers_ and\r\n_Pettifoggers_ have wrote to this Day, as _Paponius_ testifies,\r\n_Arrest._ lib. 4. cap. 1. So that now the mistake has prevailed so far,\r\nas to have obtain'd the Force of a Law. To explain this, it must be\r\nremembred (which we formerly gave an Account of) that the _Franks_ had\r\ntwo Seats of their Empire, and two Kingdoms; One in _France_, which\r\nremains to this Day; The other beyond the _Rhine_, near the River\r\n_Sala_; from whence they were called _Salii_, and _Salici Franci_\r\n(joyning the two Names together) but for the most part briefly _Salici_;\r\nthe Kingdom of these last, and even their very Name is in a Manner\r\nextinct. _Ammianus Marcellinus_ makes mention in his History (as we told\r\nyou before) of these _Salii_, and shews, that they are called the\r\n_Eastern Franks_, as the others were called the _Western_. Now as there\r\nwere two Kingdoms of the _Franks_, so they had different Laws: those\r\nthat belonged to the _Salii_, were called _Salick_; those that belonged\r\nto the _Francogalli_, were called _French. Eguinarthus_ in his Life of\r\n_Charles_ the Great says thus:--\"After he had assumed the Imperial\r\nTitle, finding that his Peoples Laws were in many Things deficient,\r\n(_for the_ Franks _have two Laws very different from each other in many\r\nCases_,) he thought of adding such as were wanting.\"--The Author of the\r\nPreface to the _Salick_ Law has this Passage.--\"The renowned Nation of\r\nthe _Franks_, before it was converted to the Catholick Faith, enacted\r\nthe _Salick_ Law by the Great Men of the Nation, who at that Time were\r\ntheir Governors; and from among a great many, four Persons were chosen;\r\n_Wisogast, Arbogast, Salogast_, and _Windogast_; who, during three\r\nConventions [_tres mallos_] carefully perusing all Causes from their\r\nOriginal, gave their Judgment and Decree of every one of them in this\r\nManner, &c.--\" _Sigebertus_ in Chron. anni 422. & _Otto Frising_, lib.\r\n4. cap. penult. make use of almost the same Words. \"From that time (say\r\nthey) the Laws recommended to them by _Wisigastaldus_ and _Salogastus_,\r\nbegan to be in Force. By this _Salogastus_, they tell us, that Law was\r\ninvented, which from his Name is to this Day called the _Salick_ Law;\r\nand the most noble of the _Franks_, called _Salici_, observe it at this\r\ntime.\"--Thus say the old Chronographers. By which we may refute the\r\nError of such as derive the _Salick_ Law, _à Sale_, that is, _Prudence_;\r\nor what is called corruptly _Lex Salica_, instead of _Gallica_; than\r\nwhich nothing can be more absurd. But much greater Errors spring from\r\nthe same Fountain: First, That People are so far imposed upon by those\r\nAuthors, as to believe the _Salick_ Law had reference to the _Publick\r\nRight_ of the _Commonwealth_ and the _Government_, also to the\r\n_Hereditary Succession_ of the Kingdom. Now the very Records or Tables\r\nof this _Salick_ Law were not many Years ago found and brought to Light;\r\nfrom whose Inscription it appears, that they were first written and\r\npublish'd about _Pharamond'_s time: Besides, that all the Heads and\r\nArticles, both of the _Salick_ and _French_ Laws, were Constitutions\r\nrelating only to _private Right_ between Man and Man, and meddled not\r\nwith the _Publick_ Right of the Kingdom or Commonwealth: among the rest,\r\none Chapter, _tit. 62._ has this in it.--\"Of the _Salick_ Land, no Part\r\nor Portion of Inheritance passes to a Female; but this falls to the Male\r\nOff-spring; that is, the Sons shall succeed to the Inheritance: But\r\nwhere a Dispute shall arise (after a long Course of Time) among the\r\nGrandsons and great Grandsons, _de alode terræ_; [Footnote: _Allodium_ is\r\nthe contrary to _Feudum, Gothick_ words, for which 'tis difficult to\r\nfind proper _English_.] let it be divided, _Non per stirpes sed per\r\ncapita.\"_ The like Law, _Extat apud_ Ripuarios, _tit._ 58. _Item apud_\r\nAnglos, _tit._ 7. Where they are so far from enacting any thing relating\r\nto the Inheritances of Kingdoms, that they do not so much as affect\r\n_Feudal_ Successions, but only belong to _Allodial_; altho' a Portion\r\nwas assigned to Women out of those _Allodial_ Lands. Which Way soever\r\nthis Matter may be, 'tis manifest in the first Place, that altho' no\r\nArticle, either of the _Frank_ or _Salick_ Law were extant, which debars\r\nWomen from the Inheritance of the Crown; yet the Customs and\r\nInstitutions of a Nation, preserv'd inviolate by universal Consent,\r\nduring so many Ages, obtain the Force of a written Law: For tho'\r\n_Childeric_, the Third King, left two Daughters behind him at his Death,\r\nthe Kingdom was given to his Brother _Lotharius_, and his Daughters\r\nexcluded. Again, after the Death of _Cherebert_ the 5th King, who left\r\nthree Daughters; the Succession devolv'd upon his Brother _Sigebert_.\r\nAlso when _Gontrannus_ King of _Burgundy_ and _Orleans_ died, the\r\nKingdom was conferr'd on his Brother _Sigebert_, not on his Daughter\r\n_Clotilda_. Lastly, _Philip_ of _Valois's_ Advocates might with greater\r\nCaution, as well as Efficacy, have argued for him out of the _Feudal_\r\nLaw, by which all Inheritances of _Fiefs_ descend to the Male Issue\r\nonly, and not to the Female, who are not admitted to them. And when\r\nthere happens a Want of Heirs Males in that Line or Branch wherein the\r\nFief is lodged, then the _Feudum_ or _Fief_ returns back to the other\r\nStock or Branch: which was the very Case at that Time. But such Fiefs as\r\nthro' a Depravation of the Law, are convey'd down to Women, cannot\r\nproperly be called _Feuda_, but _Feudastra_, as in other of our Writings\r\nwe have made it appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Right of Wearing a large Head of Hair peculiar to\r\n    the Royal Family._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be amiss in this Place to give some Account of a Custom of\r\nour Ancestors, relating to the Hair worn by the Royal Family: For 'tis\r\nrecorded, that our Forefathers had a particular Law concerning it;\r\n_viz._ That such as were chosen Kings by the People, or were of the\r\nRegal Family, shou'd preserve their Hair, and wear it parted from the\r\nForehead, on both Sides the Head, and anointed with sweet Oyl, as an\r\nOrnament and peculiar Mark of their being of the Royal Family; whilst\r\nall other Persons, how nobly born soever, had no right to wear a large\r\nHead of Hair; but were obliged to go with their Heads shorn or shaved,\r\nupon the Account (as 'tis probable) that they shou'd be more ready and\r\nexpedite in their continual military Exercises, as the _Roman_ Histories\r\ntell us of _Julius Cæsar_, and several others. _Aimoinus_ lib. I cap. 4.\r\nsays--\"The _Franks_ chusing for themselves a King, according to the\r\nCustom of other Nations, raised, _Pharamond_ to the Throne, to whom\r\nsucceeded his Son Clodio crinitus; For at that Time the Kings of the\r\n_Franks_ wore large Heads of Hair. Also lib. 3. cap. 61. _Gundoaldus_\r\nbeing brought up by his Mother after the regal Manner, wore a long Head\r\nof Hair, according to the Custom of the ancient Kings of the _Franks_.\"\r\nIn like Manner _Agathius_, lib. de Bell. Goth. I. where he speaks of\r\n_Clodoveus_, one of our Kings, who was taken in Battel by the\r\n_Burgundians_, (he calls him _Clodamirus_). \"As soon (says he) as his\r\nHorse had thrown him, the _Burgundians_ espying his large Head of Hair,\r\nwhich fell back over his Shoulders, presently knew him to be the Enemy's\r\n_General_; for 'tis not lawful for the Kings of the _Franks_ to cut off\r\ntheir Hair, but even from their Childhood they remain untrimm'd, and\r\nalways keep a large Head of Hair hanging low down upon their Backs.\" And\r\nwe have many Instances that it was our Ancestors Custom, whenever they\r\neither deprived any one of the Crown, or took away all Hopes of\r\nobtaining the Kingdom, to cut off his Head of Hair. _Aimoinus_ in the\r\nsame Place--\"He earnestly beholding him, commanded his Hair to be cut\r\noff, denying him to be his Son.--Also--Having caused his Hair to be cut\r\noff a second Time, he put him in Prison at _Cologne_; from whence making\r\nhis Escape, he fled to _Narses_, and suffer'd his Hair to grow again,\r\n&c.\" Which Story _Gregory_ of _Tours_, lib. 6. cap. 24. likewise\r\nrecords. Also _cap._ 44. where he speaks of King _Theodorick_.--\"The\r\nFranks (says he) rose up in Arms against him, and cast him out of the\r\nKingdom, and cut off his Head of Hair by Force.\" But there is a very\r\nremarkable, or rather horrible Story related by _Gregory_ of _Tours_,\r\nconcerning _Crotilda_, the Queen Mother; who chose rather to have the\r\nHeads of her two Grandsons cut off than their Hair. 'Tis in his 3d Book,\r\n_cap._ 18.--\"Our Mother (says the King to his Brother) has kept our\r\nBrother's Sons with her, and intends to advance them to the Throne; we\r\nmust concert what Measures ought to be taken in this Affair; whether we\r\nshall order their Hair to be cut off, and to reduce them to the State of\r\ncommon Subjects; or whether we shall cause them to be put to Death, and\r\nafterwards divide the Kingdom between us: Then they sent _Archadius_\r\nwith a Pair of Scissars in one Hand, and a naked Sword in t'other to the\r\nQueen; who approaching her, showed them both to her, and said, Your\r\nSons, most Glorious Queen, have sent me to know your Pleasure, what\r\nDestiny you are pleased to allot to these two Youths; whether by\r\nsuffering their Hair to be cut off, you will have them to live; or\r\nwhether you had rather have both their Throats cut. Whereupon She chose\r\nrather to see them both kill'd, than to have their Hair cut off.\" I\r\nfurther observe, that it was the Fashion when our Kings went to single\r\nCombat, to have their long Hair tied up in a large Knot a-top of their\r\nHelmets like a Crest; and that was their Cognizance or Mark in all their\r\nFights. Therefore _Aimoinus_, lib. 4. cap. 18. where he speaks of the\r\ndreadful Combat between King _Dagobert_ and _Bertoaldus_, Duke of the\r\n_Saxons:_ \"The King (says he) having his Hair, together with a Part of\r\nhis Helmet, cut off with a Blow of a Sword on his Head, sent them by his\r\nEsquire to his Father, desiring him to hasten to his Assistance.\"\r\n\r\nNow when I consider what might be the Reasons of this Institution, I can\r\nfind none but this. That since it had been the ancient Custom of the\r\n_Gauls_ and _Franks_ to wear their Hair long (as it was also of the\r\n_Sicambri_, and of most others in those Parts) our Ancestors thought fit\r\nto continue, and in Process of Time to appropriate this Ornament, and\r\nMark of Distinction to the Regal Family. No Person, tho' but\r\nindifferently learn'd, needs any Proof that the _Gauls_ wore their Hair\r\nlong, especially when he calls to mind that of the Poet _Claudian_, ex\r\nlib. in Ruffin. 2.\r\n\r\n  _Inde truces flavo comitantur vertice_ Galli\r\n  _Quos_ Rhodanus _velox_, Araris _quos tardior ambit_,\r\n  _Et quos nascentes explorat gurgite_ Rhenus.\r\n\r\nNow that the _Franks_ did so too, whom we have shewn to be descended\r\nfrom the _Chauci_ or _Chaiici_, that single Passage of the Poet _Lucan_\r\nis sufficient to confirm.\r\n\r\n  _Et vos_ Crinigeros _bellis arcere_ Chaycos\r\n  _Opposui, petitis_ Roman, &c.\r\n\r\nWhich being so, we may easily comprehend the Reason why Strangers, who\r\nwere ill affected towards our Nation, contumeliously called our Kings,\r\nwho wore so great a Head of Hair, _Reges setatos, bristled Kings_; and\r\nnot only so, but (tho' Bristles and long Hair be common to Lyons, Horses\r\nand Swine, all which are therefore called _Setosi_, or _Setigeri_) they\r\nstretched the Contumely so far, as to say, they had Hogs Bristles. From\r\nwhence arose that filthy Fiction and foul Name, [Greek: trichorachaton]\r\nof which _Georgius Cedrenus_ writes thus in his History, [Greek:\r\n\"Helegonto de hoi ek tou genous hekenou katagomenoi kristatoi ho\r\nhermêneuetai trichorachai heichon gar kata tês racheôs autôn trichas\r\nekphuomenas hôs choiroi\"] that is, \"They who were of the Kingly Race\r\nwere called _Cristati_, which may be interpreted _Bristleback'd_;\r\nbecause they had all along their Back bones, Bristles growing out like\r\nSwine\"--, Which Passage of _Cedrenus_, I believe, is corrupted, and\r\ninstead of the Word [Greek: kristatoi], ought to be [Greek: setatoi], or\r\nperhaps both. For as some Persons called them pleasantly _Christati_ by\r\nReason of their large erected Bunch of Hair upon the Tops of their\r\nHelmets; so their Ill-Willers called them upbraidingly _Setati_, or\r\n_Setigeri_. If _Cedrenus_ had not been so very plain in this Passage,\r\nand the Appellation of _Cristati_ be to be retained, I shou'd rather\r\nhave thought they might have been called [Greek: trichocharaktoi], as\r\nbeing remarkable for their large Heads of Hair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n    _The Form and Constitution of the_ Francogallican\r\n    _Government_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Things being thus briefly premised, we think it proper now to set\r\nforth in what Manner the Kingdom of _Francogallia_ was constituted. And\r\nwe have already made it plain, that the _People_ reserv'd to themselves\r\nall the Power not only of _Creating_, but also of _Abdicating_ their\r\n_Kings_. Which Form of Government 'tis manifest our Ancestors had;\r\nbefore they were brought under by the _Romans_, \"So that _the People_\r\n(as _Cæsar_ tells us) _had no less authority and Power over their\r\nKings, than the Kings had over the People_. Populus non minus in Regem,\r\nquam rex in populum imperii ac Potestatis retinet.\" Altho' 'tis probable\r\nthe _Franks_ did not derive this Constitution of their Commonwealth from\r\nthe _Gauls_; but from their Countrymen, the _Germans_; of whom\r\n_Tacitus_, lib. de mor. _Germ._ says,--\"Regibus non est infinita aut\r\nlibera Potestas. Their _Kings_ have not an _Arbitrary_ or _Unlimited\r\nPower_.\" Now 'tis manifest, that no Form of Government is more remote\r\nfrom Tyranny, than this: for not one of the three distinguishing Marks,\r\nor Characteristicks of _Tyranny_, which the old Philosophers make\r\nmention of, can be found in the Form and Constitution of our Government.\r\nFirst, as to a forced Obedience; _i. e._ that a King shou'd rule over a\r\nPeople against their Wills; we have shewn you already, that the _Supreme\r\nPower_, both of _Electing_ and _Abdicating_ their _Kings_, was in the\r\n_People_. Secondly, as to a Life-guard composed of Foreigners, (which\r\nthey reckon the Second Mark of _Tyranny_); so far were our\r\n_Francogallian_ Kings from making use of Mercenary Strangers for their\r\nGuards, that they had not so much as their own Countrymen and Citizens,\r\nfor that Purpose; but placed their whole Trust and Confidence in the\r\nLove and Fidelity of their Subjects; which they thought a sufficient\r\nGuard.\r\n\r\nAs an Argument of this, we may observe what _Gregory of Tours_ writes,\r\nlib. 7. cap. 18. and _Aimoinus_, lib. 3. cap. 63.--\"King _Gontrannus_\r\nbeing inform'd by an ordinary Fellow at _Paris_, that _Faraulphus_ lay\r\nin Wait for him, presently began to secure his Person by Guards and\r\nWeapons; so that he went no whither (not even to the Holy Places)\r\nwithout being surrounded with armed Men and Soldiers.\" We have at\r\npresent a very famous History extant of St. _Lewis_, written by that\r\nexcellent Person _Joannes Jonvillæus_, who lived very familiarly with\r\nthat King for many Years; in which whole History there is not the least\r\nMention made of Guards or Garisons, but only of Porters or Doorkeepers;\r\nwhich in his native Tongue, he calls Ushers.\r\n\r\nNow as to the third Mark of _Tyranny_, which is when Matters are so\r\ncarried, that what is done tends more to the Profit and Will of the\r\n_Person governing_, than to that of the _governed_, or the Good of the\r\n_Commonwealth_; we shall hereafter prove, that the _Supreme_\r\nAdministration of the _Francogallican Kingdom was lodged in the Publick\r\nAnnual Council of the Nation, which in After-Ages was called the\r\nConvention of the Three Estates_. For the Frame of this Government was\r\nthe very same which the _Ancient Philosophers_, and among them _Plato_\r\nand _Aristotle_ (whom _Polybius_ imitates) judged to be the best and\r\nmost excellent in the World, as being made up and constituted of a\r\nMixture and just Temperament of the three Kinds of Government, _viz._\r\nthe _Regal, Noble_, and _Popular_. Which Form of a _Commonwealth,\r\nCicero_ (in his Books _de Republicâ_) prefers to all other whatsoever.\r\nFor since a _Kingly_ and a _Popular_ Government do in their Natures\r\ndiffer widely from each other, it was necessary to add a _third_ and\r\n_middle State_ participating of both, _viz._ that of the _Princes_ or\r\n_Nobility_; who, by Reason of the Splendor and Antiquity of their\r\nFamilies, approach, in some Degree, to the _Kingly Dignity_; and yet,\r\nbeing _Subjects_, are upon that Account on the same Foot and Interest\r\nwith the _Commons_. Now of the Excellency of this Temperament in a\r\nCommonwealth, we have a most remarkable Commendation in Cicero, taken by\r\nhim out of _Plato_'s Books _de Republicâ_; which, because of its\r\nsingular Elegancy, we shall here insert at length.\r\n\r\n\"Ut in fidibus (inquit) ac tibiis, atque cantu ipsò, ac vocibus,\r\ntenendus est quidam concentus ex distinctis sonis, quem immutatum ac\r\ndiscrepantem aures eruditæ ferre non possunt; isque concentus ex\r\ndissimillimarium vocum moderatione concors tamen efficitur, & congruens;\r\nSic ex summis, & mediis, & infimis interjectis ordinibus, ut sonis,\r\nmoderatâ ratione _civitas_, consensu dissimillimorum concinit, & quæ\r\n_harmonia_ a musicis dicitur in _cantu_, ea est in _Civitate concordia_:\r\narctissimum atq; optimum in Repub. vinculum incolumitatis, quæ fine\r\njustitiâ nullo pacto esse potest. _i. e._ As in Fiddles and Flutes, and\r\neven in Singing and Voices, a certain Consort of distinct Sounds is to\r\nbe observed; which if it be alter'd, or not tunable, skilful Hearers\r\ncannot bear or endure: And this Consort of very different Tones, is,\r\nthrough as just Proportion of the Notes, rendred Concord, and very\r\nagreeable: Even so a Commonwealth, judiciously proportioned, and\r\ncomposed of the _first_, the _middlemost_, and the _lowest_ of the\r\n_States_, (just as in the Sounds) through the Consent of People very\r\nunlike to each other, becomes agreeable: And what Musicians in Singing\r\ncall _Harmony_, that in a Commonwealth is _Concord_; the very best and\r\nstrongest Bond of Safety for a Government, which can never fail of being\r\naccompanied with _Justice_.\" Our Ancestors therefore following this\r\nMethod, of a just Mixture of all the three Kinds, in the constituting\r\ntheir Commonwealth, most wisely ordained, that every Year on the\r\n_Calends_ of _May_, a Publick _Council_ of the whole Nation should be\r\nheld: at which _Council_ the great Affairs of the Republick shou'd be\r\ntransacted by the common Consent and Advice of all the _Estates_. The\r\nWisdom and Advantage of which Institution, appears chiefly in these\r\nthree things: First, That in the Multitude of prudent Counsellors, the\r\nWeight and Excellency of Counsel shews it self more apparently, as\r\n_Solomon_ and other Wise Men have said. Secondly, _Because it is an\r\nessential part of liberty, that the same persons, at whose cost and\r\nperil any thing is done, shou'd have it done likewise by their authority\r\nand advice: for_ ('tis a common Saying) _what concerns all, ought to be\r\napproved by all_. Lastly, That such Ministers of State as have great\r\nPower with the Prince, and are in high Employments, may be kept within\r\nthe Bounds of their Duty, thro' the Awe they stand in of this _great\r\nCouncil_, in which all the Demands and Grievances of the Subject are\r\nfreely laid open.--\"For such Kingdoms as are ruled by the arbitrary Will\r\nand Pleasure of _one Prince_, may most justly (as _Aristotle_ in his\r\nthird Book of Politicks observes) be reckon'd Governments of Sheep; and\r\nbrute Beasts, without Wit or judgment; not of Freemen, who are endued\r\nwith Understanding, and the Light of Reason.\" The Case is thus--That\r\neven as Sheep are not guided or tended by one of their own Kind, nor\r\nBoys govern'd by one of themselves, but by something of more Excellency;\r\neven so a Multitude of Men ought not to be ruled and govern'd by one\r\nsingle Person, who perhaps understands and sees less than several others\r\namong them; but by many select Persons, who, in the Opinion of all Men,\r\nare both very prudent and eminent; and who act by united Counsels, and,\r\nas it were, by one Spirit, composed and made up of the Minds of many\r\nWise Men.\r\n\r\nNow whereas it may be objected, that most Kings have a constant _Privy\r\nCouncil_ to advise them in the Administration of publick Affairs: We\r\nanswer, That there is a great deal of Difference between a Counsellor of\r\nthe _King_, and a Counsellor of the _Kingdom_. This last takes care of\r\nthe Safety and Profit of the whole Commonwealth; the other serves the\r\nHumour and studies the Conveniences of one Man only; and besides, these\r\nKing's Counsellors reside, for the most part, in one certain Place; or\r\nat least near the Person of the Prince, where they cannot be supposed to\r\nbe throughly acquainted with the Condition of the more remote Cities or\r\nProvinces; and being debauched by the Luxury of a Court life, are easily\r\ndepraved, and acquire a lawless Appetite of Domineering; are wholly\r\nintent upon their own ambitious and covetous Designs; so that at last\r\nthey are no longer to be consider'd as Counsellors for the Good of the\r\nKingdom and Commonwealth, but Flatterers of a single Person, and Slaves\r\nto their own and Prince's Lusts.\r\n\r\nConcerning this Matter, we have a most excellent Saying of the Emperor\r\n_Aurelian_, recorded by _Flavius Vopiscus_.--\"My Father used to tell me\r\n(says _Aurelian_) that the Emperor _Dioclesian_, whilst he was yet a\r\nprivate Man, frequently said, That nothing in the World was more\r\ndifficult than to govern well. For, four or five Persons combine\r\ntogether, and unanimously agree to deceive the Emperor they determine\r\nwhat shall be approved or disapprov'd. The Emperor, who, for the most\r\npart, is shut up in his Palace, knows nothing of the Truth of Affairs;\r\nhe is compell'd to hear and see only with their Ears and Eyes; he makes\r\njudges, such Persons as do not deserve to be made so; he removes from\r\nOffices in the Commonwealth such as he ought to keep in; in short, a\r\ngood, provident and excellent Emperor is sold by such Counsellors.\"--Now\r\nour Ancestors, in the constituting their Commonwealth, wisely avoiding\r\nthese Mischiefs (as Mariners wou'd do dangerous Rocks) decreed that the\r\n_Publick_ Affairs shou'd be managed by the joynt Advice and Counsel of\r\n_all_ the _Estates_ of the _Kingdom_. To which Purpose the _King_, the\r\n_Nobles_, and the _Representatives_ of the _Commons_ out of the several\r\nProvinces, were obliged to meet at a certain Time every Year. And this\r\nvery same Institution we find to have been that of many other Nations.\r\nFirst in our Ancient _Gallia_, where the Administration of Publick\r\nAffairs was intrusted with the _Common Councel of the chosen Men in the\r\nwhole Nation_ as we have above demonstrated. But because we are now\r\nspeaking of a Kingdom, I shall give Instances of them. 'Tis man felt,\r\nthat in old Times the Council of the _Amphictions_ was instituted in\r\n_Greece_ (as _Suidai_ and others testify) by King _Amphyction_, Son of\r\n_Deucalion_; and therein it was ordained, that at a certain appointed\r\nTime every Year, _Representatives_ chosen out of the Twelve\r\nCommonwealths of _Greece_ shou'd meet at _Thermopylæ_, and deliberate\r\nconcerning all the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom and Commonwealth: For\r\nwhich Reason, _Cicero_ calls this the _Common Council of Græcia_,\r\n_Pliny_ calls it the _Publick Council_.\r\n\r\nWe find the like Wisdom in the Constitution of the _German Empire_,\r\nwherein the _Emperor_ represents the _Monarchical_ State, the _Princes_\r\nrepresent the _Aristocratical_, and the _Deputies of the Cities_ the\r\n_Democratical_; neither can any Matter of Moment appertaining to the\r\nwhole _German Republick_ be firm and ratified, but what is first agreed\r\nupon in that _great Convention of the Three Estates_. To this End was\r\nframed that ancient and famous Law of the _Lacedemonians_, which joyned\r\nthe _Ephori_ to their _Kings_; \"Who, as Plato writes, were designed to\r\nbe like Bridles to the Kings, and the Kings were obliged to govern the\r\nCommonwealth by their Advice and Authority.\" _Pliny_, lib. 6. cap. 22.\r\nmakes mention of the like Practice in the Island of _Taprobana_, where\r\nthe King had thirty Advisers appointed by the People; by whose Counsel\r\nhe was to be guided in the Government of the Commonwealth; \"For fear\r\n(says he) lest the King if he had an unlimited Power should esteem his\r\nSubjects no otherwise than as his _Slaves_ or his _Cattel_.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we find the very same Form of Administration of the Kingdom\r\nof England, in _Polydore Virgil_'s History of _England_, lib. 11. where\r\nhe has this Passage in the Life of _Henry_ the First.--\"Before this Time\r\nthe Kings used to summon a publick Convention of the People in order to\r\nconsult with them, but seldom: So that we may in some Manner say, that\r\nthe Institution derived its Original from _Henry_: which took such deep\r\nRoot, that it has always continued ever since, and still does so; _viz._\r\nThat whatever related to the Well governing or Conservation of the\r\n_Commonwealth_, ought to be debated and determin'd by the _great\r\nCouncil_. And that if either the _King_ or the _People_ shou'd act any\r\nthing _alone_, it shou'd be esteemed _invalid_, and as _nothing_, unless\r\nit were first approved and established by the _Authority of that\r\nCouncil_. And for fear this _Council_ shou'd be cumbred with the\r\nOpinions of an _unskilful Multitude_, (whose Custom it is to distinguish\r\nnothing justly) it was at first establish'd by a certain Law, what\r\n_Sort_ of Persons, and what _Numbers_ either of the _Priests_ or of the\r\n_People_ shou'd be called to this _Council_, which, after a _French_\r\nName, they commonly call _A Parliament_; which every King at the\r\nBeginning of his Reign uses to hold, and as often afterward as he\r\npleases, or as _Occasion_ requires.\" Thus far _Polydore Virgil_.\r\n\r\nBut among all the Laws and Customs of this Kind, there is none so\r\nremarkable as that of the _Spaniards_; who, when they _elect_ a King in\r\nthe _Common-Council_ of _Arragon_, (in order to keep up a perpetual\r\nRemembrance of their Privileges) represent a Kind of Play, and introduce\r\na certain _Personage_, whom they call by the Name of _The Law of\r\nArragon_, [Footnote: _La justitia di Arragon._] whom (by a publick Decree)\r\nthey declare to be greater and more Powerful than their King; and\r\nafterwards they harangue the King (who is elected upon certain Terms and\r\nConditions) in Words which (because of the remarkable Virtue and\r\nFortitude of that Nation in repressing the _unbridled Will_ of their\r\nPrince,) we will here set down at length.--\"Nos que valemos tanto come\r\nvos, ii podemos mas que vos; vos elegimos Reii con estas ii estas\r\nConditiones; intra vos ii nos un que manda mas que vos: That is, We, who\r\nare of as great Value as you, and can do more than you, do elect you to\r\nbe our King, upon such and such Conditions: Between you and us there is\r\n_one_ of _greater Authority_ than you.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing then that the Case is so, and that _this has always been a\r\nconstant and universal Law of all Nations, that are governed by a\r\nKingly, and not by a Tyrannical Power_: 'Tis very plain, that this most\r\nvaluable Liberty of holding a _Common-Council_ of the Nation, is not\r\nonly a Part of the _People's Right_; but that all Kings, who by Evil\r\nArts do oppress or take away this _Sacred Right_, ought to be esteemed\r\n_Violators of the Laws of Nations_; and being no better than _Enemies of\r\nHuman Society_, must be consider'd not as _Kings_, but as _Tyrants_.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Matter in Hand. Our Commonwealth being constituted\r\nby the Laws of our Ancestors, upon the Bottom above-mention'd, and\r\nparticipating of all the three Kinds of Government; it was ordain'd,\r\nthat once every Year (and as much oftner as important Occasions should\r\nmake it necessary) a _Solemn General Council_ shou'd be held: Which for\r\nthat Reason, was called a _Parliament_ of the _Three Estates_. By that\r\nWord was meant a Convention or Meeting of Men out of several Parts of\r\nthe Country to one Place, there to confer and deliberate concerning the\r\nPublick Welfare: And therefore all Conferences (tho' between Enemies) in\r\norder to a Peace or Truce are always in our Chronicles called by the\r\nName of _Parliaments_. Now of this Council, the _King_ sitting in his\r\nGolden Tribunnal, was _chief_; next to him were the _Princes_ and\r\n_Magistrates_ of the Kingdom; in the third Place were the\r\n_Representatives_ of the several Towns and Provinces, commonly called\r\nthe _Deputies_: For as soon as the Day prefix'd for this Assembly was\r\ncome, the _King_ was conducted to the Parliament House with a Sort of\r\nPomp and Ceremony, more _adapted to popular Moderation_, than to _Regal\r\nMagnificence_: which I shall not scruple to give a just account of out\r\nof our own Publick Records; it being a Sort of _Piety_ to be pleas'd\r\nwith the Wisdom of our Ancestors; tho' in these most profligate Times, I\r\ndoubt not but it wou'd appear ridiculous to our flattering Courtiers.\r\nThe King then was seated in a _Waggon_, and drawn by _Oxen_, which a\r\n_Waggoner_ drove with his _Goad_ to the Place of Assembly: But as soon\r\nas he was arrived at the Court, or rather indeed the Venerable _Palace\r\nof the Republick_, the Nobles conducted the King to the Golden Throne;\r\nand the rest took their Places (as we said before) according to their\r\nDegrees. This _State_, and in this _Place_, was what was called _Regia\r\nMajestas, Royal Majesty_. Of which we may even at this Day observe a\r\nsignal Remain in the King's Broad Seal, commonly called the _Chancery_\r\nSeal. Wherein the King is not represented in a _military Posture_ a\r\nHorse-back, or in a _Triumphant Manner_ drawn in his Chariot by Horses,\r\nbut sitting in his Throne _Robe'd_ and _Crown'd_, holding in his Right\r\nHand the Royal Sceptre, in his Left the Sceptre of Justice, and\r\npresiding in his _Solemn Council_. And indeed, in that Place only it can\r\nbe said that _Royal Majesty_ does truly and properly reside, where the\r\ngreat Affairs of the Commonwealth are transacted; and not as the\r\nunskilful Vulgar use to profane the Word; and whether the King plays or\r\ndances, or prattles with his Women, always to stile him YOUR MAJESTY.\r\n\r\nOf all these Matters, we shall give only a few Proofs, out of many which\r\nwe could produce. First, out of _Eginarthus_, who was _Chancellor_ to\r\n_Charles the Great_, and wrote his Life. These are his Words: \"Wherever\r\nhe went (speaking of _Charlemagn_) _about the publick Affairs_: he was\r\ndrawn in a Waggon by a Pair of Oxen, which an ordinary Waggoner drove\r\nafter his rustical Manner. Thus he went to the Courts of Justice, thus\r\nto the Place of the Publick Convention of his People, which every Year\r\nwas celebrated for the Good of the Realm; and thus he used to return\r\nHome again.\"\r\n\r\n_Joannes Nauclerus_ gives us an Account of the very same Thing, in\r\nalmost the same Words, in _Chron. Generat. 26_. So does the _Author_ of\r\nthe _Great Chronicle_, in the Beginning of his Life of _Charlemagn_,\r\nFol. 77. Neither ought this to seem so great a Wonder to any, who\r\nconsiders it was the Fashion in those Days for our Kings and Queens, and\r\nthe Royal Family, to be drawn by _Oxen_; of which we have one Instance\r\nin _Greg. Turon. lib. 3. cap. 26. \"Deuteria_, (says he) Wife of King\r\n_Childebert_, seeing her Daughter by a former Husband grown to Woman's\r\nEstate, and fearing lest the King (being in Love with her) should lye\r\nwith her, caused her to be put into a Sort of Litter with untamed Oxen,\r\nand thrown Headlong off a Bridge.\" _Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 30._ makes\r\nmention of the Golden Throne, where he speaks of King _Dagobert_: \"He\r\nproclaimed, says he, _Generale PLACITUM in loco nuncupato\r\nBigargio_, a _Great Council_ in a Place named _Bigargium_: To which all\r\nthe Great Men of _France_ assembling with great Diligence on the Kalends\r\nof _May_, the King thus began his Speech to them, sitting on his _Golden\r\nThrone_.\" Also in his 41st Chapter, speaking of King\r\n_Clodoveus_--Sitting in the midst of them, on his _Golden Throne_, he\r\nspoke in this Manner, &c. _Sigebertus in Chron. Anni 662._--\"'Tis the\r\nAncient Custom (says he) of the Kings of the _Franks_, every _Kalends of\r\nMay_, to preside in a Convention of all the People, to salute and be\r\nsaluted, to receive Homage, and give and take Presents.\" _Georgius\r\nCedrenus_ expresses this in almost the same Words: [Greek: katta de ton\r\nMaion mêna prokaithesesai epi pantos tou ethnous kai proskunin autois kai\r\nantiproskunisthai hup autô dôrophoreisthai te katta sunêpheian kai\r\nantididonai autois]\r\n\r\nNow, concerning the _Authority_ of the _People_, who were thus gather'd\r\ntogether at the _Great Council_, we have many Testimonies, _Aimoinus,\r\nlib. 4. cap. 41._ speaking of _Clodoveus_ the Second; \"Altho' (says that\r\nKing in his Speech) the Care of our Earthly Principality _obliges_ us to\r\ncall you together _Francigenæ cives_, and to consult you in Affairs\r\nrelating to the Publick, &c.\"--Also in his 74th Chapter of the same\r\nBook--\"In the Beginning of the Year he went into _Saxony_, and there he\r\nheld a _General Convention every Year_, as he used to do every Year in\r\n_France_ also.\"--Again, _lib._ 4. _cap._ 13. where he speaks of _Charles_\r\nthe Great--\"When the Hunting near _Aix la Chapelle_ was ended, as soon\r\nas he return'd, he held a _General Convention_ of his People, according\r\nto usual Custom, &c. _Cap._ 116. The Emperor having held Two\r\n_Conventions_, one at _Nimeguen_, the other at _Compiegn_, wherein he\r\nreceiv'd the Annual Presents, &c. Again, _Cap._ 117. In the Month of\r\n_August_ he came to _Wormes_, and holding there the General Convention\r\naccording to constant Practice, he received the Yearly Gifts which were\r\noffer'd him, and gave Audience to several Ambassadors, &c. Again, _Lib.\r\n5. cap. 31._ The General _Placitum_ was held on the Ides of _June_, in\r\nthe Town _Dusiacum_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this may suffice touching this solemn _General Council_, which both\r\n_French_ and _German_ Historians, thro' a deprav'd Custom of the _Latin_\r\nTongue, called by different Names; sometimes _Curia_, sometimes\r\n_Conventus Generalis_, but for the most Part _Placitum. Gregorius, lib.\r\n7 cap. 14_ says thus:--\"Therefore when the Time of the _Placitum_\r\napproached, they were directed by King _Childebert, &c. Aimoinus, lib.\r\n4. cap. 109._ In the middle of the Month he held the General Convention\r\nat _Thionville_, where there was a very great Appearance of the People\r\nof the _Franks_; and in this _Placitum_, the singular Compassion of the\r\nmost Pious Emperor eminently show'd it self, &c.\"\r\n\r\nNow it was the Custom in that _Council_ to send Presents from all Parts\r\nto the King; as may appear from many Places which might be quoted,\r\nwherein that _Council_ is called _Conventus Generalis. Aimoinus, lib. 4.\r\ncap. 64._ speaking of King _Pipin_--\"He compell'd them (says he) to\r\npromise they would obey all his Commands, and to send him every Year at\r\nthe Time of the _General Convention_, Three Hundred Horses, as a Gift\r\nand Token of Respect. _Item, cap. 85._ Not forgetting the Perfidy of the\r\n_Saxons_, he held the _General Convention_ beyond the _Rhine_, in the\r\nTown of _Kufftein_, according to the usual Custom.\"\r\n\r\nThis _Council_ was sometimes called by another Name, _Curia_, the\r\n_Court_; from whence proceeded the common Saying, when People went to\r\nthe _King's Hall_ or _Palace, we are going to Court_; because they\r\nseldom approach'd the King, but upon great Occasions, and when a\r\n_Council_ was call'd. _Aimoinus, lib. 5. cap. 50. \"Charles_, (says he)\r\nthe Son of the _Danish King_, sued (or prosecuted) several Noblemen of\r\n_Flanders_ very conveniently at this _Curia_, or _Court_. _Item, cap.\r\nsequenti_; _Henry_ King of the _Romans_ being dead, at that Great and\r\nGeneral _Court, Curia_, held at _Mentz. &c._ Also _Otto Frising._ _Lib.\r\nFrideric._ I. _cap._ 40. After these Things, the Prince enter'd\r\n_Bavaria_, and there celebrated a General _Curia, Court_, in the Month\r\nof _February_. _Item, cap._ 43. _Conrade_ King of the _Romans_, calling\r\nthe Princes together at _Francfort_, a City of _East France_, celebrated\r\nthere a _General Court_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n    _Of the_ Sacred Authority _of the_ Publick Council; _and\r\n    what Affairs were wont to be transacted therein_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think it necessary in this Place to consider what Kind of Affairs\r\nwere wont to be transacted in this general _Annual Council_, and to\r\nadmire the great _Wisdom_ of our Ancestors in _constituting our\r\nRepublick_. We have (in short) observed that they are these that follow.\r\nFirst, the _Creating or abdicating of their Kings_. Next, the _declaring\r\nof Peace or War_. The _making of all Publick Laws_: The _Conferring_ of\r\nall _great Honours, Commands_, or _Offices_ belonging to the\r\n_Commonwealth_: The _assigning_ of any _part_ of the _deceased King's\r\nPatrimony_ to his Children, or giving _Portions_ to his _Daughters_,\r\nwhich they usually called by a _German_ Name _Abannagium_; that is,\r\n_pars exclusoria_, a Part set out for younger Children. Lastly, all such\r\nMatters as in Popular Speech are commonly called _Affairs of State_:\r\nBecause it was not lawful to determine or debate of any Thing relating\r\nto the _Commonwealth_, but in the _General Council_ of the _States_.\r\n\r\nWe have already produced sufficient Proofs of the _Electing_ and\r\n_Abdicating_ their _Kings_, as well from the last _Will_ and _Testament_\r\nof _Charles_ the _Great_, as from several other Authors: To which we\r\nwill add this one Passage more out of _Aimoinus_, lib. 5. cap. 17. where\r\nspeaking of _Charles_ the _Bald_, he says thus,--\"Having summon'd a\r\n_General Council_ at [Footnote: _Crecy._] _Carisiacum_, he there first gave\r\nhis Son _Charles arma virilia_; that is, he girt him with a Sword, or\r\nknighted him, and putting a Regal Crown upon his Head, assign'd\r\n_Neustria_ to him, as he did _Aquitain_ to _Pippin_.\"\r\n\r\nNow concerning the _Administration_ of the _Kingdom_, _Aimoinus_ gives\r\nus this remarkable Instance, _lib._ 5. _cap._ 35. speaking of _Charles_\r\nthe _Bald_. \"_Charles_ (says he) being about taking a Journey to _Rome_,\r\nheld a general _Placitum_ on the Kalends of _June_ at _Compeign_; and\r\ntherein was ordained under particular Heads, after what Manner his Son\r\n_Lewis_ should govern the Kingdom of _France_, in _Conjunction_ with his\r\n_Nobles_, and the rest of the _Faithful People_ of the _Realm_, till\r\nsuch time as he returned from _Rome_.\"\r\n\r\nAlso in the same Book, _cap._ 42. speaking of _Charles_ the _Simple_:\r\n\"Whose Youth (says he) the principal Men of _France_ judging (as it was\r\nindeed) very unfit for the exercise of the Government of the Realm, they\r\nheld a _General Council_ touching these weighty Affairs; and the great\r\nMen of the _Franks_, _Burgundians_, and _Aquitanians_ being assembled,\r\nelected _Odo_ to be _Charles'_s _Tutor_ and _Governor_ of the Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nNow concerning _the Power_ of _making Laws_ and _Ordinances_, that\r\nsingle Passage in _Gaguinus'_s Life of St. _Lewis_ is a sufficient\r\nProof. \"As soon (says he) as King _Lewis_ arrived at _Paris_, he called\r\na _General Convention_, and _therein_ reformed the Commonwealth; making\r\nexcellent Statutes relating to the Judges, and against the Venality of\r\nOffices, &c.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the _conferring_ the _great Honours and Employments_ upon\r\n_Persons of approved Worth, Aimoinus lib. 5. cap. 36._ gives us this\r\nInstance; speaking of _Charles_ the _Bald_, he tells us, \"That whereas\r\nhe began (before his Inauguration) to distribute the Governments and\r\ngreat Offices of the Realm according to his own liking; the _Great Men\r\nsummoned a General Council_, and sent Ambassadors to the King; neither\r\nwould they admit him to be crowned till he had made use of their Advice\r\nand Authority in disposing of those great Employments. The Nobles (says\r\nhe) being very much displeas'd, because the King _conferr'd Honours\r\nwithout their Consent_; for that Reason, agreed together against him,\r\nand summoned a _general Convention_ in the Town of _Witmar_, from whence\r\nthey sent Ambassadors to _Lewis_, as _Lewis_ likewise sent his\r\nAmbassadors to them, &c.\"\r\n\r\nAlso the Appendix to _Gregory_ of _Tours, lib. 11. cap. 54._ \"That same\r\nYear (says he) King _Clotharius, cum Proceribus & Leudibus_, i. e. with\r\nthe Nobility and free Subjects of _Burgundy_, met at _Troyes_, and when\r\nhe earnestly solicited them to advance another Person to the same Place\r\nand Degree of Honour which _Warnhar_ (lately deceased) had enjoy'd, they\r\nunanimously refused to do it; and said, they would by no Means have any\r\n_Mayor of the Palace_, earnestly desiring the King to excuse them:\" And\r\nthus they gained their Point with the King.\r\n\r\nTo this Head may be referr'd all _the Contentions_ of such _Princes_, as\r\nwere foreseen might be _dangerous to the Commonwealth_. These were\r\ndebated in the _General Council_. For _Aimoinus_, lib. 4 cap. I. where\r\nhe speaks of _Clotharius_, Son of _Chilperic_, from whom Queen\r\n_Brunechild_ demanded the Kingdom of _Austratia_, says\r\nthus:--\"_Clotharius_ made answer, that she ought to call a _Convention_\r\nof the _Nobles_ of the _Franks_, and there debate (by common Consent) an\r\nAffair relating to the Community. That as for him, he would submit to\r\ntheir judgment in all Things, and would not obstruct in any Measure\r\nwhatever they should command.\" The same Thing is recorded in the\r\n_Appendix_ to _Gregory_ of _Tours_, lib. II. \"_Clotharius_ (says he) made\r\nAnswer to her, that he would refer the Difference between them, to the\r\nDetermination of the _Select Franks_, and promis'd to fulfil whatsoever\r\nthey should ordain.\" Also _Aimoinus_ lib. 5. cap. 12. where he speaks of\r\nKing _Lewis_ the _Pious_, who was grievously tormented with the\r\nContentions of his Sons, says thus,--\"When Autumn approached, they whose\r\nSentiments differ'd from the Emperor's, were for having the _General\r\nConvention_ held in some Town of _France_.--_Item_ cap. 13. He appointed\r\nthe _General Convention_ of his People to be held at _Thionville_. And\r\nafter a little Time, summon'd his People to meet on the Feast of St.\r\n_Martin_, and used all his Endeavours to recal his Son _Pipin_ who had\r\nabsented himself; but he refused to come, &c.\" _Gaguinus_ making Mention\r\nof this Same Passage, says; \"When the Conspirators found out they should\r\nnot be able to dethrone the King, without the Consent of the _Nobility\r\nin Convention_, they labour'd by all Means to have the _Great Council_\r\nheld within the Limits of _France_. But _Lewis_ knowing for certain that\r\nthose _Franks_ were gained by his Enemies against him, refused it, and\r\nsummon'd the Convention to meet at _Mentz_, and ordered that none should\r\nbe admitted _Armed_ to the Council. But his Sons, (who had conspired\r\nagainst their Father) lest they should want the _Authority_ of a\r\n_Publick Convention_, assembled a Council at _Compiegne_, consisting of\r\nthe Bishops and Nobility of the Kingdom. And _Lotharius_ taking his\r\nFather out of Custody, brought him to _Compiegne_.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, _Aimoinus_, lib. 5. cap. 38. where he speaks of Lewis _the\r\nStammerer_, who held a _Council_ at _Marsua_, wherein he treated a Peace\r\nwith his Cousin, says: \"In that _Placitum_, or _Parliament_, these\r\nArticles which follow were agreed upon between them, _by and with the\r\nConsent of the faithful Subjects of the Realm_.\"\r\n\r\nTo proceed, We find further, that it was the Custom (when any _Prince_,\r\nor _Person_ of _Extraordinary Quality_, was _accused of any Crime_) to\r\nsummon him to appear before the _Great Council_, and there he was to\r\nstand his _Trial_. Thus in the Reign of King _Clotharius_, when _Queen\r\nBrunechild_ stood accused, and was found guilty of many capital Crimes,\r\nthe King made a Speech to the Estates of the _Great Council of\r\nFrancogallia_, in these Words; which are recorded by _Aimoinus_, lib. 4.\r\ncap 1. \"It belongs to you, my most dear Fellow-Soldiers, and high\r\nNobility of _France_, to appoint what Kind of Punishment ought to be\r\ninflicted on a Person guilty of such enormous Crimes, &c.\" And _Ado Ætat\r\n6. sub Anno_ 583. tells us, \"The _Franks_ passing Sentence\r\nupon her in the King's Presence, condemn'd her to be torn in Pieces by\r\nwild Horses.\"\r\n\r\nNow concerning the _dividing_ of the _Royal Patrimon_, and the\r\n_Appanages_, we have the same Person's Testimony, _lib. 5. cap. 94._\r\nwhere speaking of _Charlemagn_, he has these Words--\"These Matters being\r\nended, the King held a _Convention_ of the _Nobility and Gentry_ of the\r\n_Franks_, for the making and maintaining a firm Peace among his Sons,\r\nand dividing the Kingdom into Three Parts, that every one of them might\r\nknow what Part of it he ought to defend and govern, in Case they\r\nsurvived him.\"--Also in that Place where he speaks of the Partition made\r\namong the Children of _Lewis_, lib. 5. cap. 40. he says thus.--\"They went\r\nto _Amiens_, and there they divided their Father's Kingdom among them,\r\n_according to the Advice and Direction of their faithful Subjects_.\"\r\nFurther, _cap._ 41. where he writes of _Carloman_, who held his _Great\r\nCouncil_ then at _Worms_.----\"To this _Placitum_ (says he) came _Hugo_,\r\nand preferred his Petition for that Part of the Kingdom, which his\r\nBrother _Lewis (in Locarium acceperat)_ had rented of him, or received\r\nin Pawn.\"\r\n\r\nWe may further observe, from very many Instances, that whenever the King\r\nhad any expensive Design in Hand, such as the Building of Churches or\r\nMonasteries, he took first the Advice of the _Council_ of the\r\n_Estates_. For _Aimoinus_, lib. 4. cap. 41. where he speaks of\r\n_Clodoveus_ the Second, tells us, that sitting on his Throne, he began\r\nhis Oration to the _General Council_ in these Words.--\"_Quamquam\r\nFranciginæ cives, &c._ Altho' (says he) the Care I ought to take of my\r\nKingdom, obliges me to take your Advice in all Matters relating to the\r\nPublick, &c.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus much may suffice on this Point. From all which we think it\r\nappears plainly, that the whole Power of the Administration of the\r\nKingdom was lodg'd in the _Publick Council_, which they called\r\n_Placitum_; because according to the Idiom of the _Latin_ Tongue, _that_\r\nis properly termed _Placitum_, which after having been proposed and\r\ndebated in a Council of many Persons, is at last agreed to, and resolved\r\nupon by them. And therefore _Cicero_, with others of the Ancients, were\r\nwont to call such-like Determinations, _Placita Philosophorum_.\r\n\r\nSince therefore the Matter is so, I hope the Opinion which we have\r\nformerly given in some of our other Books, will not be esteemed absurd;\r\n_viz._ That the common Form used by the King's Secretary in the last\r\nClause of our Ordinances and Edits, _Quia tale est PLACITUM nostrum_,\r\narises from hence: For anciently those Laws were written in the _Latin\r\nTongue_, (as is sufficiently proved by _Aimoinus_, the _Capitulary of\r\nCharles the Great_, and many other Records); but afterwards when the\r\nKing's Secretaries or Clerks began to make Use of the Vulgar Tongue,\r\nthro' Ignorance, or rather Malice, they translated it thus,--_Car tel\r\nest nostre Plaisir: For such is our Will and Pleasure_.\r\n\r\nNow as to the _Power_ of the _People_, we have this farther Argument\r\nextant in the same Capitulary of _Charles the Great_.--\"Let the _People_\r\n(says it) be consulted touching all the Heads of the new Laws, which are\r\nto be added to the former; and after they have _all given their\r\nConsents_, let them set their Hands and Seals to every Article.\"\r\n\r\nFrom which Words, 'tis apparent that the People of _France_ were wont to\r\nbe bound by such Laws _only_, as they had publickly agreed to in their\r\n_Parliaments_. Also _in fine Leg. Aleman._ we find this Passage.--\"This\r\nis decreed by the _King_ and his _Nobles_, and all the Christian\r\n_People_ which compose the Kingdom of the _Merovingians_.\" Also\r\n_Aimoinus_, lib. 5 cap. 38.--\"In this _Placitum_ the Laws which follow\r\nwere agreed upon, to be observed between them, by the _Consent_ of the\r\nfaithful _Subjects_.--An Agreement made between the Glorious Kings, &c.\r\nby the _Advice_ and _Consent_ of their faithful Commons, &c.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, we cannot omit observing, that so great was the _Reputation_ and\r\n_Authority_ of this _General Council_, even among _Strangers_, that\r\n_foreign Princes_ submitted to have their Controversies and Differences\r\ndecided by it. The _Appendix_ to _Greg. Turon._ lib. 11. cap. 37. _Anno_\r\n12. of _Theodorick_'s Reign, has this Passage in it.--\"When\r\n_Alsaciones_, [perhaps _Alsatia_] in which Country he had been brought\r\nup, and which was left him by his Father _Childebert_, fell nevertheless\r\nto _Theodebert_, according to the Custom in Use among the _Barbarians_;\r\nthe two Kings agreed that their Difference should be decided by the\r\njudgment of the _Franks_, (in _Salocissa castro_) in their Camp near the\r\nRiver _Sala_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Kingly Officers, commonly call'd_ Mayors of the\r\n    Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we treat farther of the _uninterrupted Authority_ of the _Publick\r\nCouncil_, we think it not improper to say somewhat of those Regal great\r\nOfficers, which, during the _Merovingian_ Race were called (_Majores\r\ndomus_) Masters, or _Mayors of the Palace_. These having for some Time\r\nencroach'd upon the Kingly Power, finding at last a fit Opportunity,\r\nseiz'd upon it entirely as their own. Their Dignity near the Persons of\r\nour Kings seems to have been much the same with that of _Præfecti\r\nPretorio_, or Generals of the Guards in the Time of the _Roman_\r\nEmperors, who were sometimes also titled _Aulæ Præfecti_. They were\r\nusually appointed in and by the same _Convention_ which chose the\r\n_Kings_, and were wont to be Chiefs or Heads of the _Publick Council_.\r\nAnd upon this Account we frequently meet with such-like Expressions as\r\nthese among our Historians.--\"They elected such and such a Man to the\r\nDignity of _Mayor of the Palace_. _Herchinold, Mayor of the Palace_,\r\nbeing dead, the _Franks_ conferr'd that Dignity upon _Ebroinus_, and\r\nappointed him to be _Mayor_ in the King's Court.\" Also--\"They chose\r\n_Hilderick_ for their _King_, and _Wolfold_ for _Mayor of the Palace_.\"\r\nWhich Quotations of ours might indeed have been made as properly in out\r\nforegoing Chapter, where we proved that the greater Employments were not\r\nusually given by the _Kings_, but appointed by the Yearly _General_\r\nCouncil, and conferred upon Men of the greatest Fidelity and Probity.\r\n\r\nBut in this Magistracy, the same Thing hapned, which _Plutarch_ tells us\r\n(in his Life of _Lysander_) came to pass when _Agesilaus_ was appointed\r\nby the _Lacedemonians_ to be _General_ of their Army, and _Lysander_ to\r\nbe Legate or Lieutenant-General: \"Even as in Stage-Plays, (says he) the\r\nActors who represent a Servant or Messenger, have better Parts, and are\r\nmore regarded than him that wears the Crown and Scepter, who scarce\r\nspeaks a Word in the whole Play: So the chief Authority and Command was\r\nlodg'd in _Lysander_, whilst with the _King_ remained only a naked and\r\nempty Title.\"--Just so it fell out in our _Francogallia_; Fair\r\nOpportunities of increasing the Power of these _Mayors_ of the Palace,\r\nbeing offer'd by the Sloth and Negligence of our _Kings_; among whom we\r\nmay reckon _Dagobert, Clodoveus, Clotharius, Childericus, Theodoricus_,\r\n&c. For the Author of the History of the _Franks_, often cited by\r\n_Venericus Vercellensis_, tho' without naming him, writes, That during\r\nthe Reign of _Clotharius_, Father of _Dagobert_, the Kingdom of the\r\n_Franks_ began to be administred and govern'd by some which were called\r\n_Provisores Regiæ_, or _Majores Domus_. The same says _Godf. Viterb.\r\nparte Chron._ 16. Whereupon, whilst those _Mayors_ of the _Palace_\r\nexecuted all the important Affairs of the Commonwealth, and commanded\r\nall the Armies in Time of War; and the Kings (spending their Days in\r\nSloth and Idleness) tarried at Home, content with the bare Title of a\r\nKing; Matters at last were brought to such a Pass, that during the Reign\r\nof _Childerick_ the 18th _King_, Pipin, _Mayor of the Palace_, (who in\r\nthe King's Name had waged great and long Wars, and had overcome and\r\nreduced the _Saxons_ to Terms of Submission) finding a fit Occasion to\r\nassume the Regal Title which was offer'd him, did not let it slip:\r\nEspecially seeing himself at the Head of a great and victorious Army,\r\nthat espoused his Interests. Of which we have the Testimony of many\r\nAuthors. First, _Otto Frisingius_, Chron. 5. cap. 12. and his\r\nTranscriber _Godf. Viterb._ Part. 16. who write thus.--\"The Kings of\r\n_France_, before the Time of _Pipin the Great_, (formerly _Mayor of the\r\nPalace_) were in a Manner but titular Princes, having very little to do\r\nwith the Government of the Realm.\" _Sigebertus_ says almost the same\r\nThing _sub Anno_ 662.--\"From this Time, (says he) the Kings of the\r\n_Franks_ degenerating from their ancient Wisdom and Fortitude, enjoy'd\r\nlittle more than the bare Name of King. They did indeed bear the Title\r\naccording to Custom, _as being of the ancient Regal Race_; but neither\r\nacted nor disposed of any Thing: The whole Administration and Power of\r\nthe Kingdom, was lodg'd in the Hands of the _Mayor of the Palace_.\"\r\n\r\nYet in Reading such-like Authorities, we ought to take this Observation\r\nalong with us. That since _Pipin_ and his Sons laboured (as 'tis\r\nprobable they did) under a great Load of Envy, for having violently\r\nwrested the Royal Dignity from King _Childerick_, they made it their\r\nBusiness to find out and employ _plausible ingenious Historians_, who\r\nmagnified the Cowardliness of _Childerick_ and his Predecessors,\r\nupbraiding them with Sloth and Idleness, beyond what they deserv'd. And\r\namong such as these, we may reckon _Eguinarthus_, Chancellor to\r\n_Charles_ the _Great_, and one that did him special Service of this\r\nNature; who in the Beginning of his Book writes thus.--\"The Family of\r\nthe _Merovingians_, out of which the _Franks_ used to _Elect_ their\r\nKings, is supposed to have lasted as long as to _Hilderic_; who by the\r\nAppointment of Pope _Stephen_, was deposed, shaven, and thrust into a\r\nMonastery. Now tho' it may be said to have ended in him, yet in Truth,\r\nfor a long Time before, it ceased to have any Value or Excellency,\r\nbearing the bare empty Title of King. For both the Riches and Power of\r\nthe Kingdom, were at the Disposition of the _Prefects of the Palace_,\r\ncommonly called _Majores Domus_; with whom was also lodg'd the Authority\r\nof the Empire: Neither was there any Thing left remaining to the King,\r\nbut only that contenting himself with the Title, he should sit on a\r\nThrone, wearing his Hair and Beard very long, and representing the\r\nPerson of a Ruler; sometimes giving the first and last Audience to\r\nAmbassadors from Foreign Parts, and returning such Answers as were made\r\nfor him, as if they proceeded immediately from himself. But besides the\r\nunprofitable Name of a King, and a precarious Allowance for his private\r\nExpences, (which the Mayor of the Palace was pleased out of Bounty to\r\ngive him) he had nothing that he could call his own, except one Village\r\nof very small Revenue, where he had a little House, and a few Servants,\r\nbarely sufficient for his necessary Occasions, &c.\"\r\n\r\n_Sigebertus, sub Anno 662._ taking _Eguinarthus_ for his Pattern,\r\ninveighs against the former Kings in almost the same contumelious Terms.\r\n\"Whose Custom (says he) it was, indeed, to make an Appearance like a\r\nPrince, according to what had been usual to their Family; but neither to\r\nact, nor dispose of any thing, only to tarry at Home, and to Eat and\r\nDrink like Irrational Creatures.\"--As if the like Sloth and Cowardise\r\nought to be imputed to all the former Kings, among whom we nevertheless\r\nfind many brave Men, such as _Clodoveus_, who not only defeated a great\r\nArmy of _Germans_, which had made an Irruption into _France_, in a great\r\nBattel near _Tolbiacum_; but also drove the Remainder of the _Romans_\r\nout of the Confines of _Gallia_. What shall we say of _Childebert_ and\r\n_Clotharius_, who rooted the _Visigoths_ and _Ostrogoths_ out of\r\n_Provence_ and _Aquitain_, where they had seated themselves? In the\r\nHistories of all which Princes, there is no Mention made of any _Mayor\r\nof the Palace_, but cursorily, and by the By, as one of the _King's\r\nServants_. This we may see in _Gregorius_, lib 5. cap. 18, where he\r\nspeaks of _Gucilius_, _Lib. 6. cap. 9._ and _cap. 45. Lib. 7. cap.\r\n49._ And we find this Employment to have been not only in the _King's_\r\nPalace, but also in the _Queen's_: For the same _Gregorius_, lib. 7.\r\ncap. 27. mentions one _Waddo_ as _Mayor_ of the _Palace_, in the Court\r\nof _Queen Riguntha_: And in very many other Places of their Histories,\r\nwe find both _Gregorius_ and _Aimoinus_ making Mention of these _Masters\r\nof the Court_ and _the King's House_.\r\n\r\nNow the first Beginning of the great Authority of these _Præfecti\r\nRegii_, was (as we told you before) during the Reign of King\r\n_Clotharius_ the Second, about the Year of our Lord 588. that is, about\r\n130 Years after the constituting the _Francogallican Kingdom_; which we\r\nmay also learn from the before-mention'd Historian, so often quoted by\r\n_Venericus_.\r\n\r\nYet there are two other Historians, (tho' not of equal Credit)\r\n_Sigibertus_ and _Trithemius_, who refer the Beginning of so great a\r\nPower in the _Mayor of the Palace_, to the Reign of _Clotair_ the Third;\r\nwhose _Magister Palatii_ was one _Ebroinus_, a Man of extraordinary\r\nWickedness and Cruelty: But however this may be, we find Historians\r\ncalling them by several other Appellations; such as _Comites Domus\r\nRegie, Præfecti Aulæ, Comites Palatii, &c._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n    _Whether_ Pipin _was created King by the_ Pope, _or by the\r\n    Authority of the_ Francogallican Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving in the former Chapter given an Account, that after the Expulsion\r\nof _Childerick_, (a stupid Prince, in whom the Line of the Merovingians\r\nended) _Pipin_, from being _Mayor of the Palace_, was created _King_; It\r\nwill be worth our Enquiry, to know by whose Authority the Kingdom was\r\nconferr'd upon him. For _Pope Gelasius_ says thus, _Cap. 75. Quest. 6._\r\n--\"_A Roman Pope_, viz. _Zacharias_, deposed the King of the _Franks_,\r\nnot so much because of his evil Actions, as because he was stupid, and\r\nunfit for the Exercise of so great a Trust; and in his Stead,\r\nsubstituted _Pipin_, Father of _Charles_ the Emperor: Absolving all the\r\n_Franks_ from the Oath of Allegiance to _Childeric_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is scarce an Author who does not acquiesce in this Testimony\r\nof one _Pope_, concerning the Power of another: Thus _Ado, Lambertus,\r\nRhegino, Sigibertus, Aimoinus, Landulphus_, nay, even _Venericus\r\nVercellensis_, (in the Book which we formerly quoted) cites these Words\r\nout of the Epistle of _Pope Gregory_ the VIIth. to _Herman_ Bishop or\r\n_Metz_; viz. \"A certain _Pope of Rome deposed_ the _King_ of the\r\n_Franks_ from his Kingdom, nor so much for his Wickedness, as his being\r\nunfit for so great a Power; and after having absolved all the _Franks_\r\nfrom the Oath of Fidelity they had sworn to him, placed _Pipin_ in his\r\nRoom.--Which _Otto Frisingius_, lib. Chron. 5. cap. 23. and _Godfrey_,\r\nChron. Part. 17. laying presently hold of, break out into this\r\nExclamation--From this Action, the Popes of _Rome_ derive an Authority\r\nof changing and deposing Princes, &c.\"\r\n\r\nBut pray let us enquire whether the Truth of this Story, as to the\r\nMatter of Fact, be sufficiently proved and attested. For in the first\r\nPlace, 'tis manifest, That _not one_ of all that _great Number of Kings_\r\nof the _Franks_, which we have instanced to have been Elected or\r\nAbdicated, was either created or abdicated by the Pope's Authority. On\r\nthe contrary we have irrefragably prov'd, that the whole Right, both of\r\n_making_ and _deposing_ their Kings, was lodg'd in the yearly _great\r\nCouncil_ of the Nation; so that it seems incredible the _Franks_ shou'd\r\nneglect or forgo their Right, in this single Instance of _Pipin_. But to\r\nmake few Words of this Matter, _Venericus Vercellensis_ gives us the\r\nTestimony of an ancient Historian, who has written of all the\r\n_Francogallican_ Affairs; whereby that whole Story of the _Pope_, is\r\nprov'd to be a Lye: And 'tis clearly demonstrated, that both\r\n_Childerick_ was deposed, and _Pipin_ chosen in his room, according to\r\nthe _usual_ Custom of the _Franks_, and the _Institutions_ of our\r\nAncestors: That is to say, by a _solemn General Council of the Nation_;\r\nin whose Power _only_ it was, to transact a Matter of so great Weight\r\nand Moment; as we have before made it appear. The Words of that\r\nHistorian are these:--\"That by the _Counsel_, and with the _Consent_ of\r\nall the _Franks_, (a Relation of this Affair being sent to the\r\nApostolick See, and its Advice had) the most noble _Pipin_ was advanced\r\nto the Throne of the Kingdom, _By the Election of the whole Nation_, the\r\nHomage of the Nobility, with the Consecration of the Bishops, &c.\" From\r\nwhich Words, 'tis most apparent that _Pipin_ was not appointed King by\r\nthe _Pope_, but by the _People themselves_, and the _States of the\r\nRealm_. And _Venericus_ explains this Matter out of the same Historian.\r\n\"_Pipin, Mayor_ of the Palace (says he) having all along had the\r\nAdministration of the Regal Power in his Hands, was the first that was\r\nappointed and elected to be King, from being _Mayor of the Palace_; the\r\n_Opinion_ of _Pope Zachary_ being first known, because the Consent and\r\n_Countenance_ of a Pope of _Rome_, was thought necessary in an Affair of\r\nthis Nature.\"--And presently after he tells us; \"The Pope finding that\r\nwhat the Ambassadors had deposed was just and profitable, agreed to it;\r\nand _Pipin_ was made King by the unanimous Suffrages and Votes of the\r\nNobility, &c.\"--To the very same Purpose writes _Ado of Vienna_, Ætat.\r\n6. _sub Anno 727._--\"Ambassadors (says he) were sent to Pope\r\n_Zacharias_, to propose this Question to him; Whether or no the Kings of\r\nthe _Franks_, who had scarce any _Power_ in their Hands, but contented\r\nthemselves with the bare _Title_, were fit to continue to be _Kings_?\"\r\nTo which _Zacharias_ return'd this Answer,--\"That he thought the _Person\r\nwho governed_ the Commonwealth, ought rather to have also the _Title_ of\r\nKing: Whereupon the _Franks_, after the Return of the Ambassadors, cast\r\nout _Childeric_, who then had the Title of King; and by the _Advice_ of\r\nthe _Ambassadors_, and of Pope _Zacharias, Elected Pipin_, and made him\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the above Proofs, we have _Aimoinus's_ Testimony to the same\r\nPurpose, _lib. 4. cap. 61._ where he concludes thus.--\"This Year _Pipin_\r\ngot the Appellation of King of the _Franks_, and according to their\r\nancient Customs was elevated to the Royal Throne in the City of\r\n_Soissons_, &c.\" Nay, even _Godfrey of Viterbo_ himself; _Chron. part.\r\n17. cap. 4._ \"_Pipin_ (says he) was made King by Pope _Zacharias_, (_ex\r\nelectione Francorum_) through the _Election_ of the _Franks_, _Hilderic_\r\ntheir slothful King being, by the _Franks_, thrust into a Monastery.\"\r\n\r\nIn like Manner _Sigebertus_, sub Anno 752.--The Authors of the\r\n_Miscellany History_, lib. 22.--_Otto Frising._ lib. 5. Cap. 21, 22,\r\n23. And the Author of the Book intituled _Fasciculus temporum_, do all\r\nclearly agree in the Account given of this Transaction. From which we\r\nmay easily gather, that altho' the _Franks_ did _consult_ the _Pope_\r\nbefore they created _Pipin_ King, yet it cannot therefore be any Ways\r\ninferr'd from thence, that he was made King by the _Pope's Authority_;\r\nfor 'tis one Thing to make a King, and another to give Advice touching\r\nthe making him: 'Tis one Thing to have a Right of Creation, and another\r\nthat of only giving Advice; nay; no Man has a Right of so much as giving\r\nAdvice in Matters of this Nature, but he whose Advice is first ask'd.\r\n\r\nLastly, no Man has more clearly explain'd this whole Matter than\r\n_Marsilius Patavinus_; who during the Reign of _Lewis_ of _Bavaria_,\r\nwrit a Book--_de translatione imperii_, in which, _Cap. 6._ he has these\r\nWords.--\"_Pipin_, a very valiant Man, and Son of _Charles Martel_, was\r\n(as we read) raised to the Dignity of being King of the _Franks_, by\r\n_pope Zacharias_. But _Aimoinus_ more truly informs us, in his History\r\nof the _franks_, that _Pipin_ was _legally elected_ King by the _Franks_\r\nthemselves, and by the Nobility of the Kingdom was placed in the Throne.\r\nAt the same Time _Childeric_, a dissolute Prince, who contenting himself\r\nwith the bare Title of a King, wasted both his Time and Body in\r\nWantonness, was by them shaven for a Monk: So that _Zacharias_ had no\r\nHand in the deposing him, but consented (as some say) to those that did.\r\nFor such deposing of a King for just Causes, and electing of another,\r\ndoes not belong to any Bishop or Ecclesiastick, nor to any College of\r\nClergymen; but to the _whole Body of citizens_ [ad universitatem civium]\r\ninhabiting that Region, and to the Nobles of it, or to the Majority of\r\nthem both.\" Therefore those Pretences of the _Popes_, to a Power of\r\n_creating_ or _abdicating_ Kings, are apparently false to every Body.\r\nBut besides this fabulous Device, which is a sufficient Instance of\r\ntheir Wickedness and Malice, I think it worth my while to add a\r\nremarkable Letter of Pope _Stephen_, adapted to the foregoing Fable; by\r\nwhich we may make a judgment of the Madness and folly of that old crafty\r\nKnave. This Letter is extant in _Rhegino_, a Benedictine Monk, and Abbot\r\nof _Prunay_, [Footnote: _Abbot Pruniacensis_] an irrefragable Testimony\r\nin an Affair of this Nature; 'tis in _Chron. anni_ 753.--\"_Stephen_ the\r\nBishop, Servant of the Servants of God, &c. As no Man ought to boast of\r\nhis Merits, so neither ought the wonderful Works of God which are\r\nwrought upon his Saints without their Desert, to be buried in Silence,\r\nbut published abroad as the Angel admonished _Tobias_. I being\r\nconstrained thro' the Oppression of the holy Church, by that most\r\nwicked, blasphemous, and not worthy to be named Wretch, _Aistolphus_, to\r\nfly for Refuge to that _excellent and faithful Votary of St._ Peter,\r\n_Lord_ Pipin, the most _Christian_ King, took my Journey into _France_;\r\nwhere I fell into a mortal Distemper and remained some Time in the\r\nDistrict of _Paris_, in the venerable Monastery of St. _Denis_ the\r\nMartyr. And being now past Hopes of Recovery, methought I was one Day at\r\nPrayers in the Church of the same blessed Martyr, in a Place under the\r\nBells: And that I saw standing before the great Altar our Master\r\n_Peter_; and that great Master of the _Gentiles_, our Master _Paul_;\r\nwhom I knew very well by their Vestments. And a little after, I saw the\r\nblessed _Lord Denis_, a tall and slender Man, standing at the Right Hand\r\nof our Lord _Peter_. And then that good Pastor the Lord _Peter_\r\nsaid--This good Brother of ours asks for Health. Then reply'd the\r\nblessed _Paul_--He shall be healed presently. And thereupon approaching\r\nto our Lord _Denis_, he amicably put his Hand upon his Breast, and\r\nlook'd back upon our Lord _Peter_, and Lord _Peter_ with a chearful\r\nCountenance said to our Lord _Denis_, His Health shall be your\r\nparticular Act of Favour. Then presently Lord _Denis_ taking a Censer\r\nfull of Incense, and holding a Branch of Palm-tree in his Hand,\r\naccompanied with a Presbyter and Deacon, who assisted him, came near to\r\nme, and said, Peace be with thee, Brother, be not afraid, thou shalt not\r\ndie until thou return in Prosperity to thy own See. Rise and be healed,\r\nand dedicate this Altar to the Honour of God, and the Apostles St.\r\n_Peter_ and St. _Paul_, whom thou seest standing before thee, with\r\nMasses of Thanksgiving. Whereupon I was presently made whole. And being\r\nabout to accomplish that which I was commanded to do, they that were\r\npresent said I was mad. So I related all that I had seen, to them, to\r\nthe King, and all his People, and how I had been cured; and I fulfilled\r\nall that I was bid to do. These Things happen'd in the 753d Year, from\r\nthe Incarnation of our Lord on the Ides of _August_; at which Time being\r\nstrengthned by the Power of _Christ_, between the Celebration of the\r\nConsecration of the above-mention'd Altar, and the Oblation of the\r\nSacrifice, I anointed King _Pipin_ and his two Sons, _Charles_ and\r\n_Carloman_, Kings of the _Franks_. Moreover, I laid Hands upon, and\r\nblessed _Bertranda_ the King's Wife, cloathed with her Royal Mantle, and\r\nthe Grace of the Sevenfold Holy Spirit: And the Nobles of the _Franks_\r\nbeing sanctified by the Apostolical Benediction, and the Authority\r\ndelivered by _Christ_ to St. _Peter_, obliged themselves solemnly, and\r\nprotested, That neither they, nor any of their Posterity, wou'd at any\r\nTime hereafter, presume to constitute any Person, as King over them, but\r\nonly such as were of the Race of King _Pipin_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n    _Of the_ Constable, _and_ Peers _of_ France.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the great Office of _Mayor_ of the _Palace_ before spoken of,\r\nthere was another which we must take Notice of; because it seems, in the\r\nMemory of our Forefathers, to have succeeded in Place of the former: And\r\nthat was the Office of _Count_ of the _King's Stable_; called at first,\r\n_Comes stabuli_; and by Corruption at last, _Connestabuli_. Now all\r\nthose who enjoy'd any extraordinary Honours or Employments in the King's\r\nCourt, and assisted in the Administration of the Commonwealth, were\r\ncommonly called _Comites, Counts_; which was likewise the Custom of the\r\nAncients, as I have in some other of my Works demonstrated. So _Cicero_,\r\nin many Places, calls _Callisthenes, Comitem Alexandri magni_. This\r\n_Comes stabuli_ was in a Manner the same with the _Magister Equitum_\r\namong the _Romans_, that is, _General_ of the _Horse_; to whom were\r\nsubject those Keepers of the Horses commonly called _Querries_. _Greg.\r\nTuren_ lib. 5. cap. 39. says,--\"The Treasurer of _Clodoveus_ being taken\r\nout of the City of _Bourges_, by _Cuppan_, _Count_ of the _Stable_, was\r\nsent in Bonds to the Queen, &c.\" And again, _cap._ 48. where he speaks\r\nof _Leudastes_,--\"She took him (says he) into Favour, rais'd him, and\r\nmade him Keeper of the best Horses; which so filled him with Pride and\r\nVanity, that he put in for the _Constableship_; [_Comitatum Stabuloram_]\r\nand having got it, began to despise and undervalue every Body.\" From\r\nthese Quotations it appears, that tho' the Custody of the Horses was a\r\nvery honourable Employment, yet 'twas much inferior to that of\r\n_Constable_. _Aimoinus_, lib. 3. cap. 43. gives the same Account of this\r\n_Leudastes_.--\"Being grown very intimate with the Queen, he was first\r\nmade Keeper of the Horse; and afterwards obtaining the Constableship\r\nabove the rest of the Keepers, he was (after the Queen's Death) made by\r\nKing _Charibert_, _Count_ of _Tours_.\" And _cap._ 70. \"_Leudegesilus_,\r\nPræfect of the King's Horses, whom they commonly call _Constable_,\r\nbeing made General of that Expedition by the King, order'd the Engines\r\nto be drawn down &c.\" Also _lib._ 4. _cap_, 95. where he speaks of\r\n_Charles_ the Great,--\"The same Year (says he) he sent _Burchard,\r\nComitem Stabuli sui_, which we corruptly call _Constabulum_, with a\r\nFleet against _Corsica_\"--. The Appendix to _Gregory_ calls him,\r\n_Comestabulum, lib._ II. _Brunechildis_ (says he) was brought out of the\r\nVillage, _ab exporre Comestabulo_.\r\n\r\nThis being so, _Albertus Krantzius_, lib. Suet. 5. cap. 41. ventures to\r\naffirm, that this _Constable_ was the same with what the _Germans_ call\r\n_Mareschal_. \"They named (says he) a _Governor_, one of the best\r\nSoldiers, who might have the Power of Convocating the _Assembly_ of the\r\nKingdom, and of acting in all Matters like the _Prince_. Our\r\n_Countrymen_ call him a _Mareschal_, the French call him _Constable_,\r\n&c.\" This seems the more probable, because I do not remember any Mention\r\nto have been made in ancient Times, of a _Mareschal_ in our\r\n_Francogallia_; so that 'tis very likely to have been an Institution of\r\nour latter Kings, accommodated to the Custom of the _Germans_.\r\n\r\nThat this _Comitatus Stabulorum_, a _Constableship_, had its Rise from\r\nthe Institution of the _Roman Emperors_, I do not at all question;\r\naltho' it grew by Degrees among us from slender Beginnings, to the\r\nHeighth of chief _Governor_ of the _Palace_. In former Times that\r\nDignity was a Sort of _Tribunatus Militaris. Ammianus_, lib. 26. has\r\nthis Expression where he speaks of _Valentinian_ the Emperor,--\"Having\r\nfixed his Stages, or Days Journeys, he at last entred into _Nicomedia_;\r\nand about the Kalends of _March_, appointed his Brother _Valens_ to be\r\nGovernor of his Stables, _cum tribunatus dignitate_, with _tribunitial\r\nDignity_.\" What Kind of Dignity that was, we may find in the Code of\r\n_Justinian_, lib. 1. Cod. _de comitibus & tribunis Schol._ Where 'tis\r\nreckoned as a great Honour for them to preside over the Emperor's\r\nBanquets, when they might adore his Purple. Also in _lib. 3. Cod.\r\nTheodos. de annon. & tribut, perpensa, 29. Cod. Theod. de equorum\r\nCollatione & lib. 1. Cod. Theod._ wherein we may find a Power allowed\r\nthem, of exacting Contribution to a certain Value from the Provincials\r\nwho were to furnish War-Horses for the Emperor's Service.\r\n\r\nIt now remains that we discourse a little of those Magistrates, which\r\nwere commonly called _Peers_ of _France_; whereof we can find no Records\r\nor Monuments, tho' our Endeavours have not been wanting. For among so\r\ngreat a Number of Books, as are called Chronicles and Annals of\r\n_Francogallia_, not one affords us any probable Account of this\r\nInstitution. For what _Gaguinus_, and _Paulus Æmilius_ (who was not so\r\nmuch an Historian of _French_ Affairs, as of the _Pope's_) and other\r\ncommon Writers do affirm, to wit, That those Magistrates were instituted\r\nby _Pipin_ or _Charlemagn_, appears plainly to be absurd; because not\r\none of all the _German_ Historians, who wrote during the Reigns of those\r\nKings, or for some Time after, makes the least Mention of those\r\nMagistrates. _Aimoinus_ himself who wrote a History of the Military\r\nAtchievements and Institutions of the _Franks_, down to the Reign of\r\n_Lewis the Pious_, and the _Appendix_, which reaches as far as the Time\r\nof _Lewis the Younger_, being the 37th King, speak not one Word of these\r\n_Peers_ in any Place of their Histories; so that till I am better\r\ninform'd, I must concur in Opinion with _Gervase_ of _Tilbury_, who (as\r\n_Gaguinus_ says in the Book which he wrote to the Emperor _Otho_ the\r\nIVth, _de otiis imperialibus_) affirms. That this Institution is first\r\nowing to King _Arthur_ of _Britain_, who ruled some time in Part of\r\n_France_.\r\n\r\nFor I suppose the Original of that Institution to be this; that as in\r\nthe _Feudal_ Law such are called, _Pares curie beneficiari_, i. e. _equal\r\nTenants by Homage of the Court_, or _Clientes [Greek: omotimoi],\r\nClients of like holding_, or _Convassilli, Fellow Vassals_, who\r\nhold their _Fiefs_ and _Benefices_ from one and the same _Lord_ and\r\n_Patron_; and upon that Account are bound to him in _Fealty_ and\r\nObedience: just so King _Arthur_ having acquired a new Principality,\r\nselected _twelve great Men_, to whom he distributed the several Parts\r\nand _Satrapies_ of his Kingdom, whole Assistance and Advice he made use\r\nof in the Administration of the Government. For I cannot approve of\r\ntheir Judgment, who write, that they were called _Peers_, because they\r\nwere _Pares Regi_, the _King's Equals_; since their Parity his no\r\nRelation to the _Regal Dignity_, but only to that Authority and Dignity\r\nthey had agreed should be common among them. Their Names were these, the\r\n_Dukes of Burgundy, Normandy_, and _Aquitain_; the _Counts_ of\r\n_Flanders, Tholouse_, and _Champagne_; the _Archbishops_ of _Rheims,\r\nLaon_, and _Langres_; the _Bishops_ of _Beauvais, Noyon_, and _Chalons_.\r\nAnd as the _Pares Curtis_, or _Curie_, in the _Feudal_ Law, can neither\r\nbe created, but by the Consent of the Fraternity; nor _abdicated_, but\r\nby Tryal before their Colleagues; nor _impeach'd_ before any other Court\r\nof Judicature; so these _Peers_ were not bound by any judgment or\r\nSentence, but that of the _Parliament_, that is, of this imaginary\r\nCouncil; nor could be _elected_ into the _Society_, or _ejected_ out of\r\nit, but by their _Fellows in Collegio_.\r\n\r\nNow altho' this Magistracy might owe its Original to a foreign Prince;\r\nyet when he was driven out, the succeeding Kings finding it accommodated\r\nto their own Ends and Conveniences, ('tis most probable) continued and\r\nmade use of it. The first mention I find made of these _Peers_, was at\r\nthe Inauguration of _Philip the Fair_, by whom also (as many affirm) the\r\nSix _Ecclestastical Peers_ were first created.\r\n\r\nBut _Budæus_, an extraordinary Learned Man, calls these _Peers_ by the\r\nName of _Patritians_; and is of Opinion that they were instituted by one\r\nof our Kings, who was at the same Time _Emperor_ of _Germany_; because,\r\n_Justinian_ says, those _Patres_ were chosen by the _Emperor_, _quasi\r\nReipub. patronos tutoresque_, as it were _Patrons_ and _Tutors_ of the\r\nCommonwealth. I do not reject this Opinion of that Learned Person; such\r\na Thing being very agreeable to the Dignity of these _Peers_. For in the\r\nTimes of the later _Roman Emperors_, we find the _Patritian_ Dignity not\r\nto have been very unlike that of the _Peers_; because (as _Suidas_\r\nassures us,) they were (partly) the _Fathers of the_ Republick, and were\r\nof _Council_ with the Emperor in all weighty Concerns, and made use of\r\nthe same Ensigns of Authority with the _Consuls_; and had greater Honour\r\nand Power than the _Præfectus Prætorio_, tho' less than the _Consul_;\r\nas we may learn _ex Justiniani Novellis_; from _Sidon. Apollin.\r\nClaudian_; and _Cassiadorus_ especially.\r\n\r\nBut when the _Empire_ was transferr'd to the _Germans_, we do not\r\nbelieve this Honour was in use among them. Neither is it likely, that\r\nnone of the _German_ Historians should have made the least Mention\r\nof it, if any _Patritians_ of that Kind had been instituted by a\r\n_German_ Emperor, who at the same Time was King of _Francogallia_.\r\n\r\nLastly, The same _Budæus_ tells us in that Place, tho' a little\r\ndoubtingly, that the like Dignity of _Peers_ had been made use of in\r\nother neighbouring Nations; and that in the _Royal Commentaries, Anno_\r\n1224, 'tis found written, that a certain Gentleman of _Flanders_, called\r\n_Joannes Nigellanus_, having, a Controversy there, appeal'd from the\r\n_Countess_ of _Flanders_ to the _Peers_ of _France_; having first taken\r\nhis Oath that he could not expect a fair and equal Tryal before the\r\n_Peers_ of _Flanders_. And when afterwards the Cause was by the\r\n_Countess_ revok'd to the judgment of the _Peers_ of _Flanders_, it was\r\nat Length for certain Reasons decreed, that the _Peers_ of _France_\r\nshould take Cognisance of it. What the Reasons were of transferring,\r\nthat Tryal, _Budæus_ does not tell us; which one versed in the _Feudal_\r\nLaws should never have omitted. But 'tis Time to return to our principal\r\nBusiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n    _Of the_ continued _Authority and Power of the_ Sacred\r\n    Council, _during the Reign of the_ Carlovingian _Family_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have, as we suppose, sufficiently explain'd what was the Form and\r\nConstitution of our Commonwealth, and how great the Authority of the\r\n_Publick Council_ was during the Reigns of the Kings of the\r\n_Merovingian_ Family. We must now proceed to give an Account of it under\r\nthe _Carlovingian_ Race. And as well all our _own_ as the _German_\r\nHistorians, give us Reason to believe that the very same _Power_ and\r\n_Authority_ of the _Orders_ or _States_ of the Kingdom, was kept entire.\r\nSo that the last Resort and Disposal of all Things, was not lodged in\r\n_Pipin_, _Charles_, or _Lewis_, but in the _Regal Majesty_. The true and\r\nproper Seat of which was (as is above demonstrated) in the _Annual\r\nGeneral Council_. Of this _Eguinarthus_ gives us an Account, in that\r\nlittle Book we have already so much commended. Where, speaking of what\r\nhappen'd after the Death of _Pipin_, he tells us, \"that the _Franks_\r\nhaving solemnly assembled their general Convention, did therein\r\nconstitute both _Pipin_'s Sons their Kings, upon this Condition, That\r\nthey should equally divide the whole Body of the Kingdom between them;\r\nand that _Charles_ should govern that Part of it which their Father\r\n_Pipin_ had possess'd, and _Carlomannus_ the other Part which their\r\nUncle _Carlomannus_ had enjoy'd, &c.\" From whence 'tis easily inferr'd,\r\nthat the _States_ of the Kingdom still retain'd in themselves the same\r\nPower, which they had always hitherto been in Possession of (during near\r\n300 Years) in the Reigns of the _Merovingian_ Kings. So that altho' the\r\ndeceased King left Sons behind him, yet there _came not_ to the Crown so\r\nmuch thro' any _Right of Succession_, as thro' the _Appointment_ and\r\n_Election_ of the _States_ of the _Realm_. Now that all the other\r\nweighty Affairs of the Nation used to be determined by the same _General\r\nCouncil_, _Aimoinus_ is our Witness, _lib._ 4. _cap._ 71. where he\r\nspeaks of the War with the _Saxons_. \"The King (says he) in the\r\nBeginning of the Spring went to _Nimeguen_; and because he was to hold a\r\nGeneral Convention of his People at a Place called _Paderburn_, he\r\nmarched from thence with a great Army into _Saxony_.\" And again, _cap._\r\n77.--\"Winter being over, he held a Publick Convention of his People in a\r\nTown called _Paderburn_, according to the _yearly Custom_.\" Also _cap._\r\n79.--\"And meeting with his Wife in the City of _Wormes_, he resolved to\r\nhold there the _General Council_ of his People.\" In all which Places he\r\nspeaks of that _Charles_, who thro' his warlike Atchievements had\r\nacquired the Dominion of almost all _Europe_, and by the universal\r\nConsent of Nations had obtained the Sirname of the _Great_: Yet for all\r\nthat it was not in his Power to deprive the _Franks_ of their _ancient\r\nRight and Liberty_. Nay, he never so much as endeavour'd to undertake\r\nthe least Matter of Moment without the _Advice_ and _Authority_ of his\r\n_People_ and _Nobles_. And there is no doubt of it, after _Charles_'s\r\nDeath, _Lewis_ his Son administred the Kingdom upon the same Terms and\r\nConditions. For the _Appendix_ to _Aimoinus_, lib. 5. cap. 10. tells us,\r\nthat when _Charles_ was dead, _Lewis_ the Emperor, thro' a certain Kind\r\nof Foreknowledge, summon'd the general Council of his People to meet at\r\n_Doue_, near the _Loire_. And again, _cap._ 38. where he makes Mention\r\nof the Articles of Peace, concluded between King _Lewis_ and his Cousin\r\n_Lewis_, \"--They summoned, says he, a PLACITUM, and in that PLACITUM, by\r\nthe Advice and Consent of their faithful Subjects, they agreed to\r\nobserve and keep the Articles which follow. In which _Placitum_ it was\r\nalso by common Consent found convenient, that both Kings should return\r\nwith a Guard [_redirent cum scarâ_] _&c._\" Also _cap._ 41. where he\r\nspeaks of _Carloman_ the Son of _Lewis the Stammerer_,--\"And so (says\r\nhe) he departed from the _Normans_, and returned to _Wormes_, where he\r\nwas on the Kalends of _November_ to _hold his Placitum_.\" Also in the\r\nfollowing Chapter, where he speaks of _Charles_ the Simple,--\"Whose\r\nYouth (says he) the great Men of _France_ thinking unfit for the\r\nAdministration of the Government, they held a _Council_ concerning the\r\nState of the Nation.\"\r\n\r\nBut it would be an infinite Labour, and indeed a superfluous one, to\r\nquote all the Instances which might be given of this Matter: From what\r\nwe have already produced, I think 'tis apparent to every man, that till\r\n_Charles_ the _Simple_'s Reign, that is, for more than 550 Years, the\r\nJudgment and Determination of all the weighty Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth, belonged to the _great Assembly_ of the _People_, or (as\r\nwe now call it) to the _Convention of the Estates_: And that this\r\nInstitution of our Ancestors was esteemed _sacred_ and _inviolable_\r\nduring so many Ages. So that I cannot forbear admiring the Confidence of\r\nsome Modern Authors, who have had the Face to publish in their Writings,\r\nThat King _Pipin_ was the first to whom the Institution of the _Publick\r\nCouncil_ is owing. Since _Eguinarthus_, _Charles_ the _Great_'s own\r\n_Chancellor_, has most clearly proved, that it was the constant Practice\r\nof the whole _Merovingian Line_, to hold every Year the _Publick\r\nConvention_ of the People on the _Kalends_ of _May_; and that the\r\n_Kings_ were carried to that Assembly in a Chariot or Waggon drawn by\r\nOxen.\r\n\r\nBut to come to a Matter of greater Consequence, wherein the Prudence and\r\nWisdom of our Ancestors does most clearly shew it self. Is it not\r\napparent how great and manifest a Distinction they made between the King\r\nand the Kingdom? For thus the Case stands. The _King_ is one principal\r\nSingle _Person_; but the _Kingdom_ is the whole Body of the _Citizens_\r\nand _Subjects_. \"And _Ulpian_ defines him to be a Traytor, who is\r\nstirred up with a Hostile Mind against the Commonwealth, or against the\r\nPrince.\" And in the _Saxon_ Laws, _Tit._ 3. 'tis Written, \"Whosoever\r\nshall contrive any Thing against the Kingdom, or the King of the\r\n_Franks_, shall lose his Head.\"--And again, \"The King has the same\r\nRelation to the Kingdom that a Father has to his Family; a Tutor to his\r\nPupil; a Guardian to his Ward; a Pilot to his Ship, or a General to his\r\nArmy.\"--As therefore a Pupil is not appointed for the Sake of his Tutor,\r\nnor a Ship for the Sake of the Pilot, nor an Army for the Sake of a\r\nGeneral, but on the contrary, all these are made such for the Sake of\r\nthose they have in Charge: Even so the _People_ is not designed for the\r\nSake of the _King_; but the King is sought out and instituted for the\r\nPeoples Sake. For a _People_ can subsist without a King, and be governed\r\nby its Nobility, or by it Self: But 'tis even impossible to conceive a\r\nThought of a _King_ without a _People_. Let us consider more Differences\r\nbetween them. A _King_ as well as any private Person is a Mortal Man. A\r\n_Kingdom_ is perpetual, and consider'd as immortal; as Civilians use to\r\nsay, when they speak of Corporations, and aggregate Bodies. A _King_ may\r\nbe a Fool or Madman, like our _Charles_ VI who gave away his Kingdom to\r\nthe _English_: Neither is there any Sort of Men more easily cast down\r\nfrom a Sound State of Mind, through the Blandishments of unlawful\r\nPleasures and Luxury. But a _Kingdom_ has within it self a perpetual and\r\nsure Principle of Safety in the Wisdom of its Senators, and of Persons\r\nwell skill'd in Affairs. A _King_ in one Battel, in one Day may be\r\novercome, or taken Prisoner and carried away Captive by the Enemy; as it\r\nhappen'd to St. _Lewis_, to King _John_, and to _Francis_ the First. But\r\na _Kingdom_ though it has lost its _King_, remains entire; and\r\nimmediately upon such a Misfortune a Convention is call'd, and proper\r\nRemedies are sought by the chief Men of the Nation against the present\r\nMischiefs; Which we know has been done upon like Accidents. A _King_,\r\neither through Infirmities of Age, of Levity of Mind, may not only be\r\nmissed by some covetous, rapacious or lustful Counsellor; may not only\r\nbe seduced and depraved by debauch'd Youths of Quality, or of equal Age\r\nwith himself; may be infatuated by a silly Wench, so far as to deliver\r\nand fling up the Reins of Government wholly into her Power. Few Persons,\r\nI suppose, are ignorant how many sad Examples we have of these\r\nMischiefs: But a _Kingdom_ is continually supplied with the Wisdom and\r\nAdvice of the grave Persons that are in it. _Solomon_, the wisest of\r\nMankind, was in his old Age seduced by Harlots; _Rehoboam_, by young\r\nMen; _Ninus_, by his own Mother _Semiramis_; _Ptolomæus_ sirnamed\r\n_Auletes_, by _Harpers_ and _Pipers_. Our Ancestors left to their Kings\r\nthe Choice of their own Privy-Counsellors, who might advice them in the\r\nManagement of their private Affairs; but such Senators as were to\r\nconsult in common, and take care of the publick Administration, and\r\ninstruct the King in the Government of his Kingdom, they reserved to the\r\nDesignation of the _Publick Convention_.\r\n\r\nIn the Year 1356: after King _John_ had been taken Prisoner by the\r\n_English_, and carried into _England_, a Publick Council of the Kingdom\r\nwas held at _Paris_. And when some of the King's Privy-Counsellors\r\nappeared at that Convention, they were commanded to leave the Assembly;\r\nand it was openly declared, that the Deputies of the Publick Council\r\nwou'd meet no more, if those Privy-Counsellors shou'd hereafter presume\r\nto approach that Sanctuary of the Kingdom. Which Instance is recorded in\r\nthe Great Chronicle writ in _French_, Vol. 2. _sub Rege Johanne_, fol.\r\n169. Neither has there ever yet been any Age wherein this plain\r\nDistinction between a _King_ and a _Kingdom_, has not been observed. The\r\n_King_ of the _Lacedemonians_ (as _Xenophon_ assures us) and the\r\n_Ephori_, renewed _every Month_ a mutual _Oath_ between each other; the\r\n_King_ swore that he wou'd govern according to the written Laws; and the\r\n_Ephori_ swore that they wou'd preserve the Royal Dignity, provided he\r\nkept his Oath. _Cicero_, in one of his Epistles to _Brutus_, writes:\r\n\"Thou knowest that I was always of Opinion, that our Commonwealth ought\r\nnot only to be deliver'd from a _King_, but even from _Kingship_, Scis\r\nmihi semper placuisse non _Rege_ folum, sed _Regno_ liberari\r\nrempublicam.\"--Also in his Third Book _de Legibus_--\"But because a Regal\r\nState in our Commonwealth, once indeed approved of, was abolish'd, not\r\nso much upon the Account of the Faults of a _Kingly_ Government, as of\r\nthe _Kings_ who governed; it may seem that only the Name of a _King_ was\r\nthen abolish'd, &c.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n    _Of the_ Capevingian _Race, and the Manner of its\r\n    obtaining the Kingdom of_ Francogallia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been already shewn, that the Kingdom of _Francogallia_ continued\r\nin Three Families only, during One Thousand Two Hundred Years. Whereof\r\nthe first was called the _Merovingian_ Family. The second, the\r\n_Carlovingian_, from the Names of their Founders or Beginners. For\r\naltho' (as we have often told you) the Succession to the Kingdom was not\r\nconferred as _Hereditary_ Right, but according to the Appointment of the\r\n_General Council_; yet the _Franks_ were so far willing to retain the\r\nCustom of their Progenitors the _Germans_, (who as _Tacitus_ tells us,\r\nchuse their _Kings_ for their _Nobility_, and their _Generals_ for their\r\n_Valour_) that for the most Part they elected such Kings as were of the\r\nBlood _Royal_, and had been educated in a Regal Manner, whether they\r\nwere the Children, or some other Degree of Kindred to the Royal Family.\r\n\r\nBut in the Year 987, after the Death of _Lewis_ the Fifth, who was the\r\n31st King of _Francogallia_, and the 12th of the _Carlovingian_ Line,\r\nthere hapned a Migration or Translation of the Royal Scepter, and a\r\nChange of the Kingdom. For when there remained no Person alive of the\r\nformer Family but _Charles Duke of Lorrain_, Uncle to the deceased King,\r\nto whom the Succession to the Kingdom, by ancient Custom seemed to be\r\ndue; there arose up one _Hugh Capet_, Nephew to _Hauvida_, Sister to the\r\nEmperor _Otho_ the First, and Son to _Hugh_ Earl of _Paris_; a Man of\r\ngreat Reputation for Valour, who alledged, that he being present upon\r\nthe Place, and having deserved extraordinary well of his Country, ought\r\nto be preferred to a Stranger, who was absent. For there having hapned\r\nsome Controversies between the _Empire of Germany_, and the Kingdom of\r\n_France_; _Charles_ upon Occasion had shewn himself partial for the\r\n_Empire_ against _France_, and upon that Score had lost the Affections\r\nof most of the _French_. Whereupon _Charles_ having raised an Army, made\r\nan Irruption into _France_, and took several Cities by Composition.\r\n_Capet_ relying on the Friendship and Favour of the _Francogallican_\r\nNobles, got together what Forces he cou'd, and went to meet him at\r\n_Laon_, a Town in the Borders of _Champagne_; and not long after a\r\nbloody Battel was fought between them, wherein _Capet_ was routed, and\r\nforced to fly into the innermost Parts of _France_; where he began again\r\nto raise Men in Order to renew the War. In the mean Time _Charles_\r\nhaving dismiss'd his Army, kept himself quiet in the Town of _Laon_ with\r\nhis Wife; but in the Year following he was on a sudden surrounded by\r\n_Capet_, who besieged the Town with a great Army.\r\n\r\nThere was in the Place one _Anselmus_, Bishop of the City. _Capet_ found\r\nMeans to corrupt this Man by great Gifts and Promises, and to induce him\r\nto betray both the Town and the King into his Hands; which was\r\naccordingly done. And thus having obtained both the City and the\r\nVictory, he sent _Charles_ and his Wife Prisoners to _Orleans_, where he\r\nset strict Guards over them. The King having been two Years in Prison,\r\nhad two Sons born to him there, _Lewis_ and _Charles_; but not long\r\nafter they all died. So that _Capet_ being now Master of the whole\r\nKingdom of _France_ without Dispute or Trouble, associated his Son\r\n_Robert_ with him in the Throne, and took care to get him declared his\r\nSuccessor. Thus the Dignity and Memory of the _Carlovingian_ Family came\r\nto an End, the 237th Year after the first Beginning of their Reign. And\r\nthis History is recorded by _Sigebert_ in _Chron._ Ann. 987. as well as\r\nthe _Appendix_, lib. 5. cap. 45.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit making Mention of the _cunning Device_ made use of by\r\n_Hugh Capet_, for establishing himself in his new Dominion: For whereas\r\nall the Magistracies and Honours of the Kingdom, such as _Dukedoms,\r\nEarldoms_, &c. had been hitherto from ancient Times conferr'd upon\r\nselect and deserving Persons in the General _Conventions_ of the\r\n_People_, and were held only during good _behaviour_; whereof (as the\r\nLawyers express it) they were but _Beneficiaries_; _Hugh Capet_, in\r\norder to secure to himself the Affections of the Great Men, was the\r\nfirst that made those _Honours perpetual_, which formerly were but\r\n_temporary_; and ordained, that such as obtained them shou'd have a\r\nhereditary Right in them, and might leave them to their Children and\r\nPosterity in like Manner as their other Estates. Of this, see\r\n_Franciscus Conanus_ the Civilian, _Comment. 2. Cap. 9._ By which\r\nnotorious fact, 'tis plain, that a great Branch of the _Publick\r\nCouncil's_ Authority was torn away; which however (to any Man who\r\nseriously considers the Circumstances of those Times) seems impossible\r\nto have been affected by him alone, without the Consent of that _Great\r\nCouncil_ it self.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\n    _Of the uninterrupted Authority of the_ Publick Council\r\n    _during the_ Capevingian _Race_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may learn, out of _Froissard, Monstrellet, Gaguinus, Commines,\r\nGillius_, and all the other Historians who have written concerning these\r\nTimes, that the Authority of the Publick Council was little or nothing\r\nless in the Time of the _Capevingian_ Family than it had been during the\r\ntwo former Races. But because it would be too troublesome, and almost an\r\ninfinite Labour to quote every Instance of this Nature, we shall only\r\nchose some few of the most remarkable Examples out of a vast Number\r\nwhich we might produce.\r\n\r\nAnd the first shall be, what hapned in the Year 1328. When _Charles_ the\r\n_Fair_ dying without Issue Male, and leaving a Posthumous Daughter\r\nbehind him; _Edward_ King of _England_, and Son to _Isabella_, Sister of\r\n_Charles_, claimed the Kingdom of _France_ as belonging to him of Right.\r\nNow there could be no Trial of greater Importance, nor more illustrious,\r\nbrought before the _Publick Council_, than a Controversy of this Kind.\r\nAnd because it was decided there, and both Kings did submit themselves\r\nto the Judgment and Determination of the Council, 'tis an irrefragable\r\nArgument, that the _Authority_ of the _Council_ was greater than that of\r\nboth Kings. This Fact is recorded not only by all our own Historians,\r\nbut by _Polydore Virgil_ an _English_ Writer, _Histor. lib_ 19.\r\nMoreover, that great Lawyer _Paponius_, _Arrestorum_, lib. 4. cap. I.\r\nhas left it on Record, (grounded, no doubt, upon sufficient\r\nAuthorities,) \"That both Kings were present at that _Council_, when the\r\nMatter was almost brought to an open Rupture; by the Advice of the\r\n_Nobles_, a _General Convention_ of the _People_ and _States_ was\r\nsummon'd: and the _Vote of the Majority_ was, that the Kinsman, by the\r\nFather's Side, ought to have the Preference; and that the Custody of the\r\nQueen, then great with Child, shou'd be given to _Valois_; to whom also\r\nthe Kingdom was _adjudged_ and _decreed_ in Case she brought forth a\r\nDaughter.\"--Which History _Froissard_, Vol. I. Cap. 22. _Paponius_\r\nArrest. lib. 4. cap. I. Art. 2. and _Gaguinus_ in _Philippo Valesio_,\r\nhave published.\r\n\r\nThe Year 1356, furnishes us with another Example; at which Time King\r\n_John_ was defeated by the _English_ at _Poictiers_; taken Prisoner, and\r\ncarried into _England_.--\"After so great a Calamity, the only Hopes left\r\nwere in the Authority of the _Great Council_; therefore immediately a\r\nParliament was summon'd to meet at _Paris_. And altho' King _John_'s\r\nThree Sons, _Charles_, _Lewis_ and _John_, were at Hand, the eldest of\r\nwhich was of competent Age to govern; yet other Men were chosen, to wit,\r\n_twelve approved Persons_ out of each _Order_ of the _States_, to whom\r\nthe Management of the Kingdom's Affairs was intrusted; and there it was\r\ndecreed, that an Embassy shou'd be sent into _England_ to treat of Peace\r\nwith the _English_.\" _Froissard_, Vol. I. cap. 170. _Joannes Buchettus_,\r\nlib. 4. fol. 118. _Nich. Gillius_ in Chron. _Regis Joannis_, are our\r\nAuthors.\r\n\r\nA third Instance we have _Anno_ 1375, when the last Will and Testament\r\nof _Charles_ the Fifth, Surnamed the _Wise_, was produced: By which Will\r\nhe had appointed his Wife's Brother, _Philip_ Duke of _Bourbon_, to be\r\nGuardian to his Sons, and _Lewis_ Duke of _Anjou_ his own Brother, to be\r\nAdministrator of the Kingdom till such Time as his Son _Charles_ shou'd\r\ncome of Age. But notwithstanding this, a _Great Council_ was held at\r\n_Paris_, wherein (after declaring the Testament to be void and null) it\r\nwas decreed, that the _Administration_ of the Kingdom shou'd be\r\ncommitted to _Lewis_, the Boy's Uncle: \"_But upon this Condition, that\r\nhe_ should be _ruled and governed_ in that _Administration, by the\r\nAdvice of certain Persons named and approv'd by the_ Council.\" The\r\nEducation and Tutelage of the Child was left to _Bourbon_; and at the\r\nsame Time a Law was made, that the Heir of the Kingdom shou'd be crown'd\r\nas soon as he shou'd be full 14 Years old, and receive the Homage and\r\nOath of Fidelity from his Subjects.--_Froissard_, Vol. 2. cap. 60.\r\n_Buchett_, lib. 4. fol. 124.

Cap.\r\n\r\nA 4th Example we have in the Year 1392; at which Time the same _Charles_\r\nthe Sixth was taken with a sudden Distraction or Madness, and was\r\nconvey'd first to _Mans_, and afterwards to _Paris_; and there a\r\n_General Council_ was held, wherein it was decreed by the _Authority of\r\nthe States_, that the _Administration_ of the _Kingdom_ shou'd be\r\ncommitted to the Dukes of _Aquitain_ and _Burgundy_.--_Froissard_, Vol.\r\n4. cap. 44. is our Author.\r\n\r\n5. Neither must we omit what _Paponius_ (Arrest. lib. 5. tit. 10. Art.\r\n4.) testifies to have been declared by the _Parliament_ at _Paris_,\r\nwithin the Compass of almost our own Memories, when _Francis_ the First\r\nhad a Mind to alienate Part of his Dominions; _viz._ \"That all\r\nAlienations of that Kind made by any of his Predecessors, were void and\r\nnull in themselves; upon this very Account, that they were done _without\r\nthe Authority of the Great Council_, and of _the Three Estates_,\" as he\r\ncalls them.\r\n\r\nA 6th Example we have in the Year 1426, when _Philip_ Duke of\r\n_Burgundy_, and _Hanfred_ [Dux _Glocestriæ_] were at mortal Enmity with\r\neach other, to the great Detriment of the Commonwealth and it was at\r\nlast agreed between them to determine their Quarrel by single Combat:\r\nFor in that Contention the _Great Council_ interposed its Authority, and\r\ndecreed that both shou'd lay down their Arms, and submit to have their\r\nControversies _judicially tryed_ before the _Council_, rather than\r\n_disputed_ with the _Sword_. Which History is related at large by\r\n_Paradinus_, in _Chron. Burgund. lib._ 3. _Anno_ 1426.\r\n\r\nA 7th Example happned in the Year 1484, when _Lewis the Eleventh_ dying,\r\nand leaving his Son _Charles_, a Boy of 13 Years old; a _Council_ was\r\nheld at _Tours_, wherein it was decreed, \"The Education of the Boy\r\nshou'd be committed to _Anne_ the King's Sister;\" but the Administration\r\nof the Kingdom shou'd be intrusted to certain Persons _Elected and\r\napproved by that Council_; notwithstanding _Lewis_, Duke of _Orleans_,\r\nthe next Kinsman by the Father's Side, demanded it as his Right. A\r\nTestimony of which Transaction is extant in the Acts of that _Council_,\r\nprinted at _Paris_; and in _Joannes Buchettus_ 4th Book, folio 167.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Remarkable Authority of the_ Council _against_\r\n    Lewis _the_ Eleventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Power_ and _Authority_ of the _Council_ and the _Estates_\r\nassembled, appears by the foregoing Testimonies to have been very great,\r\nand indeed (as it were) _Sacred_. But because we are now giving Examples\r\nof this Power, we will not omit a signal Instance of the _Authority_ of\r\nthis _Council_, which interposed it self in the Memory of our Fathers\r\nagainst _Lewis the Eleventh_, who was reputed more crafty and cunning\r\nthan any of the Kings that had ever been before him.\r\n\r\nIn the Year 1460, when this _Lewis_ governed the Kingdom in such a\r\nManner, that in many Cases the Duty of a good Prince, and a Lover of his\r\nCountry, was wanting; the People began to desire the Assistance and\r\n_Authority_ of the Great _Council_, that some Care might therein be\r\ntaken of the Publick Welfare; and because it was suspected the King\r\nwou'd not submit himself to it, the _Great Men_ of the Kingdom (stirred\r\nup by the daily Complaints and Solicitations of the _Commons_,)\r\n\"resolv'd to gather Forces, and raise an _Army_; that (as _Philip de\r\nComines_ expresses it) they might provide for the _Publick Good_, and\r\nexpose the King's wicked Administration of the Commonwealth.\" They\r\ntherefore agreed to be ready prepared with a good Army, that in Case the\r\nKing should prove refractory, and refuse to follow good Advice, they\r\nmight _compel him by Force_: For which Reason that War was said to have\r\nbeen undertaken for the Publick Good, and was commonly called the War\r\n_du bien public_. \"_Comines_, _Gillius_, and _Lamarc_, have recorded the\r\nNames of those Great Men who were the principal Leaders, the _Duke of\r\nBourbon_, the _Duke of Berry_, the King's Brother; the _Counts of\r\nDunois_, _Nevers_, _Armagnac_, and _Albret_, and the _Duke_ of\r\n_Charalois_, who was the Person most concern'd in what related to the\r\nGovernment. Whereever they marched, they caused it to be proclaimed,\r\nthat their Undertakings were only design'd for the _Publick_ Good; they\r\npublished Freedom from Taxes and Tributes, and sent Ambassadors with\r\nLetters to the _Parliament_ at _Paris_, to the Ecclesiasticks, and to\r\nthe Rector of the University, desiring them not to suspect or imagine\r\nthese Forces were rais'd for the King's Destruction, but only to reclaim\r\nhim, and make him perform the _Office_ of a _Good King_, as the present\r\nNecessities of the _Publick_ required.\"--These are _Gillius_'s Words,\r\nlib. 4. fol. 152.\r\n\r\nThe Annals intituled the Chronicles of _Lewis the Eleventh_, printed at\r\n_Paris_ by _Galliottus_ fol. 27. have these Words.----\"The first and\r\nchiefest of their Demands was, That a _Convention_ of the _Three\r\nStates_ should be held; _because in all Ages it had been found to be the\r\nonly proper Remedy for all Evils, and to have always had a Force\r\nsufficient to heal such sort of Mischiefs_.\"--Again, Pag. 28. \"An\r\nAssembly was called on Purpose to hear the Ambassadors of the Great Men,\r\nand met on the 24th Day in the Town-House at _Paris_; at which were\r\npresent some Chosen Men of the University, of the Parliament, and of the\r\nMagistrates. The Answer given the Ambassadors, was, That _what they\r\ndemanded was most just_; and accordingly a _Council_ of the _Three\r\nEstates_ was summon'd.\"--These are the Words of that Historian.--From\r\nwhence the Old Saying of _Marcus Antoninus_ appears to be most\r\ntrue.--\"Etsi omnes molestæ semper seditiones sunt, justas tamen esse\r\nnonnullas, & prope necessarias: eas vero justissimas maximéque\r\nnecessarias videri, cum populus Tyranni sævitiâ oppressus auxilium à\r\nlegitimo Civium conventu implorat. Altho' all Sorts of Seditions are\r\ntroublesome, yet some of them are just, and in a Manner necessary; but\r\nthose are extraordinary just and necessary, which are occasion'd when\r\nthe People oppress'd by the Cruelty of a Tyrant, implores the Assistance\r\nof a Lawful Convention.\"\r\n\r\n_Gaguinus_, in his Life of _Lewis_ the _Eleventh_, pag. 265. gives us\r\n_Charles_, the Duke of _Burgundy's_ Answer to that King's Ambassadors.\r\n\"_Charles_ (says he) heard the Ambassadors patiently, but made Answer,\r\nThat he knew no Method so proper to restore a firm Peace, at a Time when\r\nsuch great Animosities, and so many Disorders of the War were to be\r\ncomposed, as a _Convention of the Three Estates_. Which when the\r\nAmbassadors had by Special Messengers communicated to King _Lewis_, he\r\nhoping to gain his Point by Delays, summon'd the _Great Council_ to meet\r\nat _Tours_, on the Kalends of _April_ 1467; and at the appointed Time\r\nfor the _Convention_, they came from all Parts of the Kingdom, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Passage, and in almost the same Words, is recorded in the Book\r\nof Annals, _fol. 64._ and in the Great Chronicle, _Vol. 4. fol. 242._\r\nwhere these very remarkable Words are further added.--\"In that Council\r\nit was appointed, that certain approved Men shou'd be chosen out of each\r\nof the _Estates_, who shou'd establish the Commonwealth, and take care\r\nthat Right and Justice shou'd be done.\" But _Gillius_ in the Place\r\nabove-mention'd says: \"After the Battel at _Montlebery_, many\r\nwell-affected and prudent Men were elected to be _Guardians_ of the\r\n_Publick Good_, according as it had been _agreed_ upon between the\r\n_King_ and the _Nobles_; among whom the Count of _Dunois_ was the\r\nPrincipal, as having been the chief Promoter of that Rising.\"--For it\r\nhad grown into Custom after the Wealth of the _Ecclesiasticks_ was\r\n_excessively_ increas'd, to divide the People into Three _Orders_ or\r\n_Classes_, whereof the _Ecclesiasticks_ made one; and when those\r\n_Curators_ of the _Commonwealth_ were chosen, Twelve Persons were taken\r\nout of each Order. So that it was enacted in that _Council_, that 36\r\nGuardians of the Republick shou'd be created, with Power, by common\r\nConsent, to redress all the Abuses of the Publick. Concerning which\r\nThing, _Monstrellettus_, Vol. 4. fol. 150 writes thus: \"In the first\r\nPlace (says he) it was decreed, that for the re-establishing the State\r\nof the Commonwealth, and the easing the People of the Burthen of their\r\nTaxes, and to compensate their Losses, 36 Men shou'd be elected, who\r\nshou'd have _Regal Authority_; viz. 12 out of the _Clergy_, 12 out of\r\nthe _Knights_, and 12 _skilful_ in the Laws of the Land; to whom Power\r\nshould be given of inspecting and enquiring into the Grievances and\r\nMischiefs under which the Kingdom laboured, and to apply Remedies to\r\nall: And the King gave his Promise _in Verbo Regis_, That whatsoever\r\nthose 36 Men shou'd appoint to be done, he wou'd ratify and confirm.\"\r\n\r\n_Oliver de la Marck_, a _Flemming_, in his History, _cap. 35._ writes\r\nthe same Thing, and mentions the same Number of 36 _Guardians_ or\r\n_Curators_ of the _Commonwealth_. And he farther adds; \"That because the\r\nKing did not stand to his Promise, but _violated_ his _Faith_, and the\r\n_Solemn Oath_ which he had publickly sworn, a most _cruel War_ was\r\nkindled in _Francogallia_, which set it all in a Flame, and continued\r\nnear 13 Years. Thus that King's Perjury was punish'd both by his own\r\nInfamy, and the People's Destruction.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the whole Matter 'tis plain, that 'tis not yet a hundred Years\r\ncompleat, since the Liberties of _Francogallia_, and the _Authority_ of\r\nits _annual General Council_, flourished in full Vigor, and exerted\r\nthemselves against a King of ripe Years, and great Understanding; for he\r\nwas above 40 Years old, and of such great Parts, as none of our Kings\r\nhave equall'd him. So that we may easily perceive that our\r\n_Commonwealth_, which at first was _founded_ and _establish'd_ upon the\r\n_Principles of Liberty_, maintained it self in the same free and sacred\r\nState, (even by Force and Arms) against all the Power of Tyrants for\r\nmore then Eleven Hundred Years.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit the great Commendation which that most noble Gentleman and\r\naccomplish'd Historian, _Philip de Comines_, gives of this Transaction;\r\nwho in his 5th Book and 18th Chapter, gives this Account of it, which we\r\nwill transcribe Word for Word.--\"But to proceed: Is there in all the\r\nWorld any King or Prince, who has a Right of imposing a Tax upon his\r\nPeople (tho' it were but to the Value of one Farthing) without their own\r\nWill and Consent? Unless he will make use of Violence, and a Tyrannical\r\nPower, he cannot. But some will say there may happen an Exigence, when\r\nthe Great _Council of the People_ cannot be waited for, the Business\r\nadmitting of no Delay. I am sure, in the Undertaking of a War, there is\r\nno need of such hast; one has sufficient Leisure to think leisurely of\r\nthat Matter. And this I dare affirm, that when Kings and Princes\r\nundertake a War with the Consent of their Subjects, they are both much\r\nmore powerful, and more formidable to their Enemies.--It becomes a King\r\nof _France_ least of any King in the World, to make use of such\r\nexpressions as this.--_I have a Power of raising as great Taxes as I\r\nplease on my Subjects_;--for neither he, nor any other, has such a\r\nPower; and those Courtiers who use such Expressions, do their King no\r\nHonour, nor increase his Reputation with Foreign Nations; but on the\r\ncontrary, create a Fear and Dread of him among all his Neighbours, who\r\nwill not upon any Terms subject themselves to such a Sort of Government.\r\nBut if our King, of such as have a Mind to magnify his Power; wou'd say\r\nthus; I have such obedient and loving Subjects, that they will deny me\r\nnothing in Reason; or, there is no Prince that has a People more willing\r\nto forget the Hardships they undergo; this indeed wou'd be a Speech that\r\nwou'd do him Honour, and give him Reputation. But such Words as these do\r\nnot become a King; _I tax as much as I have a mind to; and I have a\r\nPower of taking it, which I intend to keep_. _Charles_ the Fifth never\r\nused such Expressions, neither indeed did I ever hear any of our Kings\r\nspeak such a Word; but only some of their Ministers and Companions, who\r\nthought thereby they did their Masters Service: But, in my Opinion, they\r\ndid them a great deal of Injury, and spoke those Words purely out of\r\nFlattery, not considering what they said. And as a further Argument of\r\nthe gentle Disposition of the _French_, let us but consider that\r\n_Convention_ of the _Three Estates_ held at _Tours_, Anno 1484, after\r\nthe Decease of our King _Lewis_ the _Eleventh_: About that time the\r\nwholsome Institution of the _Convention_ of the _Three Estates_ began to\r\nbe thought a dangerous Thing; and there were some inconsiderable Fellows\r\nwho said then, and often since, that it was High-Treason to make so much\r\nas mention of Convocating the _States_, because it tended to lessen and\r\ndiminish the King's Authority; but it was they themselves who were\r\n_guilty of High-Treason against God, the King, and the Commonwealth_.\r\nNeither do such-like Sayings turn to the Benefit of any Persons, but\r\nsuch as have got great Honours or Employments without any Merit of their\r\nown; and have learnt how to flatter and sooth, and talk impertinently;\r\nand who fear all great Assemblies, lest there they shou'd appear in\r\ntheir proper Colours, and have all evil Actions condemned.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Authority, of the Assembly of the States\r\n    concerning the most important Affairs of Religion._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto demonstrated, that the Assembly of the States had a\r\nvery great Power in all Matters of Importance relating to our Kingdom of\r\n_France_. Let us now consider, what its Authority has been, in Things\r\nthat concern Religion. Of this our Annals will inform us under the Year\r\nMCCC. when Pope _Boniface_ the Eighth sent Ambassadors to King _Philip\r\nthe Fair_, demanding of him, whether he did not hold and repute himself\r\nto be subject to the Pope in all Things temporal as well as spiritual;\r\nand whether the Pope was not Lord over all the Kingdoms and States of\r\n_Christendom_? In Consequence of these Principles, he required of\r\n_Philip_ to acknowledge him for his Sovereign Lord and Prince, and to\r\nconfess that he held his Kingdom of _France_ from the Pope's Liberality;\r\nor that if he refused to do this, he should be forthwith excommunicated,\r\nand declar'd a Heretick. After the King had given Audience to these\r\nAmbassadors, he summon'd the States to meet at _Paris_, and in that\r\nAssembly the Pope's Letters were read, to the Purport following.\r\n_Boniface, universal Bishop, the Servant of the Servants of God, to_\r\nPhilip _King of_ France. _Fear God and keep his Commandments. It is our\r\nPleasure thou shouldst know, that thou art our Subject, as well in\r\nthings temporal as Spiritual, and that it belongs not to thee to bestow\r\nPrebends or collate Benefices, in any Manner whatever. If thou hast the\r\nCustody of any such that may be now vacant, thou must reserve the\r\nProfits of them for the Use of such as shall succeed therein: and if\r\nthou hast already collated any of them, we decree by these Presents such\r\nCollation to be_ ipso facto _void, and do revoke whatever may have been\r\ntransacted relating thereunto; esteeming all those to be Fools and\r\nMadmen, who believe the contrary. From our Palace of the_ Lateran _in\r\nthe Month of December, and in the Sixth Year of our Pontificate_. These\r\nLetters being read, and the Deputies of the States having severally\r\ndeliver'd their Opinions about them, after the Affair was maturely\r\ndeliberated, it was ordain'd; first, that the Pope's Letters should be\r\nburnt in the Presence of his Ambassador, in the great Yard of the\r\nPalace: Then, that these Ambassadors with Mitres upon their Heads, and\r\ntheir Faces bedaub'd with Dirt, should be drawn in a Tumbrel by the\r\ncommon Hangman into the said Yard, and there be exposed to the Mockery\r\nand Maledictions of the People: finally, that Letters in the King's Name\r\nshould be dispatched to the Pope, according to the Tenor following.\r\nPhilip _by the Grace of God, King of_ France, _to_ Boniface, _who stiles\r\nhimself universal Bishop, little or no greeting. Be it known to thy\r\ngreat Folly and extravagant Temerity, that in things temporal we have no\r\nSuperior but God; and that the Disposal of the Vacancies of certain\r\nChurches and Prebends belong to us of Regal Right; that it is our due to\r\nreceive the profits of them, and our Intention to defend our selves by\r\nthe Edge of the Sword, against all such, as would any way go about to\r\ndisturb us in the Possession of the same; esteeming those to be Fools\r\nand Brainless, who think otherwise_. For Witnesses of this History, we\r\nhave the Author of the _Chronicle of Bretayne_, lib. 4. chap. 14. and\r\n_Nicholas Gilles_ in the _Annals of France_, to whom ought to be join'd\r\n_Papon._ in the first Book of his Arrests tit. 5. art. 27.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\n    _Whether_ Women _are not as much debarr'd_ (_by the_\r\n    Francogallican Law) _from the_ Administration, _as from\r\n    the_ Inheritance _of the Kingdom_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Dispute being about the _Government_ of the Kingdom, and the\r\nchief _Administration_ of Publick Affairs, we have thought fit not to\r\nomit this Question: Whether _Women_ are not as much debarr'd from the\r\n_Administration_, as from the _Inheritance_ of the Kingdom? And in the\r\nfirst Place we openly declare, that 'tis none of our Intention to argue\r\nfor or against the _Roman_ Customs or Laws, or those of any other\r\nNation, but only of the Institutions of this our own _Francogallia_. For\r\nas on the one Hand 'tis notorious to all the World, that by the _Roman_\r\nInstitutions, _Women_ were always under _Guardianship_, and excluded\r\nfrom intermeddling, either in publick or private Affairs, by Reason of\r\nthe _Weakness_ of their Judgment: So on the other, _Women_ (by ancient\r\nCustom) obtain the _Supreme Command_ in _Some_ Countries. \"The\r\n(_Britains_ says _Tacitus_ in his Life of _Agricola_) make _no\r\nDistinction of Sexes_ in _Government_.\" Thus much being premised, and\r\nour Protestation being clearly and plainly proposed, we will now return\r\nto the Question. And as the Examples of some former Times seem to make\r\nfor the affirmative, wherein the Kingdom of _Francogallia_ has been\r\nadministered by _Queens_, especially by _Widows_ and _Queen-Mothers_: So\r\non the contrary, the Reason of the Argument used in Disputations, is\r\nclearly against it. For she, who cannot be Queen in her _own Right_, can\r\nnever have any Power of Governing in another's Right: But here a Woman\r\ncannot reign in her own Right, nor can the Inheritance of the Crown fall\r\nto her, or any of her Descendants; and if they be stiled _Queens_ 'tis\r\nonly accidentally; as they are _Wives_ to the _Kings_ their _Husbands_.\r\nWhich we have prov'd out of Records for twelve hundred Years together.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added (which we have likewise prov'd) that nor only the\r\nsole Power of _Creating_ and _Abdicating_ their Kings, but also the\r\nRight of electing _Guardians_ and _Administrators_ of the Commonwealth,\r\nwas lodged in the same _Publick Council_. Nay, and after the Kings were\r\ncreated, the supreme Power of the Administration was retained still by\r\nthe same _Council_. And 'tis not yet full a hundred Years since 36\r\nGuardians of the Commonwealth were constituted by the same _Council_,\r\nlike so many _Ephori_: and this during the Reign of _Lewis_ the\r\n_Eleventh_, as crafty and cunning as he was. If we seek for Authorities\r\nand Examples from our Ancestors, we may find several; there is a\r\nremarkable one in _Aimoinus_, lib. 4. cap. 1. where speaking of Queen\r\n_Brunechild_, Mother to young _Childebert_; \"The Nobility of _France_\r\n(says he) understanding that _Brunechild_ designed to keep the chief\r\nManagement of the Kingdom in her own Hands; and having always hitherto,\r\nfor so long a Time disdained to be subject to a Female Domination, did,\r\n&c.\" And indeed it has so happned in the Days of our Ancestors, that\r\nwhenever Women got into their Hands the Procuration of the Kingdom, they\r\nhave been always the Occasion of wonderful Tragedies: Of which it will\r\nnot be amiss to give some Examples. Queen _Crotildis_, Mother of the two\r\nKings, _Childebert_ and _Clotarius_, got once the Power into her Hands;\r\nand being extravagantly fond of the Sons of _Clodomer_, (another of her\r\nSons then dead) occasion'd a great deal of Contention, by her\r\nendeavouring to exclude her Sons, and promote these Grandsons to the\r\nRegal Dignity; and upon that Score she nourished their _large Heads of\r\nHair_ with the greatest Care and Diligence imaginable, according to that\r\nancient Custom of the Kings of the _Franks_, which we have before given\r\nan Account of. The two Kings (as soon as they understood it) presently\r\nsent one _Archadius_, who presenting her with a naked Sword and a Pair\r\nof Shears, gave her Choice which of the two She had rather shou'd be\r\napplied to the Boys Heads. But She (says _Gregory_ of _Tours_) being\r\nenraged with Choler, especially when She beheld the naked Sword and the\r\nScissars, anwer'd with a great deal of Bitterness--\"Since they cannot be\r\nadvanced to the Kingdom, I had rather see them dead than shaven\"--And\r\nthereupon both her Grandsons were beheaded in her Presence. The same\r\n_Gregory_, lib. 3. cap. 18. subjoyns--\"This Queen, by her Liberalities\r\nand Gifts conferr'd upon Monasteries, got the Affections, _Plebis &\r\nvulgi_ of the common People and Mob: _Date frenos_ (says Cato)\r\n_impotenti naturæ, & indomito animali, & sperate ipsas modum licentiæ\r\nfacturas_. Give Bridles to their unruly Natures, and curb the untamed\r\nAnimal; and then, you may hope they shall see some Bounds to their\r\nLicentiousness.\" What an unbridled Animal and profligate Wretch was that\r\nDaughter of King _Theodorick_, by Birth an _Italian_; who being mad in\r\nLove with one of her Domesticks, and knowing him to have been kill'd by\r\nher Mother's Orders, feigned a thorough Reconciliation, and desir'd in\r\nToken of it to receive the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper with her\r\nMother; but Privately mixing some Poyson in the Chalice, She at once\r\ngave the strangest Instance both of Impiety and Cruelty in thus\r\nmurdering her own Mother. The Account given of it by _Gregory_ of\r\n_Tours_ is this: \"They were (says he) of the _Arrian Sect_, and because\r\nit was their Custom that the Royal Family shou'd communicate at the\r\nAltar out of one Chalice, and People of Inferior Quality out of another.\r\n(_By the way, pray take notice of the Custom of Communicating in both\r\nkinds by the People._) She dropped Poyson into that Chalice out of which\r\nher Mother was to communicate; which as soon as she had tasted of it,\r\nkill'd her presently.\"--_Fredegunda, Queen-Mother_, and Widow of\r\n_Chilperick the First_, got the Government into her Hands; She, in her\r\nHusband's Time, lived in Adultery with one _Lander_; and as soon as she\r\nfound out that her Husband _Chilperick_ had got Wind of it, she had him\r\nmurdered, and presently seiz'd upon the Administration of the Kingdom as\r\nQueen-Mother, and Guardian of her Son _Clotharius_, and kept Possession\r\nof it for 13 Years; in the first Place she poyson'd her Son's Uncle\r\n_Childebert_, together with his Wife; afterwards she stirred up the\r\n_Hunns_ against his Sons, and raised a Civil War in the Republick. And\r\nlastly, She was the Firebrand of all those Commotions which wasted and\r\nburnt all _Francogallia_, during many Years, as _Aimoinus_ tells us,\r\n[lib. 3. cap. 36. & lib. 8. cap. 29.]\r\n\r\nThere ruled once in _France_, _Brunechild_, Widow of King _Sigebert_,\r\nand Mother of _Childebert_. This woman had for her Adulterer a certain\r\n_Italian_, called _Protadius_, whom She advanced to great Honours: She\r\nbred up her two Sons, _Theodebert_ and _Theodorick_, in such a wicked\r\nand profligate Course of Life, that at last they became at mortal Enmity\r\nwith each other: And after having had long Wars, fought a cruel single\r\nCombat. She kill'd with her own Hands her Grandson _Meroveus_, the Son\r\nof _Theodebert:_ She poysoned her Son _Theodorick_. What need we say\r\nmore? _Date frænos_ (as _Cato_ says) _impotenti naturæ, & indomito\r\nanimali; & sperate illas modum licentiæ facturas_. She was the Occasion\r\nof the Death of Ten of the Royal Family: And when a certain Bishop\r\nreproved her, and exhorted her to mend her Life, She caused him to be\r\nthrown into the River. At last, a _Great Council_ of the _Franks_ being\r\nsummoned, She was judged, and condemned, and drawn in Pieces by wild\r\nhorses, being torn Limb from Limb. The Relators of this Story are,\r\n_Greg. Turonensis_, [lib. 5. cap. 39.] and [lib. 8. cap. 29.] And _Ado_\r\n[Ætat. 6.] _Otto Frising._ [Chron. 5. Cap. 7.] _Godfridus Viterbiensis_\r\n[Chron. parte 16.] & _Aimoinus_ [lib. 4. cap. 1.] Also the Appendix of\r\n_Gregory of Tours_, [lib. 11.] whose Words are these: \"_Having convicted\r\nher of being the Occasion of the Death of Ten Kings of the_ Franks; _to\r\nwit, of_ Sigebert, Meroveus, _and his Father_ Chilperick; Theodebert,\r\n_and his Son_ Clothair; Meroveus, _the Son of_ Clothair, Theodorick,\r\n_and his three Children, which had been newly killed, they order'd her\r\nto be placed upon a Camel, and to be tortured with divers sorts of\r\nTorments, and so to be carried about all the Army; afterwards to be tied\r\nby the Hair of the Head, one Leg and one Arm to a Wild Horse's Tail; by\r\nwhich being kick'd, and swiftly dragg'd about, She was torn Limb from\r\nLimb._\"\r\n\r\nLet us instance in some others: _Plectrudis_ got the Government into her\r\nHands; a Widow not of the King, but of _Pipin_, who ruled the Kingdom\r\nwhilst _Dagobert_ the Second bore the empty Title of King. This\r\n_Plectrudis_ having been divorced by her Husband _Pipin_, because of her\r\nmany Adulteries and flagitious Course of Life; as soon as her Husband\r\nwas dead, proved the Incendiary of many Seditions in France. She\r\ncompell'd that gallant Man _Charles Martel_, Mayor of the Palace, to\r\nquit his Employment, and in his Place put one _Theobald_, a most vile\r\nand wicked Wretch; and at last She raised a most grievous Civil War\r\namong the _Franks_, who in divers Battels discomfited each other with\r\nmost terrible Slaughters. Thus, says _Aimoinus_, [lib 4. cap. 50. & cap\r\nsequen.] Also the Author of a Book called, The State of the Kingdom of\r\n_France_ under _Dagobert_ the Second, has these Words: _\"When the_\r\nFranks _were no longer able to hear the Fury and Madness of_ Plectrude,\r\n_and saw no Hopes of Redress from King_ Dagobert, _they elected one_\r\nDaniel _for their King, (who formerly had been a Monk) and called him_\r\nChilperick.\" Which Story we have once before told you.\r\n\r\nBut let us proceed. The Queen-Mother of _Charles_ the _Bald_, (whose\r\nName was _Judith_) and Wife of _Lewis the Pious_, who had not only been\r\nKing of _Francogallia_, but Emperor of _Italy_ and _Germany_, got the\r\nGovernment into her Hands. This Woman stirred up a most terrible and\r\nfatal War between King _Lewis_ and his Sons, (her Sons in Law) from\r\nwhence arose so great a Conspiracy, that they constrained their Father\r\nto abdicate the Government, and give up the Power into their Hands, to\r\nthe great Detriment of almost all _Europe_: The Rise of which Mischiefs,\r\nour Historians do unanimously attribute, for the most Part, to _Queen\r\nJudith_ in a particular Manner: The Authors of this History are the\r\n_Abbot_ of _Ursperg_, _Michael Ritius_ and _Otto Frising._ [Chron. 5.\r\ncap. 34.] \"_Lewis_ (says this last) _by reason of the Evil Deeds of his\r\nWife_ Judith, _was driven out of his Kingdom_.\" Also _Rhegino_ [in Chron.\r\nann. 1338.] \"_Lewis_ (says he) _was deprived of the Kingdom by his\r\nSubjects, and being reduced to the Condition of a private Man, was put\r\ninto Prison, and the Sole Government of the Kingdom, by the Election of\r\nthe_ Franks, _was conferr'd upon_ Lotharius _his Son. And this\r\nDeprivation of_ Lewis _was occasioned principally through the many\r\nWhoredoms of his Wife_ Judith.\"\r\n\r\nSome Ages after, Queen _Blanch_, a _Spanish_ Woman, and Mother to St.\r\n_Lewis_, ruled the Land. As soon as She had seized the Helm of\r\nGovernment, the Nobility of _France_ began to take up Arms under the\r\nConduct of _Philip_ Earl of _Bologn_, the King's Uncle, crying out (as\r\nthat excellent Author _Joannes Joinvillæus_ writes) [cap. histor. 4.]\r\n\"_That it was not to be endured that so great a Kingdom shou'd be\r\ngoverned by a Woman, and She a Stranger._\" Whereupon those Nobles\r\nrejecting _Blanch_, chose Earl _Philip_ to be Administrator of the\r\nKingdom: But _Blanch_ persisting in her Purpose, sollicited Succours\r\nfrom all Parts, and at last determined to conclude a League with\r\n_Ferdinand_ King of _Spain_. With _Philip_ joyned the Duke of\r\n_Brittany_, and the _Count de Eureux_ his Brother. These, on a sudden,\r\nseiz'd on some Towns, and put good Garisons into them. And thus a\r\ngrievous War was begun in _France_, because the Administration of the\r\nGovernment had been seized by the Queen-Mother: It hapned that the King\r\nwent (about that Time) to _Estampes_, being sent thither by his Mother\r\nupon Account of the War: To that Place the Nobles from all Parts hastily\r\ngot together, and began to surround the King not with an Intention (as\r\n_Joinville_ says) to do him any Harm, but to withdraw him from the Power\r\nof his Mother. Which She hearing, with all Speed armed the People of\r\n_Paris_, and commanded them to march towards _Estampes_. Scarce were\r\nthese Forces got as far as _Montlebery_, when the King (getting from the\r\nNobles) joyned them, and returned along with them to _Paris_. As soon as\r\n_Philip_ found that he was not provided with a sufficient force of\r\nDomestick Troops, he sent for Succours to the Queen of _Cyprus_, (who at\r\nthe fame Time had some Controversy depending in the Kingdom) She entring\r\nwith a great Army into _Champagn_, plunder'd that Country far and near;\r\n_Blanch_ however continues in her Resolution. This constrains the\r\nNobility to call in the _English_ Auxiliaries, who waste _Aquitain_ and\r\nall the Maritime Regions; which Mischiefs arose thro' the Ambition and\r\nunbridled Lust of Rule of the Queen-Mother, as Joinvillæus tells us at\r\nlarge, [cap. 7, 8, 9, 10.]\r\n\r\nAnd because many of our Countrymen have a far different Opinion of the\r\nLife and Manners of Queen _Blanch_, occasioned (as 'tis probable) by the\r\nFlattery of the Writers of those Times; (For all Writers either thro'\r\nFear of Punishment, or, by Reason of the Esteem which the Kings their\r\nSons have in the World, are cautious how they write of Queen-Mothers:) I\r\nthink it not amiss to relate what _Joinville_ himself records [cap 76.]\r\n_viz._ That She had so great a Command over her Son, and had reduced him\r\nto that Degree of Timidity and Lowness of Spirit, that She would very\r\nseldom suffer the King to converse with his Wife _Margaret_, (her\r\nDaughter-in-Law) whom She hated. And therefore whenever the King went a\r\nJourney, She ordered the Purveyors to mark out different Lodgings, that\r\nthe Queen might lie separate from the King. So that the poor King was\r\nforced to place Waiters and Doorkeepers in Ambush whenever He went near\r\nhis Queen; Ordering them, that when they heard his Mother _Blanch_\r\napproach the Lodgings, they shou'd beat some Dogs, by whose Cry he might\r\nhave Warning to hide himself: And one Day (says _Joinville_) when Queen\r\n_Margaret_ was in Labour, and the King in Kindness was come to visit\r\nher, on a sudden Queen _Blanch_ surprized him in her Lodgings: For\r\naltho' he had been warned by the howling of the Dogs, and had hid\r\nhimself (wrapp'd up in the Curtains) behind the Bed; yet She found him\r\nout, and in the Presence of all the Company laid Hands on him, and drew\r\nhim out of the Chamber: You have nothing to do here (said She) get out.\r\nThe poor Queen, in the mean Time, being not able to bear the Disgrace of\r\nsuch a Reproof, fell into a Swoon for Grief; so that the Attendants were\r\nforced to call back the King to bring her to her self again, by whose\r\nReturn She was comforted and recover'd. _Joinville_ tells this Story\r\n[_cap. hist. 76._] in almost these same Words.\r\n\r\nAgain, Some Years after this, _Isabella_, Widow of _Charles_ the 6th,\r\n(Sirnamed the _Simple_) got Possession of the Government: For before the\r\nAdministration of the Publick Affairs cou'd be taken care of by the\r\n_Great Council_, or committed by them to the Management of chosen and\r\napproved Men, many ambitious Courtiers had stirr'd up Contentions: Six\r\nTimes these Controversies were renewed, and as often composed by\r\nAgreement. At last _Isabella_ being driven out of _Paris_ betook her\r\nself to _Chartres_: There, having taken into her Service a subtle Knave,\r\none _Philip de Morvilliers_, She made up a Council of her own, with a\r\nPresident, and appointed this _Morvilliers_ her Chancellor; by whose\r\nAdvice She order'd a Broad-Seal, commonly called, a Chancery-Seal, to be\r\nengraven: On which her own Image was cut, holding her Arms down by her\r\nSides: and in her Patents She made use of this Preamble. \"Isabella, _by\r\nthe Grace of God, Queen of_ France: _who, by Reason of the King's\r\nInfirmity, has the Administration of the Government in her Hands,\r\n&c._\"--But when the Affairs of the Commonwealth were reduced to that\r\ndesperate Future, that all Things went to Rack and Ruin, She was by the\r\n_Publick Council_ banished to _Tours_, and committed to the Charge of\r\nFour Tutors, who had Orders to keep her lock'd up at Home, and to watch\r\nher so narrowly, that She shou'd be able to do nothing; not so much as\r\nto write a Letter without their Knowledge. A large Account of all this\r\nTransaction we have in _Monstrellet's_; History. [_cap._ 161 & _cap._\r\n168.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\n    _Of the_ Juridical Parliaments _in_ France.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the _Capevingian_ Family there sprung up in _Francogallia_ a Kind\r\nof Judicial Reign, [_Regnum Judiciale_] of which (by Reason of the\r\nincredible Industry of the Builders up and Promoters of it, and their\r\nunconceivable Subtilty in all subsequent Ages), we think it necessary to\r\nsay something. A Sort of Men now rule every-where in _France_, which are\r\ncalled _Lawyers_ by some, and _Pleaders_ or _Pettyfoggers_ by others:\r\nThese Men, about 300 Years ago, managed their Business with so great\r\nCraft and Diligence, that they not only subjected to their Domination\r\nthe Authority of the _General Council_, (which we spoke of before) but\r\nalso all the _Princes_ and _Nobles_, and even the _Regal Majesty_ it\r\nself: So that in whatever Towns the Seats of this same _Judicial\r\nKingdom_ have been fix'd, very near the third Part of the Citizens and\r\nInhabitants have applied themselves to the Study and Discipline of this\r\nwrangling Trade, induced thereunto by the vast Profits and Rewards which\r\nattend it. Which every one may take Notice of, even in the City of\r\n_Paris_, the Capital of the Kingdom: For who can be three Days in that\r\nCity without observing, that the third Part of the Citizens are taken up\r\nwith the Practice of that _litigious_ and _Pettyfogging_ Trade?\r\nInsomuch, that the General Assembly of Lawyers in that City (which is\r\ncalled the _Robed Parliament_) is grown to so great a Heighth of Wealth\r\nand Dignity, that now it seems to be (what _Jugurtha_ said of old of the\r\n_Roman Senate_) no longer an _Assembly_ of _Counsellors_, but of\r\n_Kings_, and _Governors_ of _Provinces_. Since whoever has the Fortune\r\nto be a Member of it, how meanly born soever, in a few Years Time\r\nacquires immense and almost Regal Riches: For this Reason many other\r\nCities strove with Might and Main to have the like Privilege of\r\n_Juridical_ Assemblies: So that now there are several of these famous\r\nParliaments, to wit, those of _Paris, Tholouse, Rouen, Grenoble,\r\nBourdeaux, Aix_, and _Dijon_: All which are _fix'd_ and _sedentary_;\r\nbesides an Eighth, which is ambulatory and moveable, and is called the\r\n_Grand Council_.\r\n\r\nWithin the Limits of these great _Juridical Kingdoms_ there are others\r\nlesser, which we may call _Provincial Governments_, who do all they can\r\nto imitate the Grandeur and Magnificence of their Superiors; and these\r\nare called _Presidial Courts_: And so strong is the Force and Contagion\r\nof this Disease, that a very great Part of the _French_ Nation spends\r\nits Time and Pains in Strife and Law-Suits, in promoting Contentions and\r\nProcesses; just as of old, a great Number of the _Egyptians_ were\r\nemploy'd by their Tyrants in Building _Pyramids_, and other such useless\r\nStructures.\r\n\r\nNow the Word _Parliament_ in the old Manner of Speech used by our\r\nCountrymen, \"signifies a Debate, or discoursing together of many\r\nPersons, who come from several Parts, and assemble in a certain Place,\r\nthat they may communicate to one another Matters relating to the\r\nPublick.\" Thus in our ancient Chronicles, whenever Princes or their\r\nAmbassadors had a Meeting to treat of Peace or Truce, or other Warlike\r\nAgreements; the Assembly so appointed was always called a _Parliament_;\r\nand for the same Reason the _Publick Council_ of the _Estates_ was, in\r\nour old Language, called a _Parliament_. Which Assembly, being of great\r\nAuthority, the Kings of the _Capevingian_ Race having a Mind to diminish\r\nthat Authority by little and little, substituted in its Place a certain\r\nNumber of _Senators_, and transferred the August Title of a _Parliament_\r\nto those _Senators:_ And gave them these Privileges: First, That none of\r\nthe King's Edicts shou'd be of Force, and ratified, unless those\r\nCounsellors had been the _Advisors_ and _Approvers_ of them. Next, That\r\nno Magistracy or Employment in all _France_, whether Civil or Military,\r\nshou'd be conferr'd on any Person, without his being _inaugurated_, and\r\ntaking the _Oaths_ in that _Assembly_. Then that there should be _no\r\nLiberty of Appeal_ from their judgment, but that all their Decrees\r\nshould stand firm, and inviolable. In fine, whatever Power and Authority\r\nhad anciently been lodged in the _General Council_ of the Nation, during\r\nso many Years together, was at Length usurped by that _Counterfeit\r\nCouncil_, which the Kings took care to fill with such Persons as would\r\nbe most subservient to their Ends.\r\n\r\nWherefore it will be worth our while, to enquire from what Beginnings it\r\ngrew up to so great a Heighth and Power; First, a very magnificent\r\nPalace was built at _Paris_, by Order (as some say) of King _Lewis\r\nHutin_, which in our Ancient Language signifies _mutinous_ or\r\n_turbulent_. Others say, by _Philip the fair_, about the Year 1314.\r\nthro' the Industry and Care of _Enguerrant de Marigny_ Count of\r\n_Longueville_, who was hanged some Years after on a Gallows at _Paris_,\r\nfor embezzling the Publick Money, Whoever 'twas that built it, we may\r\naffirm, that our _Francogallican_ Kings took the same Pains in building\r\nup this _litigious Trade_, that the _Egyptian_ Monarchs are said to have\r\ndone in employing their Subjects to build the _Pyramids_; among whom\r\n_Chemnis_ is recorded to have gathered together 360000 Men to raise one\r\nPyramid. _Gaguinus_, in his History of King _Hutin's_ Life, has this\r\nPassage,--\"_This_ Lewis _ordained, That the Court of Parliament should\r\nremain fixed and immoveable in the City of_ Paris, that Suitors and\r\nClients might not be put to the Trouble of frequent Removals.\" Now what\r\nsome affirm, that _Pipin_ or _Charlemagn_ were the Authors of this\r\nInstitution, is very absurd, as we shall plainly make appear. For most\r\nof the Laws and Constitutions of _Charlemagn_ are extant; in all which\r\nthere is not the least Mention made of the Word _Parliament_, nor of\r\nthat great _fixed Senate_; he only ordains, That in certain known Places\r\nhis Judges should keep a _Court_, and assemble the People; which\r\naccording to his usual Custom he calls a _Placitum_, or a _Mallum_, as\r\n[_lib. 4. cap. 35._ Legis _Franciæ_] 'tis written, \"_He shall cause no\r\nmore than three general_ Placita _to be kept in one Year, unless by\r\nchance some Person is either accused, or seizes another Man's Property,\r\nor is summoned to be a Witness--._\" There are many other Laws extant of\r\nthat King's of the like Nature, by which we may observe the Paucity of\r\nLaw-suits in his Days: And I am clearly of Opinion, that what I find\r\nseveral of our modern Authors have affirm'd is most true, _viz._ that\r\nthe first Rise and Seeds of so many Law-suits, Calumnies and Contentions\r\nin this Kingdom, proceeded from Pope _Clement_ the Fifth, who during the\r\nReign of _Philip the Fair_, transferred the Seat of his Papacy to\r\n_Avignon_, at which Time his Courtiers and Petty-Foggers, engaging into\r\nAcquaintance with our Countrymen, Introduced the _Roman_ Arts of\r\nWrangling into our Manners and Practice. But not to speak of such remote\r\nTimes. About the Year of our Lord 1230. reigned St. _Lewis_, as he is\r\nplainly called, whose Life _Johannes Joinvillæus_ (whom we have often\r\nmentioned) has written at large. Out of his Commentary we may easily\r\nlearn, how few Contentions and Law-Suits were in those Days, since King\r\n_Lewis_ either determined the Controversies himself in Person, or\r\nreferred them to be determined by some of his Followers and Companions:\r\nAnd therefore [_cap._ 94.] he thus writes,--\"_He was wont_ (says he) _to\r\ncommand Lord_ Nellius, _Lord_ Soissons, _or my self, to inspect and\r\nmanage the Appeals which were made to him. Afterwards he sent for us,\r\nand enquired into the State of the Case; and whether it were of such a\r\nNature as could not be ended without his own Intervention. Oftentimes it\r\nhapned, that after we had made our Report, he sent for the contending\r\nParties, and heard the Cause impartially argued over again. Sometimes\r\nfor his Diversion he would go to the Park of_ Bois de Vincennes, _and\r\nsitting down upon a green Sodd at the Foot of an Oak Tree, would command\r\nus to sit by him; and there if any one had Business, he wou'd cause him\r\nto be called, and bear him patiently. He wou'd often himself proclaim\r\naloud, That if any one had Business, or a Controversy with an Adversary,\r\nhe might come near and set forth the Merits of his Cause; then if any\r\nPetitioner came, he wou'd hear him attentively; and having throughly\r\nconsidered the Case, wou'd pass judgment according to Right and Justice.\r\nAt other Times he appointed_ Peter Fountain _and_ Godfrey Villet _to\r\nplead the Causes of the contending Parties. I have often_ (says he)\r\n_seen that good King go out of Paris into one of his Gardens or Villa's\r\nwithout the Walls, dressed very plainly, and there order a Carpet to be\r\nspread before him on a Table; and having caused Silence to be\r\nproclaimed, those which were at Variance with each other, were\r\nintroduced to plead their Causes; and then he presently did Justice\r\nwithout Delay._\" Thus far _Joinvillæus_--By which we may guess at the\r\nsmall Number of Law Suits and Complainants in those Days, and how\r\ncareful our Kings were of preventing the Mischiefs that might arise from\r\nsuch as fomented Controversies. In the _Capitular_ of _Charles the\r\nGreat_ this Law is extant.--\"_Be it known unto all Persons both Nobility\r\nand People, by these our Patents, That we will sit one Day in every Week\r\nto hear Causes in Person._\"\r\n\r\nWe have the like Testimony in _William Budæus_, a very famous Man, and a\r\nPrincipal Ornament of our Kingdom of _France_. For in his Annotations on\r\nthe _Pandects_ (where he treats of this very Argument, and inveighs\r\nagainst this _Kingdom of Brawlers and Petty-Foggers_) he tells us, that\r\nhe finds in the Regal Commentaries of Venerable Antiquity, (the free\r\nPerusal of which his Quality did intitle him to) \"_That in the Reign of\r\nthe same King_ Lewis, [Anno 1230.] _several Controversies arose between\r\nthe King and the Earl of_ Britany; _And that by Consent (as 'tis\r\nprobable) of both Parties, a Camp-Court of Judicature was summoned to\r\nmeet at_ Erceniacum, _wherein sate as Judges, not Lawyers, Civilians and\r\nDoctors, but Bishops, Earls, and Barons. And there the Earl of_ Britany\r\n_was cast, and it was order'd that the Inhabitants of his County should\r\nbe absolved and freed from the Oath of Allegiance and fidelity, which\r\nthey had taken to him_. Again, in the same King's Reign, [Anno 1259.] _a\r\nDispute having arisen about the County of_ Clairmont _between the King\r\nand the Earls of_ Poitou _and_ Anjou, _a Court of Judicature, composed\r\nof the like Persons was appointed, wherein sat the Bishops and Abbots,\r\nthe General of the_ Dominicans, _the Constable, the Barons, and several_\r\nLaicks. To this he subjoyns: _Yet there were two Parliaments called each\r\nYear, at_ Christmas _and at_ Candlemas, _like as there are two_ Scacaria\r\n_summoned in_ Normandy _at_ Easter _and at_ Michaelmas.\" Thus far\r\n_Budæus_; to whom agrees what we find in an ancient Book concerning the\r\n_Institution of Parliaments_, wherein this Article is quoted out of the\r\n_Constitution of Philip_ the 4th, Sirnamed the _Fair_ [ex Anno\r\n1302.]--\"_Moreover, for the Conveniency of our Subjects, and the\r\nexpeditious determining of Causes, we propose to have it enacted, that\r\ntwo Parliaments shall be held every Year at_ Paris, _and two_ Scacaria\r\n_at_ Rouen: _That the_ Dies Trecenses _shall be held twice a Year: and\r\nthat a Parliament shall be held at_ Tholouse, _as it used to be held in\r\npast Times, if the People of the Land consent to it: Also, because many\r\nCauses of great Importance are debated in our Parliament, between great\r\nand notable Personages; We ordain and appoint, that two Prelates, and\r\ntwo other sufficient Persons, being Laymen of our Council; or at least\r\none Prelate and one Laick, shall be continually present in our\r\nParliaments, to hear and deliberate concerning the above-mentioned\r\nCauses.\"_--From which Words we may learn, First, how _seldom_ the Courts\r\nof Judicature heard Causes in those Days. Next, how few judges sat in\r\nthose _Parliaments_. For as to the other Provinces and Governments of\r\nthe Kingdom, we have (in the same Book) the _Constitution of Philip the\r\nFair_, in these Words, [Anno 1302.]--\"_Moreover, We ordain that our\r\nSeneschals and Bayliffs shall hold their Assizes in Circuit throughout\r\ntheir Counties and Bayliwicks once every two Months at least.\"_\r\n\r\nFurthermore, _Budæus_ in the same Place, [Anno 1293.] writes, that\r\n_Philip_ the _Fair_ appointed, that three Sorts of People shou'd sit in\r\nParliament, viz. _Prelates, Barons_, and _Clerks mixed with Laymen:_\r\n\"Since the Laicks (says he) are chosen promiscuously out of the Knights,\r\nand out of other Sorts of People. Also, that the Prelates and Barons\r\nshou'd select fit Persons out of that third Estate, to exercise every\r\nSort of Judicature; and at the same Time shou'd chuse three Judges, who\r\nshou'd be sent abroad into those Countries where the written Laws of the\r\nLand had their Course, that they might there judge and determine\r\naccording to Law. And if any Question of great Importance were to be\r\nargued, they should take to their Assistance the most Learned Men they\r\ncould get.--\" In which Place, _Budæus_ lamenting the Evil Customs of our\r\nTimes; that is, this _Kingdom of Lawyers_ now in Vogue, breaks out with\r\n_Juvenal_ into this Exclamation: \"_Quondam hoc indigenæ vivebant more!\r\nSo_ (says he) _may I exclaim, that in Old Times, when this Kingdom\r\nflourished, (as many appear by our Money coined of pure fine Gold) there\r\nwas a plain and easy Way of doing Justice; there were few Law-suits, and\r\nthose not of long Continuance, or indeed Eternal, as now they are; for\r\nthen this Rabble-Rout of pretended Interpreters of the Law had not\r\ninvaded the Publick: neither was the Science of the Law stretched out to\r\nsuch an unlimited Extent; but Truth and Equity, and a prudent Judge,\r\nendued with Integrity and Innocence, was of more worth than Six hundred\r\nVolumes of Law-Books. But now to what a sad Condition Things are\r\nbrought, every one sees, but no Body dares speak out. [Sed omnes dicere\r\nmussant.]\"_ Thus far honest _Budæus_; a most inveterate Adversary of\r\nthis Art of Chicanery, upon all Occasions.\r\n\r\nTo return to our Purpose, of giving an Account upon what Foundations and\r\nBeginnings this _Reign of Litigiousness_ was first raised. As _Cicero_\r\nwrites, that the Old High-Priests (by Reason of the Multitude of\r\nSacrifices) instituted three Assistants called _Viri Epulones_, altho'\r\nthey themselves were appointed by _Numa_ to offer Sacrifice at the _Ludi\r\nEpulares_: In like Manner, out of a very _Small Number_ of Parliamentary\r\nJudges, (when Law-Suits and Litigiousness increased) swarm'd this\r\nincredible Multitude of _Judges_, and _Spawn_ of _Counsellors_. And, in\r\nthe first Place, a great, sumptuous and magnificent Palace was built (as\r\nwe told you before) either by the Command of _Lewis Hutin_, or of\r\n_Philip the Fair:_ then (from a moderate Number of judges) three Courts\r\nof Ten each, were elected a [_tres decurie_] _viz._ Of the _great\r\nChamber_ of _Accounts_, of _Inquests_, and of _Requests_. Which\r\nPartition _Budæus_ speaks of in the above quoted Place, but more at\r\nlarge _Gaguinus_ in his Life of King _Lewis Hutin_.\r\n\r\nI must not omit one remarkable Thing that ought for ever to be\r\nremembred, which both these Authors have transmitted to Posterity:\r\n_viz._ That this Meeting of the Court of Judicature was not _perpetual_\r\nand _fixed_, as 'tis now, but _summonable_ by the _King's Writs_, which\r\nevery Year were renewed by Proclamation about the Beginning of\r\n_November:_ \"_And that we may be certain_ (says _Gaguinus) that the King\r\nwas the Original and Author of this solemn Convention; the Royal Writs\r\nare issued every Year, whereby the Parliament is authorized to meet on\r\nthe Feast-day of_ St. Martin, _that is, on the 10th of_ November.\"\r\n\r\nNow of the wonderful and speedy Increase of this _Judicial Kingdom_, we\r\nhave this Instance; That about a hundred Years after its Beginning, that\r\nis, in the Year 1455, in the Reign of _Charles_ the 7th, we find this\r\nOrder made by him--_From the Feast of_ Easter, _till the End of the\r\nParliament, the Presidents and Counsellors ought to meet in their\r\nrespective Chambers at Six a Clock every Morning: from the Feast of St._\r\nMartin _forwards, they may meet later.--_And a little after it says, _We\r\njudge it very necessary, that the Presidents and Counsellors of the\r\nCourt shou'd come to Parliament after Dinner, for the Dispatch of\r\nCauses, and of Judgments._ This was _Charles_ the 7th's Order: But in\r\n_Charles_ the Great's Reign, who ruled a Kingdom three Times as big, we\r\nfind a very different Manner of rendring Justice; as we may easily\r\nunderstand by that Law of his, mention'd lib. 4. cap. 74. _Legis\r\nFranciæ_; \"_Let a_ Comes, _a Judge_ (says he) _not hold a_ Placitum,\r\n_(that is, not pass a Decree) but before Dinner, or Fasting._\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the Word _Parliament_, and the Authority of that Name, we\r\nhave this Argument; That when of old a Senate was instituted in\r\n_Dauphine_ with supreme Authority, which was commonly called the\r\n_Council of Dauphine_; _Lewis_ the 11th endeavouring to oblige the\r\n_Dauphinois_, who had well deserved from him, changed the Name of this\r\n_Council_ into that of a _Parliament_, without adding any Thing to the\r\nPrivileges or Authority of it. Of which _Guidopappius_ is our Witness.\r\n[Quest. 43. and again quest. 554.]\r\n\r\nFINIS.",
