VI.--OCTOBER, 1864.--No. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME USES OF A CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar is a great evil. We may confess that, at the start. The Peace\r\nSociety has the argument its own way. The bloody field, the mangled\r\ndying, hoof-trampled into the reeking sod, the groans, and cries, and\r\ncurses, the wrath, and hate, and madness, the horror and the hell of a\r\ngreat battle, are things no rhetoric can ever make lovely.\r\n\r\nThe poet may weave his wreath of victory for the conqueror; the\r\nhistorian, with all the pomp of splendid imagery, may describe the\r\nheroism of the day of slaughter; but, after all, and none know this\r\nbetter than the men most familiar with it, a great battle is the most\r\nhateful and hellish sight that the sun looks on in all his courses.\r\n\r\nAnd the actual battle is only a part. The curse goes far beyond the\r\nfield of combat. The trampled dead and dying are but a tithe of the\r\nactual sufferers. There are desolate homes, far away, where want changes\r\nsorrow into madness. Wives wail by hearthstones where the household\r\nfires have died into cold ashes forever more. Like Rachel, mothers weep\r\nfor the proud boys that lie stark beneath the pitiless stars. Under a\r\nthousand roofs--cottage roofs and palace roofs--little children ask for\r\n'father.' The pattering feet shall never run to meet, upon the\r\nthreshold, _his_ feet, who lies stiffening in the bloody trench far\r\naway!\r\n\r\nThere are added horrors in _civil war_. These forms, crushed and torn\r\nout of all human semblance, are our brothers. These wailing widows,\r\nthese small fatherless ones speak our mother language, utter their pain\r\nin the tongue of our own wives and children. Victory seems barely better\r\nthan defeat, when it is victory over our own blood. The scars we carve\r\nwith steel or burn with powder across the shuddering land, are scars on\r\nthe dear face of the Motherland we love. These blackened roof-trees,\r\nthey are the homes of our kindred. These cities, where shells are\r\nbursting through crumbling wall and flaming spire, they are cities of\r\nour own fair land, perhaps the brightest jewels in her crown.\r\n\r\nAy! men do well to pray for _peace!_ With suppliant palms outstretched\r\nto the pitying God, they do well to cry, as in the ancient litany, 'Give\r\npeace in our time, O Lord!' Let the husbandman go forth in the furrow.\r\nLet the cattle come lowing to the stalls at evening. Let bleating\r\nflocks whiten all the uplands. Let harvest hymns be sung, while groaning\r\nwagons drag to bursting barns their mighty weight of sheaves. Let mill\r\nwheels turn their dripping rounds by every stream. Let sails whiten\r\nalong every river. Let the smoke of a million peaceful hearths rise like\r\nincense in the morning. Let the shouts of happy children, at their play,\r\nring down ten thousand valleys in the summer day's decline. Over all the\r\nblessed land, asleep beneath the shadow of the Almighty hand, let the\r\npeace of God rest in benediction! 'Give _peace_ in our time, O Lord!'\r\n\r\nAnd yet the final clause to, every human prayer must be 'Thy will be\r\ndone!' There are things better far than peace. There are things more\r\nloathely and more terrible than, the horror of battle and 'garments\r\nrolled in blood.' Peace is blessed, but if you have peace with hell, how\r\nabout the blessedness? A covenant with evil is not the sort of agreement\r\nthat will bring comfort. A truce with Satan is not the thing that it\r\nwill do to trust. There are things in this world, without which the\r\nprayer for peace is 'a witch's prayer,' read backward to a curse.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, whether peace is good depends entirely on the further\r\nquestion, With whom are you at peace? Whether war is evil depends on the\r\nother question, With whom are you at war? In one most serious and\r\nsubstantial point of view, human life is a battle, which, for the\r\nindividual, ends only with death, and, for the race, only with the Final\r\nConsummation. The tenure of our place and right, as children of God, is\r\nthat we fight evil to the bitter end. 'The Prince of Peace' Himself came\r\n'not to send peace,' in this war, 'but a sword.'\r\n\r\nWe may venture, then, to say that there are some wars which are not all\r\nevil. They are terrible, but terrible like the hurricane, which sweeps\r\naway the pestilence; terrible like the earthquake, on whose night of\r\nterror God builds a thousand years of blooming plenty; terrible like the\r\nvolcano, whose ashes are clothed by the purple vintages and yellow\r\nharvests of a hundred generations. The strong powers of nature are as\r\nbeneficent as strong. The destroying powers are also creating powers.\r\nLife sits upon the sepulchre, and sings over buried Death through all\r\nnature and all time. War, too, has its compensations.\r\n\r\nFor years, amid the world's rages, _we_ had peace. The only war we had,\r\nat all events, was one of our own seeking, and a mere playing at war.\r\nMany of us thought it would be so always. We believed we had discovered\r\na method of settling all the world's difficulties without blows. The\r\npeace people had their jubilee. They talked about the advance of\r\nintelligence, and the softening power of civilization. They placed war\r\namong the forgotten horrors of a dead barbarism. They proved that\r\ncommerce had rendered war impossible, because it had made it against\r\nself-interest. They talked about reason and persuasion, and moral\r\ninfluences. They asked, 'Why not settle all troubles in a grand world's\r\ncongress, some huge palaver and paradise of speechmakers, where it will\r\nbe all talk and voting and no blows?' Why not, indeed? How easy to\r\n'resolve' this poor, blind, struggling world of ours into a bit of\r\nheaven, you see, and so end our troubles! How easy to vote these poor,\r\nstupid, blundering brothers of ours into angels, in some great\r\nparliament of eloquent philosophers, and govern them thereafter on that\r\nbasis!\r\n\r\nNow, resolutions and speeches and grand palavers are nice things, in\r\ntheir way, _to play with_, but, on the whole, it is best to get down to\r\nthe hard fact if one really wants to work and prosper. And the hard fact\r\nis, that Adam's sons are not yet cherubs, nor their homestead, among the\r\nstars, just yet an outlying field of paradise. It is a planet whose\r\nprivate affairs are badly muddled. Its tenants for life are a\r\nquarrelsome, ill-tempered, unruly set of creatures altogether. As things\r\ngo, they will break each others' heads sometimes. It is very\r\nunreasonable. I can see that. But men are not always reasonable. It is\r\nnot for their own interest. I can see that too. But how often does\r\ninterest, the best and highest, raise an impregnable barrier against\r\npassion or even caprice?\r\n\r\nWe must take men as they are, and the world as we find it, to get a\r\nsecure ground for attempting the reformation of either. And as men are,\r\nand as I find the world, at present, I meet Wrong, and find it armed to\r\nresist Right. The Wrong will not yield to persuasion, it will not\r\nsurrender to reason. It comes straight on, coarse, brutal, devilish,\r\ncaring not a straw for peace rhetoric or Quaker gravity, for persuasion\r\nor interest. It strikes straight down at right or justice. It tries to\r\nhammer them to atoms, and trample them with swinish hoofs into the mire.\r\nNow what am I to do? To stand peaceably by and see this thing done,\r\nwhile I study new tropes and invent new metaphors to _persuade_? Is that\r\nmy business, to waste the godlike gift of human speech on this mad brute\r\nor devil?\r\n\r\nWith wise pains and thoughtful labor, I clear my little spot of this\r\nstubborn soil. I hedge and plant my small vineyard. It begins, after\r\nmuch care, to yield me some fruit. I get a little corn and a little\r\nwine, to comfort me and mine. I have good hope that, as the years go by,\r\nI shall gather more. I trust, at last, my purple vintages may gladden\r\nmany hearts of men, my rich olives make many faces shine. But some day,\r\nfrom the yet untamed forest, bursts the wild boar, and rushes on my\r\nhedge, and will break through to trample down my vineyard before mine\r\neyes. And I am only to _argue_ with him! I am to cast the pearls of\r\nhuman reason and persuasion at his feet to stop him! Nay, rather, am I\r\nnot to seize the first sufficient weapon that comes to hand, unloose the\r\ndogs upon him, and drive him to his lair again, or, better, bring his\r\nhead in triumph home?\r\n\r\nIt is true, there are wars where this parable will not apply. There are\r\ncapricious wars, wars undertaken for no fit cause, wars with scarce a\r\nprinciple on either side. Such have often been _king's wars_, begun in\r\nfolly, conducted in vanity, ended in shame, wars for the ambition of\r\nsome crowned scoundrel, who rides a patient people till he drives them\r\nmad. And even such wars have their uses. They are not wholly evil.\r\nAlexander's, the maddest wars of all, and those of his successors, the\r\nmost stupid and brutal ever fought, even they had their uses. Our war\r\nwith poor Mexico, even Louis Bonaparte's, was not wholly evil.\r\n\r\nBut there are wars, again, that are not capricious, that are simply\r\nnecessary, unavoidable, as life, death, or judgment, wars where the\r\nchoice is to see right trampled out of sight or to fight for it, where\r\ntruth and justice are crushed unless the sword be grasped and used,\r\nwhere law and civilization and Christianity are assailed by savagery,\r\nbrutality, and devilishness, and only the true bullet and the cold steel\r\nare received in the discussion. These are the Peoples' wars. In them\r\nnations arm. Generations swarm to their battle fields. They are\r\nlandmarks in the world's advancement. For victories in them men sing _Te\r\nDeums_ throughout the ages. The heroes, who fell in them, loom through\r\nthe haze of time like demigods.\r\n\r\nOn the plains of Tours, when the Moslem tide, that swept on to overwhelm\r\nin ruin Christian Europe, was met, and stemmed, and turned by Charles\r\nMartel, and, breaking into foam against the iron breasts of his stalwart\r\nFranks, was whirled away into the darkness like spray before the\r\ntempest, the _Hammer-man_ did a work that day that, till the end of\r\ntime, a world will thank Heaven for, as _he_ thanked it in the hour of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAnd when his greater grandson, creator, guide, and guardian of modern\r\ncivilization, paced with restless, ever-present steps, around the\r\nborders of that small world of light which he had built up, half\r\nblindly, in the overwhelming dark, and with two-handed blows beat back,\r\nwith the iron mace of Germany, the savage assaults of Saracen and\r\nSclave, of black Dane and brutal Wendt, and smote on till he died\r\nsmiting, for order, and law, and faith, and so saved Europe, and, let us\r\nhumbly hope, his own rude but true soul _alive_! are not the thanks of\r\nall the world well due, that Karl der Grosse was no non-resistant, but a\r\ngreat, broad-shouldered, royal soldier, who wore the imperial purple by\r\nright of a moat imperial sword?\r\n\r\nThere are wars like these, that, as the world goes, are inevitable. Some\r\nwrong undertakes to rule. Some lie challenges sovereignty. Some mere\r\nbrutality or heathenism faces order, civilization, and law. There is no\r\nchoice in the matter _then_. The wrong, the lie, the brutality, the\r\nbarbarism _must go down_. If they listen to reason, well. If they can be\r\nonly preached or lectured into dying peaceably, and getting quietly\r\nburied, it is an excellent consummation. If they do not, if they try\r\nconclusions, as they are far more apt to do, if they come on with brute\r\nforce, there is no alternative. They must be met by force. They must get\r\nthe only persuasion that can influence them--hard knocks, and plenty of\r\nthem, well delivered, straight at the heart.\r\n\r\nWars so undertaken, under a divine necessity, and with a divine sadness,\r\ntoo, by a patient people, whose business is not brutal fighting, but\r\npeaceful working, wars of this sort, in the world's long history, are\r\nscarce evils at all, and, even in the day of their wrath, bring\r\ncompensative blessings. They may be fierce and terrible, they may bring\r\nwretchedness and ruin, they may 'demoralize' armies and people, they may\r\nbe dreadful evils, and leave long trails of desolation, but they are\r\nnone the less wars for victories in which men will return thanks while\r\nthe world shall stand. The men who fall in such wars, receive the\r\nbenedictions of their kind. The people that, with patient pain, stands\r\nand fights in them, bleeding drop by drop, and conquering or dying, inch\r\nby inch, but never yielding, because it feels the deathless value of\r\n_the cause_, the brave, calm people, who so fight is crowned forever on\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nFrom our paradise of a lamb-like world this nation was awakened, three\r\nyears ago, by a cannon shot across Charleston harbor. The fools who\r\nfired it knew not what they did, perhaps. They thought to open fire on a\r\npoor old fort and its handful of a garrison. They _did_ open fire on\r\ncivilization, on order, on law, on the world's progress, on the hopes of\r\nman. There, at last, we were brought face to face with hard facts. Talk,\r\nin Congress, or out, was at an end. Voting and balloting, and\r\nspeech-making were ruled out of order. We had administered the country,\r\nso far, by that machinery. It was puffed away at one discharge of glazed\r\npowder. The cannon alone could get a hearing. The bullet and the bayonet\r\nwere the only arguments. No matter how it might end, we were forced to\r\naccept the challenge. No matter how utterly we might hate war, we were\r\nforced to try the last old persuasive--the naked sword.\r\n\r\nI cannot see how any honest and sensible man can now look back and see\r\nany other course possible. Could we stand by and see our house beaten\r\ninto blackened ruin over our heads? Were we to talk 'peace,' and use\r\n'moral suasion' in the mouth of shotted cannon? Were we prepared to see\r\nthe Constitution and the law, bought by long years of toil and blood,\r\ntorn to tatters by the caprice of ambitious madmen? Fighting became a\r\nsimple duty in an hour! There was no escape. What a pity that so many\r\nbeautiful peace speeches (Charles Sumner's very eloquent ones among the\r\nrest!) should have been proved mere froth and wasted paper rags by one\r\nshort telegram!\r\n\r\nSo the great evil came to _us_, as it has come to all nations, as we\r\nbelieve it _must_ come, from what we now see, to every nation that will\r\nbe great and strong. The land, for a time, staggered under the blow.\r\nMen's souls for an hour were struck dumb, so sudden was it, so unlocked\r\nfor. As duty became clearer, we awaked at last to the fact that was at\r\nour doors. We turned to deal with it, as the best nations always do,\r\ncheerfully and hopefully. We have made mistakes and great ones. We have\r\nblundered fearfully. That was to have been expected. But we have gone\r\non, nevertheless, steadfastly, patiently. That was also to have been\r\nexpected. For three years and over, this has been our business. We have\r\nindeed carried on some commerce, and some manufactures, and some\r\nagriculture, but our main work has been fighting. The rest have been\r\nsubsidiary to that. And the land groans and pants with this bloody toil.\r\nIt clothes itself in mourning and darkens its streets, and desolates its\r\nhomes, and bleeds its life drops slowly in its patient agony. But it\r\nnever falters. It has accepted the appointed work. It sees no outlook\r\nyet, no chance for the bells to ring out peace over the roar of cannon,\r\nand it stands at its post bleeding, but wrestling still.\r\n\r\nHas there been nothing gained, however? For the terrible outlay is there\r\nyet no return? Has the war been evil and only evil so far, even granting\r\nthat we do not finally succeed, according to our wish? The present\r\nwriter does not think so. He believes there have been gains already, and\r\ngreat gains, not merely the gains that may be summed in the advance of\r\nforces, in territory recovered, in cities taken, in enemies defeated,\r\nbut gains which, though not visible like these, are no less real and\r\nvastly more valuable, gains which add to the nation's moral power, and\r\neducate it for the future. He leaves to others the consideration of the\r\nmaterial gain, and desires to hint, at least, at this other, which is\r\nmuch more likely to be slighted or perhaps forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe has said enough to show that he does not like this slaughtering\r\nbusiness in any shape. He is sure that the sooner it is ended the\r\nbetter. He has had its bloody consequences brought, in their most\r\nfearful form, to his own heart and home, but he has a fixed faith,\r\nnevertheless, that any duty, conscientiously undertaken, any duty from\r\nwhich there is no honorable or honest escape, must, if faithfully\r\nperformed, obtain its meet reward. And believing that this business of\r\nwar has been undertaken by the mass of the people of these United States\r\nin all simplicity of heart and honesty of purpose, as an unavoidable and\r\nhard necessity, he also believes they will get their honest wages for\r\nthe doing it. He believes, too, that the day of recompense is not\r\nentirely delayed; that benefits, large and excellent, have already\r\nresulted to the nation. He sees already visible uses, which, to some\r\nextent at least, should comfort and sustain a people, even under the\r\nawful curse and agony of a civil war. He writes to show these uses to\r\nothers, that they too may take heart and hope, when the days are\r\ndarkest.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this war is, at last, our _national independence_.\r\nTo be sure, we read of a war carried on by our fathers to secure that\r\nboon. They paid a large price for it, and they got it, and got all\r\nnations to acknowledge they deserved it, including the great nation they\r\nfought with. It was their _political_ independence only. It secured\r\nnothing beyond that. _Morally_ we were not independent. _Socially_, we\r\nwere not independent. There was a time, we can all remember it, when we\r\nliterally trembled before every cockney that strangled innocent\r\naspirates at their birth. We had not secured our moral independence of\r\nEurope, and particularly not of our own kindred and people. We literally\r\ncrouched at the feet of England, and begged for recognition like a poor,\r\ndisowned relation. We scarcely knew what was right till England told us.\r\nWe dare not accept a thing as wise, proper, or becoming till we had\r\nheard her verdict. What will England say? How will they think of this\r\nacross the water? In all emergencies these were the questions thought,\r\nat least, if not spoken. We lived in perpetual terror of transatlantic\r\nopinion. Some cockney came to visit us. He might be a fool, a puppy, an\r\nintolerably bore, an infinite ass. It made no difference. He rode our\r\nconsciousness like a nightmare. He and his note book dominated free\r\nAmerica. 'What does he think of us? What will he say of us?' We actually\r\ngrovelled before the creature, more than once begging for his good word,\r\nhis kindly forbearance, his pity for our faults and failures. 'We know\r\nwe are wicked, for we are republicans, O serene John! We are sinful, for\r\nwe have no parish beadle. We are no better than the publicans, for we\r\nhave no workhouse. We are altogether sinners, for we have no lord. It is\r\nalso a sad truth that there are people among us who have been seen to\r\neat with a knife, and but very few that could say, '_H_old _H_ingland,'\r\nwith the true London aspiration. But be merciful notwithstanding. We beg\r\npardon for all our faults. We recognize thy great kindness in coming\r\namong such barbarians. We will treat thee kindly as we can, and copy thy\r\nmanners as closely as we can, and so try to improve ourselves. Do not,\r\ntherefore, for the present, annihilate us with the indignation of thy\r\noutraged virtue. Have a touch of pity for us unfortunate and degenerate\r\nAmericans!'\r\n\r\nThat supplication is hardly an exaggeration. It was utterly shameful,\r\nthe position we took in this matter of deference to English opinion. No\r\npeople ever more grossly imposed upon themselves. We had an ideal\r\nEngland, which we almost worshipped, whose good opinion we coveted like\r\nthe praise of a good conscience. We bowed before her word, as the child\r\nbows to the rebuke of a mother he reverences. She was Shakspeare's\r\nEngland, Raleigh's England, Sidney's England, the England of heroes and\r\nbards and sages, our grand old Mother, who had sat crowned among the\r\nnations for a thousand years. We were proud to claim even remote\r\nrelationship with the Island Queen. We were proud to speak her tongue,\r\nto reenact her laws, to read her sages, to sing her songs, to claim her\r\nancient glory as partly our own. England, the stormy cradle of our\r\nnation, the sullen mistress of the angry western seas, our hearts went\r\nout to her, across the ocean, across the years, across war, across\r\ninjustice, and went out still in love and reverence. We never dreamed\r\nthat our ideal England was dead and buried, that the actual England was\r\nnot the marble goddess of our idolatry, but a poor Brummagem image,\r\ncoarse lacquer-ware and tawdry paint! We never dreamed that the queenly\r\nmother of heroes was nursing 'shopkeepers' now, with only shopkeepers'\r\nethics, 'pawnbrokers' morality'!\r\n\r\nAt last our eyes are opened. To-day we stand a self-centred nation. We\r\nhave seen so much of English consistency, of English nobleness, we have\r\nso learned to prize English honor and English generosity, that there is\r\nnot a living American, North or South, who values English opinion, on\r\nany point of national right, duty, or manliness, above the idle\r\nwhistling of the wind. Who considers it of the slightest consequence now\r\nwhat England may think on any matter American? Who has the curiosity to\r\nask after an English opinion?\r\n\r\nThis much the war has done for us. We are at last a _nation_. We have\r\nfound a conscience of our own. We have been forced to stand on our own\r\nnational sense of right and wrong. We are independent morally as well as\r\npolitically, in opinion as well as in government. We shall never turn\r\nour eyes again across the sea to ask what any there may say or think of\r\nus. We have found that perhaps we do not understand them. We have\r\ncertainly found that they do not understand us. We have taken the stand\r\nwhich every great people is obliged to take soon or late. We are\r\nsufficient for ourselves. Our own national conscience, our own sense of\r\nright and duty, our own public sentiment is our guide henceforth. By\r\nthat we stand or fall. By that, and that only, will we consent that men\r\nshould judge us. We are a grown-up nation from this time forth. We\r\nanswer for ourselves to humanity and the future. We decide all causes at\r\nour own judgment seat.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another good, perhaps larger than this, which we have won,\r\na good which contains and justifies this moral, national independence:\r\nWe have been baptized at last into the family of great nations, by that\r\nred baptism which, from the first, has been the required initiation into\r\nthat august brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the invariable law, of earthly life at least, that\r\nhumanity can advance only by the road of suffering. It is so with\r\nindividuals. There is no spiritual growth without pain. Prosperity alone\r\nnever makes a grand character. Purple and fine linen never clothe the\r\nhero. There are powers and gifts in the soul of man that only come to\r\nlife and action in some day of bitterness. There are wells in the heart,\r\nwhose crystal waters lie in darkness till some earthquake shakes the\r\nman's nature to its centre, bursts the fountain open, and lets the\r\ncooling waters out to refresh a parched land. There are seeds of noblest\r\nfruits that lie latent in the soul, till some storm of sorrow shakes\r\ndown tears to moisten, and some burning sun of scorching pain sends heat\r\nto warm them into a harvest of blessings.\r\n\r\nBy trouble met and patiently mastered, by suffering endured and\r\nconquered, by trials tested and overcome, so only does a man's soul grow\r\nto manliness.\r\n\r\nNow a nation is made up of single men. The law holds for the mass as for\r\nthe individuals. It took a thousand years of toil, and war, and\r\nsuffering, to make the Europe that we have. It took a thousand years of\r\nwrestle for the very life itself, to build Rome before. To be sure, we\r\ninherited all that this past of agony had bought the world. For us Rome\r\nhad lived, fought, toiled, and fallen. For us Celt, Saxon, Norman had\r\nwrought and striven. We started with the accumulated capital of a\r\nhundred generations. It was perhaps natural to suppose we might escape\r\nthe hard necessity of our fathers. We might surely profit by their\r\ndear-bought experience. The wrecks, strewn along the shores, would be\r\neffectual warnings to our gallant vessel on the dangerous seas where\r\nthey had sailed. In peace, plenty, and prosperity, we might be carried\r\nto the highest reach of national greatness.\r\n\r\nNay! never, unless we give the lie to all the world's experience! There\r\nnever was a great nation yet nursed on pap, and swathed in silk. Storms\r\nbroke around its rude cradle instead. The tempests rocked the stalwart\r\nchild. The dragons came to strangle the baby Hercules in his swaddling\r\nclothes. The magnificent commerce, the increasing manufactures, the\r\nteeming soil, the wealth fast accumulating, they would never have made\r\nus, after all, a great people. They would have eaten the manhood out of\r\nus at last. We were becoming selfish, self-indulgent, sybaritic rapidly.\r\nThe nation's muscle was softening, its heart was hardening. If we were\r\nto become a great nation, we needed more than commerce, more than\r\nplenty, more than rapid riches, more than a comfortable, indulgent life.\r\nIf we were to be one of the world's great peoples, a people to dig deep\r\nand build strong, a people whose name and fame the world was to accept\r\nas a part of itself, we must look to pay the price inflexibly demanded\r\nat every people's hand, and count it out in sweat drops, tear drops,\r\nblood drops, to the last unit.\r\n\r\nWe have been patiently counting out this costly currency for three slow\r\nyears. I pity the moral outlook of the man who does not see that we have\r\nreceived largely of our purchase.\r\n\r\nFrom a nation whom the world believed, and whom itself believed, to be\r\nsunk in hopeless mammon worship, we have risen to be a nation that pours\r\nout its wealth like water for a noble purpose. Never again will 'the\r\nalmighty dollar' be called America's divinity. We were sinking fast to\r\nlow aims and selfish purposes, and wise men groaned at national\r\ndegeneracy. The summons came, and millions leaped to offer all they had,\r\nto fling fortune, limb, and life on the altar of an unselfish cause. The\r\ndead manhood of the nation sprang to life at the call. We proved the\r\nredness of the old faithful, manly blood, to be as bright as ever.\r\n\r\nI know we hear men talk of the demoralization produced by war. There is\r\na great deal they can say eloquently on that side. Drunkenness,\r\nlicentiousness, lawlessness, they say are produced by it, already to an\r\nextent fearful to consider. And scoundrels are using the land's\r\nnecessities for their own selfish purposes, and fattening on its blood.\r\nThese things are all true, and a great deal more of the same sort\r\nbeside. And it may be well at times, with good purpose, to consider\r\nthem. But it is not well to consider them alone, and speak of them as\r\nthe only moral results of the war. No! by the ten thousands who have\r\ndied for the grand idea of National Unity, by the unselfish heroes who\r\nhave thrown themselves, a living wall, before the parricidal hands of\r\ntraitors, who have perished that the land they loved beyond life might\r\nnot perish, by the example and the memory they have left in ten thousand\r\nhomes, which their death has consecrated for the nation's reverence by\r\n_their_ lives and deaths, we protest against the one-sided view that\r\nlooks only on the moral _evil_ of the struggle!\r\n\r\nThe truth is, there are war vices and war virtues. There are peace vices\r\nand there are peace virtues. Decorous quiet, orderly habits, sober\r\nconduct, attention to business, these are the good things demanded by\r\nsociety in peace. And they may consist with meanness, selfishness,\r\ncowardice, and utter unmanliness. The round-stomached, prosperous man,\r\nwith his ships, shops, and factories, is very anxious for the\r\ncultivation of these virtues. He does not like to be disturbed o'\r\nnights. He wants his street to be quiet and orderly. He wants to be left\r\nundisturbed to prosecute his prosperous business. He measures virtue by\r\nthe aid it offers for that end. Peace vices, the cankers that gnaw a\r\nnation's heart, greed, self-seeking luxury, epicurean self-indulgence,\r\nhardness to growing ignorance, want, and suffering, indifference to all\r\nhigh purposes, spiritual _coma_ and deadness, these do not disturb him.\r\nThey are rotting the nation to its marrow, but they do not stand in the\r\nway of his money-getting. He never thinks of them as evils at all. To be\r\nsure, sometimes, across his torpid brain and heart may echo some harsh\r\nexpressions, from those stern old Hebrew prophets, about these things.\r\nBut he has a very comfortable pew, in a very soporific church, and he is\r\nonly half awake, and the echo dies away and leaves no sign. _He_ is just\r\nthe man to tell us all about the demoralization of war.\r\n\r\nNow quietness and good order, sober, discreet, self-seeking, decorous\r\nepicureanism and the rest, are not precisely the virtues that will save\r\na people. There are certain old foundation virtues of another kind,\r\nwhich are the only safe substratum for national or personal salvation.\r\nThese are courage--hard, muscular, manly courage--fortitude, patience,\r\nobedience to discipline, self-denial, self-sacrifice, veracity of\r\npurpose, and such like. These rough old virtues must lie at the base of\r\nall right character. You may add, as ornaments to your edifice, as\r\nfrieze, cornices, and capitals to the pillars, refinements, and\r\ncourtesies, and gentleness, and so on. But the foundation must rest on\r\nthe rude granite blocks we have mentioned, or your gingerbread erection\r\nwill go down in the first storm.\r\n\r\nAnd the simple fact is that peace has a tendency to eat out just these\r\nfoundation virtues. They are _war_ virtues; just the things called out\r\nby a life-and-death battle for some good cause. In these virtues we\r\nclaim the land has grown. The national character has deepened and\r\nintensified in these. We have strengthened anew these rocky foundations\r\nof a nation's greatness. Men lapped in luxury have patiently bowed to\r\ntoil and weariness. Men living in self-indulgence have shaken off their\r\nsloth, and roused the old slumbering fearlessness of their race. Men,\r\nliving for selfish ends, have been penetrated by the light of a great\r\npurpose, and have risen to the loftiness of human duty. Men, who shrank\r\nfrom pain as the sorest evil, have voluntarily accepted pain, and borne\r\nit with a fortitude we once believed lost from among mankind; and, over\r\nall, the flaming light of a worthy cause that men might worthily live\r\nfor and worthily die for, has led the thousands of the land out of their\r\nnarrow lives, and low endeavors, to the clear mountain heights of\r\nsacrifice! We stand now, a courageous, patient, steadfast, unselfish\r\npeople before all the world. We stand, a people that has taken its life\r\nin its hand for a purely unselfish cause. We have won our place in the\r\nforemost rank of nations, not on our wealth, our numbers, or our\r\nprosperity, but on the truer test of our manhood, truth, and\r\nsteadfastness. We stand justified at the bar of our own conscience, for\r\nnational pride and self-reliance, as we shall infallibly be justified at\r\nthe bar of the world.\r\n\r\nIs this lifting up of a great people nothing? Is this placing of twenty\r\nmillions on the clear ground of unselfish duty, as life's motive,\r\nnothing? Is there one of us, to-day, who is not prouder of his nation\r\nand its character, in the midst of its desperate tug for life, than he\r\never was in the day of its envied prosperity? And when he considers how\r\nthe nation has answered to its hard necessity, how it has borne itself\r\nin its sore trial, is he not clear of all doubt about its vitality and\r\ncontinuance? And is that, also, nothing?\r\n\r\nBut besides this education in the stern, rude, heroic virtues that prop\r\na people's life, there has been an education in some others, which,\r\nthough apparently opposed, are really kindred. Unselfish courage is\r\nnoble, but always with the highest courage there lives a great pity and\r\ntenderness. The brave man is always soft hearted. The most courageous\r\npeople are the tenderest people. The highest manhood dwells with the\r\nhighest womanhood.\r\n\r\nSo the heart of the nation has been touched and softened, while its\r\nmuscles have been steeled. While it has grasped the sword, it has\r\ngrasped it weeping in infinite pity. It has recognized the truth of\r\nhuman brotherhood as it never did before. All ranks have been drawn\r\ntogether in mutual sympathy. All barriers, that hedge brethren apart,\r\nhave been broken down in the common suffering.\r\n\r\nNews comes, to-day, that a great battle has been fought, and wounded\r\nthousands of our brothers need aid and care. You tell the news in any\r\ncity or hamlet in the land, and hands are opened, purses emptied, stores\r\nransacked for comforts for the suffering, and gentle women, in\r\nhundreds, are ready to tend them as they would their own. Is this no\r\ngain? Is it nothing that the selfishness of us all has been broken up as\r\nby an earthquake, and that kindness, charity, and pity to the sick and\r\nneedy have become the law of our lives? Count the millions that have\r\nstreamed forth from a people whose heart has been touched by a common\r\nsuffering, in kindness to wounded and sick soldiers and to their needy\r\nfamilies! Benevolence has become the atmosphere of the land.\r\n\r\nFour years ago we could not have believed it. That the voluntary charity\r\nof Americans would count by millions yearly, would flow out in a steady,\r\ndeep, increasing tide, that giving would be the rule, free, glad giving,\r\nand refusing the marked exception, the world would not have believed it,\r\n_we_ would not have believed it ourselves. Is this nothing?\r\n\r\nWe will think more of each other also for all this. We will love and\r\nhonor each other better. Under the awful pressure of the Hand that lies\r\nupon us so heavily, we are brought into closer knowledge and closer\r\nsympathy. The blows of battle are welding us into one. Fragments of all\r\npeople, and all races, cast here by the waves, and strangers to each\r\nother, with a hundred repulsions and separations, even to language,\r\nreligions, and morals, the furnace heat of our trial is fusing all parts\r\ninto one strong, united whole. We are driven and drawn together by the\r\nsore need that is upon us, and as Americans are forgetting all else. The\r\ncivil war is making us _a people_--the American People. We are no longer\r\n'the loose sweepings of all lands,' as they called us. We are one, now,\r\nbrethren all in the sacrament of a great sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd is this nothing?\r\n\r\nAnd these goods and gains are permanent. They do not belong to this\r\ngeneration only, or to this time exclusively. After all, the nation is\r\nmainly an educator. These things remain, as parts of its moral influence\r\nin moulding and training. And here is their infinite value.\r\nIndependence, courage, patience, fortitude, nobleness, self-sacrifice,\r\nand tenderness become the national ethics. These things are pressed home\r\non all growing minds. Coming generations are to be educated in these, by\r\nthe example of the present. We are stamping these things, as the\r\nessentials of the national character, on the ages to come.\r\n\r\nA thousand years of prosperity will have no power of this kind. What is\r\nthere in Chinese history to elevate a Chinaman? What high, heroic\r\nexperience to educate him, in her long centuries of ignoble peace? The\r\ntraining power of a nation is acquired always in the crises of its\r\nhistory. In the day when it rises to fight for its life, the typal men,\r\nwho give it the lasting models of its excellence, spring forth too for\r\nrecognition. The examples of these days of our own crisis will remain\r\nforever to influence the children of our people. We may be thankful, in\r\nour deepest sorrow, that we are leaving them no example of cowardice or\r\nmeanness, that we give them a record to read of the courage, endurance,\r\nand manliness of the men that begat them, that the stamp of national\r\ncharacter we leave to teach them is one of which a brave, free people\r\nneed never be ashamed, that, in the troubles they may be called to face,\r\nwe leave them, as the national and tried cure for _all_ troubles, the\r\nbold, true heart, the willing hand, the strong arm, and faith in the\r\nLord of Hosts. Shiloh, Stone River, Gettysburg, and the Wilderness, and\r\na hundred others, are the heroic names that will educate our\r\ngrandchildren, as Bunker Hill, Yorktown, and Saratoga have educated\r\nourselves. Who will say that a heritage of heroism and truth and loyalty\r\nlike this, to leave to the land we love, is nothing? Who can count the\r\nprice that will sum its value?\r\n\r\nHere, at least, are some of the gains of our civil war. We seek not to\r\npenetrate the councils of the Omniscient, or guess His purposes, though\r\nwe may humbly hope there are vaster things than these in store for\r\nhumanity and the world as the results of the struggle. Believing that He\r\ngoverns still, that He reigns on the James, as He reigned on the Jordan,\r\nthat _He_ decides the end, and not President Lincoln or Jefferson Davis,\r\nand not General Grant or General Lee, we have firm faith that this awful\r\nstruggle is no brute fight of beasts or ruffians, but a grand world's\r\nwar of heroes. We believe He will justify His government in the end, and\r\nmake this struggle praise Him, in the blessed days that are to come. But\r\nwe leave all those dim results unguessed at, as we leave the purposes of\r\nthe war itself unmentioned, and the ends which justify us in fighting\r\non. Men, by this time, have made up their minds, once for all, on these\r\nlast points. The nation has chosen, and in its own conscience, let\r\nothers think as they may, accepts the responsibility cheerfully.\r\n\r\nIt is enough to indicate, as we have done, some _real_, though\r\nimmaterial, results already attained, results which, to the philosopher\r\nor thoughtful statesman, are worth a very large outlay. They do not,\r\nindeed, remove the horror of war, they do not ask us not to seek peace,\r\nthey do not dry the tears, or hide the blood of the contest, but they do\r\nshow us that war is no unmixed evil, that even honest, faithful war-work\r\nis acceptable work, and will be paid for.\r\n\r\nThey declare that, after all, war is a means of moral training, that\r\n'Carnage' may be, as the gentlest of poets wrote, 'God's daughter,' that\r\nbattles may be blessings to be thankful for in the long march of time.\r\nThey bring to our consciousness, once more, the fact that a Great\r\nBattle, amid all its horror, wrath, and blood, is something sacred\r\nstill, an earthly shadow of that Unseen Battle which has stormed through\r\ntime, between the hosts of Light and Darkness. They declare again, to\r\nthe nation, that old truth, without which the nation perishes and man\r\nrots, that to die in some good cause is the noblest thing a man can do\r\non earth. They bid us bend in hope beneath the awful hand of the GOD OF\r\nBATTLES, and do our appointed work patiently, bravely, loyally, till\r\n_He_ brings the end. They tell us that not work only, but heroic\r\nfighting, also, is a worship accepted at His seat. They bid us be\r\nthankful, as for the most sacred of all gifts, that thousands, in this\r\nloyal land of ours, have had the high grace, given from above,\r\n\r\n  'To search through all they felt and saw,\r\n  The springs of life, the depths of awe,\r\n  And reach _the law within the law_:\r\n\r\n  'To pass, when Life her light withdraws,\r\n  Not void of righteous self-applause,\r\n  Nor in a merely selfish cause--\r\n\r\n  'In some good cause, not in their own,\r\n  To perish, _wept for_, _honored_, _known_,\r\n  And like a warrior overthrown.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVERBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nViolets and lilies-of-the-valley are seen in a vale.\r\n\r\nFamily jars should be filled with honey.\r\n\r\nAll are not lambs that gambol on the green.\r\n\r\nAsk the 'whys,' and be wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDIVINE COMEDY--A POLISH DRAMA.\r\n\r\nDedicated to Mary.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n  'Du Gemisch von Koth und Feuer!'\r\n  'Thou compound of clay and fire!'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, O child! art thou not, like other children, riding gayly about on\r\nsticks for horses, playing with toys, torturing flies, or impaling\r\nbutterflies on pins, that the brilliant circles of their dying pangs may\r\namuse thy young soul? Why dost thou never romp and sport upon the grassy\r\nturf, pilfer sugarplums and sweetmeats, and wet the letters of thy\r\npicture book from A to Z with sudden tears?\r\n\r\nInfant king of flies, moths, and grasshoppers; of cowslips, daisies, and\r\nof kingcups; of tops, hoops, and kites; little friend of Punch and\r\npuppets; robber of birds' nests, and outlaw of petty mischiefs--son of\r\nthe poet, tell me, why art thou so unlike a child--so like an angel?\r\n\r\nWhat strange meaning lies in the blue depths of thy dreamy eyes? Why do\r\nthey seek the ground as if weighed down by the shadows of their drooping\r\nlashes; and why is their latent fire so gloomed by mournful memories,\r\nalthough they have only watched the early violets of a few springs? Why\r\nsinks thy broad head heavily down upon thy tiny hands, while thy pallid\r\ntemples bend under the weight of thine infant thoughts, like snowdrops\r\nburdened with the dew of night?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd when thy pale cheek floods with sudden crimson, and, tossing back\r\nthy golden curls, thou gazest sadly into the depths of the sky--tell me,\r\ninfant, what seest thou there, and with whom holdest thou communion? For\r\nthen the light and subtile wrinkles weave their living mesh across thy\r\nspotless brow, like silken threads untwining by an unseen power from\r\nviewless coils, and thine eyes sparkle, freighted with mystic meanings,\r\nwhich none are able to interpret! Then thy grandam calls in vain,\r\n'George, George!' and weeps, for thou heedest her not, and she fears\r\nthou dost not love her! Friends and relations then appeal to thee in\r\nvain, for thou seemest not to hear or know them! Thy father is silent\r\nand looks sad; tears fill his anxious eyes, falling coldly back into his\r\ntroubled heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe physician comes, puts his finger on thy pulse, counts its changeful\r\nbeats, and says thy nerves are out of order.\r\n\r\nThy old godfather brings thee sugarplums, strokes thy pale cheeks, and\r\ntells thee thou must be a statesman in thy native land.\r\n\r\nThe professor passes his hand over thy broad brow, and declares thou\r\nwill have talent for the abstract sciences.\r\n\r\nThe beggar, whom thou never passest without casting a coin in his\r\ntattered hat, promises thee a beautiful wife, and a heavenly crown.\r\n\r\nThe soldier, raising thee high in the air, declares thou wilt yet be a\r\ngreat general.\r\n\r\nThe wandering gypsy looks into thy tender face, traces the lines upon\r\nthy little hand, but will not tell their hidden meaning; she gazes sadly\r\non thee, and then sighing turns away; she says nothing, and refuses to\r\ntake the proffered coin.\r\n\r\nThe magnetizer makes his passes over thee, presses his fingers on thine\r\neyes, and circles thy face, but mutters suddenly an oath, for he is\r\nhimself growing sleepy; he feels like kneeling down before thee, as\r\nbefore a holy image. Then thou growest angry, and stampest with thy tiny\r\nfeet; and when thy father comes, thou seemest to him a little Lucifer;\r\nand in his picture of the Day of Judgment, he paints thee thus among the\r\ninfant demons, the young spirits of evil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile thou growest apace, becoming ever more and more beautiful, not\r\nin the childish beauty of rose bloom and snow, but in the loveliness of\r\nwondrous and mysterious thoughts, which flow to thee from other worlds;\r\nand though thy languid eyes droop wearily their fringes, though thy\r\ncheek is pale, and thy breast bent and contracted, yet all who meet thee\r\nstop to gaze, exclaiming: '_What a little angel!_'\r\n\r\nIf the dying flowers had a living soul inspired from heaven; if, in\r\nplace of dewdrops, each drooping leaf were bent to earth with the\r\nthought of an angel, such flowers would resemble thee, fair child!\r\n\r\nAnd thus, before the fall, they may, perchance, have bloomed in\r\nParadise!\r\n\r\n     A graveyard. The Man and George are seen sitting by a grave, over\r\n     which stands a gothic monument, with arches, pillars, and mimic\r\n     towers.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Take off thy hat, George, kneel, and pray for thy mother's\r\nsoul!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Hail, Mary, full of grace! Mary, Queen of Heaven, Lady of all\r\nthat blooms on earth, that scents the fields, that paints the fringes of\r\nthe streams ...\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Why changest thou the words of the prayer? Pray for thy mother\r\nas thou hast been taught to do; for thy dear mother, George, who\r\nperished in her youth, just ten years ago this very day and hour.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee! I know that\r\nthou art blessed among the angels, and as thou glidest softly through\r\nthem, each one plucks a rainbow from his wings to cast under thy feet,\r\nand thou floatest softly on upon them as if borne by waves....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. George!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Be not angry with me, father! these words _force_ themselves\r\ninto my mind; they pain me so dreadfully in my head, that I must say\r\nthem....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Rise, George. Such prayers will never reach God!\r\n\r\nThou art not thinking of thy mother; thou dost not love her!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I love her. I see mamma very often.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Where, my son?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. In dreams--yet not exactly in dreams, but just as I am going to\r\nsleep. I saw her yesterday.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What do you mean, George?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. She looked so pale and thin!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Has she ever spoken to you, darling?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. She goes wandering up and down--through an immense Dark--she\r\nroams about entirely alone, so white and so pale! She sang to me\r\nyesterday. I will tell thee the words of her song:\r\n\r\n    'I wander through the universe,\r\n      I search through infinite space,\r\n    I press through Chaos, Darkness,\r\n      To bring thee light and grace;\r\n    I listen to the angels' song\r\n      To catch the heavenly tone;\r\n    Seek every form of beauty,\r\n      To bring to thee, mine own!\r\n\r\n    'I seek from greatest spirits,\r\n      From those of lower might,\r\n    Rainbow colors, depth of shadow,\r\n      Burning contrasts, dark and bright;\r\n    Rhythmed music, hues from Eden,\r\n      Floating through the heavenly bars;\r\n    Sages' wisdom, seraphs' loving,\r\n      Mystic glories from the stars--\r\n  That thou mayst be a Poet, richly gifted from above\r\n  To win thy father's fiery heart, and _keep_ his _changeful love_!'\r\n\r\nThou seest, dear father, that my mother does speak to me, and that I\r\nremember, word for word, what she says to me; indeed I am telling you\r\nno lie.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_leaning against one of the pillars of the tomb_). Mary! wilt\r\nthou destroy thine own son, and burden my Soul with the ruin of both?...\r\n\r\nBut what folly! She is calm and tranquil now in heaven, as she was pure\r\nand sweet on earth. My poor boy only dreams ...\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I hear mamma's voice now, father!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. From whence comes it, my son?\r\n\r\nGEORGE.

I've sought since the day of thy birth\r\n\r\n    To waken thy spirit,\r\n      My darling, my own,\r\n    That the hopes of thy father\r\n      May rest on his son!\r\n    That his love, warm and glowing,\r\n      Unchanging may shine;\r\n    And his heart, infant poet,\r\n      _Forever be thine!_'\r\n\r\nTHE MAN.

Suffer me to love my son in peace, that thus\r\nreconciliation may be planted between the created and the Creator!...\r\n\r\nCross thyself now, my son, and come with me.\r\n\r\nEternal rest be with the dead!\r\n\r\n     Exit with George\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A public square.

And as a change so great in the constitution of society,\r\nboth in general and particular, stands so immediately before us, I\r\ndeduce from such a revolution the complete destruction of old forms and\r\nformulas, and the regeneration of the whole human family.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Do you really think so?\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHE. Just as our earth, by a sudden change in the inclination of\r\nits axis, might rotate more obliquely ...\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Do you see this hollow tree?\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHE. With tufts of new leaves sprouting forth from the lower\r\nbranches?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Yes. How much longer do you think it can continue to stand?\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHE. I cannot tell; perhaps a year or two longer.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Its roots are rapidly rotting out, and yet it still puts forth\r\na few green leaves.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHE. What inference do you deduce from that?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Nothing--only that it is rotting out in spite of its few green\r\nleaves; falling daily into dust and ashes; and that it will not bear the\r\ntool of the moulder!\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is your type, the type of your followers, of your theories,\r\nof the times in which we live....\r\n\r\n     They pass on out of sight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A mountain pass.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN.

Two\r\ndim forebodings alone stir in the desert of my soul--the one, that my\r\nson is hopelessly blind; the other, that the society in which I have\r\ngrown up is in the pangs of dissolution; I suffer as God enjoys, in\r\nmyself only, and for myself alone....\r\n\r\nVOICE OF THE GUARDIAN ANGEL. Love the sick, the hungry, the wretched!\r\nLove thy neighbor, thy poor neighbor, as thyself, and thou shalt be\r\nredeemed!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Who speaks?\r\n\r\nMEPHISTOPHILES. Your humble servant. I often astonish travellers by my\r\nmarvellous natural gifts: I am a ventriloquist.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I have certainly seen a face like that before in an engraving.\r\n\r\nMEPHISTOPHILES (_aside_).

Thou art\r\nbut the shadow of a passing angel, flitting rapidly over the earth, and\r\nmelting into the infinite of ...\r\n\r\nHa! what an immense eagle that is fluttering just there where the\r\nstranger disappeared behind the rocks!\r\n\r\nTHE EAGLE. Hail! I greet thee! hail!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. He is as black as night; he flies nearer; the whirring of his\r\nvast wings stirs me like the whistling hail of bullets in the fight.\r\n\r\nTHE EAGLE. Draw the sword of thy fathers, and combat for their power,\r\ntheir fame!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. His wide wings spread above me; he gazes into my eyes with the\r\ncharm of the rattlesnake--Ha! I understand thee!\r\n\r\nTHE EAGLE. Despair not! Yield not now, nor ever! Thy enemies, thy\r\nmiserable enemies, will fall to dust before thee!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Going?... Farewell, then, among the rocks, behind which thou\r\nvanishest!... Whatever thou mayst be, delusion or truth, victory or\r\nruin, I trust in thee, herald of fame, harbinger of glory!\r\n\r\nSpirit of the mighty Past, come to my aid! and even if thou hast already\r\nreturned to the bosom of God, quit it--and come to me! Inspire me with\r\nthe ancient heroism! Become in me, force, thought, action!\r\n\r\n     Stooping to the ground, he turns up and throws aside a viper.\r\n\r\nCurses upon thee, loathsome reptile! Even as thou diest, crushed and\r\nwrithing, and nature breathes no sigh for thy fate, so will the\r\ndestroyers of the Past perish in the abyss of nothingness, leaving no\r\ntrace, and awakening no regret.\r\n\r\nNone of the countless clouds of heaven will pause one moment in their\r\nflight to look upon the thronging hosts of men now gathering to kill and\r\nslaughter!\r\n\r\nFirst they--then I--\r\n\r\nBoundless vault of blue, so softly pouring round the earth! the earth is\r\na sick child, gnashing her teeth, weeping, struggling, sobbing; but thou\r\nhearest her not, nor tremblest, flowing in silence ever gently on, calm\r\nin thine own infinity!\r\n\r\nFarewell forever, O mother nature! Henceforth I must wander among men! I\r\nmust combat with my brethren!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A chamber. The Man. George. A Physician.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. No one has as yet been of the least service to him; my last\r\nhopes are placed in you.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. You do me much honor.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Tell me your opinion of the case.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I can neither see you, my father, nor the gentleman to whom you\r\nspeak. Dark or black webs float before my eyes, and again something like\r\na snake seems to crawl across them. Sometimes a golden cloud stands\r\nbefore them, flies up, and then falls down upon them, and a rainbow\r\nsprings out of it; but there is no pain--they never hurt me--I do not\r\nsuffer, father.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. Come here, George, in the shade. How old are you?\r\n\r\n     He looks steadily into the eyes of the boy.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. He is fourteen years old.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. Now turn your eyes directly to the light, to the window.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What do you say, doctor?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. The eyelids are beautifully formed, the white perfectly pure,\r\nthe blue deep, the veins in good order, the muscles strong.\r\n\r\n     To George.\r\n\r\nYou may laugh at all this, George. You will be perfectly well; as well\r\nas I am.\r\n\r\n     To the Man (aside).\r\n\r\nThere is no hope. Look at the pupils yourself, count; there is not the\r\nleast susceptibility to the light; there is a paralysis of the optic\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Everything looks to me as if covered with black clouds.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Yes, they are open, blue, lifeless, dead!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. When I shut my eyelids I can see _more_ than when my eyes are\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. His mind is precocious; it is rapidly consuming his body. We\r\nmust guard him against an attack of catalepsy.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_leading the doctor aside_). Save him, doctor, and the half of\r\nmy estate is yours!\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. A disorganization cannot be reorganized.\r\n\r\n     He takes up his hat and cane.\r\n\r\nPardon me, count, but I can remain here no longer; I am forced now to\r\nvisit a patient whom I am to couch for cataract.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. For God's sake, do not desert us!\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. Perhaps you have some curiosity to know the name of this\r\nmalady?...\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Speak! is there no hope?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. It is called, from the Greek, _amaurosis_.\r\n\r\n     Exit Physician.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_pressing his son to his heart_). But you can still see a\r\nlittle, George?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I can _hear your voice_, father!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Try if you can see. Look out of the window; the sun is shining\r\nbrightly, the sky is clear.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I see crowds of forms circling between the pupils of my eyes and\r\nmy eyelids--faces I have often seen before, the leaves of books I have\r\nread before....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Then you really do still see?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Yes, with the _eyes of my spirit--but the eyes of my body have\r\ngone out forever_.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_falls on his knees as if to pray; pauses, and exclaims\r\nbitterly_:) Before _whom_ shall I kneel--to whom pray--to whom complain\r\nof the unjust doom crushing my innocent child?\r\n\r\n     He rises from his knees.\r\n\r\nIt is best to bear all in silence--God laughs at our prayers--Satan\r\nmocks at our curses--\r\n\r\nA VOICE. But thy son is a Poet--and what wouldst thou more?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Physician and Godfather.\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. It is certainly a great misfortune to be blind.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. And at his age a very unusual one.\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. His frame was always very fragile, and his mother died\r\nsomewhat--so--so ...\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. How did she die?\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. A little so ... you understand ... not quite in her right\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_entering_). I pray you, pardon my intrusion at so late an\r\nhour, but for the last night or two my son has wakened up at twelve\r\no'clock, left his bed, and talked in his sleep.\r\n\r\nWill you have the kindness to follow me, and watch him to-night?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. I will go to him immediately; I am very much interested in\r\nthe observation of such phenomena.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Relations, Godfather, Physician, the Man, a Nurse--assembled in the\r\n     sleeping apartment of George Stanislaus.\r\n\r\nFIRST RELATION. Hush! hush! be quiet!\r\n\r\nSECOND RELATION. He is awake, but neither sees nor hears us.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. I beg that you will all remain perfectly silent.\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. This seems to be a most extraordinary malady.\r\n\r\nGEORGE (_rising from his seat_). God! O God!\r\n\r\nFIRST RELATION. How lightly he treads!\r\n\r\nSECOND RELATION. Look! he clasps his thin hands across his breast.\r\n\r\nTHIRD RELATION. His eyelids are motionless; he does not move his lips,\r\nbut what a sharp and thrilling shriek!\r\n\r\nNURSE. Christ, shield him!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Depart from me, Darkness! I am a child of light and song, and\r\nwhat hast thou to do with me? What dost thou desire from me?\r\n\r\nI do not yield myself to thee, although my sight has flown away upon the\r\nwings of the wind, and is flitting restlessly about through infinite\r\nspace: it will return to me--my eyes will open with a flash of\r\nflame--and I will see the universe!\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. He talks exactly as his mother did; he does not know what he\r\nis saying, I think his condition very critical.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. He is in great danger.\r\n\r\nNURSE. Holy Mother of God! take my eyes, and give them to the poor boy!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. My mother, I entreat thee! O mother, send me thoughts and\r\nimages, that I may create within myself a world like the one I have lost\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nFIRST RELATION. Do you think, brother, it will be necessary to call a\r\nfamily consultation?\r\n\r\nSECOND RELATION. Be silent!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Thou answerest me not, my mother!\r\n\r\nO mother, do not desert me!\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN (_to the Man_). It is my duty to tell you the truth.\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. Yes, to tell the truth is the duty and virtue of a physician!\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. Your son is suffering from incipient insanity, connected with\r\nan extraordinary excitability of the nervous system, which sometimes\r\noccasions, if I may so express myself, the strange phenomenon of\r\nsleeping and waking at the same time, as in the case now before us.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_aside_). He reads to me thy sentence, O my God!\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN. Give me pen, ink, and paper.\r\n\r\n     He writes a prescription.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I think it best you should all now retire; George needs rest.\r\n\r\nSEVERAL VOICES. Good night! good night! good night!\r\n\r\nGEORGE (_waking suddenly_). Are they wishing me good night, father?\r\n\r\nThey should rather speak of a long, unbroken, eternal night, but of no\r\ngood one, of no happy dawn for me....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Lean on me, George. Let me support you to the bed.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. What does all this mean, father?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Cover yourself up, and go quietly to sleep. The doctor says you\r\nwill regain your sight.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I feel so very unwell, father; strange voices roused me from my\r\nsleep, and I saw mamma standing in a field of lilies....\r\n\r\n     He falls asleep.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Bless thee! bless thee, my poor boy!\r\n\r\nI can give thee nothing but a blessing; neither happiness, nor light,\r\nnor fame are in my gift. The stormy hour of struggle approaches, when I\r\nmust combat with the _few_ against the _many_.\r\n\r\nTortured infant! what is then to become of thee, alone, helpless, blind,\r\nsurrounded by a thousand dangers? Child, yet Poet, poor Singer without a\r\nhearer, with thy soul in heaven, and thy frail, suffering body still\r\nfettered to the earth--what is to be thy doom? Alas, miserable infant!\r\nthou most unfortunate of all the angels! my son! my son!\r\n\r\n     He buries his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nNURSE (_knocking at the door_). The doctor desires to see his excellency\r\nas soon as convenient.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN.

The reader will be reminded by it of Mrs. Browning's\r\n'Forced Recruit at Solferino.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOES THE MOON REVOLVE ON ITS AXIS?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this question has elicited considerable discussion, at various times,\r\nthe following may be considered in elucidation.\r\n\r\nA revolution on an axis is simply that of a body turning entirely round\r\nupon its own centre. The only centre around which the moon performs a\r\nrevolution is very far from its own proper axis, being situated at the\r\ncentre of the earth, the focus of its orbit, and as it has no other\r\nrotating motion around the earth, it cannot revolve on its own central\r\naxis.\r\n\r\nA body fixed in position, or pierced and held by a rod, cannot revolve\r\nupon its centre, and when swung round by this rod or handle, performs\r\nonly a revolution in orbit, as does the moon. The moon, during the\r\nprocess of forming a solid crust, by the constant attraction of the\r\nearth upon one side, only, became elongated, by calculation, about\r\nthirty miles (from its centre as a round body) toward the earth;\r\nconsequently, by its form, like the body pierced with a rod, is\r\ntransfixed by its gravitation, and, therefore, cannot revolve upon its\r\nown central axis.\r\n\r\nThe difference of axial revolution of a wheel or globe, is simply that\r\nthe former turns upon an actual and the latter upon an imaginary axle,\r\nplaced at its centre, Now, by way of analogy, fasten, immovably, a ball\r\nupon the rim of a revolving wheel, and then judge whether the ball can\r\nperform one simultaneous revolution on its own axis, in the same time\r\nthat it performs a revolution in orbit, made by one complete turn of the\r\nwheel; and if not (which is assuredly the case, for it is fixed\r\nimmovably), then neither can the moon perform such revolution on its\r\naxis, in the same time that it makes one revolution in orbit; because,\r\nlike the ball immovably fixed upon the rim of the wheel, it, too, is\r\ntransfixed by gravitation, from its very form, as if pierced with a rod,\r\nwhose other extremity is attached to the centre of the earth, its only\r\nproper focus of motion, and, therefore, cannot revolve upon its own\r\ncentral axis.\r\n\r\nA balloon elongated on one side, and carrying ballast on that side,\r\nwould be like the moon in form, and when suspended in air, like the\r\nmoon, too, in having its heaviest matter always toward the centre of the\r\nearth. Now let this balloon go entirely round the earth: it will, like\r\nthe moon, continue to present the weightiest, elongated side always\r\ntoward the centre of the earth; it, consequently, like the moon, cannot\r\nrevolve upon its own central axis, as gravitation alone would prevent\r\nthis anomaly, in both cases.\r\n\r\nAs well might it be said that a horse, harnessed to a beam, and going\r\nround a ring, or an imprisoned stone swung round in a sling, make each\r\none simultaneous revolution on their axes, when their very positions are\r\na sufficient refutation! or that the balls in an orrery, attached\r\nimmovably to the ends of their respective rods, and turning with them\r\n(merely to show revolutions in orbits), perform each a simultaneous\r\nrevolution on their axis, when such claim would be simply ridiculous,\r\nsince the only revolution, in each case, has its focus outside of the\r\nball, therefore orbital only; and so, too, with the moon, whose motion\r\nis precisely analogous, and prejudice alone can retain such an\r\nunphilosophical hypothesis as its _axial_ revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNAR CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon, in consequence of its orbital revolution, having no connecting\r\naxial motion, has always presented but one side to the earth, so that in\r\nprocess of forming a crust, from its incipient molten state, it became,\r\nby the constant attraction of the earth upon one side, elongated toward\r\nour globe, now generally admitted to be by calculation about thirty\r\nmiles, and proved by photographs, which also show an elongation. The\r\nnecessary consequence of this constant attraction upon one side, has\r\nbeen not only to intensify volcanic action there, by the continued\r\neffect of gravitation, so long as its interior remained in a molten\r\nstate, but from the same reasoning, to confine all such volcanic action\r\nexclusively to this side of the moon. Thus we have the reason for the\r\nviolently disrupted state which that luminary presents to the telescopic\r\nobserver, exceeding any analogy to be found upon our globe, as the\r\nearth's axial motion has prevented any similar concentrated action upon\r\nany particular part of its surface, either from solar or lunar\r\nattraction. Another marked effect of the elongation of the moon toward\r\nthe earth has been to elevate its visible side high above its atmosphere\r\n(which would have enveloped it as a round body), and in consequence into\r\nan intensely cold region, producing congelation, in the form of frost\r\nand snow, which necessarily envelop its entire visible surface. These\r\neffects took place while yet the crust was thin and frequently disrupted\r\nby volcanic action, and wherever such action took place, the fiery\r\nmatter ejected necessarily dissolved the contiguous masses of frost and\r\nsnow, and these floods of water, as soon as they receded from the fiery\r\nelement, were immediately converted into lengthened ridges of ice,\r\ndiverging from the mountain summits like streams of lava. Hence many of\r\nthe apparent lava streams are but ridges of ice, and in consequence,\r\ndepending upon the angle of reflection (determined by the age of the\r\nmoon, which is but its relative position between the sun and earth), all\r\nobservers are struck with the brilliancy of the reflected light from\r\nmany of those long lines of ridges.\r\n\r\nThe general surface of the moon presents to the telescopic observer just\r\nthat drear, cold, and chalk-like aspect, which our snow-clad mountains\r\nexhibit when the angle of reflection is similar to that in which we\r\nbehold the lunar surface. In consequence, its mild light is due to the\r\nmyriads of sparkling crystals, which diffusively reflect the rays of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAs an attentive observer of the moon, I have been much puzzled to know\r\nwhy none of the hosts of observers, or scientific treatises, have taken\r\nthis rational view of such necessary condition of the moon, deduced from\r\nthe main facts of its original formation, here named and generally\r\nconceded. In the place of which, we still have stereotyped, in many late\r\neditions on astronomy, the names and localities of numerous seas and\r\nlakes, which advancing knowledge should long since have discarded.\r\n\r\nBesides the above conclusions, which necessitate a snowy covering to the\r\nmoon, none of the planets exhibit that drear white, except the poles of\r\nMars, which are admitted to be snow by all astronomers, as we see them\r\ncome and go with the appropriate seasons of that planet; whereas the\r\ncontinents of Mars appear dark, as analogously they do upon our earth,\r\nunder the same solar effulgence. The analogy of sunlight, when reflected\r\nfrom our lofty mountains (at say thirty or forty miles distant) not\r\ncovered with snow, viewed under the most favorable circumstances of\r\nbrilliant light and the best angle of reflection, with no more of\r\nintervening atmosphere, always present sombre tints; whether viewed with\r\nthe unaided eye or through a telescope. Such analogy clearly proves that\r\nno objects short of an absolute white could present such an appearance\r\nas light does upon lunar objects, viewed with high powers, in which the\r\nsame drear white remains, without any greater concentration of light (as\r\nwe can see objects in the moon whose diameter is five hundred feet) than\r\nis presented to our unaided eye from our own mountain masses. In viewing\r\nthe moon with high powers, there is, in fact, a much greater amount of\r\nvisible atmosphere intervening than can possibly apply in beholding\r\nobjects on our earth, at even a few miles' distance, since if we look at\r\nlunar objects with a power of one thousand times, our atmosphere is thus\r\nmagnified a thousand times also.\r\n\r\nThe main physical features of the visible half of the moon, with a good\r\ntelescopic power, present an enormously elevated table land, traversed,\r\nhere and there, with slightly elevated long ridges, and the general\r\nsurface largely pitted with almost innumerable deep cusps or valleys, of\r\nevery size, from a quarter of a mile to full thirty miles in diameter;\r\ngenerally circular and surrounded with elevated ridges, some rising to\r\nlofty jagged summits above the surrounding plain. These ridges, on their\r\ninner sides, show separate terraces and mural precipices, while their\r\nouter slopes display deeply scarred ravines and long spurs at their\r\nbases. These cusps, or deep valleys, are the craters of extinct\r\nvolcanoes, and in their centres have generally one or two isolated\r\nsub-mountain peaks, occasionally with divided summits, which were the\r\ncentres of expiring volcanic action, similar to those that exist in our\r\nown volcanic regions. Besides which the Lunar Apennines, so called,\r\npresent to the eye a long range of mountains with serrated summits, on\r\none side gradually sloped, with terraces, spurs, and ravines, and the\r\nother side mostly precipitous, casting long shadows, which clearly\r\ndefine the forms of their summits--all these objects presenting the same\r\ndead white everywhere.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the farther side of the moon, which has not been subject to\r\nthe same elongating or elevating process, nor the above-named causes for\r\nvolcanic disruption, presents a climate and vegetation fitted for the\r\nabode of sentient beings. This side alone presenting an aspect of\r\nextreme desolation, far surpassing our polar regions.\r\n\r\nIt is generally stated in astronomical works, that shadows projected\r\nfrom lunar objects are intensely black, owing, it is stated, to there\r\nbeing no reflecting atmosphere; whereas in my long-continued habit of\r\nobservation, those shadows appear no more black than those on our earth,\r\nwhen they fall on contrasting snowy surfaces. The reason for which, in\r\nthe absence of a lunar atmosphere, to render light diffusive, is the\r\nbrilliant reflection from snow crystals, upon all contiguous objects,\r\nwhich lie in an angle to receive the same, and in consequence I have\r\noften observed the forms of objects not directly illuminated by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe occasional apparent retention of a star on the limb of the moon,\r\njust before or after an occultation, seen by some observers, and thus\r\nevidencing the existence of some atmosphere, is doubtless due to the\r\nslight oscillations of the moon, by which we see a trifle more than half\r\nof that body, during which the atmosphere of its opposite side slightly\r\nimpinges upon this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT PRUSSIAN POLITICS.\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the beginning of the present stage in the development of\r\nconstitutional government in Prussia. It will have been noticed that the\r\npromises of Frederick William III. were not that he would grant a\r\nstrictly popular constitution. His intention was that the different\r\nestates of the realm should be represented in the proposed national\r\ndiet, the constitution recognizing a difference in the dignity of the\r\ndifferent classes of inhabitants, and giving to each a share in the\r\nnational government proportionate to its dignity. His son, at his\r\ncoronation, promised to maintain the efficiency of the ordinances of\r\nJune 5, 1823, and to secure a further development of the principles of\r\nthis (so-called) constitution. Encouraged by this assurance, the\r\nLiberals labored to secure from him the full realization of their hopes.\r\nFrederick William IV. was just the man with whom such exertions could be\r\nused with good hope of success. He was intelligent enough to be fully\r\nconscious of the fact and the significance of the popular request for a\r\nconstitution, and, though of course personally disinclined to reduce his\r\npower to a nullity, he had yet not a strong will, and had no wish to\r\ninvolve himself in a conflict with his subjects. Accordingly, in 1841,\r\nhe convoked a diet in each province, and proposed the appointment of\r\ncommittees from the estates, who should act as counsel to the king when\r\nthe provincial diets were not in session. These diets in subsequent\r\nsessions discussed the subject of a national diet, and proposed to the\r\nking the execution of the order issued in 1815. At length, February 8,\r\n1847, he issued a royal charter, introducing, in fact, what had so often\r\nand so long before been promised, a constitution. The substance of the\r\ncharter was that, as often as the Government should need to contract a\r\nloan, or introduce new taxes, or increase existing taxes, the diets of\r\nthe provinces should be convoked to a national diet; that the committees\r\nof the provincial diets (as appointed in 1842) should be henceforth\r\nperiodically, as one body, convoked; that to the diet, and, when it was\r\nnot in session, to the committee, should be conveyed the right to have a\r\n_deciding_ voice in the above-mentioned cases. April 11, 1847, the diet\r\nassembled for the first time; January 17, 1848, the united committee of\r\nthe estates.\r\n\r\nHow long the nation would have remained contented with this concession\r\nto the request for a national representation under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, is quite uncertain. In point of fact, this constitution\r\nhardly lived long enough to be christened with the name. Early in 1848\r\nthe French Revolution startled all Europe--most of all, the monarchs.\r\nThey knew how inflammable the masses were; they soon saw that the masses\r\nwere inflamed, and that nothing but the most vigorous measures would\r\nsecure their thrones from overthrow. Frederick William Was not slow to\r\nsee the danger, and take steps to guard Prussia against an imitation of\r\nthe Parisian insurrection. On the 14th of March he issued an order\r\nsummoning the diet to meet at Berlin on the 27th of April. Four days\r\nlater he issued another edict ordering the diet to convene still\r\nearlier, on the 2d of April. This proclamation is a characteristic\r\ndocument. It was issued on the day of the Berlin revolution. It was an\r\nhour of the most critical moment. There was no time for long\r\ndeliberation, and little hope for the preservation of royalty, unless\r\nsomething decided was done at once. He might have tried the experiment\r\nof violently resisting the insurgents; but this was not in accordance\r\nwith his character. He preferred rather to resign something than to run\r\nthe risk of losing all. Accordingly he yielded. In this proclamation,\r\nafter alluding to the occasion of it, he publishes his earnest desire\r\nfor the union of Germany against the common danger. 'First of all,' he\r\nsays, 'we desire that Germany be transformed from a confederation of\r\nstates (_Staatenbund_) to one federal state (_Bundesstaat_).' He\r\nproposes a reorganization of the articles of union in which other\r\nrepresentatives besides the princes should take part; a common army;\r\nfreedom of trade; freedom of emigration from one state to another;\r\ncommon weights, measures, and coins; freedom of the press--in short, all\r\nthat the most enthusiastic advocate of German unity could have asked. At\r\nthe same time was published a law repealing the censorship of the press.\r\nOn the 21st of the same month he put forth an address, entitled 'To my\r\npeople and to the German nation.' In this, after saying that there was\r\nno security against the threatening dangers except in the closest union\r\nof the German princes and peoples, under one head, he adds: 'I assume\r\nto-day this leadership for this time of danger. My people, undismayed by\r\nthe danger, will not abandon me, and Germany will confidingly attach\r\nitself to me. I have to-day adopted the old German colors, and put\r\nmyself and my people under the venerable banner of the German Empire.\r\nHenceforth Prussia passes over into Germany.' But all this was more\r\neasily said than done. Whatever the German people may have wished, the\r\nother German rulers could not so easily overcome their jealousies. The\r\nextreme of the danger passed by, and with it this urgent demand for a\r\nunited Germany.\r\n\r\nBut the diet came together. The king laid before it the outline of a\r\nconstitution, the most important provisions of which were that there\r\nshould be guaranteed to all the right to hold meetings without first\r\nsecuring consent from the police; civil rights to all, irrespective of\r\nreligious belief; a national parliament, whose assent should be\r\nessential to the making of all laws. These propositions were approved by\r\nthe diet, which now advised the king to call together a national\r\nassembly of delegates, elected by the people, to agree with him upon a\r\nconstitution. This was done; the assembly met on the 22d of May, and was\r\nopened by the king in person. He laid before the delegates the draught\r\nof a constitution, which they referred to a committee, by whom it was\r\nelaborated, and on the 26th of July reported to the assembly. The\r\ndeliberation which followed had, by the 9th of November, resulted only\r\nin fixing the preamble and the first four articles. At this time an\r\norder came to the assembly from the king, requiring the members to\r\nadjourn to the 27th, and then come together, not at Berlin, but\r\nBrandenburg. The reason of this was that the assembly manifested too\r\nmuch of an inclination to infringe on the royal prerogatives, and that\r\nits place of meeting was surrounded by people who sought by threats,\r\nand, in some cases, by violence, to intimidate the members. The king was\r\nnow the less inclined to be, or seem to be, controlled by such\r\nterrorism, as the fury of the revolutionary storm was now spent; the\r\nmilitia had been summoned to arms; and had not hesitated to obey the\r\ncall. The troops, under the lead of Field-Marshal Wrangel, were\r\ncollected about Berlin. The majority of the National Assembly, which had\r\nrefused to obey the royal order to adjourn to Brandenburg, and was\r\nproceeding independently in the prosecution of its deliberations\r\nrespecting the constitution, was compelled, by military force, to\r\ndissolve. Part of them then went to Brandenburg, and, not succeeding in\r\ncarrying a motion to adjourn till December 4, went out in a body,\r\nleaving the assembly without a quorum. The king now thought himself\r\njustified in concluding that nothing was to be hoped from the labors of\r\nthis body, and therefore, on the 5th of December, dissolved it.\r\n\r\nSome kings, under these circumstances, might have been inclined to have\r\nnothing more to do with constitution making. If we mistake not, the\r\npresent king, with his present spirit, would have thought it right to\r\nmake the turbulent character of the convention and of the masses a\r\npretext for withholding from them the power to stamp their character on\r\nthe national institutions. Such a course might probably have been\r\npursued. The king had control of the army. The excesses of the Liberals\r\nbegan to produce a reaction. The National Assembly, during its session\r\nin Berlin, after it had been adjourned by the king, had resolved that\r\nthe royal ministry had no right to impose taxes so long as the assembly\r\nwas unable peaceably to pursue its deliberations, and designed, by\r\ngiving this resolution the form of a law, to lead the people in this\r\nmanner to break loose from the Government. This attempt to usurp\r\nauthority was doomed to be disappointed. The assembly, having\r\noverstepped its prerogatives, lost its influence. The king found himself\r\nagain in possession of the reins of power. It rested with him to punish\r\nthe temerity of the people by tightening the reins, or on his own\r\nauthority, without the cooeperation of any assembly, to give the nation a\r\nconstitution. To take the former course he had not the courage, even if\r\nhe had wished to do so; besides, he doubtless saw clearly enough that,\r\nthough such a policy might succeed for a time, it would ultimately lead\r\nto another outbreak. He had, too, no great confidence in his power to\r\nwin toward his person the popular favor. With all his talents and\r\namiable traits, he had not the princely faculty of knowing how to\r\ninspire the people with a sense of his excellences, and was conscious of\r\nthis defect. He chose not unnecessarily to increase an estrangement\r\nwhich had already been to him a source of such deep mortification. He\r\ntherefore issued, on the 5th of December, immediately after dissolving\r\nthe National Assembly, a constitution substantially the same as that\r\nwhich still exists, with the statement prefixed that it should not go\r\ninto operation until after being revised. This revision was to be made\r\nat the first session of the two chambers, to be elected in accordance\r\nwith an election law issued on the next day.\r\n\r\nThe two chambers met February 26, 1849. After a session of two months,\r\nduring which the lower chamber showed a disposition to modify the\r\nconstitution more than was agreeable to the king, the upper chamber was\r\nordered to adjourn, the lower was dissolved, and a new election ordered.\r\nThe new Parliament met August 7. The revision was completed on the last\r\nof January, 1850. On the 6th of February, the king, in the presence of\r\nhis ministers and of both chambers, swore to observe the constitution.\r\nBefore doing so, he made an address, in which he explained his position,\r\nalluding in a regretful strain to the scenes of violence in the midst of\r\nwhich the constitution had been drawn up, expressing his gratitude to\r\nthe chambers for their assistance in perfecting the hastily executed\r\nwork, calling upon them to stand by him in opposition to all who might\r\nbe disposed to make the liberty granted by the king a screen for hiding\r\ntheir wicked designs against the king, and declaring: 'In Prussia, the\r\nking must rule; and I do not rule because it is a pleasure, God knows,\r\nbut because it is God's ordinance; therefore, I _will reign_. A free\r\npeople under a free king--that was my watchword ten years ago; it is the\r\nsame to-day, and shall be the same as long as I live.' The ministers and\r\nthe members of the two chambers, after the king had sworn to support\r\nthe constitution, took the same oath, and in addition one of loyalty to\r\nthe king. The new government was inaugurated. Prussia had become a\r\nlimited monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point appropriate to take a general view of the Prussian\r\nconstitution itself. It has been variously amended since 1850, but not\r\nchanged in any essential features; without dwelling on these amendments,\r\ntherefore, we consider it as it now stands.\r\n\r\nAs to the king: he is, as such, wholly irresponsible. He cannot be\r\ncalled to account for any act which he does in his capacity as monarch.\r\nBut his ministers may be impeached. They have to assume and bear the\r\nresponsibility of all royal acts. None of these acts are valid unless\r\nsigned by one or more of the ministers. To the king is intrusted all\r\nexecutive power; the command of the army; the unconditioned right of\r\nappointing and dismissing his ministers, of declaring war and concluding\r\npeace, of conferring honors and titles, of convoking the national diet,\r\nclosing its sessions, proroguing and dissolving it. He _must_, however,\r\nannually call the Houses together between November 1 and the middle of\r\nJanuary, and cannot adjourn them for a longer period than thirty days,\r\nnor more than once during a session, except with their own consent.\r\nWithout the assent of the diet he cannot make treaties with foreign\r\ncountries nor rule over foreign territory. He has no independent\r\nlegislative power, except so far as this is implied in his right to\r\nprovide for the execution of the laws, and, when the diet is not in\r\nsession, in case the preservation of the public safety or any uncommon\r\nexigency urgently demands immediate action. All such acts, however,\r\nmust, at the next session of the Houses, be laid before them for\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe ministry consists of nine members, under the presidency of the\r\nminister of foreign affairs; besides him are the ministers of finance,\r\nof war, of justice, of worship (religious, educational, and medicinal\r\naffairs), of the interior (police and statistical affairs), of trade and\r\npublic works (post office, railroad affairs, etc.), of agricultural\r\naffairs, and of the royal house (matters relating to the private\r\nproperty of the royal family). The supervision exercised by the ministry\r\nover the various interests of the land is much more immediate and\r\ngeneral than that of the President's cabinet in the United States. Now,\r\nhowever, their authority in these matters is of course conditioned by\r\nthe constitution and the laws. The ministers are allowed to enter either\r\nHouse at pleasure, and must always be heard when they wish to speak. On\r\nthe other hand, either House can demand the presence of the ministers.\r\n\r\nThe legislative power is vested in the king and the two Houses of\r\nParliament. The consent of all is necessary to the passing of every law.\r\nThese Houses (at first called First and Second Chambers, now House of\r\nLords and House of Delegates--_Herrenhaus_ and _Abgeordnetenhaus_) must\r\nboth be convoked or prorogued at the same time. In general a law may be\r\nfirst proposed by the king or by either of the Houses. But financial\r\nlaws must first be discussed by the House of Delegates; and the budget,\r\nas it comes from the lower to the upper House, cannot be amended by the\r\nlatter, but must be adopted or rejected as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords is made up of various classes of persons, all\r\noriginally designated by the king, though in the case of some the office\r\nis hereditary. They represent the nobility, the cities, the wealth, and\r\nthe learning of the land. Each of the five universities furnishes a\r\nmember. The king has the right to honor any one at pleasure, as a reward\r\nfor distinguished services, with a seat in this body. Of course, as the\r\nmembers hold office for life, and hold their office by the royal favor,\r\nit may generally be expected to be a tolerably conservative body, and to\r\nvote in accordance with the wishes of the king.\r\n\r\nThe House of Delegates consists of three hundred and fifty-two members,\r\nelected by the people, but not directly. They are chosen, like our\r\nPresidents, by electors, who are directly chosen by the people. Two\r\nhundred and fifty inhabitants are entitled to one elector. Every man\r\nfrom the age of twenty-five is allowed to vote unless prohibited for\r\nspecific reasons. But strict equality in the right of suffrage is not\r\ngranted. The voters of each district are divided into three classes, the\r\nfirst of which is made up of so many of the largest taxpayers as\r\ntogether pay a third of the taxes; the second, of so many of the next\r\nrichest as pay another third; the last class, of the remainder. Each of\r\nthese divisions votes separately, and each elects a third part of the\r\nelectors. The House of Delegates is chosen once in three years, unless\r\nin the mean time the king dissolves it, in which case a new election\r\nmust take place at once.\r\n\r\nAs to the rights of Prussians in general, the constitution provides that\r\nall in the eye of the law are equal. The old distinctions of classes\r\nstill exists: there are still nobles, with the titles prince, count, and\r\nbaron; but the special privileges which they formerly enjoyed are not\r\nsecured to them by the constitution. The king can honor any one with the\r\nrank of nobility; but the name is the most that can be conferred. In\r\nmost cases the right of primogeniture does not prevail, so that the\r\naristocracy of Prussia is of much less consequence than that of England.\r\nThe poverty which so often results from the division of the estates of\r\nnobles has led to the establishment of numerous so-called\r\n_Fraeuleinstifter_--charitable foundations for such a support of poor\r\nfemale members of noble families as becomes their rank. Many of these\r\ninstitutions were formerly nunneries. It is further provided by the\r\nconstitution that public offices shall be open to all; that personal\r\nfreedom and the inviolability of private property and dwellings shall be\r\nsecured; that all shall enjoy the right of petition, perfect freedom of\r\nspeech, the liberty of forming organizations for the accomplishment of\r\nany legal object; that a censorship of the press can in no case be\r\nexercised, and that no limitation of the freedom of the press can be\r\nintroduced except by due process of law; that civil and political rights\r\nshall not be affected by religious belief, and that the right of filling\r\necclesiastical offices shall not belong to the state. Only 'in case of\r\nwar or insurrection, and of consequent imminent danger,' has the\r\nGovernment a right to infringe on the above specified immunities of the\r\ncitizens and the press.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is all that need be given in order to convey a general\r\nidea of what the Prussian constitution is. It is in its provisions so\r\nspecific and clear, that one would hardly expect that disputes\r\nrespecting its meaning could have reached the height of bitterness which\r\nhas characterized discussions of its most fundamental principles. The\r\nexplanation of this fact is to be sought in the mode of the introduction\r\nof the constitution itself. The English constitution has been the growth\r\nof centuries; the Prussian, of a day. The latter, moreover, was not,\r\nlike ours, the fundamental law of a new nation, but a constitution\r\ndesigned to introduce a radical change in the form of a government\r\nwhich, during many centuries, had been acquiring a fixed character. It\r\nundertook to remodel at one stroke the whole political system. Not\r\nindeed as though there had been no sort of preparation for this change.\r\nThe general advance in national culture, the general anticipation of the\r\nchange, as well as the actual approaches toward it in the administrative\r\nmeasures of Frederick the Great and Frederick William III., paved the\r\nway for the introduction of a popular element in the Government.\r\nNevertheless, the actual, formal introduction itself was sudden. The\r\nconstitution was not, in the specific form which it took, the result of\r\nexperience and experiment. And, as all history shows, attempts to fix or\r\nreconstruct social systems on merely theoretical principles are liable\r\nto fail, because they cannot foresee and provide for all the\r\ncontingencies which may interfere with the application of the theories.\r\nMoreover, in the case of Prussia, as not in that of the United States,\r\nthe constitution was not made by the people for themselves, but given to\r\nthem by a power standing over against them. There was, therefore, not\r\nonly a possibility, as in any case there might be, that the instrument\r\ncould be variously interpreted on account of the different modes of\r\nthinking and difference of personal interests, which always affect men's\r\nopinions; but there was here almost a certainty that this would be the\r\ncase on account of the gulf of separation which, in spite of all the\r\nbridges which often are built over it, divides a monarch, especially an\r\nabsolute, hereditary monarch, from his subjects. In the case before us,\r\nit is certain that the king conceded more than he wished to concede, and\r\nthat the people received less than they wished to receive. That they\r\nshould agree in their understanding of the constitution is therefore not\r\nat all to be expected. The most that the well wishers of the land could\r\nhave hoped was that the misunderstandings would not be radical, and that\r\nin the way of practical experience the defects of the constitution might\r\nbe detected and remedied, and the mutual relations of the rulers and the\r\nruled become mutually understood and peacefully acquiesced in.\r\n\r\nWhat the Prussian Conservatives so often insist on, viz., that a\r\nconstitutional government should have been gradually developed, not\r\nsuddenly substituted for a form of government radically different, is\r\ntherefore by no means without truth. Whether we are to conclude that the\r\nfault has been in the process not beginning sooner, or merely in its\r\nbeing too rapid, is perhaps a question in which we and they might\r\ndisagree. On the supposition that the present state of intelligence\r\nfurnishes a sufficient basis for a constitutional government, it would\r\nseem as though the last fifty years has been a period long enough in\r\nwhich to put it into successful operation. All that the present\r\ngeneration know of politics has certainly been learned within that time:\r\nif the mere practical exercise of political rights is all that is needed\r\nin order to develop the new system, there might at least an excellent\r\nbeginning have been made long before 1850. When we consider, therefore,\r\nthat the Government, after taking the initiatory steps in promoting this\r\ndevelopment, stopped short, and rather showed a disposition to\r\ndiscourage it entirely, these clamors of the Conservatives must seem\r\nsomewhat out of taste. To Americans especially, who can accommodate\r\nthemselves to changes, even though they may be somewhat sudden, such\r\npleas for more time and a more gradual process may appear affected, if\r\nnot puerile. It must be remembered, however, that to a genuine German\r\nnothing is more precious than a process of development. Whatever is not\r\nthe result of a due course of _Entwickelung_, is a suspicious object.\r\nAnything which seems to break abruptly in upon the prescribed course is\r\nabnormal. Whatever is produced before the embryonic process is complete\r\nis necessarily a monster, from which nothing good can be hoped. The same\r\nidea is often advanced by the Conservatives in another form. The\r\nLiberals, they say, are trying to break loose from _history_. A\r\nprominent professor, in an address before an assembly of clergymen in\r\nBerlin, defined the principle of democracy to be this: 'The majority is\r\nsubject to no law but its own will; it is therefore limited by no\r\nhistorically acquired rights; history has no rights over against the\r\nsovereign will of the present generation.' By historically acquired\r\nrights is meant in particular the right of William I. to rule\r\nindependently because his predecessors did so. By what right the great\r\nelector robbed the nobles of their prerogatives, and how, in case he did\r\nwrong in thus disregarding _their_ 'historically acquired rights,' this\r\nwrong itself, by being continued two hundred years, becomes, in its\r\nturn, an acquired right, is not explained in the address to which we\r\nallude. The principal fault to be found with such reasoning as this of\r\nthe Prussian Conservatives, is that it is altogether too vague and\r\nabstract. There can be no development without something new; there can\r\nbe, in social affairs, nothing new without some sort of innovation.\r\nInnovation, as such, can therefore not be condemned without condemning\r\ndevelopment. Moreover, development, as the organic growth of a political\r\nbody, is something which takes care of itself, or rather is cared for by\r\na higher wisdom than man's. To object to a proposed measure nothing more\r\nweighty than that it will not tend to develop the national history, has\r\nlittle meaning, and should have no force. The only question in such a\r\ncase which men have to consider is whether the change is justified by\r\nthe fundamental principles of right, be it that those principles have\r\nhitherto been observed or not.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the arguments of the Conservatives all the more impertinent,\r\nhowever, is the fact that the question is no longer whether the\r\nconstitution ought to be introduced, but whether, being introduced, it\r\nshall be observed. This is for the stiff royalists not so pleasant a\r\nquestion. Prussia _is_ a constitutional monarchy; the king has taken an\r\noath to rule in accordance with the constitution. It may be, undoubtedly\r\nis, true that none of the kings have wished the existence of just such a\r\nlimit to their power; but shall they therefore try to evade the\r\nobligation which they have assumed? The Conservatives dare not say that\r\nthe constitution ought to be violated, for that would look too much like\r\nthe abandonment of their fundamental principle; they also hardly venture\r\nto say that they would prefer to have the king again strictly absolute,\r\nfor that would look like favoring regression more than conservatism. Yet\r\nmany have the conviction that an absolute monarchy would be preferable\r\nto the present, while the arguments of all have little force except as\r\nthey tend to the same conclusion. The point of controversy between them\r\nand their opponents is often represented as being essentially this:\r\nShall the king of Prussia be made as powerless as the queen of England?\r\nAgainst such a degradation of the dignity of the house of Hohenzollern\r\nall the convictions and prejudices of the royalists revolt. Such a\r\nsurrender of all personal power, they say, and say truly, was not\r\ndesigned by Frederick William IV. when he gave the constitution; to ask\r\nthe king, therefore, in all his measures to be determined by the House\r\nof Delegates, is an unconstitutional demand. It is specially provided\r\nthat the _king_ shall appoint and dismiss his own ministers; to ask him,\r\ntherefore, to remove them simply because they are unacceptable to the\r\nHouse of Delegates, is to interfere with the royal prerogatives. The\r\ncommand of the army and the declaration of war belong only to the king;\r\nto binder him, therefore, in his efforts to maintain the efficiency of\r\nthe army, or in his purposes to wage war or abstain from it, is an\r\noverstepping of the limits prescribed to the people's representatives.\r\n\r\nWe have here hinted at the principal elements in the controversy between\r\nthe opposing political parties of Prussia. It is not our object to enter\r\ninto the details of the various strifes which have agitated the land\r\nduring the last sis years, but only to sketch their general character.\r\nThe query naturally arises, when one takes a view of the whole period,\r\nwhich has elapsed since the constitution was introduced, why the contest\r\ndid not begin sooner. The explanation is to be found in the fact that\r\nuntil the present king began to rule, the Liberals in general did not\r\nvote at the elections. It will be remembered that the previous king\r\nabsolutely refused to deal with the assembly which met early in 1849 to\r\nconsider the constitution, and ordered a new election. At this election\r\nthe Liberals saw that, if they reflected the old members, another\r\ndissolution would follow, and they therefore mostly staid away from the\r\npolls. Afterward, when the constitution had been formally adopted, the\r\nGovernment showed a determination to put down all liberal movements;\r\nconsequently the Liberals made no special attempts to move. The\r\nParliament was conservative, and so there was no occasion for strife\r\nbetween it and the king. Not till William I. became regent in place of\r\nhis incapacitated brother, in 1859, did the struggle begin. The policy\r\nof the previous prime minister Manteuffel had produced general\r\ndiscontent. The people were ready to move, if an occasion was offered.\r\nIt is therefore not to be wondered at that, when the new sovereign\r\nannounced his purpose to pursue a more liberal course than his brother,\r\nthe Liberal party raised its head, and sought to make itself felt. The\r\nnew ministry was liberal, and for a while it seemed as though a new\r\norder of things had begun. But this was of short duration. The House of\r\nDelegates, consisting in great part of Liberals (or, to speak more\r\nstrictly, of _Fortschrittsmaenner_--Progress men--_Liberal_ being the\r\ndesignation of a third party holding a middle course between the two\r\nextremes, a party, however, naturally tending to resolve itself into the\r\nothers, and now nearly extinct) urged the Government to adopt its\r\nradical measures. The king began to fear that, if he yielded to all the\r\nwishes of the House, he would lose his proper dignity and authority. He\r\ntherefore began to pursue a different policy: the more urgently the\r\ndelegates insisted on liberal measures, the less inclined was the king\r\nto regard their wishes. He had wished himself to take the lead in\r\ninaugurating the new era; as soon as others, more ambitious, went ahead\r\nof him, he took the lead again, by turning around and pulling in the\r\nopposite direction. The principal topics on which the difference was\r\nmost decided were the ecclesiastical and the financial relations of the\r\nGovernment. Although the constitution provides for the perfect freedom\r\nof the church from the state, the union still existed, and indeed still\r\nexists. The House of Delegates attempted to induce the Government to\r\ncarry out this provision of the constitution. There is no doubt that the\r\nmotive of many of these attempts to divide church and state is a\r\npositive hostility to Christianity. The partial success which has\r\nfollowed them, viz., the securing of charter rights for other religious\r\ndenominations than the Evangelical Church (_i.e._, the Union Church,\r\nconsisting of what were formerly Lutheran and Reformed churches, but in\r\n1817 united, and forming now together the established church), has given\r\nsome prominence to the so-called _Freiegemeinden_, organizations of\r\nfreethinkers, who, though so destitute of positive religious belief that\r\nin one case, when an attempt was made to adopt a creed, an insuperable\r\nobstacle was met in discussing the first article, viz., on the existence\r\nof God, yet meet periodically and call themselves religious\r\ncongregations. There are, moreover, many others, regular members of the\r\nestablished church, who have no interest in religious matters, and would\r\nfor that reason like to be freed from the fetters which now hold them.\r\nThere are, however, many among the best and most discreet Christians\r\nwho, for the good of the church, wish to see it weaned from the breast\r\nof the state. But the great majority of the clergy, especially of the\r\nconsistories (the members of which are appointed by the Government,\r\nmediately, however, now, through the _Oberkirchenrath_), are decidedly\r\nopposed to the separation; and, as they speak for the churches, the\r\nprovision of the constitution allowing the separation is a dead letter.\r\nThere is no denying that, if it were now to be fully carried out, the\r\nconsequences to the church might be, for a time at least, disastrous.\r\nThe people have always been used to the present system; they would\r\nhardly know how to act on any other. Moreover, a large majority of the\r\nchurch members are destitute of active piety; to put the interests of\r\nreligion into the hands of such men would seem to be a dangerous\r\nexperiment. Especially is it true of the mercantile classes, of those\r\nwho are pecuniarily best able to maintain religious institutions, that\r\nthey are in general indifferent to religious things. This being the\r\ncase, one cannot be surprised at the reluctance of those in\r\necclesiastical authority to desire the support of the state to be\r\nwithdrawn. Neverheless it cannot but widen the chasm between the\r\nestablished church and the freethinkers, that the former urges upon the\r\nGovernment to continue a policy which is plainly inconsistent with the\r\nconstitution, and that the Government yields to the urging.\r\n\r\nA more vital point in the controversy between the king and the Liberals\r\nwas the disposition of the finances. The House of Delegates, in the\r\nsession lasting from January 14 to March 11, 1862, insisted on a more\r\nminute specification than the ministry had given of the use to be made\r\nof the moneys to be appropriated. The king at length, wearied with their\r\nimportunity, dissolved the House, upon which a new election followed in\r\nthe next month. The excitement was great. The Government seems to have\r\nhoped for a favorable result, at least for a diminution of the Liberal\r\nmajority. The Minister of the Interior issued a communication to all\r\nofficials, announcing that they would be expected to vote in favor of\r\nthe Government. A similar notification was made to the universities, but\r\nwas protested against. Most of the consistories summoned the clergymen\r\nto labor to secure a vote in favor of the king. But in spite of all\r\nthese exertions, the new House, like the other, contained an\r\noverwhelming majority of Progress men. At the beginning of the new\r\nsession in May, however, both parties seemed more yielding than before.\r\nAttention was given less to questions of general character, more to\r\nmatters of practical concern. But at last the schism developed itself\r\nagain. The king had determined to reorganize and enlarge the army, to\r\nwhich end larger appropriations were needed than usual. The military\r\nbudget put the requisite sum at 37,779,043 thalers (about twenty-five\r\nmillion dollars); the House voted 31,932,940, rejecting the proposition\r\nof the minister by a vote of three hundred and eight to eleven. A change\r\nin the ministry followed, but not a change such as would be expected in\r\nEngland--just the opposite. At the dissolution of the previous House the\r\nLiberal ministry had given place to a more conservative one; now this\r\nconservative one gave place to one still more conservative, Herr von\r\nBismarck became Minister of State. The House then voted that the\r\nappropriations must be determined by the House, else every use made by\r\nthe Government of the national funds would be unconstitutional. The\r\nking's answer to this was an order closing the session. A new session\r\nbegan early in 1863. The same controversy was renewed. The king had\r\nintroduced his new military scheme; he had used, under the plea of stern\r\nnecessity, money not voted by Parliament. He declared that the good of\r\nthe country required it, and demanded anew that the House make the\r\nrequisite appropriation. But the House was not to be moved. So far from\r\nwishing an increase of the military expenses, the Liberal party favored\r\na reduction of the term of service from three to two years. The king\r\naffirmed that he knew better what the interests of the nation required,\r\nand, as the head of the army, he must do what his best judgment dictated\r\nrespecting its condition. Thus the session passed without anything of\r\nconsequence being accomplished. The House of Lords rejected the budget\r\nas it came from the other chamber, and the delegates would not retreat.\r\nConsequently another dead lock was the result. The mutual bitterness\r\nincreased. Minister von Bismarck, a man of considerable talent, but not\r\nof spotless character, and exceedingly offensive in his bearing toward\r\nhis opponents, became so odious that the delegates seemed ready to\r\nreject any proposition coming from him, whether good or bad. They tried\r\nto induce the king to remove him. But this was like the wind trying to\r\nblow off the traveller's coat. Instead of being moved by such\r\ndemonstrations to dismiss the premier, the king manifested in the most\r\nexpress manner his dissatisfaction with such attempts of the House to\r\ninterfere with his prerogatives. One might think that he had resolved to\r\nretain Bismarck out of pure spite, though he might personally be ever so\r\nmuch inclined to drop him. The controversy became more and more one of\r\nopposing wills. May 22, the House voted an address to the king, stating\r\nits views of the state of the country, the rights of the House, etc.,\r\nand expressing the conviction that this majesty had been misinformed by\r\nhis counsellors of the true state of public feeling. The king replied to\r\nthe address a few days later, stating that he knew what he was doing and\r\nwhat was for the good of the people; that the House was to blame for the\r\nfruitlessness of the session; that the House had unconstitutionally\r\nattempted to control him in respect to the ministry and foreign affairs;\r\nthat he did not need to be informed by the House what public sentiment\r\nwas, since Prussia's kings were accustomed to live among and for the\r\npeople; and that, a further continuance of the session being manifestly\r\nuseless, it should close on the next day. Accordingly it was closed\r\nwithout the passage of any sort of appropriation bill, and the\r\nGovernment, as before, ruled practically without a diet.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to arbitrate between the affirmations of the\r\nConservatives, on the one hand, that the _animus_ of the opposition was\r\na spirit of disloyalty toward the Government, an unprincipled and\r\nunconstitutional striving to subvert the foundations of royalty, and\r\nintroduce a substantially democratic form of government, and the\r\ncomplaints of the opposition, on the other hand, that the ministry was\r\ntrying to domineer over the House of Delegates, and reduce its practical\r\npower to a nullity. We may safely assume that there is some truth in\r\nboth statements. Where the dispute is chiefly respecting motives, it\r\nmust always be difficult to find the exact truth. In behalf of the\r\nConservatives, however, it may be said that the Liberals have\r\nundoubtedly been aiming at a greater limitation of the royal power than\r\nthe constitution was designed by its author to establish. Frederick\r\nWilliam IV. proposed to rule _in connection with_ the representatives of\r\nthe people. The idea of becoming a mere instrument for the execution of\r\ntheir wishes, was odious to him, and is odious to his successor. That\r\nsuch a reduction of the kingly office, however, is desired and designed\r\nby many of the Progress party, is hardly to be questioned. But, on the\r\nother hand, it is hard to see, in case the present policy of the\r\nGovernment is carried through, what other function the diet will\r\neventually have than simply that of advising the king and acting as his\r\nmere instrument, whenever he lays his plans and asks for the money\r\nnecessary for their execution. This certainly cannot accord with the\r\narticle of the constitution which declares that the legislative power\r\nshall be 'jointly' (_gemeinschaftlich_) exercised by the king and the\r\ntwo Houses.\r\n\r\nIt is all the less necessary to consider particularly the character of\r\nthe measures proposed and opposed, and the personal motives of the\r\nprominent actors in the present strife, inasmuch as the parties\r\nthemselves are fighting no longer respecting special, subordinate\r\nquestions, but respecting the fundamental principle of the Government,\r\nthe mutual relation which, under the constitution, king and people are\r\nto sustain to each other. From this point of view it is not difficult to\r\npass judgment on the general merits of the case. If we inquire where, if\r\nat all, the constitution has been formally violated, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the breach has been on the side of the Government. That the\r\nconsent of the diet is necessary to the validity act fixing the use of\r\nthe public moneys, is expressly stated in the constitution. That the\r\nGovernment, for a series of years, has appropriated the funds according\r\nto its own will, without obtaining that consent, is an undeniable matter\r\nof fact. It is true that the king and his ministers do not acknowledge\r\nthat this is a violation of the constitution, claiming that the duty of\r\nthe king to provide in cases of exigency for the maintenance of the\r\npublic weal, authorizes him, in the exigency which the obstinacy of the\r\ndelegates has brought about, to act on his own responsibility. The\r\nGovernment must exist, they say, and to this end money must be had; if\r\nthe House will not grant it, we must take it. That this is a mere\r\nquibble, especially as the exigency can be as easily ascribed to the\r\nobstinacy of the king as to that of the delegates, may be affirmed by\r\nLiberals with perfect confidence, when, as is actually the case, all\r\ncandid Conservatives, even those of the strictest kind, confess that\r\n_formally_, at least, the king has acted unconstitutionally. And, though\r\nin respect to the financial question, they may justify this course while\r\nconfessing its illegality, it is not so easy to do so in reference to\r\nthe press law made by the king four days after closing the session of\r\nthe diet. This law established a censorship of the press, which was\r\naimed especially against all attacks in the newspapers on the policy\r\nof the Government, the plea being that the Liberal papers were\r\ndisturbing the public peace and exciting a democratic spirit. The\r\nunconstitutionality of this act was as palpable as its folly. Only in\r\ncase of war or insurrection is any such restriction allowed at all; the\r\nwildest imagination could hardly have declared either war or\r\ninsurrection to be then existing. Moreover, even in case of such an\r\nexigency, the king has a right to limit the freedom of the press only\r\nwhen the diet is not in session and the urgency is too great to make it\r\nsafe to wait for it to assemble. But in this call it is manifest not\r\nonly that the king was not anxious to have the cooeperation of the\r\nHouses, but that he positively wished _not_ to have it. No one imagines\r\nthat he conceived the whole idea of enacting the law _after_ he had\r\nprorogued the diet; certainly nothing new in the line of public danger\r\nhad arisen in those four days to justify the measure. Besides, he knew\r\nthat the House of Delegates would not have approved it. It was, in fact,\r\ndirectly aimed at their supporters. A plainer attack on their\r\nconstitutional rights could hardly have been made.\r\n\r\nBut the delegates were sent home, so that they were now not able to\r\ndisturb the country by their debates. The Conservatives rejoiced in\r\nthis, seeming to think that the only real evil under which the country\r\nwas suffering was the 'gabbling' of the members of the diet. Moreover,\r\nthe press law, unwise and unconstitutional as many of the Conservatives\r\nthemselves considered and pronounced it, was in force, so that the\r\neditorial demagogues also were under bit and bridle. It was hoped that\r\nnow quiet would be restored. The German diet at Frankfort-on-the-Maine\r\nturned public attention for a time from the more purely internal\r\nPrussian politics. But this was a very insufficient diversion. In fact,\r\nthe course of William I., in utterly refusing to have anything to do\r\nwith the proposed remodelling of the articles of confederation, the\r\nobject of which was to effect a firmer union of the German States,\r\nalthough no Prussian had the utmost confidence in the sincerity of the\r\nAustrian emperor, yet ran counter to the wishes of the Liberals, and\r\neven of many Conservatives. The same feeling which fifty years ago gave\r\nrise to the _Burschenschaft_ displayed itself unmistakably in the\r\nenthusiasm with which Francis Joseph's invitation was welcomed by the\r\nGermans in general. The king of Prussia did not dare to declare against\r\nthe proposed measure itself. Acknowledging the need of a revision of the\r\narticles, he yet declined to take part in the diet, simply because, as\r\nhe said, before the princes themselves came together for so important a\r\ndeliberation, some preliminary negotiations should have taken place.\r\nThere is little reason to doubt, however, that his real motive was a\r\nfear lest, if he should commit himself to the cause of German union, he\r\nwould seem to be working in the interests of the Liberals. For, as of\r\nold, so now, the most enthusiastic advocates of a consolidation of the\r\nGerman States are the most inclined to anti-monarchical principles;\r\nnaturally enough, since a firm union of states, utterly distinct from\r\neach other, save as their rulers choose to unite themselves, while yet\r\neach ruler in his own land is independent of the others, and each has\r\nalways reason to be jealous of the other, is an impossibility. This\r\njealousy was conspicuous in the case of Prussia and Austria during the\r\nsession of this special diet, in the summer of 1863. It was shared in\r\nPrussia not only by the king and his special political friends, but by\r\nmany of the Liberals. It was perhaps in the hope that the national\r\nfeeling had received a healthful impulse by the developments of\r\nAustria's ambition to obtain once more the hegemony of Germany, that the\r\nking soon after _dissolved_ the House of Delegates, which in June he had\r\nprorogued. A new election was appointed for October 20. Most strenuous\r\nefforts were made by the Government to secure as favorable a result as\r\npossible. Clergymen were enjoined by the Minister of Instruction to use\r\ntheir influence in behalf of the Government. Officials were notified\r\nthat they would be expected to vote for Conservative candidates, a hint\r\nwhich in Prussia cannot be so lightly regarded as here, since voting\r\nthere is done _viva voce_. But, in spite of all these exertions, the\r\nProgress men in the new House were as overwhelmingly in the majority as\r\nbefore. On assembling, they reelected the former president, Grabow, by a\r\nvote of two hundred and twenty-four to forty. And the same old strife\r\nbegan anew.\r\n\r\nSo little, then, had been accomplished by attempts forcibly to put down\r\nthe opposition party. Many newspapers had received the third and last\r\nwarning for publishing articles of an incendiary character, though none,\r\nso far as we know, were actually suspended; a professor in Koenigsberg\r\nhad been deposed for presiding at a meeting of Liberals; a professor in\r\nBerlin had been imprisoned for publishing a pamphlet against the policy\r\nof the Government. There were even intimations that, unless the\r\nopposition yielded, the king would suspend the constitution, and\r\ndispense entirely with the cooeperation of the Parliament. But whether or\r\nnot this was ever thought of, he showed none of this disposition at the\r\nopening of the session. His speech, though containing no concessions,\r\nwas mild and conciliatory in tone. Perhaps he saw that a threatening\r\ncourse could not succeed, and was intending to pursue another. He\r\ndeclared his purpose to suggest an amendment to the constitution\r\nproviding for such cases of disagreement between the two Houses as had\r\nhitherto obstructed the legislation. This was afterward done. It was\r\nproposed that, whenever no agreement could be secured respecting the\r\nappropriations, the amount should be the same as that of the foregoing\r\nyear. This, however, was not approved by the House of Delegates. The\r\nsame disagreement occurred as at the previous sessions, intensified now\r\nby the increased demands of the Government on account of the threatened\r\nwar in Schleswig-Holstein. A loan of twelve million thalers was\r\nproposed; but the House refused utterly to authorize it unless it could\r\nbe known what was the use to be made of it. This information Minister\r\nBismarck would not give. The dispute grew more and more sharp. The old\r\ncauses of discussion were increased by the fact that Prussia, in\r\nreference to the disputed succession in Schleswig-Holstein, set itself\r\nagainst the popular wish to have the duchy absolutely separated from\r\nDenmark and put under the rule of the prince of Augustenburg. In fact,\r\nin this particular, whatever may be thought elsewhere respecting the\r\nmerits of the war which soon after broke out, the policy of the\r\nGovernment was nearly as odious to most Conservatives as to the\r\nLiberals. They said, the king should have put himself at the head of the\r\nnational, the German demand for the permanent relief of their fellow\r\nGermans in Schleswig-Holstein; he should have taken the cause out of the\r\nsphere of party politics; thus he might have regained his popularity and\r\nunited his people. This is quite possible; but it is certain that he did\r\nnot take this course. He seemed to regard the movement in favor of\r\nPrince Frederick's claims to the duchy as a democratic movement. It was\r\nso called by the more violent Conservatives. The king, after failing to\r\ntake the lead, could not now, consistently with his determination to be\r\nindependent, fall in with the crowd; this would seem like yielding to\r\npressure. Besides, he felt probably more than the Prussian people in\r\ngeneral the binding force of the London treaty. Yet, as a German, he\r\ncould not be content to ignore the claims of the German inhabitants of\r\nthe duchy; there was, therefore, no course left but to make hostile\r\ndemonstrations against Denmark. The pretext was not an unfair one. The\r\nNovember constitution, by which Denmark, immediately after the accession\r\nof the protocol prince, the present king, Christian IX., proposed to\r\nincorporate Schleswig, was a violation of treaty obligations. The Danish\r\nGovernment was required to retract its course. It refused, and war\r\nfollowed. What will be the result of it, what even the Prussian\r\nGovernment wishes to be the result of it, is a matter of uncertainty.\r\nSuspicions of a secret treaty between it and Austria find easy credence,\r\naccording to which, as is supposed, nothing but their mutual\r\naggrandizement is aimed at. Certain it is that none even of the best\r\ninformed pretend to know definitely what is designed, nor be confident\r\nthat the design, whatever it is, will be executed. Yet for the time a\r\ncertain degree of enthusiasm has been of course awakened in all by the\r\nsuccessful advance of Prussian troops through Schleswig, and the\r\nindefinite hope is cherished that somehow, even in spite of the apparent\r\npolicy of the Government, the war will result in rescuing the duchy\r\nentirely from the Danish grasp. Thus, temporarily at least, the popular\r\nmind is again diverted from internal politics; and perhaps the\r\nGovernment was moved as much by a desire to effect this diversion as by\r\nany other motive. The decided schism between Prussia and Austria on the\r\none hand, and the smaller German States on the other, a schism in which\r\nthe majority of the people even in Prussia and Austria side with the\r\nsmaller states, favors the notion that these two powers dislike heartily\r\nto enter into a movement whose motive and end is mainly the promotion of\r\nGerman unity at the expense of monarchical principles. For, however much\r\nof subtlety may be exhibited in proving that the prince of Augustenburg\r\nis the rightful heir to the duchy, the real source of the German\r\ninterest in the matter is sympathy with their fellow Germans, who, as is\r\nnot to be doubted, have been in various ways, especially in respect to\r\nthe use of the German language in schools and churches, abused and\r\nirritated by the Danish Government. The death of the late king of\r\nDenmark was only made the occasion for seeking the desired relief.\r\nFifteen years ago the same thing was done without any such occasion. But\r\nit would be the extreme of inconsistency for the Prussian Government to\r\nhelp directly and ostensibly a movement which, whatever name it may\r\nbear, is essentially a rebellion: if there are Germans in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, so are there Poles in Poland.\r\n\r\nBut, although, for the time being, the excitement of actual war silences\r\nthe murmurs of the Progress party, the substantial occasion for them is\r\nnot removed. On the contrary, there is reason to expect that the contest\r\nwill become still more earnest. Only one turn of events can avert this:\r\nthe separation of Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark in consequence of the\r\npresent war. If this is not the result, if nothing more is accomplished\r\nthan the restoration of the duchy to its former condition, the king will\r\nlose the support of many Conservatives, and be still more bitterly\r\nopposed by the Liberals. In addition to this is to be considered that\r\nthe war is carried on in spite of the refusal of the diet to authorize\r\nthe requisite loan; that, moreover, after vainly seeking to secure this\r\nvote from the delegates, Minister Bismarck, in the name of the king,\r\nprorogued the diet on the 25th of January, 1864, telling the Delegates\r\nplainly that the money must be had, and accordingly that, if its use\r\nwere not regularly authorized, it must be taken by the Government\r\nwithout such authority. His spirit may be gathered from a single remark\r\namong the many bitter things which he had to say in the closing days of\r\nthe session: 'In order to gain your confidence, one must give one's self\r\nup to you; what then would the ministers in future be but Parliamentary\r\nministers? To this condition, please God, we shall not be reduced.' The\r\nspirit of the delegates is expressed in the question of one of their\r\nnumber: 'Why does the Minister of State ask us to authorize the loan, if\r\nhe has no need of our consent--if we have not the right to say _No_?'\r\nBrilliant successes of the Prussian arms, accomplishing substantially\r\nthe result for which the German people are all earnestly longing, may\r\nrestore the Government to temporary favor, and weaken the Progress\r\nparty; otherwise, as many Conservatives themselves confess, the king\r\nwill have paralyzed the arms of his own friends.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be the end of this conflict between the Prussian Government\r\nand the Prussian people? Without attempting to play the prophet's part,\r\nwe close by mentioning some considerations which must be taken into\r\naccount in forming a judgment. Although we have little doubt that the\r\npresent policy of the Government will not be permanently adhered to, we\r\ndo not anticipate any speedy or violent rupture. The case is in many\r\nrespects parallel to that of the quarrel between Charles I. and his\r\nParliaments; but the points of difference are sufficient to warrant the\r\nexpectation of a somewhat different result. Especially these: Charles\r\nhad no army of such size and efficiency that he could bid defiance to\r\nthe demands of his Parliament; on the contrary, the Prussian army is, in\r\ntimes of peace, two hundred thousand strong, and can, in case of need,\r\nbe at once trebled; moreover, soldiers must take an oath of allegiance\r\nto the king, not, however, to the constitution. Of this army the king is\r\nthe head, and with it under his control he can feel tolerably secure\r\nagainst the danger of a popular outbreak. Again, the English\r\nrevolutionists had little to fear from Continental interference;\r\nPrussia, on the contrary, is so situated that a revolution there could\r\nhardly fail to provoke neighboring monarchies to assist in putting it\r\ndown. There is no such oppression weighing the people down that they\r\nwould be willing to run this risk in an attempt to remove it. Again, the\r\nLiberals hope, and not without reason, that they will eventually secure\r\nwhat they wish by peaceable means. There is little doubt that, if they\r\npursue a moderate course, neither resorting to violence nor threatening\r\nto do so, themselves avoiding all violations of the constitution, while\r\ncompelling the Government, in case it will not yield, to commit such\r\nviolations openly, their cause will gradually grow so strong that the\r\nking will ultimately see the hopelessness of longer resisting it. Or,\r\nonce more, even if the present king, whose self-will is such that he may\r\npossibly persevere in his present course through his reign, does not\r\nyield, it is understood that the heir apparent is inclined to adopt a\r\nmore liberal policy whenever he ascends the throne, an event which\r\ncannot be very long distant. Were he supposed fully to sympathize with\r\nhis father, the danger of a violent solution of the difficulty would be\r\ngreater. But, as the case stands, it may not be considered strange if\r\nthe conflict lasts several years longer without undergoing any essential\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nThere is no prospect that the dissension will be ended by mutual\r\nconcessions. This might be done, if mutual confidence existed between\r\nthe contending parties; but of such confidence there is a total lack. So\r\ngreat is the estrangement that the original occasion of it is lost sight\r\nof. Neither party cares so much about securing the success of its\r\nfavorite measures as about defeating the measures of its opponent.\r\nEither the possibility of such a relation of the king to the Parliament\r\nwas not entertained when the constitution was drawn up, or it is a great\r\ndeficiency that no provision was made for it; or (as we should prefer to\r\nsay) the difficulty may have been foreseen and yet no provision have\r\nbeen made for it, simply because none could have been made consistently\r\nwith Frederick William IV.'s maxim, 'A free people under a free king'--a\r\nmaxim which sounds well, but which, when the people are bent on going in\r\none way and the king in another, is difficult to reconcile with the\r\nrequirement of the constitution that both must go in the same way. In a\r\nrepublic, where the legislature and chief magistrate are both chosen\r\nrepresentatives of one people, no protracted disagreement between them\r\nis possible. In a monarchy where a ministry, which has lost the\r\nconfidence of the legislature, resigns its place to another, the danger\r\nis hardly greater. But in a monarchy whose constitution provides that\r\nking and people shall rule jointly, yet both act freely and\r\nindependently, nothing but the most paradisiacal state of humanity could\r\nsecure mutual satisfaction and continued harmony. Prussia is now\r\ndemonstrating to the world that, if the people of a nation are to have\r\nin the national legislation anything more than an advisory power, they\r\nmust have a determining power. To say that the king shall have the\r\nunrestricted right of declaring and making war, and at the same time\r\nthat no money can be used without the free consent of Parliament, is\r\nalmost fit to be called an Irish bull. Such mutual freedom is impossible\r\nexcept when king and Parliament perfectly agree in reference to the war\r\nitself. But, if this agreement exists, there is either no need of a\r\nParliament or no need of a king. It makes little difference how the\r\nconstitution is worded in this particular, nor even what was intended by\r\nthe author of this provision. What is in itself an intrinsic\r\ncontradiction cannot be carried out in practice. Whether any formal\r\nchange is made in the constitution or not, a different mode of\r\ninterpreting it, a different conception of the relation of monarch to\r\nsubject, must become current, if the constitution is to be a working\r\ninstrument. Prussia must become again practically an absolute monarchy\r\nor a constitutional monarchy like England. Nor is there much doubt which\r\nof these possibilities will be realized. And not the least among the\r\ncauses which will hasten the final triumph of Liberalism there, is the\r\nexhibition of the strength of republicanism here, while undergoing its\r\npresent trial. When one observes how many of the more violent Prussian\r\nConservatives openly sympathize with the rebels, and most of the others\r\nfail to do so only because they dislike slavery; when one sees, on the\r\nother hand, how anxiously the Prussian Liberals are waiting and hoping\r\nfor the complete demonstration of the ability of our Government to\r\noutride the storm which has threatened its destruction, the cause in\r\nwhich we are engaged becomes invested with a new sacredness. Our success\r\nwill not only secure the blessings of a free Government to the\r\nsucceeding generations of this land, but will give a stimulus to free\r\nprinciples in every part of the globe. If 'Freedom shrieked when\r\nKosciuszko fell' at the hands of despotism, a longer and sadder wail\r\nwould mark the fall of American republicanism, wounded and slain in the\r\nhouse of its friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'YE KNOW NOT WHAT YE ASK.'\r\n\r\n\r\n  One morn in spring, when earth lay robed\r\n    In resurrection bloom,\r\n  I turned away my tear-veiled eyes,\r\n    Feeling the glow but gloom,\r\n  And asked my God one boon I craved,\r\n    Or earth were living tomb.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  One autumn morn, when all the world\r\n    In ripened glory lay,\r\n  I turned to God my shining eyes,\r\n    And praised Him for that day,\r\n  When asking _curses_ with my lips,\r\n    He turned His ear away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMING UP AT SHILOH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain, which had been falling steadily since shortly after midnight,\r\nceased at daybreak. The morning dawned slowly and moodily, above the\r\nwooded hilltops that rose steeply from the farther bank of the creek\r\nclose by, right over against the cornfield, in which, on the preceding\r\nevening, we had comfortably pitched our camp. The bugle wound an early\r\nreveille; then came the call to strike tents, though one half of the\r\nbrigade was yet busy in hurried preparations for breakfast, and\r\npresently the assembly sounded. We were on the march again by the time\r\nthe sun would have liked to greet us with his broad, level-thrown smile\r\nfor 'good morning,' if the sky had been clear and open enough, instead\r\nof covered, as it was on this damp, chilly April morning, with dull,\r\nsullen masses of cloud that seemed still nursing their ill humor and\r\nbent on having another outbreak. The road was heavy; an old, worn\r\nstage-coach road, of a slippery, treacherous clay, which the trampings\r\nof our advanced regiments speedily kneaded into a tough, stiff dough,\r\nforming a track that was enough to try the wind and bottom of the best.\r\nFor some miles, too, the route was otherwise a difficult one--hilly, and\r\nleading by two or three tedious crossings in single file over fords,\r\nwhere now were rushing turbid, swollen streams, gorging and overflowing\r\ntheir banks everywhere in the channels, which nine months out of the\r\ntwelve give passage to innocent brooklets only, that the natives of\r\nthese parts may cross barefoot without wetting an ankle. Spite of these\r\ndrawbacks, the men were in fine spirits; for this was the end of our\r\nweary march from Nashville, and we were sure now of a few days' rest and\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after midday we reached Savannah, and were ordered at once\r\ninto camp. By this time the sky had cleared, the sun was shining\r\nbrightly, though, as it seemed, with an effort; the wind, which had been\r\nfreshening ever since morning, was blowing strong and settled from out\r\nthe blue west, and the earth was drying rapidly. The Sixth Ohio and a\r\ncomrade regiment of the Tenth Brigade pitched their tents in an old and\r\nwell-cleared camping ground, on a gently sloping rise looking toward the\r\ntown from the southeastward; a little too far from the river to quite\r\ntake in, in its prospect, the landing with its flotilla of transports\r\nand the gunboats which they told us were lying there, yet not so far but\r\nwe could easily discern the smoke floating up black and dense from the\r\nboats' chimney stacks, and hear the long-drawn, labored puffs of the\r\nescape pipes, and the shrill signals of the steam whistles. Altogether\r\nour camping ground was eligible, dry, and pleasant.\r\n\r\nIt was on Saturday, the fifth day of April, 1862, that the Fourth\r\ndivision, being the advance corps of the Army of the Ohio, came thus to\r\nSavannah, and so was brought within actual supporting distance of the\r\nforces under General Grant at Pittsburg Landing, twelve miles up the\r\nfarther bank of the Tennessee. General Crittenden's division encamped\r\nthat evening three hours' march behind us. Still farther in the rear\r\nwere coming in succession the divisions of McCook, Wood, and Thomas. It\r\nwas well that such reenforcements were at hand; otherwise, unless we\r\ndisregarded the best-established laws of probabilities in deciding the\r\nquestion, the Army of the Tennessee was even then a doomed one, and the\r\nstory of Shiloh must have gone to the world a sad, tragic tale of the\r\nmost crushing defeat which had ever fallen upon an army since the days\r\nof Waterloo. No mean service, then, was rendered the national cause, and\r\nall which that cause will stand out as the embodiment of, in all the\r\nages to come, when Shiloh was saved, and Treason was forced to turn,\r\nfaint, and stagger away from the field to which it had rushed with a\r\nfiend's exultant eagerness, having there met only its own discomture.\r\nThe meed due for that service is a coronal of glory, that may never,\r\nprobably, be claimed as the desert of any _one_ individual exclusively;\r\nnor is it likely that the epitaph, enchiselled upon whose tombstone\r\nsoever it might be, 'Here lies the saviour of Shiloh,' would pass one\r\nhour unchallenged. Yet impartial history can scarcely be at fault in\r\nrecognizing as preeminent the part taken by one officer, in the events,\r\nwhose results, at least, permit so much of eulogy to be written, with\r\nother significance than merely that of a wretched burlesque. That\r\nofficer was General Nelson, the commander of our own division.\r\nIron-nerved, indomitable, willfull, disdainful of pleasing with studied\r\nphrase of unmeant compliment, but with a great, manly heart beating\r\nstrong in his bosom, and a nature grandly earnest, brave, and true--with\r\nthe very foremost of Kentucky's loyal sons will ever stand the name of\r\nGeneral William Nelson.\r\n\r\nOur column had marched from Nashville out on the Franklin turnpike,\r\nnearly three weeks previous. General McCook, as the senior divisional\r\ncommander, had claimed the advance, and had held it in our march through\r\nthat beautiful, cultivated garden spot of Middle Tennessee, as far as\r\nColumbia, a distance of nearly fifty miles. Here the turnpike and the\r\nrailroad bridges over Duck river had both been destroyed by the rebels\r\nin their forlorn retreat from the northward. To replace the former even\r\nwith a tottering wooden structure, was a work of time and labor.\r\nMeanwhile the army waited wearily, General Nelson chafed at the delay,\r\nand the rebel leaders Beauregard and Sidney Johnston were concentrating\r\ntheir forces at Corinth with ominous celerity. It was their purpose to\r\ncrush, at one blow, so suddenly and so surely dealt that succor should\r\nbe impossible, the National army, which had established itself on the\r\nborders of one of the southernmost States of the Confederacy, and was\r\nmenacing lines of communication of prime necessity to their maintenance\r\nof the defensive line within which those commanders had withdrawn their\r\ndiscomfited armies. At length, one evening, on dress parade, there were\r\nread 'General orders, headquarters Fourth division,' for a march at\r\ndaylight the next morning. Some days would yet be required to complete\r\nthe bridge, but permission had been wrung from the 'commanding general'\r\nto cross the river by fording, and comically minute the detailed\r\ninstructions of that order were for accomplishing the feat.\r\n\r\nSo on Saturday, the twenty-ninth of March, we passed over Duck river.\r\nOther divisions immediately followed. By his importunity and\r\ncharacteristic energy, General Nelson had thus secured for us the\r\nadvance for the seventy-five miles that remained of the march, and,\r\nincalculably more than this, had gained days of precious time for the\r\nentire army. How many hours later the Army of the Ohio might have\r\nappeared at Shiloh in season to stay the tide of disaster and rescue the\r\nfield at last, let those tell who can recall the scenes of that awful\r\nSabbath day there on the banks of the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had established his headquarters at Savannah, and there\r\nimmediately upon our arrival our commander reported his division. Long\r\nbefore night, camp rumors had complacently decided our disposition for\r\nthe present. Three days at Savannah to allow the other corps of our army\r\nto come up with us, and then, by one more easy stage, we could all move\r\ntogether up to Pittsburg Landing, and take position beside the Army of\r\nthe Tennessee. It was a very comfortable programme, and not the least of\r\nits recommendations was the earnest of its faithful carrying out, which\r\nappeared in the unusual regard to mathematical precision that our\r\nofficers had shown in 'laying off camp,' and the painstaking care they\r\nhad required on our part in establishing it.\r\n\r\nThere was but an inconsiderable force here, composed for the most part\r\nof new troops from two or three States of the Northwest. I remember,\r\nespecially, one regiment from Wisconsin, made up of great, brawny,\r\nawkward fellows--backwoodsmen and lumbermen chiefly--who followed us to\r\nShiloh on the next evening, and through the whole of Monday fought and\r\nsuffered like heroes, as they were. Our first inquiries, quite\r\nnaturally, were concerning our comrade army, and the enemy confronting\r\nit at Corinth. Varied and incongruous enough was the information that we\r\ngleaned, and in some details requiring a simple credulity that nine\r\nmonths of active campaigning had quite jostled and worried out of us. It\r\nseemed settled, however, that our comrades up the river were a host\r\nformidable in numbers and of magnificent armament and _material_;\r\naltogether very well able to take care of themselves, at least until we\r\ncould join them at our leisure.\r\n\r\nThere were some things which, if we had more carefully considered them,\r\nmight, perhaps, have abated somewhat this pleasant conviction of\r\nsecurity. The enemy had lately grown wonderfully bold and\r\nventuresome--skirmishing with picket outposts, bullying reconnoitring\r\nparties, and picking quarrels upon unconscionably slight provocation\r\nalmost daily. He had even challenged our gunboats, disputing the passage\r\nup the river in an artillery duello at the Bluffs, not far above the\r\nLanding, whose hoarse, sullen rumbling had reached us where we were\r\nresting on that Thursday afternoon, at the distance of thirty miles back\r\ntoward Nashville. But, then, on how few fields had Southern chivalry\r\never yet ventured to attack; how seldom, but when fairly cornered, had\r\nits champions deemed discretion _not_ the better part of valor! What\r\nother possibility was there which was not more likely to become an\r\nactuality than that the enemy would here dare to assume the aggressive?\r\nWho that had the least regard for the dramatic proprieties, could ever\r\nassign to him any other part in the tragedy than one whose featliest\r\ndisplay of skill and dexterity should be exhibited in executing the\r\nmovements of guard and parry, and whose noblest performance should be to\r\nstand at bay, resolutely contending upon a hopeless field to meet a\r\nSpartan death? So we cast aside all serious thought of immediate danger\r\nat Pittsburg Landing, the sanguine temperaments pronouncing these\r\ndemonstrations of a foe who had shown our army only his heels all the\r\nway from Bowling Green and Fort Donelson, really diverting from their\r\nvery audacity.\r\n\r\nAt sunset, the Sixth held dress parade--the first since our march from\r\nColumbia; but I, on duty that day as one of the 'reserve guard,' was\r\nmerely a looker-on. I was never prouder of the old regiment; it went\r\nthrough with the manual of arms so well--and then there were so many\r\nspectators present from other regiments. Orders were given to prepare\r\nfor a thorough inspection of arms and equipments at ten o'clock on the\r\nnext morning, then parade was dismissed, and so the day ended. The wind\r\ndied away, and the night deepened, cool, tranquil, starlit, on a camp of\r\nweary soldiery, where contentment and good will ruled for the hour over\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBeautifully clear and calm the Sabbath morning dawned, April 6th, 1862;\r\nrather chilly, indeed, for it was yet in the budding time of spring. But\r\nthe sky was so blue and cloudless, the air so still, and all nature lay\r\nsmiling so serene and fair in the glad sunshine--it was a day such as\r\nthat whereon the Creator may have looked upon the new-born earth, and\r\n'saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good;' a day\r\nas if chosen from all its fellows and consecrated to a hallowed quiet,\r\nthe blessedness of prayer and thanksgiving, praise and worship.\r\n\r\nHardly a man in our division, I believe, but awoke that morning with a\r\nhappy consciousness of long hours that this day were to be his own, and\r\na clear idea of just how he should improve them. My programme was the\r\ngeneral one, and simple enough it was. First, of course, to make ready\r\nfor inspection, and, that ceremony well gotten through with, to enact\r\nthe familiar performance of every man his own washerwoman and\r\nseamstress: the remainder of the day should be devoted to the soldier's\r\nsacred delight of correspondence--to completing a letter to Wynne, begun\r\nback at Columbia, and writing home. Out by the smouldering fire, where\r\nthe cooks of our mess had prepared breakfast nearly two hours before, I\r\nwas busily at work furbishing with the new dust-fine ashes the brasses\r\nof my accoutrements, when the boom of cannon burst on the air, rolling\r\nheavily from away to the southward up from what we knew must be the\r\nneighborhood of the camps at Pittsburg Landing. It was after seven\r\no'clock. The sun was mounting over the scrubby oak copse behind our\r\ncamp, and the day grew warm apace. Another and still another explosion\r\nfollowed in quick succession.\r\n\r\nWhat could it mean? Only the gunboats, some suggested, shelling\r\nguerillas out of the woods somewhere along the river bank. Impossible;\r\ntoo near, too far to the right, for that. It could hardly be artillery\r\npractice merely; for to-day was the Sabbath. And the youngest soldier\r\namong us knew better than to give those rapid, furious volleys the\r\ninterpretation of a formal military salute. Could it really be--battle?\r\n\r\nEvery man almost was out and listening intently. Louder and fiercer the\r\nreports came, though still irregular. Now and then, in the intervals, a\r\nlow, quick crepitation reached us, an undertone that no soldier could\r\nfail to recognize as distant musketry. Ominous sounds they were,\r\nportending--what? What, indeed, if not actual battle? If a battle, then\r\ncertainly an attack by the enemy. Were our comrades up at the Landing\r\nprepared for it?\r\n\r\nThe first cannon had been fired scarcely ten minutes, when General\r\nNelson rode by toward headquarters, down in the busiest part of the\r\ntown, aides and orderlies following upon the gallop. Presently came\r\norders:\r\n\r\n'Three days' rations in haversacks, strike tents, and pack up. Be ready\r\nto move at a moment's notice. They are fighting up at the Landing.'\r\n\r\nThere was no need for further urging. By ten o'clock every disposition\r\nfor the march had been completed. Nearly three long hours more we waited\r\nwith feverish anxiety for the final command to start, while the roar of\r\nthat deathly strife fell distantly upon our ears almost without\r\nintermission, and a hundred wild rumors swept through the camp. General\r\nGrant had gone up the river on a gunboat soon after the cannonading\r\nbegan. It was not long after midday when we struck tents, were furnished\r\nwith a new supply of cartridges and caps for our Enfields, and waited\r\nseveral minutes longer. At length, however, the column formed, and,\r\nthough still without orders, except those which its immediate commander\r\nhad assumed the responsibility to give, the Fourth division was on the\r\nmarch for Shiloh. The Tenth brigade had, as usual, the advance, and, in\r\nour regular turn, the Sixth came the third regiment in the column. We\r\nhad just cleared the camping grounds, I well remember, when General\r\nNelson rode leisurely down the line, his eye taking note with the quiet\r\nglance of the real soldier of every minutia of equipments and appearance\r\ngenerally. Some natures seem to find in antagonism and conflict their\r\nnative element, their chief good--yet more, almost as much a necessity\r\nof their moral organism as to their animal being is the air they\r\nbreathe. Such a nature was Nelson's. His face to-day wore that\r\ncharacteristic expression by which every man of his command learned to\r\ngraduate his expectation of an action; it was the very picture of\r\nsatisfaction and good humor. He wheeled his horse half around as the\r\nrear of our brigade passed him, and a blander tone of command I never\r\nheard than when, in his rapid, authoritative manner, he rang out:\r\n\r\n'Now, gentlemen, keep the column well closed up!' and passed on toward\r\nthe next brigade.\r\n\r\nGentlemen! how oddly the title comes to sound in the ears of a soldier!\r\n\r\nFrom Savannah to the Tennessee, directly opposite Pittsburg Landing, is,\r\nby the course we took, perhaps ten miles. The route was only a narrow\r\nwagon-path through the woods and bottoms bordering the river, and the\r\nwisdom was soon apparent which had beforehand secured the services of a\r\nnative as guide. Most of the latter half of the distance was through a\r\nlow, slimy swamp land, giving rank growth to an almost continuous forest\r\nof sycamore, cottonwood, and other trees which love a damp, alluvial\r\nsoil, whose massive trunks were yet foul and unsightly with filth and\r\nscum deposited by the receding waters at the subsidence of the river's\r\ngreat spring freshet a month before. Stagnant ponds and mimic lagoons\r\nlay all about us and in our very pathway, some of the deeper ones,\r\nhowever, rudely bridged. Very rapid progress was impossible. It had\r\nalready been found necessary to send our artillery back to Savannah,\r\nwhence it would have to be brought up on the transports. The afternoon\r\nwore on, warm and sultry, and the atmosphere in those dank woods felt\r\nclose, aguish, and unwholesome. Not a breath of air stirred to refresh\r\nthe heated forms winding in long, continuous line along the dark boles\r\nof the trees, through whose branches and leafless twigs the sunlight\r\nstreamed in little broken gleams of yellow brightness, and made a\r\ncurious checkerwork of sheen and shadow on all beneath. Burdened as we\r\nwere with knapsacks and twenty extra rounds of ammunition, the march\r\ngrew more and more laborious. But the noise of battle was sharpening\r\nmore significantly every few minutes now, and the men pushed forward. It\r\nwas no child's game going on ahead of us. We _might_ be needed.\r\n\r\nWe _were_ needed. A loud, tumultuous cheer from the Thirty-sixth Indiana\r\ncame surging down through the ranks of the Twenty-fourth Ohio to our own\r\nregiment, and away back beyond to the Twenty-second and Nineteenth\r\nbrigades in the rear. 'Forward!' and we were off on the double quick.\r\nGeneral Nelson was at the head of the column; there a courier had met\r\nhim--so at least runs the tradition--with urgent orders to hasten up the\r\nreenforcements: the enemy were pressing hard for the Landing. Unmindful\r\nof all impediments--trees and fallen logs, shallow ponds and slippery\r\nmire shoetop deep; now again moderating our pace to the route step to\r\nrecover breath and strength; even halting impatiently for a few minutes\r\nnow and then, while the advance cleared itself from some entanglement of\r\nthe way--so the remainder of our march continued. It seemed a long way\r\nto the Landing, the battle dinning on our ears at every step. At length\r\nit sounded directly ahead of us, close at hand; and looking forward out\r\nthrough the treetops, a good eye could easily discover a dark cloud of\r\nsmoke hanging low in mid air, as though it sought to hide from the light\r\nof heaven the deeds that were being done beneath it. Suddenly we\r\ndebouched into a level cornfield, extending quite to the river's verge.\r\nThe clearing was not a wide one, and the farther bank of the Tennessee\r\nwas in plain sight--the landings, the bluff, and the woods above\r\nstretching away out and back beyond.\r\n\r\nWhat a panorama! The river directly before us was hidden by a narrow\r\nbelt of chaparral and the drift that had lodged along the banks, but the\r\nsmoke stacks of three or four transports were visible above the weed\r\nstalks and bushes, and the course of one or two more could be traced by\r\na distant, trailing line of smoke as they steamed down toward Savannah.\r\nThe opposite bank rises from the river a steep acclivity, perhaps a\r\nhundred and fifty feet in perpendicular height, down whose sides of\r\nbrownish yellow clay narrow roadways showed out to the landings below.\r\nCresting the bluff, woods overlooked the whole, and shut in the scene\r\nfar as the eye could follow the windings of the Tennessee. In their\r\ndepths, the battle was raging with unabated fury. A short distance up\r\nthe river, though completely hidden from view by an intervening bend,\r\nthe gunboats were at work, and even our unpractised ears could easily\r\ndistinguish the heavy boom of their great thirty-two pounders in the\r\nmidst of all that blaze of battle and the storm of artillery explosions.\r\nGlorious old Tyler and Lexington! primitive, ungainly, weather-beaten,\r\nwooden craft, but the salvation, in this crisis hour of the fight, of\r\nour out-numbered and wellnigh borne-down left. A signal party, stationed\r\na little above the upper landing and halfway up the bluff, was\r\ncommunicating in the mystic language of the code with another upon our\r\nside the river. What messages were those little party-colored flags\r\nexchanging, with their curious devices of stripes and squares and\r\ntriangles, their combinations and figures in numberless variety, as they\r\nwere waved up and down and to and fro in rapid, ever-shifting pantomime?\r\nThe steep bank was covered with a swaying, restless mass of\r\nblue-uniformed men, too distant to be distinctly discriminated, yet\r\ncertainly numbering thousands. 'Reserves!' a dozen voices cried at once,\r\nand the next moment came the wonder that our march had been so hurried,\r\nwhen whole brigades, as it seemed, could thus be held in idle waiting.\r\nWe were soon undeceived.\r\n\r\nOut into the cornfield filed the column, up the river, and nearly\r\nparallel to it, halting a little below the upper one of the two\r\nprincipal landings. Here there was a further delaying for ferriage.\r\n\r\n'Stack arms; every man fill his canteen, then come right back to the\r\nranks!'\r\n\r\nNot to the Tennessee for water--there was no time to go so far--but\r\nclose at hand, at a pond, or little bayou of the river; and, returning\r\nto the line of stacks, a few more long, unquiet minutes in waiting,\r\nspeculation, and eager gazing toward the battle. And then we saw what\r\nwas that dark, turbulent multitude over the river: oh, shame! a confused\r\nrabble, composed chiefly of men whose places were rightly on the field,\r\nbut who had turned and fled away from the fight to seek safety under the\r\ncoverture of that bluff.\r\n\r\nForward again, and the regiment moved, with frequent little aggravating\r\nhalts, up to the point on the river where the Thirty-sixth Indiana had\r\nalready embarked, and were now being ferried over. The Twenty-fourth\r\nOhio crossed at the lower landing. There were a number of country folk\r\nhere, clad in the coarse, rusty homespun common in the South, whose\r\nintense anxiety to see every movement visible on the farther side of the\r\nriver kept them unquietly shifting their positions continually. One of\r\nthese worthies was hailed from our company:\r\n\r\n'Say, old fellow! how's the fight going on over there?'\r\n\r\nHe was an old and somewhat diminutive specimen, grizzle haired, and\r\nstoop shouldered, but yellow and withered from the effects of sun and\r\ntobacco rather than the burden of years. For a moment he hesitated, as\r\nthough guarding his reply, and then, with a sidelong glance of the eyes,\r\nanswered slowly:\r\n\r\n'Well, it aren't hardly decided yet, I reckon; but they're a drivin'\r\nyour folks--some.'\r\n\r\nEvidently he believed that our army had been badly beaten. The emphatic\r\nrejoinder, 'D--d old secesh!' was the sole thanks his information\r\nbrought him: the characterization, aside from the accented epithet, was\r\ndoubtless a just one, but for all that his words were in no wise\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nA minute later we passed a sergeant, whose uniform and bright-red\r\nchevrons showed that he was attached to some volunteer battery. He was\r\nmounted upon a large, powerful horse, and seemed a man of considerable\r\nability.\r\n\r\n'Do the rebels fight well over there?' demanded a voice from the column\r\na half dozen files ahead of me.\r\n\r\n'Guess they do! Anyway, _fit_ well enough to take our battery from\r\nus--every gun, and some of the caissons.'\r\n\r\nAnother soldier met us, unencumbered with blouse or coat of any kind,\r\nhis accoutrements well adjusted over his gray flannel shirt, and his\r\nrifle sloped carelessly back over his shoulder. His eyes were bloodshot,\r\nand his face, all begrimed with smoke and gunpowder, wore an expression\r\nhaggard, gaunt, and very weary. He was a sharpshooter, he told us,\r\nbelonging to some Missouri regiment, and had been out skirmishing almost\r\never since daylight, with not a mouthful to eat since the evening\r\nbefore. His cartridges--and he showed us his empty cartridge-box--had\r\ngiven out the second time, and he was 'used up.' In his hat and clothes\r\nwere several bullet holes; but he had been hit but once, he said, and\r\nthen by only a spent buckshot.\r\n\r\n'Boys, I'm glad you're come,' he said. 'It's a fact, they _have_ whipped\r\nus so far; but I guess we've got 'em all right _now_. How many of\r\nBuell's army can come up to-night?'\r\n\r\nA hurried, many-voiced reply, and hastening on past a heterogeneous\r\ncollection of soldiery--couriers, cavalry-men, malingerers, stragglers,\r\na few of the slightly wounded, and camp followers of all sorts--we\r\nquickly reached the river's brink. The boat was lying close below.\r\nTwenty feet down the crumbling bank, slipping, or swinging down by the\r\nroots and twigs of friendly bushes, the regiment lost but little time in\r\nembarking. The horses of our field officers were somehow got on board,\r\nand, with crowded decks, the little steamer headed for the landing right\r\nover against us. Two or three boats were there hugging the shore, quiet\r\nand motionless, and there were still more at the lower landing. One or\r\ntwo of these the deck hands pointed out to us as magazine boats,\r\nfreighted with precious stores of ammunition, and the remainder were\r\nnow, of necessity, being used as hospital boats. The wounded had quite\r\nfilled these latter, and several hundred more of the day's victims had\r\nalready been sent down the river to Savannah. One of the gunboats, fresh\r\nfrom its glorious work up beyond the bend, shortly came in sight, moving\r\nslowly down stream, as though reconnoitring the bank for some inlet up\r\nwhich its crashing broadsides could be poured with deadliest effect, if\r\nthe enemy should again appear in sight.\r\n\r\nAn informal command to land was given us presently, but many had already\r\nanticipated it. How terribly significant becomes the simple mechanism of\r\nloading a rifle when one knows that it is at once the earnest of deadly\r\nbattle and the preparation for it! The few details which we could gather\r\nfrom the deck hands concerning the fight were meagre and unsatisfactory.\r\nThey told us of disaster that befell our army in the morning, and which\r\nit seemed very doubtful if the afternoon had yet seen remedied; and\r\ntheir testimony was borne out by evidences to which our own unwilling\r\nsenses were the sufficient witnesses. The roar of battle sounded\r\nappallingly near, and two or three of our guns were in vigorous play\r\nupon the enemy so close on the crest of the bluff that every flash could\r\nbe seen distinctly. Several shells from the enemy's artillery swept by,\r\ncleaving the air many feet above us with that peculiar, fierce, rushing\r\nnoise, which no one, I believe, can hear for the first time without a\r\nquickened beating of the heart and an instinctive impulse of dismay and\r\nawe.\r\n\r\nAt the landing--but how shall I attempt, in words only, to set that\r\npicture forth? The next day's fight was my first experience in actual\r\nbattle, except so much of bushwacking as five months in Western Virginia\r\nhad brought us, but those hours have no such place in my memory as have\r\nthe scenes and sounds of this evening at the landing. I have never yet\r\nseen told in print the half of that sad, sickening story. Wagons, teams,\r\nand led horses, quartermaster's stores of every description, bales of\r\nforage, caissons--all the paraphernalia of a magnificently appointed\r\narmy--were scattered in promiscuous disorder along the bluff-side. Over\r\nand all about the fragmentary heaps thousands of panic-stricken wretches\r\nswarmed from the river's edge far up toward the top of the steep; a mob\r\nin uniform, wherein all arms of the service and wellnigh every\r\ngrade--for even gilt shoulder-straps and scarlet sashes did not lack a\r\nshameful representation there--were commingled in utter, distracted\r\nconfusion; a heaving, surging herd of humanity, smitten with a very\r\nfrenzy of fright and despair, every sense of manly pride, of honor, and\r\nduty, completely paralyzed, and dead to every feeling save the most\r\nabject, pitiful terror. A number of officers could be distinguished amid\r\nthe tumult, performing, with violent gesticulations, the pantomimic\r\naccompaniments of shouting incoherent commands, mingled with threats and\r\nentreaties. There was a little drummer boy, I remember, too, standing in\r\nhis shirt sleeves and pounding his drum furiously, though to what\r\npurpose we could none of us divine. Men were there in every stage of\r\npartial uniform and equipment; many were hatless and coatless, and few\r\nstill retained their muskets and their accoutrements complete. Some\r\nstood wringing their hands, and rending the air with their cries and\r\nlamentations, while others, in the dumb agony of fear, cowered behind\r\nthe object that was nearest them in the direction of the enemy, though\r\nbut the crouching form of a comrade. Terror had concentrated every\r\nfaculty upon two ideas, and all else seemed forgotten: danger and death\r\nwere behind and pressing close upon them; on the other side of the\r\nriver, whither their eyes were turned imploringly, there was the hope of\r\nescape and an opportunity for further flight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, louder than all the din and clamor else, swelled the roar of\r\ncannon and the sharp, continuous rattle of musketry up in the woods\r\nabove. There, other thousands of our comrades--many thousands more they\r\nwere, thank God!--were maintaining an unequal struggle, in which to\r\nfurther yield, they knew, would be their inevitable destruction. Brave,\r\ngallant fellows! more illustrious record than they made who here stood\r\nand fought through all these terrible Sabbath hours need no soldier\r\ncrave. There has been a noble redemption, too, of the disgrace which\r\nShiloh fastened on those poor, trembling fugitives by the riverside.\r\nThat disgrace was not an enduring one. On many a red and stubborn battle\r\nfield those same men have proudly vindicated their real manhood, and in\r\nmaturer military experience have fought their way to a renown abundantly\r\nenough, and more than enough, to cover the derelictions of raw,\r\nuntrained, and not too skilfully directed soldiery.\r\n\r\nThere was a rush for the boat when we neared the landing, and some,\r\nwading out breast deep into the stream, were kept off only at the point\r\nof the bayonet. Close by the water's edge grew a clump of sycamores. Up\r\ninto one of these and far out on a projecting limb, one scared wretch\r\nhad climbed, and, as the boat rounded to, poised himself for a leap upon\r\nthe hurricane deck; but the venture seemed too perilous, and he was\r\nforced to give it up in despair. The plank was quickly thrown out,\r\nguards were stationed to keep the passage clear, and we ran ashore.\r\nUntil now there had been few demonstrations of enthusiasm, but here an\r\neager outburst of shouts and cheers broke forth that wellnigh drowned\r\nthe thunderings of battle. The regiment did not wait to form on the\r\nbeach, the men, as they debarked, rushing up the bank by one of the\r\nwinding roadways. The gaping crowd parted right and left, and poured\r\nupon us at every step a torrent of queries and ejaculations. 'It's no\r\nuse;' 'gone up;' 'cut all to pieces;' 'the last man left in my\r\ncompany;'--so, on all sides, smote upon our ears the tidings of ill.\r\nFewer, but cheery and reassuring, were the welcomes: 'Glad you've come;'\r\n'good for you;' 'go in, boys;' 'give it to 'em, Buckeyes'--which came to\r\nus in manly tones, now and then from the lines as we passed.\r\n\r\nWe gained the summit of the bluff. A few hundred yards ahead they were\r\nfighting; we could hear the cheering plainly, and the woods echoed our\r\nown in response. The Thirty-sixth Indiana had already been pushed\r\nforward toward the extreme left of our line, and were even now in\r\naction. General Nelson had crossed half an hour earlier. The junior\r\nmember of his staff had had a saddle shot from under him by a chance\r\nshell from the enemy, to the serious detriment of a fine dress coat, but\r\nhe himself marvellously escaping untouched. Two field pieces were at\r\nwork close upon our left, firing directly over the heads of our men in\r\nfront; only a random firing at best, and I was glad when an aide-de-camp\r\ngalloped down and put a stop to the infernal din. Amid this scene of\r\nindescribable excitement and confusion, the regiment rapidly formed. Our\r\nknapsacks--were we going into action with their encumbrance? The order\r\nwas shouted to unsling and pile them in the rear, one man from each\r\ncompany being detailed to guard them. It was scarcely more than a\r\nminute's work, and we formed again. A great Valkyrian chorus of shouts\r\nswelled out suddenly along the line, and, looking up, I saw General\r\nNelson sitting on his big bay in front of the colors, his hat lifted\r\nfrom his brow, and his features all aglow with an expression of\r\nsatisfaction and indomitable purpose. He was speaking, but Company B was\r\non the left of the regiment, and, in the midst of the storms of huzzas\r\npealing on every side, I could not catch a single word. Then I heard the\r\ncommands, 'Fix bayonets! trail arms! forward!' and at the double-quick\r\nwe swept on, up through the stumps and underbrush which abounded in this\r\npart of the wood, to the support of the Thirty-sixth Indiana. A few\r\nscore rods were gained, and we halted to recover breath and perfect\r\nanother allignment. The firing in our front materially slackened, and\r\npresently we learned that the last infuriate charge of the enemy upon\r\nour left had been beaten back. We could rest where we lay, 'until\r\nfurther orders.' The sun sank behind the rise off to our right, a broad,\r\nmurky red disk, in a dense, leaden-hued haze; such a sunset as in\r\nspringtime is a certain betokening of rain. By this time cannonading had\r\nentirely ceased, and likewise all musketry, save only a feeble, dropping\r\nfire upon our right. Those sounds shortly died away, and the battle for\r\nthis day was over. Night fell and spread its funereal pall over a field\r\non which, almost without cessation since the dawn of daylight, had raged\r\na conflict which, for its desperation and carnage, had yet had no\r\nparallel in American history.\r\n\r\nOn that field, freely and generously had been poured of the nation's\r\nbest blood, and many a nameless hero had sealed with his life a sublime\r\ndevotion far surpassing the noblest essay of eulogy and all the\r\nextolments which rhetoric may recount. Thank God, those sacrifices had\r\nnot been wholly fruitless! The Army of the Tennessee, although at most\r\nprecious cost, had succeeded in staying those living waves of Southern\r\ntreason until the Army of the Ohio could come up, and Shiloh was saved.\r\nThe next day saw those waves rolled back in a broken, crimson current,\r\nwhose ebb ceased only when the humiliated enemy rested safe within his\r\nfortifications at Corinth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAENONE:\r\n\r\nA TALE OF SLAVE LIFE IN ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWith Sergius there was seldom any interval between impulse and action.\r\nNow, without giving time for explanation, he made one bound to where\r\nCleotos stood; and, before the startled Greek had time to drop the\r\nslender fingers which he had raised to his lips, the stroke of the\r\ninfuriated master's hand descended upon his head, and he fell senseless\r\nat AEnone's feet, with one arm resting upon the lounge behind her.\r\n\r\n'Is my honor of so little worth that a common slave should be allowed to\r\nrob me of it?' Sergius exclaimed, turning to AEnone in such a storm of\r\npassion that, for the moment, it seemed as though the next blow would\r\ndescend upon her.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, though she had ever been used to tremble at his\r\nslightest frown, and though now, in his anger, there might even be\r\nactual danger to her life, she felt, for the moment, no fear. Her\r\nsympathy for the bleeding victim at her feet, of whose sad plight she\r\nhad been the innocent cause, and whose perils had probably as yet only\r\ncommenced--her consciousness that a crisis in her life had come,\r\ndemanding all her fortitude--her indignation that upon such slight\r\nfoundation she should thus be accused of falsity and shame--all combined\r\nto create in her an unlooked-for calmness. Added to this was the\r\ndelusive impression that, as nothing had occurred which could not be\r\nexplained, her lord's anger would not be likely to prolong itself at the\r\nexpense of his returning sense of justice. What, indeed, could he have\r\nwitnessed which she could not account for with a single word? It was\r\ntrue that within the past hour she had innocently and dreamily bestowed\r\nupon the Greek caresses which might easily have been misunderstood; and\r\nthat all the while, the door having been partly open, a person standing\r\noutside and concealed by the obscure gloom of the antechamber, could\r\nhave covertly witnessed whatever had transpired within. But AEnone knew\r\nthat whatever might be her husband's other faults, he was not capable of\r\ncountenancing the self-imposed degradation of espionage. Nor, even had\r\nit been otherwise, could he have been able, if his jealousy was once\r\naroused by any passing incident, to control his impatient anger\r\nsufficiently to await other developments. At the most, therefore, he\r\nmust merely, while passing, have chanced to witness the gesture of\r\nmingled emotion and affection with which Cleotos had bidden her\r\nfarewell. Surely that was a matter which would require but little\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n'Do you not hear me?' cried Sergius, glaring with wild passion from her\r\nto Cleotos and back again to her. 'Was it necessary that my honor should\r\nbe placed in a slave's keeping? Was there no one of noble birth with\r\nwhom you could be false, but that you must bring this deeper degradation\r\nupon my name?'\r\n\r\nAEnone drew herself up with mingled scorn and indignation. His anger,\r\nwhich at another time would have crushed her, now passed almost\r\nunheeded; for the sense of injury resulting from his cruel taunt and\r\nfrom his readiness, upon such slight foundation, to believe her guilty,\r\ngave her strength to combat him. The words of self-justification and of\r\nreproach toward him were at her lips, ready to break forth in\r\nunaccustomed force. In another moment the torrent of her indignant\r\nprotestations would have burst upon him. Already his angry look began to\r\nquail before the steadfast earnestness of her responsive gaze. But all\r\nat once her tongue refused its utterance, her face turned ghastly pale,\r\nand her knees seemed to sink beneath her.\r\n\r\nFor, upon glancing one side, she beheld the gaze of Leta fixedly\r\nfastened upon her over Sergius's shoulder. In the sparkle of those\r\nburning eyes and in the curve of those half-parted lips, there appeared\r\nno longer any vestige of the former pretended sympathy or affection.\r\nThere was now malice, scorn, and hatred--all those expressions which,\r\nfrom time to time, had separately excited doubt and dread, now combining\r\nthemselves into one exulting glance of open triumph, disdainful of\r\nfurther concealment, since at last the long-sought purpose seemed\r\nattained. AEnone turned away with a sickening, heart-breaking feeling\r\nthat she was now lost, indeed. It was no mystery, any longer, that the\r\nslave girl must have listened at the open door, and have cunningly\r\ncontrived that her master should appear at such time as seemed most\r\nopportune for her purposes. And how must every unconscious action, every\r\ninnocent saying have been noted down in the tablets of that crafty mind!\r\nWhat explanation, indeed, could be given of those trivial caresses now\r\nso surely magnified and distorted into evidences of degrading\r\ncriminality?\r\n\r\nFaint at heart, AEnone turned away--unable longer to look upon that face\r\nso exultant with the consciousness of a long-sought purpose achieved.\r\nRather would she prefer to encounter the angry gaze of her lord.\r\nTerrible as his look was to her, she felt that, at the last, pity might\r\nbe found in him, if she could only succeed in making him listen to and\r\nunderstand the whole story. But what mercy or release from jealous and\r\nvindictive persecution could she hope to gain from the plotting Greek\r\ngirl, who had no pity in her heart, and who, even if she were so\r\ndisposed, could not, now that matters had progressed so far, dare to\r\nsurrender the life-and-death struggle? Alas! neither in the face of her\r\nlord could she now see anything but settled, unforgiving pitilessness;\r\nfor though, for an instant, he had quailed before her gaze, yet when she\r\nhad, in turn, faltered at the sight of Leta, he deemed it a new proof of\r\nguilt, and his suspended reproaches broke forth with renewed violence.\r\n\r\n'Am I to have no answer?' he cried, seizing her by the arm. 'Having lost\r\nall, are you now too poor-spirited to confess?'\r\n\r\n'There is nothing for me to confess. Nor, if there had been, would I\r\ndeign to speak before that woman,' she answered with desperation, and\r\npointing toward Leta. 'What does she here? How, in her presence, can you\r\ndare talk of sin--you who have so cruelly wronged me? And has all\r\nmanliness left you, that you should ask me to open my heart to you in\r\nthe presence of a slave; one, too, who has pursued me for weeks with her\r\ntreacherous hate, and now stands gloating over the misery which she has\r\nbrought upon me? I tell you that I have said or done nothing which I\r\ncannot justify; but that neither will I deign to explain aught to any\r\nbut yourself alone.'\r\n\r\n'The same old excuse!' retorted Sergius. 'No harm done--nothing which\r\ncannot be accounted for in all innocence; and yet, upon some poor\r\npretence of wounded pride, that easy explanation will not be vouchsafed!\r\nAnd all the while the damning proof and author of the guilt lies before\r\nme!'\r\n\r\nWith that he extended his foot, and touched the senseless body of\r\nCleotos--striking it carelessly, and not too gently. The effect of the\r\nspeech and action was to arouse still more actively the energetic\r\nimpulses of AEnone--but not, alas! to that bold display of conscious\r\ninnocence with which, a moment before, she had threatened to sweep aside\r\nhis insinuations, and make good her justification. She was now rather\r\ndriven into a passion of reckless daring--believing that her fate was\r\nprejudged and forestalled--caring but little what might happen to\r\nher--wishing only to give way to her most open impulses, let the\r\nconsequences be what they might. Therefore, in yielding to that spirit\r\nof defiance, she did the thing which of all others harmed her most,\r\nsince its immediate and natural result was to give greater cogency to\r\nthe suspicions against her. Stooping down and resting herself upon the\r\nlounge, she raised the head of the still senseless Cleotos upon her lap,\r\nand began tenderly to wipe his lips, from a wound in which a slight\r\nstream of blood had begun to ooze.\r\n\r\n'He and I are innocent,' she said. 'I have treated him as a brother,\r\nthat is all. It is years ago that I met him first, and then he was still\r\nmore to me than now. He is now poor and in misery, and I cannot abandon\r\nhim. Had he been in your place, and you in his, he would not have thus,\r\nwithout proof, condemned you, and then have insulted your lifeless\r\nbody.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment Sergius stood aghast. Excuse and pleading he was prepared\r\nto hear. Recriminations would not have surprised him, for he knew that\r\nhis own course would not bear investigation, and nothing, therefore,\r\ncould be more natural than that she should attempt to defend herself by\r\nbecoming the assailant in turn. But that she should thus defy\r\nhim--before his eyes should bestow endearments upon a slave, the partner\r\nof her apparent guilt, and with whom she acknowledged having had an\r\nintimacy years before, was too astounding for him at first to\r\nunderstand. Then recovering himself, he cried aloud:\r\n\r\n'Is this to be borne? Ho, there, Drumo! Meros! all of you! Take this\r\nwretch and cast him into the prison! See that he does not escape, on\r\nyour lives! He shall feed the lions to-morrow! By the gods, he shall\r\nfeed the lions! Bear him away! Let me not see him again till I see his\r\nblood lapped up in the arena. Away with him, I say!'\r\n\r\nAs the first cry of Sergius rang through the halls, the armor bearer\r\nappeared at the door; and before many more seconds had elapsed, other\r\nslaves, armed and unarmed, swarmed forth from different courts and\r\npassages, until the antechamber was filled with them. None of them knew\r\nwhat had happened, but they saw that, in some way, Cleotos had incurred\r\nthe anger of his master, and lay stunned and bleeding before them. To\r\nobey was the work of a moment. The giant Drumo, stooping down, wound his\r\narm around the body of Cleotos, hoisted him upon his broad shoulder, and\r\nstalked out of the room. The other slaves followed. AEnone, who, in the\r\ndelirium of her defiance, might have tried to resist, was overpowered by\r\nher own attendants, who also had flocked in at Sergius's call, and now\r\ngently forced her from the room. And in a moment more, Sergius was left\r\nalone with Leta.\r\n\r\nShe, crouching in a dark corner of the room, awaited her opportunity to\r\nsay the words which she dared not say while he was in this storm of wild\r\npassion; he, thinking himself entirely alone, stalked up and down like a\r\ncaged tiger, muttering curses upon himself, upon AEnone, upon the slave,\r\nupon all who directly or indirectly had been concerned in his supposed\r\ndisgrace. Let it not be forgotten that, though at first he had acted\r\nhastily and upon slight foundation of proof, and had cruelly wounded her\r\nspirit by abhorrent insinuations, without giving time or opportunity for\r\nher to explain herself, she had afterward given way to an insane\r\nimpulse, and had so conducted herself as to fix the suspicion of guilt\r\nupon herself almost ineffaceably. What further proof could he need?\r\nWhile, with false lips, she had denied all, had she not, at the same\r\ntime, lavished tender caresses upon the vile slave?\r\n\r\nThen, too, what had he not himself done to add to the sting of his\r\ndisgrace? Convinced of her guilt, he should have quietly put her away,\r\nand the truth would have leaked out only little by little, so as to be\r\nstripped of half of its mortification. But he had called up his slaves.\r\nThey had entered upon the scene, and would guess at everything, if they\r\ndid not know it already! The mouths of menials could not be stopped.\r\nTo-morrow all Rome would know that the imperator Sergius, whose wife had\r\nbeen the wonder of the whole city for her virtue and constancy, had been\r\ndeceived by her, and for a low-born slave! Herein, for the moment,\r\nseemed to lie half the disgrace. Had it been a man of rank and celebrity\r\nlike himself--but a slave! And how would he dare to look the world in\r\nthe face--he who had been proud of his wife's unsullied reputation, even\r\nwhen he had most neglected her, and who had so often boasted over his\r\nhappy lot to those who, having the reputation of being less fortunate,\r\nhad complacently submitted themselves to bear with indifference a\r\ndisgrace which, at that age, seemed to be almost the universal doom!\r\n\r\nFrantically revolving these matters, he raged up and down the apartment\r\nfor some moments, while Leta watched him from her obscure corner. When\r\nwould it be time for her to advance and try her art of soothing? Not\r\nyet; for while that paroxysm of rage lasted, he would be as likely to\r\nstrike her as to listen. Once he approached within a few feet of her,\r\nand, as she believed herself observed, she trembled and crouched behind\r\na vase. He had not seen her, but his eye fell upon the vase, and with\r\none blow he rolled it off its pedestal, and let it fall shattered upon,\r\nthe marble floor. Was it simply because the costly toy stood in his way?\r\nOr was it that he remembered it had been a favorite of AEnone? One\r\nfragment of the vase, leaping up, struck Leta upon the foot and wounded\r\nher, but she dared not cry out. She rather crouched closer behind the\r\nempty pedestal, and drew a long breath of relief as, after a moment, he\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\nAt last the violence of his passion seemed to have expended itself, and\r\nhe sank upon the lounge, and, burying his face in his hands, abandoned\r\nhimself to more composed reflection. Now was the time for her to\r\napproach. And yet she would not address herself directly to him, but\r\nwould rather let him, in some accidental manner, detect her presence.\r\nUpon a small table stood a bronze lamp with a little pitcher of olive\r\noil beside it. The wicks were already in the sockets, and she had only\r\nto pour in the oil. This she did noiselessly, as one who has no thought\r\nof anything beyond the discharge of an accustomed duty. Then she lighted\r\nthe wicks and stealthily looked up to see whether he had yet observed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe lamp somewhat brightened the obscurity of the room, sending even a\r\nfaint glimmer into the farther corners, but he took no notice of it.\r\nPerhaps he may have moved his head a little toward the light, but that\r\nwas all. Otherwise there was no apparent change or interruption in his\r\ndeep, troubled thought. Then Leta moved the table with the lamp upon it\r\na few paces toward him, so that the soft light could fall more directly\r\nupon his face. Still no change. Then she softly approached and bent over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhat could he be thinking of? Could he be feeling aught but regret that\r\nhe had thrown away years of his life upon one who had betrayed him so\r\ngrossly at the end? Was he not telling himself how, upon the morrow, he\r\nwould put her away, with all ceremony, forever? And might he not be\r\nreflecting that, AEnone once gone, there would be a vacant place to be\r\nfilled at his table? Would he not wish that it should be occupied\r\nwithout delay, if only to show the world how little his misfortune had\r\naffected him? And who more worthy to fill it than the one whose\r\nfascinations over him had made it empty? Was not this, then, the time\r\nfor her to attract his notice, before other thoughts and interests could\r\ncome between her and him?\r\n\r\nSoftly she touched him upon the arm; and, like an unchained lion, he\r\nsprang up and stared her in the face. There was a terrible look upon his\r\nfeatures, making her recoil in dismay. Was that the affectionate gaze\r\nwith which she had expected to be greeted? Was that the outward\r\nindication of the pleasing resolves with which her eager fancy had\r\ninvested his mind?\r\n\r\nNever had she been more mistaken than in her conceptions of his\r\nthoughts. In them there was for herself not one kindly impulse; but for\r\nthe wife whom he had deemed so erring, there was much that was akin to\r\nregret, if not to returning affection. The violence of his passion had\r\nbeen so exhausting, that something like a reaction had come. A new\r\ncontradiction seemed developing itself in his nature. This man, who a\r\nfew minutes before had prejudged her guilty, because he had seen the\r\nlips of a grateful slave pressed against her hand, now, after having\r\nseen her so aroused and indifferent to reputation as to defend that\r\nslave in her arms, and claim him for at least a friend and brother,\r\nbegan to wonder whether she might not really be innocent. She had\r\nconfessed to nothing--she had asserted her blamelessness--she had never\r\nbeen known to waver from the truth; might she not have been able to\r\nexplain her actions? With his regret for having, in such hasty passion,\r\nso compromised her before the world that no explanation could henceforth\r\nshield her from invidious slander, he now began to feel sorrow for\r\nhaving so roughly used her. Whether she was false or not--whether or not\r\nhe now loved her--was it any the less true that she had once been\r\nconstant and loved by him, and did the memories of that time, not so\r\nvery long ago, bring no answering emotion to his heart? Who, after all,\r\nhad ever so worshipped him? And must he now really lose her? Might it\r\nnot be that he had been made the victim of some conspiracy, aided by\r\nfortuitous elements?\r\n\r\nIt was just at this point, when, in his thoughts, he was stumbling near\r\nthe truth, that the touch of Leta's hand aroused him; and in that\r\ninstant her possible agency in the matter flashed upon him like a new\r\nrevelation. She saw the tiger-like look which he fastened upon her, and\r\nshe recoiled, perceiving at once that she had chosen an inopportune\r\nmoment to speak to him. But it was now too late to recede.\r\n\r\n'Well?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'I have lighted the lamp,' she faltered forth. 'I knew not that I should\r\ndisturb you. Have you further commands for me?'\r\n\r\nStill his fierce gaze fixed upon her; but now with a little more of the\r\ncomposure of searching inquiry.\r\n\r\n'It is you who have brought all this destruction and misery upon me,' he\r\nsaid at length. 'From one step unto another, even to this end, I\r\nrecognize your work. I was a weak fool not to have seen it before.'\r\n\r\n'Is it about my mistress that you speak?' she responded. 'Is it my fault\r\nthat she has been untrue?'\r\n\r\n'If she is false, what need to have told me of it? Was it that the\r\nknowledge of it would make me more happy? And did I give it into the\r\nhands of my own slaves to watch over my honor? Is it a part of your duty\r\nthat for weeks you should have played the spy upon herself and me, so as\r\nto bring her secret faults to light?'\r\n\r\nShe stood silent before him, not less amazed at his lingering fondness\r\nfor his wife than at his reproaches against herself.\r\n\r\n'How know I that she is guilty at all?' he said, continuing the train of\r\nthought into which his doubts and his better nature had led him. 'I must\r\nfeel all this for certain. How do I know but what you have brought it\r\nabout by some cunning intrigue for your own purposes? Speak!'\r\n\r\nFor Leta to stop now was destruction. Though to go on might bring no\r\nprofit to her, yet her safety depended upon closing forever the path of\r\nreconciliation toward which his mind seemed to stray. And step by step,\r\nshrouding as far as possible her own agency, she spread out before him\r\nthat basis of fact upon which she so well knew how to erect a false\r\nsuperstructure. She told him how the intimacy of AEnone and Cleotos had\r\nled her to keep watch--how AEnone had once confessed having had a lover\r\nin the days of her obscurity and poverty--how that this Greek was that\r\nsame lover--and how improbable it was that he could have been domiciled\r\nin that house by chance, or for any other purpose than that of being in\r\na situation to renew former intimacies. She told how, after long\r\nsuspicion, she had settled this identity of the former lover with the\r\nslave--and how she had seen them, in the twilight of that very day,\r\nstanding near the window and addressing each other endearingly by their\r\nown familiar names. As Sergius listened, the evident truthfulness of the\r\nfacts gradually impressed themselves upon him; and no longer doubting\r\nhis disgrace, he closed his heart against all further hope and charity\r\nand affection. The pleasant past no longer whispered its memories to his\r\nheart--those were now stifled and dead.\r\n\r\n'And what reward for all this do you demand?' he hissed forth, seizing\r\nLeta by the arm, 'For of course you have not thus dogged her steps day\r\nafter day, without expectation of recompense from me.'\r\n\r\nDid he mean this--that she was capable of asking reward? Or was he\r\ncunningly trying her nature, to see whether she might prove worthy of\r\nthe great recompense which she had promised herself? It was almost too\r\nmuch now to expect; but her heart beat fast as she saw or fancied she\r\nsaw some strange significance in the gaze which he fastened upon her.\r\nBabbling incoherently, she told how she did not wish reward--how she had\r\ndone it all for love of him--how she would be content to serve him for\r\nlife, with no other recompense than his smile--and the like. Still that\r\ngaze was fastened upon her with penetrating power, more and more\r\nconfusing her, and again she babbled forth the same old expressions of\r\ndisinterested attachment. How it was that at last he understood her\r\nsecret thoughts and aspirations, she knew not. Certainly she had not\r\nspoken, or even seemed to hint about them. But whether she betrayed\r\nherself by some glance of the eye or tremor of the voice, or whether\r\nsome instinct had enabled him to read her, of a sudden he burst into a\r\nwild, hollow laugh of disdain, threw her from him, and cried, with\r\nunutterable contempt:\r\n\r\n'This, then, was the purpose of all! This is what you dreamed of! That\r\nyou, a slave--an hour's plaything--could so mistake a word or two of\r\ntransient love-making as to fancy that you could ever be anything beyond\r\nwhat you are now! Poor fool that thou art!--Oho, Drumo!'\r\n\r\nThe giant entered the room, and Leta again drew back into the closest\r\nobscurity she could find, not knowing what punishment her audacity was\r\nabout to draw upon her. But worse, perhaps, than any other punishment,\r\nwas the discovery that Sergius had already forgotten her; or rather,\r\nthat he thought so little about her as to be able to dismiss her and her\r\npretensions with a single contemptuous rebuke. He had called his armor\r\nbearer for another purpose than to speak of her. A new phase had passed\r\nover his burdened and excited mind. He could not endure that solitude,\r\nwith ever-present disagreeable reflection. And since his disgrace must,\r\nsooner or later, be known, he would brave it out by being himself the\r\nfirst to publish it.\r\n\r\n'Is it not to-morrow that the games begin?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, master,' responded the armor bearer.\r\n\r\n'And does it not--it seems to me that I promised to my friends a banquet\r\nupon the previous night. If I did not, I meant to have done so. Go,\r\ntherefore, and bid them at once come hither! Tell the poet Emilius--and\r\nBassus--and the rest. You know all whom I would have. Let them know that\r\nI hold revel here, and that not one must dare to stay away! Tell my\r\ncooks to prepare a feast for the gods! Go! Despatch!'\r\n\r\nThe giant grinned his knowledge of all that his master's tastes would\r\nrequire, and left the room to prepare for his errand. And in a moment\r\nmore Sergius also departed, without another thought of the Greek girl,\r\nwho stood shrinking from his notice in the shadow of the farthest\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.--NO. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowledge and Action.--It is a common fault of our humanity, when not\r\nsunk too low in the scale of intellect, to seek knowledge rather than\r\nattempt any laborious application of it. We love to add to our stock of\r\nideas, facts, or even notions of things, provided moderate pains will\r\nsuffice; but to put our knowledge in practice is too often esteemed\r\nservile, or eschewed as mere drudgery. Useful activities flatter pride,\r\nand gratify the imagination, too little. But of what avail, ordinarily,\r\nis the possession of truth, unless as light to direct us in the ways of\r\nbeneficent labor, for ourselves and for our fellow men? There are,\r\nindeed, objects of knowledge which elevate the soul in the mere act of\r\ncontemplation; but, in most cases, if what we learn is brought into no\r\ndefinite relation to the practice of life, the acquisition is barren,\r\nand the labor of making it apparently a loss of time and strength.\r\n\r\nThis is no censure upon the course of learning as a process of mental\r\ndiscipline; for this in itself is one of the most productive forms of\r\nhuman activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Song, they say, should be a king,\r\n  Crowned and throned by lightning-legions\r\n    Only they may dare to sing\r\n    Who can hear their voices ring\r\n  Through the echoing thunder-regions.\r\n\r\n    Yet, below the mountain's crest,\r\n  Chime the valley-bells to heaven;\r\n    If we may not grasp the best,\r\n    Deeper, closer, be our quest\r\n  For the good that Fate has given.\r\n\r\n    Parching in its fever pain,\r\n  Many a tortured life is thirsting\r\n    For a cooling draught to drain,\r\n    Though it flash no purple vein\r\n  From the mellow grape-heart bursting.\r\n\r\n    Must our sun-struck gaze despise\r\n  Starry isles in light embosomed?\r\n    Must we close our scornful eyes\r\n    Where the valley lily lies,\r\n  Just because the rose has blossomed?\r\n\r\n    Though the lark, God's perfect strain,\r\n  Steep his song in sunlit splendor;\r\n    Though the nightingale's sweet pain\r\n    With divine despair, enchain\r\n  Dew-soft darks in silence tender;\r\n\r\n    Not the less, from Song's excess,\r\n  Sings the blackbird late and early:\r\n    Nor the bobolink's trill the less\r\n    Laughs for very happiness,\r\n  Gurgling through its gateways pearly.\r\n\r\n    Though we reach not heavenly heights,\r\n  Where the sun-crowned souls sit peerless,\r\n    Let us wing our farthest flights\r\n    Underneath the lower lights;--\r\n  Soar and sing, unfettered, fearless--\r\n\r\n    Sings as bubbling water flows--\r\n  Sing as smiles the summer sunny.\r\n    Royal is the perfect rose,\r\n    Yet, from many a bud that blows,\r\n  Bees may drain a drop of honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said and written in this age and country on the\r\nsubject of what is technically called _woman's rights_; and, in the\r\ncourse of such agitation, many good and true things have been thought\r\nout and made available to the bettering of her condition, besides many\r\nfoolish and impracticable, arising from a too grasping desire for a\r\nwider and more exciting sphere of effort, as well as from a palpable\r\nmisapprehension of their own nature and their legitimate sphere, which\r\nprevails quite extensively among women. The pioneers of the rights of\r\nwoman have done a good work, however, and may well be pardoned wherein\r\nthey have gone beyond what might be fairly and profitably demanded for\r\nour sex. They have called the public attention to the subject, and have\r\nenlisted the thoughts and the services of many earnest men as well as\r\nwomen in their cause; thus provoking that inquiry which will eventually\r\nlead to the finding of the whole truth concerning woman, her rights,\r\nprivileges, duties. And for this, in common with the pioneers in every\r\ncause that has for its object the amelioration and advantage of any\r\nclass of human beings, they deserve the thanks of all. That there should\r\nbe some ultraists, who would not know where to stop in the extravagant\r\nand unsuitable claims they urge, was to be expected. This should not\r\nblind our eyes to the lawful claims of woman upon society, nor is it\r\nsufficient to throw ridicule upon a movement which has, in this day,\r\nindeed, borne its full share of obloquy from the careless, the\r\nthoughtless, the too conservative, all of whom are alike clogs upon the\r\nwheel of human progress.\r\n\r\nThis is not the age nor ours the people to shun the fair discussion of\r\nany question, much less one which commends itself as of practical\r\nimportance. This American people has proved, by the calm and patient\r\nconsideration it has accorded to the advocates of woman's rights, that\r\nit has reached that lofty point in the progress of society at which\r\nwoman is regarded as a positive quantity in the problem which society is\r\nworking out, and it marks an era in the history of the sex, prophetic of\r\nthe full enjoyment of _all_ the rights which are hers by nature, or may\r\nbe hers by favor. I think that in this country, at least, woman has been\r\nput upon a very clear and unobstructed path, with many encouragements to\r\ngo on in the highest course of improvement of which she is capable.\r\nThere seems to be a general disposition to investigate, and to allow her\r\nthe rights she claims--rights of education, of labor, of property, of a\r\nfair competition in any suitable field of enterprise; so that she bids\r\nfair to become as self-supporting, independent, and intelligent as she\r\ndesires. It is true that much is still said of the jealousy and\r\nselfishness of men, leading them to monopolize most of the sources of\r\nprofitable effort to their own use, thus cramping the sphere of woman,\r\nand making her dependent and isolated.\r\n\r\nNow, it is very much a question with me whether, after all, the failure,\r\nso far, to secure these fancied rights, is not quite as much the result\r\nof woman's backwardness and inefficiency as of man's jealous and greedy\r\nmonopoly; whether the greatest obstacle does not lie in the adverse\r\nopinions prevailing among women themselves. According to my observation,\r\nas fast as women have proved themselves adapted to compete with men in\r\nany particular field, their brothers have forthwith striven to make the\r\npath easy and pleasant for them.\r\n\r\nBut there is a natural and necessary jealousy excited when women attempt\r\nto go out of the beaten track, and establish new conditions and\r\nresources for themselves--a jealousy which has its source in the\r\ninstinctive feeling of civilized society, that the standard of womanhood\r\nmust not be lowered; that its safety and progressive well-being depend\r\nupon the immaculate preservation of that pure and graceful ideal of\r\nwomanhood which every true man wishes to see guarded with a vestal\r\nprecision. And society will pause, thoughtfully to consider, before the\r\nstamp of its approbation is affixed to any mode of development by which\r\nthat lofty ideal would suffer. Anything which tends in the least to\r\nunsex, to unsphere woman, by so much works with a reflex influence on\r\nman and on society, and produces in both a gradual and dangerous\r\ndeterioration. And self-preservation is the first instinct of society as\r\nwell as of the individual being. Man, and the eternal and infinite order\r\nof the world, require that woman keep her proper place, and that she\r\ndemand nothing which, granted, would introduce confusion and disorder\r\namong the social forces.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much of woman's rights that I would speak. I am not\r\nafraid but that she will possess these in due time, as fast as her\r\nnature and true place and mission in the world come to be more fully\r\nunderstood. I am far more anxious that she should come into such more\r\nperfect understanding.\r\n\r\nWoman has always been a puzzle, an enigma, to man. When, in the pride of\r\nhis anatomical skill, he has essayed to make her his study, thinking to\r\nmaster the secret of her curious physical being, he has been forced to\r\nstop short of his purpose, dumb and blind in the presence of that\r\nwondrous complexity that no science of his own can master; and no\r\ncasuist has yet solved the _why_ of her equally wonderful and complex\r\nmental and spiritual being. They have made Reason, cold, critical,\r\njudge, the test; but the fine, delicate essence of her real being has\r\nalways eluded it. When Love seeks the solution--the large, generous\r\nLove, that is one day to sit as the judge of all things, supreme over\r\npurblind human Reason--then _she_ will be understood, for she will yield\r\nto the asking of that all-seeing One. This will be when the world is\r\nripe for the advent of woman, who shall rule through love, the highest\r\nrule of all. Slowly, slowly, though surely, is the world ascending,\r\nthrough the wondrous secret chain of _influences_ binding her to the\r\nmoral order of the universe, to the height of this supernal law of love;\r\nand there, in that new and holy kingdom, woman's crown and sceptre await\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut who shall say that a glimmer of this future royal beauty and glory\r\nhas yet dawned upon her?\r\n\r\nIf man has misunderstood woman, she has none the less misunderstood\r\nherself. Indeed, her feet have for ages been treading debatable ground,\r\nthat has shaken beneath her through the clashings of man's ignorance and\r\nher own vague, restless clamors and aimlessness. She has felt the\r\nstirrings within of that real being she was created, but has never dared\r\nto assert herself, or, to speak more truly, has only known to assert\r\nherself in the wrong direction. False voices there have been without\r\nnumber, but not even yet has true womanhood been able, in spite of its\r\nirrepressible longings, to utter that clear, free, elevated speech that\r\nshall yet stir the keenest pulses of the world.\r\n\r\nAs it is, the world has nearly outgrown the petty jealousy, the cool\r\nassumption of inferiority, the flippant criticism of her weaknesses, the\r\ninsulting catering to her foibles, with which woman has been accustomed\r\nto be treated, and which have made her either the slave, the toy, or the\r\nridicule of man; and it is getting to see that she is at least of as\r\nmuch relative importance as man; that without her he will in vain\r\naspire to rise; that, by a law as infallible as that which moves and\r\nregulates the spheres, his condition is determined by hers; that\r\nwherever she has been a slave, he has been a tyrant, and that all\r\noppression and injustice practised upon her has been sure in the end to\r\nrebound upon himself. If there is one thing more than another which, at\r\nany given period and in any particular nation, has pointed to the true\r\nstate of society along the scale of advancement, it has been the degree\r\nof woman's elevation; the undercurrents of history have all set steadily\r\nand significantly in the direction of the truth, which the world has\r\nbeen slow to accept and make use of, indeed, that society nears\r\nperfection only in the proportion in which woman has been honored and\r\nenfranchised; in which she has had opportunity and encouragement to work\r\nand act in her own proper and lawful sphere.\r\n\r\nThose who have gone the farthest in claiming special rights for woman\r\nhave generally based their demands upon a virtual abandonment of the\r\nidea of _sex_, except in a physical sense. Here is a primary,\r\nfundamental error. There is unquestionably a sex of mind, of soul, and\r\nhe who ignores or denies this is, it seems to me, studying his subject\r\nwithout the key which alone will unlock it.\r\n\r\nAnother error which many of the advocates of _woman's rights_ have\r\nfallen into, is that of assuming that those conditions are weaknesses,\r\ndisabilities, which God and nature have attested to be her crowning\r\nglory and power. Or, rather, this second error results naturally and\r\nmost logically from the still more vital one of assuming that her sphere\r\nis intended to be no way different from man's.\r\n\r\nAnd still another, equally false and mischievous, would place her in\r\nantagonism to man upon the question of comparative excellence and of\r\nprecedence in the scale of being.\r\n\r\nA brief analysis of some of the points of difference between the mind\r\nmasculine and the mind feminine will show the futility of confounding\r\nthe two, or of drawing any useless or invidious comparisons. They are as\r\ndistinct in their normal action as any two things can well be. I begin,\r\nthen, by dividing our whole conscious human life into two comprehensive\r\ndepartments, expressed by the generic terms, thought--feeling;\r\nreflection--spontaneity; knowledge--emotion; perception--reception;\r\nreason or intellect--affection or heart. The intelligent being unites\r\nthese conditions--he is supreme in but one. Man reasons--woman feels;\r\nman analyzes--woman generalizes; man reaches his conclusions by\r\ninduction--woman seizes hers by intuition. There is just the difference,\r\n_in kind_, between a man's mind and a woman's that there is between that\r\nof a man of genius and a man of talent. Genius grasps the idea, and\r\nworks from it outward; talent moulds the form in which the already\r\ncreated idea may be embodied. Genius is creative, comprehensive,\r\nintuitive, all-seeing; talent is acute, one-sided, cumulative,\r\ninductive. The men of genius will ever be found to be gifted with this\r\n_womanly_ quality of mind--the power of seizing truth, ideas, with the\r\nheart and soul, through love, rather than with the understanding,\r\nthrough reason.\r\n\r\nWoman understands faith, or the taking things on trust; she has no love\r\nfor that logical process of thought whereby, step by step, man delights\r\nto prove a fact in nature or law with mathematical precision and\r\ncertainty. With the hard details and closely connected steps which make\r\nup the body of any science, mathematical, physical, or metaphysical, she\r\nhas no patience. Her mind is not receptive of formulas or syllogisms.\r\nShe comprehends results, but is incurious as to causes. She knows what\r\nlove or benevolence means, under its triple form of charity, mercy,\r\nmagnanimity, which, like a sea, surrounds the universe; she has no idea\r\nof law and justice, which are the eternal pillars thereof. If man feels\r\nor loves, it is because his reason is convinced; woman's affections go\r\nbeyond reason, and without its aid, into the clear realm of ultimate\r\nbelief. This is why there are so few skeptics in religious things among\r\nour sex. Woman's mental and spiritual constitution render belief or\r\nfaith easy and natural. She is receptive in all the parts of her being.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, that in the outer world of fact, of\r\ndemonstration, of volitions and knowledges, of tangible proofs and\r\ncausalities, of positive and logical effects of reason, of all outward\r\nand material processes, man is supreme; while in that finer, higher,\r\nmore subtile sphere of intuitions, loves, faiths, spiritual convictions,\r\nwhich overtop our actual life, and lead it up from grossness to glory,\r\nwoman is the oracle and priestess. In the basic qualities of our nature\r\nman is stronger--woman, in those which, in grace, beauty, and sweetness,\r\ntaper nicely toward its apex.\r\n\r\nBut are the two spheres therefore at war? By no means. Are they at all\r\nindependent of each other? Are they not rather conjoined indissolubly?\r\nIt is a fatal mistake which places an antagonism between the two. There\r\nshould be between them harmony as sweet as that which moves the\r\nconcentric rings of Saturn. Untaught by the presence and inspiration of\r\nwoman, man becomes a cold, dry petrifaction, constantly obeying the\r\ncentripetal force of his being, and adoring _self_. Without his basal\r\nfirmness and strength, woman, in whom the centrifugal force is stronger,\r\nremains a weak, vacillating, impulsive creature, feebly swayed by the\r\ntides of emotion, lacking self-poise, and aimless and vagrant.\r\n\r\nBut teach her to reason--man to feel; open up to her the sources of\r\nknowledge, and cause him to learn the times of the tides of affection;\r\ncultivate her intellect and his heart, and in the healthy action and\r\nreaction consequent upon such a balance of forces, you have the true\r\nrelationship established between the sexes, the relationship which the\r\nCreator pronounced perfect in the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that while I attribute to woman a certain superiority\r\nboth of nature and function, as to the highest part of the nature common\r\nto both, I at the same time assert her inferiority in what may be called\r\nits fundamental attributes, those which lie nearest to the constant and\r\nsuccessful prosecution of mundane affairs, and, consequently, I also\r\nestablish the fact of her absolute and inevitable dependence in such\r\nsense on man. But do I thus degrade her, or in effect annul this\r\nasserted superiority? Because man, and the strength, amplitude, and\r\nstability of his more practical nature, form a sure basis upon which she\r\nmay rest, do I any the less make her the very crown and perfection of\r\nGod's human handiwork? Assuredly not. The truth is, if, instead of\r\nmaking comparison where, from the nature of the case, comparison is\r\nalmost precluded, so great is the difference between them, I were to say\r\nthat each is the complement or counterpart of the other, and that,\r\nalone, each is but a half sphere, and imperfectly rounded at that, I\r\nshould more nearly approach to accuracy. To make the perfect whole which\r\nthe Creator had in His idea, the two halves must be united. And so I\r\ndignify the oldest of human institutions--marriage. I accord to it the\r\nvery perfection of wisdom, beauty, utility, adaptation. I am aware that\r\nin so speaking I hold to an old-fashioned belief, and tread\r\nincontinently, not only on a notion afloat among some of the\r\n_strong-minded_ of my sex at the present day, that this institution is\r\nnothing more nor less than an engine of selfish and despotic power on\r\nthe one hand, and of slavish subjection on the other; but on the more\r\nmoderate idea that it is not desirable for all women, nor even for a\r\nmajority. But I still think that this state of union is the most\r\nnatural, beneficent, satisfying condition possible for all of both\r\nsexes--the condition most conducive to the highest, widest, happiest\r\ndevelopment of the individual man or woman, especially the latter, for\r\nit is through marriage only, through the beautiful and sacred wifehood\r\nand motherhood which that institution guarantees in purity and holiness,\r\nthat woman's highest nature finds scope and opportunity. And I make no\r\nexceptions. On the contrary, I should say that the exceptions which\r\nmight occur should invariably be counted as misfortunes. Not that many\r\ngood, true, noble women do not live and die unmarried. _Circumstances_,\r\nthat inflexible arbiter of human life, as it often seems, may strangely\r\nturn into wide and unaccustomed channels the love, the devotion, the\r\nenergy, the self-sacrifice, that, in their pure, strong action, make\r\nwoman's best development, and so the world, the needy people of the\r\nworld, humanity at large, may receive the immediate benediction of it.\r\nLet no woman who, alone it may be, goes steadfastly on her way of duty\r\nand self-abnegation, think she has lived in vain because the special lot\r\nof woman has been denied her. If not happiness, which comes from content\r\nand satisfaction, yet there is something higher, diviner still, arising\r\nfrom duty done and trials endured--blessedness. But such exceptions do\r\nnot, I conceive, invalidate the general fact that marriage was intended\r\nto be the channel for the vast aggregate of human happiness and\r\nimprovement. I speak of marriage as it should be, as it might be, as it\r\nwill one day be, when men and women have acquainted themselves with the\r\nlaws, physical and spiritual, which were intended to adjust these unions\r\nbetween the sexes in a harmonious manner, according to natural\r\nsympathies and affinities; laws, infallible, inherent in the individual\r\nconstitution, and which, if understood and enforced, would obviate much\r\nof the sin, misfortune, and misery in the earth. It is a great and\r\ncurious question, how much of the pain, suffering, and evil so rife\r\namong men, is due to the one-sided, blindfold, inconsiderate, and\r\nunsuitable marriages every day taking place; filling the homes of the\r\nland with discontent, bickerings, disorder, and continual strife, from\r\nthe jostling together of antipathetic elements; cursing society with the\r\ninfluences derived from character formed and nurtured in such pestilent\r\ndomestic atmospheres; and sending out thousands of unhealthy,\r\nmisorganized, wrongly educated beings, the fruit of these _dis_unions,\r\nto work ill both to themselves and their race. The world has much yet to\r\nlearn with regard to the conditions necessary to a true and legitimate\r\nmarriage of the sexes. There are thousands of illegal unions that have\r\nbeen blessed by church and magistrate, which yet carry only ban in their\r\ntrain. Whether read literally or not, the old, old story of the\r\ntemptation and the fall has a significance not often dreamed of in\r\nrespect to this question of marriage. It was a disturbance of the pure\r\nand perfect allegiance of each to the other, no less than a fall from\r\nthe intimate communion of both with the Father of spirits. And a thicker\r\ndarkness rests over the means whereby the institution of marriage may be\r\nrescued from its degradation, and man and woman be reinstated in the\r\nloyalty they owe to each other, than over the means by which the\r\ncreature may make himself acceptable to the offended Creator; inasmuch\r\nas the former is left, without any special revelation, to the slow\r\nprocess of thought among men, to the workings of experience and the\r\nresults of observation. And these laws are age-long in their evolutions.\r\nBut when men and women have learned to look within themselves, have\r\nturned an intelligent eye upon the necessities of their threefold\r\nbeing, and when they recognize the God-made laws regulating these\r\nnecessities, and have begun to mate themselves accordingly, the world\r\nwill have received a powerful impulse toward its promised millennial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, being, in brief, the relation of woman to man, it is\r\nnecessary to inquire, as pertinent to my subject, not so much whether\r\nman gives her all the rights within his own sphere which she may\r\nbeneficially claim, but whether she has yet understood the weight and\r\nsignificance of her own position in the scale of being, and has\r\nexercised all the rights consequent therefrom. To know is far easier\r\nthan to live according to knowledge. It is to be feared that women\r\nthemselves have but a poor appreciation of the ideal of true womanhood.\r\nOh, is it not time this ideal should be worthily understood? Has not\r\npoor suffering humanity borne the burden of its woes long enough, and\r\nwill not woman help to lift it from the tired, stooping shoulders? For\r\nshe may. How? Simply by working out her own divinely appointed mission.\r\nAnd is this not broad and absorbing enough? See what are some of its\r\nobjects of influence and endeavors. First, here are the very faintest\r\nbeginnings of intelligent existence to impress and mould--the embryos of\r\ncharacter to stamp. And who knows how important this moulding and\r\nstamping may be? To go farther back still: Who knows what indelible\r\nconstitution may be, is, fixed upon the individual organism, for better,\r\nfor worse, by the authors of its life, that, if evil, no training, no\r\neducation, no work of grace, not even omnipotence, can expunge or alter?\r\nThis motherhood of woman, in its awful sanctity and mystery, in its\r\nbearings upon the immortality of personal identity, is a fearful\r\ndignity. Therein consists the first and chief claim of Woman to honor\r\nand reverence. She who has been a mother has measured the profoundest as\r\nwell as the most exalted experience of which humanity is susceptible.\r\nLet her see to it that she honor herself.\r\n\r\nHere is the white and plastic tablet of the new-born soul. Let woman\r\nfear and tremble to write on that, for the writing shall confront her\r\nforever. Like the Roman Pilate, _what she has written, she has written_.\r\nHere are the purblind human instincts to direct and culture; the\r\nvagrant, unbridled hosts of the spontaneous emotions to be tutored and\r\nrestrained; the affections and the tastes to be trained toward the true,\r\nthe beautiful, and the good; the warring passions to be curbed and\r\ndisciplined; in short, the whole glorious domain of the heart and soul,\r\nthe moral and spiritual nature, is to be surveyed, studied, swayed by\r\nthat potential agency which woman possesses in a very eminent\r\ndegree--personal influence. By this agency, informed and vitalized by\r\nlove, she becomes the great educator in the great school of life, in the\r\nfamily, in society, in the world. Women do not sufficiently appreciate\r\nthe importance of their work as the architects of character.\r\n_Character!_ That, after all, is the man, the enduring individual, the\r\nreal _I_, to whom the Creator has said, _Live forever_! Character is\r\nsimply what education and habit make of a person, starting from the\r\nfoundation of his inherited organic idiosyncrasies. It is a result--the\r\nwork of time and countless shapings and impressings. It is not what a\r\nman thinks of himself, nor what others think of him, but _what he really\r\nis in the sight of God, his Maker_. This is what shall come out, at\r\nlast, from the obscurations and uncertainties of this lower atmosphere\r\ninto the clear, truthful light of eternity; shall cast off the devices,\r\nthe flimsy pretences, the temporary shows, the convenient disguises, of\r\nthis mortal life of mixed substance and shadow, and stand a bare, naked,\r\nunclothed fact of being before itself, the universe, and God. Alas! what\r\nmultitudes of real dwarfs go out every day, 'unhouseled,' into that\r\nsearching light of eternity.\r\n\r\nTo be the builder of a fair and comely character; to chisel out a work\r\nthat shall please the eye of God Himself, in whose estimation Beauty,\r\nbeing His own attribute, is a most holy thing; to see that work of\r\nbeauty take its place in the well-filled gallery of eternity, and to\r\nknow that it is your own immortal monument--is this not scope enough,\r\nhonor enough, praise and glory enough? If women would but rise to the\r\nheight of their real mission, and faithfully and earnestly assume the\r\nrights and fulfil the duties which God has specially devolved upon them,\r\nthey would so lead man and society up to a higher point that the claims\r\nthey put forth need not be discussed for an hour; because, then, having\r\nproved their adaptability to make good use of every lawful right,\r\nsociety, which in the end always adjusts its forces properly and\r\ninstinctively, will have tacitly fallen into the necessity or the\r\nfeasibility of granting them.\r\n\r\nLet man erect his scientific formulas, his schools of philosophy, his\r\nstructures of reason and thought; let him bid the giant forces of nature\r\ngo in harness for his schemes of improvement or aggrandizement; and by\r\nall means let the intellect of woman be cultivated to comprehend\r\nintelligently the marvels of man's work; let her, if she will, measure\r\nthe stellar distances, study the mechanical principles or the learned\r\nprofessions, make a picture or write a book; and there have been women,\r\ntrue and noble women, who have done all these, women who have proved\r\nthemselves capable of as high attainments, as keen and subtile thought\r\nas man; but let her never for such as these abdicate her own nobler\r\nwork, neglecting the greater for the less. If a woman has a special\r\ngift, let her exercise it; if she has a particular mission, let her work\r\nit out. Few women, though, are of this elect class. I do not despise,\r\nbut rather encourage, natural gifts. But I would have women never forget\r\nthat it is not for what they may possibly add to the sum of human\r\nknowledge that the world values them, primarily. _That_ some man is as\r\nlikely to do as not; but what women fail to do in their own peculiar\r\nsphere, _no man can possibly do_.\r\n\r\nWhen I aver that woman was intended to be a predominant influence in the\r\nworld through her moral and spiritual being, principally, I must not be\r\nunderstood as depreciating the value to her of mere subjective\r\nknowledge. So far from this, I believe that her means of acquiring\r\nknowledge of all kinds should be limited only by her capacity. The more\r\nher intellect is enlightened and disciplined, the better will she be\r\nqualified to exert that refining, elevating influence which is expected\r\nof her. There can be no beauty without the element of strength; there\r\ncan be no love worth the name without knowledge. Were her sense of\r\njustice, her logical powers, her reflective faculties carefully trained\r\nand exercised, her peculiar womanly graces of soul would shine with\r\ntenfold lustre. I mean, simply, that knowledge is specially valuable to\r\nher objectively--as a means, and the best means, to the highest end of\r\nher being, which is concrete rather than abstract.\r\n\r\nBriefly, I say, then, it is in the great departments of ethics, of\r\naesthetics, of religious and spiritual things, that woman is a vital\r\npower in human life.\r\n\r\nI have thrown out these general preliminary thoughts concerning the\r\nnature of woman, and her relations to man and to society, chiefly with\r\nreference to a phase of the subject which has not seemed to engage the\r\nattention either of women themselves or of those who assume to advocate\r\ntheir cause. It is the important consideration whether, in a free and\r\nrepublican land, woman holds any certain and special relation toward the\r\nGovernment. In other words, have American women any vital share or\r\ninterest in this grand, free Government of ours? With all the emphasis\r\nof a profound conviction, I, answer, _Yes_. Such a touching and intimate\r\ninterest as no women ever had before in any Government under the sun.\r\nAnd why?\r\n\r\n_Because the principles embodied in and represented by it have made her\r\nwhat she is, and they alone can make her what she hopes to be._\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the position of woman in society is a sure test of\r\nits civilization, then is our American society already in the van of\r\nprogress. Nowhere else in the world is woman so free, so respected, so\r\nobeyed, so beloved; nowhere else is the ideal of womanhood so\r\nchivalrously worshipped and protected. In the spirit of our political\r\ntheory, that no class of society is to be regarded as permanently and\r\nnecessarily disabled from progress and elevation--to which, in our\r\npractice, we have hitherto made but _one_ wicked and shameful\r\nexception--and under the influence of the powerful tendency of our\r\nsystem to _individualism_, woman has been allowed a freedom heretofore\r\nunparalleled, and _onward and upward_ is still the word.\r\n\r\nI do not claim perfection for our system. But I say we have the germs of\r\nthe healthiest national development. All that remains is to carry\r\nforward those germs to maturity, and let them show their legitimate\r\nresults unhampered. That is what we want, what we claim. Society here is\r\nunformed, in the rough. We lack the outward grace and polish belonging\r\nonly to old societies. We shall yet attain these, as well as some other\r\ndesirable things; but I believe that in no other country in the world is\r\nthere so much genuine, delicate, universal devotion manifested for woman\r\nas among the Americans. Have you seen a boy of fourteen, shy, awkward,\r\nuncouth in manner, rough in speech, but with a great, tender heart\r\nthumping in his bosom? And did you know of the idolatrous worship he\r\ncould not wholly conceal for some fair, sweet, good girl older than\r\nhimself, a woman, even--a worship, which was not love, if love be other\r\nthan a high and tender sentiment, but which was capable of filling his\r\nbeing to overflow with its glory and richness? I liken our American\r\nchivalry to this. And it is this instinctive natural politeness of our\r\nmen toward women that, as much as anything else, keeps us from being\r\nrude and unrefined while yet in our first adolescence.\r\n\r\nI am aware that, hitherto, the South has laid claim to the lion's share\r\nof this gallant spirit, as it has of many other polite and social\r\nqualities. But we do not so readily now, as a few years ago, yield to\r\nthese Southern assumptions. We know now for just how much they stand.\r\nAnd we know, too, in the better light of this hour, that it is not\r\npossible for a very high and pure ideal of womanhood to be conceived in\r\nthe atmosphere of a system which, as slavery does, persistently, on\r\nprinciple, and on a large scale, degrades a portion of the sex, no\r\nmatter how weak, poor, defenceless. Rather, the more defenceless the\r\ngreater is the wrong, the shame. I am not lauding that gallantry which\r\nstands in polite posture in the presence of a lady, hat in hand, and\r\nwith its selectest bow and smile, and in the same breath turns to commit\r\nthe direst offences against the peace and purity of womanhood; but that\r\ntrue and hearty, though simple and unostentatious, reverence for the\r\nsex, that teaches men to regard all women as worthy of freedom, respect,\r\nand protection, simply by virtue of their womanhood. I say not that this\r\nchivalry is a Southern, but that it is an _American_ trait. As such I am\r\nproud of it.\r\n\r\nBut does this high and honored place they hold in the hearts of their\r\ncountrymen devolve no corresponding responsibility upon American women?\r\nIs it not a momentous inquiry how far they fall short of the high and\r\ncommanding standard of thought and action demanded of them in order to\r\nmeet this heavy obligation? It seems to me that the time is fully ripe\r\nfor the clearer perception of the fact, that because women are not men,\r\nit does not follow that they are not in an important sense citizens. And\r\nthis, without any reference to the question whether they should be\r\npermitted to vote and to legislate; though, as to the former, I do not\r\nknow of a single valid objection to the exercise of the privilege, while\r\nthere are several weighing in its favor; and as to the latter, it seems\r\nto me that one single consideration would forever, under the present\r\nconstitution of things, debar her from a share in direct and positive\r\nlegislation. It is as follows: The central idea of all properly\r\nconstituted society, without which society would be an incoherent chaos,\r\nand governments themselves but the impotent lords of anarchy and\r\nmisrule, is _the home_. Of the home, woman, from the very nature of the\r\ncase, is the inspiriting genius, the ever-present and ever-watchful\r\nguardian. And the home, with its purities, its sanctities, its\r\nretiracies, its reticences, is far removed from the noise and wranglings\r\nof popular assemblies, the loud ambitions and selfish chicaneries of\r\npolitical arenas. The very foundation, pivotal ideas of human nature\r\nwould be undermined by such publicity. The value of the home, as the\r\nnursery of whatever is pure, lovely, holy in the human soul, rests\r\nabsolutely on the preservation of the modest purity and grace of woman.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is woman's influence as a citizen in a republican land to be\r\nexercised, if she be excluded from positive legislation? I answer, by\r\nthe moral effect of her personal influence in the formation of mind and\r\ncharacter; by her work as the great educator in the home and in society.\r\nIf hers be not a moral and spiritual influence, it is none at all for\r\ngood. And of all the powers for good in a republic, this is the\r\nstrongest, most beneficent, did woman rightly comprehend the issue.\r\n\r\nThe purity, safety, and perpetuity of a free government rest,\r\nultimately, not so much on forms of law, on precedents, on the\r\nascendency of this or that party or administration, but on the\r\nintelligence, morality, and devotion to freedom of the people. What\r\nshould woman care to legislate, when she may wield such an engine of\r\npower as education puts into her hands; when she may mould the minds and\r\ninspire the souls of those who are to be the future legislators; when\r\nshe may, even now, put forth a direct and immediate influence upon those\r\nwho are the legislators of the present time? For her influence on\r\nsociety is twofold, direct and reflex, present and prospective; it is\r\nthe most powerful known, the most subtile and secret and determining,\r\nviz., _personal_ influence.\r\n\r\nTo this end, therefore, that she may influence in the right direction,\r\nwomen need to inform themselves, to acquire a knowledge of the\r\nprinciples on which our system rests, and to become thoroughly imbued\r\nwith their spirit. This will necessitate an acquaintance with the nature\r\nand details of our political creed, of which our women, especially, are\r\nlamentably ignorant. How many out of every hundred, do you suppose, have\r\neven read the Constitution, for instance? You may say that the majority\r\nof men have never studied it either, even of the voters. I admit the\r\nfact. There is a terrible lack of information among even men on public\r\nsubjects. But I think this: if women were to educate themselves and\r\ntheir children, all whom they influence, indeed, to make these subjects\r\na matter of _personal interest_, instead of regarding them as foreign\r\nmatters, well enough for lawyers and politicians, perhaps, to\r\nunderstand, or for those who expect to fill office, but of no manner of\r\nimportance to a person in strictly private life, this ignorance would\r\ncome to an end. This shifting of personal responsibility by the great\r\nmajority is the bane of our system. The truth is, no one, in a\r\nrepublican government, can lead an absolutely private career. As one who\r\nexercises the elective franchise, or one who influences the same, be it\r\nman or woman, there is no dodging the responsibility of citizenship. A\r\nbetter State of information on public affairs, also, will induce a\r\ncorrect conception of a certain class of ideas which, more than any\r\nothers, perhaps, tend to strengthen, deepen, broaden, solidify the\r\nmental powers--ideas of absolute law and justice. As I have before said,\r\nthe female mind is deficient in this particular.\r\n\r\nTo understand their government and institutions, then, is the first step\r\nin the attainment of the standard demanded of American women; or, in\r\nother words, an increase of political knowledge--a more thorough\r\npolitical education.\r\n\r\nAnother step is, the enlargement and strengthening of their patriotism.\r\nThe former step, too, will conduce to this, and be its natural\r\nconsequence. I do not mean alone that loose and vagrant sentiment which\r\ncommonly passes for patriotism, which is aroused at some particular\r\noccasion and slumbers the rest of the time; which is spasmodic,\r\ntemporary, impulsive, and devoid of principle; but that love of country\r\nfounded on knowledge and conviction; a living faith of the heart based\r\nupon duty and principle; and which is, therefore, all-pervading,\r\nabiding, intelligent, governing thought and action, and conforming the\r\nlife to the inner spirit. That sort of patriotism that lives as well in\r\npeace time as in war time; that makes the heart throb as sympathetically\r\nin behalf of country every day in the year as on the Fourth of July;\r\nthat leads us to conform our habits of life and thought to the spirit of\r\nour institution and policy; that makes us as jealous of the honor, the\r\nconsistent greatness of our country when all men speak well of her, as\r\nwhen her foes are bent upon her destruction. This _habit of mind_ is\r\nwhat I mean, rather than any transient emotion of heart; an enlightened\r\nand habitual spirit of patriotism.\r\n\r\nI give American women all credit due them for the patriotic temper they\r\nhave evinced since this war began. I say that never have women showed\r\nmore loyalty and zeal for country than the women of the North. Let\r\nsanitary fairs and commissions, let soldiers' aid societies from one end\r\nof the land to the other, and in every nook and corner of it, let our\r\nhospitals everywhere attest this heartfelt love and devotion on the part\r\nof our women. It is a noble spectacle, and my heart thrills at the\r\nthought of it. We have many noble ones who will stand in history along\r\nwith England's Florence Nightingale and the 'Mother of the Gracchi,'\r\nthose eternally fair and tender women, fit for the love and worship of\r\nthe race. The want is not in the feeling of patriotism, but in the\r\nhabitual principle and duty of the same. Since the war began, the fire\r\nhas not slackened. But how was it before the war, and how will it be\r\nafter it?\r\n\r\nTo prove what I say, let me dwell a moment on two or three of the most\r\nprominent faults of our women, pronounced such by all the world. Of\r\nthese, the most mischievous and glaring, the most ruinous in thousands\r\nof cases, is _extravagance_. Wastefulness is almost become a trait of\r\nour society. American women, especially, are profuse and lavish of money\r\nin dress, in equipage, in furniture, in houses, in entertainments, in\r\nevery particular of life. Everywhere this foolish and wasteful use of\r\nmoney challenges the surprise and sarcasm of the observant foreign\r\ntourist through our country. Perhaps the largeness and immensity of our\r\nland, its resources and material, as well as the wonderful national\r\nadvance we have already made, tends to cultivate in our people a feeling\r\nof profusion and a habit of extravagant display; but it is not in\r\nsympathy either with our creed or our profession.\r\n\r\nWere the money thus heedlessly expended made for them by slaves whom\r\nthey had from infancy been taught to regard as created solely to make\r\nmoney for them to use and enjoy, this extravagant waste of money, while\r\nnone the less selfish and inexcusable, would appear to grow\r\nspontaneously out of the arbitrary rule of slavery; or, if it had\r\ndescended to them by legal or ancestral inheritance, there might be some\r\nshow of reason for using it carelessly, though very small sense in so\r\ndoing. But in a land where labor is the universal law; where, if a man\r\nmakes money, he must work and sweat for its possession; when fortunes do\r\nnot arise by magic, but must be built up slowly, painfully, at the\r\nexpense of the nerve and sinew, the brain and heart of the builders, and\r\nthese builders, not slaves, but our fathers, husbands, brothers; when a\r\nclose attention to money-making is rapidly becoming a national badge,\r\nand is in danger of eating out entirely what is of infinitely more value\r\nthan wealth--a high national integrity and conscience--and of sinking\r\nthe immaterial and intellectual in the material and sensual; in such\r\ncircumstances as these, I say, and under such temptations and dangers,\r\nit is a sin, an unnatural crime, to squander what costs so dear.\r\n\r\nVolumes might be written upon the frightful consequences of this\r\nextravagance in money matters, this living too fast and beyond their\r\nmeans, of which American women, especially, are guilty. Great financial\r\ncrises, in which colossal schemes burst like bubbles, and vast estates\r\nare swallowed up like pebbles in the sea; commercial bankruptcies, in\r\nwhich honorable names are bandied on the lips of common rumor, and white\r\nreputations blackened by public suspicion; minds, that started in life\r\nwith pure and honest principles, determined to win fortune by the\r\nstraight path of rectitude, gradually growing distorted, gradually\r\nletting go of truth, honor, uprightness, and ending by enthroning gold\r\nin the place made vacant by the departed virtues; hearts, that were once\r\nresponsive to the fair and beautiful in life and in the universe, that\r\nthrobbed in unison with love, pity, kindness, and were wont to thrill\r\nthrough and through at a noble deed or a fine thought, now pulseless and\r\nhard as the nether millstone; souls, that once believed in God, heaven,\r\ngood, and had faith and hope in immortality, now worshipping commercial\r\nsuccess and its exponent, money, and living and dying with their eager\r\nbut fading eyes fixed earthward, dustward!\r\n\r\nOh, it is a fearful thought that woman's extravagant desires and demands\r\nmay thus kill all that is best and highest in those who should be her\r\nnearest and dearest. Yet, if this wide-spread evil of wastefulness is to\r\nbe checked, it must be begun in the home, and by its guardian, woman.\r\nThere is a movement lately inaugurated, looking to retrenchment in the\r\nmatter of unnecessary expenditure, which, if it is to be regarded other\r\nthan as a temporary expedient, is worthy of the patriotic enthusiasm\r\nwhich called it forth. I allude to the dress-reform movement made by the\r\nloyal women of the great Northern cities. The _spirit_ of this movement\r\nI could wish to see illustrated both during the continuance of and after\r\nthe war. It is this economical habit of mind for the sake of patriotic\r\nprinciple, that I regard as a great step in the attainment of the\r\ndesired standard for American women.\r\n\r\nAnother plain fault of our women, and one which in a measure is the\r\ncause of the fault above noticed, is the wild chase after and copying of\r\nEuropean fashions. We are accused of being a nation of copyists. This is\r\nmore than half true. And why we should be, I cannot understand. Are we\r\n_never_ to have anything original, American? Are we always to be\r\ncontent to be servile imitators of Europe in our art, literature,\r\nsocial life, everything, except mere mechanical invention? I am thankful\r\nthat we are beginning to have an art, a literature, of our very own. Let\r\nus also have a _fashion_, that shall be, distinctively, if not entirely,\r\nAmerican. There is surely enough of us, of our splendid country, our\r\ninstitutions, our theories, our brave, free people, to build for\r\nourselves, from our own foundation, and with our own material. But\r\nAmerican Women have yet to inspire society with this patriotic ambition.\r\n\r\nNot what is becoming or suitable to her, but what is _the fashion_, does\r\nthe American woman buy; not what she can afford to purchase, but what\r\nher neighbors have, is too commonly the criterion. This constant pursuit\r\nof Fashion, with her incessant changes, this emulation of their\r\nneighbors in the manifold ways in which money and time can be alike\r\nwasted, and not the necessary and sacred duties of home, the personal\r\nattention and effort which the majority of American women have to give\r\nto their household affairs, produce that _lack of time_ that is offered\r\nas an excuse for the neglect of the duty of self-culture. This it is\r\nwhich fritters away thought and the taste for higher things, leaving the\r\nmind blank and nerveless except when thus superficially excited.\r\n\r\nThis duty of _self-culture_ I would notice as one of the demands of the\r\ntimes upon American women in the attainment of the proposed standard. A\r\nwide, liberal, generous self-culture, of intellect, of taste, of\r\nconscience, for the sake of the better fulfilment of the mission to\r\nwhich, as an American citizen, every woman in the land is called. We do\r\nnot begin to realize this. It is a great defect in our social system,\r\nthat, when a woman has left school and settled down in life, she\r\nconsiders it the signal for her to quit all mental acquisition except\r\nwhat she may gather from her desultory reading, and, henceforth, her\r\nfamily and her immediate neighborhood absorb her whole soul under\r\nordinary circumstances. The great majority of our countrywomen thus grow\r\ncareworn, narrow-minded, self-absorbed. Now this is not right--it is not\r\nnecessary. A woman's first, most important duty is in her home; but this\r\nneed not clip the wings of her spirit, so that thought and affection\r\ncannot go out into the great world, and feel themselves a part of its\r\nrestless, throbbing, many-sided life; brain and heart need not stagnate,\r\neven if busy, work-a-day life does claim her first endeavors. Indeed,\r\nthe great danger to our women is not so much that they will become\r\ntrifling and frivolous, as that they will become narrow-minded and\r\nselfish.\r\n\r\nBut these vices of extravagance and excessive devotion to fashion, of\r\nwhich I have spoken, are due, largely, to a still more radical defect in\r\nour social education. I mean its _anti-republican spirit_. This is our\r\ncrowning absurdity. We are good democrats--in theory. It is a pity that\r\nour practice does not bear out our theory, for the sake of the homely\r\nvirtue of consistency. To a great many otherwise sensible people our\r\nsimple republican ways are distasteful, and they are apt to look with,\r\nadmiring, envious eyes on the conventional life of foreign lords, not\r\nconsidering how burdened with forms it is, and full of the selfishness,\r\nthe pride and arrogance of the privileged and titled few, at the bitter\r\nexpense of the suffering, untitled many. The aping of aristocratic\r\npretensions has been a much-ridiculed foible of American women. It is\r\ncertain that American society needs republicanizing in all its grades.\r\nWe have widely departed from the simplicity of the early days and of the\r\nfounders of the republic, in social life, just as in our political\r\ncourse we had suffered the vital essence of our organic law to become a\r\ndead thing, and the whole machinery of the Government to work reversely\r\nto its intention. And the cause has been the same in each case. The\r\nspirit of a government and the theories embodying it are the reflection\r\nof the social condition of a given age and people, so that the one will\r\nnever be of a higher order than the other; while it is, also, equally\r\ntrue, that the best and most advanced political theories may be suffered\r\nto languish in operation, or become wholly dormant, from the influence\r\nof social causes. Thus it was that the demoralising effect of human\r\nslavery did, up to the time of the great shock which the nation received\r\nin the spring of 1861--a shock which galvanized it into life, and sent\r\nthe before vitiated blood coursing hotly, and, at last, healthfully\r\nthrough all the veins and arteries of the national body--persistently\r\nencroach alike upon Government and society. The slime of that serpent\r\nwas over everything in the North as well as the South, and if it did not\r\nkill out the popular virtue and patriotism as completely here as there,\r\nwhere it is intimately interwoven with the life of the people, the\r\ndifference is due to that very cause, as well as to the inextinguishable\r\nvitality that God has conferred on the genius of human liberty, so that\r\nwhen betrayed, hunted, starved, outlawed, she yet seeks some impregnable\r\nfastness, and subsists on manna from the Divine Hand. This, then, is the\r\nfourth step in the attainment of the true ideal of character for\r\nAmerican women--_the effort to renew society in the actual simplicity of\r\nour republican institutions_. Women, American women, should hold dear as\r\nanything in life the preservation and purity of those blessed\r\ninstitutions, guaranteeing to them as they do all their eminent\r\nprivileges, and founded as they are on that emancipating genius of\r\nChristianity, which, through every age, has pointed a finger of hope,\r\nlove, encouragement to woman as a chief instrument in the world's\r\npromised elevation and enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nWhile dwelling upon the faults of American women, I would at the same\r\ntime do full credit to their virtues. I believe that they occupy as high\r\na place as any women in the world, even a higher. But I trust that they\r\nwill rise to the height of the demands which the changed times and the\r\nexigencies of the situation are pressing upon them, and will continue to\r\npress. This war has clearly and forcibly eliminated truths and\r\nprinciples which the long rule of the slave power had wellnigh eclipsed;\r\nit has been a very spear of Ithuriel, at whose keen touch men and\r\nprinciples start up in their real, not their simulated character. During\r\nits three years of progress, the national education has been advanced\r\nbeyond computation. When it is over, things, ideas, will not go back to\r\nthe old standpoint. Then will arise the new conditions, demands,\r\npossibilities. If there is one truth that has been unmistakably\r\ndeveloped by the war, it is the controlling moral power and sanction\r\nwhich a free government derives from woman. And this has been shown not\r\nonly in the influence for good which the loyal women of the North have\r\ncontributed for the aid of the Government, but with equal power in the\r\ninfluence for evil which the Southern women have exerted for its\r\ndestruction. I suppose it is true that this war for slavery has received\r\nits strongest, fiercest continuing impulses from the women of the South.\r\nNothing could exceed the enthusiasm, the persistency, the heroic\r\nendurance, the self-sacrifice they have manifested. Only had it been in\r\na good cause!\r\n\r\nJust here let me say a word in behalf of these Southern women. There is\r\na disposition on the part of the Northern public, forming their opinion\r\nfrom the instances of fierce spite and vindictiveness, of furious scorn\r\nand hatred, which have been chronicled in the reports of army\r\ncorrespondents and in the sensation items of the newspapers, to regard\r\nthem as little short of demons in female shape. All this is naturally\r\nworking a corresponding dislike and ill-feeling among the masses North.\r\nTo such I would say: These Southern sisters are not demons, but made of\r\nthe same flesh and blood, and passions and affections as yourselves. The\r\ndifference between you is purely one of circumstances and training, of\r\nlocality--above all, of education and institutions. It is as true that\r\n_institutions are second nature_ as that _habit_ is.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar faults of Southern women they share with their Northern\r\nsisters, only in a vastly enhanced degree; and besides these, they have\r\nothers, born of and nurtured by that terrible slavery system under whose\r\nblack shadow they live and die. Their idleness, their lack of neatness\r\nand order, their dependence, their quick and sometimes cruel passions,\r\ntheir unreason, their contempt of inferiors, their vanity and arrogance,\r\ntheir ignorance, their lightness and superficiality, are all the\r\noutgrowth of its diabolical influences. They are, in fact, no more idle,\r\nthriftless, passionate, or supercilious, than Northern women would be in\r\nsimilar circumstances. It is too much the habit among the unreflecting,\r\nin judging of the Southern masses in their hostile attitude toward their\r\nlawful Government, to give less weight than it deserves to the necessary\r\nand inevitable tendency upon the mind and character of such an\r\ninstitution as African slavery; and to let the blame be of a personal\r\nand revengeful nature, which should fall most heavily on the sin itself,\r\nthe dire crime against God and society, against himself and his fellow\r\nman, which the individual is all his life taught is no crime but a\r\npositive good. This slavery is woman's peculiar curse, bearing almost\r\nequally with its deadly, hideous weight on the white woman of the\r\ndominant class as upon the black slave woman. And yet how deluded they\r\nare! If that curse does come to an utter end in the South, as it surely\r\nwill, I shall hail, as one of the grandest results of its extinction,\r\nnext to the justice due the oppressed people of color, the emancipation\r\nof the white women of that fair land, all of them, slaveholders and\r\nnon-slaveholders, from an influence too withering and deadly for\r\nlanguage to depict. Oh, when shall that scapegoat, slavery, with its\r\nfailures and losses and shortcomings, its frauds and sins and woes, be\r\nsent off into the wilderness of non-existence, to be heard from\r\nnevermore? God speed the hour!\r\n\r\nBut with all their faults, they have many and shining virtues. Though\r\nthe ideal of a Southern woman commonly received at the North and abroad,\r\nis not true to the life, being neither so perfect nor so imperfect as\r\ntheir eulogists, on the one hand, and their detractors, on the other,\r\nwould fain make it to be, there is yet much, very much, to elicit both\r\nlove and admiration in her character.\r\n\r\nThe Southern female mind is precocious, brilliant, impressible, ardent,\r\nimpulsive, fanciful. The quickness of parts of many girls of fifteen is\r\nastonishing. I used often to think, what splendid women they would make,\r\nwith the training and facilities of our Northern home and school\r\neducation. But, as it was, they went under a cloud at seventeen,\r\nmarrying early, and either sinking into the inanition of plantation\r\nlife, or having their minds dissipated in a vain and frivolous round of\r\nidle and selfish gayeties. I compare their intellects to a rich tropical\r\nplant, which blossoms gorgeously and early, but rarely fruitens. The\r\nSouthern women are, for the most part, a capable but undeveloped race of\r\nbeings. With their precocity, like the exuberance of their vegetation,\r\nand with their quick, impassioned feelings, like their storm-freighted\r\nair, always bearing latent lightning in its bosom, they might become a\r\nsomething rich, rare, and admirable; but, never bringing thought up to\r\nthe point of reflection; never learning self-control, nor the necessity\r\nof holding passion in abeyance; never getting beyond the degrading\r\ninfluence of intercourse with a race whose stolidity and servility, the\r\ninevitable result of their condition, on the one hand, are both the\r\ncause and effect of the habit of irresponsible power and selfish\r\ndisregard of right fostered in the ruling class, on the other--what\r\ncould be expected of them but to become splendid abortions?\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration in connection with the excessive war\r\nspirit they have evinced, which may help to account for it. I have often\r\nhad occasion to notice the habit the educated class of Southern women\r\nhave of conversing familiarly with their male friends and relatives on\r\npolitical subjects, and to contrast it with the almost total reticence\r\nof Northern women on subjects of public interest. This, of course,\r\ninduces a more immediate and personal interest in them, and the more\r\nintimate one's interest in a subject, the more easily enthusiasm is\r\naroused toward it.\r\n\r\nNow, the very head and front, the bone and marrow of Southern politics\r\nfor more than three decades, has been--slavery, and plans for its\r\naggrandizement and perpetuation. _That_ has been the ulterior object of\r\nall the past vociferations about _State rights_ and _Southern rights_.\r\nSlavery is country, practically, with them, and as it lay at the root of\r\ntheir society, and its check or its extinction would, in their false\r\nview, overturn society itself, it was easy for the scheming, cunning\r\nleaders of the slave faction to adroitly transfer this enthusiasm, and\r\nto raise the watchword, which never yet among any people has been raised\r\nin vain, _Your homes and firesides_! When ever did women hear that cry\r\nunmoved?\r\n\r\nWhen _country_, that grand idea and object of human hope, pride, and\r\naffection, had degenerated into a section; and when a false and\r\nmiserable _institution_, from its very nature terribly intimate with the\r\nlife of society, became the most substantial feature of that section;\r\nwhat wonder if the war has at last, whatever it might have been at\r\nfirst, come to the complexion of a contest for home and fireside with\r\nthe masses of the people, with the majority of the Southern women?\r\n\r\nThe magnificent dreams and projects, too, of a great slave empire, that\r\nshould swallow up territory after territory, and astonish the world with\r\nits wealth, power, and splendor, which were fused into life in the\r\nbrains of the great apostles of slavery and secession, had their\r\ninfluence on minds which, like the minds of the Southern women, have a\r\nnatural, innate love for the gorgeous, the splendid, the profuse, and\r\nshowy; minds ambitious of, and accustomed to, rule, and impatient of\r\ncontrol; minds already glazed over with the influence of the lying\r\nassertion, proved to their uncritical, passionate judgment by all the\r\nsophistical arguments of which their religious and political guides were\r\ncapable, that slavery is the very best possible condition for the black\r\nman, and the relation of master the only true and natural one for the\r\nwhite. I say, I do not wonder at the Southern women so much. I pity them\r\ninfinitely. Just think what they have been educated to believe, and then\r\nsay if there is not something sadly splendid in the very spirit of\r\nendurance, of defiance, of sacrifice, however wrong and mistaken, they\r\nhave shown. I pity them profoundly, for they are drinking to the lees\r\nthe cup of suffering, of deprivation, of humiliation, of bitter loss,\r\nand stern retribution. And the end is not yet. Deeper chagrin and\r\nhumiliation must be theirs; more loss, more devastation, more death, and\r\nruin, before their proud hopes and visions are utterly crushed out of\r\nlife. Oh, are _they_ not being educated, too, as well as we of the\r\nNorth?\r\n\r\nWhen I think of all the grace, loveliness, and generosity of the many\r\nSouthern women I have known and loved; when I recall the admirable\r\nqualities which distinguished them, the grace of manner, the social\r\ntact and address, the intellectual sprightliness, the openness and\r\nhospitality of soul, the kindliness and sympathy of heart, the Christian\r\ngentleness and charity; I can but say to my Northern sisters, These\r\ndeluded women of the South would, in themselves, be worthy of your\r\nesteem and love, could the demon of secession and slavery once be\r\nexorcised. And I believe that when it is, and the poor, rent South sits\r\nclothed and in her right mind, subdued through sheer exhaustion of\r\nstrength, and so made fit for the healthy recuperation that is one day\r\nto begin, the cause of our beloved country, and of humanity through this\r\ncountry, will have no more generous or loving supporters, ay, none so\r\nenthusiastic and devoted as they. I glory in the anticipation of the\r\ntime when the ardent, impulsive, demonstrative South shall even lead the\r\ncolder North in the manifestation of a genuine patriotism, worthy of the\r\nland and nation that calls it forth. We shall then have gained _a\r\ncountry_, indeed, instead of being, as heretofore, several sections of a\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe consistent moulding of society in the spirit of our political ideas\r\nis essential to securing us the respect of the world, and to vindicating\r\nthe principles, themselves, on which having built, they are our sole\r\nclaim to such honor and respect. As long as we fail so to do, we may be\r\nthe wonder, and we are likely to be the jest of the onlooking world, but\r\nwe never can be what we ought to be, its admired and beloved model. It\r\nseems to me there is less danger now than formerly of our failure in\r\nthis important respect. The dangers, the expenses, the burdens, and\r\nlosses of this fearful civil war will surely create in the hearts of the\r\npeople everywhere, North and South, a revivified if not a new-born love\r\nfor, and appreciation of, republican principles, and will teach them\r\nwhere the most insidious danger to them lies; not from open foes,\r\nforeign or domestic; not from anything inherent in those free\r\nprinciples; but from a cause exceedingly paradoxical: a democratic\r\npeople leaving to a party, to a section, the Government which should be\r\ntheir very own; the virtue and intelligence of the nation absenting\r\nthemselves from the national councils, thus making way for corruption\r\nand fraud to enter in an overwhelming flood; one half of the nation\r\nrocking its conscience to sleep with the false lullaby of commercial\r\ngreatness and material prosperity, and the other, left to do the\r\ngoverning, with seemingly no conscience at all, going to work with\r\nsatanic directness and acuteness, to undermine the principles thus left\r\nwithout a guardian, and to inject the black blood of slavery into the\r\nveins of the body politic, till the name _democracy_ became a misnomer\r\nthe most wretched, a sarcasm the most touching. I do not imagine we\r\nshall ever again go back to that. It must be that, in future, the\r\nAmerican people will grow into the habit of demanding that an\r\nenlightened, patriotic statesmanship shall rule, instead of an\r\nunprincipled demagoguism. Also, that they will attend to it that better\r\nmen are sent to Washington; men chosen because they represent most\r\nnearly the great national ideas and interests, which the people will\r\nrequire shall absorb legislation rather than any sectional institution\r\nwhatever; and not because, primarily, they are the subservient idols of\r\nthis or that party. It must be that, hereafter, party will be less and\r\nthe nation more. Of course, parties will exist, necessarily; but if this\r\ngreat American people, having carried on to perfect success this war\r\nagainst a stupendous rebellion, and having gone through the school of\r\nknowledge and experience it has been to them, can again settle down into\r\nthe mere political jobbery into which governmental affairs had\r\ndeteriorated before the earthquake of war stirred up the dregs of\r\nthings, it would be an instance of fruitless expenditure of means and\r\nlife, and of self-stultification, too pitiful for words--such an\r\ninstance as the world has not yet seen, thanks to the ordained\r\nprogression of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen peace returns to the land once more; when the fierce fever of blood\r\nand strife is quelled; when the vague fears and uncertainties of this\r\nperiod of transition are over, and the keen pangs and bloody sweat of\r\nthe nation's new birth are all past--what will be the position of this\r\nAmerican people? I tremble to contemplate it. It will be much like what\r\nI imagine the condition of a freed, redeemed soul to be, just escaped\r\nthe thraldom, perplexity, and sin of this lower life, and entered on a\r\npurer, higher, freer plane of existence. Then comes reconstruction,\r\nreorganization, a getting acquainted with the new order of things, and\r\nthe new duties and experiences to which it will give rise; then will be\r\ndiscoveries of new truths, and new applications of old; old errors and\r\nsuperstitions have been renounced, and facts and principles which have\r\nlong lain in abeyance, smothered under a weight of neglect and\r\nunappreciation, will start into fresh magnitude. And, withal, will come\r\na sense of the reality and security there is in this great change, and\r\nof infinite relief and blessedness therein, such as I suppose attends\r\nevery change from a lower to a higher condition, from darkness to light,\r\nfrom cloud, mystery, and trouble, to the white air of peace and the\r\nclear shining of the sun of knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Then_, think of the career that lies ahead of this regenerated nation.\r\nThis war, fearful and costly as it is, was needed, to rouse men and\r\nwomen to the conviction that there is something more in a people's life\r\nthan can be counted in dollars and cents; and that their strength\r\nconsists not alone in commercial superiority or material development,\r\nbut, principally, in virtue, justice, righteousness. It was needed, to\r\ngive the lie to that impious and infidel assumption of the South that\r\n_Cotton is king_, and to prove that the God of this heaven-protected\r\nland is a true and jealous God, who will not give his glory to Baal. It\r\nwas needed, to arrest the nation in the fearful mechanical tendency it\r\nwas assuming, whereby it was near denying the most holy and vital\r\nprinciples of its being; and it was needed, to warm and quicken the\r\nalmost dead patriotism of the masses, and to educate them anew in the\r\nhigh and pure sentiments they had suffered to be forgotten, and, in\r\nforgetting which, many another ration has gone to irretrievable decay\r\nand ruin.\r\n\r\nI trust in God that this people have not suffered many things in vain,\r\nand that the time is dawning when we shall be a _nation_ indeed, a\r\nChristian nation, built upon those eternal ideas of truth, justice,\r\nright, charity, holiness, which would make us the ideal nation of the\r\nearth, dwelling securely under the very smile and benediction of\r\nJehovah.\r\n\r\nIn this time of which I speak, the people will see that to be a _nation_\r\nwe must not be merely servile imitators of Old World ideas, but must\r\ndevelop our own _American ideas_ in every department of government and\r\nsociety; thus, eventually, building up a national structure which shall,\r\nwhich need, yield to none, but may take precedence of all.\r\n\r\nWe are too young, as yet, to have become such a nation, with its\r\ndistinctive and separate features, each clearly marked and\r\nself-illustrating; but _not_ too young to understand the necessity of\r\nworking out our own special plan of civilization. As the American nation\r\ndid not follow the course of all others, by mounting from almost\r\nimpalpable beginnings up through successive stages to an assured\r\nposition of national influence and greatness; so need we not imitate\r\nthem in waiting for gray hairs to see ourselves possessed of a distinct\r\nnational character. As we did not have to go through the slow, age-long\r\nprocess of originating, of developing ideas, principles, but took them\r\nready made, a legacy from the experience of all the foregoing ages; and\r\nas our business is to apply these ideas to the problem we are set to\r\nsolve, not for ourselves alone, but for the world's peoples, for\r\naggregate humanity, so should we be neither laggard nor lukewarm in\r\nfulfilling this high trust, this 'manifest destiny.' In the developing\r\nof our special American ideas we have a great work before us--a work but\r\nbegun, as yet. There is an American art--an American literature--an\r\nAmerican society, as well as an American Government, to be shaped out of\r\nthe abundant material we possess, and compacted into the enduring\r\nedifice of national renown. For what is national character, but ideas\r\ncrystallized in institutions? Until we have done this--given permanency\r\nto our special ideas in our institutions--we are a nation in embryo; our\r\nmanhood exists only in prophecy.\r\n\r\nTo assist in this mighty work is the duty and privilege of American\r\nwomen. What higher ambition could actuate their endeavors--what nobler\r\nmeed of glory win their aspirations?\r\n\r\nO ye women, dear American sisters, whoever you are, who have offered up\r\nyour husbands, sons, brothers, lovers, on the red altar of your country,\r\nthat so that country may be rescued from the foes that seek her honor\r\nand life; who have labored and toiled and spent your efforts in\r\nsupplying the needs of her brave defenders; whose hearts and prayers are\r\nall for the success of our holy cause; who are glad with an infinite joy\r\nat her successes, and who are sorry with profoundest grief at her\r\ndefeats; complete, I implore you, the sacrifice already begun, and give\r\nto your regenerated country, in the very dawn of the new day which is to\r\nsee her start afresh upon the shining track of national glory,\r\nyourselves, your best energies, and affections. Love liberty--love\r\njustice--love simplicity--love truth and consistency. See to it that the\r\ncause of republican freedom suffer not its greatest drawback from your\r\nfailure to lead society up to the point to which you have the power to\r\neducate it. By your office as the natural leaders and educators of\r\nsociety; by your mission as the friends and helpers of all who suffer;\r\nby your high privilege as the ordained helpmate of man in the work,\r\nunder God and His truth, of evangelizing the world, and lifting it out\r\nof its sin and sorrow; by your obligations to the glorious principles of\r\nChristian republicanism; and by your hopes of complete ultimate\r\nenfranchisement, I adjure you. The world has need of you, the erring,\r\nsin-struck world. Your country, even now struggling in the throes of its\r\nlater birth, has desperate need of you. Man has need of you; already are\r\nbeing woven between the long-estranged sexes new and indissoluble bonds\r\nof union,--sympathies, beautiful, infinite, deathless; and, with a\r\npleased and tender smile of recognition across the continent, he hails\r\nyou _helper_! Your era dawns in sad and sombre seeming, indeed, in a\r\nland deluged with fraternal blood; but yours are all who need, all who\r\nsin, all who suffer. Shall the progress of humanity wait upon your\r\nsupineness, or neglect, or refusal? Or shall the era now beginning,\r\nthrough you speedily culminate into the bright, perfect day of your\r\ncountry's redemption, and thus lead progress and salvation throughout\r\nthe nations of the earth? Never were women so near the attainment of\r\nwoman's possibilities as we American women; never so near the\r\nrealization of that beautiful ideal which has ever shaped the dreams and\r\ncolored the visions of mankind, making Woman the brightest star of man's\r\nlove and worship.\r\n\r\nWill she realize the dream--will she justify the worship? That is the\r\nquestion that concerns her now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WREN'S SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not often in these dark days that I can sleep as I used to do\r\nbefore the flood came and swept away all that my soul held dear; but\r\nlast night, I was so weary in body with a long journey, that I fell\r\nasleep as soon as my head touched the pillow, and slept on until the\r\nearly morning sun came in through the open window, and woke me with its\r\ngentle touch. The air was sweet with spring fragrance, and the first\r\nsound that came to my awakened ears was the song of a little wren, a\r\nlittle wren who sang even as to-day in the days of my youth and joy,\r\nwhose nest is built over the window that was so often a frame for that\r\ndearest-loved face. The song brought with it the recollection of all the\r\nlittle songster had outlived--the love, hope, and fear that had sprung\r\nup and grown and died, since I had first heard his warbling. And I broke\r\ninto those quiet tears that are now my only expression of a grief too\r\nfamiliar to be passionate.\r\n\r\nTo-day is the first of June--a year to-day since all was over!\r\n\r\nThree years ago, this very day, was to have been my wedding day. June\r\nand its roses were made for lovers, as surely as May, with its May\r\nflowers and little lilies, is the month of Mary the Blessed. I had\r\nalways wished to be married in June, and circumstances combined to\r\nrender that time more convenient than any other. My love affair had been\r\na long one, and had met with no obstacles. Our families had always been\r\nintimate, and I remember _him_ a boy of fourteen, when he first came to\r\nlive in the house opposite. At sixteen he went to West Point, and when\r\nhe came home in his furlough year, I was fifteen. We were both in\r\nWashington until August; it was a long session; his father was in\r\nCongress, and so was mine. Edward Mayne had nothing to do that summer,\r\nand I never had much to occupy me; we saw each other every day, and so\r\nwe fell in love. The heads of both families saw all, smiled a little,\r\nand teased a good deal; but no one interfered. My mother said it gave me\r\noccupation and amusement, and helped me to pass the long summer\r\nevenings, which I thought charming, and every one else thought a bore.\r\nIt was called a childish flirtation, and when he went back to the\r\nAcademy, and I to school, the thing dropped out of notice, and was soon\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nBut not by us. We remembered each other, and, each in our different\r\nlives, we were constant to our early love. And so it came to pass that,\r\nwhen he came back again, after graduating, we were very glad to see each\r\nother; the old intercourse was renewed, and the old feeling showed\r\nitself stronger for the lapse of years. No one interfered with us; the\r\nintimacy between our families had continued, and when we went to the\r\nseaside for the hot months, the Maynes went to the same place; and in\r\nAugust Edward had a leave, and came down to join them. I think he would\r\nhave come if they had not been there, but that makes no difference now.\r\nOne moonlit night, at the end of August, with the waves at our feet\r\nsounding their infinite secret, I promised to marry him; and as we\r\nparted that night at the door of our cottage, I looked at the\r\nsilver-streaked waters, and said to him that neither the broad sea of\r\ndeath nor the stormy sea of life should ever part my soul from his. I\r\nhave kept my word.\r\n\r\nSo we were engaged to be married, and were as happy as two young lovers\r\nought to be. Both families were delighted, my father only stipulating\r\nthat the marriage should not take place immediately. But that we felt no\r\nhardship, as Edward was stationed in Washington; and everything in the\r\nfuture looked as bright as everything in the past had ever been. We were\r\nsure of a happy winter, and hoped for a gay one, and we had both, though\r\nthe cloud that had first appeared when the little wren began his summer\r\nsong, had grown larger and darker day by day, until the signs of storm\r\nwere no longer to be overlooked, and the fearful prophesied that the day\r\nof peace was over. Still I never dreamed of the difference it would make\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nNew Tear's Eve it was decided that we should be married on the first of\r\nJune. As the clock struck twelve, and the last footfall of the old year\r\ndied away, Edward put out his hand to take mine, and said:\r\n\r\n'A happy New Tear it will surely be to us, my Laura, for we shall spend\r\nmore than half of it together;' and I echoed his 'happy New Year'\r\nwithout a dread. I knew the storm was coming; I feared its fury; but I\r\nthought myself too secure, too near a haven to be lost; how could I know\r\nthat the brave ship was destined to go down in sight of land?\r\n\r\nAnd yet I might have known it. For I came from the North, which was, and\r\nis my home; and he was a Southern man. His family owned property and\r\nslaves in Georgia; and, though Mr. Mayne's political career had\r\nprevented their living there much, they considered it their home. One of\r\nthe sons, who was married, lived on the plantation, and managed it well;\r\nthe slaves were comparatively happy, and there were strong ties between\r\nthem, their master and his family. My sister, who was delicate, had\r\nspent a winter in Florida, and I had accompanied her there. On our way\r\nhome we paid a visit to the Mayne plantation; my sister enjoyed herself\r\nvery much there, and was pro-slavery from that time; I was then sixteen,\r\nand had always hated it, and what with my fears of snakes, and my\r\ndislike of the black servants, whom I thought either inefficient or\r\nimpertinent, and my unconquerable liking for freedom, I was not so\r\nfascinated. Edward Mayne himself did not like a planter's life, and he\r\nthought slavery an evil, but an evil inherited and past curing. He\r\nargued that the disease was not mortal and endurable, and that it would\r\nkill the country to use the knife. His youngest sister and I were the\r\nonly two who ever discussed the subject; she talked a great deal of\r\nnonsense, and probably I did, too; and as she always lost her temper, I\r\nthought it wiser to let the subject drop, especially as I did not think\r\nabout it a great deal, and it annoyed Edward to have any coolness\r\nbetween Georgy and me, and he himself never discussed the topic. We were\r\nboth very young and very happy, too young and thoughtless to care much\r\nfor any great question, so we sang our little song of happiness, and its\r\nmusic filled our ears until it was no longer possible not to hear the\r\ntumult of the world without.\r\n\r\nThe first day of January was our last day of perfect peace. Those who\r\nhad not thought of the question before had now to answer what part they\r\nmeant to take. People discussed less what States would secede, and more\r\nwhat they would themselves do, and many who are now most firm on one\r\nside or the other were then agitated by doubt and indecision. Events did\r\nnot tarry for individual minds. We all know the story now; I need not\r\nrepeat it. Still my future seemed unchanged, and I went to New York the\r\nthird of January to order my wedding clothes, but I stayed only three or\r\nfour days; I was restless for the continued excitement of Washington.\r\nThe day I came back Mississippi seceded, and with it went Mr. Davis. I\r\nheard him make that farewell speech which so few listened to unmoved,\r\nand at which I cried bitterly. I went to say good by to him, though I\r\ncould not say God speed, for already I was beginning to know that I had\r\nprinciples, and which side they were on. As we parted, he said, in that\r\ncourteous way that has made so many bow at his shrine:\r\n\r\n'We shall have you in the South very soon, Miss Laura,' and I did not\r\nsay no; but the mist lifted suddenly before my eyes, and I saw the rock\r\non which my life was to split, and that no striving against the stream\r\nwould avail me aught. Still I said nothing, and the days flew swiftly by\r\non restless wings; days so full of excitement that they seemed to take\r\nyears with them in their flight.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning in February; the air had already a May softness\r\nin it, and the crocuses were bright in the grounds of the Capitol, when\r\nEdward and I went to take our favorite walk, and there, in sight of the\r\nbroad river which is now a world-known name of division, he told me he\r\nhad made up his mind to leave the army; that there might be fighting,\r\nand he could not fight against his own people, whom he believed to be in\r\nthe right; that he thought it more honorable to resign at that moment\r\nthan to wait until the hour of need. I could not oppose him, for I knew\r\nhe thought he was doing his duty. I remembered how different his\r\nopinions were from mine, and that his whole system of education had\r\ntrained him in dissimilar ideas of right from those held in the North.\r\nGeorgia was his country, for which he lived, and for which he thought he\r\nought to die, if need were. The shackles of inherited prejudices\r\ntrammelled his spirit, as they might have trammelled the spirit of a\r\nwiser man, who could have shaken them off in the end; but my lover was\r\nnot wide-minded, and had not the clear sight that sees over and beyond\r\nthese petty lives of ours that are as nothing in the way of a great\r\nprinciple and a God-bidden struggle; his eyes saw only what they had\r\nbeen taught to see--his home, in its greenness and beauty, not the dank\r\nsoul-malaria, to which, alas! so many of us are acclimated.\r\n\r\nHe resigned, and his resignation was accepted without delay or\r\ndifficulty, as were all resignations in those days. The spring began to\r\nbreak in all its glory, and the grass grew green in Virginia, on fields\r\nthat were trampled and bloody before that battle summer was over. The\r\nlittle wren sang again its song. This year a song of promise--of promise\r\nnever to be fulfilled!\r\n\r\nFor the news of Sumter came, and the North rose with a cry, and my heart\r\nleaped up within me with a thrill stronger and deeper and more masterful\r\nthan any mere personal feeling can ever give; a feeling that rules my\r\nsoul to-day even as it ruled in that first excited hour.\r\n\r\nEdward went South, and I let him go alone. I could not, I would not go\r\nwith him. I had no sympathy, no tenderness, scarcely forgiveness for the\r\nmen who had brought the evil upon us. We parted lovers, hoping for days\r\nof peace, and sure of reunion when those days should come; and every\r\nnight and every morning I prayed for him; but first I prayed for the\r\nsafety of my country, and the victory of our cause.\r\n\r\nTime crept on. The battle of Bull Run was fought; he was engaged in it,\r\nand for many, many days I never knew whether he was living or dead. In\r\nthe autumn I heard he had been ordered West, and that winter was a time\r\nof anxious days and restless nights. I never heard _from_ him, and I did\r\nnot think it fair to write; occasionally I heard _of_ him through an\r\naunt of his, who lived in Maryland, but she was gall and bitterness\r\nitself on the political question, and never let me know anything she\r\ncould possibly keep from me. So my life passed in fruitless wondering\r\nand bitter suspense; I never saw a soldier without thinking of Edward,\r\nand my dreams showed him to me wounded, ill, or dying. No; the dead may\r\nmake their voices heard across the gulf that parts us from them, but not\r\nthe absent, or his soul would have heard my 'exceeding loud and bitter\r\ncry,' and hearing, must have come.\r\n\r\nI must not dwell on this. The days rolled on, and spring brightened the\r\nair, the grass was green again, the dying hope in my heart revived, and\r\nI listened again to the wren's song, and thought it yet promised a\r\nsummer for my life. But that was the year of the Peninsular campaign,\r\nand the dying leaves fell on the graves of our bravest and brightest,\r\nand the autumn wind sighed a lamentation in our ears, and our hearts\r\nwere mourning bitterly for the defeats of the summer, and no less\r\nbitterly for the dear-bought glory of Antietam. And winter came again:\r\nhope fled with the swallows, and my youth began to leave me.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn I went to New York, to pay a visit to a friend. One\r\nnight I went with my brother to the theatre. The play was stupid, and\r\nthe _entr'actes_ were long. In the middle of the second act, while some\r\nhorrible nonsense was being talked upon the stage, I looked around the\r\ntheatre, and saw no face I had ever seen before, when a lady near me\r\nmoved her fan, and, a little distance beyond her, I saw--with a start I\r\nsaw--the face that was never long absent from my thoughts. Changed and\r\nolder, and brown and bearded; but I knew him; and he knew me, and\r\nsmiled; and there was no doubt in my mind. I was not even surprised. But\r\nto the sickness of sudden joy soon succeeded the sickness of\r\napprehension. What brought him there? And what would be done to him if\r\nhe were discovered? How could I see him and speak to him? Oh! could it\r\nbe possible that we might not meet more nearly! I wonder I did not die\r\nduring that quarter of an hour. I turned and looked at my brother; his\r\neyes were fixed upon the stage, and he was as curiously unmoved as if\r\nthe world were still steady and firm beneath my feet.\r\n\r\nI did not look at Edward again; I feared to betray him; and the green\r\ncurtain fell, and my brother said, if I did not mind being left alone\r\nfor a few minutes, he would go. He left me, and Edward came to me, and\r\nonce more I saw him, and once more I heard his voice. He stayed only one\r\nmoment, only long enough to make an appointment with me for the next\r\nmorning, and then he left the theatre. The people around us thought\r\nprobably that he was a casual acquaintance, if indeed they thought about\r\nit at all; and when my brother came back, he found me looking listless\r\nand bored, and apologized for having been detained.\r\n\r\nI had--and still have, thank God!--a friend in whom I trusted; to her I\r\nhad recourse, and it was by her help that I was enabled to keep my\r\nappointment. Only those who have known the pain of such a parting can\r\never hope to know the joy of such a meeting. I would like to make the\r\nrest of this as short as possible. Edward had run the blockade to see\r\nme; he had been to Washington, had stayed there three days, had heard of\r\nmy absence, obtained my address, and followed me to New York; he had\r\nwaited until twilight, when he had come to look at the house where I was\r\nstaying; as he was walking slowly on the opposite side of the street, he\r\nhad seen me come out with my brother, and had followed us to the\r\ntheatre. He had trusted to his long beard and the cropping of his curly\r\nhead as the most effectual disguise, and so far no one had recognized\r\nhim. The only people who had known of his being in Washington were the\r\nfriends with whom he stayed, the tailor who had sold him his clothes,\r\nwho had a son with Stuart's cavalry, and the girl, my old school friend,\r\nwho had given him my address, whom he went to see in the dusk hours of\r\nthe afternoon, and who had hospitably received him in the coal\r\ncellar--which struck me, at the moment, as an infallible method of\r\narousing suspicion. He wanted me to return with him, or to marry him\r\nand follow him by flag of truce; he was sure Providence had made his way\r\nsmooth on purpose to effect our union. His arguments were perhaps not\r\nvery logical, but they almost convinced me of what I wished to believe.\r\nI was willing to bear the anger of my family, but could not think of\r\nagain undergoing the wear and tear of separation. I promised to let him\r\nknow my decision early the next morning; I think I should have gone with\r\nhim, but that evening we were telegraphed to return to Washington--my\r\nfather had been stricken down by apoplexy; and my brother and I went\r\nhome in the night train. Edward knew the reason, for he read my father's\r\ndeath in the morning's newspaper.\r\n\r\nThree weeks afterward I had a letter from Edward Mayne by flag of truce;\r\nthat was the week before Fredericksburg; and then the agony again began.\r\nIt did not last very long. In the early spring came Chancellorsville,\r\nand there Edward was slightly wounded and taken prisoner; he was removed\r\nto the hospital at Point Lookout; his aunt went to nurse him, but I did\r\nnot go; he was doing very well, and I thought it was wiser not. And one\r\nday in May--ah! that day!--I was looking out of my window, and I see now\r\nthe blue sky, the little white clouds, the roses, and the ivied wall\r\nthat I saw when my mother came in and said Mrs. Daingerfield had come to\r\ntake me to Edward, who was very ill and anxious to see me. I remember\r\nhow the blood seemed to sink away from my heart, and for a moment I\r\nthought I was going to die; but in another moment I knew that I should\r\nlive. I was eager and excited, and not unhappy, from that time until the\r\nend was at hand.\r\n\r\nI had never been in a hospital before, and there was a long ward full of\r\nmen, who all looked to me as if they were dying, through which I passed\r\nto reach the room in which Edward Mayne lay alone. He heard me coming,\r\nand, as I opened the door, he raised himself in bed and put out his hand\r\nto me....\r\n\r\nThat night the dreadful pain left him, and his aunt said he seemed\r\nbrighter and more hopeful; but when the surgeon saw him in the morning,\r\nhe shook his head. When the sun set, Edward knew that he should never\r\nagain see its evening glories. Into that dark, still room came a greater\r\nthan Solomon, and as the dread shadow of his wings fell on my life, I\r\nhushed my prayers and tears. We sat and watched and waited; and there\r\ncame back a feeble strength into the worn frame, and he told us what he\r\nwished. He said that perhaps he had been wrong, but he had thought\r\nhimself right; at least, he had given his life for his faith, and soon,\r\nsoon he would know all. Then he asked them to leave him alone with me\r\nfor a little while, and when they came back into the room, nothing\r\nremained of him but the cast-off mortality. The sun was rising in the\r\neast, but his soul was far beyond it; and the sunlight came in and\r\nkissed the quiet pale face, that looked so peaceful and so happy there\r\ncould be no lamentation over it.\r\n\r\nThat day came his parole; the parole which we had so exerted ourselves\r\nto obtain that he might go home to get well; and now it had found him\r\nfar beyond the captivity of bar or flesh--a freed spirit, 'gone up on\r\nhigh.'\r\n\r\nThe kindness of the Government induced us to ask one more favor, which\r\nwas granted us. They let us take him home to Washington and bury him in\r\nthe place he had always wished to be buried in; and some Confederate\r\nprisoners were given permission to attend his funeral. So he was buried\r\nas a soldier should be buried, borne to the grave by his comrades, and\r\nmourned by the woman dearest to him. He lies now on the sunniest slope\r\nin that green graveyard, where the waters rush near his resting place,\r\nand the trees make a shade for the daisies that brighten above him.\r\n\r\nHe died as the sun rose on the first of June; we buried him early on the\r\nmorning of the fifth. That night I left Washington, glad that it was to\r\nbe no longer my place of residence, glad that my family would soon\r\nfollow me to make another home where I could be stung by no\r\nassociations. The old house passed into the hands of my elder sister,\r\nwho is married to a Congressman from the West. But during this winter I\r\nhave been so often homesick, and this early spring has been so chill and\r\nbleak compared with the May days of Washington, that I was fain to come\r\nback for a brief hour; and I have chosen to come in these last May days,\r\nthat the first of June might find me here, true to the memory of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing left of the old days; the place is changed from what it\r\nonce was; the streets swarm with soldiers and strange faces; the houses\r\nare used by Government, or are dwelt in by strangers; there is scarcely\r\na trace in this Sodom of the Sodom before the flood. No, there is\r\nnothing left for me now, of the things I used to know, except the little\r\nwren, whose song broke my heart this morning; and there is nothing here\r\nfor me to care for, except that young grave in Georgetown, whose white\r\ncross bears but the initials and the date. I must now try to make myself\r\na new life elsewhere, and to-morrow I go forth, shaking off the dust\r\nthat soils my garments; hoping for the promise of the rainbow in this\r\nstorm--and sure of the strength that will not fail me. O world! be\r\nbetter than thy wont to thy poor, weary child! O earth! be kindly to a\r\nbruised reed! O hope! thou wilt not leave me till the end--the end for\r\nwhich I wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORD-STILTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader is so favored as to possess a copy of the 'Comparative\r\nPhysiognomy' of Dr. James W. Redfield (a work long out of market, and\r\nwhich never had much of a sale), he may find in a chapter concerning the\r\nlikeness between certain men and parrots some wise remarks on ridiculous\r\neccentricities in literature. 'In inferior minds,' says the Doctor,'the\r\nlove of originality shows itself in oddity.' 'There is many a sober\r\ninnovator,' he continues, farther on,' whose delight it is to ponder\r\n\r\n     'O'er many a volume of forgotten lore,'\r\n\r\nthat he may not be supposed to make use of the humdrum literature of the\r\nday; who introduces obsolete words and coins new ones, and makes a\r\npatchwork of all languages; makes use of execrable phrases, and invents\r\na style that may be called his own.' The Doctor compares these writers\r\nto parrots.\r\n\r\nNow it is a well-known peculiarity of parrots that they have a passion\r\nfor perching themselves in places where they will be on a level with the\r\nheads of the superior race whose utterances they imitate. The perch a\r\nparrot affects is almost always an altitude of about six feet, or the\r\nheight of the tallest men. They feel their inferiority keenly if you\r\nleave them to hop about on the floor. It occurs to us that nothing could\r\nplease a parrot more, if it could be, than a pair of stilts on which it\r\ncould hop comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe literary parrot, more fortunate than his feathered fellow, finds\r\nstilts in words--obsolete words, such as men do not use in common\r\nintercourse with their fellows. Modern rhymesters more and more affect\r\nthis thing. Every day sees some _outre_ old word resurrected from its\r\nburial of rubbish, and set in the trochaics and spondees of love songs\r\nand sonnets. Dabblers in literature, who would walk unseen, pigmies\r\namong a race of giants, get on their word-stilts, and straightway the\r\near-tickled critics and the unconsciously nose-led public join in paeans\r\nof applause. Sage men, who do not exactly see through the thing, nod\r\ntheir heads approvingly, and remark: 'Something in that fellow!' And the\r\ndelighted ladies, prone as the dear creatures often are to be pleased\r\nwith jingle that they don't understand, exclaim: 'A'n't he delightful!'\r\n\r\nThe lamented Professor Alexander once produced a very excellent poem,\r\nwhich contained only words of a single syllable, forcibly illustrating\r\nthe power of simple language. We should be glad to reproduce it here, by\r\nway of contrapose to our own accompanying poem, but cannot now recall it\r\nto memory in its completeness. Any child, who could talk as we all talk\r\nin our families, could read and understand fully the poem to which I\r\nrefer. But ask any child to read the lines we have hammered out below,\r\nand tell you what they mean! Nay, ask any man to do it, and see if he\r\n_can_ do it. Probably not one in a hundred usual readers, could 'read\r\nand translate' the word-stilts with which we have trammelled our poetic\r\nfeet, except with the aid of patient and repeated communion with his\r\nEnglish dictionary. There are, however, no words employed here which may\r\nnot be found in the standard dictionaries of our tongue.\r\n\r\nTo it:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POET INVOKETH HIS MUSE.\r\n\r\n  Come, ethel muse, with fluxion tip my pen,\r\n    For rutilant dignotion would I earn;\r\n  As rhetor wise depeint me unto men:\r\n    A thing or two I ghess they'll have to learn\r\n  Ere they percipience can claim of what I'm up\r\n    To, in macrology so very sharp as this;\r\n  Off food oxygian hid them come and sup,\r\n    Until, from very weariness, they all dehisce.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POET SEEKETH THE READER'S FORBEARANCE.\r\n\r\n  Delitigate me not, O reader mine,\r\n    If here you find not all like flies succinous;\r\n  My hand is porrect--kindly take't in thine,\r\n    While modestly my caput is declinous;\r\n  Nor think that I sugescent motives have,\r\n    In asking thee to read my chevisance.\r\n  I weet it is depectible--but do not rave,\r\n    Nor despumate on me with look askance.\r\n\r\n  Existimation greatly I desire;\r\n    'Tis so expetible I have sad fears\r\n  That, excandescent, you will not esquire\r\n    My meaning; see, I madefy my cheek with tears,\r\n  On my bent knees implore forbearance kind;\r\n    Be not retose in haught; I know 'tis sad,\r\n  But get your Webster down, and you will find\r\n    That he's to blame, not I--so don't get mad!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POET COMMENCETH TO SING.\r\n\r\n  The morning dawned. The rorid earth upon,\r\n    Old Sol looked down, to do his work siccate,\r\n  My sneek I raised to greet the ethe sun,\r\n    And sauntering forth passed out my garden gate.\r\n  A blithe specht sat on yon declinous tree\r\n    Bent on delection to its bark extern;\r\n  A merle anear observed (it seemed to me)\r\n    The work, in hopes to make owse how to learn.\r\n\r\n  A drove of kee passed by; I made a stond,\r\n    For fast as kee how could my old legs travel?\r\n  But--immorigerous brutes!--with feet immund\r\n    They seemed to try my broadcloth garb to javel.\r\n  The semblance of a mumper then I wore,\r\n    Though a faldisdory before I might have graced;\r\n  Eftsoons I found, when standing flames before,\r\n    The mud to siccate, it was soon erased.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we should turn our attention studiously to this line of literary\r\neffort, we feel encouraged to believe that our success in a field of\r\nlate so popular would be marked, and that we should obtain a degree of\r\nfame herein, beside which that of the moat shining light in the stilted\r\nfirmament would pale its ray. But so long as God gives us the glorious\r\nprivilege of emulating the stars, we shall not seek to win a place among\r\nthe 'tallow dips' of parrot-poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT SOCIAL PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\nWhen the meteorological question was despatched, ladies have long had a\r\nhabit of calling upon their servants to furnish them with small talk;\r\nhigh wages, huge appetites, daintiness, laziness, breakage,\r\nimpertinence, are fruitful topics which they daily treat exhaustively;\r\nalways arriving at the hopeless conclusion: 'Did you ever hear of\r\nanything like it?' and 'I wonder what we are coming to!'\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that we may be coming to--no servants at all? To me\r\nthe signs seem to point that way. Cobbett said that in America public\r\nservant means master: he might add, if he were writing now, and so does\r\nprivate servant. Each house is divided against itself into two camps;\r\nhostile, though perhaps not in open war with each other: and Camp\r\nKitchen has the advantage of position. Above stairs uneasy sits the\r\nemployer, timid, conciliating, temporizing; seeing as little as he can,\r\nand overlooking half he sees; ready to change his habits and to subdue\r\nhis tastes to suit the whims of the _enemigos pagados_, as the Spaniards\r\ncall them, he has under his roof. Below stairs lounge the lordly\r\nemployes (a charming newspaper neologism for hotel waiters, street\r\nsweepers, and railway porters), defiant, aggressive, and perfectly aware\r\nthat they are masters of the situation. Daily they become more like the\r\ntwo Ganymedes of Griffith's boarding house: he called them Tide and\r\nTide--because they waited on no man. They have long ceased to be hewers\r\nof wood and drawers of water, and yet they accomplish less than before\r\nthe era of modern improvements. It appears to be a law of domestic\r\neconomy that work is inversely as the increase of wages. Nowadays, if a\r\nhousekeeper visits a prison, he envies the whiteness of the floors and\r\nthe brightness of the coppers he sees there, and thinks, with a sigh,\r\nhow well it might be for his _subscalaneans_, if they could be made to\r\ntake a course of neatness for a few months in some such an institution.\r\n\r\nVain wish! The future is theirs, and they know it. Their services will\r\nbecome gradually more worthless, until we shall find them only in grand\r\nestablishments: mere appendages kept for fashion and for show; as\r\nuseless as the rudimental legs of a snake, which he has apparently only\r\nto indicate the distinguished class in animated nature he may claim to\r\nbelong to. We shall live to say, as Perrault sang:\r\n\r\n  'J'apercus l'ombre d'un cocher\r\n  Tenant l'ombre d'une brosse\r\n  Nettoyant l'ombre d'un carrosse.'\r\n\r\nAlas! I fear that even these shadows of servants will one day vanish and\r\ndisappear from us altogether.\r\n\r\nTime was when classes in society were as well defined as races still\r\nare. The currents ran side by side, and never intermingled. Some were\r\nborn to furnish the blessings of life, and others to enjoy them. Some to\r\nwait, and others to be waited upon. The producing class accepted their\r\ndestiny cheerfully, believed in their 'betters,' and were proud to serve\r\nthem. The last eighty years have pretty much broken down these\r\ncomfortable boundary lines between men. The feudal retainer, who was\r\nready to give his life for his lord, the clever valet, who took kicks\r\nand caning as a matter of course when his master was in liquor or had\r\nlost at cards, even the old family servants, are species as extinct as\r\nthe Siberian elephant, or the cave bear, or the dodo. And now the\r\nadvance of the Union armies southward has destroyed the last lingering\r\ntype of the servant post: the faithful black.\r\n\r\nIn this country there never was much distinction of classes. The\r\nunwillingness of New England _help_ to admit of any superiority on the\r\npart of their masters has furnished many amusing stories. Later, when\r\nthe Irish element penetrated into every kitchen, farmyard, and stable,\r\nfloating off the native born into higher stations, service became\r\nlimited to immigrants and to negroes. But the immigrant soon learned the\r\npopular motto, 'I'm as good as you are,' and only remained a serving man\r\nuntil he could save enough money to set up for himself: not a difficult\r\nmatter in the United States; and never so easy as at this moment. The\r\ndemands of the Government for soldiers and for supplies threaten us with\r\na _labor famine_ in spite of the large immigration. In Europe labor is\r\nscarce and in demand. Commerce, manufactures, colonization have outrun\r\nthe supply. Wages have doubled in England and in France within the last\r\ntwenty years, and are rising. With increase of wages comes always\r\ndecrease of subordination. The knowledge of reading, now becoming\r\ngeneral, and exercised almost exclusively in cheap and worthless\r\nnewspapers, and the progress of the democratic movement, which for good\r\nor for evil is destined to extend itself over the whole earth, make the\r\nworking classes restless and discontented. They chafe under restraints\r\nas unavoidable as illness or death. What floods of nonsense have we not\r\nseen poured out about the conflict between labor and capital? It is the\r\nold fable over again: the strife of the members against the belly.\r\n\r\nGradually has sprung up the feeling that it is degrading to be a\r\nservant; a terrible lion in the path of the quiet housekeeper in search\r\nof _assistants_. There may arise some day a purer and a wiser state of\r\nsociety, wherein the relation of master and man will be satisfactory to\r\nboth. A merchant exercises a much sharper control over his clerk than\r\nover any servant in his house, and it is cheerfully submitted to. The\r\nsoldier, who is worse paid and worse fed than a servant, is a mere\r\npuppet in the hands of his officers, obliged to obey the nod of twenty\r\nmasters, and to do any work he may be ordered to, without the noble\r\nprivilege of 'giving notice;' and yet there is never any difficulty in\r\nobtaining a reasonable supply of soldiers--because clerks and soldiers\r\ndo not think themselves degraded by their positions, and servants _do_.\r\nIt may be a prejudice, but it is one which drives hundreds of women, who\r\nmight be fat and comfortable, to starve themselves over needlework in\r\nhovels; and often to prefer downright vice, if they can hope to conceal\r\nit, to virtue and a home in a respectable family. Any logic, you\r\nperceive, is quite powerless against a prejudice of this size and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nBut is it altogether a prejudice? Is it not a sound view of that\r\ncondition of life?\r\n\r\nI confess that it has long been a matter of surprise to me that men\r\nshould be found willing to hire themselves out for domestic service in a\r\ncountry where bread and meat may so easily be obtained in other ways,\r\nand where even independent manual labor is so often considered\r\nderogatory to the dignity of the native born. To do our dirty work that\r\nit disgusts us to do for ourselves, to stand behind our chairs at table,\r\nto obey our whims and caprices, to have never a moment they can call\r\ntheir own, to keep down their temper when we lose ours, to be compelled\r\nto ask for permission to go out for a walk, seems to me a sad existence\r\neven with good food and wages.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, my dear CONTINENTAL, that the relation between master and\r\nservant has to be readjusted to suit the times. Indeed it is readjusting\r\nitself. We see the signs, although we may not perceive their\r\nsignificance. Our life is a dream. I use this venerable saying in\r\nanother sense than the one generally intended by it: I mean that we live\r\nhalf our lives, if not more, in the imagination; and that the\r\nimagination of every-day people is a dream made up of feelings brought\r\ntogether from the habits, theories, and prejudices of the past of all\r\nlands and all nations of men. The reality that was once in them has long\r\nsince been out of them; yet these vague and shadowy fancies are\r\nall-powerful and govern our actions. So that morally we go about like\r\nmaskers in the carnival, dressed in the old clothes of our ancestors.\r\nWith this difference, that most of us do not see how shabby and\r\nthreadbare they are, and how unsuited to our present wants. And the few\r\nwho do see this have an inbred fondness for the old romantic rags, and\r\nwear some of them in spite of their better judgment. Our moneyed class\r\ncling in particular to the dream of an aristocracy, and love to look\r\ndown upon somebody. The man who made his fortune yesterday calls\r\nto-day's lucky fellow a _nouveau riche_ and a _parvenu_. The counter\r\njumper who has snatched his thousands from a sudden rise in stocks, is\r\nsure to invest some of his winnings in the tatters of feudalism, sports\r\na coat of arms on his carriage, has liveries, talks of his honor as a\r\ngentleman, and expects from his servants the same respect that a baron\r\nof the Middle Ages received from his hinds. It is a dream of most\r\nbaseless fabric. John and Thomas, with their dislike of the word\r\nservant, their surliness and their impudence, swing too far, perhaps, in\r\nthe other direction, but they are more in unison with the spirit of the\r\nage than their masters. I have seen an ardent democrat, who had roared\r\nequal rights from many a stump, furious with the impertinence of a\r\nwaiter, whose answer, if it had come from an equal, he would scarcely\r\nhave noticed. And was not the waiter a man and a fellow voter? What\r\ndistinction of class have we in this country? It is true that the\r\nproperty qualification we have discarded in our political system we have\r\nretained as our test of social position. Indeed, no abstract rights of\r\nman can make up the difference between rich and poor. But Fortune is\r\nnowhere so blind nor so busy in twirling her wheel; and our two classes\r\nare so apt to change places, that frequently the only difference between\r\nthe master and the footman who stands behind him, is the difference of\r\ncapital. And Europe is treading the same democratic path as ourselves,\r\nlimping along after us as fast as her old legs will carry her. The time\r\nwill come when the class from which we have so long enlisted recruits\r\nfor our _batteries de cuisine_ will find some other career better suited\r\nto their expanded views.\r\n\r\nWhat then? Do you suggest that we may lay a hand upon the colored\r\nelement, after the example of our honored President? But\r\n\r\n  'While flares the epaulette like flambeau\r\n  On Corporal Cuff and Ensign Sambo,'\r\n\r\ncan you expect either of these distinguished officers to leave the\r\nservice of the United States for ours? What with intelligent\r\ncontrabandism, emancipation, the right of suffrage, and the right to\r\nride in omnibuses, we fear that their domestic usefulness will be sadly\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nOh for machinery! automaton flunkies, requiring only to be wound up and\r\nkept oiled! What a housekeeping Utopia! Thomson foreshadowed a home\r\nparadise of this kind when he wrote the 'Castle of Indolence:'\r\n\r\n  'You need but wish, and, instantly obeyed,\r\n  Fair ranged the dishes rose and thick the glasses played.'\r\n\r\nBut as yet invention has furnished no reapers and mowers for within\r\ndoors. We have only dumb waiters; poor, creaking things, that break and\r\nsplit, like their flesh-and-blood namesakes, and distribute the smell of\r\nthe kitchen throughout the house. Heine once proposed a society to\r\nameliorate the condition of the rich. He must have meant a model\r\nintelligence office. I wish it had been established, for we may all need\r\nits aid.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to do when we come to the last of the servants? Darwin says\r\nthat the _Formica rufescens_ would perish without its slaves; we are\r\nalmost as dependent as these confederate ants. Our social civilization\r\nis based upon servants. Certainly, the refinements of life, as we\r\nunderstand it, could not exist Without them, and it is difficult to see\r\nhow any business of magnitude could be carried on. Briareus himself\r\ncould not take care of a large country place, with its stables, barns,\r\nhorses, cattle, and crops, even if Mrs. B. had the same physical\r\nadvantages, and was willing to help him. Must we tempt them back by\r\nstill larger salaries, or increase their social consideration, telling\r\nthem, as a certain clergyman once said of his order, that 'they are\r\nsupported, and not hired'?--changing the word help, as we have servant,\r\ninto household officer or assistant manager, or adopt a Chinese\r\neuphemism, such as steward of the table or governor of the kitchen?\r\nFourier does something of this kind; in his system the class names of\r\nyoung scullions are cherubs and seraphs! Or shall we adopt the\r\ncooeperative plan of Mill and others, and offer John an interest in the\r\nfamily--say, possibly, the position of resident son-in-law after ten\r\nyears of honesty, sobriety, and industry--with a seat at table in the\r\nmean while? Or must all the work be done by women, and a proprietor have\r\nto seal his Biddies _more sanctorum_ in Utah? Or might not poor\r\nrelations, now confessedly nuisances, be made useful in this way? Some\r\nmarquis asked Sophie Arnould why she did not discharge her stupid\r\nporter? 'I have often thought of it,' she answered, '_mais que voulez\r\nvous, c'est mon pere_.'\r\n\r\nThese resources failing, we must drop to the simplest form of existence:\r\nhut, hovel, or shanty; where my lord digs and is dirty, and her\r\nladyship, guiltless of Italian, French, and the grand piano, cooks,\r\nscrubs, darns, and keeps the peace between the pigs and the children. Or\r\nelse we must come to socialism, in the shape of Brook Farm communities,\r\nor _phalansteres a la Fourier_, or, worse than either, to mammoth\r\nhotels. American tastes incline that way. There we may live in huge\r\ngilded pens, as characterless as sheep in the flock, attended upon by\r\nwaiters, chambermaids, and cooks, who will have a share in the profits,\r\nand consequently will be happy to do anything to increase the income of\r\ntheir house.\r\n\r\nI see no other remedy, and I offer this great social problem to the\r\nserious thoughts of your readers.\r\n\r\n  Yours ever, G. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.--NO. XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a frequent exclamation of Herder the Great: 'Oh, my life, that\r\nhas failed of its ends!' and many of us, no doubt, find ourselves\r\ndisposed to indulge in the same lament. But it deserves careful\r\nattention; no man's life fails of its true end unless through some\r\ngrievous moral fault of his own.\r\n\r\nThe true end of life is that we may 'glorify God, and enjoy Him\r\nforever.' How this may be attained, as far as outward circumstances or\r\nactivities are concerned, we can hardly judge for ourselves: but there\r\nis one sure test; and that is in the duties of our station. If we\r\nhonestly perform them, and especially as under the teachings of the\r\ngospel of Christ, there can be no real and permanent failure. We shall\r\nhave done what we were set to do upon the earth; and with this we may\r\nwell be content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR GREAT AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe republican government of the United States, when first originated by\r\nthe fathers of the commonwealth, was regarded by the old fossil\r\ndespotisms with secret dread and a strange foreboding; and neither the\r\nridicule which they heaped upon it, nor the professed contempt wherewith\r\nits name was bandied from throne to throne, could wholly mask their\r\ntrepidation. They looked upon it, in the privacy of their chambers, as\r\nthe challenge of a mighty rebellion of the people against all kingly\r\nrule and administration; they saw in it the embodiment of those popular\r\nideas of freedom, equality, and self-government, which for so many\r\ncenturies had been struggling for adequate utterance in England and\r\nFrance, and they knew that the success of this sublime experiment must\r\neventually break asunder the colossal bones of the European monarchies,\r\nand establish the new-born democracy upon their ruins.\r\n\r\nThat they saw truly and judged wisely in these respects, the history of\r\nmodern Europe, and the current revolutions of our time, bear ample\r\ntestimony. There is no luck nor chance in human events, but all things\r\nfollow each other in the legitimate sequences of law. The American\r\nrepublic is no bastard, but a true son and heir of the ages; and sprang\r\nforth in all its bravery and promise from the mammoth loins of the very\r\ndespotism which disowns and denounces it.\r\n\r\nWe have a full and perfect faith in the mission of this republic, which\r\nbreaks open a new seal in the apocalypse of government, and unfolds a\r\nnew phase in the destiny of mankind. Feudalism has had a sufficient\r\ntrial, and, on the whole, has done its work well. After the\r\ndismemberment of the Roman Empire, we do not see how it was possible for\r\nsociety to have assumed any other form than that of kings and princes\r\nfor rulers, and the people for passive and more or less obedient\r\nsubjects. It was a great problem to be resolved how society should exist\r\nat all, and history gives us the solution of it. Despotism in politics\r\nand authority in religion was the grand, primal, leading, and executive\r\nidea of it. What learning and culture existed was confined to the guild\r\nof the ecclesiastics, and they, for the most part, ruled the rulers as\r\nwell as the people, by _virtue of their intelligence_. It required many\r\ncenturies to usher in the dawn of unfettered thought, and generate the\r\nidea of liberty. And when at last the epoch of Protestantism arrived,\r\nand Luther, who was the exponent and historical embodiment of it,\r\ngathered to its armories the spiritual forces then extant in Europe, and\r\noverthrew therewith the immemorial supremacy of kings and priests over\r\nthe bodies and souls of men, he made all subsequent history possible,\r\nand was the planter of nations, and the founder of yet undeveloped\r\ncivilizations.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A doubtful assertion. We, the children of the Puritans, and\r\neducated in their views and prejudices, have still many lessons to learn\r\nin the school of charily. It was not 'Luther who rendered subsequent\r\nhistory possible,' but the ever onward growth of humanity itself. Luther\r\nhad no broader views of liberty of conscience than the church with which\r\nhe struggled. Mr. Hallam says: 'It has been often said that the\r\nessential principle of Protestantism and that for which the struggle was\r\nmade, was something different from all we have mentioned: a perpetual\r\nfreedom from all authority in religious belief, or what goes by the name\r\nof private judgment. But to look more nearly at what occurred, this\r\npermanent independence was not much asserted, and still less acted upon.\r\nThe Reformation was a _change of masters_, a voluntary one, no doubt, in\r\nthose _who had any choice_, and in this sense an exercise, for the time,\r\nof their personal judgment. But no one having gone over to the\r\nConfession of Augsburg or that of Zurich, was deemed at liberty to\r\nmodify these creeds at his pleasure. He might, of course, become an\r\nAnabaptist or Arian, but he was not the less a heretic in doing so than\r\nif he had continued in the Church of Rome. By what light a Protestant\r\nwas to steer, might be a problem which at that time, as ever since, it\r\nwould perplex a theologian to decide: but in practice, the law of the\r\nland which established one exclusive mode of faith, was the only safe,\r\nas, in ordinary circumstances, it was, upon the whole, the most eligible\r\nguide.' Speaking, in another place, of the causes which brought about\r\nthe decline of Protestantism, etc., Mr. Hallam says: 'We ought to reckon\r\nalso among the principal causes of this change, those perpetual\r\ndisputes, those irreconcilable animosities, that bigotry, above all, and\r\npersecuting spirit, which were exhibited in the Lutheran and Calvinistic\r\nchurches. Each began with a common principle--the necessity of an\r\northodox faith. But this orthodoxy meant nothing more than their _own_\r\nbelief as opposed to that of their adversaries; a belief acknowledged to\r\nbe fallible, yet maintained as certain; rejecting authority with one\r\nbreath and appealing to it in the next, and claiming to rest on sure\r\nproofs of reason and Scripture, which their opponents were ready with\r\njust as much confidence to invalidate.'\r\n\r\nLuther was one of the many reformers who, feeling the necessity of\r\nfreedom for themselves, never dream of according it to others. His\r\nself-hold, his 'me,' was masterful, and led him far astray from the\r\ninevitable logic of his perilous position. His 'I-ness' was so supreme\r\nthat he mistook his own convictions for the truths of the Most High--a\r\ncommon mistake among reformers! He did not feel the sovereignty of man\r\nwith regard to his fellow man, his positive inalienable right to deal\r\nwith his God alone in matters of faith and religious conviction. The\r\ngolden rule of our Master, 'Do as you would be done by,' seems simple\r\nand self-evident, and yet it is a late fruit in the garden of human\r\nculture. Mr. Roscoe says: 'When Luther was engaged in his opposition to\r\nthe Church of Rome, he asserted the right of private judgment with the\r\nconfidence and courage of a martyr. But no sooner had he freed his\r\nfollowers from the chains of papal domination, than he forget other in\r\nmany respects equally intolerable: and it was the employment of his\r\nlatter years to counteract the beneficial effects produced by his former\r\nlabors.'\r\n\r\nAny system which saps the foundation of religious liberty, which forces\r\nitself between man and his Maker, cannot guarantee to us one of the main\r\nobjects of all free governments--security in the pursuit of happiness.\r\nThe Reformation did not give us religious freedom, therefore it did not\r\ngive or suggest to us our democratic institutions. All that is true and\r\npure in them springs from the very heart of Christianity itself. 'Where\r\nthe spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.' Much of the manifestation\r\nof the philosophy of freedom depends on individual character. Pope\r\nAlexander III., A.D. 1167, writes: 'Nature having made no slaves, all\r\nmen have an equal right to liberty.' Luther, in 1524, says to the German\r\npeasants; 'You wish to emancipate yourselves from slavery, but slavery\r\nis as old as the world. Abraham had slaves, and St. Paul established\r\nrules for those whom the laws of nations reduced to that state.' Many of\r\nour modern priests reecho these sentiments! Guizot says: 'The\r\nemancipation of the human mind and _absolute_ monarchy triumphed\r\nsimultaneously.' The truth is we want a philosophical history of the\r\nReformation, written neither from a Catholic, Protestant, nor infidel\r\npoint of view, that we may rightly estimate what we lost, what gained in\r\nits wild storms. In judging this, we should not quite forget that it was\r\nthe Catholic Lord Baltimore and Catholic colonists of Maryland who in\r\n1648 first proclaimed on these shores the glorious principle of\r\n_universal toleration_, while the Puritans were persecuting in New\r\nEngland and the Episcopalians in Virginia. 'Nothing extenuate nor aught\r\nset down in malice,' should be the rule of our souls. Humanity means\r\neternal Progress, and its path is onward.--ED. CON.]\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be by no means difficult, were it in accordance with\r\nour present design and purpose, to show that the first germ of\r\nrepublican liberty sprang into life amid the sedges and savage marshes\r\nof uncultivated ages, far remote even from the discovery of America, and\r\ntrace it through successive rebellions, both of a political and\r\nreligious character, from and before the times of Wycliffe, down to\r\nOliver Cromwell and George Washington; for all through English history\r\nit has left a broad red mark behind it, like the auroral pathway of a\r\nconqueror. The first man who prayed without book, and denied the\r\nauthority of the church over the human soul, as the brave Loilards did,\r\nwas the pioneer of Protestantism and the father of all the births which\r\nushered this mighty epoch upon the stage of the world; Protestantism,\r\nwhich means so much and includes so many vast emprises--establishing for\r\nfreedom so grand a battle ground, and for philosophy and learning so\r\nwide and magnificent a dominion.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit which made nonconformists of the first seekers and\r\nworshippers of God apart from the churches and cathedrals of Rome, in\r\nthe sublimer cathedrals of nature, when the Roman hierarchy was master\r\nof Europe--made republicans also of the first rebels who resisted the\r\ntyranny of kings. Political and religious liberty are the two sides of\r\nthe democrat idea, and have always marched hand in hand together. They\r\nculminated in England during the Commonwealth, and became thenceforth\r\nthe base and dome of popular government.\r\n\r\nThe republic of America was born of this idea, and is the last great\r\nbirth of Protestantism, big already with the destinies of mankind. Here,\r\nupon this mighty platform, these destinies, as we believe, have to be\r\nwrought out by their final issues, and close the drama of human\r\ndevelopment. All things are possible for America under the beneficent\r\ninstitutions and laws of the republic, now that the hideous skeleton of\r\nblack slavery is to pollute the soil no more nor make brother war\r\nagainst brother any more on account of it; and at no distant period the\r\nawful conflict which at present shakes the earth with the thunder of its\r\nclashing and embattled hosts, shall give lasting place to the\r\ninterchanges of commerce and the peaceful enterprises of civil life.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that American society could hold together with this\r\naccursed African vulture eating at its heart. Nor could the aristocratic\r\nidea of the South, which slavery had interwoven through every fibre of\r\nthe people, through all the forms of its social condition, and into all\r\nits State laws and institutions, exist side by side with the democratic\r\nidea of the North, without an inevitable conflict sooner or later. The\r\npresent war is but a renewal of the old battles which make up the sum of\r\nhistory, between liberty and despotism, civilization and barbarism. No\r\none can doubt in whose hands will be the victory; and happy will the\r\nresult be for future generations.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have exhibited to the world the amazing spectacle of a\r\nrepublic which, proclaiming the freedom and equality of every one of its\r\nsubjects, holds four millions of men in a terrible and appalling\r\nbondage. So frightful a mockery of freedom, perpetrated in her great\r\nname, and sanctioned by tradition and the authority of law, could not,\r\nought not, be suffered to grin its ghastly laughter in the face of the\r\nworld. And when the hour was ripe, and the doomsday of the monstrous\r\niniquity was proclaimed aloud by the dreadful Nemesis of God, the people\r\nof the free North clothed themselves in the majesty of the nation, and\r\nrose as one man to sweep it from the soil in whirlwinds of fire and\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nSlavery has been an unmitigated curse to America in every one of its\r\naspects and especially to the South, out of which it has eaten, with its\r\nrevengeful and retributive teeth, all the vitalities and grandeurs of\r\ncharacter which belong to the uncorrupted Anglo-Saxon race. It has\r\ndestroyed all the incentives to industry, all self-reliance, and\r\nenterprise, and the sterner virtues and moralities of life. It has put a\r\nban upon trade and manufactures, and a premium upon indolence. The white\r\npopulation--the poor white trash, as the very negroes call them--are\r\nignorant, brutal, and live in the squalor of savages. It has driven\r\nliterature and poetry, art and science, from its soil, and robbed\r\nreligion of all its humanity and beauty. Worse than this, if worse\r\nbe possible, it has darkened with the shadow of its apparition the\r\nminds of the Southerners themselves, and defaced their highest\r\nattributes--confounding within them the great cardinal distinctions\r\nbetween right and wrong, until, abandoned by Heaven, they were given\r\nover to their own lusts, and to a belief in the lie which they had\r\ncreated under the very ribs of the republic.\r\n\r\nWe do not speak this as partisans, nor in any spirit of enmity against\r\nthe South as a political faction. It is the fact which concerns us, and\r\nwhich we deal with as history, and not here and now in any other sense.\r\nNor do we blame the Southern aristocracy for riding so long on the black\r\nhorse, which has at last thrown and killed them. For proud and insolent\r\nas they have ever shown themselves in their bearing toward the North,\r\nthey were in reality mere pawns on the chessboard of Fate, necessary\r\ntools in working out the game of civilization on this continent. Who can\r\ncalculate the sum of the divine forces which the institution of slavery,\r\nand its blasphemous reversion of the commands of the Decalogue, and all\r\nits cruel outrages and inhuman crimes, have awakened in the souls of the\r\nfreemen of the North? The loathsomeness of its example and the infernal\r\nmalice of its designs against liberty and truth, righteousness and\r\njustice, and whatsoever holy principles in life and government the\r\nsaints, martyrs, and apostles of the ages have won for us, by their\r\nagony and bloody sweat upon scaffolds and funeral pyres--regarding them\r\nas a cheap purchase, though paid for by such high and costly\r\nsacrifices--these appalling instances, we say, have at last produced so\r\npowerful a reaction in the national mind that millions of men have\r\nmarshalled themselves into avenging armies to rid the earth of their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThat, too, was fated and necessary, and a part of the predestined\r\nprogramme. The nation could not progress with this corrupting monster in\r\nits pathway; and the battle between them has not come an hour too soon.\r\nThe monster must be exterminated, and that, too, without mercy and\r\nwithout compassion, as the sworn and implacable enemy both of God and\r\nman. Otherwise this glorious country, which has so long worn the garland\r\nand surging robe of liberty, will become a dungeon of desolation from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific, resounding only with the shrieks of\r\nmandrakes and the clank of chains.\r\n\r\nThis obstruction removed, there is, as we said above, no height of\r\ngreatness which the American people may not reach. Then, and then only,\r\nshall we begin to consolidate ourselves into a nation, with a distinct\r\norganon of principles, feelings, and loyalties, to which the mighty\r\nheart and brain of the people shall throb and vibrate in pulsations of\r\nsublime unity. At present we are only a people in the making, and very\r\nfew there are calling themselves Americans who have any idea of what\r\nAmerica is and means in relation to history. By and by we shall all\r\napprehend the riddle more wisely, and be more worthy of the great name\r\nwe bear.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile it is no marvel that we are not a homogeneous people.\r\nOur time has not come for that, and may yet lie afar off in the shadowy\r\ncenturies. Consider how and through what alien sources we have\r\nmultiplied the original population of the associated colonies as they\r\nexisted when our fathers raised them to a nationality. There is not a\r\nnation in all Europe, to say nothing of Asia and the islands, which is\r\nnot represented in our blood and does not form a part of our lineage. It\r\nis true that the old type predominates, and that we have the virtues and\r\nthe vices of the Anglo-Saxons in us; but we are far too individual at\r\npresent, Celt and Dane and Spaniard and Teuton, and all the rest of our\r\nmotley humanities, will have to be fused into one great Anglo-American\r\nrace, before we can call ourselves a distinct nation. It took England\r\nmany centuries to accomplish this work, and fashion herself into the\r\nplastic form and comeliness of her present unity and proportion. We, who\r\nwork at high pressure and make haste in our begettings and growth, can\r\nscarcely hope to make a national sculpture at all commensurate with the\r\ngenius of the people and the continent, in one or two or even half a\r\ndozen generations; for we cannot coerce the laws of nature, although it\r\nis quite certain, from what we have done, that we can perform anything\r\nwithin the range of possible achievement.\r\n\r\nWe have all the elements within and around us necessary to constitute a\r\ngreat people. We started on our career with a long background of\r\nexperience to guide and to warn us. We saw what Europe had done for\r\ncivilization with her long roll of kings and priests, her despotic\r\ngovernments, and her unequal laws--the people in most cases ciphers, and\r\nin all cases ignorant and enslaved--with no room for expansion, and\r\nlittle or no hope of political or social betterment; every inch of\r\nliberty, in every direction, which they had gained, wrung from their\r\noppressors piecemeal, in bloody throes of agony.\r\n\r\nOur fathers had not the best materials out of which to build up a\r\nrepublic; neither, in all cases, were they themselves sufficiently ripe\r\nfor the experiment. They had the old leaven of European prejudice\r\nlargely intermingled in their minds and character. They could not help,\r\nit is true, their original make, nor the fashioning which their age,\r\ntime, and circumstances had put upon them. All this has to be taken into\r\nthe estimate of any philosophical judgment respecting their\r\nperformances. But they had learned from the past to trust the present,\r\nand to span the future with rainbows of hope. They stood face to face\r\nwith the people, and each looked into the others' eyes and read there\r\nthe grounds and sureties of an immortal triumph. Instead, therefore, of\r\nresting the supreme power of government in the hands of a person, or a\r\nclass, making the former a monarch, and creating the other an\r\naristocracy, those grand magistrates and senators of human liberty who\r\nframed the Constitution of the new American Nation, made the nation its\r\nown sovereign, and clothed it with the authority and majesty of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nA venture so daring, and of an audacity so Titanic and sublime, seemed\r\nat that time and long afterward to require the wisdom and omnipotence of\r\ngods to guide it over the breakers, and steer it into the calm waters of\r\nintelligent government. All the world, except the handful of thinkers\r\nand enthusiasts scattered here and there over Europe, was against it,\r\nmocked at its bravery and aspirations, and sincerely hoped and believed\r\nthat some great and sudden calamity would dissolve it like a baleful\r\nenchantment. But the hope of the republic was in the people, and they\r\njustified the fathers and the institution.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, was opened in all the directions of human inquiry and\r\naction a new world of hope and promise. The people were no longer bound\r\nby old traditions, nor clogged by any formulas of state religions, nor\r\nhampered by the dicta of philosophical authority. Their minds were free\r\nto choose or to reject whatever propositions were presented to them from\r\nthe wide region of speculation and belief. The Constitution was the only\r\ninstrument which prescribed laws and principles for their unconditional\r\nacceptance and guidance; and this was a thing of their own choice, the\r\ncharter and seal of their liberties, to which they rendered a cheerful\r\nand grateful obedience.\r\n\r\nWith this mighty security for a platform, they pursued their daily\r\navocations in peace, trusting their own souls, and working out the\r\nproblem of republican society, with a most healthy unconsciousness.\r\nSincere and earnest, they troubled themselves with no social theories,\r\nno visions of Utopia, nor dreams of Paradise and El Dorados, leaving the\r\nspirit which animated them to build up the architecture of its own\r\n_cultus_, with an unexpressed but perfect faith in the final justice and\r\nsatisfaction of results.\r\n\r\nReligion, therefore, and politics--literature, learning, and art--trade,\r\ncommerce, manufactures, agriculture--and the amenities of society and\r\nmanners, were allowed to develop themselves in their own way, without\r\nreference to rule and preconcerted dogmas. Hence the peculiarities which\r\nmark the institutions of America--their utter freedom from cant and the\r\nshows and pageantry of state. Bank, titles, and caste were abolished;\r\nand the enormous gulfs which separate the European man from the European\r\nlordling were bridged over by Equality with the solid virtues of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nWhat a stride was here taken over time and space, and the historic\r\nrecords of man, in the fossil formations of the Old World during the\r\nante-American periods! It had come at last, this long-prophesied reign\r\nof Apollo and the Muses, of freedom and the rights of man. Afar off, on\r\nthe summits of imaginative mountains, were beheld, through twilight\r\nvistas of night and chaos, the proud ruins of dead monarchies, and the\r\ncruel forms of extinct tyrannies and oppressions, crowned and mitred no\r\nmore; whose mandates had once made the nations tremble, and before whose\r\njudgment seats Mercy pleaded in vain, and Justice muffled up her face\r\nand sat dumb and weeping in the dust. Over the wolds of their desolation\r\nhyenas prowled, snuffing the noisome air as for a living prey; ghouls\r\nand vampyres shrieked in hellish chorus, as they tore up forgotten\r\ngraves; and all manner of hateful and obscure things crawled familiarly\r\nin and out of palaces and holy places, as if they were the ghosts of the\r\nformer inhabitants; and, high above them all, in the bloody light of the\r\nsetting sun, wheeled kites and choughs and solitary vultures; owls and\r\ndismal bats flitting, ever and anon, athwart the shadows of their grim\r\nprocessions.\r\n\r\nNo matter that this vision was in reality but the symbolism of\r\nimagination and poetry, that Europe was not dead, but alive with the\r\nstruggling vitalities of good and evil, and all those contending forces\r\nout of which American freedom was born--the vision itself was not the\r\nless true, either as feeling or insight; for Europe was now literally\r\ncut adrift from America, and the hopes and aspirations of the young\r\nrepublic were entirely different from hers, and removed altogether from\r\nthe plane of her orbit and action.\r\n\r\nThe liberalists and thinkers of the age expected great things from a\r\npeople thus fortunately conditioned and circumstanced. For the first\r\ntime in modern history a genuine democratic government was inaugurated\r\nand fairly put upon its trial. The horizon of thought was now to be\r\npushed back far beyond the old frontiers into the very regions of the\r\ninfinite; and a universal liberty was to prevail throughout the length\r\nand breadth of the land. No more dead formalities, nor slavish\r\nsubmissions, but new and fuller life, self-reliance, self-development,\r\nand the freest individuality. Gladly the people accepted the\r\npropositions and principles of their national existence. Not a doubt\r\nanywhere of the result; no faltering, no looking back; but brave hearts,\r\neverywhere, and bold fronts, and conquering souls. Before them, through\r\nthe mists of the starry twilight, loomed the mountain peaks and shadowy\r\nseas of the unventured and unknown future; and thitherward they pressed\r\nwith undaunted steps, and with a haughty and sublime defiance of\r\nobstructions and dangers; fearing God, doing their best, and leaving the\r\nissue in His hands.\r\n\r\nWe know now, after nearly a hundred years of trial, what that issue in\r\nthe main is, and whitherward it still tends. During that little\r\nbreathing time, which, compared with the life of other nations, is but a\r\ngasp in the record, what unspeakable triumphs have been accomplished!\r\nNearly a whole continent has been reclaimed from the savage and the wild\r\nbeasts, and the all-conquering American has paved the wilderness, east,\r\nwest, north, and south, with high roads--dug canals into its hidden\r\nrecesses, connected the great Gulf with the far-off West by a vast\r\nnetwork of railways and telegraphs--planted cities and villages\r\neverywhere, and fashioned the routes of civilization; bound Cape Race to\r\nthe Crescent City and the Atlantic to the Pacific, sending human\r\nthoughts, winged with lightning, across thousands of miles of plains and\r\nmountains and rivers, and making neighborly the most distant peoples and\r\nthe most widely sundered States of the mighty Union. Let any man try to\r\nestimate the value of this immense contribution to human history and\r\nhappiness; let him try to measure the vast extent of empire which it\r\ncovers, and sum up the mighty expenditure of physical and intellectual\r\nlabor which has conquered those savage wilds, and converted them into\r\nblooming cornfields and orchards; which has built these miraculous\r\ncities by the sea, and made their harbors populous with native ships and\r\nthe marine of every nation under heaven; those busy inland cities, the\r\nhives of manufacturing industry and the marts of a commerce which\r\nextends over all the regions of civilization, from the rising to the\r\nsetting sun; those innumerable towns of the great corn-growing\r\ndistricts; those pleasant hamlets and pastoral homes which fringe the\r\nforest, and girdle the mountains as with the arms of human affection and\r\nthe passion of love; those mills on the far-off rivers, whose creaking\r\nmachinery and revolving wheels are the prelude of a yet unborn, but\r\nrapidly approaching civility, and whose music, heard by the right ears,\r\nis of the divinest depth and diapason, and in full concord with the\r\nimmeasurable orchestra of triumph and rejoicing which the nation\r\ncelebrates in the perpetual marches of her starry progress.\r\n\r\nNo man can compass this vast dominion, and no intellect can plumb its\r\nsoundings or prophesy of its upshot. Who could have foretold what has\r\nalready happened on this continent, had he stood with the Pilgrim\r\nFathers on Plymouth Rock, that memorable day of the landing? Looking\r\nback to that great epoch in American history, we have no dim regions of\r\nantiquity to traverse, no mythic periods as of Memnon and the Nile, but\r\na mere modern landscape, so to speak, shut in by less than two\r\ncenturies. And yet what unspeakable things are included in that brief\r\nperiod! If we have made such vast strides and so rapid a development in\r\nthose few years of our national life, with the heterogeneous and\r\nunmalleable materials with which we had to deal, converting the filth of\r\nEurope into grass and flowers for the decoration of the republic, what\r\nmay we not achieve hereafter, when this dreadful war is over, and the\r\nnegro question is adjusted, and the sundered States are reunited, and\r\nthe Western wilderness is clothed with the glory of a perfect\r\ncultivation, and the genius of the people, no longer trammelled by\r\nSouthern despotism, shall have free room to wing its flight over the\r\nimmeasurable future?\r\n\r\nThere will be no likeness, in any mirror of the past, to the American\r\ncivilization that is to be. New manners, customs, thinkings, literature,\r\nart, and life, will mark our progress and attest the mission of the\r\nnation. We are fast outgrowing the ideas and influences of that brave\r\ncompany of Puritans out of whose loins our beginning proceeded; and\r\nalready each man goes alone, insular, self-reliant, and self-sustained.\r\nWe owe the Puritans a large debt, but it is altogether a pretty fiction\r\nto call them the founders of American civilization. They helped to lay\r\nin the foundation stones of that early society, and kept them together\r\nby cementing them with their love of religious truth and liberty, so far\r\nas they understood these primal elements of a state; and we are likewise\r\ntheir debtors for the integrity which they put into their laws and\r\ngovernment. But it is too high a demand to claim for them that they were\r\nthe founders of the republic, and the originators of those great ideas\r\nwhich are embodied in our institutions and literature.\r\n\r\nThey came to this country with no very enlarged notions, either of\r\nreligion or freedom, although they were perfectly sincere in their\r\nprofessions of regard for both; and it was this very sincerity which\r\ngave solidity and permanence to their colonies. We suppose we may repeat\r\nwhat history has made notorious respecting them, that they were, both in\r\nbelief and civil practice, very narrow and limited in their\r\noutlooks--by no means given to intellectual speculations--and with but\r\nlittle faith in the intellect itself--which, indeed, was proscribed as a\r\nsort of outlaw when it stood upon its own authority, outside the pale of\r\n_their_ church. The religion which they established had its origin in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, and was a sort of revived Lollardism, which last\r\ndated as far back as Wycliffe, long before the Reformation. They thought\r\nthey could worship God in conventicles, and in the great open-air\r\ncathedrals of nature, with quite as much purity of motive and heavenly\r\nacceptance as in regularly consecrated churches, and that the right of\r\npraying and preaching was inalienable, and secured to all godly men by\r\nthe charter and seal of Calvary.\r\n\r\nThey had no idea, however, of non-conformity which was not based upon an\r\northodox creed, upon _their_ creed, as they subscribed it on Plymouth\r\nRock. They fled from persecution themselves, and sought freedom for\r\nthemselves in the barren regions of our dear and now hospitable New\r\nEngland; and they, in their simplicity and good faith before God, sought\r\nto organize a system of civil and religious polity which should incrust\r\nall future generations, and harden them into a fossil state of perpetual\r\northodoxy.\r\n\r\nThey were a stern, implacable race, these early fathers, in all that\r\nrelated to belief, and the discipline of moral conduct; and we owe many\r\nof the granite securities which lie at the bottom of our social life and\r\ngovernment to this harsh and unyielding sternness. It held the framework\r\nof the colonies together until they were consolidated into the United\r\nStates, and until the modern culture of the people relaxed it into a\r\nuniversal liberty of thought and worship.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans, however, had no notion of such a result to their teachings\r\nand labors; and would have looked with pious horror upon them if they\r\ncould have beheld them in some Agrippa's mirror of the future.\r\n\r\nThe truth--unpalatable as it may be--is simply this about the Puritans:\r\nthey were narrow-minded, bigoted, and furious at times with the spirit\r\nof persecution; sincerely so, it is true, and believing they did God\r\nservice; but that does not alter the fact. They had no conception\r\nof the meaning of liberty--and especially of religious liberty as a\r\ndevelopment of Protestantism. Their idea of it was liberty for\r\nthemselves--persecution to all who differed from them; and this, too,\r\nfor Christ's sake, in order that the lost sheep might be brought back,\r\nif possible, to their bleak and comfortless folds. They could not help\r\nit; they meant no wrong by it, and the evil which they thus did was good\r\nin the making, and sprang from the bleeding heart of an infinite love.\r\n\r\nWe like them, nevertheless; and cannot choose but like them, thinking it\r\ngenerous and loving to invest them with as much poetry as we can command\r\nfrom the wardrobes of the imagination. But we can never forgive them--in\r\ncritical moods--for their inhuman, although strictly logical persecution\r\nof Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, who represented in his\r\nperson all the liberal-thoughts-men, both in religion and speculation,\r\nthen existing on this continent.\r\n\r\nThis man of capacious intellect and most humane heart was hunted by them\r\nout of the associated colonies, as if he had been some ferocious beast\r\nof prey, because he differed from them in his religious opinions; and\r\nthis drove him to found a state in accordance with the most liberal\r\ninterpretation of Christianity. He had more than once, by his influence\r\nwith the Indians, saved them from a general massacre; but their\r\ntheological hate of him was so intense that they would not allow him to\r\npass through their territories on a necessary journey; and once, on his\r\nreturn from England, where he had been negotiating with ministers for\r\ntheir benefit, they capped the climax of their bigoted ingratitude by\r\nrefusing him permission even to land on their soil, lest his holy feet\r\nshould pollute it.\r\n\r\nIt is a little too much, therefore, to say that all our ideas of liberty\r\nand religion have sprung from this stout race of persecutors. They were\r\npioneers for us, bu nothing more. Our progress has been the untying of\r\ntheir old cords of mental oppression, and the undoing of many things\r\nwhich they had set up. This was so much rubbish to be moved out of the\r\npath of the nation, and by no means aids to its advancement, except as\r\nprovocatives. What we now are, we have become by our own culture and\r\ndevelopment, and by the inflowing of those great modern ideas which have\r\naffected all the world, and helped to build up its civilization into\r\nsuch stately proportions.\r\n\r\nPuritanism, as it then existed in its exclusive power, is, to all\r\nintents and purposes, dead upon this continent. The form of it still\r\nlingers in our midst, it is true, and in the Protestant parts of Europe\r\nits ritual survives, and pious hearts, which would be pious in spite of\r\nit, still cling to its dead corpse as if it were alive, and kindle their\r\nsacred fires upon the altar of its wellnigh forsaken sanctuaries. We\r\nshould count it no gain to us, however--the extinction of this old and\r\nvenerable faith--if we had no high and certain assurance that a nobler\r\nand sublimer religion was reserved for our consolation and guidance. We\r\ncannot afford, in one sense, to give up even the semblances and shows of\r\nreligion, and these will survive until the new dayspring from on high\r\nshall supersede the necessity of their existence. 'Take care,' said\r\nGoethe, in some such words as these, 'lest, in letting the dead forms of\r\nreligion go, you sacrifice all reverence and worship, and thus lose\r\nreligion itself!' There is great danger of this in the transition state\r\nof human thought and speculation which marks the present crisis of\r\nAmerican history. We are not a religious people, and shall not present\r\nany development of that sort until the intellectual reaction which has\r\nset in among us against the old modes and organons of belief has\r\nexhausted the tests of its crucibles, and reduced the dross to a\r\nresiduum of gold which shall form the basis of a new and sacred\r\ncurrency, acceptable to all men for the highest interchanges.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while we must work out the problem of this religion of the\r\nfuture in any and all ways which lie open to us--doubting nothing of the\r\nfinal issues. The wildest theories of Millerites, Spiritists,\r\nNaturalists, and Supernaturalists, are all genuine products of the time,\r\nand of the spirit of man struggling upward to this solution--blindly\r\nstruggling, it is true, but gradually approaching the light of the\r\nfar-off truth, as the twilight monsters of geology gradually approached\r\nthe far-off birth of man, who came at last, and redeemed the savage\r\nprogressive, the apparent wild unreason of the terrestrial creation.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that this great fratricidal war with which we\r\nare now struggling, will prove, in its results, of the very highest\r\nservice to the nation, and make us all both better and wiser men than we\r\nwere before. We have already gained by it many notable experiences, and\r\nit has put our wisdom, and our foolishness also, to the test. It has\r\nboth humbled and exalted our pride. It has cut away from the national\r\ncharacter all those inane excrescences of vanity and brag which\r\njudicious people everywhere, who were friendly to us, could not choose\r\nbut lament to see us exercise at such large discretion. It has brought\r\nus face to face with realities the most terrible the world has ever\r\nbeheld. It has measured our strength and our weakness, and has developed\r\nwithin us the mightiest intellectual and physical resources. All the wit\r\nand virtue which go to make up a great people have been proven in a\r\nhundred times and ways during the war, to exist in us. Courage,\r\nforethought, endurance, self-sacrifice, magnaminity, and a noble sense\r\nof honor, are a few of the virtues which we have cropped from the bloody\r\nharvest of the battle field.\r\n\r\nIt is true that wicked men are among us--for when did a company, godly\r\nor otherwise, engage in any work, and Satan did not also fling his\r\nwallet over his shoulder and set out with them for evil purposes of his\r\nown?--but after all, these are but a small minority, and their efforts\r\nto ruin the republic and bring defeat and dishonor upon the Federal\r\narms, have not yet proved to be of a very formidable nature. These, the\r\nenemies of America, though her native-born sons, the people can afford\r\nto treat with the contempt which they merit. For the rest, this war will\r\nmake us a nation, and bind us together with bonds as strong as those of\r\nthe old European nationalities. It will make us great, and loving\r\npatriots also; and root out from among us a vast amount of sham and\r\npolitical fraud, to the great bettering of society.\r\n\r\nWe shall have reason in many ways to bless its coming and its\r\nconsequences. It was indeed just as necessary to our future national\r\nlife and happiness as the bursting out of a volcano is to the general\r\nsafety of the earth. It will destroy slavery for ever, and thus relieve\r\nus from the great contention which has so long and so bitterly occupied\r\nthe lives of our public men and the thoughts of the world. In reality,\r\nwe have never yet given republicanism a fair trial upon this continent.\r\nWith that dreadful curse and crime of slavery tearing at its heart and\r\nbrain, how was it possible for equality and self-government to be\r\nanything else but a delusion and a mockery? This cleared out of our\r\npathway, and we have enough virtue, intelligence, and wealth of physical\r\nresources in the land to realize the prophecy and the hope of all noble\r\nthinkers and believes on the planet, and place America first and\r\nforemost among the nations--the richest, the wisest, the best, and the\r\nbravest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe corruption of a noble disposition is invariably from some false\r\ncharm of fancy or imagination which has over-mastered the mind with its\r\npowerful magic and carried away the will captive. It is some perverted\r\napprehension or illusory power of the infinite which causes a man who\r\nhas once fallen a prey to any strong passion to devote all his energies,\r\nthoughts, and feelings to _one_ object, or to surrender himself, heart\r\nand soul, to the despotic tyranny of some favorite pursuit. For man's\r\nnatural longing after the infinite, even when showing itself in his\r\npassions and feelings, cannot, where genuine, be satisfied with any\r\nearthly object or sensual gratification or external possession. When,\r\nhowever, this pursuit, keeping itself free from all delusions of sense,\r\nreally directs its endeavor toward the infinite, and only to what is\r\ntruly such, it can never rest or be stationary. Ever advancing, step by\r\nstep, it ever rises higher and higher. This pure feeling of endless\r\nlonging, with the dim memories of eternal love ever surging through the\r\nsoul, are the heavenward--bearing wings which bear it ever on toward\r\nGod. Longing is man's intuition of enternity!--SCHLEGEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF THE HOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  Strong in faith for the future,\r\n    Drawing our hope from the past,\r\n  Manfully standing to battle,\r\n    However may blow the blast:\r\n  Onward still pressing undaunted,\r\n    Let the foe be strong as he may,\r\n  Though the sky be dark as midnight,\r\n    Remembering the dawn of day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  Strong in the cause of freedom,\r\n    Bold for the sake of right,\r\n  Watchful and ready always,\r\n    Alert by day and night:\r\n  With a sword for the foe of freedom,\r\n    From whatever side he come,\r\n  The same for the open foeman\r\n    And the traitorous friend at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  Strong with the arm uplifted,\r\n    And nerved with God's own might,\r\n  In an age of glory living\r\n    In a holy cause to fight:\r\n  And whilom catching music\r\n    Of the future's minstrelsy,\r\n  As those who strike for freedom\r\n    Blows that can never die.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IV.\r\n\r\n  Strong, though the world may threaten,\r\n    Though thrones may totter down,\r\n  And in many an Old World palace,\r\n    Uneasy sits the crown:\r\n  Not for the present only\r\n    Is the war we wage to-day,\r\n  But the sound shall echo ever\r\n    When we shall have passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n  V.\r\n\r\n  Strong--'tis an age of glory,\r\n    And worth a thousand years\r\n  Of petty, weak disputings,\r\n    Of ambitious hopes and fears:\r\n  And we, if we learn the lesson\r\n    All-glorious and sublime,\r\n  Shall go down to future ages\r\n    As heroes for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VI.\r\n\r\n  Strong--not in human boasting,\r\n    But with high and holy will,\r\n  The means of a mighty Worker\r\n    His purpose to fulfil:\r\n  O patient warriors, watchers--\r\n    A thousandfold your power\r\n  If ye read with prayerful purpose\r\n    The Lesson of the Hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE: ITS CHARACTER AND RELATION TO OTHER\r\nLANGUAGES.\r\n\r\n_ARTICLE ONE._\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CONTINENTAL for May contained an article, written by Stephen Pearl\r\nAndrews, entitled: A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE: ITS POSSIBILITY, SCIENTIFIC\r\nNECESSITY, AND APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS. Although then treated\r\nhypothetically, or as something not impossible of achievement _in the\r\nfuture_, a Language constructed upon the method therein briefly and\r\ngenerally explained, is, in fact, substantially completed at the present\r\ntime. It is one of the developments of a new and vast scientific\r\ndiscovery--comprising the Fundamental Principles of all Thought and\r\nBeing, and the Law of Analogy--on which Mr. Andrews has bestowed the\r\nname of UNIVERSOLOGY. The public announcement of this discovery,\r\ntogether with a general statement of its character, has been recently\r\nmade in the columns of a leading literary paper--_The Home Journal._\r\n\r\nAlthough the principle involved in the Language discussed in the article\r\nreferred to is wholly different from that upon which all former attempts\r\nat the construction of a common method of lingual communication have\r\nbeen based; and although such merely mechanical _inventions_ were\r\ntherein distinguished from a Language _discovered as existing in the\r\nnature of things_; several criticisms, emanating from high literary\r\nquarters, indicate that there is still much misunderstanding as to the\r\nreal nature of a Universal Language framed upon the principles of\r\nAnalogy between Sense and Sound. This misunderstanding seems most\r\nprevalent in respect to the two points relating directly to the\r\npractical utility of such a Lingual Organ. It is assumed that a Language\r\nso constituted must be wholly different in its material and structure\r\nfrom any now existing, and that the latter would have to be abandoned as\r\nsoon as the former was adopted. It is supposed, therefore, that in\r\norder to introduce the SCIENTIFIC UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE, the people must be\r\ninduced to learn something entirely new, and to forsake for it their old\r\nand cherished Mother-tongues. The accomplishment of such an undertaking\r\nis naturally regarded as highly improbable, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is also supposed that every word of the Language is to be determined\r\nin accordance with exact scientific formulas;--a process which, if\r\nemployed, would, as is conceived, give a stiff, inflexible, monotonous,\r\nand cramped character to the Language itself; and would be wanting in\r\nthat profusion of synonymes which gives an artistic and life-like\r\ncharacter to the lingual growths of the past.\r\n\r\nBoth of these objections arise, as we shall hereafter see, from an\r\nerroneous impression of the nature of Language based on Analogy, coupled\r\nwith a misconception of the real character and constituents of existing\r\nLanguages. It is the purpose of the present papers to correct these\r\nfalse notions. In order to do so--and, what is essential to this, to\r\npresent a clear exposition of the true character of the Language under\r\nconsideration, and of its relations to the Lingual Structures of the\r\npast and present--it is necessary to give a preliminary examination to\r\nthe fundamental question of the Origin of Speech. By means of this\r\nexamination we shall come to understand that the existence and general\r\nuse of a Universal Language with the elements of which Nature has\r\nherself furnished us, would not involve the abrupt or total abandonment\r\nof the Tongues now commonly employed; but, on the contrary, while\r\npreserving all that is substantially valuable in each, would enable us\r\nto acquire a knowledge of them with a facility which Comparative\r\nPhilology, as now developed, lays no claim to impart.\r\n\r\nHow, then, did Language originate? In setting out to answer this\r\nquestion, Professor Max Mueller says, in his _Lectures on the Science of\r\nLanguage_:[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Lectures on the Science of Language, delivered at the Royal\r\nInstitution of Great Britain, in April, May, and June, 1861, by Max\r\nMueller, M. A. From the second London edition, revised. New York: Charles\r\nScribner, 124 Grand street. 1862.]\r\n\r\n     'If we were asked the riddle how images of the eye and all the\r\n     sensations of our senses could be represented by sounds, nay, could\r\n     be so embodied in sounds as to express thought and to excite\r\n     thought, we should probably give it up as the question of a madman,\r\n     who, mixing up the most heterogeneous subjects, attempted to change\r\n     color and sound into thought. Yet this is the riddle we have now to\r\n     solve.\r\n\r\n     'It is quite clear that we have no means of solving the problem of\r\n     the origin of language _historically_, or of explaining it as a\r\n     matter of fact which happened once in a certain locality and at a\r\n     certain time. History does not begin till long after mankind had\r\n     acquired the power of language, and even the most ancient\r\n     traditions are silent as to the manner in which man came in\r\n     possession of his earliest thoughts and words. Nothing, no doubt,\r\n     would be more interesting than to know from historical documents\r\n     the exact process by which the first man began to lisp his first\r\n     words, and thus to be rid forever of all the theories on the origin\r\n     of speech. But this knowledge is denied us; and, if it had been\r\n     otherwise, we should probably be quite unable to understand those\r\n     primitive events in the history of the human mind. We are told that\r\n     the first man was the son of God, that God created him in His own\r\n     image, formed him of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his\r\n     nostrils the breath of life. These are simple facts, and to be\r\n     accepted as such; if we begin to reason on them, the edge of the\r\n     human understanding glances off. Our mind is so constituted that it\r\n     cannot apprehend the absolute beginning or the absolute end of\r\n     anything. If we tried to conceive the first man created as a child,\r\n     and gradually unfolding his physical and mental powers, we could\r\n     not understand his living for _one_ day without supernatural aid.\r\n     If, on the contrary, we tried to conceive the first man created\r\n     full-grown in body and mind; the conception of an effect without a\r\n     cause, of a full-grown mind without a previous growth, would\r\n     equally transcend our reasoning powers. It is the same with the\r\n     first beginnings of language. Theologians who claim for language a\r\n     divine origin, ... when they enter into any details as to the\r\n     manner in which they suppose Deity to have compiled a dictionary\r\n     and grammar in order to teach them to the first man, as a\r\n     schoolmaster teaches the deaf and dumb, ... have explained no more\r\n     than how the first man might have learnt a language, if there was a\r\n     language ready made for him. How that language was made would\r\n     remain as great a mystery as ever. Philosophers, on the contrary,\r\n     who imagine that the first man, though left to himself, would\r\n     gradually have emerged from a state of mutism and have invented\r\n     words for every new conception that arose in his mind, forget that\r\n     man could not, by his own power, have acquired _the faculty_ of\r\n     speech, which is the distinctive character of mankind, unattained\r\n     and unattainable by the mute creation. It shows a want of\r\n     appreciation as to the real bearings of our problem, if\r\n     philosophers appeal to the fact that children are born without\r\n     language, and gradually emerge from mutism to the full command of\r\n     articulate speech.... Children, in learning to speak, do not invent\r\n     language. Language is there ready made for them. It has been there\r\n     for thousands of years. They acquire the use of a language, and, as\r\n     they grow up, they may acquire the use of a second and a third. It\r\n     is useless to inquire whether infants, left to themselves, would\r\n     invent a language.... All we know for certain is, that an English\r\n     child, if left to itself, would never begin to speak English, and\r\n     that history supplies no instance of any language having thus been\r\n     invented....\r\n\r\n     'Speech is a specific faculty of man. It distinguishes man from all\r\n     other creatures; and if we wish to acquire more definite ideas as\r\n     to the real nature of human speech, all we can do is to compare man\r\n     with those animals that seem to come nearest to him, and thus to\r\n     try to discover what he shares in common with these animals, and\r\n     what is peculiar to him, and to him alone. After we have discovered\r\n     this we may proceed to inquire into the conditions under which\r\n     speech becomes possible, and we shall then have done all that we\r\n     can do, considering that the instruments of our knowledge,\r\n     wonderful as they are, are yet too weak to carry us into all the\r\n     regions to which we may soar on the wings of our imagination.'\r\n\r\nAs the result of a comparison of the human with the animal kingdom,\r\nProfessor Mueller remarks that, 'no one can doubt that certain animals\r\npossess all the physical acquirements for articulate speech. There is no\r\nletter of the alphabet which a parrot will not learn to pronounce. The\r\nfact, therefore, that the parrot is without a language of his own, must\r\nbe explained by a difference between the _mental_, not between the\r\n_physical_ faculties of the animal and man; and it is by a comparison of\r\nthe mental faculties alone, such as we find them in man and brutes, that\r\nwe may hope to discover what constitutes the indispensable qualification\r\nfor language, a qualification to be found in man alone, and in no other\r\ncreature on earth.'\r\n\r\nOf mental faculties, the author whose ideas we are stating, claims a\r\nlarge share for the higher animals. 'These animals have _sensation_,\r\n_perception_, _memory_, _will_, and _intellect_, only we must restrict\r\nintellect to the comparing or interlacing of single perceptions.' But\r\nman transcends in his mental powers the barriers of the brute intellect\r\nat a point which coincides with the starting-point of language. And in\r\nthis coincidence Professor Mueller endeavors to find a sufficiently\r\nfundamental explanation of the problem of the origin of language.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this point of coincidence, he quotes Locke as saying\r\nthat, 'the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect\r\ndistinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the\r\nfaculties of brutes do by no means attain to,' and then adds:\r\n\r\n     'If Locke is right in considering the having of general ideas as\r\n     the distinguishing feature between man and brutes, and, if we\r\n     ourselves are right in pointing to language as the one palpable\r\n     distinction between the two, it would seem to follow that language\r\n     is the outward sign and realization of that inward faculty which\r\n     is called the faculty of abstraction, but which is better known to\r\n     us by the homely name of reason.\r\n\r\n     'Let us now look back to the result of former lectures. It was\r\n     this: After we had explained everything in the growth of language\r\n     that can be explained, there remained in the end, as the only\r\n     inexplicable residuum, what we called _roots_. These roots formed\r\n     the constituent elements of all languages.... What, then, are these\r\n     roots?'\r\n\r\nTwo theories have been started to solve this problem: the Onomatopoetic,\r\naccording to which roots are imitations of sounds; and the\r\nInterjectional, which regards them as involuntary ejaculations. Having\r\ndiscussed these theories, and taken the position that, although there\r\nare roots in every language which are respectively imitations of sounds\r\nand involuntary exclamations, it is, nevertheless, impossible to regard\r\nany considerable number of roots, and much less, all roots, as\r\noriginating from these sources, the distinguished Philologist announces\r\nas the true theory, that every root 'expresses a general, not an\r\nindividual, idea;' just the opposite of what he deems would be the case\r\nif the Onomatopoetic and Interjectional theories explained the origin of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nSome paragraphs are then devoted to the examination of the merits of a\r\ncontroversy which has existed among philosophers as to\r\n\r\n     'whether language originated in general appellations, or in proper\r\n     names. It is the question of the _primum cognitum_, and its\r\n     consideration will help us perhaps in discovering the true nature\r\n     of the root, or the _primum appellatum_. Some philosophers, among\r\n     whom I may mention Locke, Condillac, Adam Smith, Dr. Brown, and,\r\n     with some qualification, Dugald Stewart, maintain that all terms,\r\n     as at first employed, are expressive of individual objects. I quote\r\n     from Adam Smith. 'The assignation,' he says, 'of particular names\r\n     to denote particular objects, that is, the institution of nouns\r\n     substantive, would probably be one of the first steps toward the\r\n     formation of language.... The particular cave whose covering\r\n     sheltered them from the weather, the particular tree whose fruit\r\n     relieved their hunger, the particular fountain whose water allayed\r\n     their thirst, would first be denominated by the words _cave_,\r\n     _tree_, _fountain_, or by whatever other appellations they might\r\n     think proper, in that primitive jargon, to mark them. Afterward,\r\n     when the more enlarged experience of these savages had led them to\r\n     observe, and their necessary occasions obliged them to make mention\r\n     of, other caves, and other trees, and other fountains, they would\r\n     naturally bestow upon each of those new objects the same name by\r\n     which they had been accustomed to express the similar object they\r\n     were first acquainted with.''\r\n\r\nThis view of the primitive formation of thought and language, is\r\ndiametrically opposed to the theory held by Leibnitz, who maintained\r\nthat 'general terms are necessary for the essential constitution of\r\nlanguages.' 'Children,' he says, 'and those who know but little of the\r\nlanguage which they attempt to speak, or little of the subject on which\r\nthey would employ it, make use of general terms, as _thing_, _plant_,\r\n_animal_, instead of using proper names, of which they are destitute.\r\nAnd it is certain that all proper or individual names have been\r\noriginally appellative or general.'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the contradictory and seemingly antagonistic nature of\r\nthese positions, Professor Mueller shows that they are not\r\nirreconcilable.\r\n\r\n     'Adam Smith is no doubt right, when he says that the first\r\n     individual cave which is called cave, gave the name to all other\r\n     caves; ... and the history of almost every substantive might be\r\n     cited in support of his view. But Leibnitz is equally right when,\r\n     in looking beyond the first emergence of such names as cave, town,\r\n     or palace, he asks how such names could have arisen. Let us take\r\n     the Latin names of cave. A cave in Latin is called _antrum_,\r\n     _cavea_, _spelunca_. Now _antrum_ means really the same as\r\n     _internum_. Antar, in Sanskrit means _between_ or _within_.\r\n     _Antrum_, therefore, meant originally what is within or inside the\r\n     earth or anything else. It is clear, therefore, that such a name\r\n     could not have been given to any individual cave, unless the\r\n     general idea of being within, or inwardness, had been present in\r\n     the mind. This general idea once formed, and once expressed by the\r\n     pronominal root _an_ or _antar_, the process of naming is clear and\r\n     intelligible. The place where the savage could live safe from rain\r\n     and from the sudden attacks of wild beasts, a natural hollow in the\r\n     rock, he would call his _within_, his _antrum_; and afterward\r\n     similar places, whether dug in the earth or cut in a tree, would be\r\n     designated by the same name ... Let us take another word for cave,\r\n     which is _cavea_ or _caverna_. Here again Adam Smith would be\r\n     perfectly right in maintaining that this name, when first given,\r\n     was applied to one particular cave, and was afterward extended to\r\n     other caves. But Leibnitz would be equally right in maintaining\r\n     that in order to call even the first hollow _cavea_, it was\r\n     necessary that the general idea of hollow should have been formed\r\n     in the mind, and should have received its vocal expression _cav_\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n     _'The first thing really known is the general. It is through it\r\n     that we know and name afterward individual objects of which any\r\n     general idea can be predicated, and it is only in the third stage\r\n     that these individual objects, thus known and named, become again\r\n     the representatives of whole classes, and their names or proper\r\n     names are raised into appellatives.'_\r\n\r\nThe italics in the last paragraph are my own.\r\n\r\nBut the name of a thing, runs the argument, meant originally that by\r\nwhich we know a thing. And how do we know things? Knowing is more than\r\nperceiving by our senses, which convey to us information about single\r\nthings only. 'To _know_ is more than to feel, than to perceive, more\r\nthan to remember, more than to compare. We know a thing if we are able\r\nto bring it, and [or?] any part of it, under more general ideas.' The\r\nfacts of nature are perceived by our senses; the thoughts of nature, to\r\nborrow an expression of Oersted's, can be conceived by our reason only.\r\nThe first step toward this real knowledge is the '_naming of a thing_,\r\nor the making a thing knowable;' and it is this step which separates man\r\nforever from all other animals. For all naming is classification,\r\nbringing the individual under the general; and whatever we know, whether\r\nempirically or scientifically, we know it only by means of our general\r\nideas. Other animals have sensation, perception, memory, and, in a\r\ncertain sense, intellect; but all these, in the animal, are conversant\r\nwith single objects only. Man has, in addition to these, reason, and it\r\nis his reason only that is conversant with general ideas.\r\n\r\n     'At the very point where man parts company with the brute world, at\r\n     the first flash of reason as the manifestation of the light within\r\n     us, there we see the true genius of language. Analyze any word you\r\n     like, and you will find that it expressed a general idea peculiar\r\n     to the individual to which the name belongs. What is the meaning of\r\n     moon?--the measurer. What is the meaning of sun?--the begetter ...\r\n\r\n     'If the serpent is called in Sanskrit _sarpa_, it is because it was\r\n     conceived under the general idea of creeping, an idea expressed by\r\n     the word _srip_. But the serpent was also called _ahi_ in Sanskrit,\r\n     in Greek _echis_ or _echidna_, in Latin _anguis_. This name is\r\n     derived from quite a different root and idea. The root is _ah_ in\r\n     Sanskrit, or _anh_, which means to press together, to choke, to\r\n     throttle. Here the distinguishing mark from which the serpent was\r\n     named was his throttling, and _ahi_ meant serpent, as expressing\r\n     the general idea of throttler. It is a curious root this _anh_, and\r\n     it still lives in several modern words. In Latin it appears as\r\n     _ango_, _anxi_, _anctum_, to strangle, in _angina_, quinsy, in\r\n     _angor_, suffocation. But _angor_ meant not only quinsy or\r\n     compression of the neck; it assumed a moral import, and signifies\r\n     anguish or anxiety. The two adjectives _angustus_, narrow, and\r\n     _anxius_, uneasy, both come from the same source. In Greek the root\r\n     retained its natural and material meaning; in _eggys_, near, and\r\n     _echis_, serpent, throttler. But in Sanskrit it was chosen with\r\n     great truth as the proper name for sin. Evil no doubt presented\r\n     itself under various aspects to the human mind, and its names are\r\n     many; but none so expressive as those derived from our root _anh_,\r\n     to throttle. _Anhas_ in Sanskrit means sin, but it does so only\r\n     because it meant originally throttling--the consciousness of sin\r\n     being like the grasp of the assassin on the throat of his victim\r\n     ... This _anhas_ is the same word as the Greek _agos_, sin ... The\r\n     English _anguish_ is from the French _angoisse_, the Italian\r\n     _angoscia_, a corruption of the Latin _angustiae_, a strait ... _Ma_\r\n     in Sanskrit means to measure, from which we had the name of the\r\n     moon. _Man_, a derivative root, means to think. From this we have\r\n     the Sanskrit _manu_, originally thinker, then man. In the later\r\n     Sanskrit we find derivatives, such as _manava_, _manusha_,\r\n     _manushya_, all expressing man. In Gothic we find both _man_ and\r\n     _mannisks_, the modern German _mann_ and _mensch_.'\r\n\r\nAnd now we are brought by the author of _The Science of Language_ to the\r\ngreat question to which the foregoing is merely preparatory, to the\r\nfundamental consideration of Philological research: 'How can sound\r\nexpress thought? How did roots become the signs of general ideas? How\r\nwas the abstract idea of measuring expressed by _ma_, the idea of\r\nthinking by _man_? How did _ga_ come to mean going, _stha_ standing,\r\n_sad_ sitting, _da_ giving, _mar_ dying, _char_ walking, _kar_ doing?'\r\nHere is his answer:\r\n\r\n     'The four or five hundred roots which remain as the constituent\r\n     elements in different families of languages are not interjections,\r\n     nor are they imitations. They are _phonetic types_, produced by a\r\n     power inherent in nature. They exist, as Plato would say, by\r\n     nature; though with Plato we should add that, when we say by\r\n     nature, we mean by the hand of God. There is a law which runs\r\n     through nearly the whole of nature, that everything which is struck\r\n     rings. Each substance has its peculiar ring. We can tell the more\r\n     or less perfect structure of metals by their vibrations, by the\r\n     answer which they give. Gold rings differently from tin, wood rings\r\n     differently from stone; and different sounds are produced according\r\n     to the nature of each percussion. It was the same with man, the\r\n     most highly organized of nature's works. Man, in his primitive and\r\n     perfect state, was not only endowed, like the brute, with the power\r\n     of expressing his sensations by interjections, and his perceptions\r\n     by onomatopoieia. He possessed likewise the faculty of giving more\r\n     articulate expression to the rational conceptions of his mind. That\r\n     faculty was not of his own making. It was an instinct, an instinct\r\n     of the mind as irresistible as any other instinct. So far as\r\n     language is the production of that instinct, it belongs to the\r\n     realm of nature. Man loses his instincts as he ceases to want them.\r\n     His senses become fainter when, as in the case of scent, they\r\n     become useless. Thus the creative faculty which gave to each\r\n     conception, as it thrilled for the first time through the brain, a\r\n     phonetic expression, became extinct when its object was fulfilled.\r\n     The number of these _phonetic types_ must have been almost infinite\r\n     in the beginning, and it was only through the same process of\r\n     _natural elimination_ which we observed in the early history of\r\n     words, that clusters of roots, more or less synonymous, were\r\n     gradually reduced to one definite type.'\r\n\r\nProfessor Max Mueller occupies a commanding position in the foremost rank\r\nof the students of Philology. His work on _The Science of Language_,\r\nfrom which the preceding discussion of the Origin of Speech is taken,\r\nis, so far as I am aware, the latest volume treating of the problem in\r\nquestion which has issued from what is commonly regarded as high\r\nauthority in the department of Language. It is to that volume,\r\ntherefore, that we are to look for the last word of elucidation which\r\nthe Comparative Philologist can furnish respecting it. And it is for\r\nthis reason--in order that we might have before us the results of the\r\nlatest research of the schools--that the exposition of the Origin of\r\nLanguage given in the work referred to has been so fully stated.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, does this explanation of the problem leave us? Does it go\r\nto the bottom of the matter? Is it sufficiently distinct and\r\nsatisfactory? In brief, does it give us any clear understanding of the\r\nOrigin of Speech? Does it not rather leave us at the crucial point of\r\nthe whole inquiry, with the essence and core of the subject untouched\r\nand shrouded in mystery? Some indefinite hundreds of roots, obtained, it\r\nis assumed, by means of some indescribable and unknown mental instinct!\r\nThis is the sober and contented answer of Philology to the investigator\r\nwho would know of the Sources of Language, and its constituent elements.\r\nBut of the component parts of these roots--the true and fundamental\r\nconstituent elements of Speech, without a knowledge of which there can\r\nbe no basic and conclusive comprehension of the meaning of roots--and of\r\nthe nature of the method by which these elements become expressive of\r\nthoughts or ideas, there is no word. Language, as it now rests in the\r\nhands of the Comparative Philologists, is in the same state that\r\nChemistry was when Earth, Air, Fire, and Water were supposed to be the\r\nultimate constituent elements of Matter, ere a single real ultimate\r\nelement was known as such. But Chemistry, _as a science_, had no\r\nexistence prior to the discovery of the simple constituents of Physical\r\ncreation. In like manner, a _Science_ of Language must be founded on a\r\nknowledge of the nature and _meaning_ of the simple elements of Speech.\r\nUntil this knowledge is in our possession it is only on the outskirts of\r\nthe subject that we are able to tread. Roots are, it is true, the actual\r\nbases of Language, so far as its concrete, working, or synthetical\r\nstructure is concerned; in the same sense that _compound_ substances are\r\nthe main constituents found in the Universe as it really and naturally\r\nexists. But, although the proportion of simple chemical elements, in the\r\nreal constitution of things, is small, as compared with that of compound\r\nsubstances; yet it is only by our ability to separate compound\r\nsubstances into these elements that we arrive at an understanding of\r\ntheir true character and place in the realm of Matter. So it is only by\r\nour ability to analyze roots--the compound constituents of\r\nLanguage--into the prime elements which have, except rarely, no\r\ndistinctive and individual embodiment in it, that we can hope to gain a\r\nclear comprehension of the nature of Language itself, or of its most\r\nprimitive concrete or composite foundations.\r\n\r\nComparative Philology furnishes us with admirable guidance--so far as it\r\ngoes. But we do not wish to stop at the terminus which it seems to\r\nconsider a satisfactory one. The final answer it offers us, we do not\r\nregard as final. We gladly accept the analysis of Language down to its\r\nRoots. But we wish to analyze Roots also. That the Moon derives its name\r\nfrom being regarded as the _Measurer_ of time; and Man, from the notion\r\nof _thinking_; that an (_anh_) is a widely-diffused root, signifying\r\n_pressure_; and that _ga_ denotes _going_; with similar expositions, is\r\nvaluable information, and takes us a great way toward the goal of our\r\nseeking. But the question of questions relating to Language is not\r\nanswered by it. Why should the abstract idea of measuring be expressed\r\nby _ma_; and that of thinking by _man_? How did _an_ come to signify\r\npressure; and _ga_, going? Is there any special relationship between\r\nthese roots and the ideas which they respectively indicate? Or was it by\r\nchance merely that they were adopted in connection with each other?\r\nMight _da_ just as meet have been taken to denote doing, and _kar_,\r\ngiving, as _vice versa_? Has the root _an_ any distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics peculiarly fitting it to suggest _choking_ or\r\n_pressure_? Or might that notion have been equally well expressed by\r\n_stha_?\r\n\r\nIt is at this fundamental stage of the investigation, whence a true\r\n_Science_ of Language must take its departure, that the labors and\r\ndisclosures of Comparative Philology cease; leaving the problem of the\r\nOrigin of Language involved in the same state of unintelligibility with\r\nwhich it has always been surrounded. It is just at this point, however,\r\nthat the SCIENTIFIC UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE previously noticed begins its\r\ndevelopments. By means of its assistance we may hope, therefore, to\r\narrive at a satisfactory solution of the problem in question, and,\r\nthrough this solution, at a clear understanding of the more specific\r\nobjects of our present inquiry. Before approaching this main object--the\r\nexposition of the general character of the NEW SCIENTIFIC UNIVERSAL\r\nLANGUAGE and its relations to existing Tongues--and still in aid of that\r\npurpose, I must offer some further comments upon the excerpts already\r\nmade from 'The Science of Language;' and upon a few other points which\r\nremain to be extracted from that work.\r\n\r\nOf the four or five hundred roots which remain, the insoluble residuum\r\n(so thought by Professor Mueller) of Language, after eliminating the\r\nimmense mass of variable and soluble material, he says: 1. That 'they\r\nare _phonetic types_ produced by a power inherent in human nature;' 2.\r\n'Man, in his primitive and perfect state, was not only endowed like the\r\nbrute with the power of expressing his sensations by interjections, and\r\nhis perceptions by onomatopoieia [mere imitation of sound]. He possessed\r\n_likewise_ the power of giving _more articulate_ expression to the\r\n_rational conceptions of his mind_.' The italics here are, again, my\r\nown, introduced for more emphasis and more ready reference to the\r\ncentral thought of the writer. 3. 'That faculty was not of his own\r\nmaking. It was an instinct, an instinct of the mind, as irresistible as\r\nany other instinct. So far as language is the production of that\r\ninstinct, it belongs to the realm of nature. Man loses his instincts as\r\nhe ceases to want them. His senses become fainter when, as in the case\r\nof scent, they become useless. Thus the creative faculty which gave to\r\neach conception, as it thrilled for the first time through the brain, a\r\nphonetic expression, became extinct when its object was fulfilled.' 4.\r\n'The number of these _phonetic types_ [root-syllables] must have been\r\nalmost infinite in the beginning, and it was only through the same\r\nprocess of _natural elimination_ which we observed in the early history\r\nof words, that clusters of roots more or less synonymous, were gradually\r\nreduced to one definite type.'\r\n\r\nProfessor Mueller, in stopping with root-syllables (to the number of four\r\nor five hundred), as the _least_ or ultimate elements to which Language\r\ncan be reduced, has, naturally enough, and along with all Comparative\r\nPhilologists hitherto, committed the error of _insufficient analysis_;\r\nan error of precisely the same kind which the founders of Syllabic\r\nAlphabets have committed, as compared with the work of Cadmus, or any\r\nfounder of a veritable alphabet. The true and radical analysis carries\r\nus back in both cases to the _Primitive Individual Sounds_, the Vowels\r\nand Consonants of which Language is composed.\r\n\r\nIt is clear enough that the analysis must be carried to the very\r\nultimate in order to reach the true foundation for an effective and\r\nsufficient alphabetic _Representation_ of Language. Precisely the same\r\nnecessity is upon us in order that we may lay a secure and adequate\r\nfoundation for a _True Science of Language_. This will explain more\r\nfully what was meant in a preceding paragraph, when it was stated that\r\nthe labors of Mr. Andrews begin, in this department of Language, just\r\nwhere the labors of the whole school of Comparative Philologists have\r\nended. He first completes the analysis of Language, by going down and\r\nback to the Phonetic _Elements_, the ulterior roots, the Vowels and\r\nConsonants of Language. Then by putting Nature to the crucial test, so\r\nto speak, to compel her to disclose the hidden meaning with which each\r\nof these absolute (ultimate) Elements of Speech is inherently laden, he\r\ndiscovers--what might readily be an _a priori_ conception--that these\r\n_Elements_, and not any compound root-syllables whatsoever, are the true\r\n'_Phonetic Types_,' representative in Nature of '_the Rational\r\nConceptions_ of the human mind.'\r\n\r\nThe ultimate Rational Conceptions of the Human Mind are confessedly,\r\namong all Philosophers of the Mind, not four or five hundred, but like\r\nthe Alphabetic Sounds of Language, a mere handful in number. Precisely\r\nhow many they are and how they are best distributed has not been agreed\r\nupon. Aristotle classed them as _Ten_. Kant tells us there are _Twelve_\r\nonly of the Categories of the Understanding. Spencer, while finding the\r\nUltimate of Ultimates in the idea of _Force_ alone, admits its immediate\r\nexpansion into this handful of Primitive Conceptions, but without\r\nattempting their inventory or classification. The discoverer of\r\nUNIVERSOLOGY, first settling and establishing the fact that the Elements\r\nof Sound in Speech are the natural Phonetic Types, equal in number to\r\nthe inventory of the Primitive Rational Conceptions of the Human Mind,\r\nis then enabled to work the new discovery backward, and, by the aid of\r\nthe classifications which Nature herself has clearly introduced among\r\nthese Sounds (into Vowels, Consonants, Liquids, etc.), to arrive at a\r\nclassification of all the Primitive Rational Conceptions, which cannot\r\nfail to be completely satisfactory and final. The same discovery leads,\r\ntherefore, to the reconstruction of the Science of Language, on the one\r\nhand, and of Ontology, the Science of the highest Metaphysical domain,\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nBut, again, it is one of the demonstrations of UNIVERSOLOGY that all\r\ncareers, that of the development of the Human Mind among others, pass\r\nthrough three Successive Stages correspondential with each other in the\r\ndifferent domains of Being. As respects the Mind, these are: 1.\r\n_Intuitional_ (or Instinctive); 2. _Intellectual_ (or Reflective); and\r\n3. _Composite_ (or Integral). It is another of these demonstrations that\r\nthe Intuitional (_Unismal_) development of Mind, and the Intellectual\r\n(_Duismal_), proceed in opposite courses or directions; so that the\r\nhighest _Intellectual_ development reaches and investigates _in its own\r\nway_ just those questions with which the _Intuitional_ development\r\n('Instinct,' as Professor Mueller denominates it) began; and which, in\r\nthe very earliest times, it disposed of in _its_ appropriate way _as if_\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\nBy this means, the road having been passed over completely in both\r\ndirections, the way is prepared for the inauguration of the third or\r\nIntegral Stage, which consists in putting the road intelligently to all\r\nits possible uses.\r\n\r\nTo apply these statements to the instance before us, for the elucidation\r\nboth of the statements themselves and of the matter to be expounded; it\r\nis the _test labor_ of the highest _Intellectual_ development to come\r\nback upon precisely those recondite points of knowledge which the\r\nnascent _Intuition_ of the race felt or 'smelt' out blindly; and, by the\r\nsight of the Mind's eye, to arrive more lucidly at the understanding of\r\nthe same subject. Not that the nature of the Understanding by any two\r\nsenses or faculties is ever the same; but that each has _its own method_\r\nof cognizing the same general field of investigation. It is the\r\n_re-investigation_, _intellectually_, of the Relationship of the (true,\r\nnot the pseudo) _Phonetic Types_ with the Fundamental Rational\r\nConceptions of the Human Mind, which is the first step taken by Mr.\r\nAndrews, in laying the basis for the new and coming stage of the\r\ndevelopment of the Science of Language.\r\n\r\nIt is the completion of this Intellectually Analytical process which\r\noffers the _point of incipency_ for the new and immense Lingual\r\nStructure of the future, and the ultimate virtual unification of Human\r\nSpeech. It may be quite true, as Professor Mueller affirms, that the\r\nInstinctual Development of Language--by which _we_ mean the whole\r\nLingual History of the Past, with the exception of our present very\r\nimperfect Scientific nomenclatures--has never proved adequate to the\r\nintroduction of a single new _root_, since the 'Instinct' exhausted\r\nitself, as he says, in the nascent effort. But it is a pure assumption,\r\nwhen he supposes, for that reason, that the informed Human Intellect of\r\nthe Future will not be competent to constitute thousands of them. It is\r\njust as legitimate as would have been the assumption in the infancy of\r\nChemistry, that because Nature never _synthetized_ in _her_ laboratory\r\nmore than a few simple salts, the modern chemist would never be able to\r\nproduce any one of the two thousand salts now known to him. This kind of\r\nassumption is the common error of the expounders of existing science, as\r\ncontrasted with the bolder originality of discoverers.\r\n\r\nBut, again, though it is true that the _Intuitional_ (or Instinctual)\r\nfaculty of man has, in a manner, declined, as in the case of the sense\r\nof Smell, while the _Intellect_ (the Analogue of the Eye) has been\r\ndeveloped, still it is assuming too much to say that it utterly fails us\r\neven yet. It remains, like the sense of Smell, an important helper even\r\nin our present investigations. Professor Mueller should not, because he\r\nmay happen to have a cold, affirm that nobody smells anything any more.\r\nTo explain what I mean in this respect, the following extract may serve\r\nas a text:\r\n\r\n     'It is curious to observe how apt we are to deceive ourselves when\r\n     we once adopt this system of Onomatopoieia. Who does not imagine\r\n     that he hears in the word 'thunder' an imitation of the rolling and\r\n     rumbling noise which the old Germans ascribed to their god Thor\r\n     playing at nine-pins? Yet _thunder_ is clearly the same word as the\r\n     Latin _tonitru_. The root is _tan_, to stretch. From this root\r\n     _tan_ we have in Greek _tonos_, our tone, _tone_ being produced by\r\n     the stretching and vibrating of cords. In Sanskrit the sound\r\n     thunder is expressed by the same root _tan_; but in the derivatives\r\n     _tanyu_, _tanyatu_, and _tanayitnu_, thundering, we perceive no\r\n     trace of the rumbling noise which we imagined we perceived in the\r\n     Latin _tonitru_ and the English _thunder_. The very same root\r\n     _tan_, to stretch, yields some derivatives which are anything but\r\n     rough and noisy. The English _tender_, the French _tendre_, the\r\n     Latin _tener_ are derived from it. Like _tenuis_, the Sanskrit\r\n     _tanu_, the English _thin_, _tener_ meant originally what was\r\n     extended over a larger surface, then _thin_, then _delicate_. The\r\n     relationship betwixt _tender_, _thin_, and _thunder_ would be hard\r\n     to establish if the original conception of thunder had really been\r\n     its rumbling noise.\r\n\r\n     'Who does not imagine that he hears something sweet in the French\r\n     _sucre_, _sucre_? Yet sugar came from India, and it is there called\r\n     _'sarkhara_, which is anything but sweet sounding. This _'sarkhara_\r\n     is the same word as _sugar_; it was called in Latin _saccharum_,\r\n     and we still speak of _saccharine_ juice, which is sugar juice.'\r\n\r\nIt may appear, on a closer inspection at this point, that it is\r\nProfessor Mueller who is deceived, and not the common verdict, both in\r\nrespect to the question whether such words as _thunder_, _sucre_, etc.,\r\nreally do or do not have some inherent and organic relation in the Human\r\nMind to the ideas of rumbling noise and sweetness respectively; and in\r\nrespect to the value and significance of the fact. He has, it would\r\nseem, confounded two separate and distinct questions. 1st. Is there such\r\na relation between the sound and the sense? and 2d. Were these words\r\nintroduced into speech because of that resemblance?\r\n\r\nIn respect to the latter of these questions, Professor Mueller's answer,\r\nso far as the word _thunder_ is concerned, is rather in favor of an\r\naffirmative answer than against it. So far from its being 'hard to\r\nestablish the relationship betwixt _tender_, _thin_, and _thunder_,' on\r\nthe hypothesis that 'the original conception of thunder had really been\r\nits rumbling noise; 'it is just as easy to establish this relationship\r\nas it is to show the connection between the root _tan_, to stretch, and\r\nits derivatives _tonos_, _tone_, _tendre_, _tener_, _thin_, and\r\n_delicate_;--an undertaking which Professor Mueller finds no difficulty\r\nwhatever in accomplishing.\r\n\r\nThe idea of _stretching_ signified by the original root _tan_ has no\r\n_direct_ or _immediate_ connection with any of the conceptions expressed\r\nby the derivative words. But by stretching an object it is diminished in\r\n_breadth_ and _depth_, while it increases in _length_; hence it becomes\r\n_thinner_; so that the Mind readily makes the transition from the\r\nprimitive conception of _stretch_ to that of _thinness_, indicated by\r\nthe English word, and by the Sanskrit _tanu_, and the Latin _tener_,\r\n_tenuis_. _Thinness_, again, is allied to _slimness_, _slenderness_,\r\n_fineness_, etc.; ideas which are involved in the conception of\r\n_delicate_, and furnish an easy transition to it.\r\n\r\nBut it is also from the notion of _stretching_, though in a still less\r\ndirect manner, that we gain an idea of sound as conveyed by musical\r\ntones; '_tone_,' as Professor Mueller remarks, 'being produced by the\r\n_stretching_ and vibrating of cords.' Still further: if we cause a heavy\r\npiece of cord to vibrate, or, what is better, the bass string of a\r\nviolin or guitar, or strike a very low key on the piano, and pronounce\r\nthe word _tone_ in a full voice at the same time, the remarkable\r\nsimilarity of the two sounds thus produced will be clearly apparent.\r\nThus the root _tan_, to stretch, becomes also expressive of the idea of\r\n_sound_ as seen in the words _tonos_, _tone_, _tonitru_, _thunder_, etc.\r\nBut what is especially to be noticed is this: that in those derivatives\r\nof _tan_, to stretch, which are _not_ indicative of ideas of sound (as\r\n_tenuis_, thin, etc.), the sounds of the words do _not_ cause us to\r\nimagine that we hear the imitation of noise; while in those derivatives\r\nwhich _are_ expressive of it, we not only imagine that we _do_ hear it,\r\nbut, in the case of _tonos_ and _tone_ at least, have an instance in\r\nwhich we _know_ that the word employed to convey the idea is a\r\nproximately perfect representation of the sound out of which the idea\r\narose. Even in _tanyu_, _tanyatu_, _tanayitnu_, thundering, in which\r\nProfessor Mueller affirms that 'we perceive no trace of the rumbling\r\nnoise which we imagined we perceived in the Latin _tonitru_ and the\r\nEnglish _thunder_'--although he seems to admit that it is perceptible in\r\nthe Sanskrit word for thunder expressed by the same root _tan_--the\r\nreason why we cannot trace it may be because of the terminations, which,\r\nas it were, absorb the sound that is there, although less obviously, in\r\nthe _tan_, or shade it off so that it becomes diluted and hardly\r\ntraceable.\r\n\r\nVowel Sounds are so fluctuating and evanescent that they go for\r\ncomparatively little in questions of Etymology. _Tan_ is equivalent to\r\nT--n; the place of the dash being filled by any vowel. _T_ is readily\r\nreplaced by _th_ or _d_, and _n_ by _ng_; as is known to every\r\nPhilological student. The object, which in English we call _tin_, and\r\nits name, are peculiar and important in this connection, as combining\r\nthe two ideas in question: 1st, that of outstretched surface or\r\n_thinness_; and, 2d, that of a persistent tendency to give forth just\r\nthat species of sound which we call, by a slight shade of difference in\r\nthe form of the word, a _din_. The Latin _tintinnabulum_, a little bell,\r\nand the English _tinkle_, the sound made by a little bell, are among the\r\nwords which are readily recognized as having a natural relation to a\r\ncertain trivial variety of sound. The English _ding-dong_ and\r\n_ding-dong-bell_ are well-known imitations of sound; and are, at the\r\nsame time, etymologically, mere modifications of the root under\r\nconsideration. As _tone_ and _strain_ or _stretch_ are related in idea,\r\nas seen in the case of musical notes or tones, is it not as probable\r\nthat the original root-word of which _tan_, _ton_, _thun_, _tin_, _din_,\r\n_ding_, _dong_, etc., are mere variations, took its rise from the\r\nimitation of sound, as it is that the fact of _strain_ or _stretch_ was\r\nthe first to be observed and to obtain the name from which, afterward\r\nand accidentally, so to speak, were derived words which confessedly\r\nhave a relation in their own sound to other and external sounds, as in\r\nthe case of thunder, musical tone, the sheet of tin, and the bell? Is it\r\nnot, in fact, more probable?\r\n\r\nIn respect to the question whether _sucre_ and _sucre_ were introduced\r\ninto Language because of their resemblance to the idea of sweetness,\r\nProfessor Mueller gives a valid negative answer. He shows that the word\r\nis derived from the Sanskrit _'sarkhara_, 'which,' as he says, 'is\r\nanything but sweet sounding.'\r\n\r\nThe question whether the words under consideration (_sucre_, _sucre_)\r\nare really sweet-sounding words, Professor Mueller decides by implication\r\nin the affirmative, and, perhaps, quite unconsciously, by the very act\r\nof contrasting them with another word which, as he affirms, is not at\r\nall sweet sounding.\r\n\r\nBut this is by far the more important point than that of the mere\r\nhistorical genesis of the word; and a point which really touches vitally\r\nthe whole question of the nature and Origin of Language.\r\n\r\nHow should any word be either _sweet-sounding_ or _not sweet-sounding_?\r\nSound is a something which has no _taste_, and sweetness is a something\r\nwhich makes no _noise_. Now the very gist and crux of this whole\r\nquestion of Language consists in confounding or not confounding a case\r\nlike this with _mere_ Onomatopoieia, or the direct and simple imitation\r\nof one sound by another. All that Professor Mueller says against the\r\nOrigin of Language in this 'bow-wow' way is exceedingly well said; and\r\nit is important that it should be said. But unconsciously he is now\r\nconfounding with the Bow-wow, something else and totally different; and\r\nsomething which is just as vital and profound in regard to the whole\r\nquestion of the origin and true basis of the reconstruction of Language,\r\nas the thing with which he confounds it is trivial and superficial.\r\n\r\nThe point is so important that I beg the reader's best attention to it,\r\nin order that he may become fully seized of the idea.\r\n\r\nI can imitate very closely the buzz of a bee, by forcing the breath\r\nthrough my nearly-touching teeth. A mimic can imitate the natural sounds\r\nof many animals, and other sounds heard in Nature. This _mere imitation_\r\nis what Lingual Scholars have dignified by the high-sounding and rather\r\nrepulsive technicality, _Onomatopoieia_. In the early and simple period\r\nof Lingual Science much has been made, in striving to account for the\r\nOrigin of Language, of this faculty of imitation, and of the fact that\r\nthere are undoubtedly certain words in every language consisting of such\r\nimitations. It is against this simple and superficial theory that\r\nProfessor Mueller has argued so well. But in these words _sucre_,\r\n_sucre_, incautiously included by him as instances of the same thing, we\r\nare in the presence of a very different problem. To imitate one sound by\r\nanother sound is a mere simple, external, and trivial imitation;\r\nonomatopoieia, and nothing more than that. But to imitate a _sound_, by\r\na _taste_, or to recognize that such an imitation has occurred, is a\r\ntestimony to the existence of that recondite and all-important _echo of\r\nlikeness_ through domains of Being themselves the most unlike, which we\r\ncall ANALOGY.\r\n\r\nThat we do recognize such _analogy_ or _correspondence of meaning_, that\r\nProfessor Mueller himself does so, is admitted when he tells us that\r\nanother form of the words in question is 'not at all sweet-sounding.' It\r\nis not in this perception, therefore, that we deceive ourselves, but\r\nonly in supposing that these particular words came to mean sugar,\r\n_because_ they were sweet-sounding. That there is this perception of the\r\nanalogy in question is again confessed by the fact that we have the same\r\nfeeling in respect to the German _suesse_, sweet; while the English words\r\n_sugar_ and _sweet_, notwithstanding any greater familiarity of\r\nassociation, do not convey the same ideas in the same marked degree.\r\nThe words _mellifluous_ (honey-flowing) and _melody_ (honey-sound) are\r\nthemselves standing witnesses in behalf of the existence of the same\r\nperception. The fact that we instinctually speak of a _sweet_ voice, is\r\nanother witness.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there is an echo of likeness (real analogy) between these two\r\nunlike spheres of Thought and Being, _Sound_ and _Taste_, may there not\r\nbe precisely a similar echo through other and all spheres; so that there\r\nshall be a Something in Number, in Form, in Chemical Constitution, in\r\nthe Properties of Mind, in Ultimate Rational Conceptions, in fine, that\r\nechoes to this idea, which, by a stretch of the powers of Language, we\r\ncall _sweet_, both in respect to Sound and Taste? May it not have been\r\nprecisely this Something and the other handful of primitive Somethings,\r\neach with its multitudinous echoes, that the _Nascent Intuition_ of the\r\nrace laid hold of and availed itself of _irreflectively_ for laying the\r\nfoundations of Speech? Again, may it not happen that the _Reflective\r\nIntellect_ should in turn discover _intelligently_ (or _reflectively_)\r\njust that _underlying_ system of Analogy which the primitive Instinct\r\nwas competent to appreciate unintelligently; and, by the greater\r\nclearness of this intelligent perception, be able to elevate the Science\r\nof Language, and found it upon a new and constructive, instead of upon\r\nthis merely instinctual plane? To all these questions the\r\nUniversologists return an affirmative answer. They go farther, and aver\r\nthat this great intellectual undertaking is now fully achieved, and is\r\nonly awaiting the opportunity for elaborate demonstration and\r\npromulgation.\r\n\r\nA word further on this subject. To pronounce the words _sucre_, _sucre_,\r\n_suesse_, the lips are necessarily pinched or perked up, in a certain\r\nexquisite way, as if we were sucking something very gratifying to the\r\ntaste. This consideration carries us over to the further analogy with\r\n_shapes_ or _forms_, and, hence, with the Organic or Mechanical\r\nproduction of sounds; another grand element, the main one, in fact, of\r\nthe whole investigation.\r\n\r\nAmong the infinite contingencies of the origin and successive\r\nmodifications of words, it is very possible that the word _'sarkhara_,\r\nalthough meaning sugar in a particular tongue, may not have primarily\r\nrelated to its property of sweetness; and that, therefore, its phonetic\r\nform should not be accordant with that property. It may have meant the\r\n_cane-plant_, for instance, before its sweetness was known. Then it is\r\npossible that a derivative and modified form of the same word should\r\nhappen to drift into that precise phonetic; form which is accordant with\r\nthat property. But the marvel, and the point of importance is, that so\r\nsoon as this happens, the 'instinct' of the race, even that of Professor\r\nMueller himself, remains good enough to recognize the fact. 'Who does not\r\nimagine,' he says, 'that he hears something sweet in the French _sucre_,\r\n_sucre_?' But why do we all imagine that we hear what does not exist?\r\nThe uniformity of the imagination proves it to be a _real_ perception.\r\nIf the universal consciousness of mankind be not valid evidence, where\r\nshall we hope to find it?\r\n\r\nThe consideration of Analogy as existing between the Ultimate Elements\r\nof Sound and Ultimate Rational Conceptions will be the subject of the\r\nnext paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWER ODORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a sheltered nook in a certain garden, where, on a sunny spring\r\nmorning, the passer-by inhales with startled pleasure the very soul of\r\nthe 'sweet south,' and, stooping down, far in among brown and crackling\r\nleaves, lo the blue hoods of English violets! The fragrance of the\r\nviolet! What flower scent is like it? Does not the subtle\r\nsweetness--half caught, half lost upon the wind--at times sweep over one\r\na vague and thrilling tenderness, an exquisite emotion, partly grief and\r\npartly mild delight?\r\n\r\nThe violet is the poet's darling, perhaps because its frail breath seems\r\nto waft from out the delicate blue petals the rare imaginings native to\r\na poet's soul.\r\n\r\nMay it not be that thus, in the eloquence of perfume, it is but\r\nrendering to him who can best respond thereto, a revelation of its inner\r\nessences?--showing, to him who can comprehend the sign, a reason why it\r\ngrows.\r\n\r\nIs this too fanciful? Certainly the violet was not made in vain--and in\r\nthe Eternal Correspondence known to higher intelligences than our own,\r\nthere surely must exist a grand and beautiful Flower lore, wherein each\r\nblossom has an individual word to speak, a lesson to unfold, by form and\r\ncoloring, and, more than all, by exhaled fragrance.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there is a mystery here too deep for us in this gross world to\r\nwholly understand; but can we not search after knowledge? Would we not\r\nlike to grasp an enjoyment less merely of the senses from the geranium's\r\nbalm and the mayflower's spice?\r\n\r\nAnd notice here how strongly association binds us by the sense of\r\nsmell--the sense so closely connected with the brain that, through its\r\ninstrumentality, the mind, it is said, is quickest reached, is soonest\r\nmoved. So that when perfumes quiver through us, are we oftenest\r\nconstrained to blush and smile, or shrink and shiver. Perhaps through\r\nperfumes also memory knocks the loudest on our heart-doors; until it has\r\ncome to pass that unto scented handkerchief or withering leaf has been\r\ngiven full power to fire the eye or blanch the cheek; while from secret\r\ndrawers one starts appalled at flower breaths, stifling, shut up long\r\nago. The sprays themselves might drop unheeded down--dead with the young\r\nhopes that laid them there--but the old-time emotion wraps one yet in\r\nthat undying--ah, how sickening! fragrance.\r\n\r\nSo in the very nature of the task proposed is couched assistance, since\r\nthus to the breath of the flowers does association lend its own\r\ninterpretation, driving deep the sharpest stings or dropping down the\r\nrichest consolation through the most humble plants. But is this the end\r\nof the matter? Is there not, apart from all that our personal interest\r\nmay discover, in each flower an unchanging address all its own--an\r\nunvaried salutation proffered ever to the world at large? Why is a\r\npassion wafted through a nosegay? What purifies the air around a lily?\r\nAnd why are bridal robes rich with orange blooms?\r\n\r\nSurely poetry and tradition have but here divined certain truths,\r\nomnipotent behind a veil, and recognized their symbols in these chosen\r\nblossoms?\r\n\r\nBut if the flowers are truly types, how should they be interpreted?\r\n\r\nThere are hints laid in their very structure and outer semblance, hints\r\nafforded also by art and romance from time immemorial; and all these,\r\nsuggestions of the hidden wisdom, must be gathered patiently and wrought\r\nout to a fuller clearness, through careful attention to the intuitions\r\nof one's own awakened imagination.\r\n\r\nBut what expression can be found for the _soul_ of a flower--for the\r\nevanescent odor that floats upon us only with the dimmest mists of\r\nmeaning?\r\n\r\nIn a novel of a few years since, a people dwelling in Mid Africa are\r\ndescribed as skilled in the acts of a singular civilization, and\r\nespecial mention is made of an instrument analogous to an organ, but\r\nwhich evoked perfumes instead of musical sounds. A curious idea, but\r\npossibly giving the nearest representation to be made of the effect of\r\nodor: by its help, then, by regarding flowers as instruments whose\r\nfragrant utterances might be as well conveyed in music, we may be able\r\nto translate aright the effluence that stirs beyond the reach of speech.\r\n\r\nLet us now try to distinguish, if only for a pleasant pastime, some few\r\nfavorite strains in those wonderful, _unheard_ melodies with which our\r\ngardens ring.\r\n\r\nHear first the roses. The beautiful blush rose, opening fresh and rosy\r\non a dewy June morning, echoes gleefully the birds' 'secret jargoning.'\r\n\r\nThe saffron tea-rose is an exotic of exotics, and the daintiest of fine\r\nladies bears it in her jewelled fingers to the opera, and there imbues\r\nit with the languid ecstasy of an Italian melody. The aroma, floating\r\nround those creamy buds, vibrates to the impassioned agony of artistic\r\nluxury--to the pleasurable pain that dies away in rippling undulations\r\nof the tones.\r\n\r\nBut the red rose is dyed deep with simpler passion. War notes are hers,\r\nbut not trumpet tongued, as they pour from out the fiery cactus. No; it\r\nis as if a woman's heart thrilled through the red rose to sadden the\r\nreveille for country and for God!--an irrepressible undertone of\r\nmourning surging over the anguish that must surely come.\r\n\r\nLove songs belong, too, to the damask rose, but love still set to\r\nmartial chords, wrung, as it were, from heroes' wives, in a rapture of\r\npatriotic sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe white roses are St. Cecilia's, and swell to organ strains; all but\r\nthat whitest rose, so wan and fragile, which haunts old shady gardens,\r\nand never seems to have been there when all things were in their prime,\r\nbut to have blossomed out of the surrounding decay and fading\r\nloveliness. From its bowed head falls drearily upon the ear a low lament\r\nover the departed life it would commemorate.\r\n\r\nWith roses comes the honeysuckle--the real New England one--brimful of\r\nnutmeg; and the sweetbriar, piquant with a _L'Allegro_ strain left by\r\nMilton. Then the laburnum, which, dripping gold, drips honey likewise,\r\nand the locust clusters, and the wistaria, dropping lusciousness.\r\n\r\nThese are all joy-bells evidently, outbursts of the bliss of nature, but\r\nthe garb of the wistaria is more sober than her brilliant sisters, whose\r\nattire is bright and shining.\r\n\r\nThere are flowers that seem set to sacred music. Lilies, white and\r\nsweet, which, from the Lily of the Annunciation to the lily of the\r\nvalley, are hallowed by every reverent fancy; for\r\n\r\n  'In the beauty of the lilies\r\n  Christ was born across the sea.'\r\n\r\nAnd the little white verbena, which recalls, in some mystic way, the old\r\nPuritan tune, 'Naomi,' whose words of calm submission are so closely\r\ninterwoven with one's earliest religious faith.\r\n\r\nBut in contrast to this meek northern saint of a flower, there is a\r\nsouthern flush of oleander bloom, that pours out hymns of mystical\r\ndevotion, overflowing with the exuberant vitality, glowing with the\r\nintense fervor, of the Tropics.\r\n\r\nThere are flowers, also, the burden of whose odorous airs is sensibly of\r\nthis world only, earthy, sensuous. Such are the cape jessamine and the\r\nnarcissus, alike glistening in satin raiment, and alike distilling\r\naromatic essence. Something akin to the waltzes of Strauss, one might\r\nfancy, is the music suited to their mood.\r\n\r\nAnd the night-blooming cercus--that uncanny white witch of a creature,\r\nwith its petals moulded in wax or ivory, its golden-brown\r\nleaf-sheathings, and its unequalled emerald (is it a tint, or is it but\r\na shadow?) far down within the lovely cup, with that overpowering\r\nvoluptuous odor, burdening the atmosphere, permeating the innermost\r\nfibres of sensation, steeping the soul in lethargy! What more fit\r\nexponent can there be for this weird plant's expression than the song of\r\nthe serpent-charmer, the singing which can root the feet unto the ground\r\nand stay the flowing of the impetuous blood?\r\n\r\nBut carnations have a wide-awake aspect, which brings one back to\r\nevery-day life again. Their pleasant pungency is like a bugle note. They\r\nseem glad to start the nerves of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe tulips have taken the sun home to them. Deep down in their hearts\r\nyou smell it, while you listen to a cheery carol welling up from the\r\ncomfort warm within.\r\n\r\nThe pond lilies likewise breathe forth the inspiration of the sun. And\r\nthey chant in their pure home thanksgivings therefore, happy songs of\r\nchaste praise.\r\n\r\nThese are flowers which _look_ their fragrance; but there are those that\r\nstartle by the contrast between their outer being and their inner\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nWhat an intoxicating draught the obscure heliotrope offers! One thinks\r\nof Heloise in the garments of a nun. The arbutus, also, and the dear\r\ndaphne-cups, plain, unnoticeable little things, remind one of the\r\nnightingales, so insignificant in their appearance, so peerless in their\r\ngushes of delicious breath.\r\n\r\nThe demure Quaker is like the peculiar fragrance of the mignonette. It\r\nis hard to believe so many people really like mignonette as profess to\r\ndo so, it has such a caviare-to-the-general odor. The popular taste here\r\nwould seem really guided by a fashion of fastidiousness. But the lemon\r\nverbena--which, if not a flower, is so high-bred an herb that it\r\ndeserves to be considered one--one can easily see why that is valued.\r\nWhat a refined, _spirituelle_ smell it has? Hypatia might have worn it,\r\nor Lady Jane Grey--or better still, Mrs. Browning's Lady Geraldine might\r\nhave plucked it in the pauses of the 'woodland singing' the poet tells\r\nof.\r\n\r\nNature is very liberal in all things; and we have coarse and\r\ndisagreeable flower odors, supplied by peonies, marigolds, the gay\r\nbouvardia, and a still more odious greenhouse flower--a yellowish,\r\ntoadlike thing, which those who have once known will never forget, and\r\nfor which perhaps they can supply a name. If odor be the flower's\r\nexpression of its soul, what rude and evil tenants must dwell within\r\nthose luckless mansions!\r\n\r\nBut if a flower's soul speaks through odor, what of scentless blossoms?\r\nAre they dumb or dead? Some may be too young to speak--as the infantile\r\nanemones, daisies, and innocents.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some are thus most meet for symbols of the dead; the stately,\r\nfrozen calla, which seems a fit trophy, bound with laurel leaves, to lay\r\nupon a soldier's bier; and the snow-cold camelia, whose stony\r\nsculpturing is the very emblem for those white features whence God has\r\ndrained away the life.\r\n\r\nBut, camelias warmed with color, fuchsias, abutilons, the cultivated\r\nazalia (the wild one has a scent), asters, and a host of other loved and\r\nlovely flowers--why are they deprived of language?\r\n\r\nPerhaps they _have_ a fragrance, felt by subtler senses than we mortals\r\nown. But, at least, if they must now appear as mute, we may yet hope\r\nthat in a more spiritual existence we shall behold their very doubles,\r\ngifted with a novel charm, a captivating perfume, we cannot conceive of\r\nhere. For in the vast harmony of the universe one cannot believe there\r\ncan be any floral instruments whose strings are never to be awakened.\r\n\r\nIt _has_ been but the pastime of a half hour that we have given to the\r\nflower odors, when an ever-widening field for speculation lies before\r\nus. But imagination droops exhausted, baffled by the innumerable\r\nenchanting riddles still to solve. And this must now suffice.\r\n\r\nIf it serve to excite any dormant thought in the more ingenious mind of\r\nanother--if it be able to call out the learned conceits of some scholar,\r\nor the delicate symbolisms of some dreamer, it has done its work.\r\n\r\nThe hand that has thus far guided the pen, to dally with a subject all\r\nthe dearer because so generally disregarded, will now gladly yield it to\r\nthe control of a fresher fancy, a truer observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utilitarian spirit of the age is strikingly exhibited in the intense\r\ndesire to diminish the quantity of time necessary to pass from one spot\r\nof the earth's surface to another, and to communicate almost\r\ninstantaneously with a remote distance. The great triumphs of genius,\r\nwithin the last half century, have been accomplished within the domain\r\nof commerce. And in contemplating the progress which has ensued, it is a\r\ncause of humiliation that, as in the case of other great discoveries, so\r\nmany centuries have elapsed, during which the powers of steam, an\r\nelement almost constantly within the observation of man, were, although\r\nperceived, unemployed. But reflection upon the nature of man, and his\r\nslow advancement in the great path of fact and science, will at once\r\nhush the expression of our wondering regret over the past, while a\r\nnobler occupation for the mind offers itself in speculation upon the\r\nfuture. The plank road, the canal, the steamboat, and the railway, are\r\nall the productions of the last few years. At the close of the last\r\ncentury, with the exception of a few military roads inherited from the\r\nRomans, and the roads of the same description constructed by Napoleon,\r\nthe means of communication between distant parts was almost entirely\r\nconfined to inland seas and the larger rivers. It is for this reason\r\nthat the maritime cities and provinces attained such disproportionate\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe invention of _chariots_, and the manner of harnessing horses to draw\r\nthem, is ascribed to Ericthonius of Athens, B.C. 1486. The chariots of\r\nthe ancients were like our _phaetons_, and drawn by one horse. The\r\ninvention of the _chaise_, or calash, is ascribed to Augustus Caesar,\r\nabout A.D. 7. Postchaises were introduced by Trajan about A.D. 100.\r\n_Carriages_ were known in France in the reign of Henry II., A.D. 1547;\r\nthere were but three in Paris in 1550; they were of rude construction.\r\nHenry IV. had one, but it was without straps or springs. A strong\r\ncob-horse (_haquenee_) was let for short journeys; latterly these were\r\nharnessed to a plain vehicle, called _coche-a-haquenee_: hence the name,\r\n_hackney coach_. They were first let for hire in Paris, in 1650, at the\r\nHotel Fiacre. They were known in England in 1555, but not the art of\r\nmaking them. When first manufactured in England, during the reign of\r\nElizabeth, they were called _whirlicotes_. The duke of Buckingham, in\r\n1619, drove six horses, and the duke of Northumberland, in rivalry,\r\ndrove eight. _Cabs_ are also of Parisian origin, where the driver sat in\r\nthe inside; but the aristocratic tastes of the English suggested the\r\npropriety of compelling the driver to be seated outside. _Omnibuses_\r\nalso originated in Paris, and were introduced into London in 1827, by\r\nan enterprising coach proprietor named Shillaber. They were introduced\r\ninto New York, in 1828, by Kipp & Brown. _Horse railroads_ were\r\nintroduced into New York, in 1851, upon the Sixth Avenue.\r\n\r\nIn 1660 there were but six _stage coaches_ in England; two days were\r\noccupied in passing from London to Oxford, fifty-four miles. In 1669, it\r\nwas announced that a vehicle, described as the _flying coach_, would\r\nperform the whole journey between sunrise and sunset. It excited as much\r\ninterest as the opening of a new railway in our time. The Newcastle\r\n_Courant_, of October 11th, 1812, advertises 'that all that desire to\r\npass from Edinborough to London, or from London to Edinborough, or any\r\nplace on that road, let them repair to Mr. John Baillie's, at the Coach\r\nand Horses, at the head of Cannongate, Edinborough, every other\r\nSaturday; or to the Black Swan, in Holborn, every other Monday; at both\r\nof which places they may be received in a stage coach, which performs\r\nthe whole journey in _thirteen days, without any stoppage_ (_if God\r\npermit_), having eighty able horses to perform the whole stage--each\r\npassenger paying L4 10s. for the whole journey. The coach sets out at\r\nsix in the morning.' And it was not until 1825 that a daily line of\r\nstage coaches was established between the two cities, accomplishing the\r\ndistance in forty-six hours. And even so late as 1835 there were only\r\nseven coaches which ran daily.\r\n\r\nIn 1743, Benjamin Franklin, postmaster of Philadelphia, in an\r\nadvertisement, dated April 14th, announces 'that the northern post will\r\nset out for New York on Thursdays, at three o'clock in the afternoon,\r\ntill Christmas. The southern post sets out next Monday for Annapolis,\r\nand continues going every fortnight during the summer season.' In 1773,\r\nJosiah Quincy, father and grandfather of the mayors of that name, of\r\nBoston, spent thirty-three days upon a journey from Georgetown, South\r\nCarolina, to Philadelphia. In 1775, General Washington was eleven days\r\ngoing from Philadelphia to Boston; upon his arrival at Watertown the\r\ncitizens turned out and congratulated him upon the _speed_ of his\r\njourney! Fifty years ago the regular mail time, between New York and\r\nAlbany, was eight days. Even as late as 1824, the United States mail was\r\nthirty-two days in passing from Portland to New Orleans. The news of the\r\ndeath of Napoleon Bonaparte, at St. Helena, May 5th, 1821, reached New\r\nYork on the fifteenth day of August.\r\n\r\nCanals were known to the ancients, and have been used, in a small way,\r\nby all nations, particularly the Dutch. But the world did not awake to\r\ntheir importance until 1817, when the State of New York entered upon the\r\nErie Canal project, which was completed in 1825. The introduction of\r\nsteamboats for river navigation, and of locomotives upon railways, have\r\nsuperseded canals, and invested them with an air of antiquity. It was\r\nnot until 1807 that Robert Fulton put his first vessel in operation on\r\nthe Hudson River.\r\n\r\nTo the American steamship Savannah, built by Croker & Fickett, at\r\nCorlear's Hook, New York, is universally conceded the honor of being the\r\nfirst steam-propelled vessel that ever crossed the Atlantic ocean. She\r\nwas three hundred and eighty tons burden, ship-rigged, and was equipped\r\nwith a horizontal engine, placed between decks, with boilers in the\r\nhold. She was built through the agency of Captain Moses Rogers, by a\r\ncompany of gentlemen, with a view of selling her to the emperor of\r\nRussia. She sailed from New York in 1819, and went first to Savannah;\r\nthence she proceeded direct to Liverpool, where she arrived after a\r\npassage of eighteen days, during seven of which she was under steam. As\r\nit was nearly or quite impossible to carry sufficient fuel for the\r\nvoyage, during pleasant weather the wheels were removed, and canvas\r\nsubstituted. At Liverpool she was visited by many persons of\r\ndistinction, and afterward departed for Elsinore, on her way to St.\r\nPetersburg. She was not, however, sold as expected, and next touched at\r\nCopenhagen, where Captain Rogers was offered one hundred thousand\r\ndollars for her by the king of Sweden; but the offer was declined. She\r\nthen sailed for home, putting into Elsington, on the coast of Norway.\r\nFrom the latter place she was twenty-two days in reaching Savannah. On\r\naccount of the high price of fuel, she carried no steam on the return\r\npassage, and the wheels were taken off. Upon the completion of the\r\nvoyage, she was purchased by Captain Nathaniel Holdredge, divested of\r\nher steam apparatus, and run as a packet between Savannah and New York.\r\nShe subsequently went ashore on Long Island, and broke up. Sixty\r\nthousand dollars were sunk in the transaction. Captain Rogers died a few\r\nyears ago on the Pee Dee river, North Carolina. He is believed to be the\r\nfirst man that ran a steamboat to Philadelphia or Baltimore. The mate\r\nwas named Stephen Rogers, and was living a few years ago at New London,\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nThe first railway in England was between Stockton and Darlington; and\r\nthe first locomotive built in the world was used upon that road, and is\r\nstill in existence, being preserved at Darlington depot, upon a platform\r\nerected for the purpose; the date 1825 is engraved upon its plate. The\r\nfirst railway charter in the United States was granted March 4th, 1826,\r\nto Thomas H. Perkins and others, 'to convey granite from the ledges in\r\nQuincy to tidewater in that town.' The first railway in the United\r\nStates upon which passengers were conveyed, was the Baltimore and Ohio,\r\nwhich was opened December 28, 1829, to Ellicott's Mills, thirteen miles\r\nfrom Baltimore. A single horse was attached to two of Winan's carriages,\r\ncontaining forty-one persons, which were drawn, with ease, eleven miles\r\nper hour. The South Carolina Railway, from Charleston to Hamburg, was\r\nthe first constructed in the United States with a view to use _steam_\r\ninstead of _animal_ power. The first locomotive constructed in the\r\nUnited States was built for this road. It was named the _Best Friend_,\r\nand afterward changed to _Phoenix_. It was built at the West Point\r\nfoundery by the Messrs. Kemble, under the direction of E.L. Miller, Esq.\r\nIts performance was tested on the 9th December, 1830, and exceeded\r\nexpectations. To Mr. Miller, therefore, belongs the honor of planning\r\nand constructing the first locomotive operated in the United States.\r\nThis road was the first to carry the United States mail, and, when\r\ncompleted, October 2d, 1833, one hundred and thirty-seven miles in\r\nlength, was the longest railway in the world. The number of miles of\r\nrailway in operation in the United States, at the present time, is\r\nthirty-two thousand; and the number of passengers conveyed upon them in\r\n1863 was one hundred millions. Railways did not cross the Mississippi\r\nriver until 1851. The number of miles of railway in the world is\r\nseventy-two thousand; and the amount of steamboat tonnage is five\r\nmillions of tons.\r\n\r\nYet more astonishing than the railway is the magnetic telegraph, whose\r\nexploits are literally miraculous, annihilating space and time. The\r\nextremities of the globe are brought into immediate contact; the\r\nmerchant, the friend, or the lover converses with whom he wishes, though\r\nthousands of miles apart, as if they occupied the same parlor; and the\r\nspeech uttered in Washington to-day may be read in San Francisco three\r\nhours before it is delivered. Could the wires be extended around the\r\nglobe, we should be able to hear the news one day before it occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NAOMI TORRENTE: The History of a Woman. By GERTRUDE F. DE VINGUT.\r\n     'Every dream of love argues a reality in the world of supreme\r\n     beauty. Believe all that thy heart prompts, for everything that it\r\n     seeks, exists.'--_Plato_. New York: John Bradburn (late M.\r\n     Doolady), publisher, 49 Walker street.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho could look on the fair high face, facing our title page, and have\r\nthe heart to criticize the revelations of its soul? Naomi is a book of\r\nfeeling, passion, and considerable, if not yet mature, power. It is\r\ndedicated to Sr. Dn. Juan Clemente Zenea, editor of _La Charanga_,\r\nHavana. Our authoress says in her dedication: 'It is to you, therefore;\r\nand those who like you have deeply felt, that the history of a woman's\r\nsoul-life will prove more interesting than the mere narrative of the\r\nchances and occurrences that make up the every-day natural existence.'\r\nNaomi is a woman of artistic genius and passionate character, becalmed\r\nin the stagnation of conventional life, who, throwing off the fetters of\r\nan uncongenial and inconsiderate marriage, attempts to find happiness\r\nand independence in the cultivation of her own powers. She is eminently\r\nsuccessful as prima donna, is brilliant and self-sustained--but fails to\r\nattain the imagined happiness, the Love-Eden so fervently sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MARGARET AND HER BRIDESMAIDS. By the Author of 'The Queen of the\r\n     Country,' 'The Challenge,' etc. 'Queen Rose of the Rosebud garden\r\n     of girls.'--_Tennyson_. Loring, publisher, 314 Washington street,\r\n     Boston. 1864.\r\n\r\nA novel of domestic life, in which the plot, apparently simple, is yet\r\nartistic and skilfully managed. The thread of life of the bridesmaids is\r\nheld with that of the bride, the development of character, distinctly\r\nmarked in each, progresses through a series of natural events, until the\r\nyoung people reach the point of life when impulse settles into\r\nprinciple, amiability into virtue, generosity into self-abnegation, and\r\nwe feel that each may now be safely left to life as it is, that\r\ncircumstance can no longer mould character, and are willing to leave\r\nthem, certain they will henceforth remain true to themselves, and to\r\nthose whose happiness may depend upon them, whatever else may betide.\r\nThe bride is a pure, sweet, generous woman, but the character of the\r\nbook is decidedly Lotty. Childish, petite, and indulged, she is yet\r\nmagnanimous, brave, and self-sacrificing; fiery, fearless, and frank,\r\nshe is still patient, forbearing, and reticent; we love her as child,\r\nwhile we soon learn to venerate her as woman. She and her docile\r\nbloodhound, Bear, form pictures full of magic contrast, groups of which\r\nwe never tire. The cordiality and heartiness of her admiring relatives,\r\nthe Beauvilliers, are contagious; we live for the time in their life,\r\nand grow stronger as we read. The book is charming. Its moral is\r\nunexceptionable, its characters well drawn, its plot and incidents\r\nsimple and natural, and its interest sustained from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ENOCH ARDEN, etc. By ALFRED TENNYSON, D.C.L., Poet Laureate.\r\n     Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1864.\r\n\r\nTennyson has so many devoted admirers, that this volume cannot fail to\r\nreceive due attention. The principal poem therein, Enoch Arden, is one\r\nof touching pathos and simplicity. Three children, Enoch Arden, Philip\r\nRay, and Annie Lee, grew up together on the British coast a hundred\r\nyears ago. Both youths loved Annie: she loved and married Enoch. They\r\nlive happily together until three children are born to the house: then\r\npoverty threatens, and Arden leaves home to provide for the loved ones.\r\nHe is cast away on an island, is not heard, from for ten years, and\r\nAnnie reluctantly consents to marry Philip, who has been a father to her\r\nchildren during their long orphanage. Arden returns at last to his\r\nnative village, so old, gray, and broken, that no one recognizes him.\r\nHe hears how true his wife had been to him until all hope had died away,\r\nand how Philip cared for her peace, and cherished his children. The\r\nwretched man resolves to bear his grief in silence, and never to bring\r\nagony and shame to a peaceful home by disclosing his return. He does\r\nthis in a spirit of Christian self-abnegation, lives near the\r\nunconscious darlings of his heart, earns his frugal living, watching\r\nround, but never entering the lost Paradise of his youth. He dies, and\r\nonly at the hour of death, reveals to Annie how he had lived and loved.\r\nThe _theme_ of this tale has often been taken before. It has been\r\nelaborated with passion and power in the 'Homeward Bound' of Adelaide\r\nProcter, a poetess too little known among us.\r\n\r\nThere is great purity of delineation and conception in Enoch Arden. The\r\ncharacters stand out real and palpable in their statuesque simplicity.\r\nThere is agony enough, but neither impatience nor sin. The epithets are\r\nwell chosen; but the usual wildering sensuousness of Tennyson's glowing\r\nimagery is subdued and tender throughout the progress of this melancholy\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n'Aylmer's Field,' about the same length, is a poem of more stormy mould.\r\nIt hurls fierce rebukes at family pride, and just censures at tyrannical\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe volume contains many shorter poems, some of which are already\r\nfamiliar to our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     AZARIAN: An Episode. By HARRIET ELIZABETH PRESCOTT, Author of 'The\r\n     Amber Gods,' etc. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n\r\nWe like 'Azarian' better than any work we have yet seen from Miss\r\nPrescott. Ruth Yetton, the heroine, is so truly feminine, she might\r\nserve as a type of half our innocent maidens from sixteen to twenty.\r\nAzarian is real and drawn to the life, a hero who has his counterpart in\r\nevery civilized city; a man of _savoir-vivre_, glittering and\r\nattractive, but selfish, inconsequent, frivolous, and deadly to the\r\npeace of those who love him. Miss Prescott's style is elaborate and\r\nflorid, frequently of rare beauty, always giving evidence of culture and\r\nscholarship. Do we find fault with the hundred-leaved rose? Her fancy is\r\nluxuriant, of more power than her imagination. Her descriptions of\r\nflowers in the volume before us are accurate and tenderly beautiful. She\r\nknows them all, and evidently loves them well. Nor are the fragile\r\nblossoms of the trees less dear to her. She reads their secrets, and\r\ntreasures them in her heart. She paints them with her glowing words, and\r\nplacing our old darlings before us again, exultingly points out their\r\nhidden charms.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE FOREST ARCADIA OF NORTHERN NEW YORK: Embracing a View of its\r\n     Mineral, Agricultural, and Timber Resources. Boston: Published by\r\n     T.O.H.P. Burnham. New York: Oliver S. Felt. 1864.\r\n\r\nThe author of this pleasant, unpretending little book visited the 'great\r\nwilderness of Northern New York, which lies in St. Lawrence county, on\r\nthe western slope of the Adirondack Mountains. It forms part of an\r\nextensive plateau, embracing an area of many thousand square miles, and\r\nis elevated from fifteen to eighteen hundred feet above the sea. The\r\nmineral resources of the plateau are of great value, immense ranges of\r\nmagnetic iron traverse the country, and there are indications of more\r\nvaluable minerals in a few localities. Of its agricultural importance\r\ntoo much cannot be said. The soil is rich and strong, peculiarly adapted\r\nto the grazing of cattle. The climate is that of the hill country of New\r\nEngland.'\r\n\r\nThe reader will see from this extract of what the book treats. The\r\nvolume is pleasantly and simply written, imparts considerable\r\ninformation with respect to the region which it describes, is redolent\r\nof spicy forest breath, and brings before us Indian, deer, and beaver.\r\n\r\n\r\n     RHODE ISLAND IN THE REBELLION. By EDWIN W. STONE, of the First\r\n     Regiment Rhode Island Light Artillery. Providence: George H.\r\n     Whitney. 1864.\r\n\r\n'These Letters were written amid camp scenes and on the march,' says our\r\nauthor, 'under circumstances unfavorable to literary composition, and\r\nwere intended for private perusal alone. Portions of them appeared in\r\nthe _Providence Journal_, and were received with a favor alike\r\nunexpected and gratifying. Numerous requests having been made that they\r\nshould be gathered up as a Rhode Island contribution to the history of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion, the author, with unaffected distrust of\r\nhimself, has yielded to the judgment of others. While the aim has been\r\nto show the honorable position of the State in an unhappy war, it has\r\nalso been the design to present a comprehensive view of the consecutive\r\ncampaigns of the Army of the Potomac, with the fortunes of which several\r\nof the Rhode Island regiments and most of the batteries have, for longer\r\nor shorter periods, been identified.'\r\n\r\nIt is a noble record for Rhode Island, and a valuable contribution to\r\nthe history of the war. It deals with facts, not polities or prejudices.\r\nWe think every loyal State should prepare such a volume. A simple and\r\nreliable statement of what she has herself done, a sketch of her heroes\r\nof all ranks and parties, of her batteries, regiments, and companies, of\r\nher commandants and the battles in which her troops bore part, should be\r\ntherein contained. This would lead to noble emulation among the States\r\nstruggling for a common cause, and would be of great value both to State\r\nand general history. We look upon this book as a beginning in the right\r\nway. Such national records of nobly borne suffering and deeds of glory\r\nwould be truly Books of Honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ROBINSON'S MATHEMATICAL SERIES: Arithmetical Examples; or, Test\r\n     Exercises for the Use of Advanced Classes. New York: Ivison,\r\n     Phinney, Blakeman & Co., 48 & 50 Walker street. Chicago: S.C.\r\n     Griggs & Co., 39 & 41 Lake street. 1864.\r\n\r\nThis book was issued to meet the demand in advanced schools for a larger\r\nnumber of carefully prepared and practical examples for review and drill\r\nexercises than are furnished from ordinary text books, and may be used\r\nin connection with any other books on this subject. 'The examples are\r\ndesigned to test the pupil's judgment; to bring into use his knowledge\r\nof the theory and applications of numbers; to cultivate habits of\r\npatient investigation and self-reliance; to test the truth and accuracy\r\nof his own processes by proof--the only test he will have to depend on\r\nin the real business transactions of afterlife; in a word, to make him\r\nindependent of all text books, of written rules and analyses.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     A LATIN GRAMMAR FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. By ALBERT HARKNESS, Ph.\r\n     D., Professor in Brown University, Author of 'A First Latin Book,'\r\n     'A Second Latin Book,' 'A First Greek Book,' etc. New York: D.\r\n     Appleton & Co., 443 & 445 Broadway.\r\n\r\nProf. Harkness's Grammar will be welcomed both by teacher and student.\r\nOur author is a man of great experience in the subjects of which he\r\ntreats, and we doubt not he has supplied a general want in the work\r\nbefore us, and furnished a true grammar of the Latin tongue, worthy of\r\nadoption in all our educational institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     RITA: An Autobiography. By HAMILTON AIDE, Author of 'Confidences,'\r\n     'Carr of Carrlyon,' 'Mr. and Mrs. Faulconbridge,' etc. Boston:\r\n     Published by T.O.P. Burnham. New York: Oliver S. Felt.\r\n\r\nThis novel is the autobiography of a young English girl, thrown by her\r\nfather, a man of high birth, but worthless character, into the vicious\r\ninfluences of corrupt English and French society. The story is one of a\r\nconstant struggle between these base examples on the one hand, and a\r\nstrong sense of right and justice on the other. The plot is original and\r\nquite elaborate, and the interest well sustained. The character of the\r\nunprincipled, heartless, gambling father is well drawn, as well as that\r\nof the weak but self-sacrificing mother. Some of the scenes evince\r\nconsiderable power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nReaders of THE CONTINENTAL, your servant and faithful caterer has been a\r\nsad idler and vagrant for the last month, thinking more of his own\r\npleasures than of your needs and requirements. Forgive him, he is again\r\na working bee and seeking honey for your hives. Have patience, irate\r\ncorrespondents; we have absconded with no manuscripts, and are again at\r\nour desk to give bland answers to curt missives.\r\n\r\nWe have been among the Adirondacks; congratulate us right heartily\r\nthereon! We have traversed pathless primeval forests of larches,\r\nbalsams, white pines, and sugar maples; we have floated upon lakes\r\nlovely enough to have mirrored Paradise; we have clambered down\r\nwaterfalls whose broken drops turned into diamonds as they fell; have\r\nscaled mountains and seen earth in its glory, and looked clear up into\r\nthe infinite blue of the eye of God.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the gleaming trout, changeful as a prisoned rainbow, lured\r\nfrom his cool stream; and the poor deer chased from his forest home by\r\nsavage dogs and cruel men, driven into crystal lakes, lassoed there with\r\nropes, throats cut with dull knives, and backs broken with flying balls.\r\nImmortal Shakspeare! had thy lines no power to awaken pity for\r\nfrightened fawn and flying doe? Did they not see\r\n\r\n  'The wretched animal heave forth such groans\r\n  That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat\r\n  Almost to bursting; while the big round tears\r\n  Coursed one another down his innocent nose\r\n  In Piteous chase?'\r\n\r\nAlas, 'poor hairy fool!' why should they seek thee in thy mountain\r\nhomes?\r\n\r\nWe have sat by the side of fair fragile country girls, and heard the\r\nexperiences of the stout pioneers of civilization. We have tried to keep\r\nstep with city maidens, shorn of ridiculous hoops and trailing trains.\r\nWe nave known them trip up the great sides of Tahawus, press through the\r\ntrunked and bouldered horrors of Indian Pass, float over Lake Placid,\r\nand scale the long steep slide up the crest of White Face. Lovely as\r\ndreams and light as clouds, no toil stayed them, no danger appalled;\r\npanther, wolf, and bear stories were told in vain by lazy brothers and\r\nreluctant lovers; on they went in their restless search for beauty,\r\ntheir Turkish dress and scarlet tunics gleaming through the trees, to\r\nthe delight of the old mountain guides, who chuckled over their\r\nCamilla-like exploits, and laughed, as they plucked the fragrant boughs\r\nfor their spicy couch, over the ignorance and awkwardness of their lazy\r\ncity beaux. These fair Dians shoot no deer, nor lure the springing\r\ntrout. We blessed them as they went their thymy way.\r\n\r\nWe have sat in the hut of the farmer, the skiff of the oarsman, the\r\nparlor of the host of the inn; tried wagons, stages, and buck-board\r\nconveyances; we have disputed no bill, been subjected to no extortion,\r\nand, save the death of the 'hairy fools,' known no sorrow. We have sat\r\nby the grave of old John Brown, seen the glorious view from his simple\r\nhome, heard his strange generosity extolled by his political enemies,\r\nand think we understand better than of old the sublime madness of his\r\nfanaticism. We have returned to our labor with a new love of country, a\r\ndeeper sense of responsibility, of the worth of our institutions, and of\r\nthe glory yet to be in 'Our Great America.' What a land to live and die\r\nfor! Every drop of martyr blood poured upon it but makes it dearer to\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEERLESS COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A National Song._\r\n\r\n            God of our Fathers,\r\n              Smile on our land!\r\n            Lo, the storm gathers--\r\n              Stretch forth Thy hand!\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._--Shield us and guard us from mountain to sea!\r\n            Make the homes happy where manhood is free!\r\n\r\n            Brave is our nation,\r\n              Hopeful and young;\r\n            High is her station\r\n              Countries among.\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._--Holy our banner! from mountain to sea\r\n            Floating in splendor o'er homes ever free.\r\n\r\n            Proud is our story,\r\n              Written in light;\r\n            Stars tell its glory,\r\n              Victory, might.\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._--Peerless Columbia! from mountain to sea\r\n            Throbs every pulse through the heart of the free.\r\n\r\n            Up with our banner!\r\n              Hope in each fold--\r\n            Stout hearts will man her,\r\n              Millions untold.\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._--Millions now greet her from mountain to sea,\r\n            Hope of the toil-worn! blest Flag of the free!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following thoughts on some of the uses subserved by Art, are from\r\nthe pen of the Rev. J. Byington Smith. There is so much truth in their\r\nsuggestions, that we heartily commend them to our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nART AS A MEANS OF HOME-CULTURE.\r\n\r\nBY J. BYINGTON SMITH.\r\n\r\nArt is closely allied to nature in giving impress to character. The\r\nscenery by which a people is surrounded, will modify and almost control\r\nits mode of being. The soft, rich landscapes of Italy enervate, while\r\nthe rough mountainous country of the North imparts force and vigor.\r\nMountains and seas are nature's healthful stimulants. Man grows in their\r\nvastness and is energized in their strength. Whatever may be the scenery\r\nof a people, it will mirror itself in the mind, and stamp its impress\r\nupon character.\r\n\r\nArt reproduces nature, arranging its illimitable stores in closer unity,\r\nidealizing its charms, and bringing into nearer view its symmetry and\r\nbeauty. Bearing its lessons from afar, it colors the glowing canvas and\r\nchisels the stone to awaken the impressions it designs to make on the\r\nhuman soul. Thus art, like nature, becomes a means of culture. When the\r\nLombards wished to give hardihood and system to the enervated body and\r\nenfeebled mind of the people, they covered their churches with the\r\nsculptured representation of vigorous bodily exercises, such as war and\r\nhunting. In the great church of St. Mark, at Venice, people were taught\r\nthe history of the Scriptures by means of imagery; a picture on the\r\nwalls being more easily read than a chapter. Such walls were styled the\r\npoor man's Bible.\r\n\r\nA picture reveals at a single glance that which we would be otherwise\r\nforced to glean by a slow process from the scattered material furnished\r\nby the printed page; hence the delight taken in illustrations, the\r\nimportance of pictorial instruction for the young, and the almost\r\nuniversal demand for the illustrated publications of the day.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of art through painting, sculpture, and engraving, finds\r\nits way into our homes, and while lessons may be duly read from books\r\nand then laid aside, the lessons in the niche or on the wall repeat\r\nthemselves hour by hour, and day by day, looking even into the pure eyes\r\nof infancy, and aiding in the formation of the character of every child\r\nsubjected to their ceaseless influence. Their power is none the less\r\nbecause they never break the home-silence; they mould the young life and\r\nstamp their impress upon it. How important then that all such objects\r\nshould be chosen, not only as treasures of artistic beauty, but for\r\ntheir power to elevate and ennoble character.\r\n\r\nHow often will you find in the room of the scholar, the studio of the\r\nartist, the picture or bust of some old master in art or letters, as if\r\nthe occupant were conscious of the incentive such presence offered to\r\nhis own efforts--the guardian genius of the spot.\r\n\r\nIn the study of one of the old divines might have been seen a painted\r\neye, gazing forever down upon him, to render him sensible of the\r\npresence of the All-Seeing--to stamp the 'Thou God seest me' upon the\r\nvery tablets of his heart.\r\n\r\nA child is not so readily tempted into sin when surrounded by pure and\r\nbeautiful imagery, or when gentle loving eyes are looking down upon him.\r\nOn the other hand, the walls of the degraded are lined with amorous and\r\nobscene images, that vicious habits and debased tastes may find their\r\nsuitable incentives.\r\n\r\nA window shade bearing the design of a little girl issuing, basket in\r\nhand, from the door of a humble cottage, to relieve the wants of a poor\r\nblind beggar, will certainly take its place among the early developments\r\nof the children growing up under its influence, and in their simple\r\ncharity they may be found, basket in hand, looking out for real or\r\nfancied beggars. Such lessons are never lost. In a parlor which I often\r\nfrequent is a picture of a Sabbath scene: an aged grand-sire is seated\r\nby a table on which lies an open Bible, a bright-eyed boy is opposite,\r\nhis father and mother on either side, a little shy girl is on the knee\r\nof the old man, all are listening reverently to the holy Word of God,\r\nbooks and a vase of gay flowers are on the table, green boughs fill the\r\ngreat old-fashioned fireplace. The whole picture wears an air of\r\nserenity and calm happiness, and is an impressive plea that we 'remember\r\nand keep holy the Sabbath day'--and we verily believe that such a\r\npicture will do more to influence our children to love the Sabbath, than\r\nany amount of parental restraint or lectures on moral obligation.\r\n\r\nThere is another picture in the same quiet room: 'The Mother's Dream.'\r\nShe is worn with watching, and lies dreaming beside the couch of the\r\nchild. Rays of light open a bright pathway into the skies, while an\r\nangel is bearing the spirit child along it up to heaven. We think such a\r\npicture is worth more to familiarize childhood with death and\r\nresurrection, and will leave a sweeter and more lasting impression upon\r\nthe young soul, than the most learned dissertation or simplest\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nLandscape painting exerts a mellowing influence, and leads to the\r\nobservation and love of nature, while historical pictures stimulate\r\nresearch, and nerve the mind to deeds of heroism and virtue.\r\n\r\nThe influence of pictures in forming character and shaping the course of\r\nlife is illustrated with peculiar power in the history of the sons of a\r\nquiet family in the interior, who all insisted upon going to sea. The\r\nparents were grieved that none of their boys would remain at home to\r\ncare for the homestead, and be the comfort of their declining years.\r\nThey expressed their disappointment to a friend then on a visit to them,\r\nand wondered what could have induced the boys, one after the other, to\r\nembrace a life so full of storm and danger. Directly over the open\r\nfireplace hung a picture of a vessel with fluttering, snowy sails,\r\ntossing and rocking amid the bright, green, yeasty waves. The friend saw\r\nit, read the mystery, and quietly inquired how long it had been there.\r\n'Since we commenced housekeeping,' was the unconscious reply. Not\r\nwishing to wound them, he was silent, and concealed his thoughts in his\r\nown breast, but the solution of the choice of life in the absent ones\r\nwas clear enough to him: _that picture had sent them off, one after\r\nanother, to sea_.\r\n\r\nHow careful we should then be in surrounding youth and childhood with\r\npure, elevating objects of art, as means of constant home-culture! We\r\nknow we shall be told, 'This is all very good, but we cannot afford it.'\r\nLet us reason together. Can you not deduct something from your elaborate\r\nfurniture, your expensive dress, and devote it to models, lithographs,\r\nor paintings? Subtract but the half from these luxuries and devote the\r\nsum to designs of art, and you will contribute doubly to the\r\nattractiveness and pleasantness of your home. Where we cannot hope to\r\npossess the original masterpiece, we may have photographic or\r\nlithographic copies, which are within the compass of very humble means.\r\nYou will freely toss away five dollars in useless embroidery or surplus\r\nfurniture, and it would buy you a lithograph of Raphael's immortal\r\npicture, giving the results of a whole age of artistic culture, or a\r\nphotograph of Cheney's Madonna and Child, bearing the very spirit of the\r\noriginal, or a plaster cast of noble statuary, the original of which\r\ncould not be obtained for any namable sum--and yet you say you cannot\r\nafford works of art!\r\n\r\nThere is surely nothing you can afford better than to make your home\r\nattractive, and to introduce therein every available means of mental and\r\nmoral culture. If you cannot afford to make home lovely, others will\r\nsucceed in making dangerous places attractive to your children. There\r\nare spots enough kept light and picturesque, perilously fascinating to\r\nthose whose homes boast no attractions. It will likely cost you far more\r\nin money, more surely in heart-anguish and sorrow, to have your children\r\nentertained in these places full of snares, where corrupt art lavishes\r\nher designs with unsparing hand, to vitiate the young imagination and\r\ndebase the mind, than to exalt her in her chaste and ennobling power in\r\nthe sanctuary of your homes, as one of the means of home-culture,\r\nstimulating to virtue and stamping the character with genuine worth.",
