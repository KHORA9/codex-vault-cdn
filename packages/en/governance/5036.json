He has left his mark upon history. He has made justice more\r\ncertain and peace more secure. The surpassing tribute paid to his memory as\r\nhe was borne across the continent to rest at last at home revealed the\r\nplace he held in the hearts of the American people. But this is not the\r\noccasion for extended reference to the man or his work. In this presence,\r\namong these who knew and loved him, that is unnecessary. But we who were\r\nassociated with him could not resume together the functions of our office\r\nwithout pausing for a moment, and in his memory reconsecrating ourselves to\r\nthe service of our country. He is gone. We remain. It is our duty, under\r\nthe inspiration of his example, to take up the burdens which he was\r\npermitted to lay down, and to develop and support the wise principles of\r\ngovernment which he represented.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nFor us peace reigns everywhere. We desire to perpetuate it always by\r\ngranting full justice to others and requiring of others full justice to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nOur country has one cardinal principle to maintain in its foreign policy.\r\nIt is an American principle. It must be an American policy. We attend to\r\nour own affairs, conserve our own strength, and protect the interests of\r\nour own citizens; but we recognize thoroughly our obligation to help\r\nothers, reserving to the decision of our own Judgment the time, the place,\r\nand the method. We realize the common bond of humanity. We know the\r\ninescapable law of service.\r\n\r\nOur country has definitely refused to adopt and ratify the covenant of the\r\nLeague of Nations. We have not felt warranted in assuming the\r\nresponsibilities which its members have assumed. I am not proposing any\r\nchange in this policy; neither is the Senate. The incident, so far as we\r\nare concerned, is closed. The League exists as a foreign agency. We hope it\r\nwill be helpful. But the United States sees no reason to limit its own\r\nfreedom and independence of action by joining it. We shall do well to\r\nrecognize this basic fact in all national affairs and govern ourselves\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nWORLD COURT\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy has always been guided by two principles. The one is the\r\navoidance of permanent political alliances which would sacrifice our proper\r\nindependence. The other is the peaceful settlement of controversies between\r\nnations. By example and by treaty we have advocated arbitration. For nearly\r\n25 years we have been a member of The Hague Tribunal, and have long sought\r\nthe creation of a permanent World Court of Justice. I am in full accord\r\nwith both of these policies. I favor the establishment of such a court\r\nintended to include the whole world. That is, and has long been, an\r\nAmerican policy.\r\n\r\nPending before the Senate is a proposal that this Government give its\r\nsupport to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which is a new and\r\nsomewhat different plan. This is not a partisan question. It should not\r\nassume an artificial importance. The court is merely a convenient\r\ninstrument of adjustment to which we could go, but to which we could not\r\nbe brought. It should be discussed with entire candor, not by a political\r\nbut by a judicial method, without pressure and without prejudice.\r\nPartisanship has no place in our foreign relations. As I wish to see a\r\ncourt established, and as the proposal presents the only practical plan on\r\nwhich many nations have ever agreed, though it may not meet every desire, I\r\ntherefore commend it to the favorable consideration of the Senate, with the\r\nproposed reservations clearly indicating our refusal to adhere to the\r\nLeague of Nations.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic relations, lately so largely interrupted, are now being\r\nresumed, but Russia presents notable difficulties. We have every desire to\r\nsee that great people, who are our traditional friends, restored to their\r\nposition among the nations of the earth. We have relieved their pitiable\r\ndestitution with an enormous charity. Our Government offers no objection\r\nto the carrying on of commerce by our citizens with the people of Russia.\r\nOur Government does not propose, however, to enter into relations with\r\nanother regime which refuses to recognize the sanctity of international\r\nobligations. I do not propose to barter away for the privilege of trade any\r\nof the cherished rights of humanity. I do not propose to make merchandise\r\nof any American principles. These rights and principles must go wherever\r\nthe sanctions of our Government go.\r\n\r\nBut while the favor of America is not for sale, I am willing to make very\r\nlarge concessions for the purpose of rescuing the people of Russia. Already\r\nencouraging evidences of returning to the ancient ways of society can be\r\ndetected. But more are needed. Whenever there appears any disposition to\r\ncompensate our citizens who were despoiled, and to recognize that debt\r\ncontracted with our Government, not by the Czar, but by the newly formed\r\nRepublic of Russia; whenever the active spirit of enmity to our\r\ninstitutions is abated; whenever there appear works mete for repentance;\r\nour country ought to be the first to go to the economic and moral rescue of\r\nRussia. We have every desire to help and no desire to injure. We hope the\r\ntime is near at hand when we can act.\r\n\r\nDEBTS\r\n\r\nThe current debt and interest due from foreign Governments, exclusive of\r\nthe British debt of $4,600,000,000, is about $7,200,000,000. I do not favor\r\nthe cancellation of this debt, but I see no objection to adjusting it in\r\naccordance with the principle adopted for the British debt. Our country\r\nwould not wish to assume the role of an oppressive creditor, but would\r\nmaintain the principle that financial obligations between nations are\r\nlikewise moral obligations which international faith and honor require\r\nshould be discharged.\r\n\r\nOur Government has a liquidated claim against Germany for the expense of\r\nthe army of occupation of over $255,000,000. Besides this, the Mixed Claims\r\nCommission have before them about 12,500 claims of American citizens,\r\naggregating about $1,225,000,000. These claims have already been reduced by\r\na recent decision, but there are valid claims reaching well toward\r\n$500,000,000. Our thousands of citizens with credits due them of hundreds\r\nof millions of dollars have no redress save in the action of our\r\nGovernment. These are very substantial interests, which it is the duty of\r\nour Government to protect as best it can. That course I propose to pursue.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that we have a direct interest in the economic\r\nrecovery of Europe. They are enlarged by our desire for the stability of\r\ncivilization and the welfare of humanity. That we are making sacrifices to\r\nthat end none can deny. Our deferred interest alone amounts to a million\r\ndollars every day. But recently we offered to aid with our advice and\r\ncounsel. We have reiterated our desire to see France paid and Germany\r\nrevived. We have proposed disarmament. We have earnestly sought to compose\r\ndifferences and restore peace. We shall persevere in well-doing, not by\r\nforce, but by reason.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN PAPERS\r\n\r\nUnder the law the papers pertaining to foreign relations to be printed are\r\ntransmitted as a part of this message. Other volumes of these papers will\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe foreign service of our Government needs to be reorganized and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nFISCAL CONDITION\r\n\r\nOur main problems are domestic problems. Financial stability is the first\r\nrequisite of sound government. We can not escape the effect of world\r\nconditions. We can not avoid the inevitable results of the economic\r\ndisorders which have reached all nations. But we shall diminish their harm\r\nto us in proportion as we continue to restore our Government finances to a\r\nsecure and endurable position. This we can and must do. Upon that firm\r\nfoundation rests the only hope of progress and prosperity. From that source\r\nmust come relief for the people.\r\n\r\nThis is being, accomplished by a drastic but orderly retrenchment, which is\r\nbringing our expenses within our means. The origin of this has been the\r\ndetermination of the American people, the main support has been the courage\r\nof those in authority, and the effective method has been the Budget System.\r\nThe result has involved real sacrifice by department heads, but it has been\r\nmade without flinching. This system is a law of the Congress. It represents\r\nyour will. It must be maintained, and ought to be strengthened by the\r\nexample of your observance. Without a Budget System there can be no fixed\r\nresponsibility and no constructive scientific economy.\r\n\r\nThis great concentration of effort by the administration and Congress has\r\nbrought the expenditures, exclusive of the self-supporting Post. Office\r\nDepartment, down to three billion dollars. It is possible, in consequence,\r\nto make a large reduction in the taxes of the people, which is the sole\r\nobject of all curtailment. This is treated at greater length in the Budget\r\nmessage, and a proposed plan has been presented in detail in a statement by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury which has my unqualified approval. I\r\nespecially commend a decrease on earned incomes, and further abolition of\r\nadmission, message, and nuisance taxes. The amusement and educational\r\nvalue of moving pictures ought not to be taxed. Diminishing charges against\r\nmoderate incomes from investment will afford immense relief, while a\r\nrevision of the surtaxes will not only provide additional money for capital\r\ninvestment, thus stimulating industry and employing more but will not\r\ngreatly reduce the revenue from that source, and may in the future actually\r\nincrease it.\r\n\r\nBeing opposed to war taxes in time of peace, I am not in favor of\r\nexcess-profits taxes. A very great service could be rendered through\r\nimmediate enactment of legislation relieving the people of some of the\r\nburden of taxation. To reduce war taxes is to give every home a better\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nFor seven years the people have borne with uncomplaining courage the\r\ntremendous burden of national and local taxation. These must both be\r\nreduced. The taxes of the Nation must be reduced now as much as prudence\r\nwill permit, and expenditures must be reduced accordingly. High taxes reach\r\neverywhere and burden everybody. They gear most heavily upon the poor. They\r\ndiminish industry and commerce. They make agriculture unprofitable. They\r\nincrease the rates on transportation. They are a charge on every necessary\r\nof life. Of all services which the Congress can render to the country, I\r\nhave no hesitation in declaring t neglect it, to postpone it, to obstruct\r\nit by unsound proposals, is to become unworthy of public confidence and\r\nuntrue to public trust. The country wants this measure to have the right of\r\nway over an others.\r\n\r\nAnother reform which is urgent in our fiscal system is the abolition of the\r\nright to issue tax-exempt securities. The existing system not only permits\r\na large amount of the wealth of the Notion to escape its just burden but\r\nacts as a continual stimulant to municipal extravagance. This should be\r\nprohibited by constitutional amendment. All the wealth of the Nation ought\r\nto contribute its fair share to the expenses of the Nation.\r\n\r\nTARIFF LAW\r\n\r\nThe present tariff law has accomplished its two main objects. It has\r\nsecured an abundant revenue and been productive of an abounding prosperity.\r\nUnder it the country has had a very large export and import trade. A\r\nconstant revision of the tariff by the Congress is disturbing and harmful.\r\nThe present law contains an elastic provision authorizing the President to\r\nincrease or decrease present schedules not in excess of 50 per centum to\r\nmeet the difference in cost of production at home and abroad. This does\r\nnot, to my mind, warrant a rewriting g of the whole law, but does mean, and\r\nwill be so administered, that whenever the required investigation shows\r\nthat inequalities of sufficient importance exist in any schedule, the power\r\nto change them should and will be applied.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING\r\n\r\nThe entire well being of our country is dependent upon transportation by\r\nsea and land. Our Government during the war acquired a large merchant fleet\r\nwhich should be transferred, as soon as possible, to private ownership and\r\noperation under conditions which would secure two results: First, and of\r\nprime importance, adequate means for national defense; second, adequate\r\nservice to American commerce. Until shipping conditions are such that our\r\nfleet can be disposed of advantageously under these conditions, it will be\r\noperated as economically as possible under such plans as may be devised\r\nfrom time to time by the Shipping Board. We must have a merchant marine\r\nwhich meets these requirements, and we shall have to pay the cost of its\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe time has come to resume in a moderate way the opening of our\r\nintracoastal waterways; the control of flood waters of the Mississippi and\r\nof the Colorado Rivers; the improvement of the waterways from the Great\r\nLakes toward the Gulf of Mexico; and the development of the great power and\r\nnavigation project of the St. Lawrence River, for which efforts are now\r\nbeing made to secure the necessary treaty with Canada. These projects can\r\nnot all be undertaken at once, but all should have the immediate\r\nconsideration of the Congress and be adopted as fast as plans can be\r\nmatured and the necessary funds become available. This is not incompatible\r\nwith economy, for their nature does not require so much a public\r\nexpenditure as a capital investment which will be reproductive, as\r\nevidenced by the marked increase in revenue from the Panama Canal. Upon\r\nthese projects depend much future industrial and agricultural progress.\r\nThey represent the protection of large areas from flood and the addition of\r\na great amount of cheap power and cheap freight by use of navigation, chief\r\nof which is the bringing of ocean-going ships to the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nAnother problem of allied character is the superpower development of the\r\nNortheastern States, consideration of which is growing under the direction\r\nof the Department of Commerce by joint conference with the local\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS\r\n\r\nCriticism of the railroad law has been directed, first, to the section\r\nlaying down the rule by which rates are fixed, and providing for payment to\r\nthe Government and use of excess earnings; second, to the method for the\r\nadjustment of wage scales; and third, to the authority permitting\r\nconsolidations.\r\n\r\nIt has been erroneously assumed that the act undertakes to guarantee\r\nrailroad earnings. The law requires that rates should be just and\r\nreasonable. That has always been the rule under which rates have been\r\nfixed. To make a rate that does not yield a fair return results in\r\nconfiscation, and confiscatory rates are of course unconstitutional. Unless\r\nthe Government adheres to the rule of making a rate that will yield a fair\r\nreturn, it must abandon rate making altogether. The new and important\r\nfeature of that part of the law is the recapture and redistribution of\r\nexcess rates. The constitutionality of this method is now before the\r\nSupreme Court for adjudication. Their decision should be awaited before\r\nattempting further legislation on this subject. Furthermore, the importance\r\nof this feature will not be great if consolidation goes into effect.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of railroad labor disputes is a matter of grave public\r\nconcern. The Labor Board was established to protect the public in the\r\nenjoyment of continuous service by attempting to insure justice between the\r\ncompanies and their employees. It has been a great help, but is not\r\naltogether satisfactory to the public, the employees, or the companies. If\r\na substantial agreement can be reached among the groups interested, there\r\nshould be no hesitation in enacting such agreement into law. If it is not\r\nreached, the Labor Board may very well be left for the present to protect\r\nthe public welfare.\r\n\r\nThe law for consolidations is not sufficiently effective to be expeditious.\r\nAdditional legislation is needed giving authority for voluntary\r\nconsolidations, both regional and route, and providing Government machinery\r\nto aid and stimulate such action, always subject to the approval of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. This should authorize the commission to\r\nappoint committees for each proposed group, representing the public and the\r\ncomponent roads, with power to negotiate with individual security holders\r\nfor an exchange of their securities for those of the, consolidation on such\r\nterms and conditions as the commission may prescribe for avoiding any\r\nconfiscation and preserving fair values. Should this permissive\r\nconsolidation prove ineffective after a limited period, the authority of\r\nthe Government will have to be directly invoked.\r\n\r\nConsolidation appears to be the only feasible method for the maintenance of\r\nan adequate system of transportation with an opportunity so to adjust\r\nfreight rates as to meet such temporary conditions as now prevail in some\r\nagricultural sections. Competent authorities agree that an entire\r\nreorganization of the rate structure for freight is necessary. This should\r\nbe ordered at once by the Congress.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nAs no revision of the laws of the United States has been made since 1878, a\r\ncommission or committee should be created to undertake this work. The\r\nJudicial Council reports that two more district judges are needed in the\r\nsouthern district of New York, one in the northern district of Georgia, and\r\ntwo more circuit judges in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth\r\nCircuit. Legislation should be considered for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to expedite the hearing and disposal of cases. A\r\ncommission of Federal judges and lawyers should be created to recommend\r\nlegislation by which the procedure in the Federal trial courts may be\r\nsimplified and regulated by rules of court, rather than by statute; such\r\nrules to be submitted to the Congress and to be in force until annulled or\r\nmodified by the Congress. The Supreme Court needs legislation revising and\r\nsimplifying the laws governing review by that court, and enlarging the\r\nclasses of cases of too little public importance to be subject to review.\r\nSuch reforms would expedite the transaction of the business of the courts.\r\nThe administration of justice is likely to fail if it be long delayed.\r\n\r\nThe National Government has never given adequate attention to its prison\r\nproblems. It ought to provide employment in such forms of production as can\r\nbe used by the Government, though not sold to the public in competition\r\nwith private business, for all prisoners who can be placed at work, and for\r\nwhich they should receive a reasonable compensation, available for their\r\ndependents.\r\n\r\nTwo independent reformatories are needed; one for the segregation of women,\r\nand another for the segregation of young men serving their first sentence.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice would be facilitated greatly by including in\r\nthe Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice a Division of\r\nCriminal Identification, where there would be collected this information\r\nwhich is now indispensable in the suppression of crime.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe prohibition amendment to the Constitution requires the Congress. and\r\nthe President to provide adequate laws to prevent its violation. It is my\r\nduty to enforce such laws. For that purpose a treaty is being negotiated\r\nwith Great Britain with respect to the right of search of hovering\r\nvessels. To prevent smuggling, the Coast Card should be greatly\r\nstrengthened, and a supply of swift power boats should be provided. The\r\nmajor sources of production should be rigidly regulated, and every effort\r\nshould be made to suppress interstate traffic. With this action on the part\r\nof the National Government, and the cooperation which is usually rendered\r\nby municipal and State authorities, prohibition should be made effective.\r\nFree government has no greater menace than disrespect for authority and\r\ncontinual violation of law. It is the duty of a citizen not only to observe\r\nthe law but to let it be known that he is opposed to its violation.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO\r\n\r\nNumbered among our population are some 12,000,000 colored people. Under our\r\nConstitution their rights are just as sacred as those of any other citizen.\r\nIt is both a public and a private duty to protect those rights. The\r\nCongress ought to exercise all its powers of prevention and punishment\r\nagainst the hideous crime of lynching, of which the negroes are by no means\r\nthe sole sufferers, but for which they furnish a majority of the victims.\r\n\r\nAlready a considerable sum is appropriated to give the negroes vocational\r\ntraining in agriculture. About half a million dollars is recommended for\r\nmedical courses at Howard University to help contribute to the education of\r\n500 colored doctors needed each year. On account of the integration of\r\nlarge numbers into industrial centers, it has been proposed that a\r\ncommission be created, composed of members from both races, to formulate a\r\nbetter policy for mutual understanding and confidence. Such an effort is to\r\nbe commended. Everyone would rejoice in the accomplishment of the results\r\nwhich it seeks. But it is well to recognize that these difficulties are to\r\na large extent local problems which must be worked out by the mutual\r\nforbearance and human kindness of each community. Such a method gives much\r\nmore promise of a real remedy than outside interference.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe maintenance and extension of the classified civil service is\r\nexceedingly important. There are nearly 550,000 persons in the executive\r\ncivil service drawing about $700,000,000 of yearly compensation.\r\nFour-fifths of these are in the classified service. This method of\r\nselection of the employees of the United States is especially desirable for\r\nthe Post Office Department. The Civil Service Commission has recommended\r\nthat postmasters at first, second, and third class offices be classified.\r\nSuch action, accompanied by a repeal of the four-year term of office, would\r\nundoubtedly be an improvement. I also recommend that the field force for\r\nprohibition enforcement be brought within the classified civil service\r\nwithout covering in the present membership. The best method for selecting\r\npublic servants is the merit system.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nMany of the departments in Washington need better housing facilities. Some\r\nare so crowded that their work is impeded, others are so scattered that\r\nthey lose their identity. While I do not favor at this time a general\r\npublic building law, I believe it is now necessary, in accordance with\r\nplans already sanctioned for a unified and orderly system for the\r\ndevelopment of this city, to begin the carrying out of those plans by\r\nauthorizing the erection of three or four buildings most urgently needed by\r\nan annual appropriation of $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nREGULATORY LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nCooperation with other maritime powers is necessary for complete protection\r\nof our coast waters from pollution. Plans for this are under way, but\r\nawait certain experiments for refuse disposal. Meantime laws prohibiting\r\nspreading oil and oil refuse from vessels in our own territorial waters\r\nwould be most helpful against this menace and should be speedily enacted.\r\n\r\nLaws should be passed regulating aviation.\r\n\r\nRevision is needed of the laws regulating radio interference.\r\n\r\nLegislation and regulations establishing load liner, to provide safe\r\nloading of vessels leaving our ports are necessary and recodification of\r\nour navigation laws is vital.\r\n\r\nRevision of procedure of the Federal Trade Commission will give more\r\nconstructive purpose to this department.\r\n\r\nIf our Alaskan fisheries are to be saved from destruction, there must be\r\nfurther legislation declaring a general policy and delegating the authority\r\nto make rules and regulations to an administrative body.\r\n\r\nARMY AND NAVY\r\n\r\nFor several years we have been decreasing the personnel of the Army and\r\nNavy, and reducing their power to the danger point. Further reductions\r\nshould not be made. The Army is a guarantee of the security of our citizens\r\nat home; the Navy is a guarantee of the security of our citizens abroad.\r\nBoth of these services should be strengthened rather than weakened.\r\nAdditional planes are needed for the Army, and additional submarines for\r\nthe Navy. The defenses of Panama must be perfected. We want no more\r\ncompetitive armaments. We want no more war. But we want no weakness that\r\ninvites imposition. A people who neglect their national defense are putting\r\nin jeopardy their national honor.\r\n\r\nINSULAR POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\nConditions in the insular possessions on the whole have been good. Their\r\nbusiness has been reviving. They are being administered according to law.\r\nThat effort has the full support of the administration. Such\r\nrecommendations as may conic from their people or their governments should\r\nhave the most considerate attention.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND WELFARE\r\n\r\nOur National Government is not doing as much as it legitimately can do to\r\npromote the welfare of the people. Our enormous material wealth, our\r\ninstitutions, our whole form of society, can not be considered fully\r\nsuccessful until their benefits reach the merit of every individual. This\r\nis not a suggestion that the Government should, or could, assume for the\r\npeople the inevitable burdens of existence. There is no method by which we\r\ncan either be relieved of the results of our own folly or be guaranteed a\r\nsuccessful life. There is an inescapable personal responsibility for the\r\ndevelopment of character, of industry, of thrift, and of self-control.\r\nThese do not come from the Government, but from the people themselves. But\r\nthe Government can and should always be expressive of steadfast\r\ndetermination, always vigilant, to maintain conditions under which these\r\nvirtues are most likely to develop and secure recognition and reward. This\r\nis the American policy.\r\n\r\nIt is in accordance with this principle that we have enacted laws for the\r\nprotection of the public health and have adopted prohibition in narcotic\r\ndrugs and intoxicating liquors. For purposes of national uniformity we\r\nought to provide, by constitutional amendment and appropriate legislation,\r\nfor a limitation of child labor, and in all cases under the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the Federal Government a minimum wage law for women, which\r\nwould undoubtedly find sufficient power of enforcement in the influence of\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nHaving in mind that education is peculiarly a local problem, and that it\r\nshould always be pursued with the largest freedom of choice by students and\r\nparents, nevertheless, the Federal Government might well give the benefit\r\nof its counsel and encouragement more freely in this direction. If anyone\r\ndoubts the need of concerted action by the States of the Nation for this\r\npurpose, it is only necessary to consider the appalling figures of\r\nilliteracy representing a condition which does not vary much in all parts\r\nof the Union. I do not favor the making of appropriations from the National\r\nTreasury to be expended directly on local education, but I do consider it a\r\nfundamental requirement of national activity which, accompanied by allied\r\nsubjects of welfare, is worthy of a separate department and a place in the\r\nCabinet. The humanitarian side of government should not be repressed, but\r\nshould be cultivated.\r\n\r\nMere intelligence, however, is not enough. Enlightenment must be\r\naccompanied by that moral power which is the product of the home and of\r\nrebellion. Real education and true welfare for the people rest inevitably\r\non this foundation, which the Government can approve and commend, but which\r\nthe people themselves must create.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nAmerican institutions rest solely on good citizenship. They were created by\r\npeople who had a background of self-government. New arrivals should be\r\nlimited to our capacity to absorb them into the ranks of good citizenship.\r\nAmerica must be kept American. For this purpose, it is necessary to\r\ncontinue a policy of restricted immigration. It would be well to make such\r\nimmigration of a selective nature with some inspection at the source, and\r\nbased either on a prior census or upon the record of naturalization. Either\r\nmethod would insure the admission of those with the largest capacity and\r\nbest intention of becoming citizens. I am convinced that our present\r\neconomic and social conditions warrant a limitation of those to be\r\nadmitted. We should find additional safety in a law requiring the immediate\r\nregistration of all aliens. Those who do not want to be partakers of the\r\nAmerican spirit ought not to settle in America.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nNo more important duty falls on the Government of the United States than\r\nthe adequate care of its veterans. Those suffering disabilities incurred in\r\nthe service must have sufficient hospital relief and compensation. Their\r\ndependents must be supported. Rehabilitation and vocational training must\r\nbe completed. All of this service must be clean, must be prompt and\r\neffective, and it must be administered in a spirit of the broadest and\r\ndeepest human sympathy. If investigation reveals any present defects of\r\nadministration or need Of legislation, orders will be given for the\r\nimmediate correction of administration, and recommendations for legislation\r\nshould be given the highest preference.\r\n\r\nAt present there are 9,500 vacant beds in Government hospitals, I recommend\r\nthat all hospitals be authorized at once to receive and care for, without\r\nhospital pay, the veterans of all wars needing such care, whenever there\r\nare vacant beds, and that immediate steps be taken to enlarge and build new\r\nhospitals to serve all such cases.\r\n\r\nThe American Legion will present to the Congress a legislative program\r\ntoo extensive for detailed discussion here. It is a carefully matured plan.\r\nWhile some of it I do not favor, with much of it I am in hearty accord, and\r\nI recommend that a most painstaking effort be made to provide remedies for\r\nany defects in the administration of the present laws which their\r\nexperience has revealed. The attitude of the Government toward these\r\nproposals should be one of generosity. But I do not favor the granting of a\r\nbonus.\r\n\r\nCOAL\r\n\r\nThe cost of coal has become unbearably high. It places a great burden on\r\nour industrial and domestic life. The public welfare requires a reduction\r\nin the price of fuel. With the enormous deposits in existence, failure of\r\nsupply ought not to be tolerated. Those responsible for the conditions in\r\nthis industry should undertake its reform and free it from any charge of\r\nprofiteering.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Coal Commission will be before the Congress. It comprises\r\nall the facts. It represents the mature deliberations and conclusions of\r\nthe best talent and experience that ever made a national survey of the\r\nproduction and distribution of fuel. I do not favor Government ownership or\r\noperation of coal mines. The need is for action under private ownership\r\nthat will secure greater continuity of production and greater public\r\nprotection. The Federal Government probably has no peacetime authority to\r\nregulate wages, prices, or profits in coal at the mines or among dealers,\r\nbut by ascertaining and publishing facts it can exercise great influence.\r\n\r\nThe source of the difficulty in the bituminous coal fields is the\r\nintermittence of operation which causes great waste of both capital and\r\nlabor. That part of the report dealing with this problem has much\r\nsignificance, and is suggestive of necessary remedies. By amending, the car\r\nrules, by encouraging greater unity of ownership, and possibly by\r\npermitting common selling agents for limited districts on condition that\r\nthey accept adequate regulations and guarantee that competition between\r\ndistricts be unlimited, distribution, storage, and continuity ought to be\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe supply of coal must be constant. In case of its prospective\r\ninterruption, the President should have authority to appoint a commission\r\nempowered to deal with whatever emergency situation might arise, to aid\r\nconciliation and voluntary arbitration, to adjust any existing or\r\nthreatened controversy between the employer and the employee when\r\ncollective bargaining fails, and by controlling distribution to prevent\r\nprofiteering in this vital necessity. This legislation is exceedingly\r\nurgent, and essential to the exercise of national authority for the\r\nprotection of the people. Those who undertake the responsibility of\r\nmanagement or employment in this industry do so with the full knowledge\r\nthat the public interest is paramount, and that to fail through any motive\r\nof selfishness in its service is such a betrayal of duty as warrants\r\nuncompromising action by the Government.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nA special joint committee has been appointed to work out a plan for a\r\nreorganization of the different departments and bureaus of the Government\r\nmore scientific and economical than the present system. With the exception\r\nof the consolidation of the War and Navy Departments and some minor\r\ndetails, the plan has the general sanction of the President and the\r\nCabinet. It is important that reorganization be enacted into law at the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nAided by the sound principles adopted by the Government, the business of\r\nthe country has had an extraordinary revival. Looked at as a whole, the\r\nNation is in the enjoyment of remarkable prosperity. Industry and commerce\r\nare thriving. For the most tart agriculture is successful, eleven staples\r\nhaving risen in value from about $5,300,000,000 two years ago to about.\r\n$7,000,000,000 for the current year. But range cattle are still low in\r\nprice, and some sections of the wheat area, notably Minnesota, North\r\nDakota, and on west, have many cases of actual distress. With his products\r\nnot selling on a parity with the products of industry, every sound remedy\r\nthat can be devised should be applied for the relief of the farmer. He\r\nrepresents a character, a type of citizenship, and a public necessity that\r\nmust be preserved and afforded every facility for regaining prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe distress is most acute among those wholly dependent upon one crop..\r\nWheat acreage was greatly expanded and has not yet been sufficiently\r\nreduced. A large amount is raised for export, which has to meet the\r\ncompetition in the world market of large amounts raised on land much\r\ncheaper and much more productive.\r\n\r\nNo complicated scheme of relief, no plan for Government fixing of prices,\r\nno resort to the public Treasury will be of any permanent value in\r\nestablishing agriculture. Simple and direct methods put into operation by\r\nthe farmer himself are the only real sources for restoration.\r\n\r\nIndirectly the farmer must be relieved by a reduction of national and local\r\ntaxation. He must be assisted by the reorganization of the freight-rate\r\nstructure which could reduce charges on his production. To make this fully\r\neffective there ought to be railroad consolidations. Cheaper fertilizers\r\nmust be provided.\r\n\r\nHe must have organization. His customer with whom he exchanges products o\r\nhe farm for those of industry is organized, labor is organized, business is\r\norganized, and there is no way for agriculture to meet this unless it, too,\r\nis organized. The acreage of wheat is too large. Unless we can meet the\r\nworld market at a profit, we must stop raising for export. Organization\r\nwould help to reduce acreage. Systems of cooperative marketing created by\r\nthe farmers themselves, supervised by competent management, without doubt\r\nwould be of assistance, but, the can not wholly solve the problem. Our\r\nagricultural schools ought to have thorough courses in the theory of\r\norganization and cooperative marketing.\r\n\r\nDiversification is necessary. Those farmers who raise their living on their\r\nland are not greatly in distress. Such loans as are wisely needed to assist\r\nbuying stock and other materials to start in this direction should be\r\nfinanced through a Government agency as a temporary and emergency\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe remaining difficulty is the disposition of exportable wheat. I do not\r\nfavor the permanent interference of the Government in this problem. That\r\nprobably would increase the trouble by increasing production. But it seems\r\nfeasible to provide Government assistance to exports, and authority should\r\nbe given the War Finance Corporation to grant, in its discretion, the most\r\nliberal terms of payment for fats and grains exported for the direct\r\nbenefit of the farm.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nThe Government is undertaking to develop a great water-power project known\r\nas Muscle Shoals, on which it has expended many million dollars. The work\r\nis still going on. Subject to the right to retake in time of war, I\r\nrecommend that this property with a location for auxiliary steam plant and\r\nrights of way be sold. This would end the present burden of expense and\r\nshould return to the Treasury the largest price possible to secure.\r\n\r\nWhile the price is an important element, there is another consideration\r\neven more compelling. The agriculture of the Nation needs a greater supply\r\nand lower cost of fertilizer. This is now imported in large quantities. The\r\nbest information I can secure indicates that present methods of power\r\nproduction would not be able profitably to meet the price at which these\r\nimports can be sold. To obtain a supply from this water power would require\r\nlong and costly experimentation to perfect a process for cheap production.\r\nOtherwise our purpose would fail completely. It seems desirable, therefore,\r\nin order to protect and promote the public welfare, to have adequate\r\ncovenants that such experimentation be made and carried on to success. The\r\ngreat advantage of low-priced nitrates must be secured for the direct\r\nbenefit of the farmers and the indirect benefit of the public in time of\r\npeace, and of the Government in time of war. If this main object be\r\naccomplished, the amount of money received for the property is not a\r\nprimary or major consideration.\r\n\r\nSuch a solution will involve complicated negotiations, and there is no\r\nauthority for that purpose. I therefore recommend that the Congress\r\nappoint a small joint committee to consider offers, conduct negotiations,\r\nand report definite recommendations.\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION\r\n\r\nBy reason of many contributing causes, occupants of our reclamation\r\nprojects are in financial difficulties, which in some cases are acute.\r\nRelief should be granted by definite authority of law empowering the\r\nSecretary of the Interior in his discretion to suspend, readjust, and\r\nreassess all charges against water users. This whole question is being\r\nconsidered by experts. You will have the advantage of the facts and\r\nconclusions which they may develop. This situation, involving a Government\r\ninvestment of more than $135,000,000, and affecting more than 30,000 water\r\nusers, is serious. While relief which is necessary should be granted, yet\r\ncontracts with the Government which can be met should be met. The\r\nestablished general policy of these projects should not be abandoned for\r\nany private control.\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYS AND FORESTS\r\n\r\nHighways and reforestation should continue to have the interest and support\r\nof the Government. Everyone is anxious for good highways. I have made a\r\nliberal proposal in the Budget for the continuing payment to the States by\r\nthe Federal Government of its share for this necessary public improvement.\r\nNo expenditure of public money contributes so much to the national wealth\r\nas for building good roads.\r\n\r\nReforestation has an importance far above the attention it usually secures.\r\nA special committee of the Senate is investigating this need, and I shall\r\nwelcome a constructive policy based on their report.\r\n\r\nIt is 100 years since our country announced the Monroe doctrine. This\r\nprinciple has been ever since, and is now, one of the main foundations of\r\nour foreign relations. It must be maintained. But in maintaining it we must\r\nnot be forgetful that a great change has taken place. We are no longer a\r\nweak Nation, thinking mainly of defense, dreading foreign imposition. We\r\nare great and powerful. New powers bring new responsibilities. Our ditty\r\nthen was to protect ourselves. Added to that, our duty now is to help give\r\nstability to the world. We want idealism. We want that vision which lifts\r\nmen and nations above themselves. These are virtues by reason of their own\r\nmerit. But they must not be cloistered; they must not be impractical; they\r\nmust not be ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe world has had enough of the curse of hatred and selfishness, of\r\ndestruction and war. It has had enough of the wrongful use of material\r\npower. For the healing of the nations there must be good will and charity,\r\nconfidence and peace. The time has come for a more practical use of moral\r\npower, and more reliance upon the principle that right makes its own might.\r\nOur authority among the nations must be represented by justice and mercy.\r\nIt is necessary not only to have faith, but to make sacrifices for our\r\nfaith. The spiritual forces of the world make all its final determinations.\r\nIt is with these voices that America should speak. Whenever they declare a\r\nrighteous purpose there need be no doubt that they will be heard. America\r\nhas taken her place in the world as a Republic--free, independent,\r\npowerful. The best service that can be rendered to humanity is the\r\nassurance that this place will be maintained.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nCalvin Coolidge\r\nDecember 3, 1924\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nThe present state of the Union, upon which it is customary for the\r\nPresident to report to the Congress under the provisions of the\r\nConstitution, is such that it may be regarded with encouragement and\r\nsatisfaction by every American. Our country is almost unique in its ability\r\nto discharge fully and promptly all its obligations at home and abroad, and\r\nprovide for all its inhabitants an increase in material resources, in\r\nintellectual vigor and in moral power. The Nation holds a position\r\nunsurpassed in all former human experience. This does not mean that we do\r\nnot have any problems. It is elementary that the increasing breadth of our\r\nexperience necessarily increases the problems of our national life. But it\r\ndoes mean that if all will but apply ourselves industriously and honestly,\r\nwe have ample powers with which to meet our problems and provide for I heir\r\nspeedy solution. I do not profess that we can secure an era of perfection\r\nin human existence, but we can provide an era of peace and prosperity,\r\nattended with freedom and justice and made more and more satisfying by the\r\nministrations of the charities and humanities of life.\r\n\r\nOur domestic problems are for the most part economic. We have our enormous\r\ndebt to pay, and we are paying it. We have the high cost of government to\r\ndiminish, and we are diminishing it. We have a heavy burden of taxation to\r\nreduce, and we are reducing it. But while remarkable progress has been made\r\nin these directions, the work is yet far from accomplished. We still owe\r\nover $21,000,000,000, the cost of the National Government is still about\r\n$3,500,000,000, and the national taxes still amount to about $27 for each\r\none of our inhabitants. There yet exists this enormous field for the\r\napplication of economy.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the Government can do more to remedy the economic ills of the\r\npeople by a system of rigid economy in public expenditure than can be\r\naccomplished through any other action. The costs of our national and local\r\ngovernments combined now stand at a sum close to $100 for each inhabitant\r\nof the land. A little less than one-third of this is represented by\r\nnational expenditure, and a little more than two-thirds by local\r\nexpenditure. It is an ominous fact that only the National Government is\r\nreducing its debt. Others are increasing theirs at about $1,000,000,000\r\neach year. The depression that overtook business, the disaster experienced\r\nin agriculture, the lack of employment and the terrific shrinkage in all\r\nvalues which our country experienced in a most acute form in 1920, resulted\r\nin no small measure from the prohibitive taxes which were then levied on\r\nall productive effort. The establishment of a system of drastic economy in\r\npublic expenditure, which has enabled us to pay off about one-fifth of the\r\nnational debt since 1919, and almost cut in two the national tax burden\r\nsince 1921, has been one of the main causes in reestablishing a prosperity\r\nwhich has come to include within its benefits almost every one of our\r\ninhabitants. Economy reaches everywhere. It carries a blessing to\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nThe fallacy of the claim that the costs of government are borne by the rich\r\nand those who make a direct contribution to the National Treasury can not\r\nbe too often exposed. No system has been devised, I do not think any system\r\ncould be devised, under which any person living in this country could\r\nescape being affected by the cost of our government. It has a direct effect\r\nboth upon the rate and the purchasing power of wages. It is felt in the\r\nprice of those prime necessities of existence, food, clothing, fuel and\r\nshelter. It would appear to be elementary that the more the Government\r\nexpends the more it must require every producer to contribute out of his\r\nproduction to the Public Treasury, and the less he will have for his own\r\nbenefit. The continuing costs of public administration can be met in only\r\none way--by the work of the people. The higher they become, the more the\r\npeople must work for the Government. The less they are, the more the people\r\ncan work for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe present estimated margin between public receipts and expenditures for\r\nthis fiscal year is very small. Perhaps the most important work that this\r\nsession of the Congress can do is to continue a policy of economy and\r\nfurther reduce the cost of government, in order that we may have a\r\nreduction of taxes for the next fiscal year. Nothing is more likely to\r\nproduce that public confidence which is the forerunner and the mainstay of\r\nprosperity, encourage and enlarge business opportunity with ample\r\nopportunity for employment at good wages, provide a larger market for\r\nagricultural products, and put our country in a stronger position to be\r\nable to meet the world competition in trade, than a continuing policy of\r\neconomy. Of course necessary costs must be met, proper functions of the\r\nGovernment performed, and constant investments for capital account and\r\nreproductive effort must be carried on by our various departments. But the\r\npeople must know that their Government is placing upon them no unnecessary\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nTAXES\r\n\r\nEveryone desires a reduction of taxes, and there is a great preponderance\r\nof sentiment in favor of taxation reform. When I approved the present tax\r\nlaw, I stated publicly that I did so in spite of certain provisions which I\r\nbelieved unwise and harmful. One of the most glaring of these was the\r\nmaking public of the amounts assessed against different income-tax payers.\r\nAlthough that damage has now been done, I believe its continuation to be\r\ndetrimental To the public welfare and bound to decrease public revenues, so\r\nthat it ought to be repealed.\r\n\r\nAnybody can reduce taxes, but it is not so easy to stand in the gap and\r\nresist the passage of increasing appropriation bills which would make tax\r\nreduction impossible. It will be very easy to measure the strength of the\r\nattachment to reduced taxation by the power with which increased\r\nappropriations are resisted. If at the close of the present session the\r\nCongress has kept within the budget which I propose to present, it will\r\nthen be possible to have a moderate amount of tax reduction and all the tax\r\nreform that the Congress may wish for during the next fiscal year. The\r\ncountry is now feeling the direct stimulus which came from the passage of\r\nthe last revenue bill, and under the assurance of a reasonable system of\r\ntaxation there is every prospect of an era of prosperity of unprecedented\r\nproportions. But it would be idle to expect any such results unless\r\nbusiness can continue free from excess profits taxation and be accorded a\r\nsystem of surtaxes at rates which have for their object not the punishment\r\nof success or the discouragement of business, but the production of the\r\ngreatest amount of revenue from large incomes. I am convinced that the\r\nlarger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to the\r\nGovernment if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward.\r\nMoreover the effect of the present method of this taxation is to increase\r\nthe cost of interest on productive enterprise and to increase the burden\r\nof rent. It is altogether likely that such reduction would so encourage and\r\nstimulate investment that it would firmly establish our country in the\r\neconomic leadership of the world.\r\n\r\nWATERWAYS\r\n\r\nMeantime our internal development should go on. Provision should be made\r\nfor flood control of such rivers as the Mississippi and the Colorado, and\r\nfor the opening up of our inland waterways to commerce. Consideration is\r\ndue to the project of better navigation from the Great Lakes to the Gulf.\r\nEvery effort is being made to promote an agreement with Canada to build\r\nthe, St. Lawrence waterway. There are pending before the Congress bills for\r\nfurther development of the Mississippi Basin, for the taking over of the\r\nCape Cod Canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seems to have\r\nbeen incurred during the war, and for the improvement of harbors on both\r\nthe Pacific and the Atlantic coasts. While this last should be divested of\r\nsome of its projects and we must proceed slowly, these bills in general\r\nhave my approval. Such works are productive of wealth and in the long run\r\ntend to a reduction of the tax burden.\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION\r\n\r\nOur country has a well defined policy of reclamation established under\r\nstatutory authority. This policy should be continued and made a\r\nself-sustaining activity administered in a manner that will meet local\r\nrequirements and bring our and lands into a profitable state of cultivation\r\nas fast as there is a market for their products. Legislation is pending\r\nbased on the report of the Fact Finding Commission for the proper relief of\r\nthose needing extension of time in which to meet their payments on\r\nirrigated land, and for additional amendments and reforms of our\r\nreclamation laws, which are all exceedingly important and should be enacted\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nNo more important development has taken place in the last year than the\r\nbeginning of a restoration of agriculture to a prosperous condition. We\r\nmust permit no division of classes in this country, with one occupation\r\nstriving to secure advantage over another. Each must proceed under open\r\nopportunities and with a fair prospect of economic equality. The Government\r\ncan not successfully insure prosperity or fix prices by legislative fiat.\r\nEvery business has its risk and its times of depression. It is well known\r\nthat in the long run there will be a more even prosperity and a more\r\nsatisfactory range of prices under the natural working out of economic laws\r\nthan when the Government undertakes the artificial support of markets and\r\nindustries. Still we can so order our affairs, so protect our own people\r\nfrom foreign competition, so arrange our national finances, so administer\r\nour monetary system, so provide for the extension of credits, so improve\r\nmethods of distribution, as to provide a better working machinery for the\r\ntransaction of the business of the Nation with the least possible friction\r\nand loss. The Government has been constantly increasing its efforts in\r\nthese directions for the relief and permanent establishment of agriculture\r\non a sound and equal basis with other business.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the value of the crops for this harvest year may reach\r\n$13,000,000,000, which is an increase of over $3,000,000,000 in three\r\nyears. It compares with $7,100,000,000 in 1913, and if we make deduction\r\nfrom the figures of 1924 for the comparatively decreased value of the\r\ndollar, the yield this year still exceeds 1913 in purchasing power by over\r\n$1,000,000,000, and in this interval there has been no increase in the\r\nnumber of farmers. Mostly by his own effort the farmer has decreased the\r\ncost of production. A marked increase in the price of his products and some\r\ndecrease in the price of his supplies has brought him about to a parity\r\nwith the rest of the Nation. The crop area of this season is estimated at\r\n370,000,000 acres, which is a decline of 3,000,000 acres from last year,\r\nand 6,000,000 acres from 1919. This has been a normal and natural\r\napplication of economic laws, which has placed agriculture on a foundation\r\nwhich is undeniably sound and beginning to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA decrease in the world supply of wheat has resulted in a very large\r\nincrease in the price of that commodity. The position of all agricultural\r\nproducts indicates a better balanced supply, but we can not yet conclude\r\nthat agriculture is recovered from the effects of the war period or that it\r\nis permanently on a prosperous basis. The cattle industry has not yet\r\nrecovered and in some sections has been suffering from dry weather. Every\r\neffort must be made both by Government activity and by private agencies to\r\nrestore and maintain agriculture to a complete normal relationship with\r\nother industries.\r\n\r\nIt was on account of past depression, and in spite of present more\r\nencouraging conditions, that I have assembled an Agricultural Conference\r\nmade up of those who are representative of this great industry in both its\r\noperating and economic sides. Everyone knows that the great need of the\r\nfarmers is markets. The country is not suffering on the side of production.\r\nAlmost the entire difficulty is on the side of distribution. This reaches\r\nback, of course, to unit costs and diversification, and many allied\r\nsubjects. It is exceedingly intricate, for our domestic and foreign trade,\r\ntransportation and banking, and in fact our entire economic system, are\r\nclosely related to it. In time for action at this session, I hope to report\r\nto the Congress such legislative remedies as the conference may recommend.\r\nAn appropriation should be made to defray their necessary expenses.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nThe production of nitrogen for plant food in peace and explosives in war is\r\nmore and more important. It is one of the chief sustaining elements of\r\nlife. It is estimated that soil exhaustion each year is represented by\r\nabout 9,000,000 tons and replenishment by 5,450,000 tons. The deficit of\r\n3,550,000 tons is reported to represent the impairment of 118,000,000 acres\r\nof farm lands each year.\r\n\r\nTo meet these necessities the Government has been developing a water power\r\nproject at Muscle Shoals to be equipped to produce nitrogen for explosives\r\nand fertilizer. It is my opinion that the support of agriculture is the\r\nchief problem to consider in connection with this property. It could by no\r\nmeans supply the present needs for nitrogen, but it would help and its\r\ndevelopment would encourage bringing other water powers into like use.\r\n\r\nSeveral offers have been made for the purchase of this property. Probably\r\nnone of them represent final terms. Much costly experimentation is\r\nnecessary to produce commercial nitrogen. For that reason it is a field\r\nbetter suited to private enterprise than to Government operation. I should\r\nfavor a sale of this property, or long-time lease, tinder rigid guaranties\r\nof commercial nitrogen production at reasonable prices for agricultural\r\nuse. There would be a surplus of power for many years over any possibility\r\nof its application to a developing manufacture of nitrogen. It may be found\r\nadvantageous to dispose of the right to surplus power separately with such\r\nreservations as will allow its gradual withdrawal and application to\r\nnitrogen manufacture. A subcommittee of the Committees on Agriculture\r\nshould investigate this field and negotiate with prospective purchasers. If\r\nno advantageous offer be made, the development should continue and the\r\nplant should be dedicated primarily to the production of materials for the\r\nfertilization of the soil.\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThe railways during the past year have made still further progress in\r\nrecuperation from the war, with large rains in efficiency and ability\r\nexpeditiously to handle the traffic of the country. We have now passed\r\nthrough several periods of peak traffic without the car shortages which so\r\nfrequently in the past have brought havoc to our agriculture and\r\nindustries. The condition of many of our great freight terminals is still\r\none of difficulty and results in imposing, large costs on the public for\r\ninward-bound freight, and on the railways for outward-bound freight. Owing\r\nto the growth of our large cities and the great increase in the volume of\r\ntraffic, particularly in perishables, the problem is not only difficult of\r\nsolution, but in some cases not wholly solvable by railway action alone.\r\n\r\nIn my message last year I emphasized the necessity for further legislation\r\nwith a view to expediting the consolidation of our rail ways into larger\r\nsystems. The principle of Government control of rates and profits, now\r\nthoroughly imbedded in our governmental attitude toward natural monopolies\r\nsuch as the railways, at once eliminates the need of competition by small\r\nunits as a method of rate adjustment. Competition must be preserved as a\r\nstimulus to service, but this will exist and can be increased tinder\r\nenlarged systems. Consequently the consolidation of the railways into\r\nlarger units for the purpose of securing the substantial values to the\r\npublic which will come from larger operation has been the logical\r\nconclusion of Congress in its previous enactments, and is also supported by\r\nthe best opinion in the country. Such consolidation will assure not only a\r\ngreater element of competition as to service, but it will afford economy in\r\noperation, greater stability in railway earnings, and more economical\r\nfinancing. It opens large possibilities of better equalization of rates\r\nbetween different classes of traffic so as to relieve undue burdens upon\r\nagricultural products and raw materials generally, which are now not\r\npossible without ruin to small units owing to the lack of diversity of\r\ntraffic. It would also tend to equalize earnings in such fashion as to\r\nreduce the importance of section 15A, at which criticism, often misapplied,\r\nhas been directed. A smaller number of units would offer less difficulties\r\nin labor adjustments and would contribute much to the, solution of terminal\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe consolidations need to be carried out with due regard to public\r\ninterest and to the rights and established life of various communities in\r\nour country. It does not seem to me necessary that we endeavor to\r\nanticipate any final plan or adhere to an artificial and unchangeable\r\nproject which shall stipulate a fixed number of systems, but rather we\r\nought to approach the problem with such a latitude of action that it can be\r\nworked out step by step in accordance with a comprehensive consideration of\r\npublic interest. Whether the number of ultimate systems shall be more or\r\nless seems to me can only be determined by time and actual experience in\r\nthe development of such consolidations.\r\n\r\nThose portions of the present law contemplating consolidations ore not,\r\nsufficiently effective in producing expeditious action and need\r\namplification of the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nparticularly in affording a period for voluntary proposals to the\r\ncommission and in supplying Government pressure to secure action after the\r\nexpiration of such a period.\r\n\r\nThere are other proposals before Congress for amending the transportation\r\nacts. One of these contemplates a revision of the method of valuation for\r\nrate-making purposes to be followed by a renewed valuation of the railways.\r\nThe valuations instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission 10 years\r\nago have not yet been completed. They have cost the Government an enormous\r\nsum, and they have imposed great expenditure upon the railways, most of\r\nwhich has in effect come out of the public in increased rates. This work\r\nshould not be abandoned or supplanted until its results are known and can\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nAnother matter before the Congress is legislation affecting the labor\r\nsections of the transportation act. Much criticism has been directed at the\r\nworkings of this section and experience has shown that some useful\r\namendment could be made to these provisions.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if a plan could be adopted which, while retaining the\r\npractice of systematic collective bargaining with conciliation voluntary\r\narbitration of labor differences, could also provide simplicity in\r\nrelations and more direct local responsibility of employees and managers.\r\nBut such legislation will not meet the requirements of the situation unless\r\nit recognizes the principle that t e public has a right to the\r\nuninterrupted service of transportation, and therefore a right to be heard\r\nwhen there is danger that the Nation may suffer great injury through the\r\ninterruption of operations because of labor disputes. If these elements are\r\nnot comprehended in proposed legislation, it would be better to gain\r\nfurther experience with the present organization for dealing with these\r\nquestions before undertaking a change.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING BOARD\r\n\r\nThe form of the organization of the Shipping Board was based originally on\r\nits functions as a semi judicial body in regulation of rates. During the\r\nwar it was loaded with enormous administrative duties. It has been\r\ndemonstrated time and again that this form of organization results in\r\nindecision, division of opinion and administrative functions, which make a\r\nwholly inadequate foundation for the conduct of a great business\r\nenterprise. The first principle in securing the objective set out by\r\nCongress in building up the American merchant marine upon the great trade\r\nroutes and subsequently disposing of it into private operation can not\r\nproceed with effectiveness until the entire functions of the board are\r\nreorganized. The immediate requirement is to transfer into the Emergency\r\nFleet, Corporation the whole responsibility of operation of the fleet and\r\nother property, leaving to the Shipping Board solely the duty of\r\ndetermining certain major policies which require deliberative action.\r\n\r\nThe procedure under section 28 of the merchant marine act has created great\r\ndifficulty and threatened friction during the past 12 months. Its attempted\r\napplication developed not only great opposition from exporters,\r\nparticularly as to burdens that may be imposed upon agricultural products,\r\nbut also great anxiety in the different seaports as to the effect upon\r\ntheir relative rate structures. This trouble will certainly recur if action\r\nis attempted under this section. It is uncertain in some of its terms and\r\nof great difficulty in interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that action under this section should be suspended until\r\nthe Congress can reconsider the entire question in the light of the\r\nexperience that has been developed since its enactment.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL ELECTIONS\r\n\r\nNothing is so fundamental to the integrity of a republican form of\r\ngovernment as honesty in all that relates to the conduct of elections. I am\r\nof the opinion that the national laws governing the choice of members of\r\nthe Congress should be extended to include appropriate representation of\r\nthe respective parties at the ballot box ant equality of representation on\r\nthe various registration boards, wherever they exist.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIARY\r\n\r\nThe docket of the Supreme Court is becoming congested. At the opening term\r\nlast year it had 592 cases, while this year it had 687 cases. Justice long\r\ndelayed is justice refused. Unless the court be given power by preliminary\r\nand summary consideration to determine the importance of cases, and by\r\ndisposing of those which are not of public moment reserve its time for the\r\nmore extended consideration of the remainder, the congestion of the docket\r\nis likely to increase. It is also desirable that Supreme Court should have\r\npower to improve and reform procedure in suits at law in the Federal courts\r\nthrough the adoption of appropriate rules. The Judiciary Committee of the\r\nSenate has reported favorably upon two bills providing for these reforms\r\nwhich should have the immediate favorable consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nI further recommend that provision be made for the appointment of a\r\ncommission, to consist of two or three members of the Federal judiciary and\r\nas many members of the bar, to examine the present criminal code of\r\nprocedure and recommend to the Congress measures which may reform and\r\nexpedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of our\r\ncriminal laws.\r\n\r\nPRISON REFORM\r\n\r\nPending before the Congress is a bill which has already passed one House\r\nproviding for a reformatory to which could be committed first offenders and\r\nyoung men for the purpose of segregating them from contact with banned\r\ncriminals and providing them with special training in order to reestablish\r\nin them the power to pursue a law-abiding existence in the social and\r\neconomic life of the Nation. This is a matter of so much importance as to\r\nwarrant the early attention of the present session. Further provision\r\nshould also be made, for a like reason, for a separate reformatory for\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL POLICE BUREAU\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the International Police Conference will bring to t e\r\nattention of the Congress a proposal for the establishment of a national\r\npolice bureau. Such action would provide a central point for gathering,\r\ncompiling, and later distributing to local police authorities much\r\ninformation which would be helpful in the prevention and detection of\r\ncrime. I believe this bureau is needed, and I recommend favorable\r\nconsideration of this proposal.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WELFARE\r\n\r\nThe welfare work of the District of Columbia is administered by several\r\ndifferent boards dealing with charities and various correctional efforts.\r\nIt would be an improvement if this work were consolidated and placed under\r\nthe direction of a single commission.\r\n\r\nFRENCH SPOLIATION CLAIMS\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of the Congress legislation was introduced looking\r\nto the payment of the remaining claims generally referred to as the French\r\nspoliation claims. The Congress has provided for the payment of many\r\nsimilar claims. Those that remain unpaid have been long pending. The\r\nbeneficiaries thereunder have every reason to expect payment. These claims\r\nhave been examined by the Court of Claims and their validity and amount\r\ndetermined. The United States ought to pay its debts. I recommend action by\r\nthe Congress which will permit of the payment of these remaining claims.\r\n\r\nTHE WAGE EARNER\r\n\r\nTwo very important policies have been adopted by this country which, while\r\nextending their benefits also in other directions, have been of the utmost\r\nimportance to the wage earners. One of these is the protective tariff,\r\nwhich enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive\r\na better rate of compensation than any people, any time, anywhere on earth,\r\never enjoyed. This saves the American market for the products of the\r\nAmerican workmen. The other is a policy of more recent origin and seeks to\r\nshield our wage earners from the disastrous competition of a great influx\r\nof foreign peoples. This has been done by the restrictive immigration law.\r\nThis saves the American job for the American workmen. I should like to see\r\nthe administrative features of this law rendered a little more humane for\r\nthe purpose of permitting those already here a greater latitude in securing\r\nadmission of members of their own families. But I believe this law in\r\nprinciple is necessary and sound, and destined to increase greatly the\r\npublic welfare. We must maintain our own economic position, we must defend\r\nour own national integrity.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to report that the progress of industry, the enormous\r\nincrease in individual productivity through labor-saving devices, and the\r\nhigh rate of wages have all combined to furnish our people in general with\r\nsuch an abundance not only of the necessaries but of the conveniences of\r\nlife that we are by a natural evolution solving our problems of economic\r\nand social justice.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO\r\n\r\nThese developments have brought about a very remarkable improvement in the\r\ncondition of the negro race. Gradually, but surely, with the almost\r\nuniversal sympathy of those among whom they live, the colored people are\r\nworking out their own destiny. I firmly believe that it is better for all\r\nconcerned that they should be cheerfully accorded their full constitutional\r\nrights, that they should be protected from all of those impositions to\r\nwhich, from their position, they naturally fall a prey, especially from the\r\ncrime of lynching and that they should receive every encouragement to\r\nbecome full partakers in all the blessings of our common American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe merit system has long been recognized as the correct basis for\r\nemployment in our, civil service. I believe that first second, and third\r\nclass postmasters, and without covering in the present membership the\r\nfield force of prohibition enforcement, should be brought within the\r\nclassified service by statute law. Otherwise the Executive order of one\r\nadministration is changed by the Executive order of another administration,\r\nand little real progress is made. Whatever its defects, the merit system is\r\ncertainly to be preferred to the spoils system.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nOne way to save public money would be to pass the pending bill for the\r\nreorganization of the various departments. This project has been pending\r\nfor some time, and has had the most careful consideration of experts and\r\nthe thorough study of a special congressional committee. This legislation\r\nis vital as a companion piece to the Budget law. Legal authority for a\r\nthorough reorganization of the Federal structure with some latitude of\r\naction to the Executive in the rearrangement of secondary functions would\r\nmake for continuing economy in the shift of government activities which\r\nmust follow every change in a developing country. Beyond this many of the\r\nindependent agencies of the Government must be placed under responsible\r\nCabinet officials, if we are to have safeguards of efficiency, economy, and\r\nprobity.\r\n\r\nARMY AND NAVY\r\n\r\nLittle has developed in relation to our national defense which needs\r\nspecial attention. Progress is constantly being made in air navigation and\r\nrequires encouragement and development. Army aviators have made a\r\nsuccessful trip around the world, for which I recommend suitable\r\nrecognition through provisions for promotion, compensation, and retirement.\r\nUnder the direction of the Navy a new Zeppelin has been successfully\r\nbrought from Europe across the Atlantic to our own country.\r\n\r\nDue to the efficient supervision of the Secretary of War the Army of the\r\nUnited States has been organized with a small body of Regulars and a\r\nmoderate National Guard and Reserve. The defense test of September 12\r\ndemonstrated the efficiency of the operating plans. These methods and\r\noperations are well worthy of congressional support.\r\n\r\nUnder the limitation of armaments treaty a large saving in outlay and a\r\nconsiderable decrease in maintenance of the Navy has been accomplished. We\r\nshould maintain the policy of constantly working toward the full treaty\r\nstrength of the Navy. Careful investigation is being made in this\r\ndepartment of the relative importance of aircraft, surface and submarine\r\nvessels, in order that we may not fail to take advantage of all modern\r\nimprovements for our national defense. A special commission also is\r\ninvestigating the problem of petroleum oil for the Navy, considering the\r\nbest policy to insure the future supply of fuel oil and prevent the\r\nthreatened drainage of naval oil reserves. Legislative action is required\r\nto carry on experiments in oil shale reduction, as large deposits of this\r\ntype have been set aside for the use of the Navy.\r\n\r\nWe have been constantly besought to engage in competitive armaments.\r\nFrequent reports will reach us of the magnitude of the military equipment\r\nof other, nations. We shall do well to be little impressed by such reports\r\nor such actions. Any nation undertaking to maintain a military\r\nestablishment with aggressive and imperialistic designs will find itself\r\nseverely handicapped in the economic development of the world. I believe\r\nthoroughly in the Army and Navy, in adequate defense and preparation. But I\r\nam opposed to any policy of competition in building and maintaining land or\r\nsea armaments.\r\n\r\nOur country has definitely relinquished the old standard of dealing with\r\nother countries by terror and force, and is definitely committed to the new\r\nstandard of dealing with them through friendship and understanding. This\r\nnew policy should be constantly kept in mind by the guiding forces of the\r\nArmy and Navy, by the. Congress and by the country at large. I believe it\r\nholds a promise of great benefit to humanity. I shall resist any attempt to\r\nresort to the old methods and the old standards. I am especially solicitous\r\nthat foreign nations should comprehend the candor and sincerity with which\r\nwe have adopted this position. While we propose to maintain defensive and\r\nsupplementary police forces by land and sea, and to train them through\r\ninspections and maneuvers upon appropriate occasions in order to maintain\r\ntheir efficiency, I wish every other nation to understand that this does\r\nnot express any unfriendliness or convey any hostile intent. I want the\r\narmed forces of America to be considered by all peoples not as enemies but\r\nas friends as the contribution which is made by this country for the\r\nmaintenance of the peace and security of the world.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nWith the authorization for general hospitalization of the veterans of all\r\nwars provided during the present year, the care and treatment of those who\r\nhave served their country in time of peril and the attitude of the\r\nGovernment toward them is not now so much one of needed legislation as one\r\nof careful, generous and humane administration. It will ever be recognized\r\nthat their welfare is of the first concern and always entitled to the most\r\nsolicitous consideration oil the part of their fellow citizens. They are\r\norganized in various associations, of which the chief and most\r\nrepresentative is the American Legion. Through its officers the Legion will\r\npresent to the Congress numerous suggestions for legislation. They cover\r\nsuch a wide variety of subjects that it is impossible to discuss them\r\nwithin the scope of this message. With many of the proposals I join in\r\nhearty approval and commend them all to the sympathetic investigation and\r\nconsideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nAt no period in the past 12 years have our foreign relations been in such a\r\nsatisfactory condition as they are at the present time. Our actions in the\r\nrecent months have greatly strengthened the American policy of permanent\r\npeace with independence. The attitude which our Government took and\r\nmaintained toward an adjustment of European reparations, by pointing out\r\nthat it wits not a political but a business problem, has demonstrated its\r\nwisdom by its actual results. We desire to see Europe restored that it may\r\nresume its productivity in the increase of industry and its support in the\r\nadvance of civilization. We look with great gratification at the hopeful\r\nprospect of recuperation in Europe through the Dawes plan. Such assistance\r\nas can be given through the action of the public authorities and of our\r\nprivate citizens, through friendly counsel and cooperation, and through\r\neconomic and financial support, not for any warlike effort but for\r\nreproductive enterprise, not to provide means for unsound government\r\nfinancing but to establish sound business administration should be\r\nunhesitatingly provided.\r\n\r\nUltimately nations, like individuals, can not depend upon each other but\r\nmust depend upon themselves. Each one must work out its own salvation. We\r\nhave every desire to help. But with all our resources we are powerless to\r\nsave unless our efforts meet with a constructive response. The situation in\r\nour own country and all over the world is one Chat can be improved only by\r\nbard work and self-denial. It is necessary to reduce expenditures, increase\r\nsavings and liquidate debts. It is in this direction that there lies the\r\ngreatest hope of domestic tranquility and international peace. Our own\r\ncountry ought to finish the leading example in this effort. Our past\r\nadherence to this policy, our constant refusal to maintain a military\r\nestablishment that could be thought to menace the security of others, our\r\nhonorable dealings with other nations whether great or small, has left us\r\nin the almost constant enjoyment of peace.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to stress the general desire of all the people of this\r\ncountry for the promotion of peace. It is the leading principle of all our\r\nforeign relations. We have on every occasion tried to cooperate to this end\r\nin all ways that were consistent with our proper independence and our\r\ntraditional policies. It will be my constant effort to maintain these\r\nprinciples, and to reinforce them by all appropriate agreements and\r\ntreaties. While we desire always to cooperate and to help, we are equally\r\ndetermined to be independent and free. Right and truth and justice and\r\nhumanitarian efforts will have the moral support of this country all over\r\nthe world. But we do not wish to become involved in the political\r\ncontroversies of others. Nor is the country disposed to become a member of\r\nthe League of Nations or to assume the obligations imposed by its\r\ncovenant.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL COURT\r\n\r\nAmerica has been one of the foremost nations in advocating tribunals for\r\nthe settlement of international disputes of a justiciable character. Our\r\nrepresentatives took a leading in those conferences which resulted in the\r\nestablishment of e ague Tribunal, and later in providing for a Permanent\r\nCourt of International Justice. I believe it would be for the advantage of\r\nthis country and helpful to the stability of other nations for us to adhere\r\nto the protocol establishing, that court upon the conditions stated in the\r\nrecommendation which is now before the Senate, and further that our country\r\nshall not be bound by advisory opinions which may be, rendered by the court\r\nupon questions which we have not voluntarily submitted for its judgment.\r\nThis court would provide a practical and convenient tribunal before which\r\nwe could go voluntarily, but to which we could not be summoned, for a\r\ndetermination of justiciable questions when they fail to be resolved by\r\ndiplomatic negotiations.\r\n\r\nDISARMAMENT CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nMany times I have expressed my desire to see the work of the Washington\r\nConference on Limitation of Armaments appropriately supplemented by further\r\nagreements for a further reduction M for the purpose of diminishing the\r\nmenace and waste of the competition in preparing instruments of\r\ninternational war. It has been and is my expectation that we might\r\nhopefully approach other great powers for further conference on this\r\nsubject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as the\r\nestablished and settled policy of Europe has created a favorable\r\nopportunity. But on account of proposals which have already been made by\r\nother governments for a European conference, it will be necessary to wait\r\nto see what the outcome of their actions may be. I should not wish to\r\npropose or have representatives attend a conference which would contemplate\r\ncommitments opposed to the freedom of action we desire to maintain\r\nunimpaired with respect to our purely domestic policies.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL LAW\r\n\r\nOur country should also support efforts which are being made toward the\r\ncodification of international law. We can look more hopefully, in the first\r\ninstance, for research and studies that are likely to be productive of\r\nresults, to a cooperation among representatives of the bar and members of\r\ninternational law institutes and societies, than to a conference of those\r\nwho are technically representative of their respective governments,\r\nalthough, when projects have been developed, they must go to the\r\ngovernments for their approval. These expert professional studies are going\r\non in certain quarters and should have our constant encouragement and\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nOUTLAW OF WAR\r\n\r\nMuch interest has of late been manifested in this country in the discussion\r\nof various proposals to outlaw aggressive war. I look with great sympathy\r\nupon the examination of this subject. It is in harmony with the traditional\r\npolicy of our country, which is against aggressive war and for the\r\nmaintenance of permanent and honorable peace. While, as I have said, we\r\nmust safeguard our liberty to deal according to our own judgment with our\r\ndomestic policies, we can not fail to view with sympathetic interest all\r\nprogress to this desired end or carefully to study the measures that may be\r\nproposed to attain it.\r\n\r\nLATIN AMERICA\r\n\r\nWhile we are desirous of promoting peace in every quarter of the globe, we\r\nhave a special interest in the peace of this hemisphere. It is our constant\r\ndesire that all causes of dispute in this area may be tranquilly and\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted. Along with our desire for peace is the earnest\r\nhope for the increased prosperity of our sister republics of Latin America,\r\nand our constant purpose to promote cooperation with them which may be\r\nmutually beneficial and always inspired by the most cordial friendships.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN DEBTS\r\n\r\nAbout $12,000,000,000 is due to our Government from abroad, mostly from\r\nEuropean Governments. Great Britain, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania and Poland\r\nhave negotiated settlements amounting close to $5,000,000,000. This\r\nrepresents the funding of over 42 per cent of the debt since the creation\r\nof the special Foreign Debt Commission. As the life of this commission is\r\nabout to expire, its term should be extended. I am opposed to the\r\ncancellation of these debts and believe it for the best welfare of the\r\nworld that they should be liquidated and paid as fast as possible. I do not\r\nfavor oppressive measures, but unless money that is borrowed is repaid\r\ncredit can not be secured in time of necessity, and there exists besides a\r\nmoral obligation which our country can not ignore and no other country can\r\nevade. Terms and conditions may have to conform to differences in the\r\nfinancial abilities of the countries concerned, but the principle that each\r\ncountry should meet its obligation admits of no differences and is of\r\nuniversal application.\r\n\r\nIt is axiomatic that our country can not stand still. It would seem to be\r\nperfectly plain from recent events that it is determined to go forward. But\r\nit wants no pretenses, it wants no vagaries. It is determined to advance in\r\nan orderly, sound and common-sense way. It does not propose to abandon the\r\ntheory of the Declaration that the people have inalienable rights which no\r\nmajority and no power of government can destroy. It does not propose to\r\nabandon the practice of the Constitution that provides for the protection\r\nof these rights. It believes that within these limitations, which are\r\nimposed not by the fiat of man but by the law of the Creator,\r\nself-government is just and wise. It is convinced that it will be\r\nimpossible for the people to provide their own government unless they\r\ncontinue to own their own property.\r\n\r\nThese are the very foundations of America. On them has been erected a\r\nGovernment of freedom and equality, of justice and mercy, of education and\r\ncharity. Living under it and supporting it the people have come into great\r\npossessions on the material and spiritual sides of life. I want to continue\r\nin this direction. I know that the Congress shares with me that desire. I\r\nwant our institutions to be more and more expressive of these principles. I\r\nwant the people of all the earth to see in the American flag the symbol of\r\na Government which intends no oppression at home and no aggression abroad,\r\nwhich in the spirit of a common brotherhood provides assistance in time of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nCalvin Coolidge\r\nDecember 8, 1925\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congress:\r\n\r\nIn meeting the constitutional requirement of informing the Congress upon\r\nthe state of the Union, it is exceedingly gratifying to report that the\r\ngeneral condition is one of progress and prosperity. Here and there are\r\ncomparatively small and apparently temporary difficulties needing\r\nadjustment and improved administrative methods, such as are always to be\r\nexpected, but in the fundamentals of government and business the results\r\ndemonstrate that we are going in the right direction. The country does not\r\nappear to require radical departures from the policies already adopted so\r\nmuch as it needs a further extension of these policies and the improvement\r\nof details. The age of perfection is still in the somewhat distant future,\r\nbut it is more in danger of being retarded by mistaken Government activity\r\nthan it is from lack of legislation. We are by far the most likely to\r\naccomplish permanent good if we proceed with moderation.\r\n\r\nIn our country the people are sovereign and independent, and must accept\r\nthe resulting responsibilities. It is their duty to support themselves and\r\nsupport the Government. That is the business of the Nation, whatever the\r\ncharity of the Nation may require. The functions which the Congress are to\r\ndischarge are not those of local government but of National Government. The\r\ngreatest solicitude should be exercised to prevent any encroachment upon\r\nthe rights of the States or their various political subdivisions. Local\r\nself-government is one of our most precious possessions. It is the greatest\r\ncontributing factor to the stability strength liberty, and progress of the\r\nNation. It ought not to be in ringed by assault or undermined by purchase.\r\nIt ought not to abdicate its power through weakness or resign its authority\r\nthrough favor. It does not at all follow that because abuses exist it is\r\nthe concern of the Federal Government to attempt the r reform.\r\n\r\nSociety is in much more danger from encumbering the National Government\r\nbeyond its wisdom to comprehend, or its ability to administer, than from\r\nleaving the local communities to bear their own burdens and remedy their\r\nown evils. Our local habit and custom is so strong, our variety of race and\r\ncreed is so great the Federal authority is so tenuous, that the area within\r\nwhich it can function successfully is very limited. The wiser policy is to\r\nleave the localities, so far as we can, possessed of their own sources of\r\nrevenue and charged with their own obligations.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT ECONOMY\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental principle of our country that the people are sovereign.\r\nWhile they recognize the undeniable authority of the state, they have\r\nestablished as its instrument a Government of limited powers. They hold\r\ninviolate in their own hands the jurisdiction over their own freedom and\r\nthe ownership of their own property. Neither of these can be impaired\r\nexcept by due process of law. The wealth of our country is not public\r\nwealth, but private wealth. It does not belong to the Government, it\r\nbelongs to the people. The Government has no justification in taking\r\nprivate Property except for a public purpose. It is always necessary to\r\nkeep these principles in mind in the laying of taxes and in the making of\r\nappropriations. No right exists to levy on a dollar, or to order the\r\nexpenditure of a dollar, of the money of the people, except for a necessary\r\npublic purpose duly authorized by the Constitution. The power over the\r\npurse is the power over liberty.\r\n\r\nThat is the legal limitation within which the Congress can act, How it\r\nwill, proceed within this limitation is always a question of policy. When\r\nthe country is prosperous and free from debt, when the rate of taxation is\r\nlow, opportunity exists for assuming new burdens and undertaking new\r\nenterprises. Such a condition now prevails only to a limited extent. All\r\nproposals for assuming new obligations ought to be postponed, unless they\r\nare reproductive capital investments or are such as are absolutely\r\nnecessary at this time. We still have an enormous debt of over\r\n$20,000,000,000, on which the interest and sinking-fund requirements are\r\n$1,320,000,000. Our appropriations for the Pension Office and the Veterans'\r\nBureau are $600,000,000. The War and Navy Departments call for\r\n$642,000,000. Other requirements, exclusive of the Post Office which is\r\nvirtually self-sustaining, brought the appropriations for the current year\r\nup to almost $3,100,060,000. This shows an expenditure of close to $30 for\r\nevery inhabitant of our country. For the average family of five it means a\r\ntax, directly or indirectly paid, of about $150 for national purposes\r\nalone. The local tax adds much more. These enormous expenditures ought not\r\nto be increased, but through every possible effort they ought to be\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nOnly one of these great items can be ultimately extinguished. That is the\r\nitem of our war debt. Already this has been reduced to about\r\n$6,000,000,000, which means an annual saving in interest of close to\r\n$250,000,000. The present interest charge is about $820,000,000 yearly. It\r\nwould seem to be obvious that the sooner this debt can be retired the more\r\nthe taxpayers will save in interest and the easier it will be to secure\r\nfunds with which to prosecute needed running expenses, constructions, and\r\nimprovements. This item of $820,000,000 for interest is a heavy charge on\r\nall the people of the country, and it seems to me that we might well\r\nconsider whether it is not greatly worth while to dispense with it as early\r\nas possible by retiring the principal debt which it is required to serve.\r\n\r\nIt has always been our policy to retire our debts. That of the\r\nRevolutionary War period, notwithstanding the additions made in 1812, was\r\npaid by 1835. and the Civil War debt within 23 years. Of the amount already\r\npaid, over $1,000,000,000 is a reduction in cash balances. That source is\r\nexhausted. Over one and two-thirds billions of dollars was derived from\r\nexcess receipts. Tax reduction eliminates that. The sale of surplus war\r\nmaterials has been another element of our income. That is practically\r\nfinished. With these eliminated, the reduction of the debt has been only\r\nabout $500,000,000 each year, not an excessive sum on so large a debt.\r\n\r\nProposals have been made to extend the payment over a period of 62 years.\r\nIf $1,000,000,000 is paid at the end of 20 years, the cost to the taxpayers\r\nis the principal and, if the interest is 4% per cent, a total of\r\n$1,850,000,000. If the same sum is paid at the end of 62 years, the cost is\r\n$3,635,000,000, or almost double. Here is another consideration: Compared\r\nwith its purchasing power in 1913, the dollar we borrowed represented but\r\n52 cents. As the value of our dollar increases, due to the falling prices\r\nof commodities, the burden of our debt increases. It has now risen to 631/2\r\ncents. The taxpayer will be required to produce nearly twice the amount of\r\ncommodities to pay his debt if the dollar returns to the 1913 value. The\r\nmore we pay while prices are high, the easier it will be.\r\n\r\nDeflation of government after a war period is slower than deflation of\r\nbusiness, where curtailment is either prompt and effective or disaster\r\nfollows. There is room for further economy in the cost of the Federal\r\nGovernment, but a co n of current expenditures with pre-war expenditures is\r\nnot able to the efficiency with which Government business is now being\r\ndone. The expenditures of 19161 the last pre-war year, were $742,000,000,\r\nand in 1925 over $3,500,000,000, or nearly five times as great. If we\r\nsubtract expenditures for debt retirements and interest, veterans' relief,\r\nincrease of pensions, and other special outlays, consisting of refunds,\r\ntrust investments, and like charges, we find that the general expenditures\r\nof the Government in 1925 were slightly more than twice as large as in\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nAs prices in 1925 were approximately 40 per cent higher than in 1916, the\r\ncost of the same Government must also have increased. But the Government is\r\nnot the same. It is more expensive to collect the much greater revenue\r\nnecessary and to administer our great debt. We have given enlarged and\r\nimproved services to agriculture and commerce. Above all, America has grown\r\nin population and wealth. Government expenditures must always share in\r\nthis growth. Taking into account the factors I have mentioned, I believe\r\nthat present Federal expenses are not far out of line with pre-war\r\nexpenses. We have nearly accomplished the deflation.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that further economies will not come. As we reduce our\r\ndebt our interest charges decline. There are many details yet to correct.\r\nThe real improvement, however, must come not from additional curtailment of\r\nexpenses, but by a more intelligent, more ordered spending. Our economy\r\nmust be constructive. While we should avoid as far as possible increases in\r\npermanent current expenditures, oftentimes a capital outlay like internal\r\nimprovements will result in actual constructive saving. That is economy in\r\nits best sense. It is an avoidance of waste that there may be the means for\r\nan outlay to-day which will bring larger returns to-morrow. We should\r\nconstantly engage in scientific studies of our future requirements and\r\nadopt an orderly program for their service. Economy is the method by which\r\nwe prepare to-day to afford the improvements of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nA mere policy of economy without any instrumentalities for putting it into\r\noperation would be very ineffective. The Congress has wisely set up the\r\nBureau of the Budget to investigate and inform the President what\r\nrecommendations he ought to make for current appropriations. This gives a\r\ncentralized authority where a general and comprehensive understanding can\r\nbe reached of the sources of income and the most equitable distribution of\r\nexpenditures. How well it has worked is indicated by the fact that the\r\ndepartmental estimates for 1922, before the budget law, were $4,068,000,000\r\nwhile the Budget estimates for 1927 are $3,156,000,000. This latter figure\r\nshows the reductions in departmental estimates for the coming year made\r\npossible by the operation of the Budget system that the Congress has\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nBut it is evidently not enough to have care in making appropriations\r\nwithout any restraint upon expenditure. The Congress has provided that\r\ncheck by establishing the office of Comptroller General.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of maintaining the Budget Director and the Comptroller General\r\nis to secure economy and efficiency in Government expenditure. No better\r\nmethod has been devised for the accomplishment of that end. These offices\r\ncan not be administered in all the various details without making some\r\nerrors both of fact and of judgment. But the important consideration\r\nremains that these are the instrumentalities of the Congress and that no\r\nother plan has ever been adopted which was so successful in promoting\r\neconomy and efficiency. The Congress has absolute authority over the\r\nappropriations and is free to exercise its judgment, as the evidence may\r\nwarrant, in increasing or decreasing budget recommendations. But it ought\r\nto resist every effort to weaken or break down this most beneficial system\r\nof supervising appropriations and expenditures. Without it all the claim of\r\neconomy would be a mere pretense.\r\n\r\nTAXATION\r\n\r\nThe purpose of reducing expenditures is to secure a reduction in taxes.\r\nThat purpose is about to be realized. With commendable promptness the Ways\r\nand Means Committee of the House has undertaken in advance of the meeting\r\nof the Congress to frame a revenue act. As the bill has proceeded through\r\nthe committee it has taken on a nonpartisan character, and both Republicans\r\nand Democrats have joined in a measure which embodies many sound principles\r\nof tax reform. The bill will correct substantially the economic defects\r\ninjected into the revenue act of 1924, as well as many which have remained\r\nas war-time legacies. In its present form it should provide sufficient\r\nrevenue for the Government.\r\n\r\nThe excessive surtaxes have been reduced, estate tax rates are restored to\r\nmore reasonable figures, with every prospect of withdrawing from the field\r\nwhen the States have had the opportunity to correct the abuses in their own\r\ninheritance tax laws, the gift tax and publicity section are to be repealed\r\nmany miscellaneous taxes are lowered or abandoned, and the Board of Tax\r\nAppeals and the administrative features of the law are improved and\r\nstrengthened. I approve of the bill in principle. In so far as income-tax\r\nexemptions are concerned, it seems, to me the committee has gone as far as\r\nit is Safe to go and somewhat further than I should have gone. Any further\r\nextension along these lines would, in my opinion, impair the integrity of\r\nour income-tax system.\r\n\r\nI am advised that the bill will be through the House by Christmas. For\r\nthis prompt action the country call thank the good sense of the Ways and\r\nMeans Committee in framing an economic measure upon economic\r\nconsiderations. If this attitude continues to be reflected through the\r\nCongress, the taxpayer will have his relief by the time his March 15th\r\ninstallment of income taxes is due. Nonpartisan effort means certain, quick\r\naction. Determination of a revenue law definitely, promptly and solely as a\r\nrevenue law, is one of the greatest gifts a legislature can bestow upon its\r\nconstituents. I commend the example of file Ways and Means Committee. If\r\nfollowed, it will place sound legislation upon the books in time to give\r\nthe taxpayers the full benefit of tax reduction next year. This means that\r\nthe bill should reach me prior to March 15.\r\n\r\nAll these economic results are being sought not to benefit the rich, but to\r\nbenefit the people. They are for the purpose of encouraging industry in\r\norder that employment may be plentiful. They seek to make business good in\r\norder that wages may be good. They encourage prosperity in order that\r\npoverty may be banished from the home. They, seek to lay the foundation\r\nwhich, through increased production, may, give the people a more bountiful\r\nsupply of the necessaries of life, afford more leisure for the improvement\r\nof the mind, the appreciation of the arts of music and literature,\r\nsculpture and painting, and the beneficial enjoyment of outdoor sports and\r\nrecreation, enlarge the resources which minister to charity and by all\r\nthese means attempting to strengthen the spiritual life of the Nation.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nThe policy of our foreign relations, casting aside any suggestion of force,\r\nrests solely on the foundation of peace, good will, and good works. We have\r\nsought, in our intercourse with other nations, better understandings\r\nthrough conference and exchange of views its befits beings endowed with\r\nreason. The results have been the gradual elimination of disputes, the\r\nsettlement of controversies, and the establishment of a firmer friendship\r\nbetween America and the rest of the world that has ever existed tit any\r\nprevious time.\r\n\r\nThe example of this attitude has not been without its influence upon other\r\ncountries. Acting upon it, an adjustment was made of the difficult problem\r\nof reparations. This was the second step toward peace in Europe. It paved\r\nthe way for the agreements which were drawn up at the Locarno Conference.\r\nWhen ratified, these will represent the third step toward peace. While they\r\ndo not of themselves provide an economic rehabilitation, which is necessary\r\nfor the progress of Europe, by strengthening the guarantees of peace they\r\ndiminish the need for great armaments. If the energy which now goes into\r\nmilitary effort is transferred to productive endeavor it will greatly\r\nassist economic progress.\r\n\r\nThe Locarno agreements were made by the, European countries directly\r\ninterested without any formal intervention of America, although on July 3\r\nI publicly advocated such agreements in an address made in Massachusetts.\r\nWe have consistently refrained from intervening except when our help has\r\nbeen sought and we have felt it could be effectively given, as in the\r\nsettlement of reparations and the London Conference. These recent Locarno\r\nagreements represent the success of this policy which we have been\r\ninsisting ought to be adopted, of having European countries settle their\r\nown political problems without involving this country. This beginning seems\r\nto demonstrate that this policy is sound. It is exceedingly gratifying to\r\nobserve this progress, both in its method and in its result promises so\r\nmuch that is beneficial to the world.\r\n\r\nWhen these agreements are finally adopted, they will provide guarantees of\r\npeace that make the present prime reliance upon force in some parts of\r\nEurope very much less necessary. The natural corollary to these treaties\r\nshould be further international contracts for the limitation of armaments.\r\nThis work was successfully begun at the Washington Conference. Nothing was\r\ndone at that time concerning land forces because of European objection. Our\r\nstanding army has been reduced to around 118,000, about the necessary\r\npolice force for 115,000,000 people. We are not proposing to increase it,\r\nnor is it supposable that any foreign country looks with the slightest\r\nmisapprehension upon our land forces. They do not menace anybody. They are\r\nrather a protection to everybody.\r\n\r\nThe question of disarming upon land is so peculiarly European in its\r\npractical aspects that our country would look with particular gratitude\r\nupon any action which those countries might take to reduce their own\r\nmilitary forces. This is in accordance with our policy of not intervening\r\nunless the European powers are unable to agree and make request for our\r\nassistance. Whenever they are able to agree of their own accord it is\r\nespecially gratifying to its, and such agreements may be sure of our\r\nsympathetic support.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that it is the reduction of armies rather than of navies\r\nthat is of the first importance to the world at the present time. We shall\r\nlook with great satisfaction upon that effort and give it our approbation\r\nand encouragement. If that can be settled, we may more easily consider\r\nfurther reduction and limitation of naval armaments. For that purpose our\r\ncountry has constantly through its Executive, and through repeated acts of\r\nCongress, indicated its willingness to call such a conference. Under\r\ncongressional sanction it would seem to be wise to participate in any\r\nconference of the great powers for naval limitation of armament proposed\r\nupon such conditions that it would hold a fair promise of being effective.\r\nThe general policy of our country is for disarmament, and it ought not to\r\nhesitate to adopt any practical plan that might reasonably be expected to\r\nsucceed. But it would not care to attend a conference which from its\r\nlocation or constituency would in all probability prove futile.\r\n\r\nIn the further pursuit, of strengthening the bonds of peace and good will\r\nwe have joined with other nations in an international conference held at\r\nGeneva and signed an agreement which will be laid before the Senate for\r\nratification providing suitable measures for control and for publicity in\r\ninternational trade in arms, ammunition, and implements of war, and also\r\nexecuted a protocol providing for a prohibition of the use of poison gas in\r\nwar, in accordance with the principles of Article 5 of the treaty relating\r\nthereto signed at the Washington Conference. We are supporting the Pan\r\nAmerican efforts that are being made toward the codification of\r\ninternational law, and looking with sympathy oil the investigations\r\nconducted under philanthropic auspices of the proposal to agreements\r\noutlawing war. In accordance with promises made at the Washington\r\nConference, we have urged the calling of and are now represented at the\r\nChinese Customs Conference and on the Commission on Extraterritoriality,\r\nwhere it will be our policy so far as possible to meet the, aspirations of\r\nChina in all ways consistent with the interests of the countries involved.\r\n\r\nCOURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE\r\n\r\nPending before the Senate for nearly three years is the proposal to adhere\r\nto the protocol establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice.\r\nA well-established line of precedents mark America's effort to effect the\r\nestablishment of it court of this nature.. We took a leading part in laying\r\nthe foundation on which it rests in the establishment of The Hague Court of\r\nArbitration. It is that tribunal which nominates the judges who are elected\r\nby the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe proposal submitted to the Senate was made dependent upon four\r\nconditions, the first of which is that by supporting the court we do not\r\nassume any obligations under the league; second, that we may participate\r\nupon an equality with other States in the election of judges; third, that\r\nthe Congress shall determine what part of the expenses we shall bear;\r\nfourth, that the statute creating the court shall not be amended without\r\nout consent; and to these I have proposed an additional condition to the\r\neffect that we are not to be bound by advisory opinions rendered without\r\nour consent.\r\n\r\nThe court appears to be independent of the league. It is true the judges\r\nare elected by the Assembly and Council, but they are nominated by the\r\nCourt of Arbitration, which we assisted to create and of which we are a\r\npart. The court was created by it statute, so-called, which is really a\r\ntreaty made among some forty-eight different countries, that might properly\r\nbe called a constitution of the court. This statute provides a method by\r\nwhich the judges are chosen so that when the Court of Arbitration\r\nnominates them and the Assembly and Council of the League elect them, they\r\nare not acting as instruments of the Court of Arbitration or instruments of\r\nthe league, but as instruments of the statute.\r\n\r\nThis will be even more apparent if our representatives sit with the members\r\nof the council and assembly in electing the judges. It is true they are\r\npaid through the league though not by the league, but by the countries\r\nwhich are members of the league and by our country if we accept the\r\nprotocol. The judges are paid by the league only in the same sense that it\r\ncould be said United States judges are paid by the Congress. The court\r\nderives all its authority from the statute and is so completely independent\r\nof the league that it could go on functioning if the league were disbanded,\r\nat least until the terms of the judges expired.\r\n\r\nThe most careful provisions are made in the statute as to the\r\nqualifications of judges. Those who make the nominations are recommended to\r\nconsult with their highest court of justice, their law schools and\r\nacademies. The judges must be persons of high moral character, qualified to\r\nhold the highest judicial offices in that country, or be jurisconsults of\r\nrecognized competence in international law. It must be assumed that these\r\nrequirements will continue to be carefully met, and with America joining\r\nthe countries already concerned it is difficult to comprehend how human\r\ningenuity could better provide for the establishment of a court which would\r\nmaintain its independence. It has to be recognized that independence is to\r\na considerable extent a matter of ability, character, and personality. Some\r\neffort was made in the early beginnings to interfere with the independence\r\nof our Supreme Court. It did not succeed because of the quality of the men\r\nwho made up that tribunal.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem that the authority to give advisory opinions interferes\r\nwith the independence of the court. Advisory opinions in and of themselves\r\nare not harmful, but may be used in such a way as to be very beneficial\r\nbecause they undertake to prevent injury rather than merely afford a remedy\r\nafter the injury has been done. As a principle that only implies that the\r\ncourt shall function when proper application is made to it. Deciding the\r\nquestion involved upon issues submitted for an advisory opinion does not\r\ndiffer materially from deciding the question involved upon issues submitted\r\nby contending parties. Up to the present time the court has given an\r\nadvisory opinion when it judged it had jurisdiction, and refused to give\r\none when it judged it did not have jurisdiction. Nothing in the work of the\r\ncourt has yet been an indication that this is an impairment of its\r\nindependence or that its practice differs materially from the giving of\r\nlike opinions under the authority of the constitutions of several of our\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNo provision of the statute seems to me to give this court any authority to\r\nbe a political rather than a judicial court. We have brought cases in this\r\ncountry before our courts which, when they have been adjudged to be\r\npolitical, have been thereby dismissed. It is not improbable that political\r\nquestions will be submitted to this court, but again up to the present time\r\nthe court has refused to pass on political questions and our support would\r\nundoubtedly have a tendency to strengthen it in that refusal.\r\n\r\nWe are not proposing to subject ourselves to any compulsory jurisdiction.\r\nIf we support the court, we can never be obliged to submit any case which\r\ninvolves our interests for its decision. Our appearance before it would\r\nalways be voluntary, for the purpose of presenting a case which we had\r\nagreed might be presented. There is no more danger that others might bring\r\ncases before the court involving our interests which we did not wish to\r\nhave brought, after we have adhered, and probably not so much, than there\r\nwould be of bringing such cases if we do not adhere. I think that we would\r\nhave the same legal or moral right to disregard such a finding in the one\r\ncase that we would in the other.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to support any court, it will not be one that we have set\r\nup alone or which reflects only our ideals. Other nations have their\r\ncustoms and their institutions, their thoughts and their methods of life.\r\nIf a court is going to be international, its composition will have to yield\r\nto what is good in all these various elements. Neither will it be possible\r\nto support a court which is exactly perfect, or under which we assume\r\nabsolutely no obligations. If we are seeking that opportunity, we might as\r\nwell declare that we are opposed to supporting any court. If any agreement\r\nis made, it will be because it undertakes to set up a tribunal which can do\r\nsome of the things that other nations wish to have done. We shall not find\r\nourselves bearing a disproportionate share of the world's burdens by our\r\nadherence, and we may as well remember that there is absolutely no escape\r\nfor our country from bearing its share of the world's burdens in any case.\r\nWe shall do far better service to ourselves and to others if we admit this\r\nand discharge our duties voluntarily, than if we deny it and are forced to\r\nmeet the same obligations unwillingly.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine anything that would be more helpful to the world\r\nthan stability, tranquility and international justice. We may say that we\r\nare contributing to these factors independently, but others less\r\nfortunately located do not and can not make a like contribution except\r\nthrough mutual cooperation. The old balance of power, mutual alliances, and\r\ngreat military forces were not brought bout by any mutual dislike for\r\nindependence, but resulted from the domination of circumstances. Ultimately\r\nthey were forced on us. Like all others engaged in the war whatever we said\r\nas a matter of fact we joined an alliance, we became a military power, we\r\nimpaired our independence. We have more at stake than any one else in\r\navoiding a repetition of that calamity. Wars do not, spring into existence.\r\nThey arise from small incidents and trifling irritations which can be\r\nadjusted by an international court. We can contribute greatly to the\r\nadvancement of our ideals by joining with other nations in maintaining such\r\na tribunal.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN DEBTS\r\n\r\nGradually, settlements have been made which provide for the liquidation of\r\ndebts due to our Government from foreign governments. Those made with Great\r\nBritain, Finland, Hungary Lithuania, and Poland have already been approved\r\nby the Congress. Since the adjournment, further agreements have been\r\nentered into with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Italy, and\r\nRumania. These 11 nations, which have already made settlements, represent\r\n$6,419,528,641 of the original principal of the loans. The principal sums\r\nwithout interest, still pending, are the debt of France, of $3,340,000,000;\r\nGreece, $15,000,000; Yugoslavia, $.51,000,000; Liberia, $26,000; Russia,\r\n$192,000,000, which those at present in control have undertaken, openly to\r\nrepudiate; Nicaragua, $84,000, which is being paid currently; and Austria,\r\n$24,000,000, on which by act of Congress a moratorium of 20 years has been\r\ngranted. The only remaining sum is $12,000,000, due from Armenia, which has\r\nnow ceased to exist as an independent nation.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the settlements made, the amount of principal and\r\ninterest which is to be paid to the United States under these agreements\r\naggregate $15,200,688,253.93. It is obvious that the remaining settlements,\r\nwhich will undoubtedly be made, will bring this sum up to an amount which\r\nwill more than equal the principal due on our present national debt. While\r\nthese settlements are very large in the aggregate, it has been felt that\r\nthe terms granted were in all cases very generous. They impose no undue\r\nburden and are mutually beneficial in the observance of international faith\r\nand the improvement of international credit.\r\n\r\nEvery reasonable effort will be made to secure agreements for liquidation\r\nwith the remaining countries, whenever they are in such condition that they\r\ncan be made. Those which have already been negotiated under the bipartisan\r\ncommission established by the Congress have been made only after the most\r\nthoroughgoing and painstaking investigation, continued for a long time\r\nbefore meeting with the representatives of the countries concerned. It is\r\nbelieved that they represent in each instance the best that can be done and\r\nthe wisest settlement that can be secured. One very important result is the\r\nstabilization of foreign currency, making exchange assist rather than\r\nembarrass our trade. Wherever sacrifices have been made of money, it will\r\nbe more than amply returned in better understanding and friendship, while\r\nin so far as these adjustments will contribute to the financial stability\r\nof the debtor countries, to their good order, prosperity, and progress,\r\nthey represent hope of improved trade relations and mutual contributions to\r\nthe civilization of the world.\r\n\r\nALIEN PROBLEM\r\n\r\nNegotiations are progressing among the interested parties in relation to\r\nthe final distribution of the assets in the hands of the Alien Property\r\nCustodian. Our Government and people are interested as creditors; the\r\nGerman Government and people are interested as debtors and owners of the\r\nseized property. Pending the outcome of these negotiations, I do not\r\nrecommend any affirmative legislation. For the present we should continue\r\nin possession of this property which we hold as security for the settlement\r\nof claims due to our people and our Government.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nWhile not enough time has elapsed to afford a conclusive demonstration,\r\nsuch results as have been secured indicate that our immigration law is on\r\nthe whole beneficial. It is undoubtedly a protection to the wage earners of\r\nthis country. The situation should however, be carefully surveyed, in order\r\nto ascertain whether it is working a needless hardship upon our own\r\ninhabitants. If it deprives them of the comfort and society of those bound\r\nto them by close family ties, such modifications should be adopted as will\r\nafford relief, always in accordance with the principle that our Government\r\nowes its first duty to our own people and that no alien, inhabitant of\r\nanother country, has any legal rights whatever under our Constitution and\r\nlaws. It is only through treaty, or through residence here that such rights\r\naccrue. But we should not, however, be forgetful of the obligations of a\r\ncommon humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile our country numbers among its best citizens many of those of foreign\r\nbirth, yet those who now enter in violation of our laws by that very act\r\nthereby place themselves in a class of undesirables. Investigation\r\nreveals that any considerable number are coming here in defiance of our\r\nimmigration restrictions, it will undoubtedly create the necessity for the\r\nregistration of all aliens. We ought to have no prejudice against an alien\r\nbecause he is an alien. The standard which we apply to our inhabitants is\r\nthat of manhood, not place of birth. Restrictive immigration is to a large\r\ndegree for economic purposes. It is applied in order that we may not have a\r\nlarger annual increment of good people within our borders than we can weave\r\ninto our economic fabric in such a way as to supply their needs without\r\nundue injury to ourselves.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nNever before in time of peace has our country maintained so large and\r\neffective a military force as it now has. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps,\r\nNational Guard, and Organized Reserves represent a strength of about\r\n558,400 men. These forces are well trained, well equipped, and high in\r\nmorale.\r\n\r\nA sound selective service act giving broad authority for the mobilization\r\nin time of peril of all the resources of the country, both persons and\r\nmaterials, is needed to perfect our defense policy in accordance with our\r\nideals of equality. The provision for more suitable housing to be paid for\r\nout of funds derived from the sale of excess lands, pending before the last\r\nCongress, ought to be brought forward and passed. Reasonable replacements\r\nought to be made to maintain a sufficient ammunition reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Navy has the full treaty tonnage of capital ships. Work is going\r\nforward in modernizing the older ones, building aircraft carriers,\r\nadditional fleet submarines, and fast scout cruisers, but we are carefully\r\navoiding anything that might be construed as a competition in armaments\r\nwith other nations. The joint Army and Navy maneuvers at Hawaii, followed\r\nby the cruise of a full Battle Fleet to Australia and New Zealand, were\r\nsuccessfully carried out. These demonstrations revealed a most satisfactory\r\ncondition of the ships and the men engaged.\r\n\r\nLast year at my suggestion the General Board of the Navy made an\r\ninvestigation and report on the relation of aircraft to warships. As a\r\nresult authorizations and appropriations were made for more scout cruisers\r\nand fleet submarines and for completing aircraft carriers and equipping\r\nthem with necessary planes. Additional training in aviation was begun at\r\nthe Military and Naval Academies. A method of coordination and cooperation\r\nof the Army and Navy and the principal aircraft builders is being\r\nperfected. At the suggestion of the Secretaries of War and Navy I appointed\r\na special board to make a further study of the problem of aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Air Board ought to be reassuring to the country,\r\ngratifying to the service and satisfactory to the Congress. It is\r\nthoroughly complete and represents the mature thought of the best talent in\r\nthe country. No radical change in organization of the service seems\r\nnecessary. The Departments of War, Navy, and Commerce should each be\r\nprovided with an additional assistant secretary, not necessarily with\r\nstatutory duties but who would be available under the direction of the\r\nSecretary to give especial attention to air navigation. We must have an air\r\nstrength worthy of America. Provision should be made for two additional\r\nbrigadier generals for the Army Air Service. Temporary rank corresponding\r\nto their duties should be awarded to active flying officers in both Army\r\nand Navy.\r\n\r\nAviation is of great importance both for national defense and commercial\r\ndevelopment. We ought to proceed in its improvement by the necessary\r\nexperiment and investigation. Our country is not behind in this art. It has\r\nmade records for speed and for the excellence of its planes. It ought to go\r\non maintaining its manufacturing plants capable of rapid production, giving\r\nnational assistance to the la in out of airways, equipping itself with a\r\nmoderate number of planes and keeping an air force trained to the highest\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nWhile I am a thorough believer in national defense and entirely committed\r\nto the policy of adequate preparation, I am just as thoroughly opposed to\r\ninstigating or participating in a policy of competitive armaments. Nor does\r\npreparation mean a policy of militarizing. Our people and industries are\r\nsolicitous for the cause of 0111, country, and have great respect for the\r\nArmy and Navy and foil the uniform worn by the men who stand ready at all\r\ntimes for our protection to encounter the dangers and perils necessary to\r\nmilitary service, but all of these activities are to be taken not in behalf\r\nof aggression but in behalf of peace. They are the instruments by which we\r\nundertake to do our part to promote good will and support stability among\r\nall peoples.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nIf any one desires to estimate the esteem in which the veterans of America\r\nare held by their fellow citizens, it is but necessary to remember that the\r\ncurrent budget calls for an expenditure of about $650,000.000 in their\r\nbehalf. This is nearly the amount of the total cost of the National\r\nGovernment, exclusive of the post office, before we entered the last war.\r\n\r\nAt the two previous sessions of Congress legislation affecting veterans'\r\nrelief was enacted and the law liberalized. This legislation brought into\r\nbeing a number of new provisions tending more nearly to meet the needs of\r\nour veterans, as well as afford the necessary authority to perfect the\r\nadministration of these laws.\r\n\r\nExperience with the new legislation so far has clearly demonstrated its\r\nconstructive nature. It has increased the benefits received by many and has\r\nmade eligible for benefits many others. Direct disbursements to the veteran\r\nor his dependents exceeding $21,000,000 have resulted, which otherwise\r\nwould not have been made. The degree of utilization of our hospitals has\r\nincreased through making facilities available to the incapacitated veteran\r\nregardless of service origin of the disability. This new legislation also\r\nhas brought about a marked improvement of service to the veteran.\r\n\r\nThe organizations of ex-service men have proposed additional legislative\r\nchanges which you will consider, but until the new law and the\r\nmodifications made at the last session of Congress are given a more\r\nthorough test further changes in the basic law should be few and made only\r\nafter careful though sympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\nThe principal work now before the Veterans' Bureau is the perfection of its\r\norganization and further improvements in service. Some minor legislative\r\nchanges are deemed necessary to enable the bureau to retain that high grade\r\nof professional talent essential in handling the problems of the bureau.\r\nSuch changes as tend toward the improvement of service and the carrying\r\nforward to completion of the hospital construction program are recommended\r\nfor the consideration of the proper committees of Congress.\r\n\r\nWith the enormous outlay that is now being made in behalf of the veterans\r\nand their dependents, with a tremendous war debt still requiring great\r\nannual expenditure, with the still high rate of taxation, while every\r\nprovision should be made for the relief of the disabled and the necessary\r\ncare of dependents, the Congress may well consider whether the financial\r\ncondition of the Government is not such that further bounty through the\r\nenlargement of general pensions and other emoluments ought not to be\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nNo doubt the position of agriculture as a whole has very much improved\r\nsince the depression of three and four years ago. But there are many\r\nlocalities and many groups of individuals, apparently through no fault of\r\ntheir own, sometimes due to climatic conditions and sometimes to the\r\nprevailing price of a certain crop, still in a distressing condition. This\r\nis probably temporary, but it is none the less acute. National Government\r\nagencies, the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, the Farm Loan Board,\r\nthe intermediate credit banks, and the Federal Reserve Board are all\r\ncooperating to be of assistance and relief. On the other hand, there are\r\nlocalities and individuals who have had one of their most prosperous years.\r\nThe general price level is fair, but here again there are exceptions both\r\nways, some items being poor while others are excellent. In spite of a\r\nlessened production the farm income for this year will be about the same as\r\nlast year and much above the three preceding years.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is a very complex industry. It does not consist of one problem,\r\nbut of several. They can not be solved at one stroke. They have to be met\r\nin different ways, and small gains are not to be despised.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared from all the investigations that I have been able to make\r\nthat the farmers as a whole are determined to maintain the independence of\r\ntheir business. They do not wish to have meddling on the part of the\r\nGovernment or to be placed under the inevitable restrictions involved in\r\nany system of direct or indirect price-fixing, which would result from\r\npermitting the Government to operate in the agricultural markets. They are\r\nshowing a very commendable skill in organizing themselves to transact their\r\nown business through cooperative marketing, which will this year turn over\r\nabout $2,500,000,000, or nearly one-fifth of the total agricultural\r\nbusiness. In this they are receiving help from the Government. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture should be strengthened in this facility, in order\r\nto be able to respond when these marketing associations want help. While\r\nit ought not to undertake undue regulation, it should be equipped to give\r\nprompt information on crop prospects, supply, demand, current receipts,\r\nimports, exports, and prices.\r\n\r\nA bill embodying these principles, which has been drafted under the advice\r\nand with the approval of substantially all the leaders and managers in the\r\ncooperative movement, will be presented to the Congress for its enactment.\r\nLegislation should also be considered to provide for leasing the\r\nunappropriated public domain for grazing purposes and adopting a uniform\r\npolicy relative to grazing on the public lands and in the national\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nA more intimate relation should be established between agriculture and the\r\nother business activities of the Nation. They are mutually dependent and\r\ncan each advance their own prosperity most by advancing the prosperity of\r\nthe other. Meantime the Government will continue those activities which\r\nhave resulted in an unprecedented amount of legislation and the pouring out\r\nof great sums of money during the last five years. The work for good roads,\r\nbetter land and water transportation, increased support for agricultural\r\neducation, extension of credit facilities through the Farm Loan Boards and\r\nthe intermediate credit banks, the encouragement of orderly marketing and a\r\nrepression of wasteful speculation, will all be continued.\r\n\r\nFollowing every other depression, after a short period the price of farm\r\nproduce has taken and maintained the lead in the advance. This advance had\r\nreached a climax before the war. Everyone will recall the discussion that\r\nwent on for four or five years prior to 1914 concerning the high cost of\r\nliving. This history is apparently beginning to repeat itself. While\r\nwholesale prices of other commodities have been declining, farm prices have\r\nbeen increasing. There is every reason to suppose that a new era in\r\nagricultural prosperity lies just before us, which will probably be\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nThe problem of Muscle Shoals seems to me to have assumed a place all out of\r\nproportion with its real importance. It probably does not represent in\r\nmarket value much more than a first-class battleship, yet it has been\r\ndiscussed in the Congress over a period of years and for months at a time.\r\nIt ought to be developed for the production of nitrates primarily, and\r\nincidentally for power purposes. This would serve defensive, agricultural,\r\nand industrial purposes. I am in favor of disposing of this property to\r\nmeet these purposes. The findings of the special commission will be\r\ntransmitted to the Congress for their information. I am convinced that the\r\nbest possible disposition can be made by direct authorization of the\r\nCongress. As a means of negotiation I recommend the immediate appointment\r\nof a small joint special committee chosen from the appropriate general\r\nstanding committees of the House and Senate to receive bids, which when\r\nmade should be reported with recommendations as to acceptance, upon which a\r\nlaw should be enacted, effecting a sale to the highest bidder who will\r\nagree to carry out these purposes.\r\n\r\nIf anything were needed to demonstrate the almost utter incapacity of the\r\nNational Government to deal directly with an industrial and commercial\r\nproblem, it has been provided by our experience with this property. We have\r\nexpended vast fortunes, we have taxed everybody, but we are unable to\r\nsecure results, which benefit anybody. This property ought, to be\r\ntransferred to private management under conditions which will dedicate it\r\nto the public purpose for which it was conceived.\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION\r\n\r\nThe National Government is committed to a policy of reclamation and\r\nirrigation which it desires to establish on a sound basis and continue in\r\nthe interest of the localities concerned. Exhaustive studies have recently\r\nbeen made of Federal reclamation, which have resulted in improving the\r\nprojects and adjusting many difficulties. About one third of the projects\r\nis in good financial condition, another third can probably be made\r\nprofitable, while the other third is under unfavorable conditions. The\r\nCongress has already provided for a survey which will soon be embodied in a\r\nreport. That ought to suggest a method of relief which will make\r\nunnecessary further appeals to the Congress. Unless this can be done,\r\nFederal reclamation will be considerably retarded. With the greatly\r\nincreased cost of construction and operation, it has become necessary to\r\nplan in advance, by community organization and selective agriculture,\r\nmethods sufficient to repay these increasing outlays.\r\n\r\nThe human and economic interests of the farmer citizens suggest that the\r\nStates should be required to exert some effort and assume some\r\nresponsibility, especially in the intimate, detailed, and difficult work of\r\nsecuring settlers and developing farms which directly profit them, but only\r\nindirectly and remotely can reimburse the Nation. It is believed that the\r\nFederal Government should continue to be the agency for planning and\r\nconstructing the great undertakings needed to regulate and bring into use\r\nthe rivers the West, many of which are interstate in character, but the\r\ndetailed work of creating agricultural communities and a rural civilization\r\non the land made ready for reclamation ought to be either transferred to\r\nthe State in its entirety or made a cooperative effort of the State and\r\nFederal Government.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of a merchant marine is of the utmost importance for\r\nnational defense and the service of our commerce. We have a large number of\r\nships engaged in that service. We also have a surplus supply, costly to\r\ncare for, which ought to be sold. All the investigations that have been\r\nmade under my direction, and those which have been prosecuted\r\nindependently, have reached the conclusion that the fleet should be under\r\nthe direct control of a single executive head, while the Shipping Board\r\nshould exercise its judicial and regulatory functions in Accordance with\r\nits original conception. The report of Henry G. Dalton, a business man of\r\nbroad experience, with a knowledge of shipping, made to me after careful\r\ninvestigation, will be transmitted for the information of the Congress, the\r\nstudies pursued under the direction of the United States Chamber of\r\nCommerce will also be accessible, and added to these will be the report of\r\nthe special committee of the House.\r\n\r\nI do not advocate the elimination of regional considerations, but it has\r\nbecome apparent that without centralized executive action the management of\r\nthis great business, like the management of any other great business, will\r\nflounder in incapacity and languish under a division of council. A plain\r\nand unmistakable reassertion of this principle of unified control, which I\r\nhave always been advised was the intention of the Congress to apply, is\r\nnecessary to increase the efficiency of our merchant fleet.\r\n\r\nCOAL\r\n\r\nThe perennial conflict in the coal industry is still going on to the great\r\ndetriment of the wage earners, the owners, and especially to the public.\r\nWith deposits of coal in this country capable of supplying its needs for\r\nhundreds of years, inability to manage and control this great resource for\r\nthe benefit of all concerned is very close to a national economic failure.\r\nIt has been the subject of repeated investigation and reiterated\r\nrecommendation. Yet the industry seems never to have accepted modern\r\nmethods of adjusting differences between employers and employees. The\r\nindustry could serve the public much better and become subject to a much\r\nmore effective method of control if regional consolidations and more\r\nfreedom in the formation of marketing associations, under the supervision\r\nof the Department of Commerce, were permitted.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the National Government has little or no authority to\r\ndeal with this vital necessity of the life of the country. It has permitted\r\nitself to remain so powerless that its only attitude must be humble\r\nsupplication. Authority should be lodged with the President and the\r\nDepartments of Commerce and Labor, giving them power to deal with an\r\nemergency. They should be able to appoint temporary boards with authority\r\nto call for witnesses and documents, conciliate differences, encourage\r\narbitration, and in case of threatened scarcity exercise control over\r\ndistribution. Making the facts public under these circumstances through a\r\nstatement from an authoritative source would be of great public benefit.\r\nThe report of the last coal commission should be brought forward,\r\nreconsidered, and acted upon.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION\r\n\r\nUnder the orderly processes of our fundamental institutions the\r\nConstitution was lately amended providing for national prohibition. The\r\nCongress passed an act for its enforcement, and similar acts have been\r\nprovided by most of the States. It is the law of the land. It is the duty\r\nof all who come under its, jurisdiction to observe the spirit of that law,\r\nand it is the duty of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department\r\nto enforce it. Action to prevent smuggling, illegal transportation in\r\ninterstate commerce, abuse in the use of permits, and existence of sources\r\nof supply for illegal traffic is almost entirely imposed upon the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThrough treaties with foreign governments and increased activities of the\r\nCoast Guard, revenue agents, district attorneys and enforcement agents\r\neffort is being made to prevent these violations. But the Constitution also\r\nputs a concurrent duty on the States. We need their active and energetic\r\ncooperation, the vigilant action of their police, and the jurisdiction of\r\ntheir courts to assist in enforcement. I request of the people observance,\r\nof the public officers continuing efforts for enforcement, and of the\r\nCongress favorable action on the budget recommendation for the prosecution\r\nof this work.\r\n\r\nWATERWAY DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nFor many years our country has been employed in plans and M for the\r\ndevelopment of our intracoastal and inland waterways. This work along our\r\ncoast is an important adjunct to our commerce. It will be carried on,\r\ntogether with the further opening up of our harbors, as our resources\r\npermit. The Government made an agreement during the war to take over the\r\nCape Cod Canal, under which the owners made valuable concessions. This\r\npledged faith of the Government ought to be redeemed.\r\n\r\nTwo other main fields are under consideration. One is the Great Lakes and\r\nSt. Lawrence, including the Erie Canal. This includes stabilizing the lake\r\nlevel, and is both a waterway and power project. A joint commission of the\r\nUnited States and Canada is working on plans and surveys which will not be\r\ncompleted until next April. No final determination can be made, apparently,\r\nexcept under treaty as to the participation of both countries. The other is\r\nthe Mississippi River stem. This is almost entirely devoted to navigation.\r\nWork on the Ohio River will be completed in about three years. A modern\r\nchannel connecting Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City, and Pittsburgh should\r\nbe laid out and work on the tributaries prosecuted. Some work is being done\r\nof a preparatory nature along the Missouri, and large expenditures are\r\nbeing made yearly in the lower reaches of the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries which contribute both to flood control and navigation.\r\nPreliminary measures are being taken on the Colorado River project, which\r\nis exceedingly important for flood control, irrigation, power development,\r\nand water supply to the area concerned. It would seem to be very doubtful,\r\nhowever, whether it is practical to secure affirmative action of the\r\nCongress, except under a Joint agreement of the several States.\r\n\r\nThe Government has already expended large sums upon scientific research and\r\nengineering investigation in promotion of this Colorado River project. The\r\nactual progress has been retarded for many years by differences among the\r\nseven States in the basin over their relative water rights and among\r\ndifferent groups as to methods. In an attempt to settle the primary\r\ndifficulty of the water rights, Congress authorized the Colorado River\r\nCommission which agreed on November 24, 1922, upon an interstate compact to\r\nsettle these rights, subject to the ratification of the State legislatures\r\nand Congress. All seven States except Arizona at one time ratified, the\r\nArizona Legislature making certain reservations which failed to meet the\r\napproval of the governor. Subsequently an attempt was made to establish the\r\ncompact upon a six-State basis, but in this case California imposed\r\nreservations. There appears to be no division of opinion upon the major\r\nprinciples of the compact, but difficulty in separating contentions to\r\nmethods of development from the discussion of it. It is imperative that\r\nflood control be undertaken for California and Arizona. preparation made\r\nfor irrigation, for power, and for domestic water.\r\n\r\nSome or all of these questions are combined in every proposed development.\r\nThe Federal Government is interested in some of these phases, State\r\ngovernments and municipalities and irrigation districts in others, and\r\nprivate corporations in still others. Because of all this difference of\r\nview it is most desirable that Congress should consider the creation of\r\nsome agency that will be able to determine methods of improvement solely\r\nupon economic and engineering facts, that would be authorized to negotiate\r\nand settle, subject to the approval of Congress, the participation, rights,\r\nand obligations of each group in any particular works. Only by some such\r\nmethod can early construction be secured.\r\n\r\nWATER POWER\r\n\r\nAlong with the development of navigation should go every possible\r\nencouragement for the development of our water power. While steam still\r\nplays a dominant part, this is more and more becoming an era of\r\nelectricity. Once installed, the cost is moderate, has not tended greatly\r\nto increase, and is entirely free from the unavoidable dirt and\r\ndisagreeable features attendant upon the burning of coal. Every facility\r\nshould be extended for the connection of the various units into a\r\nsuperpower plant, capable at all times of a current increasing uniformity\r\nover the entire system.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS\r\n\r\nThe railroads throughout the country are in a fair state of prosperity.\r\nTheir service is good and their supply of cars is abundant. Their condition\r\nwould be improved and the public better served by a system of\r\nconsolidations. I recommend that the Congress authorize such consolidations\r\ntinder the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, with power to\r\napprove or disapprove when proposed parts are excluded or new parts added.\r\nI am informed that the railroad managers and their employees have reached a\r\nsubstantial agreement as to what legislation is necessary to regulate and\r\nimprove their relationship. Whenever they bring forward such proposals,\r\nwhich seem sufficient also to protect the interests of the public, they\r\nshould be enacted into law.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to report that both the railroad managers and railroad\r\nemployees are providing boards for the mutual adjustment of differences in\r\nharmony with the principles of conference, conciliation, and arbitration.\r\nThe solution of their problems ought to be an example to all other\r\nindustries. Those who ask the protections of civilization should be ready\r\nto use the methods of civilization.\r\n\r\nA strike in modern industry has many of the aspects of war in the modern\r\nworld. It injures labor and it injures capital. If the industry involved is\r\na basic one, it reduces the necessary economic surplus and, increasing the\r\ncost of living, it injures the economic welfare and general comfort of the\r\nwhole people. It also involves a deeper cost. It tends to embitter and\r\ndivide the community into warring classes and thus weakens the unity and\r\npower of our national life.\r\n\r\nLabor can make no permanent gains at the cost of the general welfare. All\r\nthe victories won by organized labor in the past generation have been won\r\nthrough the support of public opinion. The manifest inclination of the\r\nmanagers and employees of the railroads to adopt a policy of action in\r\nharmony with these principles marks a new epoch in our industrial life.\r\n\r\nOUTLYING POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\nThe time has come for careful investigation of the expenditures and success\r\nof the laws by which we have undertaken to administer our outlying\r\npossessions. A very large amount of money is being expended for\r\nadministration in Alaska. It appears so far out of proportion to the number\r\nof inhabitants and the amount of production as to indicate cause for\r\nthorough investigation. Likewise consideration should be given to the\r\nexperience under the law which governs the Philippines. From such reports\r\nas reach me there are indications that more authority should be given to\r\nthe Governor General, so that he will not be so dependent upon the local\r\nlegislative body to render effective our efforts to set an example of the,\r\nsound administration and good government, which is so necessary for the\r\npreparation of the Philippine people for self-government under ultimate\r\nindependence. If they are to be trained in these arts, it is our duty to\r\nprovide for them the best that there is.\r\n\r\nRETIREMENT OF JUDGES\r\n\r\nThe act of March 3, 1911, ought to be amended so that the term of years of\r\nservice of judges of any court of the United States requisite for\r\nretirement with pay shall be computed to include not only continuous but\r\naggregate service.\r\n\r\nMOTHERS' AID\r\n\r\nThe Government ought always to be alert on the side of the humanities. It\r\nOught to encourage provisions for economic justice for the defenseless. It\r\nought to extend its relief through its national and local agencies, as may\r\nbe appropriate in each case, to the suffering and the needy. It ought to be\r\ncharitable.\r\n\r\nAlthough more than 40 of our States have enacted measures in aid of\r\nmotherhood, the District of Columbia is still without such a law. A\r\ncarefully considered bill will be presented, which ought to have most\r\nthoughtful consideration in order that the Congress may adopt a measure\r\nwhich will be hereafter a model for all parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the Congress passed the civil service act, which from a modest\r\nbeginning of 14,000 employees has grown until there are now 425,000 in the\r\nclassified service. This has removed the clerical force of the Nation from\r\nthe wasteful effects of the spoils system and made it more stable and\r\nefficient. The time has come to consider classifying all postmasters,\r\ncollectors of customs, collectors of internal revenue, and prohibition\r\nagents, by an act covering in those at present in office, except when\r\notherwise provided by Executive order.\r\n\r\nThe necessary statistics are now being gathered to form the basis of a\r\nvaluation of the civil service retirement fund based on current conditions\r\nof the service. It is confidently expected that this valuation will be\r\ncompleted in time to be made available to the Congress during the present\r\nsession. It will afford definite knowledge of existing, and future\r\nliabilities under the present law and determination OF liabilities under\r\nany proposed change in the present law. We should have this information\r\nbefore creating further obligations for retirement annuities which will\r\nbecome liabilities to be met in the future from the money of the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe classification act of 1923, with the subsequent legislative action\r\nproviding for adjustment of the compensation of field service positions,\r\nhas operated materially to improve employment conditions in the Federal\r\nservice. The administration of the act is in the hands of an impartial\r\nboard, functioning without the necessity of a direct appropriation. It\r\nwould be inadvisable at this time to place in other hands the\r\nadministration of this act.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION\r\n\r\nThe proper function of the Federal Trade Commission is to supervise and\r\ncorrect those practices in commerce which are detrimental to fair\r\ncompetition. In this it performs a useful function and should be continued\r\nand supported. It was designed also to be a help to honest business. In my\r\nmessage to the Sixty-eighth Congress I recommended that changes in the\r\nprocedure then existing be made. Since then the commission by its own\r\naction has reformed its rules, giving greater speed and economy in the\r\ndisposal of its cases and full opportunity for those accused to be heard.\r\nThese changes are improvements and, if necessary, provision should be made\r\nfor their permanency.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nNo final action has yet been taken on the measure providing for the\r\nreorganization of the various departments. I therefore suggest that this\r\nmeasure, which will be of great benefit to the efficient and economical\r\nadministration of the business of the Government, be brought forward and\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO\r\n\r\nNearly one-tenth of our population consists of the Negro race. The progress\r\nwhich they have made in all the arts of civilization in the last 60 years\r\nis almost beyond belief. Our country has no more loyal citizens. But they\r\ndo still need sympathy, kindness, and helpfulness. They need reassurance\r\nthat the requirements of the Government and society to deal out to them\r\neven-handed justice will be met. They should be protected from all violence\r\nand supported in the peaceable enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.\r\nThose who do violence to them should be punished for their crimes. No other\r\ncourse of action is worthy of the American people.\r\n\r\nOur country has many elements in its population, many different modes of\r\nthinking and living, all of which are striving in their own way to be loyal\r\nto the high ideals worthy of the crown of American citizenship. It is\r\nfundamental of our institutions that they seek to guarantee to all our\r\ninhabitants the right to live their own lives under the protection of the\r\npublic law. This does not include any license to injure others materially,\r\nphysically, morally, to Incite revolution, or to violate the established\r\ncustoms which have long had the sanction of enlightened society.\r\n\r\nBut it does mean the full right to liberty and equality before the law\r\nwithout distinction of race or creed. This condition can not be granted to\r\nothers, or enjoyed by ourselves, except by the application of the principle\r\nof broadest tolerance. Bigotry is only another name for slavery. It reduces\r\nto serfdom not only those against whom it is directed, but also those who\r\nseek to apply it. An enlarged freedom can only be secured by the\r\napplication of the golden rule. No other utterance ever presented such a\r\npractical rule of life.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that we are reaching into an era of great general\r\nprosperity. It will continue only so long as we shall use it properly.\r\nAfter all, there is but a fixed quantity of wealth in this country at any\r\nfixed time. The only way that we can all secure more of it is to create\r\nmore. The element of time enters into production, If the people have\r\nsufficient moderation and contentment to be willing to improve their\r\ncondition by the process of enlarging production, eliminating waste, and\r\ndistributing equitably, a prosperity almost without limit lies before its.\r\nIf the people are to be dominated by selfishness, seeking immediate riches\r\nby nonproductive speculation and by wasteful quarreling over the returns\r\nfrom industry, they will be confronted by the inevitable results of\r\ndepression and privation. If they will continue industrious and thrifty,\r\ncontented with fair wages and moderate profits, and the returns which\r\naccrue from the development of oar natural resources, our prosperity will\r\nextend itself indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn all your deliberations you should remember that the purpose of\r\nlegislation is to translate principles into action. It is an effort to have\r\nour country be better by doing better. Because the thoughts and ways of\r\npeople are firmly fixed and not easily changed, the field within which\r\nimmediate improvement can be secured is very narrow. Legislation can\r\nprovide opportunity. Whether it is taken advantage of or not depends upon\r\nthe people themselves. The Government of the United States has been created\r\nby the people. It is solely responsible to them. It will be most successful\r\nif it is conducted solely for their benefit. All its efforts would be of\r\nlittle avail unless they brought more justice, more enlightenment, more\r\nhappiness and prosperity into the home. This means an opportunity to\r\nobserve religion, secure education, and earn a living under a reign of law\r\nand order. It is the growth and improvement of the material and spiritual\r\nlife of the Nation. We shall not be able to gain these ends merely by our\r\nown action. If they come at all, it will be because we have been willing to\r\nwork in harmony with the abiding purpose of a Divine Providence.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nCalvin Coolidge\r\nDecember 7, 1926\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congress:\r\n\r\nIn reporting to the Congress the state of the Union, I find it impossible\r\nto characterize it other than one of general peace and prosperity. In some\r\nquarters our diplomacy is vexed with difficult and as yet unsolved\r\nproblems, but nowhere are we met with armed conflict. If some occupations\r\nand areas are not flourishing, in none does there remain any acute chronic\r\ndepression. What the country requires is not so much new policies as a\r\nsteady continuation of those which are already being crowned with such\r\nabundant success. It can not be too often repeated that in common with all\r\nthe world we are engaged in liquidating the war.\r\n\r\nIn the present short session no great amount of new legislation is\r\npossible, but in order to comprehend what is most desirable some survey of\r\nour general situation is necessary. A large amount of time is consumed in\r\nthe passage of appropriation bills. If each Congress in its opening session\r\nwould make appropriations to continue for two years, very much time would\r\nbe saved which could either be devoted to a consideration of the general\r\nneeds of the country or would result in decreasing the work of legislation.\r\nECONOMY\r\n\r\nOur present state of prosperity has been greatly promoted by three\r\nimportant causes, one of which is economy, resulting in reduction and\r\nreform in national taxation. Another is the elimination of many kinds of\r\nwaste. The third is a general raising of the standards of efficiency. This\r\ncombination has brought the perfectly astonishing result of a reduction in\r\nthe index price of commodities and an increase in the index rate of wages.\r\nWe have secured a lowering of the cost to produce and a raising of the\r\nability to consume. Prosperity resulting from these causes rests on the\r\nsecurest of all foundations. It gathers strength from its own progress.\r\n\r\nIn promoting this progress the chief part which the National Government\r\nplays lies in the field of economy. Whatever doubts may have been\r\nentertained as to the necessity of this policy and the beneficial results\r\nwhich would accrue from it to all the people of the Nation, its wisdom must\r\nnow be considered thoroughly demonstrated. It may not have appeared to be a\r\nnovel or perhaps brilliant conception, but it has turned out to be\r\npreeminently sound. It has not failed to work. It has surely brought\r\nresults. It does not have to be excused as a temporary expedient adopted as\r\nthe lesser evil to remedy some abuse, it is not a palliative seeking to\r\ntreat symptoms, but a major operation for the, eradication at the source of\r\na large number of social diseases.\r\n\r\nNothing is easier than the expenditure of public money. It does not appear\r\nto belong to anybody. The temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on\r\nsomebody. But the results of extravagance are ruinous. The property of the\r\ncountry, like the freedom of the country, belongs to the people of the\r\ncountry. They have not empowered their Government to take a dollar of it\r\nexcept for a necessary public purpose. But if the Constitution conferred\r\nsuch right, sound economics would forbid it. Nothing is more, destructive\r\nof the progress of the Nation than government extravagance. It means an\r\nincrease in the burden of taxation, dissipation of the returns from\r\nenterprise, a decrease in the real value of wages, with ultimate stagnation\r\nand decay. The whole theory of our institutions is based on the liberty and\r\nindependence of the individual. He is dependent on himself for support and\r\ntherefore entitled to the rewards of his own industry. He is not to be\r\ndeprived of what he earns that others may be benefited by what they do not\r\nearn. What he saves through his private effort is not to be wasted by\r\nGovernment extravagance.\r\n\r\nOur national activities have become so vast that it is necessary to\r\nscrutinize each item of public expenditure if we are to apply the principle\r\nof economy. At the last session we made an immediate increase in the annual\r\nbudget of more than $100,000,000 in benefits conferred on the veterans of\r\nthree wars, public buildings, and river and harbor improvement. Many\r\nprojects are being broached requiring further large outlays. I am convinced\r\nthat it would be greatly for the welfare of the country if we avoid at the\r\npresent session all commitments except those of the most pressing nature.\r\nFrom a reduction of the debt and taxes will accrue a wider benefit to all\r\nthe people of this country than from embarking on any new enterprise. When\r\nour war debt is decreased we shall have resources for expansion. Until that\r\nis accomplished we should confine ourselves to expenditures of the most\r\nurgent necessity.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Commerce has performed a most important function in\r\nmaking plans and securing support of all kinds of national enterprise for\r\nthe elimination of waste. Efficiency has been greatly promoted through good\r\nmanagement and the constantly increasing cooperation of the wage earners\r\nthroughout the whole realm of private business. It is my opinion that this\r\nwhole development has been predicated on the foundation of a protective\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nTAX REDUCTION\r\n\r\nAs a result of economy of administration by the Executive and of\r\nappropriation by the Congress, the end of this fiscal year will leave a\r\nsurplus in the Treasury estimated at $383,000,000. Unless otherwise\r\nordered, such surplus is used for the retirement of the war debt. A bond\r\nwhich can be retired today for 100 cents will cost the people 104 1/4\r\ncents to retire a year from now. While I favor a speedy reduction of the\r\ndebt as already required by law and in accordance with the promises made to\r\nthe holders of our Liberty bonds when they were issued, there is no reason\r\nwhy a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be applied to a\r\nreduction of taxation. It can not be repeated too often that the enormous\r\nrevenues of this Nation could not be collected without becoming a charge on\r\nall the people whether or not they directly pay taxes. Everyone who is\r\npaying or the bare necessities of fool and shelter and clothing, without\r\nconsidering the better things of life, is indirectly paying a national tax.\r\nThe nearly 20,000,000 owners of securities, the additional scores of\r\nmillions of holders of insurance policies and depositors in savings banks,\r\nare all paying a national tax. Millions of individuals and corporations are\r\nmaking a direct contribution to the National Treasury which runs from 11/2\r\nto 25 per cent of their income, besides a number of special requirements,\r\nlike automobile and admission taxes. Whenever the state of the Treasury\r\nwill permit, I believe in a reduction of taxation. I think the taxpayers\r\nare entitled to it. But I am not advocating tax reduction merely for the\r\nbenefit of the taxpayer; I am advocating it for the benefit of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIf it appeared feasible, I should welcome permanent tax reduction at this\r\ntime. The estimated surplus, however, for June 30, 1928, is not much larger\r\nthan is required in a going business of nearly $4,000,000,000. We have had\r\nbut a few months' experience under the present revenue act and shall need\r\nto know what is developed by the returns of income produced under it, which\r\nare not required t o be made until about the time this session terminates,\r\nand what the economic probabilities of the country are in the latter part\r\nof 1927, before we can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent tax\r\nreduction. Moreover the present surplus results from many nonrecurrent\r\nitems. Meantime, it is possible to grant some real relief by a simple\r\nmeasure making reductions in the payments which accrue on the 15th of March\r\nand June, 1927. I am very strongly of the conviction that this is so much a\r\npurely business matter that it ought not to be dealt with in a partisan\r\nspirit. The Congress has already set the notable example of treating tax\r\nproblems without much reference to party, which might well be continued.\r\nWhat I desire to advocate most earnestly is relief for the country from\r\nunnecessary tax burdens. We can not secure that if we stop to engage in a\r\npartisan controversy. As I do not think any change in the special taxes, or\r\ntiny permanent reduction is practical, I therefore urge both parties of the\r\nHouse Ways and Means Committee to agree on a bill granting the temporary\r\nrelief which I have indicated. Such a reduction would directly affect\r\nmillions of taxpayers, release large sums for investment in new enterprise,\r\nstimulating industrial production and agricultural consumption, and\r\nindirectly benefiting every family in the whole country. These are my\r\nconvictions stated with full knowledge that it is for the Congress to\r\ndecide whether they judge it best to make such a reduction or leave the\r\nsurplus for the present year to be applied to retirement of the war debt.\r\nThat also is eventually tax reduction.\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE TARIFF\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that customs receipts for the present fiscal year will\r\nexceed $615,000,000, the largest which were ever secured from that source.\r\nThe value of our imports for the last fiscal year was $4,466,000,000, an\r\nincrease of more than 71 per cent since the present tariff law went into\r\neffect. Of these imports about 65 per cent, or, roughly, $2,900,000,000,\r\ncame in free of duty, which means that the United States affords a\r\nduty-free market to other countries almost equal in value to the total\r\nimports of Germany and greatly exceeding the total imports of France. We\r\nhave admitted a greater volume of free imports than any other country\r\nexcept England.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, levying duties on about $1,550,000,000 of imports.\r\nNearly half of this, or $700,000,000, is subject to duties for the\r\nprotection of agriculture and have their origin in countries other than\r\nEurope. They substantially increased the prices received by our farmers for\r\ntheir produce. About $300,000.000 more is represented by luxuries such as\r\ncostly rugs, furs, precious stones, etc. This leaves only about\r\n$550,000,000 of our imports under a schedule of duties which is in general\r\nunder consideration when there is discussion of lowering the tariff. While\r\nthe duties on this small portion, representing only about 12 per cent of\r\nour imports, undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair degree of\r\nprosperity or marked depression to many of our industries and the\r\ndifference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many of\r\nour wage earners, it is impossible to conceive how other countries or our\r\nown importers could be greatly benefited if these duties are reduced. Those\r\nwho are starting an agitation for a reduction of tariff duties, partly at\r\nleast for the benefit of those to whom money has been lent abroad, ought to\r\nknow that there does not seem to be a very large field within the area of\r\nour imports in which probable reductions would be advantageous to foreign\r\ngoods. Those who wish to benefit foreign producers are much more likely to\r\nsecure that result by continuing the present enormous purchasing power\r\nwhich comes from our prosperity that increased our imports over 71\r\nper cent in four years than from any advantages that are likely to accrue\r\nfrom a general tariff reduction.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe important place which agriculture holds in the economic and social life\r\nof the Nation can not be overestimated. The National Government is\r\njustified in putting forth every effort to make the open country a\r\ndesirable place to live. No condition meets this requirement which fails to\r\nsupply a fair return on labor expended and capital invested. While some\r\nlocalities and some particular crops furnish exceptions, in general\r\nagriculture is continuing to make progress in recovering from the\r\ndepression of 1921 and 1922. Animal products and food products are in a\r\nmore encouraging position, while cotton, due to the high prices of past\r\nyears supplemented by ideal weather conditions, has been stimulated to a\r\npoint of temporary over production. Acting on the request of the cotton\r\ngrowing interests, appointed a committee to assist in carrying out their\r\nplans. As it result of this cooperation sufficient funds have been pledged\r\nto finance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000 bales of cotton. Whether\r\nthose who own the cotton are willing to put a part of their stock into this\r\nplan depends on themselves. The Federal Government has cooperated in\r\nproviding ample facilities. No method of meeting the situation would be\r\nadequate which does not contemplate a reduction of about one-third in the\r\nacreage for the coming year. The responsibility for making the plan\r\neffective lies with those who own and finance cotton and cotton lands.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture estimates the net income of agriculture for\r\nthe year 1920-21 at only $375,000,000; for 1924-25, $2,656,000,000; for\r\n1925-26, $2,757,000,000. This increase has been brought about in part by\r\nthe method already referred to, of Federal tax reduction, the elimination\r\nof waste, and increased efficiency in industry. The wide gap that existed a\r\nfew years ago between the index price of agricultural products and the\r\nindex price of other products has been gradually closing up, though the\r\nrecent depression in cotton has somewhat enlarged it. Agriculture had on\r\nthe whole been going higher while industry had been growing lower.\r\nIndustrial and commercial activities, being carried on for the most part by\r\ncorporations, are taxed at a much higher rate than farming, which is\r\ncarried on by individuals. This will inevitably make industrial commodity\r\ncosts high while war taxation lasts. It is because of this circumstance\r\nthat national tax reduction has a very large indirect benefit upon the\r\nfarmer, though it can not relieve him from the very great burden of the\r\nlocal taxes which he pays directly. We have practically relieved the farmer\r\nof any Federal income tax.\r\n\r\nThere is agreement on all sides that some portions of our agricultural\r\nindustry have lagged behind other industries in recovery from the war and\r\nthat further improvement in methods of marketing of agricultural products\r\nis most desirable. There is belief also that the Federal Government can\r\nfurther contribute to these ends beyond the many helpful measures taken\r\nduring the last five years through the different acts of Congress for\r\nadvancing the interests of the farmers.\r\n\r\nThe packers and stockyards act,\r\n\r\nEstablishing of the intermediate credit banks for agricultural purposes,\r\n\r\nThe Purnell Act for agricultural research,\r\n\r\nThe Capper-Volstead Cooperative Marketing Act,\r\n\r\nThe cooperative marketing act of 1926,\r\n\r\nAmendments to the warehousing act,\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the activities of the Department of Agriculture,\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the scope of loans by the Farm Loan Board,\r\n\r\nThe tariff on agricultural products,\r\n\r\nThe large Federal expenditure in improvement of waterways and highways,\r\n\r\nThe reduction of Federal taxes, in all comprise a great series of\r\ngovernmental actions in the advancement of the special interest of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIn determination of what further measures may be undertaken it seems to me\r\nthere are certain pitfalls which must be avoided and our test in avoiding\r\nthem should be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself.\r\n\r\nActing upon my recommendation, the Congress has ordered the interstate\r\nCommerce Commission to investigate the freight-rate structure, directing\r\nthat such changes shall be made in freight rates as will promote freedom of\r\nmovement of agricultural products. Railroad consolidation which I am\r\nadvocating would also result in a situation where rates could be made more\r\nadvantageous for farm produce, as has recently been done in the revision of\r\nrates on fertilizers in the South. Additional benefit will accrue from the\r\ndevelopment of our inland waterways. The Mississippi River system carries a\r\ncommerce of over 50,000,000 tons at a saving of nearly $18,000,000\r\nannually. The Inland Waterways Corporation operates boats on 2,500 miles of\r\nnavigable streams and through its relation with 165 railroads carries\r\nfreight into and out of 45 States of the Union. During the past six months\r\nit has handled over 1,000,000 bushels of grain monthly and by its lower\r\nfreight rates has raised the price of such grain to the farmer probably\r\n21/2 cents to 3 cents a bushel. The highway system on which the Federal\r\nGovernment expends about $85,000,000 a year is of vital importance to the\r\nrural regions.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be derived from a more comprehensive and less expensive\r\nsystem of transportation for agriculture ought to be supplemented by\r\nprovision for an adequate supply of fertilizer at a lower cost than it is\r\nat present obtainable. This advantage we are attempting to secure by the\r\nproposed development at Muscle Shoals, and there are promising experiments\r\nbeing made in synthetic chemistry for the production of nitrates.\r\n\r\nA survey should be made of the relation of Government grazing lands to the\r\nlivestock industry. Additional legislation is desirable more definitely to\r\nestablish the place of grazing in the administration of the national\r\nforests, properly subordinated to their functions of producing timber and\r\nconserving the water supply. Over 180,000,000 acres of grazing lands are\r\nstill pastured as commons in the public domain with little or no\r\nregulation. This has made their use so uncertain that it has contributed\r\ngreatly to the instability of the livestock industry. Very little of this\r\nland is suited to settlement or private ownership. Some plan ought to be\r\nadopted for its use in grazing, corresponding broadly to that already\r\nsuccessfully applied to the national forests.\r\n\r\nThe development of sound and strong cooperative associations is of\r\nfundamental importance to our agriculture. It is encouraging to note,\r\ntherefore, that a vigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movement\r\nis continuing. Cooperative associations reporting to the Department of\r\nAgriculture at the end of 1925 had on their membership rolls a total of\r\n2,700,000 producers. Their total business in 1925 amounted to approximately\r\n$2,400,000,000, compared with $635,800,000 in 1915. Legislative action to\r\nassist cooperative associations and supplement their efforts was passed at\r\nthe last session of Congress. Important credit measures were also provided\r\nby Congress in 1923 which have been of inestimable value to the cooperative\r\nassociations. Although the Federal credit agencies have served agriculture\r\nwell, I think it may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service of\r\nthese institutions.\r\n\r\nAttention is again directed to the surplus problem of agriculture by the\r\npresent cotton situation. Surpluses often affect prices of various farm\r\ncommodities in a disastrous manner, and the problem urgently demands a\r\nsolution. Discussions both in and out of Congress during the past few years\r\nhave given us a better understanding of the subject, and it is my hope that\r\nout of the various proposals made the basis will be found for a sound and\r\neffective solution upon which agreement can be reached. In my opinion\r\ncooperative marketing associations will be important aids to the ultimate\r\nsolution of the problem. It may well be, however, that additional measures\r\nwill be needed to supplement their efforts. I believe all will agree that\r\nsuch measures should not conflict with the best interests of the\r\ncooperatives, but rather assist and strengthen them. In working out this\r\nproblem to any sound conclusion it is necessary to avoid putting the\r\nGovernment into the business of production or marketing or attempting to\r\nenact legislation for the purpose of price fixing. The farmer does not\r\nfavor any attempted remedies that partake of these elements. He has a\r\nsincere and candid desire for assistance. If matched by an equally sincere\r\nand candid consideration of the different remedies proposed a sound\r\nmeasure of relief ought to result. It is unfortunate that no general\r\nagreement has been reached by the various agricultural interests upon any\r\nof the proposed remedies. Out of the discussion of various proposals which\r\ncan be had before the Committees of Agriculture some measure ought to be\r\nperfected which would be generally satisfactory.\r\n\r\nDue to the emergency arising from a heavy tropical storm in southern\r\nFlorida, I authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to use certain funds in\r\nanticipation of legislation to enable the farmers in that region to plant\r\ntheir crops. The department will present a bill ratifying the loans which\r\nwere made for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFederal legislation has been adopted authorizing the cooperation of the\r\nGovernment with States and private owners in the protection of forest lands\r\nfrom fire. This preventive measure is of such great importance that I have\r\nrecommended for it an increased appropriation.\r\n\r\nAnother preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance is the\r\neradication of tuberculosis in cattle. Active work is now in progress in\r\none-fourth of the counties of the United States to secure this result. Over\r\n12,000,000 cattle have been under treatment, and the average degree of\r\ninfection has fallen from 4.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent. he Federal\r\nGovernment is making substantial expenditures for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSerious damage is threatened to the corn crop by the European corn borer.\r\nSince 1917 it has spread from eastern New England westward into Indiana and\r\nnow covers about 100,000 square miles. It is one of the most formidable\r\npests because it spreads rapidly and is exceedingly difficult of control.\r\nIt has assumed a menace that is of national magnitude and warrants the\r\nFederal Government in extending its cooperation to the State and local\r\nagencies which are attempting to prevent its further spread and secure its\r\neradication.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of agriculture needs most careful consideration. In the\r\npast few years the Government has given this subject more attention than\r\nany other and has held more consultations in relation to it than on any\r\nother subject. While the Government is not to be blamed for failure to\r\nperform the impossible, the agricultural regions are entitled to know that\r\nthey have its constant solicitude and sympathy. Many of the farmers are\r\nburdened with debts and taxes which they are unable to carry. We are\r\nexpending in this country many millions of dollars each year to increase\r\nfarm production. We ought now to put more emphasis on the question of farm\r\nmarketing. If a sound solution of a permanent nature can be found for this\r\nproblem, the Congress ought not to hesitate to adopt it.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF WATER RESOURCES\r\n\r\nIn previous messages I have referred to the national importance of the\r\nproper development of our water resources. The great projects of extension\r\nof the Mississippi system, the protection an development of the lower\r\nColorado River, are before Congress, and I have previously commented upon\r\nthem. I favor the necessary legislation to expedite these projects.\r\nEngineering studies are being made for connecting the Great Lakes with the\r\nNorth Atlantic either through an all-American canal or by way of the St.\r\nLawrence River. These reports will undoubtedly be before the Congress\r\nduring its present session. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the great\r\nimportance of such a waterway not only to our mid-continental basin but to\r\nthe commerce and development of practically the whole Nation. Our river and\r\nharbor improvement should be continued in accordance with the present\r\npolicy. Expenditure of this character is compatible with economy; it is in\r\nthe nature of capital investment. Work should proceed on the basic trunk\r\nlines if this work is to be a success. If the country will be content to be\r\nmoderate and patient and permit improvements to be made where they will do\r\nthe greatest general good, rather than insisting on expenditures at this\r\ntime on secondary projects, our internal Waterways can be made a success.\r\nIf proposes legislation results in a gross manifestation of local\r\njealousies and selfishness, this program can not be carried out. Ultimately\r\nwe can take care of extensions, but our first effort should be confined to\r\nthe main arteries.\r\n\r\nOur inland commerce has been put to great inconvenience and expense by\r\nreason of the lowering of the water level of the Great Lakes. This is an\r\ninternational problem on which competent engineers are making reports. Out\r\nof their study it is expected that a feasible method will be developed for\r\nraising the level to provide relief for our commerce and supply water for\r\ndrainage. Whenever a practical plan is presented it ought to be speedily\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION\r\n\r\nIt is increasingly evident that the Federal Government must in the future\r\ntake a leading part in the impounding of water for conservation with\r\nincidental power for the development of the irrigable lands of the and\r\nregion. The unused waters of the West are found mainly in large rivers.\r\nWorks to store and distribute these have such magnitude and cost that they\r\nare not attractive to private enterprise. Water is the irreplaceable\r\nnatural resource. Its precipitation can not be increased. Its storage on\r\nthe higher reaches of streams, to meet growing needs, to be used repeatedly\r\nas it flows toward the seas, is a practical and prudent business policy.\r\n\r\nThe United States promises to follow the course of older irrigation\r\ncountries, where recent important irrigation developments have been carried\r\nout as national undertakings. It is gratifying, therefore, that conditions\r\non Federal reclamation projects have become satisfactory. The gross value\r\nof crop, grown with water from project works increased from $110,000,000\r\nin 1924 to $131,000,000 in 1925. The adjustments made last year by Congress\r\nrelieved irrigators from paying construction costs on unprofitable land,\r\nand by so doing inspired new hope and confidence in ability to meet the\r\npayments required. Construction payments by water users last year were the\r\nlargest in the history of the bureau.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated reclamation fund will be fully absorbed for a number of\r\nyears in the completion of old projects and the construction of projects\r\ninaugurated in the past three years. We should, however, continue to\r\ninvestigate and study the possibilities of a carefully planned development\r\nof promising projects, logically of governmental concern because of their\r\nphysical magnitude, immense cost, and the interstate and international\r\nproblems involved. Only in this way may we be fully prepared to meet\r\nintelligently the needs of our fast-growing population in the years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contributes\r\nmore to the necessities and conveniences of life than transportation.\r\nWithout it our present agricultural production and practically all of our\r\ncommerce would be completely prostrated. One of the large contributing\r\ncauses to the present highly satisfactory state of our economic condition\r\nis the prompt and dependable service, surpassing all our previous records,\r\nrendered by the railroads. This power has been fostered by the spirit of\r\ncooperation between Federal and State regulatory commissions. To render\r\nthis service more efficient and effective and to promote a more scientific\r\nregulation, the process of valuing railroad properties should be simplified\r\nand the primary valuations should be completed as rapidly as possible. The\r\nproblem of rate reduction would be much simplified by a process of railroad\r\nconsolidations. This principle has already been adopted as Federal law.\r\nExperience has shown that a more effective method must be provided. Studies\r\nhave already been made and legislation introduced seeking to promote this\r\nend. It would be of great advantage if it could be taken up at once and\r\nspeedily enacted. The railroad systems of the country and the convenience\r\nof all the people are waiting on this important decision.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT MARINE\r\n\r\nIt is axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get the\r\nfull benefit of its own advantages without a merchant marine. We have been\r\nproceeding under the act of Congress that contemplates the establishment of\r\ntrade routes to be ultimately transferred to private ownership and\r\noperation. Due to temporary conditions abroad and at home we have a large\r\ndemand just now for certain types of freight vessels. Some suggestion has\r\nbeen made for new construction. I do not feel that we are yet warranted in\r\nentering, that field. Such ships as we might build could not be sold after\r\nthey are launched for anywhere near what they would cost. We have expended\r\nover $250,000,000 out of the public Treasury in recent years to make up the\r\nlosses of operation, not counting the depreciation or any cost whatever of\r\nour capital investment. The great need of our merchant marine is not for\r\nmore ships but for more freight.\r\n\r\nOur merchants are altogether too indifferent about using American ships for\r\nthe transportation of goods which they send abroad or bring home. Some of\r\nour vessels necessarily need repairs, which should be made. I do not\r\nbelieve that the operation of our fleet is as economical and efficient as\r\nit could be made if placed under a single responsible head, leaving the\r\nShipping Board free to deal with general matters of policy and regulation.\r\n\r\nRADIO LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThe Department of Commerce has for some years urgently presented the\r\nnecessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listeners from\r\ninterference between broadcasting stations and to carry out other\r\nregulatory functions. Both branches of Congress at the last session passed\r\nenactments intended to effect such regulation, but the two bills yet remain\r\nto be brought into agreement and final passage.\r\n\r\nDue to decisions of the courts, the authority of the department under the\r\nlaw of 1912 has broken down; many more stations have been operating than\r\ncan be accommodated within the limited number of wave lengths available;\r\nfurther stations are in course of construction; many stations have departed\r\nfrom the scheme of allocation set down by the department, and the whole\r\nservice of this most important public function has drifted into such chaos\r\nas seems likely, if not remedied, to destroy its great value. I most\r\nurgently recommend that this legislation should be speedily enacted.\r\n\r\nI do not believe it is desirable to set up further independent agencies in\r\nthe Government. Rather I believe it advisable to entrust the important\r\nfunctions of deciding who shall exercise the privilege of radio\r\ntransmission and under what conditions, the assigning of wave lengths and\r\ndetermination of power, to a board to be assembled whenever action on such\r\nquestions becomes necessary. There should be right of appeal to the courts\r\nfrom the decisions of such board. The administration of the decisions of\r\nthe board and the other features of regulation and promotion of radio in\r\nthe public interest, together with scientific research, should remain in\r\nthe Department of Commerce. Such an arrangement makes for more expert, more\r\nefficient, and more economical administration that an independent agency or\r\nboard, whose duties, after initial stages, require but little attention, in\r\nwhich administrative functions are confused with semijudicial functions and\r\nfrom which of necessity there must be greatly increased personnel and\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nTHE WAGE EARNER\r\n\r\nThe great body of our people are made up of wage earners. Several hundred\r\nthousands of them are on the pay rolls of the United States Government.\r\nTheir condition very largely is fixed by legislation. We have recently\r\nprovided increases in compensation under a method of reclassification and\r\ngiven them the advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support for\r\ntheir declining years. Most of them are under the merit system, which is a\r\nguaranty of their intelligence, and the efficiency of their service is a\r\ndemonstration of their loyalty. The Federal Government should continue to\r\nset a good example for all other employers.\r\n\r\nIn the industries the condition of the wage earner has steadily improved.\r\nThe 12-hour day is almost entirely unknown. Skilled labor is well\r\ncompensated. But there are unfortunately a multitude of workers who have\r\nnot yet come to share in the general prosperity of the Nation. Both the\r\npublic authorities and private enterprise should be solicitous to advance\r\nthe welfare of this class. The Federal Government has been seeking to\r\nsecure this end through a protective tariff, through restrictive\r\nimmigration, through requiring safety devices for the prevention of\r\naccidents, through the granting of workman's compensation, through civilian\r\nvocational rehabilitation and education, through employment information\r\nbureaus, and through such humanitarian relief as was provided in the\r\nmaternity and infancy legislation. It is a satisfaction to report that a\r\nmore general condition of contentment exists among wage earners and the\r\ncountry is more free from labor disputes than it has been for years. While\r\nrestrictive immigration has been adopted in part for the benefit of the\r\nwage earner, and in its entirety for the benefit of the country, it ought\r\nnot to cause a needless separation of families and dependents from their\r\nnatural source of support contrary to the dictates of humanity.\r\n\r\nBITUMINOUS COAL\r\n\r\nNo progress appears to have been made within large areas of the bituminous\r\ncoal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which greater\r\nassurance can be given to the public of peaceful adjustment of wage\r\ndifficulties such as has been accomplished in the anthracite industry. This\r\nbituminous industry is one of primary necessity and bears a great\r\nresponsibility to the Nation for continuity of supplies. As the wage\r\nagreements in the unionized section of the industry expire on April 1 next,\r\nand as conflicts may result which may imperil public interest, and have for\r\nmany years often called for action of the Executive in protection of the\r\npublic, I again recommend the passage of such legislation as will assist\r\nthe Executive in dealing with such emergencies through a special temporary\r\nboard of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agencies for\r\nthe purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumers of coal\r\nfrom profiteering. At present the Executive is not only without authority\r\nto act but is actually prohibited by law from making any expenditure to\r\nmeet the emergency of a coal famine.\r\n\r\nJUDICIARY\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts hold a high position in the administration of justice in\r\nthe world. While individual judicial officers have sometimes been subjected\r\nto just criticism, the courts as a whole have maintained an exceedingly\r\nhigh standard. The Congress may well consider the question of supplying\r\nfair salaries and conferring upon the Supreme Court the same rule-making\r\npower on the law side of the district courts that they have always\r\npossessed on the equity side. A bill is also pending providing for\r\nretirement after a certain number of years of service, although they have\r\nnot been consecutive, which should have your favorable consideration. These\r\nfaithful servants of the Government are about the last that remain to be\r\nprovided for in the postwar readjustments.\r\n\r\nBANKING\r\n\r\nThere has been pending in Congress for nearly three years banking\r\nlegislation to clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase the\r\npowers of the national banks. I believe that within the limitation of sound\r\nbanking principles Congress should now and for the future place the\r\nnational banks upon a fair equality with their competitors, the State\r\nbanks, and I trust that means may be found so that the differences on\r\nbranch-banking legislation between the Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives may be settled along sound lines and the legislation\r\npromptly enacted.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to overestimate the service which the Federal reserve\r\nsystem has already rendered to the country. It is necessary only to recall\r\nthe chaotic condition of our banking organization at the time the Federal\r\nreserve system was put into operation. The old system consisted of a vast\r\nnumber of independent banking units, with scattered bank reserves which\r\nnever could be mobilized in times of greatest need. In spite of vast\r\nbanking resources, there was no coordination of reserves or any credit\r\nelasticity. As a consequence, a strain was felt even during crop-moving\r\nperiods and when it was necessary to meet other seasonal and regularly\r\nrecurring needs.\r\n\r\nThe Federal reserve system is not a panacea for all economic or financial\r\nills. It can not prevent depression in certain industries which are\r\nexperiencing overexpansion of production or contraction of their markets.\r\nIts business is to furnish adequate credit and currency facilities. This it\r\nhas succeeded in doing, both during the war and in the more difficult\r\nperiod of deflation and readjustment which followed. It enables us to look\r\nto the future with confidence and to make plans far ahead, based on the\r\nbelief that the Federal reserve system will exercise a steadying influence\r\non credit conditions and thereby prevent tiny sudden or severe reactions\r\nfrom the period of prosperity which we are now enjoying. In order that\r\nthese plans may go forward, action should be taken at the present session\r\non the question of renewing the banks' charters and thereby insuring a\r\ncontinuation of the policies and present usefulness of the Federal reserve\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL REGULATION\r\n\r\nI am in favor of reducing, rather than expanding, Government bureaus which\r\nseek to regulate and control the business activities of the people.\r\nEveryone is aware that abuses exist and will exist so long as we are\r\nlimited by human imperfections. Unfortunately, human nature can not be\r\nchanged by an act of the legislature. When practically the sole remedy for\r\nmany evils lies in the necessity of the people looking out for themselves\r\nand reforming their own abuses, they will find that they are relying on a\r\nfalse security if the Government assumes to hold out the promise that it is\r\nlooking out for them and providing reforms for them. This principle is\r\npreeminently applicable to the National Government. It is too much assumed\r\nthat because an abuse exists it is the business of the National Government\r\nto provide a remedy. The presumption should be that it is the business of\r\nlocal and State governments. Such national action results in encroaching\r\nupon the salutary independence of the States and by undertaking to\r\nsupersede their natural authority fills the land with bureaus and\r\ndepartments which are undertaking to do what it is impossible for them to\r\naccomplish and brings our whole system of government into disrespect and\r\ndisfavor. We ought to maintain high standards. We ought to punish\r\nwrongdoing. Society has not only the privilege but the absolute duty of\r\nprotecting itself and its individuals. But we can not accomplish this end\r\nby adopting a wrong method. Permanent success lies in local, rather than\r\nnational action. Unless the locality rises to its own requirements, there\r\nis an almost irresistible impulse for the National Government to intervene.\r\nThe States and the Nation should both realize that such action is to be\r\nadopted only as a last resort.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO\r\n\r\nThe social well-being of our country requires our constant effort for the\r\namelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all elements of equal\r\nopportunity and equal protection under the laws which are guaranteed by\r\nthe. Constitution. The Federal Government especially is charged with this\r\nobligation in behalf of the colored people of the Nation. Not only their\r\nremarkable progress, their devotion and their loyalty, but, our duty to\r\nourselves under our claim that we are an enlightened people requires us to\r\nuse all our power to protect them from the crime of lynching. Although\r\nviolence of this kind has very much decreased, while any of it remains we\r\ncan not justify neglecting to make every effort to eradicate it by law.\r\n\r\nThe education of the colored race under Government encouragement is\r\nproceeding successfully and ought to have continuing support. An increasing\r\nneed exists for properly educated and trained medical skill to be devoted\r\nto the service of this race.\r\n\r\nINSULAR POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\nThis Government holds in sacred trusteeship islands which it has acquired\r\nin the East and West Indies. In all of them the people are more prosperous\r\nthan at any previous time. A system of good roads, education, and general\r\ndevelopment is in progress. The people are better governed than ever before\r\nand generally content.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippine Islands Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood has been Governor General\r\nfor five years and has administered his office with tact and ability\r\ngreatly to the success of the Filipino people. These are a proud and\r\nsensitive race, who are making such progress with our cooperation that we\r\ncan view the results of this experiment with great satisfaction. As we are\r\nattempting to assist this race toward self-government, we should look upon\r\ntheir wishes with great respect, granting their requests immediately when\r\nthey are right, yet maintaining a frank firmness in refusing when they are\r\nwrong. We shall measure their progress in no small part by their acceptance\r\nof the terms of the organic law under which the islands are governed and\r\ntheir faithful observance of its provisions. Need exists for clarifying the\r\nduties of the auditor and declaring them to be what everyone had supposed\r\nthey were. We have placed our own expenditures under the supervision of the\r\nComptroller General. It is not likely that the expenditures in the\r\nPhilippine Islands need less supervision than our own. The Governor General\r\nis hampered in his selection of subordinates by the necessity of securing a\r\nconfirmation, which has oftentimes driven him to the expediency of using\r\nArmy officers in work for which civilian experts would be much better\r\nfitted. Means should be provided for this and such other purposes as he may\r\nrequire out of the revenue which this Government now turns back to the\r\nPhilippine treasury.\r\n\r\nIn order that these possessions might stiffer no seeming neglect, I have\r\nrecently sent Col. Carmi A. Thompson to the islands to make a survey in\r\ncooperation with the Governor General to suggest what might be done to\r\nimprove conditions. Later, I may make a more extended report including\r\nrecommendations. The economic development of the islands is very important.\r\nThey ought not to be turned back to the people until they are both\r\npolitically fitted for self-government and economically independent. Large\r\nareas are adaptable to the production of rubber. No one contemplates any\r\ntime in the future either under the present or a more independent form of\r\ngovernment when we should not assume some responsibility for their defense.\r\nFor their economic advantage, for the employment of their people, and as a\r\ncontribution to our power of defense which could not be carried on without\r\nrubber, I believe this industry should be encouraged. It is especially\r\nadapted to the Filipino people themselves, who might cultivate it\r\nindividually on a small acreage. It could be carried on extensively by\r\nAmerican capital in a way to furnish employment at good wages. I am opposed\r\nto the promotion of any policy that does not provide for absolute freedom\r\non the part of the wage earners and do not think we should undertake to\r\ngive power for large holdings of land in the islands against the opposition\r\nof the people of the locality. Any development of the islands must be\r\nsolely with the first object of benefiting the people of the islands. At an\r\nearly day, these possessions should be taken out from under all military\r\ncontrol and administered entirely on the civil side of government.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nOur policy of national defense is not one of making war, but of insuring\r\npeace. The land and sea force of America, both in its domestic and foreign\r\nimplications, is distinctly a peace force. It is an arm of the police power\r\nto guarantee order and the execution of the law at home and security to our\r\ncitizens abroad. No self-respecting nation would neglect to provide an army\r\nand navy proportionate to its population, the extent of its territory, and\r\nthe dignity of the place which it occupies in the world. When it is\r\nconsidered that no navy in the world, with one exception, approaches ours\r\nand none surpasses it, that our Regular Army of about 115,000 men is the\r\nequal of any other like number of troops, that our entire permanent and\r\nreserve land and sea force trained and training consists of a personnel of\r\nabout 610,000, and that our annual appropriations are about $680,000,000 a\r\nyear, expended under the direction of an exceedingly competent staff, it\r\ncan not be said that our country is neglecting its national defense. It is\r\ntrue that a cult of disparagement exists, but that candid examination made\r\nby the Congress through its various committees has always reassured the\r\ncountry and demonstrated that it is maintaining the most adequate defensive\r\nforces in these present years that it has ever supported in time of peace.\r\n\r\nThis general policy should be kept in effect. Here and there temporary\r\nchanges may be made in personnel to meet requirements in other directions.\r\nAttention should be given to submarines, cruisers, and air forces.\r\nParticular points may need strengthening, but as a whole our military power\r\nis sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe one weak place in the whole line is our still stupendous war debt. In\r\nany modern campaign the dollars are the shock troops. With a depleted\r\ntreasury in the rear, no army can maintain itself in the field. A country\r\nloaded with debt is a country devoid of the first line of defense. Economy\r\nis the handmaid of preparedness. If we wish to be able to defend ourselves\r\nto the full extent of our power in the future, we shall discharge as soon\r\nas possible the financial burden of the last war. Otherwise we would face a\r\ncrisis with a part of our capital resources already expended.\r\n\r\nThe amount and kind of our military equipment is preeminently a question\r\nfor the decision of the Congress, after giving due consideration to the\r\nadvice of military experts and the available public revenue. Nothing is\r\nmore laudable than the cooperation of the agricultural and industrial\r\nresources of the country for the purpose of supplying the needs of national\r\ndefense. In time of peril the people employed in these interests\r\nvolunteered in a most self-sacrificing way, often at the nominal charge of\r\na dollar a year. But the Army and Navy are not supported for the benefit of\r\nsupply concerns; supply concerns are supported for the benefit of the Army\r\nand Navy. The distribution of orders on what is needed from different\r\nconcerns for the purpose of keeping up equipment and organization is\r\nperfectly justified, but any attempt to prevail upon the Government to\r\npurchase beyond its needs ought not to be tolerated. It is eminently fair\r\nthat those who deal with the Government should do so at a reasonable\r\nprofit. However, public money is expended not that some one may profit by\r\nit, but in order to serve a public purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile our policy of national defense will proceed in order that we may be\r\nindependent and self-sufficient, I am opposed to engaging in any attempt at\r\ncompetitive armaments. No matter how much or how little some other country\r\nmay feel constrained to provide, we can well afford to set the example, not\r\nof being dictated to by others, but of adopting our own standards. We are\r\nstrong enough to pursue that method, which will be a most wholesome model\r\nfor the rest of the world. We are eminently peaceful, but we are by no\r\nmeans weak. While we submit our differences with others, not to the\r\nadjudication of force, but of reason, it is not because we are unable to\r\ndefend our rights. While we are doing our best to eliminate all resort to\r\nwar for the purpose of settling disputes, we can not but remember that the\r\npeace we now enjoy had to be won by the sword and that if the rights of our\r\ncountry are to be defended we can not rely for that purpose upon anyone but\r\nourselves. We can not shirk the responsibility, which is the first\r\nrequisite of all government, of preserving its own integrity and\r\nmaintaining the rights of its own citizens. It is only in accordance with\r\nthese principles that we can establish any lasting foundations for an\r\nhonorable and permanent peace.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that our country, like any other country, proposes\r\nto provide itself with an army and navy supported by a merchant marine. Yet\r\nthese are not for competition with any other power. For years we have\r\nbesought nations to disarm. We have recently expressed our willingness at\r\nGeneva to enter into treaties for the limitation of all types of warships\r\naccording to the ratio adopted at the Washington Conference. This offer is\r\nstill pending. While we are and shall continue to be armed it is not as a\r\nmenace, but rather a common assurance of tranquility to all the peaceloving\r\npeople of the world. For us to do any less would be to disregard our\r\nobligations, evade our responsibilities, and jeopardize our national honor.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nThis country, not only because it is bound by honor but because of the\r\nsatisfaction derived from it, has always lavished its bounty upon its\r\nveterans. For years a service pension has been bestowed upon the Grand Army\r\non reaching a certain age. Like provision has been made for the survivors\r\nof the Spanish War. A liberal future compensation has been granted to all\r\nthe veterans of the World War. But it is in the case of the, disabled and\r\nthe dependents that the Government exhibits its greatest solicitude. This\r\nwork is being well administered by the Veterans' Bureau. The main\r\nunfinished feature is that of hospitalization. This requirement is being\r\nrapidly met. Various veteran bodies will present to you recommendations\r\nwhich should have your careful consideration. At the last session we\r\nincreased our annual expenditure for pensions and relief on account of the\r\nveterans of three wars. While I approve of proper relief for all suffering,\r\nI do not favor any further extension of our pension system at this time.\r\n\r\nALIEN PROPERTY\r\n\r\nWe still have in the possession of the Government the alien property. It\r\nhas always been the policy of America to hold that private enemy property\r\nshould not be confiscated in time of war. This principle we have\r\nscrupulously observed. As this property is security for the claims of our\r\ncitizens and our Government, we can not relinquish it without adequate\r\nprovision for their reimbursement. Legislation for the return of this\r\nproperty, accompanied by suitable provisions for the liquidation of the\r\nclaims of our citizens and our Treasury, should be adopted. If our\r\nGovernment releases to foreigners the security which it holds for\r\nAmericans, it must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguards for\r\nmeeting American claims.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe duly authorized public authorities of this country have made\r\nprohibition the law of the land. Acting under the Constitution the Congress\r\nand the legislatures of practically all the, States have adopted\r\nlegislation for its enforcement. Some abuses have arisen which require\r\nreform. Under the law the National Government has entrusted to the Treasury\r\nDepartment the especial duty of regulation and enforcement. Such\r\nsupplementary legislation as it requires to meet existing conditions should\r\nbe carefully and speedily enacted. Failure to support the Constitution and\r\nobserve the law ought not to be tolerated by public opinion. Especially\r\nthose in public places, who have taken their oath to support the\r\nConstitution, ought to be most scrupulous in its observance. Officers of\r\nthe Department of Justice throughout the country should be vigilant in\r\nenforcing the law, but local authorities, which had always been mainly\r\nresponsible for the enforcement of law in relation to intoxicating liquor,\r\nought not to seek evasion by attempting to shift the burden wholly upon the\r\nFederal agencies. Under the Constitution the States are jointly charged\r\nwith the Nation in providing for the enforcement of the prohibition\r\namendment. Some people do not like the amendment, some do not like other\r\nparts of the Constitution, some do not like any of it. Those who entertain\r\nsuch sentiments have a perfect right to seek through legal methods for a\r\nchange. But for any of our inhabitants to observe such parts of the\r\nConstitution as they like, while disregarding others, is a doctrine that\r\nwould break down all protection of life and property and destroy the\r\nAmerican system of ordered liberty.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of this Government is well known. It is one of peace\r\nbased on that mutual respect that arises from mutual regard for\r\ninternational rights and the discharge of international obligations. It is\r\nour purpose to promote understanding and good will between ourselves and\r\nall other people. The American people are altogether lacking in an\r\nappreciation of the tremendous good fortune that surrounds their\r\ninternational position. We have no traditional enemies. We are not\r\nembarrassed over any disputed territory. We have no possessions that are\r\ncoveted by others; they have none that are coveted by us. Our borders are\r\nunfortified. We fear no one; no one fears us. All the world knows that the\r\nwhole extent of our influence is against war and in favor of peace, against\r\nthe use of force and in favor of negotiation, arbitration, and adjudication\r\nas a method of adjusting international differences. We look with disfavor\r\nupon all aggressive warfare. We are strong enough so that no one can charge\r\nus with weakness if we are slow to anger. Our place is sufficiently\r\nestablished so that we need not be sensitive over trifles. Our resources,\r\nare large enough so that we can afford to be generous. At the same time we\r\nare a nation among nations and recognize a responsibility not only to\r\nourselves, but in the interests of a stable and enlightened civilization,\r\nto protect and defend the international rights of our Government and our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIt is because of our historical detachment and the generations of\r\ncomparative indifference toward it by other nations that our public is\r\ninclined to consider altogether too seriously the reports that we are\r\ncriticized abroad. We never had a larger foreign trade than at the present\r\ntime. Our good offices were never more sought and the necessity for our\r\nassistance and cooperation was never more universally declared in any time\r\nof peace. We know that the sentiments which we entertain toward all other\r\nnations are those of the most sincere friendship and good will and of all\r\nunbounded desire to help, which we are perfectly willing to have judged by\r\ntheir fruits. In our efforts to adjust our international obligations we\r\nhave met with a response which, when everything is considered, I believe\r\nhistory will record as a most remarkable and gratifying demonstration of\r\nthe sanctity with which civilized nations undertake to discharge their\r\nmutual obligations. Debt settlements have been negotiated with practically\r\nall of those who owed us and all finally adjusted but two, which are, in\r\nprocess of ratification. When we consider the real sacrifice that will be\r\nnecessary on the part of other nations, considering all their\r\ncircumstances, to meet their agreed payments, we ought to hold them in\r\nincreased admiration and respect. It is true that we have extended to them\r\nvery generous treatment, but it is also true that they have agreed to repay\r\nits all that we loaned to them and some interest.\r\n\r\nA special conference on the Chinese customs tariff provided for by the\r\ntreaty between the nine powers relating to the Chinese customs tariff\r\nsigned at Washington on February 6, 1922, was called by the Chinese\r\nGovernment to meet at Peking, on October 26, 1925. We participated in this\r\nconference through fully empowered delegates and, with good will,\r\nendeavored to cooperate with the other participating powers with a view to\r\nputting into effect promises made to China at the Washington conference,\r\nand considering any reasonable proposal that might be made by the Chinese\r\nGovernment for the revision of the treaties on the subject of China's\r\ntariff. With these aims in view the American delegation at the outset of\r\nthe conference proposed to put into effect the surtaxes provided for by the\r\nWashington treaty and to proceed immediately to the negotiation of a\r\ntreaty, which, among other things, was to make provision for the abolition\r\nof taxes collected on goods in transit, remove the tariff restrictions in\r\nexisting treaties, and put into effect the national tariff law of China.\r\n\r\nEarly in April of the present year the central Chinese Government was\r\nousted from power by opposing warring factions. It became impossible under\r\nthe circumstances to continue the negotiations. Finally, on July 3, the\r\ndelegates of the foreign powers, including those of the United States,\r\nissued a statement expressing their unanimous and earnest desire to proceed\r\nwith the work of the conference at the earliest possible moment when the\r\ndelegates of the Chinese Government are in a position to resume discussions\r\nwith the foreign delegates of the problems before the conference. We are\r\nprepared to resume the negotiations thus interrupted whenever a Government\r\nrepresenting the Chinese people and acting on their behalf presents itself.\r\nThe fact that constant warfare between contending Chinese factions has\r\nrendered it impossible to bring these negotiations to a successful\r\nconclusion is a matter of deep regret. Throughout these conflicts we have\r\nmaintained a position of the most careful neutrality. Our naval vessels in\r\nAsiatic waters, pursuant to treaty rights, have been used only for the\r\nprotection of American citizens.\r\n\r\nSilas H. Strawn, Esq., was sent to China as American commissioner to\r\ncooperate with commissioners of the other powers in the establishment of a\r\ncommission to inquire into the present practice of extraterritorial\r\njurisdiction in China, with a view to reporting to the Governments of the\r\nseveral powers their findings of fact in regard to these matters. The\r\ncommission commenced its work in January, 1926, and agreed upon a joint\r\nreport which was signed on September 16, 1926. The commission's report has\r\nbeen received and is being studied with a view to determining our future\r\npolicy in regard to the question of extraterritorial privileges under\r\ntreaties between the United States and China.\r\n\r\nThe Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference met at Geneva on\r\nMay 18 and its work has been proceeding almost continuously since that\r\ndate. It would be premature to attempt to form a judgment as to the\r\nprogress that has been made. The commission has had before it a\r\ncomprehensive list of questions touching upon all aspects of the question\r\nof the limitation of armament. In the commission's discussions many\r\ndifferences of opinion have developed. However, I am hopeful that at least\r\nsome measure of agreement will be reached as the discussions continue. The\r\nAmerican representation on the commission has consistently tried to be\r\nhelpful, and has kept before it the practical objective to which the\r\ncommission is working, namely, actual agreements for the limitation of\r\narmaments. Our representatives will continue their work in that direction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most encouraging features of the commission's work thus far has\r\nbeen the agreement in principle among the naval experts of a majority of\r\nthe powers parties to the Washington treaty limiting naval armament upon\r\nmethods and standards for the comparison and further limitation of naval\r\narmament. It is needless to say that at the proper time I shall be prepared\r\nto proceed along practical lines to the conclusion of agreements carrying\r\nfurther the work begun at the Washington Conference in 1921.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT REPORTS\r\n\r\nMany important subjects which it is impossible even to mention in the short\r\nspace of an annual message you will find fully discussed in the\r\ndepartmental reports. A failure to include them here is not to be taken as\r\nindicating any lack of interest, but only a disinclination to state\r\ninadequately what has been much better done in other documents.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITAL CITY\r\n\r\nWe are embarking on an ambitious building program for the city of\r\nWashington. The Memorial Bridge is under way with all that it holds for use\r\nand beauty. New buildings are soon contemplated. This program should\r\nrepresent the best that exists in the art and science of architecture. Into\r\nthese structures which must be considered as of a permanent nature ought to\r\ngo the aspirations of the Nation, its ideals expressed in forms of beauty.\r\nIf our country wishes to compete with others, let it not be in the support\r\nof armaments but in the making of a beautiful capital city. Let it express\r\nthe soul of America. Whenever an American is at the seat of his Government,\r\nhowever traveled and cultured he may be, he ought to find a city of stately\r\nproportion, symmetrically laid out and adorned with the best that there is\r\nin architecture, which would arouse his imagination and stir his patriotic\r\npride. In the coming years Washington should be not only the art center of\r\nour own country but the art center of the world. Around it should center\r\nall that is best in science, in learning, in letters, and in art. These are\r\nthe results that justify the creation of those national resources with\r\nwhich we have been favored.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN IDEALS\r\n\r\nAmerica is not and must not be a country without ideals. They are useless\r\nif they are only visionary; they are only valuable if they are practical. A\r\nnation can not dwell constantly on the mountain tops. It has to be\r\nreplenished and sustained through the ceaseless toil of the less inspiring\r\nvalleys. But its face ought always to be turned upward, its vision ought\r\nalways to be fixed on high.\r\n\r\nWe need ideals that can be followed in daily life, that can be translated\r\ninto terms of the home. We can not expect to be relieved from toil, but we\r\ndo expect to divest it of degrading conditions. Work is honorable; it is\r\nentitled to an honorable recompense. We must strive mightily, but having\r\nstriven there is a defect in our political and social system if we are not\r\nin general rewarded with success. To relieve the land of the burdens that\r\ncame from the war, to release to the individual more of the fruits of his\r\nown industry, to increase his earning capacity and decrease his hours of\r\nlabor, to enlarge the circle of his vision through good roads and better\r\ntransportation, to lace before him the opportunity for education both in\r\nscience and in art, to leave him free to receive the inspiration of\r\nreligion, all these are ideals which deliver him from the servitude of the\r\nbody and exalt him to the service of the soul. Through this emancipation\r\nfrom the things that are material, we broaden our dominion over the things\r\nthat are spiritual.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nCalvin Coolidge\r\nDecember 6, 1927\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congress:\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to report that for the fourth consecutive year the state\r\nof the Union in general is good. We are at peace. The country as a whole\r\nhas had a prosperity never exceeded. Wages are at their highest range,\r\nemployment is plentiful. Some parts of agriculture and industry have\r\nlagged; some localities have suffered from storm and flood. But such losses\r\nhave been absorbed without serious detriment to our great economic\r\nstructure. Stocks of goods are moderate and a wholesome caution is\r\nprevalent. Rates of interest for industry, agriculture, and government have\r\nbeen reduced. Savers and investors are providing capital for new\r\nconstruction in industry and public works. The purchasing power of\r\nagriculture has increased. If the people maintain that confidence which\r\nthey are entitled to have in themselves, in each other, and in America, a\r\ncomfortable prosperity will continue.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMY\r\n\r\nWithout constructive economy in Government expenditures we should not now\r\nbe enjoying these results or these prospects. Because we are not now\r\nphysically at war, some people are disposed to forget that our war debt\r\nstill remains. The Nation must make financial sacrifices, accompanied by a\r\nstern self-denial in public expenditures, until we have conquered the\r\ndisabilities of our public finance. While our obligation to veterans and\r\ndependents is large and continuing, the heavier burden of the national debt\r\nis being steadily eliminated. At the end of this fiscal year it will be\r\nreduced from about $26,600,000,000 to about $17,975,000,000. Annual\r\ninterest, including war savings, will have been reduced from $1,055,000,000\r\nto $670,0001,000. The sacrifices of the people, the economy of the\r\nGovernment, are showing remarkable results. They should be continued for\r\nthe purpose of relieving the Nation of the burden of interest and debt and\r\nreleasing revenue for internal improvements and national development.\r\n\r\nNot only the amount, but the rate, of Government interest has been reduced.\r\nCallable bonds have been refunded and paid, so that during this year the\r\naverage rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fell\r\nbelow 4 per cent. Keeping the credit of the Nation high is a tremendously\r\nprofitable operation.\r\n\r\nTAX REDUCTION\r\n\r\nThe immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is tax\r\nreduction. The annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is\r\n$212,000,000. Without this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worth\r\nproposing. The three measures already enacted leave our Government revenues\r\nwhere they are not oppressive. Exemptions, have been increased until\r\n115,000,000 people make but 2,500,000 individual taxable returns, so that\r\nfurther reduction should be mainly for the purpose of removing\r\ninequalities. The Secretary of the Treasury has recommended a measure which\r\nwould give us a much better balanced system of taxation and without\r\noppression produce sufficient revenue. It has my complete support.\r\n\r\nUnforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising. Our probable\r\nsurplus for June 30, 1929, is small. A slight depression in business would\r\ngreatly reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation. The\r\npeople ought to take no selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderate\r\nand fair taxes which might produce a deficit. We must keep our budget\r\nbalanced for each year. That is the corner stone of our national credit,\r\nthe trifling price we pay to command the lowest rate of interest of any\r\ngreat power in the world. Any surplus can be applied to debt reduction, and\r\ndebt reduction is tax reduction. Under the present circumstances it would\r\nbe far better to leave the rates as they are than to enact a bill carrying\r\nthe peril of a deficit. This is not a problem to be approached in a narrow\r\nor partisan spirit. All of those who participate in finding a reasonable\r\nsolution will be entitled to participate in any credit that accrues from it\r\nwithout regard to party. The Congress has already demonstrated that tax\r\nlegislation can be removed from purely political consideration into the\r\nrealm of patriotic business principles.\r\n\r\nAny bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsible\r\nfor raising, managing, and expending the finances of the Government. If\r\nspecial interests, too often selfish, always uninformed of the national\r\nneeds as a whole, with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as\r\nengines of propaganda, are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their\r\nproperty from taxation, we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust,\r\nbad for business, bad for the country, probably resulting in a deficit,\r\nwith disastrous financial Consequences. The Constitution has given the\r\nMembers of the Congress sole authority to decide what tax measures shall be\r\npresented for approval. While welcoming information from any quarter, the\r\nCongress should continue to exercise its own judgment in a matter so vital\r\nand important to all the interests of the country as taxation.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nBeing a nation relying not on force, but on fair dealing and good will, to\r\nmaintain peace with others, we have provided a moderate military force in a\r\nform adapted solely to defense. It should be continued with a very generous\r\nsupply of officers and with the present base of personnel, subject to\r\nfluctuations which may be temporarily desirable.\r\n\r\nThe five-year program for our air forces is in keeping with this same\r\npolicy and commensurate with the notable contributions of America to the\r\nscience of aeronautics. The provisions of the law lately enacted are being\r\nexecuted as fast as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stable\r\ndevelopment permit.\r\n\r\nWhile our Army is small, prudence requires that it should be kept in a high\r\nstate of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of its\r\nimmediate expansion. The garrison ration has lately been increased.\r\nRecommendations for an appropriation of $6,166,000 for new housing made to\r\nthe previous Congress failed to pass. While most of the Army is well\r\nhoused, some of it which is quartered in wartime training camps is becoming\r\npoorly housed. In the past three years $12,533,000 have been appropriated\r\nfor reconstruction and repairs, and an authorization has been approved of\r\n$22,301,000 for new housing, under which $8,070,000 has already been\r\nappropriated. A law has also been passed, complying with the request of the\r\nWar Department, allocating funds received from the sale of buildings and\r\nland for housing purposes. The work, however, is not completed, so that\r\nother appropriations are being recommended.\r\n\r\nOur Navy is likewise a weapon of defense. We have a foreign commerce and\r\nocean lines of trade unsurpassed by any other country. We have outlying\r\nterritory in the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studded\r\nwith the richest cities in the world. We are responsible for the protection\r\nof a large population and the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon any\r\npeople. We are charged with an international duty of defending the Panama\r\nCanal. To meet these responsibilities we need a very substantial sea\r\narmament. It needs aircraft development, which is being provided under the\r\nfive-year program. It needs submarines as soon as the department decides\r\nupon the best type of construction. It needs airplane carriers and a\r\nmaterial addition to its force of cruisers. We can plan for the future and\r\nbegin a moderate building program.\r\n\r\nThis country has put away the Old World policy of competitive armaments. It\r\ncan never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense.\r\nWe have one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on\r\nour part for a limitation in naval armament. After most careful\r\npreparation, extending over months, we recently made every effort to secure\r\na three-power treaty to the same end. We were granted much cooperation by\r\nJapan, but we were unable to come to an agreement with Great Britain. While\r\nthe results of the conference were of considerable value, they were mostly\r\nof a negative character. We know now that no agreement can be reached which\r\nwill be inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part. We\r\nare ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigations on the\r\ngeneral subject of limitation of armaments which have been started under\r\nthe auspices of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nWe have a considerable cruiser tonnage, but a part of it is obsolete.\r\nEveryone knew that had a three-power agreement been reached it would have\r\nleft us with the necessity of continuing our building program. The failure\r\nto agree should not cause us to build either more or less than we otherwise\r\nshould. Any future treaty of limitation will call on us for more ships. We\r\nshould enter on no competition. We should refrain from no needful program.\r\nIt should be made clear to all the world that lacking a definite agreement,\r\nthe attitude of any other country is not to be permitted to alter our own\r\npolicy. It should especially be demonstrated that propaganda will not cause\r\nus to change our course. Where there is no treaty limitation, the size of\r\nthe Navy which America is to have will be solely for America to determine.\r\nNo outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it. But it should be\r\nknown to all that our military power holds no threat of aggrandizement. It\r\nis a guaranty of peace and security at home, and when it goes abroad it is\r\nan instrument for the protection of the legal rights of our citizens under\r\ninternational law, a refuge in time of disorder, and always the servant of\r\nworld peace. Wherever our flag goes the rights of humanity increase.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT MARINE\r\n\r\nThe United States Government fleet is transporting a large amount of\r\nfreight and reducing its drain on the Treasury. The Shipping Board is\r\nconstantly under pressure, to which it too often yields, to protect private\r\ninterests, rather than serve the public welfare. More attention should be\r\ngiven to merchant ships as an auxiliary of the Navy. The possibility of\r\nincluding their masters and crews in the Naval Reserve, with some\r\nreasonable compensation, should be thoroughly explored as a method of\r\nencouraging private operation of shipping. Public operation is not a\r\nsuccess. No investigation, of which I have caused several to be made, has\r\nfailed to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy transfer\r\nto private ownership. Our exporters and importers are both indifferent\r\nabout using American ships. It should be our policy to keep our present\r\nvessels in repair and dispose of them as rapidly as possible, rather than\r\nundertake any new construction. Their operation is a burden on the National\r\nTreasury, for which we are not receiving sufficient benefits.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL AVIATION\r\n\r\nA rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics. The Department of Commerce\r\nhas charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of\r\nnational airways. Almost 8,000 miles are already completed and about 4,000\r\nmiles more contemplated. Nearly 4,400 miles are now equipped and over 3,000\r\nmiles more will have lighting and emergency landing fields by next July.\r\nAir mail contracts are expected to cover 24 of these lines. Daily airway\r\nflying is nearly 15,000 miles and is expected to reach 25,000 miles early\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\nFlights for other purposes exceed 22,000 miles each day. Over 900 airports,\r\ncompleted and uncompleted, have been laid out. The demand for aircraft has\r\ngreatly increased. The policy already adopted by the Congress is producing\r\nthe sound development of this coming industry.\r\n\r\nWESTERN HEMISPHERE AIR MAIL\r\n\r\nPrivate enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation service\r\nto Mexico and Central and South America. We are particularly solicitous to\r\nhave the United States take a leading part in this development. It is\r\nunderstood that the governments of our sister countries would be willing to\r\ncooperate. Their physical features, the undeveloped state of their\r\ntransportation, make an air service especially adaptable to their usage.\r\nThe Post Office Department should be granted power to make liberal\r\nlong-term contracts for carrying our mail, and authority should be given to\r\nthe Army and the Navy to detail aviators and planes to cooperate with\r\nprivate enterprise in establishing such mail service with the consent of\r\nthe countries concerned. A committee of the Cabinet will later present a\r\nreport on this subject.\r\n\r\nGOOD ROADS\r\n\r\nThe importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to be\r\nappreciated. The National Government has been making liberal contributions\r\nto encourage their construction. The results and benefits have been very\r\ngratifying. National participation, however, should be confined to\r\ntrunk-line systems. The national tax on automobiles is now nearly\r\nsufficient to meet this outlay. This tax is very small, and on low-priced\r\ncars is not more than $2 or $3 each year.\r\n\r\nWhile the advantage of having good roads is very large, the desire for\r\nimproved highways is not limited to our own country. It should and does\r\ninclude all the Western Hemisphere. The principal points in Canada are\r\nalready accessible. We ought to lend our encouragement in any way we can\r\nfor more good roads to all the principal points in this hemisphere south of\r\nthe Rio Grande. It has been our practice to supply these countries with\r\nmilitary and naval advisers, when they have requested it, to assist them in\r\nnational defense. The arts of peace are even more important to them and to\r\nus. Authority should be given by law to provide them at their request with\r\nengineering advisers for the construction of roads and bridges. In some of\r\nthese countries already wonderful progress is being made in road building,\r\nbut the engineering features are often very exacting and the financing\r\ndifficult. Private interests should look with favor on all reasonable loans\r\nsought by these countries to open such main lines of travel.\r\n\r\nThis general subject has been promoted by the Pan American Congress of\r\nHighways, which will convene again at Rio de Janeiro in July, 1928. It is\r\ndesirable that the Congress should provide for the appointment of delegates\r\nto represent the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nCUBAN PARCEL POST\r\n\r\nWe have a temporary parcel-post convention with Cuba. The advantage of it\r\nis all on our side. During 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels,\r\nweighing twenty-four times as much, as we received. This convention was\r\nmade on the understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibiting the\r\nimportation of cigars and cigarettes in quantities less than 3,000 enacted\r\nin 1866 to discourage smuggling, for which it has long been unnecessary.\r\nThis law unjustly discriminates against an important industry of Cuba. Its\r\nrepeal has been recommended by the Treasury and Post Office Departments.\r\nUnless this is done our merchants and railroads will find themselves\r\ndeprived of this large parcel-post business after the 1st of next March,\r\nthe date of the expiration of the convention, which has been extended upon\r\nthe specific understanding that it would expire at that time unless this\r\nlegislation was enacted. We purchase large quantities of tobacco made in\r\nCuba. It is not probable that our purchases would be any larger if this law\r\nwas repealed, while it would be an advantage to many other industries in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nINSULAR POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\nConditions in the Philippine Islands have been steadily improved.\r\nContentment and good order prevail. Roads, irrigation works, harbor\r\nimprovements, and public buildings are being constructed. Public education\r\nand sanitation have been advanced. The Government is in a sound financial\r\ncondition. These immediate results were especially due to the\r\nadministration of Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood. The six years of his governorship\r\nmarked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as one of the\r\noutstanding accomplishments of this distinguished man. His death is a loss\r\nto the Nation and the islands.\r\n\r\nGreater progress could be made, more efficiency could be put into\r\nadministration, if the Congress would undertake to expend, through its\r\nappropriating power, all or a part of the customs revenues which are now\r\nturned over to the Philippine treasury. The powers of the auditor of the\r\nislands also need revision and clarification. The government of the islands\r\nis about 98 per cent in the hands of the Filipinos. An extension of the\r\npolicy of self-government will be hastened by the demonstration on their\r\npart of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially and\r\nefficiently the provisions of the organic law enacted by the Congress for\r\nthe government of the islands. It would be well for a committee of the\r\nCongress to visit the islands every two years.\r\n\r\nA fair degree of progress is being made in Porto Rico. Its agricultural\r\nproducts are increasing; its treasury position, which has given much\r\nconcern, shows improvement. I am advised by the governor that educational\r\nfacilities are still lacking. Roads are being constructed, which he\r\nrepresents are the first requisite for building schoolhouses. The loyalty\r\nof the island to the United States is exceedingly gratifying. A memorial\r\nwill be presented to you requesting authority to have the governor elected\r\nby the people of Porto Rico. This was never done in the case of our own\r\nTerritories. It is admitted that education outside of the towns is as yet\r\nvery deficient. Until it has progressed further the efficiency of the\r\ngovernment and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of an\r\nappointed governor. As it is not contemplated that any change should be\r\nmade immediately, the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nPANAMA CANAL\r\n\r\nThe number of commercial ships passing through the Panama Canal has\r\nincreased from 3,967 in 1923 to 5,475 in 1927. The total amount of tolls\r\nturned into the Treasury is over $166,000,000, while all the operations of\r\nthe canal have yielded a surplus of about $80,000,000. In order to provide\r\nadditional storage of water and give some control over the floods of the\r\nChagres River, it is proposed to erect a dam to cost about $12,000,000 at\r\nAlhajuela. It will take some five years to complete this work.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition of\r\nagriculture. Production is better balanced and without acute shortage or\r\nheavy surplus. Costs have been reduced and the average output of the worker\r\nincreased. The level of farm prices has risen while others have fallen, so\r\nthat the purchasing power of the farmer is approaching a normal figure. The\r\nindividual farmer is entitled to great credit for the progress made since\r\n1921. He has adjusted his production and through cooperative organizations\r\nand other methods improved his marketing. He is using authenticated facts\r\nand employing sound methods which other industries are obliged to use to\r\nsecure stability and prosperity. The old-fashioned haphazard system is\r\nbeing abandoned, economics are being applied to ascertain the best adapted\r\nunit of land, diversification is being promoted, and scientific methods are\r\nbeing used in production, and business principles in marketing.\r\n\r\nAgriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression. The fact is\r\nthat economic progress never marches forward in a straight line. It goes in\r\nwaves. One part goes ahead, while another halts and another recedes.\r\nEverybody wishes agriculture to prosper. Any sound and workable proposal to\r\nhelp the farmer will have the earnest support of the Government. Their\r\ninterests are not all identical. Legislation should assist as many\r\nproducers in as many regions as possible. It should be the aim to assist\r\nthe farmer to work out his own salvation socially and economically. No plan\r\nwill be of any permanent value to him which does not leave him standing on\r\nhis own foundation.\r\n\r\nIn the past the Government has spent vast sums to bring land under\r\ncultivation. It is apparent that this has reached temporarily the\r\nsaturation point. We have had a surplus of production and a poor market for\r\nland, which has only lately shown signs of improvement. The main problem\r\nwhich is presented for solution is one of dealing with a surplus of\r\nproduction. It is useless to propose a temporary expedient. What is needed\r\nis permanency and stability. Government price fixing is known to be unsound\r\nand bound to result in disaster. A Government subsidy would work out in the\r\nsame way. It can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of the\r\npeople to produce a crop which neither the producers nor the rest of the\r\npeople want.\r\n\r\nPrice fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus, instead of\r\ndiminishing it. Putting the Government directly into business is merely a\r\ncombination of subsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure.\r\nThese expedients would lead logically to telling the farmer by law what and\r\nhow much he should plant and where he should plant it, and what and how\r\nmuch he should sell and where he should sell it. The most effective means\r\nof dealing with surplus crops is to reduce the surplus acreage. While this\r\ncan not be done by the individual farmer, it can be done through the\r\norganizations already in existence, through the information published by\r\nthe Department of Agriculture, and especially through banks and others who\r\nsupply credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly too large.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity\r\nfor all those who engage in farming. If acreage becomes overextended, the\r\nGovernment can not assume responsibility for it. The Government can,\r\nhowever, assist cooperative associations and other organizations in orderly\r\nmarketing and handling a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal\r\nconditions, in order to save the producer from preventable loss. While it\r\nis probably impossible to secure this result at a single step, and much\r\nwill have to be worked out by trial and rejection, a beginning could be\r\nmade by setting up a Federal board or commission of able and experienced\r\nmen in marketing, granting equal advantages under this board to the various\r\nagricultural commodities and sections of the country, giving encouragement\r\nto the cooperative movement in agriculture, and providing a revolving loan\r\nfund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing. Such\r\nlegislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the\r\nsurplus problem.\r\n\r\nThis is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer, who is already\r\nfairly well financed, but to lend money temporarily to experimental\r\nmarketing associations which will no doubt ultimately be financed by the\r\nregularly established banks, as were the temporary operations of the War\r\nFinance Corporation. Cooperative marketing especially would be provided\r\nwith means of buying or building physical properties.\r\n\r\nThe National Government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from income\r\ntaxes by successive tax reductions, but State and local taxes have\r\nincreased, putting on him a grievous burden. A policy of rigid economy\r\nshould be applied to State and local expenditures. This is clearly within\r\nthe legislative domain of the States. The Federal Government has also\r\nimproved our banking structure and system of agricultural credits. The\r\nfarmer will be greatly benefited by similar action in many States. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture is undergoing changes in organization in order\r\nmore completely to separate the research and regulatory divisions, that\r\neach may be better administered. More emphasis is being placed on the\r\nresearch program, not only by enlarging the appropriations for State\r\nexperiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research work\r\nof the department. It is in this direction that much future progress can be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTIVE TARIFF\r\n\r\nThe present tariff rates supply the National Treasury with well over\r\n$600,000,000 of annual revenue. Yet, about 65 per cent of our imports come\r\nin duty free. Of the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties are\r\nlaid about 23 per cent consists of luxuries and agricultural products, and\r\nthe balance of about 12 per cent, amounting, to around $560,000,000 is made\r\nup of manufactures and merchandise. As no one is advocating any material\r\nreduction in the rates on agriculture or luxuries, it is only the\r\ncomparatively small amount of about $560,000,000 of other imports that are\r\nreally considered in any discussion of reducing tariff rates. While this\r\namount, duty free, would be large enough seriously to depress many lines of\r\nbusiness in our own country, it is of small importance when spread over the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry would\r\nbenefit agriculture. It would be interesting to know to what commodities it\r\nis thought this could be applied. Everything the farmer uses in farming is\r\nalready on the free list. Nearly everything he sells is protected. It would\r\nseem to be obvious that it is better for the country to have the farmer\r\nraise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreign\r\nmanufacturer. In one case our country would have only the farmer; in the\r\nother it would have the farmer and the manufacturer. Assuming that Europe\r\nwould have more money if it sold us larger amounts of merchandise, it is\r\nnot certain it would consume more food, or, if it did, that its purchases\r\nwould be made in this country. Undoubtedly it would resort to the cheapest\r\nmarket, which is by no means ours. The largest and best and most profitable\r\nmarket for the farmer in the world is our own domestic market. Any great\r\nincrease in manufactured imports means the closing of our own plants.\r\nNothing would be worse for agriculture.\r\n\r\nProbably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactures\r\nwhile maintaining the rates on agriculture. A material reduction in either\r\nwould be disastrous to the farmer. It would mean a general shrinkage of\r\nvalues, a deflation of prices, a reduction of wages, a general depression\r\ncarrying our people down to the low standard of living in our competing\r\ncountries. It is obvious that this would not improve but destroy our market\r\nfor imports, which is best served by maintaining our present high\r\npurchasing power under which in the past five years imports have increased\r\n63 per cent.\r\n\r\nFARM LOAN SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly important that the Federal land and joint-stock land\r\nbanks should furnish the best possible service for agriculture. Certain\r\njoint-stock banks have fallen into improper and unsound practices,\r\nresulting in the indictment of the officials of three of them. More money\r\nhas been provided for examinations, and at the instance of the Treasury\r\nrules and regulations of the Federal Farm Board have been revised. Early\r\nlast May three of its members resigned. Their places were filled with men\r\nconnected with the War Finance Corporation. Eugene Meyer being designated\r\nas Farm Loan Commissioner. The new members have demonstrated their ability\r\nin the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations of he War\r\nFinance Corporation. Three joint-stock banks have gone into receivership.\r\nIt is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order\r\nto find a market for their bonds. A recent flotation was made at a record\r\nlow rate of 4 per cent. Careful supervision is absolutely necessary to\r\nprotect the investor and enable these banks to exercise their chief\r\nfunction in serving agriculture.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nThe last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of Muscle\r\nShoals. Development of other methods show that nitrates can probably be\r\nproduced at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power. Extensive\r\ninvestigation made by the Department of War indicates that the nitrate\r\nplants on this project are of little value for national defense and can\r\nprobably be disposed of within two years. The oxidation part of the plants,\r\nhowever, should be retained indefinitely. This leaves this project mostly\r\nconcerned with power. It should, nevertheless, continue to be dedicated to\r\nagriculture. It is probable that this desire can be best served by\r\ndisposing of the plant and applying the revenues received from it to\r\nresearch for methods of more economical production of concentrated\r\nfertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating its use\r\non the farm. But in disposing of the property preference should be given to\r\nproposals to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer\r\nmanufacturing.\r\n\r\nFLOOD CONTROL\r\n\r\nFor many years the Federal Government has been building a system of dikes\r\nalong the Mississippi River for protection against high water. During the\r\npast season the lower States were overcome by a most disastrous flood. Many\r\nthousands of square miles were inundated a great many lives were lost, much\r\nlivestock was drowned, and a very heavy destruction of property was\r\ninflicted upon the inhabitants. The American Red Cross at once went to the\r\nrelief of the stricken communities. Appeals for contributions have brought\r\nin over $17,000,000. The Federal Government has provided services,\r\nequipment, and supplies probably amounting to about $7,000,000 more.\r\nBetween $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in addition have been provided by local\r\nrailroads, the States, and their political units. Credits have been\r\narranged by the Farm Loan Board, and three emergency finance corporations\r\nwith a total capital of $3,000,000 have insured additional resources to the\r\nextent of $12,000,000. Through these means the 700,000 people in the\r\nflooded areas have been adequately supported. Provision has been made to\r\ncare for those in need until after the 1st of January.\r\n\r\nThe Engineering Corps of the Army has contracted to close all breaks in the\r\ndike system before the next season of high water. A most thorough and\r\nelaborate survey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in a\r\nreport with recommendations for future flood control, which will be\r\npresented to the Congress. The carrying out of their plans will necessarily\r\nextend over a series of years. They will call for a raising and\r\nstrengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway's\r\nand improvements for the benefit of navigation.\r\n\r\nUnder the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one-third of\r\nthe cost of their construction. This has been a most extraordinary\r\nconcession from the plan adopted in relation to irrigation, where the\r\ngeneral rule has been that the land benefited should bear the entire\r\nexpense. It is true, of course, that the troublesome waters do not\r\noriginate on the land to be reclaimed, but it is also true that such waters\r\nhave a right of way through that section of the country and the land there\r\nis charged with that easement. It is the land of this region that is to be\r\nbenefited. To say that it is unable to bear any expense of reclamation is\r\nthe same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming. Because of\r\nexpenses incurred and charges already held against this land, it seems\r\nprobable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportion\r\nof cost which it should bear. But it is extremely important that it should\r\npay enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with some\r\nresponsibility for their cost, and the neighborhood where works are\r\nconstructed have a pecuniary interest in preventing waste and extravagance\r\nand securing a wise and economical expenditure of public funds.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster. It has\r\nbeen so treated from its inception. Our whole people have provided with\r\ngreat generosity for its relief. Most of the departments of the Federal\r\nGovernment have been engaged in the same effort. The governments of the\r\nafflicted areas, both State and municipal, can not be given too high praise\r\nfor the courageous and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of\r\nthe people. If the sources directly chargeable can not meet the demand, the\r\nNational Government should not fail to provide generous relief. This,\r\nhowever, does not mean restoration. The Government is not an insurer of its\r\ncitizens against the hazard of the elements. We shall always have flood and\r\ndrought, heat and cold, earthquake and wind, lightning and tidal wave,\r\nwhich are all too constant in their afflictions. The Government does not\r\nundertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage incurred under such\r\ncircumstances. It is chargeable, however, with the rebuilding of public\r\nworks and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress.\r\n\r\nThe people in the flooded area and their representatives have approached\r\nthis problem in the most generous and broad-minded way. They should be met\r\nwith a like spirit on the part of the National government. This is all one\r\ncountry. The public needs of each part must be provided for by the public\r\nat large. No required relief should be refused. An adequate plan should be\r\nadopted to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people\r\nmay restore to productivity and comfort their fields and their towns.\r\n\r\nLegislation by this Congress should be confined to our principal and most\r\npressing problem, the lower Mississippi, considering tributaries only so\r\nfar as they materially affect the main flood problem. A definite Federal\r\nprogram relating to our waterways was proposed when the last Congress\r\nauthorized a comprehensive survey of all the important streams of the\r\ncountry in order to provide for their improvement, including flood control,\r\nnavigation, power, and irrigation. Other legislation should wait pending a\r\nreport on this survey. The recognized needs of the Mississippi should not\r\nbe made a vehicle for carrying other projects. All proposals for\r\ndevelopment should stand on their own merits. Any other method would result\r\nin ill-advised conclusions, great waste of money, and instead of promoting\r\nwould delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resources.\r\n\r\nVery recently several of the New England States have suffered somewhat\r\nsimilarly from heavy rainfall and high water. No reliable estimate of\r\ndamage has yet been computed, but it is very large to private and public\r\nproperty. The Red Cross is generously undertaking what is needed for\r\nimmediate relief, repair and reconstruction of houses, restocking of\r\ndomestic animals, and food, clothing, and shelter. A considerable sum of\r\nmoney will be available through the regular channels in the Department of\r\nAgriculture for reconstruction of highways. It may be necessary to grant\r\nspecial aid for this purpose. Complete reports of what is required will\r\nundoubtedly be available early in the session.\r\n\r\nINLAND NAVIGATION\r\n\r\nThe Congress in its last session authorized the general improvements\r\nnecessary to provide the Mississippi waterway system with better\r\ntransportation. Stabilization of the levels of the Great Lakes and their\r\nopening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be considered. Since\r\nthe last session the Board of Engineers of the War Department has made a\r\nreport on the proposal for a canal through the State of New York, and the\r\nJoint Board of Engineers, representing Canada and the United States, has\r\nfinished a report on the St. Lawrence River. Both of these boards conclude\r\nthat the St. Lawrence project is cheaper, affords a more expeditious method\r\nof placing western products in European markets, and will cost less to\r\noperate. The State Department has requested the Canadian Government to\r\nnegotiate treaties necessary to provide for this improvement. It will also\r\nbe necessary to secure an agreement with Canada to put in works necessary\r\nto prevent fluctuation in the levels of the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nLegislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at Boulder Canyon on\r\nthe Colorado River, primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation.\r\nA secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source\r\nof domestic water supply for southern California. Flood control is clearly\r\na national problem, and water supply is a Government problem, but every\r\nother possibility should be exhausted before the Federal Government becomes\r\nengaged in the power business. The States which are interested ought to\r\nreach mutual agreement. This project is in reality their work. If they wish\r\nthe Federal Government to undertake it, they should not hesitate to make\r\nthe necessary concessions to each other. This subject is fully discussed in\r\nthe annual report of the Secretary of the Interior. The Columbia River\r\nBasin project is being studied and will be one to be considered at some\r\nfuture time.\r\n\r\nThe Inland Waterways Corporation is proving successful and especially\r\nbeneficial to agriculture. A survey is being made to determine its future\r\nneeds. It has never been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened to\r\nnavigation it would then be necessary for the Federal Government to provide\r\nthe navigation. Such a request is very nearly the equivalent of a\r\ndeclaration that their navigation is not profitable, that the commodities\r\nwhich they are to carry can be taken at a cheaper rate by some other\r\nmethod, in which case the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be\r\nexpended for opening rivers to navigation would be not only wasted, but\r\nwould entail further constant expenditures to carry the commodities of\r\nprivate persons for less than cost.\r\n\r\nThe policy is well established that the Government should open public\r\nhighways on land and on water, but for use of the public in their private\r\ncapacity. It has put on some demonstration barge lines, but always with the\r\nexpectation that if they prove profitable they would pass into private\r\nhands and if they do not prove profitable they will be withdrawn. The\r\nproblems of transportation over inland waterways should be taken up by\r\nprivate enterprise, so that the public will have the advantage of\r\ncompetition in service. It is expected that some of our lines can be sold,\r\nsome more demonstration work done, and that with the completion of the Ohio\r\nproject a policy of private operation can be fully developed.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION\r\n\r\nAfter more than two generations of constant debate, our country adopted a\r\nsystem of national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in an\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution. In obedience to this mandate the\r\nCongress and the States, with one or two notable exceptions, have passed\r\nrequired laws for its administration and enforcement. This imposes upon the\r\ncitizenship of the country, and especially on all public officers, not only\r\nthe duty to enforce, but the obligation to observe the sanctions of this\r\nconstitutional provision and its resulting laws. If this condition could be\r\nsecured, all question concerning prohibition would cease. The Federal\r\nGovernment is making every effort to accomplish these results through\r\ncareful organization, large appropriations, and administrative effort.\r\nSmuggling has been greatly cut down, the larger sources of supply for\r\nillegal sale have been checked, and by means of injunction and criminal\r\nprosecution the process of enforcement is being applied. The same vigilance\r\non the part of local governments would render these efforts much more\r\nsuccessful. The Federal authorities propose to discharge their obligation\r\nfor enforcement to the full extent of their ability.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO\r\n\r\nHistory does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same length\r\nof time as that which has been accomplished by the Negro race in the United\r\nStates since the Emancipation Proclamation. They have come up from slavery\r\nto be prominent in education, the professions, art, science, agriculture,\r\nbanking, and commerce. It is estimated that 50,000 of them are on the\r\nGovernment pay rolls, drawing about $50,000,000 each year. They have been\r\nthe recipients of presidential appointments and their professional ability\r\nhas arisen to a sufficiently high plane so that they have been intrusted\r\nwith the entire management and control of the great veterans hospital at\r\nTuskegee, where their conduct has taken high rank. They have shown that\r\nthey have been worthy of all the encouragement which they have received.\r\nNevertheless, they are too often subjected to thoughtless and inconsiderate\r\ntreatment, unworthy alike of the white or colored races. They have\r\nespecially been made the target of the foul crime of lynching. For several\r\nyears these acts of unlawful violence had been diminishing. In the last\r\nyear they have shown an increase. Every principle of order and law and\r\nliberty is opposed to this crime. The Congress should enact any legislation\r\nit can under the Constitution to provide for its elimination.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN INDIAN\r\n\r\nThe condition of the American Indian has much improved in recent years.\r\nFull citizenship was bestowed upon them on June 2, 1924, and appropriations\r\nfor their care and advancement have been increased. Still there remains\r\nmuch to be done.\r\n\r\nNotable increases in appropriations for the several major functions\r\nperformed by the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Indians have\r\nmarked the last five years. In that time, successive annual increases in\r\nappropriations for their education total $1,804,325; for medical care,\r\n$578,000; and for industrial advancement, $205,000; or $2,582,325 more than\r\nwould have been spent in the same period on the basis of appropriations for\r\n1923 and the preceding years.\r\n\r\nThe needs along health, educational, industrial and social lines however,\r\nare great, and the Budget estimates for 1929 include still further\r\nincreases for Indian administration.\r\n\r\nTo advance the time when the Indians may become self-sustaining, it is my\r\nbelief that the Federal Government should continue to improve the\r\nfacilities for their care, and as rapidly as possible turn its\r\nresponsibility over to the States.\r\n\r\nCOAL\r\n\r\nLegislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointment\r\nby the President of a Board of Mediation and Conciliation in case of actual\r\nor threatened interruption of production is needed. The miners themselves\r\nare now seeking information and action from the Government, which could\r\nreadily be secured through such a board. It is believed that a thorough\r\ninvestigation and reconsideration of this proposed policy by the Congress\r\nwill demonstrate that this recommendation is sound and should be adopted.\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM CONSERVATION\r\n\r\nThe National Government is undertaking to join in the formation of a\r\ncooperative committee of lawyers, engineers, and public officers, to\r\nconsider what legislation by the States or by the Congress can be adopted\r\nfor the preservation and conservation of our supply of petroleum. This has\r\ncome to be one of the main dependencies for transportation and power so\r\nnecessary to our agricultural and industrial life. It is expected the\r\nreport of this committee will be available for later congressional action.\r\nMeantime, the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior should make\r\ncertain leases of land belonging to the Osage Indians, in accordance with\r\nthe act of March 3, 1921, should be repealed. The authority to lease should\r\nbe discretionary, in order that the property of the Indians way not be\r\nwasted and the public suffer a future lack of supply.\r\n\r\nALIEN PROPERTY\r\n\r\nUnder treaty the property held by the Alien Property Custodian was to be\r\nretained until suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction of\r\nAmerican claims. While still protecting the American claimants, in order to\r\nafford every possible accommodation to the nationals of the countries whose\r\nproperty was held, the Congress has made liberal provision for the return\r\nof a larger part of the property. All trusts under $10,000 were returned in\r\nfull, and partial returns were made on the others. The total returned was\r\napproximately $350,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere is still retained, however, about $250,000,000. The Mixed Claims\r\nCommission has made such progress in the adjudication of claims that\r\nlegislation can now be enacted providing for the return of the property,\r\nwhich should be done under conditions which will protect our Government and\r\nour claimants. Such a measure will be proposed, and I recommend its\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD CONSOLIDATION\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost\r\nto the shipper, railroad consolidation must be secured. Legislation is\r\nneeded to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements and\r\narrangements for consolidation, always under the control and with the\r\napproval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Pending this, no adequate\r\nor permanent reorganization can be made of the freight-rate structure.\r\nMeantime, both agriculture and industry are compelled to wait for needed\r\nrelief. This is purely a business question, which should be stripped of all\r\nlocal and partisan bias and decided on broad principles and its merits in\r\norder to promote the public welfare. A large amount of new construction and\r\nequipment, which will furnish employment for labor and markets for\r\ncommodities of both factory and farm, wait on the decision of this\r\nimportant question. Delay is holding back the progress of our country.\r\n\r\nMany of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of the\r\nWashington traction companies.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nThe care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of all\r\nmen. The yearly outlay for this purpose is about $750,000,000, or about the\r\ncost of running the Federal Government, outside of the Post Office\r\nDepartment, before the World War. The Congress will have before it\r\nrecommendations of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and\r\nother like organizations, which should receive candid consideration. We\r\nshould continue to foster our system of compensation and rehabilitation,\r\nand provide hospitals and insurance. The magnitude of the undertaking is\r\nalready so large that all requests calling for further expenditure should\r\nhave the most searching scrutiny. Our present system of pensions is already\r\nsufficiently liberal. It was increased by the last Congress for Civil and\r\nSpanish War veterans and widows and for some dependents.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealing\r\nwith veterans' relief be consolidated. This would bring many advantages. It\r\nis recommended that the proper committees of the Congress make a thorough\r\nsurvey of this subject, in order to determine if legislation to secure such\r\nconsolidation is desirable.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nFor many years it has been the policy of the Federal Government to\r\nencourage and foster the cause of education. Large sums of money are\r\nannually appropriated to carry on vocational training. Many millions go\r\ninto agricultural schools. The general subject is under the immediate\r\ndirection of a Commissioner of Education. While this subject is strictly a\r\nState and local function, it should continue to have the encouragement of\r\nthe National Government. I am still of the opinion that much good could be\r\naccomplished through the establishment of a Department of Education and\r\nRelief, into which would be gathered all of these functions under one\r\ndirecting member of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOR\r\n\r\nIndustrial relations have never been more peaceful. In recent months they\r\nhave suffered from only one serious controversy. In all others difficulties\r\nhave been adjusted, both management and labor wishing to settle\r\ncontroversies by friendly agreement rather than by compulsion. The welfare\r\nof women and children is being especially guarded by our Department of\r\nLabor. Its Children's Bureau is in cooperation with 26 State boards and 80\r\njuvenile courts.\r\n\r\nThrough its Bureau of Immigration it has been found that medical\r\nexamination abroad has saved prospective immigrants from much hardship.\r\nSome further legislation to provide for reuniting families when either the\r\nhusband or the wife is in this country, and granting more freedom for the\r\nmigration of the North American Indian tribes is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe United States Employment Service has enabled about 2,000,000 men and\r\nwomen to gain paying positions in the last fiscal year. Particular\r\nattention has been given to assisting men past middle life and in providing\r\nfield labor for harvesting agricultural crops. This has been made possible\r\nin part through the service of the Federal Board for Vocational Education,\r\nwhich is cooperating with the States in a program to increase the technical\r\nknowledge and skill of the wage earner.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nConstruction is under way in the country and ground has been broken for\r\ncarrying out a public-building program for Washington. We have reached a\r\ntime when not only the conveniences but the architectural beauty of the\r\npublic buildings of the Capital City should be given much attention. It\r\nwill be necessary to purchase further land and provide the required\r\ncontinuing appropriations.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL CELEBRATIONS\r\n\r\nProvision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the\r\nbirth of George Washington. Suggestion has been made for the construction\r\nof a memorial road leading from the Capital to Mount Vernon, which may well\r\nhave the consideration of the Congress, and the commission intrusted with\r\npreparations for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of\r\nthe complete writings of Washington and a series of writings by different\r\nauthors relating to him.\r\n\r\nFebruary 25, 1929. is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the\r\ncapture of Fort Sackville, at Vincennes, in the State of Indiana. This\r\neventually brought into the Union what was known as the Northwest\r\nTerritory, embracing the region north of the Ohio River between the\r\nAlleghenies and the Mississippi River. This expedition was led by George\r\nRogers Clark. His heroic character and the importance of his victory are\r\ntoo little known and understood. They gave us not only this Northwest\r\nTerritory but by means of that the prospect of reaching the Pacific. The\r\nState of Indiana is proposing to dedicate the site of Fort Sackville as a\r\nnational shrine. The Federal Government may well make some provision for\r\nthe erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at that point.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the United States to promote peace. We are a peaceful\r\npeople and committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustment\r\nrather than by force. We have believed that peace can best be secured by a\r\nfaithful observance on our part of the principles of international law,\r\naccompanied by patience and conciliation, and requiring of others a like\r\ntreatment for ourselves. We have lately had some difference with Mexico\r\nrelative to the injuries inflicted upon our nationals and their property\r\nwithin that country. A firm adherence to our rights and a scrupulous\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of Mexico, both in accordance with the law of\r\nnations, coupled with patience and forbearance, it is hoped will resolve\r\nall our differences without interfering with the friendly relationship\r\nbetween the two Governments.\r\n\r\nWe have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to China to protect\r\nthe lives and property of our citizens. Fortunately their simple presence\r\nthere has been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life. But there\r\nhas been considerable loss of property. That unhappy country is torn by\r\nfactions and revolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period.\r\nMeanwhile we are protecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate with\r\nany government which may emerge in promoting the welfare of the people of\r\nChina. They have always had our friendship, and they should especially\r\nmerit our consideration in these days of their distraction and distress.\r\n\r\nWe were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in Nicaragua. Our\r\nmarine and naval forces protected our citizens and their property and\r\nprevented a heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by\r\na reversion to a state of revolution. Henry L. Stimson, former Secretary of\r\nWar, was sent there to cooperate with our diplomatic and military officers\r\nin effecting a settlement between the contending parties. This was done on\r\nthe assurance that we would cooperate in restoring a state of peace where\r\nour rights would be protected by giving our assistance in the conduct of\r\nthe next presidential election, which occurs in a few months. With this\r\nassurance the population returned to their peacetime pursuits, with the\r\nexception of some small roving bands of outlaws.\r\n\r\nIn general, our relations with other countries can be said to have improved\r\nwithin the year. While having a due regard for our own affairs, the\r\nprotection of our own rights, and the advancement of our own people, we can\r\nafford to be liberal toward others. Our example has become of great\r\nimportance in the world. It is recognized that we are independent,\r\ndetached, and can and do take a disinterested position in relation to\r\ninternational affairs. Our charity embraces the earth. Our trade is far\r\nflung. Our financial favors are widespread. Those who are peaceful and\r\nlaw-abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us, but\r\nthat they can rely on our moral support. Proposals for promoting the peace\r\nof the world will have careful consideration. But we are not a people who\r\nare always seeking for a sign. We know that peace comes from honesty and\r\nfair dealing, from moderation, and a generous regard for the rights of\r\nothers. The heart of the Nation is more important than treaties. A spirit\r\nof generous consideration is a more certain defense than great armaments.\r\nWe should continue to promote peace by our example, and fortify it by such\r\ninternational covenants against war as we are permitted under our\r\nConstitution to make.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN PROGRESS\r\n\r\nOur country has made much progress. But it has taken, and will continue to\r\ntake, much effort. Competition will be keen, the temptation to selfishness\r\nand arrogance will be severe, the provocations to deal harshly with weaker\r\npeoples will be many. All of these are embraced in the opportunity for true\r\ngreatness. They will be overbalanced by cooperation by generosity, and a\r\nspirit of neighborly kindness. The forces of the universe are taking\r\nhumanity in that direction. In doing good, in walking humbly, in sustaining\r\nits own people in ministering to other nations, America will work out its\r\nown mighty destiny.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nCalvin Coolidge\r\nDecember 4, 1928\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nNo Congress of the United States ever assembled, on surveying the state of\r\nthe Union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at\r\nthe present time. In the domestic field there is tranquility and\r\ncontentment, harmonious relations between management and wage earner,\r\nfreedom from industrial strife, and the highest record of years of\r\nprosperity. In the foreign field there is peace, the good will which comes\r\nfrom mutual understanding, and the knowledge that the problems which a\r\nshort time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifest\r\nfriendship. The great wealth created by our enterprise and industry, and\r\nsaved by our economy, has had the widest distribution among our own people,\r\nand has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business\r\nof the world. The requirements of existence have passed beyond the standard\r\nof necessity into the region of luxury. Enlarging production is consumed by\r\nan increasing demand at home and an expanding commerce abroad. The country\r\ncan regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with\r\noptimism.\r\n\r\nThe main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and\r\ncharacter of the American people. They have had great faith, which they\r\nhave supplemented with mighty works. They have been able to put trust in\r\neach other and trust in their Government. Their candor in dealing with\r\nforeign governments has commanded respect and confidence. Yet these\r\nremarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without the\r\nconstant cooperation and careful administration of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nWe have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as a\r\nconservation of our national resources. Wastefulness in public business and\r\nprivate enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy. This has\r\nbeen accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more and\r\nmore under a reign of law. A rule of force has been giving way to a rule of\r\nreason. We have substituted for the vicious circle of increasing\r\nexpenditures, increasing tax rates, and diminishing profits the charmed\r\ncircle of diminishing expenditures, diminishing tax rates, and increasing\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nFour times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system,\r\nabolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others. Each\r\ntime the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomes\r\nand profits that a surplus has been reduced. One-third of the national\r\ndebt has been paid, while much of the other two-thirds has been refunded at\r\nlower rates, and these savings of interest and constant economies have\r\nenabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions. Under\r\nthis sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increased\r\nnearly 50 per cent, until it is estimated to stand well over\r\n$90,000,000,000. It gas been a method which has performed the seeming\r\nmiracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands of\r\nthe taxpayers with scarcely any diminution of the Government revenue. That\r\nis constructive economy in the highest degree. It is the corner stone of\r\nprosperity. It should not fail to be continued.\r\n\r\nThis action began by the application of economy to public expenditure. If\r\nit is to be permanent, it must be made so by the repeated application of\r\neconomy. There is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this\r\ntime. Last June the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the current\r\nfiscal year of $94,000,000. Under my direction the departments began saving\r\nall they could out of their present appropriations. The last tax reduction\r\nbrought an encouraging improvement in business, beginning early in\r\nOctober, which will also increase our revenue. The combination of economy\r\nand good times now indicates a surplus of about $37,000,000. This is a\r\nmargin of less than I percent on out, expenditures and makes it obvious\r\nthat the Treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in expenditures\r\nto be made before June 30. It is necessary therefore during the present\r\nsession to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay, or if such\r\nare absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue; otherwise, we\r\nshall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced\r\nbudget. For the first time during my term of office we face that\r\ncontingency. I am certain that the Congress would not pass and I should not\r\nfeel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in that\r\nfinancial disgrace.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the finances of the Government are most satisfactory. Last\r\nyear the national debt was reduced about $906,000,000. The refunding and\r\nretirement of the second and third Liberty loans have just been brought to\r\na successful conclusion, which will save about $75,000,000 a year in\r\ninterest. The unpaid balance has been arranged in maturities convenient\r\nfor carrying out our permanent debt-paying Program.\r\n\r\nThe enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimate\r\npublic need. The Government plant has been kept up and many improvements\r\nare tinder way, while its service is fully manned and the general\r\nefficiency of operation has increased. We have been enabled to undertake\r\nmany new enterprises. Among these are the adjusted compensation of the\r\nveterans of the World War, which is costing us $112,000,000 a year;\r\namortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds,\r\n$20,000,000; increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors including\r\nflood control, $43,000,000; public buildings, $47,000,000. In 1928 we spent\r\n$50,000,000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property. These are\r\nexamples of a large list of items.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations, we\r\nlikewise perceive peace and progress. The Sixth International Conference of\r\nAmerican States was held at Habana last winter. It contributed to a better\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among the nations'. Eleven important\r\nconventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed. Pursuant to the plan\r\nthen adopted, this Government has invited the other 20 nations of this\r\nhemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration, which meets in\r\nWashington on December 10. All the nations have accepted and the\r\nexpectation is justified that important progress will be made in methods\r\nfor resolving international differences by means of arbitration.\r\n\r\nDuring the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties, and 22 more are\r\ntinder negotiation.\r\n\r\nNICARAGUA\r\n\r\nWhen a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in Nicaragua, at\r\nthe earnest and repeated entreaties of its Government I dispatched our\r\nMarine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens. To\r\ncompose the contending parties, I sent there Col. Henry L. Stimson, former\r\nSecretary of War and now Governor General of the Philippine Islands, who\r\nsecured an agreement that warfare should cease, a national election should\r\nbe held and peace should be restored. Both parties conscientiously carried\r\nout this agreement, with the exception of a few bandits who later mostly\r\nsurrendered or left the country. President Diaz appointed Brig. Gen. Frank\r\nR. McCoy, United States Army, president of the election board, which\r\nincluded also one member of each political party.\r\n\r\nA free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfully\r\nthat both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from this\r\ncountry at the election four years hence, to which I have refrained from\r\nmaking any commitments, although our country must be gratified at such an\r\nexhibition of success and appreciation.\r\n\r\nNicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in the\r\ndirection of peaceful self-government.\r\n\r\nTACNA-ARICA\r\n\r\nThe long-standing differences between Chile and Peru have been sufficiently\r\ncomposed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange of\r\nambassadors. Negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written for\r\nthe final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory.\r\n\r\nMEXICO\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any time\r\nsince their revolution. Many misunderstandings have been resolved and the\r\nmost frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of all\r\nunsettled questions. It is exceedingly gratifying that Ambassador Morrow\r\nhas been able to bring our two neighboring countries, which have so many\r\ninterests in common, to a position of confidence in each other and of\r\nrespect for mutual sovereign rights.\r\n\r\nCHINA\r\n\r\nThe situation in China which a few months ago was so threatening as to call\r\nfor the dispatch of a large additional force has, been much composed. The\r\nNationalist Government has established itself over the country and\r\npromulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote the\r\npolitical and economic welfare of the people. We have recognized this\r\nGovernment, encouraged its progress, and have negotiated a treaty\r\nrestoring to China complete tariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizens\r\nagainst discriminations. Our trade in that quarter is increasing and our\r\nforces are being reduced.\r\n\r\nGREEK AND AUSTRIAN DEBTS\r\n\r\nPending before the Congress is a recommendation for the settlement of the\r\nGreek debt and the Austrian debt. Both of these are comparatively small and\r\nour country can afford to be generous. The rehabilitation of these\r\ncountries awaits their settlement. There would also be advantages to our\r\ntrade. We could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses the\r\nrelief which Austria seeks. The Congress has already granted Austria a\r\nlong-time moratorium, which it is understood will be waived and immediate\r\npayments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended to\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nPEACE TREATY\r\n\r\nOne of the most important treaties ever laid before the Senate of the\r\nUnited States will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at Paris,\r\nand to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere,\r\nrenouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peaceful\r\nmeans for the adjustment of international differences. It is the most\r\nsolemn declaration against war, the most positive adherence to peace, that\r\nit is possible for sovereign nations to make. It does not supersede our\r\ninalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to\r\ncommit us before the event to any mode of action which the Congress might\r\ndecide to be wise if ever the treaty should be broken. But it is a new\r\nstandard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened\r\nopinion of nations to prevent their governments from being forced into\r\nhostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities. The\r\nobservance of this covenant, so simple and so straightforward, promises more\r\nfor the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated among\r\nthe nations.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nThe first duty of our Government to its own citizens and foreigners within\r\nits borders is the preservation of order. Unless and until that duty is met\r\na government is not even eligible for recognition among the family of\r\nnations. The advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent upon\r\nthat order among the people of different countries which we term peace. To\r\ninsure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at home\r\nand abroad, to preserve order, liberty, and peace by making the law\r\nsupreme, we have an Army and a Navy.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are organized for defensive purposes. Our Army could not be\r\nmuch reduced, but does not need to be increased. Such new housing and\r\nrepairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6-year program in aviation\r\nis being put into effect in both branches of our service.\r\n\r\nOur Navy, according to generally accepted standards, is deficient in\r\ncruisers. We have 10 comparatively new vessels, 22 that are old, and 8 to\r\nbe built. It is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided.\r\nThis matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the Congress\r\nand does not need restatement. The bill before the Senate with the\r\nelimination of the time clause should be passed. We have no intention of\r\ncompeting with any other country. This building program is for necessary\r\nreplacements and to meet our needs for defense.\r\n\r\nThe cost of national defense is stupendous. It has increased $118,000,000\r\nin the past four years. The estimated expenditure for 1930 is $668,000,000.\r\nWhile this is made up of many items it is, after all, mostly dependent upon\r\nnumbers. Our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number of\r\nmen in the Army or the Navy. We have reached the limit of what we ought to\r\nexpend for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that\r\nthis country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic. Many people at home\r\nand abroad, who constantly make this charge, are the same ones who are even\r\nmore solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries. When\r\nsuch assistance is granted, the inevitable result is that we have foreign\r\ninterests. For us to refuse the customary support and protection of such\r\ninterests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this Nation. Our\r\nlargest foreign interests are in the British Empire, France, and Italy.\r\nBecause we are constantly solicitous for those interests, I doubt if anyone\r\nwould suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them any\r\nmilitaristic or imperialistic design. As for smaller countries, we\r\ncertainly do not want any of them. We are more anxious than they are to have\r\ntheir sovereignty respected. Our entire influence is in behalf of their\r\nindependence. Cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle.\r\n\r\nThe position of this Government relative to the limitation of armaments,\r\nthe results already secured, and the developments up to the present time\r\nare so well known to the Congress that they do not require any restatement.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of our present system of veterans' relief is without\r\nprecedent, and the results have been far-reaching. For years a service\r\npension has been granted to the Grand Army and lately to the survivors of\r\nthe Spanish-American War. At the time we entered the World War however,\r\nCongress departed from the usual pension system followed by our\r\nGovernment. Eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted,\r\ninitiating a system of compensation, rehabilitation, hospitalization, and\r\ninsurance for the disabled of the World War and their dependents. The\r\nadministration of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficult\r\ntask, but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothing\r\nin their desire to deal generously and humanely. We should continue to\r\nfoster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequate\r\ncare. It is the conception of our Government that the pension roll is an\r\nhonor roll. It should include all those who are justly entitled to its\r\nbenefits, but exclude all others.\r\n\r\nAnnual expenditures for all forms of veterans' relief now approximate\r\n$765,000,000, and are increasing from year to year. It is doubtful if the\r\npeak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation for\r\nsonic time yet to come. Further amendments to the existing law will be\r\nsuggested by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the\r\nUnited States, the Disabled American Veterans of the World War, and other\r\nlike organizations, and it may be necessary for administrative purposes, or\r\nin order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law, to make\r\nfurther changes. I am sure that such recommendations its may be submitted\r\nto the Congress will receive your careful consideration. But because of the\r\nvast expenditure now being made, each year, with every assurance that it\r\nwill increase, and because of the great liberality of the existing law, the\r\nproposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject should\r\nreceive most searching scrutiny from the Congress.\r\n\r\nYou are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies now\r\ndealing with matters of veterans' relief be consolidated in one Government\r\ndepartment. Some advantages to this plan seem apparent, especially in the\r\nsimplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing about\r\na greater uniformity in the application of veterans' relief. I recommend\r\nthat a survey be made by the proper committees of Congress dealing with\r\nthis subject, in order to determine whether legislation to secure this\r\nconsolidation is desirable.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement in\r\nagriculture. The general purchasing power of farm products and the volume\r\nof production have advanced. This means not only further progress, in\r\novercoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in\r\n1920-21, but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a\r\nwell-grounded confidence in the future of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and is\r\nprospering conspicuously. Dairymen, beef producers, and poultrymen are\r\nreceiving substantially larger returns than last year. Cotton, although\r\nlower in price than at this time last year, was produced in greater volume\r\nand the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable. But progress is never\r\nuniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry. Cash\r\ngrains, hay, tobacco, and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns this\r\nyear than last. Present indications are, however, that the gross farm\r\nincome will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927-28, when the\r\ntotal was $12,253,000,000. The corresponding figure for 1926-27 was\r\n$12,127,000,000, and in 1925-26, $12,670,000,000. Still better results\r\nwould have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase in\r\nthe production of certain crops. This is particularly true of potatoes,\r\nwhich have sold at an unremunerative price, or at a loss, as a direct\r\nresult of overexpansion of acreage.\r\n\r\nThe present status of agriculture, although greatly improved over that of a\r\nfew years ago, bespeaks the need of further improvement which calls for\r\ndetermined effort of farmers themselves, encouraged and assisted by wise\r\npublic policy. The Government has been, and must continue to be, alive to\r\nthe needs of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to\r\nagriculture has been adopted than during any other period. The Department\r\nof Agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater\r\nefficiency. The department is laying greater stress on the economic and\r\nbusiness phases of agriculture. It is lending every possible assistance to\r\ncooperative marketing associations. Regulatory and research work have been\r\nsegregated in order that each field may be served more effectively.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly commend, in the field of fact finding, the research\r\nwork of the Department of Agriculture and the State experiment stations.\r\nThe department now receives annually $4,000,000 more for research than in\r\n1921. In addition, the funds paid to the States for experimentation\r\npurposes under the Purnell Act constitute an annual increase in Federal\r\npayments to State agricultural experiment stations of $2,400,000 over the\r\namount appropriated in 1921. The program of support for research may wisely\r\nbe continued and expanded. Since 1921 we have appropriated nearly an\r\nadditional $2,000,000 for extension work, and this sum is to be increased\r\nnext year under authorization by the Capper-Ketcham Act.\r\n\r\nTHE SURPLUS PROBLEM\r\n\r\nWhile these developments in fundamental research, regulation, and\r\ndissemination of agricultural information are of distinct help to\r\nagriculture, additional effort is needed. The surplus problem demands\r\nattention. As emphasized in my last message, the Government should assume\r\nno responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due to\r\noverextended acreage. The Government should, however, provide reliable\r\ninformation as a guide to private effort; and in this connection fundamental\r\nresearch on prospective supply and demand, as a guide to production and\r\nmarketing, should be encouraged. Expenditure of public funds to bring in\r\nmore new land should have most searching scrutiny, so long as our farmers\r\nface unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land already\r\nunder cultivation.\r\n\r\nEvery proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it is\r\nadapted. The reforestation of land best suited for timber production is\r\nprogressing and should be encouraged, and to this end the forest taxation\r\ninquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy.\r\nImprovement has been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves, not\r\nonly to protect the ranges, but to preserve the soil from erosion. Similar\r\naction is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are now\r\novergrazed and rapidly eroding.\r\n\r\nTemporary expedients, though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands of\r\nthe moment, can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might\r\nseriously aggravate it. Hence putting the Government directly into\r\nbusiness, subsidies, and price fixing, and the alluring promises of\r\npolitical action as a substitute for private initiative, should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe Government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handling\r\nsurpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions. As a beginning\r\nthere should be created a Federal farm board consisting of able and\r\nexperienced men empowered to advise producers' associations in establishing\r\ncentral agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses, to seek\r\nwore economical means of merchandising, and to aid the producer in securing\r\nreturns according to the a14 of his product. A revolving loan fund should\r\nbe provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall have\r\ndeveloped means of financing their operations through regularly constituted\r\ncredit institutions. Such a bill should carry authority for raising the\r\nmoney, by loans or otherwise, necessary to meet the expense, as the\r\nTreasury has no surplus.\r\n\r\nAgriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effort\r\nwhich modern economic life demands. The cooperative movement, which is\r\ngradually building the needed organization, is in harmony with public\r\ninterest and therefore merits public encouragement.\r\n\r\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATES\r\n\r\nImportant phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within the\r\nsphere of the States. While successive reductions in Federal taxes have\r\nrelieved most farmers of direct taxes to the National Government, State and\r\nlocal levies have become a serious burden. This problem needs immediate and\r\nthorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment.\r\nIt will have to be made largely by the States themselves.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the Government continue its helpful attitude toward\r\nAmerican business. The activities of the Department of Commerce have\r\ncontributed largely to the present satisfactory position\r\nin our international trade, which has reached about $9,000,000,000\r\nannually. There should be no slackening of effort in that direction. It is\r\nalso important that the department's assistance to domestic commerce be\r\ncontinued. There is probably no way in which the Government can aid sound\r\neconomic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business\r\nmen to reduce wastes in distribution.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL AERONAUTICS\r\n\r\nContinued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying. Demands for\r\nairplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing and\r\ninspection service of the Department of Commerce to their capacity. While\r\nthe compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only to\r\nequipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, a\r\nFederal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessary\r\nqualifications. State legislation, local airport regulations, and insurance\r\nrequirements make such a license practically indispensable. This results in\r\nuniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation, which are\r\nessential to aeronautical development. Over 17,000 young men and women have\r\nnow applied for Federal air pilot's licenses or permits. More than 80 per\r\ncent of them applied during the past year.\r\n\r\nOur national airway system exceeds 14,000 miles in length and has 7,500\r\nmiles lighted for night operations. Provision has been made for lighting\r\n4,000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equal\r\nmileage with radio facilities. Three-quarters of our people are now served\r\nby these routes. With the rapid growth of air mail, express, and passenger\r\nservice, this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more important\r\nfactor in commerce. It is noteworthy that this development has taken place\r\nwithout governmental subsidies. Commercial passenger flights operating on\r\nschedule have reached 13,000 miles per day.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fortnight this Nation will entertain the nations of the\r\nworld in a celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first\r\nsuccessful airplane flight. The credit for this epoch-making achievement\r\nbelongs to a citizen of our own country, Orville Wright.\r\n\r\nCUBAN PARCEL POST\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message, that Congress\r\nenact the legislation necessary to make permanent the Parcel Post\r\nConvention with Cuba, both as a facility to American commerce and as a\r\nmeasure of equity to Cuba in the one class of goods which that country can\r\nsend here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade.\r\n\r\n\"MAINE\" BATTLESHIP MEMORIAL\r\n\r\nWhen I attended the Pan American Conference at Habana, the President of\r\nCuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that was\r\noverturned by a storm after it was erected on the Cuban shore to the memory\r\nof the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship Maine. As a\r\ntestimony of friendship and appreciation of the Cuban Government and people\r\nhe most generously offered to present this to the United States, and I\r\nassured him of my pleasure in accepting it. There is no location in the\r\nWhite House for placing so large and heavy a structure, and I therefore\r\nurge the Congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be\r\nset up.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS\r\n\r\nIn previous annual messages I have suggested the enactment of laws to\r\npromote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiency\r\nof transportation and lessening its cost to the public. While,\r\nconsolidations can and should be made under the present law until it is\r\nchanged, vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fully\r\nadequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation. Amendments\r\ndesigned to remedy these defects have been considered at length by the\r\nrespective committees of Congress and a bill was reported out late in the\r\nlast session which I understand has the approval in principle of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. It is to be hoped that this legislation may\r\nbe enacted at an early date.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definition\r\nand clarification in several other respects, some of which have been\r\npointed out by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its annual reports to\r\nthe Congress. It will promote the public interest to have the Congress give\r\nearly consideration to the recommendations there made.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT MARINE\r\n\r\nThe cost of maintaining the United States Government merchant fleet has\r\nbeen steadily reduced. We have established American flag lines in foreign\r\ntrade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerce\r\nand as a naval auxiliary. There have been sold to private American capital\r\nfor operation within the past few years 14 of these lines, which, under the\r\nencouragement of the recent legislation passed by the Congress, give\r\npromise of continued successful operation. Additional legislation from time\r\nto time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThrough the cooperation of the Post Office Department and the Shipping\r\nBoard long-term contracts are being made with American steamship lines for\r\ncarrying mail, which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new\r\nvessels and the gradual reestablishment of the American merchant marine as\r\na private enterprise. No action of the National Government has been so\r\nbeneficial to our shipping. The cost is being absorbed to a considerable\r\nextent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the Shipping\r\nBoard, for which the new law has made a market. Meanwhile it should be our\r\npolicy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the Government operation\r\nuntil they can be transferred to private capital.\r\n\r\nINTER-AMERICAN HIGHWAY\r\n\r\nIn my message last year I expressed the view that we should lend our\r\nencouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on this\r\nhemisphere South of the Rio Grande. My view has not changed.\r\n\r\nThe Pan American Union has recently indorsed it. In some of the countries\r\nto the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building. In,\r\nOthers engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult. As\r\nthose countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready to\r\ncontribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier of\r\naccomplishment. I prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end.\r\nWe already furnish military and naval advisors, and following this\r\nprecedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nWe should provide our southern neighbors, if they request it, with such\r\nengineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges. Private\r\ninterests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought by\r\nthese countries to open main lines of travel. Such assistance should be\r\ngiven especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all the\r\ncountries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate, intercourse and closer\r\nrelations among, them.\r\n\r\nAIR MAIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations and the extensive, commercial intercourse with the\r\nWestern Hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the\r\nestablishment and extension of air-mail routes. We shall soon have one from\r\nKey West, Fla., over Cuba, Haiti, and Santo Domingo to San Juan, P. R.,\r\nwhere it will connect with another route to Trinidad. There will be another\r\nroute from Key West to the Canal Zone, where connection will be made with a\r\nroute across the northern coast of South America to Paramaribo. This will\r\ngive us a circle around the Caribbean under our own control. Additional\r\nconnections will be made at Colon with a route running down the west coast\r\nof South America as far as Conception, Chile, and with the French air mail\r\nat Paramaribo running down the eastern coast of South America. The air\r\nservice already spans our continent, with laterals running to Mexico and\r\nCanada, and covering a daily flight of over 28,000 miles, with an average\r\ncargo of 15 000 pounds.\r\n\r\nWATERWAYS\r\n\r\nOur river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor. In the past\r\nfew years Ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work\r\n$28,000,000, besides what is to be expended on flood control. The total\r\nappropriation for this year was over $91,000,000. The Ohio River is almost\r\nready for opening; work on the Missouri and other rivers is under way. In\r\naccordance with the Mississippi flood law Army engineers are making\r\ninvestigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with a\r\nview to flood control, navigation, waterpower, and irrigation. Our barrier\r\nlines are being operated under generous appropriations, and negotiations\r\nare developing relative to the St. Lawrence waterway. To Secure the largest\r\nbenefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with the\r\nrailroads, preferably by agreement, but otherwise as a result of\r\ncongressional action.\r\n\r\nWe have recently passed several river and harbor bills. The work ordered by\r\nthe Congress not, yet completed, will cost about $243,\r\n\r\n000,000, besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the Mississippi\r\nflood way. Until we can see our way out of this expense no further river\r\nand harbor legislation should be passed, as expenditures to put it into\r\neffect would be four or five years away.\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION OF ARID LANDS\r\n\r\nFor many years the Federal Government has been committed to the wise policy\r\nof reclamation and irrigation. While it has met with some failures due to\r\nunwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys, so that\r\nthey could not be placed on a sound business basis, on the whole the\r\nservice has been of such incalculable benefit in so many States that no one\r\nwould advocate its abandonment. The program to which we are already\r\ncommitted, providing for the construction of new projects authorized by\r\nCongress and the completion of old projects, will tax the resources of the\r\nreclamation fund over a period of years. The high cost of improving and\r\nequipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacant\r\nfarms on federal projects.\r\n\r\nReadjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of May 25, 1926,\r\nhave given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers. These new\r\nfinancial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projects\r\nhave resulted in increased collections by the Department of the Interior of\r\ncharges due the reclamation fund. Nevertheless, the demand for still\r\nsmaller yearly payments on some projects continues. These conditions should\r\nhave consideration in connection with any proposed new projects.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO RIVER\r\n\r\nFor several years the Congress has considered the erection of a dam on the\r\nColorado River for flood-control, irrigation, and domestic water purposes,\r\nall of which ma properly be considered as Government functions. There would\r\nbe an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generating\r\nelectricity. As private enterprise can very well fill this field, there is\r\nno need for the Government to go into it. It is unfortunate that the States\r\ninterested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves.\r\nNevertheless, any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the\r\npresent and prospective rights of each of them.\r\n\r\nThe Congress will have before it, the detailed report of a special board\r\nappointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this\r\nproject. From the short summary which I have seen of it, 11 judge they\r\nconsider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased cost\r\nover previous estimates. They prefer the Black Canyon site. On the economic\r\nfeatures they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on many\r\nconditions which can not be established with certainty. So far as I can\r\njudge, however, from the summary, their conclusions appear sufficiently\r\nfavorable, so that I feel warranted in recommending a measure which will\r\nprotect the rights of the States, discharge the necessary Government\r\nfunctions, and leave the electrical field to private enterprise.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nThe development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably render\r\nthis plant less important for that purpose than formerly. But we have it,\r\nand I am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates for\r\nnational defense and farm fertilizers. By dividing the property into its\r\ntwo component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible to\r\ndispose of the power, reserving the right to any concern that wished to\r\nmake nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose. Such\r\na disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rental\r\nabout $2,000,000 per year. If the Congress would giant the Secretary of War\r\nauthority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure the\r\nlargest production of nitrates, the entire property could begin to\r\nfunction. Such a division, I am aware, has never seemed to appeal to the\r\nCongress. I should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to lease\r\nthe entire property for the production of nitrates.\r\n\r\nI wish to avoid building another dam at public expense. Future operators\r\nshould provide for that themselves. But if they were to be required to\r\nrepay the cost of such dam with the prevailing commercial rates for\r\ninterest, this difficulty will be considerably lessened. Nor do I think\r\nthis property should be made a vehicle for putting the United States\r\nGovernment indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power\r\ndistribution and nitrate sales.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION\r\n\r\nThe practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls\r\nfor conservation. This does not mean that every resource should not be\r\ndeveloped to its full degree, but it means that none of them should be\r\nwasted. We have a conservation board working on our oil problem. This is of\r\nthe utmost importance to the future well-being of our people in this age of\r\noil-burning engines and the general application of gasoline to\r\ntransportation. The Secretary of the Interior should not be compelled to\r\nlease oil lands of the Osage Indians when the market is depressed and the\r\nfuture supply is in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nWhile the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small, compared\r\nwith the vast area in private ownership, the natural resources of those in\r\npublic ownership are of immense present and future value. This is\r\nparticularly trite as to minerals and water power. The proper bureaus have\r\nbeen classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved.\r\nAppropriate estimates are being submitted, in the Budget, for the further\r\nprosecution of this important work.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nThe policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained. Authority\r\nshould be granted the Secretary of Labor to give immediate preference to\r\nlearned professions and experts essential to new industries. The reuniting\r\nof families should be expedited. Our immigration and naturalization laws\r\nmight well be codified.\r\n\r\nWAGE EARNER\r\n\r\nIn its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of a\r\nlimitation of the wage fund, which led to pessimism and despair because it\r\nwas the doctrine of perpetual poverty, and has substituted for it the\r\nAmerican conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production,\r\nwhich is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity.\r\nHere and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory that\r\nonly by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of\r\npermanent employment for increasing numbers, but in general, management and\r\nwage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered a\r\nnew era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity\r\nof the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits, the\r\nend of which is not yet. The application of this theory accounts for our\r\nwidening distribution of wealth. No discovery ever did more to increase the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of the people.\r\n\r\nSince 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12.9 per\r\ncent, while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34.9 per\r\ncent and 38 per cent. Even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over\r\n5 per cent and in woolen mills 8.4 per cent, although these industries have\r\nnot prospered like others. As the rise in living costs in this period is\r\nnegligible, these figures represent real wage increases.\r\n\r\nThe cause of constructive economy requires that the Government should\r\ncooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising from\r\nindustrial accidents. This item, with all that has been done to reduce it,\r\nstill reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman and\r\ngreat loss to the country.\r\n\r\nWOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government should continue its solicitous care for the\r\n8,500,000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health,\r\nwhich is reducing infant mortality and improving the bodily and mental\r\ncondition of our citizens.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe most marked change made in the civil service of the Government in the\r\npast eight years relates to the increase in salaries. The Board of\r\nActuaries on the retirement act shows by its report, that July 1, 1921 the\r\naverage salary of the 330,047 employees subject to the act was $1,307,\r\nwhile on June 30, 1927, the average salary of the corresponding 405,263\r\nwas $1,969. This was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent. On top\r\nof this was the generous increase made at the last session of the Congress\r\ngenerally applicable to Federal employees and another bill increasing the\r\npay in certain branches of the Postal Service beyond the large increase\r\nwhich was made three years ago. This raised the average level from $1,969\r\nto $2,092, making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent. While it\r\nis well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the Federal\r\nservice is much smaller than in private employment, in the lower brackets,\r\nranging well up over $3,000, it is much higher. It is higher not only in\r\nactual money paid, but in privileges granted, a vacation of 30 actual\r\nworking days, or 5 weeks each year, with additional time running in some\r\ndepartments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisions\r\nof the retirement act. No other body of public servants ever occupied such\r\na fortunate position.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nThrough the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior the\r\nFederal Government, acting in an informative and advisory capacity, has\r\nrendered valuable service. While this province belongs peculiarly to the\r\nStates, yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educational\r\nmethods is a general responsibility of the Federal Government. A survey of\r\nnegro colleges and universities in the United States has just been\r\ncompleted by the Bureau of Education through funds provided by the\r\ninstitutions themselves and through private sources. The present status of\r\nnegro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for its\r\nadvancement. This was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of the\r\nbureau. Following the invitation of the Association of Land Grant Colleges\r\nand Universities, he Bureau of Education now has under way the survey of\r\nagricultural colleges, authorized by Congress. The purpose of the survey is\r\nto ascertain the accomplishments, the status, and the future objectives of\r\nthis type of educational training. It is now proposed to undertake a survey\r\nof secondary schools, which educators insist is timely and essential.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nWe, have laid out a public building program for the District of Columbia\r\nand the country at large running into hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\nThree important structures and one annex are already, under way and one\r\naddition has been completed in the City of Washington. in the country sites\r\nhave been acquired, many buildings are in course of construction, and some\r\nare already completed. Plans for all this work are being prepared in order\r\nthat it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible. This is the greatest\r\nbuilding program ever assumed by this Nation. It contemplates structures of\r\nutility and of beauty. When it reaches completion the people will be well\r\nserved and the Federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful and\r\nstately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN INDIAN\r\n\r\nThe administration of Indian affairs has been receiving intensive study for\r\nseveral years. The Department of the Interior has been able to provide\r\nbetter supervision of health, education, and industrial advancement of this\r\nnative race through additional funds provided by the Congress. The present\r\ncooperative arrangement existing between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and\r\nthe Public Health Service should be extended. The Government's\r\nresponsibility to the American Indian has been acknowledged by annual\r\nincreases in appropriations to fulfill its obligations to them and to\r\nhasten the time when Federal supervision of their affairs may be properly\r\nand safely terminated. The movement in Congress and in some of the State\r\nlegislatures for extending responsibility in Indian affairs to States\r\nshould be encouraged. A complete participation by the Indian in our\r\neconomic life is the end to be desired.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO\r\n\r\nFor 65 years now our negro Population has been under the peculiar care and\r\nsolicitude of the National Government. The progress which they have made in\r\neducation and the professions, in wealth and in the arts of civilization,\r\naffords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of world\r\nhistory. They have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantages\r\nof our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independent\r\nexistence. Whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume,\r\nthe status granted to them by the Constitution of this Union is being\r\nrapidly dissipated. Their cooperation in the life of the Nation is\r\nconstantly enlarging.\r\n\r\nExploiting the Negro problem for political ends is being abandoned and\r\ntheir protection is being increased by those States in which their\r\npercentage of population is largest. Every encouragement should be extended\r\nfor t le development of the race. The colored people have been the victims\r\nof the crime of lynching, which has in late years somewhat decreased. Some\r\nparts of the South already have wholesome laws for its restraint and\r\npunishment. Their example might well be followed by other States, and by\r\nsuch immediate remedial legislation as the Federal Government can extend\r\nunder the Constitution.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE ISLANDS\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of Governor General Stimson the economic and political\r\nconditions of the Philippine Islands have been raised to a standard never\r\nbefore surpassed. The cooperation between his administration and the people\r\nof the islands is complete and harmonious. It would be an advantage if\r\nrelief from double taxation could be granted by the Congress to our\r\ncitizens doing business in the islands.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO\r\n\r\nDue to the terrific storm that swept Porto Rico last September, the people\r\nof that island suffered large losses. The Red Cross and the War Department\r\nwent to their rescue. The property loss is being, retrieved. Sugar,\r\ntobacco, citrus fruit, and coffee, all suffered damage. The first three can\r\nlargely look after themselves. The coffee growers will need some\r\nassistance, which should be extended strictly on a business basis, and\r\nonly after most careful investigation. The people of Porto Rico are not\r\nasking for charity.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that all the legal activities of the Government be\r\nconsolidated under the supervision of the Attorney General. In\r\n1870 it was felt necessary to create the Department of Justice for this\r\npurpose. During the intervening period, either through legislation creating\r\nlaw officers or departmental action, additional legal positions not under\r\nthe supervision of the Attorney General have been provided until there are\r\nnow over 900. Such a condition is as harmful to the interest of the\r\nGovernment now as it was in 1870, and should be corrected by appropriate\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL GOVERNMENT COUNSEL\r\n\r\nIn order to prosecute the oil cases, I suggested and the Congress enacted a\r\nlaw providing for the appointment of two special counsel. They have pursued\r\ntheir work with signal ability, recovering all the leased lands besides\r\nnearly $30,000,000 in money, and nearly $17,000,000 in other property. They\r\nfind themselves hampered by a statute, which the Attorney General construes\r\nas applying to them, prohibiting their appearing for private clients before\r\nany department. For this reason, one has been compelled to resign. No good\r\nresult is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel, and as\r\nMr. Roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated I\r\nrecommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their office\r\nexempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involving\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment. Those who object to\r\nit have the right to advocate its modification or repeal. Meantime, it is\r\nbinding upon the National and State Governments and all our inhabitants.\r\nThe Federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to prevent\r\nviolations, especially through smuggling, manufacture, and transportation,\r\nand to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence.\r\nIt is bound to continue this policy. Under the terms of the Constitution,\r\nhowever, the obligation is equally on the States to exercise the power\r\nwhich they have through the executive, legislative, judicial, and police\r\nbranches of their governments in behalf of enforcement. The Federal\r\nGovernment is doing and will continue to do all it can in this direction\r\nand is entitled to the active cooperation of the States.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of\r\npeace more permanent than it has ever before experienced. But, having\r\nreached this position, we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily\r\nbe lost. It needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places\r\nof the world. We shall not be permitted to take our case, but shall\r\ncontinue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil. The actions\r\nof the Government must command the confidence of the country. Without this,\r\nour prosperity would be lost. We must extend to other countries the largest\r\nmeasure of generosity, moderation, and patience. In addition to dealing\r\njustly, we can well afford to walk humbly.\r\n\r\nThe end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a more\r\nabundant life. Peace and prosperity are not finalities; they are only\r\nmethods. It is too easy under their influence for a nation to become\r\nselfish and degenerate. This test has come to the United States. Our\r\ncountry has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge its\r\nintellectual, moral, and spiritual life. The issue is in the hands of the\r\npeople. Our faith in man and God is the justification for the belief in our\r\ncontinuing success.",
