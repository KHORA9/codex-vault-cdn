FRY\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOSTON\r\n  SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY\r\n  PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1922\r\n  BY SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY\r\n  (INCORPORATED)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Printed in the United States of America\r\n\r\n  THE MURRAY PRINTING COMPANY\r\n  CAMBRIDGE, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that, in narrating events and analyzing an organization\r\nexisting in the United States of America in the year 1921, the most\r\nappropriate introduction to the subject consists of a few pages from the\r\nhistory of Germany during the Middle Ages. There existed in mediaeval\r\nGermany a secret organization, which, in its highest stage of development\r\nis said to have numbered over 200,000 members--the _Vehmgericht_, or\r\nsecret tribunal. Its origin is clouded in obscurity, some authorities\r\nclaiming that the system was first founded by Charlemagne, while others\r\nsay that it was handed down from the most remote pre-historic Germans, but\r\nis understood generally to have first appeared in the year 1180 in\r\nWestphalia, after which it scattered all over Germany.\r\n\r\nIts head was the Emperor, assisted by the nobles of his court, and with\r\nthem men of all ranks, associated together for the formation of \"free\r\ncourts,\" to try persons accused of crimes against persons and property.\r\nThe members of the organization were known as \"_Wissende_,\" or initiated\r\nones. They were bound by solemn oaths not to reveal the circumstances of a\r\ntrial or the sentence imposed on the offender if found guilty; and in\r\norder to become one of the brotherhood the applicant was required to be\r\nof good character, and have two sureties who were already \"free judges.\" A\r\nceremony of initiation, usually held in some out-of-the-way place,\r\ninducted the outsider into the organization, and thereafter, he was\r\nrequired under his solemn oath never to reveal the fact that he was a\r\nmember of the brotherhood. The initiated ones recognized each other by\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nThe _Vehmgericht_ could be summoned at any time and place, in private\r\nbuildings, in the forests, in caves, or in the open fields; they were\r\noccasionally held publicly, but usually they were closed against all but\r\nthe initiated and the accused person. The Emperor, or, in his absence, the\r\ncount or noble of highest dignity presided, and if any uninitiated person\r\nintruded, he was immediately put to death. The secret tribunal met when\r\nnecessary and received complaints, to answer which they assumed the right\r\nto summon any one in Germany. Ordinarily, the accused was arrested and\r\nheld by his captors for the secret trial, but if he had not been arrested,\r\nhe was summoned to appear by fastening on his door or gateway the summons\r\nof the dreaded court, which usually had enclosed in it a small coin. If he\r\nfailed to appear or send a messenger, he was condemned, as despising the\r\njurisdiction of the Holy _Vehmgericht_, and once condemned there was\r\nlittle chance of his life while he remained in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of an offender by a Vehmic Court was known to the whole\r\nbrotherhood in a short time; and even if it were the father, brother, or\r\nson of one of the initiated who was condemned, he not only might not warn\r\nhim of his danger, but was bound to aid in putting him to death under\r\npenalty of losing his own life.\r\n\r\nThe death penalty, the usual decree of the court, was generally inflicted\r\nby hanging. When executed the victim was hanged to the nearest tree,\r\nnothing of value which he might have about him being removed, and a knife\r\nwas thrust into the ground as a token that the deed had been committed by\r\norder of the brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe _Vehmgericht_, although an irresponsible tribunal possessing this\r\nextensive and dreadful authority, became a power so formidable that\r\nCharles IV, in 1371, stipulated for its official recognition. Exercising\r\nits despotic dominion under such obligations of severity, the brotherhood,\r\nhowever, in 1461, incurred the hostility of those who feared to become its\r\nvictims, as well as those who saw in it an engine capable of terrible\r\noppression, and an association was formed to resist it. The result was\r\nthat, in 1495, Maximilian I established a new criminal code, materially\r\nweakening the secret tribunals. Secret trials are said to have been held\r\nas late as 1811, although the brotherhood ceased to excite terror or exert\r\nany considerable influence before the close of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1914 the prosaic American people, self-satisfied in a\r\nnational peace and prosperity that superficially appeared to be a\r\npermanent condition, were suddenly awakened to find themselves spectators\r\nof the great drama staged by Emperor William Hohenzollern, who suddenly\r\nplunged all Europe into the throes of a Napoleonic war.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1915 another \"Emperor\"--this time an American--conceived a\r\nscheme, which, instead of reversing time merely for one hundred years,\r\nwould take the nation back to the days of German mediaevalism--back to the\r\n_Vehmgericht_, the secret tribunal and the days of irresponsible\r\ngovernment clandestinely administered.\r\n\r\nThis monstrosity, conceived in a brain that must have been either inanely\r\nvisionary or superlatively cunning, has been let loose in the land, where\r\nfor the past twelve months, it has been vigorously propagated by a highly\r\norganized, highly industrious, and highly paid force of experienced and\r\ntrained propagandists. Its appeal is to group hatred and group prejudice;\r\nits organization, which is strictly secret, has, in some of its units,\r\nalready followed the methods of the _Vehmgericht_; the title of its\r\n\"wizard\" comes from the \"_Wissende_\" or initiated of the German\r\nbrotherhood; its structure is military; its aims are political; and,\r\nopenly calling itself the \"Invisible Empire,\" it is an autocracy in\r\ngovernment, ruled by an \"Emperor\" who has placed himself on the throne for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was my privilege to have been a member--one of the \"_Wissende_\"--in\r\nthis secret movement, which is legally known as the Knights of the Ku Klux\r\nKlan; and I had the opportunity of investigating it from the inside,\r\nobserving its direful potentialities.\r\n\r\nWhen I became thorough acquainted with the thing, I withdrew from it, as I\r\nfelt that it was dangerous, vicious and absolutely out of place in the\r\nAmerican Republic. I therefore decided to expose it, and to make the\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" visible to the people of the United States. To\r\naccomplish this desired end, I turned over to the _New York World_ all of\r\nthe information I possessed; and that great newspaper, after three months\r\nof nation-wide investigation, told the people the truth about Ku Kluxism,\r\nand the \"Invisible Empire.\"\r\n\r\nSupplementary to the work of the _New York World_, I offer this book,\r\nwhich consists largely of articles written as an investigator for that\r\nnewspaper, many of which were used as a basis for its investigations. To\r\nthe _World_ belongs all the credit for this exposure and investigation,\r\nand when the American people fully understand and thoroughly realize what\r\nKu Kluxism means, they will, of course, feel obligated to the _World_ for\r\nits work in undertaking and carrying out the task of eliminating this\r\nun-American movement from this country.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wish to express my deep appreciation to Mr. Herbert B.\r\nSwope, Executive Editor, Mr. William P. Beazell, Assistant Managing\r\nEditor, and Mr. Rowland Thomas, of the _New York World_, both for having\r\ntaken hold of the matter and so ably handling it, and also for their many\r\nacts of courtesy shown to me while the work was in progress.\r\n\r\nHENRY P.

We had an awful oath to which we swore,\r\nand in imitation of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, sealed it with our\r\nblood. We had no fees or dues, but each boy was required to contribute a\r\ncopy of _Nick Carter_ or _Diamond Dick_ or _Old Cap Collier_. The\r\norganization survived a brief period and was then ruthlessly destroyed by\r\nan irate parent who disapproved of its intellectual standards.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely reached the age of twenty-one and started life in\r\nChattanooga as a newspaper reporter, when I took up seriously the habit of\r\njoining fraternal orders. In five years I had taken degrees in practically\r\nevery one to which I was eligible. I became a Mason, a Knight of Pythias,\r\nan Odd Fellow, a Red Man, a member of the Junior Order United American\r\nMechanics, of the Royal Arcanum, of the Woodmen, an Elk, an Eagle, an Owl,\r\nand an associate member of the Theatrical Mechanics Association.\r\n\r\nThe last \"order\" I joined was the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nI went into this one partly because I was a joiner and was curious to see\r\nwhat it was all about, but principally because I thought it was a\r\nfraternal order which was actually a revival of the original Ku Klux Klan\r\nwhich played so important a part in the history of the South during the\r\ndays of the Reconstruction. That old organization has always had a certain\r\nglamour for me as it has for every Southerner, and I could see no reason\r\nwhy a fraternal order commemorating the deeds of the original Klansmen\r\nshould not fill a need in the country today. I knew absolutely nothing\r\nabout the structure of the new Ku Klux Klan, took it on faith, and assumed\r\nthat in its government and administration, it would function like any\r\nother of the standard fraternal orders. I thought, from the meager\r\ninformation with which I was furnished, that I was thoroughly in accord\r\nwith its principles, and that it would be more or less a pleasure to\r\nbelong to it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Ku Klux Klan I took an immediate interest in the work\r\nof the organizer, brought him into touch with prominent friends of mine\r\nwhom I induced to join, and did all I could to make his work a success.\r\nShortly afterward I was made one of the organizers, and in this capacity\r\ndevoted nearly all my time for three months to the work, conferring\r\ndegrees, talking to people who were in favor of the Klan and to some who\r\nwere opposed, and carefully studying the entire system of organization.\r\n\r\nThe fraternal order man who can really visualize an organization is the\r\nman who absorbs its work by observation and study, and there is no better\r\nmethod of doing this than performing the duties of an organizer. In my\r\nwork as an organizer for the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, I was first\r\nimpressed with the fact, that, on account of its radical nature, it was\r\ndangerous. The first thing to which a candidate is enjoined is absolute\r\nsecrecy. This is carried to the utmost extremity. A newly made \"citizen\"\r\nmust not tell his wife or his family that he belongs to the organization,\r\nand must give no hint of it to his most intimate friends and business\r\nassociates. I at once saw that any movement built along such a line was\r\ndangerous, regardless of its intentions, because secrecy of this sort\r\nplaces upon the organization the vital necessity of receiving as members\r\nonly men of the highest character whose positions and reputations in the\r\ncommunity would be an absolute safeguard against mischief. A secret\r\norganization composed of men of a low standard of civic responsibility\r\nwould be the worst thing that could get into any community.\r\n\r\nMy experience as a fraternal order man has been that the personnel of the\r\norder varies with different localities. Therefore, while it might be\r\nperfectly proper to build a strictly secret organization in Kingsport,\r\nTennessee, there might be, in another town an entirely different class of\r\nmembership which would cause the movement to jeopardize the peace and\r\ndignity of the community. The potential danger of the Ku Klux organization\r\nin this respect was the first thing that dawned upon my consciousness, and\r\nit made me careful of the class of people whom I permitted to become\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nMy duties took me into several towns, and night after night I administered\r\nthe obligation and put on the degree work until I became thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the mechanical end of it. Gradually, however, a feeling\r\ndeveloped within me that there was something wrong with the\r\norganization--that it was not the sort of \"fraternal society\" to which I\r\nhad been accustomed for nearly twenty years. I thought at first that this\r\nwas due to the fact that I had done so much lodge work in my lifetime that\r\nI was growing stale. But certain portions of the obligation, which at\r\nfirst had seemed merely perfunctory, stood out in my mind and challenged\r\nserious thought and consideration.\r\n\r\nI studied everything I could find to help me in my work; I received\r\nprinted matter from the organization: I talked with Klansmen from other\r\ncities; and I delved deeply into the origin and history of the original Ku\r\nKlux Klan. But business men of standing and prominence in the places where\r\nI worked asked me pointed questions about the organization, questions that\r\nI could not answer and on which I could get no satisfactory answers from\r\nabove. Slowly my vague fears that there was something vitally wrong\r\ncrystallized into stronger belief. I spoke to a few close friends in the\r\norganization, and asked them to give me their frank opinions about it.\r\nWithout any prompting from me they voiced the same thoughts and gave\r\nexpressions to the same doubts I had myself.\r\n\r\nAfter much thoughtful deliberation, I reached the decision that the Ku\r\nKlux obligation was radically wrong. It was not the kind of obligation men\r\ntake in _fraternal_ organizations--it was a _political_ obligation. I saw\r\nthat the ritual, which had previously been to me merely a badly written\r\nmass of words was really a sacriligious mockery. I realized that the whole\r\nscheme was vicious in principle, and a menace to the peace and safety of\r\nAmerica. The basis for these conclusions can be stated briefly:\r\n\r\n_First_: While the organization was incorporated under the laws of the\r\nState of Georgia, as a fraternal order, the claim being advanced by the\r\npromoters that it should have similar powers to the Masons and Knights of\r\nPythias, it is not a fraternal organization in the sense usually\r\nunderstood, but an attempt to create in this republic of ours an\r\n\"Invisible Empire,\" entirely political and military in nature and designed\r\nto function bodily.\r\n\r\n_Second_: The \"Invisible Empire\" is under the control of one man who\r\nopenly calls himself an \"Emperor,\" holds position for life, and exercises\r\ndespotic control over the affairs of the organization.\r\n\r\n_Third_: Candidates--designated as \"aliens\"--who are received into the\r\norganization, are not regarded as \"members,\" but as \"citizens\" of this\r\n\"Invisible Empire,\" and instead of being \"initiated,\" as is usually the\r\ncase in fraternal orders, are \"naturalized\" and become \"subjects\" of the\r\n\"Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n_Fourth_: Membership is restricted to a limited class of American\r\ncitizens, including only white, Gentile, American-born Protestants, all\r\nother Americans being ineligible.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_: In propagating this \"Invisible Empire,\" the work, which is being\r\ndone all over the United States by a highly paid and highly efficient\r\nfield force, is being carried on by stirring up prejudice and hatred\r\nagainst the Catholic, the Jew, the negro, and the foreign-born American\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n_Sixth_: Under the claim of the enforcement of \"law and order,\" the\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" is attempting to take into its grasp the entire\r\nlaw-enforcing machinery of the United States, including the officers and\r\nmen of the Regular Army and Reserve Corps, the National Guard, sheriffs\r\nand their deputies, mayors, police officials and men, judges and all\r\npersons connected with law administration, with the exception of those\r\nineligible under the rules above stated.\r\n\r\n_Seventh_: The \"citizens\" of the \"Invisible Empire\" are urged by the\r\norganization to purchase white robes and helmets, which are used for the\r\npurpose of going abroad in disguise for the concealment of the identity of\r\nthe wearer, and in many localities there have been parades and\r\ndemonstrations of strength made by the organization, all having the effect\r\nof intimidating certain classes of people of these communities.\r\n\r\n_Eighth_: The sale of these robes is a monopoly in the hands of the Gate\r\nCity Manufacturing Company, a concern associated with the organization,\r\nand from this monopoly somebody is deriving an enormous revenue.\r\n\r\n_Ninth_: The propagation of the organization is being conducted in such a\r\nway that it is clearly a money-making scheme run for the benefit of a few\r\ninsiders.\r\n\r\n_Tenth_: The claim that this is the \"genuine original Klan\" is a\r\nhistorical fraud, not supported by the history and prescript of the old\r\nKlan which are available for public inspection.\r\n\r\n_Eleventh_: The Ku Klux propaganda is vicious, un-American and evil and\r\nwill have a tendency to stir up racial and religious hatred in this\r\ncountry to such an extent as to result, unless checked, in a serious\r\nreligious-racial war.\r\n\r\n_Twelfth_: The ritualistic work, while clumsy, ignorant, plagiaristic, and\r\npoorly written is an attempt to use the cloak of religion to promote the\r\nfinancial fortunes of the insiders; and its principal feature--the\r\nceremony of \"naturalization\"--is a mockery and parody on the sacred and\r\nholy rite of baptism.\r\n\r\n_Thirteenth_: The organization should be exposed for what it is, and the\r\nCongress of the United States should enact suitable legislation to make it\r\nillegal and bar its literature and propaganda from the mails.\r\n\r\n_Fourteenth_: Suitable and necessary legislation should be enacted by\r\nCongress and the State legislatures of a general nature which will forever\r\nprevent the organization and operation of a secret movement of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe portentous nature of my conclusions, however, weighed heavily upon me,\r\nand after the most serious consideration, I finally decided to repudiate\r\nthe entire organization, and as an American citizen to expose the whole\r\nsystem, calling public attention to what seems to me to be the greatest\r\nmenace that has ever been launched in this country.\r\n\r\nMy decision to take this step was a most difficult one to reach. In the\r\nfirst place, to give to the public the facts and inside workings of the\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" means to subject oneself to the penalty of death for\r\ndisclosing a secret of the order. This is stated unequivocally in the\r\nsecret Ku Klux ritual. It also means becoming the target for a torrent of\r\nabuse that is likely to tear one to shreds before it has spent its fury.\r\n\r\nThe most disagreeable feature of the whole procedure is the absolute\r\nnecessity of going on record publicly as violating a solemn oath, a pledge\r\nof honor, and an obligation that would ordinarily be considered sacred. Is\r\na man, having taken an oath, ever justified in breaking it? In my opinion,\r\nwhen one is convinced that the oath in question is illegal, and that a\r\ncertain portion of it is of a nature to incite riot and lawlessness, a man\r\nis not only justified in breaking it, but is morally required to break it.\r\nIt is a public duty he owes the state. The inherent strength of the\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" lies in the fact that its \"citizens\" having once taken\r\nits vicious obligation will not dare to violate it.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, deliberately and with careful thought, decided to\r\nviolate and repudiate this obligation, with the exception of a certain\r\nportion pledging allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and\r\nmy State, which portion is, in my judgment, mere camouflage for the\r\npurpose of concealing the fangs of the rattlesnake. The question as to\r\nwhether I am right or wrong is one that will have to be decided by public\r\nopinion. If I have divulged facts and exposed the secret workings of what\r\nis merely a _fraternal_ organization, then I am unquestionably guilty of\r\nreprehensible conduct. If I am wrong in my viewpoint, I do not deserve to\r\nbe allowed to mingle with honorable men and women, and should be set apart\r\nfrom my fellows as a social outcast.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I am right in the stand that I take, that the Ku\r\nKlux Klan is a secret, political, military machine, actually developing\r\ninto an \"Invisible Empire\" and possessing potentialities that may\r\nundermine the very idea of representative government; if I am correct in\r\nmy position that the whole scheme is an attempt to create class hatred and\r\nantagonism, which in the end will array race against race, class against\r\nclass, and religion against religion; if my contention is just that the\r\nproposition is a money-making scheme; and, if the public adopts my\r\nviewpoint to the extent of demanding that the organization be legislated\r\nout of existence and made an outlaw in the world of open things, then I\r\nshall feel satisfied that the violation of this oath has been a public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThere is no middle ground. I am either entirely right, or else I am\r\nentirely wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJOINING THE KU KLUX KLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first intimate contact with the \"Invisible Empire\" took place in upper\r\nEast Tennessee, a section of the United States where one would least\r\nexpect such a movement to take a definite foothold. There is practically\r\nno racial friction whatever in this section. The negro population is not\r\nlarge, and the negroes themselves are orderly and well-behaved people,\r\nindustrious and well liked by the white people. A remarkable thing about\r\nEast Tennessee is the scarcity of Jews. It is very doubtful if a careful\r\nsearch of the entire fifteen counties would disclose enough Jewish people\r\nto fill a synagogue. There is likewise a paucity of foreign population,\r\nfor, with the exception of a few Greeks, the foreign element seems\r\nstrangely absent. It is also remarkable that in this section the Roman\r\nCatholic religion does not seem to have been able to take root. While\r\nthere is a small Catholic Church in Johnson City, and one in Greeneville\r\nthat is opened but once a year, the other places have few, if any,\r\nCatholics in them. It is doubtful if one could find in all America a group\r\nof people who appear to be more overwhelmingly Americans or more\r\nuniformly Protestant in their religious views than the inhabitants of this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1921, I was sent by a Chattanooga business house with which I\r\nhad been connected for some time, on an extended trip through East\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nIn February I arrived at Johnson City, intending to make that my\r\nheadquarters and visit the other towns, which are easy of access. Early in\r\nMarch, 1921, I noticed a young man of pleasing personality, but I had\r\nnever talked with him until the morning of March 16, when we were thrown\r\ntogether at the breakfast table.\r\n\r\n\"What are you selling?\" I asked, taking it for granted that he was a\r\ntraveling salesman.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the Masonic emblem I wore on my coat, smiled and handed me a\r\nclipping from the _Johnson City Staff_, stating that the organizer of the\r\nKu Klux Klan was in town seeking recruits, but that people did not want\r\nthe Klan, and expressing the hope that the vagrancy laws would take care\r\nof the worker for the movement.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was immediately aroused, and after the organizer had\r\ncarefully examined my Masonic and Knights of Pythias cards, we had a long\r\ntalk together. He was an excellent salesman of his proposition, and in a\r\nfew minutes he had me completely sold. In response to questions, I seemed\r\nto qualify, for the organizer, or Kleagle, as he is officially called,\r\ntold me to hold myself in readiness and he would take me in that night.\r\nWhen evening came, I accompanied the Kleagle to the office of a prominent\r\nbusiness man who had assembled his brother and his entire office force,\r\nand nine of us were taken into the \"Invisible Empire,\" Knights of the Ku\r\nKlux Klan. The ceremony of \"naturalization\" was held in an inner office,\r\nthe Kleagle wearing his white robe, with cape lined with red satin, and\r\nhis peaked helmet with mask in which were cut two eye holes. It was my\r\nfirst glimpse of the Ku Klux regalia.\r\n\r\nNext day, the Kleagle met me at breakfast again, and stated that he was\r\ncompelled to go back to Knoxville, which was his headquarters, and asked\r\nme if I would not take hold of the work for a week, acting as his\r\nrepresentative during his absence. He stated that, on account of newspaper\r\nopposition, he had been unable to make any rapid progress, but believed\r\nthat on account of my more extensive acquaintance I could render some\r\nvaluable service to the cause. This I agreed to do for him, and during the\r\nday was instructed in many matters connected with the soliciting work. On\r\none point, he was very emphatic. \"In your work,\" he said, \"it is advisable\r\nto get the mayor, the sheriff and his deputies if they are eligible, and\r\nthe police department. Also we want the telephone and telegraph people,\r\nand the better class of railroaders.\" With this special injunction, the\r\nKleagle boarded the train for Knoxville, and left me in charge of the\r\nfield, first notifying the Klansmen that he had so designated me.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 1921, the Kleagle was suddenly called to Atlanta for a\r\nconference with the Imperial Kleagle, or chief organizer, and notified me\r\nthat I should have to take charge of the work temporarily during his\r\nabsence. He returned, however, on the evening of April 8, 1921, in time to\r\nobligate a class of thirty-six men whom I had waiting for him. He brought\r\nwith him a commission as Kleagle made out in my name, and placed me in\r\ncharge of the field, with the statement that he had been made a King\r\nKleagle in another field. That night we conferred until very late, going\r\nover the entire work, and I had several papers which had to be made out.\r\nOne of these papers was one of the most remarkable documents I have ever\r\nseen. It is called the \"Kleagle's Pledge of Loyalty,\" and reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"I, the undersigned, in order to be a regular appointed Kleagle of\r\n     the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (Incorporated), do\r\n     freely and voluntarily promise, pledge and fully guarantee a lofty\r\n     respect, whole-hearted loyalty and unwavering devotion at all times\r\n     and under all circumstances and conditions from this day and date\r\n     forward to William Joseph Simmons as Imperial Wizard and Emperor of\r\n     the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (Incorporated). I\r\n     shall work in all respects in perfect harmony with him and under his\r\n     authority and directions, in all his plans for the extension and\r\n     government of the Society, and under his directions, with any and all\r\n     of my officially superior officers duly appointed by him.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall at any and all times be faithful and true in all things, and\r\n     most especially in preventing and suppressing any factions, cisms or\r\n     conspiracies against him or his plans and purposes for the peace and\r\n     harmony of the Society which may arise or attempt to rise. I shall\r\n     discourage and strenuously oppose any degree of disloyalty or\r\n     disrespect on the part of myself or any klansman, anywhere and at any\r\n     time or place, towards him as the founder and as the supreme chief\r\n     governing head of the Society above named.\r\n\r\n     \"This pledge, promise and guarantee I make as a condition precedent\r\n     to my appointment stated above, and the continuity of my appointment\r\n     as a Kleagle, and it is fully agreed that any deviation by me from\r\n     this pledge will instantly automatically cancel and completely void\r\n     my appointment together with all its prerogatives, my membership in\r\n     the Society, and I shall forfeit all remunerations which may be then\r\n     due me.\r\n\r\n     \"I make this solemn pledge on my Oath of Allegiance and on my\r\n     integrity and honor as a man and as a klansman, with serious purpose\r\n     to keep same inviolate.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in studying the foregoing document that the pledge is not\r\nto the organization, but to _William Joseph Simmons_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this \"pledge of loyalty\" to \"Emperor\" Simmons, I was also\r\nrequired to sign an application for an indemnity bond, which was an\r\nagreement, not to indemnify the organization from loss, but to indemnify\r\n_William J. Simmons_ in the sum of one thousand dollars. The application\r\nfor employment, which in my case, was made after I was employed, was also\r\ndirected to the \"Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMY WITHDRAWAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if one could find anywhere in the country a finer, cleaner\r\nor better lot of men than those among whom I worked as an agent of Ku\r\nKluxism. As individuals they were successful business and professional\r\nmen, nearly all of them devout church members, married men with families,\r\nand just the sort of men to make up a prosperous community; yet, in spite\r\nof all this it seemed to me that the protection afforded by membership in\r\nan ultra secret movement like the \"Invisible Empire\" tended to inculcate\r\nlawlessness even among some of them. There is but little original\r\nlaw-breaking in this world. Most of it is due to precedent or suggestion.\r\nThe power of suggestion is one of the most potent factors in every phase\r\nof human activity, and I believe that the mere fact of being a member of\r\nan organization that can go abroad in the land white-robed and masked is a\r\nsuggestive force that encourages men to take the law into their own hands.\r\n\r\nTwo striking illustrations of this point recall themselves to my mind. In\r\none case a man who stood very high in the Johnson City Klan was talking\r\nwith me about a public demonstration. He stated that he was not in favor\r\nof making any show of strength until the Klan had at least five hundred\r\nmembers, then he wanted to have everybody put on their robes, pile into\r\nautomobiles and parade the streets. I called his attention to the\r\nprovisions of the Code of Tennessee in reference to wearing masks in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he replied, \"when we are fully organized the Klan\r\nwill control the politics of this town. We will apply for a permit, and if\r\nwe don't get it, we will parade anyhow. Nobody will dare stop us.\"\r\n\r\nThe other instance was a conversation I had with a man with whom I was\r\nmost friendly. He was a younger man than the one just mentioned, but is\r\nconsidered a person of responsibility and good judgment. It happened that\r\nthe largest restaurant in Johnson City is owned and operated by Greeks,\r\nand this man seemed to be especially hostile to foreigners. In discussing\r\nthem one day he said to me:\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to see these Greeks make such progress here. They are\r\ndriving good Americans out of business. We've got twenty-eight robes in\r\nour lodge room, and I am in favor of getting a bunch some night, breaking\r\nopen their restaurant and dumping all their fixtures and merchandise into\r\nthe streets. That will serve as an object lesson that they are not wanted\r\nin Johnson City.\"\r\n\r\nNow, from my knowledge of that man I do not believe that he would\r\ndeliberately violate the law. In fact, if I were sheriff of his county\r\nand wanted a real man to head a posse, I would call on this man and swear\r\nhim in as a deputy. I doubt very much if he would even lead a mob of\r\nmasked men to tear up a Greek restaurant, but the mob spirit was there,\r\nand it was put there because he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nThe old Ku Klux Klan performed its functions, not so much by overt acts,\r\nas by creating the impression of what it could do and by inspiring terror\r\nin the minds of the people it desired to reach. It operated largely on the\r\nprinciple of suggestion. It soon began to appear to me that the modern\r\nmovement began to plant evil suggestions in the minds of some of its\r\nmembers, almost from the time they became connected with the organization.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first time that a Ku Klux organizer set foot in town, the\r\n_Johnson City Staff_ had fearlessly and vigorously condemned the movement\r\nand advised its readers to have nothing to do with it. As the movement\r\nbegan to grow, many of the leading business men became Klansmen. They were\r\nnearly all advertisers in the local paper. The attacks on the Klan by the\r\n_Staff_ were the subjects of many discussions, and it was decided to \"put\r\na muzzle on the paper.\" Accordingly many advertisers quietly suggested to\r\nthe publisher of the paper that he \"lay off\" the Ku Klux Klan. Whether\r\nthis advice was accompanied by threats or by the actual withdrawal of\r\nbusiness, I do not know, but I do know that the _Staff_ suddenly \"pulled\r\nin its horns\" and remained muzzled up to the time I left the territory.\r\nThis incident is cited to show the power of this ultra-secret system in\r\neffectively paralyzing the freedom of the press, and what has doubtless\r\nhappened in other towns and cities where Ku Kluxism has thoroughly\r\ninoculated communities with its deadly poison.\r\n\r\nWhile working among the different towns in my territory, we noticed in the\r\npapers occasionally a reference to some act of lawlessness or violence\r\ncommitted in other States by men disguised in white robes and masks. As\r\nthe details, at the time, were very meager, and as the Atlanta\r\nheadquarters denied that any of the members of the Ku Klux Klan were\r\nconnected with them, the Klansmen in my field paid but little attention to\r\nthese outrages. In fact, I, myself, did not believe that the organization\r\ncould be guilty of committing such open and flagrant outrages, until I had\r\na conversation with the King Kleagle some time around June 1, 1921. I had\r\nmet him at Knoxville for the purpose of urging that the charters for three\r\ntowns be immediately granted. He began talking about the work of the other\r\nKlans, and stated that in Houston, Texas, a young negro, charged with\r\nfamiliarity with white women, had been taken out into the country and\r\nmutilated. The King Kleagle said that this was done by the Houston Klan,\r\nwhich ran things its own way, as it had the mayor, the police force and\r\npractically all of the politicians.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of May and the early part of June, 1921, while following\r\na busy routine, I began studying the Ku Klux movement and going carefully\r\ninto every detail that suggested itself. I had already become suspicious\r\nof the movement as a result of the apparent \"one man power\" of Simmons as\r\nexemplified in his scheme of employment of Kleagles; the questions that\r\nhad been asked me had started a second line of investigation; and then a\r\nthird cause of dissatisfaction arose from a feeling of disgust at the way\r\nin which the work was propagated. I jumped at no hasty conclusions in the\r\nmatter, but a gradual feeling of revolt against the movement developed in\r\nmy mind, which feeling I communicated to a few friends. I also asked\r\nseveral members of the organization, with whom I was intimately\r\nacquainted, what they thought of the organization, and I found that my own\r\ndoubts and fears were shared by them. The leader of the Kingsport Klan was\r\nan out-and-out skeptic on the whole movement. Then again, from inquiries I\r\nhad made as to the work in near-by towns outside my territory, I learned\r\nthat Kleagles were selling memberships as they would sell insurance or\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was supposed to canvass for members, I made it a rule, during\r\nmy period of service as Kleagle, to do no soliciting whatever. My system\r\nwas to establish a membership committee in each community in my territory\r\nand permit the committees to select their own material. This policy made\r\nthe personnel in my territory very high, as each individual was elected to\r\nmembership before he was invited to join the organization.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its field force, the propagation department of the Ku Klux\r\nKlan, I learned, uses motion pictures and paid lecturers to spread the\r\ngerms of Ku Kluxism. There is a picture entitled, \"The Face at Your\r\nWindow\" that is being used extensively as an aid to the canvassing\r\nKleagles. The film company arranges with the local Kleagle to have this\r\npicture exhibited on a certain day, and each Klansman is requested to\r\nbring a friend with him to see it. At the close of the performance the\r\nKlansman hands his friend an application blank and through the\r\npsychological effect of the picture usually gets the other to join. The\r\nsystem of using lecturers seems to help considerably to swell the Ku Klux\r\nroster.\r\n\r\nStill another method of winning members was by newspaper advertising. The\r\nExalted Cyclops, the head, of the Knoxville Klan showed me the copy for a\r\nfull page advertisement that his Klan intended inserting in the Knoxville\r\npapers to secure the five hundred membership necessary before their Klan\r\ncould procure a charter. I saw that such wholesale solicitation of\r\nmembers could have but one result--inevitably the control of this secret\r\norganization would pass into hands least competent to exercise it.\r\n\r\nAs I became more familiar with the movement, as it was being propagated\r\nelsewhere, and from my own study and observation, I reached some definite\r\nconclusions. From the first, I had observed carefully the classes of men\r\nwho were being enrolled, the motives for their enlisting, and the effect\r\nthe organization had upon them. The result as a whole had been disturbing,\r\nbut it was from my study of the organization itself that I finally turned\r\nin revulsion from it. It was not easy to get the real facts. I asked many\r\nquestions, both in writing and orally, of the King Kleagle, some of which\r\nhe could answer, but most of them he could not. The Constitution of the\r\norganization I could not get. The King Kleagle had no copy and had never\r\nseen a copy. It was not until a short time before my withdrawal that I was\r\nshown the constitution and the reading of the document confirmed all too\r\nwell the suspicions I had already formed about the menace that lay in Ku\r\nKluxism. That it was a political money-making scheme rather than a\r\nfraternal order, I began to comprehend from the sales-methods I saw around\r\nme. It also seemed to me that there were certain potential dangers\r\ninherent in it. When I had once asked the King Kleagle how a Klan should\r\nfunction when once it was organized, \"Tell them,\" he had answered, \"to\r\nclean up their towns.\" That \"cleaning up a town\" by illegal means could\r\nend only in mob rule was clear enough to any thinking man, and the fact\r\nthat the newspapers had been reporting outrages in various Southern\r\nStates--outrages committed by masked men--did not make me feel any more\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nOppressed therefore by its potential dangers, disgusted with a ritualistic\r\nwork which really seemed to me a sacrilege, and revolted by the spirit of\r\nreligious and racial hatred which it inculcated, I decided to resign my\r\nwork as Kleagle, and accordingly mailed my resignation to the King Kleagle\r\non June 15, 1921.\r\n\r\nMy resignation as Kleagle was reluctantly accepted by J. M. McArthur, the\r\nKing Kleagle, who wrote me to that effect and asked me to meet him in\r\nChattanooga for the purpose of securing my final release, which was given\r\nme the latter part of June, 1921. While my name was never mentioned, the\r\nexposure of the Klan which was made by the _World_ brought forth the\r\nstatement from the Atlanta headquarters that \"the individual responsible\r\nfor the attack had been discharged from the propagation department for\r\nconduct and character unbecoming a gentleman.\" As a matter of fact, I have\r\nin my possession a letter from McArthur expressing \"genuine regret\" at my\r\nresignation, warmly commending me for \"excellent work,\" and granting me\r\n\"an honorable discharge from the propagation department of the Knights of\r\nthe Ku Klux Klan.\" Fortunately for the cause of decent Americanism, King\r\nKleagle McArthur is one of these \"ready letter-writers,\" and the letters\r\nwritten by him to me have all been filed away. Some of them were valuable\r\npieces of documentary evidence to sustain the case made against the Klan\r\nby the _World_.\r\n\r\nI was invited by McArthur to attend two meetings of the Klan in\r\nChattanooga, where I found the movement strongly organized. At one of\r\nthese meetings the leader of the local Klan, a physician, made one of the\r\nmost incendiary speeches I have ever heard, a speech that was vociferously\r\napplauded by a large gathering of Klansmen. He made a violent attack on\r\nJews, Negroes and Catholics, and stated that: \"the Knights of Columbus\r\nhave 2,000 rifles stored in the Catholic church; they will before long\r\nmarch down Market Street armed with their rifles; and the Ku Klux Klan\r\nmust organize and arm itself for the purpose of protecting the city from\r\nthe designs of this murderous organization.\"\r\n\r\nHaving resigned from the propagation department, I then withdrew from\r\n\"citizenship\" in the \"Invisible Empire,\" and denounced it in the _World_\r\nand its associated newspapers. Although my letter was registered and\r\nmailed to _William J. Simmons_ personally, I never received any reply. The\r\nletter read as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"You are hereby notified that I have this day voluntarily withdrawn\r\n     as a 'citizen' of the 'Invisible Empire,' Knights of the Ku Klux\r\n     Klan, Inc., and shall no longer consider myself in any way connected\r\n     with the organization. After five months of 'citizenship' in the\r\n     'Invisible Empire,' three months of which were spent as a Kleagle, I\r\n     have reached the conclusion that your proposition is a historical\r\n     fraud; that it is a money-making scheme run for the benefit of a few\r\n     insiders; that it is engaged in an evil propaganda in promoting\r\n     unwarranted religious and racial hatred against Jews, Roman\r\n     Catholics, negroes, and foreign-born American citizens; that your\r\n     entire scheme is a dangerous public menace that will inevitably lead\r\n     to bloodshed and if successful must result in revolution; and that,\r\n     in the interests of decent Americanism, it should be suppressed by\r\n     the Federal and State authorities.\r\n\r\n     \"I further notify you that I utterly repudiate and refuse to be bound\r\n     in any way by any and all portions of the 'oath of allegiance' to the\r\n     'Invisible Empire' formerly taken by me, excepting that portion\r\n     pledging allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and of\r\n     my State, with which portion you have camouflaged the real purport\r\n     and meaning of the oath. The remainder of the oath conflicts with a\r\n     higher obligation I have previously assumed as an officer of the\r\n     Reserve Corps of the United States Army. I therefore denounce said\r\n     remaining portions of said oath as illegal, and detrimental to the\r\n     fundamental principles which underlie the entire legal structure of\r\n     this country. I further decline, any longer, to keep secret any part\r\n     or parts of your scheme to establish in free America an 'Invisible\r\n     Empire' fraudulent in its conception, vicious in its nature,\r\n     political in its objects, and subject to the will of a\r\n     self-constituted 'Emperor' who seeks to exploit the American people\r\n     for his own personal aggrandizement.\r\n\r\n     \"In defiance of your threats of 'dishonor, disgrace, and death' as\r\n     contained in your ritual--written and copyrighted by yourself--I\r\n     denounce your ritualistic work as an insult to all Christian people\r\n     in America, as an attempt to hypocritically obtain money from the\r\n     public under the cloak of sanctimonious piety; and, I charge that the\r\n     principal feature of your ceremony of 'naturalization' into the\r\n     'Invisible Empire' is a blasphemous and sacrilegious mockery of the\r\n     holy rite of baptism, wherein for political and financial purposes,\r\n     you have polluted with your infamous parody those things that\r\n     Christians, regardless of creed or dogma, hold most sacred.\r\n\r\n     \"I further charge that when in your printed literature you claim that\r\n     your organization is the 'genuine original Klan,' this statement is a\r\n     fraud historically and a fraud in principle. While you have--without\r\n     any right whatever--appropriated to yourself the name, regalia, and\r\n     certain nomenclature of the original Klan, your scheme is radically\r\n     different in conception, in organization, and in purpose. A careful\r\n     study, which I have made, of the Prescript of the original Klan and\r\n     all available history and literature on the subject, reveals the fact\r\n     that there is little, if anything, in common between the two\r\n     organizations. Your false pretenses of 'genuineness' are therefore\r\n     insults to the history, the traditions, and the entire record of the\r\n     South.\r\n\r\n     \"Ever since your scheme has been actively propagated, there has been\r\n     a wave of crime in the Southern States, consisting to a large extent\r\n     of 'private regulations' of the public peace, committed by men who\r\n     have gone about their respective communities wearing disguises and\r\n     taking into their own hands the functions of prosecuting attorney,\r\n     witnesses, judge, jury and executioner, in direct contravention to\r\n     the Bill of Rights of the Federal and State constitutions. Men have\r\n     been dragged from their beds at night, forcibly abducted on the\r\n     streets and in their homes, arrested without warrant on the public\r\n     streets, conveyed to secluded places, there to be flogged, tarred and\r\n     feathered. In two instances helpless women, after being stripped of\r\n     their clothing, have been similarly maltreated. In nearly every\r\n     reported case, the perpetrators of these acts of lawlessness have\r\n     worn disguises, described as 'masks and white robes,' which\r\n     description correspond convincingly with the official regalia of the\r\n     'Invisible Empire.' In three specific cases, acts of lawlessness have\r\n     been so openly and flagrantly committed by members of the 'Ku Klux\r\n     Klan,' that you have been compelled to take official cognizance. In\r\n     these three instances where responsibility has been fixed, it was\r\n     very evident that the illegal oath and the secret teachings of your\r\n     'Invisible Empire' were construed by your dupes as granting a license\r\n     to engage in secret regulation of the peace by means of anonymous\r\n     warnings, threats, intimidations, abduction, the whip, and the use of\r\n     tar and feathers. Having studied your scheme, both from the inside\r\n     and the outside, I have no doubt whatever that practically all of\r\n     these reported outrages were committed by members of your\r\n     organization. If it were proven, however, that your 'citizens' were\r\n     not _prima facie_ responsible, at the same time there exists a moral\r\n     responsibility, because when one group of people is permitted to go\r\n     about in disguise, it places the community at the mercy of any group\r\n     which cares to adopt similar tactics.\r\n\r\n     \"Everywhere the promoters of your scheme have gone, they have sought\r\n     to enlist as 'citizens' the white, Gentile, Protestant public\r\n     officials, especially those having in charge the enforcement of the\r\n     law. No matter how capable, how efficient, and how conscientious a\r\n     public official may be, if he chances to be a Jew or a Catholic, you\r\n     not only do not want him, but your organization is now planning\r\n     actively to cause all the Jews, Catholics, and foreign-born\r\n     naturalized Americans in this country to be removed from public life.\r\n     Aside from vicious politics, and in view of the fact that your oath\r\n     is an accessory before the fact to mob violence, this tampering and\r\n     meddling with the law-enforcing machinery of the country--under the\r\n     alleged plea of 'law and order'--is a direct blow at the entire legal\r\n     machinery of the United States, a condition that, in its nature,\r\n     approaches anarchy.\r\n\r\n     \"At a time when peaceful relations are existing between the white and\r\n     black races, you are disrupting the industrial conditions of the\r\n     South, by your anti-negro propaganda and causing a state of unrest\r\n     that can result only in dangerous and mischievous consequences. In\r\n     your anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish propaganda, your organization is\r\n     scattering broadcast over this country wicked, malicious, and\r\n     inflammatory lies about American citizens of those religious beliefs,\r\n     lies that brand your movement as being far more vicious than the\r\n     insidious German propaganda in this country prior to our entrance\r\n     into the recent war. You are publishing, for example, the statement\r\n     that the Jews are seeking to promote a race war between white people\r\n     and negroes, and the intimation that the Catholic Church was\r\n     responsible for the murder of President Abraham Lincoln. In public\r\n     statements, you and your paid speakers give expression to wordy,\r\n     sanctimonious and high-sounding platitudes, while secretly your\r\n     propagandists, in a sneaking and contemptible manner, are spreading\r\n     poisonous and vicious lies they dare not give voice to in public.\r\n\r\n     \"Your 'Invisible Empire' is furthermore a money-making scheme! You,\r\n     yourself, an individual of little, if any, means prior to your\r\n     becoming an 'Emperor' have so far received from 'friends' a $25,000\r\n     residence completely furnished! Your connection with the organization\r\n     is either bringing you large sums of money at present, or the promise\r\n     of the same in the future! You are allowed to appropriate to your own\r\n     use all of the ten dollars \"donated\" by any person whose application\r\n     you personally solicit! All of the rituals and other printed\r\n     publications of your organization are copyrighted in your name, and\r\n     it is presumable that you have either received royalties for their\r\n     use or a cash consideration for their sale! Your organization has\r\n     recently bought Lanier University, of which you have been made the\r\n     head, and college presidents are usually paid salaries! While orders\r\n     for robes at $6.50 are taken in your name, they are filled by the\r\n     Gate City Manufacturing Company, at a substantial profit, and the\r\n     public has not been informed as to the disposition of this huge\r\n     amount of funds! The Searchlight Publishing Company, headed by your\r\n     Imperial Kleagle is no doubt a big revenue producer! Your Imperial\r\n     Kleagle is also the head of the Clarke Realty Company, in whose\r\n     operations, I have no doubt you are also interested! These varied\r\n     financial operations indicate to me that spreading religious and\r\n     racial hatred is a lucrative business for you and your associates.\r\n\r\n     \"Your whole 'Invisible Empire' is a cancer in the body politic! It is\r\n     like some foul and loathsome thing that grows and flourishes in the\r\n     dark, away from the sight of honest men and women. It was conceived\r\n     in avarice, sired in ignorance, and dammed in greed. It is now being\r\n     nurtured in cunning and false pretense, and fed upon an unholy lust\r\n     for gold, by means of passion, hatred, and the prejudice of religious\r\n     and racial fanaticism. And, day by day, with your oily assurance, you\r\n     say that these devilish devices of discord are being developed in the\r\n     name of 'pure Americanism'! If this is your idea of America, you\r\n     haven't the slightest conception of what pure Americanism means!\r\n\r\n     \"There is no place in America for an 'Invisible Empire' of hate and\r\n     venom; and there is no provision in the laws of this country for an\r\n     'Emperor'! The 'Invisible Empire' should be made visible! It should\r\n     be held up to the light so that honest men can see its ugly structure\r\n     and analyze its nefarious potentialities, and then, having seen this\r\n     monstrosity, the people should demand of their legally constituted\r\n     forces of government that Ku Kluxism and the Ku Klux Klan be outlawed\r\n     and barred forever from operating in this free Republic.\r\n\r\n          Yours truly,\r\n              HENRY P. FRY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE \"INVISIBLE EMPIRE?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA study of the physical structure of the \"Invisible Empire\" necessarily\r\nstarts with its corporate organization, its officers, its general method\r\nof functioning, and its ramifications throughout the United States.\r\nAlthough organized under the pretense that it is a \"fraternal order,\" a\r\nclose investigation of the system reveals the fact that its activities\r\nextend in several directions. Its three principal promoters, William J.\r\nSimmons, Edward Young Clarke and Mrs. M. E. Tyler, are engaged in several\r\nlines of business all of which are closely related. The show under the\r\nmain tent is the \"Invisible Empire,\" Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.,\r\nallied to which either directly or indirectly is the \"Gate City\r\nManufacturing Company,\" a corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nState of Georgia for the manufacture of lodge regalia, etc., the\r\nSearchlight Publishing Company, which prints a weekly paper which is\r\nrecognized by the public as the official organ of Ku Kluxism, and Lanier\r\nUniversity, which was acquired in August, 1921, and of which William J.\r\nSimmons is the president. There is also the Clarke Realty Company in which\r\nE. Y. Clarke and Mrs. M. E. Tyler are mentioned as incorporators, the\r\noperations of which corporation are not known.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan granted by the Superior\r\nCourt of Fulton County, Georgia, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"GEORGIA, FULTON COUNTY.\r\n\r\n     TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SAID COUNTY:\r\n\r\n     The petition of W. J. SIMMONS, H. D. SHACKLEFORD, E. R. CLARKSON, J.\r\n     B. FROST, W. L. SMITH, R. C. W. RAMSPECK, G. D. COUCH, L. M. JOHNSON,\r\n     A. G. DALLAS, W. E. FLODING, W. C. BENNETT, J. F. V. SAUL, all of\r\n     said State and County, respectfully shows:\r\n\r\n     1. That they desire for themselves, their associates and successors\r\n     to be incorporated in the State of Georgia for the period of twenty\r\n     years, with the right of renewal; when and as provided by law, as a\r\n     _patriotic, secret, social, benevolent order_ under the name and\r\n     style of\r\n\r\n     'KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN'\r\n\r\n     2. The purpose and object of said corporation is to be purely\r\n     benevolent and eleesmosynary, and there shall be no capital stock or\r\n     profit or gain to the members thereof.\r\n\r\n     3. The principal office and place of business shall be in Fulton\r\n     County, Georgia, but petitioners desire that the corporation shall\r\n     have the power to issue decrees, edicts and certificates of\r\n     organization to subordinate branches of the corporation in this or\r\n     other States of the United States and elsewhere, whenever the same\r\n     shall be deemed desirable in the conduct of its business.\r\n\r\n     4. The petitioners desire that the Society shall have the power to\r\n     confer an initiative degree ritualism, fraternal and secret\r\n     obligations, words, grip signs and ceremonies under which there shall\r\n     be united only white male persons of sound health, good morals and\r\n     high character; and further desire such rights, powers and privileges\r\n     as are now extended to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Free and\r\n     Accepted Masons, Knights of Pythias, _et al._, under and by virtue\r\n     of the laws of the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\n     5. Petitioners desire that there shall be a Supreme Legislative Body\r\n     in which shall be vested the power to adopt and amend constitutions\r\n     and by-laws for the regulation of the general purpose and welfare of\r\n     the order, and of the subordinate branches of same.\r\n\r\n     6. Petitioners desire that the 'IMPERIAL KLONVOKATION' (Supreme\r\n     Legislative Body) shall be composed of the SUPREME OFFICERS AND\r\n     'KLOPPERS' (DELEGATES) selected by the 'KLORO' (STATE CONVENTION) of\r\n     the SEVERAL 'REALMS' (subordinate jurisdiction); and of such other\r\n     persons as the constitution and by-laws of the Society may provide.\r\n\r\n     7. Petitioners desire that the business of the Society shall be under\r\n     the control of the 'IMPERIAL WIZARD' (PRESIDENT), who shall be\r\n     amenable in his official administration to the 'IMPERIAL KLONCILIUM'\r\n     (Supreme Executive Committee), a majority of whom shall have\r\n     authority to act, and a two-thirds' majority power to veto the\r\n     official acts of the 'IMPERIAL WIZARD' (PRESIDENT) in the matters\r\n     pertaining to the general welfare of the Society; and to contract\r\n     with other members of the Society for the purpose of promoting and\r\n     conducting its interests and general welfare, in any way, manner, or\r\n     method he may deem proper for the Society's progress and stability,\r\n     subject to the restrictions of the power of the 'IMPERIAL WIZARD'\r\n     (PRESIDENT) as is heretofore set forth in this paragraph.\r\n\r\n     8. Petitioners desire that they shall have the right to adopt a\r\n     constitution and by-laws and elect the first KLONCILIUM (Supreme\r\n     Executive Committee), which shall possess all the powers of the\r\n     'IMPERIAL KLONVOKATION' (Supreme Legislative Body) until the first\r\n     organization and meeting of that body, and shall fix the number,\r\n     title and terms of officers composing said 'KLONCILIUM' (Supreme\r\n     Legislative Committee).\r\n\r\n     9. Petitioners desire the right to own separate unto itself and to\r\n     control the sale of all paraphernalia, regalia, stationery, jewelry\r\n     and such other materials needed by the subordinate branches of the\r\n     order for the proper conduct of their business; the right to publish\r\n     a fraternal magazine and such other literature as is needed in the\r\n     conduct of the business of the order; the right to buy, hold and sell\r\n     real estate and personal property suitable to the purpose of the said\r\n     corporation; to sell, exchange or sublease the same or any part\r\n     thereof; to mortgage or create liens thereon; to borrow money and\r\n     secure the payment thereof by mortgage or deed of trust and to\r\n     appoint trustees in connection therewith; to execute promissory\r\n     notes, to have and to use a common seal; to sue and be sued; to plead\r\n     and be impleaded; to do and perform all these things and exercise all\r\n     those rights, which under the laws of Georgia, are conferred upon\r\n     societies or orders of like character.\r\n\r\n     10. _Wherefore_ petitioners pray an order incorporating them, their\r\n     associates and successors under the name and style aforesaid with all\r\n     the powers and privileges necessary to the extension of the order or\r\n     the conduct of the business and purposes of like nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe casual examination of the above instrument fails to show anything more\r\nsignificant than the fact that it is a simple application for a charter\r\nfor an ordinary fraternal organization, several of whom, including the\r\nMasonic fraternity and the Knights of Pythias, it specifically names. An\r\nanalysis, however, of the instrument reveals some interesting things, and\r\nraises some questions that may be of service to the public in dealing with\r\nKu Kluxism.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this charter, which was granted July 1, 1916, confers\r\nupon W. J. Simmons and certain associates the right to engage in the\r\nbusiness of a fraternal society under the name and style of \"KNIGHTS OF\r\nTHE KU KLUX KLAN.\" As a matter of fact the propagation of the movement\r\ngoes forward under the name and title of \"Invisible Empire, Knights of the\r\nKu Klux Klan, Inc.\" The use of the words \"Invisible Empire\" in connection\r\nwith the authorized and legal title of the organization is an _ultra\r\nvires_ act without the sanction of the Georgia law under which the society\r\nis operating.\r\n\r\nThe following copy of the application for charter membership illustrates\r\nthis point:\r\n\r\n     \"TO HIS MAJESTY, THE IMPERIAL WIZARD, EMPEROR OF THE INVISIBLE\r\n     EMPIRE, KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN (INC.):\r\n\r\n     I, the undersigned, a native-born, true and loyal citizen of the\r\n     United States of America, being a white Gentile person of temperate\r\n     habits, sound in mind, and a believer in the tenets of the Christian\r\n     religion, the maintenance of _white supremacy_, the practice of an\r\n     honorable clanishness and the principles of \"pure Americanism,\" do\r\n     voluntarily most respectfully, seriously and unselfishly petition you\r\n     for _citizenship_ in the INVISIBLE EMPIRE, KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX\r\n     KLAN, and be a _charter member_ of a Klan located at\r\n     .................. State of ..........\r\n\r\n     I guarantee on my honor to conform strictly to all rules and\r\n     requirements regulating my \"naturalization\" and the continuance of my\r\n     membership, and at all times a strict and loyal obedience to your\r\n     constitutional authority and the constitution and laws, and all\r\n     regulations and usages of the fraternity. The required \"donation\"\r\n     accompanies this petition.\r\n\r\n        Signed: ....................................., _Petitioner_.\r\n     Date .................. 192....\r\n           Residence Address ............................................\r\n           Business Address  ............................................\r\n\r\n     Endorsers will sign on other side.\r\n\r\n     _Notice_: Check the address to which mail may be sent.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the standard form for application for \"citizenship\" and several\r\nhundred such applications, properly signed, have come under my personal\r\nobservation. It is distinctly a request to be \"naturalized\" as a \"citizen\"\r\nof the \"Invisible Empire,\" Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and not an\r\napplication for membership in an order known as the \"Knights of the Ku\r\nKlux Klan\" by itself.\r\n\r\nIt appears from an examination of the records, that the Knights of the Ku\r\nKlux Klan made but little headway for several years, when it was under the\r\nsole management of William J. Simmons. An examination of the Atlanta City\r\nDirectory reveals the fact that the present \"Emperor\" was engaged in other\r\nlines of activity, largely as a professional organizer. In 1915 he appears\r\nlisted as \"Organizer of the Woodmen of the World\"; in 1916, \"Imperial\r\nWizard and founder of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\"; in 1918, the next\r\nyear a directory was issued, as \"State Manager, Heralds of Liberty\"; in\r\n1920, as \"Lecturer\"; and in 1921, again as \"Imperial Wizard, Knights of\r\nthe Ku Klux Klan.\" It was not, apparently, until he joined forces with\r\nEdward Young Clarke, that the enterprise was placed on a paying basis.\r\nClarke, it is said, has had wide experience as a professional\r\npropagandist, and prior to his taking charge of the Ku Klux movement was\r\nemployed to raise money for the Anti-Saloon League and the Salvation Army,\r\nconducting drives for those bodies. The city directory of Atlanta lists\r\nhim as follows: 1915, \"Secretary, Brooks County Industrial Club\"; 1916,\r\nSecretary, \"Georgia Chamber of Commerce\"; 1918, \"Secretary, Southeastern\r\nExhibit Association\"; 1920-21, \"President Southern Publicity Association.\"\r\nUnder the direction of Clarke the entire system of field work has been\r\nperfected, and as Imperial Kleagle, Clarke is responsible for the success\r\nof the movement.\r\n\r\nClarke, whose chief helper and backer was Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler, was\r\nconducting the Southern Publicity Bureau at the time, and quickly saw the\r\nbig financial possibilities which lay in the capitalization of the name\r\n\"Ku Klux.\" Simmons, who had concocted the scheme of organization which\r\nplaced the \"entire works\" into his own hands, lacked the ability to put\r\nhis ideas into execution. At this point, I should like to take issue with\r\npractically every man who had made any attack on the Ku Klux Klan. The\r\ngeneral opinion has been that \"Simmons is absolutely sincere in what he is\r\ndoing, but has been in the hands of Clarke and Mrs. Tyler.\" I have never\r\nmet Simmons in person, but I have studied his organization in the most\r\nminute detail. From my study of the system and the part the man has played\r\nin it, I believe that he is a cunning, shrewd adventurer, who, from the\r\nstart conceived the idea of acquiring both wealth and unlimited power from\r\nhis secret \"Invisible Empire.\" In all of his public utterances in the\r\nnewspapers and before Congress he has shown a shiftiness and evasiveness\r\nclearly discernible amid a vast mass of wordiness.\r\n\r\nIn his entire scheme of organization and management, he has so constructed\r\nhis proposition that he is master of the situation with practically\r\nunlimited power. In this particular a good illustration can be found in\r\nthe contract he made with Clarke whereby the latter became the Chief Sales\r\nManager of the membership peddlers for the whole country. This contract,\r\nwhile it gives Clarke the opportunity of making a vast sum of money, at\r\nthe same time makes Simmons the absolute dictator of Clarke's movements.\r\nThe probabilities are that Simmons, realizing that he himself was ignorant\r\nof real organization methods, so framed this contract that he could let\r\nClarke out at any time, and take over to himself the functions of the\r\npropagation department after he had learned the system.\r\n\r\nThe contract which brought Clarke and Mrs. Tyler into the organization\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"STATE OF GEORGIA, County of Fulton,\r\n\r\n     \"This agreement, made and entered into on this the seventh day of\r\n     June, A.D. 1920, by and between the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a\r\n     corporation of said county, acting by its Imperial Wizard\r\n     (President), W. J. Simmons, party of the first part, and Edward Young\r\n     Clarke, of said county, party of the second part.\r\n\r\n     \"Witnesseth, that the said party of the second part hereto having, by\r\n     virtue of this agreement, been appointed Imperial Kleagle (General\r\n     Superintendent of the organization department) of said first party,\r\n     and it being desirable that the details of his rights, privileges,\r\n     powers, duties, responsibilities, and compensation, etc., in addition\r\n     to that laid down in the constitution and laws of the said\r\n     corporation be definitely fixed:\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore, it is agreed by the said parties hereto that this\r\n     contract shall continue so long as it is mutually agreeable; that it\r\n     shall remain of force and may be canceled by either party hereto\r\n     without previous notice of any intention to do so.\r\n\r\n     \"It is agreed that said second party may employ, subject to the\r\n     approval and appointment of the said Imperial Wizard (President) of\r\n     the corporation aforesaid, and subject to the right and power of said\r\n     Imperial Wizard (President) to revoke all such appointments, such\r\n     assistant organizers as he (the said second party) may deem necessary\r\n     to properly carry out the plans for the propagation and extension of\r\n     said corporation; provided, that such persons so appointed or\r\n     employed be members of the said corporation in good and regular\r\n     standing prior to their appointment, and that they maintain their\r\n     good standing therein as an essential condition on which their\r\n     appointment is made.\r\n\r\n     \"It is agreed that in all things the second party shall be\r\n     subordinate to the said Imperial Wizard (President), and shall\r\n     attempt no plans or methods of work without the consent or approval\r\n     of the said Imperial Wizard.\r\n\r\n     \"It is agreed that the said second party shall receive as in full\r\n     compensation and expenses of himself and his duly appointed and\r\n     commissioned subordinate organizers the sum of $8.00 for each and\r\n     every new member brought into the said corporation by himself and his\r\n     assistant subordinate organizers, and in addition to the $8.00 he\r\n     shall receive $2.00 for each new member added to all Klans organized\r\n     by himself or his subordinate organizers within a period of six\r\n     months after the date of the charter of all such Klans organized by\r\n     himself and his subordinate organizers.\r\n\r\n     \"It is agreed that no expense or debts shall be made or incurred by\r\n     the said Edward Young Clarke or his subordinate organizers, and no\r\n     obligation entered into with any firm, company, corporation, or\r\n     person for which the said first party hereto or the said Imperial\r\n     Wizard (President) shall be bound to make any outlay of or\r\n     expenditure of money, unless there be a specific approval of the\r\n     particular item or items of all such expenditures, prior to the\r\n     incurring of same by the said Imperial Wizard (President) of the said\r\n     corporation.\r\n\r\n     \"It is agreed that the said second party shall advance, from time to\r\n     time, as may be necessary the office rent and all other expenses\r\n     incident to the proper conduct and furnishing of the main office of\r\n     the aforesaid corporation, and in addition thereto a sum of not less\r\n     than $75 per week and traveling expenses of the said Imperial Wizard\r\n     (President) of the aforesaid corporation, reimbursing himself for\r\n     such expenditures out of the $2.00 due by him to the aforesaid\r\n     corporation on account of each member received into the aforesaid\r\n     corporation by him and his duly appointed and commissioned\r\n     subordinate organizers.\r\n\r\n     \"Duly executed in duplicate in the city of Atlanta, Ga., on the day\r\n     and date above written.\r\n\r\n          \"KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN, INC.\r\n              \"By W. J. SIMMONS, Imperial Wizard (President).\r\n              \"EDWARD YOUNG CLARKE.\"\r\n\r\nAs is well known the new Ku Klux Klan, like the old, depends to a great\r\nextent upon concealing the identity of the members by the means of long\r\nwhite robes and a white peaked helmet, with hangings in which eye holes\r\nhave been cut. In the old Klan these robes were made by members of the\r\nKlansmen's family, but in the new order of affairs the work of supplying\r\nthese robes is a monopoly entirely in the hands of the national\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nMembers are not actually required to possess a robe, but it is generally\r\nthe case that every man who comes into the movement is childishly eager to\r\nacquire one, whether he can use it in public or not. The organization does\r\nnot \"sell\" the robes to members; it merely rents them, and members upon\r\nleaving the organization are required to return them to the head of the\r\nlocal Klan. The price charged a member for a robe is $6.50, while the\r\nKleagle must pay $12 as his robe has more trimming. Made in large\r\nquantities, as they are being made, there ought to be a profit of at least\r\n$5 per garment, although I believe a New York garment maker could show a\r\nlarger profit than that. According to \"Emperor\" Simmons, the present\r\noutput is about six hundred robes a day. Orders are taken for the garments\r\nby Kleagles and Exalted Cyclops of the different Klans on measuring blanks\r\nprinted especially for the purpose. The order is made out and addressed to\r\nthe \"Imperial Wizard,\" but it is filled by the \"Gate City Manufacturing\r\nCompany\" of Atlanta, Georgia. The records of Fulton County, Georgia, show\r\nthat application for charter for this corporation was filed June 9, 1920,\r\nwith C. B. Davis and Lottie B. Davis as incorporators. It shows a capital\r\nstock of $25,000, and states that \"more than $5,000 has been paid in.\" It\r\nalso asks the right to increase its capitalization to $50,000. Its powers\r\nindicate that it is to engage in the manufacture and sale of lodge\r\nsupplies, paraphernalia and equipment of all sorts for the use of lodges,\r\nsecret societies, etc. The corporation apparently lay dormant for a year,\r\nas an order of court allowing the petition was only allowed on August 19,\r\n1921. Until the incorporators met and organized there could have been no\r\nlegal organization of the corporation. No reports as to business done had\r\nbeen filed in Fulton County up to the date of the court order above\r\nmentioned. This concern, however, has been doing business for several\r\nmonths prior to that time, as I received several shipments from them in\r\nApril and May 1921. _Who owns the Gate City Manufacturing Company? What\r\nconnection has it with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan? What becomes of\r\nthe enormous profit derived from the sales of robes?_\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1921, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan purchased the\r\nhandsome, colonial home of H. M. Durant on Peachtree Road, about five\r\nmiles from Atlanta, at an approximate cost of $75,000. The purchase\r\ncomprises a block of land about four hundred feet square. Extensive\r\nimprovements, worthy of a real emperor's palace are contemplated for this\r\nproperty, and it will be the headquarters of the \"Imperial Palace.\" The\r\nland will be cut up into gardens, small lakes and building sites. It is\r\nestimated that $30,000 worth of marble alone will be used. A handsome\r\nstatue of General N. B. Forrest will be erected, and also a statue of\r\n\"Emperor\" William J. Simmons. There will be electric fountains, electric\r\nfiery crosses, lakes, boat houses and tennis courts. According to the\r\n\"Emperor\": \"There will be no manufacturing handled at the Palace. We now\r\nhave a paraphernalia plant here turning out six hundred robes a day, in\r\naddition to other equipment, and we expect to erect in a short time a\r\nbuilding with railroad frontage to be devoted exclusively to\r\nmanufacturing.\" It is also planned to take over a large printing plant. If\r\nthis extensive program is carried out, there will be a huge enterprise\r\nwith all the combined activities costing not less than $3,500,000.\r\n\r\nWhile the organization has been buying land and engaging in real estate\r\ntransactions, the Imperial Kleagle, as a side line, has also gone into the\r\nreal estate business. On June 27, 1921, a petition was filed for charter\r\nfor the \"Clarke Realty Company\" with Edward Young Clarke and Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Tyler as incorporators, with authorized capital stock of $10,000\r\nwith privilege of increasing it to $100,000. The corporation seeks the\r\nright to deal generally in real estate. Just what real estate the \"Clarke\r\nRealty Company\" has bought, sold, leased, rented, or exchanged or acted as\r\nbrokers for, has not appeared in print.\r\n\r\nThe functions of Clarke appear to be exclusively to propagate the work and\r\norganize Klans, after which they are turned over to Simmons. According to\r\na statement made by Clarke to the _World_ the organization has one\r\nthousand chartered Klans, it requiring the services of two people engaged\r\nevery day to write charters. After the Klans are chartered they are turned\r\nover to Simmons. In this connection, it would be well to turn back to the\r\ncharter and note that under Section 7, the \"business of the society shall\r\nbe under the control of the IMPERIAL WIZARD (PRESIDENT),\" etc. This\r\ncontrol is so thorough that in the secret constitution of the organization\r\nthe term of office of the president is for life, and he can be removed\r\nonly by the unanimous vote of his Imperial Kloncilium. The constitution\r\nalso provides as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Article I, Section 2. The government of this order shall ever be\r\n     military in character, most especially its management and control;\r\n     and no legislative enactment or constitutional amendment hereafter\r\n     forever shall encroach upon, effect or change this essential,\r\n     fundamental principle of this order--The Invisible Empire.\r\n\r\n     \"Section 2. The government of this order shall be invested primarily\r\n     in the Imperial Wizard, as Commander-in-chief or Emperor of the\r\n     Invisible Empire.\"\r\n\r\nActing in pursuance of the constitution, which provides that the\r\norganization is \"military in character,\" the propagation department\r\nfunctions in pretty much the same manner as the army handles its business.\r\nThe Imperial Kleagle is virtually a Chief of Staff, or more properly an\r\nAdjutant General. The country is divided into eight \"Domains\" comprising\r\ncertain States, each State being known as a \"Realm,\" which is again\r\ndivided into districts where the actual field work is done.\r\n\r\nThe \"Domain\" is in command of a \"Grand Goblin,\" the \"Realm\" is under the\r\njurisdiction of a \"King Kleagle,\" while the field organizer, having charge\r\nof certain territory, is known as a \"Kleagle.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Domains with their respective Grand\r\nGoblins, revised to July 2, 1921:\r\n\r\n1. Domain of the Southeast, composed of Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi and the two Carolinas, with M. B. Owen, Box 1472,\r\nAtlanta, as Grand Goblin.\r\n\r\n2. Western Domain, in charge of Grand Goblin George B. Kimbro, Jr., Box\r\n1521, Houston, Texas, and composed of Arizona, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma,\r\nLouisiana, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Montana.\r\n\r\n3. Domain of the East, Grand Goblin Lloyd P. Hooper, Apartment 1, No. 320,\r\nCentral Park West, New York City, in charge, composed of the State of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n4. Domain of the Great Lakes, in charge of Grand Goblin C. W. Love, with\r\nheadquarters in Chicago, and composed of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nKentucky, Ohio, Minnesota and Michigan.\r\n\r\n5. Domain of the Mississippi Valley, in charge of Grand Goblin Frank A.\r\nCrippen, Box 951, St. Louis, composed of Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas,\r\nIowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota.\r\n\r\n6. Domain of the Pacific Coast, in charge of Grand Goblin W. S. Coburn,\r\nNo. 519 Haas Building, Los Angeles, composed of California, Washington,\r\nNevada, Oregon and Idaho.\r\n\r\n7. Domain of the Northwest, consolidated with former Southwestern Domain\r\nand now part of new Western Domain.\r\n\r\n8. Capitol Domain, in charge of Grand Goblin Harry B. Terrell, Box 5, 11th\r\nStreet Station, Washington, D. C., and comprising the District of\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\n9. Atlantic Domain, in charge of Grand Goblin F. W. Atkins, with\r\nheadquarters in Philadelphia, composed of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\r\nDelaware and Maryland.\r\n\r\n10. New England Domain, in charge of Grand Goblin A. J. Pardon, Jr., with\r\nheadquarters in Boston, and composed of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nUnattached, Florida, to be in charge of King Kleagle S. A. Givens, who\r\nwill report direct to the Imperial Kleagle and whose address is Box 1883,\r\nJacksonville, Fla.\r\n\r\nThese \"Domains\" may be likened to divisions of an army, as they are in\r\ncontrol of the spread of Ku Kluxism in the sections named, and the \"Grand\r\nGoblin\" reports direct to the \"Imperial Kleagle.\" Each State or \"Realm\" is\r\nlike a regiment, and the King Kleagle reports to his immediate chief, the\r\n\"Grand Goblin,\" and not to the Atlanta headquarters. The \"Kleagle\" or\r\nfield man makes his reports to the \"King Kleagle\" only. All communications\r\nsent to or received by him from the headquarters come through the channels\r\nof the \"King Kleagle.\" The system is so thoroughly military that if a\r\nmember of the organization writes to Atlanta about any matter, the letter\r\nis sent through channels to the Kleagle for his action.\r\n\r\nThe Kleagle is empowered to administer the obligation, organize and\r\ninstruct Klans, and collect the requisite and necessary \"donation\" of ten\r\ndollars. Out of this sum he retains four dollars per member for his\r\nservices, and at the end of the week submits a report of his activities,\r\nremitting to the King Kleagle the six dollars balance due on each member\r\nsecured. The King Kleagle retains one dollar a member for his services,\r\nand remits five dollars to the Grand Goblin of the Domain to which he is\r\nattached. The Grand Goblin is allowed to shave off fifty cents a member\r\nand remits $4.50 to the Imperial Kleagle, who in turn keeps $2.50 and pays\r\ninto the treasury of the Imperial Palace the sum of $2.00 which is all of\r\nthe original \"donation\" that actually reaches the organization. The whole\r\nsystem is carefully conducted as a well organized sales system, each\r\nofficial being required to file his returns each week on a form provided\r\nfor that purpose. The following is a copy of the Kleagle's weekly report\r\nform:\r\n\r\n     KLEAGLE'S WEEKLY REPORT\r\n\r\n     This report MUST be accurately made out and mailed to the Imperial\r\n     Kleagle on the last day of the week, approved by him and sent by him\r\n     to the Imperial Office at the earliest possible date.\r\n\r\n     To the Imperial Wizard, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan:\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: N.

Grade ................\r\n                   Imperial Kleagle.\r\n\r\nHas the \"Invisible Empire\" a program?\r\n\r\nAccording to its \"Emperor\" it not only has a program, but at the proper\r\ntime it will put it forth. He made a statement which was printed in the\r\n_Searchlight_ on July 2, 1921:\r\n\r\n     \"I am not at all surprised, at the progress of the work, but of\r\n     course gratified. I have never for one moment doubted that if God\r\n     gave me strength and 'men' with which to lay before America the\r\n     Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, that it would sweep the nation as\r\n     nothing of the kind has ever done.\r\n\r\n     \"The Ku Klux Klan has not started to work. The enemies of the\r\n     organization have been howling and back-biting and snapping at\r\n     everything they could see or hear, and lying slanders have been\r\n     spread broadcast about the organization and leaders and proposed work\r\n     and present activity.\r\n\r\n     \"For the edification of those who do not know allow me to say that\r\n     the Ku Klux Klan have not yet started to work and may not do so for a\r\n     year. We are merely organizing at the present time and we do not\r\n     intend to start any definite activity until we have sufficiently\r\n     organized to make sure success.\r\n\r\n     \"To those who love fireworks--rhetorical and otherwise--allow me to\r\n     suggest that they wait quietly until the Ku Klux Klan passes through\r\n     its organizing period and actually starts work. The attacks that have\r\n     so far been launched will appear significant when the atmosphere\r\n     becomes surcharged with the shrieks of the enemies of law and order,\r\n     constitutional principles, and real Americanism, as these forces feel\r\n     the tightening grip of the Klan around them and they come to the\r\n     realization that they are whipped.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be then, and not till then, that the real anathemas will be\r\n     hurled at the organization and its leaders, but it will have as\r\n     little weight and do as little harm as all the lies that have been\r\n     spread broadcast up to the present time.\r\n\r\n     \"And those who have deliberately maligned and slandered us are going\r\n     to wake some day to a very unpleasant situation. We are keeping\r\n     records and making plans. The day of our activity has not arrived.\"\r\n\r\nThis intemperate language of Simmons was even exceeded at a meeting held\r\non the night of August 25, 1921, in Philadelphia, which was reported in a\r\npress telegram as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"A narrow pathway leading to a woodland glade, and every fifty feet a\r\n     masked and white-robed sentinel. Within the little clearing an altar,\r\n     and beside it the banner of the nation with the night wind rustling\r\n     through the folds. Formed in hollow square around the glade rank on\r\n     rank of masked spectres. A deep voice echoing through the darkness.\r\n\r\n     \"'Imperial One, the men who seek admission to our legions stand\r\n     prepared!'\r\n\r\n     \"Line after line the candidates marched in, led by a gigantic masker\r\n     who bore high overhead the Fiery Cross. The candidates marched before\r\n     the scrutinizing ranks of silent Klansmen. Then every man--veteran\r\n     Klansmen and new-made members--bowed before the American flag and\r\n     through the night boomed out the watchword of the order:\r\n\r\n     \"'All men in America must honor that flag--if we must make them honor\r\n     it on their knees!'\r\n\r\n     \"Then, in a blaze of sudden light, the Grand Goblin of the Realm, a\r\n     towering form in white and scarlet uniform, appeared at the north end\r\n     of the glade. Cheers received him. His speech was brief.\r\n\r\n     \"'America for real Americans!' he cried. 'Guardianship against the\r\n     alien, the anarchist and all who would subvert that banner, be they\r\n     white, or black or yellow!' the voice thundered through the ranks.\r\n     'The Ku Klux are misrepresented and vilified. Americans do not\r\n     realize that they sleep on a red volcano's edge. They sleep; they let\r\n     petty politicians hold the helm; they make no preparations for the\r\n     perils yet to come. The enemies of true American principles are\r\n     myriad. They are organized; they plot; they scheme--they go\r\n     unchallenged and unhindered.\r\n\r\n     \"'It is the place of the Ku Klux Klan to rouse the spirit of the real\r\n     American and to stand guard against the evil forces that seek to\r\n     stifle this mightiest of nations. Be the foes white, black or yellow;\r\n     be they native traitors or alien invaders, the Klan shall form a ring\r\n     of steel to throttle their every devil's scheme. We, the Ku Klux\r\n     Klan; we, the Invisible Empire, rally to aid the faltering hands of\r\n     our law--and to protect our homes, our lives, our people and our\r\n     nation's future against a wave of living hell!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION NEWS-LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the various units in touch with each other, the\r\nPropagation Department sends out each week a \"News-letter\" filled with\r\nextracts from reports of different workers. These letters are supposed to\r\nbe read at the meetings of the Klans, and I found that they were listened\r\nto with great attention. It is quite likely that many hundreds of reports\r\nare received each week from all over the United States, and the fact that\r\nthe Propagation Department selects for distribution these special extracts\r\nmust indicate what the leaders wish Klansmen as a whole to believe about\r\nthe movement, and what should be the objects they are to work for. It is\r\nalso to be noted how well the letters reflect the extent to which the\r\nKlans have absorbed the moral and political poison of Ku Kluxism under the\r\nsugar coating of \"social purity,\" \"one hundred per cent Americanism,\"\r\n\"motherhood,\" and all the other _et ceteras_. This sugar coating is\r\nespecially evident in the following extract of June 18, 1921:\r\n\r\n     \"At eight o'clock one hundred Klansmen in robes marched down the main\r\n     street to the park. They carried banners, the first about the head of\r\n     the procession, bearing the inscription, 'The Invisible Empire, here\r\n     yesterday, here today, here forever.' The second banner about the\r\n     middle of the procession stated, 'Rockmart Must Be Clean for Our\r\n     Mothers, for Our Wives, for Our Daughters--The Guilty Must Pay.' Then\r\n     came the third and last banner reading, 'White Supremacy,' and on the\r\n     reverse side, 'Grafters, Gamblers and Thieves Must Go.' There were\r\n     about twelve hundred gathered around the speakers' stand and the old\r\n     citizens say it was about the biggest gathering ever held in\r\n     Rockmart.\r\n\r\n     \"The meeting was opened with singing 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee,' by\r\n     the entire gathering. This was followed by prayer led by Rev. F. J.\r\n     Mashburn. Then the Reverend Mashburn made the introductory speech, in\r\n     which he paid his respect to those who tried to dissuade him from\r\n     having anything to do with the meeting. Doctor Mashburn paid eloquent\r\n     tribute to the men in robes. He said that his father was one of the\r\n     members of the original Ku Klux Klan and that he felt he had been\r\n     singularly honored when requested to introduce the chief speaker of\r\n     the evening, Col. J. Q. Nolan of Atlanta. Colonel Nolan followed\r\n     Doctor Mashburn with an eloquent address, in which he clearly and\r\n     forcefully explained the aims and purposes of the order. His hold on\r\n     the audience was absolute and he was frequently interrupted with\r\n     applause. His tribute to motherhood was one of the sublimest word\r\n     paintings ever uttered. On the platform with the speakers were Hon.\r\n     J. A. Fambro, mayor of Rockmart, members of the City Council and two\r\n     members of the Klan.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter from an Exalted Cyclops the sugar coating has largely\r\ndisappeared. The author has lost sight of the small town \"purity\"\r\nreflected in the above letter, but feels that he will soon be called upon\r\nto march as a crusader against the foe. He writes:\r\n\r\n     \"Long live the Klan and those noble spirits who are inculcating its\r\n     creed into the hearts of slumbering America! This organization\r\n     happened just at the right psychological time; a little later perhaps\r\n     would have been too late; it stepped into the breach at the proper\r\n     moment and no other kind of organization on earth could have possibly\r\n     met the issue. You know and I know and every other thinking man\r\n     realizes and will admit the perils that menace this republic of ours.\r\n     The trouble is, too few people are given to thinking--people nowadays\r\n     are educated to every damn thing under the sun except think. It is up\r\n     to us to fill the void and I believe we can put the world to\r\n     thinking. It is not only the thinking man's duty to think, but to\r\n     have the moral courage to teach. In due course of time I feel no\r\n     doubt but that the influence of this Invisible Empire of thinkers\r\n     will be reflected in the destiny of this nation. I am a Mason, a\r\n     Rotarian and several other things, all of which I am proud, but first\r\n     of all I am proudest of the fact that I am a native-born, white\r\n     Gentile Klansman. What kind of country would this be with no lines\r\n     drawn between the Caucasian blood and the African race? It is too\r\n     awful to contemplate. I solemnly believe that we are facing another\r\n     crisis in our history; it is slowly, gradually, inevitably and surely\r\n     approaching. The foreign political and labor class fanatic; the\r\n     negro; the Jap and Romanism are threatening, if I can read the signs\r\n     of the times. The new, the reincarnated Ku Klux Klan is, as I\r\n     understand it, dedicated to the proposition of saving our flag and\r\n     forever maintaining this government as a _white man's_ government. No\r\n     nobler or grander cause was ever espoused by the brain and heart of\r\n     man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Emperor\" Simmons claims that the \"Invisible Empire\" is increasing at the\r\nrate of five thousand a week, and several extracts from the \"News-letters\"\r\nmight seem to prove his point; if not that they might serve the purpose of\r\nthe leaders of inspiring members to believe that they have the honor of\r\nbelonging to the great national movement of the century.\r\n\r\nIn the weekly \"News-letter,\" dated May 13, 1921, the Exalted Cyclops, of\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi, writes:\r\n\r\n     \"You gentlemen at headquarters will probably be pleased to know what\r\n     rapid strides the K. K. K. is making in this State. It is sweeping\r\n     Mississippi like wildfire. We are in hopes of having five hundred\r\n     members in our Klan by September 1, 1921. When we get our Klan up to\r\n     one thousand members we have perfected a scheme whereby, while we\r\n     will retain only one Klan here in Warren County, we will have all the\r\n     members from each separate district meet once a week and then have a\r\n     general meeting for the whole Klan each month, as it will be too\r\n     unwieldy to have such a large body meet frequently. You can readily\r\n     appreciate this when at our first meeting, when we had one hundred\r\n     and twenty-five charter members, we had thirty-five automobiles in\r\n     the grounds of our meeting place in the country.\r\n\r\n     \"The reason why everybody here has taken so keenly to the Klan is due\r\n     to the fact that years ago the Jews and Roman Catholics formed a\r\n     liaison with the liquor interests and have had politics in this city\r\n     throttled, and it is our intention to whip and rout them at the polls\r\n     when the next election comes around in 1922. We intend to put these\r\n     un-American elements out of office precisely as other communities\r\n     have done.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Grand Goblin Crippen, of St. Louis is of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n     \"I am glad to report that word comes from the Realm of Kansas that a\r\n     Ku Klux flying squadron has been formed in that State, and I would\r\n     also advise that several Klansmen are getting together a large group\r\n     of musicians who, they claim, will constitute one of the largest and\r\n     best brass bands in America, to be known as the Ku Klux Band.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"News-letter\" of May 27 reveals their claim that Ku Kluxism is making\r\nstrong headway outside of the Southern States. I quote at length from it\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Additional proof that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is being\r\n     welcomed with enthusiasm by the rank and file of one hundred per cent\r\n     American citizens wherever our representatives go is found in the\r\n     report of Hugh B. Cobb, one of the Imperial Officers, who has just\r\n     returned from a trip to Missouri and other States in that territory.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Cobb went to Joplin, Mo., especially to deliver an address by\r\n     invitation of the Joplin Klan. He says he found interest in Klankraft\r\n     running high and the members of the organization there are among the\r\n     highest type of citizens. On his return to Atlanta, Mr. Cobb spent\r\n     one day with Grand Goblin Crippen in St. Louis. He was greatly\r\n     pleased with Klansman Crippen and the work he is doing for the\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\n     \"'It is an inspiration to see the class of citizens who are knocking\r\n     at the outer door and applying for citizenship in the Invisible\r\n     Empire,' said Mr. Cobb. 'The best publicity or propaganda our\r\n     organization can have is the criticism of its enemies. No real\r\n     American citizen is deceived for long, if at all, by these critics,\r\n     because when he finds out who they are the first question he\r\n     naturally asks is: Why are they criticizing? And if he has any brains\r\n     at all it doesn't take him long to find out.'\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Cobb's report is indeed very encouraging since it deals with the\r\n     progress we are making in territory outside of the South. The\r\n     red-blooded American men of the North and West are accepting the Ku\r\n     Klux Klan as an American institution, because it is such, and because\r\n     it is the _only_ one hundred per cent American organization in the\r\n     whole United States. Think it over.\r\n\r\n     \"Another convincing proof that the Klan is taking hold is found in\r\n     the fact that our enemies are so rapidly attacking us. We mean\r\n     something to them apparently, although they scoffed at us in the\r\n     beginning. There is very little scoffing going on at the present\r\n     time, but there is considerable gnashing of teeth. We are glad to\r\n     say, however, that the bulk of the opposition with which we are\r\n     meeting now comes from those from whom we naturally would expect\r\n     opposition and with whom it is impossible for the Ku Klux Klan ever\r\n     to have anything in common.\r\n\r\n     \"At the outset we were opposed by many newspapers who had no idea of\r\n     our real aims and purposes. _They accepted the word of negro\r\n     associations and Catholics, Jews and other foreigners that we were a\r\n     lawless gang and criticized us accordingly._\"\r\n\r\nThere is considerable food for thought in the above extract. In the first\r\nplace I have never heard, in an experience of nearly twenty years, of a\r\nfraternal order sending out a communication in which it designated the\r\noutside public or any part of it as \"enemies.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in several of the \"News-letters\" that one of the points I\r\nam trying to bring out in my argument is confirmed. It is the\r\nclassification of the white Catholic and the white Jew with the negro, a\r\nclassification that can have but one inevitable effect--the creating of\r\ndiscord and dissension among members of the white race.\r\n\r\nThe last \"News-letter\" I have read was the one dated June 25. It was read\r\nat a meeting I attended in Chattanooga, and was descriptive principally\r\nof the work being done on the Pacific Coast by Grand Goblin Coburn, who\r\nhas charge of that Domain. The report indicated that a vigorous\r\npropagation campaign was going on in California and that people were\r\neagerly joining the Ku Klux Klan in response to its appeal for membership\r\non the ground of \"white supremacy\" over the Japanese. I fully believe that\r\nthe Pacific Coast will become one of the strongholds of Ku Kluxism, and\r\nwould not be surprised at any time to read in the newspapers of some\r\nsurface manifestations of the agitation of the race question. That a\r\nmovement managed in Atlanta, Ga., has no business meddling in the\r\ninternational affairs of this country is so obvious that it is quite\r\nunnecessary to comment further upon it.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which applications for membership are solicited in\r\nconnection with the work of the official lecturers is illustrated in the\r\nfollowing description of a lecture:\r\n\r\n     \"At the regular meeting of the Newport News Klan No. 8, Realm of\r\n     Virginia, held in its Klavern, Monday, May 30, a resolution was\r\n     introduced and passed by unanimous vote that Your Majesty be\r\n     requested if possible to return Col. J. Q. Nolan to Newport News at a\r\n     future date to deliver another address. Colonel Nolan spoke at the\r\n     Imperial Theater with a seating capacity of eight hundred with the\r\n     standing room only sign displayed before he even began speaking.\r\n     There were fully as many turned away as were able to hear him. If\r\n     possible to have him return we will secure the Academy of Music for\r\n     his address and we can promise him a packed house. Colonel Nolan won\r\n     the hearts of all who heard him and the request for his return comes\r\n     not only from Klansmen but from men and women from all walks of life.\r\n     At the meeting following Colonel's Nolan's address, ninety-one\r\n     applications were presented and interest has been aroused to fever\r\n     heat here. If it can be made possible for Colonel Nolan to return,\r\n     please have him do so. At the same time we would like to extend a\r\n     warm personal invitation to Your Majesty to come with Colonel Nolan,\r\n     for Newport News and our Klan would feel it an honor indeed to\r\n     entertain Your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the \"News-letters\" support my claim that the organization is\r\nendeavoring to throw its coils around all public officers. This is seen\r\nfor instance in the letter of May 20, 1921, which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"You may state in your weekly letter that in one city in Virginia we\r\n     have the chief of police, the commonwealth attorney, the postmaster,\r\n     the police court judge, members of the city council and the managing\r\n     editor of the leading paper and many other prominent business and\r\n     professional men. This is Newport News.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"News-letter\" of June 10, 1921, shows a still more sinister situation.\r\nThe Exalted Cyclops of Norfolk, Virginia, writes:\r\n\r\n     \"We have just taken in the chief of police. He is a fine up-standing\r\n     fellow, a major in the World War. We had a hard time getting\r\n     information regarding him, but when we found that he was eligible we\r\n     had no trouble enlisting him in our ranks and when he was initiated\r\n     you never saw such a pleased fellow; he radiated it, and when he\r\n     learned he was to have our support in upholding the law he was\r\n     certainly pleased, especially with our military organization, which\r\n     we offered him in case of trouble. He then informed us that the city\r\n     is insufficiently protected and that we are sitting on a volcano\r\n     regarding the negro question, that there is a great deal of unrest\r\n     among them and that we might have a riot at any time and he was very\r\n     much worried. He told us that not many months ago there was a riot in\r\n     the negro district, caused by negro soldiers attacking a district\r\n     police station to release a negro prisoner, but it never got into the\r\n     papers--so it was news to all of us. He welcomed us and the military\r\n     company is to be trained and two hundred and sixty repeating rifles\r\n     will be turned over to us in time of trouble. I asked how many in the\r\n     three hundred present at the meeting would be willing to join the\r\n     organization to assist the chief, and every one of them stood up. How\r\n     is that for one hundred per cent Americanism? They were told they\r\n     might have to sacrifice their lives in case of trouble, but they did\r\n     not flinch at duty. The chief of police states that any man we select\r\n     to head these two hundred and sixty Klansmen will be made by him\r\n     assistant director of public safety in charge of these Klansmen.\"\r\n\r\nImperial Kleagle Clarke, commenting on the above communication, states:\r\n\"We call that almighty fine. The Norfolk Klan is working along the right\r\nline and deserves to be highly commended for the steps it has taken in\r\nenforcement of the law and preservation of order.\"\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Norfolk communication reveals some interesting\r\npoints. In the first place the author of the letter says: \"We had a hard\r\ntime getting information regarding him, but when we found that he was\r\neligible we had no trouble enlisting him in our ranks.\" In other words,\r\nsome of the best and most efficient police officers in the United States\r\nare Irish-Catholics, and since, according to the Ku Klux Klan, they are\r\nforeigners and to be classed with the negro, it is highly important, first\r\nof all, to ascertain the religion of the chief of police. As he probably\r\nis not an active churchgoer this task was rather difficult, but when he\r\nwas found to be a Protestant, he was eagerly sought after. Now that the\r\nchief has taken the oath of allegiance to the \"Invisible Empire,\" and has\r\nsurrounded himself with his two hundred and sixty Ku Kluxes, I would not\r\ngive much for the chances of a Catholic to get on the Norfolk police\r\nforce. It is also interesting to read the fact that this particular Klan\r\nstates that it is military, and that a military company will be trained\r\nand drilled, and that rifles will be issued to this secret organization.\r\nIf this is a straw indicating the way in which the Ku Klux wind is\r\nblowing, it is not unreasonable to suppose that in the course of time\r\nthere will be a gigantic, secret, national organization drilled as\r\nsoldiers, and under the autocratic command of the \"Emperor of the\r\nInvisible Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"News-letter\" above quoted again makes an extract from the report of\r\nthe Exalted Cyclops of the Norfolk Klan, which is really more dangerous to\r\nthe United States than the one previously discussed. It is more dangerous\r\nfor the reason that it reflects the insane light of religious fervor and\r\nfanaticism in connection with this movement, and shows how the attempt of\r\nSimmons to build a secret Empire on the religious idea is bearing its\r\nfruit. I bespeak for this effusion a careful reading:\r\n\r\n     \"I did not think it possible that my enthusiasm for our noble order\r\n     could be increased, but your letter of the fourteenth instant, has\r\n     filled me with added inspiration. Having been offered an opportunity\r\n     for service in the field in Missouri, I am resigning my position with\r\n     the government here and hope soon to be among the chosen disciples of\r\n     our great Emperor proclaiming his inspired doctrine of new freedom to\r\n     the world. Beyond the simple office of treasurer in my home county I\r\n     have never sought public honors nor craved political preference, but\r\n     in the glorious work of this God-inspired order every ounce of my\r\n     energy will strive for excellence. I shall never seek the honor or\r\n     preferment of office except wherein I may contribute to the honor and\r\n     preferment of my Klan. My fellow Klansmen have here seen fit to\r\n     confer upon me the highest honor within their power, and God being my\r\n     witness, I would not barter it for any other honor that life may\r\n     hold. My only consolation in leaving my faithful Klan for a time is\r\n     that I may aid in the promulgation of the glorious institutions of\r\n     freedom which my sons battled for beneath the Stars and Stripes for\r\n     which I have pledged my blood beneath the flaming symbol of an\r\n     unconquered race of men.\"\r\n\r\nThese \"News-letters\" are valuable as showing the mental attitude of the\r\nworkers and members of the Ku Klux Klan. They show that wherever it is\r\npossible the national organization desires to throw its net around the\r\nofficers of the law, and enroll them in the system. Under the guise of\r\nassisting the authorities to enforce the law this is done, and to my\r\npersonal knowledge many conscientious and capable officers of the law\r\nbelieve that the idea is a good one. At the same time it is an alarming\r\nsituation when police officers and sheriffs who have already taken one\r\noath to the States in which they reside, take another--a vicious and\r\nillegal obligation--to an \"Invisible Empire,\" ruled autocratically by one\r\nman who has in mind plans he does not reveal to his followers. What is to\r\nhappen when the chief of police of a city swears to obey \"unconditionally\"\r\nall laws, regulations, decrees and edicts of the Ku Klux Klan \"which have\r\nbeen or which may be hereafter enacted.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever excuse the original Ku Klux Klan may have had for its existence,\r\nit is impossible to conceive any situation arising in this country at the\r\npresent time that calls for any extra-judicial organization, functioning\r\nin secret, and composed of men wearing robes and masks to conceal their\r\nidentities. And along this line, I want to call attention to a historical\r\nfact. The original Klan was organized and functioned at a time when the\r\ncourts and law-enforcing machinery of the South were paralyzed, but, as\r\nsoon as the courts began to administer justice, General Forrest, the Grand\r\nWizard, of the Ku Klux Klan, issued an order disbanding the organization\r\non the ground that it was no longer needed. Surely, if the original Klan,\r\nhaving functioned as an enormous \"vigilance committee\" in several States,\r\nfound that its services were not required, what real excuse can be\r\nadvanced for the continuance of an extra-judicial organization in these\r\ndays of ample courts, able officers of the law and the administration of\r\njustice? It seems to me that there are more than enough law-enforcement\r\nagencies in the United States.\r\n\r\nIf the system of judicature in the United States is so helpless that a\r\nsecret, masked, \"Invisible Empire\" is necessary to enforce the law, then\r\nthe cold truth is that the Federal and State governments are abject\r\nfailures. This then, being the case, it should be the duty of the people\r\nto devise ways and means to create and maintain a new system. In the face\r\nof the fact that this country has grown from a few small colonies to one\r\nof the greatest of world powers, and that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates has been the basic law under which this has been done, and that our\r\nsystem of law enforcement is entirely adequate, the attempt on the part of\r\nany organization whatever to take upon itself the enforcement of the law\r\nis a piece of presumptuous impudence. All laws are made and enforced by\r\nrepresentatives of the whole people. They are not enacted by or for the\r\nbenefit of a class and they cannot be enforced by a class.\r\n\r\nThe \"News-letters\" also indicate that the teachings of Simmons are taking\r\nfirm root in the minds of the religious element of the country. While I\r\nmay be disputed on this point, I believe, from my observations in various\r\nsections of the country which I have visited, that the people of the\r\nSouth as a whole take their churches and their religions more seriously\r\nthan do people elsewhere. The whole structure of modern Ku Kluxism is an\r\nattempt to clothe its real purposes and intentions in the garb of the\r\nbackwoods religious revival. Its ritualism is of the camp-meeting order,\r\nand all its ceremonies, as I shall show later, tend to awaken the emotions\r\nof provincial Protestantism. History has shown in numerous instances that\r\nwhere this religious fervor is aroused, it produces a blind fanaticism\r\nthat is one of the most dangerous forces in the body politic when it is\r\nturned loose. The inability of the fanatic to differentiate between the\r\npolitical activities of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the Roman\r\nCatholic Church as a great religious institution is one of the greatest\r\nmenaces of the Ku Klux movement.\r\n\r\nThe \"News-letters\" show further that already the fanatical \"citizens\" of\r\nthe \"Invisible Empire\" are catching hold of the idea of autocracy, and\r\nthat the \"subjects\" are addressing their rulers as \"Your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nWere the situation not so serious and of such vital moment to the American\r\npeople, this \"Empire\" of Ku Kluxism would be one of the greatest pieces of\r\nhumor ever perpetrated upon the American public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE KU KLUX OATH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the printed literature of the \"Invisible Empire,\" it is stated that\r\nthose who cannot assume a \"real oath,\" with serious determination to keep\r\nsame inviolate, are not desired in the ranks of Ku Kluxism. There is no\r\ndoubt whatever that \"Emperor\" Simmons, who probably wrote the oath, has\r\nproduced a \"real oath.\"\r\n\r\nIn making a critical analysis of the oath, I shall first reproduce it in\r\nits entirety, and then take it up in sections and show my viewpoint. If\r\nthis oath is not a dangerous document and likely to imbue people with the\r\nspirit of taking the law into their own hands, then a considerable portion\r\nof my contention against the Ku Klux Klan must necessarily fail. My case\r\nagainst Ku Kluxism rests to a large extent upon the potential danger to\r\nthe country from an absolutely secret organization, bound together by this\r\noath, under the sole domination of one man, and likely at any time to draw\r\ninto its ranks men with no regard for anything but the Ku Klux law.\r\n\r\nThe oath is printed separately from the ritual, and the name \"Ku Klux\r\nKlan\" does not appear in it. In places where the name is spoken there are\r\nasterisks. The document consists of three printed pages bound together,\r\nand, for the convenience of the person administering it, is broken up into\r\nphrases separated by dashes. I am giving it here properly punctuated so\r\nthat the reader can more easily grasp its significance. It is supposed to\r\nbe administered in sections, sandwiched in between the verbose and\r\nlong-winded effusions of \"Emperor\" Simmons as contained in the ritual.\r\nWhen the work is conferred by a full-degree team, it is given in \"long\r\nform\" and the procedure follows the order laid down in the ritual. Most of\r\nthe Kleagles, however, put on the ceremony of \"naturalization\" alone,\r\nusing the short form, in which case the oath is administered all at once.\r\nIn the present mad scramble for commissions on the \"donations,\" the\r\nKleagles administer the obligation at any time and place that suits the\r\nconvenience of the \"alien\" with the ten dollars, and Ku Kluxes are\r\nmanufactured on the \"pay-as-you-enter\" style in stores, factories, banks,\r\nphysicians' offices and any other place where there is freedom from\r\nintrusion. One enthusiastic Kleagle wrote to the home office that he had\r\narisen from his bed one night after midnight, and clad in his pajamas had\r\nadministered the obligation to a \"worthy alien,\" whose ten dollars burned\r\nso badly in his pocket that he could not wait until daylight to be\r\nseparated from his money.\r\n\r\nThe obligation, consisting of four sections, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION I. OBEDIENCE.\r\n\r\n     \"(You will say) 'I' (pronounce your full name--and repeat after\r\n     me)--'In the presence of God and man most solemnly pledge, promise,\r\n     and swear, unconditionally, that I will faithfully obey the\r\n     Constitution and laws; and will willingly conform to all regulations,\r\n     usages, and requirements of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which do\r\n     now exist or which may be hereafter enacted; and will render at all\r\n     times loyal respect and steadfast support to the Imperial Authority\r\n     of same; and will heartily heed all official mandates, decrees,\r\n     edicts, rulings, and instructions of the Imperial Wizard thereof. I\r\n     will yield prompt response to all summonses, I having knowledge of\r\n     same, Providence alone preventing.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION II. SECRECY.\r\n\r\n     \"I most solemnly swear that I will forever keep sacredly secret the\r\n     signs, words, and grip; and any and all other matters and knowledge\r\n     of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, regarding which a most rigid\r\n     secrecy must be maintained, which may at any time be communicated to\r\n     me and will never divulge same nor even cause the same to be divulged\r\n     to any person in the whole world, unless I know positively that such\r\n     person is a member of this Order in good and regular standing, and\r\n     not even then unless it be for the best interest of this Order.\r\n\r\n     \"I most sacredly vow and most positively swear that I will not yield\r\n     to bribe, flattery, threats, passion, punishment, persuasion, nor any\r\n     enticements whatever coming from or offered by any person or persons,\r\n     male or female, for the purpose of obtaining from me a secret or\r\n     secret information of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. I will die\r\n     rather than divulge same. So help me, God. AMEN!\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION III. FIDELITY.\r\n\r\n     \"(You will say) 'I' (pronounce your full name--and repeat after\r\n     me)--'Before God, and in the presence of these mysterious Klansmen,\r\n     on my sacred honor, do most solemnly and sincerely pledge, promise,\r\n     and swear that I will diligently guard, and faithfully foster every\r\n     interest of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and will maintain its\r\n     social cast and dignity.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will not recommend any person for membership in this\r\n     order whose mind is unsound, or whose reputation I know to be bad, or\r\n     whose character is doubtful or whose loyalty to our country is in any\r\n     way questionable.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will pay promptly all just and legal demands made\r\n     upon me to defray the expenses of my Klan and this Order, when same\r\n     are due or called for.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will protect the property of the Knights of the Ku\r\n     Klux Klan, of any nature whatsoever; and if any should be intrusted\r\n     to my keeping, I will properly keep or rightly use same; and will\r\n     freely and promptly surrender same on official demand, or if ever I\r\n     am banished from or voluntarily discontinue my membership in this\r\n     Order.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will, most determinedly, maintain peace and harmony\r\n     in all the deliberations of the gatherings or assemblies of the\r\n     Invisible Empire, and of any subordinate jurisdiction or Klan\r\n     thereof.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will most strenuously discourage selfishness and\r\n     selfish political ambition on the part of myself or any Klansman.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will never allow personal friendship, blood or family\r\n     relationship, nor personal, political or professional prejudice,\r\n     malice, or ill will, to influence me in casting my vote for the\r\n     election or rejection of an applicant for membership in this Order,\r\n     God being my Helper. AMEN!\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION IV. KLANISHNESS.\r\n\r\n     \"(You will say) 'I' (pronounce your full name--and repeat after\r\n     me)--'Most solemnly pledge, promise, and swear that I will never\r\n     slander, defraud, deceive, or in any manner wrong the Knights of the\r\n     Ku Klux Klan, a Klansman, nor a Klansman's family, nor will I suffer\r\n     the same to be done, if I can prevent it.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will be faithful in defending and protecting the\r\n     home, reputation, and physical and business interest of a Klansman\r\n     and that of a Klansman's family.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will at any time, without hesitating, go to the\r\n     assistance or rescue of a Klansman in any way; at his call I will\r\n     answer; I will be truly Klanish toward Klansmen in all things\r\n     honorable.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will not allow any animosity, friction, nor ill will\r\n     to arise and remain between myself and a Klansman; but will be\r\n     constant in my efforts to promote real Klanishness among the members\r\n     of this Order.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will keep secure to myself a secret of a Klansman\r\n     when same is committed to me in the sacred bond of Klansmanship--the\r\n     crime of violating _this_ solemn oath, treason against the United\r\n     States of America, rape, and malicious murder, alone excepted.\r\n\r\n     \"I most solemnly assert and affirm that to the government of the\r\n     United States of America and any State thereof which I may become a\r\n     resident, I sacredly swear an unqualified allegiance above any other\r\n     and every kind of government in the whole world. I, here and now,\r\n     pledge my life, my property, my vote, and my sacred honor, to uphold\r\n     its flag, its constitution, and constitutional laws; and will\r\n     protect, defend, and enforce same to death.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will most zealously and valiantly shield and\r\n     preserve, by any and all justifiable means and methods, the sacred\r\n     constitutional rights and privileges of free public schools, free\r\n     speech, free press, separation of church and state, liberty, white\r\n     supremacy, just laws, and the pursuit of happiness, against any\r\n     encroachment, of any nature, by any person or persons, political\r\n     party or parties, religious sect or people, native, naturalized, or\r\n     foreign of any race, color, creed, lineage, or tongue whatsoever.\r\n\r\n     \"All, to which I have sworn by _this_ oath, I will seal with my\r\n     blood. Be thou my witness, Almighty God! AMEN!\"\r\n\r\nThis document is the oath of the \"Invisible Empire,\" Knights of the Ku\r\nKlux Klan, and according to \"Emperor\" Simmons, good Americans are swearing\r\nto it at the rate of five thousand a week! For the benefit of those who\r\ncannot readily see the danger in such an obligation, and why it does not\r\nbelong in the class of obligations assumed by men who join real fraternal\r\norders, let us carefully analyze certain clauses.\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION I. OBEDIENCE.\r\n\r\n     \"I, in the presence of God and man, most solemnly pledge, promise,\r\n     and swear, unconditionally, that I will faithfully obey the\r\n     Constitution and laws; and will willingly conform to all regulations,\r\n     usages, and requirements of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which do\r\n     now exist or which may be hereafter enacted; and will render at all\r\n     times loyal respect and steadfast support to the Imperial Authority\r\n     of same; and will heartily heed all official mandates, decrees,\r\n     edicts, rulings, and instructions of the Imperial Wizard thereof. I\r\n     will yield prompt response to all summonses, I having knowledge of\r\n     same, Providence alone preventing.\"\r\n\r\nUntil I had resigned as Kleagle I had never been able to even see a copy\r\nof the constitution and laws. This was in the possession of the King\r\nKleagle of Tennessee, who stated that he had had great difficulty in\r\nsecuring it, and had been compelled to give a very rigid receipt for its\r\ncare and custody. The organization was evidently afraid to allow this\r\nbooklet to get into general circulation among the members, for the simple\r\nreason that its general perusal would have shown the members the truth.\r\nThey would have discovered that the organization was a \"one-man\" affair,\r\nwith \"Emperor\" Simmons in practical control, with a life-time easy job,\r\nliving on \"Easy Street\" as a result of money that came into the\r\norganization from the public. They would also have found that they were\r\nmembers of a military organization, and that the \"Emperor\" was the\r\nCommander-in-chief. Obedience to the \"Imperial Authority\" means obedience\r\nto \"Emperor\" Simmons.\r\n\r\nThis first section binds a \"citizen\" to obey \"unconditionally\" laws he has\r\nnever seen and is not permitted to see, and also to obey all laws that may\r\nbe enacted in the future regardless of whether he approves of the laws or\r\nnot. Any man who takes this obligation and keeps it, gives \"Emperor\"\r\nWilliam Joseph Simmons a blank check on his life, his liberty of thought,\r\nand his entire actions. Any one who doubts my statement has but to read\r\nthis section of the oath. It is there in plain English. Regardless of the\r\nmerits of the organization, no fraternal order man ought to be a member of\r\nany society in which he has so little voice in the management of its\r\naffairs, and the head of which has so framed the constitution that he will\r\nenjoy a lifetime of \"easy money.\" And the incorporators of the \"Invisible\r\nEmpire\" say in their application for a charter of the \"Knights of the Ku\r\nKlux Klan\" that they want to be classed with the Masons and Knights of\r\nPythias! In both those orders, the constitution and laws of the order are\r\nalways open for the inspection of any member who cares to see them, and I\r\nhave yet to hear of an official of Pythianism or Masonry who has been\r\nchosen to hold a position for life. Some officials have held office on\r\nmerit for many years, but their tenure for life is not fixed in the\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nUnder the second section of the oath, in the first clause, is found the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     \"I ... do most solemnly pledge, promise and swear, that I will\r\n     diligently guard and faithfully foster every interest of the Knights\r\n     of the Ku Klux Klan, and will maintain its social cast and dignity.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a sweeping declaration that every interest of this organization\r\nmust be held paramount, and the slightest deviation from absolute\r\nobedience and loyalty to \"Emperor\" Simmons, who is the organization, would\r\nmean that the offender had broken his oath. \"Maintaining its social cast\r\nand dignity\"--whatever that means may indeed be a very hard obligation to\r\nkeep.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will pay promptly all just and legal demands made\r\n     upon me to defray the expenses of my Klan and this Order, when same\r\n     are due or called for.\"\r\n\r\nHere we find that the avarice and greed that permeates the whole system of\r\norganized Ku Kluxism has even been incorporated into the oath. When a Klan\r\nis chartered, a per capita tax of $1.85 for each member is required to be\r\nsent to the Imperial Palace. If the organization has 650,000 members, as\r\nhas been claimed, then there will be derived from dues alone an annual\r\nrevenue of $1,202,500. In order to insure the payment of this vast sum,\r\nthe \"Emperor\" has sworn all his \"subjects\" to keep up the golden stream\r\nthat flows into the coffers of the \"Invisible Empire.\" Under this section,\r\nit would also be possible to levy an assessment on all of the members,\r\nwhich they would be bound to pay, or else they would be guilty of\r\nviolating their obligations. No amount of payment is specified. When a\r\nperson assumes the obligation, he gives \"Emperor\" Simmons a blank check on\r\nhis bank account.\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will never allow personal friendship, blood or family\r\n     relationship, nor personal, political, or professional prejudice,\r\n     malice, or ill will, to influence me in casting my vote for the\r\n     election or rejection of an applicant for membership in this Order.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Invisible Empire\" wants more \"citizens.\" More \"citizens\" mean more\r\nmoney. Under a ruling of the organization no person can be blackballed\r\nunless objectors are prepared to stand up in open lodge and state just\r\nwhat are their objections, and then they might be admonished to \"lay off.\"\r\nIn the present system of propagation the Kleagle is the court of last\r\nresort as to the persons who become charter members of a Klan.\r\n\r\nMuch capital is made by the organization of the fact that each person who\r\nbecomes a \"citizen\" of the \"Invisible Empire\" is required to take a\r\nsolemn oath to support the Constitution of the United States. While this\r\nis true, the allegiance to the Constitution and the law, is, in my\r\nopinion, pure camouflage for the purpose of concealing the deadly fangs of\r\nthis illegal oath. In considering this point, it should be borne in mind\r\nthat the members of the original Ku Klux Klan also took an oath to support\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, which oath can be found in the\r\nPrescript of the Order. Just how much weight the original Ku Kluxes\r\nattached to the Constitution of the United States when it became necessary\r\nto put the fear of God into a \"carpet-bagger\" or negro is a matter of more\r\nor less doubt. They were organized as a matter of necessity for the\r\npurpose of policing a section of the country where political madness and\r\nhatred reigned supreme. As will be shown further along, a Ku Klux Klan in\r\nBeaumont, Texas, in May, 1921, although all of its members had sworn to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, arrested a citizen without\r\na warrant, tried him with a jury, convicted him, and acted as his\r\nexecutioners in total violation of the Bill of Rights of the United States\r\nConstitution. It has been proven in one instance that swearing allegiance\r\nto the United States Constitution had but little effect, in preventing\r\nmembers of the \"Invisible Empire\" from committing acts of lawlessness.\r\nHence, I believe that the pious and patriotic clause in the oath of\r\n\"Emperor\" Simmons' organization is sheer camouflage, because the very\r\ndocument shows on its face that the Ku Klux oath is considered paramount\r\nto any other tie or obligation.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove this latter statement, I call special attention to the\r\nfollowing clause, which illustrates fully the relative importance the\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" attaches to the Constitution of the United States and\r\nthe Ku Klux obligation:\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will keep secure to myself a secret of a Klansman,\r\n     when same is committed to me in the sacred bond of Klansmanship--the\r\n     crime of violating _this_ solemn oath, treason against the United\r\n     States of America, rape, and malicious murder, alone excepted.\"\r\n\r\nNote this clause well! \"The crime of violating _this_ solemn oath\" comes\r\nfirst! Treason against the United States of America, rape and murder are\r\nafterthoughts. Under this clause, a Klansman can go to another Klansman\r\nand confess to having committed robbery, seduction, burglary and nearly\r\nevery other crime in the calendar, and the one to whom the commission of\r\nthe crime was confessed would be bound to keep the information secure to\r\nhimself. But, however, if a Klansman should confess to one of his fellows\r\nthat he had broken his Ku Klux oath, that violation of the obligation is a\r\ncrime of so heinous a nature that it is of more importance to the Ku Klux\r\nmind than the crime of treason against the United States of America,\r\nwhich crime comes second.\r\n\r\nThe most deadly part of the oath is saved for the end. The candidate has\r\nbeen led up to it by high-sounding words about \"Klanishness,\" and has\r\nsworn allegiance to the Constitution of the United States of America.\r\n\"Emperor\" Simmons knew very well that had he started off his oath with\r\nthis clause, most of his victims would have backed out, so he tacked it on\r\nat the end. It reads:\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will most zealously and valiantly shield and\r\n     preserve, by any and all justifiable means and methods, the sacred\r\n     constitutional rights and privileges of free public schools, free\r\n     speech, free press, separation of church and state, liberty, white\r\n     supremacy, just laws, and the pursuit of happiness, against any\r\n     encroachment, of any nature, by any person or persons, political\r\n     party or parties, religious sect or people, native, naturalized, or\r\n     foreign of any race, color, creed, lineage, or tongue whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nMy contention is that this part of the obligation is absolutely illegal,\r\nthat it is an accessory before the fact to lawlessness and mob violence,\r\nand brands the entire proposition as an outlaw enterprise that should be\r\nabolished and suppressed by the United States and State governments. Let\r\nus study a few of the words, as they stand out so strikingly. \"Zealously\r\nand valiantly,\" \"shield and preserve,\" \"any and all justifiable means and\r\nmethods,\" \"against any encroachment,\" \"of any nature,\" \"any person or\r\npersons,\" \"political party or parties,\" \"religious sect or people,\"\r\n\"native, naturalized, or foreign,\" \"any race, color, lineage, or tongue\r\nwhatsoever\"! Just read these groups of words over and over again! When\r\nindividuals or a group of individuals proceed to \"zealously and valiantly\"\r\nuse \"any and all justifiable means and methods\" to accomplish a certain\r\nspecified end, they take the law into their own hands. When the Barons\r\nwrested Magna Charta from King John at Runnymede, they \"used any and all\r\njustifiable means and methods\"! When the Germans invaded Belgium, and\r\ncynically declared that a treaty was a \"scrap of paper,\" they used \"any\r\nand all justifiable means and methods\"! When a mob of masked outlaws takes\r\na helpless old man from his bed and beats him up, they use \"any and all\r\njustifiable means and methods\"! When masked men drive up to a hotel and\r\nseize a helpless woman, convey her to a secluded spot, strip her clothing\r\nfrom her body and cover her with tar and feathers, they have used \"any and\r\nall justifiable means and methods.\" Under this outrageous oath, any band\r\nof ruffians or outlaws can defend any lawless action they wish to commit\r\non the ground that the \"means and methods\" were \"justifiable.\"\r\n\r\nIn the concrete instance I have previous mentioned, where the _Johnson\r\nCity Staff_ undertook to protest against the coming of Ku Kluxism to the\r\ntown, the spirit of the \"Invisible Empire\" interpreted \"freedom of speech\"\r\nto mean freedom only in so far as the Ku Klux Klan was allowed to proceed\r\nwith its affairs unmolested. As soon as opposition developed the Ku Klux\r\n\"freedom of the press\" manifested itself in a desire to boycott the\r\nnewspaper. Under the obligation to use \"any and all justifiable means and\r\nmethods\" I see no reason to deter a local organization from taking an\r\neditor out and administering a liberal coating of tar and feathers, in\r\ncase he should presume, in the columns of his paper, to antagonize the\r\n\"Invisible Empire.\"\r\n\r\nI have been a student of the Constitution of the United States for twenty\r\nyears, but until I saw the oath of the Ku Klux Klan, I never knew before\r\nthat \"white supremacy\" was a \"sacred constitutional right.\" The Fourteenth\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution removed all political\r\nbarriers against \"race, color, and previous condition of servitude,\" and\r\nguaranteed all citizens of the United States equal protection under the\r\nlaws. The Ku Klux oath, on the other hand, binds its followers to \"use any\r\nand all justifiable means and methods\" to enforce \"white supremacy,\" and I\r\nsee no reason why members of the organization would not interpret it to\r\nexcuse any and every shade of mob violence, lynching, hanging, or burning\r\nof negroes.\r\n\r\nBy the term \"separation of church and state\" is usually meant the\r\nresistance to the advance of the Catholic people in the political affairs\r\nof the country. Preachers of Protestant Churches may get up in their\r\npulpits and talk politics, may make speeches on the stump, and may take\r\nupon themselves the general duties of running a community, but their\r\nactions are seldom criticized. The advance of the Catholics in politics,\r\nhowever, is a \"union of church and state,\" in the popular conception, and\r\nthis advance, the Ku Klux swears that he will resist by \"any and all\r\njustifiable means and methods.\" The methods may be lawful and they may not\r\nbe, but to the \"Invisible Empire's\" obligation they would be \"justifiable\"\r\nif they succeeded in driving the Catholics out of public life.\r\n\r\nIt would also be well to note the blanket phrase \"the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.\" The oath says \"use any and all justifiable means and methods\"\r\nto secure the \"pursuit of happiness,\" which, by the way, is also classed\r\nas a \"sacred Constitutional right.\" This covers a multitude of things. A\r\nKu Klux might derive unbounded happiness out of covering his neighbor's\r\nbody with tar and feathers, while the victim of the performance might\r\nbecome a most unhappy individual as a result of the operation. The oath\r\nmeans in a few words that whatever suits the Ku Klux mind, whatever it\r\nwants to do in a community, it is going to use \"any and all justifiable\r\nmeans and methods\" to accomplish. The midnight prowler in his mask and\r\nwhite robe might well ask the question: \"What does a little thing like a\r\npolice force and sheriff's posse matter. If they attempt to interfere with\r\nus, we will simply remember our Ku Klux obligation, and 'zealously and\r\nvaliantly shield and preserve our pursuit of happiness by any and all\r\njustifiable means and methods.'\"\r\n\r\nUnder this section, any sort of crime can be excused in the mind of the\r\nperson who commits the crime. \"But,\" the answer probably will be, \"an act\r\nis not justifiable unless it is legal.\" The obligation might easily have\r\nbeen written so that the distinction could have been clearly stated, but\r\nit was not. That oath on its face is an accessory before the fact to any\r\nand all kinds of crimes and outrages, and placing such an obligation\r\nindiscriminately in the hands of men of average intelligence is like\r\ngiving dynamite to little children and expecting them not to be blown to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the oath of the \"Invisible Empire,\" there are three salient\r\nthings that stand out very prominently:\r\n\r\nFirst: It binds men to obey unconditionally laws they know nothing about,\r\nand laws which will be enacted in the future, and to follow blindly an\r\norganization which is largely a one-man affair.\r\n\r\nSecond: It places the Ku Klux obligation prior to the obligation to the\r\ngovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nThird: Its last paragraph is illegal, and is nothing more or less than the\r\ncondonement of mob rule and the use of methods in carrying out its views\r\nthat are contrary to all the basic laws of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE KU KLUX RITUAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter might well be entitled \"Ku-Kluxing a Sacrament,\" or \"How the\r\nKleagles, for Ten Dollars, profane Christianity's Holiest Rite.\"\r\n\r\nOn the title page of the fifty-four page booklet is the imprint \"Copyright\r\n1916, by W. J. Simmons, Atlanta, Ga.\"\r\n\r\nI venture to express the opinion that this is the first time in the\r\nhistory of the United States that a ritual of a secret order, genuine or\r\nalleged, has ever been copyrighted, and the very fact that it _is_\r\ncopyrighted suggests pertinent questions. As a general rule the protection\r\nof the copyright laws is a matter of dollars and cents to an author, and\r\nthe first question that suggests itself is: what royalty does Simmons get\r\nfrom the \"Invisible Empire\" for the use of his printed productions? Then\r\ncomes the further question: in whom does the title to the copyright rest?\r\ndoes Simmons own it, or has it been assigned to the corporation? If\r\nSimmons owns the copyright, and should die, would the title to the ritual\r\npass to his heirs or would the members of the Klan have anything to say as\r\nto the ownership of the secret book of their organization? If the\r\nquestion be answered in the negative the curious spectacle would be\r\npresented of an organization paying a royalty to people not members of\r\nthat organization. Another consideration is the fact that as the law\r\nrequires two copies of a book to be deposited in the Library of Congress,\r\nthe pages of this \"secret\" document are open to the study of any one who\r\ncares to go to Washington to examine them. Therefore, in his desire to\r\nsecure unto himself the property rights in the ritual, Simmons, who took\r\nthe oath not to divulge any of the secrets of his organization, violated\r\nhis obligation from the very beginning. As I am no longer a member of the\r\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan, I have no interest whatever in the relations\r\nof Simmons to his organization, but merely suggest these questions for the\r\nbenefit of the members who may be interested in the financial side of\r\ntheir own movement.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Ku Klux ritual is the \"Kloran.\"\r\n\r\nBefore discussing this name, which has an interesting story, it is\r\nnecessary to state that in all of the Ku Klux lingo, many words have been\r\nformed by the placing of the letter \"L\" after the first letter of a word.\r\nThus we have \"Klavern,\" the meeting place of the Klan, from \"Kavern;\"\r\nKloncilium, from Koncilium; Klaliff, from Kaliff, etc., etc. The name\r\n\"Kloran\" is the word \"Koran\" with the letter \"L\" placed after the \"K.\"\r\n\r\nThe Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is an \"Invisible Empire\" composed of none\r\nbut Protestant Christians, yet it appropriates the name of the Mohammedan\r\nBible for its sacred book.\r\n\r\nThe \"Kloran\" is called the \"white book,\" and on its front cover bears the\r\ninscription \"K-Uno,\" from which is inferred that it is the first degree of\r\nKu Kluxism. There is a hint in the \"sacred and inspired\" pages that there\r\nare other degrees to be taken, after the member has thoroughly imbibed the\r\npages of the \"Kloran,\" and has passed an examination upon the same. What\r\nthese \"higher degrees\" are, no man, as far as I can learn, knows save only\r\nhim, who \"for fourteen years\" communed with the gods and prepared himself\r\nfor the sublime mission of saving the United States from nearly half of\r\nits own citizens.\r\n\r\nOn the inside cover is the \"Ku Klux Kreed\" which is borrowed from the\r\ncreed of the original Klan, with such further additions as Simmons in his\r\ninfinite wisdom saw fit to add, and this is followed by the \"order of\r\nbusiness,\" which is similar to the average secret order, but expressed\r\n\"Simmonsly\" and not in the usual plain language of other organizations.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Klan as then set forth are \"The Exalted Cyclops,\" who\r\ncorresponds to the President; the \"Klaliff,\" to the Vice-President;\r\n\"Klokard,\" the lecturer; \"Kludd,\" the Chaplain (borrowed, by the way, from\r\nthe name of the high priest of the ancient Druids); the \"Kligrapp,\" the\r\nSecretary; the \"Klabee,\" the Treasurer; the \"Kladd,\" the conductor; the\r\n\"Klarogo,\" the inner guard; the \"Klexter,\" the outer guard; the \"Klokann,\"\r\nthe investigating committee; and the \"Night-hawk,\" who has charge of\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nThe text of the \"Kloran\" starts off with an \"Imperial Decree\" written in\r\nthe \"Simmons\" language, and signed by \"His Majesty,\" telling the members\r\nthat this book is \"_the_ book\" of the \"Invisible Empire,\" and that the\r\ndecree to preserve it, and study its sacred teachings is as binding as the\r\noriginal obligation. Then follows a complicated diagram of the \"Klavern,\"\r\nor meeting-place, showing the stations of the numerous officers and the\r\nroutes taken by candidates when going through the floor work.\r\n\r\nThe \"opening ceremony,\" which is supposed to be inflicted upon the Klan\r\nevery time it meets, covers eight closely printed pages of the \"Kloran,\"\r\nand is filled with tiresome and boring conversation between the various\r\nofficers. An opening \"klode,\" to the tune of \"Greenland's Icy Mountains,\"\r\nwith its chorus \"Home, Sweet Home\" is then to be sung, and this is\r\nfollowed by a long-winded prayer ending with a petition to the Lord to\r\n\"bless our Emperor.\" After more words, the poor Klan at last finds itself\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThen follows the \"closing ceremony\" which contains five pages of the same\r\nsort of wordy discourse, with a verse to the tune of \"Blest be the Tie\r\nthat Binds,\" a prayer for the success of the \"Invisible Empire,\" and the\r\nweary Klansmen are then allowed to go home.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the \"Kloran\" is taken up with the \"ceremony of\r\nnaturalization.\" In the entire ritual the alleged fraternal order is\r\ncalled the \"Invisible Empire,\" with only an occasional reference to its\r\nlegal incorporated title. The candidate is an \"alien\" until he has been\r\nbored to death to the extent of about thirty pages, whereupon he is made\r\n\"a citizen\" of the \"Invisible Empire\" through the process of\r\n\"naturalization.\" It is rather a curious anomaly that an American citizen,\r\nwho does not need to be naturalized to enjoy the privileges of American\r\ncitizenship has to be \"naturalized\" as a Ku Klux, while the foreign born,\r\nthe Catholics and the Jews cannot be naturalized at all. They are forever\r\n\"aliens.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of naturalization consists in walking the candidate from\r\nstation to station, causing him to listen to verbose passages, swearing\r\nhim to the obligation previously referred to, threatening him with death\r\nif he ever reveals any of the secrets, and finally making him go through a\r\nparody on the solemn and sacred rite of baptism.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of comparison with the original Prescript of the Old Ku Klux\r\nKlan, there are ten questions which are asked the \"alien\" upon his first\r\nentrance into the \"outer Den\" of the \"Klavern.\" These ten questions\r\nunmistakably show an intention on the part of the \"Invisible Empire\" to\r\nturn the United States in a country controlled by a \"class\" as opposed to\r\nseveral \"classes,\" and are so utterly at variance with the requirements of\r\nthe original Ku Klux Klan, as to add stronger proof that the present\r\norganization is a historical fraud with no right to use even the name of\r\nthe former organization. These questions which can be found on pages 25\r\nand 26 of the \"Kloran\" are as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Is the motive prompting your ambition to be a Klansman serious\r\n     and unselfish?\r\n\r\n     \"2. Are you a native born, white, Gentile American citizen?\r\n\r\n     \"3. Are you absolutely opposed to and free of any allegiance of any\r\n     nature to any cause, government, people, sect or ruler that is\r\n     foreign to the United States of America?\r\n\r\n     \"4. Do you believe in the tenets of the Christian religion?\r\n\r\n     \"5. Do you esteem the United States of America and its institutions\r\n     above any other government, civil, political or ecclesiastical, in\r\n     the whole world?\r\n\r\n     \"6. Will you, without mental reservation, take a solemn oath to\r\n     defend, preserve and enforce same?\r\n\r\n     \"7. Do you believe in clanishness and will you faithfully practice\r\n     same toward Klansmen?\r\n\r\n     \"8. Do you believe in and will you faithfully strive for the eternal\r\n     maintenance of white supremacy?\r\n\r\n     \"9. Will you faithfully obey our constitution and laws, and conform\r\n     willingly to all our usages, requirements and regulations?\r\n\r\n     \"10. Can you always be depended on?\"\r\n\r\nIn the above questions, the references to the Jew and the negro are\r\nobvious. The third question, \"Are you absolutely opposed to and free of\r\nany allegiance of any nature to any cause, government, sect, people or\r\nruler that is foreign to the United States of America?\" refers to the\r\nCatholic, in which the Pope is considered a foreign ruler, and the\r\nallegiance mentioned means spiritual allegiance as well as political. It\r\nwill be seen later, upon studying the Prescript of the original Klan, that\r\nno such questions were asked of applicants for membership and no such\r\nrestrictions imposed.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"alien\" has satisfactorily answered the above ten questions, and\r\nhas made his \"donation,\" the first two sections of the obligation are\r\nadministered, after which follow many papers of tiresome conversation.\r\n\r\nAfter walking the candidate several times around the \"Klavern,\" giving the\r\nvarious stationed officers the opportunity to spout forth \"Simmonsese,\"\r\nthe \"alien\" is led to the Exalted Cyclops who addresses a long \"charge\" to\r\nhim, admonishing him of the great seriousness of the organization, and\r\noffering him an opportunity to retire and proceed no further. This offer\r\nis very largely a \"bluff,\" because by this time the curiosity of the\r\n\"alien\" is at such a state that he would not think of retiring, and\r\ninvariably he signifies that he desires to remain for the entire\r\nperformance. There is more walking around, more verbose tommyrot, and\r\nthen the remainder of the oath is administered, and the candidate is ready\r\nfor \"naturalization.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"ceremony of naturalization\" of the \"Invisible Empire\" is a\r\nsacrilegious parody on the holy rite of baptism, following a threat of\r\ndeath if the \"alien\" violated his obligation to \"use any and all\r\njustifiable means and methods\" to carry out the work of the political\r\nmachine! There is no fraternal order in America which has ever dared to do\r\nthis, and I look back upon the fact that I \"baptized\" a number of men, who\r\nought to have known better, with a feeling of regret and humiliation.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"alien\" has taken the entire obligation he is asked by the\r\nExalted Cyclops: \"Sir, have you assumed without mental reservation your\r\nOath of Allegiance to the 'Invisible Empire'\"? The \"alien\" answers in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nThe Exalted Cyclops then warns him: \"Mortal man cannot assume a more\r\nbinding oath; character and courage alone will enable you to keep it.\r\nAlways remember that to keep this oath means to you honor, happiness, and\r\nlife; but to violate it means disgrace, dishonor and _death_. May\r\nhappiness, honor and life be yours.\"\r\n\r\nHaving been duly warned of death and dishonor, the \"alien\" is then led to\r\nthe \"sacred altar\" where rests the American flag, upon which is the Holy\r\nBible, opened at twelfth of--Romans--which Simmons says is his \"spiritual\r\ncharter\"--and across the pages of the Word of God is a naked dagger, grim\r\nreminder of the preceding warning of the snake. The Exalted Cyclops raises\r\na glass of water, and \"dedicates\" the \"alien,\" setting him apart from the\r\nmen of his daily association to the lofty service of the \"Invisible\r\nEmpire.\" He is then caused to kneel upon his right knee, and a parody on\r\nthe beautiful hymn, \"Just as I am Without One Plea,\" is sung by those of\r\nthe elect who can carry a tune. Behind the \"sacred altar\" burns the \"fiery\r\ncross,\" which is an upright piece of wood with a cross arm, in which are\r\nset burning candles. When the singing is concluded, the Exalted Cyclops\r\nadvances to the candidate and after dedicating him further, pours water on\r\nhis shoulder, his head, throws a few drops in the air, making his\r\ndedication \"in body,\" \"in mind,\" \"in spirit,\" and \"in life.\" Having thus\r\nsacrilegiously \"baptized\" the alien into the \"Invisible Empire of Ku\r\nKluxism,\" the \"Kludd,\" the chaplain of the Klan--very often a minister of\r\nthe gospel--steps forward and delivers a prayer to God to aid the\r\ncandidate to keep his obligation, the idea being, no doubt, that if God\r\ncannot or will not prevent the \"alien\" from \"keeping his mouth shut,\" the\r\ndagger or the secret bullet of the Ku Klux will!\r\n\r\nThe \"alien\" is then formally received as a \"citizen\" of the \"Invisible\r\nEmpire,\" in the name of the \"Emperor,\" and is entitled to all of the\r\nsecret work of the organization, which is as tiresome and boring as the\r\nwhole ritualistic twaddle. Most of this secret work is called the \"Way of\r\nthe Klavern,\" and is unimportant. One of the most interesting things of\r\nthe \"work\" is the salute that each Klansman is required to give the\r\nAmerican flag placed on a stand in the center of the room. The same salute\r\nis given whenever addressing the chair. It is the old salute of the\r\nConfederate Army, made with the right hand over the right eye, then\r\nreversing the hand so that the palm is in front.\r\n\r\nThe excessive number of signs and symbols used by the \"Invisible Empire\"\r\nare of no importance, but it will be of interest to mention the\r\n\"Klonversation\" which is a system of code words, by which one Ku Klux can\r\nknow another. These code words are composed of the first letters of words\r\nin a sentence, and are used as a dialogue, as follows:\r\n\r\nUpon meeting a stranger whom he wishes to test, the Klansman says:\r\n\r\n     AYAK, meaning, Are You A Klansman? the answer being,\r\n\r\n     AKIA, A Klansman I Am.\r\n\r\n     CAPOWE, Countersign And Password Or Written Evidence?\r\n\r\n     CYGNAR, Can You Give Number And Realm?\r\n\r\n     No. 1, ATGA, Number One Klan of Atlanta, Ga.\r\n\r\n     KYGY, Klansman I Greet You.\r\n\r\n     ITSUB, In The Sacred Unfailing Bond.\r\n\r\n     (They shake hands with the left hand)\r\n\r\n     KLASP, Klannish Loyalty A Sacred Principle,\r\n\r\n     KABARK, Konstantly Applied By All Regular Klansmen.\r\n\r\nThe Exalted Cyclops then instructs the newly-made Klansman in the\r\nCountersign and Password, which at the present time are the words \"White,\"\r\nand \"Supremacy.\" The citizen is then solemnly instructed in the \"MIOAK,\"\r\nor the Mystical Insignia of a Klansman, which is a cheap little celluloid\r\nbutton that is supposed to be the real innermost secret of Ku Kluxism. The\r\nMIOAK is red in color, and contains the letters KOTOP, with a square, and\r\nan extended open hand, and constitutes the emblem of the Klan. No\r\nexplanation of the real meaning of the mystic words has ever been given,\r\nalthough the Kleagles generally tell their victims that it stands for\r\n\"Knights of the Open Palm,\" a designation arising no doubt from the\r\neagerness with which the open palm of the Kleagle is extended to receive\r\nthe ten dollar \"donations\" so necessary in the manufacture of \"citizens\"\r\nfrom the \"alien\" raw material. The word Kotop is also used as a hailing\r\nword, its answer being \"Potok,\" a reversal of the previous word. This is\r\nfollowed by the presentation of \"Imperial Instructions,\" which is a\r\nbooklet, \"The Practice of Klanishness,\" containing many pages of the same\r\nwordy stuff with which the ritual is filled. This book enjoins the members\r\nto stick together in all things, but more especially to render at all\r\ntimes the greatest respect to the \"Emperor\" who is working day and night\r\nfor the \"cause,\" and for whom the \"cause\" is also working.\r\n\r\nThere is a long-winded, verbose and ridiculous \"lecture\" at the end of the\r\n\"Kloran\" that endeavors to give a history of the original Ku Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nIn the last two pages of the \"Kloran\" are to be found \"titles and\r\nexplanations\" of the various officers and subdivisions of the \"Invisible\r\nEmpire,\" which have no importance to the general reader. It might be\r\ninteresting, however, to note with what modesty \"Emperor\" Simmons speaks\r\nof himself when he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"IMPERIAL WIZARD--The Emperor of the Invisible Empire; a wise man; a\r\n     wonder-worker, having power to charm and control.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nANTI-NEGRO PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a white man.\r\n\r\nI believe that the United States is a white man's country.\r\n\r\nBy all the instincts and traditions of my race, I believe that the United\r\nStates having been created by white men will be ruled by white men. I do\r\nnot believe that this doctrine applies merely to Tennessee and the rest of\r\nthe Southern States, but to the entire country. In spite of innumerable\r\ncriticisms hurled against the South in its handling of the negro, the\r\nentire country is gradually beginning to see that the South is right,\r\nbecause the South has demonstrated that the white race and the black race\r\ncan live side by side and work side by side without friction. In cases\r\nwhere there is friction, the cause does not come from the best leadership\r\nof the South, as will be shown later on.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the two races get along better when they are\r\nsegregated. I expect to live to see the day when the people of the North\r\nprovide separate schools for white and negro children, when negroes will\r\nnot be elected to public office by white votes, and when politicians who\r\ncater to negro votes are sent to political oblivion. That such a condition\r\nwill exist, I feel sure, but it will not be brought about by such\r\norganizations as the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. It will come through an\r\nenlightenment of public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Ku Klux Klan along the lines of race prejudice are\r\nthe activities of the \"professional Southerner,\" the political demagogue,\r\nand the sentiment of the \"poor white\" of the South. They are typical of\r\nthe political spirit that has kept the South in bondage for thirty years,\r\na spirit that has sent mediocre politicians to Congress and to other high\r\noffices, while abler men were shoved into the background.\r\n\r\nThe professional negro-baiter of the South has been greatly assisted by\r\nwhite people and negroes in the North, and I believe that the most\r\nvaluable propaganda work for the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan which has\r\nbeen done along racial lines has been that of Senator Boies Penrose, of\r\nPennsylvania. If Senator Penrose had been on the pay-roll of the Ku Klux\r\nKlan, and had been completely wrapped up in the success of the movement,\r\nhe could not have secured more members than he did by issuing a statement\r\nto his negro constituents that the time had come to accord complete\r\nequality to the negro race. Of course Senator Penrose did not mean any\r\nsuch thing, but a public statement that he favored an equal rights' bill\r\nthen pending at Harrisburg was a pleasant sop to the negro voters of\r\nPhiladelphia who immediately saw visions of the dining room of the\r\nBellevue-Stratford Hotel and the Adelphia. The fact that the members of\r\nthe Pennsylvania legislature quickly and very quietly choked the bill to\r\ndeath showed the real sentiment of the white people of the State. The\r\nresult in the South, however, was highly inflammatory. Carried by the\r\nAssociated Press to every paper, its effect upon the minds of the people,\r\nespecially the ignorant and uneducated, was like pouring gasoline on a hot\r\nstove. I am told that the enrollments of the Klan in the States comprising\r\nthe \"Black Belt\" jumped by leaps and bounds, indicating that the ambitious\r\nKleagles, looking for their four dollars a head, worked overtime in the\r\nuse of the Penrose article.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of political clap-trap that aided the Ku Klux organizers was\r\nthe action of the Speaker of the House, in the New Jersey legislature, in\r\npermitting a negro to occupy the speaker's chair during part of the last\r\nsession. This was duly featured in the newspapers, and the Ku Klux Klan's\r\nworkers very promptly asked the question: \"Do you want this sort of thing\r\nto happen again in the South?\" The answer came back most emphatically, \"We\r\ndo not.\" \"Then give me your ten dollars and sign here,\" the organizer\r\nwould reply. If there is a negro in the legislature of New Jersey, he was\r\nelected by white voters.\r\n\r\nThe periodical attempt of fanatical members of Congress to reduce the\r\nSouth's representation in that body on the ground that the negro is not\r\npermitted to vote have generally been featured in the newspapers, and much\r\ncapital made of them by demagogic politicians. These things have aided the\r\ncampaign of the Klan.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful recruiting force for the Ku Klux organization is the\r\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples, not \"colored\r\npeople\" but \"peoples,\" meaning no doubt people of all races except the\r\nwhite race. This organization through its press agency has issued\r\nstatement after statement that has been eagerly taken up by the few papers\r\nthat openly advocate Ku Kluxism, and used as effective propaganda in\r\nsecuring more members.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the list of field workers of the Knights of the Ku Klux\r\nKlan throughout the United States reveals the fact that strong propaganda\r\nwork is being carried on in cities where there is a large negro\r\npopulation. In New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and\r\nIndianapolis are active and aggressive headquarters from which encouraging\r\nreports come to the Atlantic headquarters.\r\n\r\nAs a general proposition, I believe that the very existence of a secret\r\norganization bearing the name Ku Klux is having an effect of promoting\r\nunrest among the entire negro population of the South. While the negro\r\ncuts but little figure in the section in which I was working, I learned\r\nfrom published reports and from conversations with newspaper men that\r\nthere was a feeling of great uneasiness among the Knoxville negroes due to\r\nthe activities of the Klan. In Chattanooga, where, on account of its\r\nanti-Catholic propaganda, the Klan is making strong headway, I found that\r\nthe racial situation was more accentuated. Chattanooga is a large and\r\nimportant manufacturing center, and many of the big plants employ negro\r\nlabor. A negro workman possessing the skill and ability requisite to hold\r\nhis position can work at his trade in Chattanooga, and as a general rule\r\nthe laboring classes of the negro race are industrious, contented,\r\nprosperous and happy. In talking, with men closely identified with the\r\nmanufacturing interests, I learned that the feeling of discontent and\r\nunrest is taking the place of the negro's former attitude, and that should\r\nthe Klan succeed in gaining a substantial foothold it will mean the\r\nemigration of large numbers of negro laborers to Northern States, a thing\r\nthat will seriously cripple the industrial life of the city. I found that\r\nthe Chattanooga manufacturers, almost to a man, were absolutely opposed to\r\nthe idea of having a Ku Klux Klan in the city.\r\n\r\nAll thinking men agree that the race question in the United States is one\r\nof the most ominous in the entire country. All right thinking people\r\ndesire it settled peacefully and in a way that will not disturb the\r\neconomic and industrial situation. I believe that, if left alone, the\r\nnegro will work out his own salvation. The history of the South for the\r\npast fifty years shows that the negro has been a most important factor in\r\nthe development and upbuilding of the section.\r\n\r\nMy experience and observations on the race question has convinced me that\r\nin ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, where friction, serious or\r\ntrivial, has occurred between the white and negro races, it has been due\r\nto the lower classes of the two races. Between the better-class white men\r\nand the better-class negro, there is, always has been, and always will be\r\nthe best of feeling. I often have had Northern people say to me: \"You\r\nSouthern people hate negroes!\" I always hasten to correct the statement,\r\nby replying, \"The best people of the South not only do not hate a negro\r\nbut they hold him in high esteem. The better class of Southern white man\r\nis the best friend the negro race has in this country today.\" The\r\n\"hatred,\" if such is the word, exists between the low-class negro and the\r\nlow-class white man, and if it were possible to analyze the real cause of\r\nthe racial disorders in the country, it would probably be found that they\r\nare due to bad white men, bad negroes and bad whiskey.\r\n\r\nWhile I make no charge that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan have taken any\r\npart in them, it is a fact, nevertheless, that since this organization was\r\nstarted, there have been an abnormal number of instances of interracial\r\nfriction. In the State of Georgia, where the Klan is probably strongest,\r\nthere has been case after case of disorder. It seems to me that as an\r\norganization designed to aid the authorities in the enforcement of \"law\r\nand order,\" the Ku Klux Klan has utterly failed to prevent these\r\noccurrences. If the Klan is capable of sustaining the arms of the law, why\r\nhas it not done so in the State of Georgia?\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer of 1921, the whole country was shocked at the outbreak\r\nof a race riot in Tulsa, Okla., when an entire community was plunged into\r\nbloodshed and a vast amount of property destroyed. From the published\r\naccounts of the riot, it started from the most trivial cause imaginable,\r\nand in a short time white men and negroes were arrayed against each other\r\nin regular pitched battle. In examining the list of field workers of the\r\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan, it is noticeable that there is a large force\r\nof Kleagles at work in the State of Oklahoma, and the presumption is that\r\nthere is a Klan of Ku Kluxes in existence at Tulsa. Why did not the Klan\r\nrally to the support of the authorities and \"enforce law and order?\" The\r\nenforcement of law and order consists of stopping riot. Why was the riot\r\nnot stopped? In this connection, I heard the leader of the Ku Klux Klan in\r\nChattanooga, where I attended a large meeting shortly before resigning,\r\nmake the statement that several weeks prior to the outbreak of the Tulsa\r\nriot he had been informed by a travelling man, also a Ku Klux, that a\r\nclash between the races was likely to occur within a short time. If this\r\ncondition was a true one, why were the authorities and their valuable aids\r\nand abettors, the Ku Klux Klan, not prepared to stop it?\r\n\r\nA great bugaboo that is constantly harped upon by the professional\r\nSoutherner and by the Ku Klux organizer is the cry of \"social equality\"\r\nlikely to be forced upon the white people by the negro. This argument\r\nappeals to the ignorant white man, but the intelligent man knows that\r\nsocial equality between any races or people is a myth. There is no such\r\nthing as social equality between members of the white race. Social\r\nequality is a matter of opinion only, for while I might think that I am\r\nsuperior to a person, that same person might think that he is superior to\r\nme. Society is split into strata made up largely through community of\r\ninterest, and congeniality of ideas and thoughts. The man whose sole\r\nthought in life is the accumulation of money regards only his own kind as\r\nhis equal; the social butterfly skilled in the arts of polite society\r\nlooks with horror upon the \"impossible\" person who is not; the scholar\r\nseeks solace and equality among people of brains; and the philosopher,\r\nlooking at the whole human race with its follies and foibles, winks at his\r\nbrother philosopher and laughs at all of them. When such a thing as\r\nequality exists between the members of the white race, then, and not\r\nuntil then, will it ever become necessary seriously to consider the matter\r\nof social equality between the white and black races.\r\n\r\nWhile I believe in the principles of a white man's country and a white\r\nman's government, I believe that the negro is as much entitled to his\r\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as I am, and that he should be\r\nafforded all the protection that the courts and laws of the country can\r\ngive him. I have seen cases tried in the South where negroes have been\r\nconvicted of crime on evidence which, if presented against a white man,\r\nwould be thrown out of court. Such cases are, however, uncommon, as I\r\nbelieve the average officer of the law in the South is usually fair and\r\nsquare in his treatment of the negro race.\r\n\r\nThe only way, in my judgment, that the race question will ever be\r\nsuccessfully handled in the South, is by the promotion of better feeling\r\namong the high-class men of both races, and then have these men work on\r\nthe lower classes. Let the leaders of the negro race take a strong stand\r\nin opposition to the vicious negro, whose crimes against women and\r\nchildren have done much toward placing the ban upon the negro as a whole;\r\nand let the leaders of the white race cast aside the demagogue and impress\r\nupon the lower-class white man that because his skin is white is no excuse\r\nfor the exercise of brutality toward the negro. Let the proposition be\r\nsunk home that a white rough-neck, because his skin is white, has no\r\nwarrant to ride roughshod over a decent and law-abiding negro because the\r\nlatter's skin happens to be black.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern States, while the better class of negroes attend to their\r\nown business and conduct themselves well, the lower-class negro should be\r\ntaught the value of decent behavior and good manners in public. Many\r\nnegroes, particularly the vicious element, come to the North, and imagine\r\nthat the treatment with which they are accorded gives them the license to\r\ncrowd into the street cars, and make themselves offensive generally to\r\nwhite people. The negro with good manners wins his way wherever he goes,\r\nbut the noisy, pugnacious individual, but newly arrived from the country\r\nof the \"Jim Crow\" street car does much to bring his entire race into\r\ndisrepute. At the risk of arousing the ire of my Ku Klux friends, I\r\nadvance the thought that a man can be a gentleman and a woman can be a\r\nlady even if their skins are black; and that people who are white can be\r\noffensive and boorish.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of wiping out of our national life any organization, agency\r\nor association that tends to stir up the race question in any manner,\r\nshape or form, and leaving the subject to take care of itself under the\r\nguidance of men in the South who are devoting their lives to the work. In\r\nthe city of Atlanta, there is an organization known as the Interracial\r\nAssociation headed by Rev. Ashby Jones, a Baptist minister, whose father,\r\nRev. John William Jones was a chaplain in the Confederacy under General\r\nLee. Men of the highest standing, including Dr. C. B. Wilmer, a well-known\r\nEpiscopal minister of Atlanta, are in this movement, and I am informed\r\nthat since they have commenced their activities, there has been a great\r\ndeal of positive good accomplished in the elimination of discord between\r\nthe white people and the negroes. On the other side, Doctor Moton, the\r\nhead of the Tuskegee Institute, founded by Dr. Booker T. Washington, is\r\ngoing up and down the South, preaching sane things to the negro and to the\r\nwhite men. The leadership of these men represents the best thought and the\r\nbest effort of both races in the South. The leadership of William J.\r\nSimmons and his Ku Klux Klan does not.\r\n\r\nI think that the stirring up of the race question in the South, or\r\nelsewhere, for that matter, is at all times as dangerous as playing with\r\ndynamite, but the Ku Klux Klan has included in their propaganda against\r\nthe negro its fight on the Catholics and Jews. While they do not specify\r\nin their ritual that this is the case, they imply it, and I have seen the\r\nactual propaganda as it is handled. The classification of the white\r\nCatholic and Jew with the negro is a stupid blunder, if nothing else. It\r\nis stupid, because, in the event of trouble on an extensive scale stirred\r\nup by this organization or by its psychological effect on the country, it\r\nis splitting the white race into factions at a time when it should stand\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs I shall show further on, in discussing the history and structure of the\r\noriginal Ku Klux Klan, there is absolutely no racial condition in the\r\nSouth or anywhere in America today that warrants the existence of such an\r\norganization. It is even worse than folly to make the religious element\r\nfigure into questions touching a section where racial matters are always\r\nin the acute stage.\r\n\r\nIn order to swell its roster, and to bring under its banner of discord all\r\nthe elements in the country which it thinks it can handle, Ku Kluxism is\r\nattempting to win the people of the Pacific Coast by putting forth the\r\ndoctrine of \"White Supremacy\" in relation to the Japanese question. I have\r\nseen and heard read many reports from California indicating that the\r\nKleagles on the coast are doing a land office business and that the people\r\nare \"donating ten dollars\" to the \"noble cause\" as rapidly as they can\r\nsign the petition for citizenship. Without regard to the merits or\r\ndemerits of the Japanese question, as it affects the people of California,\r\nthere again creeps into the subject the discrimination against white men\r\nby classing them as foreigners along with the Japanese. I know nothing of\r\nthe industrial conditions of California, but I am quite sure that a\r\nportion of the prosperity and greatness of the State has been developed\r\nby Catholic and Jewish people.\r\n\r\nAs a general proposition Southern people are exceptionally capable of\r\nsympathizing with Californians in their peculiar racial problem, and would\r\nprobably back them in every way that is legitimate, but the Japanese\r\nquestion is an international one, and should be and must be handled by the\r\nState department in Washington, and not by the \"Emperor\" of the \"Invisible\r\nEmpire\" in Atlanta. The carrying on of a vigorous campaign for members of\r\nthe Ku Klux Klan on the Pacific Coast is an infringement on the duties and\r\nprerogatives of the United States Government. If it is not stopped, it is\r\nlikely to lead to unpleasant and dangerous international consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest pieces of evidence that the Simmons monstrosity is\r\nnot \"the genuine original Klan,\" and that its claim to being \"a monument\r\nto the Confederate soldier\" is an insult to the cause headed by Jefferson\r\nDavis and Robert E. Lee, is its propaganda of religious animosity and\r\nprejudice, which is directed specifically at Catholics and Jews. While it\r\nclaims to be a great and \"noble cause\" for the \"uplift\" of humanity, the\r\nprotection of womanhood, the enforcement of law and order and the\r\nmaintenance of \"white supremacy,\" I am firmly convinced that its\r\nfundamental idea is the creation of a secret political Empire for the\r\npurpose of totally eliminating Catholics and Jews from public life.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather surprising thing to me that a man who claims to have spent\r\na part of his life as a professor of history in any college should be so\r\nstrangely unfamiliar with the composition of the Southern Confederacy. I\r\nwonder if Simmons ever heard of Judah P. Benjamin! One of the foremost and\r\nablest men in the cabinet of Mr. Davis was a Jew! I wonder if the Imperial\r\nWizard and Emperor of the Invisible Empire ever looked into the military\r\nrecords of the Confederate Army and saw the large number of Jewish names,\r\nand if he knows that among some of the best and bravest soldiers the South\r\never had the Jew was very much in evidence. I wonder if Simmons ever heard\r\nof Pat Clebourne, the fighting Irishman who gave a good account of himself\r\nevery time he went into action, or if he ever read the beautiful poems of\r\nFather Ryan, a Catholic priest who followed the Stars and Bars into the\r\nvery jaws of hell to comfort the wounded and administer to the dying.\r\nThere was scarcely a company of infantry, a troop of cavalry or battery of\r\nartillery, that did not have an Irish Catholic on its roster, and they\r\nsoldiered and suffered and fought and died for the South along with their\r\nProtestant comrades. Yet, in the year 1915, is commenced the erection of a\r\n\"monument to the Confederate soldier\" in the shape of a secret,\r\nJew-baiting, Catholic-baiting, Negro-hating, money-getting proposition\r\nthat has the effrontery to call itself the name of the \"Ku Klux Klan,\" and\r\nto presume with its white-robed and masked members, to interfere with the\r\nadministration of justice in the United States.\r\n\r\nAlong the lines of anti-Catholicism, the organization is working hard.\r\nAmong the very first consignments of printed matter I received from \"The\r\nGate City Manufacturing Company\" of Atlanta was a lot of cards, bearing no\r\nimprint, but asking several questions about the Catholic Church. The\r\nfollowing is a copy:\r\n\r\n     \"DO YOU KNOW?\"\r\n\r\n     \"That the pope is a political autocrat.\r\n\r\n     \"That a secret treaty made by him started the war.\r\n\r\n     \"That he is enthroned and crowned and makes treaties and sends and\r\n     receives ambassadors.\r\n\r\n     \"That one hundred and sixteen princes of his government are enthroned\r\n     in our cities.\r\n\r\n     \"That he has courts here enforcing the canon law.\r\n\r\n     \"That he controls the daily and magazine press.\r\n\r\n     \"That he denounces popular government as inherently vicious.\r\n\r\n     \"That his canon law condemns public schools and forbids children to\r\n     attend them.\r\n\r\n     \"That popery enthroned in great cities controls politics.\r\n\r\n     \"That our war industries were placed exclusively in Roman Catholic\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\n     \"That no sectarian body or fraternal order but Knights of Columbus\r\n     was permitted to do war-relief work in the army and navy.\r\n\r\n     \"That Roman Catholics compose one-sixth of our population and hold\r\n     three-fourths of the public offices, being entrenched in national,\r\n     state, and city governments throughout the country.\r\n\r\n     \"That they are pouring into our land as immigrants at the rate of two\r\n     millions a year.\r\n\r\n     \"That Knights of Columbus declare they will make popery dominant in\r\n     the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"Let us arouse the people and save our country as the beacon light of\r\n     constitutional liberty and the hope of the world.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the methods used by propagandists of the Ku Klux Klan in enlisting\r\nrecruits by means of attacks on the Catholic Church is a certain bogus\r\noath purporting to be the obligation assumed by members of the Fourth\r\nDegree of the Knights of Columbus. This oath first made its appearance in\r\nthis country in 1912, and was widely circulated by anti-Catholics. In\r\n1913, in a contested election case involving a seat in Congress from\r\nPennsylvania, Eugene C. Bonniwell, himself a Catholic, filed charges with\r\na Congressional Committee that this alleged oath had been circulated by\r\nhis opponent Thomas S. Butler, who denied that he had been responsible for\r\nsuch circulation and had urged his followers that they refrain from\r\ncirculating the oath. Purely as a matter of a legal exhibit, a copy of\r\nthis \"oath\" was ordered printed in the Congressional Record, February 15,\r\n1913. The document as given in the Congressional Record reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS OATH. FOURTH DEGREE\r\n\r\n     \"I, -- ---- ----, now in the presence of Almighty God, the blessed\r\n     Virgin Mary, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles, St.\r\n     Peter and St. Paul, and all the saints, sacred host of Heaven, and to\r\n     you, my Ghostly Father, the superior general of the Society of Jesus,\r\n     founded by St. Ignatius Loyola, in the pontification of Paul the III,\r\n     and continued to the present, do by the womb of the Virgin, the\r\n     matrix of God, and the rod of Jesus Christ, declare and swear that\r\n     His Holiness, the Pope, is Christ's vice-regent and is the true and\r\n     only head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth;\r\n     and that by virtue of the keys of binding and loosing given his\r\n     Holiness by my Saviour, Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose\r\n     heretical kings, princes, States, Commonwealths, and Governments and\r\n     they may be safely destroyed. Therefore to the utmost of my power, I\r\n     will defend this doctrine and His Holiness's right and custom against\r\n     all usurpers of the heretical or Protestant authority whatever,\r\n     especially the Lutheran Church of Germany, Holland, Denmark, Sweden,\r\n     and Norway, and the now pretended authority and Churches of England\r\n     and Scotland, and the branches of same now established in Ireland,\r\n     and on the Continent of America and elsewhere, and all adherents in\r\n     regard that they may be usurped and heretical opposing the sacred\r\n     Mother Church of Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"I do now denounce and disown any allegiance as due to any heretical\r\n     king, prince, or State, named Protestant or Liberals, or obedience to\r\n     any of their laws, magistrates, or officers.\r\n\r\n     \"I do further declare that the doctrine of the Churches of England\r\n     and Scotland, of the Calvinists, Huguenots, and others of the name of\r\n     Protestants or Masons to be damnable, and they themselves to be\r\n     damned who will not forsake the same.\r\n\r\n     \"I do further declare that I will help, assist, and advise all or any\r\n     of His Holiness's agents, in any place where I should be, in\r\n     Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Ireland, or America, or in any other\r\n     kingdom or territory I shall come to, and do my utmost to extirpate\r\n     the heretical Protestant or Masonic doctrines and to destroy all\r\n     their pretended powers, legal or otherwise.\r\n\r\n     \"I do further promise and declare that, notwithstanding that I am\r\n     dispensed with to assume any religion heretical for the propaganda of\r\n     the Mother Church's interest, to keep secret and private all her\r\n     agents' counsels from time to time, as they instruct me, and not\r\n     divulge, directly or indirectly, by word, writing, or circumstances\r\n     whatever, but to execute all that should be proposed, given in\r\n     charge, or discovered unto me by you, my Ghostly Father, or any of\r\n     this sacred order.\r\n\r\n     \"I do further promise and declare that I will have no opinion or will\r\n     of my own or any mental reservation whatsoever, even as a corpse or\r\n     cadaver (perinde ac cadaver), but will unhesitatingly obey each and\r\n     every command that I may receive from my superiors in the militia of\r\n     the Pope and of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n     \"That I will go to any part of the world whithersoever I may be sent,\r\n     to the frozen regions North, jungles of India, to the centers of\r\n     civilization of Europe, or to the wild haunts of the barbarous\r\n     savages of America without murmuring or repining, and will be\r\n     submissive in all things whatsoever is communicated to me.\r\n\r\n     \"I do further promise and declare that I will, when opportunity\r\n     presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly and openly, against\r\n     all heretics, Protestants and Masons, as I am directed to do, to\r\n     extirpate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will\r\n     spare neither age, sex or condition, and that I will hang, burn,\r\n     waste, boil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics;\r\n     rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women, and crash their\r\n     infants' heads against the walls in order to annihilate their\r\n     execrable race.

Bonniwell against Thos. S. Butler,\" as appears in the\r\n     Congressional Record ---- house, Feb. 15, 1913, at pages 3215, etc.,\r\n     and ordered printed therein \"by unanimous consent.\" Attached thereto\r\n     and printed (on page 3216) as a part of said report as above.)\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was engaged in the work as Kleagle of the \"Invisible Empire,\" I\r\nwas given copies of this \"oath\" by four travelling men who had previously\r\nidentified themselves to me as Klansmen, and was informed that it had been\r\nand was being widely circulated, not only in their home towns, but all\r\nthrough the South by workers in the Ku Klux cause. I had not previously\r\nseen this oath, and without investigating its authenticity permitted it to\r\nbe reprinted and circulated in my territory, although the men who became\r\nmembers of the Klan under me did not attach any genuineness to the\r\ndocument. There was, therefore, but comparatively little use made of it in\r\nmy territory, but I learned that in Knoxville and Chattanooga it was\r\nfreely and industriously circulated. Among the ignorant classes of people,\r\nI learned, the oath was accepted as genuine, and was the means of securing\r\na large number of members for Ku Kluxism. In Chattanooga, in May, 1921,\r\nthe convention of the Southern Baptists was held, and as a great many\r\nspeeches were made against Romanism, the public mind was in a very\r\nresponsive mood to accept the alleged oath as the real obligation of the\r\nKnights of Columbus. I made inquiry of my King Kleagle as to whether or\r\nnot the Atlanta people were printing and distributing the \"oath.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to me from Chattanooga, dated May 25, 1921, the King\r\nKleagle, said:\r\n\r\n     \"The Imperial Palace does not get out copies of the K. C. oath but I\r\n     find it of value among a certain few.\r\n\r\n     \"I find papers like the _Protestant_ that I suggested your\r\n     subscribing for to be the most valuable dope that I can use for it\r\n     brings home in a concrete form to them the things we have to guard\r\n     against.\"\r\n\r\nHaving been, in a limited way, a party to the distribution of this oath, I\r\nfeel that it is my duty to print the result of my investigations as to its\r\nnature and also to give in full the real obligation of the Fourth Degree\r\nKnights of Columbus which was made public in the summer of 1921. It\r\nappears from my investigations that several times the authenticity of the\r\n\"oath\" has been brought into the courts by the Knights of Columbus, and\r\neach time it has been proven to be a fraud. An instance occurred, however,\r\nthat is so strongly convincing that every American who believes in fair\r\nplay, especially every Mason in the country, should know about it. In Los\r\nAngeles, California, in 1914, the State Deputy of the Knights of Columbus\r\nsubmitted the entire work, ceremonies and pledges of his order to a\r\ncommittee of Masons made up of Messrs. Motley Hewes Flint, thirty-third\r\ndegree, Past Grand Master of California, Dana Reid Weller, Past Grand\r\nMaster, William Rhodes Hewey, Past Master, and Samuel E. Burke, Inspector\r\nof the Los Angeles Masonic District. These gentlemen made a careful\r\nexamination of the entire subject, and rendered the following report:\r\n\r\n     \"We hereby certify that by authority of the highest officer of the\r\n     Knights of Columbus in the State of California, who acted under\r\n     instructions from the Supreme Officer of the Order in the United\r\n     States, we were furnished a complete copy of all the work, ceremonies\r\n     and pledges used by the Order, and that we carefully read, discussed\r\n     and examined the same. We found that while in a sense the Order is a\r\n     secret association, it is not an oath-bound organization and that its\r\n     ceremonies are comprised in four degrees, which are intended to teach\r\n     and inculcate principles that lie at the foundation of every great\r\n     religion and every free state. Our examination of these ceremonials\r\n     and obligations was made primarily for the purpose of ascertaining\r\n     whether or not a certain alleged oath of the Knights of Columbus,\r\n     which has been printed and widely circulated, was in fact used by the\r\n     Order and whether if it was not used, any oath, obligation or pledge\r\n     was used which was or would be offensive to Protestants or Masons, or\r\n     those who are engaged in circulating a document of peculiar\r\n     viciousness and wickedness. We find that neither the alleged oath nor\r\n     any oath or pledge bearing the remotest resemblance thereto in\r\n     matter, manner, spirit or purpose is used or forms a part of the\r\n     ceremonies of any degree of the Knights Of Columbus. The alleged oath\r\n     is scurrilous, wicked and libelous and must be the invention of an\r\n     impious and venomous mind. We find that the Order of Knights of\r\n     Columbus, as shown by its rituals, is dedicated to the Catholic\r\n     religion, charity and patriotism. There is no propaganda proposed or\r\n     taught against Protestants or Masons or persons not of Catholic\r\n     faith. Indeed, Protestants and Masons are not referred to directly or\r\n     indirectly in the ceremonials and pledges. The ceremonial of the\r\n     Order teaches a high and noble patriotism, instills a love of\r\n     country, inculcates a reverence for law and order, urges the\r\n     conscientious and unselfish performance of civic duty, and holds up\r\n     the Constitution of our country as the richest and most precious\r\n     possession of a Knight of the Order. We can find nothing in the\r\n     entire ceremonial of the Order that to our minds could be objected to\r\n     by any person.\"\r\n\r\nThe real oath or pledge of the Fourth Degree of the Knights of Columbus\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n     \"I swear to support the Constitution of the United States. I pledge\r\n     myself as a Catholic citizen and Knight of Columbus, to enlighten\r\n     myself fully upon my duties as a citizen and to conscientiously\r\n     perform such duties entirely in the interest of my country and\r\n     regardless of all personal consequences. I pledge myself to do all in\r\n     my power to preserve the integrity and purity of the ballot, and to\r\n     promote reverence and respect for law and order. I promise to\r\n     practice my religion openly and consistently but without ostentation,\r\n     and to so conduct myself in public affairs, and in the exercise of\r\n     public virtue as to reflect nothing but credit upon our Holy Church,\r\n     to the end that she may flourish and our country prosper to the\r\n     greater honor and Glory of God.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one pauses to examine into the history of the old Ku Klux Klan, and\r\nthe objects for which it was organized, it seems almost incredible that\r\nany organization claiming to be the \"genuine original Klan\" would stoop to\r\nbelittle the memory of the old Klan by making capital of religious\r\nprejudice. As will be shown further along in my narrative, there were\r\nabsolutely no restrictions in the old Klan as to religious belief, the\r\nPrecept clearly setting forth the qualifications for membership. Nothing\r\nwhatever was said about a Jew, a Catholic or a person who happened to be\r\nborn in a foreign country. While I was working in Johnson City, I took\r\ninto the organization an old gentleman who had been a member of the\r\noriginal Klan at Morristown. There is a rule that \"original Klansmen\" are\r\nnot required to make any \"donations\" or pay any dues. When this old\r\nex-Confederate soldier was taken in, it was at the end of my career as\r\nKleagle, and as I swore him to the un-American obligation, I could not\r\nhelp feeling ashamed and disgusted. I had several conversations with him\r\nafterwards, and asked him specifically as to the regulations of the old\r\nKlan in reference to members. He stated positively that there were no\r\nrules whatever prohibiting Catholics and Jews from becoming Klansmen, and\r\nthat one of the best men in his Den was a German who had been born in\r\nGermany. On account of the fact that he had associated intimately with\r\nJewish and Catholic Confederate soldiers, the old gentleman expressed\r\nhimself as being amazed that, in an attempt to revive the Klan, any such\r\ndiscrimination should be practiced.\r\n\r\nI received a number of copies of the _Protestant_, for which the King\r\nKleagle McArthur, advised me to subscribe because, he wrote, \"It brings\r\nhome in concrete form to them the things we have to guard against.\" This\r\npaper is published in Washington, D. C., and is of the usual type of\r\nrabidly anti-Catholic publication. An examination of some of its headlines\r\nshows the character of its attacks. This paper was eagerly read by Ku\r\nKluxes wherever it circulated and was indeed a valuable agency in securing\r\nrecruits.\r\n\r\nI also heard other Kleagles attack Catholicism, most of the attacks\r\nappealing to me as being ridiculous, one especially which stated that the\r\nCatholic Church was financially backing the National Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Colored Peoples. It was gravely stated that the Catholics\r\nwere arming the negroes of the South and that at the \"right time\" would\r\njoin in an armed uprising to seize the country.\r\n\r\nConsiderable anti-Catholic propaganda has been and is being published in\r\nthe columns of the _Searchlight_ the official organ of the Ku Klux Klan.\r\nAmong the statements I have seen was an intimation that the Catholic\r\nChurch was responsible for the murder of President Abraham Lincoln. Copies\r\nof the _Searchlight_ are sent to each Kleagle for distribution among his\r\nKlans, and I received a number of copies in my connection with the\r\norganization. In every town there is a Klansman, either paid for his\r\nservices or who renders same gratuitously, who makes a speciality of\r\ngetting subscribers for the _Searchlight_ and of placing the publication\r\non the news stands.\r\n\r\nIn the issue of August 6, 1921, the _Searchlight_ printed on its first\r\npage an article by Rev. Caleb A. Ridley, a Baptist preacher of Atlanta,\r\npart of which stated:\r\n\r\n     \"Some people seem to think that the Ku Klux Klan is a body of men who\r\n     have banded together simply to oppose certain things they do not\r\n     like--that they are anti-Jew, anti-Catholic, anti-negro,\r\n     anti-foreign, anti-everything. But real Klansmen have no fight to\r\n     make on any of these. I can't help being what I am racially. I am not\r\n     a Jew, nor a negro, nor a foreigner. I am an Anglo-Saxon white man,\r\n     so ordained by the hand and will of God, and so constituted and\r\n     trained that I cannot conscientiously take either my politics or\r\n     religion from some secluded ass on the other side of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, if somebody else is a Jew, I can't help it any more than he\r\n     can. Or, if he happens to be black, I can't help that either. If he\r\n     were born under some foreign flag, I couldn't help it, and if he\r\n     wants to go clear back to Italy for his religion and his politics, I\r\n     cannot hinder him; but there is one thing I can do. I can object to\r\n     his un-American propaganda being preached in my home or practiced in\r\n     the solemn assembly of real Americans.\"\r\n\r\nThe propaganda against the Jew is being carried on as viciously as against\r\nthe Catholic. In the _Searchlight_ of July 30, 1921, there appeared on the\r\nfront page a typical anti-Semitic article in the nature of a letter\r\nwritten from New York, and signed \"American,\" of which the following is an\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n     \"The Jew is interested in creating war between blacks and whites, not\r\n     to benefit the negro, but to destroy our government. For the same\r\n     reason, the Jew is interested in overthrowing Christian Russia. But\r\n     remember, he does not intend to stop at Russia. Through his Third\r\n     Internationale of Moscow he is working to overthrow all the Gentile\r\n     governments of the world. I am enclosing an editorial clipped from\r\n     the _New York World_ of Saturday, July 23. You will keep in mind that\r\n     the _World_ is Jew-owned (as is also every newspaper in New York City\r\n     except the _Tribune_).\r\n\r\n     \"My investigation proved to me beyond a doubt that the negro\r\n     situation is being made increasingly dangerous by Jewish agitators.\r\n\r\n     \"In all my twenty-five years travelling over this continent, I have\r\n     never met a disloyal American who failed to be either foreign born or\r\n     a Semite.\r\n\r\n     \"With the best wishes for the success of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL KU KLUX KLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe destiny of the United States, like the destiny of the individual, lies\r\nnot in dwelling upon the unpleasant things of the past but in a sane and\r\ncorrect solution of the problems of the present and of the future. We are\r\nall Americans; we live amid conditions that demand national unity and\r\nnational sanity; and our principal thought should be the elimination of\r\nsectional discord and internal dissension. Experience has shown me that\r\nthere is but little basic difference between average Americans, no matter\r\nin what part of the country they may have been born and reared. Aside from\r\nlocal customs, variations of accent, and minor provincialisms, the man\r\nfrom Tennessee is no different from the man from Massachusetts, and the\r\nman from New Jersey is a brother \"under his skin\" to the \"native son\" of\r\nthe Golden West. To remove the causes of friction, to eliminate sectional\r\nand class hatred, and to inculcate the principles of unified Americanism\r\namong people of diversified interests are the real ideals of this\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nBelieving, therefore, that constant dwelling upon the evil of the past is\r\nunhealthful, both to the individual and to the nation, it is neither my\r\nintention nor purpose, in discussing the historical side of the original\r\nKu Klux Klan to give vent to the passions and prejudices of the South of\r\nthe days immediately following the Civil War. In dealing with it, I am\r\nmerely narrating facts as set forth by men recognized as authorities of\r\nAmerican history, and these facts can, if need be, be verified by the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIt is a part of the tragedy of war that its termination is followed by a\r\nperiod of painful reconstruction. Every war ever fought in the world's\r\nhistory has had its inevitable aftermath of readjustment--the return from\r\nthe abnormal to the normal. In some instances this has been so\r\nimperceptible as to entail but little hardship upon the people who have\r\nsuffered the terrible effects of armed conflict; in others, the harshness\r\nof the conqueror to the conquered and the brutality of the victor toward\r\nthe vanquished have left traces of hatred and lust for vengeance that have\r\nsurvived for generations.\r\n\r\nIn the study of the history of the Anglo-Saxon race, there are two\r\nreconstruction periods that stand out in marked contrast. One was the\r\nreconstruction of the Southern States following the Civil War, and the\r\nother was the reconstruction of South Africa by the British government\r\nimmediately after the Boer War. The former was handled in a stupid,\r\nignorant, and insane manner, and based upon the lust of spoils and upon\r\nthe most wretched of partisan politics. The latter was disposed of in a\r\nwise, sane, and statesmanly fashion, with impartial consideration for the\r\nwelfare of the British Empire and the peace and good will of the Boers.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the Southern States following the Civil War was\r\nutterly stupid, and Americans of our generation--regardless of Northern or\r\nSouthern birth--so consider it, and know that the manner in which the\r\nsituation was handed was a political mistake.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the \"carpetbaggers\" and their negro allies after the\r\nCivil War were not confined merely to the looting of the public\r\ntreasuries. Vicious white men organized the negroes into societies and\r\nstirred up their hatred against the white people, with the result that\r\nunspeakable crimes were committed in all parts of the South. Perhaps the\r\nmost notorious of these organizations was that known as the \"Loyal\r\nLeague,\" which operated in all parts of the South, and which was composed\r\nof negroes and low white men.\r\n\r\nI quote from Mr. Wilson's work, the following clear and well-worded\r\nsummary:\r\n\r\n     \"The price of the policy to which it gave the final touch of\r\n     permanence was the temporary disintegration of Southern society and\r\n     the utter, apparently the irretrievable alienation of the South from\r\n     the political party whose mastery it had been Mr. Stevens' chief aim\r\n     to perpetuate. The white men of the South were aroused by the mere\r\n     instinct of self-preservation to rid themselves, by fair means or\r\n     foul, of the intolerable burden of governments sustained by the votes\r\n     of ignorant negroes and conducted in the interest of adventurers:\r\n     governments whose incredible debts were incurred that thieves might\r\n     be enriched, whose increasing loans and taxes went to no public use\r\n     but into the pockets of party managers and corrupt contractors. There\r\n     was no place of open action or of constitutional agitation, under the\r\n     terms of reconstruction, for the men who were the real leaders of the\r\n     Southern communities. The restrictions shut white men of the older\r\n     order out from the suffrage even. They could act only by private\r\n     combination, by private means, as a force outside the government,\r\n     hostile to it, prescribed by it, of whom opposition and bitter\r\n     resistance was expected, and expected with defiance.... But there\r\n     were men to whom counsels of prudence seemed as ineffectual as they\r\n     were unpalatable, men who could not sit still and suffer what was now\r\n     put upon them.... They took the law into their own hands and began to\r\n     attempt by intimidation what they were not allowed to attempt by the\r\n     ballot or by any course of public action.\"\r\n\r\nThe agency by which the South was saved from the devilish scheme of\r\nThaddeus Stevens to Africanize it and convert it into a mongrel, half-bred\r\nsection was the original Ku Klux Klan! Brought into being by chance, and\r\nused as an agency to meet the exigency of the hour, it served its purpose\r\nas many similar systems have served theirs, including the Western\r\nvigilantes, whose work has been commended by Theodore Roosevelt on the\r\nground of public necessity. Then having restored the South to the control\r\nof its better element, it passed away, to occupy a cherished place in the\r\nhistory of the Southern States, from which it can never be resurrected.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Ku Kluxism existed in the Southern States from the year 1866\r\nuntil President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew the Federal troops from the\r\nSouth, during which period a number of its phases present themselves for\r\nstudy and investigation. In some of these, if one accepts the opinions of\r\nradical members of Congress from the Northern States, the whole system was\r\nnothing but evil; while if the extremely radical Southern viewpoint is\r\naccepted, the Ku Klux movement was as spotless as a lily and was\r\nresponsible for no acts of lawlessness whatever. Somewhere between the\r\nextreme Northern condemnation and the extreme Southern justification lies\r\nthe truth. In any case the Ku Klux movement was the exercise of\r\nextra-legal force for the purpose of meeting a revolutionary condition of\r\nsociety in a revolutionary manner. In the sense that it had no standing in\r\nlaw and took upon itself to enforce what its leaders saw fit to declare\r\nwas the law, it was an outlaw organization. Taken by itself, in the light\r\nof our present system of government and law enforcement, it has nothing on\r\nwhich to stand; but, studied in the light of the reconstruction period, it\r\nis shown to have been the last desperate resort of the Anglo-Saxon to\r\nresist and overthrow the attempt to Africanize his country.\r\n\r\nThe movement was a revolution to meet a situation unparalled in this\r\ncountry's history, and the history of revolutions has never at any time\r\nmanifested the character of pink teas or church socials. Personally I\r\nprefer to adopt the point of view that in a chaotic and despotic condition\r\nof society like the one forced upon the Southern people, the end justified\r\nthe means, and would place the entire responsibility of what happened in\r\nthe South upon the shoulders of Thaddeus Stevens and other radical leaders\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nA careful investigation of the history of the original movement shows that\r\nit was divided into three separate and distinct periods. It was first\r\norganized as a secret society for the amusement of its members, without\r\nany serious attempt to act as a \"regulator\" of social and political\r\naffairs; it was then transformed into a great political-military movement,\r\nenforced law and order, drove the negro and the carpetbagger out of\r\npolitics, and was then ordered disbanded; and lastly it attempted in\r\nunorganized fashion, without the authority of its former leaders, to rule\r\nmany communities, and an enormous number of acts of violence were\r\ncommitted either by it or in its name.\r\n\r\nThere were several different organizations which sprang into existence in\r\nthe South during the reconstruction periods, each one operating along the\r\nsame general lines but bearing different names. There were the Ku Klux\r\nKlan, the White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, the Constitutional Union\r\nGuards, and the Knights of the White Camelia, which was larger than any\r\nof them. In the latter days of the reconstruction, when acts of\r\nlawlessness in the South were so bad that an investigation was held by\r\nCongress, the general name of Ku Klux was applied to all extra-legal\r\nSouthern movements. As this narrative deals only with the Ku Klux Klan, a\r\ndiscussion of the other movements is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe Ku Klux Klan was organized in Pulaski, Tenn., in May, 1866. Several\r\nyoung men who had served in the Confederate Army, having returned to their\r\nhomes, found themselves suffering from the inactivity and reaction that\r\nfollowed army life. There was nothing to do in which to relieve it. There\r\nwas but little work to do, and but few had capital to engage in new\r\nmercantile or professional pursuits. The amusements and diversions of\r\nnormal society were lacking, and to meet this situation, it was decided to\r\nform a secret society merely for the purpose of burlesque and fun-making.\r\nAfter the society was organized, and a name was sought, one of the members\r\nsuggested the word \"_kukloi_\" from the Greek word \"_Kuklos_\" meaning\r\ncircle. Another member then suggested: \"Call it 'Ku Klux,'\" and this\r\nsuggestion was at once adopted, with the addition of the word Klan.\r\n\r\nThe new society was a success from the start. The \"joiner\" of 1866 was no\r\ndifferent from the \"joiner\" of 1921. The boys made the organization one of\r\ndeep mystery; they adopted grotesque and hideous costumes which they wore\r\nto and from their places of initiation; they gave out hints of the wonders\r\nof the new society, which played on the curiosity of the public; and they\r\nhad mysterious communications printed in the local newspapers. The members\r\nwere required to maintain profound and absolute secrecy with reference to\r\neverything connected with the order, and went at their work with great\r\nglee, to the added mystification of the community. The result was that\r\neverybody in the city of Pulaski and all throughout the surrounding\r\ncountry, became possessed of the \"joiner's itch\" and sought admission. No\r\napplications were solicited for membership, because the organizers knew\r\nhuman nature well enough to know that if they gave out the impression that\r\nthey wished to be exclusive the applications would be both voluntary and\r\nnumerous. The organization grew very rapidly, and strangers coming to\r\nTennessee from other Southern States learned of it, became members, and\r\nsecured permission to start local organizations. By the fall and winter of\r\n1866 the order had grown all over the South, and in nearly every community\r\nthere was a \"Den\" of Ku Kluxes enjoying the baffled curiosity and wild\r\nspeculations of a mystified public.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1867, the Reconstruction Acts were passed by Congress, and in\r\nthe month of April the actual work of reconstruction began. Then it was\r\nthat the Ku Klux Klan underwent its second stage of development and\r\nbecame transformed into a band of regulators to handle the alarming\r\nsituation that immediately followed. Perhaps the best available authority\r\non the Klan in the country today is a little book written by Capt. John C.\r\nLester and Rev. D. L. Wilson, giving an insight into its organization and\r\nreal history. Captain Lester was one of the six original organizers, and\r\nMr. Wilson, while not a member, was a resident of Pulaski and was closely\r\nin touch with the entire movement. In this work they stated that the\r\ntransformation of the society was effected in three ways:\r\n\r\n(1) The impressions made by the order upon those who joined it; (2) the\r\nimpressions made upon the public by it; (3) the anomalous and peculiar\r\ncondition of affairs in the South at the time. The impression made upon\r\nthe man who joined was that behind all the amusement features of the\r\norganization and, unexpressed in its ritualistic work, was a deep\r\npurpose--a solemn mission that would be undertaken later. What it was none\r\nknew, but the feeling existed that a mission existed, just the same. The\r\nimpressions made upon the public immediately showed the Klansmen that the\r\norganization possessed a certain power that nobody had imagined it would\r\npossess. This power was largely one of fright and intimidation, and was\r\nshown in the case of the ignorant and superstitious negro more than in\r\nthat of the white people. Negroes would see the ghostly nocturnal Ku\r\nKluxes and imagine that they were spirits of deceased Confederate\r\nsoldiers, and the Klansmen were very quick to grasp the idea and use it to\r\nthe fullest advantage. In some cases a figure in white would ride up to a\r\nnegro's house, dismount and ask for a drink of water. The frightened negro\r\nwould hand him a gourd, which the rider would pour into a rubber bag,\r\nconcealed under his robe, and then demand a whole bucketful of water,\r\nwhich he would dispose of in the same way, remarking, \"That was the first\r\ndrink of water I have had since I was killed at Shiloh.\" In other cases\r\nthe Ku Klux members would wear false heads, ride up to a negro and,\r\nremoving the head, ask the negro to hold it. Skeleton hands would be\r\nfastened to the wrist and held out for a handshake, which procedure\r\nusually caused the terrified negro to make a hasty retreat. With the\r\nsuperstition and natural tendency of their race to magnify happenings, the\r\nnegroes soon spread alarming tales among themselves as to the Ku Klux and\r\nits doings, until presently the name was one that invoked horror and\r\nterror. It is but natural, therefore, that knowing this new power of\r\nfrightening the negro, the members of the strange order exercised it to\r\nthe fullest extent.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1867, in order to form a strong sectional organization, a\r\nconvention was secretly held at Nashville, Tenn., and the Prescript of the\r\norder was revised and amended by delegates from all of the States. Plans\r\nwere made for extensive work, and for propagating the order in every\r\ncommunity in the South. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest, having previously heard of\r\nthe organization made a careful investigation of it, and consented to\r\nbecome its head, assuming the office of Grand Wizard immediately after the\r\nNashville Convention. He had been one of the South's most successful and\r\ndistinguished cavalry officers, was recognized as being able to handle men\r\nin a masterful manner, and was a person of coolness and clear-headed\r\njudgment. He at once set to work to reorganize the order, which had become\r\nmore or less demoralized under loose management, and made it a real factor\r\nin handling the serious situation which grew more serious as the\r\nreconstruction proceeded. He brought the membership in Tennessee up to\r\n40,000 and the total membership in the South to 550,000, and did all he\r\ncould to keep the force in strong control.\r\n\r\nA great many of the most prominent men in the South became members of the\r\norganization, and were either active in the work or served in an advisory\r\ncapacity. Among them were Generals John B. Gordon, A. H. Colquitt, G. T.\r\nAnderson and A. R. Lawton, of Georgia, Gen. W. J. Hardee, Gen. John C.\r\nBrown, Capt. John W. Morton, Gen. George W. Gordon, and Gen. Albert Pike,\r\nwho later became one of the foremost Masonic authorities in the country.\r\nGen. Pike was the chief judicial officer of the Klan.\r\n\r\nAmong the first policies inaugurated by General Forrest was the courting\r\nof widespread publicity, and an order was issued for a parade in full\r\nregalia on July 4, 1867. In every Southern city parades of the Ku Klux\r\nKlans were held, and served to act as an advertisement to the people of\r\nthe South that they were being protected, and to serve notice on the\r\ncarpetbagger and the negro that a new force had arisen for the purpose of\r\nmeeting their encroachments upon the liberties of the white people.\r\n\r\nThen began the reign of the mysterious organization that ended in the\r\nvarious restorations of the State government to the white people of the\r\nSouth, most of which occurred in 1870, the last States to throw off the\r\nyoke being South Carolina and Louisiana. What occurred during that time in\r\nthe way of actual events is but vaguely stated.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the whole period was one of the bitterest of partisan\r\npolitics makes it necessary to discount to a large degree the statements\r\nof both sides of the controversy. It has been told by some that the\r\noriginal Ku Klux Klan enforced its decrees and maintained law and order,\r\nnot so much by the overt acts it committed but by reason of the vague fear\r\nand surmises on the part of the negro and carpetbagger as to what the Klan\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\nIn an address before the Bar Association of Texas in 1906, Hon. Thomas W.\r\nGregory, later Attorney-General of the United States, gave a history of\r\nthe old Klan, and in speaking of its work said:\r\n\r\n     \"It is safe to say that ninety per cent of the work of the Klan\r\n     involved no act of personal violence. In most instances mere\r\n     knowledge of the fact that the Ku Klux were organized in the\r\n     community and patrolled it by night accomplished most that was\r\n     desired. In the case of nocturnal meetings of the negroes, organized\r\n     by scalawags and carpetbaggers, which proved disorderly and\r\n     offensive, sheeted horsemen would be found drawn up across every road\r\n     leading from the meeting place; and although not a word was spoken\r\n     and no violence whatever offered, that meeting was usually adjourned\r\n     _sine die_.... But masked riders and mystery were not the only Ku\r\n     Klux devices. Carpetbaggers and scalawags and their families were\r\n     ostracized in all walks of life--in the church, in the school, in\r\n     business, wherever men and women or even children gathered together,\r\n     no matter what the purpose or the place, the alien and the renegade,\r\n     and all that belonged or pertained to them were refused recognition\r\n     and consigned to outer darkness and the companionship of negroes.\r\n\r\n     \"In addition to these methods, there were some of a much more drastic\r\n     nature. The sheeted horseman did not merely warn and intimidate,\r\n     especially when the warnings were not heeded. In many instances\r\n     negroes and carpetbaggers were whipped and in rare instances shot or\r\n     hanged. Notice to leave the country was frequently extended and\r\n     rarely declined, and if declined the results were likely to be\r\n     serious. Hanging was promptly administered to the house burner and\r\n     sometimes to the murderer; the defamer of women of good character was\r\n     usually whipped and sometimes executed if the offense was repeated;\r\n     threats of violence and oppression of the weak and defenseless if\r\n     persisted in after due warning met with drastic and sometimes cruel\r\n     remedies; mere corruption in public office was too universal for\r\n     punishment or even comment, but he who prostituted official power to\r\n     oppress the individual, a crime prevalent from one end of the country\r\n     to the other, especially in cases where it affected the widow and\r\n     orphan, was likely to be dealt with in no gentle way, in case a\r\n     warning was not promptly observed; those who advocated and practiced\r\n     social equality of the races and incited hostility of the blacks\r\n     against the whites were given a single notice to depart in haste, and\r\n     they rarely took time to reply.\"\r\n\r\nWhether one looks upon the methods of the Ku Klux Klan as wise and humane\r\nor as rough and cruel, the fact remains that its work was accomplished,\r\nand state governments under carpetbag control, negro militia, acts of\r\nCongress and proclamations of the President though backed by the army of\r\nthe United States, made but little headway against the silent force of\r\nwhite men which was making a last desperate stand for all they held\r\nsacred.\r\n\r\nLester and Wilson in commenting on the work of the Klan, even before it\r\nwas transformed into a movement of regulators say:\r\n\r\n     \"The order contained within itself, by reason of the methods\r\n     practiced, sources of weakness. The devices and disguises by which\r\n     the Klan deceived outsiders enabled all who were so disposed, to\r\n     practice deception on the Klan itself. It placed in the hands of its\r\n     own members the facility to do deeds of violence for the\r\n     gratification of personal feeling, and have them credited to the\r\n     Klan. To evilly disposed men membership in the Klan was an inducement\r\n     to wrongdoing. It presented to all men a dangerous temptation, which,\r\n     in certain contingencies at any time likely to arise, it required a\r\n     considerable amount of moral robustness to resist. Many did not\r\n     withstand it. Up to this time, the majority had shown a fair\r\n     appreciation of the responsibilities of their self-imposed task of\r\n     preserving social order. But under any circumstances the natural\r\n     tendency of an organization such as this is to violence and\r\n     crime--much more under such circumstances as those then prevailing.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1868, Governor Brownlow of Tennessee called the legislature\r\ninto session, and caused a drastic act to be passed comparable only to the\r\nReconstruction Acts of Congress. Under its terms association or connection\r\nwith the Ku Klux Klan was punishable by a fine of $500 and imprisonment in\r\nthe penitentiary for not less than five years. Any inhabitant of the State\r\nwas constituted an officer possessing power to arrest without process any\r\none known to be or suspected of being a member of the organization; and to\r\nfeed, lodge or conceal a member was made a criminal offense punishable by\r\nfine and imprisonment, and informers were allowed one-half the fine. In\r\nspite of this drastic law, the Klan continued to actively operate in\r\nTennessee for over six months.\r\n\r\nPartly because of this law, and partly because of the fact that in many\r\ncases some of the \"Dens\" had gone beyond their instructions in coping with\r\nthe situation, and were showing a tendency to get beyond the control of\r\nthe men who were trying to conduct the movement honestly, but principally\r\nbecause the purpose of its regulation work had been accomplished and there\r\nremained no reason for its existence, General Forrest, in the latter part\r\nof February, 1869, issued a proclamation as Grand Wizard declaring the Ku\r\nKlux Klan dissolved and disbanded.\r\n\r\nThe substance of his order is included in his summary which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"The Invisible Empire has accomplished the purpose for which it was\r\n     organized. Civil law now affords ample protection to life, liberty\r\n     and property; robbery and lawlessness are no longer unrebuked; the\r\n     better elements of society are no longer in dread for the safety of\r\n     their property, their persons, and their families. The Grand Wizard,\r\n     being invested with power to determine questions of paramount\r\n     importance, in the exercise of the power so conferred, now declares\r\n     the Invisible Empire and all the subdivisions thereof dissolved and\r\n     disbanded forever.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the second period of Ku Kluxism in the South. A large number of\r\n\"Dens,\" however, paid no attention to the order of General Forrest, but\r\ncontinued to act independently, and kept up their work until the late\r\nseventies. The \"Pale Faces,\" the \"Constitutional Union Guards,\" the \"White\r\nBrotherhood,\" \"White League,\" and the \"Knights of the White Camelia\" were\r\nalso kept up for several years after the organization of the Ku Klux Klan\r\nwas officially abandoned, it being very likely that many of the Klan units\r\njoined in with these movements. It is generally understood that the work\r\ndone by these organizations, and by the irresponsible people who still\r\nused the name of the old Klan, was more reckless and violent in its\r\ncharacter and was the cause of more bloodshed than the original movement.\r\nAt any rate there was less justification for the movement after 1870 than\r\nin the first years of the reconstruction.\r\n\r\nKu Kluxism occupied a great deal of attention of Congress in 1870, 1871\r\nand in 1872, the President issued proclamations against it backed by the\r\narmy, committees were sent by Congress to visit every section of the\r\nSouth, volumes of testimony were taken, hundreds of speeches were made, in\r\nsome instances martial law was declared, and a drastic act was passed by\r\nCongress intended to check the movement. It went on, however, until the\r\nFederal troops were withdrawn, the carpetbaggers left the country, and all\r\nof the State governments were in the control of the white men of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory in summing up the whole Ku Klux movement said:\r\n\r\n     \"Did the end aimed at and accomplished by the Ku Klux Klan justify\r\n     the movement? The opinion of the writer is that the movement was\r\n     fully justified, though he of course does not approve of the crimes\r\n     and excesses incident to it.\r\n\r\n     \"The abuses under which the American colonies of England revolted in\r\n     1776 were mere child's play compared to those borne by the South\r\n     during the period of reconstruction, and the success of the later\r\n     movement as a justification of a last resort to revolutionary methods\r\n     was as pronounced as that of the former.\r\n\r\n     \"The Ku Klux machine has been stored away in the Battle Abbey of the\r\n     nation as obsolete, we trust, as the causes which produced it; it\r\n     will stand there for all time as a reminder of how useless is the\r\n     prostitution of forms of law in an effort to do that which is\r\n     essentially unlawful, but it will also remain an eternal suggestion\r\n     to the vigilance committee and the regulator.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PRESCRIPT OF THE OLD KLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the study of the original Ku Klux Klan, it is fortunate that there have\r\nbeen preserved documents which fully set forth its structure and\r\ncomposition, and these documents demonstrate conclusively that the modern\r\norganization has no claim whatever to recognition as the \"genuine original\r\nKu Klux.\" The most important of these documents is the \"prescript\" or\r\nconstitution of the old Klan.\r\n\r\nIn its early stages, the old organization adopted a \"Prescript,\" but this\r\nwas in 1867 revised and amended, and the second document became the law of\r\nthe organization, under which it functioned until it was disbanded. When\r\nGeneral Forrest issued his order disbanding the Ku Klux Klan, all copies\r\nof the revised and amended prescript were ordered destroyed. One copy\r\nescaped destruction and is now in the library of Columbia University where\r\nit is carefully preserved as a valuable historic paper. As an exhibit in\r\nthe case against the present organization, I give the \"Prescript\" in full.\r\nIt is a booklet of twenty-four pages, and at the top of each page is a\r\nLatin quotation. Without attempting to follow the typography of the\r\noriginal text, I am reproducing it as a continuous document, placing the\r\nquotations where they appear in the booklet, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"PRESCRIPT\"\r\n\r\n  Exact copy of the Revised and Amended\r\n  Prescript\r\n  of the\r\n  ORDER\r\n  of the\r\n    *\r\n  *   *\r\n\r\n  \"_Damnant quod intelligent_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"APPELLATION\"\r\n\r\nThis organization shall by styled and denominated, The Order of * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CREED\"\r\n\r\n\"We, the Order of the * * *, reverentially acknowledge the majesty and\r\nsupremacy of the Divine Being, and recognize the goodness and providence\r\nof the same.

The first\r\nsection indicated half of the hours in the day, the second section the\r\ndays of the week, and the third section the remaining twelve hours. The\r\nword \"Cumberland\" seems to have been a general code expression.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF OLD AND NEW KLANS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving briefly sketched the causes which led up to the organization of the\r\noriginal Ku Klux Klan, and to some extent the actual work accomplished by\r\nthat Order, and having shown in detail the rules and regulations governing\r\nit in the form of its \"Revised and Amended Prescript,\" we can easily see\r\nby a comparison of the old and new organizations that the claim of the\r\nlatter that it is \"the genuine and original Klan\" is a historical fraud.\r\nThe modern system, while appropriating to itself the name, regalia, and\r\nsome of the nomenclature of the original Klan, is different in conception,\r\norganization and purpose.\r\n\r\nIn certain respects the character of the two organizations is about the\r\nsame. General Forrest when called before a Congressional investigating\r\ncommittee in 1872, stated that the Ku Klux Klan was a political-military\r\norganization with branches in every voting place in the South, and that,\r\nin addition to its work as a regulator of the peace, it was also engaged\r\nin the task of fighting the Republican Party at the polls. The modern\r\norganization states in its secret constitution that it is a military\r\norganization, and a study of its oath and its literature as herein\r\npresented proves conclusively that it is also a political organization,\r\nwhich intends, when it develops the necessary strength, to drive from\r\npublic office in the United States every Jew, Catholic, and foreign-born\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nThe original Klan presents in its defense that it policed and enforced law\r\nin a badly demoralized country, brought order out of chaos, and protected\r\nthe widow and the orphan. The new Klan has at times given out a few\r\ncharities, largely for advertising purposes, and whenever this has been\r\ndone has sought as much publicity as possible from its work. It has\r\nannounced that it intends to protect the womanhood of the country, and one\r\nKlan in Texas has issued a warning that \"husbands must spend more time\r\nwith their own wives,\" without, however, consulting the wishes of either\r\nof the parties to ascertain if the same was agreeable. As far as has been\r\nprinted in the newspapers, however, the Klan in its eagerness to protect\r\nwomanhood has not discovered and punished the masked and white-robed\r\npeople who stripped Mrs. Beulah Brown of her clothing at Tenasha, Tex.,\r\nwhipped her and covered her body with tar and feathers.\r\n\r\nThe two organizations have something in common in the proven cases of\r\nviolence that have been reported in the public prints. According to the\r\nstatements of writers, who were members of the old Klan, there were men in\r\nthe organization who acted unwisely and selfishly, and who committed acts\r\nof violence that were impossible to control. Precisely the same situation\r\nhas already developed in the United States today and the \"Emperor\" of the\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" has had to discipline three of his chartered Klans for\r\nproven acts of lawlessness. There is another point of similarity in the\r\ntwo systems. The old Klan had hardly started its work of wearing disguises\r\nto regulate public affairs when there sprang up imitators who used similar\r\ndisguises to aid them in performing acts of viciousness and crime. These\r\nmen were not members of the Klan and did things that had neither the\r\nsanction nor approval of the Klan, yet their acts showed that the wearing\r\nof disguises by the old Klan tended to promote lawlessness and crime in\r\nothers. As will be shown later there has been, since the modern Klan was\r\norganized, an epidemic of crime in the South, usually committed by men\r\nwearing disguises. Whether these acts have actually been done by Klansmen\r\nor by imitators, it shows nevertheless that the admitted right of one\r\nclass to go about disguised puts the community at the mercy of any class\r\nthat chooses to employ similar tactics.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these resemblances, however, the difference between the old Ku\r\nKlux Klan and the new is appalling. One of the first questions that\r\npresents itself is, \"What is the necessity at the present time for such an\r\norganization?\" The student of American history--in view of the abnormal\r\npolitical situation in the Southern States during the Reconstruction\r\nPeriod--can readily understand how and why such an organization should\r\nhave come into existence, and its justification lies solely in the\r\nnecessity of some agency to cope with the social upheaval of that time.\r\nPublic opinion in America today, as reflected by the editorial comments of\r\na vast majority of the leading newspapers, is practically unanimous in the\r\nview that there is absolutely nothing in our present system of government\r\nthat would justify the existence of any kind of extra-legal Ku Klux\r\norganization. Every state in the Union has a constitution which provides\r\nfor the creation and maintenance of legislative, judicial, and executive\r\nbranches, and in every State these branches are performing their regularly\r\nconstituted functions. None of them is perfect; none of them ever will be.\r\nAt the same time, the machinery is there, is being handled well, and there\r\nare but few complaints against non-enforcement of the law, except in some\r\nSouthern States where men are going about in disguise terrorizing the\r\ncommunity. The Southern States are every one governed by white men. White\r\nmen make their laws; white men enforce their laws; and white men sit upon\r\nthe bench and interpret their laws. There is no danger in the South of a\r\nrepetition of the scenes of the Reconstruction, and no danger whatever of\r\nthe \"White Supremacy\" of the South being destroyed or set aside unless\r\nthe same is done by white men, who, under the false pretense of \"pure\r\nAmericanism,\" seek to array white men against white men by the stirring up\r\nof religious and racial hatred and prejudice. Where then, is the necessity\r\neither in the South or anywhere else in America for this modern Ku Klux\r\nmonstrosity? From a standpoint of necessity, neither the facts of history\r\nnor modern conditions offer the remotest excuse for its existence.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the comparison of the _organization_ of the old Klan and\r\nthe new which refutes absolutely the claim of the latter to any\r\n\"genuineness\" whatever. The \"Prescript\" of the old Klan reads: \"The Grand\r\nWizard shall be elected biennially by the Grand Dragons of Realms.\" In the\r\nsecret constitution of the new Klan it is provided that the Imperial\r\nWizard shall hold his office for life, and can only be removed by the\r\n_unanimous_ vote of his hand-picked Imperial Kloncilium.\r\n\r\nAnother important and interesting comparison is that of the personalities\r\nof the two heads of the organizations. When the convention was held at\r\nNashville, Tenn., in 1867, for the purpose of choosing a Grand Wizard, it\r\nselected Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, one of the most distinguished and\r\ncapable officers in the late Confederate army, and recognized today among\r\nmilitary students as one of the foremost cavalry leaders of all times.\r\nGeneral Forrest was selected for his ability, his integrity, his\r\nunselfish devotion to the Southern people, and his desire to aid them in a\r\ngreat crisis. A careful search of every available record fails to reveal\r\nthat he ever received one penny as compensation for his labors, or that\r\nhis office as Grand Wizard ever brought him any gifts, perquisites, or\r\nemoluments. His military title was unimpeached, his last commission being\r\nthat of lieutenant-general. He never called himself \"Emperor,\" never\r\nsigned any of his official orders as \"His Majesty,\" and never assumed any\r\nof the titles or styles of royalty. He was a plain, unassuming soldier and\r\ngentleman, who, having a great task to perform, did his work gratuitously\r\nand from motives of patriotism only, and then, the work having been\r\ncompleted, disbanded his organization and retired.\r\n\r\nWhat a marked contrast to the gallant Forrest is \"Colonel\" (?) William\r\nJoseph Simmons, Imperial Wizard, \"Emperor\" of the \"Invisible Empire,\"\r\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. I can find no record of any military\r\nservice that gives him privilege to use the honorable title of \"Colonel,\"\r\na title that has been won by American soldiers by virtue of hard service\r\nin the army and by desperate deeds of valor on the field of battle. Where\r\nthen did \"His Majesty\" get the right to use this military title? According\r\nto the _Literary Digest_, \"his friends bestowed it upon him.\"\r\n\r\nForrest, as far as can be ascertained, served his country for patriotism;\r\n\"Emperor\" Simmons, on the other hand, is promoting the cause of \"pure\r\nAmericanism\" for cash. Prior to his elevation to the responsible position\r\nof \"Emperor\" of the whole United States he was, among other activities, a\r\nprofessor of history at Lanier College in the good state of Georgia. He is\r\nalso said to have been a Methodist exhorter earlier in his career. So far\r\nas the general public is informed, the remuneration of professors in our\r\ncolleges and universities, even the greatest, is not particularly high. As\r\nLanier College is a small institution that has had to struggle along in\r\nthe face of more or less poor circumstances, it is not unreasonable to\r\nsuppose that it is no exception to the general rule. In August, 1921, the\r\nnewspapers reported that it had been taken over by the Ku Klux Klan, and\r\nthat \"Emperor\" Simmons, \"in addition to his other duties\" would be its\r\nPresident. It is reasonably safe to say that the average income of \"His\r\nMajesty\" during his career as an educator could not have exceeded $2500 a\r\nyear. Behold, however, the great change that comes with elevation to the\r\nImperial Throne: \"Friends of 'Colonel(?)' Simmons,\" at the Klonklave of\r\nthe Klan which was held in Atlanta, in May, 1921, presented him with a\r\n$25,000 home on Peachtree Street--Atlanta's fashionable\r\nthoroughfare--together with handsome furniture.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this wonderful munificence of his \"friends\"--whoever they\r\nwere--he is also paid a salary, which according to the \"Emperor\" himself\r\nis $1000 a month, and recently his hand-picked Kloncilium voted him\r\n$25,000 back pay. This stipend is augmented by the fact that the secret\r\nconstitution provides that the \"Imperial Wizard\" shall also be the\r\n\"Supreme Kleagle,\" and that he shall be entitled to \"appropriate to\r\nhimself\" the entire ten-dollar \"donations\" paid by any members he may\r\nchoose to solicit. Since the ordinary garden variety of Kleagle, with only\r\nfour dollars \"rake-off,\" can make a very tidy sum by selling memberships,\r\nthe reader can draw his own conclusions as to the possible selling ability\r\nof the chief monarch. There is also the Gate City Manufacturing Company\r\nwith its enormous revenue from the sale of robes, the Searchlight\r\nPublishing Company, the Clarke Realty Company, and Lanier College, which\r\nare interlocking corporations or business concerns conducted by persons\r\nconnected with the Ku Klux Klan. Where the revenue derived from these\r\nenterprises goes has not been reported in the newspapers. The only thing\r\nmade public in connection with them was the statement that the \"Emperor\"\r\nhad been elected President of Lanier College. College presidents are\r\nusually paid salaries. When one thinks of the unpaid Forrest and the\r\ntrying problems he solved, one can scarcely suppress a feeling of disgust\r\nin the effrontery of this man of modern times, who declares that this \"is\r\nthe genuine original Klan,\" and that he is engaged in the work of \"pure\r\nAmericanism.\" Why, the man doesn't know what pure Americanism is!\r\n\r\nThe most important differentiation, however, between the old Ku Klux Klan\r\nand its spurious successor is the character of their membership. It will\r\nbe recalled upon a study of both systems that in each candidates were\r\nrequired to answer satisfactorily ten qualifying interrogatories before\r\nbeing finally accepted for membership. Let us compare these together.\r\n\r\n  ORIGINAL KLAN                    MODERN KLAN\r\n\r\n  \"1. Have you ever been           \"1.

Nowhere in the\r\n\"Prescript\" of the original Klan, or in any printed publication relating\r\nto it, can there be discovered any restriction whatever against the Jew,\r\nthe Catholic, or the foreign-born American citizen. On the contrary, old\r\nmen, who claim to have been members of the original movement, state that\r\nJews, Catholics and foreigners were members. The fact that the modern\r\nmovement is anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic and is opposed to the admission\r\nof foreign-born citizens of the country brands it _ipso facto_ as a\r\nhistorical fraud.\r\n\r\nAnother link in the chain of evidence against the modern organization lies\r\nin the provisions governing eligibility for membership. Article VII of the\r\nold \"Prescript\" reads:\r\n\r\n     \"No one shall be presented for membership into the Order until he\r\n     shall have first been recommended by some friend or intimate who is a\r\n     member, to the Investigating Committee (which shall be composed of\r\n     the Grand Cyclops, the Grand Magi, and the Grand Monk), and who\r\n     shall have investigated his antecedents and his past and present\r\n     standing and connections, and after such investigation, shall have\r\n     pronounced him competent and worthy to become a member.\"\r\n\r\nIt is here observed that in the selection of members the old Klan\r\nexercised the utmost care and scrutiny, and endeavored to throw around the\r\norganization every possible safeguard against the admission of undesirable\r\ncharacters. Even with precautions like those, men who were members of the\r\nKlan and left behind them written testimony declare that many men of bad\r\ncharacter became connected with the order. How utterly different is the\r\nmodern system with its indiscriminate solicitation of membership, with its\r\nadvertising methods, its open and notorious canvassing, and its selling\r\ncampaigns by means of literature, letters, motion pictures, agents and\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\nAlso, as far as the records show, there was no propagation department in\r\nthe old Klan, no system of Kleagles, King Kleagles, Goblins, or Imperial\r\nKleagle. All that is a Simmons innovation, designed to gather in large\r\nsums of money from a large number of people, money that goes mostly into\r\nthe pockets of paid workers whose chief interest in the \"noble cause\" is\r\nthat of plunder and not of patriotism. The initiation fee of the old Klan\r\nwas the paltry sum of one dollar. The new Klan, in its great piety and\r\naltruism denies that it has an initiation fee at all. It claims that\r\n\"citizenship\" in the \"Invisible Empire\" cannot be bought. Accordingly it\r\nrequires that before attaining this delectable privilege, the \"alien\" must\r\nmake a \"donation\" of ten dollars. A \"donation\" covers a multitude of sins.\r\nWhere a victim makes a free-will offering to a \"noble cause\" he can hardly\r\nclaim afterwards that his money has been taken from him under false\r\npretenses.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1921, it was announced that \"the Invisible Empire\" had amended\r\nits constitution so that women would be eligible for membership. This is a\r\nfurther point of dissimilarity between the two organizations, for while\r\nwomen were of great assistance to the original Klansmen in making robes\r\nand in giving information, the more serious work was done by the actual\r\nmembers who were men. In announcing that women were to be admitted to\r\nmembership the \"Emperor\" said:\r\n\r\n     \"_First._ The influence of women over the youth of the land shapes\r\n     the destiny of the nation, and it is in the cradles of the American\r\n     homes where the principles and ideals of Americanism should first be\r\n     instilled into the minds and hearts of the young. To the preservation\r\n     of these principles the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is dedicated.\r\n\r\n     \"_Second._ The loyalty of the women to the original Klan of the\r\n     Reconstruction period convinces us that as members of the Klan today\r\n     there will be equal loyalty and devotion to the fundamental\r\n     principles underlying the Order.\r\n\r\n     \"_Third._ We know women can keep a secret, because they made with\r\n     their fingers 160,000 robes for members of the old Klan and not one\r\n     of them ever disclosed the identity of any man who wore one of those\r\n     robes.\r\n\r\n     \"It is through the influence of women today that we have some of the\r\n     strongest men in the Order. And the time has come to give the women\r\n     recognition and to allow them to partake of the honor and glory of\r\n     membership in the organization.\"\r\n\r\nIn his statement, however, the \"Emperor\" failed to elucidate point Number\r\nFour, which was no doubt the principal incentive that caused the admission\r\nof women. Each lady Ku Klux will be required to donate ten dollars to the\r\n\"noble cause,\" and the admission of women doubles the number of\r\n\"prospects\" to whom the Ku Klux \"gold brick\" can be peddled. It is\r\ndoubtful if the effort to \"work\" this new field will prove successful, as\r\nthe women of the South are more or less antagonistic to the movement. The\r\nDaughters of the Confederacy of Virginia, at a convention held in the\r\nspring of 1921, passed a resolution condemning the organization, and\r\nasking the Virginia authorities to suppress it. It is hardly likely that\r\nthe daughters of the women who \"made with their fingers 160,000 robes for\r\nthe old Klan\" would care to become associated with the Gate City\r\nManufacturing Company, which is selling robes to all members at $6.50 a\r\nrobe, with a handsome profit on the side. Women, as a rule, are good\r\nbuyers, and it is hardly probable that they will look upon membership in\r\nthe \"Invisible Empire\" as a bargain even at ten dollars. Women are also\r\nthe chief supporters of the churches of the country, and it is doubtful\r\nif they would care to go through a \"Naturalization\" ceremony that is a\r\nblasphemous and sacriligious parody on the sacred and Holy rite of\r\nbaptism.\r\n\r\nAnother point of comparison between the two organizations lies in the\r\nattitude of the old Klan and the new in reference to allowing members to\r\nstudy their constitutions. We find, in the case of the original Klan, the\r\nfollowing edict:\r\n\r\n     \"Every Grand Cyclops shall read, or cause to be read, this Prescript\r\n     and these Edicts to his Den, at least once in every month; and shall\r\n     read them to each new member when he is initiated, or present the\r\n     same to him for his personal perusal.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have openness, frankness, and a disposition to take every member\r\ninto the confidence of the Order, so that each Klansman, at all times,\r\nwould have an opportunity to study and to understand the laws of the\r\norganization under which he was working. During the time I was an active\r\nmember and worker in the modern Ku Klux Klan, the constitution was a\r\nsecret document. Members under me repeatedly asked for a copy of it, and I\r\ntransmitted their requests to my immediate superior who could not comply\r\nwith it for the reason that he had never seen a copy of it himself. It was\r\nonly after he had served as King Kleagle of Tennessee for six months that\r\nhe was permitted to have one copy for which he had to give an iron-clad\r\nreceipt. I was allowed to glance through the booklet comprising the\r\ndocument, which afforded me the opportunity of noting a few salient\r\npoints, but this happened just as I was leaving the work. The officials of\r\nthe organization dare not permit the booklet I saw to be generally\r\ncirculated among their members.\r\n\r\nAs a final comparison of the two organizations it is interesting to note\r\nthat the leader of the old Klan recognized that it was brought into being\r\nfor the accomplishment of a specific, a definite and a concrete purpose.\r\nIt fulfilled its mission, and as soon as it became evident that this was\r\nthe case General Forrest ordered its disbandment. He stated that with the\r\ncourts properly functioning and the government properly established, there\r\nwas no longer any need for the Klan's existence. The new Klan, on the\r\nother hand, aside from taking money away from the public, has not made any\r\npublic statement as to its real intentions. In some of the pronouncements\r\nprinted in the official organ, there is an indication that the \"citizens\"\r\nof the \"Invisible Empire\" generally understand that the movement has a\r\ndefinite national mission. It is a matter of serious conjecture as to what\r\nkind of mission a secret, military, \"Invisible Empire\" can have in the\r\nUnited States. That there is no intention of disbanding the organization\r\nis evident by the fact that every attack made upon the system has so far\r\nresulted in a redoubling of efforts by the propagation agents. Statements\r\nreiterating the idea of \"pure Americanism\" and giving expression to\r\nhigh-sounding and sanctimonious platitudes come in unending streams from\r\nthe pen of the \"Emperor,\" who brazenly insists that his organization\r\nintends to enforce law and order.\r\n\r\nThe old Ku Klux Klan has a very deep place in the hearts of the Southern\r\npeople, and it holds the added glamour of being an organization about\r\nwhich little was known by the public up to a few years ago. Knowing this\r\nfeeling, the promoters of the modern organization have worked overtime\r\nupon the sympathies of the South in fostering an entirely different\r\nproposition. No matter what may be the ultimate objects of this\r\norganization, its claims to \"genuineness\" are fraudulent. Some of the\r\nleading men of the South and most of the newspapers have detected the\r\nfraud, but a great many unthinking men have joined the new movement under\r\nthe impression that they were becoming members of the old organization.\r\nThese men, when they have learned the truth, and have taken the trouble to\r\nstudy for themselves what I have discovered, will, I believe, withdraw\r\nfrom the organization and denounce it for what it is--an historical\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLAWLESSNESS AND CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore presenting, for the thoughtful consideration of the reader, the\r\nfacts to be set forth in this chapter, I submit for comparison certain\r\nportions of the Constitution of the United States, and the concluding\r\nportion of the \"oath of allegiance\" of the \"Invisible Empire,\" Knights of\r\nthe Ku Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nThe former consists of what is known as the \"Bill of Rights,\" and read:\r\n\r\n     \"_The right of the people to be secure in their persons_, houses,\r\n     papers, and effects, _against unreasonable searches and seizures,\r\n     shall not be violated_, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable\r\n     cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing\r\n     the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\r\n\r\n                                                            4th Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_No person shall be held to answer for a capital or other infamous\r\n     crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury_, except\r\n     in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when\r\n     in actual service, in time of war or public danger; nor shall any\r\n     person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of\r\n     life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\r\n     witness against himself, _nor be deprived of life, liberty, or\r\n     property, without due process of law_; nor shall private property be\r\n     taken for public use without just compensation.\"\r\n\r\n                                                            5th Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to\r\n     speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and\r\n     district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which districts\r\n     shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of\r\n     the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the\r\n     witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining\r\n     witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel in his\r\n     defence._\"\r\n\r\n                                                            6th Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,\r\n     _nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted_.\"\r\n\r\n                                                            8th Amendment.\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly studied the above portions of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, I now ask the reader to again study the concluding section\r\nof the Ku Klux oath:\r\n\r\n     \"I swear that I will _most zealously and valiantly_ shield and\r\n     preserve, _by any and all justifiable means and methods_, the sacred\r\n     constitutional rights and privileges of free public schools, free\r\n     speech, free press, separation of church and state, _liberty_, _white\r\n     supremacy_, just laws, and the _pursuit of happiness, against any\r\n     encroachment, of any nature, by any person or persons_, political\r\n     party or parties, _religious sect or people_, _native_, naturalized\r\n     or foreign, _of any race, color_, creed, lineage, or tongue\r\n     whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nWithout comment, I merely offer the above extracts for study and\r\ncomparison, and let the reader draw his own conclusions at the end of the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nA large number of outrages, consisting of lawless acts of various kinds,\r\nhave been reported in the newspapers as having been committed in the\r\nSouthern States since early in 1921. Men have been taken from their homes\r\nand conveyed to lonely spots where they have been beaten, tarred, and\r\nfeathered; women have been stripped of their clothing and covered with tar\r\nand feathers; some men have been boldly kidnapped in broad daylight and\r\ndriven in automobiles to obscure places and there flogged; others have\r\nbeen whipped and mutilated for alleged immorality; a sixty-eight year old\r\nfarmer was taken from his bed at night and beaten; an Episcopal clergyman\r\nwas given a coat of tar and feathers; a New Yorker was shot and beaten;\r\nand, numerous \"warnings\" have been given both publicly and privately of\r\n\"secret law enforcement\" and of dire threats to \"lay off\" investigating\r\nthe perpetrators.\r\n\r\n_In practically every instance of physical violence the criminal\r\nacts--committed in the name of \"law and order\"--have been perpetrated by\r\nmen wearing disguises, described as white robes and masks._\r\n\r\nIn several cases of violence the white caps, after finishing their work,\r\nhave left on the bodies of their victims the letters, \"K. K. K.\" either\r\nburned on the body with acid, or printed on placards tied to the person\r\nmaltreated. In cases where private warnings have been sent through the\r\nmails the same letters have been used, and in public warnings placards\r\nhave been posted conspicuously bearing the actual name of the \"Ku Klux\r\nKlan.\" Taking these facts into consideration, the evidence shows that the\r\noutrages were committed by men actuated with the spirit of Ku Kluxism,\r\nwhether they were all committed officially by Klans in Simmons'\r\norganization or not. That remains to be determined, but one salient fact\r\nstands out very suspiciously and it is this: outrages committed in this\r\nfashion have only been epidemic since the \"Invisible Empire\" began its\r\npropagation in the States affected. In this connection, it might be well\r\nto recall the conversation I had with the King Kleagle of Tennessee in\r\nMay, 1921.\r\n\r\nCharters were about to be granted to three Klans in upper East Tennessee.\r\nI asked the King Kleagle this question:\r\n\r\n\"My people want to know what to do when they get their charters. What\r\nshall I tell them?\"\r\n\r\n_\"Tell them to clean up their towns,\" he replied._\r\n\r\nAmong the first reported cases of violence on the part of masked men\r\noccurred in Atlanta, Ga., the headquarters of Ku Kluxism, the home of the\r\n\"Invisible Empire.\" J. C. Thomas, a white man, received an anonymous\r\nletter advising him to \"leave alone\" a certain woman named Myers, upon\r\npenalty of action, but paid no attention to the warning. One night Thomas\r\nwas enticed into entering a motor car in which were several strangers, the\r\nfalse representation being made that the \"Chief of Police wanted to see\r\nhim about some bad checks.\" The car was driven to Lakewood, an amusement\r\npark, and Thomas was ordered to get out. He refused to obey the order,\r\ndrew his knife, and put up a fight, killing Fred Thompson, one of his\r\nabductors and wounding another. The Grand Jury of Fulton County failed to\r\nindict Thomas, but did indict two of his captors.\r\n\r\n_Simmons admitted that Thompson was a member of the Ku Klux Klan._\r\n\r\nNumerous cases have been reported in Atlanta where threatening letters\r\nhave been sent and received. A young Scotchman was threatened for making\r\nimproper remarks about social equality, while a physician was warned on\r\naccount of alleged neglect of his family. According to J. H. Leavitt, an\r\nAtlanta lawyer, who was himself threatened, not only was he himself marked\r\nfor violence but included in the same category were Dr. C. B. Wilmer, the\r\nEpiscopal clergyman and Ex-Senator Hoke Smith.\r\n\r\nIn Durham, North Carolina, a Greek restaurant proprietor received an\r\nanonymous warning signed \"K. K. K.\" ordering him to leave town. It\r\nappeared that he had permitted the intermingling of the races in his place\r\nof business. The Greek refused to take the matter seriously, employed a\r\nlawyer and laughed the incident out of town. Nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful and searching investigation made by the _New York World_,\r\nthere have been disclosed a large number of cases of violence and\r\nlawlessness in the South, and a study of the synopsis of these cases is\r\ninteresting. It will be noted that the majority of outrages have occurred\r\nin the State of Texas, where the masked regulators have been extremely\r\nactive, and where the Ku Klux Klan is strongly organized. These outrages\r\nhave been so numerous in Texas as to attract the attention of the entire\r\ncountry, and have caused an upheaval in the Lone Star State. Some of the\r\nreally law-abiding Texas people, who do not believe in \"invisible\r\ngovernment\" and irresponsible censorship of morals, have attempted to\r\nsecure some sort of action at the hands of the Texas legislature. Their\r\nefforts in the summer of 1921 were not successful, one legislator even\r\ngoing so far as publicly to defend the Ku Klux Klan. Other indignant\r\ncitizens announced that they would band themselves secretly together and\r\nwage war on Ku Kluxism.\r\n\r\nA chronological summary of the published cases of lawlessness in the\r\nSouth, indicating the methods of Ku Kluxism, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     February 5, 1921.--In Houston, Texas, B. I. Hobbs, a lawyer, was\r\n     seized, had his hair clipped and was ordered to leave town, the\r\n     charge against him being \"too close fraternization\" with negroes.\r\n     Hobbs then went to Alvin, Texas, a short distance away, and on\r\n     February 8, 1921, was run out of that town by eight masked men.\r\n\r\n     March 3, 1921.--At Houston, Texas, J. La Fayette Cockrell, a negro\r\n     dentist, was mutilated by masked men for alleged association with\r\n     white women. A race riot nearly resulted from this attack.\r\n\r\n     March 7, 1921.--A. V. Hopkins, a merchant of Houston, Texas, was\r\n     mutilated, tarred, and feathered for annoying high school girls.\r\n\r\n     April 1, 1921.--Alexander Johnson, a negro bell boy, of Dallas,\r\n     Texas, was taken out by masked men, whipped, and the letters \"K. K.\r\n     K.\" burned on his forehead with acid. He was said to have associated\r\n     with white women.\r\n\r\n     April 10, 1921.--Gus Beck, stock man, of Webster, Texas, was tied to\r\n     a telegraph pole by masked men, beaten and left there all night.\r\n\r\n     April 10, 1921.--At Houston, Texas, J. S. Allen, prominent attorney,\r\n     was seized in a crowded downtown street by masked men, and conveyed\r\n     to the country in an automobile. He was there tarred and feathered.\r\n     He was then returned to the city, and was dumped from a car into the\r\n     middle of a street in the most prominent business section, in a nude\r\n     condition except for the coating of tar and feathers. In the reports\r\n     of the case there is no record of police interference.\r\n\r\n     April 15, 1921.--Bill Harris, negro bell boy, at Dallas, Texas, was\r\n     beaten by masked men for alleged insult of white women.\r\n\r\n     April 26, 1921.--At Houston, Texas, J. W. McGee, an automobile\r\n     salesman, was whipped by masked men for annoying high school girls.\r\n\r\n     May 1, 1921.--\"Red\" Kemp, a jitney driver, was whipped, tarred and\r\n     feathered by twelve masked men at Goose Creek, Texas.\r\n\r\n     May 4, 1921.--Sam King, Marshal at Brenham, Texas, was tarred and\r\n     feathered. He then resigned his office.\r\n\r\n     May 7, 1921.--At Beaumont, Texas, Dr. J. S. Paul was seized by\r\n     fifteen masked men, whipped, tarred, and feathered and given\r\n     forty-eight hours in which to leave the city. At the same time R. F.\r\n     Scott, a Marine Corps veteran of Deweyville was given the same\r\n     treatment. These two acts were publicly admitted by the Beaumont\r\n     Klan, and their charter was revoked by \"Emperor\" Simmons.\r\n\r\n     May 20, 1921.--One thousand men marched through the streets of\r\n     Dallas, Texas, at night, mounted and unmounted, all of them attired\r\n     in the Ku Klux regalia. They carried a fiery cross, and several\r\n     banners bearing these words: \"The Invisible Empire,\" \"White\r\n     Supremacy,\" \"Pure Womanhood,\" \"Dallas Must Be Clean,\" \"Our Little\r\n     Girls Must Be Protected,\" \"All Native Born,\" \"The Guilty Must Pay.\"\r\n     They rode and marched through the streets silently and without\r\n     interference from the authorities. Announcements of the purposes and\r\n     objects of the Klan had previously been accepted and printed by the\r\n     Dallas papers.\r\n\r\n     May 21, 1921.--At Sour Lake, Texas, Joe J. Devere, a justice of the\r\n     peace, was tarred and feathered.\r\n\r\n     May 23, 1921.--Ku Klux Klan paid $10 fine in police court at Dallas,\r\n     Texas, for tacking signs on telegraph poles.\r\n\r\n     May 23, 1921.--At Dallas, Texas, John Moore, white, was seized in his\r\n     home by masked men, taken to the out-skirts of the city, stripped of\r\n     his clothing and lashed with a horsewhip. He was accused of attacking\r\n     a twelve-year-old girl. He fled town.\r\n\r\n     May 23, 1921.--At Houston, Texas, Ira McKeown, taxi driver, was\r\n     beaten.\r\n\r\n     May 24, 1921.--At Dallas, Texas, John Parks was flogged by masked\r\n     men.\r\n\r\n     May 25, 1921.--Jack Morgan, of Shreveport, was tarred and feathered\r\n     by masked men.\r\n\r\n     June 8, 1921.--Dr. R.

Masked men wearing white uniforms attacked her, the woman\r\n     said. They drove up to the hotel in three automobiles. Mrs. Johnson\r\n     had been arrested on a charge of bigamy at Center, Texas, and was out\r\n     on bond when she was seized.\r\n\r\n     July 17, 1921.--At Nacogdoches, Texas, J. M.

Irwin, archdeacon of the\r\n     English Episcopal Church, and head of the work of that church among\r\n     South Florida negroes, carried him into the woods, whipped him, and\r\n     then applied a coat of tar and feathers to his body. He was placed in\r\n     a sack and taken in an automobile to a spot in the center of the town\r\n     and dumped into the street. The following Tuesday, in response to a\r\n     telegram from Rev. R. T. Phillips, rector of Trinity Church, Right\r\n     Reverend Cameron Mann, Bishop of Southern Florida reached Miami and\r\n     conferred with several officials, also appearing before the Grand\r\n     Jury in order to make a statement as to Archdeacon Irwin's work. In\r\n     his report to the Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church\r\n     of the United States, Bishop Mann said:\r\n\r\n     \"About the middle of the afternoon, while I was consulting with the\r\n     mayor and the circuit judge, the commander of the local post of the\r\n     American Legion came in and stated that he had reliable information\r\n     that if Archdeacon Irwin remained in the city he would be lynched,\r\n     and that in all probability church property would be burned and\r\n     numerous lives lost. He therefore asked that Archdeacon Irwin should\r\n     agree to leave the city that afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n     The charge made by the mob against the clergyman was that he had\r\n     preached \"race equality\" and \"intermarriage.\" Bishop Mann declares\r\n     unequivocally that Archdeacon Irwin does not hold to social or\r\n     political equality for negroes in the United States, has never taught\r\n     it, and in his missionary work has incurred disfavor with some\r\n     negroes by his opposition to societies and movements which upheld the\r\n     doctrine.\r\n\r\n     It was reported in the papers that the judge who brought the case to\r\n     the attention of the Grand Jury told that body that, while the right\r\n     of free speech is guaranteed, strangers should not defy the\r\n     sentiments and traditions of the public.\r\n\r\n     July 16, 1921.--At Bay City, Tex., W. M. Hoopengarner, a banker, was\r\n     tarred and feathered and beaten. The reason alleged was domestic\r\n     infidelity.\r\n\r\n     July 18, 1921.--G. C. Benson beaten at Dickinson, Tex.\r\n\r\n     July 18, 1921.--E. H. Peters, of Athens, Tex., was dragged from his\r\n     room, beaten, dumped out of an automobile and seriously hurt.\r\n\r\n     July 19, 1921.--At Tenaha, Tex., J. W. McKnight was seized a second\r\n     time by masked men.\r\n\r\n     July 19, 1921.--Declaring that he had information that fifty per cent\r\n     of the members of the Oklahoma City police department belonged to the\r\n     Ku Klux Klan, Mayor John C. Welton directed Chief Glitsch to\r\n     investigate and to discharge every police officer who did not resign\r\n     immediately from the Klan. On July 24, Mayor Welton was called on the\r\n     telephone, and was told: \"We warn you to lay off the Ku Klux Klan, or\r\n     we will have to wait on you.\" The mayor paid no attention to the\r\n     warning.\r\n\r\n     July 22, 1921.--At Hillsboro, Tex., a note from the Ku Klux Klan was\r\n     received and published in the local paper as a \"warning to some\r\n     married men who should spend more time with their own wives.\"\r\n\r\n     July 26, 1921.--At Topeka, Kan., a warning was sent to Senator\r\n     Capper's newspaper to \"leave the Ku Klux Klan alone.\"\r\n\r\n     July 29, 1921.--Ben Wiley, of Lufkin, Tex., was put into a sack and\r\n     tarred and feathered.\r\n\r\n     In the State of Missouri, a farmer aged sixty-eight years, was taken\r\n     from his bed at night, removed out of doors and severely beaten by\r\n     masked men; and a woman in Birmingham, Ala., was also maltreated by a\r\n     mob composed of the same sort of individuals.\r\n\r\nIn most cases local sentiment appears to have been strongly with the\r\nperpetrators of the outrages, this being especially true at Waco, Tex. A\r\nman was assaulted by masked men at that place, but the victim succeeded in\r\nescaping from his attackers, recognizing three of the men who had seized\r\nhim. He had them arrested, and they were bound over to await the session\r\nof the Grand Jury. Five preachers and the President of a Texas University\r\nsigned the bonds of the men accused of mob violence.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Texas, however, the depredations of masked individuals\r\nbrought into being a counter movement, and the _Dallas News_ notes the\r\nreceipt of the following anonymous communication:\r\n\r\n     \"To the citizens of North Texas and the Ku Klux Klan:\r\n\r\n     \"The Anti-Ku Klux Klan of North Texas announces its being in the form\r\n     of a mob.\r\n\r\n     \"We intend and will do no violence unless the Ku Klux Klan shows\r\n     violence. We are in being and in force. If necessary we will travel\r\n     in force to do business in the form of open warfare.\r\n\r\n     \"The law will have its chance to show that we have laws against mobs,\r\n     white-capping, and acts of violence. But we warn that being in Rome\r\n     we do as the Romans do.\r\n\r\n     \"We are unknown and unknowable. We will remain that way. We hope that\r\n     we will not have to resort to populating lamp posts and using cold\r\n     steel, but if so, Oakland and Greenwood will boast of much activity\r\n     and the price of black crepe will rise. 'Anti-Ku Klux Klan of North\r\n     Texas.'\"\r\n\r\nA similar organization was announced from southeast Texas. In an\r\nAssociated Press dispatch from Beaumont, under date of July 27, 1921, it\r\nwas reported:\r\n\r\n     \"Organization is said to have been effected of a band of men to\r\n     combat the alleged activities of the Ku Klux Klan, in South East\r\n     Texas, with the announced intention of conducting open warfare\r\n     against the members of the Klan if necessary 'because officers have\r\n     not the nerve or desire to place under arrest its members who have\r\n     violated the law.'\r\n\r\n     \"First announcement of the new organization was set forth yesterday\r\n     in a communication addressed to the Ku Klux Klan and sent to a local\r\n     newspaper for publication. 'Squads of special service men,' the\r\n     notice stated, 'have been appointed to locate members of the Klan.'\r\n     It added that summary punishment would be inflicted upon any who are\r\n     found. The communication said in part:\r\n\r\n     \"'We have formed a club, or mob, you may call it, of more than one\r\n     hundred fearless men and we are going to stop you people with hot\r\n     lead and hot steel at the first opportunity, and that will not be far\r\n     off. We have sworn vengeance on such people and will shoot down like\r\n     a mad dog men whom we learn to be members of the Klan.'\"\r\n\r\nSome of the newspapers of Texas have fearlessly taken a stand against the\r\nwidespread epidemic of masked violence, even going so far as to charge\r\nthem directly to the Ku Klux Klan. Notable among these has been the\r\n_Houston Chronicle_. In an editorial printed in August, 1921, under the\r\nheading \"Law, or Secret Cult,\" it said:\r\n\r\n     \"Once more the nation comes to a parting of the ways.\r\n\r\n     \"The issue is clearly defined. No one but the unimaginative can\r\n     misunderstand it.\r\n\r\n     \"Constituted authority must prevail, or we are in for a reign of\r\n     masked and irresponsible terror.\r\n\r\n     \"The fine phrases with which apologies for the Ku Klux Klan defend it\r\n     fall flat before what happened to that woman in Tanaha and that other\r\n     woman in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n     \"'Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear,' they declare, but what\r\n     does that amount to when any citizen can be accused, seized and\r\n     violently used without a hearing?\r\n\r\n     \"Why do we bother about trial by jury, if the evidence of an angry\r\n     and impulsive mob is sufficient to convict?\r\n\r\n     \"Why have we built up a complicated system of justice, except to\r\n     protect indicted citizens?\r\n\r\n     \"'Those eyes that see everything' and 'those ears that hear\r\n     everything' have evidently missed the Magna Charta, the Bill of\r\n     Rights, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the\r\n     United States.\r\n\r\n     \"Once more they would thrust us back on the evidence of passion, and\r\n     conviction by emotion.\r\n\r\n     \"Once more they would rob the defendant of his right to be heard, to\r\n     summons witnesses, to appeal to an impartial tribunal.\r\n\r\n     \"Once more they would have punishment decided upon and inflicted by a\r\n     council that cannot be held accountable.\r\n\r\n     \"Once more they would expose everybody; whether criminal or not, to\r\n     disguised tyranny.\r\n\r\n     \"And they call it Americanism--this semi-barbaric horseplay that\r\n     gives its victim no chance, that comes upon him unawares, that shuts\r\n     his mouth and overpowers him by force.\r\n\r\n     \"Innocent, or guilty, he has no privilege but to accept the\r\n     inevitable, and that is what they call loyalty to their country and\r\n     their country's institutions.\r\n\r\n     \"Two women have been stripped and flogged, and this they say was done\r\n     in the name of chivalry.\r\n\r\n     \"Their names are written on a secret roster and their faces are\r\n     covered, and this they assert is in keeping with those traditions of\r\n     frankness, candor and open dealing which have been essentially\r\n     characteristic of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"'Those eyes that see everything' and 'those ears that hear\r\n     everything' are evidently blind and deaf to the great struggle and\r\n     dearly bought experiences by which Anglo-Saxon civilization has\r\n     struggled from a state of tribal law to organized justice.\r\n\r\n     \"A law that cannot be written is not fit to enforce. A charge that\r\n     cannot be proved in an open manner is not fit to be made the basis of\r\n     punishment.\r\n\r\n     \"Persons who will not make accusations in the daylight are not fit to\r\n     be believed.\r\n\r\n     \"A theory of justice that does not afford the accused any time or\r\n     right of defense is not fit to be defended.\r\n\r\n     \"We are face to face with a mad conception of government, with an\r\n     impossible basis of law enforcement.\r\n\r\n     \"There can be no compromise with it, no half-hearted attitude.

He is serving two masters--one of them created by\r\n     the people, the other by a class within the people.\r\n\r\n     \"True loyalty permits of no such divided allegiance, true patriotism\r\n     recognizes but one master. Unless the overthrow of this government is\r\n     intended, there is no place or excuse for the 'Invisible Empire.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSIMMONS FORCED TO ACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cases of lawlessness set forth in the foregoing chapter have been laid\r\nat the door of the \"Invisible Empire,\" but \"Emperor\" Simmons has denied\r\nthat the acts involved were committed by members of his organization.\r\nThere have been, however, three specific cases where outrages have been\r\n_proven_ to have been committed by members of the \"Invisible Empire,\" and\r\nin these cases the \"Emperor\" has been forced to take action against his\r\nown Klans, revoking charters in two instances and suspending the charter\r\nof the third. This action on the part of the \"Emperor\" has been\r\nextensively advertised by him as a guarantee of good faith that he intends\r\nto keep his \"Invisible Empire\" free from the control of lawless\r\ncharacters; but, public opinion, in the shape of widespread editorial\r\ncomment of leading newspapers, does not agree with his point of view.\r\nEditors agree that no matter how altruistic may be the claims of the\r\n\"Invisible Empire,\" a movement of secret government, acting extra-legally\r\ncannot be held in control; and it having been demonstrated in three\r\nspecific instances that the Ku Klux Klan has been guilty of lawlessness,\r\nthus necessitating the \"Emperor's\" summary action, it follows that the\r\nwhole system has no place in American affairs.\r\n\r\nBelieving that these developments in the Ku Klux situation fully sustain\r\nmy position that the \"Invisible Empire\" is not a fraternal order, but a\r\ncombination seeking to govern the American people by intimidation and\r\nforce, I shall take up these cases in detail, the facts in each instance\r\nhaving been fully verified by the _New York World_ in its investigations.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of lawlessness developed in Mobile, Ala., when people\r\nof that city awoke one morning in the spring of 1921, to find Ku Klux\r\nwarnings on many billboards, trees, and telephone poles, and in other\r\npublic places. Most of them laughed, but some of the negroes took the\r\nsigns seriously and prepared to leave the city. A Northern exodus was\r\nthreatened, but with all the excitement the newspapers of the city\r\nremained silent, not even printing the notice found stuck up about the\r\nplace, although a New Orleans paper carried the story which was read by\r\nthe negroes of Mobile. Fearing the action of public opinion, \"Emperor\"\r\nSimmons revoked the charter of the Mobile Klan.\r\n\r\nThe warning read:\r\n\r\n     \"Law violators! This is the first and last time that we will warn\r\n     you! You must either heed this warning or take the consequences, for\r\n     if you have any doubts in your mind that you will not be able to\r\n     comply with the laws of this city and county then you had better\r\n     leave at once; 'for be ye well assured' that we will attend to you\r\n     without fear or favor.\r\n\r\n     \"This warning is for the taxi drivers, street smashers, bad women,\r\n     shinny dealers, gamblers, thieves, loafers, and any and all violators\r\n     of the law. We know you and have your names, and should you violate\r\n     one of the laws after receiving this warning be ye assured that we\r\n     will attend to you without hesitation, as the laws of this county\r\n     must be complied with.\r\n\r\n     \"No law-abiding citizens need fear anything from this organization\r\n     for we stand back of the laws and see that they are enforced\r\n     regardless. This is no negro whipping organization, but should\r\n     occasion arise, be ye assured that we will not hesitate.\r\n\r\n     \"This warning also applies to colored doctors. Seventy-two hours\r\n     after this notice you must have the word 'colored' posted on your\r\n     sign. This waiting on white patients must be stopped. We know you,\r\n     and the next case that you attend don't blame us, as you have been\r\n     warned.\r\n\r\n     \"Bad women, you must obey the laws or then you must leave the city.\r\n     This county shall be clean. Married men, you must look after your\r\n     families and quit carousing; violation of this warning means\r\n     unhealthy steps for you.\r\n\r\n     \"We stand for the chastity of womanhood, peace and harmony in the\r\n     home, law enforcement and protection of our homes and our families.\r\n     Mobile County must be clean. Law violators, this means you.\r\n\r\n     \"We are one hundred per cent Americans, and stand back of law\r\n     enforcement, regardless.\r\n\r\n     \"We do not fight anyone on account of their religious scruples nor\r\n     will we tolerate same regardless.\r\n\r\n     \"This warning is for those living in the jurisdiction of the Klan,\r\n     and we are here twenty-five hundred strong to see that these warnings\r\n     are carried out. Your next warning will be in person.\r\n\r\n     \"(Signed) The Ku Klux Klan, Mobile City and County.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Mobile Klan really had twenty-five hundred members at the time its\r\ncharter was revoked, it means that it had paid $25,000 into the coffers of\r\nthe Ku Klux agents, to say nothing of some $16,000 paid to the Atlanta\r\noffice for robes. It seems rather unkind of the \"Emperor\" not to have\r\nallowed the Mobile outfit something in return for its heavy outlay. Had it\r\nbeen permitted to continue, it could easily have beaten and tarred and\r\nfeathered a few helpless women, driven out of town some of the taxi\r\ndrivers and gamblers, and mutilated a few negro men. As it turned out, the\r\nKlansmen suddenly found themselves \"all dressed up and no place to go,\"\r\nand in pretty much the same position as a lot of little boys who have been\r\nplaying pirate and whose stern parents ordered them to come home.\r\n\r\nThe second instance of admitted lawlessness on the part of the national\r\norganization occurred at Pensacola, Fla., and was a particularly brazen\r\nattempt on the part of secret mob government to assume to enforce its own\r\nlaws. About half past eight o'clock on the night of July 8, 1921, a\r\ndelegation of the local Ku Klux Klan drove in automobiles up to the cafe\r\nof Chris Lochas, three cars loaded with Klansmen, wearing white robes and\r\nhelmets, while other cars, similarly filled, stopped on the corner of the\r\nstreet. Three members of the Klan walked into the cafe and handed a letter\r\nin an envelope to Lochas. The message read:\r\n\r\n     \"You are an undesirable citizen. You violate the Federal prohibition\r\n     laws, the laws of decency, and you are a running sore on society.\r\n\r\n     \"Several trains are leaving Pensacola daily. Take your choice, but\r\n     don't take too much time.\r\n\r\n     \"Sincerely in earnest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the letter was handed to Lochas, Captain Harper of the Police\r\nDepartment was standing inside the cafe, talking to the proprietor. Lochas\r\nopened the letter, looked at it and put it into his pocket, and thinking\r\nthe matter a joke paid no attention to it. A few minutes later some\r\nnegroes, who had seen the members of the Klan and recognized them for what\r\nthey were, came into the cafe and their stories of the Klan caused Lochas\r\nto examine the letter more carefully and show it to the police. After\r\ndelivering the message, the three members of the Klan walked out of the\r\ncafe, entered their automobiles and the three cars drove away into the\r\nnight. The street was crowded at the time of the visit and hundreds of\r\npeople saw the men in white robes halt their cars in front of the cafe and\r\non the street corner, saw the messengers enter and leave the cafe and saw\r\nthe cars drive away. In addition to the police captain who was on the\r\ninside of the cafe, a uniformed policeman was on duty immediately outside\r\nthe door, yet neither the police nor any person present noted the license\r\nnumbers of the cars or made any attempt to interfere with the visitors.\r\n\r\nThe _Pensacola News_ in an editorial printed July 9, 1921, said:\r\n\r\n     \"Good citizens expressed themselves freely today concerning the\r\n     occurrence of last night and were unanimous in the opinion that in a\r\n     community where the courts are open and where the law is enforced by\r\n     officers chosen by the people, there is not the slightest\r\n     justification or excuse for any oath-bound secret organization,\r\n     setting itself up above the law and usurping the functions of the\r\n     duly constituted officers of the Government, meeting in\r\n     out-of-the-way places, acting in secret, and moving in disguise,\r\n     setting up its own standards of right and wrong, acting as accuser,\r\n     witness, judge and executioner, and that the activities of such an\r\n     organization will not be tolerated in this community even if it\r\n     should become necessary to appeal to Federal authorities and invoke\r\n     the aid of the Government secret service men to arrest its\r\n     activities.\r\n\r\n     \"The opinion was freely expressed that if one body of men acting in\r\n     secret can command a resident to leave the city under a veiled threat\r\n     of personal injury, because the organization conceives the idea that\r\n     the man is violating the prohibition law, another secret organization\r\n     of men has an equal right to invite a young woman to leave town\r\n     because perchance she might go in bathing in a bath costume not in\r\n     accordance with the views of that organization; and another secret\r\n     organization of men might call an employer to his door at midnight\r\n     and give him a warning that he must raise the wages of his employees\r\n     or grant them shorter working hours, or suffer personal violence.\r\n\r\n     \"The activities of last night have been reported to United States,\r\n     State, and county officials, who are considering what steps to take\r\n     in the matter. It is made a criminal offense by city ordinance for\r\n     any persons to appear in public in disguise, and police officers have\r\n     been instructed to arrest any person appearing in public in disguise.\r\n     It is made a crime against the United States for two or more persons\r\n     to conspire against another to deprive him of his civil rights, and\r\n     it is made a criminal offense by the laws of the State for two or\r\n     more persons to conspire or confederate to commit a breach of peace,\r\n     and the State laws prohibit a rout, which is defined to be the\r\n     assembling of three or more persons for any unlawful purpose. It is\r\n     believed that the laws of the United States, the State and the city\r\n     are ample to arrest the activities of any secret organization of the\r\n     character mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of indignation of the best citizens of Pensacola, Simmons\r\nsuspended the charter of the Pensacola Klan, and offered to aid in\r\ndiscovering the perpetrators of the lawlessness, issuing a long statement\r\nwhich appeared on the front page of the Pensacola morning paper July 14,\r\n1921, wherein he stated, with his usual sanctimonious whine that his\r\norganization stood for \"the supremacy of pure Americanism without fear and\r\nwithout reproach,\" and gave expression, in his usual bad English, to his\r\nusual platitudes.\r\n\r\nThe _Pensacola News_ in an editorial the same day challenged the \"Emperor\"\r\nto aid the authorities in detecting the criminals by giving the names of\r\nthe members of the local Klan so they could be called before the Grand\r\nJury and be examined under oath, and the names of the guilty parties\r\nthereby ascertained. The _News_ further said:\r\n\r\n     \"'Pure Americanism' stands for equal opportunity, unabridged freedom\r\n     within the law, orderly government, and the enforcement of the laws\r\n     by the processes ordained by the Constitution. The anonymous\r\n     communication, the ganging together of many to attack one, the\r\n     affecting of a disguise, and the secret organization of men who took\r\n     the law into their own hands in Pensacola on last Friday night, are\r\n     the methods of the black hand, the mafia, and the nihilists. These\r\n     organizations had their origin in Europe and cannot flourish upon\r\n     American soil.\r\n\r\n     \"There is no room beneath the Stars and Stripes for anarchy and\r\n     bolshevism, for any organization that cannot afford to give the\r\n     prosecuting attorneys of the Federal and State government the names\r\n     of its members. The secrets of the organization will not be pried\r\n     into, but the criminals will be handed over to the State for\r\n     prosecution in the manner provided for by law.\r\n\r\n     \"We repeat, the situation in Pensacola affords the K. K. K. and its\r\n     Imperial Wizard an opportunity to show that their organization does\r\n     not stand for lawlessness, that its members are law abiding, and that\r\n     the organization will not countenance crime or its concealment by its\r\n     members.\"\r\n\r\nSimmons, of course, has never complied with this challenge, as far as has\r\nbeen reported in the newspapers, and it is doubtful if he ever will. He\r\nhas issued a long-winded, verbose statement since that time rehashing the\r\nsame platitudes that have characterized all his writings and speeches, but\r\nhas not turned over to the authorities the names of his local members. The\r\ncharter of the Pensacola Klan has merely been suspended, although the\r\noffense committed was far more flagrant and specific than the case of the\r\nMobile Klan, and it is quite likely that should the matter \"blow over\" the\r\nPensacola organization will be reinstated.\r\n\r\nThe third case in which the \"Emperor\" found it necessary to take public\r\naction against one of his Klans which had gone too far in publicly\r\nadvertising the \"noble cause\" occurred in Beaumont, Tex., and attracted\r\nnewspaper attention on a nation-wide scale in the month of July, 1921. It\r\nwas the first time that a Klan openly and publicly admitted its\r\nparticipation in an overt act of lawlessness. The case was so brazen that\r\nthe \"Emperor\" revoked the Klan's charter.\r\n\r\nIt appears from an examination of the facts in the case that masked men\r\nentered the office of one Dr. J. S. Paul, in the city of Beaumont, on the\r\nnight of May 7, 1921, forced the physician to accompany them to a waiting\r\nautomobile, conveyed him to the country, whipped him, tarred and feathered\r\nhim and ordered him to leave town. A short time after that, similar\r\ntreatment was meted out to one R. F. Scott, described in the dispatches as\r\na veteran of the Marine Corps. Much excitement prevailed in Beaumont,\r\nuntil on July 21, 1921, a communication was received by the local\r\nnewspapers under seal of \"Klan No. 7, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,\" of\r\nBeaumont, accompanied by a long statement of alleged facts in the cases of\r\nthe two men who had been beaten.\r\n\r\nFrankly admitting that its members had attacked Paul and Scott, the\r\nstatement went into details as to the characters and conduct of the two\r\nmen. It was charged that Paul had, for a long time, been making a business\r\nof criminal operations on women, of the sale of drugs and whiskey, and had\r\nwaxed fat and powerful in this alleged illicit business. It was charged\r\nthat for the past five years repeated attempts had been made to have him\r\nindicted and convicted, but that on account of wealth and political\r\ninfluence, he had succeeded in evading the law. The climax of his alleged\r\npractices was reached in the case of a young woman, her name was not given\r\nin the statement, who was brought to Paul for an alleged operation. It\r\nappears from the charges made by the Klan that Scott was involved in the\r\nmatter. According to the statements of the Klan, an operation was\r\nperformed, from the results of which the woman was caused to suffer severe\r\nconsequences, it being claimed that death nearly resulted from her\r\ncondition. It appears further from the allegations that the woman called\r\nto see Doctor Paul and demanded financial assistance, asking for $1000 to\r\nreimburse her for her expenses incurred during her illness. This,\r\naccording to the statement, Paul refused to pay, offering instead $500,\r\nwhich was refused, after which the woman was said to have been ordered out\r\nof the office. The rest of the story, told in the exact words of the Klan\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n     \"Following this visit to Doctor Paul the girl visited the county\r\n     attorney and related her story to him, but she pleaded that her\r\n     father and mother be spared the shame of parading her misfortune to\r\n     the world. She was assured by the county attorney that he was\r\n     powerless to act unless she herself would file the complaint and\r\n     testify against Doctor Paul. This she felt she could not do and left\r\n     the court of law in despair. Then followed several days of unceasing\r\n     agony the sufferings of the pangs of hunger and the remorselessness\r\n     of a conscience that had been violated. The depths of despair were\r\n     reached, suicide was the next logical step. The anguish-laden cry of\r\n     that poor girl was heard by men who respect the great moral law more\r\n     than the technicalities of the legal code. The heavy hand of the Ku\r\n     Klux was laid upon Doctor Paul.\r\n\r\n          \"For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds,\r\n           Their large professions and their little deeds,\r\n           Mingles in selfish strife, Lo! freedom weeps,\r\n           Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\"\r\n\r\n          (Ku Klux Ritual)\r\n\r\n     \"The eyes of the unknown had seen and observed the wrong to be\r\n     redressed. Doctor Paul stood convicted before God and man as the\r\n     murderer of unborn babies, the despoiler of little children, the\r\n     social leper who sells the life of a human being for a money\r\n     consideration. His victim was a poor girl. Doctor Paul was wealthy.\r\n     Between the two stood the majesty of the law, draped in the\r\n     technicalities of changes of venue, mistrials, appeals,\r\n     postponements, eminent counsel skilled in the esoteric art of\r\n     protecting crime and interpreting laws involved in a mass of legal\r\n     verbiage, the winding and unwinding of red tape, instead of the\r\n     sinewy arm of justice, wielding the unerring sword. The law of the\r\n     Man is justice.\r\n\r\n     \"Doctor Paul was approached in his office by three men on the night\r\n     of May 7, and instructed to go with them. He was placed in a waiting\r\n     automobile and escorted a few miles out of town. The judgment of the\r\n     Klan was read to him and charges were related to him, none of which\r\n     he would deny. In a cowardly, whimpering plea, he plead that others\r\n     were as guilty as he. The lash was laid on his back and the tar and\r\n     feathers applied to his body. He was then informed that it was the\r\n     will of the Klan that he should leave the city within forty-eight\r\n     hours. Upon the return of the party to Beaumont, Doctor Paul was\r\n     discharged from an automobile at the intersection of two of the main\r\n     streets of the city that he might be a warning to all of his ilk that\r\n     decent men and women no longer wanted him in the community. Doctor\r\n     Paul complied with the instructions of the Klan that he leave the\r\n     city and returned for a few days to his former home at Lufkin. During\r\n     this time he was under the constant surveillance of the Klan.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Paul returned to Beaumont, according to the statement, he was\r\ninvited to appear before the Grand Jury for the purpose of testifying\r\nabout his attackers, but upon appearing before that body, he was\r\nconfronted with the girl in the case, who, it appears, for some reason not\r\nmentioned in the statement, had decided to make a public complaint against\r\nDoctor Paul in the manner prescribed by law. Why it was any more improper\r\nfor the woman to have testified before the Grand Jury in the first place\r\nthan in the second the Klan does not mention, but, according to its\r\nexplanation, Doctor Paul was indicted on several counts, along with Scott,\r\nthe other man involved, and was released on bail. Here follows some very\r\nexcellent Ku Klux humor:\r\n\r\n     \"Doctor Paul immediately made bond and was released from custody,\r\n     Scott was later arrested and in a few days made bond and released.\r\n     Doctor Paul for many days, in company with his hired henchman, openly\r\n     paraded the streets of the city armed to the teeth in open defiance\r\n     of the law.\"\r\n\r\nHere is Ku Kluxism in all of its glory. \"In open defiance of the law,\"\r\nutterly repudiating the Bill of Rights of both Federal and State\r\nconstitutions, which guarantee a man the right of trial by jury, this\r\norganization had abducted a citizen, tried him secretly, convicted him,\r\nand punished him and then whines because its former victim armed himself\r\nas a protection against further mob violence. Regardless of any and all of\r\nthe allegations against Doctor Paul, the assumption of any set of men to\r\nsecretly handle the law enforcement of a community is nothing more or less\r\nthan anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting and illustrative of the Ku Klux state of mind to\r\nstudy this remarkable document, for which reason I am giving copious\r\nextracts. It appears that efforts of all kinds according to the Ku Klux,\r\nwere made by Paul and Scott to kill the case, and the Klan claims that\r\nScott was persistent in his efforts to induce the woman in the affair to\r\nleave town. The statement continues:\r\n\r\n     \"Scott was warned that his conduct towards the girl must cease and\r\n     that he would be required to stand trial at the appointed time. This\r\n     warning served no purpose to him and his annoyances to the girl\r\n     continued. Then Scott, who had been constantly watched by the Klan,\r\n     whose number is legion, and whose eye is all seeing and whose methods\r\n     of gathering information are not known to the alien world, was\r\n     apprehended and punished in the same manner Doctor Paul had been\r\n     dealt with. He was taken to the woods and guarded until nightfall.\r\n     His captors during this time treated him with kindness and\r\n     consideration. They provided him with food and fruit to eat and ice\r\n     water to drink. During the day he was questioned and admitted all the\r\n     charges the Klan had accused him of. The judgment of the Klan was\r\n     that he was to be given ten lashes across the bare back and that he\r\n     was to be tarred and feathered and brought to Beaumont to deliver two\r\n     messages, one to Doctor Paul that he must comply with the decision of\r\n     the Klan that he should leave town, but that he must return for trial\r\n     at the proper time. The other message was to another person that the\r\n     Klan would not allow the technicalities to cheat justice any further\r\n     in this case.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement concludes by an attack on Scott's army record, and the\r\nallegation that he had served a prison sentence, adding:\r\n\r\n     \"Yet he poses to the gullible public and sensational newspapers as a\r\n     patriot and a hero. All these things the eyes of the unknown have\r\n     seen and their ears have heard. We cannot be deceived and justice\r\n     will no longer be mocked.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately following the publication of this frank statement, \"Emperor\"\r\nSimmons revoked the charter of the Beaumont Klan, and announced his\r\nintention of sending investigators to Texas for the purpose of looking\r\ninto the various cases that had been reported where men in disguise had\r\ntaken the law into their own hands. Up to the time that this was written,\r\nhowever, no such investigations have been made or attempted, so far as the\r\npublic has been informed through the press.\r\n\r\nThe American people should view with alarm the propagation of any\r\norganization, the result of which has been the establishment of _one_ unit\r\nwhich assumes to itself the secret regulation of law enforcement. Yet,\r\nwhen one studies the ritual and the oath of the Ku Klux Klan but little\r\nblame can be attached to the men in Beaumont for obeying what seemed to\r\nthem the teachings of the \"Invisible Empire.\" They had sworn to \"use any\r\nand all justifiable means and methods\" and, taking the literal\r\nconstruction of the oath, they saw what appeared to them a bad condition\r\nexisting in their community, which they proceeded to rectify. The prime\r\nresponsibility for the Beaumont case rests upon William J. Simmons for\r\nhaving solicited men to take an obligation that is in itself a violation\r\nof the letter and spirit of the laws of this country. His action in\r\nrevoking the charter was forced by the publicity given to the case, and by\r\nthe frankness and openness of his followers in assuming the blame for\r\ntheir acts. Speaking in ordinary street parlance, the action of the\r\n\"Emperor\" was merely \"passing the buck\" to his own people who had been\r\n\"caught with the goods.\" When men are given a dangerous explosive to play\r\nwith, the blame for the explosion that follows should be placed upon the\r\nperson or corporation that gave it to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED LEGAL REMEDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task of ridding the United States of the \"Invisible Empire\" will not\r\nbe an easy matter. The people are prone to wait until the horse has\r\ncompletely disappeared before they begin to look after the security of the\r\nbarn door. Until public sentiment is thoroughly aroused over the dangerous\r\npossibilities of an \"Invisible Empire,\" such as is now being developed, it\r\nis unlikely that even the first steps will be taken toward suppressing it.\r\nThe idea is so foreign to all the established order in this country that\r\npeople will be slow in realizing what it is all about. Appreciating this\r\nfact and knowing that I possessed but limited facilities for bringing the\r\nmatter to public attention, I felt prompted to turn over to the _New York\r\nWorld_ all the information I possessed, and have that great newspaper\r\ninaugurate a nation-wide investigation followed by a publicity campaign\r\nthat would make the \"Invisible Empire\" visible.\r\n\r\nExposure of a system, however, marks but the first step in eliminating\r\nthat system. Publicity must be followed up by official action aimed at the\r\naccomplishment of concrete results, for unless this is done, the public\r\nmind is soon diverted from the subject, and the exposure becomes merely a\r\nnewspaper episode. In the present instance, exposure of the \"Invisible\r\nEmpire,\" without legal action, will have the effect of advertising it\r\nwithout harming it in the slightest degree--and swelling its ranks with\r\nthousands of new recruits.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the authorities of this country should use every available\r\npiece of legal machinery to stop the propaganda, and new laws should be\r\nimmediately enacted rendering it impossible to promote such a scheme in\r\nthis country in the future. It must be remembered that the men who have\r\nlaunched this proposition have built up a large organization, many of the\r\nmembers of which are fanatics. The promoters have already seen the\r\npossibilities of the scheme as a business proposition; they have the names\r\nof the present members, which can be used again; they have a fully\r\nequipped plant for future operations; and in the event the Ku Klux scheme\r\nfails, they will probably try another one along similar lines. The system\r\nitself must be destroyed and prohibited from further action, either in its\r\npresent costume or in any other. Several lines of action suggest\r\nthemselves, but they may be broadly classified under the two heads:\r\nFederal and State. There should be concurrent action on the part of these\r\ntwo governments.\r\n\r\nI believe that Congress should enact legislation directed specifically at\r\norganizations of the character of the \"Invisible Empire.\" It should be\r\nprovided that all organizations, secret or open, engaged in promoting\r\nracial or religious discord, should be prevented from sending their\r\nliterature through the mails. The statute should be broad enough to\r\ninclude any kind of organized attempt to stir up class hatred, and\r\nofficials of all such organizations should be held to strict\r\naccountability for the accuracy of statements sent through the mails.\r\nMisrepresentation of facts as to national, state or local conditions\r\nshould be the basis of Federal action in breaking up such organizations.\r\nIn the exercise of a national police power, Congress should be able to\r\ngive the Federal Government the right to act against the heads of\r\norganizations, as well as a few individuals. In the cases that have come\r\nto light where there has been acknowledged violation of law by local\r\nKlans, Simmons has side-stepped responsibility by revoking and suspending\r\ncharters. If Congress will pass legislation declaring that national\r\nofficers of secret organizations are responsible for acts of their\r\nsubordinates, and are subject to indictment, an important step will be\r\ntaken in the right direction.\r\n\r\nSince the chief asset of the \"Invisible Empire\" is its secrecy, Congress\r\nshould pass an act providing that all secret orders or societies using the\r\nUnited States mails or engaged in the business of interstate commerce--as\r\nthe \"Invisible Empire\" undoubtedly is--should be required to furnish the\r\nGovernment with a list of names of their members. The list should be\r\nrequired to be in duplicate, one copy to be placed on file, for public\r\ninspection, in the office of the local postmaster, while the other copy\r\nshould be placed on file in Washington. The Government should also have\r\nthe right to inspect all books of account, showing funds that have been\r\nderived from members either by interstate commerce or by the use of the\r\nUnited States mails. This removal of secrecy would, to a considerable\r\nextent, lessen the danger of Ku Kluxism as a political force, and\r\nrequiring publicity as far as membership rosters is concerned would\r\nmaterially aid in making the system harmless. I am quite sure that a\r\npublicity statute would not work any great hardship on the existing\r\nstandard fraternal orders for most of them have a yearly printed roster\r\nfor distribution.\r\n\r\nUnder the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution, the Attorney-General of the United States can maintain\r\nactions against the \"Invisible Empire\" on account of its activities in\r\nTexas, and have no doubt that an official investigation of alleged\r\noutrages would show some interesting facts. In order to make the matter\r\neffective, however, the investigation must be gone into very carefully and\r\nall of the facts uncovered. In August, 1921, the United States District\r\nAttorney in Chicago announced that he intended to investigate the Ku Klux\r\nKlan. In a few days, according to newspaper reports, he stated that he had\r\nbeen shown the charter of incorporation and other literature of the\r\norganization, and that he could not discover anything upon which he could\r\nbase legal action. The charter of the organization does not tell all the\r\nfacts, as has been demonstrated in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the action of the Federal Government, the States can do\r\nsome valuable work in stamping out Ku Kluxism, and preventing both the\r\npresent \"Invisible Empire\" and its future imitators from operating. The\r\n\"Invisible Empire\" is known legally as the \"Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,\r\nInc.\" and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia. So far\r\nas has been published in the newspapers, the only State in the Union where\r\nit has been granted a license to do business outside of its home state,\r\nhas been in Indiana, where its charter was filed in August, 1921. In every\r\nState where it has not filed its charter and complied with the corporation\r\nlaws it has no legal standing whatever. Actions could be brought by the\r\nAttorneys-General of the various States restraining the Klan from further\r\noperation and also indictments might lie against the promoters for\r\noperating without compliance with the law.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it can be conveniently done, the legislatures of the States\r\nshould enact various laws for the purpose of killing Ku Kluxism, laws\r\ndirected against membership corporations stirring up religious and racial\r\nprejudice, against secret membership, against unwarranted interference\r\nwith the law-enforcing branches of the Government, and against going about\r\nthe community in disguise. More stringent laws should also be enacted\r\nproviding for the registration of foreign membership corporations seeking\r\nto do business from another State, especially where money is taken from\r\nthe public. If the passage of \"Blue-Sky\" laws has had the effect of\r\nprotecting the public from being victimized by all kinds of stock-selling\r\nschemes, surely legislation could easily be enacted to carefully\r\nscrutinize all alleged fraternal orders.\r\n\r\nAs to permitting foreign membership corporations to do business in a\r\nState, it should be enacted that before being permitted to engage in the\r\nbusiness of soliciting members from whom initiation fees or \"donations\"\r\nare to be secured, the corporation should be required to file with the\r\nSecretary of State a sworn statement of all its national officers, its\r\nplans for doing business, a copy of its charter of incorporation, its\r\nconstitution and laws, and, where agents are employed to canvas for\r\nmembers it should be specified what compensation they are to be paid.\r\nThese agents should be licensed by the State as the \"Blue Laws\" require\r\nthe licensing of stock salesmen. The organization should, furthermore, be\r\nrequired to file a bond with the Secretary of State insuring the good\r\nbehavior of the organization while engaged in business in the State, and\r\nit should be specified that the bond be forfeited should any local branch\r\nbe guilty of committing a lawless act, in which case, also, the right of\r\nthe corporation to do business in the State should automatically be\r\nterminated. No foreign corporation which permits its members to go about,\r\nin other States, disguised should be permitted to enter. After having\r\ncomplied with the foregoing provisions, the act should further provide\r\nthat at stated intervals the secretary of each local branch be required to\r\nmake two copies of the roster of membership of his branch, filing one copy\r\nwith the county clerk of his county, and mailing one copy to the Secretary\r\nof State. These two copies should be open for public inspection at all\r\ntimes. In the event that the local branch fails or refuses to file its\r\nroster, the right of the national organization to do business in the State\r\nshould automatically terminate.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of safeguard to the community, every State in the United\r\nStates should have a statute enacted along the lines of the Tennessee Ku\r\nKlux act (Sections 6668, Shannons Code _et seq._) which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"6668. If any person or persons, masked or in disguise, shall prowl,\r\n     or travel, or ride, or walk through the country or towns of this\r\n     State, to the disturbance of the peace, or to the alarming of the\r\n     citizens of any portion of this State, on conviction thereof (they)\r\n     shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five\r\n     hundred dollars, and imprisoned in the county jail of the county\r\n     wherein convicted, at the discretion of the jury trying the case.\r\n\r\n     \"6669. If any person or persons, disguised or in mask, by day or by\r\n     night, shall enter upon the premises of another, or demand entrance\r\n     or admission into the house or inclosure of any citizen of this\r\n     State, it shall be considered _prima facie_ that his or her intention\r\n     is to commit a felony, and such demand shall be deemed an assault\r\n     with an intent to commit a felony, and the person or persons so\r\n     offending, shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment in the\r\n     penitentiary not less than ten years nor more than twenty years.\r\n\r\n     \"6670. If any person or persons, so prowling, traveling, riding, or\r\n     walking through the towns or country of this State, masked or in\r\n     disguise, shall or may assault another with a deadly weapon, he or\r\n     they shall be deemed guilty of an assault with intent to commit\r\n     murder in the first degree, and, on conviction thereof, shall suffer\r\n     death by hanging; provided that the jury trying the case may\r\n     substitute imprisonment in the penitentiary for a period of not less\r\n     than ten years nor more than twenty-one years.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with this Tennessee statute, it is interesting to note that\r\nthe leading case, reported in the State, based on the act fully sustained\r\nthe statute. In the case of Walpole against the State, 9 Baxter 369,\r\ndelivered in 1878 by a Supreme Court composed entirely of Democrats, with\r\nseveral Confederate soldiers the court held:\r\n\r\n     \"It is apparent that the object of this statute was to repress a\r\n     great evil which arose in this country after the war, and which grew\r\n     to be an offense of frequent occurrence, that of evil-minded and\r\n     mischievous persons disguising themselves to terrify or to wrong\r\n     those who happened to be the objects of their wrath or resentment.\r\n     This was a kind of mob law, enforced sometimes by a multitude of\r\n     vagabonds, who grew to be a great terror to the people and placed\r\n     human life and property at the mercy of bad men, whose crimes could\r\n     scarcely ever be punished because of the disguises under which they\r\n     were perpetrated.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing its opinion the court said:\r\n\r\n     \"The penalties of a violation of this law are severe, but they have\r\n     proved themselves wholesome in the partial suppression already of one\r\n     of the greatest of the disturbing elements of social order in this\r\n     State. Affirm the judgment.\"\r\n\r\nIf every State in the Union will pass a law along similar lines to the\r\nabove Tennessee statute, there will be no Ku Klux parades, no midnight\r\nburnings of the fiery cross, and no repetition of the tar and feathers\r\noccurrences that have been prevalent in the State of Texas. I think that\r\nthere should be a modification, however, of the Tennessee statute, making\r\nit a misdemeanor to go about disguised in the daytime, and a felony at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThere are already enough laws on the statute books of the States against\r\nmob violence, assault, murder, mayhem and other crimes, and the\r\nenforcement of these laws will go a long way toward killing the \"masked\r\nterror.\" No law, however, is enforceable unless public sentiment is behind\r\nit, and if the public officials, especially the sheriff's forces and the\r\ncity police departments are filled with men sworn to obey\r\n\"unconditionally\" the orders of the \"Invisible Empire\" and to use \"any and\r\nall justifiable means and methods\" in the accomplishment of the Ku Klux\r\nprogram even public sentiment can do but little. In this connection, I\r\nwant to call attention to an editorial which appeared in the\r\n_Searchlight_, the official organ of the Ku Klux Klan, under date of July\r\n23, 1921, which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"It is sometimes amusing to note the ridiculous situations which\r\n     ignorance oftentimes leads men, even of more than average\r\n     intelligence. For instance, it doubtless is amusing to members of the\r\n     Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to hear a judge instruct a grand jury to\r\n     probe that organization because of its 'lawlessness and\r\n     un-Americanism,' when they know that anywhere from a third to\r\n     one-half the members of the grand jury are members of the K. K. K.,\r\n     and know that the good judge is all unconsciously making an ass of\r\n     himself by attempting to express an opinion on a subject that he\r\n     knows nothing about.\"\r\n\r\nThe attempt of the Ku Klux Klan to enlist the police authorities in its\r\norganization and bind them with its vicious oath is the most serious count\r\nin the indictment against the system. The potentialities are far-reaching,\r\nand unless the organization is checked in that direction, the consequences\r\nmust necessarily be grave. How the situation, in that respect should be\r\nmet, I leave to others.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing suggestions are merely intended to set people to thinking,\r\nand from these ideas may come better suggestions as to the proper methods\r\nwhich should be pursued in checking and eliminating the rising tide of Ku\r\nKluxism. It should be carefully remembered, however, that the task of\r\nwiping out Ku Kluxism will not be an easy matter. The organization is\r\nheaded by a shrewd individual who has already tasted the sweets of\r\nsuccess. All the energy that desperation and cunning can devise will be\r\nused in resisting any effort that will be made to suppress the\r\norganization. Behind this individual are thousands of fanatics, who for\r\none reason or another believe that this \"noble cause\" is the salvation of\r\nthe country. While fully one-half of the men who have parted with ten\r\ndollars went into the organization out of curiosity, and will probably\r\ndrop it, the other element will do all it can to keep the movement alive,\r\neven in spite of the exposure made by the _New York World_.\r\n\r\nBehind the publicity of the _World_ should therefore come the united\r\nefforts of every agency in America which discountenances such a scheme.\r\nEvery organization engaged in civic work should bring all the available\r\npressure to bear upon the legislative branches of both State and Federal\r\ngovernments to secure the enactment of suitable laws against Ku Kluxism.\r\nThen when adequate laws are secured, the power of public opinion should\r\ndemand that these laws be enforced and irresponsible and secret\r\ngovernment, private regulation of the public peace, interference with\r\nlaw-enforcing authorities, and class hatred and prejudice should be\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nHalf-hearted measures will do no good. Unless the American people are\r\nprepared to deal vigorously with Ku Kluxism, they may as well turn over to\r\nthe system the free and untrammelled right to carry out its secret\r\nprogram, because mild measures will have but little effect in stemming the\r\ntide this movement must inevitably bring should its propaganda be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE _World's_ EXPOSURE\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned over to the _New York World_ early in July, 1921, the facts and\r\ndocumentary evidence I had in my possession, and initiated the exposure\r\nwith the understanding that the paper would make a complete investigation\r\nbefore printing a single story. Under the direction of Mr. Herbert Bayard\r\nSwope, the Executive Editor and Mr. William Preston Beazell, Assistant\r\nManaging Editor, the investigation was immediately begun. Mr. Rowland\r\nThomas was assigned to handle the investigation and direct the efforts of\r\nthe force which began working on it. This work was done for two months,\r\nduring which time I acted as an assistant to Mr. Thomas.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 1921, the _World_ began the publication of its series\r\nexposing the Ku Klux Klan. Associated with the _World_ were thirty other\r\nnewspapers covering practically the entire United States, and for\r\ntwenty-one days the exposure of Ku Kluxism held over five million\r\nnewspaper readers spellbound in their absorbing interest in the story of\r\nthe organization. The series comprised twenty-one articles, and occupied\r\nthe front page in the _World_ to the exclusion of every big piece of news\r\nof national or international importance.\r\n\r\nThe exposure covered in the main facts and documents which I submitted to\r\nthe paper. It fully substantiated and vindicated the charges made by me in\r\nmy letter of withdrawal that the organization was un-American, that it was\r\nbeing propagated by spreading religious and racial hatred, that it was a\r\nmoney-making scheme for the benefit of a few insiders, that its oath was\r\nillegal and its ritual a sacrilege, and the various other matters referred\r\nto by me which are set forth in my letter in a previous chapter. With but\r\nfew exceptions the entire American press agreed with my position in the\r\nmatter by endorsing the _World's_ exposure, and a vast number of the most\r\nprominent men and women in America publicly expressed themselves as\r\ngratified over the action of the _World_ in showing up the Ku Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting developments made by the _World_ in the course\r\nof its exposure was its publication of facts collected by the paper in\r\nconnection with the relations of Edward Young Clarke, the Imperial Kleagle\r\nand head of the Southern Publicity Bureau, and his business associate Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Tyler.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, September 10, 1921, four days after the _World_ commenced the\r\npublication of its series, Mrs. Tyler arrived in New York and engaged an\r\nelaborate suite of rooms in one of the most conspicuous hotels in the\r\ncity. She had obviously been sent by Clarke for the purpose of securing\r\nfavorable publicity for the Klan, and immediately upon her arrival gave a\r\nstory to an evening paper as \"bait\" for the Sunday papers. Although her\r\nmission was but a partial success, she did succeed in getting her picture\r\nin a few papers, together with prepared statements deploring the \"unjust\r\nattacks\" that had been made on the organization, and expounding its \"noble\r\naspirations.\" She was particularly emphatic on the proposition that one of\r\nthe main objects of the Klan was to \"protect the purity and chastity of\r\nwomanhood and to preserve the sanctity of the American home.\" She stated\r\nthat women were to be admitted to membership, that she had been made the\r\nfirst woman member, and that she would have charge of the women's\r\ndepartment. While she was in New York \"Emperor\" Simmons issued one of his\r\ntypically bombastic proclamations, composed in pure Simmonsese,\r\ndesignating Mrs. Tyler as his \"Grand Chief of Staff.\" This proclamation\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"To all Genii, Grand Dragons and Hydras of Realms, Grand Goblins and\r\n     Kleagles of Domains, Grand Titans and Furies of Provinces, Giants,\r\n     Exalted Cyclops and Terrors of Cantons, and to all citizens of the\r\n     Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in the name of our\r\n     valiant and venerated dead, I affectionately greet you:\r\n\r\n     \"In view of our Nation's need and as an additional force in helping\r\n     on the great work of conserving, protecting and making effective the\r\n     great principles of our Anglo-Saxon civilization and American ideals\r\n     and institutions, the Imperial Kloncilium, in regular session\r\n     assembled, after deliberate care and earnest prayer, decided that\r\n     there shall be established within the bounds and under the supreme\r\n     authority and government of the Invisible Empire an organization that\r\n     will admit the splendid women of our great national commonwealth, who\r\n     are now citizens with us in directing the affairs of the Nation.\r\n     Which decision of the Imperial Kloncilium I have officially ratified\r\n     after serious, careful and devoted consideration of all matters and\r\n     things involved by this move.\r\n\r\n     \"In view of the foregoing, I hereby officially declare and proclaim\r\n     that such organization does now exist in prospect. Plans, methods,\r\n     ritualism and regulations of same are now in process of formation and\r\n     will be perfected at an early date and officially announced.\r\n\r\n     \"I do further proclaim that in order to have the proper assistance in\r\n     the formation and perfecting of this organization, I have this day\r\n     and date selected and officially appointed Mary Elizabeth Tyler of\r\n     Atlanta, Fulton County, Ga., to be my Grand Chief of Staff, to have\r\n     immediate charge of work pertaining to said woman's organization\r\n     under my authority and direction.\r\n\r\n     \"Further information will be duly and officially communicated from\r\n     time to time.\r\n\r\n     \"Done in the Aulic of His Majesty, Imperial Wizard, Emperor of the\r\n     Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in the Imperial City\r\n     of Atlanta, Commonwealth of Georgia, United States of America, on\r\n     this, the ninth day of the ninth month of the year of our Lord, 1921.\r\n\r\n     \"Duly signed and sealed by His Majesty.\r\n\r\n          \"WILLIAM JOSEPH SIMMONS,\r\n              \"Imperial Wizard.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tyler went back to Atlanta, complacently happy in the proud\r\nconsciousness that she had \"pulled\" a wonderful piece of publicity.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, September 19, 1921, however, the _World_ and its associated\r\nnewspapers printed a story that sent a shock of consternation into the\r\nhearts of the entire Ku Klux organization, stripped the mask from Mrs.\r\nTyler and Clarke, and sent a ripple of merriment and disgust from one end\r\nof the country to another.\r\n\r\nThe story, which has been fully verified by the _New York World_, read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     (_Special Despatch to The World from a Staff Correspondent._)\r\n\r\n     \"ATLANTA, September 18.--The _World's_ exposure of Ku Klux took an\r\n     astounding turn here yesterday when a staff correspondent obtained\r\n     evidence of the truth of rumors which have long been matters of\r\n     gossip in Atlanta. This evidence proves that:\r\n\r\n     \"1. A few days prior to October 31, 1919, Edward Young Clarke of\r\n     Atlanta, who is at present, by appointment of Imperial Wizard\r\n     Simmons, the Imperial Kleagle or boss organizer of the Ku Klux Klan,\r\n     and Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler of Atlanta, who recently, also by\r\n     appointment and proclamation of Imperial Wizard Simmons, was made\r\n     Grand Chief of the newly formed woman's division of Kluxters, were\r\n     arrested at midnight and in their sleeping garments, in a notorious\r\n     underworld resort at 185 South Pryor Street, Atlanta, run by Mrs.\r\n     Tyler, and taken to the city prison, where Clarke was immediately\r\n     placed in a cell and where Mrs. Tyler, after being searched, was also\r\n     locked up.\r\n\r\n     \"2. The two prisoners gave assumed names, as 'Jim Slaton' and 'Mrs.\r\n     Carroll,' respectively, and being unable to obtain bail at that hour,\r\n     were imprisoned until morning, when Francis Clarke, now managing and\r\n     then city editor of an Atlanta newspaper and brother of Edward Young\r\n     Clarke, now Imperial Kleagle of the Ku Klux Klan, appeared at the\r\n     city prison and by giving $50 bonds effected the release of both\r\n     prisoners.\r\n\r\n     TRIED UNDER REAL NAMES\r\n\r\n     \"3. On October 31, 1919, 'Jim Slaton' and 'Mrs. Carroll' were brought\r\n     into the Recorder's Court in Atlanta for trial on charges of\r\n     disorderly conduct. After consultation with Policewoman Davis, who\r\n     had participated in the raid and arrests, Recorder George E. Johnson\r\n     ordered the prisoners docketed under their real names of Edward Young\r\n     Clarke and Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler, and under those names they were\r\n     tried, found guilty of disorderly conduct and sentenced to pay $5.00\r\n     fines or each work twelve days on the streets or other public works\r\n     of Atlanta. They paid the fines.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Additional charges of possessing whiskey, based on the finding\r\n     and seizure of such liquor by the police in the Pryor Street resort\r\n     at the time of the raid, stood against both Clarke and Mrs. Tyler,\r\n     but were dismissed when J. Q. Jett of Atlanta, the son-in-law of the\r\n     Mrs. Tyler who is feminine chief of the Ku Klux Klan, came into the\r\n     Recorder's Court, claimed ownership of the seized whiskey and was\r\n     fined $25 by the court.\r\n\r\n     \"5. Clarke, Imperial Kleagle of the Ku Klux Klan, in its drive for\r\n     $10 'one hundred per cent' Americans, consecrated and baptized to\r\n     uphold and enforce the law and protect the sanctity of American homes\r\n     and the chastity of American womanhood, at this moment stands on the\r\n     public records of the Fulton County (Ga.) courts and the Atlanta City\r\n     police courts as a man who has deserted and abandoned his wife and\r\n     child and has not to this day denied these charges.\r\n\r\n     TESTIMONY GIVEN BY POLICE\r\n\r\n     \"Imperial Kleagle Clarke and Mrs. Tyler were arrested at midnight in\r\n     their bedclothes in the resort, according to the testimony of the\r\n     witnesses, Policeman Jameson, since dead, and Policewomen Davis and\r\n     Voss, still on active duty. The resort was at 185 South Pryor Street,\r\n     corner of Fair Street, and it was operated by Mrs. Tyler. The raid\r\n     occurred a few days prior to October 31, 1919, which is the date of\r\n     the hearing before Recorder Johnson, at which the verdicts of guilty\r\n     were rendered and sentences imposed. The numbers of the cases of the\r\n     City of Atlanta versus E. Y. Clarke and the City of Atlanta versus\r\n     Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler on the Recorder's docket are 17,005 and 17,006,\r\n     and the page number of the 1919 docket upon which they are listed is\r\n     305.\r\n\r\n     \"Most surprising in view of Clarke's efforts then in progress to make\r\n     America dry by collecting funds to help the Anti-Saloon League is the\r\n     fact that the police found whiskey in the house and seized it.\r\n\r\n     \"But next morning as stated the super-Prohibitionist and the Ku Klux\r\n     feminist were absolved from the legal responsibility involved in the\r\n     discovery of liquor on the premises when Jett claimed the whiskey and\r\n     paid the fine of $25.\"\r\n\r\nThis story created one of the greatest sensations of the whole exposure,\r\nand was a blow to the entire propagation department. One Kleagle, A. B.\r\nBate of New Jersey, wired to \"Emperor\" Simmons demanding the immediate\r\nremoval of the offending pair. In reply to his telegram he was summarily\r\ndismissed as a Kleagle by Mrs. Tyler herself. For a few days chaos reigned\r\nin the Ku Klux Kamp. Clarke at first denied the truth of the story of his\r\narrest, then made excuses, and then sent in his resignation to the\r\n\"Emperor.\" Mrs. Tyler issued a statement branding Clarke as a \"weak-kneed\r\nquitter,\" and repudiating him entirely. Simmons, knowing that the pair of\r\nprofessional publicity uplifters had made his organization declined to\r\ntake any action against either of them, declaring that he had heard rumors\r\nof the story, but attached no credence to it.\r\n\r\nAside from showing up the records of a precious pair of \"uplifters,\" the\r\nClarke-Tyler episode has no great bearing upon the menace of Ku Kluxism.\r\nBut the aftermath of the story's publication developed two sinister things\r\nthat make necessary its introduction into this narrative. One of these was\r\nthe printing in the _Searchlight_ of a violent article which was\r\npractically a call to arms against the Catholics and others who were\r\nattacking the Klan. The other was the theft of the police records in the\r\ncity of Atlanta, covering the cases against Clarke and Mrs. Tyler,\r\nobviously an inside job and showing the extent to which Ku Kluxism had\r\ncontrol of the public officials of that city.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary article in the _Searchlight_ from the pen of one Carl F.\r\nHutcheson was headed \"American Patriots, Hark!\"\r\n\r\n     \"American patriots! The womanhood of this country has been criminally\r\n     assaulted in the most diabolical and satanic manner known to the\r\n     human race--_an attempt_ has been made to ruin the character of a\r\n     good woman by the most dastardly methods of current times. That\r\n     dastardly, cowardly and infamous instrument of murder comprises\r\n     certain daily and powerful newspapers of this country!\r\n\r\n     \"Murder! Yes, murder of the worst type! Those murderers who wield the\r\n     pen, and strew infamy throughout every nook and corner of this nation\r\n     by their millions of papers with their thunder-bolts of publicity\r\n     against fair woman! Every word written in opposition to a great\r\n     patriotic woman of Atlanta reeks with the blood of a grand innocent\r\n     lady of Southern birth and standing. A woman's character destroyed\r\n     (only temporarily), but that arch enemy of Americanism, the _New\r\n     York World_, and its string of subsidized, patronizing, fawning and\r\n     syncophantic sheets through America, commonly called 'newspapers,'\r\n     but which are nothing more than organs, _and specialists as character\r\n     assassins of the most despicable, contemptible and depraved sort_!\r\n\r\n     \"The unwarranted murderous attack sprung from the brain of Pulitzer,\r\n     who disgraces the name of his great father.

Had the so-called editor\r\n     above referred to, and his blasphemous sheet, had any measure of\r\n     fairness, justice, and just common canine decency, an effort to\r\n     materialize effort in its opposition to the Knights of the Ku Klux\r\n     Klan, he and his corps would never have focused their salacious and\r\n     foul guns upon a lone, defenseless woman! I said alone? Defenseless?\r\n     Not yet.

We are ready!\"\r\n\r\nThe theft of the records from the police court occurred about ten days\r\nafter the _World_ had printed the Clarke-Tyler story. The representative\r\nof the paper, in getting the evidence of the arrest of the two persons had\r\nprocured certified copies of the record, and had personally seen the\r\noriginal entries in the books. Upon going back again to look over the\r\nbooks, he found that all traces of the original record had been\r\nobliterated, the pages having been cut out and removed. The records were\r\nsupposedly in the custody of the proper public officials who were\r\nresponsible for their safety and their preservation from mutilation. No\r\nother organization aside from the Ku Klux Klan would have had the\r\nslightest interest in destroying the records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE KLAN BEFORE CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress was not in session when the _World_ began the publication of its\r\narticles, and did not resume its sessions until the close of September,\r\n1921. Many of the members of both houses were in Washington, however, and\r\nthey followed the exposure of the Kluxes with close attention. Senators\r\nand Representatives expressed themselves as being gratified that the work\r\nwas being carried on, and it became evident that when Congress resumed its\r\nsession, there would be several resolutions introduced demanding an\r\ninvestigation of the Ku Klux organization. This proved to be true, and\r\nresolutions were introduced immediately after the two houses assembled by\r\nRepresentatives James A. Gallivan, of Massachusetts, Thomas J. Ryan of New\r\nYork, Leonidas C. Dyer, of Missouri, and Peter F. Tague, of Massachusetts.\r\nAs these resolutions were very much alike, the following, introduced by\r\nRepresentative Tague will be the only one reproduced:\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS, There is being organized within the United States an\r\n     anti-American organization known as the Ku Klux Klan, the objects and\r\n     purposes of which are the exile and suppression of persons, members\r\n     of certain races and religious sects, and\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS, The accomplishment of such objects and purposes is in\r\n     direct contravention of Articles I, XIII and XV of the Constitution\r\n     of the United States, and\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS, The organization known as the Ku Klux Klan has in more than\r\n     one hundred instances been charged with unlawful seizure, abduction,\r\n     trial and punishment of certain free citizens and residents of the\r\n     United States, and\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS, Such seizure, abduction, trial and punishment is a\r\n     usurpation of legally constituted authority and in direct\r\n     contravention of Articles IV, V and VI of the Constitution of the\r\n     United States; therefore be it\r\n\r\n     \"RESOLVED, That the Speaker of the House of Representatives be\r\n     directed to appoint a special committee of five members of the House\r\n     of Representatives, which committee is authorized and directed to\r\n     proceed at once with an investigation of the organization, purposes\r\n     and all matters connected with the Ku Klux Klan and to report its\r\n     findings to the House of Representatives at the earliest practical\r\n     day, together with such recommendations as it may see fit to make\r\n     concerning the Ku Klux Klan, if any, and for this purpose the\r\n     committee is authorized to send for persons, books and papers; to\r\n     administer oaths; to employ a stenographer at a cost not exceeding\r\n     $1.00 per printed page to report such hearings as may be had in\r\n     connection with any subject which may be pending before said\r\n     committee, the expenses thereof to be paid out of the contingent fund\r\n     of the House of Representatives, and that said committee may sit\r\n     during the sessions or recess of the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the resolutions were referred to the Rules Committee of the House\r\nfor the purpose of making a preliminary examination as to the advisability\r\nof appointing a special committee to investigate the Klan. This committee,\r\nof which Representative Philip P. Campbell, of Kansas was Chairman, met\r\non Tuesday, November 11, 1921, for the purpose of examining witnesses.\r\n\"Emperor\" Simmons had been previously invited, and appeared with counsel.\r\n\r\nRowland Thomas, appearing in behalf of the _New York World_, was the first\r\nwitness examined. He placed before the committee the entire facts that had\r\nbeen collected by the paper, showing specifically that the Ku Klux\r\norganization in some portions of the country had been guilty of\r\ncirculating anti-religious and anti-racial propaganda; that in some cases\r\nacts of violence had been admitted by the local Klans; and that the\r\nproposition was in all essentials a money-making scheme. Covering every\r\nphase of the system, Mr. Thomas concluded his statement as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We found also that they boasted or declared that they were setting\r\n     up an invisible empire here in the United States. We found that their\r\n     chief man had taken the title of emperor and that he issued imperial\r\n     and secret decrees from an imperial palace. We found also, having\r\n     secured a copy of their oath, that every man who joined this order\r\n     pledged himself to obey without question all the instructions of the\r\n     emperor, who had been elected for life. We found that severe\r\n     penalties were threatened to him if he failed ever in obedience. We\r\n     found that part of this oath was a pledge of impenetrable secrecy\r\n     surrounding all the doings of the Klan. We found that each member\r\n     promised to keep at all costs, even that of life, in the face of any\r\n     coercion, persecution, or punishment, all secrets of the Klan and all\r\n     knowledge of the Klan committed to him, with only four exceptions. He\r\n     was not obliged to keep to himself a violation of the oath of the\r\n     Klan, treason against the United States of America, malicious murder,\r\n     and rape. Those four secrets, apparently, he could give up to other\r\n     persons, three of them the crimes, supposedly, he was at liberty to\r\n     reveal to peace officers and judicial officers of the United States\r\n     Government. All others, as far as the phraseology of the oath can be\r\n     read, he was to keep to himself. They belong to the Klan and to the\r\n     invisible empire and not to the United States of America.\r\n\r\n     \"We found them boasting that they had succeeded in securing as\r\n     members bound by this oath and made citizens in this invisible empire\r\n     many men who are also officials of the visible, constituted\r\n     Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"'Emperor' Simmons more than once made statements that Members of the\r\n     Congress of the United States--both Representatives and\r\n     Senators--belonged to his invisible empire, and therefore were under\r\n     his imperial orders. He boasted that governors, mayors, and other\r\n     administrative officers, members of city councils, were citizens of\r\n     this invisible government, and that sheriffs, policemen, police\r\n     chiefs were citizens of the invisible empire and that judges on the\r\n     bench were members of it.\r\n\r\n     \"The statement has been made publicly in print that it amused a\r\n     Klansman when he read in the press that a judge had charged a grand\r\n     jury to investigate the Klan, because all Klansmen knew that a\r\n     substantial part of the membership of that grand jury would be\r\n     Klansmen; that the judge was a joke in making such a suggestion of\r\n     investigation.\"\r\n\r\nC. Anderson Wright, who had formerly been a King Kleagle, was also\r\nexamined and verified in many instances the facts that had been presented\r\nby the _World_, although his testimony in some respects lost its value by\r\nexaggeration of financial estimates of the Imperial Palace. He assisted,\r\nhowever, in verifying the fact that the Atlanta organization had never\r\nundertaken any charitable or public work, and appeared to be more of a\r\nfinancial scheme for the benefit of the insiders of the movement.\r\n\r\nPost-Office Inspector O. B. Williamson furnished the committee facts and\r\nfigures relating to the financial and business side of the organization.\r\nMr. Williamson had been to Atlanta, talked with Clarke and Mrs. Tyler, and\r\nhad gone through the books of the Klan. Among the first bubbles to burst\r\nwas that of the purchase of Simmons $25,000 home on Atlanta's fashionable\r\nPeachtree Street. It had been claimed by Simmons & Company that this home\r\nhad been presented the \"Emperor\" by admiring members of the Klan, the\r\nmoney constituting the purchase price having been \"donated\" in small\r\namounts ranging from twenty-five cents to one dollar. According to the\r\nreal facts, Mr. Williamson showed the arrangements for payments to have\r\nbeen as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Ten thousand dollars was paid in cash, and one note maturing October\r\n     15, 1921, was given for $15,500. The deed was made in the name of E.\r\n     Y. Clarke. The ten thousand dollar cash payment consisted of $1000\r\n     secured by subscription from Klansmen, $5000 from the Klan treasury,\r\n     and $5000 advanced by Clark and Mrs. Tyler.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared from a statement of E. Y. Clarke, quoted by Mr. Williamson,\r\nthat this use of Klan funds for private purposes was part of a\r\npress-agent scheme to add to the dignity and apparently high standing of\r\nSimmons, as the latter was living in an unpretentious part of the city in\r\na house not in keeping with his important position as \"Emperor,\" and it\r\nwas \"therefore in the interest of the Klan to put him in a better home and\r\none that would reflect credit on the organization.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson also showed how Klan funds were diverted for private\r\npurposes in the purchase of Lanier University, introducing a statement of\r\nClarke as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The Lanier University has existed for only a few years. It has been\r\n     a Baptist institution of learning, operating under a charter granted\r\n     by the State of Georgia and controlled by a board of trustees of\r\n     fifteen men. Some time in July, this year, representatives of this\r\n     university approached Colonel Simmons and myself with a proposition\r\n     to purchase the university outright and assume, of course, its debts,\r\n     which amounted to $50,000. We had our attorney to investigate the\r\n     matter fully and we found the indebtedness much larger than claimed.\r\n     We therefore rejected the proposition to purchase and submitted a\r\n     counter proposition. The counter proposition was accepted and was in\r\n     substance as follows: First, that the managing board elect Colonel\r\n     Simmons president of the university. Second, that they agree to make\r\n     it nonsectarian. Third, that the present existing board elect new\r\n     trustees, as named by Colonel Simmons, the present board resigning in\r\n     their favor.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, following that is other information, the material part of which\r\n     is that the Klan paid to this university $22,474.32, a part of which\r\n     was out of the Klan treasury and which is not secured in any way.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson testified that he had gone over the books of the\r\norganization and had found that while the financial records of the\r\norganization had been accurately kept since June 15, 1921, there had been\r\nno accurate record kept prior to that time, embracing a period of one year\r\nduring which time the Klan had been propagated under the contract of E. Y.\r\nClarke, printed in a previous chapter. The gross receipts of the\r\norganization, according to Mr. Williamson were $1,148,710.97; the books\r\nshowed 85,126 members; and statements of Clarke placed the membership at\r\n126,000. The Post-Office Inspector stated that prior to June 15, 1921,\r\nabout $151,000 had been spent by the organization, but that he had been\r\nunable to secure any statement as to the manner in which it had been\r\ndisbursed. In utter disproof of the claim that the organization had been\r\nestablished for benevolent purposes, it is interesting to follow a part of\r\nthe testimony of Mr. Williamson in detail:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. The ritual of the order and the proclamation hold out\r\n     the order as one for benevolent and high purposes?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Yes, sir; and not for selfish profit.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. What did you discover with respect to the use of money\r\n     for beneficial purposes to the public?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Well, when I went to Atlanta I found that the\r\n     imperial palace itself, which had been bought in part with Klan\r\n     funds, was in the name of Mr. Clarke. I found that the home of Mr.\r\n     Simmons, which had been bought in part with Klan funds, was in Mr.\r\n     Clarke's name. I found also that some $21,000 of Klan funds had been\r\n     given the Lanier University without security. And in that connection\r\n     I might say this: That whenever anybody pays his $10 for the purpose\r\n     of joining this Klan, he is given a receipt which says that this\r\n     money is received in trust for the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\r\n     (Inc.). That is printed on each and every receipt.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. What is the amount that has been paid out for salaries\r\n     of officers in Atlanta--out of the money that has been collected, if\r\n     you know?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Well, I can tell you that, from the propagation\r\n     department alone, $15,247 has been paid as executive salaries.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. To whom has that been paid?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Well, I take it, from the word \"executive,\" that it\r\n     must be Mr. Clarke, and Mrs. Tyler, because they are the two\r\n     executives of that department. Then the field men--they are the\r\n     Kleagles--have been paid, in round numbers, $464,000. That would be\r\n     $5 out of the $10, of which $4 would go to the Kleagle and $1 would\r\n     go to the King Kleagle. That uses up $5. Then 50 cents goes to the\r\n     Grand Goblin. And it is all used up but $4.50 and $2 goes to the\r\n     Klan.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. And all of the $8, then, is used up in paying officers\r\n     or agents of the Klan?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. That is true.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. How much of the remaining $2 has been spent, if you\r\n     know, for the benefit of needy people, or for helpful purposes in\r\n     communities--charitable purposes?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Well, if you call Mr. Simmons a needy person, then\r\n     some thousands of dollars have been spent for him. But general\r\n     charity, I do not think, has received any of it; at least it does not\r\n     appear on the accounts.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. What is Mr. Simmons' salary, if you know?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Mr. Simmons at present gets $1,000 a month. He has\r\n     been getting that since the first of August.\"\r\n\r\nWhen questioned as to the activities of Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler, Mr.\r\nWilliamson described her as a business woman who was engaged in the work\r\nof propagating Ku Kluxism as she would in any other mercantile pursuit,\r\nwithout any altruistic motives whatever. This is brought out in the\r\nfollowing colloquy:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. It is purely a business proposition, so far as she is\r\n     concerned?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. Absolutely.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. CAMPBELL. She is using the mysticism, the regalia, the\r\n     paraphernalia, the masks, and all of the literature of the order for\r\n     the purpose of making money out of it? Is that correct?\r\n\r\n     \"MR. WILLIAMSON. That is correct. In fact, she told me at least twice\r\n     that she was in the business for the purpose of making money, just\r\n     like she was in any other business for that same purpose.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Burns, Director of the Bureau of Investigation of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, was called as a witness, but stated that his\r\ndepartment was still investigating the Ku Klux Klan and that he had\r\nnothing to offer at the present time.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty William Joseph Simmons, \"Emperor\" of the \"Invisible Empire,\"\r\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan, was the last witness examined.\r\n\r\nHaving a good conception of the theatrical, he had arranged to be\r\nintroduced to the committee by Congressman W. D. Upshaw, of Georgia. In\r\nspite of the remark from Chairman Campbell that Simmons did not need an\r\nintroduction to the committee, the \"Cracker\" Congressman cleared his\r\nthroat and delivered the following \"spread-eagle\" speech:\r\n\r\n     \"Knowing his sterling character, as I do, I am prepared to underwrite\r\n     his every utterance as the truth of an honest patriotic man. I do not\r\n     know \"what all\" Colonel Simmons has been doing behind closed doors,\r\n     but I do know that, as a sturdy and inspiring personality, as a\r\n     heroic veteran of the Spanish-American War, as an honored Knight\r\n     Templar and member of something like a dozen other honored and\r\n     well-known fraternities, as a consecrated churchman, and a\r\n     God-fearing citizen, he is as incapable of an unworthy, unpatriotic\r\n     motive, word or deed, as the chairman of this committee, the Speaker\r\n     of the House of Representatives, or the President of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     \"I have known this good man to use his great influence to stop an\r\n     incipient race riot. I have known him to dispense benevolence to a\r\n     negro educational institution. I have known him to prevent negroes\r\n     from being mobbed for crime, even as they were recently mobbed for no\r\n     crime by white men in Omaha, in Chicago, in Indiana and even here in\r\n     the Nation's capital.\r\n\r\n     \"Not for one minute would I stand for personal or organized\r\n     wrongdoing by any man or any friend. More than any other Congressman,\r\n     because of my relationship to this district, I want to know the light\r\n     and I want the world to know the light and I want the country to know\r\n     the light concerning this organization and other secret organizations\r\n     whose deeds are questioned by many and whose memberships are limited\r\n     by race, creed, or color.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the privilege, gentlemen of the committee, of presenting to\r\n     you my long-time, personal friend and constituent, Col. William\r\n     Joseph Simmons.\"\r\n\r\nSimmons, no doubt, expected great applause from the committee, but,\r\ninstead, was met with the cold remark often used by the police\r\nauthorities: \"You are notified that whatever you may say will be used\r\nagainst you.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Emperor\" was on the stand for three days and his testimony before the\r\ncommittee with its accompanying exhibits fill over a hundred printed pages\r\nof the record of the proceedings. Analyzing his statements, I should say\r\nthat in many respects he was an excellent witness who verified completely\r\nthe charges made against his organization by the _New York World_ and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nDenouncing me for repudiating my oath of allegiance to his \"Invisible\r\nEmpire\" by exposing its secrets, he proceeded to go much farther than I\r\nhad done, by turning over to the committee his ritual, oath and many other\r\ndocuments to which I had never had access.\r\n\r\nHis testimony can be classed partly as confession and avoidance; partly as\r\ndenial of facts that were clearly proven by the _World_; partly as\r\nattempted cheap wit that had no element of humor whatever in it;\r\nconsiderable denunciation of the _World_ and of myself; many wild and\r\nerratic statements without foundation of fact; and a great deal of praise\r\nboth for himself and for the organization he represented.\r\n\r\nAmong his denials, for example, he stated that Mrs. Elizabeth Tyler had no\r\nconnection with the organization except as an assistant of Clarke in his\r\npublicity work. This statement was made in the face of the fact that less\r\nthan thirty days previously he had issued a \"ukase\" making the Queen of\r\nSouth Pryor Street his \"Grand Chief of Staff.\" He denied that the Klan at\r\nBeaumont, Tex., had perpetrated the outrages against Doctor Paul, when it\r\nhad been proven under the official seal of that Klan that it had\r\nmaltreated Paul. He denied responsibility in the Pensacola and Mobile\r\ncases, in spite of the fact that he had taken official action himself. He\r\ndenied that he had given the interview to the _Searchlight_ previously\r\nmentioned, in which he predicted direful things would happen to the\r\nenemies of the Klan. These are merely a few denials of previously\r\nestablished facts, facts so well established that any jury in the country\r\nwould accept them.\r\n\r\nHe was particularly bitter against the _World_, and lost no opportunity of\r\ndenouncing it. Included in some of his choicest attacks on the paper were\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     \"The attacks against the Klan were originated and started by the _New\r\n     York World_, which is owned or controlled by a Jew, Mr. Pulitzer,\r\n     whose main purpose is circulation and revenue. The circulation\r\n     manager of this paper stated to one of the newspaper trade\r\n     publications, the editor and publisher of New York which published\r\n     this statement, that the Ku Klux attacks had added a hundred thousand\r\n     circulation to the _World_ and additional advertising.\r\n\r\n     \"The _World_, according to their own statement, spent over four\r\n     months, with unlimited resources at their command, in an\r\n     investigation of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, using trained\r\n     investigators, newspaper men, and covering every section of the\r\n     country. In the face of this careful investigation the _World_ has\r\n     not been able to prove anything detrimental to the Klan except their\r\n     own colored views of unfounded rumor and expressing the attitude of\r\n     its Jewish ownership.\r\n\r\n     \"The _World_ saw that the Klan was the fastest growing purely\r\n     Protestant, non-political organization in the United States. The\r\n     _World_ knew that when you strike at a man's religious and fraternal\r\n     organizations you are striking at the very fiber of his being and\r\n     that then all political affiliations and party lines are forgotten.\r\n\r\n     \"The _World_ is the stronghold of the Democratic newspapers and the\r\n     Democratic Party, and it has been said by those in a position to know\r\n     that if the _World_ could, by shrewd propaganda and untruthful\r\n     slanders, force a Republican Congress and administration to throttle\r\n     or destroy a purely local American Protestant fraternal organization,\r\n     as is the Ku Klux Klan, that its hundreds of thousands of members,\r\n     friends, and those who think as does the Klan, would at the polls\r\n     three years from now forget party lines and preference and vote the\r\n     Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\n     \"I wish to notify the chairman of this committee that there are plans\r\n     on foot at the present time whereby one of the representatives of the\r\n     _New York World_ is to be tarred and feathered in the name of the\r\n     Klan, and that this plan has been originated and its details worked\r\n     out by representatives of the _New York World_ so that it will appear\r\n     that the Klan did this in a spirit of revenge. Furthermore, through\r\n     this plan the _World_ hopes to be able to secure additional\r\n     circulation and advertising for their paper in keeping alive this\r\n     matter. The congressional investigating committee that I want to\r\n     investigate the Klan will receive the sworn proof of this plan of the\r\n     representatives of the _World_ to further try to discredit or harm\r\n     the Klan.\"\r\n\r\nThese statements are fairly good examples of the misinformation and\r\nerratic statements the \"Emperor\" gave the committee. He probably did not\r\nknow that Ralph Pulitzer is a communicant of St. Thomas Episcopal Church,\r\nand that the exposure of his political-financial scheme was no more Jewish\r\nin origin than Simmons is himself. That the circulation of the _World_\r\nincreased 100,000 copies a day is the truth, but it was due to the fact\r\nthat the American people wanted to find out the facts about Ku Kluxism,\r\nand it is significant that, in New York City, from which all this gain in\r\ncirculation came, Ku Kluxism has been unable to make any progress since\r\nthe exposure was made.\r\n\r\nAmong the exhibits, presented by Simmons to the Rules Committee was his\r\nsecret constitution, which up to that time had been a private document.\r\nThis revealed the fact that Simmons has created for himself a life-time\r\nposition at a good salary. The Constitution, Article 8, Section 2, reads:\r\n\r\n     \"The Imperial Wizard shall hold office for life or during good\r\n     behavior. He may be removed for just cause by an unanimous vote of\r\n     the Imperial Kloncilium, or after charges have been preferred and a\r\n     trial upon three-fourths vote of said body in session assembled.\"\r\n\r\nThis unusual section did not appear to the \"Emperor\" to be anything\r\nextraordinary, his comment being: \"As long as the old horse is pulling\r\nwell, it is no use to take him out of the harness when you have him\r\nharnessed up. He cannot do you any harm.\"\r\n\r\nSimmons modestly stated to the committee that he had no vision of turning\r\nthe United States into an Empire. He stated, among other things:\r\n\r\n     \"If tomorrow morning our great President Harding should resign, and\r\n     all the functioning faculties of our great American Government would\r\n     become instantly paralytic and if the American people should rise up\r\n     and proclaim me the monarch of America, I would die before I would\r\n     accept it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile modestly laying aside the Imperial crown, Simmons, however, placed\r\nhimself in the distinguished company of Julius Caesar, Jesus Christ and\r\nGeorge Washington, as he gave utterance to the following choice outburst:\r\n\r\n     \"Julius Caesar had his Brutus, Jesus Christ had his Judas, and our\r\n     great and illustrious Washington had his Benedict Arnold. Sir, I can\r\n     state to you that I can enter the fellowship of all three of those\r\n     because I have suffered in my soul as a result of the treasonous and\r\n     treacherous conduct of traitors. I refer to one in the beginning of\r\n     my statement this morning. Right recently, those who have furnished\r\n     material to the outside world and whose names have been put across\r\n     the page, are one man by the name of Craven, of North Carolina;\r\n     another man by the name of Fry, who hails from Tennessee; another man\r\n     by the name of Wright, who hails, so far as I know, from New York.\r\n     Mr. Craven was a disgruntled office seeker who tried to have me\r\n     appoint him as State head of the State of North Carolina. When I had\r\n     not made any appointments along that line, and had not gotten to\r\n     that, I understood he was trying to get the appointment to use it for\r\n     political purposes. The appointment was not made at the time he\r\n     wanted it, and he sent threatening letters, and because he did not\r\n     get it, or because he could not get that appointment, he became a\r\n     disgruntled office seeker in this Order and proved a traitor to his\r\n     sacred trust. Mr. Fry, or Captain Fry, as he is called, was in our\r\n     field force. He also proved a traitor, and violated as solemn an oath\r\n     as a man can take.\"\r\n\r\nSimmons admitted, in discussing his ritual that he had appropriated\r\nwithout any credit the immortal poem of Josiah G. Holland entitled \"God\r\nGive Us Men,\" but made no effort to defend himself against the charge of\r\nplagiarism, frankly stating that he had taken the poem and but slightly\r\nparaphrased it.\r\n\r\nThe climax of Simmons testimony was a highly theatrical and emotional\r\n\"break down,\" which some observers have declared to have been deliberately\r\nstaged for the effect it produced, although Simmons claims that it was\r\ncaused by an illness from which he was suffering at the time. After\r\nconcluding his long-winded statements and verbose testimony he turned to\r\nthe committee and cried:\r\n\r\n     \"Again I want to express to you, Mr. Chairman, my deep gratitude and\r\n     thanks for the courtesies you have extended to me. I want to say to\r\n     all those men and women who have given assurance, with your\r\n     permission, of their belief in me that they have my thanks, and I\r\n     want to say to my persecutors and the persecutor of this organization\r\n     in all honesty and sincerity no matter to what creed or race you may\r\n     belong in your persecutions, through the medium of the press or\r\n     otherwise, that you do not know what you are doing. You are ignorant\r\n     of the principles as were those who were ignorant of the character\r\n     and work of the Christ. I cannot better express myself than by\r\n     saying to you who are persecutors of the Klan and myself, 'Father,\r\n     forgive you, for you know not what you do,' and 'Father, forgive\r\n     them, for they know not what they do.'\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Chairman, I am done.\"\r\n\r\nHe then fell forward, face downward on the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have endeavored to set forth in these pages should have\r\ncaused the reader to do some serious thinking, for serious thought is\r\nsomething this country at present needs above all else. The United States\r\nhas but lately emerged from the greatest war in the annals of the race.\r\nWhen we laid down our arms the might and power of the German Emperor was\r\nforever crushed. Having assisted materially in crushing a visible Empire\r\nin Europe, the American people should be able to make short work of\r\nexterminating an \"Invisible Empire\" at home. When this righteous task is\r\naccomplished, they should pause a little and reflect upon some of the\r\nconditions that exist in this country today--conditions that must be\r\nsoberly and earnestly faced.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a period in American history where sounder, saner,\r\nand more intelligent leadership was a prime necessity than it is at\r\npresent. Totally unprepared in every way to enter a war on such stupendous\r\na scale, American idealism and American practical sense were fully\r\nadequate to meet the abnormal situation; but the termination of the war\r\nfound the country still functioning abnormally. To accomplish\r\nsuccessfully the return to normal, pre-war conditions has been, is, and\r\nwill be the chief thought of the leaders and the people. Economic\r\nconditions require readjustment, important matters of trade must be\r\nregulated, vital questions of finance and taxation must be handled, in\r\nfact, the whole country must settle down to production, manufacture,\r\ndistribution of merchandise, and the transaction of the nation's regular\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThese matters alone should be sufficient to occupy the entire attention of\r\nthe people, but, unfortunately, there exists in the United States a series\r\nof group antagonisms that bode no good for the future peace and prosperity\r\nof the country. The fact that there are a number of discordant groups in\r\nAmerica is the basic reason why the Ku Klux propaganda has been so\r\nsuccessful. The further fact that the country requires all of its best\r\nthought to the readjustment of its vital interests makes it all the more\r\ndastardly to stir up domestic dissension in the United States at this time\r\nof all others. These group antagonisms are of such importance to the\r\ncountry that until they become reconciled and subordinated to the common\r\npublic interest there will never be, on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, a\r\ncohesive, homogeneous nation such as is the British Empire. The\r\ndevelopment of a national unity for the United States, which really began\r\nat the termination of the Civil War, is yet in its infancy stage.\r\nOutwardly the nation is, to all intents and purposes, great power, rich,\r\ninventive and capable of meeting the most terrific forces that might be\r\narrayed against it; inwardly, it is a collection of discordant elements,\r\nmany of which assume the prerogative of dictating to the others. If the\r\nUnited States ever goes to pieces, the cause of its disintegration will\r\nnot be due to foreign aggression but will result from internal strife.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of unwarranted dictation of one group to another has produced\r\nin recent years the voluntary \"uplifter,\" who, generally for personal\r\ngain, has, with his followers, presumed to take charge of the personal\r\nhabits, the morals and the liberties of the community under the alleged\r\nplea of elevating the community. This is one of the phases of the Ku Klux\r\nmovement, which, surreptitiously, would attempt to pry into the affairs of\r\nthe people of a community, and assume to itself the prerogative of\r\nregulating their private matters. It is, however, but a natural outcome of\r\na general condition. I believe, however, as a general thing:\r\n\r\n_The American people are \"fed up\" on the \"uplift!\"_\r\n\r\nIt would be a great blessing if ninety-nine per cent of all the\r\nassociations and societies of the \"uplifting\" character were completely\r\nwiped out of existence, and the public be permitted to try the wholesome\r\nexperiment of attending to its own business without the assistance of\r\nmeddlesome individuals whose sole means of livelihood consist in\r\nprofessional \"uplifting.\"\r\n\r\nAnother situation in America that may be classified as a group antagonism\r\nis the race question which must be settled by practical common-sense\r\nmethods basically upon the elementary principles of justice. For fifty\r\nyears the American negro has been the football of party politics, and as a\r\nresult both the negro and the country at large have been sufferers. When\r\nthe negro ceases to be a political issue and when the \"uplifters\" keep\r\ntheir hands off of him and let him work out his own salvation, he will\r\nbecome a better and more useful citizen.\r\n\r\nOther group antagonisms that exist in America are Capital and Labor,\r\nRadicalism, and religious groups of all shades and varieties. In the\r\nmatter of Capitalism and Trades-unionism, the average American is between\r\nScylla and Charybdis, and is inevitably the victim of both discordant\r\nelements. The burdens of taxation, high prices, and labor disputes fall\r\nupon the shoulders of that vast army of Americans constituting the middle\r\nclass. Intruding its ugly head into the industrial situation comes\r\nradicalism as a disturbing factor in unbalancing the peaceful conditions\r\nof the country. All these divergent groups must be co-ordinated and taught\r\na national unity--a more profound respect for real Americanism--before\r\nthis country can truthfully call itself a really great nation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most senseless of all group antagonisms is the religious. It\r\nis a peculiar thing to the student of world religions to note the\r\nextraordinary amount of friction and discord that has attended organized\r\nChristianity almost from its inception, resulting oftentimes in\r\npersecution and bloodshed. It was, in a great measure, to escape the\r\nreligious intolerance of Europe that many of the first settlers came to\r\nAmerica. The Puritan, driven from England, sought the rock-bound shores of\r\nNew England; the Quaker immigrated to Pennsylvania to found a colony,\r\nbased upon the principle of brotherly love; the Catholic, led by Lord\r\nBaltimore found refuge in Maryland; the Cavalier settled Virginia; and, to\r\nthe Carolinas came the Huguenots,--all seeking the privilege of\r\nworshipping God according to the dictates of personal conscience. So\r\nstrong was the feeling against religious intolerance, and so jealous were\r\nthe early fathers of the principle of religious liberty that the very\r\nfirst amendment incorporated into the Constitution of the United States\r\nread: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\r\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\r\n\r\nFor one hundred and twenty-five years, more or less, the antagonism of\r\nreligious groups was not felt to any great extent, but in recent years\r\nthere has been a steady increase of religious discord. There has been\r\nantagonism between the Christian and the Jew, between the Protestant and\r\nthe Catholic, and between the various sects and denominations that profess\r\nand call themselves Christians.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Semitic feeling in the United States is due, in my opinion, to\r\nseveral causes. I think primarily it is based upon a feeling of jealousy\r\nof the Jew's great advance in America along all lines of commercial and\r\nprofessional activity. When one considers that there are only a little\r\nmore than three millions of Jews in the United States, it is astounding\r\nwhat great progress they have made in practically every field of endeavor.\r\nThe popular conception of the Jews as merely commercial people is not\r\nborne out by the facts, because in the legal, medical, and scientific\r\nprofessions, in music, in the drama, and in the arts some of the leaders\r\nin America are Jewish people. Instead of meeting this unusual rise by\r\nemulation and competition, many people give vent to their jealousy through\r\nthe channels of an unreasoning anti-Semitism. On the other hand there is a\r\ngreat deal of legitimate criticism against the extremely lower classes of\r\nforeign Jews who have been permitted to come indiscriminately to American\r\nshores, people who are ignorant of real Americanism and unwilling to\r\nlearn. The general characteristics of these people are eagerly seized upon\r\nby the professional Jew-baiter, and consequently the great mass of\r\nAmericans of Jewish origin, men and women of refinement and ability are\r\nmade the targets of a general attack of anti-Semitism.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal more anti-Catholicism in America than the average\r\nperson realizes, and the sooner the Protestants and the Catholics find\r\nsome common ground of agreement, the better off this country will be. Much\r\nof this sort of group antagonism could be eliminated if both sides of the\r\ncontroversy would get together and abandon the spirit of intolerance that\r\nis characteristic of each. The increase of Catholicism in America has been\r\nvery rapid. There are now over seventeen million Catholics in this\r\ncountry, and they are found to a great extent in the larger cities. In\r\nthese places the church is a force for great good, controlling people that\r\nno other religious organization can control, and should its good influence\r\nsuddenly be withdrawn, the most wretched conditions would prevail.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the Protestant churches possess the ability to cope\r\nwith certain phases of metropolitan life as successfully as does the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nBasic causes of group antagonism between Protestant and Catholic lie\r\npartly in the fact that the government of the Catholic Church is outside\r\nof the United States, and partly on account of the attitude of the church\r\nitself toward certain American institutions, notably the public-school\r\nsystem and the laws in this country governing marriages. If the Catholic\r\nChurch was under an American head, with no connection with any foreign\r\norganization, there would be but little ground upon which the\r\nprofessional Catholic-baiter could stand, but the fact that it is governed\r\nfrom Rome furnishes the chief objection to the system. In spite of this\r\nhowever, it lies in the power of Protestant and Catholic leaders to \"get\r\ntogether\" and endeavor to eliminate the present growing friction. In my\r\nstudy of the Ku Klux movement, I found that one of its greatest bids for\r\npopular favor was in its attitude to the rise of Catholicism in America.\r\nThe fact that such a thing can be true, should be a matter of serious\r\nreflection to the Catholic and to the Protestant. In the succeeding years,\r\nif this feeling is not allayed and the differences reconciled it means\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nI believe in a real Americanism based on a deeply rooted love of country,\r\nand a broad respect and mutual understanding on the part of the people. I\r\nbelieve firmly that all of the internal dissensions and discords in this\r\ncountry, where group is arrayed against group could be completely\r\neliminated by the application of the philosophy and love of Jesus Christ.\r\n\"Invisible Empires,\" \"Ku Klux Klans,\" and all organizations seeking to\r\nadvance one group at the expense of another, pale into oblivion and\r\nnothingness, when the voice of the gentle Nazarene speaks down the\r\ncenturies, breathing a sweet message of brotherhood alike to the white man\r\nand the negro, the Gentile and the Jew, the Catholic and the Protestant,\r\ngiving to each the same message, and voicing a common creed:\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy\r\nsoul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor\r\nas thyself.\r\n\r\n\"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been corrected without note.\r\n\r\nThe following misprints have been corrected:\r\n  \"similiar\" corrected to \"similar\" (page 6)\r\n  \"WEELKY\" corrected to \"WEEKLY\" (page 48)\r\n  \"violating\" corrected to \"violation\" (page 75)\r\n  \"opnion\" corrected to \"opinion\" (page 95)\r\n  \"in in\" corrected to \"in\" (page 118)\r\n  \"Afracanize\" corrected to \"Africanize\" (page 125)\r\n  \"compiled\" corrected to \"complied\" (page 215)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Modern Ku Klux Klan, by Henry Peck Fry",
