That turning-point is the emergence of the\r\nsovereign State at the end of the fifteenth century. And it is symbolical\r\nof all that was to follow that at that point stands, looking down the\r\nvista of the centuries, the brilliant and sinister figure of Machiavelli.\r\nFrom that date onwards international policy has meant Machiavellianism.\r\nSometimes the masters of the craft, like Catherine de Medici or Napoleon,\r\nhave avowed it; sometimes, like Frederick the Great, they have disclaimed\r\nit. But always they have practised it. They could not, indeed, practise\r\nanything else. For it is as true of an aggregation of States as of an\r\naggregation of individuals that, whatever moral sentiments may prevail, if\r\nthere is no common law and no common force the best intentions will be\r\ndefeated by lack of confidence and security. Mutual fear and mutual\r\nsuspicion, aggression masquerading as defence and defence masquerading as\r\naggression, will be the protagonists in the bloody drama; and there will\r\nbe, what Hobbes truly asserted to be the essence of such a situation, a\r\nchronic state of war, open or veiled. For peace itself will be a latent\r\nwar; and the more the States arm to prevent a conflict the more certainly\r\nwill it be provoked, since to one or another it will always seem a better\r\nchance to have it now than to have it on worse conditions later. Some\r\none State at any moment may be the immediate offender; but the main and\r\npermanent offence is common to all States. It is the anarchy which they\r\nare all responsible for perpetuating.\r\n\r\nWhile this anarchy continues the struggle between States will tend to\r\nassume a certain stereotyped form. One will endeavour to acquire supremacy\r\nover the others for motives at once of security and of domination, the\r\nothers will combine to defeat it, and history will turn upon the two poles\r\nof empire and the balance of power. So it has been in Europe, and so it\r\nwill continue to be, until either empire is achieved, as once it was\r\nachieved by Rome, or a common law and a common authority is established\r\nby agreement. In the past empire over Europe has been sought by Spain,\r\nby Austria, and by France; and soldiers, politicians, and professors in\r\nGermany have sought, and seek, to secure it now for Germany. On the other\r\nhand, Great Britain has long stood, as she stands now, for the balance of\r\npower. As ambitious, as quarrelsome, and as aggressive as other States, her\r\ngeographical position has directed her aims overseas rather than toward\r\nthe Continent of Europe. Since the fifteenth century her power has never\r\nmenaced the Continent. On the contrary, her own interest has dictated that\r\nshe should resist there the enterprise of empire, and join in the defensive\r\nefforts of the threatened States. To any State of Europe that has conceived\r\nthe ambition to dominate the Continent this policy of England has seemed\r\nas contrary to the interests of civilization as the policy of the Papacy\r\nappeared in Italy to an Italian patriot like Machiavelli. He wanted Italy\r\nenslaved, in order that it might be united. And so do some Germans now want\r\nEurope enslaved, that it may have peace under Germany. They accuse England\r\nof perpetuating for egotistic ends the state of anarchy. But it was not\r\nthus that Germans viewed British policy when the Power that was to give\r\npeace to Europe was not Germany, but France. In this long and bloody game\r\nthe partners are always changing, and as partners change so do views.\r\nOne thing only does not change, the fundamental anarchy. International\r\nrelations, it is agreed, can only turn upon force. It is the disposition\r\nand grouping of the forces alone that can or does vary.\r\n\r\nBut Europe is not the only scene of the conflict between empire and\r\nthe balance. Since the sixteenth century the European States have been\r\ncontending for mastery, not only over one another, but over the world.\r\nColonial empires have risen and fallen. Portugal, Spain, Holland, in turn\r\nhave won and lost. England and France have won, lost, and regained. In\r\nthe twentieth century Great Britain reaps the reward of her European\r\nconflicts in the Empire (wrongly so-called) on which the sun never sets.\r\nNext to her comes France, in Africa and the East; while Germany looks out\r\nwith discontented eyes on a world already occupied, and, cherishing the\r\nsame ambitions all great States have cherished before her, finds the\r\ntime too mature for their accomplishment by the methods that availed in\r\nthe past. Thus, not only in Europe but on the larger stage of the world\r\nthe international rivalry is pursued. But it is the same rivalry and it\r\nproceeds from the same cause: the mutual aggression and defence of beings\r\nliving in a \"state of nature.\"\r\n\r\nWithout this historical background no special study of the events that led\r\nup to the present war can be either just or intelligible. The feeling of\r\nevery nation about itself and its neighbours is determined by the history\r\nof the past and by the way in which that history is regarded. The picture\r\nlooks different from every point of view. Indeed, a comprehension of the\r\ncauses of the war could only be fully attained by one who should know, not\r\nonly the most secret thoughts of the few men who directly brought it about,\r\nbut also the prejudices and preconceptions of the public opinion in each\r\nnation. There is nobody who possesses these qualifications. But in the\r\nabsence of such a historian these imperfect notes are set down in the hope\r\nthat they may offer a counterpoise to some of the wilder passions that\r\nsweep over all peoples in time of war and threaten to prepare for Europe\r\na future even worse than its past has been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Triple Alliance and the Entente_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, let us remind ourselves in general of the situation that prevailed\r\nin Europe during the ten years preceding the war. It was in that period\r\nthat the Entente between France, Russia, and England was formed and\r\nconsolidated, over against the existing Triple Alliance between Germany,\r\nAustria, and Italy. Neither of these combinations was in its origin and\r\npurpose aggressive[1].\r\n\r\nAnd, so far as Great Britain was concerned, the relations she entered into\r\nwith France and with Russia were directed in each case to the settlement\r\nof long outstanding differences without special reference to the German\r\nPowers. But it is impossible in the European anarchy that any arrangements\r\nshould be made between any States which do not arouse suspicion in others.\r\nAnd the drawing together of the Powers of the Entente did in fact appear\r\nto Germany as a menace. She believed that she was being threatened by an\r\naggressive combination, just as, on the other hand, she herself seemed to\r\nthe Powers of the Entente a danger to be guarded against. This apprehension\r\non the part of Germany, is sometimes thought to have been mere pretence,\r\nbut there is every reason to suppose it to have been genuine. The policy of\r\nthe Entente did in fact, on a number of occasions, come into collision with\r\nthat of Germany. The arming and counter-arming was continuous. And the very\r\nfact that from the side of the Entente it seemed that Germany was always\r\nthe aggressor, should suggest to us that from the other side the opposite\r\nimpression would prevail. That, in fact, it did prevail is clear not only\r\nfrom the constant assertions of German statesmen and of the German Press,\r\nbut from contemporary observations made by the representatives of a State\r\nnot itself involved in either of the opposing combinations. The dispatches\r\nof the Belgian ambassadors at Berlin, Paris, and London during the years\r\n1905 to 1914[2] show a constant impression that the Entente was a hostile\r\ncombination directed against Germany and engineered, in the earlier years,\r\nfor that purpose by King Edward VII. This impression of the Belgian\r\nrepresentatives is no proof, it is true, of the real intentions of the\r\nEntente, but it is proof of how they did in fact appear to outsiders. And\r\nit is irrelevant, whether or no it be true, to urge that the Belgians were\r\nindoctrinated with the German view; since precisely the fact that they\r\ncould be so indoctrinated would show that the view was on the face of it\r\nplausible. We see, then, in these dispatches the way in which the policy of\r\nthe Entente could appear to observers outside it. I give illustrations from\r\nBerlin, Paris, and London.\r\n\r\nOn May 30, 1908, Baron Greindl, Belgian Ambassador at Berlin, writes as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Call it an alliance, _entente_, or what you will, the grouping of the\r\n  Powers arranged by the personal intervention of the King of England\r\n  exists, and if it is not a direct and immediate threat of war against\r\n  Germany (it would be too much to say that it was that), it constitutes\r\n  none the less a diminution of her security. The necessary pacifist\r\n  declarations, which, no doubt, will be repeated at Reval, signify very\r\n  little, emanating as they do from three Powers which, like Russia and\r\n  England, have just carried through successfully, without any motive\r\n  except the desire for aggrandizement, and without even a plausible\r\n  pretext, wars of conquest in Manchuria and the Transvaal, or which,\r\n  like France, is proceeding at this moment to the conquest of Morocco,\r\n  in contempt of solemn promises, and without any title except the\r\n  cession of British rights, which never existed.\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1907, the Comte de Lalaing, Belgian Ambassador at London,\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n  A certain section of the Press, called here the Yellow Press, bears to a\r\n  great extent the responsibility for the hostile feeling between the two\r\n  nations.... It is plain enough that official England is quietly pursuing\r\n  a policy opposed to Germany and aimed at her isolation, and that King\r\n  Edward has not hesitated to use his personal influence in the service of\r\n  this scheme. But it is certainly exceedingly dangerous to poison public\r\n  opinion in the open manner adopted by these irresponsible journals.\r\n\r\nAgain, on July 28, 1911, in the midst of the Morocco crisis, Baron\r\nGuillaume, Belgian Ambassador at Paris, writes:--\r\n\r\n  I have great confidence in the pacific sentiments of the Emperor William,\r\n  in spite of the too frequent exaggeration of some of his gestures. He\r\n  will not allow himself to be drawn on farther than he chooses by the\r\n  exuberant temperament and clumsy manners of his very intelligent Minister\r\n  of Foreign Affairs (Kiderlen-Waechter). I feel, in general, less faith in\r\n  the desire of Great Britain for peace. She would not be sorry to see the\r\n  others eat one another up.... As I thought from the beginning, it is in\r\n  London that the key to the situation lies. It is there only that it can\r\n  become grave. The French will yield on all the points for the sake of\r\n  peace. It is not the same with the English, who will not compromise on\r\n  certain principles and certain claims.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The alliance between Germany and Austria, which dates from\r\n1879, was formed to guarantee the two States against an attack by Russia.\r\nIts terms are:--\r\n\r\n\"1. If, contrary to what is to be expected and contrary to the sincere\r\ndesire of the two high contracting parties, one of the two Empires\r\nshould be attacked by Russia, the two high contracting parties are\r\nbound reciprocally to assist one another with the whole military force\r\nof their Empire, and further not to make peace except conjointly and\r\nby common consent.\r\n\r\n\"2. If one of the high contracting Powers should be attacked by another\r\nPower, the other high contracting party engages itself, by the present act,\r\nnot only not to support the aggressor against its ally, but at least to\r\nobserve a benevolent neutrality with regard to the other contracting party.\r\nIf, however, in the case supposed the attacking Power should be supported\r\nby Russia, whether by active co-operation or by military measures which\r\nshould menace the Power attacked, then the obligation of mutual assistance\r\nwith all military forces, as stipulated in the preceding article, would\r\nimmediately come into force, and the military operations of the high\r\ncontracting parties would be in that case conducted jointly until the\r\nconclusion of peace.\"\r\n\r\nItaly acceded to the Alliance in 1882. The engagement is defensive. Each of\r\nthe three parties is to come to the assistance of the others if attacked by\r\na third party.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Germany with Austria was supplemented in 1884 by a treaty\r\nwith Russia, known as the \"Reinsurance Treaty,\" whereby Germany bound\r\nherself not to join Austria in an attack upon Russia. This treaty lapsed\r\nin the year 1890, and the lapse, it is presumed, prepared the way for the\r\n_rapprochement_ between Russia and France.\r\n\r\nThe text of the treaty of 1894 between France and Russia has never been\r\npublished. It is supposed to be a treaty of mutual defence in case of an\r\naggressive attack. The Power from whom attack is expected is probably\r\nnamed, as in the treaty between Germany and Austria. It is probably for\r\nthat reason that the treaty was not published. The accession of Great\r\nBritain to what then became known as the \"Triple Entente\" is determined by\r\nthe treaty of 1904 with France, whereby France abandoned her opposition to\r\nthe British occupation of Egypt in return for a free hand in Morocco; and\r\nby the treaty of 1907 with Russia, whereby the two Powers regulated their\r\nrelations in Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. There is no mention in either\r\ncase of an attack, or a defence against attack, by any other Power.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: These were published by the _Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,_\r\nand are reprinted under the title \"Belgische Aktenstücke,\" 1905-14 (Ernst\r\nSiegfried Mittler and Sons, Berlin). Their authenticity, as far as I know,\r\nhas not been disputed. On the other hand, it is to be assumed that they\r\nhave been very carefully \"edited\" by the German to make a particular\r\nimpression. My view of the policy of Germany or of the Entente is in no\r\nsense based upon them. I adduce them as evidence of contemporary feeling\r\nand opinion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Great Britain_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving established this general fact that a state of mutual suspicion and\r\nfear prevailed between Germany and the Powers of the Triple Entente, let us\r\nnext consider the positions and purposes of the various States involved.\r\nFirst, let us take Great Britain, of which we ought to know most. Great\r\nBritain is the head of an Empire, and of one, in point of territory and\r\npopulation, the greatest the world has ever seen. This Empire has been\r\nacquired by trade and settlement, backed or preceded by military force.\r\nAnd to acquire and hold it, it has been necessary to wage war after war,\r\nnot only overseas but on the continent of Europe. It is, however, as we\r\nhave already noticed, a fact, and a cardinal fact, that since the fifteenth\r\ncentury British ambitions have not been directed to extending empire over\r\nthe continent of Europe. On the contrary, we have resisted by arms every\r\nattempt made by other Powers in that direction. That is what we have meant\r\nby maintaining the \"balance of power.\" We have acted, no doubt, in our own\r\ninterest, or in what we thought to be such; but in doing so we have made\r\nourselves the champions of those European nations that have been threatened\r\nby the excessive power of their neighbours. British imperialism has thus,\r\nfor four centuries, not endangered but guaranteed the independence of the\r\nEuropean States. Further, our Empire is so large that we can hardly extend\r\nit without danger of being unable to administer and protect it. We claim,\r\ntherefore, that we have neither the need nor the desire to wage wars of\r\nconquest. But we ought not to be surprised if this attitude is not accepted\r\nwithout reserve by other nations. For during the last half-century we\r\nhave, in fact, waged wars to annex Egypt, the Soudan, the South African\r\nRepublics, and Burmah, to say nothing of the succession of minor wars\r\nwhich have given us Zululand, Rhodesia, Nigeria, and Uganda. Odd as it\r\ndoes, I believe, genuinely seem to most Englishmen, we are regarded on\r\nthe Continent as the most aggressive Power in the world, although our\r\naggression is not upon Europe. We cannot expect, therefore, that our\r\nprofessions of peaceableness should be taken very seriously by outsiders.\r\nNevertheless it is, I believe, true that, at any rate during the last\r\nfifteen-years, those professions have been genuine. Our statesmen, of both\r\nparties, have honestly desired and intended to keep the peace of the world.\r\nAnd they have been assisted in this by a genuine and increasing desire for\r\npeace in the nation. The Liberal Government in particular has encouraged\r\nprojects of arbitration and of disarmament; and Sir Edward Grey is probably\r\nthe most pacific Minister that ever held office in a great nation. But our\r\npast inevitably discredits, in this respect, our future. And when we\r\nprofess peace it is not unnatural that other nations should suspect a\r\nsnare.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this desire for peace on our part is conditional upon the\r\nmaintenance of the _status quo_ and of our naval supremacy. Our vast\r\ninterests in every part of the world make us a factor everywhere to be\r\nreckoned with. East, west, north, and south, no other Power can take a step\r\nwithout finding us in the path. Those States, therefore, which, unlike\r\nourselves, are desirous farther to extend their power and influence\r\nbeyond the seas, must always reckon with us, particularly if, with that\r\nend in view, by increasing their naval strength they seem to threaten our\r\nsupremacy at sea. This attitude of ours is not to be blamed, but it must\r\nalways make difficult the maintenance of friendly relations with ambitious\r\nPowers. In the past our difficulties have been mainly with Russia and\r\nFrance. In recent years they have been with Germany. For Germany, since\r\n1898, for the first time in her history, has been in a position, and has\r\nmade the choice, to become a World-Power. For that reason, as well as\r\nto protect her commerce, she has built a navy. And for that reason we,\r\npursuing our traditional policy of opposing the strongest continental\r\nPower, have drawn away from her and towards Russia and France. We did not,\r\nindeed, enter upon our arrangements with these latter Powers because of\r\naggressive intentions towards Germany. But the growth of German sea-power\r\ndrove us more and more to rely upon the Entente in case it should be\r\nnecessary for us to defend ourselves. All this followed inevitably from\r\nthe logic of the position, given the European anarchy. I state it for the\r\nsake of exposition, not of criticism, and I do not imagine any reader will\r\nquarrel with my statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _France_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to France. Since 1870 we find contending there, with\r\nvarying fortunes and strength, two opposite currents of sentiment and\r\npolicy. One was that of _revanche_ against Germany, inspired by the old\r\ntraditions of glory and hegemony, associated with hopes of a monarchist\r\nor imperialistic revolution, and directed, in the first place, to a\r\nrecovery of Alsace-Lorraine. The other policy was that of peace abroad\r\nand socialistic transformation at home, inspired by the modern ideals of\r\njustice and fraternity, and supported by the best of the younger generation\r\nof philosophers, poets, and artists, as well as by the bulk of the working\r\nclass. Nowhere have these two currents of contemporary aspiration met\r\nand contended as fiercely as in France. The Dreyfus case was the most\r\nstriking act in the great drama. But it was not the concluding one. French\r\nmilitarism, in that affair, was scotched but not killed, and the contest\r\nwas never fiercer than in the years immediately preceding the war. The\r\nfighters for peace were the Socialists, under their leader, Jaurès, the one\r\ngreat man in the public life of Europe. While recognizing the urgent need\r\nfor adequate national defence, Jaurès laboured so to organize it that it\r\ncould not be mistaken for nor converted into aggression. He laboured, at\r\nthe same time, to remove the cause of the danger. In the year 1913, under\r\nSwiss auspices, a meeting of French and German pacifists was arranged at\r\nBerne. To this meeting there proceeded 167 French deputies and 48 senators.\r\nThe Baron d'Estournelles de Constant was president of the French bureau,\r\nand Jaurès one of the vice-presidents. The result was disappointing. The\r\nGerman participation was small and less influential than the French, and\r\nno agreement could be reached on the burning question of Alsace-Lorraine.\r\nBut the French Socialists continued, up to the eve of the war, to fight\r\nfor peace with an energy, an intelligence, and a determination shown\r\nin no other country. The assassination of Jaurès was a symbol of the\r\nassassination of peace; but the assassin was a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nFor if, in France, the current for peace ran strong in these latter\r\nyears, so did the current for war. French chauvinism had waxed and\r\nwaned, but it was never extinguished. After 1870 it centred not only\r\nabout Alsace-Lorraine, but also about the colonial expansion which took\r\nfrom that date a new lease of life in France, as it had done in England\r\nafter the loss of the American colonies. Directly encouraged by Bismarck,\r\nFrance annexed Tunis in 1881. The annexation of Tunis led up at last to\r\nthat of Morocco. Other territory had been seized in the Far East, and\r\nFrance became, next to ourselves, the greatest colonial Power. This policy\r\ncould not be pursued without friction, and the principal friction at the\r\nbeginning was with ourselves. Once at least, in the Fashoda crisis, the two\r\ncountries were on the verge of war, and it was not till the Entente of 1904\r\nthat their relations were adjusted on a basis of give-and-take. But by that\r\ntime Germany had come into the colonial field, and the Entente with England\r\nmeant new friction with Germany, turning upon French designs in Morocco. In\r\nthis matter Great Britain supported her ally, and the incident of Agadir\r\nin 1911 showed the solidity of the Entente. This demonstration no doubt\r\nstrengthened the hands of the aggressive elements in France, and later\r\non the influence of M. Delcassé and M. Poincaré was believed in certain\r\nquarters to have given new energy to this direction of French policy. This\r\ntendency to chauvinism was recognized as a menace to peace, and we find\r\nreflections of that feeling in the Belgian dispatches. Thus, for instance,\r\nBaron Guillaume, Belgian minister at Paris, writes on February, 21, 1913,\r\nof M. Poincaré:--\r\n\r\n  It is under his Ministry that the military and slightly chauvinistic\r\n  instincts of the French people have awakened. His hand can be seen in\r\n  this modification; it is to be hoped that his political intelligence,\r\n  practical and cool, will save him from all exaggeration in this course.\r\n  The notable increase of German armaments which supervenes at the moment\r\n  of M. Poincaré's entrance at the Elysée will increase the danger of a\r\n  too nationalistic orientation of the policy of France.\r\n\r\nAgain, on March 3, 1913:--\r\n\r\n  The German Ambassador said to me on Saturday: \"The political situation\r\n  is much improved in the last forty-eight hours; the tension is generally\r\n  relaxed; one may hope for a return to peace in the near future. But what\r\n  does not improve is the state of public opinion in France and Germany\r\n  with regard to the relations between the two countries. We are persuaded\r\n  in Germany that a spirit of chauvinism having revived, we have to fear an\r\n  attack by the Republic. In France they express the same fear with regard\r\n  to us. The consequence of these misunderstandings is to ruin us both. I\r\n  do not know where we are going on this perilous route. Will not a man\r\n  appear of sufficient goodwill and prestige to recall every one to reason?\r\n  All this is the more ridiculous because, during the crisis we are\r\n  traversing, the two Governments have given proof of the most pacific\r\n  sentiments, and have continually relied upon one another to avoid\r\n  conflicts.\"\r\n\r\nOn this Baron Guillaume comments:--\r\n\r\n  Baron Schoen is perfectly right, I am not in a position to examine German\r\n  opinion, but I note every day how public opinion in France becomes more\r\n  suspicious and chauvinistic. One meets people who assure one that a war\r\n  with Germany in the near future is certain and inevitable. People regret\r\n  it, but make up their minds to it.... They demand, almost by acclamation,\r\n  an immediate vote for every means of increasing the defensive power of\r\n  France. The most reasonable men assert that it is necessary to arm to the\r\n  teeth to frighten the enemy and prevent war.\r\n\r\nOn April 16th he reports a conversation with M. Pichon, in which the latter\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  Among us, too, there is a spirit of chauvinism which is increasing,\r\n  which I deplore, and against which we ought to react. Half the theatres\r\n  in Paris now play chauvinistic and nationalistic pieces.\r\n\r\nThe note of alarm becomes more urgent as the days go on. On January 16,\r\n1914, the Baron writes:--\r\n\r\n  I have already had the honour to tell you that it is MM. Poincaré,\r\n  Delcassé, Millerand and their friends who have invented and pursued the\r\n  nationalistic and chauvinistic policy which menaces to-day the peace of\r\n  Europe, and of which we have noted the renaissance. It is a danger for\r\n  Europe and for Belgium. I see in it the greatest peril, which menaces the\r\n  peace of Europe to-day; not that I have the right to suppose that the\r\n  Government of the Republic is disposed deliberately to trouble the peace,\r\n  rather I believe the contrary; but the attitude that the Barthou Cabinet\r\n  has taken up is, in my judgment, the determining cause of an excess of\r\n  militaristic tendencies in Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from these quotations, and it is for this reason alone that\r\nI give them, that France, supported by the other members of the Triple\r\nEntente, could appear, and did appear, as much a menace to Germany as\r\nGermany appeared a menace to France; that in France, as in other countries,\r\nthere was jingoism as well as pacifism; and that the inability of French\r\npublic opinion to acquiesce in the loss of Alsace-Lorraine was an active\r\nfactor in the unrest of Europe. Once more I state these facts, I do\r\nnot criticize them. They are essential to the comprehension of the\r\ninternational situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Russia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have spoken so far of the West. But the Entente between France and\r\nRussia, dating from 1894, brought the latter into direct contact with\r\nEastern policy. The motives and even the terms of the Dual Alliance are\r\nimperfectly known. Considerations of high finance are supposed to have\r\nbeen an important factor in it. But the main intention, no doubt, was to\r\nstrengthen both Powers in the case of a possible conflict with Germany. The\r\nchances of war between Germany and France were thus definitely increased,\r\nfor now there could hardly be an Eastern war without a Western one. Germany\r\nmust therefore regard herself as compelled to wage war, if war should come,\r\non both fronts; and in all her fears or her ambitions this consideration\r\nmust play a principal part. Friction in the East must involve friction in\r\nthe West, and vice versa. What were the causes of friction in the West we\r\nhave seen. Let us now consider the cause of friction in the East.\r\n\r\nThe relations of Russia to Germany have been and are of a confused and\r\ncomplicated character, changing as circumstances and personalities change.\r\nBut one permanent factor has been the sympathy between the governing\r\nelements in the two countries. The governing class in Russia, indeed, has\r\nnot only been inspired by German ideas, it has been largely recruited\r\nfrom men of German stock; and it has manifested all the contempt and\r\nhatred which is characteristic of the German bureaucracy for the ideals of\r\ndemocracy, liberty, and free thought. The two Governments have always been\r\nready to combine against popular insurrections, and in particular against\r\nevery attempt of the Poles to recover their liberty. They have been drawn\r\nand held together by a common interest in tyranny, and the renewal of that\r\nco-operation is one of the dangers of the future. On the other hand, apart\r\nfrom and in opposition to this common political interest, there exists\r\nbetween the two nations a strong racial antagonism. The Russian temperament\r\nis radically opposed to the German. The one expresses itself in Panslavism,\r\nthe other in Pangermanism. And this opposition of temperament is likely\r\nto be deeper and more enduring than the sympathy of the one autocracy with\r\nthe other. But apart from this racial factor, there is in the south-east\r\nan opposition of political ambition. Primarily, the Balkan question is\r\nan Austro-Russian rather than a Russo-German one. Bismarck professed\r\nhimself indifferent to the fate of the Balkan peoples, and even avowed a\r\nwillingness to see Russia at Constantinople. But recent years have seen,\r\nin this respect, a great change. The alliance between Germany and Austria,\r\ndating from 1879, has become closer and closer as the Powers of the Entente\r\nhave drawn together in what appeared to be a menacing combination. It has\r\nbeen, for some time past, a cardinal principle of German policy to support\r\nher ally in the Balkans, and this determination has been increased by\r\nGerman ambitions in the East. The ancient dream of Russia to possess\r\nConstantinople has been countered by the new German dream of a hegemony\r\nover the near East based upon the through route from Berlin via Vienna and\r\nConstantinople to Bagdad; and this political opposition has been of late\r\nyears the determining factor in the relationship of the two Powers. The\r\ndanger of a Russo-German conflict has thus been very great, and since the\r\nRusso-French Entente Germany, as we have already pointed out, has seen\r\nherself menaced on either front by a war which would immediately endanger\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nTurning once more to the Belgian dispatches, we find such hints as the\r\nfollowing. On October 24, 1912, the Comte de Lalaing, Belgian Ambassador\r\nto London, writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n  The French Ambassador, who must have special reasons for speaking\r\n  thus, has repeated to me several times that the greatest danger for\r\n  the maintenance of the peace of Europe consists in the indiscipline and\r\n  the personal policy of the Russian agents. They are almost all ardent\r\n  Panslavists, and it is to them that must be imputed the responsibility\r\n  for the events that are occurring. Beyond a doubt they will make\r\n  themselves the secret instigators for an intervention of their country\r\n  in the Balkan conflict.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 1912, Baron de Beyens writes from Berlin:--\r\n\r\n  At the end of last week a report was spread in the chancelleries of\r\n  Europe that M. Sazonov had abandoned the struggle against the Court\r\n  party which wishes to drag Russia into war.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1914, Baron Guillaume writes from Paris:--\r\n\r\n  Is it true that the Cabinet of St. Petersburg has imposed upon this\r\n  country [France] the adoption of the law of three years, and would\r\n  now bring to bear the whole weight of its influence to ensure its\r\n  maintenance? I have not been able to obtain light upon this delicate\r\n  point, but it would be all the more serious, inasmuch as the men who\r\n  direct the Empire of the Tsars cannot be unaware that the effort thus\r\n  demanded of the French nation is excessive, and cannot be long sustained.\r\n  Is, then, the attitude of the Cabinet of St. Petersburg based upon the\r\n  conviction that events are so imminent that it will be possible to use\r\n  the tool it intends to put into the hands of its ally?\r\n\r\nWhat a sinister vista is opened up by this passage! I have no wish to\r\ninsinuate that the suspicion here expressed was justified. It is the\r\nsuspicion itself that is the point. Dimly we see, as through a mist, the\r\nfigures of the architects of war. We see that the forces they wield are\r\nambition and pride, jealousy and fear; that these are all-pervasive; that\r\nthey affect all Governments and all nations, and are fostered by conditions\r\nfor which all alike are responsible.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood, of course, that in bringing out the fact that there\r\nwas national chauvinism in Russia and that this found its excuse in the\r\nunstable equilibrium of Europe, I am making no attack on Russian policy.\r\nI do not pretend to know whether these elements of opinion actually\r\ninfluenced the policy of the Government. But they certainly influenced\r\nGerman fears, and without a knowledge of them it is impossible to\r\nunderstand German policy. The reader must bear in mind this source of\r\nfriction along with the others when we come to consider that policy in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Austria-Hungary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to Austria-Hungary, we find in her the Power to whom the\r\nimmediate occasion of the war was due, the Power, moreover, who contributed\r\nin large measure to its remoter causes. Austria-Hungary is a State, but not\r\na nation. It has no natural bond to hold its populations together, and it\r\ncontinues its political existence by force and fraud, by the connivance and\r\nthe self-interest of other States, rather than by any inherent principle of\r\nvitality. It is in relation to the Balkan States that this instability has\r\nbeen most marked and most dangerous. Since the kingdom of Serbia acquired\r\nits independent existence it has been a centre drawing to itself the\r\ndiscontent and the ambitions of the Slav populations under the Dual\r\nMonarchy. The realization of those ambitions implies the disruption of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian State. But behind the Southern Slavs stands Russia, and\r\nany attempt to change the political status in the Balkans has thus meant,\r\nfor years past, acute risk of war between the two Empires that border them.\r\nThis political rivalry has accentuated the racial antagonism between German\r\nand Slav, and was the immediate origin of the war which presents itself to\r\nEnglishmen as one primarily between Germany and the Western Powers.\r\n\r\nOn the position of Italy it is not necessary to dwell. It had long been\r\nsuspected that she was a doubtful factor in the Triple Alliance, and the\r\nevent has proved that this suspicion was correct. But though Italy has\r\nparticipated in the war, her action had no part in producing it. And we\r\nneed not here indicate the course and the motives of her policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Germany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus indicated briefly the position, the perils, and the ambitions\r\nof the other Great Powers of Europe, let us turn to consider the proper\r\nsubject of this essay, the policy of Germany. And first let us dwell on the\r\nall-important fact that Germany, as a Great Power, is a creation of the\r\nlast fifty years. Before 1866 there was a loose confederation of German\r\nStates, after 1870 there was an Empire of the Germans. The transformation\r\nwas the work of Bismarck, and it was accomplished by \"blood and iron.\"\r\nWhether it could have been accomplished otherwise is matter of speculation.\r\nThat it was accomplished so is a fact, and a fact of tragic significance.\r\nFor it established among Germans the prestige of force and fraud, and gave\r\nthem as their national hero the man whose most characteristic act was the\r\nfalsification of the Ems telegram. If the unification could have been\r\nachieved in 1848 instead of in 1870, if the free and generous idealism of\r\nthat epoch could have triumphed, as it deserved to, if Germans had not\r\nbartered away their souls for the sake of the kingdom of this world, we\r\nmight have been spared this last and most terrible act in the bloody drama\r\nof European history. If even, after 1866, 1870 had not been provoked, the\r\ncatastrophe that is destroying Europe before our eyes might never have\r\noverwhelmed us. In the crisis of 1870 the French minister who fought so\r\nlong and with such tenacity, for peace saw and expressed, with the lucidity\r\nof his nation, what the real issue was for Germany and for Europe:--\r\n\r\n  There exists, it is true, a barbarous Germany, greedy of battles and\r\n  conquest, the Germany of the country squires; there exists a Germany\r\n  pharisaic and iniquitous, the Germany of all the unintelligible pedants\r\n  whose empty lucubrations and microscopic researches have been so unduly\r\n  vaunted. But these two Germanies are not the great Germany, that of\r\n  the artists, the poets, the thinkers, that of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,\r\n  Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Leibnitz, Kant, Hegel, Liebig. This latter\r\n  Germany is good, generous, humane, pacific; it finds expression in the\r\n  touching phrase of Goethe, who when asked to write against us replied\r\n  that he could not find it in his heart to hate the French. If we do not\r\n  oppose the natural movement of German unity, if we allow it to complete\r\n  itself quietly by successive stages, it will not give supremacy to the\r\n  barbarous and sophistical Germany, it will assure it to the Germany of\r\n  intellect and culture. War, on the other hand, would establish, during\r\n  a time impossible to calculate, the domination of the Germany of the\r\n  squires and the pedants.[1]\r\n\r\nThe generous dream was not to be realized. French chauvinism fell into\r\nthe trap Bismarck had prepared for it. Yet even at the last moment his war\r\nwould have escaped him had he not recaptured it by fraud. The publication\r\nof the Ems telegram made the conflict inevitable, and one of the most\r\nhideous and sinister scenes in all history is that in which the three\r\nconspirators, Bismarck, Moltke, and Roon, \"suddenly recovered their\r\npleasure in eating and drinking,\" because, by publishing a lie, they\r\nhad secured the certain death in battle of hundreds and thousands of\r\nyoung men. The spirit of Bismarck has infected the whole public life\r\nof Germany and of Europe. It has given a new lease to the political\r\nphilosophy of Machiavelli; and made of every budding statesman and\r\nhistorian a solemn or a cynical defender of the gospel of force. But,\r\nthough this be true, we have no right therefore to assume that there is\r\nsome peculiar wickedness which marks off German policy from that of all\r\nother nations. Machiavellianism is the common heritage of Europe. It is\r\nthe translation into idea of the fact of international anarchy. Germans\r\nhave been more candid and brutal than others in their expression and\r\napplication of it, but statesmen, politicians, publicists, and historians\r\nin every nation accept it, under a thicker or thinner veil of plausible\r\nsophisms. It is everywhere the iron hand within the silken glove. It is\r\nthe great European tradition.\r\n\r\nAlthough, moreover, it was by these methods that Bismarck accomplished\r\nthe unification of Germany, his later policy was, by common consent, a\r\npolicy of peace. War had done its part, and the new Germany required all\r\nits energies to build up its internal prosperity and strength. In 1875,\r\nit is true, Bismarck was credited with the intention to fall once more\r\nupon France. The fact does not seem to be clearly established. At any\r\nrate, if such was his intention, it was frustrated by the intervention of\r\nRussia and of Great Britain. During the thirty-nine years that followed\r\nGermany kept the peace.\r\n\r\nWhile France, England, and Russia waged wars on a great scale, and while\r\nthe former Powers acquired enormous extensions of territory, the only\r\nmilitary operations undertaken by Germany were against African natives\r\nin her dependencies and against China in 1900. The conduct of the German\r\ntroops appears, it is true, to have been distinguished, in this latter\r\nexpedition, by a brutality which stood out in relief even in that orgy of\r\nslaughter and loot. But we must remember that they were specially ordered\r\nby their Imperial master, in the name of Jesus Christ, to show no mercy\r\nand give no quarter. Apart from this, it will not be disputed, by any one\r\nwho knows the facts, that during the first twenty years or so after 1875\r\nGermany was the Power whose diplomacy was the least disturbing to Europe.\r\nThe chief friction during that period was between Russia and France and\r\nGreat Britain, and it was one or other of these Powers, according to the\r\nangle of vision, which was regarded as offering the menace of aggression.\r\nIf there has been a German plot against the peace of the world, it does\r\nnot date from before the decade 1890-1900. The close of that decade\r\nmarks, in fact, a new epoch in German policy. The years of peace had\r\nbeen distinguished by the development of industry and trade and internal\r\norganization. The population increased from forty millions in 1870 to over\r\nsixty-five millions at the present date. Foreign trade increased more than\r\nten-fold. National pride and ambition grew with the growth of prosperity\r\nand force, and sentiment as well as need impelled German policy to claim\r\na share of influence outside Europe in that greater world for the control\r\nof which the other nations were struggling. Already Bismarck, though with\r\nreluctance and scepticism, had acquired for his country by negotiation\r\nlarge areas in Africa. But that did not satisfy the ambitions of the\r\ncolonial party. The new Kaiser put himself at the head of the new movement,\r\nand announced that henceforth nothing must be done in any part of the world\r\nwithout the cognizance and acquiescence of Germany.\r\n\r\nThus there entered a new competitor upon the stage of the world, and\r\nhis advent of necessity was disconcerting and annoying to the earlier\r\ncomers. But is there reason to suppose that, from that moment, German\r\npolicy was definitely aiming at empire, and was prepared to provoke war\r\nto achieve it? Strictly, no answer can be given to this question. The\r\nremoter intentions of statesmen are rarely avowed to others, and, perhaps,\r\nrarely to themselves. Their policy is, indeed, less continuous, less\r\ndefinite, and more at the mercy of events than observers or critics are\r\napt to suppose. It is not probable that Germany, any more than any other\r\ncountry in Europe, was pursuing during those years a definite plan,\r\nthought out and predetermined in every point.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as elsewhere, both in home and foreign affairs, there was an\r\nintense and unceasing conflict of competing forces and ideas. In Germany,\r\nas elsewhere, policy must have adapted itself to circumstances, different\r\npersonalities must have given it different directions at different times.\r\nWe have not the information at our disposal which would enable us to trace\r\nin detail the devious course of diplomacy in any of the countries of\r\nEurope. What we know something about is the general situation, and the\r\naction, in fact, taken at certain moments. The rest must be, for the\r\npresent, mainly matter of conjecture. With this word of caution, let\r\nus now proceed to examine the policy of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe general situation we have already indicated. We have shown how the\r\narmed peace, which is the chronic malady of Europe, had assumed during the\r\nten years from 1904 to 1914 that specially dangerous form which grouped the\r\nGreat Powers in two opposite camps--the Triple Alliance and the Triple\r\nEntente. We have seen, in the case of Great Britain, France, Russia, and\r\nAustria-Hungary, how they came to take their places in that constellation.\r\nWe have now to put Germany in its setting in the picture.\r\n\r\nGermany, then, in the first place, like the other Powers, had occasion\r\nto anticipate war. It might be made from the West, on the question of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine; it might be made from the East, on the question of the\r\nBalkans. In either case, the system of alliances was likely to bring into\r\nplay other States than those immediately involved, and the German Powers\r\nmight find themselves attacked on all fronts, while they knew in the\r\nlatter years that they could not count upon the support of Italy.\r\n\r\nA reasonable prudence, if nothing else, must keep Germany armed and\r\napprehensive. But besides the maintenance of what she had, Germany was\r\nnow ambitious to secure her share of \"world-power.\" Let us examine in\r\nwhat spirit and by what acts she endeavoured to make her claim good.\r\n\r\nFirst, what was the tone of public opinion in Germany during these\r\ncritical years?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Emile Ollivier, \"L'Empire Libéral.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Opinion in Germany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the outbreak of the war the pamphlet literature in the countries of\r\nthe Entente has been full of citations from German political writers. In\r\nEngland, in particular, the names and works of Bernhardi and of Treitschke\r\nhave become more familiar than they appear to have been in Germany prior to\r\nthe war. This method of selecting for polemical purposes certain tendencies\r\nof sentiment and theory, and ignoring all others, is one which could be\r\napplied, with damaging results, to any country in the world. Mr. Angell has\r\nshown in his \"Prussianism in England\" how it might be applied to ourselves;\r\nand a German, no doubt, into whose hands that book might fall would draw\r\nconclusions about public opinion here similar to those which we have drawn\r\nabout public opinion in Germany. There is jingoism in all countries, as\r\nthere is pacifism in all countries. Nevertheless, I think it is true to\r\nsay that the jingoism of Germany has been peculiar both in its intensity\r\nand in its character. This special quality appears to be due both to the\r\ntemperament and to the recent history of the German nation. The Germans are\r\nromantic, as the French are impulsive, the English sentimental, and the\r\nRussians religious. There is some real meaning in these generalisations.\r\nThey are easily to be felt when one comes into contact with a nation,\r\nthough they may be hard to establish or define. When I say that the Germans\r\nare romantic, I mean that they do not easily or willingly see things as\r\nthey are. Their temperament is like a medium of coloured glass. It\r\nmagnifies, distorts, conceals, transmutes. And this is as true when their\r\nintellectual attitude is realistic as when it is idealistic. In the Germany\r\nof the past, the Germany of small States, to which all non-Germans look\r\nback with such sympathy and such regret, their thinkers and poets were\r\ninspired by grandiose intellectual abstractions. They saw ideas, like gods,\r\nmoving the world, and actual men and women, actual events and things, were\r\nbut the passing symbols of these supernatural powers; 1866 and 1870 ended\r\nall that. The unification of Germany, in the way we have discussed,\r\ndiverted all their interest from speculation about the universe, life, and\r\nmankind, to the material interests of their new country. Germany became the\r\npreoccupation of all Germans. From abstractions they turned with a new\r\nintoxication to what they conceived to be the concrete. Entering thus late\r\nupon the stage of national politics, they devoted themselves, with their\r\naccustomed thoroughness, to learning and bettering what they conceived\r\nto be the principles and the practice which had given success to other\r\nnations. In this quest no scruples should deter them, no sentimentality\r\nhamper, no universal ideals distract. Yet this, after all, was but German\r\nromanticism assuming another form. The objects, it is true, were different.\r\n\"Actuality\" had taken the place of ideals, Germany of Humanity. But by\r\nthe German vision the new objects were no less distorted than the old.\r\nIn dealing with \"Real-politik\" (which is the German translation of\r\nMachiavellianism), with \"expansion,\" with \"survival of the fittest,\"\r\nand all the other shibboleths of world-policy, their outlook remained\r\nas absolute and abstract as before, as contemptuous of temperament and\r\nmeasure, as blind to those compromises and qualifications, those decencies,\r\nso to speak, of nature, by which reality is constituted. The Germans now\r\nsaw men instead of gods, but they saw them as trees walking.\r\n\r\nGerman imperialism, then, while it involves the same intellectual\r\npresuppositions, the same confusions, the same erroneous arguments, the\r\nsame short-sighted ambitions, as the imperialism of other countries,\r\nexhibits them all in an extreme degree. All peoples admire themselves. But\r\nthe self-adoration of Germans is so naive, so frank, so unqualified, as to\r\nseem sheerly ridiculous to more experienced nations.[1] The English and the\r\nFrench, too, believe their civilization to be the best in the world. But\r\nEnglish common-sense and French sanity would prevent them from announcing\r\nto other peoples that they proposed to conquer them, morally or materially,\r\nfor their good. All Jingoes admire and desire war. But nowhere else in the\r\nmodern world is to be found such a debauch of \"romantic\" enthusiasm, such\r\na wilful blindness to all the realities of war, as Germany has manifested\r\nboth before and since the outbreak of this world-catastrophe. A reader\r\nof German newspapers and tracts gets at last a feeling of nausea at the\r\nvery words _Wir Deutsche_, followed by the eternal _Helden, Heldenthum,\r\nHeldenthat_, and is inclined to thank God if he indeed belong to a nation\r\nsane enough to be composed of _Händler_.\r\n\r\nThe very antithesis between _Helden_ (heroes) and _Händler_ (hucksters),\r\nwith which all Germany is ringing, is an illustration of the romantic\r\nquality that vitiates their intelligence. In spite of the fact that they\r\nare one of the greatest trading and manufacturing nations of the world, and\r\nthat precisely the fear of losing their trade and markets has been, as they\r\nconstantly assert, a chief cause that has driven them to war, they speak\r\nas though Germany were a kind of knight-errant, innocent of all material\r\nambitions, wandering through the world in the pure, disinterested service\r\nof God and man. On the other hand, because England is a great commercial\r\nPower, they suppose that no Englishman lives for anything but profit.\r\nBecause they themselves have conscription, and have to fight or be shot,\r\nthey infer that every German is a noble warrior. Because the English\r\nvolunteer, they assume that they only volunteer for their pay. Germany,\r\nto them, is a hero clad in white armour, magnanimous, long-suffering, and\r\ninvincible. Other nations are little seedy figures in black coats, inspired\r\nexclusively by hatred and jealousy of the noble German, incapable of a\r\ngenerous emotion or an honourable act, and destined, by the judgment of\r\nhistory, to be saved, if they can be saved at all, by the great soul and\r\ndominating intellect of the Teuton.\r\n\r\nIt is in this intoxicating atmosphere of temperament and mood that\r\nthe ideas and ambitions of German imperialists work and move. They are\r\nessentially the same as those of imperialists in other countries. Their\r\nphilosophy of history assumes an endless series of wars, due to the\r\ninevitable expansion of rival States. Their ethics means a belief in force\r\nand a disbelief in everything else. Their science is a crude misapplication\r\nof Darwinism, combined with invincible ignorance of the true bearings of\r\nscience upon life, and especially of those facts and deductions about\r\nbiological heredity which, once they are understood, will make it plain\r\nthat war degrades the stock of all nations, victorious and vanquished\r\nalike, and that the decline of civilizations is far more plausibly to be\r\nattributed to this cause than to the moral decadence of which history\r\nis always ready, after the event, to accuse the defeated Power. One\r\npeculiarity, perhaps, there is in the outlook of German imperialism,\r\nand that is its emphasis on an unintelligible and unreal abstraction of\r\n\"race.\" Germans, it is thought, are by biological quality the salt of\r\nthe earth. Every really great man in Europe, since the break-up of the\r\nRoman Empire, has been a German, even though it might appear, at first\r\nsight, to an uninstructed observer, that he was an Italian or a Frenchman\r\nor a Spaniard. Not all Germans, however, are, they hold, as yet included\r\nin the German Empire, or even in the German-Austrian combination. The\r\nFlemish are Germans, the Dutch are Germans, the English even are Germans,\r\nor were before the war had made them, in Germany's eyes, the offscouring\r\nof mankind. Thus, a great task lies before the German Empire: on the one\r\nhand, to bring within its fold the German stocks that have strayed from\r\nit in the wanderings of history; on the other, to reduce under German\r\nauthority those other stocks that are not worthy to share directly in the\r\ncitizenship of the Fatherland. The dreams of conquest which are the real\r\nessence of all imperialism are thus supported in Germany by arguments\r\npeculiar to Germans. But the arguments put forward are not the real\r\ndeterminants of the attitude. The attitude, in any country, whatever it\r\nmay be called, rests at bottom on sheer national vanity. It is the belief\r\nin the inherent superiority of one's own civilization, and the desire to\r\nextend it, by force if need be, throughout the world. It matters little\r\nwhat arguments in its support this passion to dominate may garner from\r\nthat twilight region in which the advanced guard of science is labouring\r\npatiently to comprehend Nature and mankind. Men take from the treasury of\r\ntruth what they are able to take. And what imperialists take is a mirror\r\nto their own ambition and pride.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the ambitions of this German jingoism there is no manner of\r\ndoubt. Germans are nothing if not frank. And this kind of German does\r\nwant to conquer and annex, not only outside Europe but within it. We must\r\nnot, however, infer that the whole of Germany has been infected with this\r\nvirus. The summary I have set down in the last few pages represents the\r\nimpression made on an unsympathetic mind by the literature of Pangermanism.\r\nEmerging from such reading--and it is the principal reading of German\r\norigin which has been offered to the British public since the war--there\r\nis a momentary illusion, \"That is Germany!\" Of course it is not, any more\r\nthan the _Morning Post_ or the _National Review_ is England. Germans, in\r\nfact, during recent years have taken a prominent place in pacifism as well\r\nas in imperialism. Men like Schücking and Quidde and Fried are at least as\r\nwell known as men like Treitschke and Bernhardi. Opinion in Germany, as in\r\nevery other country, has been various and conflicting. And the pacific\r\ntendencies have been better organized, if not more active, there than\r\nelsewhere, for they have been associated with the huge and disciplined\r\nforces of the Social-Democrats. Indeed, the mass of the people, left\r\nalone, is everywhere pacific. I do not forget the very important fact\r\nthat German education, elementary and higher, has been deliberately\r\ndirected to inculcate patriotic feeling, that the doctrine of armed\r\nforce as the highest manifestation of the State has been industriously\r\npropagated by the authorities, and that the unification of Germany by\r\nforce has given to the cult of force a meaning and a popularity probably\r\nunknown in any other country. But in most men, for good or for evil, the\r\nlessons of education can be quickly obliterated by the experience of life.\r\nIn particular, the mass of the people everywhere, face to face with the\r\nnecessities of existence, knowing what it is to work and to struggle, to\r\nco-operate and to compete, to suffer and to relieve suffering, though they\r\nmay be less well-informed than the instructed classes, are also less liable\r\nto obsession by abstractions. They see little, but they see it straight.\r\nAnd though, being men, with the long animal inheritance of men behind them,\r\ntheir passions may be roused by any cry of battle, though they are the\r\nfore-ordained dupes of those who direct the policy of nations, yet it is\r\nnot their initiative that originates wars. They do not desire conquest,\r\nthey do not trouble about \"race\" or chatter about the \"survival of the\r\nfittest.\" It is their own needs, which are also the vital needs of society,\r\nthat preoccupy their thoughts; and it is real goods that direct and inspire\r\ntheir genuine idealism.\r\n\r\nWe must, then, disabuse ourselves of the notion so naturally produced by\r\nreading, and especially by reading in time of war, that the German Jingoes\r\nare typical of Germany. They are there, they are a force, they have to be\r\nreckoned with. But exactly how great a force? Exactly how influential on\r\npolicy? That is a question which I imagine can only be answered by guesses.\r\nWould the reader, for instance, undertake to estimate the influence during\r\nthe last fifteen years on British policy and opinion of the imperialist\r\nminority in this country? No two men, I think, would agree about it. And\r\nfew men would agree with themselves from one day or one week to another.\r\nWe are reduced to conjecture. But the conjectures of some people are of\r\nmore value than those of others, for they are based on a wider converse.\r\nI think it therefore not without importance to recall to the reader the\r\naccounts of the state of opinion in Germany given by well-qualified foreign\r\nobservers in the years immediately preceding the war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As I write I come across the following, cited from a book of\r\nsongs composed for German combatants under the title \"Der deutsche Zorn\":--\r\n\r\n  Wir sind die Meister aller Welt\r\n  In allen ernsten Dingen,\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Was Man als fremd euch höchlichst preist\r\n  Um eurer Einfalt Willen,\r\n  Ist deutschen Ursprungs allermeist,\r\n  Und trägt nur fremde Hüllen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Opinion about Germany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the crisis of Agadir, M. Georges Bourdon visited Germany to make an\r\ninquiry for the _Figaro_ newspaper into the state of opinion there. His\r\nmission belongs to the period between Agadir and the outbreak of the first\r\nBalkan war. He interviewed a large number of people, statesmen, publicists,\r\nprofessors, politicians. He does not sum up his impressions, and such\r\nsummary as I can give here is no doubt affected by the emphasis of my\r\nown mind. His book,[1] however, is now translated into English, and the\r\nreader has the opportunity of correcting the impression I give him.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with Pangermanism, on which M. Bourdon has a very interesting\r\nchapter. He feels for the propaganda of that sect the repulsion that must\r\nbe felt by every sane and liberal-minded man:--\r\n\r\n  Wretched, choleric Pangermans, exasperated and unbalanced, brothers\r\n  of all the exasperated, wretched windbags whose tirades, in all\r\n  countries, answer to yours, and whom you are wrong to count your\r\n  enemies! Pangermans of the Spree and the Main, who, on the other side\r\n  of the frontier, receive the fraternal effusions of Russian Pan-Slavism,\r\n  Italian irredentism, English imperialism, French nationalism! What is it\r\n  that you want?\r\n\r\nThey want, he replies, part of Austria, Switzerland, Flanders, Luxemburg,\r\nDenmark, Holland, for all these are \"Germanic\" countries! They want\r\ncolonies. They want a bigger army and a bigger navy. \"An execrable race,\r\nthese Pangermans!\" \"They have the yellow skin, the dry mouth, the green\r\ncomplexion of the bilious. They do not live under the sky, they avoid the\r\nlight. Hidden in their cellars, they pore over treaties, cite newspaper\r\narticles, grow pale over maps, measure angles, quibble over texts or traces\r\nof frontiers.\" \"The Pangerman is a propagandist and a revivalist.\" \"But,\"\r\nM. Bourdon adds, \"when he shouts we must not think we hear in his tones the\r\nreverberations of the German soul.\" The organs of the party seemed few and\r\nunimportant. The party itself was spoken of with contempt. \"They talk\r\nloud,\" M. Bourdon was told, \"but have no real following; it is only in\r\nFrance that people attend to them.\" Nevertheless, M. Bourdon concluded\r\nthey were not negligible. For, in the first place, they have power to\r\nevoke the jingoism of the German public--a jingoism which the violent\r\npatriotism of the people, their tradition of victorious force, their\r\neducation, their dogma of race, continually keep alive. And, secondly,\r\nthe Government, when it thinks it useful, turns to the Pangermans for\r\nassistance, and lets loose their propaganda in the press. Their influence\r\nthus waxes and wanes, as it is favoured, or not, by authority. \"Like the\r\ngiant Antaeus,\" a correspondent wrote to M. Bourdon, \"Pangermanism loses\r\nits force when it quits the soil of government.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, however, that the Pangerman propaganda purports\r\nto be based upon fear. If they urge increased armaments, it is with a\r\nview to defence. \"I considered it a patriotic duty,\" wrote General Keim,\r\n\"in my quality of president of the German League for Defence, to demand\r\nan increase of effectives such that France should find it out of the\r\nquestion to dream of a victorious war against us, even with the help of\r\nother nations.\" \"To the awakening of the national sentiment in France\r\nthere is only one reply--the increase of the German forces.\" \"I have the\r\nimpression,\" said Count Reventlow, \"that a warlike spirit which is new is\r\ndeveloping in France. There is the danger.\" Thus in Germany, as elsewhere,\r\neven jingoism took the mask of necessary precaution. And so it must be, and\r\nwill be everywhere, as long as the European anarchy continues. For what\r\nnation has ever admitted an intention or desire to make aggressive war?\r\nM. Bourdon, then, takes full account of Pangermanism. Nor does he neglect\r\nthe general militaristic tendencies of German opinion. He found pride\r\nin the army, a determination to be strong, and that belief that it is in\r\nwar that the State expresses itself at the highest and the best, which is\r\npart of the tradition of German education since the days of Treitschke.\r\nYet, in spite of all this, to which M. Bourdon does full justice, the\r\ngeneral impression made by the conversations he records is that the bulk\r\nof opinion in Germany was strongly pacific. There was apprehension indeed,\r\napprehension of France and apprehension of England. \"England certainly\r\npreoccupies opinion more than France. People are alarmed by her movements\r\nand her armaments.\" \"The constant interventions of England have undoubtedly\r\nirritated the public.\" Germany, therefore, must arm and arm again. \"A great\r\nwar may be delayed, but not prevented, unless German armaments are such as\r\nto put fear into the heart of every possible adversary.\"\r\n\r\nGermany feared that war might come, but she did not want it--that, in sum,\r\nwas M. Bourdon's impression. From soldiers, statesmen, professors, business\r\nmen, again and again, the same assurance. \"The sentiment you will find most\r\ngenerally held is undoubtedly that of peace.\" \"Few think about war. We need\r\npeace too much.\" \"War! War between us! What an idea! Why, it would mean a\r\nEuropean war, something monstrous, something which would surpass in horror\r\nanything the world has ever seen! My dear sir, only madmen could desire or\r\nconceive such a calamity! It must be avoided at all costs.\" \"What counts\r\nabove all here is commercial interest. All who live by it are, here as\r\nelsewhere, almost too pacific.\" \"Under the economic conditions prevailing\r\nin Germany, the most glorious victory she can aspire to--it is a soldier\r\nwho says it--is peace!\"\r\n\r\nThe impression thus gathered from M. Bourdon's observations is confirmed\r\nat every point by those of Baron Beyens, who went to Berlin as Belgian\r\nminister after the crisis of Agadir.[2] Of the world of business he says:--\r\n\r\n  All these gentlemen appeared to be convinced partisans of peace....\r\n  According to them, the tranquillity of Europe had not been for a moment\r\n  seriously menaced during the crisis of Agadir.... Industrial Germany\r\n  required to live on good terms with France. Peace was necessary to\r\n  business, and German finance in particular had every interest in the\r\n  maintenance of its profitable relations with French finance.[3] At the\r\n  end of a few months I had the impression that these pacifists personified\r\n  then--in 1912--the most common, the most widely spread, though the least\r\n  noisy, opinion, the opinion of the majority, understanding by the\r\n  majority, not that of the governing classes but that of the nation\r\n  as a whole (p. 172).\r\n\r\nThe mass of the people, Beyens held, loved peace, and dreaded war. That was\r\nthe case, not only with all the common people, but also with the managers\r\nand owners of businesses and the wholesale and retail merchants. Even in\r\nBerlin society and among the ancient German nobility there were to be found\r\nsincere pacifists. On the other hand, there was certainly a bellicose\r\nminority. It was composed largely of soldiers, both active and retired;\r\nthe latter especially looking with envy and disgust on the increasing\r\nprosperity of the commercial classes, and holding that a \"blood-letting\r\nwould be wholesome to purge and regenerate the social body\"--a view not\r\nconfined to Germany, and one which has received classical expression in\r\nTennyson's \"Maud.\" To this movement belonged also the high officials, the\r\nConservative parties, patriots and journalists, and of course the armament\r\nfirms, deliberate fomenters of war in Germany, as everywhere else, in order\r\nto put money into their pockets. To these must be added the \"intellectual\r\nflower of the universities and the schools.\" \"The professors at the\r\nuniversities, taken _en bloc_, were one of the most violent elements in\r\nthe nation.\" \"Almost all the young people from one end of the Empire to\r\nthe other have had brought before them in the course of their studies\r\nthe dilemma which Bernhardi summed up to his readers in the three words\r\n'world-power or decadence.' Yet with all this, the resolute partisans of\r\nwar formed as I thought a very small minority in the nation. That is the\r\nimpression I obstinately retain of my sojourn in Berlin and my excursions\r\ninto the provinces of the Empire, rich or poor. When I recall the image\r\nof this peaceful population, journeying to business every week-day with a\r\nmovement so regular, or seated at table on Sundays in the cafés in the open\r\nair before a glass of beer, I can find in my memories nothing but placid\r\nfaces where there was no trace of violent passions, no thought hostile to\r\nforeigners, not even that feverish concern with the struggle for existence\r\nwhich the spectacle of the human crowd has sometimes shown me elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nA similar impression is given by the dispatch from M. Cambon, French\r\nAmbassador to Berlin, written on July 30, 1913.[4] He, too, finds elements\r\nworking for war, and analyses them much as Baron Beyens does. There are\r\nfirst the \"junkers,\" or country squires, naturally military by all their\r\ntraditions, but also afraid of the death-duties \"which are bound to come\r\nif peace continues.\" Secondly, the \"higher bourgeoisie\"--that is, the\r\ngreat manufacturers and financiers, and, of course, in particular the\r\narmament firms. Both these social classes are influenced, not only by\r\ndirect pecuniary motives but by the fear of the rising democracy, which\r\nis beginning to swamp their representatives in the Reichstag. Thirdly,\r\nthe officials, the \"party of the pensioned.\" Fourthly, the universities,\r\nthe \"historians, philosophers, political pamphleteers, and other apologists\r\nof German Kultur.\" Fifthly, rancorous diplomatists, with a sense that they\r\nhad been duped. On the other hand, there were, as M. Cambon insists, other\r\nforces in the country making for peace. What were these? In numbers the\r\ngreat bulk, in Germany as in all countries. \"The mass of the workmen,\r\nartisans and peasants, who are peace-loving by instinct.\" Such of the great\r\nnobles as were intelligent enough to recognize the \"disastrous political\r\nand social consequences of war.\" \"Numerous manufacturers, merchants, and\r\nfinanciers in a moderate way of business.\" The non-German elements of the\r\nEmpire. Finally, the Government and the governing classes in the large\r\nsouthern States. A goodly array of peace forces! According to M. Cambon,\r\nhowever, all these latter elements \"are only a sort of make-weight in\r\npolitical matters with limited influence on public opinion, or they are\r\nsilent social forces, passive and defenceless against the infection of\r\na wave of warlike feeling.\" This last sentence is pregnant. It describes\r\nthe state of affairs existing, more or less, in all countries; a few\r\nindividuals, a few groups or cliques, making for war more or less\r\ndeliberately; the mass of the people ignorant and unconcerned, but also\r\ndefenceless against suggestion, and ready to respond to the call to war,\r\nwith submission or with enthusiasm, as soon as the call is made by their\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOn the testimony, then, of these witnesses, all shrewd and competent\r\nobservers, it may be permitted to sum up somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately preceding the war the mass of the people in\r\nGermany, rich and poor, were attached to peace and dreaded war. But there\r\nwas there also a powerful minority either desiring war or expecting it,\r\nand, in either case, preparing it by their agitation. And this minority\r\ncould appeal to the peculiarly aggressive form of patriotism inculcated by\r\nthe public schools and universities. The war party based its appeal for\r\never fresh armaments on the hostile preparations of the Powers of the\r\nEntente. Its aggressive ambition masqueraded, perhaps even to itself,\r\nas a patriotism apprehensively concerned with defence. It was supported\r\nby powerful moneyed interests; and the mass of the people, passive,\r\nill-informed, preoccupied, were defenceless against its agitation. The\r\nGerman Government found the Pangermans embarrassing or convenient according\r\nas the direction of its policy and the European situation changed from\r\ncrisis to crisis. They were thus at one moment negligible, at another\r\npowerful. For long they agitated vainly, and they might long have continued\r\nto do so. But if the moment should come at which the Government should make\r\nthe fatal plunge, their efforts would have contributed to the result, their\r\nwarnings would seem to have been justified, and they would triumph as\r\nthe party of patriots that had foretold in vain the coming crash to an\r\nunbelieving nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"L'Enigme Allemande,\" 1914.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" pp. 97 seq. and 170 seq.\r\nBruxelles, 1915.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A Frenchman, M. Maurice Ajam, who made an inquiry among\r\nbusiness men in 1913 came to the same conclusion. \"Peace! I write that all\r\nthe Germans without exception, when they belong to the world of business,\r\nare fanatical partisans of the maintenance of European peace.\" See Yves\r\nGuyot, \"Les causes et les conséquences de la guerre,\" p. 226.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See French Yellow Book, No. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _German Policy, from 1890-1900_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus examined the atmosphere of opinion in which the German\r\nGovernment moved, let us proceed to consider the actual course of their\r\npolicy during the critical years, fifteen or so, that preceded the war.\r\nThe policy admittedly and openly was one of \"expansion.\" But \"expansion\"\r\nwhere? It seems to be rather widely supposed that Germany was preparing war\r\nin order to annex territory in Europe. The contempt of German imperialists,\r\nfrom Treitschke onward, for the rights of small States, the racial theories\r\nwhich included in \"German\" territory Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, and the\r\nScandinavian countries, may seem to give colour to this idea. But it would\r\nbe hazardous to assume that German statesmen were seriously influenced\r\nfor years by the lucubrations of Mr. Houston Stewart Chamberlain and\r\nhis followers. Nor can a long-prepared policy of annexation in Europe\r\nbe inferred from the fact that Belgium and France were invaded after the\r\nwar broke out, or even from the present demand among German parties that\r\nthe territories occupied should be retained. If it could be maintained\r\nthat the seizure of territory during war, or even its retention after\r\nit, is evidence that the territory was the object of the war, it would\r\nbe legitimate also to infer that the British Empire has gone to war\r\nto annex German colonies, a conclusion which Englishmen would probably\r\nreject with indignation. In truth, before the war, the view that it was\r\nthe object of German policy to annex European territory would have found,\r\nI think, few, if any, supporters among well-informed and unprejudiced\r\nobservers. I note, for instance, that Mr. Dawson, whose opinion on such\r\na point is probably better worth having than that of any other Englishman,\r\nin his book, \"The Evolution of Modern Germany,\"[1] when discussing the aims\r\nof German policy does not even refer to the idea that annexations in Europe\r\nare contemplated.\r\n\r\nSo far as the evidence at present goes, I do not think a case can be\r\nmade out for the view that German policy was aiming during these years\r\nat securing the hegemony of Europe by annexing European territory. The\r\nexpansion Germany was seeking was that of trade and markets. And her\r\nstatesmen and people, like those of other countries, were under the\r\nbelief that, to secure this, it was necessary to acquire colonies. This\r\nambition, up to a point, she was able, in fact, to fulfil, not by force\r\nbut by agreement with the other Powers. The Berlin Act of 1885 was one\r\nof the wisest and most far-seeing achievements of European policy. By it\r\nthe partition of a great part of the African continent between the Powers\r\nwas peaceably accomplished, and Germany emerged with possessions to the\r\nextent of 377,000 square miles and an estimated population of 1,700,000.\r\nBy 1906 her colonial domain had been increased to over two and a half\r\nmillion square miles, and its population to over twelve millions; and all\r\nof this had been acquired without war with any civilized nation. In spite\r\nof her late arrival on the scene as a colonial Power, Germany had thus\r\nsecured without war an empire overseas, not comparable, indeed, to that\r\nof Great Britain or of France, but still considerable in extent and\r\n(as Germans believed) in economic promise, and sufficient to give them\r\nthe opportunity they desired to show their capacity as pioneers of\r\ncivilization. How they have succeeded or failed in this we need not here\r\nconsider. But when Germans demand a \"place in the sun,\" the considerable\r\nplace they have in fact acquired, with the acquiescence of the other\r\ncolonial Powers, should, in fairness to those Powers, be remembered.\r\nBut, notoriously, they were not satisfied, and the extent of their\r\ndissatisfaction was shown by their determination to create a navy. This\r\nnew departure, dating from the close of the decade 1890-1900, marks the\r\nbeginning of that friction between Great Britain and Germany which was a\r\nmain cause of the war. It is therefore important to form some just idea\r\nof the motives that inspired German policy to take this momentous step.\r\nThe reasons given by Prince Bülow, the founder of the policy, and often\r\nrepeated by German statesmen and publicists,[2] are, first, the need of a\r\nstrong navy, to protect German commerce; secondly, the need, as well as the\r\nambition, of Germany to play a part proportional to her real strength in\r\nthe determination of policy beyond the seas. These reasons, according to\r\nthe ideas that govern European statesmanship, are valid and sufficient.\r\nThey are the same that have influenced all great Powers; and if Germany\r\nwas influenced by them we need not infer any specially sinister intentions\r\non her part. The fact that during the present war German trade has been\r\nswept from the seas, and that she is in the position of a blockaded Power,\r\nwill certainly convince any German patriot, not that she did not need a\r\nnavy, but that she needed a much stronger one; and the retort that there\r\nneed have been no war if Germany had not provoked it by building a fleet\r\nis not one that can be expected to appeal to any nation so long as the\r\nEuropean anarchy endures. For, of course, every nation regards itself\r\nas menaced perpetually by aggression from some other Power. Defence was\r\ncertainly a legitimate motive for the building of the fleet, even if\r\nthere had been no other. There was, however, in fact, another reason\r\navowed. Germany, as we have said, desired to have a voice in policy\r\nbeyond the seas. Here, too, the reason is good, as reasons go in a\r\nworld of competing States. A great manufacturing and trading Power\r\ncannot be indifferent to the parcelling out of the world among its\r\nrivals. Wherever, in countries economically undeveloped, there were\r\nprojects of protectorates or annexations, or of any kind of monopoly\r\nto be established in the interest of any Power, there German interests\r\nwere directly affected. She had to speak, and to speak with a loud voice,\r\nif she was to be attended to. And a loud voice meant a navy. So, at least,\r\nthe matter naturally presented itself to German imperialists, as, indeed,\r\nit would to imperialists of any other country.\r\n\r\nThe reasons given by German statesmen for building their fleet were in\r\nthis sense valid. But were they the only reasons? In the beginning most\r\nprobably they were. But the formation and strengthening of the Entente,\r\nand Germany's consequent fear that war might be made upon her jointly by\r\nFrance and Great Britain, gave a new stimulus to her naval ambition. She\r\ncould not now be content with a navy only as big as that of France, for she\r\nmight have to meet those of France and England conjoined. This defensive\r\nreason is good. But no doubt, as always, there must have lurked behind it\r\nideas of aggression. Ambition, in the philosophy of States, goes hand in\r\nhand with fear. \"The war may come,\" says one party. \"Yes,\" says the other;\r\nand secretly mutters, \"May the war come!\" To ask whether armaments are for\r\noffence or for defence must always be an idle inquiry. They will be for\r\neither, or both, according to circumstances, according to the personalities\r\nthat are in power, according to the mood that politicians and journalists,\r\nand the interests that suborn them, have been able to infuse into a nation.\r\nBut what may be said with clear conviction is, that to attempt to account\r\nfor the clash of war by the ambition and armaments of a single Power is\r\nto think far too simply of how these catastrophes originate. The truth,\r\nin this case, is that German ambition developed in relation to the whole\r\nEuropean situation, and that, just as on land their policy was conditioned\r\nby their relation to France and Russia, so at sea it was conditioned by\r\ntheir relation to Great Britain. They knew that their determination to\r\nbecome a great Power at sea would arouse the suspicion and alarm of the\r\nEnglish. Prince Bülow is perfectly frank about that. He says that the\r\ndifficulty was to get on with the shipbuilding programme without giving\r\nGreat Britain an opportunity to intervene by force and nip the enterprise\r\nin the bud. He attributes here to the British Government a policy which\r\nis all in the Bismarckian tradition. It was, in fact, a policy urged by\r\nsome voices here, voices which, as is always the case, were carried to\r\nGermany and magnified by the mega-phone of the Press.[3] That no British\r\nGovernment, in fact, contemplated picking a quarrel with Germany in order\r\nto prevent her becoming a naval Power I am myself as much convinced as any\r\nother Englishman, and I count the fact as righteousness to our statesmen.\r\nOn the other hand, I think it an unfounded conjecture that Prince Bülow was\r\ndeliberately building with a view to attacking the British Empire. I see\r\nno reason to doubt his sincerity when he says that he looked forward to a\r\npeaceful solution of the rivalry between Germany and ourselves, and that\r\nFrance, in his view, not Great Britain, was the irreconcilable enemy.[4]\r\nIn building her navy, no doubt, Germany deliberately took the risk of\r\nincurring a quarrel with England in the pursuit of a policy which she\r\nregarded as essential to her development. It is quite another thing,\r\nand would require much evidence to prove that she was working up to a\r\nwar with the object of destroying the British Empire.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to bear in mind, in estimating the meaning of the German\r\nnaval policy, is a complex series of motives and conditions: the genuine\r\nneed of a navy, and a strong one, to protect trade in the event of war,\r\nand to secure a voice in overseas policy; the genuine fear of an attack by\r\nthe Powers of the Entente, an attack to be provoked by British jealousy;\r\nand also that indeterminate ambition of any great Power which may be\r\ninfluencing the policy of statesmen even while they have not avowed it to\r\nthemselves, and which, expressed by men less responsible and less discreet,\r\nbecomes part of that \"public opinion\" of which policy takes account.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Published in 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See, e.g., Dawson, \"Evolution of Modern Germany,\" p. 348.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Some of these are cited in Bülow's \"Imperial Germany,\" p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See \"Imperial Germany,\" pp. 48, 71, English translation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Vain Attempts at Harmony_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be reasonably urged that unless the Germans had had\r\naggressive ambitions they would have agreed to some of the many proposals\r\nmade by Great Britain to arrest on both sides the constantly expanding\r\nprogrammes of naval constructions. It is true that Germany has always\r\nopposed the policy of limiting armaments, whether on land or sea. This is\r\nconsonant with that whole militarist view of international politics which,\r\nas I have already indicated, is held in a more extreme and violent form\r\nin Germany than in any other country, but which is the creed of jingoes\r\nand imperialists everywhere. If the British Government had succeeded in\r\ncoming to an agreement with Germany on this question, they would have been\r\nbitterly assailed by that party at home. Still, the Government did make the\r\nattempt. It was comparatively easy for them, for any basis to which they\r\ncould have agreed must have left intact, legitimately and necessarily, as\r\nwe all agree, the British supremacy at sea. The Germans would not assent\r\nto this. They did not choose to limit beforehand their efforts to rival\r\nus at sea. Probably they did not think it possible to equal, still less\r\nto outstrip us. But they wanted to do all they could. And that of course\r\ncould have only one meaning. They thought a war with England possible,\r\nand they wanted to be as well prepared as they could be. It is part of\r\nthe irony that attaches to the whole system of the armed peace that the\r\npreparations made against war are themselves the principal cause of war.\r\nFor if there had been no rival shipbuilding, there need have been no\r\nfriction between the two countries.\r\n\r\n\"But why did Germany fear war? It must have been because she meant to make\r\nit.\" So the English argue. But imagine the Germans saying to us, \"Why do\r\nyou fear war? There will be no war unless you provoke it. We are quite\r\npacific. You need not be alarmed about us.\" Would such a promise have\r\ninduced us to relax our preparations for a moment? No! Under the armed\r\npeace there can be no confidence. And that alone is sufficient to account\r\nfor the breakdown of the Anglo-German negotiations, without supposing on\r\neither side a wish or an intention to make war. Each suspected, and was\r\nbound to suspect, the purpose of the other. Let us take, for example, the\r\nnegotiations of 1912, and put them back in their setting.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Alliance was confronting the Triple Entente. On both sides\r\nwere fear and suspicion. Each believed in the possibility of the others\r\nspringing a war upon them. Each suspected the others of wanting to lull\r\nthem into a false security, and then take them unprepared. In that\r\natmosphere, what hope was there of successful negotiations? The essential\r\ncondition--mutual confidence--was lacking. What, accordingly, do we find?\r\nThe Germans offer to reduce their naval programme, first, if England will\r\npromise an unconditional neutrality; secondly, when that was rejected, if\r\nEngland will promise neutrality in a war which should be \"forced upon\"\r\nGermany. Thereupon the British Foreign Office scents a snare. Germany\r\nwill get Austria to provoke a war, while making it appear that the war\r\nwas provoked by Russia, and she will then come in under the terms of her\r\nalliance with Austria, smash France, and claim that England must look\r\non passively under the neutrality agreement! \"No, thank you!\" Sir Edward\r\nGrey, accordingly, makes a counter-proposal. England will neither make\r\nnor participate in an \"unprovoked\" attack upon Germany. This time it is\r\nthe German Chancellor's turn to hang back. \"Unprovoked! Hm! What does\r\nthat mean? Russia, let us suppose, makes war upon Austria, while making\r\nit appear that Austria is the aggressor. France comes in on the side of\r\nRussia. And England? Will she admit that the war was 'unprovoked' and\r\nremain neutral? Hardly, we think!\" The Chancellor thereupon proposes the\r\naddition: \"England, of course, will remain neutral if war is forced upon\r\nGermany? That follows, I presume?\" \"No!\" from the British Foreign Office.\r\nReason as before. And the negotiations fall through. How should they not\r\nunder the conditions? There could be no understanding, because there was\r\nno confidence. There could be no confidence because there was mutual fear.\r\nThere was mutual fear because the Triple Alliance stood in arms against\r\nthe Triple Entente. What was wrong? Germany? England? No. The European\r\ntradition and system.\r\n\r\nThe fact, then, that those negotiations broke down is no more evidence\r\nof sinister intentions on the part of Germany than it is on the part of\r\nGreat Britain. Baron Beyens, to my mind the most competent and the most\r\nimpartial, as well as one of the best-informed, of those who have written\r\non the events leading up to the war, says explicitly of the policy of the\r\nGerman Chancellor:--\r\n\r\n  A practicable _rapprochement_ between his country and Great Britain\r\n  was the dream with which M. de Bethmann-Hollweg most willingly soothed\r\n  himself, without the treacherous _arrière-pensèe_ which the Prince von\r\n  Bülow perhaps would have had of finishing later on, at an opportune\r\n  moment, with the British Navy. Nothing authorizes us to believe that\r\n  there was not a basis of sincerity in the language of M. de Jagow when he\r\n  expressed to Sir E. Goschen in the course of their last painful interview\r\n  his poignant regret at the crumbling of his entire policy and that of the\r\n  Chancellor, which had been to make friends with Great Britain, and then\r\n  through Great Britain to get closer to France.[1]\r\n\r\nMeantime the considerations I have here laid before the reader, in relation\r\nto this general question of Anglo-German rivalry, are, I submit, all\r\nrelevant, and must be taken into fair consideration in forming a judgment.\r\nThe facts show clearly that Germany was challenging as well as she could\r\nthe British supremacy at sea; that she was determined to become a naval\r\nas well as a military Power; and that her policy was, on the face of it,\r\na menace to this country; just as the creation on our part of a great\r\nconscript army would have been taken by Germany as a menace to her. The\r\nBritish Government was bound to make counter-preparations. I, for my own\r\npart, have never disputed it. I have never thought, and do not now think,\r\nthat while the European anarchy continues, a single Power can disarm in the\r\nface of the others. All this is beyond dispute. What is disputable, and a\r\nmatter of speculative inference, is the further assumption that in pursuing\r\nthis policy Germany was making a bid to destroy the British Empire. The\r\nfacts can certainly be accounted for without that assumption. I myself\r\nthink the assumption highly improbable. So much I may say, but I cannot\r\nsay more. Possibly some day we may be able to check conjecture by facts.\r\nUntil then, argument must be inconclusive.\r\n\r\nThis question of the naval rivalry between Germany and Great Britain\r\nis, however, part of the general question of militarism. And it may be\r\nurged that while during the last fifteen years the British Government has\r\nshown itself favourable to projects of arbitration and of limitation of\r\narmaments, the German Government has consistently opposed them. There is\r\nmuch truth in this; and it is a good illustration of what I hold to be\r\nindisputable, that the militaristic view of international politics is\r\nmuch more deeply rooted in Germany than in Great Britain. It is worth\r\nwhile, however, to remind ourselves a little in detail what the facts\r\nwere since they are often misrepresented or exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe question of international arbitration was brought forward at the first\r\nHague Conference in 1899.[2] From the beginning it was recognized on all\r\nsides that it would be idle to propose general compulsory arbitration for\r\nall subjects. No Power would have agreed to it, not Great Britain or\r\nAmerica any more than Germany. On the other hand, projects for creating\r\nan arbitration tribunal, to which nations willing to use it should have\r\nrecourse, were brought forward by both the British and the American\r\nrepresentatives. From the beginning, however, it became clear that Count\r\nMünster, the head of the German delegation, was opposed to any scheme\r\nfor encouraging arbitration. \"He did not say that he would oppose a\r\nmoderate plan of voluntary arbitration, but he insisted that arbitration\r\nmust be injurious to Germany; that Germany is prepared for war as no\r\nother country is, or can be; that she can mobilize her army in ten\r\ndays; and that neither France, Russia, nor any other Power can do this.\r\nArbitration, he said, would simply give rival Powers time to put themselves\r\nin readiness, and would, therefore, be a great disadvantage to Germany.\"\r\nHere is what I should call the militarist view in all its simplicity and\r\npurity, the obstinate, unquestioning belief that war is inevitable, and\r\nthe determination to be ready for it at all costs, even at the cost of\r\nrejecting machinery which if adopted might obviate war. The passage has\r\noften been cited as evidence of the German determination to have war. But\r\nI have not so often seen quoted the exactly parallel declaration made by\r\nSir John (now Lord) Fisher. \"He said that the Navy of Great Britain was\r\nand would remain in a state of complete preparation for war; that a vast\r\ndeal depended on prompt action by the Navy; and that the truce afforded by\r\narbitration proceedings would give other Powers time, which they would not\r\notherwise have, to put themselves into complete readiness.\"[3] So far the\r\n\"militarist\" and the \"marinist\" adopt exactly the same view. And we may be\r\nsure that if proposals are made after the war to strengthen the machinery\r\nfor international arbitration, there will be opposition in this country of\r\nthe same kind, and based on the same grounds, as the opposition in Germany.\r\nWe cannot on this point condemn Count Münster without also condemning Lord\r\nFisher.\r\n\r\nMünster's opposition, however, was only the beginning. As the days went on\r\nit became clear that the Kaiser himself had become actively opposed to the\r\nwhole idea of arbitration, and was influencing Austria and Italy and Turkey\r\nin that sense. The delegates of all the other countries were in favour of\r\nthe very mild application of it which was under consideration. So, however,\r\nbe it noted, were all the delegates from Germany, except Count Münster.\r\nAnd even he was, by now, so far converted that when orders were received\r\nfrom Germany definitely to refuse co-operation, he postponed the critical\r\nsitting of the committee, and dispatched Professor Zorn to Berlin to lay\r\nthe whole matter before the Chancellor. Professor Zorn was accompanied\r\nby the American Dr. Holls, bearing an urgent private letter to Prince\r\nHohenlohe from Mr. White. The result was that the German attitude was\r\nchanged, and the arbitration tribunal was finally established with the\r\nconsent and co-operation of the German Government.\r\n\r\nI have thought it worth while to dwell thus fully upon this episode because\r\nit illustrates how misleading it really is to talk of \"Germany\" and the\r\n\"German\" attitude. There is every kind of German attitude. The Kaiser is\r\nan unstable and changeable character. His ministers do not necessarily\r\nagree with him, and he does not always get his way. As a consequence of\r\ndiscussion and persuasion the German opposition, on this occasion, was\r\novercome. There was nothing, in fact, fixed and final about it. It was\r\nthe militarist prejudice, and the prejudice this time yielded to humanity\r\nand reason.\r\n\r\nThe subject was taken up again in the Conference of 1907, and once more\r\nGermany was in opposition. The German delegate, Baron Marschall von\r\nBieberstein, while he was not against compulsory arbitration for certain\r\nselected topics, was opposed to any general treaty. It seems clear that it\r\nwas this attitude of Germany that prevented any advance being made beyond\r\nthe Convention of 1899. Good reasons, of course, could be given for this\r\nattitude; but they are the kind of reasons that goodwill could have\r\nsurmounted. It seems clear that there was goodwill in other Governments,\r\nbut not in that of Germany, and the latter lies legitimately under the\r\nprejudice resulting from the position she then took. German critics have\r\nrecognized this as freely as critics of other countries. I myself feel no\r\ndesire to minimize the blame that attaches to Germany. But Englishmen who\r\ncriticize her policy must always ask themselves whether they would support\r\na British Government that should stand for a general treaty of compulsory\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nOn the question of limitation of armaments the German Government has\r\nbeen equally intransigeant. At the Conference of 1899, indeed, no serious\r\neffort was made by any Power to achieve the avowed purpose of the meeting.\r\nAnd, clearly, if anything was intended to be done, the wrong direction\r\nwas taken from the beginning. When the second Conference was to meet it\r\nis understood that the German Government refused participation if the\r\nquestion of armaments was to be discussed, and the subject did not appear\r\non the official programme. Nevertheless the British, French, and American\r\ndelegates took occasion to express a strong sense of the burden of\r\narmaments, and the urgent need of lessening it.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Hague Conferences do, then, clearly show that the German\r\nGovernment was more obstinately sceptical of any advance in the direction\r\nof international arbitration or disarmament than that of any other Great\r\nPower, and especially of Great Britain or the United States. Whether, in\r\nfact, much could or would have been done, even in the absence of German\r\nopposition, may be doubted. There would certainly have been, in every\r\ncountry, very strong opposition to any effective measures, and it is only\r\nthose who would be willing to see their own Government make a radical\r\nadvance in the directions in question who can honestly attack the German\r\nGovernment. As one of those who believe that peaceable procedure may and\r\ncan, and, if civilization is to be preserved, must be substituted for war,\r\nI have a right to express my own condemnation of the German Government,\r\nand I unhesitatingly do so. But I do not infer that therefore Germany was\r\nall the time working up to an aggressive war. It is interesting, in this\r\nconnection, to note the testimony given by Sir Edwin Pears to the desire\r\nfor good relations between Great Britain and Germany felt and expressed\r\nlater by the same Baron Marschall von Bieberstein who was so unyielding\r\nin 1907 on the question of arbitration. When he came to take up the post\r\nof German Ambassador to Great Britain, Sir Edwin reports him as saying:--\r\n\r\n  I have long wanted to be Ambassador to England, because, as you know,\r\n  for years I have considered it a misfortune to the world that our two\r\n  countries are not really in harmony. I consider that I am here as a man\r\n  with a mission, my mission being to bring about a real understanding\r\n  between our two nations.\r\n\r\nOn this Sir Edwin comments (1915):--\r\n\r\n  I unhesitatingly add that I am convinced he was sincere in what he said.\r\n  Of that I have no doubt.[4]\r\n\r\nIt must, in fact, be recognized that in the present state of international\r\nrelations, the general suspicion and the imminent danger, it requires more\r\nimagination and faith than most public men possess, and more idealism than\r\nmost nations have shown themselves to be capable of, to take any radical\r\nstep towards reorganization. The armed peace, as we have so often had to\r\ninsist, perpetuates itself by the mistrust which it establishes.\r\n\r\nEvery move by one Power is taken to be a menace to another, and is\r\ncountered by a similar move, which in turn produces a reply. And it is\r\nnot easy to say \"Who began it?\" since the rivalry goes so far back into\r\nthe past. What, for instance, is the real truth about the German, French,\r\nand Russian military laws of 1913? Were any or all of them aggressive? Or\r\nwere they all defensive? I do not believe it is possible to answer that\r\nquestion. Looking back from the point of view of 1914, it is natural to\r\nsuppose that Germany was already intending war. But that did not seem\r\nevident at the time to a neutral observer, nor even, it would seem, to\r\nthe British Foreign Office. Thus the Count de Lalaing, Belgian Minister\r\nin London, writes as follows on February 24, 1913:--\r\n\r\n  The English Press naturally wants to throw upon Germany the\r\n  responsibility for the new tension which results from its proposals,\r\n  and which may bring to Europe fresh occasions of unrest. Many journals\r\n  consider that the French Government, in declaring itself ready to impose\r\n  three years' service, and in nominating M. Delcassé to St. Petersburg,\r\n  has adopted the only attitude worthy of the great Republic in presence\r\n  of a German provocation. At the Foreign Office I found a more just and\r\n  calm appreciation of the position. They see in the reinforcement of\r\n  the German armies less a provocation than the admission of a military\r\n  situation weakened by events and which it is necessary to strengthen.\r\n  The Government of Berlin sees itself obliged to recognize that it cannot\r\n  count, as before, on the support of all the forces of its Austrian ally,\r\n  since the appearance in South-east Europe of a new Power, that of the\r\n  Balkan allies, established on the very flank of the Dual Empire. Far\r\n  from being able to count, in case of need, on the full support of the\r\n  Government of Vienna, it is probable that Germany will have to support\r\n  Vienna herself. In the case of a European war she would have to make\r\n  head against her enemies on two frontiers, the Russian and the French,\r\n  and diminish perhaps her own forces to aid the Austrian army. In these\r\n  conditions they do not find it surprising that the German Empire should\r\n  have felt it necessary to increase the number of its Army Corps. They add\r\n  at the Foreign Office that the Government of Berlin had frankly explained\r\n  to the Cabinet of Paris the precise motives of its action.\r\n\r\nWhether this is a complete account of the motives of the German Government\r\nin introducing the law of 1913 cannot be definitely established. But the\r\nmotives suggested are adequate by themselves to account for the facts.\r\nOn the other hand, a part of the cost of the new law was to be defrayed\r\nby a tax on capital. And those who believe that by this year Germany was\r\ndefinitely waiting an occasion to make war have a right to dwell upon that\r\nfact. I find, myself, nothing conclusive in these speculations. But what\r\nis certain, and to my mind much more important, is the fact that military\r\npreparations evoke counter-preparations, until at last the strain becomes\r\nunbearable. By 1913 it was already terrific. The Germans knew well that\r\nby January 1917 the French and Russian preparations would have reached\r\ntheir culminating point. But those preparations were themselves almost\r\nunendurable to the French.\r\n\r\nI may recall here the passage already cited from a dispatch of Baron\r\nGuillaume, Belgian Ambassador at Paris, written in June 1914 (p. 34).\r\nHe suspected, as we saw, that the hand of Russia had imposed the three\r\nyears' service upon France.\r\n\r\nWhat Baron Guillaume thought plausible must not the Germans have thought\r\nplausible? Must it not have confirmed their belief in the \"inevitability\"\r\nof a war--that belief which, by itself, has been enough to produce war\r\nafter war, and, in particular, the war of 1870? Must there not have been\r\nstrengthened in their minds that particular current among the many that\r\nwere making for war? And must not similar suspicions have been active,\r\nwith similar results, on the side of France and Russia? The armaments\r\nengender fear, the fear in turn engenders armaments, and in that vicious\r\ncircle turns the policy of Europe, till this or that Power precipitates the\r\nconflict, much as a man hanging in terror over the edge of a cliff ends by\r\nlosing his nerve and throwing himself over. That is the real lesson of the\r\nrivalry in armaments. That is certain. The rest remains conjecture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 75, and British White Paper,\r\nNo. 160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The account that follows is taken from the \"Autobiography\" of\r\nAndrew D.

I take that\r\ndate, the date of Bismarck's resignation, for the reason already given (p.\r\n42). It was not until then that it would have occurred to any competent\r\nobserver to accuse Germany of an aggressive policy calculated to disturb\r\nthe peace of Europe. A closer _rapprochement_ with England was, indeed,\r\nthe first idea of the Kaiser when he took over the reins of power in 1888.\r\nAnd during the ten years that followed British sympathies were actually\r\ndrawn towards Germany and alienated from France.[1] It is well known that\r\nMr. Chamberlain favoured an alliance with Germany,[2] and that when the\r\nAnglo-Japanese treaty was being negotiated the inclusion of Germany was\r\nseriously considered by Lord Lansdowne. The telegram of the Kaiser to\r\nKruger in 1895 no doubt left an unpleasant impression in England, and\r\nGerman feeling, of course, at the time of the Boer War, ran strongly\r\nagainst England, but so did feeling in France and America, and, indeed,\r\nthroughout the civilized world. It was certainly the determination\r\nof Germany to build a great navy that led to the tension between her\r\nand England, and finally to the formation of the Triple Entente, as\r\na counterpoise to the Triple Alliance. It is 1900, not 1888, still\r\nless 1870, that marks the period at which German policy began to be\r\na disturbing element in Europe. During the years that followed, the\r\nprincipal storm-centres in international policy were the Far and Near\r\nEast, the Balkans, and Morocco. Events in the Far East, important though\r\nthey were, need not detain us here, for their contribution to the present\r\nwar was remote and indirect, except so far as concerns the participation of\r\nJapan. Of the situation in the other areas, the tension and its causes and\r\neffects, we must try to form some clear general idea. This can be done even\r\nin the absence of that detailed information of what was going on behind the\r\nscenes for which a historian will have to wait.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The columns of _The Times_ for 1899 are full of attacks upon\r\nFrance. Once more we may cite from the dispatch of the Comte de Lalaing,\r\nBelgian Minister in London, dated May 24, 1907, commenting on current\r\nor recalling earlier events: \"A certain section of the Press, known here\r\nunder the name of the Yellow Press, is in great part responsible for the\r\nhostility that exists between the two nations (England and Germany). What,\r\nin fact, can one expect from a journalist like Mr. Harmsworth, now Lord\r\nNorthcliffe, proprietor of the _Daily Mail_, _Daily Mirror_, _Daily\r\nGraphic_, _Daily Express_, _Evening News_, and _Weekly Dispatch_, who\r\nin an interview given to the _Matin_ says, 'Yes, we detest the Germans\r\ncordially. They make themselves odious to all Europe. I will never allow\r\nthe least thing to be printed in my journal which might wound France,\r\nbut I would not let anything be printed which might be agreeable to\r\nGermany.' Yet, in 1899, this same man was attacking the French with the\r\nsame violence, wanted to boycott the Paris Exhibition, and wrote: 'The\r\nFrench have succeeded in persuading John Bull that they are his deadly\r\nenemies. England long hesitated between France and Germany, but she has\r\nalways respected the German character, while she has come to despise\r\nFrance. A cordial understanding cannot exist between England and her\r\nnearest neighbour. We have had enough of France, who has neither courage\r\nnor political sense.'\" Lalaing does not give his references, and I\r\ncannot therefore verify his quotations. But they hardly require it.\r\nThe _volte-face_ of _The Times_ sufficiently well known. And only too\r\nwell known is the way in which the British nation allows its sentiments\r\nfor other nations to be dictated to it by a handful of cantankerous\r\njournalists.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"I may point out to you that, at bottom, the character, the\r\nmain character, of the Teuton race differs very slightly indeed from the\r\ncharacter of the Anglo-Saxon (_cheers_), and the same sentiments which\r\nbring us into a close sympathy with the United States of America may be\r\ninvoked to bring us into closer sympathy with the Empire of Germany.\" He\r\ngoes on to advocate \"a new Triple Alliance between the Teutonic race and\r\nthe two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race\" (see _The Times_, December\r\n1, 1899). This was at the beginning of the Boer war. Two years later, in\r\nOctober, 1901, Mr. Chamberlain was attacking Germany at Edinburgh. This\r\ndate is clearly about the turning-point in British sentiment and policy\r\ntowards Germany.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Germany, and Turkey_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the Near East. The situation there, when Germany began\r\nher enterprise, is thus summed up by a French writer[1]:--\r\n\r\n  Astride across Europe and Asia, the Ottoman Empire represented, for\r\n  all the nations of the old continent, the cosmopolitan centre where\r\n  each had erected, by dint of patience and ingenuity, a fortress of\r\n  interests, influences, and special rights. Each fortress watched\r\n  jealously to maintain its particular advantages in face of the rival\r\n  enemy. If one of them obtained a concession, or a new favour, immediately\r\n  the commanders of the others were seen issuing from their walls to claim\r\n  from the Grand Turk concessions or favours which should maintain the\r\n  existing balance of power or prestige.... France acted as protector of\r\n  the Christians; England, the vigilant guardian of the routes to India,\r\n  maintained a privileged political and economic position; Austria-Hungary\r\n  mounted guard over the route to Salonica; Russia, protecting the\r\n  Armenians and Slavs of the South of Europe, watched over the fate of\r\n  the Orthodox. There was a general understanding among them all, tacit\r\n  or express, that none should better its situation at the expense of\r\n  the others.\r\n\r\nWhen into this precariously balanced system of conflicting interests\r\nGermany began to throw her weight, the necessary result was a disturbance\r\nof equilibrium. As early as 1839 German ambition had been directed towards\r\nthis region by Von Moltke; but it was not till 1873 that the process of\r\n\"penetration\" began. In that year the enterprise of the Anatolian railway\r\nwas launched by German financiers. In the succeeding years it extended\r\nitself as far as Konia; and in 1899 and 1902 concessions were obtained\r\nfor an extension to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. It was at this point that\r\nthe question became one of international politics. Nothing could better\r\nillustrate the lamentable character of the European anarchy than the\r\ntreatment of this matter by the interests and the Powers affected. Here\r\nhad been launched on a grandiose scale a great enterprise of civilization.\r\nThe Mesopotamian plain, the cradle of civilization, and for centuries\r\nthe granary of the world, was to be redeemed by irrigation from the\r\nencroachment of the desert, order and security were to be restored,\r\nlabour to be set at work, and science and power to be devoted on a\r\ngreat scale to their only proper purpose, the increase of life. Here\r\nwas an idea fit to inspire the most generous imagination. Here, for all\r\nthe idealism of youth and the ambition of maturity, for diplomatists,\r\nengineers, administrators, agriculturists, educationists, an opportunity\r\nfor the work of a lifetime, a task to appeal at once to the imagination,\r\nthe intellect, and the organizing capacity of practical men, a scheme in\r\nwhich all nations might be proud to participate, and by which Europe might\r\nshow to the backward populations that the power she had won over Nature\r\nwas to be used for the benefit of man, and that the science and the arms\r\nof the West were destined to recreate the life of the East. What happened,\r\nin fact? No sooner did the Germans approach the other nations for financial\r\nand political support to their scheme than there was an outcry of jealousy,\r\nsuspicion, and rage. All the vested interests of the other States were\r\nup in arms. The proposed railway, it was said, would compete with the\r\nTrans-Siberian, with the French railways, with the ocean route to India,\r\nwith the steamboats on the Tigris. Corn in Mesopotamia would bring down\r\nthe price of corn in Russia. German trade would oust British and French\r\nand Russian trade. Nor was that all. Under cover of an economic enterprise,\r\nGermany was nursing political ambitions. She was aiming at Egypt and the\r\nSuez Canal, at the control of the Persian Gulf, at the domination of\r\nPersia, at the route to India. Were these fears and suspicions justified?\r\nIn the European anarchy, who can say? Certainly the entry of a new economic\r\ncompetitor, the exploitation of new areas, the opening out of new trade\r\nroutes, must interfere with interests already established. That must always\r\nbe so in a changing world. But no one would seriously maintain that that is\r\na reason for abandoning new enterprises. But, it was urged, in fact Germany\r\nwill take the opportunity to squeeze out the trade of other nations and\r\nto constitute a German monopoly. Germany, it is true, was ready to give\r\nguarantees of the \"open door.\" But then, what was the value of these\r\nguarantees? She asserted that her enterprise was economic, and had no\r\nulterior political gains. But who would believe her? Were not German\r\nJingoes already rejoicing at the near approach of German armies to the\r\nEgyptian frontiers? In the European anarchy all these fears, suspicions,\r\nand rivalries were inevitable. But the British Government at least was\r\nnot carried away by them. They were willing that British capital should\r\nco-operate on condition that the enterprise should be under international\r\ncontrol. They negotiated for terms which would give equal control to\r\nGermany, England, and France. They failed to get these terms, why has not\r\nbeen made public. But Lord Cranborne, then Under-Secretary of State, said\r\nin the House of Commons that \"the outcry which was made in this matter--I\r\nthink it a very ill-informed outcry--made it exceedingly difficult for us\r\nto get the terms we required.\"[2] And Sir Clinton Dawkins wrote in a letter\r\nto Herr Gwinner, the chief of the Deutsche Bank: \"The fact is that the\r\nbusiness has become involved in politics here, and has been sacrificed\r\nto the very violent and bitter feeling against Germany exhibited by the\r\nmajority of newspapers and shared in by a large number of people.\"[3]\r\nBritish co-operation, therefore, failed, as French and Russian had failed.\r\nThe Germans, however, persevered with their enterprise, now a purely\r\nGerman one, and ultimately with success. Their differences with Russia\r\nwere arranged by an agreement about the Turko-Persian railways signed in\r\n1911. An agreement with France, with regard to the railways of Asiatic\r\nTurkey, was signed in February 1914, and one with England (securing our\r\ninterests on the Persian Gulf) in June of the same year. Thus just before\r\nthe war broke out this thorny question had, in fact, been settled to the\r\nsatisfaction of all the Powers concerned. And on this two comments may be\r\nmade. First, that the long friction, the press campaign, the rivalry of\r\neconomic and political interests, had contributed largely to the European\r\ntension. Secondly, that in spite of that, the question did get settled,\r\nand by diplomatic means. On this subject, at any rate, war was not\r\n\"inevitable.\" Further, it seems clear that the British Government,\r\nso far from \"hemming-in\" Germany in this matter, were ready from the\r\nfirst to accept, if not to welcome, her enterprise, subject to their\r\nquite legitimate and necessary preoccupation with their position on\r\nthe Persian Gulf. It was the British Press and what lay behind it that\r\nprevented the co-operation of British capital. Meantime the economic\r\npenetration of Asia Minor by Germany had been accompanied by a political\r\npenetration at Constantinople. Already, as early as 1898, the Kaiser had\r\nannounced at Damascus that the \"three hundred millions of Mussulmans who\r\nlive scattered over the globe may be assured that the German Emperor will\r\nbe at all times their friend.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, made immediately after the Armenian massacres, has been very\r\nproperly reprobated by all who are revolted at such atrocities. But the\r\nindignation of Englishmen must be tempered by shame when they remember\r\nthat it was their own minister, still the idol of half the nation, who\r\nreinstated Turkey after the earlier massacres in Bulgaria and put back\r\nthe inhabitants of Macedonia for another generation under the murderous\r\noppression of the Turks. The importance of the speech in the history of\r\nEurope is that it signalled the advent of German influence in the Near\r\nEast. That influence was strengthened on the Bosphorus after the Turkish\r\nrevolution of 1908, in spite of the original Anglophil bias of the Young\r\nTurks, and as some critics maintain, in consequence of the blundering\r\nof the British representatives. The mission of Von der Goltz in 1908\r\nand that of Liman von Sanders in 1914 put the Turkish army under German\r\ncommand, and by the outbreak of the war German influence was predominant\r\nin Constantinople. This political influence was, no doubt, used, and\r\nintended to be used, to further German economic schemes. Germany, in\r\nfact, had come in to play the same game as the other Powers, and had\r\nplayed it with more skill and determination. She was, of course, here as\r\nelsewhere, a new and disturbing force in a system of forces which already\r\nhad difficulty in maintaining a precarious equilibrium. But to be a new and\r\ndisturbing force is not to commit a crime. Once more the real culprit was\r\nnot Germany nor any other Power. The real culprit was the European anarchy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierre Albin, \"D'Agadir à Serajevo,\" p. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hansard_, 1903, vol. 126, p. 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Nineteenth Century_, June 1909, vol. 65, p. 1090.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Austria and the Balkans_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI turn now to the Balkan question. This is too ancient and too complicated\r\nto be even summarized here. But we must remind ourselves of the main\r\nsituation. Primarily, the Balkan question is, or rather was, one between\r\nsubject Christian populations and the Turks. But it has been complicated,\r\nnot only by the quarrels of the subject populations among themselves, but\r\nby the rival ambitions and claims of Russia and Austria. The interest of\r\nRussia in the Balkans is partly one of racial sympathy, partly one of\r\nterritorial ambition, for the road to Constantinople lies through Rumania\r\nand Bulgaria. It is this territorial ambition of Russia that has given\r\noccasion in the past to the intervention of the Western Powers, for until\r\nrecently it was a fixed principle, both of French and British policy, to\r\nkeep Russia out of the Mediterranean. Hence the Crimean War, and hence\r\nthe disastrous intervention of Disraeli after the treaty of San Stefano\r\nin 1878--an intervention which perpetuated for years the Balkan hell.\r\nThe interest of Austria in the peninsula depends primarily on the fact\r\nthat the Austrian Empire contains a large Slav population desiring its\r\nindependence, and that this national ambition of the Austrian Slavs finds\r\nin the independent kingdom of Serbia its natural centre of attraction. The\r\ndetermination of Austria to retain her Slavs as unwilling citizens of her\r\nEmpire brings her also into conflict with Russia, so far as Russia is the\r\nprotector of the Slavs. The situation, and the danger with which it is\r\npregnant, may be realized by an Englishman if he will suppose St. George's\r\nChannel and the Atlantic to be annihilated, and Ireland to touch, by a land\r\nfrontier, on the one side Great Britain, on the other the United States.\r\nThe friction and even the warfare which might have arisen between these two\r\ngreat Powers from the plots of American Fenians may readily be imagined.\r\nSomething of that kind is the situation of Austria in relation to Serbia\r\nand her protector, Russia. Further, Austria fears the occupation by any\r\nSlav State of any port on the coast line of the Adriatic, and herself\r\ndesires a port on the Aegean. Add to this the recent German dream of the\r\nroute from Berlin to Bagdad, and the European importance of what would\r\notherwise be local disputes among the Balkan States becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nDuring the period we are now considering the Balkan factor first came into\r\nprominence with the annexation by Austria of Bosnia and Herzegovina in\r\n1908. Those provinces, it will be remembered, were handed over to Austrian\r\nprotection at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Austria went in and policed\r\nthe country, much as England went in and policed Egypt, and, from the\r\nmaterial point of view, with similarly successful results. But, like\r\nEngland in Egypt, Austria was not sovereign there. Formal sovereignty\r\nstill rested with the Turk. In 1909, during the Turkish revolution,\r\nAustria took the opportunity to throw off that nominal suzerainty.\r\nRussia protested, Austria mobilized against Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nand war seemed imminent. But the dramatic intervention of Germany \"in\r\nshining armour\" on the side of her ally resulted in a diplomatic victory\r\nfor the Central Powers. Austria gained her point, and war, for the moment,\r\nwas avoided. But such diplomatic victories are dangerous. Russia did not\r\nforget, and the events of 1909 were an operative cause in the catastrophe\r\nof 1914. In acting as she did in this matter Austria-Hungary defied the\r\npublic law of Europe, and Germany supported her in doing so.\r\n\r\nThe motives of Germany in taking this action are thus described, and\r\nprobably with truth, by Baron Beyens: \"She could not allow the solidity\r\nof the Triple Alliance to be shaken: she had a debt of gratitude to pay\r\nto her ally, who had supported her at the Congress of Algeciras. Finally,\r\nshe believed herself to be the object of an attempt at encirclement by\r\nFrance, England, and Russia, and was anxious to show that the gesture of\r\nputting her hand to the sword was enough to dispel the illusions of her\r\nadversaries.\"[1] These are the kind of reasons that all Powers consider\r\nadequate where what they conceive to be their interests are involved. From\r\nany higher, more international point of view, they are no reasons at all.\r\nBut in such a matter no Power is in a position to throw the first stone.\r\nThe whole episode is a classical example for the normal working of the\r\nEuropean anarchy. Austria-Hungary was primarily to blame, but Germany, who\r\nsupported her, must take her share. The other Powers of Europe acquiesced\r\nfor the sake of peace, and they could probably do no better. There will\r\nnever be any guarantee for the public law of Europe until there is a public\r\ntribunal and a public force to see that its decisions are carried out.\r\n\r\nThe next events of importance in this region were the two Balkan wars.\r\nWe need not here go into the causes and results of these, except so far\r\nas to note that, once more, the rivalry of Russia and Austria played a\r\ndisastrous part. It was the determination of Austria not to give Serbia\r\naccess to the Adriatic that led Serbia to retain territories assigned by\r\ntreaty to Bulgaria, and so precipitated the second Balkan war; for that war\r\nwas due to the indignation caused in Bulgaria by the breach of faith, and\r\nis said to have been directly prompted by Austria. The bad part played by\r\nAustria throughout this crisis is indisputable. But it must be observed\r\nthat, by general admission, Germany throughout worked hand in hand with\r\nSir Edward Grey to keep the peace of Europe, which, indeed, otherwise\r\ncould not have been kept. And nothing illustrates this better than that\r\nepisode of 1913 which is sometimes taken to throw discredit upon Germany.\r\nThe episode was thus described by the Italian minister, Giolitti: \"On the\r\n9th of August, 1913, about a year before the war broke out, I, being then\r\nabsent from Rome, received from my colleague, San Giuliano, the following\r\ntelegram: 'Austria has communicated to us and to Germany her intention to\r\nact against Serbia, and defines such action as defensive, hoping to apply\r\nthe _casus foederis_ of the Triple Alliance, which I consider inapplicable.\r\nI intend to join forces with Germany to prevent any such action by Austria,\r\nbut it will be necessary to say clearly that we do not consider such\r\neventual action as defensive, and therefore do not believe that the\r\n_casus foederis_ exists. Please telegraph to Rome if you approve.'\r\n\r\n\"I replied that, 'if Austria intervenes against Serbia, it is evident that\r\nthe _casus foederis_ does not arise. It is an action that she undertakes on\r\nher own account, since there is no question of defence, as no one thinks\r\nof attacking her. It is necessary to make a declaration in this sense to\r\nAustria in the most formal way, and it is to be wished that German action\r\nmay dissuade Austria from her most perilous adventure.'\"[2]\r\n\r\nNow this statement shows upon the face of it two things. One, that Austria\r\nwas prepared, by attacking Serbia, to unchain a European war; the other,\r\nthat the Italian ministers joined with Germany to dissuade her. They were\r\nsuccessful. Austria abandoned her project, and war was avoided. The episode\r\nis as discreditable as you like to Austria. But, on the face of it, how\r\ndoes it discredit Germany? More, of course, may lie behind; but no evidence\r\nhas been produced, so far as I am aware, to show that the Austrian project\r\nwas approved or supported by her ally.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Bucharest, which concluded the second Balkan War, left\r\nall the parties concerned dissatisfied. But, in particular, it left the\r\nsituation between Austria and Serbia and between Austria and Russia more\r\nstrained than ever. It was this situation that was the proximate cause of\r\nthe present war. For, as we have seen, a quarrel between Austria and Russia\r\nover the Balkans must, given the system of alliances, unchain a European\r\nwar. For producing that situation Austria-Hungary was mainly responsible.\r\nThe part played by Germany was secondary, and throughout the Balkan wars\r\nGerman diplomacy was certainly working, with England, for peace. \"The\r\ndiplomacy of the Wilhelmstrasse,\" says Baron Beyens, \"applied itself,\r\nabove all, to calm the exasperation and the desire for intervention at\r\nthe Ballplatz.\" \"The Cabinet of Berlin did not follow that of Vienna in\r\nits tortuous policy of intrigues at Sofia and Bucharest. As M. Zimmermann\r\nsaid to me at the time, the Imperial Government contented itself with\r\nmaintaining its neutrality in relation to the Balkans, abstaining from\r\nany intervention, beyond advice, in the fury of their quarrels. There is\r\nno reason to doubt the sincerity of this statement.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is characteristic of the way history is written in time of\r\nwar that M. Yves Guyot, citing Giolitti's statement, omits the references\r\nto Germany. _See_ \"Les causes et les consequences de la guerre,\" p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" pp. 248, 262.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Morocco_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the other storm-centre, Morocco. The salient features\r\nhere were, first, the treaty of 1880, to which all the Great Powers,\r\nincluding, of course, Germany, were parties, and which guaranteed to\r\nthe signatories most-favoured-nation treatment; secondly, the interest of\r\nGreat Britain to prevent a strong Power from establishing itself opposite\r\nGibraltar and threatening British control over the Straits; thirdly, the\r\ninterest of France to annex Morocco and knit it up with the North African\r\nEmpire; fourthly, the new colonial and trading interests of Germany, which,\r\nas she had formally announced, could not leave her indifferent to any new\r\ndispositions of influence or territory in undeveloped countries. For many\r\nyears French ambitions in Morocco had been held in check by the British\r\ndesire to maintain the _status quo_. But the Anglo-French Entente of 1904\r\ngave France a free hand there in return for the abandonment of French\r\nopposition to the British position in Egypt. The Anglo-French treaty of\r\n1904 affirmed, in the clauses made public, the independence and integrity\r\nof Morocco; but there were secret clauses looking to its partition. By\r\nthese the British interest in the Straits was guaranteed by an arrangement\r\nwhich gave to Spain the reversion of the coast opposite Gibraltar and a\r\nstrip on the north-west coast, while leaving the rest of the country to\r\nfall to France. Germany was not consulted while these arrangements were\r\nbeing made, and the secret clauses of the treaty were, of course, not\r\ncommunicated to her. But it seems reasonable to suppose that they became\r\nknown to, or at least were suspected by, the German Government shortly\r\nafter they were adopted.[1] And probably it was this that led to the\r\ndramatic intervention of the Kaiser at Tangier,[2] when he announced\r\nthat the independence of Morocco was under German protection. The result\r\nwas the Conference of Algeciras, at which the independence and integrity of\r\nMorocco was once more affirmed (the clauses looking to its partition being\r\nstill kept secret by the three Powers privy to them), and equal commercial\r\nfacilities were guaranteed to all the Powers. Germany thereby obtained what\r\nshe most wanted, what she had a right to by the treaty of 1880, and what\r\notherwise might have been threatened by French occupation--the maintenance\r\nof the open door. But the French enterprise was not abandoned. Disputes\r\nwith the natives such as always occur, or are manufactured, in these cases,\r\nled to fresh military intervention. At the same time, it was difficult to\r\nsecure the practical application of the principle of equal commercial\r\nopportunity. An agreement of 1909 between France and Germany, whereby\r\nboth Powers were to share equally in contracts for public works, was\r\nfound in practice not to work. The Germans pressed for its application\r\nto the new railways projected in Morocco. The French delayed, temporized,\r\nand postponed decision.[3] Meantime they were strengthening their position\r\nin Morocco. The matter was brought to a head by the expedition to Fez.\r\nInitiated on the plea of danger to the European residents at the capital\r\n(a plea which was disputed by the Germans and by many Frenchmen), it\r\nclearly heralded a definite final occupation of the country. The patience\r\nof the Germans was exhausted, and the Kaiser made the coup of Agadir.\r\nThere followed the Mansion House speech of Mr. Lloyd George and the\r\nFranco-German agreement of November 1911, whereby Germany recognized a\r\nFrench protectorate in Morocco in return for concessions of territory\r\nin the French Congo. These are the bare facts of the Moroccan episode.\r\nMuch, of course, is still unrevealed, particularly as to the motives and\r\nintentions of the Powers concerned. Did Germany, for instance, intend to\r\nseize a share of Morocco when she sent the _Panther_ to Agadir? And was\r\nthat the reason of the vigour of the British intervention? Possibly, but\r\nby no means certainly; the evidence accessible is conflicting. If Germany\r\nhad that intention, she was frustrated by the solidarity shown between\r\nFrance and England, and the result was the final and definite absorption\r\nof Morocco in the French Empire, with the approval and active support of\r\nGreat Britain, Germany being compensated by the cession of part of the\r\nFrench Congo. Once more a difficult question had been settled by diplomacy,\r\nbut only after it had twice brought Europe to the verge of war, and in such\r\na way as to leave behind the bitterest feelings of anger and mistrust in\r\nall the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nThe facts thus briefly summarized here may be studied more at length,\r\nwith the relevant documents, in Mr. Morel's book \"Morocco in Diplomacy.\"\r\nThe reader will form his own opinion on the part played by the various\r\nPowers. But I do not believe that any instructed and impartial student\r\nwill accept what appears to be the current English view, that the action\r\nof Germany in this episode was a piece of sheer aggression without excuse,\r\nand that the other Powers were acting throughout justly, honestly, and\r\nstraightforwardly.\r\n\r\nThe Morocco crisis, as we have already seen, produced in Germany a painful\r\nimpression, and strengthened there the elements making for war. Thus Baron\r\nBeyens writes:--\r\n\r\n  The Moroccan conflicts made many Germans hitherto pacific regard another\r\n  war as a necessary evil.[4]\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n  The pacific settlement of the conflict of 1911 gave a violent impulse to\r\n  the war party in Germany, to the propaganda of the League of Defence and\r\n  the Navy League, and a greater force to their demands. To their dreams\r\n  of hegemony and domination the desire for revenge against France now\r\n  mingled its bitterness. A diplomatic success secured in an underground\r\n  struggle signified nothing. War, war in the open, that alone, in the eyes\r\n  of this rancorous tribe, could settle definitely the Moroccan question by\r\n  incorporating Morocco and all French Africa in the colonial empire they\r\n  hoped to create on the shores of the Mediterranean and in the heart of\r\n  the Black Continent.[5]\r\n\r\nThis we may take to be a correct description of the attitude of the\r\nPangermans. But there is no evidence that it was that of the nation.\r\nWe have seen also that Baron Beyens' impression of the attitude of the\r\nGerman people, even after the Moroccan affair, was of a general desire\r\nfor peace.[6] The crisis had been severe, but it had been tided over, and\r\nthe Governments seem to have made renewed efforts to come into friendly\r\nrelations. In this connection the following dispatch of Baron Beyens (June\r\n1912) is worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n  After the death of Edward VII, the Kaiser, as well as the Crown Prince,\r\n  when they returned from England, where they had been courteously\r\n  received, were persuaded that the coldness in the relations of the\r\n  preceding years was going to yield to a cordial intimacy between the\r\n  two Courts and that the causes of the misunderstanding between the two\r\n  peoples would vanish with the past. His disillusionment, therefore, was\r\n  cruel when he saw the Cabinet of London range itself last year on the\r\n  side of France. But the Kaiser is obstinate, and has not abandoned the\r\n  hope of reconquering the confidence of the English.[7]\r\n\r\nThis dispatch is so far borne out by the facts that in the year succeeding\r\nthe Moroccan crisis a serious attempt was made to improve Anglo-German\r\nrelations, and there is no reason to doubt that on both sides there was\r\na genuine desire for an understanding. How that understanding failed has\r\nalready been indicated.[8] But even that failure did not ruin the relations\r\nbetween the two Powers. In the Balkan crisis, as we have seen and as is\r\nadmitted on both sides, England and Germany worked together for peace. And\r\nthe fact that a European conflagration was then avoided, in spite of the\r\ntension between Russia and Austria, is a strong proof that the efforts of\r\nSir Edward Grey were sincerely and effectively seconded by Germany.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Morocco in Diplomacy,\" Chap. XVI. A dispatch written by\r\nM. Leghait, the Belgian minister in Paris, on May 7, 1905, shows that\r\nrumour was busy on the subject. The secret clauses of the Franco-Spanish\r\ntreaty were known to him, and these provided for an eventual partition of\r\nMorocco between France and Spain. He doubted whether there were secret\r\nclauses in the Anglo-French treaty--\"but it is supposed that there is a\r\ncertain tacit understanding by which England would leave France sufficient\r\nliberty of action in Morocco under the reserve of the secret clauses of the\r\nFranco-Spanish arrangement, clauses if not imposed yet at least strongly\r\nsupported by the London Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nWe know, of course, now, that the arrangement for the partition was\r\nactually embodied in secret clauses in the Anglo-French treaty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: According to M. Yves Guyot, when the Kaiser was actually on\r\nhis way to Tangier, he telegraphed from Lisbon to Prince Bülow abandoning\r\nthe project. Prince Bülow telegraphed back insisting, and the Kaiser\r\nyielded.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Bourdon, \"L'Enigme Allemande,\" Chap. II. This account, by\r\na Frenchman, will not be suspected of anti-French or pro-German bias, and\r\nit is based on French official records.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See above, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This view is reaffirmed by Baron Beyens in \"L'Allemagne avant\r\nla guerre,\" p. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See above, p. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Above, p. 111.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _The Last Years_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have reached, then, the year 1913, and the end of the Balkan wars,\r\nwithout discovering in German policy any clear signs of a determination\r\nto produce a European war. We have found all the Powers, Germany included,\r\ncontending for territory and trade at the risk of the peace of Europe; we\r\nhave found Germany successfully developing her interests in Turkey; we have\r\nfound England annexing the South African republics, France Morocco, Italy\r\nTripoli; we have found all the Powers stealing in China, and in all these\r\ntransactions we have found them continually on the point of being at one\r\nanother's throats. Nevertheless, some last instinct of self-preservation\r\nhas enabled them, so far, to pull up in time. The crises had been overcome\r\nwithout a war. Yet they had, of course, produced their effects. Some\r\nstatesmen probably, like Sir Edward Grey, had had their passion for\r\npeace confirmed by the dangers encountered. In others, no doubt, an\r\nopposite effect had been produced, and very likely by 1913 there were\r\nprominent men in Europe convinced that war must come, and manoeuvring\r\nonly that it should come at the time and occasion most favourable to\r\ntheir country. That, according to M. Cambon, was now the attitude of\r\nthe German Emperor. M. Cambon bases this view on an alleged conversation\r\nbetween the Kaiser and the King of the Belgians.[1] The conversation has\r\nbeen denied by the German official organ, but that, of course, is no\r\nproof that it did not take place, and there is nothing improbable in\r\nwhat M. Cambon narrates.\r\n\r\nThe conversation is supposed to have occurred in November 1913, at a\r\ntime when, as we have seen,[2] there was a distinct outburst in France\r\nof anti-German chauvinism, and when the arming and counter-arming of that\r\nyear had exasperated opinion to an extreme degree. The Kaiser is reported\r\nto have said that war between Germany and France was inevitable. If he did,\r\nit is clear from the context that he said it in the belief that French\r\nchauvinism would produce war. For the King of the Belgians, in replying,\r\nis stated to have said that it was \"a travesty, of the French Government\r\nto interpret it in that sense, and to let oneself be misled as to the\r\nsentiments of the French nation by the ebullitions of a few irresponsible\r\nspirits or the intrigues of unscrupulous agitators.\" It should be observed\r\nalso that this supposed attitude on the part of the Kaiser is noted as a\r\nchange, and that he is credited with having previously stood for peace\r\nagainst the designs of the German Jingoes. His personal influence, says\r\nthe dispatch, \"had been exerted on many critical occasions in support of\r\npeace.\" The fact of a change of mind in the Kaiser is accepted also by\r\nBaron Beyens.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the truth in this matter, neither the German nor the French\r\nnor our own Government can then have abandoned the effort at peaceable\r\nsettlement. For, in fact, by the summer of 1914, agreements had been made\r\nbetween the Great Powers which settled for the time being the questions\r\nimmediately outstanding. It is understood that a new partition of African\r\nterritory had been arranged to meet the claims and interests of Germany,\r\nFrance, and England alike. The question of the Bagdad railway had been\r\nsettled, and everything seemed to favour the maintenance of peace, when,\r\nsuddenly, the murder of the Archduke sprang upon a dismayed Europe the\r\ncrisis that was at last to prove fatal. The events that followed, so far\r\nas they can be ascertained from published documents, have been so fully\r\ndiscussed that it would be superfluous for me to go over the ground again\r\nin all its detail. But I will indicate briefly what appear to me to be the\r\nmain points of importance in fixing the responsibility for what occurred.\r\n\r\nFirst, the German view, that England is responsible for the war because she\r\ndid not prevent Russia from entering upon it, I regard as childish, if it\r\nis not simply sophistical. The German Powers deliberately take an action\r\nwhich the whole past history of Europe shows must almost certainly lead to\r\na European war, and they then turn round upon Sir Edward Grey and put the\r\nblame on him because he did not succeed in preventing the consequences of\r\ntheir own action. \"He might have kept Russia out.\" Who knows whether he\r\nmight? What we do know is that it was Austria and Germany who brought her\r\nin. The German view is really only intelligible upon the assumption that\r\nGermany has a right to do what she pleases and that the Powers that stand\r\nin her way are by definition peacebreakers. It is this extraordinary\r\nattitude that has been one of the factors for making war in Europe.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I am not, and have not been, one of the critics of Sir Edward\r\nGrey. It is, indeed, possible, as it is always possible after the event, to\r\nsuggest that some other course might have been more successful in avoiding\r\nwar. But that is conjecture, I, at any rate, am convinced, as I believe\r\nevery one outside Germany is convinced, that Sir Edward Grey throughout the\r\nnegotiations had one object only--to avoid, if he could, the catastrophe of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the part of Austria-Hungary is perfectly clear. She was determined\r\nnow, as in 1913, to have out her quarrel with Serbia, at the risk of a\r\nEuropean war. Her guilt is clear and definite, and it is only the fact that\r\nwe are not directly fighting her with British troops that has prevented\r\nBritish opinion from fastening upon it as the main occasion of the war.\r\n\r\nBut this time, quite clearly, Austria was backed by Germany. Why this\r\nchange in German policy? So far as the Kaiser himself is concerned,\r\nthere can be little doubt that a main cause was the horror he felt\r\nat the assassination of the Archduke. The absurd system of autocracy\r\ngives to the emotional reactions of an individual a preposterous weight\r\nin determining world-policy; and the almost insane feeling of the Kaiser\r\nabout the sanctity of crowned heads was no doubt a main reason why Germany\r\nbacked Austria in sending her ultimatum to Serbia. According to Baron\r\nBeyens, on hearing the news of the murder of the Archduke the Kaiser\r\nchanged colour, and exclaimed: \"All the effort of my life for twenty-five\r\nyears must be begun over again!\"[3] A tragic cry which indicates, what I\r\npersonally believe to be the case, that it has been the constant effort of\r\nthe Kaiser to keep the peace in Europe, and that he foresaw now that he\r\nwould no longer be able to resist war.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, it would only be the war between Austria and Serbia\r\nthat the Kaiser would be prepared to sanction. He might hope to avoid\r\nthe European war. And, in fact, there is good reason to suppose that\r\nboth he and the German Foreign Office did cherish that hope or delusion.\r\nThey had bluffed Russia off in 1908. They had the dangerous idea that\r\nthey might bluff her off again. In this connection Baron Beyens records\r\na conversation with his colleague, M. Bollati, the Italian Ambassador\r\nat Berlin, in which the latter took the view that\r\n\r\n  at Vienna as at Berlin they were persuaded that Russia, in spite of\r\n  the official assurances exchanged quite recently between the Tsar and\r\n  M. Poincaré, as to the complete preparations of the armies of the two\r\n  allies, was not in a position to sustain a European war and would not\r\n  dare to plunge into so perilous an adventure.\r\n\r\nBaron Beyens continues:--\r\n\r\n  At Berlin the opinion that Russia was unable to face a European war\r\n  prevailed not only in the official world and in society, but among\r\n  all the manufacturers who specialized in the construction of armaments.\r\n  M. Krupp, the best qualified among them to express an opinion, announced\r\n  on the 28th July, at a table next mine at the Hotel Bristol, that the\r\n  Russian artillery was neither good nor complete, while that of the German\r\n  army had never been of such superior quality. It would be folly on the\r\n  part of Russia, the great maker of guns concluded, to dare to make war\r\n  on Germany and Austria in these conditions.[4]\r\n\r\nBut while the attitude of the German Foreign Office and (as I am inclined\r\nto suppose) of the Kaiser may have been that which I have just suggested,\r\nthere were other and more important factors to be considered. It appears\r\nalmost certain that at some point in the crisis the control of the\r\nsituation was taken out of the hands of the civilians by the military.\r\nThe position of the military is not difficult to understand. They believed,\r\nas professional soldiers usually do, in the \"inevitability\" of war, and\r\nthey had, of course, a professional interest in making war. Their attitude\r\nmay be illustrated from a statement attributed by M. Bourdon to Prince\r\nLichnowsky in 1912[5]: \"The soldiers think about war. It is their business\r\nand their duty. They tell us that the German army, is in good order, that\r\nthe Russian army has not completed its organization, that it would be a\r\ngood moment ... but for twenty years they have been saying the same thing,\"\r\nThe passage is significant. It shows us exactly what it is we have to dread\r\nin \"militarism.\" The danger in a military State is always that when a\r\ncrisis comes the soldiers will get control, as they seem to have done on\r\nthis occasion. From their point of view there was good reason. They knew\r\nthat France and Russia, on a common understanding, were making enormous\r\nmilitary preparations; they knew that these preparations would mature by\r\nthe beginning of 1917; they knew that Germany would fight then at a less\r\nadvantage; they believed she would then have to fight, and they said,\r\n\"Better fight now.\" The following dispatch of Baron Beyens, dated July\r\n26th, may probably be taken as fairly representing their attitude:--\r\n\r\n  To justify these conclusions I must remind you of the opinion which\r\n  prevails in the German General Staff, that war with France and Russia is\r\n  unavoidable and near, an _opinion which the Emperor has been induced to\r\n  share_. Such a war, ardently desired by the military and Pangerman party,\r\n  might be undertaken to-day, as this party think, in circumstances which\r\n  are extremely favourable to Germany, and which probably will not again\r\n  present themselves for some time. Germany has finished the strengthening\r\n  of her army which was decreed by the law of 1912, and, on the other hand,\r\n  she feels that she cannot carry on indefinitely a race in armaments\r\n  with Russia and France which would end by her ruin. The Wehrbeitrag\r\n  has been a disappointment for the Imperial Government, to whom it has\r\n  demonstrated the limits of the national wealth. Russia has made the\r\n  mistake of making a display of her strength before having finished her\r\n  military reorganization. That strength will not be formidable for several\r\n  years: at the present moment it lacks the railway lines necessary for its\r\n  deployment. As to France, M. Charles Humbert has revealed her deficiency\r\n  in guns of large calibre, but apparently it is this arm that will decide\r\n  the fate of battles. For the rest, England, which during the last two\r\n  years Germany has been trying, not without some success, to detach from\r\n  France and Russia, is paralysed by internal dissensions and her Irish\r\n  quarrels.[6]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Baron Beyens supposes the Kaiser to have been in\r\nthe hands of the soldiers as early as July 26th. On the other hand, as\r\nlate as August 5th Beyens believed that the German Foreign Office had\r\nbeen working throughout for peace. Describing an interview he had had\r\non that day with Herr Zimmermann, he writes:--\r\n\r\n  From this interview I brought away the impression that Herr Zimmermann\r\n  spoke to me with his customary sincerity, and that the Department for\r\n  Foreign Affairs since the opening of the Austro-Serbian conflict had been\r\n  on the side of a peaceful solution, and that it was not due to it that\r\n  its views and counsels had not prevailed... A superior power intervened\r\n  to precipitate the march of events. It was the ultimatum from Germany to\r\n  Russia, sent to St. Petersburg at the very moment when the Vienna Cabinet\r\n  was showing itself more disposed to conciliation, which let loose the\r\n  war.[7]\r\n\r\nWhy was that ultimatum sent? According to the German apologists, it\r\nwas sent because Russia had mobilized on the German frontier at the\r\ncritical moment, and so made war inevitable. There is, indeed, no doubt\r\nthat the tension was enormously increased throughout the critical days by\r\nmobilization and rumours of mobilization. The danger was clearly pointed\r\nout as early as July 26th in a dispatch of the Austrian Ambassador at\r\nPetrograd to his Government:--\r\n\r\n  As the result of reports about measures taken for mobilization of Russian\r\n  troops, Count Pourtalès [German Ambassador at Petrograd] has called the\r\n  Russian Minister's attention in the most serious manner to the fact that\r\n  nowadays measures of mobilization would be a highly dangerous form of\r\n  diplomatic pressure. For in that event the purely military consideration\r\n  of the question by the General Staffs would find expression, and if that\r\n  button were once touched in Germany the situation would get out of\r\n  control.[8]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be remembered that in 1909 Austria had mobilized\r\nagainst Serbia and Montenegro,[9] and in 1912-13 Russia and Austria had\r\nmobilized against one another without war ensuing in either case. Moreover,\r\nin view of the slowness of Russian mobilization, it is difficult to believe\r\nthat a day or two would make the difference between security and ruin to\r\nGermany. However, it is possible that the Kaiser was so advised by his\r\nsoldiers, and genuinely believed the country to be in danger. We do not\r\ndefinitely know. What we do know is, that it was the German ultimatum that\r\nprecipitated the war.\r\n\r\nWe are informed, however, by Baron Beyens that even at the last moment the\r\nGerman Foreign Office made one more effort for peace:--\r\n\r\n  As no reply had been received from St. Petersburg by noon the next day\r\n  [after the dispatch of the German ultimatum], MM. de Jagow and Zimmermann\r\n  (I have it from the latter) hurried to the Chancellor and the Kaiser to\r\n  prevent the issue of the order for general mobilization, and to persuade\r\n  his Majesty to wait till the following day. It was the last effort of\r\n  their dying pacifism, or the last awakening of their conscience. Their\r\n  efforts were broken against the irreducible obstinacy of the Minister of\r\n  War and the army chiefs, who represented to the Kaiser the disastrous\r\n  consequences of a delay of twenty-four hours.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: French Yellow Book, No. 6. In \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre\"\r\n(p. 24) Baron Beyens states that this conversation was held at Potsdam on\r\nNovember 5th or 6th; the Kaiser said that war between Germany and France\r\nwas \"inevitable and near.\" Baron Beyens, presumably, is the authority from\r\nwhom M. Cambon derives his information.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Above, p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 273.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 280 seq.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See \"L'Enigme Allemande,\" p. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Second Belgian Grey Book, No. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Second Belgian Grey Book, No. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Austrian Red Book, No. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See Chapter 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"L'Allemagne avant la guerre,\" p. 301.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _The Responsibility and the Moral_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this brief account that so far as the published\r\nevidence goes I agree with the general view outside Germany that the\r\nresponsibility for the war at the last moment rests with the Powers of\r\nCentral Europe. The Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, which there can be\r\nno reasonable doubt was known to and approved by the German Government,\r\nwas the first crime. And it is hardly palliated by the hope, which no\r\nwell-informed men ought to have entertained, that Russia could be kept\r\nout and the war limited to Austria and Serbia. The second crime was the\r\nGerman ultimatum to Russia and to France. I have no desire whatever to\r\nexplain away or palliate these clear facts. But it was not my object in\r\nwriting this pamphlet to reiterate a judgment which must already be that\r\nof all my readers. What I have wanted to do is to set the tragic events of\r\nthose few days of diplomacy in their proper place in the whole complex of\r\ninternational politics. And what I do dispute with full conviction is the\r\nview which seems to be almost universally held in England, that Germany\r\nhad been pursuing for years past a policy of war, while all the other\r\nPowers had been pursuing a policy of peace. The war finally provoked by\r\nGermany was, I am convinced, conceived as a \"preventive war.\" And that\r\nmeans that it was due to the belief that if Germany did not fight then\r\nshe would be compelled to fight at a great disadvantage later. I have\r\nwritten in vain if I have not convinced the reader that the European\r\nanarchy inevitably provokes that state of mind in the Powers, and that\r\nthey all live constantly under the threat of war. To understand the\r\naction of those who had power in Germany during the critical days it\r\nis necessary to bear in mind all that I have brought into relief in\r\nthe preceding pages: the general situation, which grouped the Powers\r\nof the Entente against those of the Triple Alliance; the armaments and\r\ncounter-armaments; the colonial and economic rivalry; the racial and\r\nnational problems in South-East Europe; and the long series of previous\r\ncrises, in each case tided over, but leaving behind, every one of them,\r\na legacy of fresh mistrust and fear, which made every new crisis worse\r\nthan the one before. I do not palliate the responsibility of Germany for\r\nthe outbreak of war. But that responsibility is embedded in and conditioned\r\nby a responsibility deeper and more general--the responsibility of all the\r\nPowers alike for the European anarchy.\r\n\r\nIf I have convinced the reader of this he will, I think, feel no difficulty\r\nin following me to a further conclusion. Since the causes of this war, and\r\nof all wars, lie so deep in the whole international system, they cannot be\r\npermanently removed by the \"punishment\" or the \"crushing\" or any other\r\ndrastic treatment of any Power, let that Power be as guilty as you please.\r\nWhatever be the issue of this war, one thing is certain: it will bring no\r\nlasting peace to Europe unless it brings a radical change both in the\r\nspirit and in the organization of international politics.\r\n\r\nWhat that change must be may be deduced from the foregoing discussion of\r\nthe causes of the war. The war arose from the rivalry of States in the\r\npursuit of power and wealth. This is universally admitted. Whatever be the\r\ndiversities of opinion that prevail in the different countries concerned,\r\nnobody pretends that the war arose out of any need of civilization, out of\r\nany generous impulse or noble ambition. It arose, according to the popular\r\nview in England, solely and exclusively out of the ambition of Germany to\r\nseize territory and power. It arose, according to the popular German view,\r\nout of the ambition of England to attack and destroy the rising power and\r\nwealth of Germany. Thus to each set of belligerents the war appears as one\r\nforced upon them by sheer wickedness, and from neither point of view has\r\nit any kind of moral justification. These views, it is true, are both\r\ntoo simple for the facts. But the account given in the preceding pages,\r\nimperfect as it is, shows clearly, what further knowledge will only make\r\nmore explicit, that the war proceeded out of rivalry for empire between all\r\nthe Great Powers in every part of the world. The contention between France\r\nand Germany for the control of Morocco, the contention between Russia and\r\nAustria for the control of the Balkans, the contention between Germany and\r\nthe other Powers for the control of Turkey--these were the causes of the\r\nwar. And this contention for control is prompted at once by the desire for\r\npower and the desire for wealth. In practice the two motives are found\r\nconjoined. But to different minds they appeal in different proportions.\r\nThere is such a thing as the love of power for its own sake. It is known in\r\nindividuals, and it is known in States, and it is the most disastrous, if\r\nnot the most evil, of the human passions. The modern German philosophy of\r\nthe State turns almost exclusively upon this idea; and here, as elsewhere,\r\nby giving to a passion an intellectual form, the Germans have magnified\r\nits force and enhanced its monstrosity. But the passion itself is not\r\npeculiar to Germans, nor is it only they to whom it is and has been a\r\nmotive of State. Power has been the fetish of kings and emperors from the\r\nbeginning of political history, and it remains to be seen whether it will\r\nnot continue to inspire democracies. The passion for empire ruined the\r\nAthenian democracy, no less than the Spartan or the Venetian oligarchy,\r\nor the Spain of Philip II, or the France of the Monarchy and the Empire.\r\nBut it still makes its appeal to the romantic imagination. Its intoxication\r\nhas lain behind this war, and it will prompt many others if it survives,\r\nwhen the war is over, either in the defeated or the conquering nations.\r\nIt is not only the jingoism of Germany that Europe has to fear. It is\r\nthe jingoism that success may make supreme in any country that may be\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nBut while power may be sought for its own sake, it is commonly sought\r\nby modern States as a means to wealth. It is the pursuit of markets and\r\nconcessions and outlets for capital that lies behind the colonial policy\r\nthat leads to wars. States compete for the right to exploit the weak, and\r\nin this competition Governments are prompted or controlled by financial\r\ninterests. The British went to Egypt for the sake of the bondholders, the\r\nFrench to Morocco for the sake of its minerals and wealth. In the Near East\r\nand the Far it is commerce, concessions, loans that have led to the rivalry\r\nof the Powers, to war after war, to \"punitive expeditions\" and--irony of\r\nironies!--to \"indemnities\" exacted as a new and special form of robbery\r\nfrom peoples who rose in the endeavour to defend themselves against\r\nrobbery. The Powers combine for a moment to suppress the common victim,\r\nthe next they are at one another's throats over the spoil. That really is\r\nthe simple fact about the quarrels of States over colonial and commercial\r\npolicy. So long as the exploitation of undeveloped countries is directed by\r\ncompanies having no object in view except dividends, so long as financiers\r\nprompt the policy of Governments, so long as military expeditions, leading\r\nup to annexations, are undertaken behind the back of the public for reasons\r\nthat cannot be avowed, so long will the nations end with war, where they\r\nhave begun by theft, and so long will thousands and millions of innocent\r\nand generous lives, the best of Europe, be thrown away to no purpose,\r\nbecause, in the dark, sinister interests have been risking the peace\r\nof the world for the sake of money in their pockets.\r\n\r\nIt is these tremendous underlying facts and tendencies that suggest the\r\ntrue moral of this war. It is these that have to be altered if we are to\r\navoid future wars on a scale as great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _The Settlement_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, with all this in our minds, let us turn to consider the vexed\r\nquestion of the settlement after the war. There lies before the Western\r\nworld the greatest of all choices, the choice between destruction and\r\nsalvation. But that choice does not depend merely on the issue of the\r\nwar. It depends upon what is done or left undone by the co-operation of\r\nall when the war does at last stop. Two conceptions of the future are\r\ncontending in all nations. One is the old bad one, that which has presided\r\nhitherto at every peace and prepared every new war. It assumes that the\r\nobject of war is solely to win victory, and the object of victory solely\r\nto acquire more power and territory. On this view, if the Germans win, they\r\nare to annex territory east and west: Belgium and half France, say the more\r\nviolent; the Baltic provinces of Russia, strategic points of advantage, say\r\nthe more moderate. On the other hand, if the Allies win, the Allies are to\r\ndivide the German colonies, the French are to regain Alsace-Lorraine, and,\r\nas the jingoes add, they are to take the whole of the German provinces on\r\nthe left bank of the Rhine, and even territory beyond it. The Italians are\r\nto have not only Italia Irredenta but hundreds of thousands of reluctant\r\nSlavs in Dalmatia; the Russians Constantinople, and perhaps Posen and\r\nGalicia. Further, such money indemnities are to be taken as it may prove\r\npossible to exact from an already ruined foe; trade and commerce with\r\nthe enemy is to be discouraged or prohibited; and, above all, a bitter\r\nand unforgiving hatred is to reign for ever between the victor and the\r\nvanquished. This is the kind of view of the settlement of Europe that is\r\nconstantly appearing in the articles and correspondence of the Press of all\r\ncountries. Ministers are not as careful as they should be to repudiate it.\r\nThe nationalist and imperialist cliques of all nations endorse it. It is,\r\none could almost fear, for something like this that the peoples are being\r\nkept at war, and the very existence of civilization jeopardized.\r\n\r\nNow, whether anything of this kind really can be achieved by the war,\r\nwhether there is the least probability that either group of Powers can\r\nwin such a victory as would make the programme on either side a reality,\r\nI will not here discuss. The reader will have his own opinion. What I am\r\nconcerned with is the effect any such solution would have upon the future\r\nof Europe. Those who desire such a close may be divided into two classes.\r\nThe one frankly believes in war, in domination, and in power. It accepts\r\nas inevitable, and welcomes as desirable, the perpetual armed conflict of\r\nnations for territory and trade. It does not believe in, and it does not\r\nwant, a durable peace. It holds that all peace is, must be, and ought to\r\nbe, a precarious and regrettable interval between wars. I do not discuss\r\nthis view. Those who hold it are not accessible to argument, and can only\r\nbe met by action. There are others, however, who do think war an evil, who\r\ndo want a durable peace, but who genuinely believe that the way indicated\r\nis the best way to achieve it. With them it is permitted to discuss, and it\r\nshould be possible to do so without bitterness or rage on either side. For\r\nas to the end, there is agreement; the difference of opinion is as to the\r\nmeans. The position taken is this: The enemy deliberately made this war of\r\naggression against us, without provocation, in order to destroy us. If it\r\nhad not been for this wickedness there would have been no war. The enemy,\r\ntherefore, must be punished; and his punishment must make him permanently\r\nimpotent to repeat the offence. That having been done, Europe will have\r\ndurable peace, for there will be no one left able to break it who will\r\nalso want to break it. Now, I believe all this to be demonstrably a\r\nmiscalculation. It is contradicted both by our knowledge of the way\r\nhuman nature works and by the evidence of history. In the first place,\r\nwars do not arise because only one nation or group of nations is wicked,\r\nthe others being good. For the actual outbreak of this war, I believe, as\r\nI have already said, that a few powerful individuals in Austria and in\r\nGermany were responsible. But the ultimate causes of war lie much deeper.\r\nIn them all States are implicated. And the punishment, or even the\r\nannihilation, of any one nation would leave those causes still subsisting.\r\nWipe out Germany from the map, and, if you do nothing else, the other\r\nnations will be at one another's throats in the old way, for the old\r\ncauses. They would be quarrelling, if about nothing else, about the\r\ndivision of the spoil. While nations continue to contend for power,\r\nwhile they refuse to substitute law for force, there will continue to\r\nbe wars. And while they devote the best of their brains and the chief\r\nof their resources to armaments and military and naval organization,\r\neach war will become more terrible, more destructive, and more ruthless\r\nthan the last. This is irrefutable truth. I do not believe there is a\r\nman or woman able to understand the statement who will deny it.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the enemy nation cannot, in fact, be annihilated,\r\nnor even so far weakened, relatively to the rest, as to be incapable of\r\nrecovering and putting up another fight. The notions of dividing up Germany\r\namong the Allies, or of adding France and the British Empire to Germany,\r\nare sheerly fantastic. There will remain, when all is done, the defeated\r\nnations--if, indeed, any nation be defeated. Their territories cannot be\r\npermanently occupied by enemy troops; they themselves cannot be permanently\r\nprevented by physical force from building up new armaments. So long as they\r\nwant their revenge, they will be able sooner or later to take it. If\r\nevidence of this were wanted, the often-quoted case of Prussia after\r\nJena will suffice.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the third place, the defeated nations, so treated, will, in fact,\r\nwant their revenge. There seems to be a curious illusion abroad, among the\r\nEnglish and their allies, that not only is Germany guilty of the war, but\r\nthat all Germans know it in their hearts; that, being guilty, they will\r\nfully accept punishment, bow patiently beneath the yoke, and become in\r\nfuture good, harmonious members of the European family. The illusion is\r\ngrotesque. There is hardly a German who does not believe that the war was\r\nmade by Russia and by England; that Germany is the innocent victim; that\r\nall right is on her side, and all wrong on that of the Allies. If, indeed,\r\nshe were beaten, and treated as her \"punishers\" desire, this belief would\r\nbe strengthened, not weakened. In every German heart would abide, deep and\r\nstrong, the sense of an iniquitous triumph of what they believe to be wrong\r\nover right, and of a duty to redress that iniquity. Outraged national pride\r\nwould be reinforced by the sense of injustice; and the next war, the war of\r\nrevenge, would be prepared for, not only by every consideration of interest\r\nand of passion, but by every cogency of righteousness. The fact that the\r\nGermans are mistaken in their view of the origin of the war has really\r\nnothing to do with the case. It is not the truth, it is what men believe\r\nto be the truth, that influences their action. And I do not think any\r\nstudy of dispatches is going to alter the German view of the facts.\r\n\r\nBut it is sometimes urged that the war was made by the German militarists,\r\nthat it is unpopular with the mass of the people, and that if Germany is\r\nutterly defeated the people will rise and depose their rulers, become a\r\ntrue democracy, and join fraternal hands with the other nations of Europe.\r\nThat Germany should become a true democracy might, indeed, be as great a\r\nguarantee of peace as it might be that other nations, called democratic,\r\nshould really become so in their foreign policy as well as in their\r\ndomestic affairs. But what proud nation will accept democracy as a\r\ngift from insolent conquerors? One thing that the war has done, and\r\none of the worst, is to make of the Kaiser, to every German, a symbol\r\nof their national unity and national force. Just because we abuse their\r\nmilitarism, they affirm and acclaim it; just because we attack their\r\ngoverning class, they rally round it. Nothing could be better calculated\r\nthan this war to strengthen the hold of militarism in Germany, unless it\r\nbe the attempt of her enemies to destroy her militarism by force. For\r\nconsider--! In the view we are examining it is proposed, first to kill\r\nthe greater part of her combatants, next to invade her territory, destroy\r\nher towns and villages, and exact (for there are those who demand it)\r\npenalties in kind, actual tit for tat, for what Germans have done in\r\nBelgium. It is proposed to enter the capital in triumph. It is proposed\r\nto shear away huge pieces of German territory. And then, when all this\r\nhas been done, the conquerors are to turn to the German nation and say:\r\n\"Now, all this we have done for your good! Depose your wicked rulers!\r\nBecome a democracy! Shake hands and be a good fellow!\" Does it not\r\nsound grotesque? But, really, that is what is proposed.\r\n\r\nI have spoken about British and French proposals for the treatment of\r\nGermany. But all that I have said applies, of course, equally to German\r\nproposals of the same kind for the treatment of the conquered Allies. That\r\nway is no way towards a durable peace. If it be replied that a durable\r\npeace is not intended or desired, I have no more to say. If it be replied\r\nthat punishment for its own sake is more important than civilization, and\r\nmust be performed at all costs--_fiat justitia, ruat coelum_--then, once\r\nmore, I have nothing to say. I speak to those, and to those only, who do\r\ndesire a durable peace, and who have the courage and the imagination to\r\nbelieve it to be possible, and the determination to work for it. And to\r\nthem I urge that the course I have been discussing cannot lead to their\r\ngoal. What can?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _The Change Needed_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, a change of outlook. We must give up, in all nations, this habit\r\nof dwelling on the unique and peculiar wickedness of the enemy. We must\r\nrecognize that behind the acts that led up to the immediate outbreak of\r\nwar, behind the crimes and atrocities to which the war has led, as wars\r\nalways have led, and always will lead--behind all that lies a great complex\r\nof feeling, prejudice, tradition, false theory, in which all nations and\r\nall individuals of all nations are involved. Most men believe, feel, or\r\npassively accept that power and wealth are the objects States ought\r\nto pursue; that in pursuing these objects they are bound by no code of\r\nright in their relations to one another; that law between them is, and\r\nmust be, as fragile as a cobweb stretched before the mouth of a cannon;\r\nthat force is the only rule and the only determinant of their differences,\r\nand that the only real question is when and how the appeal to force may\r\nmost advantageously be made. This philosophy has been expressed with\r\npeculiar frankness and brutality by Germans. But most honest and candid\r\nmen, I believe, will agree that that is the way they, too, have been\r\naccustomed to think of international affairs. And if illustration were\r\nwanted, let them remember the kind of triumphant satisfaction with which\r\nthe failure of the Hague conferences to achieve any radical results was\r\ngenerally greeted, and the contemptuous and almost abhorring pity meted\r\nout to the people called \"pacifists.\" Well, the war has come! We see now,\r\nnot only guess, what it means. If that experience has not made a deep\r\nimpression on every man and woman, if something like a conversion is not\r\nbeing generally operated, then, indeed, nothing can save mankind from the\r\nhell of their own passions and imbecilities.\r\n\r\nBut if otherwise, if that change is going on, then the way to deliverance\r\nis neither difficult nor obscure. It does not lie in the direction of\r\ncrushing anybody. It lies in the taking of certain determinations, and\r\nthe embodying of them in certain institutions.\r\n\r\nFirst, the nations must submit to law and to right in the settlement of\r\ntheir disputes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, they must reserve force for the coercion of the law-breaker;\r\nand that implies that they should construct rules to determine who the\r\nlaw-breaker is. Let him be defined as the one who appeals to force, instead\r\nof appealing to law and right by machinery duly provided for that purpose,\r\nand the aggressor is immediately under the ban of the civilized world, and\r\nmet by an overwhelming force to coerce him into order. In constructing\r\nmachinery of this kind there is no intellectual difficulty greater than\r\nthat which has confronted every attempt everywhere to substitute order\r\nfor force. The difficulty is moral, and lies in the habits, passions,\r\nand wills of men. But it should not be concluded that, if such a moral\r\nchange could be operated, there would be no need for the machinery. It\r\nwould be as reasonable to say that Governments, law-courts, and police\r\nwere superfluous, since, if men were good, they would not require them,\r\nand if they are bad they will not tolerate them. Whatever new need, desire,\r\nand conviction comes up in mankind, needs embodiment in forms before it\r\ncan become operative. And, as the separate colonies of America could not\r\neffectively unite until they had formed a Constitution, so will the States\r\nof Europe and the world be unable to maintain the peace, even though all\r\nof them should wish to maintain it, unless they will construct some kind\r\nof machinery for settling their disputes and organizing their common\r\npurposes, and will back that machinery by force. If they will do that\r\nthey may construct a real and effective counterpoise to aggression from\r\nany Power in the future. If they will not do it, their precautions against\r\nany one Power will be idle, for it will be from some other Power that the\r\ndanger will come.
