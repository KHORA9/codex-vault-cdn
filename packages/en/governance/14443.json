In the months\r\nwhich have elapsed, there have been plenty of events to emphasize the\r\nmutability and the everlasting tragedy of human life. Some men have\r\ndied; figures that seemed almost the immortal portion of the life of\r\nParliament have disappeared into night, and their place knows them no\r\nmore; others have met the fate, more sinister and melancholy, of\r\nchanging a life of dignity and honour for one of ignominy and shame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The irony of the seats.]\r\n\r\nBut no such thought disturbed the cheerful souls of some of the Irish\r\nMembers; in the worst of times there is something exuberant in the Celt\r\nthat rises superior to circumstance. This was to be an Irish Session;\r\nand the great fight of Ireland's future government was to be\r\nfought--perhaps finally. But there was another circumstance which\r\ndistinguished this Session from its predecessors. The question of seats\r\nis always a burning one in the House of Commons. In an assembly in which\r\nthere is only sitting accommodation for two out of every three members,\r\nthere are bound to be some awkward questions when feeling runs high and\r\ndebates are interesting. But at the beginning of this Session, things\r\nhad got to a worse pass than ever. The Irish Party resolved to remain on\r\nthe Opposition side of the House, true to their principle, that until\r\nIreland receives Home Rule, they are in opposition to all and every form\r\nof Government from Westminster. The result was the bringing together of\r\nthe strangest of bedfellows in all sections in the House. There is none\r\nso fiercely opposed to Home Rule as the Irish Orangeman. But the\r\nOrangemen are a portion of the Opposition as well as the Irish\r\nNationalists, with the inconvenient result that there sat cheek by jowl\r\nmen who had about as much love for each other's principles as a country\r\nvicar has for a Northampton Freethinker. On the other hand, a deadlier\r\nhatred exists between the regular Liberal and the Liberal Unionist than\r\nbetween the ordinary Liberal and the ordinary Tory. But by the irony of\r\nfate, the action of the Irish Party compelled the Unionists to sit on\r\nthe Liberal benches again, with the result that men were ranged side by\r\nside, whose hatreds, personal and political, were as deadly as any in\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Watchers for the dawn.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this, there occurred in the House on Tuesday morning,\r\nJanuary 31st, a scene unparalleled since the famous day when Mr.\r\nGladstone brought in his Home Rule Bill in 1886. Night was still\r\nfighting the hosts of advancing morn, when a Tory Member--Mr.\r\nSeton-Karr--approached the closed doors of the House of Commons, and\r\ndemanded admission to a seat. For nearly an hour he was left alone with\r\nthe darkness, and the ghosts of dead statesmen and forgotten scenes of\r\noratory, passion, and triumph. But as six o'clock was striking, there\r\nentered the yard around the House two figures--similar in\r\npurpose--different in appearance. Mr. Johnson, of Ballykilbeg, is by\r\nthis time one of the familiar types of the House; and, from his evident\r\nsincerity, is, in spite of the terrible and mediæval narrowness of his\r\ncreed, personally popular. Mr. Johnson is an Orangeman of Orangemen. Now\r\nand then he delivers a speech, in which he declares that rather than see\r\nHome Rule in Ireland, he and his friends will line the ditches with\r\nriflemen. The Pope disturbs his dreams by night and stalks across his\r\nspeeches by day; and there is a general impression about him that he is\r\nresolved, some time or other, to walk through a good large stream of\r\nPapist blood. He is also a violent teetotaller; and is so strong on this\r\npoint that he is ready to shake hands, even with the deadliest Irish\r\nopponent, across the back of a Sunday Closing Bill. Like most\r\nParliamentary fire-eaters, he is a mild-mannered man. Time hath dealt\r\ntenderly with him. But still he is well on to the seventies: his hair,\r\nonce belligerently red, is thin and streaked with grey; and he walks\r\nsomewhat slowly, and not very vigorously. Dr. Rentoul is a man of a\r\ndifferent type. What Johnson feels, Rentoul affects. He is a tall,\r\ncommon-looking, heavily-built, blustering kind of fellow; great, it is\r\nsaid, on the abusive Tory platform, almost dumb and utterly impotent in\r\nthe House of Commons. These were the vanguard of the Orange army, and\r\nthey proceeded to appropriate the first and best seats they could lay\r\ntheir hands upon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Tanner and his waistcoat.]\r\n\r\nDr. Tanner, soon after this, appeared blazing on the scene; and sorrow\r\ncame upon him that any of the enemy should have forestalled him. Like\r\nMr. Johnson, Tanner is a Protestant--but, unlike him, is as fiercely\r\nNationalist as the other is Orange; and, whenever the waves are\r\ndisturbed by the Parliamentary storm, Tanner is pretty sure to be heard\r\nof and from. Viewing the scene of battle strategically, Tanner struck on\r\nan idea which was certainly original. Accounts differ as to whether he\r\nwas the possessor of one hat or several; but tradition would suggest\r\nthat he had more than one. It is certain, however, that he did take off\r\nhis coat and waistcoat; and stretching these across the unclaimed land\r\nof seats, did thereby signify to all mankind that the seats thus\r\ndecorated were his. But the novel form of appropriation--it suggests a\r\nwrinkle to prospectors in mining countries--was held to be illegal; and\r\nthe poor doctor had to content himself with using the hat, or hats, as a\r\nmeans of securing seats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonel Saunderson.]\r\n\r\nColonel Saunderson--another of the Orange army of fire-eaters--was early\r\nat the trysting-place; and this brought about one of the curiosities of\r\nthe sitting. On the first seat below the gangway sat Dr. Tanner; on the\r\nvery next seat, as close to him as one sardine to another in a box, sat\r\nColonel Saunderson. Not for worlds would these two men exchange a\r\nsyllable; indeed, it was a relief to most people to find that they did\r\nnot break out into oaths and blows. What rendered the situation worse,\r\nwas that Dr. Tanner has a fine exuberant habit of expressing his\r\nopinions for the benefit of all around him. At his back sat William\r\nO'Brien, with his keen thin face, his eyes full of latent fire, his\r\nstern, set jaw--his glasses suggesting the student and philosopher, who\r\nis always the most perilous and fierce of politicians; and to William\r\nO'Brien, Tanner made a running and biting commentary on the speeches--a\r\ncommentary, as can easily be guessed, from the extreme National point of\r\nview. This was the music to which the Orange Colonel had to listen\r\nthrough the long hours that stretched between his early morning arrival\r\nand midnight. How men will consent to go through all this travail is, to\r\neasy-going people, one of the curiosities of political struggle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chamberlain Party.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, there had been another and an equally important descent. Mr.\r\nChamberlain made his son the Whip of the Unionist Party. The resemblance\r\nbetween father and son is something even closer than that usually\r\nnoticed between relatives. The son looks a good deal more gentlemanly\r\nthan the father. But the single eyeglass--which no man can wear without\r\nlooking more or less of a snob--is even less becoming to the youthful\r\nAusten than to the parent; and gives him even a coarser air. There is a\r\nsuspicion that young Chamberlain also came to the House armed with a\r\ngoodly supply of hats; at all events, he and his friends managed to\r\nsecure a large number of seats for the Unionists. Chamberlain and his\r\nfriends sat together on the third bench below the gangway--a position of\r\n'vantage in some respects--from which they could survey the House. The\r\nfirst seat was occupied by Mr. Chamberlain; next him was Sir Henry\r\nJames, and then came Mr. Courtney, in a snuff-coloured coat and drab\r\nwaistcoat; for all the world like an old-fashioned squire who has not\r\nyet learned to accommodate himself to the sombre garments of an\r\nunpicturesque age. The dutiful Austen left himself without a seat, and\r\nwas content to kneel in the gangway, and there take sweet counsel from\r\nhis parent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enter the G.O.M.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, as everybody knows, was not technically a member of the\r\nHouse of Commons when it met at the beginning of the Session. He had to\r\nbe sworn, and the first business of the House was to witness this\r\nceremony. I remember the first day I was a member of the House, and saw\r\na similar spectacle--it was in 1880. Then the House was crowded, and\r\nthere was a tremendous demonstration; but on the opening day of the\r\nSession just ended, the ceremony came off a little earlier than had been\r\nexpected, and the House was not as full as one would have anticipated.\r\nThen there was a great deal of work to be done; every section of the\r\nHouse was busy with the attempt to get an opportunity of bringing in\r\nBills. The Irishmen are always to the front on these occasions, with the\r\nlist of a dozen Bills, which they seek to bring forward on\r\nWednesdays--the day that is still sacred to the private member anxious\r\nto legislate. The Welsh members have now taken up the same lesson; the\r\nLondon members are likewise on the alert. Now, in order to get a chance\r\nof bringing in a Bill, it is necessary to ballot--then it is first come,\r\nfirst served. To get your chance in the ballot, you must put your name\r\ndown on what is called the notice paper, where a number is placed\r\nopposite your name. The clerks put into the balloting-box as many\r\nnumbers as there are names on the notice paper--they approached 400 on\r\nthe day in question--and then the number is drawn out, and the Speaker\r\ncalls upon the member whose number has proved to be the lucky one. A\r\nwhole crowd of members were standing waiting their turn to do this the\r\nvery moment when the Old Man walked up the floor of the House to take\r\nthe oaths, and there was a great deal of noise and confusion; but his\r\nadvent was noted instinctively and rapidly, and there was a mighty cheer\r\nof welcome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How he looked.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone walks down to the House, unless on great occasions. Then\r\nthere would be an obvious danger, from the enthusiasm of his admirers,\r\nif he were on foot. Whenever there is any chance of a demonstration,\r\naccordingly, he comes down in an open carriage, with Mrs. Gladstone at\r\nhis side. On that 31st of January, the enthusiastic love of which he was\r\nthe object, had several times overflowed; it had brought a huge crowd to\r\nDowning Street, and it had dogged the footsteps of the Prime Minister\r\nwherever he was seen. With bare head--with eyes glistening--with a cheek\r\nwhose wax-like pallor was touched with an unusual gleam of colour--the\r\nGrand Old Man came down to his greatest Session, amid a thicket of\r\nloving faces and cheering throats. I fancy one of Mrs. Gladstone's\r\nheaviest tasks is to look after the clothes of her illustrious husband.\r\nHe manages to make them all awry whenever he gets the chance. He may be\r\nseen at the beginning of an evening with a neat black tie just in its\r\nproper place; and towards the end of the evening the same tie is away\r\nunder his jugular--as though he were trying experiments in the art of\r\nexpeditiously hanging a man. But on these great occasions he is always\r\nso dressed as to bring out in full relief all the strange and varied\r\nbeauty of his splendid face and figure. For nature--in the richness and\r\nabundance of her endowment of this portentous personage--has made him\r\nnot only the greatest man in the House of Commons, but also the\r\nhandsomest. He was dressed in the solemn black frock coat which he\r\nalways wears on great occasions, and in his buttonhole there was a\r\nbeautiful little boutonnière of white roses and lilies of the valley.\r\nThe waxen pallor was still relieved by the glow caused by his\r\nenthusiastic reception from the people, as, with his son Herbert on the\r\none side and Mr. Marjoribanks, the chief Liberal whip, on the other, he\r\nwalked up the floor of the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Ministry.]\r\n\r\nOne after another, the new Ministers followed--their receptions varying\r\nwith their popularity--and at last they were all seated on the Treasury\r\nBench. In their looks there was ample indication of the intellectual\r\nsupremacy which had raised them to that exalted position. Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad Sir William Harcourt--his Chancellor of the Exchequer--on his right,\r\nand on his left sat Mr. John Morley, with his thin face and smile, half\r\nascetic, half kindly. Then came the newest man of the Government, that\r\nfortunate youth to whom power and recognition have come, not in withered\r\nor soured old age, but in the full prime of his manhood. Mr. Asquith\r\ntakes his seat next Mr. Morley; and it is, perhaps, the close proximity\r\nwhich suggests the strong physical likeness between the two. Both are\r\nclean shaven; both have the long narrow profile that is called\r\nhatchet-faced; in both there is the compression of lips that reveals\r\ndepths of strength and tenacity; both have the slightly ascetic air of\r\nthe philosopher turned politician; both look singularly young, not only\r\nfor their years, but for the dazzling eminence of their positions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other groups.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, there are other groups in the House that are gradually\r\nforming, and that have since played a momentous part in this great\r\nSession. Mr. Labouchere sits in his old place below the gangway--a seat\r\nwhich has become his almost by right of usage, but which he has to\r\nsecure still every day, by that regular attendance at prayers which is\r\nso sweet to a devout soul. Next him sits Mr. Philipps--one of the\r\nyounger generation of Radicals; and then comes Sir Charles Dilke--very\r\ncarefully dressed, looking wonderfully well--rosy-cheeked, and\r\naltogether a younger-looking and gayer-spirited man than the haggard and\r\npale figure which used to sit on the Treasury Bench in the days of his\r\nglory. John Burns is up among the Irish and the Tories, in visible\r\nopposition to all Governments. There is something breezy about John\r\nBurns that does one good to look at. He wears a short coat--generally of\r\na thick blue material, that always brings to one's mental eye the\r\nflowing sea and the mounting wave. A stout-limbed, lion-hearted\r\nskipper--that's what John Burns looks like. There is plenty of fire in\r\nthe deep, dark, large eyes, and of tenderness as well; and all that\r\ncurious mixture of rage and tears that makes up the stern defender of\r\nthe hopeless and the forlorn and weak. On the opposite side, in the\r\nLiberal ranks, sits Sam Woods--the miners' agent, who was sent from the\r\nInce Division of Lancashire instead of an aristocrat of ancient race;\r\nalso a remarkable man, with the somewhat pallid face of the life-long\r\nteetotaller, and eyes that have the mingled expression of wrath and pity\r\ncommon among the leaders of forlorn hopes and new crusades. Mr. Wilson,\r\nthe member for Middlesbrough, is restless, and moves about a good deal.\r\nHe has resolved to bring in a Bill to improve the wretched condition of\r\n\"Poor Jack,\" in whose company he spent many years of his own hard life;\r\nand there is a gleam of triumph as an Irish member, in accordance with a\r\nprevious arrangement, gives notice of a Bill for that purpose when the\r\nhazard of the ballot gives opportunity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mover and Seconder.]\r\n\r\nIt is an honourable but a painful distinction to have either to move or\r\nto second the reply to the Speech from the Throne. One of the silly\r\nsurvivals of a feudal past still obliges men who have to perform this\r\nduty to make perfect guys of themselves, by wearing some outlandish\r\nuniform. Even the sturdiest Radical has to submit to this process;\r\nthough I hope when John Burns comes to figure in that honourable\r\nposition he will insist on retaining his breezy pea-jacket and his\r\nbillycock hat. It was very late in the evening when Mr. Lambert--the\r\nvictor in the great South Molton fight--had the opportunity of rising;\r\nand it was even still later when Mr. Beaufoy rose. I must pass over\r\ntheir speeches by saying that both speakers did extremely well. Even Mr.\r\nBalfour had to compliment them; and the Old Man almost went out of his\r\nway to express his gratification.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Balfour.]\r\n\r\nIt was everywhere remarked that most of the leaders of parties began the\r\nSession in excellent fighting trim. Mr. Morley has been living in the\r\npleasant green meadows and fields of the Phoenix Park, and looks five\r\nyears younger than he did last year. The Old Man astounded everybody by\r\nhis briskness; and Mr. Balfour also entered on the fray with every sign\r\nof being in excellent health and spirits. There had been a great roar of\r\ntriumph when he came into the House, and throughout his speech--clever,\r\nbiting, and adroit--his party kept up a ringing and well-organized\r\nchorus of pointed cheers. The speech was a significant departure from\r\nthe ordinary stamp--a fact which Mr. Gladstone, who is notably a great\r\nstickler for tradition, did not fail to notice. For the almost unbroken\r\ntradition of the House of Commons is that the first night shall be one\r\nof almost loving-kindness between the one side and the other. I remember\r\nwell _Punch_ indicated this once by representing Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\nDisraeli beginning a Session by presenting each other with roses, while\r\nbehind their backs was a thick bundle of whips.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fray opens.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Balfour is independent of tradition, and demonstrated it at once\r\nwith a speech almost vehement, in part, in its attack. He had a whole\r\nhost of flings at Mr. Justice Mathew and the Evicted Tenants'\r\nCommission--his hits, though sufficiently obvious, and almost cheap,\r\nbeing rapturously received. Altogether, it must be said the Opposition\r\nwere in excellent form, and cheered their man with a lustiness which\r\ndid them infinite credit. The Liberals, on the other hand, with forces\r\nsomewhat scattered--the round Irish chorus being especially so, in the\r\nremote distance--did not seem equally well-organized from the point of\r\nview of the _claque_. With the dynamite prisoners Mr. Balfour dealt so\r\ngingerly that it was evident he knew the weakness of the Tory case, and\r\nwas very apprehensive that Mr. Matthews would be found to have sold the\r\npass. The ex-Home Secretary, meantime, was still disporting himself\r\naround the Red Sea or in the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb; and Mr. Balfour,\r\nwho has notoriously a bad memory, was left groping in the cobwebs of his\r\nbrain, trying to recollect which of the dynamitards it was Mr. Matthews\r\nintended to retain and which to release. Attacking the action of Mr.\r\nMorley with regard to the liberation of the Gweedore prisoners, Mr.\r\nBalfour brought upon himself a series of sharp interruptions from Mr.\r\nMorley; and there was some very pretty play, Mr. Balfour retorting now\r\nand then with considerable skill and readiness. Altogether it was an\r\nexcellent fighting speech, and a good beginning. There were, in addition\r\nto what I have mentioned, plenty of shots about the foreign policy of\r\nthe Government, especially in Uganda and Egypt; and it is needless to\r\nsay that Mr. Balfour accused his successors of swallowing in office all\r\nthe principles they had professed in Opposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Old Man rises.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had to stand silent for a few minutes in face of the\r\nthunderous welcome which he received from the Irish benches. Though the\r\nreception was gratifying, he seemed to be impatiently awaiting its\r\ntermination, for he was full of vigour and eagerness for the attack, and\r\nnever in his most youthful hours did he display a greater readiness to\r\nmeet all assaults half-way. Those who are accustomed to the Old Man are\r\nin the habit of noting a few premonitory signs which will always pretty\r\nwell forecast the kind of speech he will make. If he starts up flurried\r\nand excited, it is ten chances to one that the speech will not remain\r\nvigorous to the end; that there will be a break of voice and a weakening\r\nof strength, and that the close will not be equal to the opening. But\r\nwhen the voice is cold--though full of a deep underswell at the moment\r\nof starting--when Mr. Gladstone moves his body with the easy grace of\r\nperfect self-mastery, then the House is going to have an oratorical\r\ntreat. So it was in this initial speech. There was just a touch of\r\nhoarseness in the voice, but it had a fine roll, the roll of the wave on\r\na pebbly beach in an autumn evening; and he carried himself so finely\r\nand so flauntingly that there was no apprehension of anything like a\r\nloss or a waste of strength.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A pounce.]\r\n\r\nAt once he pounced on a passage in the speech of Mr. Balfour, who had\r\nmade the statement that such a policy as Home Rule had always led to the\r\ndisintegration and destruction of empires. He rolled out the case of\r\nAustria, which had been preserved from ruin by Home Rule; and when there\r\nwas a sniff from the Tory benches, Mr. Gladstone, in tones of thunder,\r\nreferred to the speech of Lord Salisbury in 1885, when he was angling\r\nfor the Irish vote, and when he pointed to Austria as perhaps supplying\r\nsome indication of the method of settling the Irish question. This was\r\ngood old party warfare; the Liberals cheered in delight, and the old\r\nwarrior glowed with all his old fire. There was a softer and more\r\nsubdued tone when the Prime Minister referred to Foreign Affairs,\r\nspeaking of these things with the slowness and the gravity which such\r\nticklish subjects demand. But again Mr. Gladstone was in all the full\r\nblast of oratorical vehemence when he took up the attack that had been\r\nmade on the Irish policy of Mr. Morley. Now and then prompted by that\r\ngentleman, and with an occasional word from Mr. Asquith, the Old Man\r\ngave figure after figure to show that Ireland has vastly improved since\r\ncoercion had been dropped as a policy. Altogether it was a splendid\r\nfighting speech, and dissipated in a few moments all prophecies of gloom\r\nand forebodings of dark disaster which have been prevalent for so many\r\nweeks with regard to the health of the old leader. Thus in fire and fury\r\nbegan the Session, the leaders on both sides fully equal to their\r\nreputation and at their best, and all the dark and slumbering forces\r\nthat lie behind them as yet an undiscovered country of grim and strange\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Randolph.]\r\n\r\nBut the solid and united ranks of the Tories were broken by one figure\r\nthat was once the most potent among them all. I had been strangely moved\r\nat a theatre, a week or so before, as I looked at Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill. I remembered him twelve years ago--a mere boy in appearance,\r\nwith clean-shaven face, dapper and slight figure, the alertness and\r\ngrace of youth, and a face smooth as the cheek of a maiden. And\r\nnow--bearded, slightly bowed, with lines deep as the wrinkles of an\r\noctogenarian, he sometimes looks like the grandfather of his youthful\r\nself. It is in the deep-set, brilliant eyes that you still see all the\r\nfire of his extraordinary political genius, and the embers, that may\r\nquickly burst into flame, of all the passion and force of a violently\r\nstrong character. For the moment he sits silent and expectant. He has\r\neven refused to take his rightful place among the leaders of the party\r\non the Front Opposition Bench. Still he sits in the corner immediately\r\nbehind, which is the spectral throne of exiled rulers. He has the power\r\nof all strong natures of creating around him an atmosphere of\r\nuncertainty, apprehension, and fear. Of all the many problems of this\r\nSession of probably fierce personal conflict, this was the most\r\nunreadable sphinx.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction.]\r\n\r\nThere came upon the House at the beginning of the following week a\r\ndeadly calm, very much in contrast with the storm and stress of its\r\npredecessor. It is ever thus in the House of Commons. You can never tell\r\nhow things are going to turn out, except to this extent--that passion\r\ninevitably exhausts itself; and that accordingly, when there has been a\r\ngood deal of fire and fury one day, or for a few days, there is certain\r\nto come a great and deadly calm. Uganda is not a subject that excites\r\nanybody but Mr. Labouchere and Mr. Burdett-Coutts; and even on them it\r\nhas a disastrous effect. Mr. Burdett-Coutts is always dull; but Uganda\r\nmakes him duller than ever. Labby is usually brilliant; while he\r\ndiscoursed on Uganda he actually made people think Mr. Gladstone ought\r\nto have made him a Cabinet Minister--he displayed such undiscovered and\r\nunsuspected powers of respectable dulness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Still the seats.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was still room for excitement and drollery in the\r\nperennial question of the seats. Mr. Chamberlain is not a man to whom\r\npeople are inclined to make concessions; he is so little inclined to\r\ngive up anything himself; and, accordingly, there arose a very serious\r\nquestion as to the first seat on the third bench below the Gangway,\r\nwhich he had taken all defiantly for his own. He counted without one of\r\nthe oldest and most respected, but also one of the firmest, men in the\r\nHouse. Mr. T.B.--or, as everybody calls him, Tom Potter--sits for\r\nRochdale; he was the life-long friend, and for years he has been the\r\npolitical successor of Cobden in the representation of Rochdale, and he\r\nis likewise the founder and the President of the Cobden Club. Every man\r\nhas his weakness, and the weakness of Mr. Potter is to always occupy the\r\nfirst seat on the third bench above the Gangway. Everyone loves the\r\ngood, kindly old man, the survivor of some of the fiercest conflicts of\r\nour time, and everybody is willing to give way to him. When the Liberals\r\nwere in Opposition, there was a general desire among the Irish members\r\nto take possession of the third seat above the Gangway; and the first\r\nseat has enormous advantages--tactically--for anyone anxious to catch\r\nthe Speaker's eye. But whenever the sturdy form of the member for\r\nRochdale appeared, the fiercest of the Irishry were ready to give way;\r\nand from his coign of vantage, he beamed blissfully down on the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strong, but Merciful.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain had the boldness to challenge what hitherto had remained\r\nunchallenged; and Mr. Potter's wrath was aroused. He is not one of those\r\npeople who require the spiritual sustenance of the Chaplain's daily\r\nprayers; and, accordingly, it was an effort to get down at three\r\no'clock, when that ceremony begins; but his wrath upheld him; and thus\r\nit was that on a certain night, the thin form and sharp nose of Mr.\r\nChamberlain peered out on the House from behind the massive form of the\r\nMember for Rochdale. It looked as if the unhappy Member for West\r\nBirmingham had undergone a sort of transformation, and had, like Mr.\r\nAnstey's hero in \"Vice Versa,\" gone back to the tiny form and slight\r\nface of his boyhood. Mr. Potter, however, is merciful, and having\r\nasserted his rights, he surrendered them again gracefully to Mr.\r\nChamberlain; and the perky countenance of the gentleman from Birmingham\r\nonce more looked down from the heights of the third bench. It would take\r\nMr. Chamberlain a long time to do so graceful an act to anybody else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Ugander.\"]\r\n\r\nBut on the Monday night nobody need have been very particular as to what\r\nseat he occupied; for nothing could have been much more dull than the\r\nwhole proceedings. I make only one or two observations upon Uganda. And\r\nfirst, why is it that so few members of the House of Commons can\r\npronounce that word correctly? Mr. Chamberlain,--if there be anything\r\nilliterate to be done, he is always prominent in doing it--Mr.\r\nChamberlain never mentions the word without pronouncing it \"Ugand_er_.\"\r\nMr. Courtney for a long while did not venture on the word; and therein\r\nhe acted with prudence. It is a curious fact with regard to Mr. Courtney\r\nthat when he first came into the House he had a terrible difficulty with\r\nhis \"h's.\" In his case it was not want of culture, for he was a\r\nUniversity man, and one of the most accomplished and widely-read men in\r\nthe House of Commons. But still there it was; he was weak on his \"h's.\"\r\nHe has, however, by this time overcome the defect. Mr. Labouchere talks\r\nclassic English; was at a German university; has been in every part of\r\nthe world; has written miles of French memorandums; has sung serenades\r\nin Italian; and, if he were not so confoundedly lazy, would probably\r\nspeak more languages than any man in Parliament. But yet he cannot\r\npronounce either a final \"g\" or allow a word to end in a vowel without\r\nadding the ignoble, superfluous, and utterly brutal \"er.\" When he wishes\r\nto confound Mr. Gladstone, he assaults about \"Ugand_er_\"; when the\r\nconcerns of our great Eastern dependency move him to interest, he asks\r\nabout \"Indi_er_\"; and he speaks of the primordial accomplishments of man\r\nas \"readin'\" and \"writin'.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Edward Grey.]\r\n\r\nUgand_er_ gave Sir Edward Grey his first opportunity of speaking in his\r\nnew capacity of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. There are some men\r\nin the House of Commons whose profession is written in the legible\r\nlanguage of nature on every line of their faces. You could never,\r\nlooking at Mr. Haldane, for instance, be in doubt that he was an Equity\r\nbarrister, with a leaning towards the study of German philosophy and a\r\nhuman kindliness, dominated by a reflective system of economics. Mr.\r\nCarson--the late Solicitor-General for Ireland, and Mr. Balfour's chief\r\nchampion in the Coercion Courts--with a long hatchet face, a sallow\r\ncomplexion, high cheek-bones, cavernous cheeks and eyes--is the living\r\ntype of the sleuth-hound whose pursuit of the enemy of a Foreign\r\nGovernment makes the dock the antechamber to the prison or the gallows.\r\nSir Edward Grey, with his thin face, prominent Roman nose,\r\nextraordinarily calm expression, and pleasant, almost beautiful, voice,\r\nshows that the blood of legislators flows in his veins; he might stand\r\nfor the highest type of the young English official. He has not spoken\r\noften in the House of Commons--not often enough; but he is known on the\r\nplatform and at the Eighty Club. He has the perfect Parliamentary style,\r\nwith its virtues and defects, just as another young member of the\r\nHouse--Mr. E.J.C. Morton--has the perfect platform manner, also with\r\n_its_ virtues and defects. Sir Edward Grey speaks with grace, ease, with\r\nthat tendency to modest understatement, to the icy coldness of genteel\r\nconversation, which everybody will recognize as the House of Commons\r\nstyle. This means perfect correctness, especially in an official\r\nposition; but, on the other hand, it lacks warmth. It is only Mr.\r\nGladstone, perhaps, among the members of the House of Commons--old or\r\nnew--who has power of being at once, easy, calm, perfect in tone, and\r\nfull of the inspiring glow of oratory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pity the poor farmer.]\r\n\r\nThe agriculturists are not very happy in their representatives. A debate\r\non agriculture produces on the House the same effect as a debate on the\r\nArmy. It is well known that the party of all the Colonels is enough to\r\nmake any House empty; and a debate on agriculture is not much better.\r\nThe farmer's friends are always a dreadfully dull lot; and they usually\r\nlag some half-century behind the political knowledge of the rest of the\r\nworld. It would have been impossible for anybody but the county members\r\nto attempt a serious discussion on Protection or Bimetallism as cures\r\nfor all the evils of the flesh; but that is what the agricultural\r\nmembers succeeded in doing on a certain Monday and Tuesday night. Their\r\nprosings were perhaps welcome to the House; but it was a curious thing\r\nto see an assembly, as yet in its very infancy, so bored as to find\r\nrefuge in every part of the building, except the hall appropriated to\r\nits deliberations. Mr. Chaplin is always to the front on such occasions;\r\npompous, prolix, and ineffably dull. Mr. Herbert Gardner made his début\r\nas the Minister for Agriculture, and did it excellently.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keir-Hardie.]\r\n\r\nMr. Keir-Hardie is certainly one of the most curious forms which have\r\nyet appeared on the Parliamentary horizon. He wears a small cap--such as\r\nyou see on men when they are travelling; a short sack coat; a pair of\r\ntrousers of a somewhat wild and pronounced whiteish hue; and his beard\r\nis unkempt and almost conceals his entire face. The eyes are deep-set,\r\nrestless, grey--with strange lights as of fanaticism, or dreams. He\r\nrather pleasantly surprised the House by his style of speech. Something\r\nwild in a harsh shriek was what was looked for; but the wildest of\r\nScotchmen has the redeeming sense and canniness of his race--always\r\nexcepting Mr. Cunninghame Graham, whose Scotch blood was infused with a\r\nlarge mixture of the wild tribe of an Arab ancestress; and Mr.\r\nKeir-Hardie--speaking a good deal like Mr. T.W. Russell--made a foolish\r\nproposal in a somewhat rational speech. But he was unlucky in his\r\nbackers. The Liberal benches sate--dumb though attentive, and not\r\nunamiable. Mr. Gladstone gazed upon the new Parliamentary phenomenon\r\nwith interest, but the only voices that broke the silence of the\r\nreception were the strident tones of Mr. Howard Vincent, of Sheffield,\r\nand Mr. Johnston, of Ballykilbeg. Now Howard Vincent is known to all men\r\nas one of the people who speak in season and out of season, when once\r\nthey mount their hobby. The other day I heard of a bimetallist who was\r\nso fond of discussing bimetallism that the railway carriage, in which he\r\nwent to town every morning, was always left vacant for him; nobody could\r\nstand him any longer. Similar is the attitude of the House of Commons to\r\nHoward Vincent. Fair Trade is his craze. He proposes it at Tory\r\nConferences--much to the dismay of Tory wire-pullers; he gets it into\r\nthe most unlikely discussions in the House of Commons; and all the world\r\nlaughs at him as though he were to propose the restoration of slavery,\r\nor chaos come again. Poor Mr. Johnston only cares about the Pope, and\r\ncheers Mr. Hardie simply as a possible obstruction to Mr. Gladstone.\r\nIll-omened welcomes these for a friend of Labour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Gorst.]\r\n\r\nSir John Gorst occupies a curious position in his own party. He is one\r\nof their very ablest debaters; always speaks forcibly and to the point;\r\nrarely makes a mistake; and has a wonderfully good eye for the weak\r\npoints in the armoury of his opponents. He was the really strong man in\r\nthe old Fourth Party combination; but somehow or other he does not get\r\non with his friends, and has been left without Cabinet office at a time\r\nwhen many inferior men have been able to get ahead of him. He has a\r\ncold, cynical manner; suggests usually the clever lawyer rather than the\r\nsympathetic politician; and altogether seems at odds with the world and\r\nwith himself. He made a bold bid, however, for labour legislation;\r\nplaced himself in a different position from the rest of his colleagues;\r\nand altogether made one of those speeches which are listened to in\r\namused curiosity by political opponents, and in ominous silence and with\r\ndowncast looks by political friends. Mr. Balfour's face was a study; but\r\nit was a study in the impassibility which politicians cultivate when\r\nthey desire to conceal their hatred of a political friend. It is on the\r\nsame side of the House that the really violent and merciless animosities\r\nof the Parliamentary life prevail. I should think that Sir John Gorst is\r\nthe object of about as bitter a hatred among his own gang as any man in\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. George Wyndham.]\r\n\r\nIn the happily-ended coercion days, letters constantly appeared in the\r\nnewspapers, signed \"George Wyndham.\" A certain flippancy and cynicism of\r\ntone, joined to a skilful though school-boyish delight in dialectics,\r\nsuggested that though the name was George Wyndham, the writer was an\r\neminent chief. When at last Mr. George Wyndham made his appearance in\r\nthe House and delivered himself of his maiden speech, Mr.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman--one of the wittiest men in the House, though you\r\nwould take him for a very serious Scotchman without a joke in him, at\r\nfirst sight--expressed his satisfaction to find that there was such a\r\nperson as Mr. Wyndham, as he had been inclined to rank him with Mrs.\r\n'Arris and other mythical personages of whom history speaks. Mr. Wyndham\r\nis a tall, handsome, slight fellow--with an immense head of black hair,\r\nregular features, hatchet but well-shaped face, and a fine nose, Roman\r\nin size, Norman in aquilinity and haughtiness. He is a smart rather\r\nthan a clever man, but has plenty of vanity, ambition, and industry, and\r\nmay go far.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who said \"Rats\"?]\r\n\r\nMr. Jesse Collings has changed from a respectable Radical, with good\r\nintentions and excellent sentiments, into a carping, venomous,\r\nwrong-headed hater of Mr. Gladstone and all the proposals which come\r\nfrom a Liberal Government. On the 8th of February, he gave an extremely\r\nugly specimen of his malignant temper, by complaining that there was no\r\ncare for the agricultural labourer on the part of a Government which has\r\nundertaken the largest scheme of agricultural reform ever presented to a\r\nHouse of Commons. This had the effect of rousing the Old Man to one of\r\nthose devastating bits of scornful and quiet invective by which he\r\nsometimes delights the House of Commons. Jesse had spoken of the\r\nproposals of the Queen's Speech as a ridiculous mouse, and thereupon\r\ncame the dread retort that mice were not the only \"rodents\" that\r\ninfested ancient buildings; the words derived additional significance\r\nfrom the fact that, as he used them, the Prime Minister directed on\r\nJesse those luminous, large, searching eyes of his, with all their\r\ninfinite capacity for expressing passion, scorn, contempt, and disgust.\r\nThe House was not slow to catch the significance of the phrase, and\r\njumped at it, and yelled delightedly until the roof rang again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A tumble for Joe.]\r\n\r\nThis naturally called Joe, pliant creature, to the rescue of his beloved\r\nfriend. That, however, was far from a lucky week with Joe; he had begun\r\nto look positively hang-dog, with baffled hate. He attempted to stem the\r\nsplendid tide of enthusiasm on which the Grand Old Leader was swimming\r\ntriumphantly, by stating that at one time Mr. Gladstone had separated\r\nhimself from Mr. Collings's proposals for the reform of the position of\r\nthe agricultural labourers. When anybody makes a quotation against Mr.\r\nGladstone, the latter gentleman has a most awkward habit of asking for\r\nthe date, the authority, and such like posers to men of slatternly\r\nmemory, and doubtful accuracy. I have heard several of the wonderful Old\r\nMan's private secretaries declare that they had never been able to get\r\nover the dread with which this uncanny power of remembering everything\r\ninspired them--it was awe-inspiring, and produced a perpetual feeling of\r\nnervousness--as though they were in the presence of some extraordinary\r\nand incomprehensible great force of nature. It is rather unfortunate for\r\nJoe that nature did not endow him with any bump of veneration, and that\r\nhe is thus ready to embark on hazardous enterprises, in which he oftens\r\ncomes to grief. When he made this quotation against Mr. Gladstone, the\r\nOld Man at once pounced on him with a demand for the date and the\r\nauthority. Joe was nonplussed, but he stuck to his point.\r\n\r\nBut on the following day Mr. Gladstone got up and in the blandest manner\r\ndeclared that he had since looked into the speech to which Mr.\r\nChamberlain had alluded, and he found that what he had really said was,\r\nthat Mr. Collings had been supposed to have advocated \"three acres and a\r\ncow\" as a policy, and to that policy Mr. Gladstone had declared he had\r\nnever given his adherence. This was turning the tables with a vengeance.\r\nJesse grinned and Joe frowned--the rest of the House was delighted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Asquith.]\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary delivered a speech, which in one bound carried him to\r\nthe front rank of Ministerial speakers. It was a triumph from beginning\r\nto end: in voice, in delivery, in language--above all, in revelation of\r\ncharacter, it was an intoxication and a delight to the House of Commons.\r\nHe swept over the emotions of that assembly like a splendid piece of\r\nmusic, and there was no room, or time, for reflection.\r\n\r\nBut there was an aftermath, and then it began to be hinted that it was\r\nthe speech of an orator and an advocate rather than of a Minister, and\r\nthat it was unnecessarily and unwisely harsh in tone; it uttered \"no\"\r\nand a \"never\"--which are the tombs of so many Ministerial declarations.\r\nThe occasion was the motion of Mr. Redmond in reference to the release\r\nof the dynamitards. Mr. McCarthy, though he strongly disapproved of the\r\nmotion, was forced to express regret that Mr. Asquith had closed the\r\nprison doors with a \"bang;\" and one or two of the supporters and friends\r\nof Mr. Asquith were also compelled to express their dissent, and to vote\r\nin the lobby against him. But undoubtedly that speech has immensely\r\nincreased Mr. Asquith's reputation and strengthens his position. He is\r\none of the strong and great men of the immediate future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obstruction, naked and unashamed.]\r\n\r\nWhen the debate on amnesty was concluded, there came a climax to that\r\nsystem of obstruction in which the Tories and the Unionists indulged\r\nduring the first fortnight; and there was indication of the growing\r\nexasperation of the Ministerial and the Irish members. Midnight had\r\nstruck; and Mr. Balfour, on the part of the Tories, had the face to\r\ndeclare that it was impossible, at such a late hour, to do justice to\r\nthe next amendment. As the next amendment dealt with the Gweedore\r\nprisoners, and as the House has heard of little else but the Gweedore\r\nprisoners for the last fortnight, the majority received this\r\nannouncement with a fierce outburst of impatience, the Irish Bench\r\nespecially being delighted at the opportunity of paying back to Mr.\r\nBalfour some of the insults he had poured on them so freely during his\r\nsix years of power. Meantime, the Liberal temper had been roused to\r\nstill more feverish heat by the splendid news from Halifax, followed by\r\nthe even more unexpectedly good tidings from Walsall; and there was a\r\ndetermination to stand no nonsense. But Obstruction was determined to go\r\non, and when it was two o'clock in the morning Sir William Harcourt\r\ndeclared that he would not persevere further. There arose a fierce shout\r\nof disappointment from his supporters and from the Irishry; but Sir\r\nWilliam beamed pleasantly, and the majority submitted to the tyranny of\r\nthe minority. And thus debating impracticable proposals, barely\r\nlistening to long speeches, doing absolutely nothing, the days\r\nsucceeded each other; and legislators who wanted work, longed for the\r\nsteady and mechanical regularity of their well-ordered offices, their\r\nvast factories, their sanely-conducted communications with all parts of\r\nthe world, to which English genius, sense, and industry have brought the\r\ngoods of England. The contrast between the Englishman at business and at\r\npolitics is exasperating, woeful, tragic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME RULE BILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I remember.]\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Mr. Gladstone take his seat in the House of Commons on\r\nFebruary 13th, I was irresistibly reminded of two scenes in my memory.\r\nOne took place in Cork some twelve years ago. Mr. Parnell had made his\r\nentry into the city, and the occasion was one of a triumph such as an\r\nEmperor might have envied. The streets were impassable with crowds;\r\nevery window had its full contingent; the people had got on the roofs.\r\nIt almost seemed, as one of Mr. Parnell's friends and supporters\r\ndeclared, as if every brick were a human face. Men shouted themselves\r\nhoarse; young women waved their handkerchiefs till their arms must have\r\nached; old women rushed down before the horses of the great Leader's\r\ncarriage, and kissed the dust over which he passed. And, then, when it\r\nwas all over, Mr. Parnell had to sit in a small room, listening to the\r\ncomplaints and most inconvenient cross-questionings of an extremely\r\npragmatical supporter, who would have been an affliction to any man from\r\nthe intensity and tenacity of his powers of boring. As I looked at poor\r\nParnell, with that deprecatory smile of his which so often lit up the\r\nflint-like hardness, the terrible resolution of his face--as varied in\r\nits lights and shadows as a lake under an April sky--I thought of the\r\ncontrast there was between the small annoyances, the squalid cares of\r\neven the greatest leaders of men and the brave outward show of their\r\nreception by the masses. And the other scene of which I thought, was the\r\nappearance of Mr. Irving on a first night in some big play, say, like\r\n\"Lear.\" All the public know is that the actor is there, on the stage, to\r\npronounce his kingly speech; but, before he has got there, Mr. Irving,\r\nperhaps, has had the sleepless nights which are required in thinking out\r\nthe smallest details of his business; perchance, the second before he\r\nlooks down on that wild pit, and up at that huge gallery, which are\r\nready either to acclaim or devour him, he has been in the midst of a\r\nfurious dispute about the price of tallow candles, or the delinquencies\r\nof the property-master.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tired eyelids upon tired eyes.]\r\n\r\nSo I thought, as I looked on Mr. Gladstone. For there was that in his\r\nface to suggest sleepless vigils, hard-fought fights--perhaps, small and\r\nirritating worries. Before that great moment, there had been\r\nconsultations, negotiations, Cabinet Councils--perchance, long and not\r\neasy discussion of details, settlement of differences, composure of all\r\nthose personal frictions and collisions which are inevitable in the\r\ntreadmill of political life. Yes; it was the case of the actor-manager\r\nwith the thousand and one details of outside work to attend to, as well\r\nas the great and swelling piece of magnificent work for which the great\r\noutside world alone cared--of which it alone knew. To anybody who knows\r\npolitics from the inside comes ever some such haunting thought about the\r\nsplendour and glory of popular receptions and public appearances. I must\r\nconfess that I could not get rid of that impression when I looked on Mr.\r\nGladstone on that Monday night. A deadlier pallor than usual had settled\r\non that face which always has all the beautiful shade, as well as the\r\nfine texture of smooth ivory. There was a drawn, wearied look about the\r\nusually large, open, brilliant eyes--that rapt and far-off gaze which is\r\nalways Mr. Gladstone's expression when his mind and heart are full.\r\nThere are two kinds of excitement and excitability. The man who bursts\r\ninto laughter, or shouts, or tears, suffers less from his overstrained\r\nnerves than he whose face is placid while within are mingled all the\r\nrage, and terror, and tumult of great thoughts, and passions, and hopes.\r\nIt struck me that Mr. Gladstone was the victim of suppressed excitement\r\nand overstrained nerves, and that it was only the splendid masculine\r\nwill, the great strength of his fine physique, which kept him up so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sudden awakening.]\r\n\r\nPallid, heavy-eyed, in a far-off dream--with all the world gazing upon\r\nhim with painful concentration of attention and fixed stare--the Great\r\nOld Man sate, keeper still of the greatest and most momentous secret of\r\nhis time, and about to make an appearance more historic, far-reaching,\r\nimmortal, than any yet in his career. So, doubtless, he would have liked\r\nto remain for a long time still; but, with a start, he woke up, put his\r\nhands to his ear, as is his wont in these latter days when his hearing\r\nis not what it used to be, looked to the Speaker, and then to Mr. John\r\nMorley, and found that, all at once, without one moment's preparation,\r\nhe had been called upon by the Speaker to enter on his great and\r\nperilous task. What had happened was this: The Irish members had put a\r\nnumber of questions on the notice-paper, but, anxious in every way to\r\nspare the Old Man, they quietly left the questions unasked; and so,\r\nwhen, as he thought, there was still a whole lot of preliminary business\r\nto go through, all was over, and the way was quite clear for his start.\r\n\"The First Lord of the Treasury;\" so spoke the Speaker--almost\r\nsoftly--and, in a moment, when he had realized what had taken place, the\r\nOld Man was upright, and the Liberal and Irish members were on their\r\nfeet, waving their hats, cheering themselves hoarse. And yet an\r\nundercurrent and audible note of anxiety ran through all the enthusiasm.\r\nThe honeymoon of Home Rule is over, and, curiously enough, the very\r\nsense of a great victory after a long struggle has always about it a\r\nsolemnity too sad for tears, too deep for joy. The Liberals and the\r\nIrishry stood up; but, even at that hour, there were evidences of the\r\nfissures and chasms which the two great political disruptions-the\r\ndisruption in the English Liberal and in the Irish party--have produced.\r\nOn the third bench below the Gangway sate the Liberal Unionists, Mr.\r\nGladstone's deadliest foes, with pallid-faced, perky-nosed, malignant\r\nChamberlain at their head, the face distorted by the baffled hate, the\r\naccumulated venom of all these years of failure, apostasy, and outlawry.\r\nNot one of the renegade Liberals stood up, and there they sate, a solid\r\nmass of hatred and rancour. On the Irish side, Mr. Redmond and the few\r\nParnellites kept up the tradition of their dead leader in his last years\r\nof distrust and dislike of Mr. Gladstone by also remaining seated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The speech.]\r\n\r\nThe first notes of the Old Man suggested he was in excellent form. It is\r\nalways easy for those who are well acquainted with him to know when the\r\nOld Man is going to make a great, and when he will deliver only a\r\nmoderately good speech. If he is going to do splendidly the tone at the\r\nstart is very calm, the delivery is measured, the sentences are long,\r\nand break on the ear with something of the long-drawn-out slowness of\r\nthe Alexandrine. So it was on this occasion. Sentence followed sentence\r\nin measured and perfect cadence; with absolute self-possession; and in a\r\nvoice not unduly pitched. And yet there were those traces of fatigue to\r\nwhich I have alluded, and I have since heard that one of the few\r\noccasions in his life when Mr. Gladstone had a sleepless night was on\r\nthe night before he introduced his second great Home Rule Bill. And it\r\nshould be added that, stirring and eloquent as were the opening\r\nsentences, they were not listened to by the House with that\r\nextraordinary enthusiasm which, on other occasions, sentences of this\r\nsplendid eloquence would have elicited. For what really the House wanted\r\nto learn was the great enigma which had been kept for seven long\r\nyears--in spite of protests, hypocritical appeals, and, ofttimes,\r\ntedious remonstrance from over-zealous and over-fussy friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bill.]\r\n\r\nBy the time Mr. Gladstone had got to the Bill, he had exhausted a good\r\ndeal of his stock of voice, and yet he seemed to be less dependent than\r\nusual on the mysterious compound which Mrs. Gladstone mixes with her own\r\nwifely hand for those solemn occasions. It appeared that both she and\r\nher husband had somewhat dreaded the ordeal. The bottle which Mr.\r\nGladstone usually brings with him is about the size of those small,\r\nstunted little jars in which, in the days of our youth, the young buck\r\nkept his bear's grease, or other ornament of the toilet. But on Monday\r\nMr. Gladstone was armed with a large blue bottle--somewhat like one of\r\nthose 8 oz. medicine bottles which stand so often beside our beds in\r\nthis age of sleeplessness and worry. Nevertheless, Mr. Gladstone and his\r\nwife had miscalculated, for on two occasions only throughout the entire\r\nspeech did he have to make application for sustenance to the medicine\r\nbottle. Another precaution which had been taken turned out also to be\r\nunnecessary. The Premier's eyesight is not as good as it was a few years\r\nago; and he sometimes finds it difficult to read anything but the\r\nbiggest print. For this reason, elaborate preparations had been made for\r\nhelping his eyesight. On the table before the Speaker's chair there was\r\na small lamp--somewhat like a student's lamp. This also turned out to be\r\nunnecessary, for the Old Man was able to read his notes without the\r\nsmallest difficulty; and the speech had come to a conclusion long before\r\nthe hour when the deepening shadows make it hard to read by the light\r\nfrom the glass roof of the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The peroration.]\r\n\r\nAt last, the latest details had been given; the Old Man approached his\r\nperoration. By this time the voice had sunk in parts to a low whisper,\r\nand the deathly hue of the beautiful face had grown deeper. There was\r\nsomething that almost inspired awe as one looked at that strange,\r\ncurious, solitary figure in the growing darkness. The intense strain on\r\nthe House had finally exhausted it, and there had come a silence that\r\nhad in it the solemnity, the strange stillness, the rapt emotion of\r\nsome sublime service in a great cathedral rather than the beginning of\r\none of the fiercest and most rancorous party conflicts of our time. To\r\nthis mood Mr. Gladstone attuned the closing words of his speech. The\r\nwords came slowly, quietly, gently, sinking at times almost to a\r\nwhisper. What fantasies could not one's mind play as one listened to\r\nthese words. There was underneath the language, the looks, the voice,\r\nthe tragic thought that this was a message rather from the shadow-land\r\nbeyond the grave than from this rough, noisy, material world. Imagine\r\nyourself in a country church, the sole visitor in the ghostly silence\r\nand the solemn twilight, with spectres all around you in the memorials\r\nof the dead and memories of the living, and then fancy the organist\r\nsilently stealing, also alone, to the organ, and giving out to the\r\nevening air some beautifully solemn anthem with all the sadness of\r\ndeath, and none of the exultant joy of resurrection, and then you will\r\nget some faint idea of the pent-up emotion which filled every\r\nsympathetic heart in the great assembly as the Old Man finally came to\r\nthe closing words of his great speech. It was not so much a peroration\r\nas an appeal, a message, a benediction.\r\n\r\nAt first, when the Old Man sat down, the pause followed that speaks of\r\nemotion too deep for prompt expression, and then once again a rush to\r\ntheir feet by the Irishry and the Liberals, loud cheering, and the\r\nwaving of hats, and all those other manifestations of vehement feeling\r\nwhich alone Mr. Gladstone is privileged to receive. The Tories had kept\r\nvery quiet; had conducted themselves on the whole very well. Once or\r\ntwice came a high sniff of disgust, and now and then a younger member\r\ncould not restrain himself from an exclamation. But, altogether, the\r\nOpposition was under the same spell as the rest of the House, and\r\nlistened patiently to the end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton.]\r\n\r\nI may pass over all that occurred on that Monday evening, with the\r\nsingle exception of the very remarkable speech of Mr. Sexton. It was\r\nwell known that Mr. Sexton had taken a prominent part in laying before\r\nMr. Gladstone and his colleagues the views of the Irish party as to what\r\nwould constitute a satisfactory Bill to the Irish people; and Mr. Sexton\r\nwas authorised by his colleagues to state their views to the House. This\r\nhe did slowly, deliberately, without the least attempt at oratory, but\r\nin language extraordinarily lucid, delicately shaded, touching on points\r\nwith exquisite art. And what he said came to this; that the Bill was a\r\ngood Bill; that in his opinion it could be accepted by the Irish people\r\nas a satisfactory settlement of their demands; but that in two points it\r\nneeded careful watching, and perhaps considerable amendment: the\r\nfinancial settlement and the future of the Land Question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Balfour.]\r\n\r\nThe Leader of the Opposition had not, so far, shone in his new position,\r\nand people were not slow in coming to the conclusion that he required\r\nthe stimulus and the strength of a solid majority behind him to bring\r\nout his peculiar talents. At all events, his first speech following the\r\nintroduction of the Home Rule Bill was a ghastly failure. It was\r\nlistened to in almost unbroken silence from the beginning to the\r\nend--not that the speech had not plenty of cleverness in it, the small\r\ncleverness of small points--but it was badly delivered. It did not seem\r\nto rise to the heights expected on such an occasion; in short, it was a\r\ndisappointment. Only once or twice did the Leader of the Opposition\r\nsucceed in rousing his friends to even an approach to enthusiasm.\r\nSpeaking of the amount of money put to the credit of Ireland, he\r\ndeclared the Government admitted they had been beaten in a conflict with\r\nthe forces of law and order, and that this was the war indemnity which\r\nhad to be paid--a hit that very much delighted Mr. Chamberlain. The\r\nportion of the speech which created sensation was that in which he\r\nalluded to the use of the veto. It had been contended by Mr. Sexton that\r\nthe veto would never be used unless the Irish Parliament so abused its\r\npowers as to justify the use of it. This was an honourable bargain\r\nbetween the British Parliament and the Irish. To such a bargain Mr.\r\nBalfour declared he and his friends would be no parties. They would not\r\nlet the weapon of veto rust in case it were put into their hands, and so\r\non--a passage which excited some enthusiasm on the Tory benches and\r\nstrong anger on the Irish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Bryce.]\r\n\r\nThe real framers of the Bill are understood to be Mr. Gladstone, Mr.\r\nMorley, and Mr. Bryce. No man in the House of Commons has so complete a\r\nknowledge as Mr. Bryce of the various forms of government in the world,\r\nespecially in countries which have the complicated system that is about\r\nto be fashioned under the new Bill. Mr. Bryce is a professor and a\r\nstudent, and he has the manner of his calling and his pursuits. Arguing\r\nhis case without passion, slowly, calmly, in excellently chosen\r\nlanguage, he can speak on even the most violently contested measure as\r\nthough it were a demonstration in anatomy. So he spoke on February\r\n14th--making mince-meat with deadly tranquillity of manner of most of\r\nthe objections of Mr. Balfour, and altogether strengthening the position\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Redmond.]\r\n\r\nA speech which had been looked forward to with even greater curiosity\r\nwas that of Mr. Redmond, the leader of the Parnellites. The Tories had\r\nsettled themselves down in large numbers, counting on a great treat. And\r\nundoubtedly the opening of Mr. Redmond's speech was not auspicious. He\r\nthought that some recognition should have been given to the great dead\r\nIrishman as well as to the living Englishman who had brought the Home\r\nRule question to its present position. The delighted Tories, not loving\r\nMr. Parnell, but seeing in this the promise of a lively and unpleasant\r\nattack on the Bill, cheered lustily, and speeded Mr. Redmond on his way\r\non the full tide of a splendid reception. But as time went on, their\r\nfaces gradually grew longer, and when Mr. Redmond resumed his seat they\r\nhad come to the conclusion that one of the strongest foundations on\r\nwhich they had built their hopes for wrecking the Bill had entirely\r\ngone. Summed up, what Mr. Redmond had to say came to this: that he saw\r\nmany grave defects in the Bill; that he was especially dissatisfied with\r\nthe financial arrangements; that he didn't approve of the retention of\r\nthe Irish members in the Imperial Parliament; but that, nevertheless, it\r\nwas a Bill to which he could give a general support. This speech was\r\nreceived with great though silent satisfaction on all the Irish benches;\r\nbut the poor Tories were brought to a condition well nigh of despair.\r\nAnd thus, cheered heartily by both Irish sections and enthusiastically\r\ngreeted by the Liberals, weakly fought, feebly criticised by the\r\nOpposition the Bill started splendidly on its perilous way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA SOBER AND SUBDUED OPPOSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always held that the present Government would first begin to fix\r\nits hold upon the country when it was face to face with Parliament. It\r\nwas, during the vacation, like a great firm that is expected by\r\neverybody to do a vast amount of business, but that has been unduly and\r\nunexpectedly delayed in building its works. A visit to the House of\r\nCommons during the week ending February 24th would have exemplified what\r\nI say. It is true there would have been missed all the intense fury and\r\nexcitement which characterised one of the most exciting and interesting\r\nweeks the House of Commons has seen for many a day. There was a calm,\r\nthe deadliness of which it is impossible to exaggerate. But periods of\r\ncalm are much more interesting to Governments than to the public. When\r\nthere are the noise and tumult of battle; when the galleries are\r\ncrowded--when peers jostle each other in the race for seats--when the\r\nPrince of Wales comes down to his place over the clock, then you may\r\ntake it for granted that the business of the country is at a standstill;\r\nand that just so much of the public time is being wasted in mere\r\nemptiness and talk. But when the House is half empty--when the galleries\r\nare no longer full--when debates are brief and passionless, then you can\r\nreasonably conclude that things are going well with the Government; that\r\nuseful business is in progress; and that something is being really added\r\nto the happiness of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The humbled Opposition.]\r\n\r\nSo it was during the second week of the Home Rule Session. No great\r\ndiplomats claimed their seats; the outer lobby was no longer besieged;\r\nthere was no longer any ferocity of competition for seats; and the\r\nattendance at prayers visibly relaxed; but all the time more useful\r\nlegislation was initiated in the course of the week than in any similar\r\nperiod for upwards of six or seven years of Parliamentary time. A good\r\ndeal of the progress is due to the sober and subdued spirit of the\r\nOpposition. So long as Mr. Balfour was in power, the more democratic\r\nsection of the Tory party was kept comparatively under; but with his\r\nfall came an outburst of freedom; and men like Sir Albert Rollit, who\r\nrepresent great constituencies, have been able to freely express their\r\nreal opinions. Let me pause for a moment on Sir Albert Rollit, to say\r\nthat he is a very remarkable type to those who have known the House of\r\nCommons for a number of years--as I have. It is rather hard to make a\r\ndistinction between him and a moderate, and in some respects, even an\r\nadvanced Liberal. He boasts, and rightly, that he represents as many\r\nworking men as most of his Radical colleagues; and he certainly does sit\r\nfor a place which is not inhabited by any large number of wealthy\r\npeople. Disraeli, with his Household Suffrage; Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\nwith his Tory Democracy, have brought this type of politician into\r\nexistence, and now he is with us always. This is the answer to those who\r\ncontend that because there will be always Tories and Whigs, it makes no\r\ndifference what changes we make. The answer is Sir Albert Rollit; he is\r\na Tory, but the Tory of to-day is pretty much the same as the Radical of\r\na few years ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Registration Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe Government brought forward the first of their Bills, and at once the\r\nTory Democrat showed what he was. For Mr. Fowler was able to quote\r\nopinions from Tories quite as favourable to reform of registration as\r\nfrom Radicals, and several Tories stood up to speak in favour of the\r\nmeasure. Opposition was really left to poor Mr. Webster, of St. Pancras;\r\nbut, then, everybody knew what poor Mr. Webster meant, and nothing could\r\nbetter express the lowliness of the Tory party than that opposition to\r\nanything should be led by the hapless representative of St. Pancras. The\r\nconsequence of all this was that the Registration Bill passed in the\r\ncourse of a few hours--the debate illumined by an excellent maiden\r\nspeech from our John Burns--delivered in that fine, manly, deep voice of\r\nhis--which always makes me think of a skipper on the hurricane deck in\r\nthe midst of rolling seas and a crashing storm. Even a few briefer\r\nmoments sufficed for the Scotch Registration Bill; and the House of\r\nCommons almost rubbed its eyes in astonishment to find that it had\r\nactually got through two great Bills and was about to listen to a third\r\nin the course of one evening.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Employer's Liability.]\r\n\r\nBut so it was; and there verily stood Mr. Asquith at the box in front of\r\nthe Speaker's chair introducing the third great Bill of the Government\r\nin the same evening. Mr. Asquith's grasp of Parliamentary method\r\nincreases daily. He is really a born Parliamentarian. It is certain that\r\nhe has made up his mind to go back to the bar when his time for retiring\r\nfrom office comes; it will be a tremendous pity if he does. Such a man\r\nis wasted before juries and in the pettiness of nisi prius. For the\r\nmoment, however, he sails before the wind. With his youthful--almost\r\nboyish face--clean-shaven, fair and fresh--with his light brown hair\r\ncarefully combed, school-boy fashion, and with no more trace of white\r\nthan if he were playing football in a school gymnasium--he is a\r\nwonderful example of early and precocious political fortune. There is in\r\nhis face a certain cheery cynicism--a combination of self-confidence and\r\nperhaps of self-mockery, the attitude of most clear-sighted men towards\r\nfortune, even when she is most smiling. At the outset Mr. Asquith had to\r\nencounter an amendment from Mr. Chamberlain. It is needless to say that,\r\nwhile the most Radical Government which ever existed is proposing\r\nRadical legislation, the cue of Mr. Chamberlain will be now and then to\r\n\"go one better\"--to use the American phrase; and accordingly here was an\r\namendment from Birmingham which went even further than the Bill of Mr.\r\nAsquith. With gentle but effective ridicule Mr. Asquith, riddled the\r\nChamberlain amendment; but for the moment the amendment served the\r\npurpose of delaying further progress with the Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another surprise.]\r\n\r\nAnd there was another surprise--actually a fourth Bill--also from the\r\nGovernment Bench; and also proposing to make a further beneficial change\r\nin the position of working men. Mr. Mundella wanted to get power for the\r\nBoard of Trade to regulate the hours of labour among poor railway men.\r\nSir Michael Hicks-Beach--who burnt his fingers over Stationmaster\r\nHood--rushed up after Mr. Mundella had sate down--to claim a portion of\r\nthe credit for this beneficial change. Here, again, the Opposition\r\nshowed that meekness which has come over its temper. For six years the\r\nTories were in office, but there was no Bill. The moment he was out, Sir\r\nMichael was full of the best intentions. But his attempt to get credit\r\nfor other men's work was vain; for he counted without Mr. Bartley--the\r\ngentleman whom North Islington sends to Parliament for the purpose of\r\nimpeding all useful legislation. And that Bill also was delayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The government and private members.]\r\n\r\nThere is always something foredoomed about a night which ends in a\r\ncount-out. You can almost feel its untimely end in the air at the very\r\nbeginning of the sitting. There is always a great to-do about doing away\r\nwith the privileges of the private member, but I have never really seen\r\nanything like a strong desire on the part of the House generally to keep\r\nthe small quorum together which is necessary for giving the private\r\nmember his opportunity. To the uninitiated, it is perhaps necessary to\r\nsay that the sittings of the House are divided into two classes--what\r\nare called Government and what are called private members' nights.\r\nGovernment nights are Mondays and Thursdays. On these days, the\r\nGovernment is entirely master of the time of the House. They can bring\r\non Government Bills and in whatever order they please. On Tuesdays and\r\non Wednesdays the private member is master of the situation--that is to\r\nsay, until the Government of the day get leave of the House to take all\r\nits time, and then the rights of private members disappear. On Fridays\r\nalso the private member is in possession of most of the time of the\r\nsitting. That is the night on which the Government sets up Supply--that\r\nis to say, puts down the votes for the money required for the public\r\nservice. It is a fundamental principle of the British Constitution that\r\nthe demand for money involves the right to raise any grievance; and\r\naccordingly Supply on Friday night is always preceded by motions in\r\nreference to any subject which any member may desire to raise. These\r\nmotions are put on the paper, but so inherent is the right to raise any\r\ngrievance before giving money, that a member is entitled to get up, and\r\nwithout a moment's notice, raise any question which may appear to him\r\ndesirable for discussion. As a rule, however, there is but one question\r\nfought out, and when that is decided the Government of the day is\r\nallowed to go on to the votes for money.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliamentary Wednesdays.]\r\n\r\nWednesday is nearly always occupied with some Bill brought in by a\r\nprivate member, in which a large number of other members are interested.\r\nIt used to be said that Wednesday was sacred to the churches and the\r\nchapels, and that only a religious debate could take place. This is\r\nstill the case to a large extent; for instance, on Wednesday, February\r\n22nd, they employed themselves at the House in discussing a Bill in\r\nwhich Dissenters are very much interested. Then, a division has to be\r\ntaken at half-past five, and thus there is a good chance of a practical\r\ndiscussion with a practical result. The consequence is that Wednesday\r\nsittings are always looked forward to with a considerable interest, and\r\nit is always with a pang that the House gives up the right of the\r\nprivate member to them. A Wednesday sitting is rarely, if ever, counted\r\nout, and, indeed, I believe there is a rule which prevents them from\r\nbeing counted out before four o'clock, at which hour the late-comers\r\nfind it possible to turn up. Friday sittings also rarely, if ever, end\r\nbadly, for the Government is ever in want of money, and a Government has\r\nalways forty staunch supporters who are ready to stay in the House in\r\norder to help it to get through its business. But Tuesday belongs to no\r\nman in particular. The Government don't bother themselves about it,\r\nbecause they don't have money to get at the end of it: instead of its\r\nbeing occupied with one Bill, which can raise a definite discussion,\r\nTuesday has a number of motions on all sorts and kinds of subjects; and,\r\nin short, what's everybody's business is nobody's; and Tuesday\r\nconstantly ends about eight or half-past eight o'clock in a count-out.\r\nThe Government delightedly look on; it is an additional argument in\r\nfavour of taking away the rights and privileges of private members and\r\nturning them into the voracious maw of the Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wales in a rage.]\r\n\r\nA curious difference presented itself between the interior and the\r\nexterior of the House on the following day (February 23rd). Inside,\r\nthere was for the most part a desert, yawning wide and drear, except on\r\nthe benches which were occupied by the sons of Wales; while outside in\r\nthe outer lobbies surged a wild, tumultuous, excited crowd, eagerly\r\ndemanding admission from everybody who could be expected to have the\r\nleast chance of giving it. Every Welshman in the world seemed to have\r\ngot there. I saw Mr. Ellis Griffiths--an impassioned and brilliant Welsh\r\norator who ought to be in the House; my friend, whom I used to know as\r\nHowell Williams, and I now have to call Mr. \"Idris,\" as if he were an\r\nembodied mineral water, and many others. The secret was that the night\r\nwas devoted to the Suspensory Bill for the Established Church in Wales,\r\nand anybody who knows Welshmen, will know that this is a question on\r\nwhich Welsh blood incontinently boils over. Terse, emphatic,\r\nbusiness-like Mr. Asquith put the case for Disestablishment on the plain\r\nand simple ground that the Established Church was the church of the rich\r\nminority, and that the overwhelming majority of the Welsh representation\r\nhad been returned over and over again to demand Disestablishment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cynical Gorst.]\r\n\r\nSir John Gorst has an icy manner and generally the air of a man who has\r\nnot found the world especially pleasant, and delights to take rather a\r\npessimistic view of things. His great argument was that if this Bill\r\nwere carried, young men would not find enough of coin to tempt them into\r\nthe Church, and that accordingly it would languish and fade away. To\r\nsuch a prosaic view of the highest spiritual vocation, the unhappy\r\nTories listened with ill-concealed vexation, and Gorst once more\r\nincreased that distrust of his sincerity in Toryism which perhaps\r\naccounts for the small progress he has made in the ranks of his party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Randolph again.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the night the debate languished, though there was an\r\nexcellent speech from Mr. Stuart Rendel on behalf of the Welsh party.\r\nThis was practically the only speech from that side; for perceiving that\r\nthe game of the Tories was to talk against time, the Welshmen wisely\r\ndeclined to aid them, and sate dumb, unless when they snorted defiance\r\nat some absurd claim or fanciful exaggeration on the other side. At ten\r\nminutes past ten, however, quite a different complexion was given to the\r\nwhole debate by the rise of Lord Randolph Churchill. He had not yet\r\nrecovered his old mastery of himself or the House; but his appearance\r\nwas very different from what it was a few nights earlier. There was no\r\nlonger that constant trembling of the hands which made it almost painful\r\nto look at him; the voice did not shake painfully, and there was a\r\ncertain recurrence of that old self-confidence. But still he was far\r\nfrom what he used to be. The once resonant voice was somewhat muffled\r\nand hoarse, accompanied by a certain tendency to feverish exaggeration\r\nof language--in fact, the old Fourth Party methods of almost conscious\r\nplaying to the gallery. However, it was a good fighting speech, and the\r\nTories had been so depressed by the bad speaking on their own side, and\r\nby the solid bench opposite of cheering, snorting, defiant, but\r\ndistinctly practical Welshmen, that they were delighted, and cheered\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Olympian wrath.]\r\n\r\nThe intimates of Mr. Gladstone declare that composure is perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable of his many qualities. In the midst of a Cabinet crisis\r\nhe would hand you a postage-stamp as though it were the sole matter that\r\nconcerned him. But it is also said by his intimates that he has\r\npossibilities of Olympian wrath which almost frighten people. He was\r\ncertainly roused to a passion by Lord Randolph--very much to the\r\nadvantage and delight of the House of Commons; for during the earlier\r\nportion of the evening, and especially while the speech of Mr. Asquith\r\nwas being delivered, there was an impression that he did not look very\r\nhappy. It is known that he is still fondly devoted to the Church, and it\r\nwas suspected that though his convictions were settled on the necessity\r\nof doing away with the Establishment in Wales, it was not the kind of\r\nwork to which he went with any zest. But Lord Randolph roused the Old\r\nLion within him, and with flashing eye, with a voice the resonance of\r\nwhich echoed through the House as though he were twenty years\r\nyounger--with abundance of gesticulation, and sometimes with swinging\r\nblows that were almost cruel--he slew the young intruder and wound up\r\nthe debate on the Church in a frenzy of excitement and delight among his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Kenyon.]\r\n\r\nThere came, then, a series of incidents which threw the House into\r\nconvulsions of rancorous scorn and farcical laughter. Earlier in the\r\nevening there had been a speech by Mr. Kenyon. Words fail to describe\r\nthe kind of speech Mr. Kenyon delivers. Sometimes one is doubtful as to\r\nthe sex of the speaker, for he moans out his lamentations over \"the dear\r\nold Church of England\" exactly as one would imagine a sweet old lady\r\nwith a gingham umbrella and a widow's cap to intone it. Meantime, the\r\nrest of the House is convulsed with laughter, so that there is the\r\ncurious contrast of one man--Punch-like in complexion and face--reciting\r\na dirge while the rest of the House are holding their universal sides\r\nwith laughter. The anger came when Sir Henry James and Mr. T.W. Russell\r\nwere seen to be fluctuating between the Liberal and the Tory lobby. Joe\r\nwisely found a convenient engagement at Birmingham. At last Toryism\r\nprevailed, and amid a tempest of ironical cheers, the Liberal renegades\r\nwent into the Tory lobby.\r\n\r\nThen the Tories were beaten by a majority of 56, after which they tried\r\na little obstruction. But it was promptly sat upon; the closure was\r\nmoved; only the solitary and plaintive voice of Mr. Kenyon rose in\r\nprotest against it, and so, amid shouts of laughter and triumph, the\r\ndoom of the Welsh Establishment was pronounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONAL ELEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Small jealousies and great questions.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the delights of Parliamentary life that you can never be\r\nsure of what is going to take place. The strongest of all possible\r\nGovernments may be threatened, and even destroyed, in the course of a\r\nsunny afternoon, which has begun in gaiety and brightest hope; a\r\nreputation may grow or be destroyed in an hour; and an intrigue may\r\nburst upon the assembly in a moment, which has been slowly germinating\r\nfor many weeks. Mr. Gladstone had a notice upon the paper on Monday,\r\nFebruary 27th, the effect of which was to demand for the Government most\r\nof the time which ordinarily belongs to the private member. There is no\r\nnotice which has more hidden or treacherous depths and cross-currents.\r\nFor when you interfere with the private member, you suddenly come in\r\ncollision with a vast number of personal vanities, and when you touch\r\nanything in the shape of personal vanity in politics you have got into a\r\nhornet's nest, the multitudinousness, the pettiness, the malignity, the\r\nunexpectedness of which you can never appreciate. I sometimes gaze upon\r\nthe House of Commons in a certain semi-detached spirit, and I ask myself\r\nif there be any place in the whole world where you can see so much of\r\nthe mean as well as of the loftiest passions of human nature as in a\r\nlegislative assembly. Look at these men sitting on the same bench and\r\nmembers of the same party--perhaps even with exactly the same great\r\npurpose to carry out in public policy, and neither really in the least\r\ndishonest nor insincere. They are talking in the most amicable manner,\r\nthey pass with all in the world--including themselves--for bosom\r\nfriends; and yet at a certain moment--in a given situation--they would\r\nstab each other in the back without compunction or hesitation, to gain a\r\nstep in the race for distinction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dearest foes.]\r\n\r\nBetween two other men there intervenes not the space of even a seat;\r\nthey are cheek by jowl, and touching each other's coat-tails; and yet\r\nthere yawns between them a gulf of deadly and almost murderous hate\r\nwhich not years, nor forgiveness, nor recollections of past comradeship\r\nwill ever bridge over. And look at the House as a whole, and what do you\r\nsee but a number of fierce ambitions, hatreds, and antipathies, natural\r\nand acquired--the play of the worst and the deadliest passions of the\r\nhuman heart? Above all things, be assured that there is scarcely one in\r\nall this assembly whose natural stock of vanity--that dreadful heritage\r\nwe all have--has not been maximised and sharpened by the glare, the\r\napplause, the collisions and frictions of public life. I have heard it\r\nsaid that even the manliest fellow, who has become an actor, is liable\r\nto be filled to a bursting gorge with hatred of the pretty woman who may\r\nsnatch from him a round of applause; and assuredly every nature is\r\nliable to be soured, inflamed, and degraded by those appearances before\r\nthe gallery of the public meeting, the watchful voters, the echoing\r\nPress, and all the other agencies that create and register public fame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blighted hopes.]\r\n\r\nThink of all this, and then imagine what a Prime Minister does who\r\nproposes a scheme which will deprive some dozens of men of an\r\nopportunity of public attention for which they have been panting and\r\nworking perchance for years. Recollect, furthermore, that the private\r\nmember may be interested in his proposal with the fanaticism of the\r\nfaddist--the relentless purpose of the philanthropist, the vehement\r\nardour of the reformer. Then you can understand something of the danger\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone had to face. For his motion came to this, that every\r\nmember--except one--who had a resolution on the paper which he desired\r\nto bring before the House had to be either silenced altogether or pushed\r\ninto a horrid and ghastly hour when either he would not be listened to\r\nby a dozen members, or would perhaps be guillotined out of a hearing by\r\nthe count out. Let me further explain, for I wish to make the whole\r\nscene intelligible to every reader. Tuesdays and Fridays belong to\r\nprivate members as well as Wednesdays, and on Tuesdays and Fridays\r\naccordingly private members bring forward motions on some subjects in\r\nwhich they are especially interested. In order to get these Tuesdays and\r\nFridays, they have to ballot--so keen is the competition for the\r\nplace--and if a member be lucky enough to be first called in the ballot,\r\nhe gives notice of his motion, and for the Tuesday or the Friday the\r\nbest part of the sitting is as much his as if it belonged to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salaried Members--Railway Rates--Bimetallism.]\r\n\r\nNow several members are interested in the question of payment of\r\nmembers, and for Tuesday, March 21st, or some such day, there was a\r\nmotion down for payment of members. Dr. Hunter is interested in the new\r\nrailway rates, and for Tuesday, March 14th, he had a motion down in\r\nreference to railway rates. Finally, several members are interested in\r\nbimetallism, and for Tuesday, February 28th, a motion on this subject\r\nwas designed. What, then, Mr. Gladstone proposed meant that Dr. Hunter\r\ncould not propose his motion of railway rates; that the member\r\ninterested in payment of members could not propose his motion; that the\r\nmotion on bimetallism could not be proposed; in short, that these\r\ngentlemen, and their motions and their time, should be swallowed up by\r\nthe voracious maw of the Government. This description will suffice to\r\nbring before the mind of any reader the difficulty and danger of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disappointed Office-seekers.]\r\n\r\nI tread on somewhat delicate ground when I tell the story of the manner\r\nin which some members of the Liberal party utilised this situation. It\r\nis no secret that there are in this, as in every House of Commons, a\r\nnumber of gentlemen who do not think that their services have been\r\nsufficiently appreciated by the Minister to whom the unhappy task was\r\ngiven of selecting his colleagues in office. This is the case with every\r\nGovernment, and with every House of Commons--with every party and with\r\nevery Ministry. You do not think that the favourite of fortune whom you\r\nenvy has reached a period of undisturbed happiness when he sits on the\r\nTreasury Bench--even when he speaks amid a triumphant chorus of cheers,\r\nor drives through long lines of enthusiastically cheering crowds. He has\r\nto fight for his life every moment of its existence. He is climbing not\r\na secure ladder on solid earth, but up a glacier with slipping steps,\r\nthe abyss beneath, the avalanche above--watchful enemies all round--even\r\namong the guides he ought to be able to trust. Do you suppose that every\r\nmember of the Liberal party loves Mr. Asquith, and is delighted when he\r\ndisplays his great talents? Do you think that none of the gentlemen\r\nbelow the gangway do not believe that in their mute and inglorious\r\nbreasts, there are no streams of eloquence more copious and resistless?\r\nNo, my friend, take this as an axiom of political careers, that you hold\r\nyour life as long as you are able to kill anybody who tries to kill you,\r\nand not one hour longer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powerful malcontents.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that a party of malcontents is especially\r\npowerful in a Parliament which has in hand the greatest task of our\r\ntime, and which on the other side has a majority which revolt of even a\r\nsmall number can at any moment turn into a dishonoured and impotent\r\nminority. Such being the material, a nice little plot was concocted by\r\nwhich a certain number of young members, full of all that vague distrust\r\nof existing ministries which belongs to ardent young Radicalism, were\r\nto be induced to give a vote against Mr. Gladstone's proposal to take\r\naway the time of private members. And it is reported that one member of\r\nthe Liberal party had begun operations as many as four weeks before Mr.\r\nGladstone's Bill came on, and had tried to extort a number of pledges,\r\nthe full meaning of which would only come upon the unhappy people who\r\nmade them when they had endangered or destroyed the best of modern\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The out-manoeuvred Tories.]\r\n\r\nI think I have now said enough to explain what I am going to relate. Mr.\r\nGladstone explained his proposal; which briefly was, that in order to\r\nget on with Home Rule it was necessary to take the time of private\r\nmembers. As will have been seen, the meaning of this would have been to\r\nhave swept away at once all the private motions in which members were\r\ninterested. When the motion came to be discussed, there was a very\r\ncurious phenomenon. Everybody had been reading in the morning papers the\r\nchorus of disapproval in which the Tory press had been denouncing the\r\nleadership of the Tory party, liberals had been repeating to each other\r\nwith delight the verdict of the chief Tory organ--the _Standard_\r\nnewspaper--that the Tory party had been out-manoeuvred and beaten at\r\nevery point in the struggle, and that the portentous promises of the\r\nrecess had been utterly baffled by the superior judgment, the better\r\nconcerted tactics, and, above all, by the unexpected solidity and\r\ncohesion of the Liberal party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organized for obstruction.]\r\n\r\nThat all this had produced its effect on the Tory party as well was soon\r\nevident. An old campaigner in the House of Commons can soon tell when a\r\nparty has been organized for the purpose of Obstruction. There is a\r\nfeverishness; there are ample notes; there is a rising of many members\r\nat the same time when the moment comes to catch the Speaker's eye. Other\r\nindications presented themselves. Mr. Seton-Karr is, personally, one of\r\nthe kindliest of men--cheery, good-natured, full of the easy\r\ngive-and-take of political struggle; but even he himself would not\r\nclaim to be a Parliamentary orator. But on February 27th, he, as much as\r\neverybody else, must have been surprised to find that his utterances,\r\nwhich, in truth, were stumbling enough, should at every point be\r\npunctuated by a deep bellow of cheers such as might have delighted the\r\nmost trained and the most accomplished orators in the House. The House\r\nitself was at first taken aback by this outburst of deep-throated and\r\nraucous cheers, and after it had sufficiently recovered from its\r\nsurprise discovered that it all came from one bench--the front bench\r\nbelow the gangway. On this bench there were gathered together a number\r\nof the younger members of the Tory party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The claque in Parliament.]\r\n\r\nAt once it was seen what had taken place; the Tories, stung to action by\r\nthe taunts of their own press, had concerted a new system of tactics.\r\nAnd one portion of these tactics was to introduce into the House of\r\nCommons a phenomenon new to even its secular and varied\r\nexperience--namely, an organized claque. It was really just as if one\r\nwere in a French theatre. Uniformly, regularly, with a certain\r\nmechanical and hollow effect underneath its bellowings, the group below\r\nthe gangway uttered its war notes. Beyond all question, recognizable by\r\nthe unmistakable family features, it was there--the organized theatrical\r\nclaque on the floor of the British House of Commons. There were other\r\nindications of the transformation on which the Tories were determined.\r\nWhen Mr. Seton-Karr sate down after a palpably obstructive speech, Mr.\r\nBartley got up, and several other Tories at the same time. Mr. Bartley\r\nis not an attractive personality. He has a very strong rather than\r\npleasant or intellectual face. There is plenty of bulldog tenacity in\r\nit--plenty of animal courage, plenty of self-confidence; but it has none\r\nof the rays of a strong intelligence, and not many glimpses of\r\nkindliness or sweetness of nature. It is in the work of obstruction that\r\none sees temperament rather than intellect in the House of Commons.\r\nObstruction does not call for very high intellectual powers, though,\r\nundoubtedly, obstruction can at the same time display the highest\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artists in obstruction.]\r\n\r\nFor instance, Mr. Sexton made his first reputation in the House of\r\nCommons by a speech three hours in duration, which was regarded by the\r\nmajority as an intentional waste of time and an obstruction of a hateful\r\nBill, but which everybody had to hear from the sheer force of its\r\nsplendid reasoning, orderly arrangement of material, and now and then\r\nbursts of the best form of Parliamentary eloquence. But the\r\nobstructionist wants, as a rule, strength of character rather than of\r\noratory--as witness the extraordinary work in obstruction done by the\r\nlate Mr. Biggar, who, by nature, was one of the most inarticulate of\r\nmen. It was because Biggar had nerves of steel--a courage that did not\r\nknow the meaning of fear, and that remained calm in the midst of a\r\ncyclone of repugnance, hatred, and menace. Mr. Bartley, then, has the\r\ncharacter for the obstructive, and he rose blithely on the waves of the\r\nParliamentary tempest. But he had to face a continuous roar of\r\ninterruption and hostility from the Irish benches--those converted\r\nsinners who have abjured sack, and have become the most orderly and\r\nloyal, and steadfast of Ministerialist bulwarks. And now and then when\r\nthe roar of interruption became loud and almost deafening, there arose\r\nfrom the Tory bench below the gangway that strange new claque which on\r\nthat Monday night I heard for the first time in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. James Lowther.]\r\n\r\nOne other figure rose out of the sea of upturned and vehement faces at\r\nthis moment of stress and storm. When the Irish Members were shouting\r\ndisapproval there suddenly gleamed upon them a face from the front\r\nOpposition bench. It was a startling--I might almost say a menacing\r\nexhibition. It was the face of Mr. James Lowther. I find that few people\r\nhave as keen an appreciation of this remarkable man as I have. In his\r\nown party he passes more or less for a mere comedian--indeed, I might\r\nsay, low comedian, in the professional and not in the offensive sense.\r\nHis tenure of the Chief Secretaryship of Ireland is looked back upon, in\r\nan age that has known Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Mr. Balfour, and Mr. John\r\nMorley, as a sublime and daring joke by Disraeli which belongs to, and\r\ncould only happen in an epoch when sober England was ready to allow her\r\nOriental juggler and master to play any kind of Midsummer's Night's\r\nDream pranks even with the sternest realities of human life. Yet\r\nsometimes the thought occurs to me that if he were a little more\r\narticulate, or, perchance, if the time came when a democracy had to be\r\nmet, not with bursts of Parliamentary eloquence, but with shot and\r\nshell, and the determination to kill or be killed, the leadership of the\r\nparty of the aristocracy would fall from the effeminate hands of the\r\nsupersubtle and cultivated Mr. Balfour into the firm and tight grip of\r\nthe rugged, uncultured country gentleman who sits remote and neglected\r\nclose to him. There are the tightness and firmness of a death-trap in\r\nthe large, strong mouth, a dangerous gleam in the steady eyes, infinite\r\npowers of firmness, inflexibility, and of even cruelty in the whole\r\nexpression, not in the least softened, but rather heightened and exalted\r\nby the pretty constant smile--the smile that indicates the absence alike\r\nof the heat of passion or the touch of pity, and that speaks aloud of\r\nthe unquestioning and dogged resolve of the aristocrat to fight for\r\nprivilege to the death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What a cruel face!]\r\n\r\n\"Ah, what a cruel face!\" exclaimed an Irish Member by my side as Mr.\r\nLowther turned back and shouted, \"Order, order!\" at the Irish\r\nbenches--the good-humoured smile absent for a few moments, and\r\nrevelations given into abyssmal depths. But Mr. Lowther soon recovered\r\nhimself, smiled with his usual blandness, and once more dropped the hood\r\nover his inner nature. But it was a moment which brought its revelations\r\nto any keen observer; especially if he could have seen the answering\r\nlooks from a pair of blazing Celtic eyes--also characteristic in their\r\nway of all the passion, rage, and secular intrepidity of the smaller\r\nand weaker race that has carried on a struggle for seven centuries--over\r\nbattlefields strewn with the conquered dead--past gallows stained by\r\nheroic blood--past prisons and hulks where noble hearts ate themselves\r\nwearily and slowly to death. It was as in one glance all the contrast,\r\nthe antipathies, the misunderstanding which had separated one type of\r\nIrishmen from one type of Englishmen through hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bond of the Railway Rates.]\r\n\r\nThese are somewhat remote reflections from the squat figure, the harsh\r\nand grating voice, and the commonplace rhetoric of Mr. Bartley--so far\r\ncan fancy and insight lead one astray in that great stage of Titanic\r\npassions which is spread on the floor of the House of Commons. And what\r\nsignificance of great historic issues and reminiscences there were in\r\nthe scene were likewise lost on Dr. Hunter. To him the universe at the\r\nmoment--all the tremendous destinies on the knees of Mr. Gladstone--all\r\nthe millionfold hopes and hungering longings that were involved--were as\r\nnought in comparison with the fact that the motion of Mr. Gladstone\r\ndeprived him of the opportunity of raising a debate on Railway Rates.\r\nColdly, calmly, self-confidently, Dr. Hunter attacked the Government in\r\nits weakest place, and drove the dagger home through the vulnerable\r\nside. The weakness of the position was this: there was a strong,\r\nvehement, and widespread revolt in the House against the exactions of\r\nthe railway companies. Liberal members had on the subject exactly the\r\nsame feelings as Tories; nightly a score of questions were asked on the\r\nsubject. Altogether, indignation had broken down party lines, and\r\nagainst the railway companies Liberal and Tory made common cause.\r\nUnfortunately, Dr. Hunter's case had been strengthened by a somewhat\r\nweak yielding of Mr. Gladstone to a demand for a day on Bimetallism.\r\nThis demand had, it is true, been urged upon him from various parts of\r\nthe House, including his own, and he seemed to be yielding to a pretty\r\nuniversal demand. But Bimetallism was a craze with no chance of even\r\ndistant success, while Railway Rates were at that very moment urgently\r\ncalling for redress from hundreds of threatened industries. It would be\r\nseen then what a dexterous weapon for striking the Government the\r\nselection of the day for Railway Rates was.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Tory Leader.]\r\n\r\nThe Tories ought to have at once perceived the value of the weapon which\r\na Liberal had thus placed in their hands. Some of them did so, and,\r\nundoubtedly, if a man with the Parliamentary instinct of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill had been at their head, they would at once have made deadly\r\nand, haply, destructive use of the opportunity. But Mr. Balfour was\r\naway. Lord Randolph sate, dark and solitary, at a remote seat, and Mr.\r\nGoschen can always be confidently relied upon to do the wrong thing. It\r\nwill be seen presently how he helped to save the Government it was his\r\nduty to destroy. No; the danger of the situation came not from the Tory,\r\nbut from the Liberal benches. There are in the Liberal, as in every\r\nparty of the House, a number of young and new members who have not yet\r\nlearned the secret and personal springs of action, and who, moreover, do\r\nnot at once realize the vast underlying issues on an apparently small\r\nquestion. To them the Liberal intriguers against the Government had\r\nsteadily and plausibly addressed themselves, and many of them were under\r\nthe impression that the question raised by Dr. Hunter would decide\r\nnothing more serious than the special purpose to which one day of the\r\nSession could be devoted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A coming storm.]\r\n\r\nBut anybody with the slightest acquaintance with the House of Commons\r\nwould have soon perceived that matter of much greater pith and moment\r\nwas at stake. The Senior Ministerial Whip is the danger-signal of the\r\nHouse of Commons; and the danger-signal was very much in evidence. Mr.\r\nMarjoribanks--of all Whips the most genial, even-tempered, and\r\nlong-suffering, as well as the most effective--was to be seen, rushing\r\nbackwards and forwards between the lobby and the Treasury bench, where,\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone, he held whispered and apparently excited\r\nconversations. Meantime, there grew up in the House of Commons that\r\nmysterious sense of coming storm which its quick sensibilities always\r\nenable it to see from afar. There came a sudden murmuring, and then a\r\nstrange stillness, and older members almost held their breaths. From the\r\nIrish benches not a sound escaped. In most Parliamentary\r\nfrays--especially when the storm rages--there are certain Irish members\r\nwho are certain to figure largely and eminently; but on these benches\r\nthere was a silence, ominous to those who are able to note the signs of\r\nthe Parliamentary firmament. Anyone looking on could have seen that the\r\nsilence did not come from inattention or want of interest, for the looks\r\nbetrayed keen and almost feverish excitement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ireland in danger.]\r\n\r\nFor what was going on was a fight whether Ireland was to be lost or\r\nsaved, and lost through the folly, desertion, or levity of some of the\r\nmen that had sworn to save her. Fortunately, the strains of the most\r\ntragic situations have their relief in the invincible irony of life, and\r\nthere was a welcome break in the appearance on the scene of him whom all\r\nmen know as \"Alpheus Cleophas\"--the redoubtable Mr. Morton. Some men are\r\ncomic by intention, some are comic unconsciously and unintentionally,\r\nsome men are comic half by intention and half in spite of themselves. To\r\nthis last class belongs our Alpheus Cleophas. He played his part of\r\ncomic relief with a certain air of knowing what was expected of him--you\r\nsee this demoralizing House of Commons makes everybody self-conscious,\r\nand one could see that he himself anticipated the roar of laughter with\r\nwhich the House received his statement, \"I have now a majority\"--by\r\nwhich, for the moment, Alpheus appeared as the leader of the Government,\r\nand a party which controlled the destinies of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mere comic relief.]\r\n\r\nStill, as I have said, this was only comic relief--the jokes, ofttimes\r\nmechanical, by which the young men and women downstairs prepare to pass\r\nthe time which is required for the preparation of the great scene, in\r\nwhich their principals have to enact their great situation. Still, the\r\n_dénouement_ of the drama was uncertain. Mr. Marjoribanks rushed from\r\nlobby to Mr. Gladstone, from Mr. Gladstone to lobby--and still there\r\nhung in the air the fatal question: \"Was the Government going out?\" Ah!\r\nthink of it. Was Gladstone going to end his days in baffled purpose, in\r\nmelancholy retirement, with the great last solemn issue of his life\r\nended in puerile fiasco and farcical anarchy, instead of in the picture\r\nof two nations reconciled, an empire strengthened and ennobled, all\r\nhumanity lifted to higher possibilities of brotherhood and concord, by\r\nthe peaceful close of the bloody and hideous struggle of centuries?\r\nThink of it all, I say, and then go also in imagination to the door of\r\nthe House of Commons, and see a Scotch Liberal fighting for dear life to\r\nbring into the Tory lobby the necessary number of misguided and ignorant\r\nneophytes to bring down this disastrous catastrophe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why no signal?]\r\n\r\nMeantime, confusion still reigned on the Liberal benches. Men were\r\nconfused, and bewildered, and irresolute, and frightened, conscience of\r\ncalamitous danger, and yet unable to understand it all. And here let me\r\nsay that this state of confusion was due partly to bad leadership. There\r\nis a want of cohesion--on this day in particular--on the Treasury bench.\r\nMr. Gladstone, like all ardent natures, takes too much on himself. He\r\nis, of course, a tower of strength--twenty men are not such as he. But\r\nthe burden cannot all be borne by one shoulder--especially at a portion\r\nof the sitting when, by a strict interpretation of the rules of the\r\nHouse, Mr. Gladstone is allowed to speak but once. Why were these\r\nscattered and young and inexperienced troops not told, by their leaders,\r\nof the vast issues involved in this coming vote? Why were not all the\r\nsophistries brushed away, by which the conspirators against the\r\nGovernment were hiding the real effect and purpose of the votes? Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt is an old Parliamentary hand; Mr. John Morley is\r\nexcellent when a few words are required to meet a crisis; Mr.\r\nAsquith--keen, alert, alive to all that is going on--sits at Mr.\r\nGladstone's side. Why were all these lips dumb? It made one almost rage\r\nor weep, to see the uncertain battle thus left unguided and\r\nuncontrolled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Goschen to the rescue.]\r\n\r\nAt last a saviour, but he came from the ranks of the enemy. Mr. Goschen\r\nswept away the network of cobwebs under which Liberals had hidden the\r\nissues, and boldly declared the real issue. And that issue was, that Mr.\r\nGladstone wanted time to push forward his Home Rule Bill, and that the\r\nTory party was determined to prevent him getting that time if they could\r\nmanage it. Where be now the hysterics about private members and simple\r\nissues and small questions? The issue lies naked and clear before the\r\nHouse. But still victory isn't assured. Mr. Goschen with his thick\r\nutterance, his muffled voice, his loss of grip and point, has ceased to\r\nbe listened to very attentively in the House of Commons; and this\r\nspeech--the most significant yet delivered--passes almost unnoticed,\r\nexcept by those who know the House of Commons and watch its moods and\r\nevery word. The last and decisive word has yet to come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Storey's contribution.]\r\n\r\nAt the same moment as Mr. Morton, Mr. Storey had risen from his seat,\r\nand demanded the word. There is a flutter of expectation. On this speech\r\ndepended, at this moment, the fate of Home Rule and the Gladstone\r\nGovernment. What will it say? Mr. Storey always takes a line of his own;\r\nis a strong man with strong opinions, plenty of courage, not altogether\r\nfree from the tendency of original natures, to break away from the\r\nmechanical uniformity of party discipline. Moreover, he is the chief\r\namong that sturdy little knot of Radicals below the gangway who are\r\ndetermined to make the Liberal coach go faster than the jog-trot of mere\r\nofficialism. Will he call upon his friends to stand by the Government or\r\nto desert them--it is a most pregnant question.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, in the midst of cyclones, to collect one's thoughts--to\r\nchoose one's words--to hit straight home with short, emphatic blow. But\r\nthis feat Mr. Storey accomplished. I have never heard, in my thirteen\r\nyears' experience of the House of Commons, a speech more admirable in\r\nform. Not a word too much, and every sentence linked tight to the\r\nother--reasoning, cogent, unanswerable, resistless. And the point above\r\nall other things laid bare--are you Liberals going to help the Tories to\r\npostpone, if not finally overthrow Home Rule, or are you not? This, it\r\nwill be seen, is but the emphasizing of the lead already given by the\r\nmaladroit speech of Mr. Goschen. But Mr. Storey, clear, resonant,\r\nresolute, speaks to a House that listens with the stillness of great\r\nsituations. Every word tells. The issue is understood and knit; and now\r\nlet us troop into the lobbies, and proclaim to the world either our\r\nabject unfitness to govern an empire and pass a real statute, or let us\r\nstand by our great mission and mighty leader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Burns's penetration.]\r\n\r\nNot even yet do levity and faction surrender the final hope of doing\r\nmischief. At the door of the House, as I have already said, stands a\r\nScotch Liberal doing the work of Tory Whips, and attempting to capture\r\nyoung members who have smoked their pipes or drank their tea, or\r\nwandered up and down the terrace by the peaceful Thames--all unconscious\r\nof the great and grim drama going forward upstairs. He catches hold of\r\nJohn Burns, among others--a sturdy son of the soil ready to receive, as\r\nmight be hoped, anything which calls itself sturdy and independent\r\nRadicalism. Over honest John's manly form there is a fight; but he has a\r\nstrong, clear, practical head over his muscular body, and at once\r\npenetrates to the underlying issue, and walks into Gladstone's lobby.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The division.]\r\n\r\nAt last the division is nearing its close, and the excitement--perhaps,\r\nbecause it is so painfully repressed--has grown until it has almost\r\nbecome unbearable. Whenever there is a close division like this, several\r\nthings happen which never happen on other occasions. Members gather\r\nround the doors of the division lobbies, listening to the tellers as\r\nthey count one, two, three, four, and so on, in the mechanical voice of\r\nthe croupiers, bidding the gamblers to play with the dice of death. The\r\nWhips also are narrowly watched to see which return first to the House,\r\nfor the first return means which lobby has been sooner exhausted, and\r\nthe lobby sooner exhausted is necessarily the smaller lobby, and,\r\ntherefore, the lobby of the minority. Mr. Marjoribanks, who has told for\r\nthe Government at the door of the Tory lobby, has returned to the House\r\nfirst. That's a good sign. But still, if there be a majority, what is it\r\ngoing to be?--disastrously near defeat, or near enough to moral strength\r\nas to mean nothing? A few minutes more have to pass before this fateful\r\nquestion is settled. Mr. Thomas Ellis--light, brisk--walks up the floor\r\nto the clerk in front of the table. Then the numbers are whispered to\r\nMr. Gladstone. The winning teller always takes the paper from the clerk.\r\nIt is Mr. Marjoribanks who receives the paper, and the Government has\r\nwon. A faint cheer, then an immediate hush; we want to know the exact\r\nnumbers. Mr. Marjoribanks reads them out--a majority of thirty-one. We\r\nhave won, and we who support the Ministry, cheer; but our majority has\r\nbeen reduced, so the Opposition burst their throats with defiant answer.\r\n\r\nThen, with fatuous folly, the Tories insist on another division. Two\r\nIrish members, driving straight from Euston station to the House--John\r\nDillon and Mr. Collery--have meantime been added to the Ministerial\r\nranks. Some of the mutineers have come back, and the majority rises to\r\nforty-two.\r\n\r\nAnd so ended the great intrigue of the Liberal malcontents against the\r\nGladstone Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obstruction rampant.]\r\n\r\nThe word had gone forth--the Home Rule Bill was not to be allowed to\r\npass the second reading before the Easter recess. The slings and arrows\r\nof the Tory press had at last begun to have their effect, and\r\nobstruction had now been entered upon thoroughly, fiercely, and\r\nshamelessly. The first specimen of it was on the following Thursday\r\nnight, when Mr. T.W. Russell took advantage of an harangue by Mr.\r\nJustice O'Brien--those Irish judges are all shameless political\r\npartisans--to move the adjournment of the House. Mr. Morley was in\r\nexcellent fighting form. T.W. Russell is a man peculiarly well\r\ncalculated to draw out the belligerent spirit of any man, and the Chief\r\nSecretary, though he holds himself well under restraint, has plenty of\r\nfire and passion in his veins. He let out at T.W. Russell in splendid\r\nstyle, and the more the Tories yelled, the more determinedly did Mr.\r\nMorley strike his blows. Russell, he said, had spread broadcast\r\nphylacteries, and used his most pharisaical language. At this there were\r\ndeafening shouts from the Tory benches of \"Withdraw! Withdraw!\" Mr.\r\nMorley's reply was to repeat the words \"pharisaical language\"--at which\r\nthere was another storm. Then Mr. Morley quietly observed that if he\r\nwere out of order, the Speaker was the proper person to call him to\r\naccount; and as the Speaker made no sign, the Tories were reduced to\r\nsilence. In a few sentences, Mr. Morley made mince-meat of the whole\r\nattack: showing that crime, instead of increasing, had actually\r\ndiminished in Clare since he had come into office, and that Mr. Balfour\r\nand coercion had completely failed to do even as much as he had done.\r\nMr. Balfour made a somewhat feeble reply. And finally, in spite of a\r\nstrong whip, the Tories were beaten by forty-five--the normal Liberal\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The loosing of the winds.]\r\n\r\nBut all this was but the preface to uglier and worse work which was to\r\ncome later on. Supply is the happy hunting-ground of obstructives. The\r\nquestions there are small, and so easily comprehended, that even the\r\ndullest man can talk about them, and it requires--as I have said\r\nabove--not intellect, but temperament. For nearly four hours there was a\r\ndiscussion on an item of £100, which had been spent on improving the\r\naccommodation of the House of Commons. John Burns, disgusted at this\r\npalpable waste of time, four times moved the closure. Jimmy Lowther--who\r\nhas come wonderfully to the front since obstruction and general rowdyism\r\nhas become the order of the day with the Tories--instantly turned to\r\nJohn with the observation that this was not the County Council;\r\nwhereupon John promptly retorted, \"Nor are you on Newmarket Heath.\" At\r\nlast, after the waste of these four mortal hours, the closure was moved,\r\nwas resisted by the majority of the Tory party, but, at the same time,\r\nwas so necessary and proper, that several Tories voted in its favour,\r\nand some disgusted Unionists actually left the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A criminal combination.]\r\n\r\nBut even worse was still behind. Mr. Bowles--a new and clever Tory\r\nmember--was anxious to raise the whole question of Egyptian policy on a\r\nsmall vote for meeting the expense of building a new consular house at\r\nCairo. Thereupon, Mr. Mellor--as he was plainly bound to do--declared\r\nthat a discussion of the entire Egyptian policy would not be in order on\r\nsuch a vote. Pale, excited, looking his most evil self, Mr. Chamberlain\r\ngot up to base an attack on Mr. Mellor for this judgment. There was a\r\ndelighted howl from the young Tory bloods who had been obstructing so\r\nshamelessly throughout the evening. Mr. Chamberlain's example was\r\nfollowed by Mr. Balfour, by Sir John Gorst--in short, the whole Tory and\r\nUnionist pack were in full cry after the Chairman. The inner meaning of\r\nall this, was the desire to discredit the new Chairman, and intimidate\r\nhim, lest he should show a bold front against the shameless obstruction\r\non which the Tories had resolved. Mr. Sexton put this point neatly. In\r\nview, he said, of the combined attempt and evident combination to\r\nintimidate and embarrass the Chair--but he could go no further: for at\r\nonce there was a fierce hurricane of howls, \"Withdraw! Withdraw!\" and\r\n\"Shame! Shame!\" from the Tories and renegades, which drowned every\r\nvoice. Tory after Tory got up; shouts deafening, passionate, ferocious,\r\nmade everything inaudible; Mr. Chamberlain, paler even than usual,\r\nshouted with full mouth across the floor; altogether, the scene was one\r\nof almost insane excitement. Mr. Mellor--gentle, considerate,\r\nconciliatory--reasoned, explained, expostulated. What he should have\r\ndone, was to have named half-a-dozen Tories, and showed the party of\r\nbullies that their day was past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION AND ITS AGENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The younger Tories.]\r\n\r\nObstruction is a thing rather of temperament than intellect. The\r\noccurrences of the early weeks of the Session of 1893 fully confirm this\r\nview. The Tory party and the Unionists vowed in their organs, and proved\r\nby their conduct in the House, that they determined to try and prevent,\r\nby obstruction, the second reading of the Home Rule Bill being taken\r\nbefore Easter. With this design they came down to the House every\r\nevening with a plan of attack. The consequences were somewhat serious to\r\nsome members of the House. I saw young gentlemen suddenly developing\r\nactivity whom I had beheld in the House for many years in succession\r\nwithout ever suspecting in them either the power or the desire to take\r\nany part in Parliamentary debate. The same gentlemen now rushed about\r\nwith a hurried, preoccupied, and, above all, a self-conscious air that\r\nhad its disgusting but also its very amusing side. For instance, Mr.\r\nBromley-Davenport, during the six years of Tory Government, never spoke,\r\nand rarely even made his appearance in the House of Commons. His voice\r\nwas as strange to the assembly as though he had never belonged to it.\r\nBut this Session he is constantly getting up in his seat, and he rushes\r\nthrough the lobbies with the cyclonic movement of a youth bearing on\r\njuvenile shoulders a weight too heavy to bear. Mr. Bartley is about as\r\ndull a fellow as ever bored a House of Commons, and in the last\r\nParliament even his own friends found him a trial and a nuisance. He has\r\nsuddenly taken to making the House of Commons familiar with his voice at\r\nevery sitting. Lord Cranborne has been remarkable for the boorishness\r\nand impertinence of his manners--or, perhaps, to be more accurate, want\r\nof manners. I have seen him interrupting Mr. Gladstone in the most\r\nimpudent way with a face you would like to slap, and his hands deep down\r\nin the depths of his pockets. Lord Cranborne is now nightly in evidence,\r\nand leads the chorus of jeers and cheers by which the more brutal of the\r\nTory youth signalize the opening of the new style of Parliamentary\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jimmy.]\r\n\r\nBut of all the things which indicate the new state of affairs which has\r\narisen, nothing is so significant as the change in the position of Jimmy\r\nLowther. People think that I have attached too much importance to this\r\nextraordinary individual, and that he should be taken simply as the\r\nfrank horse-jockey he looks and seems. I have given my reasons for\r\nbelieving that in a crisis Jimmy would develop a very different side of\r\nhis character, and that he has in him--latent and disguised for the\r\nmoment--all the terrible passions and possibilities of the aristocrat at\r\nbay. However, let that question rest with history and its future\r\ndevelopments; his position at the present moment is very peculiar. There\r\nis a report that the desire of his heart is to sit on the first seat on\r\nthe front bench below the gangway, which for seven years was occupied by\r\nMr. Labouchere, and which for the five years of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry\r\nof 1880 to 1885 was occupied by Lord Randolph Churchill when he was the\r\nchief of the dead and buried Fourth Party. That seat is the natural\r\npoint for a sharpshooter and guerilla warrior. Indeed, the first seat\r\nbelow the gangway seems just as marked out by fate for such a man as\r\nJimmy Lowther, as one of the high fortresses on the Rhine for the work\r\nof the bold freebooter of the Middle Ages. But for some reason or other,\r\nJimmy did not attain his heart's desire, and he is compelled to sit on\r\nthe front Opposition bench. This would not seem an affliction to\r\nordinary men. Indeed, the desire to sit on one of the front benches may\r\nbe regarded as the root of all evil in Parliamentary nature--the desire\r\nto eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge which is as fatal to nature\r\nborn without original political sin as that disastrous episode in the\r\nannals of our first parents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A recollection of Disraeli.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious episodes in the career of Disraeli was that he\r\ninsisted on sitting on the front Opposition bench before he had ever\r\nheld office--an act of unprecedented and unjustifiable daring which\r\nthrows a significant light on that habit of self-assertion to which he\r\nowed a good deal of his success in life. For what a seat on the front\r\nOpposition bench means is, that the holder thereof has once held office\r\nin an administration, and so is justified for the remainder of his days\r\nin regarding himself as above the common herd. But Jimmy isn't as\r\nordinary men. A place on the front Opposition bench, with all its\r\nadvantages, has the countervailing disadvantages of binding to a certain\r\ndecency and decorum of behaviour, and nothing could be more galling to\r\nthe free and full soul of the distinguished steward of the Jockey Club.\r\nIt is said that in the same way his colleagues on the front Opposition\r\nbench would prefer Jimmy's room to his company. In Parliamentary\r\npolitics, as in diplomacy, there is such a thing as having an agent whom\r\nyou can profit by, and at the same time disavow--just as it may suit\r\nyou. That is one of the many guileful methods of these crafty men who\r\nsit on front benches on both sides of the House. Obstruction is a thing\r\ntoo horrible to be practised by any man who has ever held responsible\r\nposition, and it is delightful to see how Mr. Balfour repudiates the\r\nvery idea of anything of the kind. It would, therefore, have suited Mr.\r\nBalfour a good deal better if Jimmy could have obstructed from some\r\nquarter of the House where his closeness of association would not so\r\nlargely commit his more responsible colleagues to participation in his\r\niniquities. However, it was not to be managed; and the leaders of the\r\nOpposition are bound to put up with the closeness of Jimmy's\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Lowther's intellect.]\r\n\r\nAgain I repeat, obstruction is a matter not of intellect, but\r\ntemperament. Intellectually, I should put Jimmy in a very low place,\r\neven in the ranks of the stupid party. Temperamentally he stands very\r\nhigh. A brief description of his methods of obstruction will bring this\r\nhome. First, it should be said that he is entirely inarticulate and,\r\nbeyond rough common sense, destitute of ideas. He has nothing to say,\r\nand he cannot say it. There are men in the House of Commons who have\r\nplenty of thoughts, and who have plenty of words besides, and could\r\nbranch out on any subject whatever into a dissertation which would\r\ncommand the interest even of political foes. But Jimmy is not of this\r\nclass. He is capable, on the contrary, of bringing down the loftiest\r\nsubject that ever moved human breasts to something stumbling,\r\ncommonplace and prosaic. When he gets up, then, his speech consists\r\nrather of a series of gulps than of articulate or intelligible\r\nstatements. But then mark the singular courage and audacity of the whole\r\nproceeding. There are traditions still in the House of Commons of the\r\nmarvellously stimulating effect upon followers of leaders, who were\r\nproverbial for their oratorical impotence. Everybody remembers the\r\nscornful description of Castlereagh which Byron gave to the world; and\r\nyet it has been said in some memoirs that the moment Castlereagh stood\r\nup and adjusted his waistcoat, there was a thrill in the House of\r\nCommons, and his followers bellowed their exultation and delight. In a\r\nmore recent day, Lord Althorpe was able to bear down the hostility of\r\nsome of the most powerful orators of his time by a bluff manliness which\r\nno rhetoric could withstand. And so also with Jimmy--his sheer audacity\r\ncarries him along the slow, dull, inept, muddy tide of his inarticulate\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An irrepressible nuisance.]\r\n\r\nAnd curiously enough, it is impossible to put him down. On March 6th he\r\nwas commenting on some item which he supposed was in a Post-office\r\nEstimate. It was pointed out to him that the item to which he alluded\r\nwas not in that particular vote at all, but in quite another vote, which\r\ncame later on. Jimmy, nevertheless, went on to discuss the item as if\r\nnothing had been said. Then the long-suffering Chairman had to be called\r\nin, and he ruled--as every human being would have been bound to\r\nrule--that Jimmy was out of order. Was Jimmy put down? Not the least in\r\nthe world. He made an apology, and, as the apology was ample and his\r\ndeliverance is slow, the apology enabled him to consume some more\r\nminutes of precious Government time. And then, having failed to find\r\nfault with the estimate for what it did not contain, he proceeded to\r\nassail it for what it did contain. Here again he was out of order, for\r\nthe estimate was prepared exactly as every other estimate had been\r\nprepared for years. This answer was given to him. But Jimmy went\r\non--gulping and obstructing, obstructing and gulping. It is amusing,\r\nperhaps, to you who can read this description as part of an\r\nafter-dinner's amusement, but what is one to think of a Parliamentary\r\ninstitution that can be so flouted, and nullified by mere beef-headed\r\ndulness? This is a question to make any one pause who has faith in\r\nParliamentary institutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Balfour keeps away.]\r\n\r\nDuring all these performances, Mr. Balfour keeps steadily away from the\r\nHouse. He never was a good attendant, even in his best of days, and now\r\nthat he is relieved of responsibility, he naturally seeks to take\r\nadvantage of it. But he doesn't take so much advantage as one would\r\nexpect. He who used to be so indolent, has developed a feverish\r\nactivity. He seems during some portions of every sitting to be ready to\r\nrise to his feet at the smallest provocation, and to interfere in the\r\nsmallest matter of detail. It is this tendency which has hurried him\r\ninto some of those ridiculous errors, which he has made so frequently.\r\nThe explanation of it all, is that curious figure that sits so silent,\r\nremote, and friendless on the front Opposition bench. Lord Randolph is\r\nstill the riddle which nobody can read. Whenever Mr. Balfour appears\r\nLord Randolph does his best to efface himself, even in the places which\r\nmen select on the front bench. Here is a hint of that eternal conflict\r\nand play of ferocious appetites and passions which is going on in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Everybody who has ever visited the House of Commons\r\nmust have observed that pair of boxes which stand on the table in front\r\nof the Speaker's chair. These boxes mark to the outward world the\r\npositions of the most important men in the House of Commons--the Leader\r\nof the House and the Leader of the Opposition. Mr. Balfour, whenever he\r\nis in the House, sits opposite his box, and so proclaims to all the\r\nworld the lofty post he holds. And when this is the case, it is in\r\nalmost the very last seat--separated by half a dozen other\r\nindividuals--Lord Randolph is to be seen. To turn to another part of the\r\nHouse, it is the men in whom Mr. Gladstone most confides who sit on\r\neither side of him--Sir William Harcourt and Mr. John Morley. If on any\r\nday it were seen that either of these two men had left the side of their\r\nleader, and was separated from him by several others, the rumour would\r\nrun like wildfire through the House of Commons that the relations of the\r\nPremier and one of his chief lieutenants were strained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deadly foes.]\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Balfour watches Lord Randolph and Lord Randolph watches Mr.\r\nBalfour, with the deadly vigilance of two men who stand opposite each\r\nother in a wood with drawn swords in their hands. There is another\r\ngentleman, besides, whom the Tory leader has to watch, and, perhaps,\r\nmore keenly. Lord Randolph Churchill is not always in his place, and his\r\nmovements in these days are leisurely--I remember when they were\r\nelectric in their rapidity and frequency. But Mr. Chamberlain is a\r\ndistinctly ready man. Whatever gifts he has, are always at his command.\r\nHe is like the shopman who puts all his goods in the window. The goods\r\nare not very fine nor very good, but they are showy and cheap, and,\r\nabove all things, take the eye. Mr. Chamberlain in his day has been a\r\npoor attendant in Parliament--a friend of his used to tell him, when he\r\nwas supposed to have the reversion of the Liberal leadership, that his\r\ninability to remain for hours in succession in the House of Commons\r\nwould always stand in the way of his being the leader of that assembly.\r\nBut he turns up now usually after dinner, and from his seat on the third\r\nbench below the gangway, on the Liberal side, watches the progress of\r\nbattle. It is known to the intimates of Mr. Balfour that he has not a\r\nparticularly high opinion of his partner in the work of obstructing the\r\ncause of Home Rule. Indeed, it is impossible that the two men should be\r\nreally sympathetic with each other. With all his faults, Mr. Balfour\r\ndoes represent the literary and cultured side of political life; while\r\nMr. Chamberlain is illiteracy embodied. Then, Mr. Chamberlain has a\r\nknack of attributing every victory to himself--modesty isn't one of his\r\nmany virtues--and this cannot be particularly agreeable to the real\r\nleader of the Opposition. There is thus a constant competition between\r\nthe two men as to which shall give the marching orders to the enemies of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain's slatternly inaccuracy.]\r\n\r\nThere was a singular scene on March 6th, which brought out the relations\r\nof the two in a singular manner. There appeared that day in the\r\ncongenial columns of the _Times_ a letter, a column in length, and set\r\nforth with all the resources of leaded and displayed type which the\r\noffice could afford. In this letter Joe had lamented the disappearance\r\nof those courteous manners of an elder and more Chesterfieldian time, to\r\nwhich he suggested he belonged. The origin of this delicious lament over\r\na venerable and more courteous past by so flagrant a type of modernity,\r\nwas a statement that Sir William Harcourt had played the dirty trick of\r\nputting down a notice to suspend the twelve o'clock rule at a shorter\r\nnotice than usual. The suspension of the twelve o'clock rule simply\r\nmeans that the Tories shall not be allowed to obstruct by the mere fact\r\nthat the House is compelled automatically to close at midnight under the\r\nexisting rules. Joe appeared in his place swelling with visibly virtuous\r\nindignation; evidently he had come, ready to bear down on Sir William\r\nand the Government generally with the cyclone of attack. But this\r\nnotable design was prevented by two accidents. First, Sir William\r\nHarcourt got up and explained that the notice he had given was exactly\r\nthe same kind of notice that was always, and had been always, given in\r\nlike circumstances. Everybody who knows anything about Parliamentary\r\nmatters knows that this was the literal truth. The dirty trick which Mr.\r\nChamberlain had attributed to Sir William Harcourt existed only in his\r\nown uninstructed and treacherous memory; and so he was crushed. Still he\r\nwanted to have a word in, and more than once he showed signs of rising\r\nto his feet. But he stopped half-way, and, when he did finally get up,\r\nMr. Balfour was before him, and he had to sit down again. Then his\r\nopportunity was lost, for Mr. Balfour had declared that he was perfectly\r\nsatisfied with what Sir William Harcourt had done, and that prevented\r\nJoe from entering on the filibustering tactics which apparently he\r\ncontemplated. This appeared to the whole House to be a very distinct and\r\nunpleasant snub for Joseph. A short time afterwards he and Mr. Balfour\r\nwere seen in the lobby, engaged in a conversation that was apparently\r\nvehement, and everybody jumped to the conclusion that they were having\r\nit out, and that Joseph was resenting the rejection of his advice with\r\nthat haughtiness of temper which is so well-known a characteristic of\r\nthe Radical whom wealth has converted into a leader of the aristocracy.\r\nThe papers afterwards contained an announcement that the two\r\nconspirators against Mr. Gladstone's Government were in the heartiest\r\naccord. This was one of the semi-official denials which are generally\r\nregarded as the best testimony to the truth of the report denied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Morley.]\r\n\r\nIf one were on the look-out for dramatic and instructive contrast in the\r\nHouse of Commons, one could not do better than study Mr. Morley and Mr.\r\nChamberlain for a week. Mr. Chamberlain--glib, shallow, self-possessed,\r\nwell-trained by years of public life--debates admirably. Nobody can deny\r\nthat--not even those who, like myself, find his speaking exasperatingly\r\nempty and superficial and foolish. He is master of all his resources;\r\nscarcely ever pauses for a word, and when he is interrupted, can parry\r\nthe stroke with a return blow of lightning-like rapidity. But when he\r\nsits down, is there any human being that feels a bit the wiser or the\r\nbetter for what he has said? And who can get over the idea that it has\r\nall been a bit of clever special pleading--such as one could hear in\r\nhalf-a-dozen courts of law any day of the week? And, finally, who is\r\nthere that can help feeling throughout all the speech that this is a\r\nselfish nature--full of venom, ambition, and passion--seeing in\r\npolitical conflict not great principles to advance--holy causes to\r\ndefend--happiness to extend--but so many enemies' faces to grind to\r\ndust?\r\n\r\nMr. Morley is a fine platform speaker, but as yet he is not nearly as\r\ngood a debater as Mr. Chamberlain. He stumbles, hesitates, finds it hard\r\noften to get the exact word he wants. And yet who cannot listen to him\r\nfor ten minutes without a sense of a great mind--and what to me is\r\nbetter, a fine character behind it all? This man has thought\r\nout--possibly in travail of spirit--and his creed--though it may not be\r\nthe exultant cheerfulness of natures richer in muscle than in\r\nthought--is one for which he will fight and sacrifice, and not yield. In\r\nshort, the thinness of Mr. Chamberlain--the depths of Mr. Morley--these\r\nare the things which one will learn from hearing them speak even once.\r\n\r\nI have said that Mr. Morley is not as good a debater as Mr. Chamberlain;\r\nbut if Mr. Chamberlain be wise, he will call his watch-dogs off Mr.\r\nMorley, for he is being badgered into an excellent debater. Every night\r\nhe improves in his answers to questions. Tersely, frigidly--though\r\nthere is the undercurrent of scorn and sacred passion in most of what he\r\nsays--Mr. Morley meets the taunts and charges of the Russells, and the\r\nMacartneys, and the Carsons, and never yet has he been beaten in one of\r\nthose hand-to-hand fights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flagrant obstruction.]\r\n\r\nThere was a curious but instructive little scene towards the end of a\r\nsitting early in March. The Tories--headed by Jimmy Lowther--had been\r\nobstructing in the most shameless way for a whole afternoon. Towards the\r\nend of the evening Mr. Chamberlain had come down and joined in the\r\nfray--lending his authority to tactics which usually had been left to\r\nthe rag-tag and bobtail of all parties. As I have already said, this\r\nkind of intervention had seriously diminished Mr. Chamberlain in the\r\nrespect of the House. And the way in which he did his work was venomous\r\nas well as petty. The vote under discussion was a Supplemental Estimate\r\nfor Light Railways in Ireland. Everybody knows that light railways were\r\nthe policy of the late and not of the present Government. A supplemental\r\nestimate means simply a smaller sum by which the original estimate has\r\nbeen exceeded. It ought to have been a matter of course that this\r\nsupplementary estimate should have been agreed to by the Tories, seeing\r\nthat it was money necessary to carry out the programme passed by their\r\nown friends in the previous administration. But the Tories were in no\r\nhumour to listen to such trifles as these, and carried on lengthy\r\ndiscussions. Mr. Morley, having no responsibility for the policy which\r\nrendered such a vote necessary, was away in his room, attending to the\r\nduties of his laborious department. Mr. T.W. Russell assumed to be in a\r\ngreat pucker over this absence, and actually tried to stop the\r\nproceedings until Mr. Morley came back.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: While a wronged nation waits.]\r\n\r\nMr. Morley did appear in due course, and then there was an attempt to\r\nassail him for his absence. There was also an attempt to take advantage\r\nof his presence to resume the discussion of the very topics which had\r\nalready been discussed for many hours in his absence. Mr. Morley\r\nrefused to fall into the trap. Speaking quietly, but with a deadly blow\r\nbetween every word, he declined to be a party to obstruction by\r\nanswering again questions which had already been answered many times\r\nover. At this, there was a loud shout of approval from the Liberal\r\nbenches--exasperated almost beyond endurance by the shameless waste of\r\ntime in which the Tories, aided by Mr. Chamberlain, had indulged in for\r\nso many hours. Mr. Chamberlain professed to be greatly shocked. But the\r\nHouse was not in a mood to stand any more nonsense. Mr. Chamberlain and\r\nMr. Lowther, and the rest of the obstructive gang, had to submit to have\r\nthe vote taken. In the meantime there stood the business of the country\r\nto be done. All its needs, its pressing grievances, its vast chorus of\r\nsighs and wails from wasted lives--rose up and called for justice; but\r\ntricksters, and self-seekers, and horse-jockeys stopped the way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carlton Club echoes.]\r\n\r\nThere were signs of the meeting at the Carlton when the House met on\r\nThursday evening, March 9th. The Tory benches were crowded; the young\r\nbloods were fuller than ever of that self-consciousness to which I have\r\nadverted, and there were signs of movement, excitement, and the spirit\r\nof mischief and evil in all their faces and in their general demeanour.\r\nThere were nearly one hundred questions on the paper--and questions had\r\nbecome a most effective weapon of Obstruction. But there was a certain\r\npeculiarity about the questioning on this Thursday evening. A stranger\r\nto the House would have remarked that all the questions addressed to Mr.\r\nGladstone were asked last. This was not an accidental arrangement. It\r\nwas done in the case of every leader of the House, so as to leave him\r\nmore time before coming down to the House of Commons. It was done in the\r\ncase of Mr. Balfour when he was leader of the House, with the result\r\nthat that very limp and leisurely gentleman never came down to his place\r\nuntil the House had been one or two hours at work. There was, of course,\r\nmuch stronger reason for that little bit of consideration in the case\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, than in that of a young man like Mr. Balfour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The epoch of brutality.]\r\n\r\nBut the Tories, in the new and brutal mood to which they have worked\r\nthemselves up, have taken means for depriving Mr. Gladstone of what\r\nsmall benefit he got from this postponement of the questions to him till\r\nthe end of question time. The puniest whipster of the Tory or the\r\nUnionist party now is satisfied with nothing less, if you please, than\r\nto have his questions addressed to and answered by Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself. One of this impudent tribe is a Scotch Unionist named Cochrane.\r\nThe Scotch Unionist is one of the most bitter of the venomous tribe to\r\nwhich he belongs. Mr. Gladstone is a man of peace and unfailing\r\ncourtesy, but the old lion has potentialities of Olympian wrath, and\r\nwhen he is stirred up a little too much his patience gives way, and he\r\nhas a manner of shaking his mane and sweeping round with his tail which\r\nis dangerous to his enemies and a delight and fascination to his\r\nfriends. He took up the witless and unhappy Cochrane, shook him, and\r\ndropped him sprawling and mutilated, in about as limp a condition as the\r\nlate Lord Wolmer--I call him late in the sense of a person politically\r\ndead--when that distinguished nobleman was called to account for his\r\nodious calumny on the Irish members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baiting the lion.]\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the Cochranes and the rest of the gang that had\r\nthought it fine fun to bait an old man were silenced; but even yet the\r\nordeal of Mr. Gladstone was only beginning. I have seen many disgusting\r\nsights in my time in the House of Commons; but I never saw anything so\r\nbad as this scene. Mr. Gladstone looked--as I thought--wan and rather\r\ntired. He had been down to Brighton; and I have a profound disbelief in\r\nthese short hurried trips to the seaside. But Mr. Gladstone seems to\r\nlike them, and haply they do him good. He looked as if the last trip had\r\nrather tired him out. Or was it that he had had to sit for several hours\r\nthe day before at a Cabinet Council? These Cabinet Councils must often\r\nbe a great trial to a leader's nerves; for all Councils in every body in\r\nthe world mean division of opinion, personal frictions, ugly outbursts\r\nof temper, from which even the celestial minds of political leaders are\r\nnot entirely free. Anyhow Mr. Gladstone looked pale, fagged, and even a\r\nlittle dejected. You--simple man--who are only acquainted with human\r\nnature in its brighter and better manifestations, would rush to the\r\nconclusion that the sight of the greatest man of his time in his\r\neighty-fourth year, thus wan, wearied, pathetic, would appeal to the\r\nimaginations or the hearts of even political opponents. Simple man, you\r\nknow nothing of the ruthless cruelty which dwells in political breasts,\r\nof the savagery which lies in the depths of the horse-jockey squire or\r\nthe overdressed youth--anxious to distinguish himself, if it be only by\r\nthrowing mud at a stately column--you have no idea of these things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lion lashes out.]\r\n\r\nTime after time--again and again--in this form and in that--the Tories,\r\nyoung and old, experienced and senseless, rose to try and corner Mr.\r\nGladstone. Mr. Frank Lockwood, examining a hostile witness in the\r\ndivorce court, could not have been more persistent than the Lowthers,\r\nand the Cranbornes, and even Mr. Balfour. But he was equal to them\r\nall--met them man after man, question after question, and, though he had\r\nto be on his feet a score of times in the course of a few minutes, was\r\nalways ready, firm, alert. How we enjoyed the whole splendid display--a\r\nbrilliant intellect playing with all the ease of its brightest and best\r\npowers; but, after all, what a flood of holy rage the whole thing was\r\ncalculated to rouse in any but rancorous breasts. However, we had our\r\nrevenge. The resurgence of Jimmy Lowther seems to be a phenomenon, as\r\ndisturbing to his friends as to his foes. The ugly necessity for sharing\r\nresponsibility for his vulgar and senseless excesses has come home to\r\nMr. Balfour. There was something very like a scene this night between\r\nhim and the Newmarket steward. Mr. Balfour was ready to accept the\r\nassurances which had been given to him by Mr. Gladstone--assurances\r\nwhich, if anything, erred on the side of conciliation--but Jimmy has\r\nentered on the frenzied campaign of obstruction to all and everything\r\nwhich his dull, narrow, and obstinate mind has mistaken for high policy.\r\nThis led to a strange and striking scene. Mr. Balfour, speaking on some\r\nquestion, was interrupted by Mr. Lowther--and then, in front of the\r\nwhole House--in words which everybody could hear, with gesture of his\r\nwhole arm--sweeping, indignant, irritated--the gesture with which a\r\nmaster dismisses an importunate servant--the Tory leader rebuked the\r\ninterruptions of Mr. Lowther.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jimmy flouts Mr. Balfour.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Lowther, in these days, is not to be put down, and doubtless he\r\nfeels in his inner breast that wrong which has been done for years to\r\nhis talents and his services; doubtless he remembers the silence and\r\nobscurity to which he has been condemned, while Mr. Balfour has been\r\nfiguring largely before the general public, in the very situation which\r\nJimmy held himself in days when Mr. Balfour stumbled and trembled from\r\nhis place below the gangway. At all events, Jimmy has determined to\r\nrevive; and in these sad days, when nothing but the sheer brutality of\r\nobstruction is required, he is not a man to be trifled with. And so he\r\ndefied Mr. Balfour and insisted on a division. Mr. Balfour\r\nostentatiously left the House, but the majority of the Tory party\r\nfollowed Jimmy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pity of it.]\r\n\r\nAll this resuscitation of obstruction necessitated, on Mr. Gladstone's\r\npart, an extreme step. Before this time Mr. Gladstone was very rarely in\r\nthe House after eight o'clock. About that hour, he silently stole away\r\nand left the conduct of the business of the House to Sir William\r\nHarcourt. He was thus able to get to bed at a reasonable hour, and to\r\nattend during the day to the business of the nation. But when the\r\nemergency arises, Mr. Gladstone is never able to listen to the dictates\r\nof prudence, or selfishness, or peril. He was determined to show the\r\nTories that if they were going to play the game of obstruction, they\r\nwould have to count with him more seriously than they imagine. To his\r\nfriends--who doubtless were aghast at the proposition--he announced that\r\nhe was going to break through those rules which had been imposed upon\r\nhim by a watchful physician and by his age. At eleven o'clock he\r\nannounced he would be in the House again, and accordingly, at eleven\r\no'clock--quietly, unostentatiously, without the welcome of a cheer--he\r\nalmost stole to his place on the Treasury Bench. Something about the\r\nfigure of Mr. Gladstone compels the concentration of attention upon him\r\nat all times. He seems the soul, the inspiration, the genius of the\r\nHouse of Commons. He was not, as is usually the case with him in the\r\nevening, in the swallow-tail and large shirt-front of evening dress; he\r\nhad the long, black, frock coat, which he usually wears on the great\r\noccasions when he has a mighty speech to deliver. Of course, Mr.\r\nGladstone was immediately the observed of every eye; but, as I have\r\nsaid, there was no demonstration--the House of Commons is often silent\r\nat its most sublime moments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He pounces.]\r\n\r\nBut if there were silence, it was simply pent-up rage, fierce resolve.\r\nWhen, having brought the discussion down to past midnight, the Tories\r\ncalmly proposed that the debate should be adjourned, the Old Man got up.\r\nHe was very quiet, spoke almost in whispered lowliness; but he was\r\nunmistakable. The vote would have to be taken. An hour later--when the\r\nclock pointed to one--there was a second attempt. There was the same\r\nresponse in the same tone--its quietness, however, fiercely accentuated\r\nby Liberal cheers. And then, when the Tories still seemed determined to\r\nobstruct, came a division, then the closure, and at one o'clock in the\r\nmorning Mr. Gladstone was able to leave the House. Thus was he compelled\r\nto waste time and strength, that Mr. Chamberlain might nightly hiss his\r\nhate, and Mr. Jimmy Lowther might gulp and obstruct, obstruct and gulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGLADSTONE THE SURVIVAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: From the past.]\r\n\r\nWhat I like most about Mr. Gladstone is his antique spirituality. The\r\nmodern politician is smart, alive, pert, up-to-date; knows everything\r\nabout registration; hires a good agent; can run a caucus, and receive a\r\ndeputation. With us, as yet, the modern politician has not wholly\r\nabandoned religious faith--as he has done among our neighbours on the\r\nContinent--and has not come to regard this solid earth of ours as the\r\none standing-place in a universe alone worthy the consideration of\r\nintelligent men. But the English politician is so far suffused with the\r\nspirit of modernity as to prefer the newspaper to the book, to regard\r\nmore closely registration records than the classics, and generally is\r\nwide awake rather than steeped in subtler and profounder forms of\r\nsagacity and knowledge. The Prime Minister is a Survival. With all his\r\nextraordinary adaptiveness, he stands in many respects in sharpest\r\ncontrast to his environment. I can never forget, as I look at him, all\r\nthose years he spent in that vanished epoch which knew nothing of\r\nevolution or of science at all, and was content to regard a knowledge of\r\nthe classics as the beginning and the end of a gentleman's education.\r\nAfter reading the life of Lord Aberdeen, I was brought back in spirit to\r\nall those years during which Mr. Gladstone was a member of the Tory\r\nparty, and lived in an atmosphere of proud, scholarly exclusiveness--of\r\ndistrust of the multitude--of ecclesiasticism in the home, in the forum,\r\nand as the foundation of all political controversy. When, therefore, Mr.\r\nGladstone is going through a crisis, it is intensely interesting to me\r\nto watch him and to see how he carries himself amid it all; and then it\r\nis that this thought occurs to me of how differently and clearly he\r\nstands out from all his colleagues and surroundings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A reminiscence.]\r\n\r\nDifferent things suggest early associations to different people. Mrs.\r\nSolness, in the \"Master Builder,\" could think only of her dolls when she\r\nwas telling the story of the fire that left her childless for ever. I\r\nhave heard of a great lady who cannot see a shell without recalling the\r\nscenes of her dead youth before her. Next to the railway bridge which\r\nspans the river in my native town, there is nothing which brings back\r\nthe past to me so palpably and so vividly--I might sometimes say, so\r\npoignantly--as the echoes of books. One of my clearest recollections is\r\nof a little room, looking out on a sunny and, as it appeared to me then,\r\na beautifully-kept garden, with a small but glistening river in the\r\ndistance, and the air filled, not only with the songs of birds, but all\r\nthe intoxicating and inaudible music of youth's dreams and visions. All\r\nthis phantasmagoria of memory is accompanied by the echo of a melodious,\r\nrich voice, rising and falling, in the to me unfamiliar but delightful\r\naccent of an educated Englishman: and the story of Ancient\r\nGreece--sometimes her poetry with the loves of her gods, the fights, the\r\nshouts of battle, the exhortations and the groans of her heroes--rises\r\nonce more before me. Or, again, I hear the tale told anew of that great\r\nlast immortal day in the life of Socrates, as the great Philosopher sank\r\nto rest in a glory of self-sacrificing submission, serenity, and\r\ncourage--a story which moves the world to tears and admiration, and will\r\ncontinue so to do as long as it endures. The voice of the teacher and\r\nthe friend still survives, which had this extraordinary power of giving\r\nin the very different tongue of England all the glories of the poetry\r\nand the prose of Greece; and other youths, doubtless like me, look out\r\nunder the spell of its music to that same green garden in far-off\r\nGalway, by the side of Corrib's stream.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gladstone dreams.]\r\n\r\nOf all this I sate musing during some idle moments in the middle of\r\nMarch; for, as I looked at Mr. Gladstone, the whole scene was, by a\r\ncurious trick of memory and association, brought back to me. Everyone\r\nwho knew the great old Philosopher of Athens, will remember that he had\r\nhis familiar _dæmon_, and that he believed himself to have constant\r\ncommunication with him. If I remember rightly, there is a good deal\r\nabout that _dæmon_ in his \"Phædo\"--that wonderful story to which I have\r\njust alluded, and which lives so vividly in my memory. Sometimes I think\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone has the same superstition. He has moments--especially\r\nif there be the stress of the sheer brutality of obstructive and knavish\r\nhostility--when he seems to retire into himself--to transfer himself on\r\nthe wings of imagination to regions infinitely beyond the reach, as well\r\nas the ken, of the land in which the Lowthers, the Chamberlains, and the\r\nBartleys dwell. At such moments he gives one the impression of communing\r\nwith some spirit within his own breast--a familiar _dæmon_, whose voice,\r\nthough still and silent to all outside, shouts louder than the roar of\r\nfaction or the shouts of brutish hate. Then it is that I remember what\r\ndepths of religious fervour there are in this leader of a fierce\r\ndemocracy, and can imagine that ofttimes his communings may, perchance,\r\nbe silent prayer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In contrast with Lowther.]\r\n\r\nAs I have said, there have been many such moments in those days in\r\nParliament. Mr. Gladstone can be severe--wrathful--even cruel. It is not\r\noften that he is so, but sometimes he has, in sheer self-defence, to\r\nnotice the dogs that yelp at his heels, and to lash out and maul them so\r\nas to keep off the rest. Nobody will forget how, in a few words, Mr.\r\nGladstone mercilessly and for ever crushed that impudent young\r\ngentleman, who is titled and considered to-day largely because Mr.\r\nGladstone was the patron of his sanctimonious father. Mr. Jesse Collings\r\nhides under a painfully extorted smile the agonies he endures on the few\r\noccasions when Mr. Gladstone deems it worth his while to scornfully\r\nrefer to his apostasy. But, speaking generally, Mr. Gladstone uses his\r\ngiant powers with extraordinary benignity and mercifulness, and is\r\nalmost tender with even his bitterest opponents. When, therefore, Mr.\r\nGladstone was being baited by beef-headed Lowther, he for the most part\r\nlooked simply pained; and took refuge in that far-off self-absorption\r\nwhich enabled him to forget the odious reality in front of him. And\r\nassuredly, if you looked at the face of Gladstone, and then at the face\r\nof Lowther, and thought of the different purposes of the two men, you\r\ncould not be surprised that Mr. Gladstone should desire to forget the\r\nexistence of Mr. Lowther. Mr. Lowther's face, with its high cheek-bones,\r\nits heavy underhung lip, like the national bulldog in size, and in its\r\nimpression of brutal, dull, heavy tenacity--its grotesque\r\ngood-humour--its unrelieved coarseness--brings out into higher contrast\r\nand bolder relief the waxen pallor, the beautifully chiselled features,\r\nthe dominant benignity and refinement of the face of Mr. Gladstone. And,\r\nthen, think that the one man is fighting to maintain, and the other to\r\nput an end, and for ever, to the hateful, bloody, and, it might almost\r\nbe said, bestial struggle of centuries; and you can understand the\r\nfeeling of overwhelming loathing which sometimes rises in the breasts of\r\nthose who see the two men pitted against each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: For Jimmy was leader.]\r\n\r\nFor this was what it had come to in the House of Commons. It was Jimmy\r\nLowther against Mr. Gladstone. Mr. Balfour occasionally dropped in a\r\nperfunctory word; now and then even tried to raise the standard of\r\nrevolt against Mr. Lowther; and, of course, had finally to accept the\r\nconsequences of Mr. Lowther's acts. Joe was there too; much more active\r\nin sympathy with Jimmy than Mr. Balfour. With all his faults, there is\r\na certain saving refinement in Mr. Balfour--it is not a refinement that\r\nhas restrained him from being cruel with the hysteric violence of the\r\neffeminate, but it is a refinement that preserves him from the mere\r\nNewmarket horseplay of Jimmy Lowther, and the thin rancour of a\r\nBrummagem drummer. Joe, I say, was there, ready to back up Jimmy in his\r\nworst exploits, but, after all, Jimmy was the leader. In this mighty\r\nstruggle--not merely for the reconciliation of England and Ireland, but\r\nfor the existence of Parliamentary institutions--the stakes are no\r\nsmaller--the gentlemen of England were represented by Mr. Lowther, and\r\nthe rude democracy by Mr. Gladstone. Democrats need not feel much\r\nashamed of the contrast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The apotheosis of Jimmy.]\r\n\r\nBut there Jimmy Lowther was, gulping and obstructing, obstructing and\r\ngulping. The deadly and almost animal dulness of the performance I must\r\ninsist on again and again. Mr. Lowther does not speak--he is as\r\ninarticulate as one of the prize bulls which, I doubt not, he delights\r\nto view at Islington what time the Agricultural Hall opens its portals\r\nto fat men and fat beasts. He cannot stand on his legs for five minutes\r\ntogether without saying half-a-dozen times, \"I repeat what I have\r\nalready said;\" he has no ideas, no language, nothing except sheer\r\nbull-headed power of standing on his legs, and occupying a certain\r\namount of time. Everybody knows that Lowtherism reached its climax on\r\nSaturday, March 11th. On that day, men, who had held high office, were\r\nnot ashamed to resort to so mean and palpable an obstructive expedient\r\nas to put on paper twenty-two questions to their successors in office.\r\nThe previous Friday had been bad enough. That was the day which tried\r\nMr. Gladstone more, perhaps, than any day for many a year; and, indeed,\r\nit tried others as much as he, though not everybody bore it with the\r\nsame iron and inflexible courage. There were large absences--some of the\r\nIrish away at conventions in Ireland, others without that legitimate\r\nexcuse; there were Liberal absentees as well. Obstruction, meantime,\r\nstalked triumphantly; and when the divisions came, our strength sank\r\ndown to almost invisible figures. Ah! it was saddening to look at Mr.\r\nGladstone's face throughout that long morning sitting of Friday, March\r\n10th. There are some days that live in one's memory, not so much as days\r\nas nights--with the ghastly spectres of darkness--nightmares--hauntings\r\nof a hideous past--anticipations of a joyless future. Such that Friday\r\nremains in my memory--with Mr. Gladstone's face standing out from the\r\nsurrounding figures--pale, remote, pained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The G.O.M. as a lecturer.]\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the following Monday came only as a surprise to\r\nthose who had not been fully behind the scenes. There were few, who knew\r\nthe impression that the Friday had made, who did not feel sure that the\r\ngame of pushing the Home Rule Bill on before Easy Easter was up, and\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone had been beaten by the sheer brutality of\r\nObstruction. But still hope springs eternal in the Irish breast, and\r\nthere was still the lingering feeling that Mr. Gladstone would make a\r\nfurther and more desperate effort to break down one of the most\r\nshameless crusades of Obstruction on which a great party had ever\r\nentered. Indeed, Mr. Gladstone himself was responsible for a rise in the\r\ntemperature of his own party on the very evening of that fateful and\r\nfatal Friday morning, when obstruction and the abandonment of their own\r\nfriends had so nearly driven the Government out of office. I could\r\nscarcely believe my eyes when at nine o'clock on that day I came down to\r\nthe almost empty House--in these evening sittings the House always looks\r\nabout as cheerful as a theatre at mid-day--and saw Mr. Gladstone on the\r\nTreasury Bench, almost radiant, and evidently full of speech, go, and\r\nspirit. There wasn't really the smallest necessity for his presence.\r\nNothing stood on the paper save one of those harmless, futile motions\r\nwhich are discussed with about as much interest by the House generally,\r\nas \"abstract love\"--to use a bold figure of Labby in a recent debate.\r\nIt was a motion which complained that private members did not get\r\nsufficient time. Considering that private members had used their\r\nprivileges for some two weeks previously to destroy the very foundation\r\nof all representative Government--namely, that the majority shall\r\nprevail--the complaint seemed a little audacious. Anyhow, a debate upon\r\nit could lead nowhere. But the moment the resolution was proposed, up\r\nstood the Grand Old Man, and delivered a bright, sparkling little\r\nacademical address, for all the world like the lecture of a very\r\n_spirituel_ French professor to a parcel of boys from the Quartier\r\nLatin. For the moment you could actually imagine that the Old Man had\r\nforgotten that there were such things in the world as Home Rule,\r\nObstruction, Newmarket Lowther, and Brummagem Joe. And all the time here\r\nwere we, who could be his sons, grinding our hearts in despair--in\r\nfutile anger--in melancholy retrospect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An hour of gloom.]\r\n\r\nWith the Monday, however, came a biting frost. The news that Mr.\r\nGladstone had been struck down from the fray, was sufficient to prepare\r\nanybody for the final announcement. With him leading the Liberal hosts,\r\none could feel that obstruction could finally be beaten, however\r\nobstinate might be its resistance--for he has the faith that moves\r\nmountains. Then came the announcement that the second reading of the\r\nHome Rule Bill had been postponed till after Easter. The Tories and the\r\nUnionists were apparently taken by surprise; so much so that they did\r\nnot seem to have the power of yelling forth their delight at the triumph\r\nof their policy with that full chorus which one would have expected.\r\nAltogether, the announcement came upon the House, and passed the House,\r\nwith a quickness and a greater quietness than one might have expected.\r\nThe consequences were too serious to be grasped immediately; and men\r\nwere almost anxious to get to the lobbies for the purpose of discussing\r\nit in all its bearings.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the week was but a poor falling-off after the heroic and\r\ntragic fever of its opening, and of the week which preceded it. One\r\ncould see that in the Liberal ranks there had succeeded to the fierce\r\nfighting spirit of the previous days a certain lassitude and\r\ndisappointment. What their faces told in the House their lips more\r\nfreely uttered in the lobbies. For a time, indeed, there was a feeling\r\nof almost unreasoning despair, and that full, frank, unsparing criticism\r\nto which every Government is subject from its friends when the winds\r\nblow and the waves are high. It was said that the Government had\r\ncommitted the mistake of making too many targets at once; that they had\r\nfirst infuriated the Church by the Welsh Suspensory Bill; that they had\r\nfollowed this up by infuriating the publicans and the brewers by the\r\nVeto Bill; that, meantime, there was very little chance of their being\r\nable to obtain the compensatory advantage of getting these Bills passed\r\ninto law. There were grumblings about the Registration Bill; in short,\r\nnothing and nobody were spared in this hour of gloom and disaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Herr Schloss.\"]\r\n\r\nBut the House of Commons--as I have often remarked--is like a barometer\r\nin the promptitude of its reflection of every momentary phase, and all\r\nthese things are duly discounted by old Parliamentary hands accustomed\r\nto panics when a check comes to what has been a most successful campaign\r\non the whole. And in the meantime, if there had been any tendency to\r\ndisintegration, it was soon restored by the conduct of the Tories. For,\r\nthe old game of obstruction and vituperation went on just as strongly as\r\nif no concession had been made, and no victory gained. The Monday night\r\nhad been reserved for a debate on the Evicted Tenants' Commission. And\r\nMr. T.W. Russell, brimful of notes and venom, sate in his place, as\r\nimpatient to rise as the captive and exuberant balloon which only strong\r\nropes and the knotted arms of men hold tight to mother earth. Jimmy,\r\nhowever, has a passion for his ignoble calling; he sings at his work\r\nlike the gravedigger in \"Hamlet.\" And before the inflated Russell was\r\nable to explode, Jimmy had an hour or so to himself in the discussion\r\nof Mr. Mundella's efforts to deal with labour. It was on this occasion\r\nthat Jimmy spread something like dismay in the bench on which he sate.\r\nMr. Schloss, who had been appointed as a correspondent by Mr. Mundella,\r\nhas a name which shows a German origin. Jimmy insisted on speaking of\r\nhim accordingly as \"Herr Schloss.\" And there, not a yard from Jimmy,\r\nsate the Baron de Worms, one of the most portentous and pretentious of\r\nEnglish patriots, who bears not only a German name, but a German title.\r\nI don't know whether \"Herr\" Goschen was in the House at the same time;\r\nif so, his feelings must have been very poignant. Mr. Mundella doesn't\r\nknow how to treat these Obstructives. The main thing is not to take them\r\nseriously. Jimmy, to tell the truth, makes no pretence of taking himself\r\nseriously, and grins through a horse-collar most of the time he is\r\nspeaking. But the poor President of the Board of Trade is conscious of\r\ndoing everything man can do to help to the solution of the vexed\r\nquestions of the time. He cannot avoid allowing himself to be worked up\r\ninto a frenzy by imputations which he ought to know are simply intended\r\nfor the purpose of getting him out of temper, and so prolonging debate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Gorst.]\r\n\r\nSir John Gorst is one of the men who have again been brought much into\r\nevidence by the turn events have taken. I remember the time when he\r\nfirst made a Parliamentary figure. It was in the days when Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill started out on his great and meteoric career, at the beginning\r\nof the Parliament of '80. Sir John Gorst was, in many respects, the\r\ncleverest of the brilliant little group--at least, at the work which\r\nthey were then doing. He is cold-blooded, quick, and dexterous, and,\r\nabove all things, he has supreme pessimism and cynicism. To him, all\r\npolitical warfare is a somewhat squalid struggle, in which everybody is\r\ndishonest, and everybody playing for his own hand. It is an advantage in\r\nsome respects to take that view; it saves a man from anything like\r\nunduly passionate convictions--enables him to keep cool even in trying\r\ncircumstances. I have seen Sir John as cold as ice in the very height\r\nand ecstasy of the most passionate moments in the fierce Parliament of\r\n1880 to 1885, and a man who remains so cool is sure to be able to strike\r\nhis blows deliberately and home. My poor friend, Mr. Mundella, sometimes\r\nforgets this. When Sir John Gorst accused him of slighting somebody--I\r\ndon't know who; and, really, it doesn't matter, for Sir John Gorst knew\r\nvery well that the charge was entirely unfounded--when, I say, Sir John\r\ndid this, up jumped honest Mr. Mundella to indignantly deny that he had\r\never done anything of the kind. Of course, he hadn't, and Sir John Gorst\r\nknew that as well as Mr. Mundella. But then, ten minutes were wasted in\r\nthe encounter; and even ten minutes are not despised by Jimmy and his\r\ncompeers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: T.W. Russell.]\r\n\r\nAt last, this was got over, and the time came for T.W. Russell. There\r\nare few men in the House of Commons who excite such violent dislike on\r\nLiberal and Irish Benches as this pre-eminently disagreeable\r\npersonality. The dislike is well founded. It is not because Mr. Russell\r\nis rancorous, or has strong opinions; it is because nobody has any faith\r\nin his sincerity. For many years of his life he was a paid teetotal\r\nlecturer. Teetotalism is a counsel of perfection, and teetotallers are\r\nestimable men, but the paid platform advocate of teetotalism is never a\r\nvery attractive personality. This tendency to shout, and thump the\r\ntable, and work up the agony--this eternal pitching of the voice to the\r\nscream that will terrify the groundlings, appal the sinner, and bring\r\ndown the house--all these things produce a style of oratory which is\r\nabout as disagreeable as anything in the shape of oratory can be. Above\r\nall things, it is difficult to take the itinerant lecturer seriously,\r\nwith his smoking meal at home as a reward for his philanthropic efforts.\r\nThe whole thing produces on the mind the impression of a clap-trap\r\nperformance, with no heart or soul underneath all its ravings,\r\nbellowings, and dervish-like contortions.\r\n\r\nMr. Russell has ceased to be a teetotal lecturer, and has become a stump\r\norator for the Unionist party, but the scent of the teetotal platform\r\nhangs round him still. He yells, bellows, and twists himself about, puts\r\nall his statements with ridiculous exaggeration--altogether, so overdoes\r\nthe part that it is only the wildest and emptiest Tory who is taken in\r\nby him. What spoils the whole thing to my mind is that it is all so\r\nevidently artificial--so palpably pumped up. Clapping his hand on his\r\nbreast, lifting his shaky fingers to Heaven, Mr. Russell is always in a\r\nfrenzied protestation of honesty, of rugged and unassailable virtue, of\r\nbitter vaticination against the wickedness of the rest of mankind. No\r\nman could be as honest as he professes to be, and live. The whole thing\r\nwould be exquisite acting if, underneath all this conscious\r\nexaggeration, you did not see the mere political bravo. You turn\r\nsometimes, and sicken as though you were at the country fair, and saw\r\nthe poor raucous-throated charlatan eating fire or swallowing swords to\r\nthe hideous accompaniments of the big drum and the deafening cymbal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Carson.]\r\n\r\nNo--Mr. T.W. Russell is the mere play-actor. If you want one of the real\r\nactualities in the more sinister side of Irish life, look at and study\r\nMr. Carson. It is he who winds up the debate on the commission of Mr.\r\nJustice Mathew--a debate made memorable by the ablest debating speech\r\nMr. Morley has made in the whole course of his Parliamentary career. I\r\nsee men talking to Mr. Carson that belong to an opposite side of\r\npolitics. I confess that I never see him pass without an internal\r\nshudder. Just as the sight of an abbé gave M. Homais, in \"Madame\r\nBovary,\" an unpleasant whiff of the winding-sheet, there is something in\r\nthe whole appearance of Mr. Carson that conveys to me the dank smell of\r\nthe prison, and the suffocating sense of the scaffold. Do you remember\r\nthat strange, terrible day in the \"Dernière Incarnation de Vautrin,\" in\r\nwhich Balzac describes Vautrin's passage through the ranks of the\r\ngaol-birds and gaol officials among whom he had passed so much of his\r\nlife? Above all, do you recall that final, and supreme, and awful touch\r\nin which, addressing consciously the handler of the guillotine, he\r\nprofesses to take him for the chaplain, and, bringing the poor\r\nexecutioner for once to confusion, is addressed with blushing face and\r\ntrembling lips with the observation, \"Non, Monsieur, j'ai d'autres\r\nfonctions\"?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Green Street Court-House.]\r\n\r\nMr. Carson, doubtless, has \"autres fonctions\" than that of Jack\r\nKetch--who has always been so efficient and constant an instrument of\r\nGovernment in Ireland--but I am never able to regard one part of the\r\nofficial machinery by which wronged nations are held down as very\r\ndifferent from the other. Above all, I am unable to make much\r\ndistinction between the final agent in the gaol and those other actors\r\nwho play with loaded dice the bloody game in the criminal court with the\r\npartisan judge and the packed jury. Doubtless, happy reader, you have\r\nnever been in a place called Green Street Court-House, in Dublin. If you\r\never go to the Irish capital, pay that spot a visit. It will compensate\r\nyou--especially if you can get some _cicerone_ who will tell you some of\r\nthe associations that cling around the spot. It is in a back\r\nstreet--narrow, squalid, filthy--surrounded by all those signs of\r\ncrumbling decay which speak more loudly to the visitor to Dublin of the\r\ndecay and destruction of a nation than fieriest orator or solidest\r\nhistory. And in no part of Dublin have Death's effacing fingers worked\r\nwith such destructiveness as in all the streets that surround the Green\r\nStreet Court-House. Palatial mansions are windowless, grimy,\r\nhideous--with all the ghastly surroundings of tenement homes of the very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nIt is in Green Street Court-House that the political offenders in\r\nIreland are tried. Within its narrow and grimy walls I saw many a\r\ngallant Irishman, when I was a young reporter, pass through a foregone\r\nand prearranged trial to torture, agony, madness, premature death. I\r\ncan only think of it as of a shambles, or, perhaps, to put it more\r\nstrongly, but more accurately, as I think of that wooden framework in\r\nwhich I saw the murderer, Henry Wainwright, hanged by the neck one foggy\r\nmorning years ago, a gallows. The jury was packed, and the judges on the\r\nbench were as much a part of the machinery of prosecution as the Counsel\r\nfor the Crown. The whole thing was a ghastly farce--as ghastly as the\r\nprivate enquiries that intervene between the Russian rebel and the\r\nhunger, and solitude, and death of the fortress of St. Peter and St.\r\nPaul, or the march to Siberia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lawyer and the hangman.]\r\n\r\nIn all such squalid tragedies, men of the Carson type are a necessary\r\nportion of the machinery, as necessary as the informer that betrays--as\r\nthe warder who locks the door--as the hangman who coils the rope. Mark\r\nyou, all the forms--all the precautions--all the outward seeming of\r\nEnglish law and liberty--are in these Irish courts. The outside is just\r\nthe same as in any court that meets in the Old Bailey; but it is all the\r\nmask and the drapery, behind which the real figures are the foregone\r\nverdict, the partisan judge--the prepared cell or constructed gallows.\r\nIn the regime of coercion which has just expired, the whole machinery\r\nwas in motion. The last sentence of the law was not resorted to in\r\npolitical offence, for the days of rebellion in the open field had\r\npassed. But there were the Resident Magistrates ready to do their master\r\nBalfour's bidding, and to send men to imprisonment, in some cases\r\nfollowed by bread-and-water discipline--by stripping of clothes and\r\nother atrocities, which made the court of the Resident Magistrate the\r\nantechamber to the cell, and the cell the antechamber to the tomb. In\r\nall these ghastly and tragic dramas, enacted all over Ireland, Mr.\r\nCarson was the chief figure--self-confident, braggart,\r\ndeliberate--winding the rope around his victim's neck with all the\r\nassured certainty of the British Empire, Mr. Balfour and the Resident\r\nMagistrates behind him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Carson's exterior.]\r\n\r\nNature has stamped on Mr. Carson's exterior the full proclamation of his\r\ncharacter and career. There is something about his appearance and manner\r\nthat somehow or other seems to belong rather to the last than the\r\npresent century. He is a very up-to-date gentleman in every sense of the\r\nword--clothes included. But the long, lantern, black-coloured jaws, the\r\nprotruding mouth, the cavernous eyes, the high forehead with the hair\r\ncombed straight back--all seem to suggest that he ought to be wearing\r\nthe wig, the queue, and the sword of the eighteenth century. He looks as\r\nthough he had come from consultation, not with Mr. Balfour, but Lord\r\nCastlereagh, and as if the work he were engaged in was the sending of\r\nthe Brothers Sheares to Tyburn, not William O'Brien to Tullamore, and as\r\nthough he had stopped up o' nights to go over again the list of the\r\nIrishmen that could be bought or bullied, or cajoled into the betrayal\r\nof Ireland's Parliament.\r\n\r\nLook at him as he stands at the box. You can see that he has been bred\r\ninto almost impudent self-confidence, by those coercion tribunals, in\r\nwhich the best men of Ireland lay at the mercy of a creature like Mr.\r\nBalfour and the meaner creatures who were ready to do Mr. Balfour's\r\nwork. Mr. Carson, not a year in the House, places his hands on the box,\r\nthen on his hips, with all the airs of a man who had been in Parliament\r\nfor a lifetime--attacks Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Morley, Mr. Justice\r\nMathew--three of the highest-minded and ablest men of their time--as\r\nthough he were at Petty Sessions, with Mr. Cecil Roche dispensing\r\njustice. It is an odious sight. It makes even Englishmen shudder. But it\r\nhas its uses. It throws on to the floor of the House of Commons with all\r\nthe illumination of those great times, the abysses and passions and\r\nsinister figures in Ireland's moving tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA FORTNIGHT OF QUIET WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dulness.]\r\n\r\nThe House did very good work during the last fortnight in March. This\r\nhas a corollary more satisfactory to the public than to the journalist;\r\nfor, whenever business is progressing, it invariably means that the\r\nproceedings have been extremely dull. It is a well-known phenomenon of\r\nthe House of Commons, that the moment there is a chance of anything like\r\na personal scene--though the encounter be of the smallest possible\r\nmoment and affect nothing beyond two personalities of no particular\r\nimportance--it is well known that whenever such scene is promised, the\r\nbenches of the House of Commons prove too small for the huge crowds that\r\nrush to them from all parts. Mr. Fowler introduced one of the most\r\nrevolutionary measures ever brought into the House of\r\nCommons--revolutionary I mean, of course, in the good sense--and yet he\r\ndelivered his new gospel of emancipation to a House that at no period\r\nwas in the least crowded, and that was never excited. Happy is the\r\ncountry that has no annals, fruitful is the Parliament that has no\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Uganda again.]\r\n\r\nBut there were signs of something like storm at certain portions of the\r\nsitting on March 20th, for there stood on the paper the Estimate which\r\nraised the difficult question of Uganda, and on that question, as\r\neverybody knows, there is a yawning gulf between the opinions of Mr.\r\nLabouchere and a number of Radicals below the gangway, and the\r\noccupants of the Treasury Bench. Of Mr. Labouchere the saying may be\r\nused, which is often employed with regard to weak men--Mr. Labouchere is\r\nfar from a weak man--he is his own worst enemy. His delight in\r\npersiflage, his keen wit--his love of the pose of the bloodless and\r\ncynical Boulevardier--have served to conceal from Parliament, and\r\nsometimes, perhaps, even from himself, the sincerity of his convictions,\r\nand the masculine strength and firmness of his will. Somehow or other,\r\nhe is least effective when he is most serious. His speech on Uganda, for\r\ninstance, was admirably put together, and chock full of facts, sound in\r\nargument, and in its seriousness quite equal to the magnitude of the\r\nissues which it raised. But no man is allowed to play \"out of his\r\npart\"--as the German phrase goes. Labby has accustomed the House to\r\nexpect amusement from him, and it will not be satisfied unless he gives\r\nit. When, therefore, he does make a serious speech, the House insists on\r\nconsidering it dull, and rarely lends to him its attentive and serious\r\near.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Which is the buffoon?]\r\n\r\nGreat and yet fatal is the power of oratory. In the course of this same\r\nnight's debate, Mr. Chamberlain also made a speech. During portions of\r\nit he delighted the House, and it was extremely effective as a party\r\nspeech. In the course of his observations, Mr. Chamberlain, alluding to\r\nsome jokelet of Labby, declared that a great question like Uganda should\r\nnot be treated in a spirit of \"buffoonery.\" That observation was rude,\r\nand scarcely Parliamentary. But that is not the point--nobody expects\r\ngentlemanly feeling or speech from Mr. Chamberlain. The point is that\r\nthe observation could have been applied with much more truth to the\r\nspeech of Mr. Chamberlain than to that of Labby; for Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nspeech consisted, for the most part, of nothing better than the merest\r\nparty hits--the kind of thing that almost anybody could say--that\r\nhundreds of journalists nightly write in their party effusions, and for\r\nvery modest salaries. But the heart and soul of the question of Uganda\r\nwere not even touched by Mr. Chamberlain. Labby may have been right or\r\nwrong; but Labby's was a serious speech with a serious purpose. Mr.\r\nChamberlain's speech was just a smart bit of party debating. The\r\nbuffoonery--in the sense of shallowness and emptiness--was really in the\r\nspeech that everybody took to be grave. The seriousness was in the\r\nspeech which, amid the delighted applause of the Tories, Mr. Chamberlain\r\ndenounced as buffoonery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The grip of Labby.]\r\n\r\nIn some respects Mr. Labouchere reminds me of the late Mr. Biggar.\r\nUnderneath all his exterior of carelessness, callousness, and flippancy,\r\nthere lies a very strong, a very tenacious, and a very clear-sighted\r\nman. There are times--especially when the small hours of the morning are\r\nbreaking, and Labby is in his most genial mood--when he is ready to\r\ndeclare that, after all, he is only a Conservative in disguise, and that\r\nhis Radicalism is merely put on for the purpose of amusing and catching\r\nthe groundlings. As a matter of fact, Labby is by instinct one of the\r\nmost thorough Radicals that ever breathed. His Radicalism, it is true,\r\nis of the antique pattern. He is an individualist without compromise or\r\nconcession. Life to him is to the strongest; he has no faith save in the\r\ngospel of the survival of the fittest. Equable and even cheery, he does\r\nnot take a particularly joyous view of human existence. I have heard him\r\nspeak of the emptiness and futilities of human existence in tones, not\r\nof gloom, for he is too much of a philosopher to indulge in regrets, but\r\nwith a hearty sincerity that would do credit to the Trappist monk who\r\nfound everything vanity of vanities in a sinful world. Despising honours\r\nand dignities, he positively loathes outward show; he is a Radical by\r\ninstinct and nature. Though one of the wealthiest men in the House of\r\nCommons, nobody has over known him guilty of one act of ostentation.\r\nProbably he loves power. I have not the smallest doubt that he would\r\nenjoy very well being a Cabinet Minister. But for social distinction,\r\nfor the frippery and display of life, he has a positive dislike. He is\r\nlike Mr. Biggar also in tenacity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the grit.]\r\n\r\nIt must have been a disappointment to him--it was certainly a\r\ndisappointment to his many friends--that he was not a member of the\r\nMinistry which he did so much to bring into existence. But the very day\r\nthe House met after the formation of the Government, Labby was in his\r\nold place on the front bench below the gangway as if nothing had\r\noccurred--just as ready as ever to take his share in the proceedings of\r\nthe House of Commons. And every succeeding evening saw him in his\r\nplace--listening with commendable piety to the exhortations of Holy\r\nWrit--given forth in the fine resonant voice of Archdeacon Farrar--ready\r\nto seize a point--to take advantage of a situation, eagerly interested\r\nin everything that is going on. Some people may regard this as a very\r\ncommon gift. It is nothing of the kind. I know no place in the world\r\nwhich is a severer test of a man's tenacity of purpose, than the House\r\nof Commons. I suppose it is because we see the men more publicly there\r\nthan elsewhere; but I know no place where there are so many ups and\r\ndowns of human destiny as in the House of Commons--no place, at all\r\nevents, where one is so struck with the changes, and transformations of\r\nhuman destinies. The man who, in one or two Sessions, is on his legs\r\nevery moment--who takes a prominent part in every debate--who has become\r\none of the notabilities of the House--in a year or two's time has sunk\r\nto a silent dweller apart from all the eagerness and fever of debate,\r\nsinks into melancholy and listlessness, and is almost dead before he has\r\ngiven up his Parliamentary life. Staying power is the rarest of all\r\nParliamentary powers; Labby has plenty of staying power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Charles Dilke.]\r\n\r\nAnother figure which the new House of Commons is gradually beginning to\r\nunderstand is Sir Charles Dilke. He is one of the men who seem to have\r\nno interest in life outside politics. When one thinks that he has\r\nwealth, an immense number of subjects in which he can find instruction\r\nand occupation, that he is familiar with the languages, literature, and\r\nlife of several countries, it is hard to understand how he could have\r\nhad the endurance to go through the hurricane of abuse and persecution\r\nwhich he has had to encounter in the last seven years. There are traces\r\nin his face of the intense mental suffering through which he has passed;\r\nthere are more lines about the eyes than should be in the case of a man\r\nwho is just fifty. But, otherwise, he positively looks younger than he\r\ndid when he was a Cabinet Minister. There is colour where there used to\r\nbe nothing but deadly pallor--freshness where the long and terrible\r\ndrudgery of official life had left a permanent look of fag and\r\nweariness. Sir Charles Dilke has taken up the broken thread of his life\r\njust as if nothing had occurred in that long period of exile and\r\nsuffering. He is never out of his place: attends every sitting as\r\nconscientiously as if he were in office and responsible for everything\r\nthat is going on; and has his eye on subjects as wide apart as the\r\nparish councils and Newfoundland, army reform and the occupation of\r\nUganda. It is curious to see, too, how he is regaining that ascendancy\r\nover the House of Commons which he exercised formerly. It is an\r\nascendancy not due in the least to oratorical power. Sir Charles Dilke\r\nnever made a fine sentence or a sonorous peroration in his whole life.\r\nIt is that power of acquiring all the facts of the case--of being\r\nthoroughly up in all its merits--in short, of knowing his\r\nbusiness--which impresses the House of Commons, which, after all, though\r\nit may cheer the gibes of a smart and pert debater like Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nis most happy when it hears a man talking of something which he\r\nunderstands thoroughly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe as a Jingo.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain spoke, as I have said, in the debate. It was a very\r\ncharacteristic speech. I know people think I am prejudiced about this\r\ngentleman. Not in the least. I recognize that he has many splendid\r\nqualities for political life. They are not qualities which I think\r\nhighest either in the oratorical or the intellectual sense. He also has\r\nstaying power, and has gone through seven terrible years. There is the\r\ntrace of all the bitterness of that struggle in his face--which has lost\r\nin these years the almost boyish freshness of expression and outline,\r\nwhich bears in every deep line a mark of the ferocity of the passions by\r\nwhich his breast has been torn. He is one of the many men in the House\r\nof Commons that give one the impression of being hunted by the worst and\r\nmost pitiless of all furies--violent personal passion--especially for\r\npower, for triumph, for revenge. But still, there he is--ready as ever\r\nto take part in the struggle--still holding the position he held seven\r\nyears ago--with no sign of weakening or repentance, though there be\r\nplenty of the hunger of baulked revenge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tragedy of politics.]\r\n\r\nWhat a pity it is we can't see some of those great political figures in\r\nthe nudity of their souls. They must have many a bitter moment--many an\r\nhour of dark and hopeless depression--probably far more than other men;\r\nfor them emphatically life is a conflict and a struggle. And the\r\nconflict and the struggle often kill them long before their time. Was\r\nthere ever anything much more tragic than the cry of M. Ferry for \"le\r\ngrand Repos,\" as he lay stifling from the weakening heart which the\r\nbullet of a political enemy and the slings and arrows of years of\r\ncalumny and persecution had at last broken? To any man with ordinary\r\nsensitiveness of nerves, a political career is a crucifixion--many times\r\nrepeated. But Mr. Chamberlain, probably, has not the ordinary\r\nsensitiveness of nerves. Combative, masterful, with narrow and\r\nconcentrated purpose, he pursues the game of politics--not without\r\naffliction, but with persistent tenacity and a courage that have rarely\r\nshown any signs of faltering or failing.\r\n\r\nAll these things must be granted to Mr. Chamberlain; but when I come to\r\nspeak of him intellectually, I cannot see anything in him but a very\r\nperky, smart, glib-tongued \"drummer,\" who is able to pick up the crumbs\r\nof knowledge with extraordinary rapidity, and give them forth again\r\nwith considerable dexterity. He speech on Uganda, so far as its thought\r\nand its phraseology were concerned, was on the level of the profound\r\nutterances with which Sir Ashmead Bartlett tickles and infuriates the\r\ngroundlings of provincial audiences. But it took the House--at least, it\r\ntook the Tories; and, after all, what party orators who have not the\r\nresponsibilities of office have to do, is to get cheers and embarrass\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another hymn to the G.O.M.]\r\n\r\nThe reader must not be either exasperated or bored if he finds\r\ncontinuous mention of the G.O.M. in these pages, for he is, to a great\r\nextent, the House of Commons. I remember hearing Mrs. Gladstone once use\r\nof her distinguished husband a phrase which gave tersely and simply a\r\ncomplete idea of a side of his character. It was just before his\r\nhistoric visit to Birmingham, and there was anxiety as to the vast size\r\nof the great Bingley Hall in which it had been decided he was to speak.\r\n\"He has such heart,\" said Mrs. Gladstone of her husband--meaning that\r\nwhatever was the size of the hall, he would do his best, at whatever\r\ncost, to fill it with his voice. It is this mighty heart of his which\r\ncarries him through everything, and which largely accounts for the hold\r\nhe has over the imaginations and hearts of the masses. Well, one can see\r\nproof of this in his conduct whenever he is leader of a Government.\r\nOther Prime Ministers and leaders of the House are only too willing to\r\nleave as much of the work as possible to their subordinates. Disraeli\r\nused to lie in Oriental calm during the greater part of every sitting,\r\nleaving all his lieutenants to do the drudgery while he dosed and posed.\r\nNot so Gladstone. He is almost literally always on his legs. The biggest\r\nbore--the rudest neophyte--the most gulping obstructive is certain of an\r\nanswer from him--courteous, considerate, and ample. No debate, however\r\nsmall, is too petty for his notice and intervention; in short, he tries\r\nto do not only his own work, but everybody else's.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His justification.]\r\n\r\nI have once or twice gently suggested that I thought the G.O.M. might\r\nleave a little more to his subordinates, and spare that frame and mind\r\nwhich bears the Atlantean burden of the Home Rule struggle. But Mr.\r\nGladstone is able to unexpectedly justify himself when his friends are\r\ncrying out in remonstrance; and it is, too, one of the peculiarities of\r\nthis extraordinary portent of a man--extraordinary physically as much as\r\nmentally--that the more he works, the fresher and happier he seems to\r\nbe. If you see him peculiarly light-hearted; if he be gesticulating with\r\nbroad and generous sweep on the Treasury Bench; if he be whispering to\r\nSir William Harcourt, and then talking almost aloud to Mr. John\r\nMorley--above all, if he be ready to meet all comers, you may be quite\r\nsure that he has just delivered a couple of rattling and lengthy\r\nspeeches, in which, with his deadly skill and perfect temper, he has\r\ndevastated the whole army of false arguments with which his opponents\r\nhave invaded him. So, for instance, it was on March 28th. It was noticed\r\nthat he was not in the House for some hours during the discussion of the\r\nVote on Account. But, as evening approached, there he was in his\r\nplace--fresh, smiling, happy, every limb moving with all the alertness\r\nof auroral youth. In the interval between his first appearance in the\r\nHouse and then later, he had delivered two lengthy speeches to two\r\ndeputations of deadly foes; but he came down after this exertion just as\r\nif he had been playing a game of cricket, and had taken enough physical\r\nexercise to bring blitheness to his spirits and alacrity to his limbs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His unending progress.]\r\n\r\nAnd then the best of it all is that Mr. Gladstone justifies his\r\nspeech-making by improving every hour. It would scarcely seem credible\r\nthat a man with more than half-a-century of speech-making and triumphs\r\nbehind him would have been capable of making any change, and especially\r\nof making a change for the better. But the peculiarity of Mr. Gladstone\r\nis that even as a speaker he grows and improves every day. I have been\r\nwatching him closely now for some sixteen years in the House of Commons,\r\nand I thought that it was impossible for him to ever reach again the\r\ntriumphs of some of his utterances. I have heard people say, too, that\r\nthey felt it pathetic to hear him deliver his speech on the introduction\r\nof the Home Rule Bill, and to remember the vigour with which his\r\nutterances on that occasion stood in such a contrast. This was\r\nsuperficial and false criticism. It is quite true that the old resonance\r\nof the voice is not there, and it is true that now and then he shows\r\nsigns of physical fatigue, and that recently after his cold there were\r\nsome days when his voice was little better than a very distinct, but\r\nalso a very pathetic, whisper. But there is another side. Age has\r\nmellowed his style, so that now he can speak on even the most\r\ncontentious subject with a gentleness and a freedom from anything like\r\nvenom--with an elevation of tone--that make it almost impossible for\r\neven his bitterest opponent to listen to him without delight and, for\r\nthe moment at least, with a certain degree of assent. If anybody really\r\nwishes to find out what constitutes the highest and most effective form\r\nof House of Commons' eloquence, he should spend his days in listening to\r\nMr. Gladstone in the most recent style he has adopted in the House of\r\nCommons. And the lessons to be derived are that House of Commons'\r\neloquence should be easy, genial in temper, reserved in force--in short,\r\nthat it should put things with the agreeable candour, and\r\npassionlessness want of exaggeration which characterise well-bred\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the slaughter.]\r\n\r\nA foredoomed sheep could not have been brought more unwillingly to the\r\nslaughter than was Mr. Balfour to the debate on the Vote of Censure. He\r\nhad nothing new to say, and unfortunately he felt that as keenly as\r\nanybody else. Every single topic with which he had to deal had been\r\ndiscussed already, until people were positively sick of them--in short,\r\npoor Mr. Balfour was in the position of having to serve up to the House\r\na dish that had been boiled and grilled and stewed, and yet stewed\r\nagain, until the gorge rose at it in revolt and disgust. The late Chief\r\nSecretary has the susceptibility of all nervous temperaments. The men\r\nare indeed few who have equal power with all kinds of audiences--with an\r\naudience that is friendly and that is hostile. Still more rare is it to\r\nfind a man who can face an audience even worse than a downright hostile\r\none, and that is an audience which is indifferent, There are very few\r\nmen I have known in my Parliamentary experience who could do it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A memory of Parnell.]\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell was one. I have seen him speak quite comfortably to an\r\naudience which consisted of himself, Mr. Biggar, the Minister in\r\nattendance, and the Speaker of the House--in all, four, including\r\nhimself. Indeed, he often said to me that he rather liked to have such\r\nan audience. Speaking was not easy or agreeable to him, and his sole\r\npurpose for many years in speaking at all was to consume so much time.\r\nParnell was a man who always found it rather hard to concentrate his\r\nmind on any subject unless he was alone and in silence. This was perhaps\r\none of the many reasons why he kept out of the House of Commons as much\r\nas he could. Anything like noise or disturbance around him seemed to\r\ndestroy his power of thinking. For instance, when he was being\r\ncross-examined by Sir Richard Webster in the course of the Forgeries\r\nCommission, his friends trembled one day because, looking at his face,\r\nwith its puzzled, far-away look, they knew that he was in one of those\r\nmoods of abstraction, during which he was scarcely accountable for what\r\nhe said. And sure enough he made on that day the appalling statement\r\nthat he had used certain language for the purpose of deceiving the House\r\nof Commons. He said to me that he liked to speak in an empty House\r\nbecause then he had time to collect his thoughts. Joe Biggar, his\r\nassociate, was also able to speak in any circumstances with exactly the\r\nsame ease of spirit. To him, speaking was but a means to an end, and\r\nwhether people listened to him or not--stopped to hang on his words or\r\nfled before his grating voice and Ulster accent--it was all one to him.\r\nTwo other men have the power of speaking always with the same interest\r\nand self-possession. These are Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. O'Connor Power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sensitiveness of Mr. Balfour.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Balfour is like none of these men. He requires the glow of a\r\ngood audience--of a cheering party--of the certainty of success in the\r\ndivision lobby--to bring out his best powers. The splendid, rattling,\r\nself-confident debater of the coercion period now no longer exists, and\r\nMr. Balfour has positively gone back to the clumsiness, stammering, and\r\nineffectiveness of the pre-historic period of his life before he had\r\ntaken up the Chief Secretaryship. That was bad enough; but what is worse\r\nis that the House is beginning to feel it. If you lose confidence in\r\nyourself, the world is certain to pretty soon follow your example. And\r\nso it is now with Mr. Balfour, for when he stood up to speak on March\r\n27th there was the sight--which must have made his soul sink to even\r\nprofounder depths of depression--of members leaving the House in troops\r\nand rushing to the lobby, the library, or the smoke-room, rather than\r\nlisten to a debater whose rise a few months ago would have meant a\r\ngeneral and excited incursion of everybody that could hear. Starting\r\nthus, Mr. Balfour made the worst of a bad case, his speech was a\r\nfailure, and as the American would put it, a fizzle; in short, a ghastly\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The G.O.M.'s outburst.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this debate that Mr. Gladstone made his\r\nmagnificent and unexpected outburst. He had been paying attention to the\r\ndebate--but very quietly, and not at all in a way that suggested an idea\r\nof intervening in it. It was, too, about nine o'clock when Mr. Gladstone\r\nstood up, and anybody acquainted with the House of Commons knows that\r\nnine o'clock is in the very crisis of that dinner hour which nightly\r\nmakes the House of Commons a waste and a wilderness. Nor, indeed, was\r\nthere much in the opening sentences that seemed to indicate the\r\nfact--the great fact--that the House of Commons was about to listen to\r\none of the most extraordinary manifestations of eloquence it has ever\r\nheard during its centuries of existence. For the Old Man was in his most\r\nbenignant mood. He spoke of his opponents and their case in sorrow\r\nrather than in anger. Evidently, the House was about to listen to one of\r\nthose delightful little addresses--half paternal, half pedagogic--to\r\nwhich it has become accustomed in recent years, since Mr. Gladstone\r\nthrew off the fierce, warring spirit of earlier days, and became the\r\nhoney-tongued Nestor of the assembly. But, as time went on, the House\r\nbegan to perceive that the Old Man was in splendid fighting trim, and\r\nseized with one of those moments of positive inspiration, in which he\r\ncarries away an assembly as though it were floated into Dreamland on the\r\nwaves of a mighty magician's magic power. Smash after smash came upon\r\nthe Tory case--as though you could see the whole edifice crumbling\r\nbefore your eyes, as though it were an earthquake slitting the rocks and\r\nshaking the solid earth. And, all the time, no loss whatever of the\r\nmassive calm, the imperturbable good-humour, the deadly politeness which\r\nthe commercial gentlemen from Ulster have also found can kill more\r\neffectively than the shout of rhetoric, or the jargon of faction, or the\r\nraucous throat of bigotry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the Empyrean.]\r\n\r\nAt last the Old Man had come to a contrast between the action of the\r\nTory Government of 1885 and the Liberal with regard to the treatment of\r\nprisoners in Ireland. The history of that period is one upon which Mr.\r\nGladstone is now able to speak without feeling; but he dragged out from\r\nthat period and its hidden recesses the whole story of the negotiations\r\nbetween Parnell and Lord Carnarvon, and all the other circumstances that\r\nmake that one of the most remarkable epochs in the history of English\r\nparties. He was now sweeping all before him. This Lord Randolph felt,\r\nand it was almost timorously he rose to make an interruption. The Old\r\nMan courteously gave way; but it was only to jump up again and pour on\r\nhis young opponent a tide of ridicule and answer which overwhelmed him.\r\nHigher and higher he soared with every succeeding moment, and stranger\r\nand more impressive became the aspect of the House. There is nothing\r\nwhich becomes that assembly so much as those moments of exaltation\r\nduring which it is under the absolute spell of some great master of its\r\nemotions. Then a death-like stillness falls upon it--you can almost hear\r\nthe same heavy-drawn sighs as those that in a Paris opera-house tell of\r\nall the passion, the flood of memory and regret, and the dreams which\r\nare evoked by the voice of a Marguerite before her final expiation--of a\r\nJuliet before her final immolation. Laughter and cheers there were in\r\nabundance during this portion of Mr. Gladstone's speech; but the general\r\ndemeanour was one of deadly stillness and rapt emotion--the stillness\r\none can imagine on that Easter morning when De Quincey went forth and\r\nwashed the fever from his forehead with the dew of early day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An episode.]\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of it all there came one of the most pathetic little\r\nepisodes I have seen in the House of Commons of recent years. Mr.\r\nGladstone has somewhat changed his habits in one respect. There was a\r\ntime when he rarely came to the House to deliver a great speech without\r\na little bottle--such as one sees containing pomade on the\r\ndressing-table of the thin-haired bachelor. Of late, the pomade-bottle\r\nhas disappeared. The G.O.M. is now content to take the ordinary glass of\r\nwater. It is very seldom that he requires even that amount of sustenance\r\nduring his great speeches. However, he had been doing a good deal that\r\nday--he had already made a long speech to his supporters in the Foreign\r\nOffice--and he required a glass of water. He called out for it, and, at\r\nonce, there was a rush from the Treasury Bench to the lobby outside.\r\nBut, before this could be done, the very pleasant little episode to\r\nwhich I have alluded took place. There stood opposite Mr. Jackson, the\r\nlate Chief Secretary, an untouched glass of water. When he heard the\r\ncry of the Old Man, Mr. Jackson--who has plenty of Yorkshire kindliness,\r\nas well as Yorkshire bluffness--at once took up the glass that stood\r\nbefore him, and handed it across the table. With a bow, and a delighted\r\nand delightful smile, the Old Man took the glass, and drank almost\r\ngreedily. And then, turning to his opponents, he said, \"I wish the right\r\nhon. gentleman who uses me so kindly, were as willing to take from my\r\nfountainhead as I am from his.\" The grace, the courtesy, the readiness\r\nwith which it was said, took the House by storm, and it was hard to say\r\nwhether the delighted laughter and cheers came in greater volume from\r\nthe Tory or the Liberal side of the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The peroration.]\r\n\r\nAnd Mr, Gladstone's power increased with his power over the House. It\r\nlooked as if you were watching some mighty monarch of the air that rises\r\nand rises higher, higher into the empyrean on slow-poised, even almost\r\nmotionless, wing. Leaving behind the narrow issues of the particular\r\nmotion before the House, Mr. Gladstone entered on a rapid survey of the\r\nmournful and touching relations between English officialism and Irish\r\nNational sentiment. From the dead past, he called up the touching,\r\nbeautiful, and sympathetic figure of Thomas Drummond, and all his\r\nefforts to reconcile the administration of the law with the rights and\r\nsentiments of the Irish people. The time for cheering had passed. All\r\nanybody could do was to listen in spellbound silence, as sonorous\r\nsentence rolled after sonorous sentence. And then cams the end, in a\r\nsofter and lower key. It was a direct personal allusion to Mr. Morley.\r\nIt was the whole weight of the Government and of its head thrown to the\r\nside of the Chief Secretary in the new policy in Ireland. \"We claim,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone, \"to be partakers of his responsibility, we appeal to\r\nthe judgment of the House of Commons, and we have no other desire except\r\nto share his fate.\" And then a hurricane of applause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A first experience.]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to feel sympathy for Lord Randolph Churchill in\r\nthe difficult task of following such a speech. The first thing he had to\r\ndo was to bear testimony to the extraordinary effect the speech had made\r\nupon the House of Commons. It was, he said, a speech \"impressive and\r\nentrancing\"--two most happily-chosen epithets to describe it. And then\r\nLord Randolph told a little bit of personal history which was\r\ninteresting. In all his Parliamentary career, this was the first time he\r\nhad been called upon to immediately follow a speech of Mr. Gladstone. He\r\nwould willingly have abandoned the opportunity, for it was a speech\r\nwhich no man in the House of Commons was capable of confronting. After\r\nit, everything else was bound to fall flat, dull, and unimpressive. Lord\r\nRandolph had the misfortune of having prepared a speech of considerable\r\nlength--going into the dead past, forgotten things, and found\r\nhimself--almost for the first time in his life--incapable of holding the\r\nattention of the House of Commons. Then the division followed, with 47\r\nof a majority--and loud ringing cheers came from the friends of the\r\nGovernment--and especially from the Irish benches--represented in the\r\ndivision by every single member of the party, with the exception of one,\r\nabsent on sick leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Still holiday-making.]\r\n\r\nThe Easter holidays were slow in coming to an end. People who were\r\nfortunate enough to obtain pairs, lingered by the seaside or in the\r\ncountry house. Others were busy with the work which the recess now\r\nimposes as much as in the most feverish Parliamentary times on leading\r\npolitical men. Mr. Balfour was away in Ireland, among the Orangemen of\r\nUlster and the Loyalists of Dublin; Lord Randolph Churchill was at\r\nLiverpool making silly and violent speeches; Mr. Chamberlain was\r\n_colloguing_--to use an excellent Irish phrase--with the publicans of\r\nthe Midlands. The Irish were especially conspicuous by the smallness of\r\ntheir attendance. They had been months away from business, wives,\r\nchildren, and naturally they were anxious to take advantage of the brief\r\nbreathing space which was left to them before that time came when they\r\ncould not leave Westminster for a moment in the weeks during which the\r\nHome Rule Bill was in Committee!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of the G.O.M.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, of course, was in his place. Down in Brighton, in a\r\npot-hat, antediluvian in age and shape, he had been courting the breeze\r\nof the sea under the hospitable wing of Mr. Armitstead; escaping from\r\nthe crowds of hero-worshippers, and attending divine service sometimes\r\ntwice in the same day. He had not been idle in his temporary retreat.\r\nWhen the day comes to record his doings before the accurate scales of\r\nOmnipotent and Omniscient Justice, he will stand out from all other men\r\nin the absolute use of every available second of his days of life. It\r\nwas clear that during his retreat, as during his hours of official work,\r\nhis mind had been busy on the same absorbing and engrossing subject. He\r\nwas armed with a considerable manuscript, and had evidently thought out\r\nhis sentences, his arguments, his statements of facts with intense\r\ndevotion and thought.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the things which distinguishes him from other public men\r\nof his time. There are men I wot of--and not very big men either--who\r\nare nothing without their audience. They deem their dignity abused if\r\nthere be not the crowded bench, the cheering friends, the prominent and\r\nostentatious place. Not so Mr. Gladstone. Perhaps it is the splendid\r\nrobustness of his nerves, perhaps the absorption in his subject to the\r\nforgetfulness of himself; whatever it is, he faces this small,\r\n_distrait_, perhaps even depressed, audience with the same zest as\r\nthough he were once again before that splendid gathering which met his\r\neyes on the memorable night when he brought in his Home Rule Bill. Who\r\nbut he could fail to have noticed the contrast, and noticing, who but he\r\ncould remain so loftily unobservant and unimpressed?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In splendid form.]\r\n\r\nBut then Mr. Gladstone has too much of that splendid oratorical instinct\r\nnot to fashion and shape his speech to the change in the surroundings.\r\nHe has an impressionability--not to panic, not to depression, not to\r\nwounded vanity, but to the appropriateness and the demands of an\r\nenvironment, which is something miraculous. I have already remarked,\r\nthat the infinite variety of his oratory is Shakespearian in its\r\ncompleteness and abundance. The speech on April 6th was an additional\r\nproof of this. Comparisons were naturally made between this speech and\r\nthe speech by which he introduced the Bill, and everybody who was\r\ncompetent thought that the second speech was the finer and better of the\r\ntwo. Stories have trickled through to the public of the anxieties and\r\nworries with which Mr. Gladstone was confronted--not from the Irish\r\nside--on the very night before he had to bring forth this prodigious\r\npiece of legislative work. It is these small worries that to many\r\nStatesmen are the grimmest realities and the most momentous and\r\neffective events of their inner lives. It is reported that one of the\r\nfew sleepless nights which have ever disturbed the splendidly even and\r\nsane and healthy tenor of this tempestuous and incessantly active life,\r\nwas the night before the introduction of the Home Rule Bill. There are\r\npoints to be finally settled--clauses to be ultimately fixed--phrases to\r\nbe polished or pared at the eleventh hour in all human affairs. Measures\r\nfinally settled and fixed for weeks before the last hour exist--like all\r\nperfection--only in the brains and pages of dramatists and novelists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sunburnt, vigorous, self-possessed.]\r\n\r\nIt was not unnatural under these circumstances that when Mr. Gladstone\r\nmade his speech introducing the Home Rule Bill there should have been on\r\nhis cheek a pallor deadlier even than that which usually sits upon his\r\nbrow. That pallor, by the way, I heard recently, has been characteristic\r\nof him from his earliest years. A schoolfellow from that far-off and\r\nalmost pre-historic time when our Grand Old Man was a thin, slim,\r\nintrospective and prematurely serious boy at Eton, tells to-day that the\r\nrecollection he has of the young Gladstone is of a slight figure, never\r\nrunning, but always walking with a fast step, with earnest black eyes,\r\nand with a pallid face--the ivory pallor, be it observed, not of\r\ndelicacy, but of robustness. Still there was on that Home Rule night, a\r\npallor that had the deadlier hue of sleeplessness, worry,\r\nover-anxiety--the hideous burden of a great, weighty, and complex speech\r\nto deliver.\r\n\r\nOn April 6th all this was gone. The fresh, youthful, cheerful man who\r\nstood up in his place had drunk deep of the breezes that sweep The\r\nFront at Brighton; his cheeks were burned by the blaze of a splendid\r\nspring sun; in the budding, blossoming vital air around him he had taken\r\nsome of that eternal hopefulness with which the new birth of nature in\r\nthe spring inspires every human being with any freshness of sensation\r\nleft. Perchance from his windows in the Lion Mansion he had looked in\r\nthe evening over the broad expanse of frontierless waters, and risen to\r\nthe exaltation of the chainless unrest, the tireless and eternal youth,\r\nthe illimitable breadth of the sea. At all events, he stood before the\r\nHouse visibly younger, brighter, serener than for many a day.\r\n\r\nThe voice bore traces of the transformation of body and soul which this\r\nshort visit to the sea has produced. It was soft, mellow, strong. There\r\nwere none of the descents to pathetic and inaudible whispers which\r\noccasionally in the hours of fag and fatigue have painfully impressed\r\nthe sympathetic hearer. As Mr. Gladstone subdued himself to the temper\r\nof the House, the House accommodated itself to the tone of Mr.\r\nGladstone. I have heard his speech on the second reading described as a\r\npleasant, delightful, historical lecture. Certainly, no stranger coming\r\nto the House would have imagined that these sentences, flowing in a\r\nbeautiful, even stream, dealt with one of the conflicts of our time\r\nwhich excite the fiercest passion and bitterest blood. It is this\r\ncalmness that is now part of Mr. Gladstone's strength. It soothes and\r\nkills at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nestor-patriot.]\r\n\r\nThe evening was soft and sunny, the air of the House subdued, and the\r\nabsence of anything like large numbers prevented outbursts of party\r\npassion. And yet all this seemed to heighten the effectiveness of the\r\nscene and the speech. Once again one had to think of Mr. Gladstone--as\r\nposterity will think of him at this splendid epoch of his career--not as\r\nthe party politician, giving and receiving hard blows--riding a\r\nwhirlwind of passion--facing a hurricane of hate--but as the\r\nNestor-patriot of his country, telling all parties alike the gospel that\r\nwill lead to peace, prosperity, and contentment. The Tories, doubtless,\r\nsee none of this; but even they cannot help falling into the mood of the\r\nhour, and under the fascination of the speaker. Now and then they\r\ninterrupt, but, as a rule, they sit in respectful and awed silence.\r\nWhenever they do venture on interruption, the old lion shows that he is\r\nstill in possession of all that power for a sudden and deadly spring,\r\nwhich lies concealed under the easy and tranquil strength of the hour.\r\nHe happens to mention the case of Norway and Sweden as one of the cases\r\nwhich confirm his contention that autonomy produces friendly relations.\r\nHe has to confess, that in this case some difficulties have arisen;\r\nthere is a faint Tory cheer. At once--but with gentle good humour--with\r\nan indulgent smile--Mr. Gladstone remarks that he doesn't wonder that\r\nthe Tories clutch at the smallest straw that helps them to eke out a\r\ncase against autonomy, and then he proceeds to show that even the case\r\nof Norway and Sweden doesn't help them a bit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A vivid gesture.]\r\n\r\nThere is another little touch which will bring out the perfection and\r\nbeauty of the speech. One of the things which tell the experienced\r\nobserver that Mr. Gladstone is in his best form, is the exuberance and\r\nfreedom of his gesture. Whenever he feels a thorough grip of himself and\r\nof the House, he lets himself go in a way upon which he does not venture\r\nin quieter moods. He was dealing with the question of our colonies and\r\nof the difference which had been made in them by the concession of Home\r\nRule. It was while thus engaged that he made one of those eloquent\r\nlittle asides, which bring home to the mind the vastness and extent of\r\nthis great career. Nearly sixty years ago--just think of it, nearly\r\nsixty years ago--he had been associated with the Government of the\r\nColonies--referring to the time when Lord Aberdeen was his chief, and he\r\nheld office for the first time as an Under-Secretary. And then he made\r\nfrom Lord Aberdeen a quotation in which the Colonial Secretary calls\r\ndelighted attention to the fact that Heligoland is tranquil--the single\r\none of all the dependencies of the Crown of which that could be said at\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\nBut it was not at this point that the significant gesture came in, to\r\nwhich I have alluded. Mr. Gladstone had another document to read. By the\r\nway--even over the distance which divides the Treasury Bench from the\r\nOpposition Benches below the gangway, where we Irishry sit--I could see\r\nthat the document was written in that enormous hand-writing, which is\r\nnecessary nowadays when the sight of the Prime Minister is not equal to\r\nthe undimmed lustre of the eagle eye. This letter, said Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwas not addressed to him. It was not addressed to a Home Ruler. By this\r\ntime, curiosity was keenly excited. But Mr. Gladstone--smiling, holding\r\nthe House in firm attention and rapt admiration--was determined to play\r\nwith the subject a little longer. The letter was not directed even to\r\nthe Commoner. It was directed to a \"Peer;\" and as he uttered this sacred\r\nword, with a delicious affectation of reverence, he raised the index\r\nfinger of his hand to high heaven, as though only a reference to a\r\nregion so exalted could sufficiently manifest the elevation of the\r\npersonage who had been the recipient of the letter. The House saw the\r\npoint, and laughed in great delight. It is on occasions like these that\r\none sees the immense artistic power which lies under all the seriousness\r\nand gravity of Mr. Gladstone--the thorough exuberance of vitality which\r\nmarks the splendid sanity of his healthy nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Birrell.]\r\n\r\nI always tremble when I see a literary man, and especially a literary\r\nman with a high reputation, rise to address the House of Commons. The\r\nshores of that cruel assembly are strewn with the wrecks of literary\r\nreputations. It was, therefore, not without trepidation that I saw Mr.\r\nAugustin Birrell--one of the very finest writers of our time--succeed in\r\ncatching the Speaker's eye. My misgivings were entirely unnecessary.\r\nWith perfect ease and self-possession--at the same time with the modesty\r\nof real genuine ability--Mr. Birrell made one of the happiest and best\r\nspeeches of the debate. Now and then, the epigram was perhaps a little\r\ntoo polished--the wit perhaps a trifle too subtle for the House of\r\nCommons. But careful preparation always involves this; and every man\r\nmust prepare until he is able to think more clearly on his legs than\r\nsitting down. It was just the kind of speech which was wanted at a\r\nmoment when the general air is rent with the rhodomontade and tomfoolery\r\nof Ulster. Applying to these wild harangues the destructively quiet wit\r\nof _obiter dicta_, Mr. Birrell made the Orangemen look very foolish and\r\nutterly ridiculous. Mr, Gladstone was one of Mr. Birrell's most\r\nattentive and cordial hearers. Mr. Birrell is going to do great things\r\nin the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In penal servitude.]\r\n\r\nThe keen, playful, and penetrating wit of Mr. Birrell did not do\r\nanything for Mr. Dunbar Barton. Mr. Barton is--as he properly\r\nboasted--the descendant of some of that good Protestant stock that, in\r\nthe days of the fight over the destruction of the Irish Parliament,\r\nstood by the liberties of Ireland. He is a nephew of Mr. Plunket--he\r\ninherits the talent which is traditional in the Plunket family, and is\r\nsaid not to be without some of the national spirit that still hides\r\nitself in odd nooks and corners of estranged Irish minds. But he has\r\nnone of the saving grace of his country or family. A solemn voice that\r\nseems to come from the depths of some divine despair, and from the\r\nrecesses of his innermost organs, together with a certain funereal\r\naspect in the close-shaven face, gives him an air that suggests the\r\ncypress and the cemetery. But with deadly want of humour, he spoke of\r\nthe possibility of his spending the remainder of a blameless life in\r\npenal servitude, and was deeply wounded when the uproarious and\r\nirreverent House refused to take the possibility seriously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Stansfeld.]\r\n\r\nThe following Friday was made memorable by a fine speech from Mr.\r\nStansfeld. Full of activity, with undimmed eye, with every mental\r\nfaculty keen and alert, with every lofty and generous aspiration as\r\nfresh as in the days of hot and perilous youth, Mr. Stansfeld yet\r\nappears something of a survival in the House of Commons. His appearance,\r\nhis style of speech, even the framework of his thought, seem to belong\r\nto another--in some respects a finer and more passionate period than our\r\nown. The long hair combed straight back--the strong aquiline nose--the\r\nheavy-lined and sensitive mouth--the subdued tenderness and wrath of the\r\neyes--even the somewhat antique cut of the clothes--suggest the days\r\nwhen the storm and stress of the youthful century were still in men's\r\nsouls, and were driving them to conspiracy, to prison, to scaffold, to\r\nbarricades, to bloody fields. There is also a deliberation in the\r\ndelivery--a sonorousness in the phraseology--that has something of a\r\nbygone day. But all this adds to the impressiveness of the address. The\r\nfervour is all there, the unalterable conviction, the lofty purpose.\r\nThere is reason for the warm note of welcome which comes from the Irish\r\nbenches; for this man--perhaps disappointed--perchance not too well\r\nused--stands up to defend his principles with the same utter\r\nforgetfulness of self which belongs only to the finest and the truest\r\nnatures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commercial culture.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain has not a wide range of ideas, and his small stock has\r\nnot been increased by anything like extensive reading. The House was\r\nrelieved to find after his return to Westminster on the 10th of April\r\nthat he had just begun to read Tennyson. It is always easy to know when\r\nMr. Chamberlain is making the acquaintance of an author for the first\r\ntime. Strictly business-like in even his reading, he apparently first\r\nthinks of reading a book when he has somewhere seen a quotation from it\r\nwhich might be worked into a speech; the next and almost immediate\r\nprocess is to transfer it to one of his speeches. This is one of the\r\nmany differences between him and the exhaustless brain and universal\r\nreading of Mr. Gladstone. It was, therefore, not much of a surprise to\r\nthose who had watched Mr. Chamberlain for years, to see that he was\r\nmaking a very bad and poor speech on the second reading of the Home\r\nRule Bill--a speech certainly far inferior to that which he had\r\ndelivered on the first reading. He had exhausted the poor soil; he had\r\nreally no more to say. He was unfortunately helped by Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwho, instead of listening in silence to attacks grown stale by their\r\ninfinite repetition, attempted to correct some of Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nstatements. This was especially the case in reference to the famous\r\nspeech in which Mr. Parnell is spoken of as passing \"through rapine to\r\ndismemberment.\" Mr. Chamberlain wished to insist that the language had\r\nbeen applied to all the Irish leaders: Mr. Gladstone insisted that they\r\nwere applied to Mr. Parnell alone. This controversy between the Prime\r\nMinister and Mr. Chamberlain gave a little life to a speech that\r\nhitherto had been falling desperately flat, and as such the interruption\r\nwas a tactical mistake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De mortuis.]\r\n\r\nBut it brought with curious unexpectedness a scene not without pathos\r\nand significance. In the midst of the thrust and ripost of Mr. Gladstone\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain, a strange and yet familiar voice was heard to shout\r\nout, \"They put all the blame on Parnell because he is dead.\" It was a\r\nstartling--even an embarrassing interruption. The memory of Parnell is\r\nstill dear to the vast majority of the old comrades who were compelled\r\nto separate themselves from him in the Great Irish Disruption. At the\r\ntime when Mr. Gladstone made the speech quoted, Mr. Parnell was the\r\nloved leader of the whole Irish people and a united Irish party; and the\r\nspeech was made at a moment particularly solemn and glorious in the\r\nstrange life and career of Parnell. The great controversy between the\r\nEnglish and the Irish leader, which Mr. Chamberlain had raked up from\r\nthe almost forgotten past, took place at the moment when Mr. Parnell had\r\ngone from town to town and county to county in Ireland, in the midst of\r\nvast and enthusiastic receptions--imperial demonstrations--with salvoes\r\nof cheers, enthusiasm, and auroral hope such as have taken place so\r\noften in Irish history on the eve of some mighty victory or hideous\r\ndisaster. And, then, immediately after came Parnell's imprisonment,\r\nwhich he bore so well--the suppression of the National Land League, and\r\nthe era of unchecked and ferocious coercion in which the good intentions\r\nand kindly feelings of Mr. Forster finally were buried. To separate\r\nthemselves from Mr. Parnell at that great moment in his and their life,\r\nwas a thing which none of Parnell's old comrades could do; and when this\r\nstartling interruption came, it was the spoken utterance of many of\r\ntheir thoughts brought back by Mr. Chamberlain's venomous tongue in\r\npainful reverie over a glorious but dead moment, and a tragically\r\nwrecked and superb career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crocodile tears.]\r\n\r\nThere was a painful pause, and then came, however, an antidote. It was\r\nnot in the Irish Nationalist party--it was not in even his own\r\ncolleagues in the small band of Parnell's supporters, that Mr. Redmond's\r\nobservation found a responsive echo. A tempest of cheers broke forth\r\nfrom the Tory Benches--from the backers of the _Times_ and the\r\nsupporters of Piggott; and to add to the painful and almost hideous\r\nirony of the situation, Mr. Chamberlain made unctuous profession of\r\nsympathy with the vindication of Parnell's memory. To those who know\r\nthat of all the fierce animosities and contempts of Parnell, Mr.\r\nChamberlain's was perhaps the fiercest--to those who remember that\r\nstrange and almost awful scene when Mr. Parnell--in one of those\r\noutbursts of concentrated rage which it was almost appalling to\r\nwitness--turned and rent Mr. Chamberlain as first false to his\r\ncolleagues and then false to Parnell himself--to those who remembered\r\nthat deadly pallor that made even more ghastly the ordinarily pale cheek\r\nof Mr. Chamberlain beneath this withering attack--to those, I say, who\r\nremembered all this, nothing could be more grotesque than Mr.\r\nChamberlain shedding a pious tear over Parnell's grave.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone and Parnell.]\r\n\r\nThe situation passed off, but in many breasts it had left its sadness\r\nand its sting behind. And then it was that once more the Old Man\r\nbrought back the House to the temper from which it had been carried by\r\nthe malignities of Mr. Chamberlain. Very pale, very calm, and, at the\r\nsame time, with evident though sternly repressed emotion--even in the\r\nvery height and ecstasy of Parliamentary passion there is a splendid\r\ncomposure and self-command about Mr. Gladstone that conveys an\r\noverwhelming sense of the extraordinary masculinity and strength of his\r\nnature--very pale, and very calm, Mr. Gladstone stood up. Speaking in\r\nlow and touching tones he asked to make an explanation, because he\r\nfeared that some observations of his might have given pain to gentlemen\r\nwho were deeply attached to the memory of Mr. Parnell. Then he stated\r\nthat while he had formed an opinion, which might be right or wrong, with\r\nregard to Mr. Parnell before his imprisonment in Kilmainham, he had\r\nalways believed, after his release, that Mr. Parnell was working\r\nhonestly for the good of Ireland; that he had made a communication to\r\nMr. Parnell to that effect through a friend; and that from that time\r\nforward no hard word could be found in his speeches with regard to the\r\nIrish leader. This little speech was uttered with exquisite dignity and\r\nkindliness, and Mr. Redmond received it with the handsomest\r\nacknowledgment of its gentleness and grace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No manipulating.]\r\n\r\nThis episode has made me anticipate a little, and almost tempted me to\r\npass by one of the incidents in the speech of Mr. Chamberlain. But that\r\nwould have been a mistake, for it is an incident that brings out fully\r\nthe reason why he is so utterly disliked and distrusted even in those\r\nTory circles which, for the moment, are making use of him. It is an\r\nincident that likewise throws a flood of light upon the inner, hidden,\r\ndark depths of his sinister nature. He was arguing on the financial\r\naspects of Mr. Gladstone's Bill. Under this portion of the Bill the\r\ntrader who has residences in both countries is entitled to make his\r\nreturn for his income-tax in either England or Ireland. Mr. Chamberlain\r\nproceeded to put the case of a trader in that position who wished to\r\nembarrass the Irish Government, and who would wish accordingly to give\r\nEngland, and not the Irish Exchequer, the advantage of his income-tax.\r\nThis he could do, Mr. Chamberlain pointed out, in the easiest manner\r\nimaginable; he could \"manipulate his books.\" There it stands; these are\r\nthe very words he used. Incredible, everybody would say who didn't know\r\nMr. Chamberlain, and wasn't told by the evidence of eyes and ears that\r\nthe words had actually been uttered. The Irish members were not slow to\r\nseize the point, and to shout aloud at this revelation of Mr.\r\nChamberlain's nature; and even his Tory friends shuddered at such a\r\nmanifestation of the real kind of man that lies hidden under Mr.\r\nChamberlain's oily and smooth exterior. At first, he seemed surprised at\r\nthe visible shock and tremor and involuntary sense of repulsion which\r\nthis odious suggestion awakened on all sides--then he slowly realized\r\nthat he had made a mistake; and, for once, this readiest of debaters was\r\nnonplussed, and even a little abashed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Irish Members and the Bill.]\r\n\r\nMr. MacCarthy followed Mr. Chamberlain; he spoke just from ten to\r\nfifteen minutes--plainly, simply, to the point, and what he had to say\r\nwas that he and his friends did look on this Bill as a final settlement,\r\nwhich Ireland would be honourably pledged to carry out. Unselfish,\r\nstraightforward, unpretentious, kindly, Mr. MacCarthy brought into more\r\nvivid contrast the personal venom--the ruthless hunger for vengeance and\r\nthe humiliation of his enemies--which came out with almost painful\r\nvividness from the speech to which we had just ceased to listen. Mr.\r\nGladstone, sitting opposite, attentive and watchful, was evidently much\r\npleased at the heartiness of Mr. MacCarthy's acceptance of his great\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir George Trevelyan.]\r\n\r\nThe night wound up with the very best speech I have ever heard Sir\r\nGeorge Trevelyan deliver. Sir George had to answer violent, fierce,\r\nalmost malignant assault; but he did so without ever uttering a harsh\r\nword--without losing one particle of his courteous and admirable\r\nself-control--he raised the debate of a great issue to the high place of\r\ndifference of principles and convictions, instead of personal bickerings\r\nand hideous and revolting personal animosities. It is the vice of Sir\r\nGeorge Trevelyan as a speaker that he over-prepares--writing out, as a\r\nrule, nearly every word he has to utter, and often some of the very best\r\nspeeches I have heard him deliver have been spoiled by giving the fatal\r\nsense of being spoken essays. The speech was carefully prepared, and, so\r\nfar as I could observe, was even written out; but its grace of diction,\r\nits fine temper, above all, its manly explanation of a change of view\r\nand its close-knit reasoning, made it really one of the very finest\r\naddresses I have heard in the course of many years' debating.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Toryism of the gutter.]\r\n\r\nAnd, then, if you wanted to appreciate Sir George Trevelyan the more,\r\nyou had only to wait for a few moments to hear the man who followed him.\r\nI am told on pretty good authority that, next to Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, the favourite orator of the Tory provincial platform is Sir\r\nAshmead Bartlett. I can well believe it. The empty shibboleths--the loud\r\nand blatant voice--the bumptious temper--that make the commoner form of\r\nTory--all are there. He is the dramatically complete embodiment of all\r\nthe vacuous folly, empty-headed shoutings, and swaggering patriotism\r\nwhich make up the stock-in-trade of most provincial Tories. Poor Mr.\r\nBalfour was caught by Sir Ashmead before he had time to escape, and in\r\nsheer decency had to remain while his servile adulator was pouring on\r\nhim buckets of butter, which must have appalled and disgusted him.\r\nIndeed, the effect of the bellowings of the man from Sheffield could be\r\nseen in the bent back, the depressed face, the general air of limpness\r\nwhich overcame the Tory leader--as helpless, dejected, bent double, he\r\nlooked steadily at the green bench underneath him, and concealed from\r\nthe House as much as possible the tell-tale horror of his face.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A portrait of Michael Davitt.]\r\n\r\nOn an assembly which had been jaded and almost tortured by this\r\ntremendous display, it was Mr. Davitt's fortune to come with his first\r\nspeech in Parliament. For hour after hour he had sate, very still, with\r\ndeeply-lined face, but with a restless and frequent twist of the heavy\r\ndark moustache, that spoke of the intense nervous strain to which this\r\nweary waiting was subjecting him. Davitt is a man whose face would stand\r\nout in bold relief from any crowd of men, however numerous or\r\nremarkable. He has a narrow face, with high cheek-bones, and the thick,\r\nclose black whiskers, beard and moustache, make him look almost as dark\r\nas a Spaniard. The eyes are deep-set, brilliant, restless--with infinite\r\nlessons of hours of agony, of loneliness, torture in all the million\r\nhours which filled up his nine years of endless and unbroken gloom in\r\npenal servitude. The frame is slight, well-knit--the frame of a sturdy\r\nson of the people--kept taut and thin by the restless nervous soul\r\nwithin. An empty sleeve hanging by his side tells the tale of work in\r\nthe factory in childhood's years, and of one of the accidents which too\r\noften maim the children of the poor in the manufacturing districts of\r\nEngland. The voice is strong, deep, and soft; the delivery slow,\r\ndeliberate, the style of the English or American platform rather than of\r\nthe Irish gathering by the green hillside.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dartmoor.]\r\n\r\nAltogether, never did there stand before this British assembly in all\r\nits centuries of history, a figure more interesting, more picturesque,\r\nmore touching, above all, more eloquent of a mighty transformation--of a\r\ngreat new birth and revolution in the history of two nations. Go back in\r\nmemory to the day, when with cropped hair--with the broad-arrowed coat,\r\nthe yellow stockings--this man dragged wearily the wheelbarrow in the\r\ngrim silences under the sinister skies of Dartmoor, with warders to\r\ntaunt, or insult, or browbeat the Irish felon-patriot--with the very\r\ndregs and scum of our lowest social depths for companions and\r\ncolleagues--and then think of this same man standing up before the\r\nsupreme and august assembly where the might, sovereignty, power, and\r\nomnipotence of this world-wide empire are centred, and holding it for\r\nmore than an hour and a half under a spell of rapt attention that almost\r\nsuggested the high-strung devotion of a religious service in place of a\r\nraging political controversy--think of this contrast, and then bless the\r\nday and the policy that have made possible such a transformation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Westminster.]\r\n\r\nI cannot attempt to give all the strong points of a speech which\r\nbristled with strong points at almost every turn. To the House its\r\nentire character must have come as a surprise. The mass of members that\r\ncrowded every bench, and filled the vacancies which Ashmead Bartlett had\r\nmade--Mr. Gladstone sitting attentive on the Treasury Bench--Mr. Balfour\r\nlistening with evident friendliness and sympathy--all these were enough\r\nto transport any orator into the realms of high stirring rhetoric, and\r\nto attune the nerves to poetic and exalted flight. But Davitt's nerves\r\nstood the test. Slowly, deliberately, patiently, he developed a case for\r\nthe Bill, of facts, figures, historical incident, pathetic and swift\r\npictures of Irish desolation and suffering, which would have been worthy\r\nof a great advocate placing a heavy indictment. Now and then there was\r\nthe eloquence of finely chosen language--of a striking fact--even of a\r\ntouching personal aside--but, as a whole, the speech was a simple,\r\nweighty, careful case against the Union--based on the eloquent\r\nstatistics of diminished population, exiled millions, devastated\r\nhomesteads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tragic comedy.]\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of lighter strains to relieve the deadly earnestness\r\nof a man who had thoroughly thought out his case. And, curiously enough,\r\nthese pleasant sallies nearly all had allusion to those tragic nine\r\nyears of penal servitude through which Davitt has passed. Mr. Dunbar\r\nBarton, one of the Orange lawyers, had spoken of himself as likely to\r\nspend the remainder of his days in penal servitude. Mr. Davitt put the\r\nthreat gently aside, with the assurance that the hon. and learned\r\ngentleman would probably be one day on the bench, and that he would\r\nadvise him not to try to reach the bench by the dock. The same gentleman\r\nhad expressed a doubt whether any constitutional lawyer would hold that\r\nhe was guilty either of treason or treason felony, if he took up arms\r\nagainst Home Rule after it had been passed by both Houses of Parliament.\r\n\"Would,\" said Mr. Davitt, with quiet pathos, \"I had met such a\r\nconstitutional authority in the shape of a judge twenty-three long years\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A vulgar and caddish interruption.]\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, what contributed to the marvellous effect of this speech\r\nwas its temper and one interruption. In all the speech there was not one\r\ntrace of the bitterness that must often have corroded that poor soul\r\nduring the nine years of living death--even the allusions to political\r\nopponents of to-day were kindly and gentle. Above all things, the speech\r\nwas one--not merely of an Irish Nationalist, but of a true Democrat--as\r\ndesirous of the happiness of other nationalities and other peoples as of\r\nhis own. It was while every part of the House was listening to this\r\nbeautiful and touching speech, that a gentleman called Brookfield--one\r\nof the most offensive of the narrow and malignant section of\r\nTories--rose and tried to trip Davitt up, by alleging that he was\r\nreading his speech. I am told that Mr. Balfour sprang in anger from his\r\nseat--there was a significant and a pained silence on the Tory\r\nBenches--there was a loud shout of anger and disgust from the Liberal\r\nand the Irish seats--with William O'Brien's voice shouting hoarsely\r\nabove the tempest, \"The party of gentlemen!\" The Speaker showed what he\r\nthought, in that deadly quiet way with which he can administer a snub,\r\nthat will never be forgotten. It was all that was wanted to complete the\r\nsuccess of this wonderful speech.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Rigby.]\r\n\r\nThen came hand-shakings and clappings on the back, and a light in the\r\neyes of Irish members that told of a great step forward in the progress\r\nof their cause. To a house thinned by the endless rhodomontade of a dull\r\nOrangeman--with a style of elocution to which the House is unaccustomed,\r\nand which has almost every fault delivery could have--the speech of Sir\r\nJohn Rigby, the Solicitor-General, was one of the finest and weightiest\r\nutterances delivered on the Bill. The massive head, the fine face, the\r\nrugged sense and leonine strength in face and figure, lent force to a\r\ncriticism of extraordinary effectiveness on the attacks levelled against\r\nthe Bill. First, the Solicitor-General took up the wild and whirling\r\nstatement of one of the opponents of the Bill, and then coolly--as\r\nthough it were a pure matter of business--he put in juxtaposition the\r\nenactments of the Bill, and the contrast was as laughter provoking with\r\nall its deadly seriousness, as the conflict between the story of\r\nFalstaff and the contemptuously quiet rejoinder of Prince Hal. Lord\r\nRandolph was taken in hand; he was soon disposed of. Then Mr. Dunbar\r\nBarton was crumpled up and flung away. Sir Edward Clarke ventured an\r\ninterruption; he was crushed in a sentence. It was an admirable specimen\r\nof destructive criticism, and it hugely and palpably delighted Mr.\r\nGladstone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Asquith.]\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith had intended to speak on April 14th, evening, but the\r\nportentous and prolix Courtney had shut him out, and he had to wait till\r\nthe following evening. The change was, perhaps, desirable, for Mr.\r\nAsquith had thus the opportunity of addressing the House when it was\r\nfresh, vital, and impressionable. In these long debates the evenings\r\nusually became intolerably dull and oppressive. Though Mr. Asquith was\r\nan untried man when he went into office, in two speeches he succeeded in\r\nplacing himself in the very front rank of the debaters and politicians\r\nin the House. Let me say at once that the speech was a remarkable\r\ntriumph, and placed Mr. Asquith at a bound amid not only the orators,\r\nbut the statesmen of the House of Commons--the men who have nerve,\r\nbreadth of view, great courage, enormous resource.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe's dustheap.]\r\n\r\nOne of the discoveries of the speech must have been particularly\r\nunpleasant to Mr. Chamberlain. The gentleman from Birmingham has at last\r\nfound a man who does not fear him--who has a much finer mind--wider\r\nculture--who has judgment, temper, and a vocabulary as copious and as\r\nready as that of Mr. Chamberlain himself. One had only to look at Mr.\r\nChamberlain throughout the speech to see how palpable, how painful this\r\ndiscovery was--especially to a man to whom politics is nothing but a\r\nmere conflict between contending rivalries and malignities. Mr.\r\nAsquith--calm, self-possessed, measured--put Joe on the rack with a\r\ndeliberation that was sometimes almost cruel in its effectiveness and\r\nrelentlessness; and Joe was foolish enough to point the severity and\r\nsuccess of the attack by losing his self-control. When Mr. Asquith said\r\nthat Joe could find no better employment than that of \"scavenging\"--here\r\nwas a word to make Joe wince--\"among the dustheaps\" of past speeches,\r\nJoe was a sight to see. A \"scavenger\"--this was the disrespectful way in\r\nwhich those quotations were described which had often roused the Tory\r\nBenches to ecstasies of delight. Joe was so angered that he could not\r\nget over it for some time. \"Dustheaps!\" he was heard to be muttering\r\nseveral times in succession, as if the word positively choked him.\r\nIndeed, throughout Mr. Asquith's speech, whenever the allusions were\r\nmade to him, Joe was seen to be muttering under his teeth. It was the\r\nrunning commentary which he made on the most effective attack that has\r\nbeen uttered against him; it was the highest tribute to the severity and\r\nsuccess of the assailant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limp Balfour.]\r\n\r\nBadly as Mr. Chamberlain bore his punishment, Mr. Balfour was even\r\nworse. It is seldom that the House of Commons has seen a more remarkable\r\nor more effective retort than the happy, dexterous, delightful--from\r\nthe literary point of view, unsurpassable--parody which Mr. Asquith made\r\nof Mr. Balfour's flagitious incitements to the men of Belfast. Mr.\r\nAsquith put the case of Mr. Morley going down to a crowd in Cork, and\r\nusing the same kind of language. Mr. Balfour, in his speech, had over\r\nand over again used the name of the Deity. \"I pray God,\" said the pious\r\nleader of the Tory party, as he addressed the Orangemen. When, in the\r\nimaginary speech which Mr. Asquith put into the mouth of Mr. Morley, he\r\nrecurred again and again to the phrase, \"I pray God,\" there was just the\r\nleast lifting of the eyes and lowering of the voice to the sanctimonious\r\nlevel of the Pharisee which made this part of the speech not merely a\r\nfine piece of oratory, but a splendid bit of acting. Mr. Balfour's\r\nappearance during this portion of Mr. Asquith's speech was pitiable. His\r\nface, with its pallor--look of abashed pain--was tell-tale of the inner\r\nshame which he felt, as thus calmly, coldly, cruelly--with extraordinary\r\nart, and amid a tempest of cheers--he was brought by his opponent face\r\nto face with realities which lay underneath his bland and oily phrases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another unmannerly interruption.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the calm and stately flow of Mr. Asquith's speech, while\r\nthe House, spellbound, listened in awe-struck and rapt silence,\r\nsuddenly, there was a commotion, a shout, then the roar of many voices.\r\nThe whole thing came upon the House with a bewildering and dumbfounding\r\nsurprise; it was as if someone had suddenly died, or some other sinister\r\ncatastrophe had occurred. In a moment, several Irish members--Mr. Swift\r\nMcNeill, Mr. Crilly, and others--were on their feet, shouting in accents\r\nhoarse with anger, inarticulate with rage. The Speaker was also on his\r\nfeet, and, for a while, his shouts of \"Order! Order!\" failed to calm the\r\nsudden, fierce cyclone. Above the din, voices were shouting, \"Name!\r\nName!\" with that rancorous and fierce note which the House of Commons\r\nknows so well when passion has broken loose, and all the grim depths of\r\nparty hate are revealed. At last, it was discovered that Lord Cranborne\r\nwas the culprit, and that when Mr. Asquith, amid universal sympathy and\r\nassent, was alluding to the beautiful speech of Mr. Davitt, this most\r\nunmannerly of cubs had uttered the word, \"Murderer.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A whipped hound.]\r\n\r\nIf he had not been so unspeakably rude, vulgar, odious, and impertinent,\r\none might have almost felt sympathy for Lord Salisbury's son in the\r\nposition in which he found himself. His face is usually pale, but now it\r\nhad the deadly, ghastly, and almost green pallor of a man who is\r\ncondemned to die. But, amid all the palpable terror, the Cecil insolence\r\nwas still there, and Lord Cranborne declared that, though he had used\r\nthe phrase, he had not intended it for the House, and that it was true.\r\nSince his relative, Lord Wolmer, made the lamest and meanest apology the\r\nHouse of Commons had ever heard, there never had been anything to equal\r\nthis. The House groaned aloud in disgust and contempt; even his own side\r\nwas as abashed as when Brookfield sought to interrupt Mr. Davitt. The\r\nSpeaker, quietly, but visibly moved and disgusted, at once told the\r\ninsolent young creature that this was not sufficient, and that an\r\napology was due--to which the Cecil hopeling proceeded to do with as bad\r\na grace and in as odious a style as it was possible for it to be done.\r\nMr. Asquith's splendid self-control and mastery of the House bore the\r\nordeal of even this odious incident, and he wound up the speech with one\r\nof the finest and most remarkable perorations which has ever been heard\r\nin that great assembly. Calm, self-restrained, almost frigid in\r\ndelivery, chaste and sternly simple in language, Mr. Asquith's\r\nperoration reached a height that few men could ever attain. The still\r\nHouse sate with its members raised to their highest point of endurance,\r\nand it was almost a relief when the stately flow came to an end, and men\r\nwere able to relieve their pent-up tide of feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF A GREAT WEEK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Goschen.]\r\n\r\nThe Tories were not in good heart at the beginning of the week which saw\r\nthe second reading of the Home Rule Bill carried on April 21st, and\r\nperhaps it was owing to this that they put up one of their very best\r\nmen. Mr. Goschen I have always held to be one of the really great\r\ndebaters of the House of Commons. It is true that he has almost every\r\nphysical disadvantage with which an orator could be cursed. His voice is\r\nhoarse, muffled, raucous, with some reminiscences of the Teutonic\r\nfatherland from which he remotely comes. His shortness of sight amounts\r\nalmost to a disability. Whenever he has anything to read he has to place\r\nthe paper under his eyes, and even then he finds it very difficult to\r\nread it. His action is like that of a distracted wind-mill. He beats the\r\nair with his whirling arms; he stands several feet from the table, and\r\nmoves backwards and forwards in this space in a positively distracting\r\nmanner. And yet he is a great debater.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Opposition.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Goschen, like every other orator of the Opposition, has fallen\r\non somewhat evil days, and is not at his very best now. \"The world,\"\r\nsaid Thackeray long ago, \"is a wretched snob, and is especially cold to\r\nthe unsuccessful.\" This applies to that portion of the world which\r\nchanges sides in the House of Commons according to the resolves of the\r\npopular verdict. Mr. Goschen, then, is not seen at his best in these\r\ndays when all his arguments can receive the triumphant and unanswerable\r\nretort of a majority in the division lobbies. But still, the speech of\r\nMr. Goschen on April 17th was an excellent one; it was really the first,\r\nsince the beginning of this debate, which struck me as giving something\r\nto answer. Acute, subtle, a dialectician to his finger-tips, Mr. Goschen\r\nis best as a critic, and as a bit of criticism, his attack on the Bill\r\nwas excellent. Mr. Morley found himself compelled for the first time for\r\ndays to take serious notes; here at last were points which it was\r\nnecessary to confront. After all the dreary platitudes of many days,\r\nthis was a mercy for which to be thankful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Randolph dull.]\r\n\r\nLord Randolph Churchill, rising on the following evening, was not at his\r\nbest. He has been passing through what Disraeli once called a campaign\r\nof passion in the provinces; and his speeches have been full of the\r\nwildest fury. But all the fire had become extinguished. When Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill makes up his mind to be rational, few people in the\r\nHouse of Commons can be more rational; but when he makes up his mind to\r\nthrow prudence, sense, and reserve to the winds, nobody can rise to such\r\nheights and descend to such depths of wild, unreasonable, bellowing\r\nToryism--always, of course, excepting Ashmead-Bartlett. But when he is\r\nrational he is often dull--when he is unreasonable he is often very\r\nentertaining. The speech of April 18th was a rational speech--it was,\r\ntherefore, a dull one. Lord Randolph is not what he was. The voice which\r\nwas formerly so resonant has become muffled and sometimes almost\r\nindistinct, and the manner has lost all the sprightliness which used to\r\nrelieve it in the olden days. The House of Commons is like the\r\nRevolution--it often swallows its own children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Father and son.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain might have been seen in two very different characters in\r\nthe course of that same evening. He is not a soft man--amid sympathetic\r\nsniggers from all the House, Mr. Morley at a later stage referred\r\nsarcastically to the \"milk of human kindness\" which flowed so copiously\r\nin his veins--but he is a man of strong and warm domestic affections. He\r\nhas the proud privilege of having in the House of Commons not only a\r\nson, but one who, in many respects, seems the very facsimile of himself,\r\nfor the likeness between Mr. Austen Chamberlain and his father is\r\nstartlingly close. This likeness is heightened by the similarity of\r\ndress--by the single eyeglass that is worn perennially in both cases,\r\nand, to a certain extent, by the walk. When the son began to speak this\r\nTuesday night, there was even a stronger sense of the resemblance\r\nbetween the two. The voice was almost the same, the gestures were the\r\nsame--the diction was not unlike--nearly all the tricks and mannerisms\r\nof the elder man were reproduced by the younger. For instance, when he\r\nis going to utter a good point, Mr. Chamberlain makes a pause--the son\r\ndoes the same: when Mr. Chamberlain is strongly moved, and wishes to\r\ndrive home some fierce thrust, there is a deep swell in his otherwise\r\neven voice, and there is the same in the voice of the son. Then there is\r\nthe same crisp, terse succession of sentences--altogether the likeness\r\nis wonderful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain pleased.]\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant, even to those who do not love Mr. Chamberlain either\r\npersonally or politically, to watch him during this episode. When the\r\nson first stood up, the pallor of the face, the unsteadiness of the\r\nvoice, the broken and stumbling accents, told of the high state of\r\nnervous strain through which he was passing, and it was easy to see that\r\nthe emotions of the son had communicated themselves to the father. Mr.\r\nChamberlain had his hat low down on his forehead so as to conceal his\r\nface and its tell-tale excitement as much as possible. But it turned out\r\nthat he need not have been in the least alarmed. The speech of young Mr.\r\nChamberlain, for a maiden speech, was really wonderful. It was lucid,\r\nwell knit, pointed, cogent. Its delivery was almost perfect; it had the\r\ntrue House of Commons air and manner. This young man will go far. I\r\nshouldn't be surprised if he became in time even a better debater than\r\nhis father. His education, I should say, is broader and deeper, his\r\nmind finer, and his temper sweeter and more under control. During the\r\nlatter portion of the speech his father's face had a smile, pleasant to\r\nbehold; one could forgive him a great deal of his hardness, rancour,\r\neven ferocity, for this manifestation--open and frank--of kindly\r\nhuman-feeling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And angry.]\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, there was another manifestation of Mr. Chamberlain\r\nin the course of this very evening. Shortly before ten o'clock Mr.\r\nMorley rose to make his reply. It was twenty minutes to ten when he\r\nrose. It was close upon midnight when he sate down. And yet there wasn't\r\none word too many--indeed, Mr. Morley might have gone even longer\r\nwithout wearying the House, for it was a speech which, although not free\r\nfrom some of the besetting weaknesses of his oratory, was an eloquent,\r\nimpressive and convincing addition to the great argument on the Irish\r\nquestion. Giving himself a certain freedom--departing from the\r\nover-severe self-restraint which he so often imposes upon\r\nhimself--abandoning the frigidity of manner which conceals from so many\r\npeople his warmth of heart and of temper, he spoke with a go, a fire and\r\na force of attack not very common with him. Above all things the speech\r\ngave the impression of one who spoke from the inside--who knew the\r\nsubjects of which he was talking, not merely in their general aspects,\r\nbut in their dark recesses--in their latent passion--in their awful and\r\nappalling depths. It was while this fine speech was being delivered that\r\nthe other and the darker side of Mr. Chamberlain's nature was to be\r\nseen. There are no such enmities as those between relatives or former\r\nfriends; and so it apparently is between Mr. Chamberlain and Mr.\r\nMorley--though it should be said most of the bitterness of the hatred\r\nseems to be on the one side. While Mr. Morley is speaking there is a\r\nfrown on the face of Mr. Chamberlain that never lifts. Now and then, the\r\nsulky and sullen and frowning silence was broken by an observation\r\nevidently of bitter scornfulness addressed to Sir Henry James, and once\r\nthere seemed even to be an angry interchange between him and Mr.\r\nCourtney because Mr. Courtney had ventured to put a civil question to\r\nMr. Morley. Mr. Morley had to address a few words of hearty\r\ncongratulation to Mr. Austen Chamberlain on his very successful speech.\r\nHe spoke with the slowness, hesitation, and effort that betrayed a\r\ncertain glimpse of the pain and grief that the political separations of\r\nlife produce in all but the hardest and coldest natures. It was a\r\ngraceful, generous, feeling tribute, but it did not soften Mr.\r\nChamberlain--the same steady unlifting frown was there--the same\r\n\"puss\"--and when Mr. Morley had finished, there was a repetition of the\r\nevidently scornful comment of Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A hit at Mr. Chamberlain.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Morley may well bear all this, for he was able to strike some\r\nvery effective blows at Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Chamberlain for a\r\nhard-hitter has a wonderfully keen appreciation and a very sensitive\r\nskin for anything like a dexterous hit at his own expense. Alluding to\r\nthe favourite argument of Mr. Chamberlain, that the speeches of Irish\r\nmembers in the past may have been deplorable, Mr. Morley asked were they\r\nthe only people who had made such speeches? They might be repentant\r\nsinners, but who so great a prodigal as the member for Birmingham? The\r\nloud and triumphant laughter which this produced at the expense of Mr.\r\nChamberlain, was followed up by another even more victorious thrust. The\r\nIrish members had abandoned prairie value in the same way as the member\r\nfor Birmingham had surrendered the doctrines of \"ransom\" and natural\r\nrights. Mr. Chamberlain was very uncomfortable, and soon showed it by an\r\ninterrupting cheer. \"Seriously,\" said Mr. Morley, passing from this\r\nlighter, but very effective vein. And then he was interrupted by his\r\nfoe. \"Hear, hear,\" shouted Mr. Chamberlain in that deep, raucous, fierce\r\nnote, in which he reveals the fierceness of his hatred, as though to say\r\nthat it was time for Mr. Morley to address himself to serious things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton.]\r\n\r\nSo the debate proceeded during the earlier part of the week; as it\r\nneared its close it increased in brilliancy, until in the last night it\r\nwent out in a blaze of splendour and glory. On the Thursday evening Mr.\r\nSexton was the speaker. He made a speech which was two hours and a half\r\nin duration; it was in my opinion too long--I think that except in the\r\nmost exceptional cases no orator ought to speak more than half an hour.\r\nAnd yet I would not have had the speech shorter by one second; and it is\r\na singular proof of the extraordinary command which this man holds over\r\nthe House of Commons that he kept its attention absolutely without a\r\nmoment's pause or cessation, during every bit of this tremendous strain\r\nupon his attention. With the exception of Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Sexton is\r\nthe one man in the House who is capable of such a feat. This is largely\r\ndue not merely to his oratorical powers but to the extraordinary range\r\nof his gifts. To the outside public--even to the House of Commons--he is\r\nchiefly known by his great rhetorical gifts; but this is only a part,\r\nand a small part, of his great mental equipment. His mastery over\r\nfigures in its firmness of grasp, its lightning-like rapidity, its\r\nretentiveness, is almost as great as that of a professional calculator.\r\nHe has a judgment, cold, equable, far-seeing, and he has a humour that\r\nis kindly but can also be scorching, and that has sometimes been deadly\r\nenough to leave wounds that never healed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain's arithmetic.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps not even Mr. Gladstone--certainly not Mr. Goschen--though he,\r\ntoo, is a past master in figures--is as formidable and destructive a\r\ngladiator in a fight over figures as Mr. Sexton; I pity any mortal who\r\ngets into grips with him on that arena. Mr. Chamberlain was the unhappy\r\nindividual whom Mr. Sexton took in hand. Mr. Chamberlain has the\r\nreputation of being a good man of business, he certainly was a most\r\nsuccessful one; and one would expect from him some power, at least, of\r\nbeing able to state figures correctly. When the figures he had\r\npresented to the country in a recent speech at Birmingham came under\r\nanalysis by Mr. Sexton, Mr. Chamberlain was exposed as a bungler as\r\nstupid and dense as one could imagine. Mr. Chamberlain's mighty fabric\r\nof a war indemnity of millions which the financial arrangements of this\r\nBill would inflict on England, melted before Mr. Sexton's\r\nexamination--palpably, rapidly, exactly as though it were a gaudy palace\r\nof snow which the midsummer sun was melting into mere slush. The\r\ncocksureness of Mr. Chamberlain makes his exposure a sort of comfort and\r\ndelight to the majority of the House; but still, the sense of his great\r\npowers--of his commanding position as a debater--of his formidableness\r\nas a political and Parliamentary enemy--made the House almost unwilling\r\nto realize that he could be taken up and reprimanded, and birched by\r\nanybody in the House with the completeness with which Mr. Sexton was\r\nperforming the task. Mark you, there was nothing offensive--there was\r\nnothing even severe in the language of Mr. Sexton's attack. It was\r\nsimply cold, pitiless, courteous but killing analysis--the kind of\r\nanalysis which the hapless and fraudulent bankrupt has to endure when\r\nhis castles in the air come to be examined under the cold scrutiny of\r\nthe Official Receiver in the Bankruptcy Court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Johnston of Ballykilbeg.]\r\n\r\nA different tone was that which Mr. Sexton assumed to Mr. Johnston of\r\nBallykilbeg. Mr. Johnston, known to the outer world as a fire-eater of\r\nthe most determined order, inside the House is one of the most popular\r\nof men, and with no section of the House is he more popular than with\r\nthose Irish Nationalists for whose blood he is supposed to thirst. With\r\ngentle and friendly wit Mr. Sexton dealt with the case of Mr. Johnston\r\nlining the ditch, declaring amid sympathetic laughter that the one\r\nobject of any Irish Nationalist who should meet the Orangemen in such a\r\nposition would be to take him out, even if he had to carry him to do so.\r\nThis reduction of the militancy of Ulster down to the level of playful\r\nsatire did much to relieve the House from the tension which the wild\r\nlanguage of Ulsteria had been calculated to provoke. Finally, there came\r\na beautiful peroration--tender, touching, well sustained--which was\r\nlistened to with breathless attention by the House, and produced as\r\nprofound a depth of emotion on the Liberal as even on the Irish Benches.\r\nIt was a peroration which lifted the great issue to all the heights of\r\nsolemnity, nobility, and supreme interest which it reaches in the mouth\r\nof an eloquent orator. This tremendous speech--in its variety, in its\r\npower--in its alternation of scathing scorn, copious analysis, playful\r\nand gentle wit--was perhaps the most remarkable example in our times of\r\nthe sway which an orator has over the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Carson.]\r\n\r\nMr. Carson was unfortunate in every sense in having to follow an oration\r\nof such extraordinary power, and in having to follow it at that dread\r\nhour when every member of the House of Commons is thinking of his\r\nlong-postponed dinner. The audience of \"the Sleuth Hound of\r\nCoercion\"--as Mr. Carson is usually called--if it was select, was at the\r\nsame time, enthusiastic and appreciative. The little band of Unionists,\r\nwho get very cold comfort, as a rule, during these hard times, sate\r\nsteadily in their seats and eagerly welcomed and warmly cheered Mr.\r\nCarson. Behind him, too, was a pretty strong band of Tories, and Mr.\r\nBalfour sate throughout his entire speech listening to it with the\r\nkeenest and most evident appreciation. I have already described the\r\nappearance of Mr. Carson and the impression he makes upon me; curiously\r\nenough, this impression was confirmed by an experience that afternoon. I\r\nhappened to stand at a point of the House where I saw Mr. Carson from\r\nprofile as he was speaking. He had just got to the point where, with a\r\nhoarse and deep note in his usually cold voice, he said to Mr. Morley\r\nthat if the Chief Secretary would move the omission of all the\r\n\"safeguards\" from the Bill, he would vote along with him. There was a\r\ntone almost of ferocity--the tone which conveyed all the rage and\r\ndespair of the Ascendency party in Ireland at the prospect of departing\r\npower--the fury of the Castle official that saw the approaching\r\noverthrow of all the powerful citadel of fraud and cruelty and wrong, of\r\nwhich he had been one of the chief pillars. And as Mr. Carson was\r\nuttering these words, I saw his profile--which often reveals more of\r\nmen's natures than the front face.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A curious reminiscence.]\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall be considered very fantastic--but do you know what I\r\nthought of at that very moment? Some years ago, I stood at Epsom close\r\nto the ropes and saw Fred Archer pass me as he swept like the whirlwind\r\nto the winning-post in the last Derby he ever rode. Between Mr. Carson\r\nand Mr. Fred Archer, especially in the profile, there is a certain and\r\neven a close resemblance; the same long lantern face, the same sunken\r\ncheeks, the same prominent mouth, the same skin dark as the gipsy's.\r\nNever shall I forget the look on Fred Archer's face at the moment when I\r\nsaw it--it was but for a second--and yet the impression dwells\r\nineffaceable upon my memory and imagination. There was a curious mixture\r\nof terror, resolve, hope, despair on the sunken cheeks that was almost\r\nappalling--that look represented, embodied, summed up, as though in some\r\nsudden glimpse of another and a nether world, all the terrible and awful\r\npassions that stormed at the hearts of thousands in the great gambling\r\npanorama all around. And there was something of the same look on the\r\nprofile of Mr. Carson--I could almost have pitied him and the party and\r\ntraditions and past which he represented as I saw its death-throes\r\nmarked on his suffering and fierce face.\r\n\r\nBut the speech of Mr. Carson was a clever one. Whatever the inner eye\r\nmay see in the depths of Mr. Carson's soul, to the outward eye he has an\r\nappearance of a self-possession amounting almost to the offensive. He is\r\ndressed almost as well as Mr. Austen Chamberlain, but, unlike Mr.\r\nChamberlain's promising lad--who still has much of the graceful shyness\r\nand unsteady nerve of youth--Mr. Carson has all the coolness,\r\nself-assertion, and hardness of the man who has passed through the\r\nfierce and tempestuous conflicts of Irish life. Mr. Carson stands at the\r\nbox and leans upon it as though he had been there all his life; he\r\nshoots his cuffs--to use a House of Commons' phrase--as dexterously and\r\nalmost as frequently as Mr. Gladstone; his points are stated slowly,\r\ndeliberately, with that wary and watchful look of the man who has been\r\naccustomed to utter the words that consigned men to the horrors of\r\nTullamore. The speech of Thursday evening was a clever speech. It wasn't\r\nbroad--it wasn't generous--there was not a note in it above the tone of\r\nthe Crown Prosecutor, but it was subtle, well-reasoned--the blows were\r\nhappy, and told--and the Tories and Unionists were hugely and justly\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The approach of the division.]\r\n\r\nAt last we are within sight of the end. Friday had come, and everybody\r\nknew that this was the day which would see the division; and, after all,\r\nthe division was the event of the debate. In moments such as these you\r\ncan hear the quickened throb of the House of Commons, and if you fail to\r\nnotice it you soon learn it from the public. In the lobbies outside\r\nstand scores of excited men and women begging, imploring,\r\nthreatening--using every means to get admission into the galleries to\r\nwitness a historic and immortal scene. Outside there is an even denser\r\ncrowd--ready to hoot or cheer their favourites. The galleries are all\r\ncrowded; peers stand on each other's toes, and patiently wait for hours.\r\nAbout ten o'clock a man rushes into the lobby, and there is a movement\r\nthat looks most like a scare--as though the messenger were some herald\r\nof disaster. In a few minutes you see a great stir and a curious\r\nsuppressed excitement in the lobby, and then you observe that the Prince\r\nof Wales has come down to pay the House one of his rare visitations, and\r\nto take that place above the clock which it is his privilege on these\r\noccasions to occupy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Henry James.]\r\n\r\nThe evening began with a speech of Sir Henry James for the Unionist\r\nparty--legal and dry as dust, but, towards the end, reaching a\r\nheight--or shall I say a depth--of fierce party passion. In language\r\nmore veiled, more deliberate, but as intelligible as Mr. Balfour's and\r\nLord Randolph Churchill's, the ex-Attorney-General called upon the\r\nOrangemen to rise in rebellion. And, working himself up gradually from\r\nthe slow and funereal tones which he usually employs, Sir Henry James\r\nwound up with a fierce, rude, savage gibe at Mr. Gladstone. Almost\r\nshouting out the word, \"Betrayed!\" he pointed a threatening and scornful\r\nfinger at the head of Mr. Gladstone, and the Tories and Unionists\r\nfrantically cheered.\r\n\r\nIt was more than ten o'clock when Mr. Balfour rose. The assembly was\r\nbrilliant in its density, its character, its pent-up emotion, and in\r\nmany respects the speech was worthy of the occasion. He was wise enough\r\nnot to entangle himself in the inextricable network of clauses and\r\nsub-sections. In broad, general lines he assailed the policy of the Bill\r\nand of the Government, and now and then worked up his party to almost\r\nfrenzied excitement. The cheers of the Tories were taken up by the\r\nUnionists, who thronged their benches with unusual density of\r\nattendance. Now and then there were fierce protests from the Irish\r\nBenches; but, on the whole, they were patient, self-restrained, and\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gladstone.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, meantime, was down early, after but a short stay for\r\ndinner. His face had that rapt look of reverie which it wears on all\r\nthese solemn and great occasions, and there was a slightly deadlier\r\npallor on the cheek. Mr. Balfour persisted with his speech to the bitter\r\nend, and now and then Mr. Gladstone gave an impatient and anxious look\r\nat the clock. The hands pointed to ten minutes to midnight before this\r\nman of eighty-three was on his legs to address a crowded, hot, jaded\r\nassembly in a speech that would wind up one of the great stages in the\r\ngreatest controversy of his life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opening.]\r\n\r\nWe who love and follow him hold our breaths, and our nervous anxiety\r\nrises almost to terror. Can he stand the strain?--will he break down\r\nfrom sheer physical fatigue and the exhaustion of long waiting? The\r\nfirst few notes of the deep voice are reassuring. The opening sentences\r\nalso have that full roll which nearly always is inevitable proof that\r\nthe great swelling opening will carry him on to the end; and yet there\r\nis anxiety. Those who know him well cannot help observing that there is\r\njust a slight trace of excitement, nervousness, and anxiety in the voice\r\nand manner. He has evidently been put out by the lateness of the hour to\r\nwhich the speech has been postponed. There is beside him a vast mass of\r\nnotes, and then, before he reaches that, there is the long speech to\r\nwhich he has just listened, many points of which it is impossible to\r\nleave unnoticed. And so the first ten minutes strike me as rather\r\npoor--poor, I mean, for Mr. Gladstone--and my heart sinks. In memory I\r\ngo back to that memorable and unforgettable speech on that terrible\r\nnight in 1886, when, with dark and disastrous defeat prepared for him in\r\nthe lobbies the moment he sat down, Mr. Gladstone delivered a speech,\r\nthe echoes of whose beautiful tones--immortal and ineffaceable--still\r\nlinger in the ear. And now the moment of Nemesis and triumph has come,\r\nand is he going to fall below the level of the great hour?\r\n\r\nAh! these fears are all vain. The exquisite cadence--the delightful\r\nbye-play--the broad, free gesture--the lofty tones of indignation and\r\nappeal--but, above all, the even tenderness, composure, and charity that\r\nendureth all things--all these qualities range through this magnificent\r\nspeech. Thus he wishes to administer to Sir Henry James a well-merited\r\nrebuke for his terrible and flagitious incitements, and, with uplifted\r\nhands, and in a voice of infinite scorn, Mr. Gladstone turns on Sir\r\nHenry, and overwhelms him, amid a tempest of cheers from the delighted\r\nIrishry and Liberals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chamberlain touched.]\r\n\r\nBut there is another and an even more extraordinary instance of the\r\npower, grace, and mastery of the mighty orator. The G.O.M. had made an\r\nallusion to that pleasant and promising speech of young Austen\r\nChamberlain, of which I have spoken already. Just by the way, with that\r\ndelightful and unapproachable lightness of touch which is the\r\nunattainable charm of Mr. Gladstone's oratory, he alluded to the speech\r\nand to Mr. Chamberlain himself. \"I will not enter into any elaborate\r\neulogy of that speech,\" said Mr. Gladstone. \"I will endeavour to sum up\r\nmy opinion of it by simply saying that it was a speech which must have\r\nbeen dear and refreshing to a father's heart.\" And then came one of the\r\nmost really pathetic scenes I have ever beheld in the House of\r\nCommons--a scene with that touch of nature which makes the whole akin,\r\nand, for the moment, brings the fiercest personal and political foes\r\ninto the holy bond of common human feeling. Mr. Chamberlain is\r\ncompletely unnerved--I should have almost said for the first time in his\r\nlife. I have seen this very remarkable man under all kinds of\r\ncircumstances--in triumph--in disaster--in rage--in composure--but never\r\nbefore--not even in the very ecstasy of the hours of party\r\nfeeling--never before did I see him lose for a moment his\r\nself-possession. First, he bowed low to Mr. Gladstone in gratitude--and\r\nthen the tears sprang to his eyes; his lips trembled painfully, and his\r\nhand sprang to his forehead, as though to hide the woman's tears that\r\ndid honour to his manhood. And, curiously enough, the feeling did not\r\npass away. I know not whether Mr. Chamberlain was out of sorts on this\r\ngreat night; but his manner was very different on this night of nights;\r\nindeed, from what it has been at every other period of this fierce,\r\nstormy Session. He cheered as loudly and as frequently as the best of\r\nthe rank and file--interrupted--in short, manifested all the passions of\r\nthe hour. But on that Friday night--specially after this allusion of\r\nMr. Gladstone's to his son--he sate silent, and in a far-off reverie.\r\n\r\nBut the Old Man still passes on his triumphant way--now gently, now\r\nstormy--listened to in delight from all parts; and when he is now and\r\nthen interrupted by some small and rude Tory, dismissing the\r\ninterruption with delightful composure and a good humour that nothing\r\ncan disturb. It is only the marvellous powers of the man that can keep\r\nthe House patient, for it is pointing to one o'clock, and the division\r\nhas not yet come. But at last he is approaching the peroration. It has\r\nthe glad note of coming triumph--subdued, however, to the gentle tone of\r\ngood taste. It is delivered, like the whole of the speech, with\r\nextraordinary nerve, and without any abatement of the fire, the\r\nvehemence, the sweeping rapidity of the best days. And it ends in notes,\r\nclear, resonant--almost like a peal of joy-bells.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The division.]\r\n\r\nThen there are the shouts of \"Aye\" and \"No,\" with \"Agreed, agreed!\" from\r\nsome Irish Benches--a humorous suggestion that highly tickles everybody.\r\nMr. Gladstone is almost the last to enter from the lobby of the\r\nmajority. Alone, slowly, with pale face, he walks up the floor. The\r\nsignificance of the great moment, the long years of struggle, of heroic\r\ncourage, of inflexible temerity, of patient and splendid hope, all this\r\nrushes tumultuously to the minds of his friends and followers, and, in a\r\nsecond, without a word of warning or command, the Liberals and the Irish\r\nhave sprung to their feet, and, underneath their cheers--their waving\r\nhats, their uplifted forms--Mr. Gladstone passes through to his seat as\r\nunder a canopy.\r\n\r\nAt last, Tom Ellis, the Junior Liberal Whip, quickly comes up the\r\nfloor--the paper is handed to Mr. Marjoribanks--this announces we have\r\nwon--a good cheer, but short, for we want to know the numbers--and then\r\nthey are read out.\r\n\r\n  For the second reading           347\r\n  Against                          304\r\n\r\nThe majority is 43. The Lord be praised! we have polled all our men! And\r\nthen more cheers--taken up outside in the deeper bellow of the big\r\ncrowd, and then more waving of hats and another great reception to Mr.\r\nGladstone. And so, as the streaks of day rose on this hour of Ireland's\r\ncoming dawn, we went to our several homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET, OBSTRUCTION, AND EGYPT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir William.]\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt, on April 24th, had the double honour of speaking\r\nbefore the smallest audience and making the best Budget speech for many\r\nyears. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has two manners. He can be as\r\nboisterous, exuberant, and gay, as any speaker in the House, and he can\r\nalso be as lugubrious as though his life had been spent in the service\r\nof an undertaker. He was in the undertaker mood this evening. Slowly,\r\nsolemnly, sadly, he unfolded his story of the finances of the country.\r\nHe had taken the trouble to write down every word of what he had to\r\nsay--an evil habit to which he has adhered all his life. But,\r\nnotwithstanding these two things--which are both, to my mind, capital\r\ndefects in Parliamentary speaking--Sir William put his case with such\r\nextraordinary lucidity, that everybody listened in profound attention to\r\nevery word he uttered; and when he sate down, he was almost overwhelmed\r\nwith the chorus of praise which descended on his head from all quarters\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt imitated most Chancellors of the Exchequer, in\r\nkeeping his secret to the latest possible moment. Like a good dramatist\r\nalso, he arranged his figures and the matter of his speech so well that\r\nthe final solution became inevitable, and the final solution, of course,\r\nwas the addition of a penny to the income-tax. The debate which followed\r\nthe Budget speech was quiet, discursive, friendly to the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer. Mr. Picton is a formidable man to Chancellors of the\r\nExchequer--for he has very strong ideas of reform--especially on the\r\nbreakfast-table; but Mr. Picton is rational as well as Radical; and he\r\ncordially acknowledged the duty of postponing even the reforms on which\r\nRadicals have set their hearts until more convenient times and seasons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belfast.]\r\n\r\nIt was after midnight when a very serious bit of business took place.\r\nThe House gets to know beforehand when anything like serious debate is\r\ngoing to take place--even though there be no notice. Accordingly, in\r\nspite of the lateness of the hour, the House was pretty full, and there\r\nwas a preliminary air of expectation and excitement. One of the iron\r\nrules of the House of Commons is that the Speaker cannot leave the chair\r\nuntil a motion for the adjournment of the House has been carried. This\r\nis always proposed by the senior Government Whip. The motion is usually\r\ncarried in dumb show, and with that mumble in which business is carried\r\nthrough in the House when there is no opposition. But it is one of the\r\nancient and time-honoured privileges of the House of Commons to raise\r\nalmost any question on the motion for the adjournment of the House. The\r\nreason, I assume, is that the representatives of the people--when about\r\nto separate--thought in the olden days that it ought to be their right\r\nto raise any question whatsoever, lest the king in their absence should\r\ntake advantage of the situation. Many of the rules of the\r\nHouse--including several which lend themselves to obstruction--are due\r\nto this feeling of constant vigilance and suspicion towards the Crown.\r\n\r\nMr. Sexton is one of the men whose life is centred in the House of\r\nCommons. He will attend to no other business, except under the direst\r\npressure--he has no other interests--though he used to be one of the\r\ngreatest of readers, and still can quote Shakespeare and other\r\nmasterpieces of English literature better than any man in the House\r\nexcept Mr. Justin McCarthy. Thus, when he rose after midnight, he had\r\nin his notes before him a perfectly tabulated account of the riots in\r\nBelfast, so that every single fact was present to his mind. The story he\r\nhad to tell is already known--the attacks on Catholic workmen--on\r\nCatholic boys--on Catholic girls--by the sturdy defenders of law,\r\nloyalty, and order in Belfast. It was not an occasion for strong\r\nspeech--the facts spoke with their silent eloquence better than any\r\ntongue could do. The business was all done very quietly--it had the\r\nsombre reticence of all tragic crises; everybody felt the importance of\r\nthe affair too deeply to give way to strong manifestation of feeling.\r\nBut there were significant and profound, though subdued, marks of\r\nfeeling on the Liberal Benches; and everybody could see what names were\r\nin the minds of everybody.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Asquith as leader.]\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith was for the moment the leader of the House. Though he has\r\nstill some of the ingenuous shyness of youth--though he is modest with\r\nall his honours--though he has charmed everybody by the utter absence of\r\nswagger and side in his dazzling elevation--there is a ready\r\nadaptability about Mr. Asquith to a Parliamentary situation, which is as\r\nastonishing as it is rare in men who have spent their lives in the\r\natmosphere of the law courts. The aptitude with which the right word\r\nalways comes to his lips--his magnificent composure, and, at the same\r\ntime, his power of striking the nail right on the head and right _into_\r\nthe head--all these things come out on an occasion such as that of April\r\n24th. Very quietly, but very significantly, he told the story of the\r\nriots; and very quietly and very significantly he spoke of the\r\nresponsibility of the Salisburys, and the Balfours, and the Jameses,\r\nwhose wild and wicked words had led to this outburst of medieval\r\nbigotry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Dunbar Barton.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dunbar Barton made a valiant but vain attempt to stem the tide\r\nagainst him, but he, like every other Unionist, was weighted down by the\r\nfeeling that the Orangemen were doing immense service to the cause of\r\nHome Rule by their brutality. However, the fumes of Unionist oratory\r\nseem to have ascended to the heads of all the excitable young men of the\r\nTory party. Mr. Dunbar Barton, personally, is one of the gentlest of\r\nmen; his manners are kind and good-natured enough to make him a\r\nuniversal favourite--even with his vehement Nationalist foes; and he\r\nspeaks with evident sincerity. But he had so worked himself up that he\r\nbabbled blithely of spending a portion of his days in penal\r\nservitude--talked big about a mysterious organization which was being\r\ngot ready in Ulster, and declared that the day would come when he would\r\nstand by the side of the Orangemen in the streets of Belfast. He was\r\nlistened to for the most part in silence, until he tripped into an\r\nunseemly remark about Mr. Gladstone, when the much-tried Liberals burst\r\ninto an angry protest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Arnold Forster.]\r\n\r\nVery different was Mr. Arnold Forster. I must be pardoned if, as an\r\nIrishman, I always see something genial and not wholly unlovely even in\r\nthe most violent Irish enemy. We all like Johnston of Ballykilbeg--most\r\nof us rather like Colonel Saunderson, and Mr. Dunbar Barton is decidedly\r\npopular. But this Arnold Forster--with his dry, self-complacent,\r\nself-sufficient fanaticism--is intolerable and hateful. He never gets up\r\nwithout making one angry. There is no man whose genius would entitle him\r\nto half the arrogant self-conceit of this young member. Acrid, venomous,\r\nrasping, he injures his own cause by the very excess of his gall and by\r\nthe exuberance of his pretension. He also saw that the riots would do no\r\ngood, and he hinted darkly of what he called \"ordered resistance,\"\r\nwhatever that means. But, on the whole, the advocates of the Orangemen\r\nmade a very poor show.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tory obstruction.]\r\n\r\nThe Tories thus early developed the policy of preventing the Government\r\npassing any Bill--English or Irish--good or bad. Whenever a good English\r\nBill stood as the first order--a Bill which they did not dare to\r\noppose--they found some excuse for moving the adjournment of the House.\r\nThis is a privilege which was intended to be used very rarely, but in\r\nthe course of the present Session it has been very freely resorted\r\nto--especially when it has afforded a chance of keeping off good\r\nGovernment business. On Tuesday, April 25th, the excuse given was that\r\nMr. Bryce had been guilty of political partisanship in adding a batch of\r\nLiberals to the Bench in Lancashire over the head of Lord Sefton--the\r\nTory or Unionist Lord-Lieutenant of the county. Mr. Legh, a young,\r\nsilent, and retiring Tory member, began the attack, and did so in a very\r\nneat, well-worded, and pretty little speech. Mr. Hanbury--who is making\r\nhis fame as a champion obstructive--followed this up, and Mr. Curzon\r\naddressed the House in his superior style. Mr. Bryce was able to blow to\r\npieces the fabric of attack which had been so laboriously erected\r\nagainst him by stating a few facts, of which these may be given as a\r\nfair specimen. When Mr. Bryce came into office, of the borough\r\nmagistrates in Lancashire 507 were Unionists and only 159 were Liberals.\r\nOn the county bench there were 522 Unionists and 142 Liberals. This was\r\na crushing reply, and an even more satisfactory retort came in the shape\r\nof the division, when 260 voted for the Government, and only 186\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tommy \"Burt.\"]\r\n\r\nNearly three hours of precious public time had been wasted over this\r\nwretched business, and at last, for the third or fourth time, the debate\r\nwas resumed on the second reading of the Employers' Liability Bill. An\r\namendment of Mr. Chamberlain's had been the obstacle which stood in the\r\nway of the Bill all this time. After the debate had gone on for hours,\r\nMr. Chamberlain got up and declared that his amendment had served its\r\npurpose--an awkward way of putting it, which the Liberals were not slow\r\nto take up. The debate was made remarkable by the first speech of any\r\nimportance made by Mr. Burt since he became a member of the Ministry.\r\nMr. Burt is the most popular of members, and there was a ring of genuine\r\ndelight in the welcome given to the honest, modest, genuine working man\r\nstanding at the Treasury Bench, and symbolising the revolution of the\r\ntimes. Mr. Burt spoke ably and well, but it was in a foreign\r\ntongue--which it takes a little time for even a quick linguist to\r\nunderstand. This Northumbrian burr is the strongest accent in the House;\r\neven the broadest Scotch is less difficult to catch. It is curious how\r\nthe different parts of the country betray themselves by their speech.\r\nThere are Scotchmen whom it is not easy to follow, and there are very\r\nfew of them who speak with anything like an English accent. Even the\r\nmost fluent of the Welshmen speak with a certain hesitation, betraying\r\ntheir bilingual infancy and youth. The Irish have as many accents nearly\r\nas there are members. The Northumbrian burr, however, is a tongue apart.\r\nIt has the pleasantness of every foreign tongue, and since Mr. Joseph\r\nCowen left Parliamentary life, Mr. Burt is the only member who speaks it\r\nin its pristine purity. The Tories were closured finally, though they\r\nhad their revenge by preventing the Bill from going to the Grand\r\nCommittee, and the work of justice is a little longer postponed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Goschen playful.]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, April 27th, the debate began on Sir William Harcourt's\r\nBudget; and it found Mr. Goschen in an unusually playful mood. He had a\r\ntask for which his talents eminently fitted him. Irresolute, timid,\r\nchangeable, he is the very worst man in the world for constructive\r\nlegislation; but give him the opportunity of criticising what somebody\r\nelse has proposed, and he is in his real element, and is, perhaps, the\r\nvery best man in the House of Commons. There wasn't much to criticise in\r\nthe Budget of Sir William Harcourt from the Tory point of view. Finding\r\nhimself with a deficit the Liberal leader was unable to go in for any\r\nstartling novelty, especially in a Session when everything is to be\r\nopposed in order that Home Rule may be defeated. But one would have\r\nthought that this would have delighted the timid and conservative soul\r\nof Mr. Goschen. Not a bit of it. Taking cleverly the rather auroral\r\npromises of the election period, Mr. Goschen contrasted all these hopes\r\nand glowing prospects with the thin and meagre fare of Sir William's\r\nBudget. It was very well done--full of unwonted fire, of biting and\r\neffective raillery and of excellent party hits; it lit up for a brief\r\nspace the sombreness which has fallen so completely on the Tory Benches\r\nin this year of wails and lamentations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir William as an early Christian.]\r\n\r\nBut the debate soon relapsed under a soporific speech from Sir John\r\nLubbock, who made an insinuating proposal to open a discussion on Home\r\nRule in the midst of the debate on the Imperial Budget. Sir William was\r\na delight during these proceedings. Everybody knows that he has both a\r\nwarm heart and a warm temper, and there have been times when the\r\ncollisions between himself and Mr. Goschen have seemed to indicate a\r\nviolence of personal as well as of party antagonism. But the duty of\r\ngreat ministers is to practise the scriptural principle of turning the\r\nother cheek to the smiter. It is wonderful, indeed, to see how humanity\r\ncan attune itself to a situation. The most violent and vehement\r\nfree-lance below the gangway sobers down in office to politeness, and\r\npeace with all men of good or bad will. Sir William, sitting on the\r\nTreasury Bench that night--beneath the wild tirade of Mr. Goschen--under\r\nthe dreary drip of Sir John Lubbock--was a sight that a new Addison\r\nmight show to his child; not that he might see how a Christian might\r\ndie, but how a great Christian official could suffer with all the\r\npatience of silent and suffering merit. There was a look of almost\r\ndazzling and beatific sanctity on Sir William's face that was perfectly\r\ndelightful to behold. And when he got up to reply to Mr. Goschen and to\r\nSir John Lubbock, whither had departed that splendid rotundity of\r\nvoice--that resonant shout of triumph or of defiance? Sir William coo'd\r\ngently as the white-feathered dove; and the Tory Benches, which had been\r\nebullient with excitement a few moments before, could not find it in\r\ntheir hearts to do other than listen reverently to this good and holy\r\nman expostulating with heathen foes. And thus the first resolution of\r\nthe Budget got quietly through, which was exactly what the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer wanted; whereupon there might have been observed, perhaps,\r\nby a close looker-on, a sinking of one of Sir William's eyelids, which\r\nmight have suggested in a lesser mortal the wink of the man who takes\r\noff the mask when the comedy is over. Sir William is a splendid artiste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A great night.]\r\n\r\nIt was probably under the influence of Sir William that this turned out\r\nto be the greatest and best night the Government had had so far. The\r\nRailway Servants' Bill got through its third reading amid cheers, and\r\nthen, before it knew where it was, the House found itself actually in\r\nthe same night discussing a third Ministerial measure--the Scotch\r\nFisheries Bill. It is one of the privileges of Scotland that nobody\r\ntakes the least interest in her measures outside her own\r\nrepresentatives, and that even they are sombre and joyless in the\r\nexpression of their delight. The demand for Scotch Home Rule does not\r\ncome assuredly from the intervention of English or Irish speech. I have\r\nnever seen the House with more than a score or two of members when a\r\nScotch question is under discussion, and on the rare occasions on which\r\na Southron does dare to intrude upon the sacred domain, it is with the\r\nmost shamefaced looks. And so Sir George Trevelyan and his Scotch\r\nfriends were allowed to have their nice little tea-party without any\r\ninterruption, and the Bill got very nicely through. Thus ended a\r\nremarkable night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bullet in Downing Street.]\r\n\r\nAnd now I come to the point which, after all, had been the most\r\ninteresting during the week, and which, though rarely mentioned, was in\r\neverybody's mind. It was on the Thursday evening that Mr. Sexton got up\r\nquietly to ask whether the reports published in the evening papers were\r\ntrue, that a man had been arrested the previous night in Downing Street,\r\nwho had apparently intended to attempt the assassination of the Prime\r\nMinister. There was death-like stillness all over the House as Mr.\r\nSexton put his question--picking his words slowly and deliberately. If\r\nmen were not so anxious and so shocked there might have been some\r\ndemonstration of the vehement anger which was felt in so many breasts as\r\nMr. Sexton brought out the words which put in collocation in the mind of\r\nthe unfortunate lunatic the idea of attempting to kill Mr. Gladstone,\r\nand the phrase of Sir Henry James during the debate on the Home Rule\r\nBill. But feeling was too intense and solemn for outspoken or loud\r\nutterance, and Mr. Sexton was allowed to put his question to the end\r\nwithout any interruption from the intensely excited and profoundly\r\nthrilled assembly. This is one of the curiosities of Parliamentary and\r\nBritish nature--that the moments of tensest feeling are so often those\r\nwhich, to a stranger, would appear listless, indifferent, impassive. Mr.\r\nAsquith spoke in tones suitable to the temper of the assembly. This was\r\na very grave matter, he said; but it was for the moment before the\r\ncourts of law, and his lips were sealed. And so the subject dropped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone.]\r\n\r\nThe people were asking themselves what would happen, when Mr. Gladstone\r\nentered the House; but if there had been any desire to mark the\r\noccasion, he himself prevented it. He dropped more quietly into his seat\r\nthan usual, and at the moment when, to a thin House, Sir William was\r\ngiving one of those gentle and beatific answers to which I have already\r\nalluded. To judge by Mr. Gladstone's quietness of entrance, nothing\r\nunusual had happened to him, and he himself had declined even to talk\r\nabout the matter. And yet there was a certain look as of reverie on his\r\nface--as though of a man who had looked into that dark and hideous abyss\r\ncalled Death. He had not been looking very well for some days, and\r\nperhaps there was not--though imagination saw it--a deadlier pallor than\r\nusual on the face. But it was only when he was sitting on the deserted\r\nbench beside Sir William Harcourt that one had an opportunity of\r\ndetecting any difference between his usual appearance and his\r\nappearance at that particular moment. The minute he had any part to take\r\nin the proceedings of the House, he was just as alert, cheerful,\r\nself-composed as ever. This wonderful man is as much a miracle\r\nphysically as mentally. The giant intellect is backed by a steady nerve,\r\nthe perfect mind by the perfect body. And thus he is able to go through\r\ntrials, dangers, fatigues, which would destroy any ordinary man, as\r\nthough nothing had occurred. During this week, indeed, he was especially\r\nplayful. On the Tuesday night, when the onslaught was being made on Mr.\r\nBryce, Sir Henry James spoke of Lord Sefton as being a strong Liberal.\r\nMr. Gladstone uttered a quiet, gentle, deprecatory \"Oh!\" whereupon Sir\r\nHenry James reiterated his statement with a look of surprise and shock.\r\nMr. Gladstone didn't depart from his attitude of gentle and almost\r\nplaintive remonstrance. He waved his hand mildly, and with a smile, and\r\nSir Henry James was allowed to proceed to the solemn end of his solemn\r\nharangue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A visit to the Lords.]\r\n\r\nIt is not often that a rational man takes the trouble of paying a visit\r\nto the House of Lords. But that assembly was certainly worth a visit on\r\nMay 1st. When the fight in Woodford, County Galway, was at its height,\r\nand everybody was repeating the name of Lord Clanricarde, people began\r\nto ask if there were ever such a person, or if he were not merely the\r\ncreation of some morbid imagination--desirous of conjuring up a human\r\nbogey for the purpose of demonstrating the iniquities of Irish\r\nlandlordism. The story on the estate which he owned, and whose destinies\r\nhe controlled, was that, on one occasion, a strange spectral figure had\r\nbeen seen following the coffin of the old Clanricarde to the tomb of his\r\nfathers; that the figure had disappeared as suddenly and as noiselessly\r\nas it had come; that it had not reappeared even on the solemn occasion\r\nwhen again the historic and century-old vaults of the family graveyard\r\nhad opened to receive the late lord's wife and the existing lord's\r\nmother. Writing his missives from afar--invisible, unapproachable,\r\nunknown--or known, rather, only by harsh refusal--by dogged, obdurate\r\nrejection of all terms--save the full pound of flesh--not even rendered\r\nhuman by passionate and eloquent outburst of remonstrance, but\r\nrepresented by thin, brief, business-like and curt notes as of a very\r\ncrusty solicitor--such Lord Clanricarde appeared to the imaginations of\r\nthe people of the district of which he was almost the supreme master.\r\nThere were riots--fierce conflicts extending over days--then dreary\r\nsentences of lengthy imprisonments, with gaol tragedies; but still this\r\nstrange, dry, inarticulate, obstinate figure remained immutable, always\r\ninvisible, unapproachable, obdurate, spectral. Even the Tory leaders\r\nwere disgusted and wearied, and Mr. Balfour was careful, in the very\r\ncrisis and agony of his fight with the National League, to disavow all\r\nsympathy with the strange being that was bringing to his assistance all\r\nthe mighty resources of an Empire's army, an Empire's exchequer, and an\r\nEmpire's overwhelming power to crush in blood, in the silence of the\r\ncell and the deeper silence of the tomb, all resistance to his imperious\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entry of a ghost.]\r\n\r\nIt must have been with something of a shock that the House of Lords,\r\nwith all its well-trained and high-bred self-control, found that this\r\ncurious and fateful figure was within its gates. Probably, to scarcely\r\nhalf-a-dozen of his colleagues and fellow-peers, was this figure\r\nanything but a strange and unexpected incursion from the dim ghost-land,\r\nin which, hermit-like, he seems to dwell. Indeed, the Marquis of\r\nLondonderry was careful to explain that he had no personal acquaintance\r\nwith the man whose case he was defending against the action of the\r\nCommission presided over by Mr. Justice Mathew. And it was easy to see,\r\nthat Lord Clanricarde was a stranger, and a very lonely one, too, in\r\nthat assembly in which he is entitled to sit and vote on the nation's\r\ndestinies. On a back seat, on the Liberal side of the House, silent,\r\nforlorn, unspeaking and unspoken to, he sat throughout the long and\r\ntedious debate in which he was a protagonist. There was, indeed,\r\nsomething shocking to the sense--shocking in being so surprising--that\r\nthis should be the figure around which one of the fiercest and most\r\ntragic political struggles of our time should have surged. He is a man\r\nslightly above the middle height, thin in face and in figure. Somehow or\r\nother, there is a general air about him that I can only describe by the\r\nword shabby--I had almost ventured on the term ragged. The clothes hang\r\nsomewhat loosely--are of a pattern that recalls a half century ago--and\r\nhave all the air of having been worn until they are positively\r\nthreadbare. Altogether, there is about this inheritor of a great\r\nname--of vast estates--of a title that in its days was almost kingly--an\r\nair that suggests a combination between the recluse and the poor man of\r\nletters, who makes his home in the reading-room of the British Museum.\r\nIt was also a peculiarity of the position that he seemed an almost\r\nunwelcome visitant, even to those who had to defend him. There was an\r\nawful pause when he rose, silently and so spectre-like, from his seat in\r\nthe dim land of the back benches, and passed to the seat immediately\r\nbehind the Marquis of Salisbury. Lord Salisbury made a very vivid and\r\namusing speech in the course of the evening, in defence of Lord\r\nClanricarde and in an attack on Mr. Justice Mathew; but observers\r\nthought they saw a look of palpable discomfort pass across his face at\r\nthe approach of the Marquis of Clanricarde. The Lord of Woodford handed\r\nto Lord Salisbury a little bundle of papers; in the distance, the bundle\r\nhad an inexpressibly shabby look--the look one might expect on the\r\nbundle which some Miss Flit of the Legislature would bring every day, as\r\nthe record of her undetermined claim. Altogether, this appearance of\r\nLord Clanricarde in the glimpses of the moon, rather added to the\r\nmysterious atmosphere in which he loves to live.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Charles Dilke.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a very interesting debate was going on in the House of\r\nCommons. I have already remarked that Sir Charles Dilke has, in an\r\nextremely short time, re-established that mastery over the ear and the\r\nmind of the House of Commons which he used to exercise with such\r\nextraordinary power in the old days before misfortune overcame him. It\r\nis a power and mastery derived from a perfect House of Commons mind. Sir\r\nCharles Dilke, doubtless, has written on many subjects outside mere\r\npolitics; but in politics his whole heart and soul are concentrated.\r\nThere is no man in the House of Commons so thoroughly political. It\r\nwould be bewildering to give even the heads of the subjects on which he\r\nhas written and in which he is profoundly learned. He has written about\r\nour Army--he could tell you everything about every army corps in the\r\nGerman Army--he knows all about every fortress on the French\r\nfrontier--he can convey to you a photographic picture of every great\r\npublic man on the Continent--he would be able in the morning to take\r\ncharge of the Admiralty, and over and on top of all this knowledge he\r\ncould tell you every detail of the law of registration, of parochial\r\nrating, of vestry work, and all the rest of that curious technical, dry,\r\ndetailed information which raises the ire of parish souls, and forms the\r\nfierce conflicts of suburban ratepayers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Egypt.]\r\n\r\nIt could be seen after he had been five minutes on his legs that Sir\r\nCharles Dilke was about to give on Egypt a speech which would suggest\r\nthis sense of easy and complete mastery of all the facts, and that,\r\ntherefore, the speech would be a thorough success. And so it was--so\r\nsuccessful, indeed, that it was listened to with equal attention by the\r\nTories as by the Liberals, though nothing could be more abhorrent to the\r\nTory imagination than the proposal by Sir Charles Dilke of an early\r\nevacuation of Egypt. Perhaps their indignation was a little mitigated by\r\nthe fact which Sir Charles Dilke brought out with such clearness, that\r\nLord Salisbury was just as deeply committed to the eventual evacuation\r\nof Egypt as any other public man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An awkward situation.]\r\n\r\nIt was curious to watch the House of Commons during this debate. There\r\nis no doubt that a very awkward situation was before that assembly. On\r\nthe one hand, there were the interests of the country--as they are\r\nunderstood by the Tory party; on the other, there was a very difficult\r\nparty situation--a situation difficult enough to tempt even the most\r\npatriotic, self-denying, and impartial Tory to gaze on the Liberal\r\nleaders opposite with a certain amount of mischievous curiosity. How was\r\nMr. Gladstone going to make a speech which would fulfil those extremely\r\ndiverse purposes? First, leave the door open for a continued stay for\r\nsome time longer, and at the same moment for final evacuation; secondly,\r\nplease Sir Wm. Harcourt on the one side, and Lord Rosebery on the other;\r\nthirdly, keep together a party which ranges from the strong foreign\r\npolicy of moderate men to the ultra-nonintervention of Mr. Labouchere.\r\nMr. Gladstone had, however, to do a good deal more than this. For it was\r\neasy to see from the condition of the Tory seats, and especially from\r\nthe attitude of the front Opposition Bench, that party instinct had\r\nsuggested that this was just one of the occasions on which the\r\nGovernment might be put in a very tight place. Let Mr. Gladstone say\r\nsomething which would satisfy Mr. Labouchere, and immediately Mr.\r\nGoschen would be down upon him--the late Chancellor of the Exchequer had\r\nthe air of a man who was thoroughly primed for damaging criticism and\r\nardent attack--with a philippic charging him with abandoning the most\r\nsacred interests of the country. Indeed, it was quite evident that Mr.\r\nGladstone had to face a very ugly little question, and that his\r\npolitical foes had come down in full force to enjoy the spectacle of a\r\nChristian flung to the lions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A historic triumph.]\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how it was done--I have read the speech in the\r\n_Times_ report--and I know that some people brought away from the speech\r\nno other impression than that it was delivered in a low tone of voice,\r\nand was not easily grasped; but the fact is, that judged by results this\r\nlittle speech, not much above half-an-hour in duration, was one of the\r\nmost extraordinary triumphs of Mr. Gladstone's long oratorical life.\r\nWhat constitutes the greatest of all Parliamentary triumphs? It is that\r\nwithout abandoning your own principles, you shall so state a case that\r\neven your bitterest political opponents will rest contented with, and be\r\nready to accept, your speech as the expression of their views. And this\r\nis just what occurred. Mr. Goschen, I have said, came down to the House\r\nchock-full of attack--I have, indeed, heard that he has confessed to\r\nhaving been prepared to make a speech of some length. On the other side\r\nof the House there sat Labby--full of that dogged, immutable Radicalism\r\nwhich will make no distinction between Liberal and Tory when his\r\nprinciples of foreign policy are at stake; and he was ready to pounce\r\nupon the Prime Minister if he had detected any departure from the narrow\r\nand straight path which leads to Radical salvation. In the background\r\nwere the dim forces of Unionism, more eager--perhaps even more\r\nreckless--in readiness to attack Mr. Gladstone than his opponents on the\r\nopposite benches. And behind them and above them, in all parts of the\r\nHouse, was that countless host of busybodies, bores and specialists who\r\nsee in Egypt an opportunity of airing fads, fanaticism, or vanities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A great eirenicon.]\r\n\r\nThe paper which contained the list of pairs for the night was crammed\r\nwith the names of members from both sides, who, anticipating a debate of\r\nhours' duration, had wisely resolved to spend the interval between the\r\nmotion and a division in the bosoms of their families--miles away from\r\nthe floor of the House of Commons. The Whips had prepared their\r\nfollowers for a big division somewhere about midnight. And, lo! on all\r\nthis vast and turbulent sea of conflicting waves the Prime Minister\r\npoured half an hour of oratorical oil, and the waters were stilled, and\r\nthe great deep at perfect rest. In other words, Mr. Goschen threw away\r\nhis notes; Labby advised Sir Charles Dilke not to go to a division; the\r\ndebate had not begun and then it was over, and all that followed was\r\naddressed to a House empty of everybody. The Old Man--dexterous, calm,\r\ninstinctive--had spoken the right word to meet every view, and there was\r\nnothing more for anybody to say. There is nobody else in the House who\r\ncan do it; when his voice is stilled, the greatest of all Parliamentary\r\nsecrets will die with him--the secret of saying the exact thing in the\r\nmost difficult and embarrassing of situations. To the outside public,\r\nperhaps, this speech appeared nothing remarkable, and the allusions to\r\nit I have seen in the press have been few and perfunctory. You should\r\nhear House of Commons' opinion; you should listen to Unionists who hate\r\nhim, to Tories who distrust him, to know what an estimate was formed of\r\nthis marvellous speech by House of Commons' opinion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The triumph of the miners.]\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday, again, Mr. Gladstone gave another example of his\r\nextraordinary dexterity. The miners had come down in full force to\r\ndemand a legal eight hours. Sam Woods, of the Ince Division, on the one\r\nside, John Burns, of the Battersea Fields, on the other, frowned on the\r\nOld Man and bade him surrender. Behind him sat the great Princes of\r\nIndustry--silent, but none the less militant, fierce, and minatory;\r\nopposite him was Lord Randolph Churchill, ready to raise the flag of\r\nSocial Democracy and to wave it before the advancing masses against the\r\nLiberal party. Out of this difficulty, Mr. Gladstone rescued himself\r\nwith all that perfect, that graceful ease which he most displays when\r\nsituations are most critical. The debate was further made remarkable by\r\na speech from Lord Randolph Churchill, who, amid the grim and ominous\r\nsilence of the Tory Benches, thundered against Capital and Capitalists\r\nin tones for which Trafalgar Square or the Reformers' Tree would be the\r\nappropriate environment; and then came the remarkable division, with 279\r\nfor the Bill and 201 against.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hull Again.]\r\n\r\nThis was not the only victory which Labour was able to win in the course\r\nof this week. The House presented a very notable spectacle on May 4th.\r\nIt was only by the aid of the Irish members, it is true, that Mr.\r\nHavelock Wilson was able to get the necessary forty to procure the\r\nadjournment of the House for the discussion of the Hull strike; but\r\nthen, when Mr. Wilson was enabled to bring the subject before the House,\r\nhe was listened to with an attention almost painful in its seriousness\r\nand gravity. Nothing, indeed, shows more plainly the vast social and\r\npolitical changes of our time, than this transformation in the attitude\r\nof the House of Commons towards labour questions. There was a time--even\r\nin our own memory--when such a question as the strike at Hull would have\r\nbeen promptly ruled out of order; and when the workmen who rose to call\r\nattention to it would have been coughed or even hooted down; and he\r\nwould be certain to receive very rough treatment from the Tory party.\r\nThe Tory party still remains the party of the monopolists and the\r\nselfish, but it has learned that household suffrage means a considerable\r\nweapon in the hands of working men, and, accordingly, though it may put\r\nits tongue in its cheek, it keeps that tongue very civil whenever it\r\nbegins to utter opinion. To Mr. Wilson, then, the Tories, as well as the\r\nLiberals, listened with respectful and rapt attention as he made his\r\ncomplaint of employment of the military and naval forces of the Crown\r\nin--as he alleged--the buttressing of the case of the employers. And yet\r\nthere was a something lacking. Mr. Asquith was able to show that he had\r\ndone no more than he was compelled to do by the obligations of his\r\noffice; and entirely repudiated any idea of allowing the forces of the\r\nEmpire to be ranged on the one side or the other. Mr. Mundella was able\r\nto make a good defence of his officials against the charge which had\r\nbeen brought by Mr. Wilson. There was a good speech from John Burns, and\r\nit looked as if not another sympathetic word was going to be said for\r\nthose starving men and women, who are making so heroic a fight for the\r\nright to live. Altogether, the situation was awkward and even\r\ndistressing. The House, divided between the desire to remain neutral and\r\nto be sympathetic, was puzzled, constrained, and silent. It was at this\r\nmoment that Mr. Lockwood made a most welcome and appropriate\r\nintervention. Gathering together the scattered and somewhat tangled\r\nthreads of the debate, he put to Mr. Mundella several pertinent\r\nquestions--among others, the very relevant one, whether or not the\r\nShipping Federation had the right to employ sailors, whether they are\r\nnot violating the law against \"crimping\" in so doing. Incidentally, Mr.\r\nLockwood remarked, amid cheers from the Radical Benches--delighted at\r\nthis opportunity of departing from its painful and embarrassed\r\nsilence--that Liberal members had been returned to support the cause of\r\nlabour, and that they ought to be true to their pledges. Mr. Gladstone\r\nat once grasped the situation with that unerring instinct which he has\r\ndisplayed so splendidly in the present Session, and at once undertook\r\nthat the point raised by Mr. Lockwood should be considered; and so, with\r\na word of sympathy and hope to the strikers, Mr. Gladstone rescued the\r\nHouse and himself from a painful situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL IN COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first fence.]\r\n\r\nYes, there was something intoxicating to an Irish Nationalist--after all\r\nhis weary years of waiting--in seeing the House of Commons engaged in\r\nCommittee on the Bill which is to restore the freedom of Ireland. And as\r\nI looked across the House on May 8th, with every seat occupied--with\r\ngalleries crowded--with that air of tense excitement which betokens the\r\nsolemn and portentous occasion--there rose to my brain something of the\r\nexaltation of passion's first hour. The Unionists might rage--the Tories\r\nmight obstruct--faction might bellow its throat hoarse--Orangemen swear\r\nthat they would die rather than see Home Rule--for all that, nobody\r\ncould get over this great fact, of which I saw the palpable evidence at\r\nthat solemn and historic hour.\r\n\r\nBut if for a few brief moments one was inclined to abandon oneself to\r\nthe intoxication of this great hour, there was plenty to bring one very\r\nquickly back to solid earth, and to the sense of the long, dreary, and\r\nthorny road which Home Rule has yet to traverse.\r\n\r\nTime after time Mr. Chamberlain gets up to continue the obstructive\r\ndebate. Gravelled for matter, he clutches any topic as a means of\r\nlengthening the thin chain of his discourse. Mr. Redmond--the Parnellite\r\nleader--happens to be for a few moments out of the House. Here at once,\r\nand with eager welcome, Mr. Chamberlain seizes upon this fact to string\r\na few sentences together--something after this fashion:--\"I observe that\r\nthe hon. and learned member for Waterford is not in his place. This is\r\nvery remarkable. Indeed, I may go further and say that this is a most\r\nsinister fact. For we all know what the hon. and learned gentleman has\r\nsaid with regard to the kind of Parliamentary supremacy which alone he\r\nwill accept. Well, now we are discussing this very point of the Imperial\r\nsupremacy, and the hon. and learned gentleman is not in his place. I\r\nrepeat, Mr. Mellor, it is a very remarkable, a very significant, a very\r\nsinister, and instructive fact!\" And so on and so on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stony silence of the Irishry.]\r\n\r\nThis kind of speech had another object--it was to provoke Mr. Redmond\r\ninto a speech. For it was all the same to the Obstructives who\r\nspoke--provided only there was a speech. For, first, the speech of the\r\nIrish or the Liberal member consumed so much time in itself--and then\r\none speech justified another; and thus the speech by the Irishman, or\r\nthe Liberal, would give an excellent excuse for another series of\r\nharangues by the Obstructives. And this brings me to describe one of the\r\nportents of the present House of Commons which has excited a great deal\r\nof attention and a great deal of unfeigned admiration. As speakers of\r\neloquence--as Obstructives--as Parliamentarians of exhaustless\r\nresources--as gladiators, tireless, brave, and cool--and, again, as\r\nstormy Parliamentary petrels--fierce, disorderly, passionate--the Irish\r\nmembers have been known to the House of Commons and to all the world\r\nduring all the long series of years through which they have been\r\nfighting out this struggle. In this Parliament, and at this great hour,\r\nthey appear in quite another, and perfectly new character. Amid all the\r\ngroups of this House they stand out for their unbroken and unbreakable\r\nsilence, for their unshakable self-control. Taunts, insults, gentle and\r\nseductive invitations, are addressed to them--from the front, from\r\nbehind, from their side; they never open their lips--the silent, stony,\r\nand eternal silence of the Sphinx is not more inflexible. And similarly\r\nmen rage, some almost seem to threaten each other with physical\r\nviolence; _they_ sit still--silent, watchful, composed. Not all, of\r\ncourse. There are the young, and the vehement, and the undisciplined;\r\nbut that Old Guard which was created by Parnell--which went with him\r\nthrough coercion, and the wildest of modern agitations--which contains\r\nmen that have lived for years under the shadow of the living death of\r\npenal servitude--men who have passed the long hours of the day--the\r\nlonger hours of the night--in the cheerless, maddening, spectral silence\r\nof the whitewashed cells--the Old Parliamentary Guard is silent.\r\n\r\nI have been in the House of Commons for upwards of thirteen years; and\r\nin the course of that stormy time have, of course, seen many scenes of\r\npassion, anger, and tumult; but the scene which ensued on May 8th, after\r\nMr. Morley's motion, was the worst thing I have ever beheld. I am a\r\nlover of the British House of Commons--with all its faults, and\r\ndrawbacks, and weaknesses, it is to me the most august assembly in the\r\nworld, with the greatest history, the finest traditions, the best\r\noratory. And, verily, I could have wept as I saw the House that night.\r\nIt was not that the passion was greater than I have ever seen, or the\r\nnoise even, or the dramatic excitement, it was that for hours, there was\r\nnothing but sheer downright chaos, drivel, and anarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The unloosing of anarchy.]\r\n\r\nIt began when Mr. Mellor accepted the motion for closure. At once there\r\narose from the Tory Benches wild, angry, insulting cries of \"Shame!\r\nshame! scandalous! the gag! the gag!\" This would have been all right if\r\nit had been addressed to Mr. Gladstone. Party leaders have to give and\r\ntake, and in moments of excitement they must not complain if their\r\npolitical opponents denounce them. But closure is the act of the\r\npresiding officer of the House, and it has been an almost unbroken rule\r\nand tradition of Parliament that the presiding officer shall be\r\nsafeguarded against even an approach to attack or insult. It is a\r\ntradition that has its weak side; but, on the whole, it is in accordance\r\nwith that great national English characteristic of subordination to\r\nnecessary authority and the maintenance of order, decency, and\r\nself-control as the trinity of public virtues and personal demeanour. If\r\nMr. Peel had been in the chair he would have called those Tories to\r\norder; and if they had persisted as they did, he would have promptly\r\nnamed the highest among them. Mr. Chamberlain was not ashamed to join in\r\nthose hoarse and disorderly shouts; and it was in this temper that the\r\ndifferent sides walked slowly, silently, and frowningly to the division\r\nlobbies.\r\n\r\nThe moment the division was over, the storm which had been stilled broke\r\nforth again, and with wilder fury. Lord Randolph Churchill, as I have\r\nseveral times remarked, is not the man he was. I remember the time when\r\nin such a scene he would have been perfectly at home; self-restrained,\r\nvigilant, and effective. But on this night it was nothing above mere\r\ninarticulateness--hoarse and ineffective fury--an almost painful\r\nexhibition. Sometimes his lisp became so strong that he was scarcely\r\nable to utter the words he desired to bring out. The Prime Minister\r\nbecame \"The Primisther,\" the Chief Secretary the \"Cheesesecry,\" and all\r\nthis impotence was made the more manifest by thundering on the box with\r\nhis open hand--in short, it was all inarticulate, painful, perplexing\r\nemptiness, weakened and not fortified by prolific tub-thumping. A\r\npoor--sad--nay, a tragic business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The young man and the old.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the young man; and then came the old. To all this inarticulate,\r\nhoarse, stammering passion, Mr. Gladstone opposed a speech gentle,\r\npersuasive, self-possessed; as admirable in its courtesy as in its\r\nreserve of gigantic strength. With the deadly pallor of his face more\r\nremarkable than ever--the white hair shining out, as it were, with the\r\npeaceful suggestion of calm and strong old age--in a voice, low, soft,\r\ngentle--Mr. Gladstone uttered a few words which revealed all the great\r\ndepths. In completely quiet, almost inaudible tones, he uttered these\r\npregnant words: \"As to other passages in the noble lord's speech, I do\r\nnot know whether he intended to intimidate me; but if he did, I do not\r\nthink he will succeed.\" There they are--these few words--so simple,\r\nplain, even commonplace; but what a history--what a character--what a\r\ngrandeur there is behind and beneath them! So splendid are they that\r\neven Lord Randolph is touched to the quick, and he rises to explain. The\r\nOld Man--suave, calm, unutterably courteous--hears him politely; and\r\nthen puts the whole case of the Government in a few, dignified, and\r\ntranquil words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the depths.]\r\n\r\nBut the House, exalted to a higher plane of feeling by this great little\r\nspeech, was soon dragged down again to the arena of chaos let loose;\r\nand, of course, Mr. Chamberlain was the person to lead the way to the\r\ndusty pit. Mr. Mellor had very properly attempted to stop the disorderly\r\ndiscussion of the closure; but Mr. Chamberlain was not in the mood to\r\nrespect the authority of the chair or the traditions of the House of\r\nCommons, and audaciously, shamelessly--with a perky self-satisfaction\r\npainful to witness--he proceeded to violate the ruling of the chair--to\r\ntrample on the order of Parliament, and to flout the Chairman. And then\r\nthe waters of the great deep were loosed. A hurricane of shouts, yells,\r\nprotests arose. Member got up after member--here, there,\r\neverywhere--always excepting the sternly silent Irish Bench, where sate\r\nthe Irish leaders. A half-dozen men were on their feet--all shouting,\r\ngesticulating, speaking at the same time. In short, it was utterly\r\nunlike anything ever seen before in the House of Commons; it brought\r\nvividly back to the mind the tumultuous French Convention in the days of\r\nthe French Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deeper and deeper still.]\r\n\r\nIt was almost a welcome break in this passionate and scarcely civilized\r\ndin that a personal encounter between Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Byles for\r\na moment interrupted the tempest. Mr. Chamberlain, in his\r\ncharacteristically genial way, had spoken of the Irish members as having\r\nbeen \"squared.\" The Irish members, habituated to insult--conscious of\r\nMr. Chamberlain's object--had allowed the observation to pass unnoticed;\r\nbut Mr. Byles--ardent, sincere, an enthusiast on the Irish\r\nquestion--shouted out, \"How much would it take to square you?\" At once\r\nthere rose a fierce tropical storm. There were loud shouts of\r\napproval--equally loud shouts demanding an instant withdrawal; members\r\nrose from every part of the House; in short, it was Bedlam let loose,\r\nand a scene impossible to describe.\r\n\r\nThis was deep enough, but there was a lower depth still to be sounded;\r\nand again it was Mr. Chamberlain's plummet that descended down to the\r\nunfathomable bottom. \"I do not,\" he said to Mr. Byles, \"object to the\r\nquestion, and I will answer it by saying that it would take a great deal\r\nmore than the hon. member for Shipley will ever be able to pay.\" There\r\nthe words stand--in the immensity of their vulgarity, in their\r\nunsurpassable degradation, let them lie.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first fence.]\r\n\r\nFinally, May 10th saw the first fence taken. The genial and gentle T.W.\r\nRussell proposed the removal from the Bill of the Second Chamber--the\r\nChamber specially created for the protection of the loyal minority. With\r\nsimilar and strange unscrupulousness, the Tories all trooped into the\r\nlobby against their own principles. They were accompanied by a few\r\nfoolish Radicals--indeed, it was the hope of detaching a sufficient\r\nnumber of Radicals to place the Government in a minority which produced\r\nthe Tory apostasy from their own principles. There was a little\r\nuncertainty as to the result, and everybody expected that the Government\r\nmajority would have been reduced to a dangerously low figure. When Mr.\r\nMarjoribanks read out a majority of 51--or a majority bigger than the\r\nusual one--there was a loud halloo of triumph and delighted surprise\r\nfrom the Liberal and the Irish Benches; and so the first big fence in\r\nthe Home Rule Bill was easily taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obstructive Chamberlain.]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the sitting on the following day the House of Commons\r\nstood face to face with the first clause. Under ordinary circumstances,\r\nthe clause would have been passed after a few speeches--especially and\r\ndefinitely directed to the words of the clause; Mr. Chamberlain demanded\r\nthe right on this clause to discuss, not only the whole Bill with all\r\nits other clauses, but the past and future of the whole Home Rule\r\nstruggle. He quoted passage after passage from speeches delivered by\r\nIrish members years and years ago; in short, he entered upon a survey of\r\nthe whole controversy. There were countless interruptions from the Irish\r\nBenches--not in the least because the Irish members cared for Joe's\r\nattacks, but because such a roundabout discussion was altogether a\r\nrevolutionary departure from all previous precedents; and would have\r\nbeen held distinctly out of order by any of the predecessors of Mr.\r\nMellor in the chair. That good-natured and easy-going official, however,\r\ngave Mr. Chamberlain his head; and so, for an hour, he poured forth a\r\nstream of clever, biting, but mean and irrelevant vituperation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The G.O.M.'s greatest speech.]\r\n\r\nIt was well that it should have been so; for to this speech the House of\r\nCommons owes one of the most remarkable and historic scenes in its long\r\nhistory. Every reader of Parliamentary reports knows what it means to\r\nspeak at eight o'clock. By that time, three out of five at least of the\r\nmembers of the House have gone to their dinners in all quarters of\r\nLondon, and the assembly is given up to the faddists and the bores, who\r\nnever get another opportunity of delivering themselves. Nothing,\r\ntherefore, could have been more unexpected than a speech from Mr.\r\nGladstone at such an hour, and especially a speech which, in the opinion\r\nof many, leaves far behind anything he ever did. But, indeed, it is\r\nprobable that Mr. Gladstone himself had no notion when the sitting\r\nbegan, or even a few minutes before he rose, that he would say anything\r\nvery special. It is one of the peculiarities of this extraordinary man\r\nto be always surprising you. His infinite variety, his boundless\r\nresource, seem to be without any limitations. By this time, you would\r\nhave expected that one who had listened to him for nearly twenty years\r\nwould imagine that he had no further oratorical worlds to conquer, and\r\nthat he certainly would not have waited to his eighty-fourth year to do\r\nsomething better than ever he had done before. But so it was. In\r\npassion, in destructive sarcasm, in dramatic force, in the rush and\r\nresistless sweep of language, Mr. Gladstone was more potent in the\r\ndinner hour of that Thursday night than he was ever at any other single\r\nmoment in his almost sixty years of triumphant oratory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His powers as a mimic.]\r\n\r\nObservers are divided as to his temper when he rose. Some onlookers,\r\nobserving the tremendous force of voice and language--the broad, ample,\r\nand frequent gestures--the tremulousness that sometimes underlies the\r\nswell of passion--the deadly and startling pallor of the face--thought\r\nthat he was suffering from excitement almost touching and perhaps\r\naffrighting to behold; while others thought that the chief and most\r\nimpressive feature of this perfect tornado of triumphant eloquence, was\r\nthe perfect calm that lay in the heart and bosom of all that storm.\r\nThere are two things which will tell you of the omnipotence of an\r\norator--one is the effect of his speech on foes as well as friends, and\r\nthe other is its effect upon himself. Both these evidences were present,\r\nfor the Tories seemed to have been swept away by the cyclone as\r\nresistlessly as the Liberals and the Irish, and the Tory pæans in honour\r\nof the Old Man which were to be found in the Tory organs next day only\r\nechoed the bounteous and generous recognition of his matchless powers\r\nwhich one heard from Tories in the lobbies throughout the evening. And\r\nas to the effect of the speech on Mr. Gladstone himself, it was to bring\r\nout a dramatic and mimetic power on which he very rarely ventures, and\r\nwhich in anybody but a perfect master of the House of Commons might\r\ndescend into bad taste and bad tact. I know that Mr. Gladstone is really\r\ntriumphant when he brings these qualities into requisition. I remember\r\nthe last time he used them with any approach to the abundance of this\r\noccasion was when he was making the great speech which preceded his\r\ndefeat in 1885 and the fall of his Government. On that occasion I\r\nremember very well that the Old Man puckered up his forehead into a\r\nthousand wrinkles, turned and twisted that very wonderfully mobile mouth\r\nof his--with its lips so full with strength and at the same time so\r\nsensitive with all the Celtic passion of his Highland ancestry--until\r\nsometimes you almost thought it a pity he had not taken to the Lyceum\r\nand some of the great parts in which Mr. Henry Irving has made his fame.\r\nThere was another occasion which dwells in my memory. It was on one of\r\nthe nights of the debate on the Coercion Bill. He was describing the\r\npromises of equal laws to Ireland, with the restrictions on Irish\r\nliberty which were contained in the Bill, and as he described\r\nrestriction he gradually raised the fingers on one hand, then turned\r\nthem spiral fashion until he had pointed the index finger to the roof---\r\nas though he were describing the ascent of a funambulist to the top of\r\nspiral stairs. It was at once eloquent and grotesque, and the House\r\ncheered and cheered yet again without any distinction of party--the\r\nfriends in admiration of the splendid eloquence of the gesture, the foes\r\nin hearty admiration of the great and perennial spirit of the great Old\r\nMan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comedy.]\r\n\r\nBut on May 11th there was a new and a bolder departure. Most of my\r\nreaders have seen that remarkable little lay written by Mr. Gilbert for\r\nMiss Anderson to display the range and variety of her powers--\"Comedy\r\nand Tragedy.\" Mr. Gladstone gave proof of powers of equally wide\r\nversatility; and all at the expense of poor Joe. First for the Comedy. I\r\nmust quote the passage of the speech to explain what I mean:--\r\n\r\n\"My right hon. friend has a bundle of quotations. He says he has\r\nfortified himself. (Laughter.) He said he had fortified himself against\r\nme when I said there could be no supremacy without the presence of Irish\r\nmembers in this House. I never asserted anything of the kind. (Cheers.)\r\n'Oh,' he said, 'I have got the papers'--(laughter)--and the party\r\nopposite cheered at the expected triumph. (Laughter.)\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone came to the words. \"'Oh,' he said, 'I have got the\r\npapers,'\" Mr. Gladstone began fumbling in his pockets, just as Mr.\r\nChamberlain had done--with that air of distraction and coming despair\r\nwhich appears on everybody's face when he is anxiously seeking for an\r\nimportant but mislaid paper; and the resemblance, heightened by just the\r\nleast imitation of Mr. Chamberlain's voice, was so striking, so\r\nstartling, so melodramatic, that the whole House, Tories and all, joined\r\nin the wild delight of laughter and cheers--laughter at the comic power,\r\ndelight at the splendid courage and exuberant spirit of the prancing old\r\nwar-horse, delighted, exhilarated, and fortified by the joy of battle\r\nand by the richness of his own powers and courage. Even yet the comic\r\nvein was not exhausted. Mr. Chamberlain--as I have said--had made\r\ncopious quotations from past Irish speeches, and asked that they should\r\nbe retracted. \"If the work of retraction were to begin, is my right hon.\r\nfriend,\" asked Mr. Gladstone, with scorn in every tone, \"willing to\r\nsubmit himself to the same process of examination? If the work of\r\nretraction were to begin he would have a lot to do.\" And then came the\r\npassage which has already passed into Parliamentary history. \"If we are\r\nto stand in white sheets, my right hon. friend would have to wear that\r\nornamental garment standing in a very conspicuous position.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Tragedy.]\r\n\r\nAnd then came the other and the tragic note. Again I have to quote the\r\nexact words to convey the impression and explain the description:--\r\n\r\n\"If I were in the position of one of those gentlemen--if I had seen the\r\nwrongs and the sufferings of Ireland in former times, if the iron had\r\nentered into my soul as it had entered into theirs, it would have been\r\nimpossible. I should not have been more temperate possibly than some of\r\nthem under those circumstances of the language I used. (Cheers.)\"\r\n\r\nIt was when he uttered the words, \"if the iron had entered into my\r\nsoul,\" that Mr. Gladstone ventured on the bold gesture of striking his\r\nhand against his breast--a simple gesture, and not an uncommon gesture\r\nin itself--but you should have heard the resonant and thrilling\r\nvoice--you should have been under the entrancing and almost bewildering\r\nspell beneath which at this moment all the imagination and emotion of\r\nthe House lay supine, helpless, and drugged--to have understood the\r\nshiver of feeling which passed through everybody. And so he went\r\non--rising higher and higher--a deeper harmony in every note--a more\r\nsplendid strength in every sentence--till you almost thought you were\r\nlooking at some great bird--with the strength and splendour of the\r\neagle, the full-hearted and passionate melody of the lark--as it soared\r\non, on its even and well-poised wing, higher and higher to the dim and\r\nblue ether of the upper air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A strange scene.]\r\n\r\nRight to the last word, there was the same unbroken, passionate strength\r\nand fervour, so that when it was all ended the House gave a start as\r\nthough it had to rouse itself from some splendid vision. And then came\r\nthat rude and quick awakening which, in the world of actualities, always\r\nbursts in upon the most solemn and moving hours. At about half-past\r\neight every evening the Speaker or Chairman--whichever is in the\r\nchair--gets up and goes out to tea. Before doing so the presiding\r\nofficer calls upon the next speaker, and when the speaker has been\r\nnamed, cries \"Order, order!\" and promptly disappears into the room where\r\nhis meal is laid. Scarcely had Mr. Gladstone sat down when Mr. Mellor\r\ncalled upon Sir Richard Temple, then cried \"Order, order!\" and, almost\r\nwithin a couple of seconds after Mr. Gladstone had concluded, had\r\nvanished from the House. This was immediately followed by the stampede\r\nof the rest of the House--for by half-past eight everybody was famished\r\nwith hunger--and the Chamber was left empty, silent, and dim, with a\r\nsuddenness that was startling, disconcerting, and a little\r\ndisillusioning. And then it was that the strongest proof was given of\r\nthe effect of the speech.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The outburst.]\r\n\r\nThe House, I say, became empty--but not altogether. The Irish Benches,\r\nwhich had become crowded as the great apology for Ireland was being\r\npronounced, remained still full--full, but silent. There was something\r\nstrange, weird, startling in those benches, full and yet silent, amid\r\nall this emptiness and almost audible stillness; and some of the Liberal\r\nmembers, who had left the House in the mad rush to dinner, quietly stole\r\nback to see what was going to happen. The explanation of the mystery\r\nsoon came. After he sat down, ghastly pale, almost painfully panting\r\nafter this tremendous effort, Mr. Gladstone tarried a little to recover\r\nhimself--to say a few words to Mr. John Morley--to scribble a note. At\r\nlast he rose, and then came the moment for which those silent Irish\r\nBenches had been waiting. With one accord, with one quick and\r\nsimultaneous spring, the Irish members were on their feet--hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs were waved; there was the suggestion of tears under the\r\nswelling cheers. Nor were the Irish left alone. The Liberals who had\r\nslipped back joined in. The effectiveness of their cheers was heightened\r\nby the fact that they were not in their places, but standing on the\r\nfloor. From out their cheering ranks stood the splendid figure--the\r\nbroad shoulders, the massive head, the shaggy beard and hair, all the\r\nvirility and sensitiveness that are found in the splendid form of Mr.\r\nAllen--manufacturer and workman, poet and Radical. The Old Man,\r\nsplendidly composed, and yet profoundly moved, looked back, gave a\r\ncourtly bow, and then went out. And here it was that a little scene took\r\nplace of which the public prints have hitherto contained no mention. In\r\nher corner place in the gallery had sat throughout this dazzling speech\r\nthat best of friends and truest of wives, who has been the guardian\r\nangel of Mr. Gladstone's life; and with outstretched hands and dim eyes,\r\nshe received her triumphant husband in the corridor, where she had been\r\nwaiting for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deeper and deeper.]\r\n\r\nFriday, May 12th, I may dismiss in a few words. As the closure had been\r\nrefused on Thursday night, the Obstructives started again on the first\r\nclause on Friday afternoon--Mr. T.W. Russell leading the van. He had\r\nnothing to say beyond what he had said a hundred times already, even in\r\nthe course of the present Session; and his speech would have passed\r\nunnoticed had it not been for a brisk but odious and ignoble little\r\nstorm which he and the Tories managed to raise between them. Mr. Russell\r\ndeclared that he heard the phrase across the floor, \"What the devil are\r\nyou saying?\" and stopped as if the heavens and the earth must refuse to\r\ngo round on their axes because of this introduction into Parliament of\r\nthe negligences of private conversation. Mr. Gibbs--a very pestilent and\r\nvery empty member of the young army of silly obstructives--moved that\r\nthe words be taken down--an ancient formula not heard of for years till\r\nthe present Session, when everything is turned to account for the\r\npurpose of occupying time and breaking down the House of Commons, and at\r\nthe same time accused Mr. Swift McNeill of having used the words. Mr.\r\nMcNeill indignantly denied the charge: then Mr. Macartney attributed\r\nthem to Mr. Sexton--another and equally indignant denial; and then much\r\nuproar and contradictions and apologies--the lubberly and unmannerly\r\ninterventions of Lord Cranborne as usual conspicuous--and, finally, the\r\nend of the storm in a teacup. Positively loathsome--the whole business\r\nmethods of the Tories to grasp at everything to rouse a storm or provoke\r\na scene; and altogether disheartening to those who don't wish to see the\r\nHouse of Commons reduced to the drivel and turbulence and anarchy of a\r\nFrench Convention. Finally, a little after six o'clock, the first clause\r\nof the Bill had passed, with a majority of 42. The House of Commons had\r\ndecided that there shall be established in Ireland a Legislature of two\r\nChambers. Then in a graceful, well-delivered, and pleasant little\r\nspeech, Mr. Victor Cavendish opened the fight on the second clause. The\r\nevening was devoted to the Anti-vaccinationists--answered triumphantly\r\nin an admirable and unanswerable little speech by Sir Walter\r\nFoster--with as many as seventy men voting against vaccination. I had no\r\nidea previously that the proportion of lunatics in the Assembly was so\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nRENEWAL OF THE FIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A fresh start.]\r\n\r\nNothing of memorable importance occurred during the week before the\r\nWhitsuntide holidays, but with Tuesday, May 30th, came the renewal of\r\nthe great battle over Home Rule. The Old Man was first to be observed.\r\nHe looked very fresh and sunny, but, at the same time, had that slightly\r\ndeepened pallor which he always has on the first day of a Session--the\r\nresult of the long day's journey which he has gone through in coming\r\nfrom his country house. Mr. Balfour was also in his place, looking as\r\nthough the open rivalry of Lord Randolph Churchill had not much affected\r\nhis spirits. Mr. Chamberlain nearly always looks the same. He has\r\nhimself informed the world that he does not take exercise in any shape\r\nor form whatsoever, and there is never therefore, on his cheek that look\r\nof deep-drunk sunshine which marks the cheeks of more active men. But he\r\nwas ready for the conflict, and as the night went on showed there was no\r\ndecrease in either the venom or the vehemence with which he means to\r\nfight against the Home Rule Bill. On the Irish Benches nearly every man\r\nwas in his place, and the Tories had so far benefited by their\r\nbuffetings from the _Times_ as to make a braver show than they usually\r\ndo in the early days after vacation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Home Rule once more.]\r\n\r\nWhen the House separated, the subject under debate was an audacious\r\nproposal to postpone Clause 3. There was nothing whatever to be urged in\r\nfavour of such a proposal; it was pure, unadulterated, shameless\r\nobstruction. But Sir Richard Temple is not gifted with a sense of\r\nhumour, and on this amendment he wandered and maundered away for the\r\nbetter part of an hour. The House has yet no power to prevent a bore\r\nfrom consuming its time; but it is free to save itself from the yoke of\r\nattention. By a sort of general spontaneity, everybody left his seat;\r\nand though hapless Mr. Balfour was forced by the hard necessities of his\r\nofficial position to remain in his place, nobody else was compelled to\r\ndo so; and Sir Richard addressed the general, void, encasing air. There\r\nwas some more speech-making of the like kind--still to empty air--when\r\nsuddenly and almost unexpectedly the debate was allowed to collapse. At\r\nfirst, this was unintelligible--for, senseless as was the amendment, it\r\nwas no worse than scores of others which the Tories have made the\r\npretext for endless debates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A tight division.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the division revealed the secret. It is one of the\r\npeculiarities of this strangely interesting Session that nearly every\r\ndivision is a picturesque and portentous event. With a majority so small\r\nas forty, the turnover of a very few votes from one side to the other\r\nmay mean the defeat of Home Rule, the downfall of Gladstone and his\r\nGovernment, and chaos come again. And these accidents are always\r\npossible. Death knocks at the door of the families of members of\r\nParliament as of other people; and often, when one of the great\r\ndivisions is pending, the Whips have to consider the grim and painful\r\nquestion whether they can allow a man to remain by the rack on which a\r\nwife lies tortured, or receive a loving mother's parting sigh. For some\r\nreason or other, Tuesday was a bad day for the Liberals, and there was a\r\nseries of ugly and annoying little mishaps. Thus, in the first division,\r\nwhich was snatched quickly by the Tories, informed by their scouts of\r\nwhat was going on, the majority sank to thirty-three. This was a bad\r\nbeginning, but worse, as will be seen, remained behind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Wolmer.]\r\n\r\nThe Committee was now on Clause 3. This is the clause which contains the\r\nlist of the subjects on which the Irish Legislature is not to have the\r\nright to legislate--such questions as the succession to the Crown,\r\nquestions of peace and war, foreign treaties, coinage, copyright, trade,\r\netc. The list is comprehensive enough, but it was not comprehensive\r\nenough for Lord Wolmer; for he had an amendment to the effect that the\r\nIrish Legislature should not be allowed to pass even resolutions on\r\nthese subjects. But even his own amendment did not satisfy him. He\r\namended the amendment by further proposing that the Irish Legislature\r\nshould not be allowed even to \"discuss\" any of these questions. The\r\nspeech in favour of these proposals started from the point of departure\r\ncommon to all the Unionists, namely, that the Irish people were\r\nhereditary and irreconcilable enemies, and that the moment they had a\r\nnative Legislature, it would immediately proceed to make alliances with\r\nevery Power in the world which was hostile to the British Empire. There\r\nwas France; of course, the Irish Legislature would pass a resolution of\r\nsympathy with France in case there was a war between France and England.\r\nThen there was the United States; what was there to prevent the Irish\r\nExecutive from sending an envoy to the United States? And so on, through\r\nall the possibilities and all the insanity and malignity of which an\r\nIrish Legislature could be held capable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sweet and low.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone on one or two points was able to overthrow the whole case\r\nso elaborately made up. The Irish Parliament could not send\r\nrepresentatives to a foreign Power, because they could not vote the\r\nmoney for such a purpose under the Bill. \"Ah, but\"--interrupted the\r\nincautious Wolmer--\"could they not send envoys who were unpaid?\" \"No,\"\r\npromptly responded the Old Man, \"because they had no power under the\r\nBill to 'accredit' envoys, and a foreign Power could not receive an\r\nenvoy who was not accredited.\" All this argument--broad, acute,\r\ntranquil--was delivered in a voice that now and then was painfully low,\r\nand sometimes you had to strain your ears. But then it was worth your\r\nwhile to strain your ears, so that you might master all the supremacy of\r\nthe art and skill and knowledge of the whole speech.\r\n\r\nFor instance, he puts the question to Lord Wolmer, if he seriously means\r\nthat the Irish Legislature is not to have the right to petition? Lord\r\nWolmer answers that the Irish members will be in the Imperial\r\nParliament. \"Ah! that's an argument, not an answer,\" says the Old Man;\r\nand then, with the spring of a tiger, he pounces on the hapless Wolmer\r\nwith the question: \"Is the right of petition, then, to be taken away in\r\nevery case where there is representation?\"--a question which, with\r\npetitions pouring in by the thousand to the House of Commons from the\r\nUlstermen and others, a Unionist like Lord Wolmer finds it impossible to\r\nanswer. And it is in connection with this point a little scene occurs\r\nwhich brings out many of the points in this remarkable speech, which I\r\nhave been trying to make clear. Mr. Bryce disappears from the House;\r\nthen he returns: Mr. Gladstone asks him a question; the answer is\r\napparently not satisfactory, for the Old Man lifts his hands to heaven\r\nin playful exaggeration of surprise. The House, puzzled, does not know\r\nwhat it means; but the Old Man soon explains. He had sent Mr. Bryce to\r\nthe Library to get a copy of the recent Life of Lord Sherbrooke--Robert\r\nLowe, that was--and Mr. Bryce had brought back the discomforting\r\nintelligence that the book was not there. However, with such a memory as\r\nMr. Gladstone's, this does not matter, for he is able to point out that\r\nan Australian Legislature had at one time passed a resolution, and\r\nagreed on a petition to the Imperial Parliament, in reference to the\r\nCorn Laws. Just fancy the keenness, the omnivorousness, the promptitude\r\nof that marvellous Old Man, who had read one of the most recently\r\npublished works, and had promptly seized on a point bearing reference to\r\na detail in his Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A pathetic scene.]\r\n\r\nAnd then came the pathetic scene, in which again Mr. Bryce figured, and\r\nwhich once more brought out the marvellous grasp, the tenacious and\r\ninevitable memory of the splendid Old Man. The amendment of Lord Wolmer\r\nwas, declared Mr. Gladstone, against \"the law of Parliament,\" and, by\r\nway of emphasizing this point, he wanted to have a quotation made from\r\nSir Erskine May's Book on Parliament. But the eyesight of age is weak,\r\nand there is in the House of Commons, until the gas is lit, something of\r\nthe dim, religious light of a cathedral, and, accordingly, Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad to rely on the younger eyes of Mr. Bryce. The scene which followed\r\nmight be described as out of order, for there were two members standing\r\nat the same time. But the vast ascendancy of Mr. Gladstone over the\r\nassembly--the profound reverence in which all, save the meanest, bow\r\nbefore his genius, character, and age--enable him to do things not\r\npermitted to common men. In the rapt and serious face, in the attentive\r\nlook, in the fingers beating the table as word followed word in\r\nconfirmation of this view--in the curious, almost weird and unusual\r\nsight of two men standing side by side, Mr. Gladstone silent, Mr. Bryce\r\nspeaking--there was a scene, the impressiveness, poetry, and pathos of\r\nwhich will never pass from the memory of those who saw it. And the\r\nHouse--so quick, with all its passion, and fractiousness, and\r\nmeannesses, at grasping the significance of a great and solemn\r\nmoment--marked its sense of the scene by a stillness that was almost\r\naudible--a hush that spoke aloud.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And yet another.]\r\n\r\nThere was just one other incident in this marvellous little speech which\r\nmust be noted. I have remarked the ofttimes the voice of Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas so low, that it was with difficulty one could hear him. The reason\r\nis curious, and is revealed in a little gesture that has only come in\r\nrecent years, and that has a melancholy interest. Often now, when he is\r\nspeaking, Mr. Gladstone puts his hand to his right ear, as men do who\r\nare making a laborious effort to catch and concentrate sound. The cause\r\nof this is that Mr. Gladstone's hearing has become defective, and he has\r\nto adopt this little stratagem to make his own voice audible to himself.\r\nYou should see the Old Man with his hand to his ear, with the look of\r\ngentle anxiety on his face, to understand all this little gesture\r\nconveys; and how it exalts your sense of the mighty courage of this\r\ngreat Old Man, who is able to rise thus superior to all obstacles, to\r\nall foes, to all weaknesses of the flesh, all devices of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Balfour.]\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour, I have said more than once, does not display his talents\r\nbest in Opposition. In his desire to be effective, he strains a not very\r\nstrong voice until, it sounds almost like a shriek. I do not wish to be\r\nunfair to Mr. Balfour. There is, as I have often said in these columns,\r\na certain distinction in all he does. I often think he is wanting in\r\nthat consideration and reverence for the mighty old gladiator whom it is\r\nhis duty to oppose; but for all this I make allowance, as it is his duty\r\nto oppose Mr. Gladstone, and in doing that, he may sometimes appear\r\nunintentionally irreverent. But the fact is, Mr. Balfour is thin,\r\nnarrow, and does not get at the reality of things. Many people say he is\r\nvery inferior to Mr. Chamberlain; but most assuredly I do not in the\r\nleast agree with this opinion. To me the difference between the two men\r\nis the difference between a scholar and a counter-jumper--I mean a\r\ncounter-jumper of the Senate, and not of the shop. But though that is my\r\nopinion, I cannot refrain from saying that Mr. Balfour contrasts very\r\nunfavourably with Mr. Gladstone in this struggle of giants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An ugly moment.]\r\n\r\nIt was during the speech of Mr. Balfour that a little incident took\r\nplace, the full significance of which would probably not be grasped by\r\nthe non-Parliamentarian. Mr. Balfour was arguing that it was impossible\r\nto properly discuss the amendment of Lord Wolmer until the House knew\r\nwhether or not the Irish members were going to be retained in the\r\nImperial Parliament. I do not know whether it was because there was\r\nsomething provocative in the manner in which Mr. Balfour referred to\r\nthis subject, but it had the effect of rousing the once vulnerable, but\r\nnow admirably controlled temper, which has played such a part in Mr.\r\nGladstone's career. Rising with a certain deepened pallor, and with that\r\nfeverish rush in his voice which those who watch him know so well he\r\nsaid that the Ministry meant to stick by the ninth clause, and would do\r\ntheir very best to get it accepted by the House. Here was a most\r\nportentous announcement--the portentousness of which the careful\r\nobserver could see at once, by the sudden stillness which fell upon the\r\nHouse. Whenever a Minister, or even a politician of small importance who\r\nis not a Minister, makes a statement full of portentous possibilities as\r\nto the future, the House suddenly becomes still and tense, and you can\r\nhear a pin drop. It is the prompt and sometimes almost irresistible\r\nexpression of the feeling that Destiny is throwing the die, and that you\r\nhave to watch the grim and fateful result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treasury Bench looks awkward.]\r\n\r\nAnd if you looked on the Treasury Bench, you could see that the feeling\r\nwas not altogether comfortable. It was no secret that the ninth clause\r\nwas the one which offered to the Government the one perilous fence they\r\nhad still to take--that is to say, so far as their own followers were\r\nconcerned. Hitherto the attitude of the Government was quite unknown;\r\nand, indeed, it was quite probable that the Government themselves had\r\nnot finally decided what their attitude should be. But when Mr.\r\nGladstone--pale, excited, and angry--jumped in with this outburst, it\r\nseemed all at once as if the fateful and final word of Destiny had been\r\nspoken, and as if the whole fate of Ireland, of Mr. Gladstone, of this\r\ngreat Ministry, and of this mighty Bill, had been definitely pledged to\r\none throw of the dice. Imagine one of those contests which you find in\r\nthe pages of Turgenieff or Tolstoi, which perchance you may have seen at\r\nMonte Carlo, which in the last few days may have been observed at Epsom\r\nDowns--in which life or death, ruin or halcyon fortune, depended on one\r\nthrow--and you can have some sense of all that passed through the\r\nimagination of the House and that made it almost audibly shiver when Mr.\r\nGladstone made this slight and terse interruption. Mr. Morley's\r\nface--serious, often sombre--cast in a mould and reflective of a soul\r\ninclined to the darker rather than the more cheerful view of life's\r\ntangled and unsatisfactory workings--grew black and troubled; the other\r\nMinisters who were present looked--not so eloquently, but still\r\nperceptibly--uncomfortable; Mr. Asquith--who had been a close\r\nobserver--could not keep his keen anxiety from breaking through the mask\r\nof easy equanimity with which he is able to clothe his readiness to meet\r\nfortune in all her moods; in short, it was for Ministerialists one of\r\nthose uncomfortable quarters of an hour in which life seems to\r\nconcentrate all its bitterness, sorrow, and anxieties within a terribly\r\nbrief space of time. And if you wanted to know further what was the full\r\nsignificance of what had taken place, you saw it in the open and almost\r\nindecent joy of Mr. Chamberlain's face; in the more subdued but a still\r\nunctuous look of Mr. Courtney; and you could hear it in the shriller\r\npitch of Mr. Balfour's voice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A false alarm.]\r\n\r\nBut all the same, it was a false alarm. For if the Old Man had tripped,\r\nhe was able to recover himself very soon. Mr. Balfour was foolish enough\r\nto try and dot the \"I's,\" and to put into Mr. Gladstone's mouth that\r\nwhich his enemies hoped he had said. For Mr. Balfour, remarking that Mr.\r\nGladstone had made a more explicit declaration than any which had yet\r\ncome from his lips--this was all right, and was quite true--went on to\r\nthe further statement that the Old Man had now committed himself to\r\nstanding or falling by the ninth clause \"in its present shape.\" This,\r\nyou will see, was the whole crux of the situation. If Mr. Gladstone had\r\nsaid this, then, indeed, it might go hard with him by-and-bye, for\r\nwhether the Liberal party would accept the ninth clause in its present\r\nshape was one of the questions yet to be decided. The Old Man, however\r\nhis words might have been open to this construction, had not in reality\r\nsaid anything of the kind. And, at once, he was prompt to see how\r\nnecessary it was to correct this error, for he immediately rose to his\r\nfeet to say that he had never said anything of the sort. What he had\r\nsaid was that the Government intended to stand by the principle that the\r\nIrish members were to have a place in the Imperial Parliament, which, it\r\nwill be seen, leaves open the perilous and perplexing question: what\r\nform that representation in the Imperial Parliament is to take. At once\r\nthere was a heavy sigh of relief, and most of all on the Irish Benches.\r\nAmong the Irishry, the declaration of Mr. Gladstone had produced a\r\nmoment of something like panic; the only exhibition of which was a\r\ncertain impatience with the attempt of Mr. Balfour to pin the Old Man\r\ndown to the most literal interpretation of his words. The panic soon\r\npassed away. It was all, I say, a false alarm. Vulnerable though his\r\ntemper--though there was in him still enough of the hot onrush of battle\r\nand of resistance under all the snow of advancing years--the great old\r\ntactician had not forgotten his cunning. He at once seized the\r\nopportunity of saying he was not finally committed to the ninth clause\r\nin its present shape, and so we once more breathed freely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe comes back from dinner.]\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the important part of the debate before the dinner\r\nhour. It is one of the peculiarities of Mr. Chamberlain that no stress\r\nof a Parliamentary situation induces him to seriously interfere with his\r\nhabits. When the clock points to ten minutes to eight any evening of\r\nthe week, he may be seen to rise from his place with the inevitableness\r\nof fate, and to disappear for a couple of hours. I have seen him do this\r\neven when the fortune of a most important amendment seemed to lie\r\ntrembling in the balance--the one occasion on which I have known him to\r\nbreak through that rigid rule was when his son was about to make that\r\nmaiden speech which started that promising young fellow on his\r\nParliamentary career. Coming back like a giant refreshed about ten\r\no'clock, Mr. Chamberlain contrived to once more set aflame the embers of\r\ndying passion; and he threw himself into the fight over Lord Wolmer's\r\namendment at the moment when all life seemed to have gone out of it. His\r\nspeech was full of cleverness--of what the Americans call smartness, and\r\nit had all that point, personal and party, which sets your friends in a\r\nroar. The Tories cheered him vociferously, and point after point of\r\nbrilliant and effective invective pleased the House--always anxious with\r\nits jaded appetite for a sensation. But when you had time to compare, it\r\nwith that little speech delivered by Mr. Gladstone earlier in the\r\nevening--when you contrasted its fitful and gaudy brilliancy with the\r\nsober and broad wisdom of Mr. Gladstone's utterance--then, indeed, you\r\nwere able to see what a gulf there is between the smart debater and the\r\ngenuine statesman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A narrow shave.]\r\n\r\nAt last the debate was over; and then came what was, perhaps, the most\r\nexciting and most momentous incident of the evening. I have already\r\nspoken of the interest with which every division is regarded. The\r\ninterest in this particular division was fully justified when the\r\nnumbers were told; for the Government majority had fallen to twenty-one.\r\nAt once there was a wild outburst of cheering from the Tory Benches.\r\nSome wits ventured on the cry, \"Resign! Resign!\"--altogether, the Tories\r\nhad the best quarter of an hour they have enjoyed since that hideous\r\nafternoon before the Easter vacation, when, after a prolonged fight, the\r\nOld Man had to announce that he could not propose the second reading of\r\nthe Bill until after Easter. It was all more or less of an accident;\r\nthere were plenty of things to account for it--a reception at the House\r\nof a prominent Liberal lady, and many other explanations: but, all the\r\nsame, it was a very ugly little incident; and though Mr. Gladstone\r\ncarried it off with that indomitable courage of his, which doesn't know\r\nwhat a confession of defeat means, one could see that he did not like\r\nit; and for the rest of the evening there was a visible gloom in the\r\nLiberal ranks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Happy again.]\r\n\r\nBut May 31st brought the Derby, and with the Derby there came upon the\r\nTory Benches one of those moments of temptation which the natural man is\r\nutterly unable to resist. The amendments followed each other in rapid\r\nsuccession; division came on top of division; and in them all the\r\nLiberals jumped back to their old superiority of numbers. In the earlier\r\npart of the day, when the fortunes of Isinglass were still undetermined,\r\nthe majorities were enormous; and though there was a certain falling off\r\nwhen sporting gentlemen began to get back from the dusty Downs, the\r\naverage was well kept up; and it was with a distinct rise in the\r\ntemperature of Liberal hopes and confidence that this stage was reached.\r\nOn the following day the lowness of the voice in the Old Man was a\r\nlittle more perceptible, and when it got to midnight, he seemed\r\npainfully fagged and exhausted. It was, perhaps, because he was in that\r\nmood that he made some concessions to the Unionists, which have been\r\nsomewhat resented. But as these concessions, according to Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself, only carried out what the Government had intended from the\r\nfirst, these things may be passed. They had reference chiefly to\r\nprohibition of raising in Ireland anything like a military force--even\r\nin the shape of a militia or volunteer force. On June 2nd, there was one\r\nof those transformations in which the Old Man is constantly surprising\r\nfriends and foes. He was alert, vigorous, watchful of everything that\r\nwent on, and the voice rose to its old strength and resonance. It was\r\nduring that afternoon that there was a slight indication for the first\r\ntime throughout the progress of the whole Bill of any dissatisfaction on\r\nthe part of the Irish members. Mr. Byrne--one of the Unionist gang of\r\nlawyers--proposed a ridiculous amendment, the effect of which would have\r\nbeen that the Irish Legislature would not have had the right to give a\r\nlicense for a fowling-piece, or to arm their police to meet a rising of\r\nthe Orangemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton intervenes.]\r\n\r\nIt was then that Mr. Sexton intervened with a word of warning against\r\nsuch a restriction. In burning though carefully restrained language, Mr.\r\nSexton replied to a taunt of Mr. Chamberlain at the silence of the Irish\r\nmembers. Their silence, said Mr. Sexton, was due to their knowledge that\r\nMr. Chamberlain and his confederates had entered into a conspiracy to\r\ndestroy the power of the House of Commons, and to defeat the mandate of\r\nthe nation by obstructing a Bill they could not otherwise defeat. Spoken\r\nwith great fire--with splendid choice of language--with biting sarcasm,\r\nof which he is a master--the speech was an event. Mr. Gladstone promptly\r\nrecognized its spirit; thanked the Irish members for their\r\nconsideration; and then declared, amid a great sniff from Joe's upturned\r\nnose, that if the Irish members desired to express their opinions on any\r\namendment, he and his colleagues would wait before expressing their own\r\nviews. There seemed to be a slight hope among the Tories and the\r\never-venomous Joe that this meant a rift in the lute between the Irish\r\nmembers and the Government; but they were woefully\r\ndisappointed--especially when the amendment was indignantly rejected by\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Daily News.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is the outspoken, rather than the loudly uttered, that is often the\r\nimportant thing in a House of Commons discussion. This was the case with\r\nthe curious little debate which Mr. Chamberlain initiated on June 6th.\r\nThe _Daily News_ had published a little article describing the manner\r\nin which the Tories had shouted at--hooted--interrupted--Mr. Gladstone\r\non the Thursday night previous. It may at once be asked why Mr.\r\nChamberlain should have thought it necessary to notice the article. He\r\nboasted that he was not in the habit of noticing what appeared against\r\nhim in the newspapers--which is not true to a certain extent, or at\r\nleast is not generally so thought, for it is understood that no man\r\nreads more carefully the extracts sent to him by those press-cutting\r\nagencies which have added either a new luxury or a new terror to public\r\nlife. But Mr. Chamberlain's action had many roots. First, like many\r\nothers, very free in their comments and attacks, he is almost childishly\r\nsensitive. Watch him in the House of Commons when an attack is being\r\nmade upon him which he does not like, and the fierce and domineering\r\ntemper reveals itself in the fidgety movement, the darkened brow, the\r\ndeeper pallor on the white-complexioned face. When he was a Cabinet\r\nMinister he could never, or rarely, be got to remain in the House of\r\nCommons during the whole of the evening; and one of the chief reasons, I\r\nhave heard, he gave for thus absenting himself was that he could not\r\nstand the talk from the opposite side--it made him so angry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe's motives.]\r\n\r\nBut there were other and more immediate reasons for his anger with the\r\n_Daily News_. Joe was conscious of the growth of two feelings--either of\r\nwhich was very perilous to him. First, he began uneasily to feel that\r\nthe country--watching the struggle between him and the Old Man--was\r\ngetting a little disgusted at the business; and saw in it a want of that\r\nchivalry and fair play which it desires to see even in the fiercest\r\npolitical controversy. This was not a pleasant sentiment to have growing\r\nup against one; and Joe felt that it has serious perils to his future\r\npolitical position. And, secondly, he was conscious that the majority of\r\nthe House of Commons was growing very restive under the desperate\r\nobstruction of which he had made himself the champion, and that this\r\nfeeling might soon become strong enough to carry Mr. Gladstone and the\r\nMinisters off their feet, and compel drastic measures which had hitherto\r\nbeen steadily refrained from. This would not suit the book of Joe at\r\nall, whose object it was to keep the struggle going as long as he\r\npossibly could manage it, careless of the traditions of Parliament, of\r\nthe dignity and decency of the House of Commons, of the life and\r\nstrength of Mr. Gladstone, of everything except his own greedy desire\r\nfor personal revenge and triumph.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone's gentleness.]\r\n\r\nThis was what lay behind the plausible and honeyed words in which Mr.\r\nChamberlain attacked the article in the _Daily News_. And here a curious\r\ndifficulty arose which rather helped Joe, and almost enabled him to\r\nscore a great triumph. Everybody knows that between the temper of Mr.\r\nGladstone and that of his friends and supporters there is an impassable\r\ngulf. That mastery of a vulnerable temper, which accounted for many of\r\nthe troubles of his earlier political career, which he himself has\r\nacknowledged in many a pathetic passage in his correspondence--that\r\nmastery of the vulnerable temper is now so complete that the Old Man\r\nglides through scenes of insult and passes over what the humblest member\r\nof the House would often find it hard to endure. There is something\r\nindeed strange, wistful, almost uncanny, in the unbreakable gentleness\r\nof that white figure, with the ivory complexion, the scant white hair,\r\nthe large white collar and broad white shirt-front--there is something\r\nwhich becomes almost an obsession to the observer in watching the figure\r\nwith its strangely tranquil and gentle expression in the heat and centre\r\nof all this fierce Parliamentary battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And eagerness.]\r\n\r\nAnd what makes it all the more peculiar is that this strange gentleness\r\ndoes not go side by side with want of interest in the struggle. On the\r\ncontrary, all those around him and near him declare that never has Mr.\r\nGladstone been more keen of any subject than he has been on this Home\r\nRule Bill. He thinks of nothing else; he enjoys it all. I saw a curious\r\ninstance of this intensity of his interest about that time. Having a\r\nword to say to one of the Ministers, I was seated for a moment on the\r\nTreasury Bench just beside the Chairman--Mr. Mellor. Mr. Gladstone had\r\ngone out for a few minutes. Sir William Harcourt was in charge of the\r\nBill, and he was replying to some argument of the Unionists opposite.\r\nSir William Harcourt has an excellent method of dealing with futile and\r\ndishonest amendments. He declines to argue them in detail. With that\r\nrich humour of which the public know less than his friends and\r\nintimates, Sir William airily dismisses the whole business, and with a\r\nlaugh brings down shivering to the ground a whole fabric of laboriously\r\nconstructed nonsense. Well, Sir William was in the middle of a sentence\r\nin which he was speaking of the absurd suspicion of the Irish people\r\nwhich was entertained by the Tories--and Mr. Gladstone, entering from\r\nbehind the Speaker's chair at that very moment, just caught that one\r\nphrase. It was impossible for him to hear more than that one word\r\n\"suspicion\"; but at that word he pricked up his ears, and while he was\r\nstill walking to his place--before he had seated himself--\"Hear, hear,\"\r\nhe cried. His eagerness would not let him wait till he had taken his\r\nseat. His absolute absorption in the Bill before the House was so\r\ncomplete that, as he walked to his seat, you could see the rapt and\r\nconcentrated look, which showed that, even during the few minutes he had\r\nbeen away, the brain had never left for one second its absorbing theme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The consolations of old age.]\r\n\r\nBut--as I have indicated--this complete subjugation of temper which Mr.\r\nGladstone has achieved, has its disadvantages when such a conflict is\r\nprovoked as that with Mr. Chamberlain on the article in the _Daily\r\nNews_. Mr. Gladstone himself spoke of the consolations of old age; there\r\nis one consolation he did not mention. His absorption in the Bill and\r\nthe slight deafness in one of his ears do not allow him to perceive so\r\nplainly the rude noises and interruptions by which he is often assailed\r\nfrom the Tory Benches. Moreover, the native chivalry of his disposition,\r\nthe curious simplicity which has remained his central characteristic, in\r\nspite of all the experiences of the baser side of human nature which\r\nmust have been crowded into all that half a century of official and\r\nParliamentary life--that unwillingness to see anything but deplorable\r\nerror in his most rancorous, meanest, and most malignant opponent--all\r\nthese things make it difficult for him to understand the ugly realities\r\nwhose serpent heads show themselves plainly to almost every other eye\r\nbut his.\r\n\r\nThere is a dispute among the authorities as to the incidents of that\r\nThursday night--some, even among those friendly to the Prime Minister,\r\ndeclaring that there was nothing unusual in the interruptions of that\r\nnight. My own recollection is clear that there was a great deal of\r\nnoise, and that it was so bad that Mr. Chamberlain tried to explain it\r\naway, and was careful to absolve himself and his friends from all\r\nresponsibility for it. In the general body of the Liberal party there is\r\nno doubt whatsoever about that business. Liberal after Liberal came up\r\nto me afterwards, in allusion to a few remarks I felt it my duty to\r\nmake, to declare their entire agreement with the view I had put\r\nforward--that the description of the _Daily News_, though consciously\r\nand obviously written in the vein of parody, was a fair and just\r\ndescription of what had taken place. Sir Henry Roscoe is not an\r\nexcitable politician, though no man holds to the Liberal faith more\r\nfirmly. He was met on the following Sunday by a friend, and when asked\r\nhow he viewed the situation, declared that he was rather \"low!\" Why? he\r\nwas asked. Because his heart was saddened and enraged by the treatment\r\nof the splendid Old Man by Mr. Chamberlain and the Tories. To a leading\r\nLiberal Minister, two Tories privately declared that their pain and\r\nshame and disgust with the conduct of their own side to Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas so profound, that they had to get up and leave the House to control\r\ntheir feelings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A complex situation.]\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, Mr. Chamberlain came forward with his audacious\r\ncomplaint, this was the curious situation: that the bulk of the Liberal\r\nparty, and many even of their opponents, were convinced that the\r\ncomments of the _Daily News_ were more than justified. The frantic\r\ncheers with which each successive sentence of the scathing attack in the\r\ndescription was punctuated by the Liberal and Irish Benches, as Joe,\r\nwith affected horror, read them out, sufficiently indicated what they\r\nthought. And, on the other hand, the man in whose defence this reply to\r\nhis assailants was made was just as convinced that his enemies had been\r\nunjustly assailed, and that he himself had been well and courteously\r\ntreated. In such a situation it was just possible that Mr. Chamberlain\r\nwould escape from his position with flying colours; would have the\r\n_Daily News_ censured for falsehood by a House of Commons that believed\r\nin its truth; and have himself declared chivalrous by a Parliament that\r\nknows him to be malignant, unscrupulous, and merciless. To prevent such\r\na catastrophe it was a painful but necessary duty to bring out the\r\nrealities of the case; and not only a painful but also a thankless duty\r\nin face of what everybody knew would be the attitude of Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone shakes his head.]\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Gladstone did not delay long in indicating to the House what his\r\nattitude would be. When I was speaking and denouncing the rude\r\ninterruptions of the eventful Thursday night, he shook his head\r\nominously and in contradiction--though manifestations which came from\r\nLiberal and Irish Benches showed that he stood alone in his view of the\r\nevents of that night. And it was no surprise to the House, therefore,\r\nwhen he stood up and said that he entirely disclaimed any feeling of\r\nresentment for anything that had been done to him, and that he confessed\r\nhe had not perceived the interruptions to which the report of the _Daily\r\nNews_ had called attention. After this, there seemed no more to be\r\nsaid; but the battle was not yet over. The Tories had been charged both\r\nby the _Daily News_ and by a speech in the House with want of courtesy\r\nto Mr. Gladstone. Nobody knew better than Mr. Balfour how much ground\r\nthere was for such a charge; for often in the course of the present\r\nSession--with a dark frown on his face, with an almost violent\r\ngesture--he has called on his unruly followers behind him to conduct\r\nthemselves. The effect of what had taken place was to extort from Mr.\r\nBalfour a tribute to the universal respect in which the Prime Minister\r\nwas held--a tribute which the splendid Old Man acknowledged by a low\r\nbow; and, in short, the Tories had to bind themselves over to keep the\r\npeace by their professions of a chivalrous desire to respect the person\r\nand the feelings of the great Prime Minister. And thus it was that it\r\nended for the moment in a drawn battle--Mr. Chamberlain having to\r\nwithdraw his motion, and I my amendment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slow progress.]\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime the progress with the Bill was terribly slow. We\r\nwere now on the second week with the third clause. Amendments were\r\ndisposed of one night only to find that the next day the number of\r\namendments, instead of being diminished, had been increased. It would be\r\na sheer waste of time and space to go into detail about these\r\namendments. The third clause is the clause which deals with the\r\nquestions that are to be excluded from the Irish Parliament. The list is\r\nsufficiently long--peace and war--the Crown--the Lord-Lieutenancy--trade\r\nand commerce--the coinage and the currency--copyright and\r\nnavigation--treason and treason felony. But even this list was not\r\nsufficiently long for the Unionists. They propose to increase this list\r\nof exemptions until, if they succeeded, the Irish Legislature would have\r\nto shut up shop for want of business to attend to. One man gravely\r\nproposed that the Irish executive--being made responsible for the peace,\r\norder, and good Government of Ireland--should not have the right to\r\nsettle the procedure in the Irish criminal courts. Another gentleman\r\nproposed that all cases referring to criminal conspiracy should be left\r\nto the Imperial Government and Parliament. The meaning of all this was\r\nthat the Unionists wanted to draw a ring fence around the Orangemen of\r\nUlster, who had been threatening rebellion. First, by one set of\r\namendments the Irish Government was not to have a police able to put\r\nthem down, and then the Irish courts were not to be able to convict them\r\nwhen they broke the law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hours of labour.]\r\n\r\nOn June 9th the Unionists were on another line. They professed to think\r\nthat if the Irish Legislature were not compelled to do so they would not\r\nprevent overwork and long hours. This led to the proposal that all\r\nlegislation on hours of labour should be taken out of the hands of the\r\nIrish Parliament. Mr. Chamberlain argued this with his tongue in his\r\ncheek--professing to dread the unequal competition in which poor England\r\nwould be placed if wealthy Ireland were allowed to compete unfairly by\r\nlonger hours. He urged this in a speech directed to every absurd\r\nprejudice and alarm which the ignorant or the timid could\r\nfeel--altogether made a most unworthy contribution. John Burns--breezy,\r\noutspoken--not friendly to all things done by the Liberals in the past,\r\nbut firm in his Home Rule faith--went for Mr. Chamberlain in good,\r\nhonest, sledge-hammer, and workmanlike fashion. The member for Battersea\r\neven dared to blaspheme Birmingham--the Mecca of the industrial\r\nworld--for its notoriously bad record in industrial matters--an attack\r\nwhich Joe seemed in no way to relish. And all the time the Old Man--with\r\nhis hand to his ear, and sitting on the very end of the Treasury Bench,\r\nso as to be nearer the speaker--listened attentively, sympathetically,\r\noccasionally uttering that fine leonine cheer of his. It was on this\r\namendment that the Ministerial majority fell, owing to various\r\naccidents, to 30, and the Tories cheered themselves into a happy\r\ncondition of mind for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The guillotine--but not yet.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the sitting there was a certain feverishness of\r\nexpectation. Dr. McGregor, a Scotch Highland member, had announced that\r\nat half-past six he would move the closure of the third clause--on which\r\nwe had now been working for a fortnight. But Mr. Mellor refused to put\r\nsuch a drastic proposal on the suggestion of a private member. There\r\nwas, however, a very plain intimation that if a Minister were to make\r\nsuch a proposal it might be considered differently; all of which meant\r\nthat we were approaching--slowly, patiently, forbearingly--but still\r\napproaching the moment when drastic steps would be taken to accelerate\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SEXTON INCIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton.]\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Mr. Sexton, early in June, seemed to point to one of\r\nthose disastrous splits in the Irish ranks which have always come at the\r\nwrong moment to spoil the chances of the Irish cause. There were many\r\nwhose memories were brought back by the event to that trying and strange\r\ntime when Mr. Parnell fought his desperate battle for the continuance of\r\nhis leadership. But then there were many modifications of the position,\r\nand the chief of these was the much greater tranquillity with which the\r\naffair was regarded; and the general faith that the Irish members would\r\nbe wise enough to settle their differences satisfactorily. Still there\r\nwere some very ugly moments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Conservative opportunity.]\r\n\r\nNothing could be more galling, for instance, to those who had charge of\r\nthe Home Rule Bill, than to look across at the Irish Benches and see a\r\nvast and aching void in the places where the representatives of the\r\npeople mainly concerned are accustomed to sit. The Tories were not slow\r\nto utilise the moment; and if things had been different--if the Home\r\nRule cause had not got so far--they would probably have been able to\r\nstop progress with the measure altogether. But fortunately the Home Rule\r\nBill was in committee--and whether men like it or not, it is impossible\r\nfor them to avoid something like business discussion when a Bill is in\r\ncommittee. There is the clause under discussion; there are the\r\namendments to it, which stand on the paper; the clause and the\r\namendments have to be spoken to; and it is impossible, within the limits\r\nof a discussion so defined, to introduce a subject so extraneous as a\r\ndomestic difficulty in the Irish ranks. But, at the same time, the\r\nopportunity was too tempting to be altogether passed without notice. Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock has taken a prominent part at times in opposing the Home\r\nRule Bill. Sir John is a most estimable man, has written some very\r\nentertaining books, and in the City has appropriate rank as both an\r\nerudite and a rich banker. But he does not shine in the House of\r\nCommons. His voice is thin and feeble, and his arguments, somehow or\r\nother, always appear wire-drawn. And then the House of Commons is a\r\nplace, above all others, where physical qualities go largely towards\r\nmaking success or failure. A robustious voice and manner are the very\r\nfirst essentials of Parliamentary success; and no man who is not gifted\r\nwith these things has really much right to try Parliamentary life.\r\nHowever, Sir John Lubbock was not strong enough to withstand the\r\ntemptation of making capital out of Irish misfortunes; and he pointed to\r\nthe Irish Benches, with their yawning emptiness, as a proof that the\r\nIrish members took no interest whatsoever in the Home Bale Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish objections to divorce.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the House itself the Home Rule Bill was crawling slowly\r\nalong. The Unionists were at their sinister work of delaying its\r\nprogress by all kinds of absurd and irrelevant amendments. For instance,\r\none Unionist wished to restrict the Irish Legislature as to the law of\r\nmarriage and divorce. Mr. Gladstone has over and over again pointed out\r\nthat, as the Irish have one way of looking at these things, and the\r\nEnglish another, it would be absurd not to allow the Irish Legislature\r\nto settle such a matter in accordance with Irish feeling. Curiously\r\nenough, the Unionists did not receive much encouragement on this point\r\nfrom the Irish branch of the enemies of Home Rule. Mr. Macartney, an\r\nIrish Orangeman, proclaimed on the part of his co-religionists that the\r\nIrish Protestants had nearly as much objection to divorce as the Irish\r\nCatholics; and, so far as that part of the amendment was concerned, he\r\nhad no desire to see it pressed. What he apprehended was a change in the\r\nlaw for the purpose of prejudicing mixed marriages--marriages between\r\nCatholics and Protestants. Mr. Gladstone, it is well known, on the\r\nquestion of divorce is a very sound and very strong Conservative. The\r\nsturdy fight he made against divorce still lives in Parliamentary\r\nhistory, and has often been brought up--sometimes in justification of\r\nequally stubborn fights--against him. It is one of the points on which\r\nhe does not seem to have much modified his opinions, in spite of the\r\nadvance of time, and all that has taken place in the long stretch of\r\nyears between now and the day when an unbelieving and pagan minister\r\nlike Lord Palmerston enabled men and women to get rid of adulterous\r\nspouses. But Mr. Gladstone declined to be drawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disestablishment.]\r\n\r\nOn June 18th, Mr. Bartley proposed an amendment to a restriction in the\r\nBill with regard to the establishment and endowment of any church. By\r\nthe Bill--as is pretty well known--the Irish Parliament are forbidden to\r\nconfer on any church the privilege of State establishment and State\r\nendowment. To this restriction no Irish member has ever raised the least\r\nobjection. It was reserved for Mr. Bartley--one of the most vehement\r\nopponents of Irish nationality and an Irish Parliament--to declare that\r\nsuch a restriction would make the Parliament unworthy of the acceptance\r\nof a nation of freemen, and to propose that accordingly it should be\r\nremoved. The position, then, in which the Irish opponents of the Bill\r\nwere placed, was this--that while denouncing the supremacy and\r\nencroachments of the Catholic Church as one of the main objections\r\nagainst the Bill, they proposed that the Irish Parliament should have\r\nthe right to establish and endow that very Church. Mr. Balfour\r\nperceived--under the light thus borne in upon him--that this was not an\r\namendment which the Tory party could safely support; and he accordingly\r\nadvised Mr. Bartley to withdraw it. Mr. Gladstone made a few scornful\r\nobservations; and, without a division, the proposal was huddled out of\r\nsight. It was almost a pity. It would have been such an instructive\r\nspectacle to see the whole Tory party voting that the Catholic Church in\r\nIreland should have the right to be endowed and established; and some of\r\nthe Irish members felt this so much, that they were very much inclined\r\nto force the Tories to a division. But they let the incident pass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The triumph of the tweed coat.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the curious things about Parliamentary life in England,\r\nthat the smallest detail of personal habit attracts the all-searching\r\ngaze of the entire world. Let a man change the shape of his hat, the\r\ncolour of his clothes, the style even of his stockings, and the world\r\nknows it all before almost he is himself conscious of the change. And\r\nthen, though the House of Commons consists for the most part of men well\r\nadvanced in middle life--men who have made their pile in counting-house\r\nor shop, before devoting themselves to a Parliamentary career--it is\r\nalso a House where wealth and fashion are very largely represented. It\r\nis often a very well-dressed body; and in this House of Commons, in\r\nparticular, there is a very large proportion of well-tailored and\r\nwell-groomed young men--especially, of course, on the Tory side. The\r\nconsequence is, that you are able to trace the transformations of\r\nfashion, the processions of the seasons, the variety of appropriate\r\ngarbs which social and other engagements impose, as accurately in the\r\nHouse of Commons as in Rotten Row.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The old order.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary tendency of the Parliamentary man is towards the sombre\r\nblack, and the solemnity of the long-tailed frock-coat. There have been\r\ntimes when if a member of Parliament did venture to enter the House of\r\nCommons in a coat prematurely ending in the short tails of the morning\r\ncoat, or in the tail-less sack-coat, he would have been called up to the\r\nSpeaker's chair and as severely reprimanded as though he had committed\r\nthe most atrocious offence--in those far-off days--of wearing a pot-hat.\r\nBut in these democratic times one can do anything; and low-crowned hats,\r\nsack-coats, homespun Irish tweeds, affright and shock the old\r\naristocratic Parliamentary eye. When summer approaches, the whole aspect\r\nof the House changes. The sombre black is almost entirely doffed; and\r\nyou look on an assembly as different in its outward appearance from its\r\nantecedent state as the yellow-winged butterfly is from the grim grub.\r\nIndeed, members of Parliament seem to take a delight in anticipating the\r\nchange of dress which the change of season imposes. There are members of\r\nthe House of Commons who can claim to wear the very first white hat of\r\nthe season. Sir Wilfrid Lawson has a sombre creed and a Bacchanalian\r\nspirit; and, accordingly, the very first time a mere stray gleam of\r\nsunshine streaks the wintry gloom Sir Wilfrid wears an audaciously white\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone's rejuvenescence.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone is a curious mixture of splendour and carelessness. He\r\nnearly always wears a small, narrow black tie, which brings into greater\r\nrelief the Alpine heights and the measureless width of his big\r\nshirt-collars, and the broad expanse of his shirt-front. But this\r\ntie--though it marks a pleasant and becoming individuality of\r\ndress--loses half its effect by nearly always getting out of its place;\r\nwhen night is advanced, the knot is always about half across Mr.\r\nGladstone's neck. On the other hand, he is nearly always very carefully\r\ndressed; his black frock-coat--a little ancient in make, and always of\r\nthe smooth black, which has given way with younger men to the\r\ndiagonals--is a well-known feature of every great debate, and adds grace\r\nto his appearance and delivery. When summer comes, however, he bursts\r\ninto an almost dazzling glory of white waistcoats, grey cashmere coats,\r\nand hats of creamy-yellow whiteness, ethereal and almost aggressively\r\nsummery. The younger men are not slow to follow so excellent an\r\nexample--though generally there is the tendency to the dark grey, which\r\nis a compromise between the black of winter and the fiery white tweed\r\nwhich the man in the street is wont to wear. Sir Charles Russell--who,\r\nreturning from Paris on the same day as Mr. Sexton, received a very warm\r\nwelcome--is also a child of his age in his clothes. Time was when a\r\ngreat legal luminary--especially if he were on the bench--was supposed\r\nto be violating every canon of good taste if he did not wear garments\r\nwhich might be described as a cross between the garb of a bishop, an\r\nundertaker, and a hangman. The judge on the bench, in fact, was always\r\nsupposed to be putting on the black cap figuratively, and, therefore,\r\nwas obliged to bear with him the outward sign of his damnable trade. The\r\nlate Lord Cairns was the first to break through this tradition, and\r\naffect the style of the prosperous stockbroker. Sir Charles Russell is\r\ndifferent, for he dresses in thorough taste; but when one saw him in the\r\nHouse of Commons in a grey suit and a deep-cut waistcoat, one might have\r\ntaken him for a gentleman squire with a taste for study, varied by an\r\noccasional visit to Newmarket.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Morley's tweed suit.]\r\n\r\nAll these observations have been suggested by the portentous fact that\r\non June 15th Mr. John Morley startled the world of Parliament by\r\nappearing in a very neat, a very well cut, and a very light tweed suit.\r\nIf Mr. Morley figures in many Tory imaginations as a modern St. Just,\r\nlonging for the music of the guillotine and the daily splash of Tory and\r\northodox blood, it is much more due to his clothes than to his writings;\r\nfor ordinarily he is dressed after the fashion which one can well\r\nsuppose reigned in the days when the men of the Terror were inaugurating\r\na reign of universal love, brotherhood, and peace through the narrow\r\nopening between the upper and the lower knife of the guillotine. His\r\ncoat is blue: so is his waistcoat; and his nether garments are of a\r\nsevere drab brown. It is impossible to imagine that any man who assumes\r\nsuch garments could be otherwise than a severe and sanguinary\r\ndoctrinaire, anxious for his neighbours' blood. The genial smile with\r\nwhich the House of Commons has become familiar has invalidated the Tory\r\nestimate of Mr. Morley, but it was that memorable Thursday that\r\ncompleted the transformation of judgment. No man could be a lover of the\r\nguillotine who could wear so airy, so gay, and, above all, so juvenile\r\nand well-cut a suit of clothes. Mr. Morley himself was overwhelmed with\r\nthe amount of attention which his new suit attracted. He, poor man, did\r\nnot see the portentous political significance of the transaction, and\r\nalmost sank under the multitude and variety of congratulations which he\r\nreceived from watchful friends. He has done many great and successful\r\nthings in the course of his brilliant career--but he never achieved a\r\ntriumph so complete and so prompt as he did when he put on his light\r\ntweed suit, and steered under its illuminating rays the Home Rule Bill\r\nthrough the rocks and shoals, the eddies and the cross-currents of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A brilliant pas de deux.]\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon there was another scene in which clothes had\r\ntheir share. At about three o'clock there entered the House together two\r\nslight, alert figures--in both cases a little above the middle height,\r\nand both clothed in a suit of clothes the exact counterpart of each\r\nother in make, shape, and colour. There was a dominant and almost\r\nmonotonous grey in their appearance; but there was little of grey in\r\ntheir looks. When at once there burst from the Tory and Unionists\r\nBenches a loud, wild, prolonged huzzah, it was seen that this theatrical\r\nlittle entrance at one and the same time of Joe and Mr. Balfour, was\r\ntheir method of accentuating the Tory triumph in Linlithgow. The two\r\ngentlemen seen entering together separated as they walked up the\r\nfloor--the Tory going to his place on the front Opposition Bench, the\r\nUnionist to his corner seat on the Liberal side. It was a very skilfully\r\narranged bit of business, though there were critics who thought its\r\nhistrionic element a little out of place in the sombre and solemn\r\nrealities of public life, and a great national controversy. In the midst\r\nof it all I looked at Mr. Gladstone. It is in such moments that you are\r\nable to get a glimpse into all the great depths of this extraordinary\r\nnature. And I have written more than once in these columns that the\r\ngreatest of all his characteristics is composure. This mighty, restless,\r\nfiery fighter against wrong--this stalwart and unconquerable wrestler\r\nfor right, this Titan--I might even say this Don Quixote--who has gone\r\nout with spear and sword to assault the most strongly-entrenched\r\ncitadels of human wrongs--who has faced a world in arms--this man has,\r\nafter all, at the centre of his existence, and in the depths of his\r\nnature, a gospel which sustains him in the hours of defeat and gloom,\r\nand makes him one of the most restless of combatants, and the most\r\ntranquil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The grand old philosopher.]\r\n\r\nDevotional, almost pietistic, introspective, accustomed, I have no\r\ndoubt, from that early training of domestic piety and sacerdotal\r\nsurroundings, to see all this gay, vast phantasmagoria of life the\r\nantechamber to a greater, more enduring, and better world beyond those\r\nvoices, Mr. Gladstone--at least that is my reading of his\r\ncharacter--looks at everything in human existence with the power of\r\nself-detachment from its garish moments and its transient interests.\r\nBehind this constant warfare, underneath all this public passion and\r\nsweeping resolves, there is a nether and unseen world of thought,\r\nemotion, hope, and in that world there is ever calm. It is a tabernacle\r\nin his soul where only holy thoughts may enter. Outside its impenetrable\r\nand echoless walls are left behind the shouts of faction, the noise of\r\nbattle, the rise and fall of the good and ever-enduring fight between\r\nwrong and right. Within that tabernacle Mr. Gladstone has the power of\r\nwithdrawing himself at will, just as in the Agora of Athens, and on the\r\nlast great day when he discoursed on immortality, and drank the mortal\r\nhemlock, Socrates could withdraw himself, and listen to the inner\r\nwhisper of his dæmon. All this, I say, you could see in the abstracted,\r\nresigned and composed look of Mr. Gladstone at the moment when his\r\ntriumphant enemies, in their summer garb, with their smiling faces, and\r\nstrutting walk, entered the House of Commons. If you wanted to see at\r\nonce the contrast, not only of the temper of the hour, but the still\r\ngreater and more momentous contrast of temperaments, you had only to\r\nlook from the face of Mr. Gladstone to that of Mr. Chamberlain. The\r\ncontrast of their years--the deeper contrast of their natures--above\r\nall, the profounder contrast of their worlds of thought, training and\r\nenvironment--all were brought out. In that perky, retroussé-nosed,\r\nself-complacent, confidently smiling man you saw all the\r\nflippancy--so-called realism--the petty commercialism of the end of the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. The mysticism, the poetry, the rich\r\ndevotion, the lofty and large ideals of the beginning of the century--of\r\nthe time that remembered Byron and produced Newman--all these things\r\nwere to be seen in the rapt look of that noble, beautiful and refined\r\nface on the Treasury Bench. And yet there was something more. The\r\nbrilliant light of the early days of our century has become dim and cold\r\nin those hearts and minds which have not had the power to grow and\r\nexpand with their ages. But with that splendid sanity of body as well as\r\nmind which belongs to him, Mr. Gladstone is the creature of the ending\r\nof the nineteenth as of the beginning of the twentieth century. Like the\r\nman of Arctic climes, he stands almost at the same moment in the sunset\r\nof one great century and the heralding light of the sunrise of another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BURSTING OF THE STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Indian summer.]\r\n\r\nThere is a striking description in one of Mr. Rudyard Kipling's stories\r\nof a night in an Indian city when the dog star rages. Luridly, but\r\nvigorously, the author brings home to you the odious discomfort, the\r\nawful suffering, and, finally, the morose anger and almost homicidal\r\nfury, which the sweltering light produces in the waking soldiers. This\r\nwould have been something like the temper of the House of Commons on\r\nJune 18th, if that assembly had not recently discovered methods of\r\nsaving its temper and pleasantly spending its vacant hours. For the dog\r\nstar--raging, merciless, sweltering--ruled everywhere within Westminster\r\nPalace. On the floor of the House itself, men sweltered and mopped their\r\nforeheads; in even the recesses of the still library they groaned aloud;\r\nthen down on the Terrace, and with the river sweeping by, there was not\r\na particle of air; and the heat of all the day had made even the stony\r\nfloor of that beautiful walk almost like the tiles of a red-hot oven. In\r\nshort, it was a day when one felt one's own poor tenement of clay a\r\nmisery, a nuisance, and a burden; and the mind, morose, black, and\r\ndespondent, had distracting visions of distant mirages by the seashore\r\nor under green trees. It was natural, under such circumstances, that\r\neverybody who could should desert the House of Commons. And this sudden\r\ndesertion of the House will be always remembered as one of the many\r\npeculiarities of the Annus Mirabilis through which we are passing. It\r\nhas not been unusual for some years for members to take a turn on the\r\nTerrace now and then. I have paced its floor at every hour of the night\r\nand the day--from the still midnight to the delightful moments before\r\nbreaking day; and I still remember the beautiful summery morning when,\r\nafter a hard night's fight, an Irish member rushed down to the Terrace\r\nto tell Mr. Sexton and myself that we were just being suspended--an\r\noperation not yet grown customary. But this Session the majority of the\r\nHouse of Commons is always on the Terrace; and woman--that sleuth-hound\r\nof every new pleasure--has discovered this great fact, and utilised it\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tea on the Terrace.]\r\n\r\nThe afternoon tea--the strawberries and cream which make a coolness and\r\ndelight in the midst of the raging day--has been erected by woman into\r\none of London's daily social events; and though the novelist has not\r\ndiscovered the fact up to this moment--Mr. McCarthy has made a very\r\npretty love scene on the Terrace, but it is at the witching hour of\r\nnight--though this discovery has yet to come, the respite is brief, and\r\nin a short time we shall have the hero and the heroine passing through\r\nall the agonies of three-volume suffering, to the accompaniment of the\r\ndivision bell and the small tea-table of the Terrace. But though woman\r\nhas many slaves she has her watchful enemies. The great order of\r\ncurmudgeon is wide and vigilant and crusty, and the curmudgeon has found\r\nthat the vast crowds of ladies who have invaded the Terrace have at last\r\nbegun to interfere with that daily constitutional along its stretching\r\nlength, which is the only exercise most members of Parliament are able\r\nto take in these fierce days. Accordingly, there appeared an ominous\r\nnotice-board with the words, \"For members only,\" at a particular point\r\nin the Terrace. Within the space, before which this notice stood as a\r\nfiery sword, woman was not allowed to intrude; and from out its sacred\r\nenclosure--guarded by nothing but the line of the notice and the\r\nSpeaker's wrath--the confirmed bachelor, the married cynic, smoked his\r\ncigarette, and looked lazily through at the chattering, tea-drinking,\r\nbright-coloured crowd immediately beyond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demos and dinner.]\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the great Demos had an opportunity of seeing the\r\nlegislator at work and play, and that the remarks of that extremely\r\nirreverent person were not complimentary. Reading, doubtless, in the\r\npapers something of the fatiguing labours--of the stern attention to\r\nbusiness--of the long and dreary hours which the patriots of the House\r\nof Commons were devoting to the work of the country, Demos was shocked\r\nand scandalised to behold this giddy, fashionable, and modish crowd.\r\nDemos, sweltering on the passing steamboat--able to see, and, at the\r\nsame time, free from interference on his watery kingdom--jeered aloud as\r\nhe passed close to the Terrace, and mocked with loud laughter that\r\nbetokened not only the vacant but the insulting mind. The skippers of\r\nthe steamboats--hardened Cockneys with an eye to business--knew what a\r\ndelight this baiting of the august assembly would be to the most\r\ndemocratic and most sarcastic crowd in Europe; and accordingly it became\r\nthe \"mot d'ordre\" with the steamboat skipper, when the tide was full, to\r\nbring his vessel almost to the very walls of the Terrace, and thus to\r\ngive the tripper the opportunity of gazing from very near at the lions\r\nat food and play. If Demos could have come and seen as plainly at night\r\nin those days as during the afternoon, his shocked feelings would have\r\nbeen even more poignant and his language more irreverent. Tea is, after\r\nall, a simple drink that makes the whole world akin; and even\r\nstrawberries in this great year were within reach of the most modest\r\npurse. But at night, entertainment is more costly. Along the Terrace\r\nthere is now, as everybody knows, a series of small dining-rooms; and\r\nhere every night you might have listened to the pleasant music of\r\nwoman's laughter, punctuated by the pop of the champagne bottle. Time\r\nwas--I remember it well--when a member of Parliament who knew that\r\nthere was any place where a lady could get something to eat was pointed\r\nto as a Parliamentary marvel, who knew his way about in an uncanny\r\nfashion; when the room in which a lady could dine had been seen by but\r\nfew eyes and, indeed, was little better than a coalhole, low-roofed,\r\ndimly lit, buried in dark and deep recesses of an underworld of the\r\nHouse of Commons, as little known to the general member as the sewage\r\ncatacombs of London to the ordinary citizen. But all this has been\r\nchanged; and now the dinner to ladies at the House of Commons has\r\nbecome, like the afternoon tea, one of the best recognized of London's\r\nsocial festivities. And so great is the run on these dinners that it\r\ntakes a week's--or even two weeks'--notice to secure a table. Mr.\r\nCobbe--a stern and unbending Radical, with a hot temper and unsparing\r\ntongue--might have been seen one of those June days with a menacing\r\nfrown upon his rugged Radical forehead, and by-and-bye in serious\r\nconverse with the Speaker. And the cause of his anger was that he had\r\nfound all the dining-tables ordered for two weeks ahead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A wild scene.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the Freemasons, on June 22nd, Mr. Gladstone related the\r\ninteresting autobiographical fact that he himself was not a Freemason,\r\nand never had been; and, indeed, having been fully occupied\r\notherwise--this delicate allusion to that vast life of never-ending\r\nwork--of gigantic enterprises--of solemn and sublime responsibilities,\r\nwas much relished--he never had had sufficient curiosity to make any\r\nparticular inquiries as to what Freemasonry really was. I don't know\r\nwhat came over Mr. Balfour--some people thought it was because he\r\nexpected to detach some Freemason votes from the Liberal side; but he\r\nwas guilty of what I admit is an unusual thing with him--an intentional,\r\na gross, an almost shameful misrepresentation of Mr. Gladstone's words.\r\nMaking the same interesting personal statement as Mr. Gladstone, that he\r\nwas not himself a Freemason, he went on to suggest that Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad made a comparison between a fraudulent Liberator Society and the\r\nFreemasons. At this thrust there was a terrible hubbub in the House, and\r\nthat fanaticism with which the Mason holds to his institution was\r\naroused; indeed, for a little while, the scene was Bedlam-like in its\r\npassion and anarchy. In the midst of it all, facing the violent howls of\r\nthe excited Tories, pale, disturbed, hotly angry underneath all the\r\ncomposure of language and tone, Mr. Gladstone exposed the shameful and\r\nentirely groundless misrepresentation. Mr. Balfour's better angel\r\nintervened; he got ashamed of himself, and at once apologized. But the\r\nhurricane of passion which had been let loose was not to be so easily\r\nappeased; and when, presently, Mr. John Morley put an end to the\r\nridiculous and irrelevant discussion which threatened to land the House\r\nof Commons into the consideration of the arcana of a Freemason's Lodge,\r\nthere burst from the Tory benches one of the fiercest little storms of\r\nremonstrance I have ever heard. When the closure is proposed, there is\r\nbut one way of expressing emotion. Under the rules of the House, the\r\nmotion must be put without debate. So when the word of doom is\r\npronounced by the Minister, all that remains is for the Speaker or\r\nChairman to refuse or accept the motion; and if he accept the motion, he\r\nsimply rises, and, uttering the fateful words, \"The question is that the\r\nmotion be now put,\" guillotines all further speech. But then he has to\r\nput the question, and in the answering words of \"Aye\" or \"No,\" there can\r\nbe put an immense fund of passion. So it was that night. The answering\r\n\"Noes\" reached the proportions of a cyclone; you could see men shrieking\r\nout the word again and again, almost beside themselves with rage, and\r\nwith faces positively distorted by the intensity of their feelings. And\r\nthe tempest did not end in a moment; again and again the Tories shouted\r\ntheir hoarse and tempestuous, and angry \"No, no!\"--the word sometimes\r\nrepeated like a volley: \"No, no-o-o, no-o-o-o-o!\"--this was the noise\r\nthat rose on the Parliamentary air, and that gave vent to all the\r\npassion which had been excited. And then came the division and a\r\nrestoration of calm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charwomen and ratcatchers.]\r\n\r\nThe Whip is a cunning dog, especially if he be the Whip of the party in\r\npower; and you have to be a long time in Parliament before you know all\r\nhis wiles, and fully appreciate their meaning. For instance, few\r\ninnocent outsiders would understand why it is that the Whip always puts\r\ndown Estimates for a day immediately after the end of a vacation. The\r\nreasons are two. First, because Estimates give more time and opportunity\r\nfor the mere bore and obstructive than any other part of Parliamentary\r\nbusiness. On the Estimates, as I have often explained, every single\r\npenny spent in the public service has to be entered. Whether that sum be\r\nlarge or small makes no difference. For instance, there is a charwoman\r\nat the Foreign Office; the charwoman's salary appears in the accounts\r\njust as bold and just as plain as the five thousand a year which the\r\ncountry has to pay for Lord Rosebery--who is cheap at the money, I must\r\nsay, lest I be misunderstood. There is associated with Buckingham Palace\r\na most worthy and useful individual called the ratcatcher. Everybody can\r\nsee why in such a vast and generally untenanted barrack, there should be\r\na ratcatcher. Well, Master Ratcatcher appears on the Estimates for\r\nBuckingham Palace just as regularly, as plainly, in as much detail, as\r\nmy Lord High Chamberlain, Lord Carrington. There is no reason whatever\r\nwhy a whole evening should not be spent in the discussion of the\r\nratcatcher's salary. Perhaps the reader may have heard that, in common\r\nwith many sobered and middle-aged gentlemen, I have had a pre-historic\r\nperiod when I was accused--of course, unjustly--of interfering with the\r\nprogress of public business. In that period, I remember very well, the\r\nratcatcher of Buckingham Palace loomed largely, as well as many other\r\nstrange and portentous figures now vanished into the void and the\r\nimmensities. I don't know whether we were able to keep the Ministry\r\ngoing for a whole night on the subject or not; but still we managed to\r\nget some excellent change out of the business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The wistful Whip.]\r\n\r\nThis brief explanation will make the reader understand what it is you\r\ncan do on the Estimates, and therefore bring home to your mind the wile\r\nof the Ministerial Whip. For his second reason for putting down the\r\nEstimates until after vacation is, that he knows there will be a very\r\nsmall attendance of members, and that thus he will be able to sneak\r\nthrough his Estimates more quickly than usual. When, therefore, you hear\r\nof a vacation in the House of Commons, you will always find that the\r\nmembers ask with peculiar anxiety what is to be the first business on\r\nthe day on which the vacation concludes; and you will hear the audible\r\nsigh of relief which will rise from hundreds of oppressed bosoms when\r\nthe Leader of the House for the time being announces that it will be\r\nEstimates. Members then know that they need be in no violent hurry to\r\nget back, and that things will go right, even though they should tarry\r\nthat additional day, or even two days, longer by the sad sea waves or\r\namid the tall grass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To thy orisons.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the peculiarities of the House of Commons that the men who\r\nare most in want of spiritual assistance and providential guidance,\r\nnever seek the assistance of prayer. However terrible the crisis,\r\nhowever crowded every other inch of space in the House of Commons may\r\nbe, though the ungodliest member may be in his place listening to the\r\nrich resonance of Archdeacon Farrar's voice, the Treasury Bench is\r\nalways empty. To an outsider the explanation may be here revealed; which\r\nis, that if you attend prayers you are entitled to a seat for the\r\nremainder of the evening, whereas if you are absent, you are liable at\r\nany moment to be turned out by your more pious brother. But Ministers\r\nare exempt from this general law, for their places are fixed for them on\r\nthe Treasury Bench, whatever may happen, and, accordingly, they\r\ninvariably--I had almost said religiously--keep away from prayers. Lest\r\nI should appear to do injustice, I may say that the leaders of the\r\nOpposition are just as ungodly, and for precisely the same reason; their\r\nseats also are secured to them by standing order; and, accordingly, they\r\nalso never enter the House until its devotions for the day are over.\r\nThere was just one exception to this. For some reason best known to\r\nhimself, Sir John Gorst (he is usually at variance with his friends) had\r\ncome down early on June 28th, and was in his place with edifying aspect\r\nto listen to the solemn exhortation and the soft responses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The shout of battle.]\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past twelve there is a roar in the House; the Old Man\r\nhas arrived; and there ascends that bracing cheer with which in our\r\nstill barbarous times we welcome our champions on the eve of a big\r\nfight. The Old Man has hurried, for he is out of breath; and the deadly\r\npallor of his cheek is almost affrighting to see. But he soon recovers\r\nhimself, though when he rises to speak the breathlessness is still very\r\napparent, and he has to gasp almost now and then for more voice.\r\nFortunately on this occasion we have not long to wait for the big\r\nannouncement which everybody is so anxiously expecting. It is usually\r\nthe fate of the House of Commons, whenever something very momentous is\r\nunder weigh, to have a thousand trivialities in its path before it gets\r\non to the real business. I have heard something like a hundred questions\r\nasked, most of them very trivial, on more than one night, when the whole\r\nof the civilized world was waiting for the Minister to develop some\r\ngreat plan of Governmental policy. The bore, the faddist, the empty\r\nself-advertiser, is as inevitable on such occasions as the reportorial\r\ndog that always rushes along the Derby course at that dread moment when\r\nyou can hear the beating of the gamblers' hearts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To business.]\r\n\r\nBut on this fateful Wednesday there is no such ridiculous intervention.\r\nThere are only two questions altogether on the paper; and both of those\r\nrefer to the great issue of how obstruction is to be put down. Mr.\r\nGladstone answers the questions very briefly; but there is hidden and\r\nfateful meaning in every syllable he utters; and the House of Commons,\r\nlooking on, shows itself in one of those moments which bring out all its\r\npicturesqueness--its latent passions--its very human characteristics.\r\nThere is the eager strain of curiosity. Every face is turned to that of\r\nthe single pale white solitary figure that stands out from the Treasury\r\nBench, dressed, I may add, in the sober but light grey suit of the\r\nsummer season, in spite of his being a messenger of such doom to Tory\r\nobstruction. There is a hush, but a hush never lasts long in the House\r\nof Commons when a great party blow is going to be struck. The nerves of\r\nthe House, raised to expectancy--tension, almost hysteria, by the joy of\r\nthe one side, the anger and dread of the other, have a preternatural\r\nreadiness in catching points, in producing outbursts of feeling. And so\r\nit is to-day. The Prime Minister has scarcely uttered the words which\r\nreveal the determination of the Government to resort to the most extreme\r\nmeasures, when there burst simultaneously from the Irish and the Tory\r\nBenches cheers and counter cheers--the cheer of pride, joy, and delirium\r\nalmost, in the one case; the answering cheer and counter cheer of\r\nhaughty and angered defiance in the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balfour the unready.]\r\n\r\nThe Old Man bears himself splendidly amidst all this. He is very excited\r\nand very resolute--you can see that by the very deadliness of\r\ntranquillity which he seeks to put in his voice, by the gentleness of\r\nhis tone, by the almost deprecatory smile. All the same, the prevalent\r\nnote of his voice and manner is composure. For the moment, either from\r\nsurprise, relief, the joy they can badly conceal--whatever the reason,\r\nthe Tories seem to be nonplussed. The audacious ally who is always ready\r\nto rush rashly into the breach on such occasions is away in Birmingham;\r\nand with all his excellent qualities, Mr. Balfour is not remarkable for\r\nreadiness. Accordingly there is an awkward pause, and no one rises from\r\nthe Opposition Benches. This is serious, for first blood tells in\r\nParliamentary as in other prize fights. The Old Man, however, is all\r\nalive. He passes on from this mighty announcement as though he had said\r\nnothing in particular, and taking a bundle of notes--put together with\r\ncharacteristic care and neatness even in the very centre of all this\r\nstorm--he proceeds to tell Mr. Goschen something about the currency\r\nquestion, and the state of the silver market in India. The currency--who\r\ncares about the currency now? Even the hardiest bimetallist cannot be\r\ngot to think of his hobby in the face of the dread news just heard. By\r\nthe time Mr. Gladstone has given his answers, Mr. Balfour has managed to\r\nslightly recover himself, and has framed a question to the Old Man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The precedent of 1887.]\r\n\r\nWhen at last the question does come, it is of a very innocent character.\r\nThe Old Man has declared that he had not the terms of the resolution\r\nready, but that they would be announced to the House before its rising\r\nin the evening. All Mr. Balfour wishes to know is, what time it will be\r\nwhen these terms are given. Such is the simple question; but the reply\r\nis of a very different character. It was delivered in studiously\r\nmoderate terms; the voice of Mr. Gladstone never rises above a sweet\r\ncoo; but there is fire, defiance, inflexible determination in every\r\nsyllable, and the first blow is struck when the wily Old Man\r\nannounces--as though it were the merest business affair--that the\r\nclosure resolution which the Government will introduce, is founded upon\r\nthe principle of the resolution of 1887. He can go no further for\r\nseveral seconds. The Irish, with their ready wits--their fierce and keen\r\nmemories--have caught the point at once; and they burst into a\r\ncheer--loud, fierce, and prolonged. What it means is this: In 1887, the\r\nTories had carried a closure resolution for the purpose of forcing\r\nthrough the Coercion Bill of that year; and it was under the working of\r\nthat closure resolution that the Bill had finally passed the House of\r\nCommons, with several of its clauses undebated. What, then, this fierce\r\nIrish cheer meant was that the chickens were coming home to roost; and\r\nthat the Tories were now reaping the harvest of their own sowing. With\r\ngrave face the Old Man waited until the storm had spent itself, and then\r\nhe went on to make a little slip, which for the moment gave his enemies\r\nan excellent opening.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution or resolution.]\r\n\r\nHe spoke not of the resolution, but of the revolution. He corrected the\r\nslip with great rapidity, but he was not quick enough for his watchful\r\nenemies, and loudly--discordantly--triumphantly--they repeated the word\r\nafter him--Revolution--Revolution. However, Mr. Gladstone, after his\r\nSocratic fashion, lowered his eyes for a moment and went off into one of\r\nthose abstract reveries whither he always allows his fancy to wend its\r\nway whenever his opponents are particularly rancorous. Then he described\r\nthe resolution--not the revolution--as in the interest of the\r\nconvenience and liberty of the House. But he immediately added--with the\r\nsweetest smile--that Mr. Balfour would doubtless form his own judgment\r\non that point; and then, still calm, sweet, with the tendency to the\r\nreverie of the good man grossly misjudged by sinful opponents, he sat\r\nhim down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An awkward moment.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the exultation which the announcement of the Government\r\nhad produced in the Liberal ranks, there came a difficulty and a\r\nhumiliation. An amendment had been proposed, Mr. Gladstone had twice\r\nopposed it, everything pointed to its ignominious rejection, and, in\r\nview of the coming closure, everybody seemed to want rapid despatch. And\r\nthus a division was immediately called. The House was cleared; members\r\nrushed in, and, indeed, had already begun to pass through the lobby;\r\nwhen suddenly there was a complete change of tactics; Mr. Marjoribanks,\r\nrushing to the Treasury Bench, called upon the Government to capitulate.\r\nThe fact got out; the Government were in a minority--their forces had\r\nnot come in time, and the Tories would have beaten us if they had been\r\nallowed to go to a division. It was one of the narrowest shaves--one of\r\nthe most uncomfortable quarters of a minute--we have had in the House of\r\nCommons for many a long day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fateful moment.]\r\n\r\nBut half-past five comes at last; then the discussion on the Home Rule\r\nBill has to come to an end, and the Speaker takes the chair. Members\r\nthink there is a look of unusual excitement on his face, that its air is\r\nangry; and the Unionists take comfort from the idea that this step is\r\nagainst his judgment. But, then, it is a matter for the House itself and\r\nnot for the decision of the chair, and so we go ahead. Mr. Morley is put\r\nup by Mr. Gladstone to read the words of the resolution. The Old Man\r\nhimself is composedly writing that letter to the Queen which it is still\r\nhis duty daily to indite. Mr. Morley's face betrays under all its\r\nstudied calm, the excitement of the hour, and he reads every separate\r\nannouncement with a certain dramatic emphasis that brings out all the\r\nhidden meaning; and the document is one, the reading of which lends\r\nitself to dramatic effect and to dramatic manifestations. For each\r\nclause winds up with the same words, at \"ten of the clock,\" until these\r\nwords come to sound something like the burden of a song--the refrain of\r\na lament--the iteration of an Athanasian curse against sinners and\r\nheretics. The House sees all this; and each side manifests emotion\r\naccording to its fashion. The Irish cheer themselves hoarse in triumph;\r\nthe Tories answer back as defiantly and loudly; and so we enter, with\r\nclang of battle, with shouts and cheers, and hoarse cries of joy or of\r\nrage, into the second great pitched battle on Home Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMR. DILLON'S FORGETFULNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Dillon.]\r\n\r\nEverybody who has ever met Mr. Dillon knows that he has a singularly\r\neven and equable temper, except at the moments when he has been stung to\r\npassion by the sight of some bitter and intolerable wrong. When,\r\ntherefore, Mr. Chamberlain made him the subject of a fierce attack on\r\naccount of a past utterance, he was dealing with a man who was as little\r\ninfluenced by such attacks as anybody could well be. For days Mr.\r\nChamberlain had been trying to bait Mr. Dillon into speech; and for days\r\nMr. Dillon had positively refused to be drawn. At last it seemed to some\r\nfriends of Mr. Dillon that if he did not speak his attitude might be\r\nmisunderstood, and that he would be supposed to entertain, as part of a\r\nsettled policy, what he had really uttered on the spur of the moment and\r\nunder the influence of intolerable wrong and provocation. But when in\r\nthe last days of June Mr. Chamberlain made his attack, and Mr. Dillon\r\nhad listened to it and asked for dates, Mr. Dillon thought that the\r\nmatter would not be worth further attending to, and relapsed into his\r\nold attitude of easy contempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The outbreak.]\r\n\r\nThis will account for what would otherwise be inexplicable; namely,\r\nthat, having had a week to prepare his defence, Mr. Dillon should on\r\nJuly 3rd have fallen into a dreadful, and, for the moment, disastrous\r\nblunder. The truth was, Mr. Dillon had never thought of the subject for\r\nmore than a few moments between the date of the challenge and Mr.\r\nChamberlain's renewal of the attack, and, if he had been left free to\r\nexercise his own judgment, would have allowed the whole thing to lapse\r\ninto the nothingness into which every such charge finally falls. On this\r\nMonday night Mr. Chamberlain was in his most venomous mood. He had come\r\ndown to the House with the set determination to get up a row somehow or\r\nother. There was evil in his eye; there was rancour in his voice; there\r\nwas the hoarse rage which always shows in him whenever he feels that he\r\nhas been beaten. His judgment is so shallow--his temper so rash and\r\nviolent--that some people think he actually counted that the Government\r\nwould never have dared to interfere with his obstructive plan of\r\ncampaign, and that he would have been permitted to bury the Bill under\r\nthe vast hedge of amendments. To him, then, the strong and drastic\r\naction of the preceding week had come as a painful and most exasperating\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe's weakness.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the many bad turns that Joe's temper does him to always\r\nlead him into overdoing his part. The wild outbursts of his venom--the\r\nferocity which he puts into his personal attacks--these things have the\r\neffect of producing a certain amount of reaction; and thus his blows\r\noften suffer from the very violence with which they are dealt. A real\r\nmaster of Parliamentary craft, like Mr. Gladstone or Mr. Sexton, has\r\nlearned the lesson--the lesson which all orators of all ages have\r\nlearned--that there is nothing so deadly as moderation; that he destroys\r\nthe effectiveness of a passion by tearing it to pieces, and that you are\r\nreally effective when you have complete control of your temper, your\r\nvoice and your language.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mitchelstown.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dillon, rising--pale, high-strung, and nervous--was a sympathetic\r\nsight, and the House was ready to listen to him with the greatest\r\nattention. The Old Man was specially interested. Whenever nowadays, when\r\nhis hearing has become somewhat defective, he wants particularly to\r\nhear a speech, he has to change his place; usually, as everybody knows,\r\nhe sits exactly opposite the box on the Speaker's table. This evening he\r\nwent to the last seat on the Treasury Bench--the seat nearest to the\r\nspot from which Mr. Dillon was about to speak, and with his hand to his\r\near he prepared himself to catch every word that Mr. Dillon was about to\r\nutter, and the speech of Mr. Dillon was--in spite of the halting tones\r\nwhich excitement, unpreparedness, the sense of his responsibility\r\nproduced--singularly effective. The passionate and transparent sincerity\r\nof the man--the sense of all the years of suffering through which he\r\npassed--the recollection of all the risks he has run in the great\r\ncontemporary Irish Revolution--all these things spoke in his favour.\r\nEspecially was he effective when he described the circumstances under\r\nwhich he had delivered the speech, a passage from which had been\r\nincriminated by Mr. Chamberlain. He had been told just half-an-hour\r\nbefore he rose to speak, of how a poor mother had been torn from her\r\nbabe; how the two had been taken over a long journey together, and had\r\nboth been finally lodged in the same cell. And he asked with a\r\npassionate thrill in his voice, that carried away the House with him,\r\nwhether anybody else under the same circumstances would not have\r\nprotested in language of violence and vehemence against the cruelty and\r\nofficial brutality which allowed such things to be. Would not anybody\r\nhave protested that the officials who were guilty of these things had\r\nnot to look to reward or promotion from a popular Irish Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fatal mistake.]\r\n\r\nSo far, Mr. Dillon had the House completely with him. He also scored for\r\na second or two. He went on to remark that he had been under the\r\ninfluence of the massacre at Mitchelstown; but scarcely had these words\r\nproceeded from his lips than a look of dismay passed over the faces of\r\nhis Irish colleagues. Close beside him were several men who, like\r\nhimself, had stood on the platform of the historic square when the\r\npolice descended upon the meeting, and which ended in the death of\r\nthree innocent men. They at once perceived that Mr. Dillon, by some\r\nbreak of memory, had made a mistake in his dates. The incriminating\r\nspeech had been delivered in December, 1886, and the Mitchelstown\r\nmassacre took place in September, 1887. If the Irish members had not\r\nperceived this blunder immediately they would soon have been brought to\r\na sense of coming disaster by the movements on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chamberlain on the spring.]\r\n\r\nMr. T.W. Russell is always at the service of Mr. Chamberlain at such a\r\nmoment. A platform speaker by training and by years of professional\r\nwork, accustomed to make most of his case against Home Rule depend on\r\nthe characters, the words, the acts of the Irish members, he has, of\r\ncourse, at his fingers' ends, all the useful extracts of the last\r\nthirteen years. At once he was seen to rush excitedly from the House.\r\nEvery Irishman knew at once that he was going to the library to\r\nreinforce his memory with regard to the date of Mitchelstown. A murmur\r\narose on the Irish Benches; slips of paper were passed up to Mr. Dillon\r\nto recall to him the facts of the case; but, either in the hurry and\r\nexcitement, or because he did not appreciate the situation immediately,\r\nMr. Dillon went on with his speech--unconscious of the abyss that opened\r\nup before him. Meantime, Mr. Chamberlain--pale, excited, his face torn\r\nwith the workings of gratified hatred and coming triumph--sat forward in\r\nhis seat, his eyeglass shining from afar, eagerness in every look, pose,\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chamberlain pounces.]\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Russell was back in his place; it did not require much\r\nsecond sight to see that his quest had been successful, and that he had\r\nbrought to Mr. Chamberlain the ammunition he required in order to slay\r\nJohn Dillon. The moment Mr. Dillon sat down, Mr. Chamberlain was on his\r\nfeet. He worked up to the situation with some skill; but, after all,\r\nwith that overdone passion which, as I have already said, spoils some of\r\nhis greatest effects--he did not expose the mistake in his first few\r\nsentences. He worked up the agony, so to speak. First he recalled to the\r\nLiberals--whose hatred to him he feels and returns with interest--the\r\nfact that they had cheered Mr. Dillon's allusion to the effect\r\nMitchelstown had had on him in provoking the violence of his speech. And\r\nthen when he had created his situation, he pounced down on the House\r\nwith the climax--the speech had been delivered in 1886, the Mitchelstown\r\ntragedy had taken place in the following year. It would be idle to deny\r\nthat Mr. Chamberlain had then one of the most triumphant moments of his\r\nlife. It was a small point, after all, and, as everybody soon knew, it\r\nwas all the result of a natural and a perfectly honest mistake. But the\r\nHouse of Commons is not particular in weighing things in judicial scales\r\nat moments of intense political passion. There rose from the Tory and\r\nthe Unionist Benches one of the longest, fiercest, most triumphant\r\nshouts that was ever heard in the House of Commons. But then, as I again\r\nmust say, and as will soon be seen, the passion was overdone, and a\r\nswift retribution came by-and-bye. For the moment, however, it was\r\ngiddily, dazzlingly triumphant, and Joe had one of the few moments of\r\nhis life which were unrelieved by disaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A diversion.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment--and, curiously enough, his victory was very soon\r\ndashed to the ground--that Mr. Harrington, one of the Parnellites,\r\nstruck in with a blow. In Parliamentary, as in other tactics, one of the\r\nwisest expedients--especially if things are going rather wrong with\r\nyourself--is to carry the war into the enemies' country. And this is\r\nexactly what Mr. Harrington did. He turned upon Joe and denounced him\r\nfor seeking at one time to obtain the alliance of these very Irish\r\nmembers whom now he was denouncing. He accused him of sending\r\nambassadors to them when they were in prison, and, in short, brought Joe\r\nface to face with an almost forgotten period of his history. Then he was\r\nalmost a Home Ruler in profession, and looked to the Irish members as a\r\nportion of the force he would by-and-bye marshal in his own army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A quid pro quo.]\r\n\r\nJoe grew pale. It is a curious fact that, whenever any allusion is made\r\nto this special period of his life, Mr. Chamberlain becomes particularly\r\ndisturbed; possibly, it is that he is conscious of the rash things he\r\nhas said at this period; possibly, it is that it can be proved to the\r\nworld that he was at this period in favour of the principles and the men\r\nhe now so loudly denounces. Whatever the reason, it is perfectly\r\ncertain, if you want to put Mr. Chamberlain into a rage, and what\r\nsailors call a funk, allude to the period of Parnell's imprisonment in\r\nKilmainham, and Mr. Duignan's letter on the Irish question. The\r\ntransformation from the exalted look a few moments before to the pale,\r\ncowed aspect which Mr. Chamberlain wore was one of the most sudden\r\ntransformations I have ever seen in the House of Commons. He could\r\nscarcely sit in his seat while Mr. Harrington was speaking; again and\r\nagain he rose to interrupt him altogether, and gave signs of unusual\r\nexcitement and disturbance. But Mr. Harrington is a deft and tenacious\r\ncombatant. In spite of all attempts to stop him, in spite of the\r\ntremendous uproar raised by the Unionists and Tories, he managed to get\r\nout what he had to say. He brought Mr. Chamberlain face to face with\r\nthis spectre of his dead past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Balfour does not score.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, Mr. Balfour made a great mistake. He had listened to the\r\nspeech of Mr. Chamberlain, and had been one of those who had joined in\r\nthe cheers at the exposure of Mr. Dillon's accidental mistake. There he\r\nshould have left it, but, carried away by the hope of driving the point\r\nhome against a political enemy, he needs must add something to what Mr.\r\nChamberlain had said. Now Mr. Balfour is in many points very superior to\r\nJoe. He should leave personal vituperation to him: he is more active,\r\ndefter, and more willing to do such dirty work. Moreover, it is in the\r\nrecollection of the members that, in the Coercionist struggle, Mr.\r\nBalfour seemed to have towards Mr. Dillon an unusual amount of personal\r\nanimosity. Speaking with want of grace and personal courtesy, which are\r\nthings, I am bound to say, uncommon with him, he accused Mr. Dillon of\r\ndeliberate and conscious hypocrisy. This also was a tactical blunder,\r\nand will largely account for the transformation following, to which I am\r\ngoing to refer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The transformation.]\r\n\r\nThe House on the following day, July 4th, was very still when Mr. Dillon\r\nrose--evidently to refer to the incident of the previous night. His\r\naddress was quiet, brief, and graceful. With charming modesty, he\r\nacknowledged the mistake he had made, and explained how, in running over\r\nin memory the hundreds of speeches he had delivered, he had confounded\r\none speech with another. He was unable to understand how his memory,\r\nwhich never before had played him false, had done him this ill turn, and\r\nhe appealed to the House generally, and declared that there was not even\r\namongst his bitter political foes one who would think him capable of\r\ntrying to palm off on the House a speech which could be so palpably and\r\nso readily exposed. In these few sentences, Mr. Dillon brought before\r\nthe House his strange, picturesque, and chequered career. His oratory\r\nwas such that the explanation was considered the best ever given in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe is absent.]\r\n\r\nThis was a recovery of some ground lost on the previous night. But there\r\nwas even better to come. Mr. Harrington's accuracy and veracity as to\r\nMr. Chamberlain's dealings with the Irish members had been challenged,\r\nas I have said, by Mr. Chamberlain, and he now rose to read the historic\r\nletter of Mr. Duignan, which, he claimed, justified his account. Several\r\nattempts were made to stop Mr. Harrington, and the Tories during this\r\nwere decidedly annoyed and embarrassed because Mr. Chamberlain happened\r\nnot to be in his place. But doggedly and persistently Mr. Harrington\r\nheld to his ground, and at last the Speaker allowed him to read the\r\nletter. The reading of the letter led to various scenes, because it was\r\none of those balanced utterances in which Mr. Chamberlain used to try to\r\nhold one foot in the Unionist and to place the other in the Home Rule\r\ncamp. There were speeches about the County Councils, and there had been\r\nUnionist and Tory cheers in relief; but when immediately afterwards\r\nthere were allusions to Home Rule, very little different in scope or\r\ncharacter from that proposed by Mr. Gladstone, there was a triumphant\r\nrejoinder from the Liberal and Home Rule Benches. Austen Chamberlain,\r\nexcited, nervous, angered, flitted to and fro in the attempt to gather\r\nforces to defend his absent parent. At last Mr. Courtney took up his\r\ncase. There was not very much in what he said, and while he was speaking\r\nMr. Chamberlain entered the House. He was pale, excited, and unnerved.\r\nHe endeavoured to carry the whole thing by a jauntiness which was too\r\neasy to see through. Mr. Courtney had been waving furiously a telegram\r\ntowards the Speaker, and asked that he might have the privilege of\r\nreading it. Austen Chamberlain snatched the telegram from Mr. Courtney,\r\nand gave it to his father just as he had taken his seat. Mr. Chamberlain\r\nhad not a moment to spare; he had just time to glance at the contents of\r\nthe telegram when he rose to speak, and all he did was to read the\r\ntelegram, which was a confirmation by Mr. Duignan of the general\r\naccuracy of the previous evening. This was a score for Joe, and his\r\nfriends were delighted to recover something of their lost spirit.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Conybeare and the Speaker.]\r\n\r\nMr. Conybeare had written a letter to the _Chronicle_ denouncing the\r\nSpeaker. Mr. Tritton, a Tory member, insisted the letter should be read,\r\nand this gave the Speaker one of those few opportunities which his\r\nposition allows him. In disclaiming this charge he showed his great\r\npowers of oratory and the splendid and thrilling notes of his fine\r\nvoice. He defended himself at once from the charge of undue partiality\r\nwith strong passion and deep emotion, which lie hidden beneath his deep\r\nreserve. With a face ghastly almost in its greyness, in its deepening\r\nglows and manifest passion, he repudiated the charge of unfairness; he\r\nvehemently struck his hand on the order paper which he held, and as he\r\nneared to the end of his little speech there was a ring in his voice\r\ndangerously near a sob or a tear. It is on such occasions that Mr.\r\nGladstone's sonorous and splendid diction and delivery come most to the\r\nfront; beginning a little awkwardly, hesitatingly, he warmed as he went\r\nalong, and there came to him the strange power of collecting his\r\nthoughts and measuring his language which long years of Parliamentary\r\ntraining has made a second nature. The House listened--rapt, hushed,\r\nspellbound. And then there was no more to be said beyond a few\r\nperfunctory observations from Mr. Balfour and the dismissal of the whole\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another scene.]\r\n\r\nAnd now we were once more in the thick of a fierce and passionate\r\nencounter. Mr. Arnold Forster had an amendment, the effect of which was\r\nto remove the exercise of the prerogative of mercy from the hands of the\r\nIrish members to those of the English Secretary of State. Into this\r\ninnocent amendment he sought to drag discussion of the doings of the\r\nLand League twelve years ago, and concentrated on Mr. Sexton a violent\r\nattack. He was not allowed to proceed to the end of his chapter. The\r\ncharge was heinous, vile, and such as has rarely been introduced in the\r\nHouse in such a fashion, and soon the temper rose to a fever heat. Mr.\r\nSexton is a dangerous man to tackle in this guise.\r\n\r\nIn justifiable rage, quivering with wrath, he yet managed to preserve\r\nthat cold and even tenour of language so perfect to his heart and his\r\nwords. Again and again the Tory and Unionist party cheer for Mr.\r\nBalfour, Mr. Courtney, and Mr. Chamberlain, but Mr. Sexton is not a man\r\nto suffer such a statement to go unchallenged, and he succeeded in\r\ngrasping the whole thing and stamped the charge with the terms, base\r\nand infamous. This led to other scenes, men rising and talking together.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain turned fierce in fore front. Again and again Mr.\r\nGladstone arose to try and end the scene, and again and again he was\r\nprevented by Mr. T.W. Russell at one point, Mr. Chamberlain at another,\r\nand Mr. Balfour at a third, to seek to bring the struggle back to the\r\nfierce temper it was about to leave. But the Old Man at last got up, and\r\nin measured language and tones which betrayed profound emotion, he\r\nscathingly denounced the attack of Mr. Forster as wanton and\r\nmischievous. Here again there was another uproar. The Old Man pursued\r\nhis way, but Mr. Chamberlain again tried to get Mr. Sexton called to\r\norder, but the charge had been too coarse, and Mr. Mellor declined to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nREDUCED MAJORITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The week before.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, July 7th, we just entered on the fringe of the ninth clause.\r\nThe ninth clause had all along been held to be, perhaps, the very\r\ngravest rock ahead of the Government. This is the clause which regulates\r\nthe position of the Irish members at Westminster after Home Rule has\r\nbeen passed. There were as many plans for settling this question as\r\nthere were members of the House of Commons, and all plans were alike in\r\nbeing illogical, unsymmetrical, and, therefore, liable to attack from a\r\ndozen different quarters. Already within a few days of each other, there\r\nhad been two divisions, on which everybody felt it to be quite possible\r\nthat the Government would go down, and that we should once more go back\r\nface to face with the country and probably with a new and a stronger\r\nTory Government than ever. The first occasion was the clause dealing\r\nwith a Second Chamber. Then a certain number of irreconcilable Radicals,\r\nin their hatred of all Second Chambers, voted against the Government and\r\nreduced their majority to 15. This was a very tight squeeze; but, after\r\nall, everybody had been prepared for it, and when the hour came, we all\r\nknew pretty well where we should be. There might be one or two men more\r\nor less in the Tory lobby, but we had sized them up carefully. When,\r\nhowever, July 19th, and the ninth clause came we were face to face with\r\na very different state of affairs. Then we had to face absolute\r\nuncertainty--and uncertainty not in one, but almost every part of the\r\nHouse. And the curious thing about it all was, that this uncertainty was\r\naggravated by a little fact which had entered into nobody's\r\ncalculations, and this was the highly technical rule with regard to the\r\nmanner in which questions are put when the House is in committee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Technicalities.]\r\n\r\nI despair of ever being able to make this matter clear to an outsider;\r\nand, indeed, to be quite honest, I am not always sure that I understand\r\nthe affair myself. It will probably be sufficient for my purpose if I\r\nsay that the chairman has to put an amendment in such a way that\r\nsometimes you find you are really precluded from voting on the direct\r\nquestion which you wish to challenge. You are within the ring-fence of a\r\ntechnical rule, which compels you to fight your issue there and not one\r\ninch outside of it. This often means that questions are raised in the\r\nmost indirect way--that you seem to be voting for one thing while you\r\nreally mean another, and that if you do not vote that way, you cannot\r\nvote any other. So it happened on this occasion. And we drifted about\r\nfor the best way of raising the question of the presence of the Irish\r\nmembers, and the Government were for a while in a state of absolute and\r\npainful uncertainty. Then came one of those desultory conversations on\r\npoints of order, in which so large a body as the House of Commons cannot\r\nshine--one man suggesting one method, one man another; half-a-dozen\r\ndifferent methods proposed in as many minutes by half-a-dozen different\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 103 v. 80.]\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Redmond seemed to hit off the situation by a proposal to\r\nomit a couple of sub-sections in the ninth clause. But Mr. Redmond had\r\nscarcely spoken when the House found itself in an extraordinary and most\r\nembarrassing dilemma. The object of Mr. Redmond was plain enough; what\r\nhe desired to do was to retain the Irish members in the Imperial\r\nParliament in their present, that is to say, in their full,\r\nstrength--103 they are now, 103 he wanted them to remain. The position\r\nof the Government was equally clear. With emphatic language--with a\r\nsuperabundance of argument--Mr. Gladstone stated his conviction that the\r\nIrish members should not remain in such large numbers and that the\r\nnumber should be 80. This was all clear enough; but what about the\r\nposition of all the other parties in the House?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tot homines, tot sententiæ.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it would appear that this ought to be very clear. The\r\nTories and the Unionists had several amendments on the paper. One wanted\r\nthe Irish members reduced to 48, one wanted to have them reduced to 40,\r\nand several of them desired that they should be reduced still\r\nfurther--in fact, should reach the irreducible minimum of none at all.\r\nIt was assumed, of course, that gentlemen who had thus indicated their\r\ndesire for the reduction of the Irish members, or for their\r\ndisappearance altogether, would vote against a proposition which asked\r\nthat they should remain in full force. If this course were adopted, Mr.\r\nRedmond would be crushed under a combination of the Liberals, who wanted\r\nthe numbers to be 80, and the Tories who wanted the Irish members to\r\ndisappear altogether; but in these days, and with such an Opposition as\r\nwe have now in the House of Commons, it is not possible to make any\r\ncalculations on what course we would adopt. To the amazement of the\r\nHouse--above all things to the amazement of Mr. Gladstone--who has not\r\nyet entirely got over the traditions of the past, and, therefore,\r\nover-sanguine expectations as to the scruples of his opponents--Mr.\r\nChamberlain and Mr. Balfour both announced that they were ready to go\r\ninto the same lobby as Mr. Redmond. And so those who wanted all the\r\nIrish members, and those who wanted none, were both going to vote\r\nexactly the same way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A bolt from the blue.]\r\n\r\nFor a moment everybody was staggered by this declaration; and it\r\nproduced a combination which anybody could forecast, and for which\r\nnobody was prepared. There came accordingly something like a panic over\r\nthe House. Here we were face to face with a Ministerial crisis, with\r\ndoom and the abyss and the end of all things. Unexpectedly, in a moment,\r\nwithout a second's warning, this state of things led to a phenomenon\r\nwhich belongs to the House of Commons alone. Councils of war are usually\r\nheld in the silence and secrecy and beneath the impenetrable walls of\r\nthe council chamber. But sudden councils of war, called for by\r\nunexpected events, have to be held in the open in the House of Commons.\r\nThe world--the world of strangers, of ambassadors, of peers, of ladies,\r\nof the constituents, and, above all, the world of watchful, scornful,\r\nvindictive enemies--can look on as though the leaders of the parties\r\nwere bees working in a glass hive. And it is impossible for even the\r\nbest trained men to keep their air and manners in such dread\r\ncircumstances from betraying the seriousness and excitement and awe\r\nwhich the gravity of the events are exciting in them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone's attitude.]\r\n\r\nOn the Treasury Bench there was a good deal of excitement, but it was\r\npretty well repressed: and in the midst of it all is the face of Mr.\r\nGladstone, over-pale, with a strange glitter in the eyes that made them\r\nlook unnaturally large, two jets of lambent and almost dazzling flame,\r\nbut otherwise very composed, deadly calm. On the Irish Benches the\r\nexcitement was more tense, for their course was even more difficult than\r\nthat of the Government. The Government had stated their decision that\r\nthey wanted only eighty members. But there was an Irish member, a leader\r\nof a party which seeks to claim Irish support as a better Irish party\r\nthan the other, proposing that Ireland should have her full total of\r\nmembers. The Irish members naturally would be inclined to support their\r\ncountrymen, if not to seek to keep the Irish representation as high as\r\nit could possibly be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A splendid gambler.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if all the Irish members went the same way it was all\r\nup with the Government. Some fifty to seventy British Liberals adopt the\r\nsame policy as the Irish members with regard to the Irish question and\r\nthe Home Rule Bill, and if the Irish members only give the word, they\r\nalso would vote with Mr. Redmond, and the Government would be \"snowed\r\nunder,\" to use an expressive Americanism, a majority of upwards of two\r\nhundred against them. Mr. Gladstone had evidently made up his mind that\r\nthis was the situation he would have to face, and played his last, his\r\nsupreme, his desperate card. You could see that he himself felt that\r\nthis was the kind of card he was playing from his look as he played it.\r\nThere was outward calmness in the face, there was the same evenness of\r\ntone in the voice; he built up his case with the same unbroken command\r\nof his language and ideas as is his usual characteristic. His statement\r\nof his position was admirable in its lucidity, its temper, and its\r\ncourage. But he was excited. Just as he rose up, Sir William Harcourt\r\njumped up, and in a state of impatience and excitement that was\r\npalpable, asked for something. It was a glass of water for Mr.\r\nGladstone. The glass of water was brought in; it was put in front of Mr.\r\nGladstone; he sipped it just as he was about to start on his perilous\r\noratorical voyage, and then, clearing his throat, he made the fateful\r\nannouncement which possibly was to wreck his measure and himself. And\r\nthe statement came to this: If the Government were defeated, it would be\r\nby a combination of different parties, but they would all agree in\r\nsupporting 103 as against 80 Irish members; and if they did that, why\r\nthe House was master. This was ambiguous, and yet it was pretty plain.\r\nThe Government declined to accept as a vote of want of confidence in\r\nthem a majority which was obtained by so dishonest and treacherous a\r\ncombination as men voting together who were at such opposite poles of\r\nthought; and the Government would just checkmate the little game by\r\naccepting the 103 members as what the House preferred to the Government\r\nplan of 80.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of the flag.]\r\n\r\nThere was a gleam of almost sardonic triumph in the Old Man's eye as he\r\nsat down, having shot this bolt; and he looked as if he had thoroughly\r\ndiscomfited his enemies. But his enemies were not so easily discomfited.\r\nTreacherous, base, unscrupulous, call it what he liked, they were not\r\ngoing to miss the opportunity of baiting him: and Mr. Chamberlain's pale\r\nface wore a deadlier pallor. There was even a colder and fiercer ring\r\nthan usual in his clear, cruel voice; his always saturnine look deepened\r\nas he seemed to grasp beforehand his great and long delayed hour of\r\nvengeance. Mr. Balfour adopted the same tactics. In favour of 103\r\nmembers? Not at all--the vote would mean nothing of that kind--it would\r\nsimply mean that they were opposed to the plan of the Government; in\r\nshort, there was the issue quite plain. The Tories and the Unionists\r\nwould vote black was white, wrong was right. This way one moment, the\r\nother way the next--they would do anything, provided only they could\r\nturn the Government out, defeat the Bill, and humiliate the Old Man. And\r\nso the situation grew more difficult every moment.\r\n\r\nFor it was now plain that the Government were most certain to be beaten,\r\nand that if they were beaten, there must be an end of Home Rule. It\r\nmight be good Parliamentary tactics to say that the Government would\r\naccept the decision of the House, but everybody knows what moral\r\nauthority, what reality of strength, there is in a Government which has\r\nbeen \"snowed under\" by a majority of 200.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton makes the running.]\r\n\r\nIt will now be understood what tremendous issues rested on the speech\r\nwhich Mr. Sexton rose to deliver. In moments of stress and difficulty he\r\nis the man always selected by his colleagues to state the Irish case.\r\nNever in his chequered and stormy early career did that wonderful\r\nParliamentarian have a task more difficult than that by which he was\r\nnow confronted. In front of him was the Government in the very panic of\r\nimpending ruin. He had only to look across the floor of the House, and\r\nhe could see the pallid face of that mighty statesman who lives so high\r\nin the hearts and affections of the people whom Mr. Sexton represents,\r\nand who at that moment was in his hour of agony, if not of final and\r\nirretrievable ruin. Behind the Prime Minister were other men--equally\r\neager to hear what he had to say--that sturdy band of Radicals, mostly\r\nfrom Scotland, who only wanted the word to desert their own leader and\r\nfollow the guidance of the Irish members. And behind Mr. Sexton was the\r\ngrimmest enemy of all--the men from his own country, who were resolved,\r\non this occasion, to push the demand of Ireland to the extreme point,\r\nand who held that he would betray the Irish cause if he backed, not\r\nthem, but Mr. Gladstone and the British Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And takes the lead.]\r\n\r\nIt required all the dexterity, all the coolness, all the splendid\r\nequanimity and courage of the man of genius at such a fateful hour to\r\nkeep his head. Mr. Sexton was equal to the occasion. He spoke slowly,\r\nand there was a hush in the House to catch his every syllable, for his\r\nwords were the harbingers of fate. As he spoke so would be decided one\r\nof the most momentous and indeed tragical of human issues. He spoke, I\r\nsay, slowly--but at the same time it was evident that he had his mind\r\nwell fixed on the end which he wished to reach. Nothing adds so much to\r\nthe effectiveness of oratory as the sense that the man who is addressing\r\nyou, is thinking at the very moment he is speaking. You have the sense\r\nof watching the visible working of his inner mind; and you are far more\r\ndeeply impressed than by the glib facility which does not pause, does\r\nnot stumble, does not hesitate, because he does not stop to think. Many\r\npeople, reading so much about Mr. Sexton's oratory, will be under the\r\nimpression that he is a very rapid and fluent speaker. He is nothing of\r\nthe kind. He speaks with a great slowness, grave deliberation, and there\r\nare often long and sometimes even trying pauses between his sentences.\r\nHe could not conceal on this great occasion the anxiety and the\r\nseriousness of the situation; but the mind was splendidly clear, the\r\nlanguage as well chosen as though he were sitting in a room and holding\r\ndiscourse to a few admiring friends; and what Mr. Sexton had to say was,\r\nthat he would not go into the same lobby with Chamberlain and Balfour in\r\norder to defeat the Government; in short, that he was going to vote with\r\nMr. Gladstone. A long-drawn sigh of relief. The Government is saved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The field unsteady.]\r\n\r\nBut hush--not yet. There are still some of the hard Radicals from\r\nScotland who have never wavered in the idea that the Irish members ought\r\nto remain at their full total. They have been partially relieved by what\r\nMr. Sexton had said. But then Scotchmen are proverbially tenacious of\r\nopinion; and not even his appeal--joined to the appeal of their\r\nleader--will altogether change the purpose of those rugged sons of\r\nbonnie Scotland. And so, Mr. Shaw, the member for Galashiels, gets up to\r\nask a question. He plainly declares that according to the answer given\r\nto this question, his vote would be given for or against the Government.\r\nSo we are still in all the agonies of possible delay, for we know that\r\nseven Parnellites will go against the Government--that counts fourteen\r\non a division; and if only seven or ten more go the same way, there is a\r\nmajority against Mr. Gladstone, and we are lost. Mr. Mellor has to\r\nanswer this fateful question, and everybody cries \"Order, order,\" which\r\nis the House of Commons way of saying that people are very anxious to\r\nhear what is about to be said. Mr. Mellor gives an answer that satisfies\r\nMr. Shaw. Mr. Dalziel--another sturdy Scotch Radical--is also satisfied;\r\nand so we have all the Liberal vote, with the single exception of\r\nLabby--who quickly--furtively--almost shamefacedly--rushes off into the\r\nTory lobby.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hoisting the numbers.]\r\n\r\nAnd now the division takes place. There have been several\r\nspeeches--usually of a minute each--before the final hour comes; but we\r\nare all so anxious to know what fate is in store for us, that we cannot\r\nstand the strain any longer. The division--the division--let us know the\r\nworst. Be it good, or be it ill--let it come at once. The Whips from the\r\ntwo lobbies enter almost simultaneously--this shows plainly enough that\r\nit has been a very near thing; then a dreadful hush as the numbers are\r\nannounced; we have won--aye, but we have by only fourteen! There is a\r\nburst of cheers from the Irish Benches; Sir William Harcourt laughs\r\naloud in his triumph; the composure of the Old Man's face remains\r\nunchanged; you see he has gone through a great many things like this;\r\nand that great heart and sane mind are prepared for any fate. Mr.\r\nChamberlain says nothing; but looking into the recesses of his amendment\r\npaper, attempts to hide the choking rage of disappointment that has come\r\nover him at this final defeat of his brightest hopes of trampling his\r\nformer friend and his former chief in the dust.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A squabble.]\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the squalid sequel to all this glorious and splendid\r\nfight--the disorderly--the chaotic--the anarchic scene of the 11th of\r\nJuly. The whole thing began simply enough. Mr. Brodrick, the son of an\r\nIrish landlord--a very light, though very serious young man--managed in\r\nthe course of his speech to speak of the people from whom he springs as\r\n\"impecunious and garrulous.\" At first nobody took any notice of what was\r\nprobably a mere mauvaise plaisanterie; and the incident would have\r\npassed altogether had not Mr. Brodrick immediately afterwards made a\r\nmore direct appeal to the Irish Members. This elicited from Mr. Sexton\r\nthe retort that he need not make any appeal to the Irish Benches after\r\nthe \"grossly rude\" allusion he had made to the Irish people. On this\r\nthere was a mild hubbub on the Tory Benches. The House was very thin and\r\nvery listless, and really not in the mood to take anything very\r\ntragically. But Mr. Sexton resolutely refused to withdraw unless Mr.\r\nBrodrick gave the example. Mr. Mellor then--acting somewhat\r\nprecipitately--ruled that Mr. Sexton was out of order, and should\r\nwithdraw his words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton defies the chair.]\r\n\r\nThis created a new situation. Mr. Sexton had now to fight, not Mr.\r\nBrodrick, not even Mr. Balfour--but the chair; and to fight the chair is\r\nto enter into a contest with the Grand Llama of the House of Commons.\r\nMeantime the House had filled; and every nook and cranny was occupied; a\r\nlarge number of members were standing up; and there was that intense\r\nthrill of excitement which always forecasts a great outburst, and the\r\noutburst came when Mr. Sexton--resolute and composed--gave it plainly to\r\nbe understood that he would not obey the ruling of the chair; and that\r\nhe must first get an apology from Mr. Brodrick, as the original\r\noffender, before Mr. Brodrick got any apology from him. Then was the\r\ncyclone let loose; and there began a series of the wildest, most\r\nviolent, most angry, and disorderly scenes I have ever witnessed. Scores\r\nof members were on their legs at the same time; men hitherto quiet,\r\ncomposed, and good-natured, began to raise cries hoarse with rage, and\r\nfinally four or five hundred voices were united in producing the\r\ndeafening and discordant din of angry and contradictory voices. Nor was\r\nthis all. In some parts of the House men began directly to assail each\r\nother--to exchange language of taunt, and insult, and defiance; and, in\r\nmore than one corner, there were the signs of impending physical\r\nconflict. The one relief of the situation was that some men kept their\r\nheads and looked on in sadness, while others, seeing only the comic side\r\nof the situation, smiled upon it all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gladstone to the rescue.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, who had been away to dinner, had meantime entered, and a\r\nlook of pain and solicitude crossed his white face. There is so much of\r\ninnate gentleness--of inexhaustible kindliness, and of high-bred and\r\nscholastic spirit beneath all the vehemence of his political temper and\r\nthe frenzied energy of his political life--that for such scenes he has\r\nnever any stomach; and they always bring to his face that same look of\r\nshock and pain and humiliation. And he it was who finally saved the\r\nsituation. Several times Mr. Brodrick would have been willing to\r\nwithdraw, but Mr. Balfour was resolved to get Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\nSexton into a difficulty, to convict Mr. Sexton of disobeying the chair,\r\nto compel Mr. Gladstone to take action against his most useful friend\r\nand most powerful ally. Over and over again, then, he refused to allow\r\nMr. Brodrick to get rid of the whole situation by withdrawing his\r\nlanguage, and so enabling Mr. Sexton to follow the example. Meantime,\r\nMr. Mellor had ruled that Mr. Sexton had been guilty of gross disorder,\r\nand had called upon him to leave the House. Mr. Sexton had steadily\r\nrefused, basing his refusal on the demand that there had been no vote of\r\nthe House. The point was this: There are two rules for dealing with\r\ndisorder. Under the one a member is named, and then a division takes\r\nplace, in which the House may refuse or consent to the suspension of a\r\nmember. Under the other rule, the presiding officer has the right to\r\nsuspend on his own motion, and without any appeal to the House. The\r\nlatter rule was that under which Mr. Mellor acted. Mr. Sexton demanded\r\nthat he should be treated under the other rule, believing that if a\r\ndivision had taken place the majority of the House, or at least a very\r\nbig minority, would have refused to sanction the action of the Chairman.\r\nThis would have meant that Mr. Mellor would have been censured, and\r\nthereby compelled to resign the Chairmanship.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, I say, saved the situation. In language of touching\r\ndelicacy and grace, he appealed to Mr. Sexton to obey the chair. Mr.\r\nSexton at first would not yield; but when the appeal was renewed--when\r\nit was backed by all the resources of that thrilling and vibratory voice\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, his stubborn resolve gave way. He rose from his\r\nseat--several Liberal members got up and waved their hats; the Irishmen\r\nfollowed their example. And then Mr. Brodrick was able to make his\r\ntardy apology, and the matter for the moment was ended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The interfering Milman.]\r\n\r\nThere had been one little scene fiercer almost than any of the others.\r\nWhen Mr. Mellor proceeded to call Mr. Sexton to order, Mr. Milman, the\r\nclerk at the table, handed to him, with some appearance of ostentation\r\nand of eagerness, the rule which allowed him to compel Mr. Sexton's\r\nwithdrawal without an appeal to the House. This provoked some now\r\nfiercely excited Irishmen to an outburst of blind rage. They shouted at\r\nMr. Milman fiercely, desperately--called upon him to leave the Chairman\r\nalone, to take the chair himself; and Mr. Sexton made a bitter little\r\nspeech to the effect that it was Mr. Milman's malignant interference\r\nwhich had produced his suspension. It was thought that on Wednesday this\r\nmatter would be again raised; and even as early as noon there was a big\r\narray of members, expecting another outburst. But Mr. Balfour held his\r\npeace. Mr. Sexton asked a formal question, and gave notice of a motion\r\nof censure on the Chairman. Mr. Mellor took the chair amid a wild\r\noutburst of Tory cheers; and we got back to the tranquil consideration\r\nof clause nine, and to a delightful, good-humoured historical speech by\r\nMr. Swift McNeill on the representation of Trinity College, Dublin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divisions.]\r\n\r\nThe old story came back to our minds on July 13th of the historic scene\r\nat Tyburn when all the traitors were hanged in succession. When the\r\nfirst head was held up there was an awful shudder; the shudder was less\r\nvivid when the second head was held up; and when the executioner\r\naccidentally dropped the third there was a loud and mocking shout of\r\n\"Butter-fingers.\" So it was in the House that night until the dinner\r\nhour came; but as ten o'clock approached, the House filled and there was\r\na rise in the excitement. The scene, however, bore no comparison to the\r\nfrenzied excitement of the preceding Thursday--it was evident we were\r\ngoing to have an anti-climax, and the whole arrangement of the\r\nOpposition broke down in an important and essential point. On the\r\nprevious occasion Mr. Balfour, by preconcerted plan, was speaking at the\r\nmoment when the guillotine fell--with the idea, of course, of bringing\r\ninto greater relief the wickedness of the Government. Mr. Goschen was\r\nmarked out to perform the same task this Thursday, but who should get up\r\nbut Atherley Jones. The delighted Liberals cheered him to the echo. Mr.\r\nGoschen had to sit down, and so the whole dénouement collapsed, and the\r\ncurtain fell not on the lofty and eminent form of a former Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, but on the less imposing figure of the disgruntled\r\nLiberal, who is always anxious to strike his party a blow.\r\n\r\nThen comes the division. There is some excitement, though we know we\r\nhave won. And then we cheer, as we hear that we have won by 27! Clause 9\r\nis now put as a whole. Our majority rises to 29--we cheer even more\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.]\r\n\r\nWe go through the lobbies in eight more successive divisions. It is the\r\ndreariest performance. \"That Clause so-and-so stand part of the Bill,\"\r\nsays the Chairman. A shout of \"Ayes!\" followed by a shout of\r\n\"Noes!\"--then a cry of \"Division!\"--then the same thing over again--and\r\nagain--and again. We stand at 85 majority in nearly every division. But\r\nwe don't cheer, for it is too monotonous; and as for the poor\r\nTories--where be the wild shouts of \"Gag, gag!\" with which they rent the\r\ngeneral air--their hoarse cries of \"Shame, shame\"--their open and foul\r\ntaunts in the face of the G.O.M.? Silent--sombre--dogged--we go through\r\nthe dreary round. Tout casse--tout passe--tout lasse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fatal Thursday.]\r\n\r\nBy this time everybody has read to his heart's content all the\r\nproceedings of that historic and dreadful Thursday night. I have already\r\npublished elsewhere an account of my experiences; and within my limits\r\nhere I must somewhat curtail the story. But it is well to correct some\r\nof the many errors which have found their way into the press. In the\r\nslight reaction which has followed the first wild outburst, it is now\r\nseen that there were certain exaggerations in the accounts. For\r\ninstance, though there was an exchange of blows, altogether not more\r\nthan five people were concerned in this most odious part of the whole\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Herod--Judas.]\r\n\r\nThe row began in a curious kind of way; and, indeed, to properly\r\nunderstand the events of the night, it is necessary to make a perfectly\r\ncomplete separation between two distinct periods. The fall of the\r\nguillotine is always certain to be accompanied by a scene of some\r\nexcitement and violence. The violence has been diminishing steadily, as\r\nthe different compartments have succeeded each other; and though there\r\nwere some ugly rumours, the general expectation was that things would\r\nnot be so very bad. And, indeed, without any desire to make party or\r\npersonal capital, I may state that undoubtedly they would not have been\r\nso bad if Mr. Chamberlain had not intervened at the last moment. Opinion\r\nis unanimous that up to the time he spoke the feeling in the House was,\r\nthough boisterous, rather good humoured. There was a conflict of\r\nopinion, there were some shouts, there was that general din in the air\r\nwhich always marks the inspiration of a momentous event, but there was\r\nno ill-temper. In a few moments Mr. Chamberlain had, to a certain\r\nextent, changed this; but even as to the period when he was speaking, I\r\nfeel bound to correct the general impression and to say that my own\r\nopinion was that the general spirit was one of frolicksome enjoyment\r\nrather than of the seriousness of real passion. Mr. Chamberlain himself,\r\nto do him justice--though he had elaborated a series of the most\r\ntaunting observations, though sentence after sentence was intended to be\r\nan assault and a barbed taunt--Mr. Chamberlain, I say, seemed himself to\r\nregard the whole affair rather from a comic than a tragic point of view.\r\nUnder the bitterness of his language, the tone was not that of\r\nseriousness--and, indeed, it is very hard for any man to be perfectly\r\nserious when he knows that he is speaking for a certain number of\r\nallotted minutes, and instead of addressing himself to the particular\r\nquestion before the House, he has to make something in the shape of a\r\nlast dying speech and declaration. The speech, however, was admirable in\r\nform, and still more admirable in delivery; the cold, clear voice\r\npenetrated to every ear, and some of the sentences were uttered with\r\nthat deep, though carefully subdued swell which adds intense force by\r\nits very reserve, to the rhetoric of passion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe's beautiful elocution.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, if I were a professor of elocution, I should feel bound to say\r\nthat if a pupil required a lesson in the highest art of delivery, he\r\ncould do nothing better than listen to Mr. Chamberlain's delivery of\r\nthis bitter little speech of his; and, above all, that he could nowhere\r\nand in nowise better learn the lesson of the extraordinary increase\r\nthere is in the force of a speech by careful self-suppression on the\r\npart of the speaker. There were one or two marvellous examples of Mr.\r\nChamberlain's extraordinary readiness in taking a point. I think Mr.\r\nChamberlain an extremely shallow man. I believe his knowledge to be\r\nslatternly, his judgment to be rash, his temper to be dictatorial and\r\nuncertain, but as a debater he stands, in readiness, alertness, and\r\nquickness in taking and utilising a point, supreme over anybody in the\r\nHouse of Commons, with the one exception of Mr. Gladstone. Thus when one\r\nor two Liberals made somewhat foolish interruptions on July 27th he\r\nturned upon them and exploited their interruption with an art that was\r\nalmost dazzling in its perfection. For instance, when he denounced the\r\nLiberals for accepting some clause as the best that could be proposed by\r\nman, some Liberals cried out, \"Under the circumstances.\" \"Under the\r\ncircumstances,\" said Mr. Chamberlain, with that strange, eloquent, deep\r\nswell in his voice, which adds so much to its effectiveness, and then he\r\ntook the phrase, repeated it, and reiterated it, and turned it upside\r\ndown, until even his bitterest enemy could not help enjoying the\r\nperfection of the skill with which he played upon it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe smiles.]\r\n\r\nFinally he came to the passage in which he drew an elaborate comparison\r\nbetween Mr. Gladstone and Herod. I had no doubt at the time, and my\r\nimpression has since been corroborated by words reported to have been\r\nused by Mr. Chamberlain himself--that he used the word \"Herod\" in a\r\nmoment of happy and almost impish inspiration with a view to provoking\r\nthe retort which was so obvious. There was a self-conscious smile on his\r\nface when he uttered the words, and he seemed to be quite prepared, and\r\nalmost delighted by the retort which followed so promptly. Furthermore,\r\nwhen several Tories rose to denounce the interruption he beckoned to\r\nthem with his hand; there was a gratified smile on his face; and his\r\nwhole air suggested that he was so delighted with the success of his\r\nlittle manoeuvre that he thought it a pity anybody should spoil it; and\r\nespecially as the result was to create such a din as to prevent him from\r\nfinishing his final sentence. And he wanted very badly to finish that\r\nsentence; for over and over again, with an obstinacy that suggested the\r\ndelighted author, he sought to get the sentence out; and no doubt he was\r\nvery disappointed that the guillotine finally fell upon him with that\r\nsentence still unuttered. And there is one other point about this moment\r\nwhich I see has been completely lost. It is supposed that I and the\r\nothers who shouted \"Judas, Judas,\" did so in pure provocation--with\r\ndeliberate intent to apply the word to Mr. Chamberlain personally and\r\nwith fierce political and personal passion. That was not my impression\r\nof what was meant; and that certainly was not what I meant. I took Mr.\r\nChamberlain's mood as I think anybody looking at him could see that he\r\nmeant it to be taken; that is to say, I did not regard his speech as in\r\nthe least serious; and his allusion to Mr. Gladstone as \"Herod\" appeared\r\nto me a self-conscious joke, and not, as some earnest Liberals seemed to\r\nthink, a gross, foul, and deliberate insult. Indeed, I believed--and\r\nsubsequent events have confirmed that view--that Joe was thinking a good\r\ndeal more of himself as the centre of a dramatic and historic scene than\r\nof wounding Mr. Gladstone. And, then, the use of the word \"Judas\" must\r\nbe taken with the context. Mr. Chamberlain was talking of the \"days of\r\nHerod,\" and when I called out \"Judas,\" what I really meant was why not\r\nselect Judas, and not Herod, who was his contemporary, if you will refer\r\nto this particular epoch of human history. I say all these things, not\r\nby way of extenuation; for really I regard the incident as closed; not\r\nby way of defending myself from rancour, for I felt none; but with a\r\nview to preventing an entirely incorrect view and impression of an\r\nhistorical evening from being stereotyped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"I used it on purpose.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd I can call a very potent and trustworthy witness as to this being\r\nthe proper view of the incident; for I understand that, almost\r\nimmediately after the scene, a good-natured Liberal said to Mr.\r\nChamberlain that he must confess that the use of the word \"Herod\" was\r\ncalculated to produce the retort of \"Judas\"; and the report is that Mr.\r\nChamberlain replied, \"I used it on purpose,\" or \"That was my intention,\"\r\nor some such phrase as that, which implied that he was neither surprised\r\nnor annoyed by the retort, but had rather invited it. I lost sight of\r\nJoe for a good time after this--there were other things which had to be\r\nlooked after; but I am told by those who were able to watch him closely,\r\nthat his face wore all through the scene which followed a look of almost\r\nbeatific happiness--the happiness of an artist who saw slowly unfolding\r\nthe drama to which he had given the impetus, and which he had fashioned\r\nout in his own reveries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opening of the row.]\r\n\r\nAt all events, it was not either Mr. Chamberlain's use of the word\r\n\"Herod,\" nor my use of the word \"Judas,\" which really brought about the\r\nsubsequent row--except in the most indirect and remote way. Mr. Vicary\r\nGibbs seemed possessed by the idea that he should call the attention of\r\nthe Chairman to the use of the word \"Judas\"; and he singled me\r\nout--although, of course, he knew that I was only one of many who had\r\nused the word. I don't complain of this--I merely state a fact--a fact\r\nwhich, laughingly, was admitted later in the evening; for here I may say\r\nin passing that such is the extraordinary volatility and such the real\r\ngood-nature of the House of Commons, this terrible evening ended up in\r\nthe exchange of hearty and friendly jokes between some of the fiercest\r\ncombatants in the whole business. I had not the least idea of what Mr.\r\nGibbs was saying--what his complaint really was I knew for the first\r\ntime after the whole row was over; indeed, nobody could hear anything in\r\nthe din that was almost deafening. Mr. Mellor made several attempts to\r\ncatch Mr. Gibbs's statement; and only when, after straining his ears to\r\nthe utmost, he failed to catch one single word, did Mr. Mellor resolve\r\nto take no notice of what Mr. Gibbs was trying to say. This seemed to\r\ndrive Mr. Gibbs almost beside himself--he shouted angrily and wildly,\r\nat the top of his voice, with fierce and almost frenzied gesture; and,\r\nafter a while, he rushed down with every appearance of passion to the\r\nFront Opposition Bench to renew his attempts to make his point of order.\r\nAll this time his passion had been rising higher and higher--until, in\r\nthe end, he was almost a painful sight to witness. His own friends were\r\nforemost in trying to bring him back to composure; and Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill expressed, with the fine, full-flavoured plainness of ancient\r\nspeech, his opinion of the conduct of his friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keeping the seats.]\r\n\r\nThis plain-spoken opinion of Lord Randolph Churchill was induced by the\r\nfact that Mr. Gibbs and his friends had now resolved on a desperate step\r\nto secure attention to his complaint. This was no other than refusing to\r\nleave the House, and take part in the division. It is more than twelve\r\nyears since this extreme, violent, and almost revolutionary step was\r\nadopted before. On the dreadful night--how well I remember it!--when the\r\nnews came that Michael Davitt had been sent back to penal servitude, the\r\ninformation sent a thrill of such horror and almost despair amongst the\r\nIrish Benches, that some method of manifesting their feelings became\r\ninevitable. By a series of circumstances, into which I need not now go,\r\nthe manifestation took the shape of refusing to go into the division\r\nlobby, and retaining our seats. We were all suspended in turn, and\r\nremoved from the House by the Serjeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Logan.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the unexpected and extraordinary delay in taking the division\r\nhad brought back some members from the division lobbies; and some had\r\nactually recorded their votes, and were returning in the ordinary course\r\nto their seats. Among these was Mr. Logan. Mr. Logan peered somewhat\r\ncuriously at the angry faces and the shouting figures on the Tory\r\nBenches, and approached them with the view of finding out what it was\r\nall about. His air, somehow or other, suggested--quite wrongly, as it\r\nturned out--to the Tories that he was meditating an assault upon some of\r\nthem: and there rose angry cries from them of \"Bar! Bar!\" This, in\r\nParliamentary language, means that the member is violating the rule\r\nagainst any member standing on the floor of the House, except in the\r\nnarrow and short interspace which lies between the entrance door and the\r\nbar--a very small bit of free territory. Logan, in his turn, was\r\nexasperated by these remarks, and used some retort. Then there were\r\nrenewed cries that he was not in order in standing up on the floor,\r\ntogether with a multitude of expletives at the expense of his party and\r\nhimself. And Mr. Logan thereupon said he would put himself in order, and\r\nsat down on the Front Opposition Bench. In doing so, he certainly did\r\nput himself in order, for a member can take his seat where he likes\r\nduring the progress of a division. But this step is what led to the\r\nviolent and unprecedented scene which followed. For Mr. Hayes Fisher\r\nimmediately caught hold of Mr. Logan by the collar, Ashmead Bartlett, I\r\nunderstand, followed suit, and thus the first blow was struck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonel Saunderson hits out.]\r\n\r\nIt was partly curiosity--it was partly, I have no doubt, indignation--it\r\nwas partly the determination to rush to the assistance of a friend--that\r\nled to the moving of the Irishmen from their own seats to the benches\r\nabove the gangway, which are occupied by their political opponents. In\r\nmaking this move they had no intention whatsoever, I believe, of\r\nstriking or even hustling anybody, but the result of it was that Colonel\r\nSaunderson was violently pushed and his hat knocked off. I really\r\nbelieve that the person next him, who gave him the final push, must have\r\nbeen one of his own friends; but angry, excited, and hot-tempered, he\r\njumped to his feet. Mr. Austin, an Irish member, was at that moment\r\nstanding in the gangway, as innocent of offence as anybody in the House,\r\nand he it was who received the blow from Colonel Saunderson's clenched\r\nfist. Mr. Austin fell, and immediately Mr. Crean rushed forward, and in\r\nquick succession gave Colonel Saunderson two hard and resounding\r\nblows--one of which drew blood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bursting of the cyclone.]\r\n\r\nThen the cyclone burst. When the sound of blows was heard; when Colonel\r\nSaunderson was seen to be in grips with another member,\r\nanger--shame--horror, took possession of everybody; some men lost their\r\nheads, determined to have their share in the fray, and for a brief\r\nsecond or two a solid cohort on either side--the Tories on one side, the\r\nIrish on the other--stared and glared at each other, with pallid,\r\npassion-rent, and, at the same time, horror-stricken faces--ready to\r\ndescend into the abyss, and yet standing in the full consciousness of\r\nhorror at its brink. William O'Brien, John Burns, Mr. Bowles, Mr. Healy,\r\nTom Condon, a stalwart and brave Tipperary man ready for peace, ready\r\nfor war, and several others--myself included--rushed to separate and\r\nremonstrate, with the result that the scene came to an end in a space\r\nwhich was extraordinarily short, considering the circumstances, but\r\nterribly long to those who lived through its horror. Really only three\r\npeople were in that scrimmage--Mr. Austin, Colonel Saunderson and Mr.\r\nCrean. There was, I believe, some hustling, but of even that I saw\r\nlittle. Whether it was at this moment, or when Mr. Hayes Fisher laid\r\nhands on Mr. Logan, the hissing came from the gallery, I do not know;\r\nbut it was at either of these two moments--a sound hideous,\r\nunparalleled, sufficient to bring the maddest man back to reason. And\r\nthen, thinking once more that it was all over, we went into the division\r\nlobbies again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Speaker appears.]\r\n\r\nIn common with most people, I had by this time forgotten all about Mr.\r\nChamberlain--all about Herod--all about Judas; thinking the whole affair\r\nwas over and done with; that the incident had been submerged under the\r\nrow; and all I expected we had now to do was to trudge drearily and\r\nwearily through the lobbies in the long series of divisions which would\r\nprecede the final passage of the Bill through Committee. It was only\r\nthe wild cheering which announced the advent of the Speaker that brought\r\nme back to the House, and gave me some idea of what had gone on. If you\r\nwant to understand why France welcomed Napoleon after the Terror, you\r\nhad only to be in the House at that moment, and understand the sense of\r\nrelief, joy, and confidence which came over it when the presence of the\r\nSpeaker brought it to the sense that at last the reign of Anarchy was\r\nover, and order was in the hands of one who could maintain it against\r\nall men, and against the whole House if needs be. And then, to my\r\nastonishment, Mr. Gibbs complained of my use of the term \"Judas\" to Mr.\r\nChamberlain. As I have said, all this had passed from everybody's\r\nmemory, it really had nothing to do with the awful scene which had just\r\nbeen enacted, and, in fact, it was like some sudden return to ancient\r\nand forgotten history. Moreover, it had the disadvantage of conveying an\r\nentirely wrong impression of what had really taken place; it shifted\r\nback the attention to what was after all more or less playfulness, or at\r\nthe worst, mere verbal disorder, from the odious, brutal resort to\r\nphysical violence which had just taken place. Moreover, it put a wrong\r\ncomplexion on even the verbal disorder, for it put the initiative with\r\nme instead of with Mr. Chamberlain, and, finally, it entirely removed\r\nfrom view the gross and scandalous breach of order which Mr. Gibbs and\r\nhis friends had committed by retaining their seats and refusing to leave\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My apology.]\r\n\r\nBut the great consideration with the Speaker--and, indeed, with\r\neverybody else who had the dignity and honour of the House of Commons at\r\nheart--was to shove underground as soon, as promptly, as roughly as\r\npossible, the corpse of its dignity and reputation; and without making\r\nany attempt to explain my conduct--to shift on the responsibility to\r\nwhere it really lay--to draw attention, except by a mere sentence, to\r\nthat scene of physical violence--I made my apology. I cannot claim that\r\nit was all that I ought to have said; several people have blamed me for\r\nnot calling attention to the use of the word \"Herod\" by Mr. Chamberlain.\r\nBut really the Speaker was so generous; I entered so fully into his idea\r\nthat recrimination would only prolong an odious, detestable, and\r\ndegrading scene--that I could not haggle about terms; and was determined\r\nto do my part towards getting back the House to a sense of its honour,\r\ndignity, and self-respect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Hayes Fisher.]\r\n\r\nThere were some allusions to the deplorable business of July 27, during\r\nthe following week. But the allusions were few--very brief, and very\r\nshamefaced. Indeed, the House of Commons was so heartily ashamed of\r\nitself that it had not the strength nor the courage to face its own\r\nill-doing, and wanted to get away from the horrid thing as soon as it\r\npossibly could. Yet there was a strong sense that an incident so\r\nunprecedented--so disgraceful, so utterly lowering to the dignity of a\r\ngreat, august and historic assembly--should not, and could not be\r\nallowed to pass as though nothing had occurred. It was also pretty\r\nclear, amid so many conflicting statements, that the responsibility for\r\nthe passing over the gulf between mere verbal encounter and physical\r\nviolence rested with Mr. Hayes Fisher, and that, therefore, it was on\r\nhim any punishment should be visited which the House of Commons deemed\r\nnecessary for the protection of its outraged dignity. However, as I have\r\nsaid, the House of Commons was so heartily ashamed of itself, and\r\ndesired to get its shame out of sight and out of memory as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A lame apology.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hayes Fisher did not act particularly well. It was he who had\r\ntaken Mr. Logan by the collar, and therefore, it was he who had struck\r\nthe first blow. There was some execrable haggling as to whether Mr.\r\nHayes Fisher or Mr. Logan should make the first apology--execrable, I\r\nsay, because a gentleman never ought to haggle over an apology if he\r\nfeels that he has been in the wrong, and because nobody could deny that\r\nMr. Fisher had been the original wrongdoer. The result was that when\r\nMr. Gladstone came into the House on July 31st, and was asked questions\r\nabout the business, the Old Man, for once, found himself in a\r\ndifficulty. He had been told that apologies were going to be made; but\r\nMr. Fisher made no sign, and, indeed, it looked very much as if he would\r\ndo nothing at all. Labby intervened at this psychological moment by\r\nreading that extract from the account in the _Pall Mall Gazette_ which\r\nfixed Mr. Fisher's responsibility under his own hand, and it was seen\r\nthat something would have to be done. Then--and not till then--did Mr.\r\nFisher speak and make his apology. Mr. Logan--who had very properly\r\nrefused to take the initiative--then made a very brief but a very\r\nhandsome explanation of what he had done, and after a few lofty words\r\nfrom Mr. Gladstone and the Speaker the matter was allowed to drop into\r\nthe dark abyss of oblivion. But we can't forget it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Messrs. McCorquodale & Co.]\r\n\r\nOn August 3rd there was a most instructive and important little debate\r\non a Labour question. It had reference to the dismissal by the firm of\r\nthe McCorquodales of several trade unionists. Suffice it to say, that\r\nthe chief opposition to the claims of Labour came from Sir James\r\nFergusson, whose remarks were ardently cheered by the Tories; and that\r\nSir John Hibbert was finally pressed by Sir Charles Dilke into a promise\r\nwhich binds the Government practically to refuse contracts in future to\r\nany firm which acts like the McCorquodales. It was a great victory for\r\nLabour--not the less great because it was all so quietly done.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Government defeat.]\r\n\r\nThere was a curious little incident on the following day--nothing less\r\nthan a defeat of the Government. It arose on a small local Irish Bill.\r\nBlackrock is a small seaside place just outside Dublin. The Tories, who\r\noccupy a good many of the villas, have kept the whole government of the\r\nplace in their hands by maintaining a high property qualification for\r\nvotes for the Town Commissioners. On this day they brought forward a\r\nBill; but it was opposed until they had mended their ways with regard to\r\nthe government of the town. Mr. Morley, acting on the official view,\r\nurged that the Bill might be passed and this other question dealt with\r\nseparately, but the Irish refused to be pacified, they went to a\r\ndivision, and with the aid of the Radicals they managed to defeat the\r\nGovernment by nine votes. They celebrated the event by a hearty cheer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And so to the end.]\r\n\r\nThe penultimate week in August went on--wearily, tamely, and\r\nmonotonously. It was, perhaps, the presence of the Speaker--it was,\r\nperhaps, the painful recollection of the scene of violence on a previous\r\noccasion--it was, perhaps, the universal exhaustion of the House;\r\nwhatever the cause, the excitement on the night of August 25th was\r\ninfinitely below what anybody would have expected. Throughout the whole\r\nevening there was exactly the same spectacle as on previous\r\nevenings--that is to say, there was the same old obstructive group\r\ndiscussing exactly the same topics; raising the same objections; going\r\ninto the same subtleties as if the Bill were just in its first stage;\r\nand there was the same dreary and universal emptiness of the House\r\ngenerally. At last, as eleven o'clock approached, the Unionists prepared\r\nthemselves for a dramatic effort. Mr. Chamberlain prepared an\r\neducational bombshell, but Mr. Healy hoisted the engineer with his own\r\npetard.\r\n\r\nThen, quietly and noiselessly, we went through a couple of divisions;\r\nand before we knew where we were, Mr. Morley was standing at the table,\r\nand moving that the third reading of the Bill should take place the\r\nfollowing Wednesday. Nearly every one of the most prominent debaters had\r\nby this time cleared out. The Irish Benches, however, remained full, and\r\nfrom them came a triumphant cheer as, at a quarter to twelve, the motion\r\nwas carried, and the second stage of the great measure of Irish\r\nemancipation was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nIRELAND'S CHARTER THROUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A dull beginning.]\r\n\r\nInsipidity, weariness, and dulness marked the commencement of the\r\nconcluding week of the Home Rule Bill in the House. There was no private\r\nbusiness on the Monday, and accordingly for nearly a quarter of an\r\nhour--it seemed infinitely longer to the little group of members\r\npresent--the House sat in sedate and solemn silence. Then commenced\r\nquestions, and in a moment half-a-dozen members were buzzing with\r\ngnat-like pertinacity about the impassive figure of the\r\nPostmaster-General. Mr. Arnold Morley was continually on his legs. For\r\ninstance, Mr. Bousfield wanted to know what rule there was which forbade\r\nPost Office employés to approach the House of Commons directly, or to\r\nsign a petition to the House with reference to any grievance, after\r\nhaving unsuccessfully petitioned the Postmaster-General. Mr. Morley\r\nreplied laconically, \"There is no such rule.\" Then several of the Tory\r\nmembers attempted to corner Sir U.K. Shuttleworth about the quantity of\r\ncoals consumed in the \"Majestic\" while going at full speed. Sir Edward\r\nHarland was cautious, and Mr. Gibson Bowles, whose rising was the signal\r\nfor derisive cheers, was pertinacious. The Secretary to the Admiralty,\r\nalways dignified, was grave and serious. He was not to be tripped up,\r\nand discreetly declined to be drawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Our first line of defence.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the well-known peculiarities of the House of Commons that\r\nits attendance is usually in inverse line of proportion to the\r\nimportance of the subject which it is discussing. On August 28th the\r\nHouse was engaged in debating the question which above all others ought\r\nto interest the people of this country--the state, namely, of our Navy.\r\nYet the House was almost entirely empty throughout the whole evening,\r\nand the speeches were generally confined to the somewhat inarticulate\r\nrepresentatives of the services, and to the dullest and smallest men in\r\nthe whole assembly. It is obviously inconvenient--perhaps it is even\r\nperilous--that interests so grave and so gigantic should fall for their\r\nguardianship into hands so incompetent and so petty. It may be an\r\ninevitable accompaniment of our Parliamentary system that the naval\r\ndebates should be so conducted; if so, one must put it down as one of\r\nthe evils which must be taken as part of the price we pay for the\r\nexcellences of a representative system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Edward Reed as an alarmist.]\r\n\r\nI may dismiss the debate on the Navy with one or two further\r\nobservations. Sir Edward Reed, though he knows a good deal about\r\nships--for he has had something to do with them all his life--is not an\r\nauthority whom one can implicitly accept. He is not a politician who has\r\nprospered according to what he believes and what are doubtless his\r\ndeserts, for he is a very clever man, and politicians who are a little\r\ndisappointed have a certain tendency to ultra-censoriousness, which\r\ndamages the effectiveness and prejudices the authority of their\r\ncriticisms. Thus, Sir Edward has been always more or less of a pessimist\r\nwith regard to the doings of other men. On August 28th he spoke in\r\ndecidedly alarmist terms of the lessons which should be taught to us by\r\nthe loss of the \"Victoria.\" Speaking with the modesty of a mere layman\r\non the subject, I should have been inclined to think that the chief\r\nmoral to be drawn from that terrible and tragic disaster was the\r\nterribly important part which the mere personality of the individual in\r\ncommand still plays in deciding the fate of hundreds of lives; that, in\r\nshort, the personal equation--as it has come to be called--- is still\r\nthe supreme and decisive factor in all naval enterprises. But there may\r\nbe some grounds for the alarmist views of Sir Edward Reed, and I see no\r\nreason why his views should not receive prompt, candid, and independent\r\ninvestigation. The officials may oppose such an investigation; but\r\nofficials are always optimists, and the cold draught of outside\r\ncriticism does them an immense deal of good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Grand Old Chieftain and his tactics.]\r\n\r\nAt an early hour in the evening there was a very significant question,\r\nand an equally significant answer. Sir Charles Dilke called attention,\r\nwith characteristic adroitness to a weapon which the Tories placed in\r\nour hands for dealing with such an emergency as that by which we were at\r\nthe moment confronted. It was Lord Salisbury who made the most excellent\r\nsuggestion that when a Bill had gone through all its stages in one\r\nSession of Parliament it should not be necessary to repeat the process\r\nin the next, but that a mere resolution should bring the Bill once again\r\ninto the fulness of life. Would it not be possible for the Government,\r\nasked Sir Charles, to adopt the proposal with regard to their measures?\r\nThe answer of the Old Man was cautious, vague, and dilatory. It is one\r\nof his well-known peculiarities not to arrive at the solution of a\r\ntactical difficulty one moment too soon; and this is a rule which,\r\ngenerally speaking, acts extremely well. I dare say Sir Charles Dilke\r\ndid not expect any other answer; and nobody in the House was surprised\r\nthat the Old Man answered as he did. But all the same, one could read\r\nbetween the lines, and it was pretty clear that the Old Man was\r\npreparing to face the situation by remedies drastic enough to meet even\r\nso revolutionary a situation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A great Parliamentarian.]\r\n\r\nEverybody was delighted--that is to say, everybody on the Liberal side\r\nof the House--to see that the great old leader was displaying on this\r\nquestion the same unerring tactics, the same resources the same\r\nwillingness to learn, and the same elasticity of mind as he has\r\nmanifested throughout his whole life--or at least throughout all that\r\npart of it which dates from his escape from the shackles of his early\r\nand obscurantist creed. He has never concealed the fact that he departed\r\nfrom the old rules of the House of Commons with misgiving reluctance,\r\nand even repulsion. It would have been strange, indeed, if he could have\r\nfelt otherwise after all his long years of glorious service in that\r\naugust assembly. But then, when the time did come for taking the plunge,\r\nhe took it boldly and unshrinkingly. It was a delight to watch him\r\nduring this Session, and especially when it became necessary to use the\r\nguillotine against the revolutionary and iniquitous attempt to paralyse\r\nthe House of Commons by sheer shameless obstruction. The \"guillotine\"\r\nwas a most serious, a most momentous, and even portentous departure from\r\nall precedent, except, of course, the Tory precedent of 1887; but the\r\nOld Man, when the proper time came, proposed the experiment with the\r\nutmost composure--with that splendid command of nerve--that lofty and\r\ndauntless courage--that indifference to attack, which explains his\r\nextending hold over the imaginations and the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plain duty of Liberals.]\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that he will be quite equal to any further steps\r\nwhich may be necessary to vindicate the authority of the majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and nobody doubts that such further steps may be\r\nnecessary. The real and fundamental question--as I put it over and over\r\nagain--is whether the Liberal party and the Liberal majority shall go\r\nbefore the country at the next election with the charge made good\r\nagainst them of lack of will, competence, and energy. If once that\r\ncharge can be substantiated, I regard the Liberal cause as lost--and\r\nlost for many a year to come. Any Government almost is better than a\r\nGovernment which cannot govern; and the sentiment is so universal that I\r\nhave no doubt the shifting ballast, which decides all elections, would\r\ngo with a rush to the Tory side, and would enthrone in the place of\r\npower a strong Tory majority and an almost omnipotent Tory Government.\r\nThe Tories know this, and calculate upon it, and will devote all their\r\nenergies, therefore to reducing the present House of Commons and the\r\npresent Ministry to discredited impotence, contemptible paralysis. Such\r\na conspiracy must be met in the proper manner. Obstructive debate must\r\nbe mercilessly closured; old rules must be abandoned without a sigh, and\r\ngive way to others more adapted to the necessity of the time. Above all\r\nthings the House of Lords must be flouted, humiliated, and defied. It is\r\non the spring-tide of popular democratic and anti-aristocratic passion\r\nwe shall have to float the next Liberal Government into power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nepotism in the army.]\r\n\r\nWhen business commenced on August 29th, there was a beggarly array of\r\nempty benches. For some time, the only Tory defenders of the\r\nConstitution were the ubiquitous George Christopher Trout Bartley and\r\nthe valiant Howard Vincent. Questions showed more inclination than ever\r\nto wander into the purely parochial. Presently Mr. Burnie came along\r\nwith an inquiry addressed to the War Minister whether it was correct the\r\nDuke of Connaught had been appointed to the chief command of the army at\r\nAldershot; and, if so, on what grounds he had been selected for this\r\nimportant position. Several other vigorous Radicals were on the same\r\nscent. Mr. Campbell-Bannerman said it was quite true the Duke had become\r\nCommander-in-Chief. This was because of his fitness; because he was\r\npractically the senior officer available, and because he had gained\r\nexperience in both regimental and staff duties, having filled with great\r\ncredit the high office of Commander-in-Chief at Bombay. Herculean Mr.\r\nAllan, of Gateshead, sought for information how many months the Duke of\r\nConnaught was absent from his duties when he commanded at Portsmouth.\r\nYoung Mr. Dalziel also came forward, wanting to know whether the Duke\r\nwould receive the salary of a General or a Lieutenant-General. Mr. A.C.\r\nMorton, who had appropriated for the nonce Mr. T.W. Russell's usual\r\nseat, was anxious for a further explanation of what was meant by the\r\nDuke being practically the senior officer available. He also wanted to\r\nknow what experience he had had in real fighting. The reply of the War\r\nMinister was conciliatory. There were, he explained, one or two generals\r\nsenior to H.R.H., but who were at present discharging duties from which\r\nit was not desirable they should be removed. The pay would be that of a\r\nLieutenant-General. Owing to domestic circumstances, the Duke lived out\r\nof Portsmouth, but he was little out of the district he commanded. He\r\nserved in the Egyptian campaign, which was the only opportunity he had\r\nhad during his career in taking part in active warfare. This did not\r\nsatisfy either Mr. Allan or Mr. Morton. The member for Peterboro' wanted\r\nto be precise. How far was H.R.H. away from the real fighting? The War\r\nMinister could only smile and shake his head. Mr. Allan expressed his\r\ndissent, and Mr. Morton, derisively cheered by a handful of Tories,\r\nsolemnly begged to give notice that on the Army Estimates he would again\r\nraise the question of this flagrant job.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A triumph for Mr. Burns.]\r\n\r\nThe evening was notable for a splendid triumph achieved by that fine\r\nDemocrat, John Burns. It arose out of the Navy Estimates. The conditions\r\nof labour in the Government dockyards have long been crying out for\r\nremedy, and Mr. Burns presented the case for the men with a force and\r\nlucidity that carried conviction home to the minds of a crowded House,\r\namong whose members his is one of the most magnetic personalities. The\r\nmember for Battersea pointed out that, whilst he strongly approved of\r\nthe attitude of the Government in adding £30,000 to the wages of the\r\nmen, the real step they should have taken was to ignore the opinion of\r\nthe permanent officials, those bugbears of all reformers, past, present,\r\nand to come--pay the trades union rates, and abolish classification\r\naltogether. A very excellent smack at Sir John Gorst, Mr. A.B. Forwood,\r\nand other standbacks on the Opposition side was the remark:--\"I would\r\nrather have the rate of wages in dockyards regulated by trades unions\r\nthan made the sport of party politicians and put up as a kind of Dutch\r\nauction.\" What have the Government to fear in this matter? The trade\r\nunions must always have to face competition and trade rivalry, and these\r\nelements alone are more than sufficient to keep down wages. So great was\r\nthe impression made by Mr. Burns's speech, that official notice of it\r\nwas inevitable, and Mr. E. Robertson was able to make an announcement\r\nwhich gave, if not absolute satisfaction, at least a measure of it to\r\nthe champions of the artificers and labourers in our dockyards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Home Rule again.]\r\n\r\nIt was only the Old Man would have had the daring to begin the third\r\nstage of the greatest Bill of modern times at an hour so\r\ninauspicious--noon on a Wednesday sitting. Everybody knows that among\r\nall the dead hours of the House of Commons, there is no hour so utterly\r\ndead as that. Indeed, very often such is the disinclination of the\r\nnatural man for unreasonable and unseasonable hours--it is very often\r\nextremely difficult for the Whips of the Government to get together the\r\nforty members who are necessary to form the quorum for the starting of\r\nbusiness; and I have known cases where it was close upon two o'clock--if\r\nnot even later--before there was a sufficient muster for the beginning\r\nof the day's business. However, Mr. Gladstone calculated correctly on\r\nthe magic of his name and the witchery of his oratory; for by a few\r\nminutes past twelve, when he rose to make his speech, the House was\r\ncrowded in almost every part, and he had an audience not only\r\nunprecedented in its fulness at such an hour, but also delightfully\r\nstimulating in its general responsiveness and sometimes even its ready\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A mighty speech.]\r\n\r\nThe speech of the Old Man was worthy of the occasion. For some hours\r\nafter it had ended nobody had anything to say about anybody or anything\r\nelse; it was one of those speeches that create something like rapture;\r\nand that oft-repeated declaration that he had never done anything like\r\nit before--a declaration I have heard too many times to now altogether\r\naccept. The voice was splendid, the diction very fine, the argument\r\nclose and well knit, the matter carefully prepared without any selfish\r\nadherence to the letter of a manuscript--a fidelity which always spoils\r\nanything like spontaneity of oratory. And the Old Man was in splendid\r\nphysical condition and in the brightest of spirits. Indeed, I was never\r\nmore struck with the extraordinary physical perfection which Mr.\r\nGladstone's frame has maintained after his eighty-three years of full\r\nactive and wearing life. The back was straight, the figure erect, the\r\nmotions free, unconstrained, easy; the gestures those of a man whose\r\nevery joint moved easily in a fresh and vigorous frame. And the face was\r\nwonderfully expressive, now darkened with passionate hatred of wrong,\r\nnow bursting into the sunshine of genial and pleasant smiles. And--as is\r\nusual when he is in this mood--he was extraordinarily quick at taking\r\ninterruptions; he was, indeed, almost boisterous in his manner, and\r\nseemed to positively invite those interjectional interventions from the\r\nother side, which, in less exuberant moods he is sometimes inclined to\r\nresent. Mr. Chaplin had quoted a portentous passage from Cavour to show\r\nthat the great Italian statesman had declared against Home Rule. Mr.\r\nGladstone was able to cap this with another passage--which, beginning\r\nwith a strong indictment of English methods of government in Ireland,\r\nwound up with the declaration that Ireland ought to be treated with the\r\nsame justice and generosity as Canada. While the Liberals were still\r\ncheering this thrust, Mr. Chaplin got up to make the remark that Cavour\r\nhad said other things quite contradictory of this, whereupon the Old\r\nMan--still with a smile of deadly courtesy--pounced upon Mr. Chaplin\r\nwith the remark, \"Is it your case, then, that Cavour contradicted\r\nhimself?\"--a retort, the rapidity and completeness of which crushed Mr.\r\nChaplin for the moment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cowed silence of the Tories.]\r\n\r\nWhen he dealt with the charge that the Government had unduly curtailed\r\ndebate, the Old Man had made up his case very thoroughly, and as he read\r\nthe damning indictment which showed the wild multitudinousness, the\r\ninfinite variety and the prolonged duration of the speeches of the\r\nOpposition, there was plenty of encouraging cheers from the Liberal\r\nside; while on the Tory Benches they sat in dumb and stricken silence.\r\nIndeed, throughout the whole speech, the Tories were singularly quiet.\r\nPerhaps it was that they too were carried away by the witchery and the\r\nspell which the Old Man had cast over the rest of the House; and, while\r\ndisagreeing with him, were still sufficiently wound up to the lofty and\r\nmore empyrean heights which the orator reached to feel that there would\r\nbe something jarring and even common in a note of dissent. Whatever the\r\nreason, they remained uncommonly silent throughout the whole speech;\r\nand, sometimes, when one or two of the more ebullient members spoke, the\r\ninterjectors got very little change for their pains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The readiness of the Old Man.]\r\n\r\nAnd this silence was the more remarkable in one or two of the most\r\nimportant passages of the Bill, for the Old Man challenged interruption.\r\nThus he ranged the objections to the Bill under seven separate heads,\r\nand then he proceeded to read out these heads. They were all a perfectly\r\nfaithful representation--in some cases even a repetition--of what the\r\nTories had said; but stated baldly, nakedly, in the cold light of early\r\nday, they sounded intensely ridiculous. It was impossible, for instance,\r\nto take seriously the resounding proposition that the Bill \"would break\r\nup the Empire\"--that under the Bill the loyal minority would incur loss\r\nof life, liberty and property, and so on. As Mr. Gladstone read out\r\nthese propositions there was a deadly chill, a disheartened silence, on\r\nthe Tory Benches which had its importance, for it showed plainly that,\r\nhowever ready they were to mouth these things on platforms they felt a\r\nlittle ashamed of them in their more sober moments. Just once or twice,\r\na stray Tory did venture to signify by a timid and faint cheer his\r\nacceptance of the ridiculous litany of prophecy and reprobation which\r\nMr. Gladstone was repeating to him. And then the Old Man was delightful;\r\nhe smiled all over his face until its features were one vast mass of\r\ncorrugated wrinkles; then he waved his hand a little to the other side,\r\nand finally congratulated himself on being in the happy position of\r\nbeing even partially corroborated by gentlemen of opposite opinions,\r\nWhereupon, of course, the whole House laughed, including the very member\r\nwhom the Old Man had thus toasted. In short, as will have been seen from\r\nmy description, the Old Man was in his very best form, in full command\r\nof himself, of his friends, and even of his enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A solemn peroration.]\r\n\r\nFinally, there came a peroration--lofty, almost inspired--splendidly\r\ndelivered, rapturously applauded. It rang out a note of perfect\r\nconfidence--of early and complete victory--of righteous trust in a\r\nrighteous cause. And the House which had followed the great orator in\r\nrapt attention so long could not tire of cheering this glowing and\r\ninspiring end. For several minutes the cheers were given--and again\r\ngiven, and again. Meantime, poor Mr. Courtney had been standing--waiting\r\nfor silence. To him had been entrusted the task of moving the rejection\r\nof the measure. He was dull, pedantic, and rather embarrassed after this\r\ngreat effort of Mr. Gladstone, and the House emptied. There was a\r\ncertain stir of curiosity as the name of \"Mr. Disraeli\" was called by\r\nthe Speaker; and then the bearer of one of the greatest names of our\r\ntimes, stood up. His speech was brightish, cleverish, and yet there was\r\nsomething wanting. Mr. Redmond was critical, cautious, severe on the\r\nfinancial clauses, but finally pronounced for the Bill. And so we\r\nstarted the first day of final debate on the Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The last lap.]\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it; the House was thoroughly jaded, and it\r\nwould have been beyond the power of the most Demosthenic orator to rouse\r\nit to anything like enthusiasm. Several of the speeches throughout the\r\nfollowing evening were of a high order; but still there was no\r\nresponse--it was speaking from a rock to the noisy, unlistening, and\r\nirresponsive sea. The night of September 1st began with a brief,\r\ngraceful, finely-phrased and finely-tempered speech by Mr. Justin\r\nMcCarthy, which confirmed Mr. Dillon's frank expression of the Bill as a\r\nfinal measure of emancipation to the Irish people. The obvious sincerity\r\nof the speaker--the high character he has, his long consistency, and,\r\nabove all, the sense of his thorough unselfishness, procured for Mr.\r\nMcCarthy a respectful and even a sympathetic hearing from all parts of\r\nthe House, and he had an audience silent, attentive, and admiring.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joe's parting bolt.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the kindliness, the sincere judgment, and the\r\nkindly disposition of Mr. McCarthy and the somewhat raucous and\r\nmalevolent accents of Mr. Chamberlain, was very marked. Not that Mr.\r\nChamberlain was by any means so nasty as usual; it looked as if he had\r\nbeen taught by the failure of his last utterance into learning at last\r\nthat malevolence in the end defeats itself by its very excess, and he\r\nevidently had resolved to put a very severe restraint upon himself, and\r\nattuned his oratory to a very minor key. But this new tone was just as\r\nunsuccessful as the other, and there is a second unsuccessful and flat\r\nspeech to be put to his credit. Many of the ideas, many of the phrases,\r\nwere repetitions of things he had already said a hundred times over in\r\nthe course of the previous debates; in short, the speech was a\r\nrevelation of the fact, known to those who have watched Mr. Chamberlain\r\ncarefully, that the soil is very barren and very thin; and that after a\r\nfew oratorical crops it becomes exhausted. Perhaps the failure of the\r\nspeech was also largely due to the fact that the Irish and the Liberal\r\nmembers, taught by previous experiences, resolved to also put restraint\r\non themselves. They have learned by this time that interruptions do Mr.\r\nChamberlain a great deal of good; and that his great nimbleness and\r\nreadiness never come out so well as when he has suddenly to answer such\r\nan interruption. Addressing benches--blank, silent and irresponsive, he\r\nlaboured rather heavily throughout the whole of his address; and there\r\nwas a complete absence even from the Tory benches of that loud and\r\nfrequent accompaniment of cheers to which Mr. Chamberlain is usually\r\ntreated. In short, it was a dull, ineffective speech, mostly listened to\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A coming man.]\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey delivered an admirable reply. In his case--as in that of\r\nMr. Chamberlain--there was an immense disadvantage of a tired House, and\r\nthe audience had thinned somewhat after Mr. Chamberlain had sat down.\r\nBut those who remained were fortunate enough to hear one of the most\r\nperfect specimens of House of Commons eloquence that has been heard in\r\nWestminster for many a day. Indeed, there are few men in the House who\r\nhave so perfect a command of what I might call the true, genuine, and\r\neven grand style of Parliamentary eloquence. Sir Edward Grey speaks with\r\na perfectly unbroken, level tone; his language is moderate and reserved,\r\nand he has the great art of using language which implies and suggests\r\nmore than it actually says. In short, his eloquence is that of perfect\r\nhigh-bred conversation, discussing questions with that complete\r\nself-command and composure of the man of the world who disdains to use,\r\neven of the greatest affairs, and of the strongest emotions, language of\r\npassion or exaggeration. Such a style is wonderfully effective in a\r\nbusiness assembly, where men feel, even when they are under the glow of\r\nsplendid eloquence, that there is behind the words a thinking,\r\nreflective, and composed mind. The speech gained enormously by the\r\ncontrast of its composure--its fine temper, its calm and broad\r\njudgment--from the somewhat pettish, personal, and passionate\r\nutterances of Mr. Chamberlain. This young man will go very far--very far\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wearisome Wallace wit.]\r\n\r\nThen there was the interval of the dinner-hour--wound up with a speech\r\nfrom Mr. Wallace. The iniquity of the abandonment of the In-and-Out\r\nclause of the Bill was again the burden of his theme. He brought to the\r\nsubject the same quaint, rich, but somewhat elaborate humour which made\r\nthe success of his previous speech; and the Tories were more than\r\ndelighted with some telling hits which he gave to Mr. Gladstone for the\r\nchange of front. But Mr. Wallace made two mistakes. It is not given to\r\nany man to make a success twice over on the same theme; and he spoke at\r\nmuch too great a length. In the end he somewhat wearied the House, and\r\naltogether the second speech was not equal to the first, though it had a\r\ngreat deal of ability in it, and _The Sun_ was obliged next day to\r\nacknowledge with gratitude the great gratuitous advertisement which it\r\nreceived by numerous quotations from its columns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balfour at a disadvantage.]\r\n\r\nIt was half-past ten o'clock when Mr. Balfour rose. By this time the\r\nheat, which had set in with quite tropical fervour, became almost\r\noverpowering, and the House, which began by being tired, had become\r\nalmost exhausted. It was under these depressing circumstances that the\r\nLeader of the Opposition started on what must have been to him something\r\nof a corvée, and for a considerable time--although the speech was not\r\nwanting in some very telling hits and bright sayings--he laboured very\r\nheavily; he could not arouse the enthusiasm even of his own followers,\r\nand was thus wire-drawn and ineffective.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honest John in fighting form.]\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Balfour was at his worst, Mr. Morley was at his best. The speech\r\nwhich he delivered at Newcastle, during the previous week, placed Mr.\r\nMorley definitely in the very front rank of platform orators. After his\r\nspeech of September 1st, he made a distinct and great advance in his\r\nposition as a Parliamentary debater. His great defect as a speaker has\r\nbeen a certain want of nimbleness and readiness. He has infinitely wider\r\nand larger resources than Mr. Chamberlain, who, nevertheless, excels in\r\nthe alertness which is often the accompaniment of shallowness. On this\r\noccasion Mr. Morley was rapid, prompt, crushing. As thus: Mr. Balfour\r\nhad spoken of the people who denounced Dublin Castle as \"third-rate\r\npoliticians.\" \"Who is the third-rate politician?\" asked Mr. Morley,\r\nlooking towards Mr. Chamberlain--everybody knows that he used to\r\ndenounce Dublin Castle--and peal on peal of laughter and cheers followed\r\nfrom the Liberal and Irish Benches. Mr. Morley followed up his advantage\r\nby saying, with a comic air of despair, \"It is very awkward to have\r\ncoadjutors using this kind of language about each other.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A reminiscence of 1885.]\r\n\r\nThis is just the kind of thing which rouses even the most tired of the\r\nHouse; there was an immediate rise the temperature; the Liberals and the\r\nIrish were ready to delightedly cheer; the Tories, who always get\r\nrestive as they approach the final hour of defeat, grew noisy, rude, and\r\ndisorderly. Then Mr. Morley turned to the charges against the Irish\r\nmembers, and asked the Tories if their own record was so white and pure\r\nthat they could afford to throw stones. This brought an allusion to the\r\nTory-Parnellite alliance of 1885, which always disturbs, distracts, and\r\neven infuriates the Tories. They became restless and noisy, and Mr.\r\nBalfour and Mr. Goschen began to rise and explain. Well would it have\r\nbeen for Mr. Goschen had he resisted this inclination. Mr. Morley was\r\nalluding to the Newport speech of Lord Salisbury, and Mr. Balfour was\r\ndefending it. \"Ah, but,\" said Mr. Morley, \"did you not\"--meaning Mr.\r\nGoschen--\"did you not yourself attack Lord Salisbury for that very\r\nspeech?\"--a retort that produced a tempest of cheers. There were then\r\nsome scornful and contemptuous allusions to Mr. Russell--to his stale\r\nvituperation, and, above all, to his grotesque charge against Mr. Morley\r\nof making himself the tool of clericalism. \"There are more kinds of\r\nclericalism than one,\" said Mr. Morley, alluding to the violent\r\npartisanship of the Presbyterian clergymen of South Tyrone. Finally, the\r\nspeech ended in a lofty, splendid, and impressive peroration. When\r\ntracing the progress of the cause for the last seven years, Mr. Morley\r\nspoke with the fine poetic diction in which he stands supreme, of\r\n\"starless skies\" and a \"tragic hour\"--meaning the Parnell crisis--and\r\nthen he used the words which more than any other thrilled the House. \"We\r\nhave,\" he cried, \"an indomitable and unfaltering captain,\" and cheer on\r\ncheer rose, while the Old Man sat, white, silent, with a composed though\r\nrapt look.\r\n\r\nThere was the bathos of a poor speech from Colonel Nolan, and then the\r\ndivision. Everybody has the numbers now--34 majority--34 in spite of\r\nSaunders and Bolton, of absent Wallace, and unpaired Mr. Wilson. We\r\ncheer, counter cheer; we rise and wave our hats; and then quickly,\r\nquietly, even with a subdued air, we walk out and leave the halls of\r\nParliament silent, dark, and echoless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHOME RULE IN THE LORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A brilliant scene.]\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy of the scene in the House of Lords on September 4th, when\r\nthe fight over the Home Rule Bill began, was undeniable. Standing at the\r\nbar, in that small space which is reserved for members of the other\r\nChamber, and looking out at the view, it was, I thought, one of the most\r\npicturesque and brilliant spectacles on which my eye had ever rested.\r\nThe beauty of the House of Commons is great. But it is undoubtedly\r\ninferior in beauty to the House of Lords. In the House of Commons the\r\nroof is a false one, for the original loftiness of the ceiling was found\r\ntoo great to allow anyone to be properly heard. But in the House of\r\nLords, where the acoustic properties are still extremely bad, the\r\nanxiety to hear its members has not yet proved great enough to induce\r\nthem to make any change in the roof, with the result that the Chamber\r\ngives you an impression of loftiness, spaciousness, and sweep, such as\r\nyou do not find in the other. And then the walls at the end obtain\r\nadditional splendour from the fine pictures that there stand out and\r\nconfront you--pictures full of crowded life, movement, and tragedy. The\r\nThrone, too, with all its gilded splendour, remains, even in its\r\nemptiness, a reminder of that stately and opulent lordship which our\r\ninstitutions give to a great personage above all parties and all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lovely woman.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, the House of Lords has made provision for the\r\nappearance of lovely woman, which contrasts most favourably with the\r\ncurmudgeon and churlish arrangements of the House of Commons. In the\r\nHouse of Commons women have to hide themselves, as though they were in a\r\nMahommedan country, behind a grille--where, invisible, suffocated, and\r\ncrowded, they are permitted to see--themselves unseen--the gambollings\r\nof their male companions below. In the House of Lords, on the other\r\nhand, there is a gallery all round the house, in which peeresses and the\r\nrelatives of peers are allowed to sit--observed of all men--prettily\r\ndressed, attentive--a beautiful flower-bordering, so to speak, to the\r\nmale assemblage below. The variety and brilliancy of colour given by\r\ntheir fashionable clothes adds a great richness and opulence and\r\nlightness to the scene; in fact, takes away anything like sombreness, in\r\nappearance and aspect at least, from an assembly which otherwise is\r\ncalculated to suggest sinister reminiscences of coming trouble and the\r\napproaching darkness of political agitation. The benches, too, have a\r\nrichness which is foreign to the House of Commons, as the members of the\r\npopular assembly sit on benches covered with a deep green leather, which\r\nis dark, modest, and unpretentious. There is always something, to my eye\r\nat least, that suggests opulence in the colour crimson, and the benches\r\nof the Upper Chamber are all in crimson leather, and the crimson has all\r\nthe freshness which comes from rarity of use. In the House of Commons,\r\nwith all its workaday and industrious life, the deep and dark green has\r\nalways more or less of a worn and shabby look. In the Upper Chamber the\r\noriginal splendour of the crimson cloth is undimmed; for most of the\r\nbenches remain void and unoccupied for 999 nights of the thousand on\r\nwhich their lordships meet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two chambers--a contrast.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause I always associate the House of Lords in my mind with\r\nemptiness and silence, and the gloomy scenes of desertion. And,\r\ntherefore, when I see it crowded as it was on this historic Monday\r\nevening, the effect it produces is heightened by the recollection and\r\nthe sense of the contrast it presents to its ordinary appearance. The\r\nHouse of Commons has a certain impressiveness and splendour of air when\r\nit is very full; I always have a certain sense of exaltation by the mere\r\nlooking at its crowded benches on these nights when the excitement of\r\nthe hour brings everybody to his place. But then the House of Commons is\r\nfrequently full, and there is no such sense of unusualness when you see\r\nit thus that you have when you look on the House of Lords with benches\r\nteeming with multitudinous life which you have seen so often empty,\r\nlifeless, and ghostly. Thus splendid was the scene, and yet it gave you\r\na prevailing and unconquerable impression of gloom and lifelessness. In\r\nthe House of Commons, the member addressing the assembly is like the\r\nwind which passes through an Æolian harp. You cannot utter a word which\r\ndoes not produce its full and immediate response. You say a thing which\r\nhas the remotest approach to an absurdity in it, and the whole House\r\nlaughs consumedly and immediately. You utter a phrase which excites\r\nparty feeling, and at once--quick as lightning falls--comes back the\r\nretort of anger or approval; your way is studded and punctuated with\r\nsome response or other, that signifies the readiness and the depth and\r\namplitude of emotion in one of the most emotional, and noisy, and\r\nresponsive assemblies in the world. It is a curious change from all this\r\nto look on all these crowded benches sitting in a silence that is\r\nunbroken more than once in the course of half an hour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spencer's serene courage.]\r\n\r\nI have often had to admire Lord Spencer--to admire him when he was a\r\npolitical foe as well as when he has been a political friend; but I\r\ndon't think I ever admired him so much as when he stood up on September\r\n4th to address this strange assembly. Hours he has passed through of\r\nall-pervading and all-surrounding gloom, danger, and assassination; but\r\nI do not suppose his nerve was ever put to a test more trying than when\r\nhe confronted those large battalions of uncompromising and irresponsive\r\nfoes. There were foes on all sides of him. They filled the many benches\r\nopposite to him; they filled, with equal fervour and multitudinousness,\r\nthe benches on his own side. It was remarkable to see the thoroughness\r\nwith which the Tories had mustered their forces; but the spectacle of\r\nthe Liberal Unionists' Benches was even still more remarkable, for there\r\nwas not a seat vacant; they had all come--those renegade and venomous\r\ndeserters from the Liberal ranks--to do their utmost against the Liberal\r\nparty and their mighty Liberal leader. And what support had Lord Spencer\r\nagainst all these foes--before him, around him--on all sides of him? On\r\nthe benches immediately behind him there was a small band of men--not\r\nforty all told--looking strangely deserted, skeleton-like, even abashed\r\nin all their loneliness and isolation. These were the friends--few but\r\nfaithful--amid all the hundreds, who alone had a word of cheer for Lord\r\nSpencer in a long and trying speech he had to address to his\r\nirreconcilable foes. But if there was any tremor in him as he stood up\r\nin surroundings so trying, I was unable to detect it. Indeed, at the\r\nmoment he rose, there was something very fine and very impressive in his\r\nfigure. He is, as most people know, a man of unusual height; hard\r\nexercise and the ride across country have kept him from having any of\r\nthat tendency to _embonpoint_ which destroys in middle age so many a\r\nfine figure. On the contrary, there is not a superfluous ounce of flesh\r\non that tall, alert figure; it is the figure of a trained athlete rather\r\nthan the figure one would associate with a nobleman in the end of a\r\nself-indulgent and ever-eating and over-drinking century. The features,\r\nstrong yet gentle, though far from regular, have considerable\r\ndistinction, and the flowing red beard makes the face stand out in any\r\nassembly. Carefully but plainly dressed, erect, perfectly composed, and\r\ncourteous in every word and look and gesture, Lord Spencer made his plea\r\nfor justice to the nation where once his name was the symbol for hatred\r\nand wrong.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A man of deeds, not words.]\r\n\r\nLord Spencer is not an orator. Simple, unadorned, straightforward, he\r\nspeaks just as he feels; and this lent a singular fascination to a\r\nspeech which from other lips might have sounded thin and ineffectual,\r\nfor the speech was nothing less than a revelation into the depths of a\r\nnature singularly rich in courage and experience. One cannot help\r\nthinking of all that lay behind those plain and unadorned words in which\r\nLord Spencer told the story of his conversion from the policy of\r\ncoercion to that of self-government. Here was the man who had looked out\r\none summer evening on the spot where his close friend--his chief\r\nsubordinate--was hacked to death; this was the man who had brought to\r\nconviction and then to the narrow square of the execution yard the\r\nmembers of one of the most powerful and sanguinary of conspiracies; here\r\nwas the man who for years had passed through the streets of Dublin and\r\nthe towns of Ireland amid the rattle of cavalcade, as necessary for his\r\nprotection against popular hate as the troops that protect the person of\r\nthe Czar in the streets of Poland. Here was, indeed, a man not of words\r\nbut of deeds; one who spoke not mere phrases coined from the imaginings\r\nof the brain, but one who had seen and heard and throbbed; had looked\r\nunappalled into the depths and the abysses of human life, and the\r\ndreadest political experiences; one who had visited the Purgatorio and\r\nconversed with the lost or the tortured souls, and come back from the\r\npilgrimage with words of hope, faith, and charity. Altogether it was a\r\nfine speech--worthy of the man, worthy of his career, worthy of the\r\ngreat and historic occasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Funereal Devonshire.]\r\n\r\nI wish I could say as much of the speech of the Duke of Devonshire. It\r\nmay be that his miserable failure was due to the fact that he is as yet\r\nunaccustomed to the House of Lords, and that the modesty which is\r\nundoubtedly one of his disadvantages as a public speaker has not yet\r\nbeen overcome; but his speech was a return to the very worst manner of\r\nhis earlier days in the House of Commons. I have heard the Duke of\r\nDevonshire in his early manner and in his late; and his early manner was\r\nabout as detestable as a man's manner could have been. He had a habit of\r\nsinking his voice as he approached the end of a sentence, so that a\r\nsentence beginning on a high note gradually sank to a moan, and a\r\nmurmur, and a gulp. The whole effect was mournful in the extreme, and\r\ngave you a sense of the weariness and the worthlessness of all human\r\nlife such as the most eloquent ascetic could never succeed in imparting.\r\nIn the House of Lords, the Duke of Devonshire suddenly returned to his\r\nearly and bad manner, and delivered a speech which was more like a\r\nfuneral oration than a call to arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Ribblesdale.]\r\n\r\nOf the remaining speeches I need say little. Lord Brassey, in a few\r\nmanly and straightforward words, expressed his entire sympathy with the\r\nprinciple of the Bill; Lord Cowper gave another very melancholy and\r\ninaudible performance. And then came one of the most remarkable speeches\r\nthe House of Lords has heard for some time. From the Treasury Bench\r\nthere stood a tall, slight, and rather delicate figure. The face, long,\r\nlarge-featured, hatchet-shaped, was surmounted with a mass of\r\ncurling-hair; altogether, there was a suggestion of what Disraeli looks\r\nlike in that picture of him as a youth which contrasts so strangely and\r\nsadly with the figure and the face we all knew in his later days. This\r\nwas Lord Ribblesdale. Lord Ribblesdale holds an office in the Royal\r\nHousehold in the present Administration. Up to a short time ago, he was\r\nunknown in even the teeming ranks of noble littérateurs; but an article\r\nhe wrote on a conversation with the late Mr. Parnell gave indications of\r\na bright and apt pen, a great power of observation, and a shrewd,\r\nimpartial mind. On Sept. 4th, he surprised the House by showing also the\r\npossession of very rare and very valuable oratorical powers, His speech\r\nwas excellent in diction, was closely and calmly reasoned, and produced\r\nan extraordinary effect, even on the Tory side, which, beginning by a\r\nstony silence, and a certain measure of curiosity--ended by giving an\r\nimpression of being moved, and even awed a little by this speech.\r\nAltogether a very remarkable performance; we have not heard the last now\r\nthat we have heard the first of Lord Ribblesdale in the fields of party\r\noratory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A striking personality.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll has changed a good deal in physical appearance during\r\nthe last twenty years. There was a time when he was was robust and\r\nsquat, a rather stout little man, with a slightly strutting manner, head\r\nthrown back, and very fine and spacious forehead; a head of hair as\r\nluxurious and drooping as that of Mary Magdalene. The form has\r\nconsiderably shrunk with advanced years, but not with any disadvantage,\r\nfor the face, pinched and lined though it appears, has a finer and more\r\nintellectual look than that of earlier days. Wrong-headed--perhaps very\r\nself-conceited--at all events, entirely left behind by the advancing\r\ndemocratic tide, the Duke of Argyll is yet always to me a sympathetic\r\nand striking figure. If he thinks badly, at least he thinks originally.\r\nHis thoughts are his own, and nobody else's; and though he is a bitter\r\ncontroversialist, at least he feels the weight and gravity of the vast\r\nquestions on which he pronounces. Above all things, he has a touch of\r\nthe divine in his oratory. He is, indeed, almost the last inspired\r\nspeaker left in the House of Lords. There is another speaker, of whom\r\nmore presently, with extraordinary gifts, with also true oratorical\r\npowers, capable of producing mighty effects; but with Lord Rosebery the\r\nlight is very clear and very dry; there is none of the softness and\r\nbrilliancy, and poetic and imaginative insight which are to be found in\r\nthe speeches of the Duke of Argyll. On September 6th the Duke used very\r\nvehement and some very whirling language about Mr. Gladstone; his\r\nreading of history was all wrong; his policy for Ireland was--to put it\r\nplainly--brutal. But what cannot be forgiven to a man who has still\r\nsuch a beautiful voice--who still gesticulates so beautifully--and,\r\nabove all, who is capable of rising to the height of some of the\r\npassages in the speech on this particular Wednesday? For instance, what\r\ncould have been more beautiful than that passage in which he put the\r\nargument that Ireland was too near to be treated in the same way as a\r\ndistant colony--the passage in which he spoke of seeing from the Scotch\r\nHighlands the sun shining on the cornfields and cottage windows of\r\nAntrim?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rosebery's great triumph.]\r\n\r\nOn September 7th a very great event happened in the House of Lords. The\r\nmental mastership of that assembly was transferred from one man to\r\nanother, from the master of many legions to the captain of a few thin\r\nand almost despised battalions. I heard the whole of Lord Rosebery's\r\nspeech, and I heard three quarters of the speech of the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury, and no impartial man could deny the contrast between these\r\ntwo speeches on this occasion, the one being no less fine and complete,\r\nthe other no less monotonous than I have set forth. It was not merely\r\nthat Lord Salisbury proved himself vastly inferior to Lord Rosebery in\r\nmere oratory, but the speech of the Foreign Secretary was that of a\r\nfiner speaker, and of a more serious, intellectual, and sagacious\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A disadvantage conquered.]\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery had the disadvantage of following upon a speaker who had\r\nreduced the House to a state of somnolent despair. Lord Selborne has an\r\nepiscopal appearance, the manner of an author of hymns, and the unctuous\r\ndelivery of a High Church speaker. But like most of the orators of the\r\nHouse of Lords, he considered two hours was the minimum which he was\r\nentitled to occupy, and though he spoke with wonderful briskness, for an\r\noctogenarian, at the beginning of his observations, his voice soon\r\nbecame so exhausted as to be a mere senile and inaudible whisper. Deeper\r\nand deeper it descended, and the House was in the blackest depths when\r\nthe Foreign Secretary rose to speak. Everybody knows how embarrassing\r\nand distressing it is to an orator to have to begin by rousing an\r\nassembly that has been thus depressed; and the difficulty was increased\r\nin the case of Lord Rosebery by the fact that he had to address an\r\naudience in which four hundred men were against him and about forty in\r\nhis favour; and there is no orator whose nerve is so steady, and whose\r\nself-confidence is so complete, as not to be depressed and weakened by\r\nsuch a combination of circumstances. This is partly the reason of the\r\nlighter tone of the earlier observations which offended some too\r\nsensitive critics. Indeed, it might have seemed for some time as if Lord\r\nRosebery got up with the idea of treating the whole business as the\r\nmerest unreality of comedy; and had resolved to signify this by refusing\r\nto treat either the House or the Bill or himself seriously. In face of\r\nthe tragedies of the Irish sphinx--with all its centuries of brooding\r\nsorrow behind it, this was not a tone which commended itself to the\r\njudicious. But, then, this was a too hasty criticism. The light and\r\nalmost chaffing introduction was necessary in the highest interests of\r\nart; for, as I have said, the House was depressed, and it was in no mood\r\nto listen to an orator whose creed appeared to it the merest rank\r\ntreason. It was necessary to get the House into something like\r\nreceptiveness of mood before coming to serious business; when that was\r\ndone, it was time enough to seek to impress it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An oratorical tour de force.]\r\n\r\nAnd this is just what happened. Everybody was in really good spirits by\r\nthe time Lord Rosebery ten minutes on his legs; Lord Selborne's unctuous\r\ndronings had disappeared into the irrevocable and vast distances; in\r\nshort, the moribund Chamber was alive, vivacious, and receptive. And\r\nwhen he had got them to this point Lord Rosebery took the serious part\r\nof his work seriously in hand. Not that he attempted lofty appeal. On\r\nthe contrary, rarely throughout the speech did he raise his voice above\r\nthat clear, penetrating, but eminently self-restrained tone which is the\r\ntone of a man of good society, discussing the loftiest and most complex\r\nproblem with the easy and disillusioned composure of the experienced and\r\nslightly cynical man of the world. Nay, Lord Rosebery offended some of\r\nhis critics by openly avowing the creed of the man of the world in\r\ndealing with the whole problem. He was careful to disown enthusiasm, or\r\nfanaticism, or even willingness in the service of Home Rule. It was with\r\nhim simply a frigid matter of policy, a policy to which he had been\r\ndriven by the resistless evidence of facts, the resistless logic of\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A deep-laid purpose.]\r\n\r\nThis frankly was an attitude which grated slightly on the sensitive\r\nnerves of the many to whom Ireland's emancipation--with all the sobbing\r\ncenturies which lie behind it--is a fanaticism, a faith, a great creed;\r\nbut the point to be really considered is whether this was the tone to\r\nadopt for the purpose of carrying out the desired end. And I am inclined\r\nto think--and some of the hottest Irishmen I know agree with me--that\r\nthis was the very way Lord Rosebery should have spoken. And after all it\r\nwas wonderfully impressive--even to me with all I feel about the Irish\r\nquestion. For the image it presented--set forth by the physical aspect\r\nof the orator--was such as I can imagine to be wonderfully impressive to\r\nthat dull, unimaginative, and unsentimental personage--the man of the\r\nshifting ballast, whose almost impenetrable brain has to finally decide\r\nthis question. And the image presented to that very creature of clay was\r\nthis: \"Here is a man who is my Foreign Secretary; as such, he has every\r\nday of his life to deal with questions which affect my interests in the\r\nmost direct way; to fight for my purse, my future, my Empire; and he has\r\nto do so with his brain matched against the brains of the astutest men\r\nin the world--the diplomatic representatives of other Powers. And all\r\nthis he has to do with the sense that behind the smooth language of\r\ndiplomacy, the unbroken and even voices of diplomatic representatives,\r\nthere stand ironclads and mighty armies--bloodshed, wholesale, and\r\nhideous death--the tiger spirit and powers of war. And I see that the\r\nman who has all these complex problems to solve--these trained gamblers\r\nto watch--these sinister Powers to confront and think of--is a man of\r\ncold temper, of frigid understanding, of a power of calm calculation in\r\nface of all the perils and all the emotions and all the sentiment of the\r\nperplexing Irish problems; and to him Home Rule has come as a set, sober\r\nchoice of possible policies for the interest of our Empire.\" Such an\r\nattitude--exalted by the even, though powerful, the cold, though\r\npenetrating voice--the face impassive and inscrutable--the eye, steady,\r\nunmoving, and unreadable--all this, I say, was just the kind of thing to\r\nproduce an immense impression on those who are ready only to accept Home\r\nRule as the policy that pays best.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Even the Peers impressed.]\r\n\r\nAnd certainly the House of Lords was wonderfully impressed by this\r\nattitude. There was no applause, except now and then from those skeleton\r\nranks that lay behind Lord Rosebery, but then there was in the whole air\r\nthat curious and almost audible silence--to use a conscious\r\nparadox--which conveys to the trained ear clearer sounds of absorption\r\nand attention than the loudest cheers. And then you began to forget the\r\nbadinage of the earlier sentences--you forgave the frigidity and\r\nself-repression--you became strongly fascinated by the mobile face,\r\ninscrutable eyes, and the voice penetrated to your innermost ear; he\r\ngave you an immense sense of a clear, masterful, and resolute mind and\r\ncharacter. And, finally, towards the end, when, to a certain extent,\r\nLord Rosebery let himself go, there was a ring not of ordinary emotion,\r\nbut of the passion of a great Minister who was fully conscious of the\r\nImperial and supreme responsibility of a Foreign Minister, who was able\r\nto look great and even complex facts straight in the face, who had the\r\ncourage to face the disagreeable solution of a troublesome and perilous\r\nproblem. And, in spite of its lethargy, its hatred of his opinions, the\r\nHouse of Lords felt this also, and there was something of awe in the\r\nsilence with which it listened to the ringing words of warning with\r\nwhich the speech concluded. And its attitude showed more. It was, so to\r\nspeak, a soul's awakening; it was the discovery of having found at last\r\na man who could sway, impress, and strike its imagination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salisbury's signal failure.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday night, September 8th, Lord Salisbury had his opportunity of\r\nundoing this great effect--of reasserting that intellectual as well as\r\nmere voting dictatorship which he holds in the House of Lords; and he\r\nsignally failed to rise to the occasion. I do not like the policy of\r\nLord Salisbury, but there is a lucidity, a point, and sometimes a vigour\r\nin his speeches which make them usually charming reading. It was,\r\ntherefore, with the full expectation of being interested that I listened\r\nto him, but he drove me out of the House by the impossibility of my\r\nkeeping awake under the influence of his dull, shallow, and\r\ndisappointing speech. He began with a little touch of nature that\r\ncertainly was prepossessing. He had brought in with him a dark-brown\r\nbottle, like the bottle one associates with seltzer water. The fluid was\r\nperfectly clear; it was evidently not like the strong wine which Prince\r\nBismarck used to require in the days when he used to make great\r\nspeeches. And Lord Salisbury, as he poured out a draught--it looked very\r\nlike Johannis water--lifted up the bottle to the Ministers opposite with\r\na pleasant smile, as though to prove to them that he was not offending\r\nagainst even the sternest teetotal code.\r\n\r\nIt was the first and the last bit of real human naturalness in the whole\r\nspeech, for Lord Salisbury's manner and delivery are wooden, stiff,\r\nawkward and lumbering. He stands upright--except, of course, for that\r\nheavy stoop of the shoulders which is one of his characteristics--and\r\nrarely moves himself one-hundredth part of an inch. The voice--even,\r\nclear, and strong, and yet not penetrating, and still less\r\ninspiring--rarely has a change of note; it is delivered with the\r\nstrange, curious air of a man who is thinking aloud, and has forgotten\r\nthe presence of any listeners. The eyes--hidden almost amid the shaggy\r\nand black-grey hair which covers nearly the whole face--are never\r\ndirected to any person around. They seem to gaze into vacancy;\r\naltogether there is something curious, weird, almost uncanny, in this\r\ngreat, big whale of a man, intoning his monologue with that curious\r\ndetachment of eye and manner in the midst of a crowded, brilliant, and\r\nintensely nervous and restless assembly of men and women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pessimism of a recluse.]\r\n\r\nAnd it was not to be wondered at that a speech so delivered--a mere\r\nsoliloquy--should fail to be impressive. It was too far and away\r\nunreal--had too little actuality to reach the poor humble breasts that\r\nwere panting for excitement and exhortation. But once throughout it all\r\nwas there a touch of that somewhat sardonic humour that sometimes\r\ndelights even Lord Salisbury's political foes. Replying to the very\r\nclever speech of Lord Ribblesdale, Lord Salisbury described the speech\r\nas a confession, and all confessions, he added, were interesting, from\r\nSt. Augustine to Rousseau, from Rousseau to Lord Ribblesdale. That, I\r\nsay, was the solitary gleam. For the rest, it was an historical\r\nessay--with very bad history and worse conclusions; and the whole spirit\r\nwas as bad as it could be. The Irish were still the enemy such as they\r\nappear in the bloody pages of Edmund Spenser, or in the war\r\nproclamations and despatches of Oliver Cromwell; and yet I cannot feel\r\nthat Lord Salisbury's language could be resented as, say, the same\r\nlanguage would be from Mr. Chamberlain. It all sounded so like the\r\ndreamings of a student and recluse--discussing the problem without much\r\npassion--without even malignity--but with that strange frankness of the\r\nunheard and unechoed musings of the closet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A muttered soliloquy.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the speech also had the narrowness, shallowness, and unreality\r\nof the hermit's soliloquy. In the main, there was no insight. A\r\nlogic-chopper, a dialectician--even in some respects a musing\r\nphilosopher--such Lord Salisbury is; but breadth, depth, clear\r\nvision--of that there was not a trace in the whole speech. And then you\r\nwent back in memory to the other speech--so clear, so broad-directed,\r\nyet uttered by a man who looked straight before him and all around\r\nhim--who felt the presence in his every nerve of that assembly there\r\nwhich he was addressing; who lived and saw instead of dreaming--and you\r\ncould come to no other conclusion than that of the two leaders of the\r\nHouse of Lords, the young man was the statesman and the man of action as\r\nwell as the orator, and that it was worth the spending even all the\r\nweary hours of this past week in the House of Lords to learn so much of\r\nthese great protagonists in our Parliamentary struggles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-climax.]\r\n\r\nOf other speakers I say but little. I came in during the dinner hour to\r\nsee a very little man with what we call in Ireland a \"cocked\" nose, a\r\nconceited mouth, and a curious mixture of the unctuousness and\r\nbenedictory manner of the pulpit and the limp twitterings of the curate\r\nat a ladies' tea-fight. This was the head of the Bishop of Ripon. I\r\ncannot stare for even a second at this tiny tomtit and artificial\r\nfigure, with all those lawn sleeves and black gowns, and all the other\r\nfripperies and draperies of the parson-peer, who is to every rational\r\nman so grotesque and contemptible an intruder in a legislative chamber.\r\nIn the grim and crowded gallery of the personages of an Irish Epic, such\r\nan intruder is like the thin piping note of a tiny bird mid the carnage\r\nand shouts and roars of a battle-field.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the result of the division: for the Bill, 41; against,\r\n419; majority, 378. It was a conclusion that was foregone, but the Lords\r\nthemselves recognized the comic futility of it. The attempted cheers\r\nended in one loud, mocking, universal laugh. And thus the curtain fell\r\non the historic drama of the great Home Rule Session.\r\n\r\nT.P.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nAddress, the; 17-30\r\nAgriculture; 24-28\r\nAlarm, a false; 185-6\r\nAnarchy, the unloosing of; 166-7\r\nAllan, Mr.; 258\r\nApology, Mr. H.
