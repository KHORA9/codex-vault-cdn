BARTOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON:\r\nA. WILLIAMS & CO., 135 WASHINGTON STREET.\r\n1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERMON.\r\n\r\n\"_He made him to teach his senators wisdom._\"--Psalms cv, 21, 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common theory of the pulpit is of a place devoted to expound some\r\nold situation, abstract scheme of salvation, or article in a creed. It\r\nhas a higher end,--to give the meaning of the scenes of real life, in\r\nwhich we observe the actors and play ourselves a part. If history be\r\nphilosophy teaching by example, and of all history biography be the\r\nsoul, then human character, when rare and conspicuous in its traits or\r\nachievements, gives as pattern or warning the chief lesson. Christian\r\nedification comes less signally from hair-splitting, dogmatic\r\ndistinction than from contemplating for imitation or admonition the\r\nlives of Enoch and Solomon, Paul and Peter, Jesus and John. So I take\r\nto-day the death of the most eminent civilian of Massachusetts for my\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nAs the King in Egypt chose Joseph to teach his senators wisdom, no man\r\nof late years has equalled Charles Sumner as an instructor or\r\ninfluence in the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nAn instinct of nature prompts us to make some account and sum up the\r\nsignificance of any one's career, privately, on the domestic stage,\r\nor before the people, if he has challenged attention in a larger\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to make some discriminating estimate of Mr. Sumner's\r\ncontributions to the public good, the legislature of a free State in a\r\ngreat Union being the monarch that for so long a period continued to\r\nelect him to his high office.\r\n\r\nHowever opinions may differ of his prudence or ability, the weight of\r\nhis word or importance of his position none will doubt.\r\n\r\nOur messenger of the lightning had no greater task this last week in\r\nthe world than to wait at his threshold and run with news every hour\r\nover the wires of his estate.\r\n\r\nHis principal peers at his bedside and his colored clients flocking\r\nfor inquiry at his door showed a feeling of love and sympathy reaching\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest class.\r\n\r\nIn culture he was a match for nobles, in temper he was a champion of\r\nthe oppressed and friend to the poor.\r\n\r\nI suppose no American name is more widely known and celebrated in all\r\ncivilized lands.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and France will feel the shock of his decease.\r\n\r\nThat one of our political pillars has fallen will be known at the\r\nCourt of St. Petersburg and among the counsellors of Berlin.\r\n\r\nItaly and Spain, with their Republican struggles and aims, will miss\r\nan advocate on this side the sea.\r\n\r\nCastelar will mourn the departure of a companion in arms in the\r\npeaceful battles of reform, as Cavour might have felt through the\r\ncable from him for emancipation an electric touch.\r\n\r\nSouth America, with her strange mixture of barbarism with liberation,\r\nwill be conscious of owing some honor to the obsequies of a\r\nsympathizer with all that is generous in her aspirations.\r\n\r\nHayti will deplore the decease of a supporter of her rights more\r\npowerful than any on her own shores.\r\n\r\nA flutter of pain and sorrow will pass through that whole flock of\r\nislands alighted, as in the great harbor of our land, betwixt the Gulf\r\nof Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nSo it will be because not only a man, a citizen of the Commonwealth\r\nand foremost trustee in the Congress of the country, but a cosmopolite\r\nis dead, deserving that name as truly as any man who, since the\r\nsettlement of these colonies, has lived within their bounds.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason of the wide consequence of this event?\r\n\r\nNot in the man's extraordinary original power.\r\n\r\nNature did not intend aught intellectually pre-eminent in his\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIt had no organic strength to strike out new paths in action or\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nIt fell into ways other agents had broken.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was not even an aboriginal abolitionist; he joined and did\r\nyeoman's service in the antislavery ranks.\r\n\r\nHe startled the soldiers, twenty-nine years ago, in Boston, with his\r\nextreme doctrine of peace; but he followed Ladd and others, with\r\ncopious illustration, but no new sentiment or novel idea.\r\n\r\nOf origination there is no speck in his reflections or spark in his\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nHis mind is parasitical, his discourse full of precedents, quotations,\r\nclassic scenes, and historic allusions, sometimes savoring of\r\nschoolboy recitations, sophomoric and declamatory, stilted and\r\ngrotesque. Yet he is in the list of wonderful men. Others thought and\r\nhe was led to fancy some resemblance in his feature and person to\r\nEdmund Burke, which the portrait of Mr. Burke might actually suggest;\r\nbut this resemblance to the great English Commoner was but skin-deep,\r\nwith little hint of the deep sea line that fathomed every question, or\r\nthe impassioned imagination which cast the light of flame on every\r\nmeasure, and kindled with magnetic sympathy, against the French\r\nRevolution and for American privilege, now one and now another portion\r\nof the British realm.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was perhaps a greater lover of freedom in its principle as\r\nan inherent right and claim of all mankind than Mr. Burke; but Burke\r\nhad pre-eminent genius in politics, Sumner only accomplished talent,\r\nthough in the later light of a more humane era put to service in a\r\ngrander cause.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Newton, Burke, William Blake: such would\r\nbe our shining classification for poetry, philosophy, science,\r\npolitics, art, in the mother land.\r\n\r\nBut for native force we should think of many persons before Sumner in\r\nhis own field of study and pursuit.\r\n\r\nHe had not the majestic sweep of Webster, the weight or heat of that\r\nmountain with its base of granite and flame, the fiery eloquence of\r\nClay, the close grip of John Quincy Adams in argument, or the subtile\r\nfelicity and gleam of primary perception which William Henry Seward\r\nbrought for the enlivening of debate.\r\n\r\nHe never could have invented the New-Yorker's phrase of _The\r\nIrrepressible Conflict_ as applied to the Free and Slave States, or\r\nthe Illinoisian Abraham Lincoln's grander adaptation of Scripture,--_A\r\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand: I do not expect the house\r\nto fall, but to cease to be divided._\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner quoted abundantly, but he is not for any rhetorical merits\r\nor ideal inventions in the whole range of his voluminous works\r\nquotable, however rich in his right to be cited for the spirit and\r\ndesign on every page.\r\n\r\nHe stands not strong among men of strength, thinkers and benefactors\r\nat first hand, germinators of thought and heroism in the van of the\r\nrace,--such as bear the stamp of a primitive and primeval energy, like\r\nAbraham, Noah, Moses, David and Paul, Buddha and Mohammed, Socrates\r\nand Plato, in the East; Garrison and John Brown among ourselves.\r\n\r\nHe was an orator of the conceptions of his predecessors and superiors,\r\nan arguer of the case, a sheriff to execute a writ.\r\n\r\nOne name I do not mention in this comparison, because, being neither\r\nancient nor modern, it is greatest of all.\r\n\r\nBut if his were a secondary mind, a vine round a stouter trunk, how\r\nlike some such creeper it towered and grew, appropriated nourishment\r\nand vigor from the old decaying boughs, till at length, with superior\r\ntoughness and tenacity, it could breast every breeze, and stood\r\nproudly alone!\r\n\r\nYet his understanding was that not of the revealer, but the scholar to\r\nthe last. He imparted what he learned; he knew what he had been told.\r\nHis delivery was not, like Patrick Henry's, a bolt from Heaven to rend\r\nthe obstacle and burn up opposition, but a crystal stream flowing\r\nsmoothly from some rock that had garnered up the mountain-dew and the\r\nrain; and he completely informed if he did not like Fisher Ames\r\nirresistibly charm.\r\n\r\nBut in the moral region lay the real greatness of the man. His\r\nconscience was original and he had no original sin.\r\n\r\nNo imputation on his purpose but cleared away like the cloud from a\r\nbreath on spotless steel, leaving the metal bright as before.\r\n\r\nHe was as incorruptible as he honorably said to me was Fessenden, his\r\ngreat rival in the Senate; and when he also one day, speaking of his\r\nlimited means, remarked: \"I have never had the art to get my hands\r\ninto the Treasury,\" I was fain to answer, \"You the whole man are in\r\nthe Treasury yourself.\" He was indeed in our politics a fund and\r\nnever-broken bank of moral wealth. Justice was his inspiration. He was\r\na prophet by equity. Righteousness was his genius; and humanity, in\r\nany lack of imagination, his insight and foresight. He was without\r\nspot. He wore ermine though he sat not on the bench. John Jay had not\r\ncleaner hands, nor John Marshall a more honest will; Hamilton and\r\nJefferson were no more patriotic in contending than he in every legal\r\nor congressional strife; and Story, his favorite teacher, and whose\r\nfavorite pupil he was, no more opulent in knowledge or innocent in its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAs an antagonist, handling questions of motive or policy, he was as\r\nfrank as the lion-hearted Richard and simple as a child.\r\n\r\nFrom those early debates to which I listened, on prison discipline,\r\nthirty years ago, to his latest speech on the Centennial Exhibition,\r\nthis candor, amounting to generosity and magnanimity, was plain as the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nHe had no tricks, no management, no intrigue. He showed his hand.\r\n\r\nCould he not prevail by openness and sincerity, he would not prevail\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIf he started no new ideas or measures that have been adopted\r\nprecisely in the way he conceived, or shape he gave, he mightily\r\nsustained all good ones, and of their goodness he would not abate a\r\ntithe.\r\n\r\nOf this rectitude benignity was the crown. Sternly exposing what he\r\nthought mean or unworthy in any proceeding or adversary, his severity\r\nwas in his argument and rhetoric rather than in the feeling of his\r\nsoul. Without a sweet disposition no man could have had such a smile.\r\nWithout some grandeur of design no man ever displayed such a\r\ncountenance and port, handsome and sublime. In his intentness and\r\nearnestness, he did not suspect the liability of his expressions to\r\nthe charge of a vindictiveness he was unconscious of in his own\r\nbreast. It was like a philippic of Demosthenes; it was a Ciceronian\r\noration against some Catiline, real or supposed. A poetic sort of\r\nrevenge was all he meant to take, although his language to opponents,\r\nwhom perhaps he sometimes mistook, may be subject to blame. Pity he\r\nwas so devoid of humor to recommend or soften his strokes!\r\n\r\nHis old peace doctrine, doubtless, mainly prompted his battle-flag\r\nresolution, while the time of offering it and his nearly\r\ncontemporaneous break with his party seemed to betray an unfair and\r\npersonal bias of which he was unaware.\r\n\r\nSensible of his great and long importance to the government, an\r\negoistic, assuming, imperious, irascible inclination may to some have\r\nappeared to be disclosed; but he ingenuously felt he had a title to be\r\nconsulted and that it was a slight and insult to set him aside. Let\r\nthe administration that refused him as an instrument beware lest it\r\nbecome a hammer in the hands of inferior men, whose success will be\r\nsuicide, and itself the tool! This may an inspiration from his coffin\r\nprevent! Massachusetts has honored herself at least as much as she did\r\nher son, and cast from yonder halls one ray of comfort on his seat in\r\nthe Senate and on his death-bed in rescinding the censure on his\r\ncourse; for his memory is among her trophies,--no banner more so that\r\nhangs beneath the cupola above the marble floor,--and she is the\r\ninheritor of his renown; for if \"Providence made Washington childless\r\nthat the country might call him father,\" Sumner is without offspring\r\nthat the State may be his mourner.\r\n\r\nThis freedom from all selfish heat or hate, one distinction of the\r\nstatesman from the politician, is a trait too rare to pass without\r\nemphasis and applause.\r\n\r\nAn example, indeed, to the ordinary run of village contrivers, caucus\r\npackers, and municipal aspirants, of a man who never pulled a wire,\r\nrolled a log, laid a pipe, listened in a lobby, whispered in the ear\r\nwhat might not be proclaimed on the house-top, held a man by the\r\nbutton, or blew any trumpet but of the public good, however in his\r\nmagnificent self-respect he might be falsely accused of wishing to\r\nblow only his own!\r\n\r\nIf a jealous personal honor ever had apology or excuse, it was how\r\nample and entire in the case of a man--the only one in our\r\nannals--appointed to wear the shining crown of martyrdom before his\r\ntranslation, to get up out of his own blood and recover from the foul\r\nassassin's bludgeon after medical tortures of the surgeon's moxa in\r\ncombustion on his disabled spine, such as Sequard says he never\r\napplied to any other living creature.[A]\r\n\r\nSo he rose to bear the same unflinching testimony, no more groaning\r\nunder the fire of reproach than of the burning cotton; and if proud of\r\nhis position, with perfect consistency modest too.\r\n\r\nI did not and at this distance of cooling time do not approve all the\r\nphraseology he employed on that senatorial occasion; but his weapons\r\nwere words, and, however rough and affronting, for the right: those of\r\nhis foes, equally gross and injurious, were for the wrong; and the\r\nassault of brutal force came to disturb the equation, in violation of\r\nall parliamentary privilege, with Douglas and his piratical compeers,\r\nwith ill-disguised pleasure and half-pretended unconcern, looking on\r\ntheir own ignominy, crime, and shame, while the martyr that all but,\r\nyet not quite, expired, after years of suffering comes back, a\r\nresurrection witness not disposed of, and the assailant and would-be\r\nexecutioner dies long first, in Northern and Southern disgrace and his\r\nown remorse.\r\n\r\nAt the same height with Milton in his blindness, Sumner, with his torn\r\nand aching nerves, like a soldier who will not leave the field for\r\nloss of blood, resumed the conflict, struggling with disappointment\r\nand sorrow in age and loneliness, still moving ever immediately\r\nagainst all the powers of evil and works of the devil, his white\r\nplume, like that of the French Prince he quoted, floating ever ahead\r\nto follow; like ex-President, Representative Adams, in his armor to\r\nthe very edge and last of earth, like Buckle, talking in his agony of\r\nhis book, and commending to survivors in Congress his beloved Civil\r\nRights' Bill, dealing out well-directed blows for his race of every\r\ncolor and tribe till the instant the final stroke came to cut body and\r\nspirit apart. Truly, the halo of angelic glory hangs not only around\r\nthe heads of dead saints! Such a man might be tempted to claim the\r\nhonor of his fellow-men, and a lofty self-esteem and aspiration to the\r\nhighest dignities hardly misbecame him, who, like Cato, was wrapped in\r\nconscious integrity, and established in the respect of all\r\npraiseworthy persons such a place. After the famous eulogy in his Phi\r\nBeta Kappa oration, of Pickering, Story, Allston, and Channing, the\r\ntoast of John Quincy Adams was: \"The memory of the scholar, jurist,\r\nartist, and divine,--and not the memory, but the long life of the\r\nkindred genius that has embalmed them all.\" Yet it has come for him\r\nalso to a memory, and a noble one now.\r\n\r\nAs a humble cotemporary I copy not others' impressions, but simply set\r\ndown my own. Among his associates, the fault commonly found with\r\nSumner is not that he was implacable--none easier to propitiate--but\r\nimpracticable; not an idealist, but ideologist and doctrinary dreamer\r\nof a peace and freedom on earth which he put into no effective and\r\nsatisfactory form; for ten thousand besides him recommended the\r\nEmancipation, which John Quincy Adams held justifiable as a war\r\nmeasure, and Lincoln proclaimed.\r\n\r\nBut though the greatness of rulers and social founders is in what they\r\nestablish and bring to pass, yet in default of this rare achievement,\r\nwhich happens seldom in the course of ages to any man, a certain\r\nimpracticability is in others in many exigencies a blessing to be\r\nthankful for, a virtue to applaud. In the collisions of interest with\r\nprinciple are plenty to trim, compromise, and compound as oligarchs or\r\ndemagogues bid; but as the merit of some substances is the lack of\r\nductility, so how oft we must lean on unmalleable men, whose back-bone\r\nis not supple as a universal joint, who will not \"crook the pregnant\r\nhinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning,\" and who, in a\r\nnoble discontent with all yet undertaken or done, summon to worthier\r\nperformance towards never-attained perfection in betterment of the\r\ncommon lot. Mr. Rubinstein was displeased with the preacher who said,\r\n\"Men must be expected to do no more than they can.\" \"No,\" said the\r\nartist, \"that doctrine letting down the standard is worse than actual\r\nvice. We can forgive the last, not the first!\" Men must do the\r\n_impossible_,--a word which Napoleon told his officer was beastly,\r\nnever to be spoken, and in his dictionary not found. \"With God all\r\nthings are possible,\" and that means possible to whoever works with\r\nHim. Said the pianist to his pupils, \"If you do not expect or intend\r\nto write finer music than Beethoven, you have no business to compose\r\nat all.\" Mr. Sumner aimed at the sun; and the feeling of philanthropic\r\nduty with which he stirred the body politic out of the custom of\r\nchronic oppression and old habit of wrong was of more precious\r\nconsequence than carrying any particular scheme. With this\r\nearnestness, that would not stop short of improving the world, I was\r\nstruck in my last conversation with him on the threatened Spanish war.\r\nIf he did not interest or magnetize everybody, all individuals, like\r\nCrittenden or Clay, few cared more for their kind; and this broad\r\nbenevolence, as well as special affection, lays hold on immortality.\r\nWho shall say such as Agassiz and Sumner are dead? \"A great man has\r\nfallen,\" said my friend: no, a good man has risen.\r\n\r\nDeath brings simplicity and reality. As it approaches, learning and\r\nphilosophy go; goodness and conscience are left, the last guests in\r\nthe feast of life at the table of the heart. In Sumner the\r\n_sentiment_, foremost always, blooms at the pillow where last he laid,\r\n\"so tired and weary,\" his head; and sentiment, as well as science, has\r\neternal claim. He extends courtesy to callers, opens his eye while it\r\ncould open, waves his hand while it had strength to move, says _Sit\r\ndown_ to his old associate, tries to speak when the lips no longer\r\nobey the will, and sends a legacy of love and reverence more precious\r\nthan any gold to his old friend. _Cold_ was he indeed?\r\n\r\nFor his noble affections, how we shall remember the solitary and\r\nlittle-related man, with no children, when he was sad, to play with in\r\nhis house! His thirst for knowledge, his bent to investigate and study\r\nwhatever had been said and done in the world, would have made him an\r\nantiquarian save for his patriotic and humanitarian zeal.\r\n\r\nWhat a lover and knower he was of pictures, bronzes, manuscripts, old\r\nbooks, curious relics of the past, all memorials in all time of his\r\nfellow-men! Such research is a sort of humanity. Yet no man's\r\nsympathies were more in the present than his, or more eager to\r\nstretch after a perfected civilization in the future.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the millennial day shone so upon him through the vista of hope\r\nas to dazzle and blind him, like Saul on the road to Damascus, to the\r\nimmediate possibilities of action and direct bearings of his theme.\r\n\r\nIf there were any defect in his style, it was a certain lack of\r\nproportion, or an exceeding uniform stress, a straining forward\r\nagainst the leash of irrefragable circumstance, till in the ardor of\r\npursuit the perspective of the subject was lost.\r\n\r\nBut whatever might be the lesser vices, the great virtues were in his\r\njudgment and thought.\r\n\r\nHe was an admirable inciter. How we needed incentives! He hallooed to\r\na grander chase than any huntsman's. He was the Lamartine of America,\r\n_our_ orator of the human race. The Senate floor was to him a popular\r\nrostrum and sacred stump. He advocated every great cause if he found\r\nthe key of none.\r\n\r\nHe roused England and the United States, kindling into white heat,\r\nlike dry wood, after such long seasoning, the Alabama difficulties,\r\nand compelling an attention which doubtless was good for both parties,\r\nalthough his extravagant statement of the doctrine of consequential\r\ndamages could not settle the question, and failed of the seal and\r\nsanction of international law. More human than divine, his\r\ninspiration came from without rather than from within. The first time\r\nI saw him, forty years ago, with the same characteristic ornate and\r\nfervent language, and garnish of Latin references, he elucidated to me\r\nthe difference between a pettifogger or litigious searcher for\r\ncases--a _præco actionum_ as he called him--and a jurist of the Judge\r\nStory stamp.\r\n\r\nAlready he saw in faith the career for which he turned aside from\r\nevery flattering offer that would divert him, conscious of superior\r\nability to serve at the highest posts to which Democrat joined hands\r\nwith Free Soiler to lead. Strange that the seemingly accidental, shall\r\nI say insincere, vote of a coalition should have furnished the most\r\ndistinguished and perhaps longest continued Senator of the land!\r\n\r\nHis empty chair on the Senate floor, drew, last week, at the\r\nobsequies, the spectators' eyes.\r\n\r\nBut it was unoccupied that he might fill a higher seat prepared,\r\nwaiting for, and needing, not the undying part but the everlasting\r\nwhole; for we are not _whole_ till we drop our dust! Three\r\nfuneral-sensations, I remember,--of Webster, the man of power,\r\nLincoln, the man of providence, and Sumner, as I delight to call him,\r\nthe man of purity.\r\n\r\nIf the shadow of no demise ever brooded over this region as a huge\r\npall, a black sheet let down from the sky, like that of the great\r\nNew-Englander; and if no public sorrow in our day and generation was\r\never keener than when the martyr-president gave up the ghost at the\r\nrevengeful stroke of the monster of political slavery, expiring, like\r\na leviathan, under his hand; never was a more genuine tribute than\r\nwill be laid on the Senator's tomb, or a completer satisfaction in an\r\nended testimony and finished work, whatever part he left for us to\r\nfinish. Several years ago, forced by illness away from the theatre of\r\npublic duties and affairs into a country refuge, as the sounds came\r\nsoftened by distance from the arena at the capitol where the\r\ncombatants struggled together, however pleasantly fell the counsels of\r\nmoderation and prudence on my ear, I recognized the clarion of Sumner,\r\nurging to absolute truth and honor, and, far or near, resounding above\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nHere was a man that could not bend or yield, alloy or qualify,\r\nsurrender or retreat. Here was an incorruptibility proof against\r\nbribes, and too original in legislatives halls, an originality, if not\r\nof suggestion yet of heroic act. Here was an obstinacy not of will,\r\nbut idea; for ideas are more obstinate than any human will in the\r\nworld. Here was a necessity not of whim but duty, such as was laid on\r\nthe great apostle to the Gentiles to preach the Gospel, and drove\r\nLuther to the Diet of Worms. I aim at simple truth as I speak. Such\r\nstubbornness will surely accomplish great results and always fetch an\r\necho from the human breast. I abstain from overstatement. Love must\r\nnot falsify or exaggerate. It is no compliment to exalt another by\r\nbelying ourselves. Our friend belongs to history now; and the\r\nofferings of a discriminating respect are part of its material. I must\r\nthink of him less as hewn by the Divinity than carving himself. Like\r\none of the straws a swallow bears to build its nest, let my poor word\r\ngo to the fashioning by many hands, of the niche of his fame. His head\r\nhad its limits; but there was no outside to his heart! The great man's\r\nservant, secretary, keeper of his house, farmer of his estate, has\r\nsomething valuable to say of him; and the humblest coeval's\r\ncontribution will not be refused or despised. Voicing the feeling of\r\nno party, for him or against, I but touch the ground of that secret\r\nrespect to his character and aim which not only favorers but foes are\r\nconstrained, unitedly, unanimously, instinctively, to pay.\r\n\r\n    \"Little heeds he what is said;\r\n    They have done with all below;\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the commonplaces of the old theology founded on the notion\r\nof a senseless rest of the dead, or their departure to an infinite\r\ndistance from our earthly abode. But we reconsider such views. He, who\r\nwas so sensitive to his fellow-citizens' regard, can hardly be\r\ninsensible now, or unconscious of our sincere honor. I would speak as\r\nin his presence and to his ear! His clear voice will be no longer\r\nheard in our assemblies, or his commanding form cast its welcome\r\nshadow through our streets.\r\n\r\nBut the moral stature, with which, as in mental height, he transcended\r\nthe common sons of men, shall be seen and felt.\r\n\r\nNor can the recollection for ages pass how, as a brave knight, with\r\nsuperb courage, horsed on ideas for the saving of the land, he flung\r\ndefiance from boldness unsurpassed at the giant wrong,--that dragon\r\nand old serpent, the form Satan took for us, the _Barbarism of\r\nSlavery_, and _Slavery sectional not national_, as he entitled the\r\ngreatest speeches he made. His somewhat artificial manner, method, and\r\nphrase only clothed or cloaked an indigenous force of conscience,\r\nwhich was a piece of nature, a divine monolith or monogram, if his\r\nintellect were not. His meaning no man, white or black, in the land\r\ndoubted or could misunderstand.\r\n\r\nIf his forensic efforts had been to a nice taste better in some\r\nrespects, the improvement might have made them in others for general\r\neffect worse or of less effect. They were at least faithfully prepared\r\nfrom a width of observation and stock of information seldom equalled,\r\nand set forth with a consecutive order of formal logic worthy of a\r\nmaster in the schools.\r\n\r\nTwice has been his conspicuous entry into this town: first, after he\r\nwas outraged for his freedom of utterance in his place; next,\r\nyesterday, in whatever connection the spirit may have with the\r\nforsaken robe which it cannot desert or lose all feeling for at once.\r\n\r\nHow, but as a man of principle, shall he stand for-ever in our memory\r\nand in the human mind? Let his name, like that of Washington, be a\r\nlasting rebuke to venality, selfish ambition, bribery, and all\r\npolitical intrigue! He is one more added to the band of blessed bigots\r\nwhich, wiser than any conformists, all our pilgrim fathers were.\r\n\r\n\"You can rest soon,\" he said to the familiar friend and companion in\r\nclerkly labor who was rubbing the hands fast growing cold in death. No\r\nchafing can restore what turns to the clay of which it was made. The\r\nflowers you form into his name will fade, but to cherish his honor we\r\nwill never cease. Let his body be \"buried in peace: his name liveth\r\nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Will chloroform make the operation less beneficial?\" he asked. \"I\r\ncould not lie,\" said the Doctor, \"and said, Yes.\"--\"Then I will not\r\ntake it,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
