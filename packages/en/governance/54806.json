BRANCH.\r\n\r\n       In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n             States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Life of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWestport, Connecticut,—that he boarded at No. 24 Bleecker street, with\r\nMrs. Mallory, and that he was a clerk for Perkins, Hopkins, and White,\r\nin Pearl street, near Hanover Square. I carried some beautiful books to\r\nhis place of business, and requested him to accept them. He sweetly\r\nsmiled, and opened the books, and warmly thanked me, and said he would\r\nbe pleased to receive them, but that as I was a stranger, he would\r\nrather I would see his guardian, Morris Ketchum, a Banker in Wall\r\nstreet, and give him my name and address, and if he were satisfied with\r\nmy references, and approved of his acceptance of the generous gift, he\r\nwould be most happy to receive the books. I was fascinated with his\r\nmodesty, and caution, and I took the books, and repaired to the Banking\r\nHouse of Mr. Ketchum, to whom I briefly imparted what had transpired,\r\nand left my references and departed, and called again, when Mr. Ketchum\r\nsaid that he had inquired respecting my character, and that young Jesup\r\nwas prepared to receive my books, which I soon placed in his hands, and\r\nour acquaintance began under the most favorable auspices. I soon invited\r\nhim to dine with me at Mrs. Tripler’s, when all the boarders were\r\nenchanted with his beautiful person, and pleasing manners, and highly\r\ncultivated mind; and I shall never forget how proud I was, as he sat\r\nbeside me. After dinner, I invited him to my room, where I gave him cake\r\nand lemonade, and filled his pockets with delicious oranges. I then\r\nplayed “Washington’s March,” “Yankee Doodle,” and “Hail Columbia,” for\r\nhim on the piano, and he departed for his place of business. He went\r\nwith me to Niblo’s Garden, then in its glory, and as we strolled\r\narm-in-arm in the meandering paths, and inhaled the exhilarating perfume\r\nof the flowers, I was charmed with his chaste society, and enraptured\r\nand inspired, and I breathed the music of language in his ears, and we\r\nboth were invested with the purest and loftiest and happiest emotions.\r\nIn a week from that joyous evening, he was seized with bleeding of the\r\nlungs, caused by excited feelings, during his enthusiastic efforts to\r\nplease his employers, in the sleepless business season of early autumn.\r\nHe was borne to his mother’s abode in the country, where he soon calmly\r\nresigned his soul to the Saviour, whose sacred virtues he had always\r\nstrove to imitate. Although I had briefly enjoyed the pleasure of his\r\nsociety, yet his premature demise created a void in my bosom that made\r\nthe world a desolation. His mother soon removed to New York, and\r\noccupied No. 39 Bond street, where I gratuitously taught her children in\r\nEnglish and the classics. But the invisible germ of consumption has\r\nborne to the grave her pure, intelligent, and lovely Caroline, Charles,\r\nRichard, and Frederick, and Morris, Arthur, Samuel, and Sarah anticipate\r\nthe same remorseless destiny. And may God cheer and bless their mother\r\nin her loneliness and tears. The father of this interesting and\r\nunfortunate family, was prostrated in the commercial crash of 1837, and\r\nhis depressed and spotless soul fled for refuge to the bosom of his God.\r\nMorris Ketchum was his early business associate and friend, and has\r\neducated his children, procured them lucrative clerkships, afforded them\r\nfacilities to visit nearly every nation, for health and general culture,\r\nestablished them in houses of commerce, and has clung to them, in sun\r\nand storm, like Pythias to Damon, and like Washington to his country. At\r\nthis period of my eventful career, I taught colored and Irish servants,\r\nand those of all countries, in their kitchens in the evening, and\r\nsometimes by daylight. Some paid me one shilling a lesson, and some two,\r\naccording to their wages and generosity. I taught the servants of the\r\nReverend Doctor Wainright, the Reverend Doctor Orville Dewey, Daniel\r\nLord, James T. Brady, Mr. Bowen, of Brooklyn, (of the firm of Bowen &\r\nMcNamee, of New York,) and the servants of other distinguished citizens.\r\nI obtained scholars by going from door to door, in the basement, and\r\nasking the servants if they would like to learn to spell, read, write,\r\nand cipher. My health had been miserable since I left Columbian College,\r\nand I often expected to fall dead in the street, or suddenly expire in\r\nthe presence of my pupils. For a long period after young Jesup died, I\r\nwas very gloomy, and became utterly helpless and bed-ridden, and called\r\noftener on my father for money than I desired, to pay for board and\r\nmedical attendance. I got better, and crawled out into the open air, and\r\nwent in pursuit of scholars in a snow storm. I began at the Battery, and\r\napplied at every door, until I came to No. 70 Greenwich street, when I\r\nwas asked to come in and warm myself, by a daughter of the lady of the\r\nhouse, who kept boarders. After a long conversation, by a cheerful fire,\r\nI was engaged to teach the daughter in the English branches, for my\r\nbreakfast and tea, and a very small dark room as a place of lodging,\r\nwhich I could not conveniently occupy without a candle in the day time.\r\nHumble as were to be my accommodations, my feelings were extremely\r\nbuoyant, and my ghastly form trembled with delight at my unexpected\r\nresurrection from the depths of indigence and despair. Mr. Ditchett,\r\n(subsequently a very efficient Captain of the Fourth Ward Police, and a\r\nbrave fireman, and an honest man,) had just married the eldest daughter,\r\nwhose sister was to be my pupil. I was kindly treated, and remained\r\nuntil the first of May, when I went to Dey street, and afterwards to the\r\nGraham House, at No. 63 Barclay street, where I saw the lean Horace\r\nGreeley, one of the founders of the Graham System. The boarders were\r\nmostly skeletons, and several were limping about the house, like frogs\r\nor lizzards or grasshoppers, and among the limpers, was Horace Greeley,\r\nwho had what the Grahamites called a boiling crisis, or crisis of boils,\r\nwhich was the result of youthful indiscretion, shower bathing, and\r\neating heartily of bran bread, mush and molasses, squashes, turnips,\r\nbeets, carrots, parsneps, and onions, for a long term of years. Although\r\nI had been a miserable invalid a large portion of my days, yet I fancied\r\na speedy restoration to health, by eating unbolted wheat bread and\r\nvegetables, and frequent bathing. I entered into a spirited conversation\r\nwith Greeley, who was reclining on the sofa, and in a loquacious mood,\r\nwho told me that he expected to be quite smart after the disappearance\r\nof a large number of boils then all over his person, which he attributed\r\nto salt rheum, that he inherited from his father, and which was recently\r\ndriven to the surface of his skin by a rigid adherence to the Graham\r\nSystem, and three shower baths a day; and he advised me to begin to\r\nbathe immediately, and to eat nothing but Graham bread for one month,\r\nwith warm water, milk, and sugar. I asked Greeley if he was sure it was\r\nthe secondary or inherited salt rheum that had come to the surface of\r\nhis snowy flesh in the form of boils, and he said he was quite sure it\r\nwas, as his father had it from his boyhood. I asked him if his secondary\r\nor inherited salt rheum ever itched, and he said yes, sometimes, but he\r\nwas sure it was not the secondary itch, as he never had the first itch.\r\nI then looked him dead in the eye, and asked him if he was positively\r\nsure his boils were not the result of itch, and he asked me what I meant\r\nby such severity of scrutiny. I replied, that I once had the itch, and\r\nread many books on the subject, and knew all about it, and that his\r\nboils (he had two on his pale nose) looked very much like secondary itch\r\nblossoms. He cast searching glances, and sat in paralytic silence, save\r\nwhen he scratched his boils, and the bell summoned me to my first Graham\r\ndinner, and Greeley hopped to the table on one leg, and sat near Mrs.\r\nGoss at the head of the Graham festive board. About forty skeletons were\r\npresent, and among them were Sylvester Graham (Bread,) himself, on a\r\nlecturing tour from his country seat at Northampton; John McCracken, of\r\nNew Haven; Ralph Waldo Emerson; Abby Kelly; Fred Douglas and lady;\r\nFrancis Copcutt, mahogany dealer, who used to eat raw oats, and ride 30\r\nmiles a day on a hard trotting horse for dyspepsia; Jeremiah O.\r\nLanphear, tailor, and now first deacon and missionary of the Fulton\r\nstreet Dutch Presbyterian Church, who had a gravel nearly as large as\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott’s, which was the largest that ever emanated from\r\na human bladder; Mrs. Farnham, the accomplished lady and genuine\r\nphilanthropist, and wife of the noble and famous California traveler,\r\nwho was the rival of Fremont as a mountaineer; Mrs. Anna Stephens, the\r\nfertile and genial authoress; the celebrated Doctor Shew and lady; Mrs.\r\nStorms, of Troy, and long a writer and foreign correspondent of the _New\r\nYork Sun_, and now of Texas; poor MacDonald Clark, the poet; Galutia B.\r\nSmith; Matthew B. Brady, the daguerreotypist, who married his sweetheart\r\nat the Graham House, and the room being crowded, I saw the exercises\r\nthrough the key hole; Mrs. Travis; Albert Brisbane, a moonlight dreamer;\r\nMrs. Andrews, a strong Unitarian, (ninety-eight years old,) and her\r\ngrandson, Albert L. Smith, a nervous and catarrhal gentleman, who now\r\nkeeps a Graham House and Water Cure Establishment in West Washington\r\nPlace; Dr. John Burdell, brother of Dr. Harvey Burdell, who was\r\nassasinated at No. 31 Bond Street; Leroy Sunderland, a Mesmeriser and\r\nPathetic lecturer; John M. King; George Foss; Dr. Henry W. Brown; E.\r\nGould Buffum, and his brother, William Buffum, now Consul at _Trieste_;\r\nMrs. Horace Greeley; Mr. Clutz; Mrs. Van Vleet; Messrs. Tyler, Bennett,\r\n(a tailor), Otis, and Ward; Mrs. Gove; C. Edwards Lester; Mr. Danforth,\r\na spurious reformer; the brothers Fowler, phrenologists; father Miller,\r\nthe Millenium impostor; Mr. Seymour, a journeyman hatter at Beebe’s, who\r\ngot among the noisy methodists, who frightened him into a dangerous\r\nnervous affection, and in bed one night, poor Seymour felt cold and\r\nstrange and numb, and pinched himself in the arms and legs, and it\r\ndidn’t hurt him, and he thought he was dead, and he got up, and kindled\r\na match, and lit a candle, and looked in the glass to see whether he was\r\ndead or alive, and when he saw his eyes roll, and his jaws open and\r\nclose, he got into bed, and went to sleep. This was the gang at table,\r\nand for dinner, we had bran bread and crackers, bean soup, roast apples\r\nand potatoes, and boiled squash and carrots, but not a particle of meat,\r\ngrease, nor spices. All grabbed violently at the Graham viands, and\r\nbrought their teeth together like swine, and with similar grunts and\r\nsqueals. I calmly surveyed the motley and hungry group, and saw many\r\nsmall piercing gray eyes, hollow cheeks, and sharp chins and noses, and\r\nthe voices of nearly all were husky and fearfully sepulchral. The themes\r\ndiscussed were Anti-Slavery and Grahamism, and I soon perceived it\r\nextremely perilous to breathe a word against the ultra views of the\r\nsusceptible and long-haired Graham spectres, who seemed united to a\r\nghost on these prolific themes. So, I listened and breathed not a\r\nsyllable in opposition to the crazy views advanced. I took a stroll\r\nafter dinner, and returned at sunset, and seated myself for my evening\r\nmeal, when we had Graham-bread-coffee, milk porridge, apple sauce,\r\nGraham mush, and boiled rice, sparingly saturated with molasses and\r\nliquid ginger. I ate and drank freely of this light food, and arose from\r\nthe table in excellent spirits, though I belched frequently. My belly\r\nsoon began to swell, and I got alarmed, and I asked Mr. Goss, the Graham\r\nhost, what it meant. He seemed perfectly cool, and said that his\r\nboarders were often affected in that way, in passing suddenly from\r\ngreasy meats to the pure food of Grahamites, which was chiefly of a\r\nvegetable and somewhat of a gassy and flatulent character. Goss then\r\nleft me. I thrice paced the parlor hurriedly, and began to feel choleric\r\nand crampy, and went down stairs into the kitchen, and asked Goss to\r\nsend for a physician immediately, which he declined to do, as he thought\r\nI was only a little spleeny, which would soon pass away, and advised me\r\nto go to bed. He got me a Graham candle, and up we went, and did not\r\nstop until we reached the roof, where he put me in a little room, with\r\ntwo cots, on which there was a straw mattress, and a straw bolster, and\r\nscanty covering. He said good night, and shut the door, and I got into\r\nbed, and strove to sleep. I squirmed like an eel for about two hours,\r\nand could endure my pains no longer, and arose and awoke my room-mate,\r\nand asked him to escort me to the sleeping apartment of Mr. Goss. He did\r\nso, and I knocked at his door, and out he came in his nightcap and white\r\napparel. I told him that I had cramps, and had an awful quantity of\r\nfrantic wind in my stomach, and felt as though my belly would burst\r\nbefore morning, and that I was deathly sick, and asked him what on earth\r\nI had eaten at his table to give me such violent cramps and flatulence\r\nand diarrhœa, and nauseous and strange emotions. He told me that I was\r\nnervous, and not accustomed to Graham food, but that I soon would be,\r\nand urged me to again retire, and strive to sleep. He spoke these words\r\nwith kindness, and they soothed me, and I shook his hand, and off I went\r\nup stairs to bed again. But in about ten minutes, I had a severe spasm,\r\nwith choking sensations, and I leaped from my nest like a man in his\r\nlast gasp, and unconsciously cast myself on the cot of my room-mate, who\r\ninstantly emerged from a profound sleep, and sprang like a tiger from\r\nhis bed, and threw me severely to the floor, and cried murder to the\r\npinnacle of his voice, and began to pelt me in the most brutal manner,\r\nleveling the most savage random blows at my head and stomach. Goss and\r\nthe spectral boarders rushed into the room, and Greeley soon came\r\nlimping in, and they searched in vain for knives, revolvers, and human\r\nblood. And they soon learned the cause of the cry of murder, and raised\r\nme from the floor, and put me into bed, with a bloody nose and dark eye,\r\nthat my room-mate gave me, who apologised for his blows on the ground\r\nthat he always slept soundly, and was only partially awake when he beat\r\nme. I accepted his apology, and Goss and Greeley, and half-a-dozen\r\nattenuated Grahamites left me, for their beds again, and my chum took a\r\nseat by my cot, and strove to soothe me. But the cramps returned, and I\r\nbecame faint and giddy, and began to vomit profusely. I soon filled\r\nbasins, pitchers, spit boxes, hats, and boots, and deluged every thing\r\nwe had in the room, and my chum got a pitcher and basin in the next\r\nroom, and I soon flooded them, and I vomited until I thought I felt my\r\nentire bowels struggling at my throat to get out, which nearly strangled\r\nme. At last an enormous chunk came out, which proved to be the core of a\r\nstewed apple, and the crust of Graham bread combined into a sort of\r\npetrified substance, and I began to breathe again, and slowly improved\r\ntill daylight,\r\n\r\n                When I embraced a sweet repose,\r\n                And snored like thunder through my nose.\r\n\r\n                  (To be continued to my last scream.)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H.

At the close of a long and interesting lesson,\r\nSontag opened her great heart to me, and disclosed her career from her\r\nearliest recollection. Her narrative was eloquent and exciting, and as\r\nshe sat before me at the parlor lattice, in alternate tears and smiles,\r\nwith the moon rolling like a ball of silver through the air, she seemed\r\ntoo pure and beautiful for earth. Her tears were the very soul of\r\nsorrow, and none could resist their overwhelming influence,—her smiles\r\nwere irresistibly enchanting,—her voice in conversation was full of\r\nentrancing melody,—her cavern dimples were the emblems of purity and\r\ncharity, and her entire expression was divine. And as her blood warmed,\r\nand her bosom rose and fell, and her voice trembled and darted from the\r\nfaintest whisper to its highest intonation, her glorious eyes reflected\r\ngorgeous temples in her soul, filled with sinless angels, breathing\r\nsweet music to millions of her species. And the beauteous Sontag told\r\nme, as we sat together in our last communion as human pilgrims, that her\r\nchildhood, and girlhood, and early womanhood were all devoted to the\r\ncultivation of music for the enjoyment of the world more than herself,\r\nwhich rendered her early years an utter sacrifice, and had deprived her\r\nof the pastimes enjoyed by all her sex in the morning of life; that from\r\nthe hour she was called “_The little Daughter of the Danube_,” there was\r\nno happiness for her; that she was early beset by lovers from nearly\r\nevery nation of Europe; that kings and queens lavished their choicest\r\ntreasures upon her; that princes besought her affections in tearful\r\nsupplications; that all France prostrated herself at her feet; that amid\r\nthe flattery and adulations of all classes and kingdoms, she was\r\ninduced, in a thoughtless hour, to cast herself into the eternal\r\nembraces of a being who proved a jealous and savage tyrant, and a\r\nheartless gamester; that ere her emergence from the brief hours of bliss\r\nthat should follow the marriage vow, he became odious in her eyes, and\r\nshe beheld a life of misery in all her future; that after years of\r\ntorture in his demon fangs, and after he had squandered her splendid\r\nfortune of four millions of dollars, he dragged her from the sacred\r\nprecincts of private life, and from the pleasing society of her\r\nchildren, into the public arena, to toil for his subsistence; that he\r\nforced her to exchange hemispheres, and leave her tender offspring, when\r\nthey most required a mother’s protection; that he often brandished a\r\ndagger in her eyes, when she refused to fill his purse for bibbling and\r\ngaming purposes; that she was in fear of his poignard throughout her\r\nlong confinement in his hideous clutches; that for his traduction and\r\npersecution of Alboni in her early years, she resolved to pursue her to\r\nAmerica to annoy, and, if possible, ruin her, for his sake, by singing\r\nagainst her in the leading cities; that on the very day she publicly\r\nannounced her intention to visit America, Alboni went to the Cathedral,\r\nand knelt at the altar, and swore that she would pursue her through all\r\nlatitudes, and cut the grass beneath her feet, to avenge herself on\r\nCount Rossi, who strove to blight the buds and blossoms of her youth and\r\nindigence; that she kept her oath, and followed her through city, town,\r\nand village, and allured her choristers, through extravagant salaries\r\nand donations, and sang on the evenings of her Concert and Opera\r\nentertainments, and greatly reduced her receipts; that Rossi seized her\r\nfunds, as they accrued, and deposited them in banks unknown to her; that\r\nher children often wrote in vain for means to defray their domestic\r\nexpenses; that Rossi, and Maretzek, and Ullman received all the benefit\r\nof her arduous labors; that her lovely daughters were in the care of\r\nstrangers in Europe, and exposed to all the snares of life; that their\r\neducation was fatally neglected in her absence; that she was a slave to\r\nRossi, Maretzek, and Ullman, all of whom she thoroughly despised, and\r\nthat she had very seriously contemplated suicide. And thus did this\r\ncelestial being breathe her pensive music in my soul, and bathe my\r\nvision with nature’s hallowed waters. And amid our mutual tears, and\r\nsmiles, and cheerful tones, and lingering glances, she enters the dismal\r\ncars, and the bell proclaims the parting signal, and she penetrates the\r\ndeep perspective, until she is forever buried from my melancholy view.\r\nShe gives concerts on the borders of the northern lakes, and visits\r\nCincinnati, and quarrels and separates from Ullman, and goes to New\r\nOrleans, and performs in Opera, and enters Mexico, amid the revengeful\r\nmaledictions of Ullman, who, as Rocco told me, dug her early grave, by\r\narousing the fearful jealousy of Rossi, to whom Ullman wrote from New\r\nYork, that he would find letters in her trunk from Pozzolini, the young\r\nand fascinating tenor; that Rossi did find letters in her trunk from\r\nPozzolini, (filled with the most enthusiastic love,) which Rocco said\r\nwere doubtless placed there by Ullman, prior to her departure for\r\nMexico, to revenge himself on Sontag, for her refusal at Cincinnati to\r\ngive more Concerts under his direction; that Rossi belched words of\r\nfire, and threatened her with instant death; that herself and Pozzolini\r\nwere seized with violent pains, on their return from the Mexican\r\nfestivals; that during her confinement, Rocco daily called, but was not\r\npermitted to see her; that Rossi paced the balcony as a sentinel for\r\ndays and nights, and would let no one visit her; that he permitted Rocco\r\nto enter her apartment only one hour before she died, when he found her\r\nin the wildest delirium. And Rocco told me that Sontag and Pozzolini\r\nwere doubtless poisoned by Count Rossi, and that Ullman was the\r\ninstigator. Rossi artfully attributed their sudden death to cholera, but\r\nthe rumor flew on the wings of lightning, that Rossi was their murderer,\r\nand he fled for his life to New York, with all her jewels, and went to\r\nEurope. And Rocco sorely grieved to see her borne to her sepulchre\r\nwithout kindred mourners in a far distant land; and when he saw her form\r\nexhumed, and borne through mud and stones, and deposited as luggage in\r\nthe filthy suburbs of Vera Cruz, and exposed for weeks to the heat and\r\nrain of those withering latitudes,—when he gazed at the remains of a\r\nbeing who had been the pride and glory and adoration of all civilised\r\nnations, and who had long been his own dear friend, poor Rocco\r\nprostrated himself beside her coffin, and wept for hours in loneliness\r\nand utter desolation. And now, dear Sontag, I can see thy pure and\r\ngenial spirit in its happy home, beyond the pretty stars. And while I\r\nindite these melancholy words, thy sweet face smiles upon me from my\r\nparlor wall, as you appeared in the immortal _Somnambulist_. It is the\r\nlikeness you gave me at our final interview, and represents _Amina_, in\r\nthe joyous bridal scene with _Elvino_, among her native cottagers in the\r\nmountains. All! Sontag! I often think of thee, and my highest solace is\r\nin gazing at thy bewitching smile, and laughing eyes, and lovely\r\ndimples, and even teeth, and classic temples, as depicted in thy\r\nlikeness, which I shall keep while I linger in the dreary paths of\r\nearth. And I will part with fame and fortune and with life itself, ere I\r\nwill separate from the precious picture of my adored Sontag.

Sit down, Johnny, and try on the shoes.\r\n\r\n_John_ (puts them on)—They are much too large, aint they?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Well, yes, but if you put some pieces of newspaper in them,\r\nyou can lessen their size.\r\n\r\n_John_ (stuffs them in the heels and toes and sides with fragments of\r\nthe _Herald_ of the preceding day)—There, sir, I guess I can wear them\r\nnow, and I am truly obliged to you for borrowing them for me.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Not at all, John, for you did more than that for me yesterday,\r\nin obtaining my papers from Mr. Anderson.\r\n\r\n_John_ (in hurriedly walking across the office, steps out of one of the\r\naged shoes, but steps in again before Bennett’s keen eyes perceived that\r\none foot had stepped out)—That was a great pleasure, sir, and I hope you\r\nwill have the same good luck to-day.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I sold very few papers yesterday, and I have very little\r\nmoney, and Anderson has my watch, and I fear he will not let me have the\r\npapers until I redeem it, and pay him for the _Heralds_ of to-day.\r\n\r\n_John_—I will do all in my power to obtain them for you.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I know you will, my dear little friend. But come—we will go\r\nand try to get the papers. (They arrive at Anderson & Ward’s, in Ann\r\nstreet. Anderson is absent, and Ward is partially drunk and asleep on\r\nthe counter, and Bennett arouses him.)\r\n\r\n_Ward_—What are you about? (rubbing his eyes and garrping.) What do you\r\nwant (hic) so early in the morning, you vagabonds? hic, hec, hoc.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I want my papers.\r\n\r\n_Ward_—You can’t (hic) have them without the money, (hoc.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Please let me have them.\r\n\r\n_Ward_—Where’s your (hic) watch?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I let Mr. Anderson have it yesterday.\r\n\r\n_Ward_—Don’t you (hic-a-che-a-che-Horatio-darn it, how I sneeze) sell\r\nany _Heralds_ now-a-days? a-che-a-che-a-che-Horatio—O, Jerusalem! will I\r\nnever stop sneezing?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—It stormed yesterday, and I did not sell many, but it is\r\npleasant this morning, and I think I shall sell a large number.\r\n\r\n_Ward_—Well, I’ll not be (hic, hic, hic,) too hard with you, old fellow.\r\nThere, take your papers, and try hard (hic) to sell (hic) them to-day,\r\nand (hic-a-che) bring a whole lot of money to (hic) morrow.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I will, Mr. Ward, and I’ll always remember you with gratitude\r\nfor your generosity to-day. Good day, sir.\r\n\r\n_Ward_—Farewell, old boy. And just shut the door alter you. I have been\r\n(hic) on a spree all night, (hec,) and I don’t want anybody else to come\r\nin and bother (hic) me, until I finish my nap.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I’ll lock the door outside, and put the key in the window.\r\n\r\n_Ward_—Do so, old (hic) boy, do so. (And he goes to sleep, and Bennett\r\nand John wend their way to Wall street.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Now, John, this is the last chance I shall have. If I fail to\r\nsell my papers to-day, I am ruined for ever.\r\n\r\n_John_—Had I not better go into the stores, and try to sell the papers.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (kisses him in Nassau street)—My dear boy, if you will do\r\nthat, I will love you next to my God. My great trouble has been to get\r\nhonest boys to sell my paper, and return the money to me, instead of\r\ngoing to the Theatre and eating peanuts with my funds. Now, you take\r\nsome, and I’ll take some, and you take one side of the street and I the\r\nother, and let us toil for our lives (until the sun goes down) to sell\r\nthese papers, and, if we fail, my fate is sealed for time, and perhaps\r\nfor eternity!\r\n\r\n_John_—What! You won’t commit suicide?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—God only knows what I shall do.\r\n\r\n_John_—Well, I see there’s no time to be lost. So, give me some papers,\r\nand I’ll go into the first store on this side, and you take the other\r\nside of the street. (They separate, John going into every store on his\r\nside, and Bennett into every store on the other side, until they arrive\r\nat Wall street, when they go into Bennett’s office, in the old rat hole\r\nat No. 20 Wall street, where they count their pennies, and find that\r\nthey have sold quite a large number of _Heralds_. They then drink some\r\nwater and eat some ginger nuts, for their breakfasts, and go down Broad\r\nstreet, and enter every store on either side, and meet with great\r\nsuccess. John then takes South street, and Bennett Front street, from\r\nthe Battery to Fulton street, and afterwards take Water and Pearl\r\nstreets, and then they canvass either side of Wall street, and sell all\r\ntheir _Heralds_, and go to a Restaurant and get something to eat, and\r\nseparate in the afternoon in high spirits. John then got some boys in\r\nthe Fourteenth Ward to sell the _Herald_, and in ten days Bennett had\r\nabout $40 surplus, and begins to put on aristocratic airs, and domineer\r\nover Johnny Kelly.)\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _For the Alligator._\r\n\r\n\r\n                Wide-mouth shocking Alligator!\r\n                I wish you were a Boa Constrictor!\r\n                And crush within your awful fold,\r\n                The villains with our pilfered gold,\r\n                Who, with sanctimonious face,\r\n                Steal with such a pious grace:\r\n                They dance and dress and call it good,\r\n                Because it gives the hungry food.\r\n                But hold your mirror to their face,\r\n                And show them their sad black disgrace:\r\n                One robs the City’s golden coffers,\r\n                And then a mighty Fabric offers,\r\n                And tries to court a worldly fame,\r\n                Out of such an impious shame.\r\n                The temple thus to science rears,\r\n                That he may surely soothe his fears,\r\n                Lest his ignorance should be known,\r\n                And lack of knowledge shown,\r\n                And so the starving, suffering poor,\r\n                He drives them fainting from his door;\r\n                And tells them: (Oh! how very strange!)\r\n                The Mansion’s taken all his change!\r\n                And in his high, majestic wrath,\r\n                He kicks a female down to earth!\r\n                The mansion he will never give,\r\n                While one heir of his shall live.\r\n                See how this modern Simon Magus,\r\n                Blinds our eyes, and then deceives us.\r\n                Soon we shall see how very funny,\r\n                He’ll make his “Union” yield him money:\r\n                He finds it is so very pretty,\r\n                To have a Mayor made of putty,\r\n                That he can mould him at his will,\r\n                To make his son an office fill.\r\n                But lest Columbia prove too new,\r\n                He lays a wire the ocean through,\r\n                That he all Europe may invite,\r\n                To bask in his resplendent sight.\r\n                Oh! most happy England Queen,\r\n                When she can say: “I’ve Peter seen!”\r\n                Now see him cringe, and jump for fame,\r\n                To reach the scroll, to write his name:\r\n                But as he lives alone for fame,\r\n                My verse will sure preserve his name.\r\n\r\n                                                       PETER PIPER PICT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                NEW YORK, June 15, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H. BRANCH:\r\n\r\nSIR:—Permit me the privilege of making a few brief passing remarks,\r\nasking a few questions, and respectfully suggesting a few hints as to\r\nyour weekly publication, the ALLIGATOR. Please to attribute any\r\nintrusive errors in this communication as emanating from an inefficient\r\nmethod of expressing my sentiments, as my heart is with you whole and\r\nentire in spirit, and, with a few exceptions, to the very letter, in\r\nyour laudable endeavor to bring to light before the open day the hidden\r\nvillainies of the many detestable tyrants that have risen from the very\r\nscum of poverty and criminal degradation, and who now so unaccountably\r\nhold despotic sway _under the garb of honorable industry_ in every\r\nbranch of society, to the unjust injury and oppression of the poor,\r\nhumble, but honest man.\r\n\r\nI am rejoiced to find the ALLIGATOR creeping its way to the literary\r\ntables of almost every respectable News Depot in this and the adjacent\r\ncities, piercing its deadly fangs into the very vitals of every\r\ninfluential thief and scoundrel, and that the business public are now\r\navailing themselves of the opportunity in patronising it as an\r\nadvertising medium, and I sincerely wish you every success.\r\n\r\nWherever I have an opportunity, I endeavor, indirectly, to pave the way,\r\nto introduce the merits of the ALLIGATOR, and, as a matter of course,\r\nhave to give and take in the various opinions expressed as to the\r\ncarniverous propensities of that astonishing animal, and the choice\r\nobjects it pitches into for its daily food. The opinions and ideas\r\nexpressed on the subject are as varied as the colors in the rainbow. Any\r\nman whose past misdeeds trouble his conscience, dreads the animal, as he\r\nwould a drawn sword, lest its brutal tusks should tear open to public\r\ngaze what he had secretly hoped was unknown to mortal being.\r\n\r\nIf the crawling reptiles you select to satisfy the craving appetite of\r\nthat amphibious animal (with such extended jaws continually gaping) are\r\nreally of such an abhorrent and loathsome nature as represented by you\r\nin such bold relief, I should never cease lashing their diseased and\r\nulcerated carcases with whips of poisoned scorpions, till I purged and\r\npurified their polluted system with wholesome antidotes. It strikes me\r\nthat your gormandising hydra-headed monster can never be satisfied with\r\ncommon carrion: it seeks for something more nutritious for its\r\nsustenance. It appears he is like Pharoah’s lean kine—the more he\r\ndevours, the thinner he gets, and his rapacity increases, and what seems\r\nso singular is, that he has abundance of choice prey for ever at his\r\nside, which he selects indiscriminately, and an untold amount laid up in\r\nhis store houses for ages to come.\r\n\r\nNothing do I admire more than the free use of strong and emphatic\r\nlanguage to express our approbation or disapprobation of men’s actions\r\npublic or private, and from the general tenor of your style, and the\r\npeculiar advantages you possess as a scholar, and the unlimited\r\ninformation you have treasured up as a man of experience, with regard to\r\npublic characters and measures, I feel confident that you can convert\r\nevery tooth of the Alligator into a poisoned arrow that will deal death\r\nand destruction into every particle of air whereever it wings its\r\nflight, and you can more effectively hit your mark with surer certainty\r\nby avoiding the use of such terms and phrases as would be looked upon by\r\nthe general class of readers, as rather coarse or vulgar; although I\r\nmyself consider your style as purely hieroglyphic, and that your\r\nsarcastic way merely emanates from a proud, manly, straightforward, bold\r\nand independent above board kind of a spirit than that of malice, with\r\nthe view to convey the sentiments of your mind, in order to express your\r\nstrong feeling of detestation and abhorrence of every unprincipled\r\nscoundrel, against whom your fiery shafts of indignation may happen to\r\nbe turned, cutting to the very heart’s core like a two edged sword.\r\n\r\nThe body of the ALLIGATOR is too small by a long shot. It would greatly\r\nenhance its usefulness by being more liberal. Increase its pages, extend\r\nits columns, devote a space to correspondents, and, if need be, stretch\r\nits stomach so as to afford an opportunity to others to open their\r\nstore-houses, and contribute their quota of similar wholesome food to\r\nthe hungry cannibal, in order the better to assist in the process of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours Respectfuly,\r\n\r\n                                                          ANTI-TYRANT.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!
