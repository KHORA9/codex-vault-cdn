In\r\nthe morning I had mass said in my chapel for the late M. de Quélen,\r\nand shed heartfelt tears during the service. In the evening my son\r\nAlexander, my son-in-law and Pauline gave us some music. They sang\r\nvaudevilles and mimicked characters with a vivacity which delighted\r\nme, as I am always afraid that they may be bored here, though I admit\r\nthat their frame of mind was in complete contrast to my own. On the\r\nstroke of midnight punch was served; some tears fell into my glass\r\nwhen I thought of those with whom I had so often spent this\r\nanniversary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 2, 1841._--M. de Salvandy writes to me as follows\r\nconcerning the reception of M. Molé at the Academy: \"M. Molé spoke to\r\na magnificent audience. He was seated between M. de Royer Collard and\r\nM. de Chateaubriand; on this occasion the latter broke his usual\r\ncustom of avoiding public appearances. It was a special honour, either\r\nto M. Molé or to the memory of the late archbishop. The highest\r\nsociety from the Faubourg Saint Germain were there, in fact all the\r\nspecial friends of M. Molé and everybody who can be called anybody\r\nnowadays. M. Molé was continually applauded, and his cleverness, his\r\ntaste and courageous speaking well deserved this reward. He gave a\r\nfair and respectful account of this pure and noble character and\r\nspoke of M. de Quélen without concessions or reticence or\r\nconsideration for his own position. His ambition seems to have burnt\r\nits boats, with such enthusiasm did he speak of old time manners and\r\nsociety and so warmly did he emphasise the ideas and principles of\r\ngood order. He only touched upon present times to utter a eulogy upon\r\nthe King, and you know that present times are not agreeable to him. I\r\nwas especially struck by the vigorous approval of the audience; it was\r\na public rehabilitation of the persecuted Prelate and the canonisation\r\nof his memory by a layman before a public which was not entirely\r\nsympathetic or legitimist; for there was a lively manifestation of\r\napproval at certain passages in Dupin's reply, opposing the\r\nRestoration and the Englishman. Dupin's answer was quite\r\ncharacteristic, and I need say no more of it. M. Guizot and M. Thiers\r\nseem to have foreseen the success of M. Molé, for they did not appear\r\nand their absence was widely commented upon. In short, this session\r\nhas greatly raised M. Molé in the opinion and esteem of right-minded\r\npeople, but it has been in particular a great day for the memory of\r\nthe Archbishop, for his family and his friends, and for those who felt\r\nhis blessing as he was at the point of death. For this reason I\r\nhasten, Madame, to give you an account of it, as by this means I can\r\nrealise its meaning more exactly and more deeply than if I had merely\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\"M. Guizot has informed me of the nature of the despatches received\r\nfrom St. Petersburg, from Vienna and from London, which are in all\r\nrespects excellent. There is a desire to bring France back to the\r\nconcert of Europe, a readiness to make advances and to seek means and\r\nopportunity. Peace is restored and I should be inclined to say, more\r\nthan peace.\"\r\n\r\nI am delighted at M. Molé's success which I foretold to him when he\r\nread me his speech at Paris in September; and am delighted not only on\r\nhis account, but also because he has done something to restore the\r\nreputation of this holy Archbishop, who was so misjudged during his\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 3, 1841._--Yesterday I received many letters from\r\nParis which repeat practically what M. de Salvandy wrote concerning M.\r\nMolé's speech at the Academy. M. Dupin seems to have been quite\r\nunspeakable, and in short, entirely himself; M. Royer Collard grumbled\r\nthroughout his speech and said, \"This speech is sheer carnage.\" In\r\nfact the dead lay in heaps beneath Dupin's destroying charge.\r\nNoticeable were the thunders of applause when he inveighed against the\r\nrevelation of state secrets, a direct thrust at M. Molé; but a most\r\ndramatic point, I am told, was Dupin's gesture in recalling the fact\r\nthat a Molé, as an alderman of Troyes, had helped Charles VII. to\r\ndrive out the English. His gesture and pose called forth repeated\r\nbursts of applause. Fortunately the diplomatic body were not present.\r\nIt is a strange sight to see Dupin inveighing against the coalition of\r\nwhich he was a member.\r\n\r\nM. Molé should be fully satisfied with his triumph, which has been\r\ncomplete, striking, brilliant and unusual. On this question M. Royer\r\nCollard writes as follows:--\"No doubt more than one correspondent has\r\ntold you of M. Molé's triumph, for such was the nature of his success,\r\nbefore a numerous and brilliant audience. I was glad to hear the\r\nspeech which you and I have known for some time. If it is not an\r\nartistic production, it is the work of a clever man who has known\r\nbetter times than these and who has retained good traditions. The\r\ndefects were not obvious; his courage appeared so natural that it was\r\nunnoticed; the beauties of it, which were by no means small, were\r\nunderstood and fully appreciated. M. de Quélen has shared the honour\r\nof the day, in truth it is he who has really triumphed, to such an\r\nextent did the audience share this solemn work of rehabilitation. I\r\nsaw the most hard-hearted shedding tears. As M. Affre did not think of\r\nhis predecessor, no one thought of him. M. de Quélen has carried the\r\narchbishopric of Paris to his tomb; there is not and will never be\r\nanother archbishop; this striking and mournful glory is his.\"\r\n\r\nI am extremely delighted at this posthumous triumph, as I have every\r\nreason to be, for I honoured, supported, cared for and perhaps even\r\nconsoled the subject of it during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nM. Molé's speech contains some admirable lines referring to the\r\nCardinal of Périgord.\r\n\r\nBefore sessions of the Academy are held, speeches are by rule examined\r\nby a committee of members who act as censors and decide whether any\r\npassages should be struck out. M. Dupin did not conscientiously carry\r\nout this arrangement and his speech in public was not that which left\r\nthe hands of the committee. It is expected that next Thursday when\r\nthere is a special meeting of the Academy, explanations of the fact\r\nwill be demanded. Mignet, who was present at the public session, is\r\nsaid to have been in a very bad temper and the newspapers of M. Thiers\r\nare preparing to fulminate against Dupin.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mgr. Affre has proposed to change his cathedral\r\nprecentors without calling a meeting of the Chapter; that the Chapter\r\nmet to discuss the question; and that Mgr. Affre, when he heard of it,\r\nmade a great uproar and forbade any meeting unless authorised by\r\nhimself. New Year's Day then arrived. The Chapter have been accustomed\r\nto meet to send congratulations to the Archbishop: his prohibition was\r\npositive; they therefore did not meet, and have not congratulated the\r\nArchbishop. The result will be some new storm, for Mgr. Affre is a\r\nstormy character. The Sacré Cœur had much difficulty in securing\r\npermission to say a mass for Mgr. de Quélen at the end of the year;\r\nhowever, permission was granted, and there was a suffocating crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 5, 1841._--For twenty hours snow has been falling\r\nsteadily. We are absolutely buried under this thick shroud. One might\r\nbe living in the north with all its horrible cold, and it is\r\nimpossible to go out. All communications will be cut off, though the\r\nstorm should last only a few hours. What a winter it is!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 7, 1841._--Yesterday I had a letter from Madame\r\nde Lieven, in which the main points are as follows: \"Things in general\r\nseem to me to be going better, though security is not absolutely\r\ncertain. Have I written to you since the news from St. Petersburg\r\narrived? Do not believe the exaggerations of certain newspapers on the\r\npoint, but believe what is true, that the tone of the last\r\ncommunications is quite proper; that Russia is sincerely anxious to\r\nsee France return to the concert of Europe, and is hoping that the\r\npresent Ministry will remain in office. This demonstration, which\r\nexperts consider to be more friendly than any that has been made at\r\nSt. Petersburg, has caused much pleasure here and some anxiety to the\r\nEnglish. There is no further development at present. At London\r\nattempts are being made to find a point of junction with France which\r\nis everywhere desired. Can you think of one? Jerusalem. Jerusalem\r\ndelivered from the yoke of the infidels! Jerusalem, a Christian town,\r\nopen to all Christian worship; a free town guaranteed as such by\r\nChristianity! What do you think of this? I should much like to see it.\r\nIs it likely that so simple an idea and so easy to perform could be\r\nrejected, for if ever the idea is carried out, it could be to-day.\r\nLord Melbourne will probably laugh at it and Lord Palmerston too.\r\n\r\n\"The opening of Parliament has caused much discussion. It is said that\r\nPeel and the Radicals will easily overthrow the Ministry, but I see no\r\nreason for it at this moment. Time will show.\r\n\r\n\"The Academy meeting caused a twenty-four hours' sensation. M. Molé\r\nenjoyed a great triumph. I was unable to hear his speech and it reads\r\nto me a trifle forced; such is also the impression of many people, and\r\nit has even been called somewhat insignificant. About M. Dupin's\r\nspeech I have nothing to say. From the point of propriety it speaks\r\nfor itself, but it amused me. My taste, however, is not particularly\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will make no mistake about the conclusion of the Egyptian\r\nquestion. Whatever happens, Mehemet Ali will preserve the pashalik as\r\nhereditary in his family; but what a conflict of opinions among the\r\nsailors, the Ambassador and the Minister of Foreign Affairs!\r\n\r\n\"I am told, my dear Duchesse, that the King of Prussia is a little\r\nstrange in his conduct, that the fact is remarked among his people,\r\nthat his popularity is rapidly declining, and that the old King is\r\nmore regretted every day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 12, 1841._--M. de Salvandy writes as follows: \"I\r\nthink that the Powers are seriously looking for an opportunity and an\r\nexcuse to bring us back to the concert of Europe. The declarations of\r\nPrince Metternich; the Russian despatch with its unusual expressions\r\nconcerning the wisdom of the King and his services to Europe, the\r\ndesire to come to an understanding with his Government; and the\r\nsentiments, too, of Prussia, which are more French and less Russian\r\nthan ever, are providing food for reflection in England. Lord\r\nPalmerston is finding his course more difficult than he expected. The\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel will propose amendments; it is\r\nsaid that these amendments will be in favour of France and will pass,\r\nand the Tories seem certain on the point. I cannot believe it. It is\r\nimpossible to think that the real successes of Palmerston throughout\r\nthe Asiatic continent from St. Jean d'Acre as far as China, should\r\nmark the date and the reason of his fall. In any case it is certain\r\nthat England, both as a government and as a nation, is concerned with\r\nthe question of our isolation and of our liberty of action.\r\n\r\n\"Here the question of fortifications takes precedence of everything\r\nelse. It has been simplified by M. Thiers' resolution to make no\r\nproposal without the approval of the Government. He abandons or\r\nmodifies his amendments according to the desires of the Cabinet and so\r\nthe struggle will not be in that direction. Victory or failure will be\r\nshared by MM. Thiers and Guizot. However, by a strange change of\r\nopinion M. Guizot seems to be threatened at the outset of this\r\nproposed plan. MM. de Lamartine, Passy and Dufaure, forty votes on the\r\nLeft, together with Tracy and Garnier-Pagès, in short, fifty votes at\r\nleast will be against the proposal. People are also asking whether\r\nMarshal Soult is not against the idea. His position seems somewhat\r\nobscure. People wonder whether the objections which he offered to the\r\ndetached forts in 1833, to the compromise and the continuous circuit\r\nwalls proposed in 1840, are not more prominent in his mind than any\r\nother interest; whether he does not expect to advance his views by\r\nrejecting half the law which might easily end in the overthrow of the\r\nwhole, and also of the oratorical party in the Cabinet, bound as they\r\nare to support their project in its entirety. People are also\r\nwondering whether this last result is not the object which the\r\nparliamentary strategy of the Marshal has in view. The Prince Royal,\r\nwhom I saw yesterday, seems uneasy on the point. But what then can be\r\nthe idea in the background? Can it be a combination of Passy and\r\nDufaure, with Passy as the Minister of Foreign Affairs? This would be\r\nto restore the Ministry of May 2, which would not act upon the first\r\noccasion and will be no more possible now that it is dead. A\r\ncombination of Soult and Molé is very unlikely; and finally, will M.\r\nMolé come forth from his ruins? All this is very obscure. M. Molé is\r\nvery touchy. There are too many people who would regard adherence as\r\nan honourable confession of error. In any case it is certain that M.\r\nGuizot's prospects are impaired and that even at the Tuileries the\r\nchances of his overthrow are regarded as more probable than they would\r\nformerly have been. It is noticed that he makes no mention of London.\r\nCan he have reached the point when he begins to doubt of success,\r\nthough he never doubted it before, and to consider the possibilities\r\nof a retreat?\r\n\r\n\"Rambuteau yesterday held a house-warming in his new rooms in the\r\nHotel de Ville. They are magnificent and are characterised by\r\nsplendour, luxury and good taste: the paintings, the ornaments and the\r\nfurniture are admirable; it is pleasant to see an object worthy of\r\npraise and since we are now under the electoral _régime_ I am glad to\r\nsee that it can produce something at least that is earmarked by good\r\ntaste and a certain grandeur. It is curious to see the town of Paris\r\ntreat its Prefect in this way. Let us hope that this will pave the way\r\nfor the kings.\r\n\r\n\"M. Pasquier has been greatly disappointed that he has not been\r\nelected to the Academy in place of M. Pastoret. He had great hopes,\r\nbut the candidature of M. de Sainte Aulaire was too well supported. He\r\nis keeping himself for the place held by the Bishop of Hermopolis.[1]\r\nIs it not remarkable, Madame, that at his age a man should think of\r\ninheriting anything, and should still have ambition, holding the rank\r\nhe does?\"\r\n\r\n  [1] The Duc Pasquier was, in fact, elected member of the French\r\n  Academy on February 17, 1842, in place of Mgr. Frayssinous,\r\n  Bishop of Hermopolis (1765-1841), high master of the University,\r\n  who was very ill in January 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 18, 1841._--Madame de Lieven writes from Paris as\r\nfollows the day before yesterday: \"Madame de Nesselrode is full of the\r\ngreat men of France, and has certainly come to Paris chiefly to see\r\nthem. M. Eynard of Geneva has them on show; he invites Madame de\r\nNesselrode to dinner with each of them alternately. I do not think he\r\nhas missed one so far, except Garnier-Pagès.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen of England's speech is awaited here with some curiosity.\r\nPeople are wondering whether she will say anything suitable in view of\r\nthe situation here. There is no inclination in Paris to diverge from\r\nthe line of conduct that has been decided upon; an armed peace, quiet\r\nexpectation and isolation, threatening no one, neither disturbed nor\r\ndisturbing. Our neighbours, however, are anxious, and would like to\r\nsee this state of suspense at an end. Lord Palmerston's obstinacy\r\ndrives them to despair, for it is but too true that he is the real\r\ngovernor of Europe. Some means of forming a connection for France must\r\nsomehow be found, and an intermediary has not yet been discovered. It\r\nis certain that the Pasha's position will be made hereditary.\r\n\r\n\"France has made peace with Buenos Aires, and Rosas, the tyrant of\r\nthis republic, has been appointed ambassador here and will arrive in\r\nthe spring. England will arrange the difference between Spain and\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n\"Conversation is concerned with nothing but fortifications; it is not\r\nquite clear whether the Chamber is in favour of them. The King on the\r\none hand and M. Thiers on the other, are taking infinite trouble over\r\nthe question. The Ministry will support the proposals but will not\r\ndie of grief if they fail to pass.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Barante has been ordered to remain at St. Petersburg; some\r\ninclination to coquetry has been obvious in that quarter, but time\r\nalone will show whether any definite result will follow. M. de\r\nLamartine had an audience of the King which lasted two hours and a\r\nhalf and is said to have been much impressed. He talks a great deal\r\nabout it. The question of diplomatic changes will not arise until the\r\nmatter of the fortifications has been settled.\"\r\n\r\nI have the following news from Madame Mollien: \"There is every\r\nreadiness to support the law concerning the fortifications in the\r\nTuileries, but considerable reluctance in the Chamber. The château is\r\ngreatly obliged to M. Thiers for joining the general opinion in his\r\nreport; he is anxious to reassure the Chamber as to his position. It\r\nis said that he is greatly wearied by his partisans of the Left and\r\nhas had a lively scene with Odilon Barrot which reached the point of\r\ninsults and in which he termed the journalists of the party\r\n\"ruffians.\" The fact is that if this law does not pass, the thirty\r\nmillions already expended, the works that have been begun, the private\r\nproperty that has been bought up, destroyed and ruined and the\r\ndevastation of the Bois de Boulogne, would place him in a terrible\r\nposition; and so he is as gentle as a lamb and sends his wife to the\r\nTuileries. The Ministry would be content with what would cause him\r\nembarrassment; the château, on the other hand, is making common cause\r\nwith him; thus the position is very complex. The Duc d'Orléans is in a\r\nbad temper: the recall of Marshal Valée which was issued in the course\r\nof two hours without any previous notice to himself, has greatly\r\nwounded his feelings; he does not like the idea of the Marshal's\r\nreturn because he is one of his personal enemies and he fears for the\r\nsafety of Africa in the hands of Bugeaud. However, he is retiring\r\nsomewhat more into the background in adherence to the wishes of the\r\nKing, who is growing anxious about his successor, as Louis XIV. was\r\nabout the Grand Dauphin. All our princes live like the Infantas of\r\nSpain, in loneliness and obscurity. The Pavilion Marsan is nothing\r\nmore than a wearisome convent; on the ground floor there is very\r\nlittle vivacity and equally little on the first floor. The King\r\nretains his imperial confidence in his star. He thinks less of M.\r\nGuizot than he did some time ago, and does not so much dread a change\r\nof Ministry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 17, 1841._--The Duc de Noailles who came here\r\nyesterday, read this morning in the drawing-room half of the article\r\nwhich he has written upon Jansenism, which is to be inserted in the\r\nwork he is preparing upon Madame de Maintenon.[2] This part of the\r\nbook is written cleverly and clearly; at the same time I can criticise\r\nit for an excessive partiality to the Jansenists and a failure to\r\nobserve a proper moderation of tone.\r\n\r\n  [2] The publication which appeared in 1848 under the title _The\r\n  History of Madame de Maintenon and of the Principal Events of the\r\n  Reign of Louis XIV._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 1, 1841._--Yesterday I received this bulletin\r\nfrom M. de Salvandy: \"Our Ministry is the feeblest, the most\r\ndiminished and the most elusive that ever was seen. I do not know,\r\nMadame, whether I have told you what I have often told them, that\r\nthere is only one danger for them; not the danger of supporting views\r\nwhich might be defeated, but of having no opinion at all, or even\r\nworse, of having two opinions. They have run straight upon the rocks\r\nwith sublime carelessness, in consequence of Guizot's speeches and\r\nwith utter foolishness in consequence of Marshal Soult's speech, while\r\nthe general attitude and language drive them along most miserably. The\r\ntruth is that as a matter of principle they brought forward their\r\nproposed law concerning the fortifications in defiance of the\r\nMarshal's opinion and opposed their military expert because they\r\nthought that public opinion was on their side. Since that time the\r\nposition assumed by M. Thiers as a supporter of the bill has kept them\r\nawake and though they agreed with him in committee they were\r\nattempting to secure some means of checking him when he was with us in\r\nthe Chamber. Schneider's amendment has been proposed with their\r\nsupport in opposition to M. Thiers and in agreement with the Marshal\r\nagainst M. Guizot, with the support of another combination which is\r\nmore or less public property. Thus M. Guizot has suddenly revised his\r\nopinion and after asking us to pass the law in his great speech with a\r\nsignificant phrase, he went round to the members three days ago and\r\nsolemnly told us that he was opposed to it. The great success of M.\r\nDufaure has again produced a change in these views, as people fear\r\nthat the real strength of the opposition may lie in that quarter.\r\nYesterday evening Thiers demanded that they should explain themselves.\r\nThey asked for a night to think over the matter, but reflection will\r\ntell them nothing that can make such conduct worthy or politic. No\r\nquestion was ever so badly managed. They have succeeded in securing\r\nthe protectorate of M. Thiers, in exasperating him by their obvious\r\ntreachery and in separating MM. Passy and Dufaure, while also wounding\r\nthe feelings of the Conservative party, the majority of which is ready\r\nto reject the great bulwark of M. Thiers. In any case, they are\r\ndefeated, for they have conspired against all in turn. What will be\r\nthe result of all this? Great discredit and deep divisions, if nothing\r\nelse. I am going to the Chamber where I will try and write a\r\npostscript to describe the tone of the Cabinet and the vote of the\r\nAssembly, but I expect storms, and as I am acting as President in\r\nplace of M. Sauzet, I must keep my hand upon the bag of Aeolus.\r\n\r\n\"_Postscript from the Chamber._--The Marshal has made a speech of\r\ncoarse and obvious duplicity which is setting the Chamber on fire. I\r\nhave only time to send you my kind regards with this letter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 2, 1841._--Yesterday's letters say nothing; the\r\nnewspapers announce that Schneider's amendment has been rejected and\r\nthat the forts and the continuous circuit wall will probably be\r\nadopted, notwithstanding the most inconceivable speech from Marshal\r\nSoult which was counterbalanced by the really clever speech of M.\r\nGuizot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 4, 1841._--It was very cold yesterday but quite\r\nclear and I went for a walk with my son-in-law in the woods where\r\nthere is always shelter in spite of the absence of leaves. To-day it\r\nis snowing as if we were in Siberia. Last night the thermometer fell\r\nmore than ten degrees. Winter has indeed begun again.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers tell us that the fortifications have been voted; even\r\nthose who voted for them did not want them and it is difficult to know\r\nwho has been duped in the whole business. One of the jests current in\r\nParis is no longer to refer to Marshal Soult by his long-standing\r\ntitle of the Illustrious Sword, but to speak of him as the Illustrious\r\nScabbard. This is not bad and tickled my fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 5, 1841._--The following is the chief passage in\r\na letter from the Comtesse Mollien: \"So we are to have fortifications.\r\nIn this very complicated question every one has been taken in and it\r\nis difficult to see who has gained an advantage apart from M. Thiers,\r\nwhose delight, however, is largely qualified by the success of M.\r\nGuizot, for it is generally admitted that the Chamber of Deputies was\r\ncarried away by his last and most admirable speech. It now remains to\r\ndeal with the Chamber of Peers, which might show some obstinacy,\r\naccording to rumour. This Chamber is quite in favour of outer forts at\r\na greater or less distance in connection with one another, etc., but\r\nthere will be some trouble in passing the proposal for a continuous\r\ncircuit wall through that Chamber. You have doubtless seen from the\r\narticles in the _Journal des Débats_ that this newspaper supported the\r\nlaw. The truth is very different; the real supporter is Auguste de\r\nVeaux, the son of Bertin de Veaux, who alone supported this view with\r\nsuch warmth that he outraged the policy of the newspaper against his\r\nfather and uncle, who were no less warm supporters than himself of the\r\ncontrary opinion, but eventually yielded to his youth and to his\r\nposition as deputy. At the château there is general delight, but I\r\nthink that too little trouble is taken to conceal the fact that the\r\ncircuit wall is only the passport for the rest. M. Bertin de Veaux was\r\nsaying the day before yesterday that this circuit wall was the tomb of\r\nParisian civilisation until it became the tomb of the monarchy. It has\r\ncertainly already become the tomb of general conversation; people are\r\nwholly absorbed by it. Men and women, young and old, talk of nothing\r\nelse and it is most wearisome and ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"There has been a monster ball at the Tuileries. There will be no\r\nothers: no select ball, but one concert and nothing else; only on the\r\nMonday festival there will be a small masked ball confined to the\r\nfamily and the households; the young people alone will be masked and\r\nladies who are not dancing will wear white to distinguish them from\r\nthe rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 7, 1841._--The Chamber of Peers seems far from\r\nfavourably impressed by the proposal for fortifications and wishes to\r\noppose it. I doubt if it has the energy to do so. Mdlle. de Cossé is\r\nto marry the Duc de Rivière. She will be very rich and wishes to be a\r\nduchess; he has very little money. Old Madame de la Briche is quite in\r\nher dotage. This does not prevent her from following her social\r\ninclinations and saying and doing extraordinary things.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 9, 1841._--My son-in-law hears that the\r\ndisagreements about the fortifications and the manner in which the\r\nwhole business has been conducted is likely to place every one in a\r\nfalse position; the Council, the Chamber and every one are at cross\r\npurposes; the Chamber of Peers is excited and exasperated and wishes\r\nto propose an amendment, in which direction it is urged by Marshal\r\nSoult, Villemain and Teste, but is held in check by Guizot and\r\nDuchâtel.\r\n\r\nAmid all these disturbances the vote for the Secret Service Fund will\r\npass without difficulty. Then there is no other serious question\r\nduring this session and M. Thiers is said not to be in a position to\r\ngive battle on the latter point.\r\n\r\nThe situation in general, according to the statement of M. Guizot is\r\ngood, for the Left, he adds, is reduced to impotence for a long time.\r\nHe seems to be more and more pleased with the state of foreign policy,\r\nwith the advances which are made to us, and of which he boasts a great\r\ndeal. He goes so far as to say that the union with the four Powers has\r\nbeen broken, though this statement seems to me a trifle premature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 11, 1841._--I find the following in a letter\r\nfrom the Duc de Noailles: \"I have been studying the question of the\r\nfortifications, since this ridiculous law is thrust upon us. I cannot\r\nstomach it, and will not let it pass without raising my voice against\r\nit. The Duc d'Orléans shows great energy in the matter: he goes every\r\nday to the Chamber of Peers, even when we have nothing before us but\r\npetitions; he makes notes and observations with our grand referendary,\r\nM. Decazes, who hangs about the Chamber with a pocket-book, upon all\r\nthe peers who are for or against and adds up the votes beforehand.\r\nYesterday he sent some one during the session to M. de Vérac who\r\nrarely appears in the Chamber, to learn his opinion. He said that if\r\nthere was any want of water to make mortar for the buildings, he would\r\nrather give his blood than that they should be interrupted. He told M.\r\nde Mornay who spoke on the opposition side of the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nthat he had spoken as a marquis and not as a patriot. In short, he is\r\ncanvassing all the peers, sending them invitations, asking them to\r\ndinner and using every possible means. It is true that almost all the\r\nChamber will vote for the law, to such an extent have they been\r\ncrushed by the revolutions which have harrowed our country. As you are\r\ndeeply attached to the Duc d'Orléans, you will be sorry to hear of the\r\nunseemly and revolutionary remarks which this law has evoked from him\r\nand which are in circulation everywhere. M. Molé is working his\r\nhardest to oppose the proposal, but he will probably not be bold\r\nenough to speak against it openly; M. Pasquier is no less furious and\r\nwill probably be equally silent.\r\n\r\n\"We have had a charming evening's entertainment at the house of Madame\r\nRécamier,[3] on behalf of the sufferers from the conflagration at\r\nLyons. I was in charge of the arrangements and the platform at the\r\nback of the room was most suitable for the music and the recitals. The\r\nprofessional musicians performed admirably; the little Rachel came\r\nlate because the committee of the _Théâtre Français_ had forced her,\r\nwith their usual inconsiderateness, to play Mithridate the same day.\r\nShe arrived at eleven o'clock with a grace, an eagerness to help and a\r\nsimplicity which charmed every one. She gave the _Dream of Athalie_\r\nand the scene with Joas with excellent effect; it will be even better\r\non the stage, as stage effects are lost in a drawing-room. Her\r\nconversation and manner caused equal satisfaction. The result was\r\nexcellent--five thousand francs. Two hundred tickets were sent out at\r\ntwenty francs a ticket, but nearly every one paid forty, fifty or even\r\na hundred francs a ticket. It is a very pleasant way of collecting\r\nmoney. M. de Chateaubriand, who usually goes to bed at nine, stayed\r\nuntil midnight. M. de Lamartine was also there and two abbés to\r\nrepresent the convent; the Abbé Genoude and the Abbé Deguerry.\"\r\n\r\n  [3] Madame Récamier, at the outset of the Restoration and after\r\n  her husband's ruin, settled at the Abbaye au Bois. All the famous\r\n  men of the age struggled to secure admission to her salon, which\r\n  apart from politics was a sort of nineteenth-century Hotel de\r\n  Rambouillet, with Madame Récamier as Julie.\r\n\r\nThe Duc is devoting himself to art no less than to politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 12, 1841._--Several Legitimist newspapers have\r\npublished so-called letters written during the period of exile by King\r\nLouis-Philippe to the Marquis d'Entraigues, and a long letter written\r\nto the late M. de Talleyrand by the King, while M. de Talleyrand was\r\nambassador at London. The Cabinet considers that the newspapers should\r\nbe seized, the editors arrested and a charge of forgery brought\r\nagainst them before the courts. I sent for the newspaper containing\r\nthe letter which was supposed to have been written to M. de\r\nTalleyrand. I am convinced that it is an absolute forgery. M.\r\nDelessert, prefect of police, has asked my son, M. de Valençay, to\r\nwrite to me and inquire whether I knew if any papers had been stolen\r\nfrom M. de Talleyrand at London; whether it was possible for any one\r\nto have abstracted them at Paris during his illness and at the time of\r\nhis death; and finally, whether I knew a woman who was concerned in\r\nthe whole business[4] who says that she had lived at Valençay and even\r\nin the château; in short, he wishes to know my recollections and my\r\nopinion of the whole story. I talked over the matter with my\r\nson-in-law, and we concluded that we would be bound to reply. I\r\ntherefore gave M. de Valençay a reply, telling him to read my letter\r\nto M. Delessert but not to leave the letter in his hands. In it I said\r\nthat I had never known this woman or heard of her, which is exactly\r\ntrue; that all M. de Talleyrand's important papers had been deposited\r\nby him in foreign countries in sure hands and in places which would\r\nrender theft quite impossible, and that no papers could have been\r\nfound at his house in Paris, if any attempt had been made to abstract\r\nthem, of which I had no recollection; that, in short, all my\r\nrecollections and impressions contributed to convince me that the\r\nletter in question was a forgery. As a matter of fact, it is a very\r\nlong letter upon European affairs which was never written by the King;\r\nmoreover, neither the King nor Madame Adélaide in their letters to M.\r\nde Talleyrand ever expressed the thoughts, the opinions, or the\r\nprojects expounded in this letter. It appears that the Abbé Genoude\r\nand M. de la Rochejaquelein, in the course of a journey to England,\r\nbought the King's so-called letters from this woman and came to\r\npublish them in France under the deception of animosity and party\r\nspirit. However, the whole business is very unpleasant for the King\r\nand the trial very wearisome to follow; these men assert that they\r\nhave originals in the King's handwriting, which are no doubt\r\nforgeries, though proving them to be so is a hateful business.\r\n\r\n  [4] This woman, Eselina Vanayl de Yongh, under the name of Ida de\r\n  Saint-Elme, was a famous adventuress. The supposed letters of\r\n  Louis-Philippe had been entirely invented by her.\r\n\r\nThe Legitimist newspapers also publish some fragments of a diary, or\r\nrather some memoirs of Madame de Feuchères; the forgery here is\r\nobvious to myself, who am well aware of the relations which existed\r\nbetween her and the Royal Family, and are totally misrepresented by\r\nthese fragments. Her family and the executors of her will have\r\npublished an absolute denial of the existence of these supposed\r\nmemoirs. However, the Legitimist newspapers proceed as before to\r\npublish instalments of this absurdity, and there are idiots or\r\nill-disposed persons who still persist in believing them authentic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 15, 1841._--I have been asked a question about\r\nMadame de Salvandy, who corresponds with the Austrian Minister to the\r\nUnited States; her maiden name was Mlle. Ferey, and she was a niece of\r\nthe Oberkampf family; she is thus connected with the Jouy oilcloth.[5]\r\nShe is not a distinguished person, though not vulgar; she is not\r\npretty and not exactly ugly; she is not pleasant, but not badly\r\nbrought up; not clever, but no fool; and after this I think it must be\r\nadmitted that she is not a nonentity. I should add that she has been a\r\ngood daughter, a good wife and a good mother; that she bores her\r\nhusband and wearies her children by her continual efforts to be\r\ncorrect; and in conclusion that she is a thorough-going Protestant,\r\nalways scattering little French Bibles about without her husband's\r\nknowledge, who is a good Catholic.\r\n\r\n  [5] An allusion to the painted cloth manufacture founded in the\r\n  eighteenth century by Oberkampf at Jouy-en-Josas, in the\r\n  department of Seine-et-Oise, not far from Versailles.\r\n\r\nA summary of my correspondence is as follows. I found it here when I\r\nreturned from Tours, where I had gone for a few hours to be present at\r\na charity lottery.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes: \"Enthusiasm is rising once more at the\r\nTuileries on behalf of the fortifications at Paris, and is said to\r\nhave reached Dumouriez. The fortifications are desired and will be\r\nsecured, for it is thought that the Chamber of Peers will show a\r\nmajority in their favour, notwithstanding the Legitimist conspiracy of\r\nMolé and Pasquier. England will be obliged to make advances to France,\r\nas Parliament is urging it in that direction and society also.\r\nNotwithstanding the outward success of the English Cabinet, the\r\nMinistry is growing weak and it is even said that it will fall. Lord\r\nPalmerston alone retains full confidence in his fortune. The whole of\r\nEurope shows great confidence in M. Guizot, especially Prince\r\nMetternich, who asks of him only one thing--namely, that he will\r\ncontinue in office. I think he is as safe as any one can be in France.\r\nI think the proposal regarding Jerusalem will not pass unnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Montmorency writes: \"I told you a few days ago that\r\nMgr. Affre had forbidden the Chapter to meet, and that the Chapter had\r\nstrictly carried out his orders by offering him no New Year's\r\ncongratulations, as a meeting would have been necessary for that\r\npurpose. The result has caused a disturbance among the clergy which is\r\nnow at its height. Even at the Tuileries they are beginning to repent\r\nof the unfortunate choice that was made in M. Affre, as he had a\r\nviolent quarrel with M. Guillon, Bishop of Morocco, the Queen's first\r\nalmoner, and a great favourite at the château. M. Guillon, though he\r\nhad been entirely hostile to Mgr. de Quélen, went to the King to\r\ncomplain of Mgr. Affre. Unfortunately he cannot be removed. He has\r\nturned M. de Courtier, the very popular priest of the foreign\r\nmissions, out of his parish, and he has only his masses to live upon.\r\nThe canons of Notre Dame no longer say mass at the high altar, as to\r\ndo so would be a means of meeting, and similarly at matins and the\r\nother offices. Things are almost as if the cathedral was under an\r\ninterdict. Mgr. Affre is so hot-tempered that when his secretary, a\r\nyoung and innocent abbé to whom he had dictated some extraordinary\r\nletters, ventured to remark upon the fact, he was immediately\r\ndismissed without notice. How Christian, pastoral and evangelical such\r\nconduct is!\r\n\r\n\"M. Demidoff has sent back the secretary, the butler and the servants\r\nthat he had here; it is not yet known whether he has reached Russia,\r\nor whether the Emperor Nicholas will allow his wife to come with him;\r\nthe possibility is doubted.\r\n\r\n\"The affairs of the Duc Decazes are in fearful disorder and his\r\nservants are leaving him; he is also said to be very ill.\"\r\n\r\nM. Raullin writes: \"Yesterday at Notre Dame we had a sermon from the\r\nRev. Father Lacordaire, who wishes to restore or to establish in\r\nFrance the Order of Dominicans with their beautiful white cloaks. The\r\nwhole of Paris was there and the church was crowded. The sermon\r\nprovoked much criticism, both favourable and adverse. It was a\r\nharangue in the style of Peter the Hermit preaching the Crusade to the\r\npeople, except that in this case the Crusade was directed against no\r\none, but was to support Catholicism. It was Rome and France marching\r\ntogether since the time of Clovis to the conquest of true liberty and\r\nof civilisation. In all this there was a mixture of papacy and of\r\nnationalism, of spiritual monarchy and of universal liberty which was\r\nthundered forth in a style that might shake the pillars and the very\r\nfoundations of every Gallic church. I hope that similar attempts will\r\nnot often be made, but for once in a way such outbursts do no harm. I\r\nwas especially struck by the vast concourse of people and the close\r\nattention with which they followed all the words of this Dominican\r\nrevivalist. As to the result of his attempt, I am afraid that\r\nimagination and a sense of the picturesque are all that will be\r\nstimulated. I do not like attempts to start new movements by something\r\nextraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra writes: \"Madame de Rambuteau, in order to\r\navoid the terrible crowd which invades the rooms of the Hotel de\r\nVille, declared that she would only ask those of her new acquaintances\r\nwho were introduced to her on Tuesday mornings. Such was the reply\r\nthat she sent to a note from Madame d'Istrie, who asked permission to\r\nintroduce her sister, Madame de La Ferronnays. The idea of\r\nintroduction as an excuse from Madame de Rambuteau to Madame de La\r\nFerronnays has been considered ridiculous; it has become a jest and a\r\nbyword and many people in high society decline to visit the Hotel de\r\nVille.\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Flahaut is entirely absorbed in the task of attracting the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain to her house; the Duc d'Orléans is distinctly\r\nangry in consequence; but as princes no longer go to salons, Madame de\r\nFlahaut says that she will not continue to sacrifice her tastes to the\r\nwhims of the Duc d'Orléans. Emilie, her daughter, who keeps house for\r\nher, is influencing her in this direction. On Thursdays there is\r\ndancing at Madame de Flahaut's house: some one was saying before the\r\nMarquise de Caraman that these entertainments were balls for young\r\npeople, to which the marquise replied, 'And for young women too, for I\r\nhave been invited,' upon which remark it was remembered that her\r\nbaptismal certificate does not seem to agree with this claim.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, M. de Valençay writes that Madame de Sainte Elme, the author\r\nof the _Contemporary Memoirs_, is deeply implicated in the affair of\r\nthe pretended letters from the King. The prefect of police is still\r\nbusily occupied in the task of getting to the bottom of this intrigue.\r\n\r\nM. de Valençay went to hear Father Lacordaire and says that he looks\r\nlike a fine Spanish picture. His sermon was very republican and his\r\nmode of expression very different from that hitherto employed in the\r\npulpit, but he has much talent and vigour.\r\n\r\nHe adds that M. de Chateaubriand is reading his Memoirs at Madame\r\nRécamier's house; Madame Gay swoons with admiration and Madame de\r\nBoigne makes faces. These two tendencies were especially brought out\r\nby a very striking portrait of the Duc de Bordeaux. The Duchesse de\r\nGramont Guiche was present and was not remarkably pleased with the\r\npassage in which her name was mentioned, in which M. de Chateaubriand\r\nsaid: \"Madame de Guiche, who has been a great beauty.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing else in my letters which seems worth quotation, and\r\neven what I have extracted is chiefly trivial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 23, 1841._--Some time ago I was advised to read\r\na novel by M. Sainte-Beuve and not to be alarmed by the title of it,\r\nwhich was \"Pleasure.\" I read half of it yesterday; though it wanders\r\nfrom the point in a manner more metaphysical than religious, and\r\nthough the affectation and ruggedness of the style is obvious, I have\r\nbeen deeply touched by the book, which displays a profound knowledge\r\nof the human heart, a true sense of good and evil, and generally\r\nspeaking, a loftiness of thought which is unusual in modern authors.\r\n\r\nMy son-in-law hears from Paris that the Chamber of Deputies was much\r\ndisturbed by the report of M. Jouffroy concerning the secret service\r\nfunds. The Chamber seems to have been living in a profound calm which\r\nhas been disturbed by this report. It has revived all quarrels and\r\nseverely criticises all past Ministries, while it speaks of the policy\r\nof the present Cabinet in terms which are unacceptable to many of its\r\nsupporters. In short, it is an unfortunate incident, which is\r\nimportant in so far as it strengthens the arms of that important\r\nfraction of the Chamber known as the Dufaure-Passy party.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 24, 1841._--In the _Friend of Religion_, a\r\nlittle magazine which I take in to lend to my priest, I have found a\r\nlong extract from the famous sermon of M. Lacordaire, which recently\r\ncaused so much sensation at Paris, and which fortunately seems to have\r\nmet with strong disapproval. As a matter of fact what I read is quite\r\ninconceivable, though there are many passages full of vigour and\r\ntalent; but these are overwhelmed by strange assertions which reach\r\nthe point of the scandalous and the dangerous. As his subject he took\r\nthe duty of children to parents and from thence proceeded to an\r\nenthusiastic eulogy of the democracy: he said that Jesus Christ was\r\nabove all things a member of the middle classes, and that France is\r\nsupported by God because it breathes democracy. The late Mgr. de\r\nQuélen was quite right in his refusal to allow M. Lacordaire to preach\r\nunless he were himself present to keep an eye upon him. He mistrusted\r\nthese strange doctrines which had long before been derived from his\r\nconnection with M. de Lamennais, and though M. Lacordaire has remained\r\na Catholic, he is largely affected by this evil teaching, which he\r\nreceived in his youth.\r\n\r\nPrince Pierre d'Arenburg writes to say that on the day of the\r\ncollection at Notre Dame Mgr. Affre summoned the ladies who were\r\ncollecting to the sacristy, but he did not speak to them or give them\r\na word of thanks, which they expected, as they were always accustomed\r\nto it from Mgr. de Quélen, who invariably thanked them with perfect\r\ngrace; that Mgr. Affre then sent them into the church with a most\r\nabrupt \"Now then, start,\" which was received with murmurs on the part\r\nof the ladies, according to my letter.\r\n\r\nM. de Valençay writes to say that he has heard from a reliable source\r\nthat overtures from the English Cabinet are still awaited and that it\r\nis believed that they will be forthcoming. He had met Madame de Lieven\r\nwho had commissioned him to send me news of the fact and to add that\r\nM. Guizot is on the best of terms with the German courts. It appears\r\nthat this week will decide the fate of the English Cabinet, which will\r\nbe vigorously attacked.\r\n\r\nThe law upon the fortifications will not be put to the vote in the\r\nChamber of Peers for a fortnight. It will be fiercely attacked by M.\r\nMolé, by the Chancellor and by the Legitimists. The court is very\r\nangry with the two first named. What the fate of the law will be is\r\nabsolutely unknown as yet.\r\n\r\nMadame de Nesselrode has left Paris full of enthusiasm for Parisian\r\nlife, for Parisian things and people. I admit her goodness of heart\r\nand her generosity, but I think very little of her judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 26, 1841._--I hear from Paris that a very select\r\nball was given by Madame Le Hon and that she and Madame de Flahaut are\r\nnow trying to refine their salon and to attract the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain; that in this respect a kind of reaction is expected;\r\nthat every one is anxious to be counted a member of high society; that\r\nthose who were formerly sought are now disdained and those are\r\nflattered who were formerly rejected.\r\n\r\nI hear from Vienna that the daughter of the Prussian Minister Maltzan,\r\na pretty young girl of twenty-four, is to marry Lord Beauvale, the\r\nEnglish Ambassador; in age he could easily be her father; he has been\r\na great rake and is eaten up with gout. However, she has preferred him\r\nto several possibilities, because he is an English peer, ambassador\r\nand brother of the Prime Minister. She has decided to make a brilliant\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 27, 1841._--Yesterday my daughter had a long\r\nletter from young Lady Holland of whom she had seen a good deal at\r\nFlorence. This little lady is now at London. I have asked my\r\ndaughter's permission to select the interesting passages from this\r\nletter: \"I doubt if any one, whatever trouble he took, could discover\r\na more painful situation than ours, because I think that no one could\r\nfind such a woman as Lady Holland, my mother-in-law. She surpasses\r\neverything that could be imagined in the way of rapacity and\r\nselfishness, and in a novel her character would be thought exaggerated\r\nand impossible. As you know, she became possessor of everything from\r\nmy father-in-law, but that is not enough for her. She wishes to pull\r\ndown Holland House where she spent forty years of her life and to\r\nbuild and to sell; in fact, Heaven knows what she does not wish, for\r\nthe other day she was anxious to make an arrangement with her son\r\nwhich would deprive us of our small income which was arranged at our\r\nmarriage, so that if the Ministry were to change to-morrow it is quite\r\npossible we should be reduced to live upon the interest from my dowry.\r\nFortunately she cannot destroy Holland House without my husband's\r\nconsent and he says he would rather cut his hand off than consent to\r\nsacrifice the smallest part of it, even of the park. Similarly she\r\ncannot sell the other estate of Ampthill without his consent. He would\r\nwillingly give his consent to pay off the large mortgages with which\r\nshe has burdened the property, which was immense and free from debt at\r\nthe time of her marriage with Lord Holland, if she on her side would\r\ndo something. She has so much of which she can unfortunately dispose\r\nthat my husband has been advised to ask something in return for his\r\nconsent. He only asked her to leave the house as it was during his\r\nfather's lifetime, whom he worshipped, and whose memory is most dear\r\nto him. He told her that the library and papers which his father left\r\nbehind were a hundred times more precious to him than the real\r\nproperty and the silver of which she can dispose. Well, she declines\r\nto do anything. She has consulted all her friends, who have pointed\r\nout the truth and asked her to do the right thing. The result is\r\nscenes and quarrels, while we must look on at everything and not offer\r\na complaint. It is a difficult position and sometimes I feel my blood\r\nboil, but I restrain myself for my husband's sake and follow the\r\nexample of his sons and his daughter whose patience towards her is\r\nangelical and who show a delicacy, a tenderness and reserve which she\r\ncertainly does not deserve at times. In short, we must hope that a day\r\nwill come when we shall be able to live in peace and return to that\r\ndear house which we have not been permitted to approach since our\r\narrival. At present we must start as soon as we can and return to\r\nFlorence by way of Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Fanny Cowper is not to marry Charles Gore. She cannot yet decide what\r\nshe will do, and remains very pretty.[6] The chief beauty of the\r\nmoment is Lady Douro. The Duke of Wellington has recovered but commits\r\nsuch imprudent acts that it is impossible to rely upon him. Lord\r\nCardigan has been hissed in the theatre, which is very unpleasant for\r\nthose who go there. I went to his trial which interested me\r\ngreatly.[7] He is a handsome man, pale and interesting, and we\r\npeeresses were all so pleased that he was acquitted; but it was a\r\nsomewhat theatrical business and I am afraid that in these days of\r\nreform and discontent it may cause some outcry against the House of\r\nLords. My husband clearly pronounced the words 'Not guilty, upon my\r\nhonour,' but they were delivered best of all by my cousin, Lord Essex.\r\nTowards evening the robes of the peers, the red tapestry and the\r\npresence of the ladies made a striking effect. The ladies chiefly\r\nadmired were Lady Douro, Lady Seymour, Lady Mahon and my cousin,\r\nCaroline Essex.\r\n\r\n  [6] The daughter of Lady Palmerston by her first marriage and a\r\n  niece of Lord Melbourne. Lady Fanny was to marry Lord Jocelyn a\r\n  few months later.\r\n\r\n  [7] Young Colonel Cardigan had several quarrels with officers in\r\n  his regiment, and after a duel with Captain Harvey Tuckett, whom\r\n  he wounded, he was summoned before the House of Lords in its\r\n  judicial capacity in 1841; he was acquitted, and his trial was\r\n  merely a necessary concession to the law of the land against\r\n  duelling.\r\n\r\n\"Our dear aunt, Miss Fox, of whom we are very fond, since she has been\r\na real mother to my husband, has given us much anxiety. She has been\r\nvery ill, but I hope that she is out of danger; she regrets her\r\nbrother whom she loved for himself alone. There is no sense of vanity,\r\nno regret for loss of position, and no ambition in her grief, while\r\neverything that she has seen or heard since his death has shocked and\r\npained her. We have also been alarmed for my poor cousin, Lady\r\nMelbourne; an illness after a miscarriage was nearly the death of her,\r\nbut I now hope and trust that she is out of danger; these, however,\r\nare incidents which hurt and leave their marks. She thought she was\r\ndying and left all that she loved with calmness, submission and\r\ntenderness, forgetting nothing that could conduce to the happiness of\r\nher husband whom she was leaving.\r\n\r\n\"We spent a week at the beginning of the year at Windsor; it was a\r\npicture of perfect happiness; our dear little Queen, handsome Prince\r\nAlbert and the little Princess, a pretty and good-tempered child,\r\nready to do anything with a smile, a certain sign of good health. The\r\nQueen is said to be with child again. We were dining there four or\r\nfive days ago and the Queen seemed to me to be not quite well, though\r\nshe danced a good deal two evenings later, but in any case she is so\r\nstrong that one cannot judge by appearances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 1, 1841._--My last month of Rochecotte is now\r\nbeginning, much to my regret. I have been as well here as I can be at\r\npresent. I live free from fatigue, agitation, trouble and constraint;\r\nall these I shall find at Paris, but there would be a certain\r\naffectation if I stayed away altogether; and before starting for\r\nGermany I have a number of little things to do and some preparations\r\nto make which can only be done at Paris, so I have resolved, though\r\nwith much reluctance, to start in April.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from Madame Mollien, which seems to me\r\namusing from beginning to end: \"I must say a word to you of this fancy\r\ndress ball, a carnival ball which will form an epoch in the annals of\r\nthe Tuileries, because for some hours it has brought back to its\r\nwalls, which are usually so sad, the frank, simple and unrestrained\r\ncheerfulness which can only be seen in the simplest salons. The\r\nsuccess of the entertainment was due to the Prince de Joinville; no\r\none could withstand his impetuosity. The costumes were varied,\r\ngenerally rich and tasteful with a few exceptions; there are\r\nexceptions everywhere. The Queen, the old Princesses and the old\r\nladies who were not wearing costumes went in succession to the gallery\r\nof Louis-Philippe. All in costume, ladies and gentlemen, met in\r\nanother part of the château and made a solemn entry about half-past\r\neight to the sound of an appalling band, composed of all kinds of\r\nmore or less barbarous instruments which the Prince de Joinville has\r\ncollected in his travels. He himself, in true Turkish costume, carried\r\nan enormous drum of a most oriental kind, on which he made a\r\ntremendous noise. A magician preceded the procession as a herald, and\r\nthe company was conducted by the Duchesse d'Orléans. She was splendid\r\nwith a dignified air: her costume was that of Marie of Burgundy, black\r\nvelvet richly embroidered with gold and trimmed with ermine; the tall\r\npointed cap which forms part of this costume was ornamented at the\r\nfront with a velvet bow embroidered with enormous stones; the cap\r\nitself was of cloth of gold surmounted by a veil of tulle embroidered\r\nwith gold. Two ladies and two gentlemen, alike in costumes of the age\r\nof Louis IX., escorted the Princess. The two ladies, whose costumes\r\nwere like hers though not so rich, were Mdmes. de Chanaleilles and\r\nOlivia de Chabot; the men were M. Asseline, her Secretary of private\r\ncommands, and M. de Praslin, who looked very well in a long cloak of\r\nbrown velvet and marten fur, and called himself Philippe de Commines.\r\nPoor Princess Clémentine was not a success: she wore a Turkish costume\r\nwhich the Prince de Joinville had brought back from Syria; it was\r\nhandsome but heavy and ungraceful, and her supple and charming figure\r\nwas not shown off until after supper when she took off the enormous\r\nheaddress which was crushing her, to be able to dance more at her\r\nease. The Duchesse de Nemours, on the other hand, was charming: she\r\nhad copied a portrait of the wife of the Regent, whom she is supposed\r\nto resemble. The outer dress was of red velvet, very short, with a\r\nskirt standing out and trimmed with rubies and diamonds all round,\r\nupon a skirt of white satin trimmed with two rows of broad green\r\nfringe and garlands of pearls; a small velvet cap with one little\r\nfeather standing upright was put on the side of her head and touched\r\nher forehead, leaving her head almost bare upon one side. Her very\r\nfair hair slightly powdered, curled, fluffy, turned up on one side and\r\nfalling down on the other, gave her a coquettish appearance and an\r\napparent want of care which was charming. I have never seen her so\r\npretty, and so every one said. The others are not worth mentioning. At\r\nthe same time there were some pretty dresses, including ladies of the\r\ntime of the Ligue, of the Fronde, of Louis XIII., of Louis XIV., some\r\nSpanish costumes, and also a vivandière of the time of Louis XV.,\r\nwhich caused quite a sensation. Madame de Montalivet and Madame de\r\nPraslin each appeared as Mlle. de Hautfort, in rivalry. Many of the\r\nladies were powdered. The Duc d'Orléans did not return from Saint Omer\r\nas he had said he might do, to the great vexation of the Princesse; I\r\nthink his absence rather spoilt her evening. The Prince de Joinville\r\nspeedily rid himself of his Turkish costume; his two young brothers\r\nfirst appeared in military costumes of the last century. After the\r\nfirst dance they all three went away and soon came back again; the\r\nPrince de Joinville and the Duc d'Aumale as _débardeurs_ and the Duc\r\nde Montpensier as a _fifi_ of the time of the Regency. If you happen\r\nto have a neighbour who is accustomed to go to fancy dress balls (I do\r\nnot think M. de Castellane is), you can ask him for explanations of\r\nthese costumes. Their chief merit and probably the reason for their\r\nchoice, is that they are an excellent support in themselves to\r\nrevelry, as they authorise and even require a cheerful manner. The\r\nquadrilles were formed only in two rows; as there was plenty of room\r\nthey were able to stand without crowding. As the couples at each end\r\nwould have had too much space to traverse, each figure was repeated\r\nonly twice instead of four times, and thus without rest or relaxation,\r\never in movement, each dance finished by a general galop to music\r\nplayed in much quicker time for that purpose. This went on till\r\nhalf-past three in the morning with a vivacity which I could hardly\r\nbelieve possible. The Queen was greatly amused, and the King himself\r\nseemed to find some pleasure in all this gaiety. He stayed till\r\nsupper, which was served in the Galerie de Diane at little round\r\ntables, as at small balls. The Infants and Infantas of Spain were all\r\nin costume, excepting their father and their mother. She only danced\r\nthe English dance, which concluded the ball. Her partner was an\r\n_Incroyable_ of the Revolution, and they looked sufficiently\r\nincredible. However, she excused herself from the last galop which\r\nended this dance and was more uproarious than all the rest. The Prince\r\nde Joinville had the Duc de Nemours as his page, and he took a very\r\ncheerful part in all these gaieties throughout the evening. He made\r\nsome attempt to imitate his brother, but the Prince de Joinville with\r\nhis wild spirits coupled with his grave and handsome face, his\r\nalertness and originality, was in every respect inimitable. I have\r\nforgotten to mention M. and Madame de Chabannes: she appeared as a\r\nlady from the Court of Charles IX.; her costume, which was said to be\r\ndesigned by Paul Delaroche, was exactly correct, and made her\r\nabsolutely hideous. He was wrapped from head to foot in those waves of\r\nwhite muslin in which the Arabs are dressed; this was not an\r\nimitation, for the whole thing came from Algiers--the costume, the\r\ndagger, the pistol, and also an enormous gun which he had captured at\r\nBlidah or at Milianah. He was on duty, and in this costume he preceded\r\nthe King and Queen when they came from their apartments to the\r\nballroom. In my opinion he showed not the least proof of courage in\r\nthis campaign.\r\n\r\n\"There was a continuation of these festivities the next day. All those\r\nin costume who cared to do so met at the house of M. de Lasalle, the\r\nKing's ordnance officer, and the _Incroyable_ of the Infanta. His wife\r\nhad a splendid costume, said to represent Mlle. de Montpensier. The\r\nDuc de Nemours, the Prince de Joinville and the Duc d'Aumale appeared\r\nat this improvised meeting, which went on until five o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and is said to have been extremely gay. It was Shrove\r\nTuesday, when everything is permitted. There was also some amusement\r\nin the morning: Madame Adélaïde gave her children's breakfast as\r\nusual; the King and Queen always attend it as well as the Princesses;\r\nit is held in the Palais Royal in Madame's own rooms. Several tables\r\nare placed in three rooms, at one of which the Royal Family sits and\r\nis served with all kinds of dainties. This table is the most amusing\r\npoint. This year Madame had added a little performance to amuse the\r\nKing; a piece from the theatre of varieties was played, the\r\n_Chevalier du Guet_, which may perhaps have amused the King but\r\ncertainly not the children; of that I am certain. My two nephews were\r\nwith me, for Madame had invited them with a kindness which would not\r\nallow me to refuse. I stayed there from three o'clock till seven and\r\nthen went back to spend the evening at the Tuileries, as I was on\r\nduty, so that by Ash Wednesday I was nearly dead with weariness.\r\n\r\n\"There has been not a word spoken to-day about the fortifications, or\r\nof the secret service fund, though to tell the truth certain statesmen\r\nwould not be entirely out of place amid these Carnival disguises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 2, 1841._--M. de Valençay writes to say that he\r\ndined yesterday, which was Thursday, with Marshal Soult, a large\r\ndinner-party to forty guests. The Aylesburys, the Seafords, Lady\r\nAldborough, the Brignole and Durazzo parties, and the Francis Barings\r\nwere there. My son sat near Francis Baring, a clever and agreeable\r\nman, of whom he had seen a great deal at M. de Talleyrand's house,\r\nespecially in England, and who seems to retain a warm regard for his\r\nmemory. They had much talk. Sir Francis told him that a large number\r\nof M. de Talleyrand's letters had recently passed through his hands,\r\nas he had been going over and arranging all the correspondence of his\r\nfather-in-law, the Duke of Bassano. He added that after reading these\r\nletters his impression was that my uncle had right upon his side in\r\nhis differences with the Duke of Bassano concerning the policy of the\r\nEmperor Napoleon. In the course of this conversation Francis Baring\r\ngave him a piece of information which might be useful to us, telling\r\nhim that one of his friends came to him a short time ago and said,\r\n\"You are not aware that Thiers professes to have found, while turning\r\nover certain papers, some documents which compromise M. de Talleyrand\r\nin the affair of the Duc d'Enghien.\" My son then went into certain\r\ndetails to show Baring that the information which M. Thiers professes\r\nto have acquired could only be erroneous, that my uncle had never\r\nknown anything of the Emperor's projects or his secret opinion\r\nregarding the Duc d'Enghien, and every one who knew Napoleon was not\r\nastonished at the fact.\r\n\r\nI am glad to know what M. Thiers professes to disseminate as\r\ninformation, with the object of giving an appearance of authenticity\r\nto the _History of the Consulate and the Empire_, which he is now\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nWhen you have returned from your exile,[8] I shall ask you to request\r\nFrancis Baring to lend you the letters of which he has spoken to my\r\nson. These letters might very well form a part of our great work, in\r\nmy opinion.[9]\r\n\r\n  [8] M. de Bacourt, to whom this letter was addressed, was still\r\n  acting as French Minister at Washington. This incident explains\r\n  the coolness which arose between the Duchesse de Talleyrand and\r\n  M. Thiers.\r\n\r\n  [9] This great work consisted in copying and classifying papers\r\n  which were collected under the title, _Memoirs of the Prince de\r\n  Talleyrand_.\r\n\r\nThe discussion upon the secret service funds has been much more\r\nprolonged than was expected. In any case the vote is a matter of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nYesterday's news was the scanty majority by which the English Ministry\r\ncarried Lord Morpeth's bill--five is indeed a small number; possibly\r\nit indicates the approaching fall of the Cabinet.[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] The Irish Registration Bill had been proposed by Lord\r\n  Morpeth in the House of Commons, where it met with considerable\r\n  opposition.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible as yet to say what the fate of the bill concerning\r\nthe fortifications of Paris will be in the Chamber of Peers. The Duc\r\nde Broglie is one of the most vigorous supporters of this law.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers announce the marriage of the old King of the Low\r\nCountries with the Comtesse d'Oultremont.[11] The aunt of the King of\r\nPrussia, the old Electress of Hesse has just died. The poor woman had\r\nled a sad life with many trials and reverses; her wretched husband is\r\nmarrying the lady with whom I have so often seen him at Baden.\r\n\r\n  [11] On February 16, 1841, King William I. of the Low Countries\r\n  contracted a morganatic marriage with the Comtesse d'\r\n  Oultremont-Vegimont, after abdicating in 1840, in favour of his\r\n  son, King William II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 3, 1841._--The Duc de Noailles writes telling me\r\nthat M. de Flahaut is assiduously paying court to M. Guizot on every\r\npossible occasion and in particular every evening at Madame de\r\nLieven's house, where his attentions begin as soon as he has passed\r\nthe door. In short, he seems as devoted to him as he was to M. Thiers;\r\nhowever, he will not secure the Vienna post unless Sainte-Aulaire goes\r\nto London, which he will only do if M. de Broglie who is urged to\r\naccept London, should continue to refuse it.\r\n\r\nThe Duc also says that the King regards the question of the\r\nfortifications as a peace problem, and declares that war need only be\r\nmade more difficult to become more unusual; that Germany is quite\r\nright to fortify herself; and that we should fortify ourselves,\r\nbecause in this way we shall check our impetuosity and each raise\r\nobstacles which will prevent mutual attacks. The Duc d'Orléans, on the\r\nother hand, regards the question from a revolutionary point of view;\r\nhe says that Europe will never permit his dynasty to continue or\r\nrecognise the principle of the Government which triumphed in 1830.\r\nSome day or other Europe will attack him, and he should prepare for\r\ndefence even to-day. The Duc de Noailles himself seems to be preparing\r\na speech, for which he claims a great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 5, 1841._--The following is a passage from a letter\r\nwhich I received yesterday from M. Molé: \"The coalition has prevented\r\nthe powers of good from triumphing henceforward; power can only be\r\nexerted now at the price of concessions, which I will never make, so I\r\nconsider my political or rather my ministerial career as terminated.\r\nWhen any question seems to be worth the effort, I shall do my duty to\r\nthe Chamber of Peers, but neither more nor less than that. On that\r\npoint I am irrevocably decided. Blindness is everywhere paramount, and\r\nin particular where clear-sightedness should reign. This reason makes\r\nme doubt the future, which I regard in the darkest colours and with\r\nmany apprehensions of approaching disaster.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Salvandy writes saying that he has to go to Toulouse this month\r\non family business and will ask me to put him up on his way. He adds,\r\n\"The campaign upon the question of the secret service funds has been\r\nwaged as mercilessly as that upon the fortifications question. M.\r\nThiers emerges defeated and without prospects; M. Guizot triumphant\r\nin word but weakened in reality, for the majority are disturbed by the\r\nobservations of M. Dufaure. The session seems to be concluded, but the\r\nvote of credit will arouse it to fresh life at the expense of M.\r\nThiers, and the discussion upon the law of the fortifications, if it\r\nshould end in the Chamber of Peers according to the wishes of M. Molé,\r\nwhich seems unlikely, would complicate the situation more than ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe newspapers announce the death of M. de Bellune, who received the\r\nsacraments from the hands of my cousin, the Abbé of Brézé, in the\r\npresence of M. de Chateaubriand, the Marquis de Brézé and M. Hyde de\r\nNeuville. No one could come to an end as a more thorough-going Carlist\r\nthan he. M. Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld has also died, but not in so\r\nLegitimist a fashion.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard is sad, depressed and ill, and is angry that M.\r\nAncelot should have been elected to M. de Bonald's seat in the Academy\r\ninstead of M. de Tocqueville.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 7, 1841._--I am delighted to hear that you like the\r\nletters of Madame de Maintenon,[12] and am deeply flattered by the\r\nlikeness that you find between the nature of her intellect and of\r\nmine. However, the Duc de Noailles has several times made the same\r\nobservation to me. I wish I were more capable of living up to the\r\nresemblance. Apart from her mental qualities and a certain weakness\r\ndue to her position and to the time in which she lived, she had a\r\nloftiness of soul, a firmness of character and a purity of principle\r\nand of life which raised her very high in my esteem and provided a\r\nbetter explanation of the astonishing fortunes which followed her,\r\nthan her beauty, her grace and her lofty thoughts can do.\r\n\r\n  [12] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 8, 1841._--Yesterday evening my son-in-law read us\r\na delightful article upon Mlle. de Lespinasse in the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_ of March 1. The article is well written and reminds me of\r\nseveral incidents which M. de Talleyrand told me of this personage,\r\nwho was no favourite of his. He thought that she was wanting in\r\nsimplicity, for one of the best features of M. de Talleyrand's taste\r\nwas his respect and liking for simplicity. He admired it in every\r\ncase, in mind, manner, language and feeling, and only a strange\r\nconjuncture of circumstances or a very strained position could ever\r\nprevent this noble instinct of simplicity from influencing his own\r\ncharacter and actions. Exaggeration and affectation he always hated.\r\nMy own failings in this respect were corrected in a remarkable degree\r\nby my intercourse with him. At the time of my marriage I was somewhat\r\nto blame in those directions, though I hope that is not the case now.\r\nThe improvement is due to him, as are many other things, for which I\r\ncannot sufficiently thank his memory. To return to Mlle. de\r\nLespinasse, I well remember reading her _Letters_ which appeared\r\nshortly after those of Madame du Deffant. I was not greatly attracted\r\nby them; affected enthusiasm is by no means the same as real feeling,\r\nand passion is not tenderness. In view of the want of principle that\r\ncharacterised the eighteenth century, the one safeguard for the\r\nindividual was the yoke imposed by society with its customs and\r\ndemands. If one were ever so little outside that circle, there was no\r\ncheck, and imagination carried people very far and very low. Mlle. de\r\nLespinasse, having neither family nor fortune, was not obliged to\r\nconsider a society to which she only half belonged, and led the life\r\nof a clever man who is also a lady-killer. But now I seem to be\r\nwriting an article on the subject myself and what we read yesterday is\r\nmuch better than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 9, 1841._--The following is an extract from a\r\nletter which I have from the Duchesse de Montmorency: \"People here\r\nthink only of fortifications: those who usually trouble but little\r\nabout politics are full of them and society looks very askance upon\r\nthose who are supposed likely to vote in support of the law. My\r\nhusband says that he has not yet been _enlightened_; our family\r\ninterprets this to mean that the King has won him over. The fact is\r\nthat he is influenced by my son who has been commissioned by the\r\nChâteau for this purpose, all of which vexes me exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\"M. Gobert, treasurer of the fund for the orphans of those who died\r\nof cholera, was very devoted to the memory of the late Mgr. de Quélen,\r\nand had a terrible scene with Mgr. Affre at a meeting of the\r\ncommittee, when the Archbishop wished to dismiss him. M. Gobert\r\nreplied that he would not stir; in short, the whole business was very\r\nscandalous and it is impossible to understand how these scenes of fury\r\nand abuse of authority will end.\r\n\r\n\"The Duc de Rohan is marrying his daughter to the Marquis de Béthisy,\r\na very suitable match.\r\n\r\n\"In the newspapers you will see the filial comedy that has been played\r\nby the Prince de la Moskowa. M. Pasquier is praised for not having\r\nallowed him to speak. I am told that the Duc d'Orléans induced the\r\nPrince de la Moskowa to enter the House of Peers in order that he\r\nmight vote for these stupid fortifications. It is also the Duc\r\nd'Orléans who influences the _Journal des Débats_. Old Bertin and the\r\nchief editors are strongly opposed to the fortifications, but young\r\nBertin, orderly officer to the Duc d'Orléans and M. Cuvillier Fleury,\r\nprivate secretary to the Duc d'Aumale, insert what they please in the\r\nnewspaper, or rather what the Château pleases. I know that Bertin de\r\nVeaux said the other day to one of my friends, 'Pray do not think that\r\nI am inclined to support so fatal a measure.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 14, 1841._--It was so fine yesterday and I had owed\r\na call so long to the wife of my sub-prefect,[13] that I resolved to\r\ngo to Chinon with my son-in-law between lunch and dinner. The road\r\nfrom this house to Chinon is pretty and easy. At Chinon itself I\r\nvisited the great and noble ruins of the castle which overlook the\r\nrich and smiling valley of the Vienne: the room where Joan of Arc\r\noffered her holy sword to Charles VII.; the tower where Jacques Molay,\r\nthe grand master of the Templars was long confined; and the\r\nsubterranean passage leading to the house of Agnes Sorel; all these\r\nthings can still be seen and one regards them with the eye of faith,\r\nwhich is the most important element in archæology. If this ruin were\r\nrestored as that of Heidelberg has been, the result would be most\r\npicturesque. I stayed for a quarter of an hour at the office of the\r\ncharity organisation where the Sister Superior now is who spent\r\nfourteen years in the household of Valençay and who had several times\r\nexpressed a desire to meet me. She is a thoroughly good person and\r\nliked everywhere, and her departure was much regretted at Valençay.\r\nWhen I rang the bell a sister came to tell me that the Mother Superior\r\nwas at the point of death and had received the last sacraments a few\r\nhours before. However, I asked her to tell the invalid that I was\r\nthere and she insisted upon seeing me. I was much saddened by the\r\ninterview which cheered the failing life of this excellent person. She\r\ntold me, as the late Mgr. de Quélen once told me, that from the first\r\nday when she had seen me to the day of her death which was now at hand\r\nshe had never passed a day without praying for me. It is good to be\r\nloved by Christian souls and their loyalty is to be found nowhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n  [13] The Sub-Prefect of Chinon at that time was M. Viel.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned from Chinon I found two letters which will influence\r\nmy movements during the summer; one was from the King of Prussia who\r\nhad heard of my travelling proposals and asks me to go and see him at\r\nSans Souci. This induces me to go to Berlin about May 12 and so one\r\npoint is settled. The other letter is from my sisters who tell me that\r\nthey will remain at Vienna until July 1, and that I ought to carry out\r\nthe proposal I had formed to go and see Madame de Sagan there if she\r\nhad lived. I am anxious that the tie between my sisters and myself\r\nshould be maintained. This is only as it should be and it is also a\r\ncomfort; we are now reduced to a very small group and the tie of blood\r\nhas a strength which one is surprised to find persisting in spite of\r\nall that should naturally destroy it or at any rate weaken it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 16, 1841._--Yesterday I had a letter from Madame de\r\nLieven who says: \"The Firman conferring heredity seems sheer humbug;\r\nsuch was the opinion of the Pasha and even more so the opinion of\r\nNapier, the English admiral. He has advised the Pasha to refuse it,\r\nwhich he has done very politely. While these events were in progress\r\nin the East, we here received a very polite invitation from London to\r\nrejoin the concert of Europe in order to settle the Eastern Question\r\nin general, and this invitation was preceded by a protocol announcing\r\nthat the Egyptian question was entirely settled. As the terms of\r\ninvitation seemed to be suitable, there was a disposition here to open\r\nnegotiations. Your Government has proposed some verbal changes which\r\nwere immediately accepted, and the matter was almost concluded when\r\nthe news that I have just told you arrived. M. Guizot immediately\r\nbrought the matter to a standstill, for the Egyptian affair, instead\r\nof being terminated, is beginning again, and the Sultan and the Pasha\r\nare as far from an understanding as ever. The Firman was dictated by\r\nLord Ponsonby and the other three representatives opposed it. The\r\nEnglish at Paris are ashamed of this despicable trick; every one\r\nregards it as an act of bad faith, and there is some small amusement\r\nat the embarrassment which will be caused to the northern Powers, as\r\nthe document will have to be drawn up again unless the whole quarrel\r\nis to be reopened as if no Treaty of July 15 had ever been made.\r\nMeanwhile the Germans are yearning to see the isolation of France come\r\nto an end, as this position forces them to undertake great expense in\r\nthe way of armaments, while France will not hear of any understanding\r\nas long as the difference with Egypt persists.\r\n\r\n\"And what of America? Lady Palmerston writes to me every week and says\r\nin her last letter, 'We are very pleased with the news from America,\r\nand everything will be settled.' This means that poor MacLeod will be\r\nhung and the English territory will be seized. If this will satisfy\r\nthem, all well and good.[14] In China, English affairs are also going\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n  [14] During the Canadian rebellion in 1837 and 1838, the\r\n  steamship _Caroline_ had been burnt on the Niagara River, and an\r\n  Englishman, Mr. Amos Durfee, was killed. Mr. Alexander MacLeod, a\r\n  United States citizen, was accused as his murderer, but Mr.\r\n  Gridley, judge at Utica succeeded in proving his innocence.\r\n\r\n\"Bresson will certainly return to Berlin. M. de Sainte-Aulaire has\r\nrecently arrived. He will go to London, when, I cannot say, probably\r\nwhen you send an ambassador there. I do not know who will go to\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Beauvale had an attack of gout during the celebration of his\r\nmarriage;[15] he told the priest to hurry up, and was taken home very\r\nill. The next day he was in bed and his wife had dinner at a small\r\ntable at his bedside. They will come to Paris on their way to England.\r\n\r\n  [15] _See_ p. 22 for the announcement of the marriage of Lord\r\n  Beauvale with Mlle. Maltzan.\r\n\r\n\"Adèle de Flahaut is dying; her father is behaving like a madman, but\r\nher mother shows a man's courage.\r\n\r\n\"I have decided to send you Lady Palmerston's letter so that Pauline\r\nmay read the details that interest her.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is Lady Palmerston's letter to the Princess: \"I must\r\ntell you that my daughter Fanny is engaged to Lord Jocelyn. He is a\r\ncharming young man of twenty-eight, handsome, cheerful, loyal, clever\r\nand pleasant, and he has travelled in every part of the world. He has\r\njust come back from China, of which he gives very interesting\r\naccounts. We are all very pleased with the marriage, which is quite\r\nromantic. He sent his proposal in writing from Calcutta a year and a\r\nhalf ago but could not wait for an answer as he was obliged to start\r\nfor Chusan; so he has been nearly two years wavering between hope and\r\nfear and reached Liverpool without knowing whether he would not find\r\nher married to some one else, for in the English papers which he\r\nsometimes saw he occasionally found announcements of Fanny's marriage\r\nwith some other person. Lord Jocelyn's father is Lord Roden, a great\r\nTory, but that, you know, is a trifle which does not disturb us, as\r\nFanny's happiness is our first object, and love and politics do not go\r\ntogether. Moreover, he is not a fanatic like his father, but very\r\nreasonable and steady in his ideas.\r\n\r\n\"The news from America is pretty good upon the whole: it is all a\r\nmatter of talk and party spirit; the out-goers wish to make the\r\nposition difficult for the in-comers, almost in European style.\"\r\n\r\nI now propose to copy a little romance which was composed by Henry IV.\r\nand which I have found in the _Memoirs of Sully_. It seems to me full\r\nof elegance and charm, and to be even more graceful than _Charmante\r\nGabrielle_:\r\n\r\n        Dawn of day\r\n        Come, I pray,\r\n    Gladden thou mine eyes;\r\n        My shepherdess\r\n        My heart's distress\r\n    Is redder than thy skies.\r\n        She is fair\r\n        Past compare;\r\n    See her slender form,\r\n        Eyes that are\r\n        Brighter far\r\n    Than the star of morn.\r\n        Though with dew\r\n        Touched anew,\r\n    Roses are less bright,\r\n        No ermine\r\n        So soft is seen\r\n    Nor lily half so white.\r\n\r\nHow pretty it is! Henry IV.'s letters are also charming; in fact his\r\nfigure alone lends interest to this extraordinary work which is as\r\nheavy and diffuse as possible, though interesting to any one who has\r\nthe patience to delve in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 27, 1841._--My son-in-law hears that the speech of\r\nM. Molé against the proposed fortifications has not answered the\r\ngeneral expectation; that the speech of M. d'Alton Shée, which was\r\nsaid to have been written by M. Berryer, sparkled with wit and clever\r\nmockery and delighted the Chamber of Peers, which is really as much\r\nopposed to the law as the Chamber of Deputies was, though it will\r\nprobably vote as the other Chamber has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 29, 1841._--I have now reached my last week of\r\ncountry life which will be filled with a thousand details,\r\narrangements, accounts, and orders to be given. I shall greatly miss\r\nmy solitude, my peace, the regularity of my daily life, the simplicity\r\nof my habits, the health-giving work without fatigue or agitation,\r\nwhich profits others and therefore myself. I cannot help feeling some\r\nanxiety at leaving the protecting haven where I have been taking\r\nshelter to set sail again. Society is a troublesome and stormy sea to\r\nsail, for which I do not feel in the least fitted. I have no pilot and\r\ncannot steer my ship alone, and am always afraid of running upon some\r\nreef. My wide experience has not given me cleverness, but has merely\r\nmade me distrustful of myself, which does not conduce to the\r\npossibility of a good passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 2, 1841._--I see a notice in the newspapers of the\r\ndeath of the Vicomtesse d'Agoult, mistress of the robes to the\r\nDauphine. The loss of so old and devoted a friend must be a severe\r\nblow to the Princess, especially during her exile. There are few\r\ngriefs and trials through which she has not passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 3, 1841._--The newspapers announce that the\r\namendment which would have sent back the law upon the fortifications\r\nto the Chamber of Deputies, has been rejected by the House of Peers by\r\na considerable majority. This means that the law will pass in its\r\noriginal form. The Château will be delighted.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Montmorency tells me that I shall find hypnotism again\r\nthe rage in Paris: every one has his own medium, and little morning\r\nand evening parties are given at which experiments are performed. This\r\nfashion was introduced by Madame Jules de Contades, the sister of my\r\nneighbour, M. du Ponceau. Her brother, who has been three months in\r\nParis, has obtained a woman of Anjou who is very susceptible to\r\nhypnotism. She was with him at Benais[16] last autumn, and Dr. Orye\r\ntells me wonderful things about her. He was formerly very incredulous,\r\nbut what he has seen of this woman has shaken his unbelief.\r\n\r\n  [16] Benais, the country residence near Rochecotte, then belonged\r\n  to M. and Madame de Messine, the parents of Madame du Ponceau.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 4, 1841._--Certainly Paris is now to have its\r\nfortifications. The Duc de Noailles writes me a letter upon the\r\nsubject which is very politic and probably very judicious, but which I\r\nfound very wearisome. He adds, \"I may tell you as a piece of news\r\nthat the Princesse de Lieven is giving dinners; she has very fine\r\nsilver and china, and invited me last Monday with M. Guizot, Montrond,\r\nM. and Madame de la Redorte, Mr. Peel (brother of Sir Robert Peel) and\r\nMrs. Peel. This was the second dinner she has given. The first was to\r\nher Ambassador and his niece Apponyi. She also gave an evening\r\nreception for the Duchess of Nassau, the widow and the daughter of\r\nPrince Paul of Würtemberg, who came to spend a fortnight in Paris to\r\nsee her father who has been at death's door and is still very ill. The\r\nDuchess of Nassau is deaf but she is very pleasant and agreeable. She\r\ndid not wish to call at the Tuileries but her father insisted. The\r\nwhole of the Royal Family, except the King, called upon her the next\r\nday. Three days later she was invited to dinner and refused, saying\r\nthat she was obliged to go to Versailles on that day. She refused\r\nbefore mentioning the subject to her father, who is certainly not a\r\nsupporter of the Philippe party, but felt the unpleasantness of the\r\nrefusal. He has insisted that she should make an appointment with the\r\nQueen for her farewell call: the Queen replied that she was very\r\nsorry, but that the engagements of Holy Week would not allow her to\r\nreceive her. As soon as she arrived, the Court placed its theatre\r\nboxes at her disposal; she refused, saying that she would not go to\r\nthe theatre at all, though she has been to the Opera in the box of the\r\nDuchesse de Bauffremont. In our faubourg people are delighted with\r\nthis conduct, which seems to me utterly stupid and in bad taste.\" I\r\nalso think such pranks are ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAs you are reading the little Fenelon,[17] remember that I especially\r\nrecommend the third and fourth volumes; I consider it is equal to\r\nMadame de Sévigné and La Bruyère. The whole work is pervaded with the\r\ninimitable grace and the fine and gentle austerity of the Christian\r\nbishop, an aristocrat, a man of God and of the world, whose intellect\r\nwas terrifying, as Bossuet said.\r\n\r\n  [17] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\nI was starting in an hour and am very sorry to go. When and how shall\r\nI return? The unforeseen plays too large a part in the life of each of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 6, 1841._--At length I am in this huge Paris and my\r\nimpressions are by no means favourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 9, 1841._--Madame de Lieven wrote asking me to come and\r\nsee her, and I asked her to a quiet dinner with myself. She accepted\r\nthe invitation and appeared in full dress, less thin than before, and\r\nin good spirits. She told me that her Emperor is as unsociable as\r\never; that the little Princess of Darmstadt cannot endure the climate\r\nof St. Petersburg and that the cold has given her a red nose; the\r\nyoung heir is by no means in love with her, but will marry her. The\r\nPrincess assures me that nothing has been settled as regards\r\ndiplomatic changes; that Sainte-Aulaire will go to London and Flahaut\r\nto Naples and the rest remains a matter of chance. It is thought that\r\nPalmerston is secretly encouraging the strange actions of Ponsonby, as\r\nthe Eastern Question is by no means settled. Lord Granville has been\r\nobliged to resign on account of his health. Lady Clanricarde is very\r\nanxious to come to Paris, but the little Queen and Lady Palmerston do\r\nnot like her; however, she has been reconciled to Lord Palmerston,\r\nwhom she used to hate. It is said that the Queen would like to appoint\r\nLord Normanby to Paris, as he is a weak member of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nM. Decazes is so ill that people are thinking of his successor. Some\r\nmention M. Monnier as a possibility, and I have heard other names\r\nwhich I do not remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 10, 1841._--I should be glad to have something\r\ninteresting to say of Paris, where the clash and strife of interests\r\nis so strong, but I have nothing and seem to be more vacant and\r\nlistless even than at Rochecotte. Many words buzz about my ears and\r\nleave no impression and merely prevent the quiet course of my\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nYesterday after lunch I called upon Madame Adélaïde. She had heard\r\nthrough a third person that I was at Paris and had asked me to come. I\r\nhad not proposed to appear at the Château until after Easter. I found\r\nher ill and strangely changed; thin, bent, tired and grown old. She\r\nwas very pleasant, but really harassing with her interminable\r\ndiscourse upon the fortifications. I think she must have sent for me\r\nto discuss this subject, as if I had any opinion upon it or as if my\r\nidea could be of any importance. I was more interested by the portrait\r\nof Queen Christina of Spain which she showed me and which is an\r\nagreeable picture. This Queen did not go to Naples because her brother\r\nwould not receive her. She should now be at Lyons, and it is thought\r\nthat she will come back here where the Court seems to be favourably\r\ninclined to her. For the stout Infanta there seems to be less liking,\r\nand she has not increased her popularity recently by sending her three\r\neldest daughters into a convent for no obvious reason. Since her\r\narrival here she took the three Princesses to balls and other social\r\nfunctions, and now shuts them up in this way.\r\n\r\nM. Molé came to see me towards the end of the morning, and is very\r\ndepressed upon the subject of politics. The fact is quite clear that\r\nno one has gained either power or reputation. The Court seems to have\r\nbeen so entirely committed to these wretched fortifications which no\r\none wants, not even those who have voted for them, that the\r\nconsequences have been almost ridiculous. Many people's feelings have\r\nbeen hurt on this question and all who did not promise their vote were\r\nridiculed and insulted point blank. It is said that the Prince Royal\r\nhas not spared himself in the matter. I am very sorry, as I shall\r\nalways be about anything that may injure his position. At the present\r\nmoment he is at St. Omer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 12, 1841._--Some one has just come in to tell me a sad\r\npiece of news. The pretty Duchesse de Vallombrose, who was quite\r\nyoung, was confined of her second child a few days ago and was\r\nattacked with puerperal fever two days later. The servant whom I sent\r\nto inquire for her was told that she died last night. It is very\r\ndreadful. The little schoolmistress of Rochecotte was cured of this\r\nsame disease by country doctors, while the Duchesse de Vallombrose,\r\nwith the whole of the faculty about her, dies in spite of their\r\nsupposed science. Life indeed realises but little of what it promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 13, 1841._--The death of the Duchesse de Vallombrose\r\nwas yesterday a general subject of conversation. The unfortunate woman\r\nseems to have had no suspicion of her danger. A priest was fetched\r\nwho, fortunately on this occasion, was a capable man (the Abbé\r\nDupanloup), and was obliged to prepare her mind for this terrible\r\nconclusion. Deaths of this kind in the time of Louis XIV. would have\r\nproduced sudden conversions, but nothing can effect the worn-out\r\nemotions and the dead consciences of our age, where everything is flat\r\nand dull, at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 14, 1841._--M. de Sainte-Aulaire came to lunch with me\r\nyesterday to ask some questions concerning the nature of the London\r\nEmbassy and its social position, as he is preparing to move thither.\r\nM. Royer-Collard came in before he had gone and they talked of the\r\nFrench Academy and of a new Book which M. Nodier is preparing, _The\r\nHistory of Words_. People say that it will be a curious and serious\r\nwork, excellently written by a clever man, and a book of real\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard told me that on the day of his daughter's death his\r\nstudy door opened three times in a quarter of an hour to admit M.\r\nMolé, who was quite simple; M. Thiers, who was less so; and M. Guizot,\r\nwho was nothing of the kind. Their meeting made the incident stranger\r\nstill. M. Guizot fell upon the neck of M. Royer-Collard, pale and in\r\ntears, and the bereaved father felt too weak to keep him back, and I\r\nthink he was quite right. Two of M. Guizot's children had been\r\ndangerously ill, and had been saved by the care of M. Andral.[18] M.\r\nRoyer-Collard had called upon M. Guizot to congratulate him upon their\r\nrecovery, and since that time when the two men met in the Chamber,\r\nthey have shaken hands and exchanged a few words. As I am a supporter\r\nof peace in general, and think that the more we advance in life the\r\nmore we should incline in that direction, I told M. Royer-Collard more\r\nthan once that I was glad of the reconciliation.\r\n\r\n  [18] Dr. Andral was a son-in-law of M. Royer-Collard.\r\n\r\nMy children came to dinner with me and after they had gone I went to\r\nbed. I might go into society if I pleased, or give receptions here,\r\nbut I have an invincible dislike to these functions, and the hour\r\nduring which I am at home to friends seems to me the longest in the\r\nday. Our dear M. de Talleyrand, whose insight was so profound and who\r\nspoke more truly of every one than I realised at the time, told me\r\nvery correctly that when my children were married I should fall out of\r\nsociety. As a matter of fact I can no longer endure it. My priest, my\r\nWhite Sisters, my garden, my poor people and my workmen, are enough\r\nfor me. What one knows as friends in society are quite uninteresting\r\ncompared with them. Madame de Maintenon said, \"My friends interest me,\r\nbut my poor people touch my heart.\" I have often applied this phrase\r\nto my own case and understand its meaning fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 16, 1841._--Yesterday the eldest daughter of the Duc de\r\nRohan-Chabot, with whom we are connected, was married to the Marquis\r\nde Béthisy. It was a fine wedding, and all the high society of the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain were there. I was invited to the celebration.\r\nThe Church of St. Thomas d'Aquin could hardly contain the crowd; the\r\nthrong in the sacristy was overwhelming; people were elbowing one\r\nanother on the steps, while the driving rain increased the confusion,\r\nfar from diminishing the haste of the visitors to return home. The\r\nAbbé Dupanloup who daily baptizes, confesses, buries or marries some\r\none from our quarter, uttered a discourse which was somewhat long,\r\nthough it touched those who listened to it. But nearly every one was\r\nthinking of such wholly mundane affairs as dress and display. At\r\nParis, and in our society, marriage is rarely an event of any\r\nsolemnity, and the words of the priest are the only serious utterances\r\namid the extreme frivolity, in which the marriage service can scarcely\r\nbe heard. It was a sight which evoked more than one sad reflection,\r\nespecially for those who remembered that in the same church the\r\nevening before the last prayers were said over the coffin of the young\r\nand beautiful Duchesse de Vallombrose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 17, 1841._--Yesterday I took advantage of the kindness\r\nof the Comte de Rambuteau, who offered me his box for the last\r\nperformance of Mlle. Mars. There was a crowded audience and every one\r\nworth knowing was there, including the whole of the Royal Family.\r\nMlle. Mars exhausted all the artifices of her dress with surprising\r\nsuccess and all the resources of her talent with even greater success.\r\nHer voice was in no need of training or study: it was always fresh and\r\nperfectly modulated; if she would avoid parts that are too young for\r\nher and change her style she might have continued on the boards for a\r\nlong time to come. Her farewell performance was a brilliant event and\r\nshe was overwhelmed with flowers and applause. The _Misanthrope_ was\r\ndisgracefully murdered by the poor company and Mlle. Mars alone\r\nrespected Molière. In _les Fausses Confidences_, there was more unity\r\nand vigour and Mlle. Mars was a triumphant success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 25, 1841._--M. Royer-Collard in the course of his last\r\nvisit but one to my house told me that he had some twenty of M. de\r\nTalleyrand's letters which he would give me if I cared to have them. I\r\naccepted his offer, as I am glad to have as many of M. de Talleyrand's\r\nautographs as possible. He brought them to me the day before\r\nyesterday; yesterday I read them through and some are excellent for\r\nthe gracious and studied simplicity which was peculiar to his style.\r\nAmong them I found what I had long been seeking for, though I had\r\nnever been able to put my hand upon it; a copy of the letter which M.\r\nde Talleyrand wrote to Louis XVIII. when the memoirs of the Duc de\r\nRovigo on the subject of the Duc d'Enghien[19] appeared. I knew that\r\nhe had written it, but I had confused the dates and was under the\r\nimpression that this letter had been addressed to Lord Castlereagh\r\ninstead of to the King. M. de Talleyrand sent a copy of it to M. de\r\nRoyer-Collard, which copy I am now delighted to find again.\r\n\r\n  [19] This letter from M. de Talleyrand to King Louis XVIII. and\r\n  the reply sent to him by M. de Villèle in the King's name, may be\r\n  found in the appendix of the third volume of the _Memoirs of the\r\n  Prince de Talleyrand_.\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle, who has not been at Paris since 1830 is now there. This\r\nis an event for the Legitimist party. They are keenly anxious that he\r\nshould be reconciled to M. de Chateaubriand, and yet the two\r\ngentlemen have not met hitherto, simply for the reason that neither of\r\nthem will make the first call, though both declare that they would be\r\ndelighted to see one another again and to forget the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 26, 1841._--Yesterday before the benediction I said\r\ngood-bye to all my good friends of the Sacré Coeur. All these ladies\r\nare very proper and Madame de Gramont is quite an exceptional\r\npersonage for her cleverness, her kindness and her graciousness\r\ncombined with firmness. She is very kind to me and I am more at my\r\nease with her than with any society personage. The fact is that I am\r\nout of touch with society and realise the fact daily; society not only\r\ndisgusts me but irritates and displeases me. I am disturbed, wounded\r\nand agitated by it and go out less every day: the mental peace and\r\nbalance which I have recovered with such difficulty in my retirement\r\nare lost here. I am dissatisfied with myself and by no means satisfied\r\neven with those concerning whom I have no complaint to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 29, 1841._--Yesterday at the end of the morning I had an\r\ninfinite number of callers who came to say farewell and all seemed\r\nequally tiresome; I can only make one exception in the case of the\r\ngood and excellent Russian Ambassador,[20] who proposes to spend part\r\nof the summer at Carlsbad. His Sovereign is certainly not going to\r\nEms; it appears that the courts of St. Petersburg and of Berlin are\r\nnot upon good terms and that the King of Prussia sent his brother\r\nWilliam to be present at the wedding of the Hereditary Grand Duke\r\nmerely in order to avoid an open breach. The strained relations\r\nbetween these two Courts are due to an opposition of commercial\r\ninterests, to the unpopularity of the Russians in Germany which the\r\nGovernments cannot overlook and especially to the behaviour of the\r\nStates in the Grand Duchy of Posen and to the liberty there granted\r\nfor the use of the Polish language. The Emperor Nicholas flew into a\r\ntemper and said that he might as well be living next to the Chamber of\r\nFrench Deputies. These details are quite official. I have them from\r\nthe King himself whom I saw for a long time yesterday at his sister's\r\nhouse, to whom I went to say good-bye. I found both of them much\r\ndisturbed by the sentence of acquittal pronounced a few days ago in\r\nthe notorious case of the false letters attributed to the King.[21]\r\nThe verdict is in fact wrong and unjust, for no one knows the\r\nfoolishness of these letters better than myself. On this occasion we\r\ntalked of many matters which prove that no one can ever write too\r\nlittle, that hardly anything should be entrusted to paper and that\r\nletters should above all be destroyed. I went home feeling really\r\nterrified on this question.\r\n\r\n  [20] Count Pahlen.\r\n\r\n  [21] _See_ p. 15 (February 12, 1841). A judicial inquiry had been\r\n  begun against M. de Montour, the manager of the newspaper _la\r\n  France_, which had published the false letters. The matter was\r\n  long delayed by the defence, and did not come before a jury until\r\n  April 24. M. Berryer cleverly pleaded good faith on the part of\r\n  M. de Montour, who had thought the letters authentic, though he\r\n  had taken no pains to verify his belief. In the result the\r\n  manager of _la France_ was acquitted by six votes to six.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 1, 1841._--Yesterday I called upon the Duchesse d'Orléans\r\nto receive certain messages for Berlin. She showed me her two\r\nchildren: the eldest, the Comte de Paris, is the very image of his\r\ngrandfather, the King, though he is shy and delicate; the second is\r\nlike his mother and seems to be livelier than his brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 3, 1841._--The weather has grown cooler in consequence of\r\na storm during the night, which fortunately did not break soon enough\r\nto disturb the fireworks and the illuminations in honour of the\r\nbaptism of the young prince.[22] The ceremony at Notre Dame passed off\r\nvery well and was entirely noble and dignified. The little Prince was\r\ndelightful. Every one noticed the admirable bearing of the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans, her reverent bows and the care with which she crossed\r\nherself after entering the church. I should like to have gone, and the\r\nkindness of Madame Adélaïde had given me an excellent opportunity, but\r\nI was anxious about my daughter and did not go, as I did not wish to\r\nmiss the doctor's visit.[23]\r\n\r\n  [22] The Comte de Paris, born on August 24, 1838, was privately\r\n  baptized at the Tuileries on his birthday. He was not admitted\r\n  into the church until nearly three years later, when the ceremony\r\n  took place at Notre Dame with great splendour.\r\n\r\n  [23] The Marquise de Castellane was then seriously ill with\r\n  quinsy, from the effects of which she suffered for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 5, 1841._--M. Bresson, who came to say good-bye yesterday,\r\nseems destined to return to Madrid and is by no means pleased at the\r\nprospect. He evidently expected to go to Vienna. The King proposes to\r\nsend Montebello to that capital, but M. Guizot, who is influenced by\r\nMadame de Lieven, wishes Vienna to be given to M. de Flahaut. Rumours\r\nare in wide circulation that Madame de Lieven is making the\r\nappointments to ambassadorial posts, and there is a violent outcry\r\nagainst her in the French diplomatic body.\r\n\r\nPauline is better, but not well enough to accompany me to Berlin. I am\r\nsorry to leave her, and the long journey weighs upon my mind. It is\r\nreal isolation. I shall be truly glad when I find myself once more in\r\nTouraine; I feel that my real home is there, where I have my strongest\r\ninterests, duties and a useful centre of work. Anywhere else I exist\r\nbut do not put out roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metz, May 6, 1841._--I am now far from Paris and regret nothing in it\r\nexcept my daughter, and have no great hopes that my journey will be a\r\nrelaxation. I dread the annoyance of it and the wearing life of high\r\nroads and inns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mannheim, May 8, 1841._--I left Metz at midday, after a good rest. I\r\nthen came on here without stopping, arriving at ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning. I was not searched at the frontier, but a terrible storm in\r\nthe night almost made me lose courage. However, I literally made head\r\nagainst the storm, and am now at Mannheim. The inevitable\r\nSchreckenstein was waiting for me and wished to take me to the castle\r\nwhere a room was ready for me. I declined, and think that I pleased\r\nothers as much as myself by so doing. After dressing I called upon the\r\nGrand Duchess Stephanie who had placed a carriage at my disposal. She\r\nlooks better than she did at Umkirch when she was suffering from her\r\nterrible illness, but she can hardly move her left arm and remains a\r\nlittle lame. It is whispered that what she considers to be rheumatism\r\nis something much more serious; the doctors wish to send her to\r\nWildbad; she talks quite as usual. Princess Marie has grown rather\r\nheavy and is somewhat faded, not to any great extent, but there is no\r\nprospect that she will marry.\r\n\r\nI called upon Baroness Sturmfeder, who is outwardly a great lady, and\r\nupon old Walsch, who was beguiling her old age with the _Charivari_,\r\nthe _Wasps_ and the _Ready Made News_, lampoons which are now\r\nfashionable; from such sources she derives her ideas and her kindly\r\nsentiments. After leaving the castle I was driven to the Duchess\r\nBernard of Saxe Weimar whom I had seen in England; her husband is the\r\nloving and beloved uncle of the Duchess d'Orléans. This was a mark of\r\nrespect upon my part, the more advisable as I am bound to meet them\r\nbefore long at dinner at the castle. I have now returned and am\r\nresting until dinner-time, which is at half-past four.\r\n\r\nSince leaving Paris I have been reading a great deal, first a novel by\r\nBulwer, _Night and Morning_; it is not uninteresting, but not equal to\r\nthe early works of the same writer; then a short but delightful book,\r\n_The Letters of the Princesse de Condé_, sister of the last Duc de\r\nBourbon, who died in the Temple as a nun. These letters were written\r\nin her youth to one who is still living, and of whom she was very\r\nfond, and quite unselfishly so. This was M. Ballanche, the friend of\r\nMadame Récamier, who published the letters without appearing as the\r\nhero of them. They are authentic, marked by simplicity, tenderness and\r\nloftiness of thought, full of devotion, delicacy, sentiment, reason\r\nand courage, and written at a time and in a society when the author,\r\nher style and her sentiments were quite exceptional. The book is most\r\ndelightful.[24] Finally I have a small work by Lord Jocelyn, now the\r\nhusband of Fanny Cowper, concerning the English campaign in China. I\r\nwas attracted by the author's name, but found the book quite\r\nuninteresting.\r\n\r\n  [24] These letters are addressed to M. de La Gervaisais, a young\r\n  Breton gentleman, an officer of carbineers of Monsieur's\r\n  regiment. The Princesse de Condé had made his acquaintance in\r\n  1786 at Bourbon l'Archambault, where she had been to take the\r\n  waters, and her feeling for him was both deep and pure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mannheim, May 9, 1841._--Yesterday I dined with the Grand Duchess,\r\nwho afterwards showed me over the castle, which I pretended to see for\r\nthe first time. She told me so many things that I can hardly remember\r\nany of them. One point has remained in my mind, the fact that\r\nPrincess Sophia of Würtemberg, who married the Hereditary Prince of\r\nthe Low Countries, is on very bad terms with her mother-in-law, who\r\nwill not even see her son's children. This Queen has introduced the\r\nstrictest etiquette and an infinite variety of Court dress.\r\n\r\nI also learnt that the King of Prussia had passed a law making divorce\r\nvery difficult in his states. It certainly was scandalously easy to\r\nprocure; but the Grand Duchess, who was expecting the divorce of\r\nPrince Frederick of Prussia, was greatly vexed by this disappointment.\r\nThe fact is that poor Prince Frederick, whose wife is mad, ought to be\r\nprovided with some means of breaking so sad a tie. The first use he\r\nwould make of an opportunity would be to marry Princess Marie.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Weimar told me that her sister, the Dowager Queen of\r\nEngland,[25] had lost the use of one of her lungs and that the other\r\nwas very delicate. The sight of the Duchess of Weimar reminded me of\r\nLondon, Windsor and the best time of my life. Her likeness to her\r\nsister, which extends even to her voice, though this was not their\r\nbest feature, quite overcame me, as it reminded me of those years that\r\nare now so far away.\r\n\r\n  [25] Queen Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mannheim, May 10, 1841._--I am about to leave Mannheim after a very\r\nkind reception. The poor Grand Duchess constantly talks of her death,\r\nthough this does not prevent her making many plans. I wish she could\r\nrealise her idea of marrying her daughter. She took me for a drive\r\nyesterday along a pretty part of the bank of the Rhine. A port has\r\nbeen made at Mannheim which attracts commerce and brings some life to\r\nthis town where life has long been dormant. On the whole, I think the\r\ntown preferable to Carlsruhe. I had a letter from my son-in-law\r\nwritten the day after my departure from Paris. Pauline was going on\r\nfairly well, though her nerves were still shaken and she was very\r\nweak. He also says: \"At the Prince's baptism the register was signed\r\nin the following order: the King and his family, then the Cardinals,\r\nthe President and officials of the Chamber of Peers, then the\r\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies. Then came the turn of M. de\r\nSalvandy, the vice-president, who publicly refused to sign on the\r\nground that the Chamber of Deputies should not be represented as\r\ninferior to the Cardinals. He wishes to make a public matter of it,\r\nwhich will produce a bad effect, the more so as the Chamber, with\r\nreference to the law concerning secondary education, showed itself\r\nquite unfavourable to the religious reaction which is obviously in\r\nprogress; moreover, such susceptibility might easily cause an\r\nunpleasant outburst.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gelnhausen, May 11, 1841._--I travelled faster than I had thought\r\npossible, and instead of sleeping at Frankfort as I had intended I\r\nwent ten leagues further, and am now lodged in a little inn which at\r\nany rate is clean; this will allow me to reach Gotha to-morrow without\r\nspending part of the night in my carriage. I had lunch at Darmstadt.\r\nFrankfort aroused many memories as I passed through it, for it is a\r\ntown that I have crossed at different times, and in very different\r\ncircumstances. The first of these was the most important, for at\r\nFrankfort I was married. Afterwards I saw my good friend Labouchère\r\nthere for the first time; he has often reminded me of the incident\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchess Stephanie has given me a book which has just been\r\npublished at Stuttgart; obviously the publication was inspired by\r\nAustria, for the documents which the book contains seem to me to come\r\nfrom Vienna, and probably from the study of Prince Metternich or its\r\nneighbourhood. This little volume contains notes in French by Gentz\r\nupon several political questions, all treated in a spirit of great\r\nopposition to France. Their publication at this moment and the\r\neditor's preface seem to me to show that they have been produced with\r\na purpose. The most interesting part of the book to me is the journal\r\nof Gentz kept during his stay at the Prussian headquarters the week\r\nbefore the battle of Jena. He was a close observer and a lively\r\nwriter, and the result is quite interesting. There are also\r\ncommentaries upon a correspondence between Mr. Fox and M. de\r\nTalleyrand at the time when the peace of Amiens was broken. The book\r\ncan certainly offer several forms of attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gotha, May 12, 1841._--I had proposed to arrive here yesterday\r\nevening but the outskirts of Fulda and Eisenach are so complicated\r\nthat I had to sleep at Eisenach, where I naturally dreamt of St.\r\nElizabeth. I am staying here for a few hours to see the Dowager\r\nDuchess who was a great favourite of my mother and was quite vexed\r\nwith me last year because I left Germany without paying her a visit\r\nhere. Apart from this, my monotonous travels are proceeding without\r\nincident and in fairly fine weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wittenberg, May 13, 1841._--The Dowager Duchess of Gotha received me\r\nwith the utmost kindness, asked me to dinner and hurriedly invited\r\nfive or six people from the town who had known me in my youth. She\r\ndines at three o'clock and at six o'clock I asked leave to continue my\r\njourney. I would have stayed longer if the poor duchess had not grown\r\nso deaf that the honour of replying to her questions was literally\r\nexhausting. I preferred to spend the night in my carriage, for if I\r\nhad slept at Gotha, I should certainly have had to spend the evening\r\nat the Castle. I am therefore going to take my rest here that I may\r\nnot reach Berlin entirely exhausted. I have borne the journey very\r\nwell so far and my little halt at Mannheim was a pleasant interruption\r\nto the monotony of my life on wheels.\r\n\r\nFor the last two days I have been reading a life of Queen Blanche of\r\nCastile by a certain lady whose work was well reviewed; the facts are\r\ninteresting but the style is poor and the tone of the work is very\r\nanti-Catholic. While I am reading I cannot help conducting a silent\r\ncourse of refutation against the author; silence is very appropriate\r\nhere at Wittenberg, the old cradle of the Reformation. From the\r\nconvent of the Augustine monks, the ruins of which are now before my\r\neyes, Luther launched his first firebrand, and he was buried in the\r\nchurch by the side of the inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 15, 1841._--I arrived here yesterday evening but have\r\nseen no one yet except my business man, Herr von Wolff. At midday I\r\ncalled upon the Countess of Reede, the Queen's chief lady and an old\r\nfriend of my mother, and then upon the chief lady of the Princess of\r\nPrussia, to deliver the numerous parcels which the Duchesse d'Orléans\r\nhad asked me to take to this Princess. I then went to the Werthers, to\r\nCountess Pauline Neale and Madame de Perponcher and I found no one at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 16, 1841._--No one would guess who gave me his arm to the\r\nmass from which I have just come. It was Peter von Arenberg who has\r\ncome to ask that his property on the right bank of the Rhine should be\r\nmade an hereditary fief for one of his sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 17, 1841._--To-day is a day of sad and grievous memories,\r\nbeing the third anniversary of the death of our dear M. de Talleyrand.\r\nIt is a day which always arouses many recollections and I am sure that\r\nthese will not be without their influence upon others. I wish I could\r\nspend it in quiet thought, but that is impossible here.\r\n\r\nYesterday was an unusually busy day for me and I am quite wearied.\r\nMass was followed by the necessary calls upon the great ladies of the\r\ncountry; dinner with the Wolffs; tea with Princess William, the King's\r\naunt; a _prima sera_ with the Radziwills; while I spent the latter\r\npart of the evening with the old Prince of Wittgenstein. Besides all\r\nthis I had a long call from Humboldt who is starting for Paris in a\r\nfew days. It was impossible to breathe. The worst part of it is that\r\neverything here begins so early and that the day is divided in an\r\nunusual and very disagreeable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 18, 1841._--Yesterday I dined with the King and Queen who\r\nhad come to spend a few hours in town. They were both most kind and\r\npleasant. I saw Prince Frederick arrive from Dusseldorf, who is also\r\none of the old acquaintances of my youth. He still looks surprisingly\r\nyoung. His wife is expected here; she seems to have become totally\r\ninsane.\r\n\r\nI heard yesterday, while dining with the King, that one of the\r\nunfortunate Infantas of Spain whom their mother so cruelly placed in a\r\nconvent, had escaped with a Polish refugee, but had been caught at\r\nBrussels; a fine escapade for a princess! It seems impossible to\r\nrepress Spanish blood at the age of twenty. The King also said that\r\nEspartero had been proclaimed sole regent and dictator in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 20, 1841 (Ascension Day)._--Yesterday I went from Berlin\r\nto Potsdam by the first train. The King had asked me to be present at\r\na great parade. It was a fine spectacle. The weather was propitious,\r\nthe troops splendid, and the music magnificent, but the day was\r\nsomewhat fatiguing.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday I dined with the Princess of Prussia and in\r\nthe evening I went to a rout given by Countess Nostitz, the sister of\r\nCount Hatzfeldt. All that I have to do is to go about, to show good\r\ntemper, kindliness and gratitude for my many kind receptions; at the\r\nsame time, when I can return to my idle life I shall be delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 21, 1841._--There is a great monotony about life here;\r\ndinners with princes, etc. Yesterday I dined with Princess Charles,\r\nafter spending an hour with the Princess of Prussia, whose\r\nconversation is lofty and serious. In the evening I spent some time by\r\nthe arm-chair of the old Countess of Reede and with her daughter\r\nPerponcher. I was then obliged to show myself at the Werthers, who are\r\nat home on Thursdays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 22, 1841._--Yesterday evening I went to the Wolffs to\r\nmeet various learned men, artists and literary people. At Berlin the\r\nupper-middle-class society provides the pleasantest opportunities for\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThe present King has great ideas for adorning his capital, and is\r\ngiving a remarkable stimulus to Art.\r\n\r\nLife proceeds much as usual. Yesterday I dined with Princess William\r\nthe aunt, and spent the first part of the evening with the Princess of\r\nPrussia and the latter part of it with Madame de Perponcher, where a\r\ndistinguished artist, Hensel, showed us his sketch-book, which was\r\nfull of strange portraits. The heat was unusual.\r\n\r\nPrincess Frederick of Dusseldorf, who is not quite right in her head\r\nat times, was dining with Princess William. She must have been rather\r\npretty, and there is nothing unusual about her.\r\n\r\nPauline writes from Paris that she is going to Geneva for change of\r\nair and to try her strength, and that if she feels better, she will\r\ntravel through Bavaria and meet me at Vienna.\r\n\r\nI am returning this morning to Potsdam, where I have promised to spend\r\nthe day, and shall come back to-morrow. How pleasant it would be to\r\nfind myself once more in my little manor house at Touraine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 24, 1841._--As the evening party at Potsdam was over at\r\nten o'clock, I was able to return here in the evening by the last\r\ntrain, after spending the day with the Queen. She improves greatly\r\nupon close acquaintance, as is usually the case with persons who are\r\nsimple and somewhat reserved. We had a pleasant drive in the evening,\r\nand an interesting conversation at tea-time under the portico of the\r\nCharlottenhof, when the King talked much upon the state of Art in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 25, 1841._--Yesterday I went to the manœuvres with the\r\nPrincess of Prussia, her young son and Princess Charles. The King's\r\nstaff was most brilliant, our position was excellent, the weather was\r\nperfect, and the sight of the troops, of the spectators who had come\r\nfrom the town in crowds, of the ladies' carriages, and in short of the\r\nwhole gathering, made the subject worthy of the brush of Horace\r\nVernet; nor did the business last long, an hour and not more. The\r\nPrincess of Prussia took me back to lunch with her and kept me talking\r\nalmost until dinner-time. Madame Perponcher came to fetch me to dine\r\nnear her mother's chair, as her gout still keeps her somewhat of a\r\nprisoner. I then went to the Radziwills to the jubilee festival of the\r\nAcademy of Singing. The Academy is composed of four hundred and fifty\r\nmembers, amateurs of every class: by their rules they are not allowed\r\nto use any instrument but a piano and may perform only sacred music.\r\nThe institution thus resembles the Ancient Music at London, but the\r\nperformance here was infinitely better, and was marked by a unity, an\r\naccuracy and a majesty truly remarkable. None but Germans could thus\r\nsing the most complicated fugues without the help of an orchestra and\r\nwith such tremendous tone.\r\n\r\nI then went to an evening reception given by the Countess Neale, where\r\nLord William Russell told me that his Ministry had suffered a heavy\r\ndefeat in Parliament, but he did not seem to think they would resign.\r\nHe told me that poor Mitford, whom I recently met unexpectedly as he\r\nwas leaving the diligence at Fulda to meet his wife at Wiesbaden,\r\nfound that she had deserted him with Francis Molyneux of all people.\r\nShe is not very young or very beautiful, and she has several children.\r\n\r\nMy son, Valençay, writes that the races at Chantilly were most\r\nbrilliant and fashionable. He stayed at the Château, and is loud in\r\nhis praises. He says that the Infanta who was caught and brought back,\r\nis now staying with Madame Duchâtel, the wife of the Minister of the\r\nInterior, as she positively refuses to return to her mother, whom she\r\nfears would beat her. She persists in saying that she married the\r\nPole, but refuses to disclose the name of the priest who married them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 26, 1841._--The old King of the Low Countries, who is\r\nhere incognito as the Comte de Nassau, is in very bad health, and is\r\nsaid to be attacked by senile gangrene. His wife,[26] who is very\r\nkindly treated by the Prussian Royal Family, takes great care of the\r\nKing who cannot do without her for a moment. She never leaves his\r\nside. People say that she is really very bored and disgusted by this\r\nillustrious marriage which Holland will not recognise in spite of the\r\nold King's fury. The refusal to give recognition in Holland is based\r\nupon the fact that the marriage banns were not published, nor did any\r\none venture to publish them, as the most violent public demonstrations\r\nwere feared.\r\n\r\n  [26] The Comtesse d'Oultremont.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning I accompanied the Wolffs and Herr von Olfers, the\r\nDirector of the School of Fine Arts, to the studio of Wichmann, to\r\nwhom I had given an order to copy a charming model that I had seen of\r\na nymph drawing water. It will be finished in a year.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Prussia paid me a long and interesting visit. He talked\r\na great deal about the state of the country and the difficulty of\r\ngovernment. Difficulties there certainly are, but there is also here a\r\nsolid basis on which to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 28, 1841._--Yesterday morning was spent with Herr von\r\nWolff discussing business. Our conversation was interrupted by the\r\nCourt High Marshal, who brought me a very touching present from the\r\nKing. It is a copy in iron of a statue which I had admired last year\r\nat Charlottenhof; a young faun upon a pillar in the midst of a basin\r\npouring water out of an urn upon which he is crouched. The whole work\r\nis six feet high and very pretty. The King told me that he would ask\r\nme to have it placed upon one of the terraces of Rochecotte, which\r\nshall certainly be done.\r\n\r\nI dined with Princess Albert. Her father is better, and she is\r\nstarting with him shortly for Silesia. Her husband wearied me, and she\r\nherself is like a colt broken loose. In fact the whole household was\r\nnot to my taste. Herr and Frau von Redern, who were also dining there,\r\ntook me to their box to hear Seidelmann in the part of the Jew.[27] He\r\nis now the fashionable actor, but he compares unfavourably with my\r\nrecollections of Iffland.\r\n\r\n  [27] In Shakspere's _Merchant of Venice_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 30, 1841._--The Radziwills most kindly arranged a musical\r\nmatinée at their house in a pretty vaulted room opening on to their\r\nsplendid garden. Goethe's _Faust_ was performed which had been set to\r\nmusic by the late Prince Radziwill, the father of the present\r\ngeneration. Devrient, the first tragedian from the Berlin theatre,\r\ndeclaimed certain passages to musical accompaniments, and a large body\r\nfrom the Conservatoire gave the choruses. The general effect was\r\nexcellent and gave me real pleasure.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] Prince Anton Radziwill had been sent to Göttingen to\r\n  conclude his studies, and while he was then staying in Germany in\r\n  1794, he made the acquaintance of Goethe, who was already working\r\n  at the first part of _Faust_. Prince Radziwill was profoundly\r\n  attracted by the beauty of this work, and as he was himself a\r\n  most enthusiastic musician he undertook to put certain scenes of\r\n  the great poet's creation to music, and completed the work of\r\n  composition by degrees. The Prince was on terms of personal\r\n  intimacy with Goethe, who slightly modified the garden scene\r\n  between Faust and Margaret at his request. The first performance\r\n  of _Faust_ with Prince Radziwill's music was given at Berlin in\r\n  1819, at the Palace Theatre of Monbijou, before the whole of the\r\n  Prussian court. The Berlin Academy of Music, to which the Prince\r\n  presented his work, has performed it almost annually since that\r\n  date.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 31, 1841._--I propose to leave here to-morrow for Dresden\r\nand to proceed thence to Vienna.\r\n\r\nYesterday I went to the High Mass of Pentecost which was very well\r\nperformed and sung in the Catholic church, but the church was so\r\ncrowded and the heat so suffocating that I thought I should be ill.\r\nHowever, on leaving Mass I had to appear at the farewell audiences of\r\nthe Princess of Prussia and of Princess Charles, and then to dine with\r\nan old friend. While we were at table I received an invitation to go\r\nto tea at Schönhausen, the summer residence of the King, two leagues\r\nfrom Berlin. I was fortunately able to reach Schönhausen in time, and\r\nafter tea I stayed on to supper which was served in the open air under\r\na verandah lighted by lamps. Apart from the Royal Family and the\r\nofficials on duty there were the Duke and Duchess of Leuchtenberg,\r\nHerr von Arenberg, myself, Rauch, Thorwaldsen and the chief director\r\nof the museum, Herr von Olfers. It was an agreeable and interesting\r\nparty. Thorwaldsen has a fine head resembling that of Cuvier, but he\r\nwears his hair in a strange manner, long white locks falling over his\r\nshoulders. I prefer the features of Rauch which are better\r\nproportioned, and in my opinion nobler and simpler. The Duchess Marie\r\nof Leuchtenberg is extremely like her father, the Emperor Nicholas,\r\nthough with a very different expression: her head is classical in\r\nform, but too long for her body which is small; she is as white as a\r\nlily, but her finical and fantastic manners did not charm me. The\r\nQueen had mentioned me to her, and the King introduced me to the Duke\r\nof Leuchtenberg, who is strikingly like his sister, the Duchess of\r\nBraganza, though his general appearance is common and does not justify\r\nthe marriage he has made. At Schönhausen I paid my last farewells.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, June 2, 1841._--The day before yesterday I left Berlin\r\noverwhelmed and spoilt with kindness, but wearied by the dreadful\r\nheat. The Baron von Werther whom I saw on my last day at Berlin, told\r\nme he feared that M. Bresson had not been entirely happy during the\r\nlast years of his stay; that his speech had caused much displeasure\r\nand inspired great distrust; that he was ill-informed if he thought\r\nthe contrary; and that all his reliable sources of information had\r\nbeen closed since the death of the old King. The Princess of Prussia\r\nand Madame Perponcher spoke to the same effect. I also learnt that\r\nwhen the treaty of July 15 was made known here, M. Bresson committed\r\nan inconceivable outburst, drove down the _Unter den Linden_ and\r\nshouted war in the wildest manner. I am really sorry that he should\r\nre-enter upon a position that he has spoilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, June 3, 1841._--Yesterday evening I went to the theatre to\r\nsee the new auditorium which has a great reputation throughout\r\nGermany. It is, in fact, of considerable size, pretty and well\r\ndecorated. The boxes are convenient, the seats comfortable and there\r\nis an air of grandeur about the whole. The decorations are fresh, the\r\ncostumes brilliant and the orchestra good, but the singers so bad that\r\nI could only stay for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prague, June 5, 1841._--Prague is not without interest for me. I\r\nthere spent the year of mourning for my father with my mother and\r\nsisters and afterwards revisited the town upon two occasions shortly\r\nafter the Congress of Vienna. I have been spending to-day there and\r\nthink I have driven round to every object of interest: the chief\r\nchurches, the tomb of Tycho Brahé and his observatory; all the\r\nofferings in honour of St. John Nepomucenos, his relics, the old\r\ncastle, the Calvary from whence Prague is to be seen as a panorama;\r\nWallenstein's war horse, which has been stuffed, and the various\r\ntraces of the Hussite war and of the Thirty Years War; the bombs\r\nthrown by Frederick II.; the chapel where Charles X. prayed twice a\r\nday and which was restored by him, bears the arms of France and of\r\nNavarre. Prague, like Nuremburg, is one of the oldest towns in\r\nGermany: the latter may be more interesting to artists, but the former\r\nis more attractive to the archaeologist, and I am one of the latter\r\nclass. Prague contains sixteen convents, every class of monk is to be\r\nfound there, and though upon a much larger scale it reminds me of\r\nFriburg in Switzerland. Especially characteristic are the large\r\nresidences, almost all kept by the great Bohemian lords who own them\r\nand who are generally deserting Prague in favour of Vienna. I was\r\ncurious enough to look in at the theatre of the Leopold Stadt to see a\r\nlocal farce played by a Vienna company. The auditorium which was by no\r\nmeans beautiful, was crowded and the laughter was loud and long; I\r\nstayed only a short time as it was too hot and the Vienna lazzi are\r\nnot to my taste. I do not understand them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 8, 1841._--I had a most unpleasant journey from Prague\r\nhither. The weather had broken: it was cold, stormy, and damp; I spent\r\nthe first night in my carriage and the second in a small inn,\r\neventually arriving here at three o'clock this afternoon. I am staying\r\nin rooms which my sisters had engaged for me. I have already seen my\r\nquondam brother-in-law, the Count of Schulenburg, whom I shall make my\r\nmajor-domo, for which position he is exactly suited.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to be once more at Vienna.[29] The whole of my destiny\r\nis contained in the name of this city, and here my life of devotion to\r\nM. de Talleyrand began and that strange and unusual association was\r\nformed which could only be broken by death, though broken is the wrong\r\nword; I should have said interrupted, for I have constantly felt\r\nduring the past year that we shall meet elsewhere. At Vienna I entered\r\nupon that troublesome and attractive life of publicity which rather\r\nwearies than flatters me. I found much amusement here and many\r\noccasions for tears: my life became complicated and I was involved in\r\nthe storms which have so long roared about me. Of the many who turned\r\nmy head and provided me with amusement and excitement, none remain.\r\nOld and young, men and women, all have disappeared; indeed the whole\r\nworld has undergone two changes since that time. My poor sister with\r\nwhom I was to live, is also dead. Prince Metternich alone remains; he\r\nhas sent me very pleasant messages and I shall probably see him\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n  [29] The author had accompanied the Prince de Talleyrand to\r\n  Vienna for the Congress of 1815, and the Prince refers to the\r\n  incident in his Memoirs as follows: \"I also thought that it was\r\n  necessary to destroy the hostile prejudice with which imperial\r\n  France had inspired the high and influential society of Vienna;\r\n  for this purpose the French Embassy must be made a social centre.\r\n  I therefore asked my niece, the Comtesse Edmond de Périgord, to\r\n  accompany me and do the honours of my house. Her readiness and\r\n  tact caused general satisfaction, and were highly useful to me.\"\r\n  (Vol. II. p. 208.)\r\n\r\nI doubt if I shall sleep to-night; I am greatly disturbed by the\r\nghosts which haunt these scenes and which all speak with one voice of\r\nthe vanity of the things of this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 10, 1841._--The choice of M. de Flahaut as French\r\nambassador here, which recent news from Paris represents as\r\nincreasingly possible, has aroused general dissatisfaction. Madame de\r\nFlahaut wrote to Lord Beauvale, the English ambassador, to try and\r\ndisarm this opposition and said that people need not be afraid of her\r\nhusband's appointment as she would not be able to follow him for a\r\nlong time. This is certainly an unusual method of seeking popularity.\r\n\r\nI went back to my house yesterday at two o'clock in the afternoon to\r\nawait Prince Metternich who had sent word to say that he would come at\r\nthat time. He kept his appointment and I did not find him greatly\r\nchanged. It is a real pleasure to see him again and to find him in\r\npossession of all his freshness of mind, his power of judgment, his\r\nwide knowledge of men and affairs and his genial kindness to myself\r\nwhich has never varied. He stayed for two hours upon which I look back\r\nwith great pleasure. As a rule he never pays personal visits. His wife\r\nsent to say that she would have come if she had not been afraid of\r\nwearying me, as she was extremely anxious to make my acquaintance. No\r\none could have been kinder; I am dining with them to-day in their\r\nsuburban villa where they are spending the spring.\r\n\r\nI hear that Schlegel, the platonic admirer of Madame de Staël, is at\r\nBerlin to help in the publication of the works of Frederick the Great.\r\nM. Thiers was expected there and I am glad to have missed him. It has\r\nbeen decided to receive him as a member of the Academy and as a\r\nhistorian, but not as a politician and certainly not as a statesman.\r\nMeanwhile M. Guizot seems to be taking walks with the Princess de\r\nLieven at nine o'clock in the morning in the gardens of the Tuileries,\r\nwhich is their mode of observing nature.\r\n\r\nI found that Marshal Marmont had called when I came home yesterday\r\nevening. I had seen him from a distance at the opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 11, 1841._--Yesterday I dined with Prince Metternich. He\r\nhas a pretty house like a small edition of Neuilly, and has collected\r\nmany artistic objects which are tastefully interspersed with fine\r\nflowers and many other things without any appearance of overcrowding.\r\nThere were at dinner, apart from the master and mistress of the house,\r\nonly the unmarried daughter of his first marriage, my sisters, the\r\nLouis Saint-Aulaire, husband and wife, and the two Herren von Hügel,\r\nwho are constant visitors at the house. Princess Metternich is very\r\npretty, quite natural and attractive, an original character; and as\r\nshe was kind enough to be anxious to please me, she naturally\r\nsucceeded without difficulty. After dinner I called upon some members\r\nof the Hohenzollern family who are here, and finally went to tea with\r\nan old friend of my sisters'. There were a dozen people present who\r\nwere all unknown to me apart from Prince Windisch-Graetz, a Count\r\nO'Donnel, a survivor of the Hotel de Ligne, and Marshal Marmont, who\r\ndid not seem to have changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 12, 1841._--Yesterday morning I went with my sisters to\r\ncall upon their great friend Princess Amelia of Sweden, at whose house\r\nI met her sister, the Grand Duchess of Oldenberg; she is going to\r\nMunich with her husband to see the Queen of Greece, who has come there\r\nin the course of a tour. I then called upon a Polish lady whom I had\r\nknown long ago at the house of Princess Tyszkiewicz at Paris, whose\r\nniece she was. She was then called Madame Sobánska and enjoyed a\r\ncertain reputation. I found her considerably changed; she is a person\r\nof wit and some beauty, but is rather spiteful and a gossip--a\r\ncharacter to be feared. I had hardly returned from these calls when\r\nMarshal Marmont came in. He talked a great deal of his anxiety to\r\nreturn to France, but I think pecuniary rather than political reasons\r\nare the hindrance. He spends his life here at the French Embassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 14, 1841._--Yesterday I went to hear mass at the Church\r\nof the Capuchins, with the intention of afterwards seeing Father\r\nFrancis, who was with my sister in her last moments. I was anxious to\r\nlearn from him some details on the subject of religion which my other\r\nsisters could not give me. I found him a pleasant and clever man, who\r\nseemed to conceal beneath his mendicant friar's dress a considerable\r\nknowledge of the world and a considerable power of making his way in\r\nit. He is said to be the director here of all whose consciences are\r\ndivided between God and the world, a difficult task in which success\r\nis not easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 15, 1841._--Louis de Sainte-Aulaire came to see me\r\nyesterday morning. He told me that the illness of Marshal Soult to\r\nwhich the newspapers refer, is not so much connected with the law\r\nconcerning recruiting, against which the Duc d'Orléans publicly voted,\r\nas due to an outbreak of paternal rage. He regards the nomination of\r\nM. de Flahaut to Vienna as a slight upon his son; he threatened to\r\nresign, and it is not yet known whether M. de Flahaut will have the\r\nhonour of dislocating the Cabinet or whether he will be obliged to\r\nabandon Vienna. M. Bresson has started from Paris for Berlin in a very\r\nbad temper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 16, 1841._--Yesterday I had a letter from Madame de\r\nLieven from Paris; she writes as follows: \"Marshal Soult has caused a\r\nsmall municipal crisis. The Duc d'Orléans voted against him upon the\r\nrecruiting law: the Marshal's views were rejected and he was extremely\r\nangry; the result being a fit of palpitations with a possibility of an\r\napoplectic stroke; hence the threat to resign. It is very doubtful\r\nwhether he can be appeased, and his wife is most anxious about his\r\nhealth. It is a great perplexity, as the two positions which he\r\noccupied will have to be filled. M. Guizot has resolved not to become\r\nPresident of the Council; however, there is some hope that the\r\nMarshal will remain in office. In England there is a far more serious\r\ncrisis. Parliament will be probably be dissolved to-morrow, but the\r\nelectoral outlook is doubtful. Possibly a House of Commons may be\r\nreturned similar to the House now to be dissolved, in which case it\r\nwill be impossible for any one to govern the country. Meanwhile much\r\nagitation prevails. The Eastern Question is by no means settled; on\r\nthe contrary, Turkey grows daily more disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Jersey is anxious for her daughter to marry Nicholas Esterhazy.\r\nThe young people are extremely fond of one another. Paul Esterhazy is\r\ntrying to get out of the matter which is difficult.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince de Joinville was most warmly received at the Hague. The\r\nKing and Queen overwhelmed him with marks of violence. What impression\r\nwill this make at St. Petersburg?\r\n\r\n\"M. de Flahaut has been nominated as Ambassador to Vienna. The\r\nproposal has been accepted but with no great warmth. In any case there\r\ncan be no further changes or nominations, for the London post remains\r\nvacant, as Lord Palmerston will not conclude the eastern problem, and\r\nnothing will be done until Sainte Aulaire has gone to London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 17, 1841._--Charles de Talleyrand came yesterday to tell\r\nme the latest news from Paris. Marshal Soult's quarrel has been\r\nsettled: he will remain in office, and his son-in-law will go to Rome\r\nas ambassador; the Marshal is to receive 600,000 francs in payment of\r\nsome loan which he professes to have made to the State. The\r\nTurko-Egyptian business is settled: the act will be ratified and sent\r\nto Alexandria, and the five Courts will meet at London if they have\r\nnot already come to an agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 18, 1841._--Yesterday evening I went to hear a German\r\ntragedy and then to tea with Prince Metternich. At the end of the\r\nevening the Prince began to talk over a round table, and was most kind\r\nand interesting. Except on Sundays when they are at home he sees very\r\nlittle society, and his house in my opinion is the pleasanter in\r\nconsequence. Marshal Marmont is there every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 19, 1841._--Yesterday I went with my sisters to visit\r\nthe Imperial Picture Gallery. I am surprised that it is not better\r\nknown, for it contains some most beautiful works. It lies outside the\r\ntown in a palace called the Belvedere, which was built by Prince\r\nEugène of Savoy. The interior is very handsome.\r\n\r\nI dined at the house of Princess Paul Esterhazy and with Prince and\r\nPrincess Metternich and their daughter, Prince Wenzel, Lichtenstein,\r\nSchulenburg, Lord Rokeby, Count Haugwitz and Baron von Hügel. Princess\r\nEsterhazy was very amusing with her fear of Lady Jersey as\r\nmother-in-law. The marriage, however, has not been definitely settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 21, 1841._--I am delighted to hear that you like\r\nFenelon's Letters.[30] They explain everything in a form which\r\nillustrates the faithful and courageous devotion paid to this kindly\r\nand holy Archbishop by the courtiers of the great King. He is able to\r\ngive a charm and a grandeur to religion, to make it at once simple and\r\nattractive by its loftiness. If to read the story with his intercourse\r\nwith his friends does not produce conversion, at any rate no one can\r\nfail to derive from it a love of goodness, of beauty, and a desire to\r\nlead a better life as a prelude to a good death.\r\n\r\n  [30] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\nThe _History of Port Royal_ by Sainte-Beuve is certainly interesting.\r\nIt is a great subject, but treated in a style which is neither\r\nsufficiently serious nor simple, and cannot worthily represent the\r\naustere and imposing figures of Jansenism.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 25, 1841._--I propose to start next Wednesday and from\r\nPrague to take the road which will bring me back to my nieces in\r\nSaxony; from thence I shall go by Lusatia to upper Silesia to see my\r\nsister Hohenzollern who will be there at that time, and shall\r\nafterwards go to my own property at Wartenberg where I hope to be on\r\nJuly 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 26, 1841._--Yesterday I dined with Prince Metternich;\r\nonly the family were present. I went on to the theatre and afterwards\r\nto the _Volksgarten_, a kind of Tivoli, where Strauss plays his\r\nwaltzes, where Styrians sing and all the good or bad society of Vienna\r\nmeets during this season. My sisters who were with me, then took me to\r\ntheir house where we had tea.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston rouses much discontent as he continually raises some\r\nnew obstacle when the Egyptian question is at the point of conclusion.\r\nHis conduct is strangely tactless. All kinds of conjectures are in the\r\nair and much exasperation was displayed where I was dining yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 28, 1841._--The weather here yesterday was most\r\nremarkable: after midday a violent wind arose which raised clouds of\r\ndust, completely shrouding the town and suburbs; the burning wind was\r\na real sirocco which withered and exhausted every one.\r\n\r\nI went to mass at the Capuchin church to say goodbye to Father Francis\r\nwho gave me his blessing. I then returned home to wait for Marshal\r\nMarmont who had asked permission to read me forty pages from the\r\nmanuscript of his memoirs which he has devoted to justifying his\r\nconduct during July 1830. I was unable to refuse. I learnt nothing\r\nparticularly fresh, as I knew all the remarkable facts which clearly\r\nprove that the imbecility of the Government was incomparable and that\r\nthe Marshal was very unfortunate in being called to conduct a business\r\nboth ill-devised and ill-prepared; so he needed no justification in my\r\neyes, but I was interested to hear full details of the scene with the\r\nDauphin, of which I knew nothing and the words and gestures of which\r\npass the powers of imagination.[31] The reading was interrupted by\r\nvarious reflections and was further prolonged for the reason that the\r\nMarshal reads slowly and continually stammers and hums and haws. His\r\ndelivery is extremely laboured.\r\n\r\n  [31] This lamentable scene, the sad event which marked the last\r\n  evening which Charles X. and the Dauphin spent at Saint-Cloud, is\r\n  related at length in the memoirs of the Duc de Raguse, to which\r\n  reference is here made (Vol. VIII. Book XXIV.), and is partly\r\n  reproduced in a book by M. Imbert de Saint-Amand, entitled The\r\n  _Duchesse de Berry and the Revolution of 1830_, which appeared in\r\n  1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nI then went with my brother-in-law, Schulenberg, to dine with the\r\nCountess Nandine Karolyi at Hitzinger, a village near Schönbrunn. I\r\nwas by no means anxious to go but as she had been so kind as to ask\r\nme, I could not refuse. She lives in one half of a charming cottage\r\nwhich belongs to Charles von Hügel, the traveller whose infatuation\r\nfor Princess Metternich drove him to spend seven years in the East. On\r\nhis return he built this house and has filled it with curiosities from\r\nIndia. He lives in one half of the house and Nandine in the other. It\r\nis prettily situated, surrounded with flowers and looks quite English.\r\nI was by no means delighted with the dinner. The mistress of the house\r\nis eccentric, an exaggeration of the Vienna type, and the gentlemen\r\nabout her corresponded. I went away as soon as possible and spent an\r\nhour in farewell talk with Princess Louise of Schönburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 29, 1841._--Yesterday at night-fall I went with my\r\nsisters, Schulenberg and Count Haugwitz to the Volksgarten where the\r\nwhole of Vienna does its best to enjoy the dew amid clouds of tobacco\r\nsmoke. Fireworks and Strauss were the amusements provided. One\r\npositive refreshment was the ices, of which an enormous quantity\r\nseemed to be consumed. The population of Vienna are quiet,\r\nwell-dressed, entirely respectable and very mixed, for in these\r\namusements the aristocracy take part. There was no sign of a\r\npoliceman, nor were any needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, June 30, 1841._--I am leaving Vienna this evening. The heat\r\ncontinues to be extreme and will make my journey very unpleasant. I\r\nshall not send off this letter until I reach Dresden; correspondence\r\nis more certain outside the Austrian states. I do not mind people\r\nreading my expressions of affections, but my impressions and opinions\r\nare another matter. I trust therefore that I have been prudent in this\r\nrespect during my stay here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tabor, July 1, 1841._--I left Vienna yesterday at seven o'clock in\r\nthe evening. In the afternoon I had a visit from Prince Metternich. He\r\nwas kind and confidential, and the idea that he has deteriorated is\r\nquite wrong. Perhaps he expresses himself more slowly and vaguely\r\nthan he used to do, but his ideas are in no way confused, his opinions\r\nare firm and decided, he remains moderate and gentle in temper, and in\r\nshort is entirely himself. He strongly advised me to return by way of\r\nJohannisberg, whither he will go from Königswart in the month of\r\nAugust and stay until September. His wife urged me to do the same and\r\nshowed me the utmost kindness. Her beauty strongly appeals to me,\r\nthough it is a style often spoilt by harshness of voice, common\r\nmanners or vulgar language. She is generally disliked at Vienna to my\r\nastonishment, for I think she is good-hearted though unpolished.\r\nSeveral people kindly came to say good-bye at the last moment. My\r\nsisters, with Schulenburg and Count Maurice Esterhazy, who is the\r\nsmallest and liveliest of the family, accompanied me two leagues\r\nbeyond Vienna, where my travelling carriage was waiting for me. Count\r\nEsterhazy is the same who was at Paris; he was afterwards attached to\r\nthe Austrian embassy at Berlin, where I last saw him. This post he\r\nleft a few days before I came to Vienna, as he is going to Italy,\r\nwhere his mother is now lying ill. He is a close friend of my\r\nsisters', somewhat malicious like all very small men, but a pleasant\r\ntalker and far more civilised and in better taste than people\r\ngenerally are at Vienna, especially the men, who are usually very\r\nignorant. On the whole I prefer Berlin to Vienna society. At Vienna\r\npeople are richer and more high and mighty and their naturalness is\r\naffected: at Berlin I admit there is more affectation, but there is\r\nmuch more culture and intellectualism. Life at Vienna is extremely\r\nfree and easy: people do anything they please without being regarded\r\nas eccentric, but though no one is surprised at his neighbour's doings\r\nslander is as commonly current as elsewhere, and I am ready to assert\r\nthat a false good nature of a very dangerous kind is prevalent. At\r\nBerlin life is more formal and more attention is paid to a certain\r\ndecorum: the consequence is some stiffness, but words are more\r\ncarefully weighed, and as there is less reason for backbiting there is\r\nmore real kindliness. Personally I have nothing but praise for the\r\nhospitality of either town and remain entirely grateful to them both.\r\nI was especially struck at Vienna by the manner in which men and women\r\ncommonly address one another by their baptismal names; however slight\r\nacquaintanceship is, provided people belong to the same clique, family\r\nnames disappear, and to use them is thought a mark of bad taste. Women\r\nare constantly kissing one another and invariably upon the lips, which\r\nI think horrible. Men continually kiss ladies' hands, and at first\r\nsight society seems to be composed of brothers and sisters. Perhaps\r\ntwenty people in speaking to me or in reference to me would say\r\n\"Dorothea;\" those less familiar would say \"Duchess Dorothea;\" the most\r\nformal would use the term \"dear Duchess,\" but no one would say\r\n\"Madame\" or \"Madame la Duchesse.\" I am astonished that anything\r\nremains of my hands; and my cheeks, which I try to substitute for my\r\nlips, have suffered a perfect martyrdom. The coquetry of the women at\r\nVienna is obvious, nor is any attempt made to disguise it, though the\r\nchurches are full and the confessionals besieged; but there is no\r\nappearance of real devotion, and the sincere and active faith of the\r\nRoyal Family has no influence upon society, which displays its\r\nindependence by habitual opposition to the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, July 3, 1841._--I have now returned to my starting point of\r\na month ago. I came here from Tabor without stopping, except for\r\ndinner at Prague and for lunch this morning at Teplitz. I am never\r\nwearied by the country between Teplitz and Dresden. It is Saxony in\r\nall its beauty, rich and smiling and pleasantly united to the strength\r\nand wildness of Bohemia. It is the only picturesque part of the\r\njourney between Vienna and Dresden apart from Prague and its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAt the gates of Teplitz I saw a procession of pilgrims descending from\r\na chapel upon a hill with rosaries in their hands, singing psalms; it\r\nwas a touching sight and I should like to have gone up to worship in\r\nmy turn but the approach of a storm obliged me to continue my journey\r\nwithout stopping.\r\n\r\nI am reading the _History of the Life, the Writings and the_\r\n_Doctrine of Luther_ by M. Audin. It is the most learned, impartial,\r\ninteresting and Catholic study of the subject that I have come across.\r\nAs I left Vienna I finished the _Life of the Saint Dominic_ by the\r\nAbbé Lacordaire, which is written with a view to effect and pleased me\r\nonly moderately.\r\n\r\nI hear in the inn that M. Thiers has been expected for the last three\r\ndays. I hope he will not arrive until after my departure to-morrow. I\r\npropose to reach Königsbruck this evening and to stay a few days with\r\nmy nieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Königsbruck, July 5, 1841._--I reached here yesterday at five\r\no'clock. At Dresden I had a call from Duke Bernard of Saxe Weimar who\r\nwas staying in the same hotel as myself. He was coming from Berlin\r\nwhere he had been spending a fortnight with his niece, the Princess of\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\nIn the same hotel I also met Countess Strogonoff, formerly Countess\r\nEga, whom I had seen last year at Baden and who then pleased me\r\ngreatly. She told me that as soon as I had left Baden, Madame de\r\nNesselrode spent every evening until she started for Paris at the\r\npublic gaming-table, playing Benacet, opposite the old Elector of\r\nHesse, and that she lost or won during the evening with the same\r\nimperturbable calmness the twenty louis which she had made her limit.\r\nWhat a strange person!\r\n\r\nAt Dresden during mass I saw the widow of Prince Maximilian of Saxony,\r\nwho had returned from Rome where she married her chamberlain, a\r\ncertain Count Rossi, a cousin of the husband of Fraulein Sontag. She\r\nis obliged to return to Dresden from time to time under the terms of\r\nher marriage settlement. Her husband accompanies her and continues to\r\nact as chamberlain. She seems to me to be neither young nor pretty,\r\nwell made nor fashionable; he is a tall man with an imperial beard and\r\nthe air peculiar to the husband of a princess.\r\n\r\nI also found here the Count of Hohenthal, his wife and Fanny, my two\r\nnieces, who received me most affectionately and were full of their\r\ntravels in Italy. The weather is beautiful and the peace and silence\r\nof the country are delightful. I have also found letters from Paris.\r\nM. Molé writes four pages which seem to contain no news except that\r\nMadame de Lieven reigns and governs at Paris, to say the least of her.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra tells me that the Princesse de Lieven is\r\ngiving little musical evenings to bring out her niece, Countess\r\nAnnette Apponyi. The princesse is resuming all the tastes of her youth\r\nand happiness. It will be fortunate if the powers of M. Guizot would\r\nalso revive the destinies of France and make them flourish.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Montmorency writes to say that the Vicomtesse de\r\nChateaubriand has gone to take up her duties with the Duchesse de\r\nBerry. Would any one have suspected that she was a court lady? She has\r\nsought this distinction long ago. She took with her the nurse of the\r\nDuc de Bordeaux, the one who was only able to nurse him for three\r\ndays. It is a strange journey and I do not understand the meaning of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles writes to say that in view of Eastern events\r\nbrought about by the successive revolt of the provinces, a movement at\r\nParis is being prepared similar to that which took place to meet the\r\ncase of Greece some years ago. A committee is being formed for the\r\nrelief, that is to say, for the revolt of the Christian populations in\r\nthe East. This committee is composed of men from the Left and the\r\nCentre; the Legitimists have been asked to join and have been offered\r\nthe presidency which would be given to the Duc de Noailles himself.\r\nThe question has been complicated by the Royalist party which also\r\nwished to act in the same direction but tactlessly began upon too\r\nsmall a scale.\r\n\r\nMy son, M. de Dino, informs me that a recent decree issued by the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, orders that there are to be no doors in the\r\nmiddle of the confessionals. This is said to be thought very\r\nridiculous. It is a somewhat humiliating precaution for the clergy and\r\nis also quite superfluous, for the sides of the confessional boxes are\r\nshut in so that the penitents and the confessors are always separated\r\nand when the middle is closed the confessor can listen to the\r\npenitents without distraction. Mgr. Affre can devise nothing that is\r\nnot ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Königsbruck, July 6, 1841._--I am grieved to hear the news which has\r\njust reached me of the death of the Queen of Hanover;[32] another\r\nfigure of my London life thus disappears.\r\n\r\n  [32] The Queen of Hanover was the Duchess of Cumberland, by birth\r\n  a Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She died on June 29, after\r\n  suffering for three months from a form of consumption.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra writes that the Princesse de Lieven is leading\r\nquite a pastoral life in her little house at Beauséjour, where she\r\nspends the day. She has a little garden which she waters with little\r\nwatering-pots which M. Guizot was seen to bring to her door in the Rue\r\nSaint-Florentin. He goes to dinner at Beauséjour every day. At the\r\nfuneral of M. Garnier-Pagès, the radical deputy, the crowd was so\r\ngreat that the procession extended from the Bastille to the door of\r\nSaint-Denis. The speeches delivered over the tomb were all full of\r\nrevolutionary and religious maxims in the style of _The Words of a\r\nBeliever_ by M. de Lamennais. The editor of the _Peuple_ wrote, \"We\r\noffer you our regrets, but these are not enough, we offer you also our\r\npromises!\" Such is my delightful news from Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hohlstein, July 11, 1841._--I left my nieces the day before yesterday\r\nafter dinner and arrived here yesterday morning.[33] I crossed the\r\nwhole of Lusatia which is a fine province. The weather had cleared up\r\nbut as soon as I arrived here the rain began furiously; it has rained\r\nall night and is now falling heavily, to the detriment of the fine\r\nview which I ought to have from my bedroom windows which look upon the\r\nSilesian mountains.\r\n\r\n  [33] Hohlstein was the estate of the Princess of Hohenzollern\r\n  Hechingen, by birth a Princess of Courlande.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hohlstein, July 13, 1841._--Yesterday I took advantage of several\r\nintermissions in the bad weather to visit the park, the kitchen garden\r\nand the surroundings. It is all pretty and well kept and sometimes\r\npicturesque. I have a letter from Madame d'Albuféra from which I\r\nextract the following: \"Madame de Flahaut is starting to-morrow with\r\nher daughters for Ems. She is deeply grieved concerning the talk\r\nabout her husband. Yesterday she was in tears at Beauséjour while\r\nvisiting Princesse de Lieven. It does not seem to be entirely settled\r\nwhether they will go to Vienna or not. There is a general idea that M.\r\nBresson will be appointed to Vienna and that the Marquis of Dalmatia\r\nwill take his place at Berlin. Turin and Madrid will then remain\r\nvacant. Madame de Flahaut told me that if either of them were offered\r\nto her husband, she would be inclined to refuse but that the decision\r\nwould lie with him. I know that his friends would advise him to\r\naccept. He is staying at Paris to see the end of the business and\r\nhides his agitation better than his wife; but he is plainly ill at\r\nease for several reasons. Naples is out of the question, as it is said\r\nthat the King will not have them there.\r\n\r\n\"Events in England increase the depression of Madame de Flahaut. The\r\ntriumph of the Tories appears certain and the overthrow of the Whigs\r\ninevitable. The Granvilles are at La Jonchère[34] awaiting the result.\r\nLord Granville cannot move and can only speak with difficulty, but his\r\nmental powers are unimpaired.\"\r\n\r\n  [34] La Jonchère was the property of M. Thiers at La Celle\r\n  Saint-Cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hohlstein, July 21, 1841._--The newspapers give official news of the\r\ndate when the plenipotentiaries of the five Courts signed the joint\r\nprotocol referring to the East.[35] I imagine that this will enable\r\nthe final rearrangement of the French diplomatic body to be made.\r\n\r\n  [35] This protocol, which concluded the Egyptian question, was\r\n  signed on July 13, 1841, by England, Austria, Prussia, Russia,\r\n  and Turkey. The Straits Convention, which was signed at the same\r\n  time, added the signature of the French plenipotentiary to the\r\n  rest.\r\n\r\nI have a long letter from M. de Chalais which speaks only of his\r\nprivate life and gives me no news except that the Princesse de Lieven\r\nhas written a long letter to the Duc de Noailles asking that she might\r\nbe allowed to appoint him her executor in her will, as she says that\r\nshe has an intuition that she will die at Paris. Meanwhile she seems\r\nto be excellently well.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard writes as follows in reference to the speech before\r\nthe Academy of M. de Sainte-Aulaire: \"I must say a word concerning the\r\nreception of Sainte-Aulaire; the newspapers flatter him; the audience\r\nwas very brilliant but the speech of the new member colourless and\r\ncold. M. Roger's speech was more successful than it deserved to be; so\r\nmuch the worse for the public.\" M. Royer-Collard also told me that\r\nafter paying a visit to Versailles with his daughter, he had another\r\nattack of the fever which nearly carried him off a few years ago at\r\nChâteauvieux. It is obvious that his system then received a shock from\r\nwhich it will never recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, July 27, 1841._--I left Hohlstein the day before\r\nyesterday in the morning and reached Sagan at two o'clock. After\r\ndinner I went to the castle to select certain family portraits of\r\nwhich I wish copies to be made for Rochecotte. I then went to the\r\nchurch to decide the place and the form of the little monument which\r\nis now to be erected in memory of my father. It is time that this was\r\ndone, as he has now been buried in the church for forty years, and\r\napart from tradition no one knows the place of his burial. Yesterday I\r\nwent at an early hour to the little church which is picturesquely\r\nsituated at the end of the park of Sagan, in the vault of which the\r\nremains of my late sister have been laid. Mass was said there at my\r\nrequest for the repose of her soul. The church was filled with\r\nbeautiful flowers and rare plants brought by the castle gardener; a\r\nconsiderable number of people were also present. I then set out for\r\nDeutsch-Wartenberg which belongs to me and came on here in the evening\r\nwith Herr von Wolff who is staying for two or three days, to meet Herr\r\nvon Gersdorf whom I expect. They have to settle between them the legal\r\nquestions which have arisen between my sons and my sister\r\nHohenzollern, concerning the allodial claims of the latter to the\r\ngreater part of Sagan.\r\n\r\nI found that some improvements had been made here; the garden is well\r\nkept and everything perfectly neat.\r\n\r\nI have several letters. Madame de Lieven writing under date July 15\r\ntells me that Queen Victoria is paying a round of visits to the Whig\r\nMinisters, a proceeding which is thought very inadvisable in the\r\npresent situation and that no one would be astonished if she began a\r\n_coup d'état_ rather than endure a Tory Ministry. It is also possible\r\nthat to avoid Sir Robert Peel she may summon Lord Liverpool, a measure\r\nnot likely to meet with success. It is said that the eldest son of\r\nLady Jersey is to marry the daughter of Sir Robert Peel; that Lady\r\nPalmerston is quite revolutionary in her sentiments and more furious\r\nthan any one because she is obliged to leave the Ministry. All these\r\nrumours are extremely vague.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Montmorency tells me of the marriage of Mlle.\r\nVandermarck, daughter of the stockbroker, with the Comte de Panis,\r\nowner of the fine château of Borelli near Marseilles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, July 31, 1841._--A letter from M. Bresson from Berlin\r\ntells me that he is expecting General de Rumigny to stay from the 15th\r\nto the 20th of August, as the King of Prussia has invited him to the\r\nmanœuvres in Silesia and at Berlin. He tells me that M. and Madame\r\nThiers are to arrive at Berlin at the same time. The Duc de Noailles\r\nwrites that Lady Clanricarde will spend the next winter at Paris and\r\nthat Lord Cowley's nomination in place of Lord Granville is expected.\r\nHe adds that the little Rachel has just arrived at Paris; that only\r\nMarshal Soult's triumph in England could be compared to hers; that he\r\nhad letters from her in London in which she showed the utmost delight\r\nover her success, though remarkable to relate, her head was not turned\r\nby it. I think that the Duc's head would be less steady under such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 1, 1841._--Madame de Perponcher tells me that\r\nthe King of Hanover is quite overwhelmed by the death of his wife,\r\nover whom he seems to have watched most admirably. For a long time he\r\nwas under a delusion concerning the state of her health and when the\r\ndoctors told him that there was no hope, he was completely crushed.\r\nHowever, as soon as he recovered his spirits he went to the Queen and\r\nspoke of her religious duties as well as a Catholic could have done.\r\nThe Queen heard the terrible news with the utmost firmness and\r\nreceived the communion with the King, her daughter, the Duchess of\r\nAnhalt and poor Prince George. The despair of the latter was\r\nheartrending; as he could not see his mother, he could not be\r\npersuaded that she was dead and insisted that he should be allowed to\r\ntouch her body. As soon as the father put the mother's cold hand in\r\nthat of her son, the poor blind man was overcome with a kind of\r\nmadness. He has since been sent to the seaside. These details are\r\ncruel and really most heartrending.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 6, 1841._--My sisters have been here since the\r\nfirst of the month and seem to enjoy themselves in spite of the\r\nterrible weather.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from M. Bresson who says: \"There is no\r\npositive news from Paris: M. de Flahaut has refused Turin and declines\r\nto commit himself concerning the offer of Madrid. He says that he\r\nmaintains the fact that Vienna was offered to him, which M. Guizot\r\nwill not admit. Whether it was offered or not, he is doing his utmost\r\nto secure it and Madame de Flahaut is watching from Ems for the\r\narrival of Prince and Princess Metternich at the Johannisberg. I\r\nremain in an attitude of expectation and am resolved only to leave\r\nBerlin for Vienna or London.\r\n\r\n\"Herr von Werther has resigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His\r\nplace will be taken by Count Maltzan, but who will replace him at\r\nVienna is not yet known. The King has given Werther the Order of the\r\nBlack Eagle and has made the title of baron hereditary in his family;\r\nhitherto it had been only a personal title. Arnim of Paris has been\r\nmade a count.\r\n\r\n\"The Toulouse disturbance is causing me more anxiety;[36] no other\r\ntown in France has followed this bad example. The July festival has\r\nbeen celebrated in an orderly manner. The whole of the loan will not\r\nbe required; the financial deficiencies are being repaired and we\r\nshall find that France has recovered her strength and reorganised her\r\nmilitary power. My ardent desire is that all this may make for peace.\"\r\n\r\n  [36] On July 9 and 10 the inhabitants of Toulouse were disturbed\r\n  by the question of the census. The agitation seemed to have died\r\n  away when a serious rising broke out upon the 12th. Large bodies\r\n  of people marched about the streets, and barricades were raised,\r\n  and the 13th was a very threatening day. The town was saved by\r\n  the wisdom of the temporary mayor, M. Arzac, who was able, by\r\n  means of tact, to restore tranquillity.\r\n\r\nSuch is the prose, or if you prefer it, the poetry of M. Bresson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 7, 1841._--I have a letter from M. Molé who\r\ncomplains of his health and refers to the disturbance at Toulouse and\r\nthe general condition of France with as much gloominess as M. Bresson\r\nshowed satisfaction in the letter which I quoted yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Montmorency writes saying that Mgr. Affre prohibited\r\nM. Genoude from preaching. The latter then went to learn the reason\r\nfor this prohibition: the Bishop replied that it was due to his\r\nanti-governmental opinions; M. Genoude angrily replied that if the\r\nBishop persisted in maintaining his prohibition, he would print the\r\nwhole of Mgr. Affre's writings of a few years ago, in opposition to\r\nthe July monarchy, the original signed documents being in his\r\npossession. The Archbishop thereupon relented and M. Genoude will\r\npreach. This is an attitude truly worthy of a bishop! The incident\r\nnaturally induces me to draw comparisons with the past and strengthens\r\nmy conviction that Mgr. de Quélen was the last real Archbishop of\r\nParis. The present age seems unable to produce any great or noble\r\nlives. There is a dead level of hopeless mediocrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 16, 1841._--As I write this date I cannot but\r\nremember with deep regret an anniversary which will always be dear and\r\nsacred to me; this is the day of Saint Hyacinthe, the patron saint of\r\nthe late Mgr. de Quélan. I am certain that mass is being said for him\r\nat the Sacré Cœur. For many years a shrub was taken to him from me on\r\nthis day. Two years ago, when he was still ill at Conflans, he called\r\nmy servant into his room, who then brought him an orange tree and\r\nasked Madame de Gramont to write a note saying that of all the flowers\r\nhe had received mine had given him the greatest pleasure. Now I can\r\ndo no more than pray to him in heaven. I often think that he is united\r\nwith Him to whom he has so often prayed himself, and that both\r\nintercede before God on my behalf, to gain me the blessing of a good\r\ndeath, and especially a Christian life, for rarely does the one come\r\nto pass without the other; and if God sometimes shows His mercy at a\r\nlate hour, we have no reason to be idle or to omit any effort to\r\ndeserve it. These true and heartfelt words I often repeat to myself,\r\nbut do not derive a full measure of comfort from them. The worldly\r\nspirit, the old enemy, is difficult to eradicate.\r\n\r\nAt Wartenberg I inspected the Protestant school. Last year I was\r\npresent at the examination of the Catholic children, and I can say,\r\nwithout prejudice, that the latter school is infinitely superior to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe post brought me a letter from the Court Marshal, giving me an\r\nofficial announcement from their Majesties of their proposal to pass\r\nhere on the 31st of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 18, 1841._--I have a letter from M. Bresson. He\r\nhad announced his visit to me long ago, and now asks me to transfer it\r\nto the 31st of this month, so that he may stay here on that day to see\r\nthe King and leave on the 1st. He tells me that when the King learnt\r\nof his proposal to come here, he told him at his last audience that he\r\nhoped he might meet him at my house; he also tells me that the\r\ndiplomatic nominations will not be made until the Tory Ministry comes\r\ninto office, which the Queen of England is unable to avoid.\r\n\r\nHe adds that M. and Madame Thiers are at Berlin and are arousing keen\r\ncuriosity; crowds gather as they pass. M. Thiers seems anxious not to\r\ngive his journey any political meaning and is showing great\r\ncircumspection. He has asked to see the King. M. Bresson was awaiting\r\nat the time when he wrote to me an answer to this request from Sans\r\nSouci.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 20, 1841._--Yesterday I took a long drive\r\nthrough my estates on the other side of the Oder. The weather was very\r\nfine and this morning is also quite clear. I trust it may be as fine\r\nfor the King's visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 21, 1841._--In Germany birthdays are even more\r\nimportant festivals than baptismal days,[37] so since yesterday,\r\ncompliments and bouquets have been coming in. All the Catholic priests\r\ncame yesterday to offer their good wishes and have promised to say\r\nmass for me this morning. Yesterday evening all the masters of the\r\nCatholic schools, of which there are twelve upon my estates, came\r\ntogether, though some of them live twelve leagues away, to sing to me\r\nin detachments with the best pupils of their schools; simple and\r\ntouching verses very well written and thought out, with no\r\ninstrumental accompaniment; it was very pretty and kind; any mark of\r\naffection is always deeply felt by me and I was therefore greatly\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\n  [37] The Duchesse de Talleyrand was born on August 21, 1793.\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 22, 1841._--Yesterday I had a numerous company\r\nto dinner and took them to the shooting competition arranged in the\r\npheasant preserves. All the gamekeepers, farmers and servants were\r\nthere. There was music in the copses, flowers everywhere and a\r\nbeautiful sunny day. I offered three prizes, a sporting rifle, a\r\nhunting knife, and a game bag. The two Prefects in whose department I\r\nhave property, came in after dinner and took tea. It was so fine that\r\nin spite of nightfall, the company did not separate until my bedtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 25, 1841._--Yesterday I had a letter from the\r\nPrincesse de Lieven, the chief news of which is as follows: \"It is\r\nsaid that the society of Vienna will receive M. Bresson very coldly.\r\nPrince Metternich has hinted as much here. He has no great liking for\r\nany of the competitors for this post, and less liking for Bresson than\r\nfor the others. Apponyi says so without constraint. I think that Lord\r\nCowley will take Lord Granville's place. Lady Palmerston is greatly\r\ndistressed at losing Downing Street:[38] Lord Palmerston puts a better\r\nface upon the matter; his address to the electors of Tiverton marks\r\nthe end of his career in French opinion. Much ill feeling on the\r\nmatter remains here and we part with him upon distinctly bad terms.\"\r\n\r\n  [38] Where the Foreign Office is situated.\r\n\r\nI propose to leave Silesia in a week from to-day and should like to\r\nsee my dear Touraine again on October 1. The local newspapers contain\r\nno news except that the King received M. Thiers, not at Sans Souci,\r\nbut at Berlin in a private audience which lasted twenty minutes. M.\r\nThiers wore his academician's dress and the orders of Belgium and\r\nSpain. Throughout his journey he has been the object of curiosity\r\nwhich was rather keen than kindly, and if he understood German he\r\nwould have heard more than one caustic remark.\r\n\r\nI have made arrangements with my gardener and an architect for the\r\ndecorations for the day when the King is to stay here. The decorations\r\nwill consist of numerous garlands, pyramids, festoons and arches of\r\ndahlias of every colour which will decorate the King's path from the\r\navenue to the house. There is nothing magnificent or imposing about\r\nthis place: there is no view, but it is fresh and green; the trees are\r\nbeautiful and the garden well kept. The house is large but not\r\nstriking, without architectural beauty and surmounted by a heavy ugly\r\nroof, so that only by means of flowers can any daintiness be given to\r\nthe whole. The hall is to be turned into an orangery and, in short,\r\nthe whole will appear in holiday though unpretentious dress, which\r\nwill at any rate show my good intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 30, 1841._--My niece, Hohenthal, arrived here\r\nyesterday. She told me that Madame Thiers had been so ill at Dresden\r\nthat she had been taken from her hotel to the doctor's house. M.\r\nThiers told some one who repeated it to my niece, that his audience\r\nwith the King of Prussia was short and cold and that the King talked\r\nof nothing but Art; his attitude seems to have been well advised.\r\nGeneral de Rumigny, on the contrary, is most kindly treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 31, 1841._--Yesterday after dinner I set out\r\nwith my nephew Biron and we went to Grünberg to await their Majesties\r\nat the house of the Queen's chief lady, who had gone in advance of\r\nher. A prodigious number of triumphal arches, deputations, addresses\r\nand cavalcades made their Majesties so late, that they did not reach\r\ntheir resting-place until half-past ten at night, though this hour\r\nwas very suitable for the illuminations and fireworks at our chief\r\ncentre. Many of the principal landowners in the district were there.\r\nThe King and Queen first received me alone and then the rest of the\r\ncompany was admitted. Their Majesties wished to keep me to supper, but\r\nas I still have a great deal to arrange here, I asked permission to\r\nwithdraw and reached home at half-past one in the morning. Fortunately\r\nit was a beautiful moonlight night.\r\n\r\nI found General de Rumigny at Grünberg. He is following the King to\r\nthe manœuvres and will arrive here this morning. The weather is\r\nmagnificent and I should like to kneel down and send up a prayer of\r\nthanks to the sun for his kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, September 1, 1841._--Yesterday passed off very well.\r\nTheir Majesties were in excellent spirits and most kind. The weather\r\nwas perfect, flowers were abundant and there was a good lunch suitably\r\nserved; the population in holiday attire came in large numbers and\r\nbehaved excellently. I drove after the King with my nephew to the\r\nfirst village where horses were changed. This village is on my estate\r\nand His Majesty was again greeted with a triumphal arch by my keepers\r\nand with country receptions of every kind. The King, who did not know\r\nthat I was following, as I had not told him, was quite surprised to\r\nsee me. He got down from his carriage and made me take his place as\r\nthe Queen wished to embrace me once more. In short they seem to have\r\nbeen quite satisfied, which is a great pleasure to me.\r\n\r\nGeneral de Rumigny started immediately after the King, M. Bresson\r\nafter dinner and the Birons after tea. My niece, Hohenthal, went away\r\nlast night and so I am here alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, September 2, 1841._--I have decided to start this\r\nevening and before I go I am designing a new addition to the garden,\r\nwhich will make it truly magnificent, and I have commissioned the\r\narchitect to replace the heavy rotten roof with gables and a flat\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, September 3, 1841._--I reached here after covering fifty-four\r\nFrench leagues in seventeen hours. In this country where one cannot\r\narrange for relays, this is excellent travelling.\r\n\r\nM. Bresson told me that no one could be more surly or disagreeable\r\nthan Madame Thiers: she has been ill, or pretended to be ill, and\r\ndeclared that she would die if she stayed any longer in Germany, which\r\nseemed to her like Siberia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, September 5, 1841._--Yesterday I went to the Werthers who are\r\nsoon to exchange their diplomatic post for one at Court. Werther\r\nhimself, like a good courtier, suggested this change at the proper\r\ntime and has thus spared himself possible mortification and obtained\r\nan excellent post. Frau von Werther and Josephine regret the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, September 6, 1841._--I am going to entrust myself to the\r\nrailway as far as Potsdam. At Potsdam I shall dress and dine with\r\nPrincess Charles of Prussia at Klein Glienicke at the gates of the\r\ntown. I shall then resume my journey and spend the night in my\r\ncarriage in order to reach Leipzig to-morrow morning. There I shall\r\nfind the Hohenthals who are bringing my niece Fanny Biron, whom I have\r\npromised to take with me to France. A winter in Saxony is thought to\r\nbe too much for her health, which is delicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leipzig, September 6, 1841._--I left my Berlin hotel yesterday\r\nmorning. I had chocolate with Madame de Perponcher and learnt from her\r\nthe sad news of the sudden death of my young and charming neighbour,\r\nPrincess Adelaide Carolath, who was married under the most dramatic\r\ncircumstances a year ago to her cousin and died in a few hours of an\r\nattack of suppressed measles. She was quite an ideal character and I\r\nhave been deeply affected by this sudden death.\r\n\r\nFrom Berlin to Potsdam I travelled with Baron von Arnim, master of the\r\nceremonies, who was also dining at Glienicke. The Princess drove me\r\nround the park in her pony-chaise. After dinner I went for a walk and\r\nthen said good-bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weimar, September 9, 1841._--We parted from the Hohenthals at Leipzig\r\nyesterday morning. The two sisters were much depressed at their\r\nseparation; however, the open air and the pretty country through which\r\nwe have been travelling enabled Fanny to recover her spirits.\r\n\r\nHere I found a letter from the Princess of Prussia who is staying at\r\nKreuznach on the Rhine and asks me to go and see her while I am at\r\nJohannisberg. I shall certainly do so, though it will prolong my\r\njourney by an additional day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frankfort-on-Main, September 11, 1841._--I arrived here this morning\r\nin fine weather. My niece proposes to spend a few days with her former\r\ngoverness at Bonn, to see her brother who is in garrison there and is\r\nnow ill. We shall meet again at Mayence on the 15th. I am starting for\r\nJohannisberg to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frankfort, September 12, 1841._--Yesterday at tea-time Count Maltzan\r\ncame in. He is taking the baths at Kreuznach and came over to see his\r\nniece Fanny. He is very pleased with his position as Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs. I doubt if he will suit the King of Prussia in the\r\nlong run, for he is vehement, irascible and impetuous, and though the\r\nKing is angelically good he is very quick tempered. However, it is no\r\nbusiness of mine. The Count is a kind and pleasant drawing-room\r\ntalker, and when he has got rid of his habit of gossiping, which he\r\ncontracted at Vienna, he will be a pleasant person, except for those\r\nwho have to transact business with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Johannisberg, September 13, 1841._--I arrived here yesterday at two\r\no'clock, the weather being extremely hot. I had known this place in\r\npast years and few changes have been made. There is an extensive and\r\nbeautiful view, though I prefer the view from Rochecotte, which is\r\nsimilar, because of the forest which crowns my house, and also because\r\nof the vegetation along the Loire and the hillsides opposite me, which\r\nmake the valley grander and more beautiful. Here the vines cover\r\neverything. The house is very large and the rooms spacious but\r\nsomewhat poorly furnished. I was most kindly received, not only by\r\nthe master and mistress of the house but by many other acquaintances:\r\nmy cousin, Paul Medem, who would as soon go back to Stuttgart as\r\nMinister as to Vienna to the post of Chargé d'Affaires; Tatitscheff,\r\nwho is almost entirely blind, and Neumann who is returning to London\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have no news; Prince Metternich says there is none. He is very\r\npleased to hear of the Whig downfall in England and very well disposed\r\nto M. Guizot; he is sorry that the Duc de Montebello is not to be sent\r\nto him at Vienna. He has very humble letters from M. de Flahaut, and\r\nbegins to think that a minister who writes confidential platitudes\r\nbeforehand should be easier to manage than any other. However, nothing\r\nis as yet officially known concerning the movements of the French\r\ndiplomatic body. Apponyi and his family are expected to-day on their\r\nway from Paris. They are to stay here before proceeding to Hungary on\r\nleave. Let us hope that they will bring some positive news concerning\r\nthe nomination of the French Ambassador to Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Johannisberg, September 14, 1841._--I have accomplished my excursion\r\nto Kreuznach, which occupied the whole of yesterday: I did not return\r\ntill half-past eight in the evening and was obliged to cross the Rhine\r\nin the darkness, which I did not find particularly pleasant, in spite\r\nof the beauty of the scene; the lights of the steamboats from the\r\nbanks reflected in the river, and the masses of the rocks increased by\r\nthe darkness of the night made an imposing scene which I only half\r\nenjoyed as I was somewhat afraid. At Kreuznach I spent several hours\r\nwith the Princess of Prussia who was as kind as ever. I was sorry to\r\nfind her considerably changed, uneasy concerning her health, and tired\r\nby taking the waters, from which so far she had experienced no other\r\nresult. I dined with her, and Count Maltzan was present.\r\n\r\nPrince Metternich yesterday received an official intimation that M. de\r\nFlahaut had been appointed to the Vienna embassy; he is not greatly\r\npleased at this news. The other changes in the French diplomatic body\r\nwere not then known.\r\n\r\nM. de Bourquency is very fashionable here; though the Prince does not\r\nknow him personally, he was full of praises of his behaviour at\r\nLondon; at the same time he added that a diplomatist, who was also a\r\ncontributor to the _Journal des Debáts_, was one of the curiosities of\r\nthe age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Johannisberg, September 15, 1841._--Yesterday I did not go out all\r\nday though the weather was beautiful. I was very glad to rest;\r\nmoreover, so much time is spent here in receiving a succession of\r\ncallers that country life properly so called is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mayence, September 16, 1841._--I left Johannisberg yesterday and was\r\nmuch touched by all the kindness of the master and mistress of the\r\nhouse, and very glad that I had been able to pay them a visit. I\r\narrived here in good time, and found Frau von Binzer, Paul Medem and\r\nBaron Zedlitz awaiting me. The baron, who is a well-known poet, has\r\nnow taken the place of Gentz with Prince Metternich on account of some\r\npolitical publication. While I was dining with these people, three\r\ncannon shots announced the steamboat by which the Princess of Prussia\r\nwas travelling up the Rhine on her way to Weimar through Mannheim. The\r\nboat stopped here for ten minutes, and as it put in some thirty yards\r\nfrom the hotel I went to spend these ten minutes on board with the\r\nPrincess; she was not expecting me, and showed the utmost satisfaction\r\nat this small attention.\r\n\r\nThe evening was warm and beautiful and we drove round the town, the\r\noutskirts of which are pretty, and went to see the statue of Gutenberg\r\nby Thorwaldsen, which is a handsome piece of work. On our return we\r\nheard that a courier from the Rothschilds had arrived from Paris,\r\nbringing the news of a small rising in Paris during which a pistol\r\nshot had been fired at the Duc d'Aumale, who, however, was not\r\nhit.[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] The revolutionary factions which were still seething,\r\n  pursued their plan of destroying the Royal Family. On September\r\n  4, 1841, a pistol-shot was fired at the Duc d'Aumale as he was\r\n  going down a street of the Faubourg Saint Antoine at the head of\r\n  his regiment, the 17th Light Horse. The horse of\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Levaillant, who was by the side of the Prince\r\n  was killed by the ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metz, September 18, 1841._--I arrived here yesterday evening in a\r\ntorrential downpour of rain, which makes travelling extremely\r\nunpleasant. At the hotel I found General d'Outremont, who was in\r\ncommand at Tours for a long time. He is at Metz for inspection and\r\nasked to see me. He told me that the disturbances at Clermont were\r\neven more serious than those at Toulouse, in fact the newspaper that\r\nsome one has lent me regards them as very serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 20, 1841._--I have now returned to the great\r\nBabylon. The good and excellent Barante was awaiting my arrival. He\r\nhas spent the evening here and given me the following news: the\r\ndisturbances in Clermont seem to have been of the most serious\r\ncharacter, a real Jacquerie and the most disquieting demonstration\r\nthat has taken place in France since 1830.[40] Barante who has been\r\nabsent for three and a half years, was astonished and horrified by the\r\ngeneral degradation, especially in political morality, which is\r\nobvious here. He wittily said that he had not yet come across a man in\r\nParis who had a good word for another. He proposes to spend six weeks\r\nat his house in Auvergne and will then stay here for the winter and\r\nnot return to St. Petersburg till the spring. Sainte-Aulaire started\r\nforty-eight hours ago for his new post in London. His wife will not\r\nfollow him until February and Madame de Flahaut will not go to Vienna\r\nuntil she has married her daughter, Emilie, for whom no suitor has yet\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n  [40] The census at Clermont-Ferrand, as at Toulouse, was a\r\n  pretext for disturbances which broke out on September 13, 1841,\r\n  and continued the whole of the next day. The rioters attacked the\r\n  armed force, and many soldiers were killed or wounded; the gates\r\n  of the town were burnt, and a desperate combat ensued. It became\r\n  necessary to send considerable military forces to the town to\r\n  overwhelm the rebels and restore order.\r\n\r\nBertin the elder is dead and Bertin de Veaux is suffering from a fresh\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 21, 1841._--Madame de Lieven routed me out yesterday\r\nat a very early hour. She came to ask questions and told me nothing:\r\nshe can repeat to all Europe what I have told her concerning the\r\ncorner of the world known to me; I persisted in speaking kindly of\r\nevery one, which vexed her, and eventually told her that people were\r\nthinking and saying everywhere that it was she who made and unmade\r\nambassadors, at which she was considerably embarrassed. Moreover, what\r\nI was saying was quite true; it is believed everywhere and I think\r\nwith reason. She asked me to dinner on Thursday at Beauséjour.\r\n\r\nHumboldt also called; I told him my Silesian news. Finally M. de\r\nSalvandy arrived, delighted to be ambassador at Madrid and prepared to\r\nreturn for the session of the Chamber of Deputies and to retain his\r\nvice-presidency. My son, Valençay, came to dinner with me and told me\r\nof the death of old Hottinger, which I am sorry to hear. He was a most\r\nhonourable man, deeply attached to the late M. de Talleyrand and a\r\nfriend of Labouchère. Many recollections of the past are disappearing\r\noutwardly with terrible rapidity.\r\n\r\nThere is some small continuous agitation in the distant quarters of\r\nParis; I do not understand the reason for it; it seems to be the\r\nnormal state of Paris. A return to the great outbursts of 1831 would\r\nbe to restore our youth but not our strength, at a time when we should\r\ngrow old in order to grow greater. Fortunately the troops are in\r\nexcellent spirits everywhere, but are also required everywhere. The\r\nauthorities are determined and even anxious to make vigorous use of\r\nthem. This is all very well and it is fortunate for them that they\r\nhave the power and have no foreign war upon their hands in addition to\r\nthese internal disorders.\r\n\r\nMy letters from Auvergne[41] are not satisfactory. Pauline shall\r\ncertainly spend her winter in the south at Rome, if I do not go to\r\nNice. She is so anxious to see me that I am deciding for Nice, where I\r\nshall go in the month of December and return in March. I hope the\r\nchange will also do my niece Fanny good. For me personally it is a\r\ngreat sacrifice. I should like a long rest and to shut myself up at\r\nRochecotte, but Pauline is really ill and warmly expresses a desire to\r\nsee me, and her husband joins in supporting her wish with such\r\npersistence that I cannot hesitate.\r\n\r\n  [41] The Marquis and Marquise de Castellane were now resident in\r\n  Auvergne at their estate of Aubijou.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 22, 1841._--Yesterday evening I went with my son\r\nValençay to Saint-Cloud, where I was able to see the whole Royal\r\nFamily together, including even their Belgian Majesties. All are\r\nstarting for Compiègne. The Queen had news of the Prince de Joinville\r\nfrom Newfoundland. He is proceeding to Halifax.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 23, 1841._--Yesterday I saw the Abbé Dupanloup who\r\ntold me that he had in his possession a series of letters which had\r\npassed between M. de Talleyrand and Cardinal Fesch, of the greatest\r\ninterest, and others which had passed between M. de Talleyrand and the\r\nChapter of Autun at the most difficult and troublesome time: he is the\r\nbetter pleased by these discoveries as they confirm his opinion of M.\r\nde Talleyrand and in general do him great credit.\r\n\r\nYesterday I went to dinner at Beauséjour with Madame de Lieven and\r\ntook Barante who was invited. The other guests were the Duc de\r\nNoailles, M. Guizot and Mr. Bulwer. The conversation was animated and\r\nvaried, while Barante talked much more naturally and agreeably than\r\nany one. Of news I heard none.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 26, 1841._--Yesterday I went to Champlâtreux with\r\nBaron Humboldt. The weather was very unpleasant and spoilt our\r\nexcursion. I had known Champlâtreux long before: time has in no way\r\ndestroyed its beauty; on the contrary, for M. Molé has laid it out\r\nmagnificently. His improvements are excellent but should be continued\r\nand especially the little panes of glass should be removed from the\r\nwindows in the large rooms, as they spoil the general effect. On the\r\nwhole it is a noble mansion, not a feudal, but a parliamentary\r\nbuilding, as befits a descendant of Mathieu Molé, of whom memorials\r\nare everywhere to be found and very properly so. Particularly\r\nexcellent is the portrait of the grandmother, the daughter of Samuel\r\nBernard, in the large room; with her dowry M. Molé's grandfather built\r\nthe present residence. The park is beautiful and finely laid out,\r\nwhile M. and Madame Molé are most kind and pleasant hosts.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications are in their most advanced state from Paris to\r\nSaint-Denis, but for the moment the state of affairs is simply\r\nfrightful and looks like chaos.\r\n\r\nYesterday's event, for every day brings an event in this country, was\r\nthe truly scandalous acquittal of the _National_;[42] it must be\r\nadmitted that we cut a very poor figure here.\r\n\r\n  [42] The _National_ had published a correspondence concerning the\r\n  disturbances at Clermont, full of falsehoods and invectives\r\n  against the monarchy, and was accused of attacking the King's\r\n  majesty and brought to trial. On September 24, 1841, a verdict of\r\n  \"Not Guilty\" was passed by the jury of the Seine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 1, 1841._--Yesterday I saw M. Guizot at my house. I\r\nwas anxious to say a word to him on behalf of Charles de Talleyrand\r\nwho, I hope, will soon join M. de Sainte-Aulaire at London. M. Guizot\r\ntold me that Lord Cowley would certainly be the ambassador at Paris\r\nand his appointment is desired here. Sir Robert Peel refused court\r\nappointments to Lord Wilton and the Duke of Beaufort, saying that\r\npeople with more depth of character and less doubtful morality were\r\nrequired about the person of a young Queen. The Duke of Beaufort has\r\nrefused the embassy of St. Petersburg, and the Marquis of Londonderry\r\nthe embassy of Vienna. Both wished for Paris and were greatly\r\nexasperated by their failure to secure it. They are now forming the\r\nnucleus of a small opposition party.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot gives the following explanation of the two somewhat unusual\r\nnominations of M. de Flahaut as ambassador to Vienna and of M. de\r\nSalvandy to Madrid: he says that he thought it advisable to deprive M.\r\nThiers of the one and M. Molé of the other. An admirable explanation\r\nand of course entirely in the interests of the country!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Courtalin, October 3, 1841._--I arrived here yesterday evening after\r\ndining and sleeping with Madame Mollien. I am now in the midst of the\r\nMontmorency family, many of whom are here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 7, 1841._--Once more I am back at my little\r\nPalazzo where I arrived in the morning to my great delight and have\r\nbeen most interested to see the arrangements and improvements that\r\nhave taken place during my absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 12, 1841._--I have spent the last few days in\r\narranging my new library and putting the books in order. It is\r\na tiring business but has absorbed me greatly. My son and\r\ndaughter-in-law Dino have arrived and also my niece Fanny and her\r\ngoverness, who spent a few days at Paris after my departure.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a call from the Lady Superior of the Daughters of the\r\nCross from Chinon. She is the one who received the communion last\r\nspring when I went to see her. She asserts that she began to get\r\nbetter from the moment of my visit. She brought me some rosaries and\r\nwished to pray in my chapel. She also brought me my lithographed\r\nportrait from a room where she found it and persuaded me without much\r\ntrouble to add an orphan's place to the establishment which she\r\nadministers. I have thus secured the right of sending an orphan from\r\nthe village of Saint Patrice of which Rochecotte is a part, to receive\r\na Christian education from these excellent women, and I shall make my\r\nchoice to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 14, 1841._--The changed situation in Spain has\r\noccupied all minds at Paris, for war has really broken out again. It\r\nis a dreadful business and will end in the massacre of the innocent\r\nIsabella.[43] Queen Christina is by no means anxious to leave Paris,\r\nwhere she finds life pleasant. She is terrified by the idea of\r\nreturning to Spain of which she speaks with disgust and scorn. All who\r\nknow her regard her as clever, kind and courageous in time of need,\r\nbut naturally idle, pleasure-loving and devoting herself to amusement\r\nas far as she can, as she is obliged to despair of ever playing a part\r\nin politics again. She is very fond of her children by Muñoz and she\r\nhas little affection for her royal daughters.\r\n\r\n  [43] On October 7, 1841, at eight o'clock in the evening,\r\n  Generals Leon and Concho took advantage of the fact that a\r\n  regiment, formerly commanded by the latter, had arrived at\r\n  Madrid. As the regiment was devoted to him the two Generals\r\n  proposed to make a sudden attempt to carry off the Queen and the\r\n  Infanta. They went to the palace at the head of a squadron of the\r\n  Royal Guard, and while the regiment surrounded the palace they\r\n  mounted to the Queen's apartments; these were fortunately guarded\r\n  by halberdiers who offered a vigorous resistance, received them\r\n  with rifle-shots, and drove them back several times. Espartero\r\n  crushed this military plot, and had General Diego Leon shot on\r\n  October 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 24, 1841._--Yesterday I had some letters\r\ncontaining news. Madame de Lieven writes: \"England is obviously\r\ndisturbed about the news from America and speculators in every country\r\nare greatly alarmed. It is difficult to think that war will not be the\r\nconsequence of the complication in the case of Grogau[44] added to\r\nthat of MacLoed. The newspapers are full of Spain; attempts at\r\ninsurrection are everywhere a failure. Espartero does his duty in\r\npunishing the guilty, but it is piteous to see the most cultured and\r\nbrilliant figures in Spain falling. The death of Diego Leon, the idol\r\nof the army and of Madrid, made Queen Christina shed floods of tears.\r\nI do not know how she will escape the consequence of Olozaga's\r\npublications; she disavows them but no one believes her. Demands are\r\nissued that France should send Christina back; the government\r\nnaturally refuses and will continue to offer hospitality to the niece\r\nof the French Queen. I do not think that Salvandy will start\r\nimmediately for his post in Madrid: Sainte-Aulaire has secured the\r\nfavour of Aberdeen; Flahaut is starting for Vienna shortly.\"\r\n\r\n  [44] On September 20, 1841, Colonel James W. Grogau, a citizen of\r\n  the United States, was surprised during the night in the house of\r\n  a certain Mr. Brown within the frontiers of his own country, by\r\n  brigands in English uniform, who carried him away as a prisoner\r\n  to Montreal in Canada. Mr. Richard Jackson, the Governor of\r\n  Canada, immediately liberated him, and punished an English\r\n  officer, Mr. Jackson, of Colonel Dyer's regiment, who had taken\r\n  part in this attempt.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra tells me that the Duchesse de Nemours is with\r\nchild, to the great delight of the Queen and that the household at\r\nCompiègne which has been so long disturbed seems to be in perfect\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 25, 1841._--Yesterday I had a letter from M. de\r\nSalvandy, of which the following is an extract; \"It is not impossible\r\nthat I may receive orders to start within the next twelve days. You\r\nwill have seen what has happened at Madrid: the insurrection with its\r\nsudden outbreak and its sudden ending. We have undergone all kinds of\r\ndeceptions here and have proclaimed them and published them in our\r\npublic and private deeds, in our relations with the Spanish\r\nGovernment, with its Minister and with every one. The Minister has\r\ndemanded that Queen Christina should be sent back and has been justly\r\nand vigorously refused, but so vigorously that what the Madrid\r\nauthorities will say or do no one can conjecture. Hitherto relations\r\nhave not been entirely broken off; nothing will be known for another\r\nten days. At present we are much disconcerted by our foolish actions\r\nand are trying to avoid the consequences as gently as possible. At the\r\nfirst favourable moment my departure will be urged. In this\r\nundignified position mine is the only bearable situation, because I\r\nhave shared none of these delusions; I have contradicted them, as\r\nevery one knows and Spain is thankful to me. Spain asks that I should\r\nstart. I have pointed out two or three matters upon which I should\r\nlike satisfaction; they will be granted and we shall thus be able to\r\nput a better face upon the matter, but I am astounded at this method\r\nof conducting the business of the world.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Salvandy tells me that he will come here on his way to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 6, 1841._--I hear that the Russian Ambassador at\r\nParis has just received orders from his Sovereign to start for St.\r\nPetersburg in a week. Every one is attempting to conjecture the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 11, 1841._--The Duchesse d'Albuféra writes to\r\nsay that the real reason for the sudden recall of the Russian\r\nAmbassador, Count Pahlen, by the Emperor Nicholas in the midst of\r\nwinter, is to secure that he shall not be the spokesman of the\r\ndiplomatic body before the King on New Year's Day when congratulations\r\nare offered. It is even said that, in order that the Russian\r\nAmbassador may be the youngest ambassador at Paris, Pahlen's place\r\nwill be taken by M. de Bouténieff, but this is only a rumour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 16, 1841._--Yesterday when we were about to sit\r\ndown to dinner I saw M. de Salvandy arriving. I thought that he was on\r\nhis way to Madrid. Nothing of the kind. Exhausted by the continual\r\nquestions concerning his reasons for delay and the time of departure,\r\nhe resolved to pay a round of visits in the country to avoid\r\ninquisitive people: he then came from Pontchartrain and is going on\r\nfrom here to Madame Maillé and to others of his friends. He says that\r\nthe session of the Chambers at Paris will be stormy and that the\r\nministerial rivalry of MM. Dufaure and Passy will cause difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 18, 1841._--M. de Salvandy went away yesterday\r\nafter lunch. The evening before he had had dreadful news from Spain\r\nwhere anarchist massacres are proceeding; Espartero seems to be at\r\nlast anxious for the presence of the French Ambassador and M. de\r\nSalvandy assumes that he will soon be crossing the Pyrenees. Before he\r\nwent away he related a somewhat amusing incident; a few days ago he\r\nmet the Demidoffs at the house of the Duchesse Decazes; there were\r\nonly three or four persons in the room and the conversation was almost\r\ngeneral. They were speaking of a story which is now going round Paris,\r\nto the effect that Mlle. Rachel had sold herself to M. Véron for two\r\nhundred thousand francs; whereupon M. Demidoff, in a manner impossible\r\nto imitate cried, \"See the power of money!\" Those present, after an\r\ninvoluntary glance at Madame Demidoff, preserved a solemn silence,\r\nwhich was fortunately interrupted in a moment by another caller.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from Madame de Lieven. She says that the\r\nQueen of England was disappointed that she had not been confined of\r\ntwins; she was hoping that the Prince of Wales would be accompanied by\r\na Duke of York.[45] England has presented a Note requesting an\r\nexplanation of the concentration of French troops near the Pyrenees,\r\nand announcing that she would not permit France to carry war into\r\nSpain. She has thus stopped a strongly marked inclination to support\r\nthe friends of Queen Christina with cannon shot; and this Queen is in\r\ngreat despair that people should wish to use her as a pretext.\r\nSpeaking of herself, she says that her chance is over and that no one\r\nshould think of her as a possibility; that she would never return to\r\nSpain or she would certainly meet the fate of Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n  [45] King Edward VII. was born on November 9.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening in the drawing-room we read a eulogy upon Madame de\r\nRumford, written by M. Guizot, who had sent it to me. I thought it\r\nrather dry and the sentences too long; in short it wants grace, though\r\nnot thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 27, 1841._--I have had letters from my\r\nson-in-law from Carrara, dated the 17th. To-morrow they were to have\r\nreached Florence, but they encountered a storm for eighteen hours in\r\nthe Gulf of Spezzia: the ship was damaged and they were in some\r\ndanger. At length they fortunately came into harbour and are now in a\r\npony trap, for it was impossible to disembark their carriage. He gives\r\na dreadful account of their journey. Poor Pauline was exhausted and\r\nentirely worn out; she had a presentiment that the crossing would be a\r\nbad one, for she wrote to me from Genoa saying that she was very\r\nreluctant to take this route.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 28, 1841._--I have a letter from Pauline from\r\nLucca which adds some serious details to those related by her husband.\r\nThey nearly foundered and were themselves obliged to gain the coast in\r\na small boat. My son-in-law was almost drowned; in short, it was a\r\nregular disaster. I long to hear that my dear Pauline is resting for a\r\nfew weeks at Florence. During the terrible time that they spent at sea\r\ntwo ships were lost and all on board perished, off Livorno.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 2, 1841._--Yesterday I concluded my round of\r\nfarewell visits in weather which really gave these attentions some\r\nvalue. After dinner M. de Salvandy came in; this time he was\r\ndefinitely on his way to Madrid and is starting this morning.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had letters from Pauline written at Florence and dated the\r\n22nd. She is living on the kindness of friends, as she has not yet\r\nrecovered either her trunks or her carriage. She reached the town like\r\na heroine in a novel, with her jewel box under her arm and not a\r\nsingle garment in her possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 3, 1841._--Yesterday morning a huge flash of\r\nlightning and a clap of thunder followed by a waterspout bursting over\r\nRochecotte, made us rush hurriedly out of our rooms; there were two\r\ninches of water in the dining-room and four in the kitchen. Madame de\r\nPodenas arrived shortly afterwards with her son from the house of her\r\nmother, the Duchesse des Cars, who has a country house on the other\r\nside of Tours. I had known Madame de Podenas very well in times past\r\nand am always glad to see her again. I had even intended, as I thought\r\nshe was in Italy, to make a journey from Nice to Genoa to see her, as\r\nshe has been settled for the last few years in a villa near that town.\r\nThe villa which she has bought is called Il Paradiso and was built by\r\nMichael Angelo. She is greatly changed but is as cheerful and pleasant\r\nas ever. She boldly resumed her journey in the course of the evening.\r\nM. de Salvandy started yesterday morning for Madrid; Alava, who was\r\nhere, went to Tours, Vestier to Chinon, and my son to Valençay, so\r\nthat Fanny and myself will be alone until we shortly start for Nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 5, 1841._--Yesterday my time was entirely\r\ndevoted to preparations for departure. My niece's health does not\r\nimprove, I am not very well myself, and the weather is frightful.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a very kind and obliging letter from the Duc\r\nd'Orléans; he writes to bid me farewell before my departure, and to\r\noffer me his congratulations on the escape of the Castellanes from the\r\ndangers of the sea; he had heard of their adventures from the Duchesse\r\nd'Albuféra. He seems very uneasy at the general state of public\r\nopinion, and by no means satisfied with the policy of the authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saint-Aignan, December 7, 1841._--I left my pleasant little\r\nRochecotte yesterday morning to resume the monotonous life of\r\nhigh-road travel, which is the more unpleasant in consequence of the\r\ndreadful weather. We lunched at Tours with the Prefect, Alava and\r\nVestier. As we passed by Chenonceaux I paid a half-hour's call, which\r\nI had been owing for years, upon Madame de Villeneuve. We then\r\ncontinued our journey here in a furious downpour of rain. When the\r\nroad leaves the department of Indre-et-Loire and enters that of\r\nLoir-et-Cher it deteriorates; moreover the rain and the inundations\r\nfrom the Cher have spoilt the road, and we travelled through a kind of\r\nlake. I will not conceal the fact that I screamed several times. We\r\nwere very kindly received by M. de Chalais, his brother and the Baron\r\nand Baronne de Montmorency: these are the only inhabitants of the\r\nresidence apart from the architect who is working at it; a\r\nconsiderable amount of building is in progress, which is solid and\r\neven rich as far as construction goes, but unfortunately in a style\r\nwhich does not seem to me sufficiently akin to that of the original\r\nbuilding; for instance, there is a heavy Saxon tower by the side of\r\nthe pointed turrets of Louis XI. The castle is very cold: the\r\nhot-water pipes, the double windows, the hangings, the door curtains\r\nand the draperies at Rochecotte make any other home impossible to me,\r\nand everywhere else I am frozen.\r\n\r\nYesterday at Chenonceaux I saw a very pretty portrait of Queen Louise\r\nde Vaudémont and a large coloured window of modern construction which\r\nthe King had just sent to the Villeneuves. The Duc de Montpensier came\r\nover to Chenonceaux from Amboise this summer and to his influence this\r\nattention is due. It is enough to show that the young Prince did not\r\nenter the bedroom of Madame de Villeneuve as I did, where the portrait\r\nof the Duc de Bordeaux, presented by Berryer, is hanging at her\r\nbedside, so that the mistress of the house can see it morning and\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, December 8, 1841._--I arrived here yesterday evening. I am\r\ngoing to hear mass with the Sisters at the tomb of our dear M. de\r\nTalleyrand. To-morrow morning we are to start again and to dine and\r\nsleep with Madame d'Arenberg at Menetou-Salon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Menetou-Salon, December 10, 1841._--The Prince and Princesse\r\nd'Arenberg were so kind as to keep us a day longer, the weather being\r\nabominable. Fanny and my son Valençay, who joined us here yesterday,\r\nso strongly urged this additional delay, that I have resolved to\r\nremain here the whole of to-day. Yesterday it was impossible to go\r\nout of the house. We barely had the energy to go round the château\r\nwhich M. d'Arenberg has restored from a state of ruin to a vast and\r\nnoble mansion. It has the characteristics of the hunting châteaux that\r\nI prefer, severe in style, simple and convenient, and placed in the\r\nmiddle of very fine forests. I much prefer Menetou to Arlay, their\r\nchâteau in the Franche-Comté. My cousin's three children are well\r\nbrought up, pleasant and cheerful. The whole of the household is very\r\nhappy and everything is done upon a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements at the end of the house are not yet complete, but\r\nwith handsome forests, plenty of space and money, all can easily be\r\nfinished and of these three conditions the d'Arenbergs can avail\r\nthemselves. The only point at Menetou that I can criticise is the\r\nhorrible red, white and orange paint with which the outer walls are\r\ndaubed. M. d'Arenberg says that it is in Flemish style, but I think it\r\nis hideous. The kennel is a perfect little jewel. Sporting influences\r\nare everywhere predominant and everything is done to the blast of\r\nhorns and the barking of dogs; the children know the different blasts\r\nby heart and can instantly distinguish the blast which means the\r\nquarry is sighted from that which proclaims that it has broken cover\r\nand the blasts which denote an old or a young boar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lyons, December 14, 1841._--The day before yesterday, which was\r\nSunday, we were escorted after mass by my son Valençay and M.\r\nd'Arenberg, to Bourges, where I visited the curious house of Cujas and\r\nthe very interesting one of Jacques Coeur; then we saw the normal\r\nschool which was formerly the house of Jacques Coeur's brother; after\r\nthat we saw the old palace of Charles VII. which has now become a\r\nconvent for the Blue Sisters and went to the cathedral. The funeral\r\noration was being given for M. de Villèle, the last Archbishop of\r\nBourges. Don Carlos,[46] his wife and his children were duly present\r\nat this honour paid to the prelate whose charity and whose care had\r\nalleviated their sad captivity. Don Carlos is less ugly and\r\ninsignificant than I thought: his wife was so hidden by her hat that I\r\ncould not make out her face; the hat and the shawl were those of a\r\nwoman of poverty, which I was sorry to see. I passed by the sad little\r\nhouse which has been assigned to them and which was surrounded by\r\nsoldiers on guard and policemen.\r\n\r\n  [46] After long struggles between the Carlists and the\r\n  Christinos, which caused much bloodshed throughout the Peninsula\r\n  until 1839, Don Carlos at this date was obliged to take refuge in\r\n  France. He was ordered to reside at the town of Bourges, where he\r\n  was kept under strict supervision, and not until 1847 did he\r\n  obtain permission to leave for Austria.\r\n\r\nIn order to change horses at Bourges infinite formalities are\r\nnecessary, an authorisation from the Prefect and visas, which are\r\ninvariably troublesome. After surviving these vexations, we had lunch\r\nand parted from M. de Valençay and M. d'Arenberg. We hoped to reach\r\nMoulins the same day but the weather became so frightful that we took\r\nrefuge in a horrible little inn where the smoke was blinding. At\r\ndaybreak yesterday we started off again and reached Lyons to-day at\r\nmidday. Lyons impressed me as always, and it is the fifth time I have\r\nseen it, by its original and picturesque position; but I found it\r\nsadly changed, since I was here, fifteen years ago, in consequence of\r\nthe enormous quantity of steam engines which have come into use, as\r\nthe coal which they burn has blackened all the buildings. The fog\r\ncommon at this time of year is as black as that of London and from the\r\ngeneral colour and the smell I could almost have thought myself in\r\nEngland. Lyons has greatly deteriorated in consequence and even the\r\npretty square of Bellecour seems to me no longer to justify its\r\nreputation, since it has been coloured dark grey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aix-en-Provence, December 17, 1841._--Fortunately I have no accident\r\nto relate and unfortunately no interesting descriptions to give. The\r\nsky even of Provence is by no means beautiful at this moment; the\r\nground as usual is dry and bare, the olives are wretched little trees,\r\nwhile we have not yet entered the zone of orange-trees. When I first\r\nvisited the south my ideas of the country were very illusory and every\r\nlater visit has confirmed me in the conviction that apart from the\r\nview over the Mediterranean when one has reached it and the colour of\r\nthe sky when it happens not to be clouded as it now is, there is\r\nnothing beautiful to be expected from this district. We spent some\r\ntime in visiting Avignon. I had known it long ago, but Fanny was\r\ncurious and we had lunch there this morning. We explored the old\r\ncastle of the popes which is now a barracks and the church of La\r\nMiséricorde.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 20, 1841._--We have now reached the end of our journey\r\nwhich has lasted a whole fortnight. We left Aix the day before\r\nyesterday, after my niece had satisfied her archæological curiosity\r\nand started in sunshine which would have been delightful had it not\r\nbeen accompanied by the mistral. At nine o'clock in the evening we\r\nreached Brignoles, but were horrified by the dreadful filth of the inn\r\nand resolved to continue our journey. When we had fairly entered the\r\nmountains of the Esterel, which involve an ascent of four hours and a\r\ndescent of three, the cold became cruel. At dawn the summits of the\r\nmountains showed themselves covered with snow. At the highest point,\r\nwhere the post house is situated, twenty mountaineers of wild\r\nappearance, all armed with guns were starting in pursuit of the wild\r\nboars and wolves which inhabit this rough district. This band of\r\nmountaineer hunters were accompanied by some policemen and customs'\r\nhouse officers and were firing trial shots which made the rocks\r\nre-echo; they formed a picture worthy of a painter, but we had no\r\nthoughts of the picturesque, so intense did the cold of the night\r\nseem. When we reached the valley the temperature suddenly changed; the\r\nsun was warm, the sea blue, the olive-trees tall and covered with\r\nfruit, the orange-trees laden with their golden balls and the hedges\r\nof rose-trees in flower. The town of Cannes overlooked by its old\r\ncastle, stood out delightfully as a background to the landscape upon\r\nthe rough mountains which we had just left; the island of St. Margaret\r\nfloated peacefully upon an azure sea and was an excellent completion\r\nto a view which we badly needed to thaw our minds and recover our\r\ntaste for the south, which we were much inclined to abuse. Before\r\nentering Cannes we saw on the right hand the villa Taylor and on the\r\nleft the villa Brougham; these looked like country houses belonging to\r\nretired stockbrokers. Lord Brougham's villa is shut off from the road\r\nby a great iron railing, each point of which is surmounted by a large\r\ngilded fleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\nFrom Cannes we had only nine leagues to cover to reach Nice and as it\r\nwas only nine o'clock in the morning, we hoped we might be able to\r\ndine here yesterday, but misfortune came upon us. When we reached\r\nAntibes, the last station before Nice, at midday, there were no horses\r\nto be had and we were emphatically told none would be forthcoming\r\nbefore four o'clock, after which hour there is no driving to Nice\r\nbecause the bridge of the Var is broken down and the passage is\r\nimpossible after nightfall. We were therefore obliged to remain at\r\nAntibes and sleep there; but where to sleep was a question. The inns\r\nin this town are indescribable and travellers never stop there; there\r\nare muleteer public-houses of the most disgusting appearance. A meal\r\nwas served to us which revolted us so far that we ate nothing but dry\r\nbread, and instead of sleeping in beds which, after the previous\r\nnight, would have been very pleasant, we returned to our carriages.\r\nShut up in these boxes and bestowed in a stable which was half a barn,\r\nwe watched for dawn which came very late. Cats were mewing all round\r\nus[47] and then a storm burst with as much fury as though we were in\r\nthe midst of summer; thunder, lightning and rain threatened our\r\nmiserable shelter. At last, at seven o'clock in the morning we were\r\ndelivered from our prison and started to Saint Laurent du Var. There\r\nwe were obliged to leave our carriage and embark in a little boat\r\nwhich brought us after much tossing to the Sardinian customs house,\r\nwhere two carbineers allowed us to warm ourselves at their fire. Our\r\ncarriage went three-quarters of a league up stream and passed the\r\nriver by a ford which was almost impracticable and very dangerous.\r\nMeanwhile we soaked a little dry bread in the very sour wine of the\r\ncountry and opposed our umbrellas to the gusts of wind and rain. At\r\nlength we reached Nice at one o'clock, amid driving rain and by a\r\nfurious sea. The hurricane continues and the waves are loudly roaring\r\nand rising so high that they almost reach the summit of the terrace on\r\nwhich stands the house where Fanny and myself occupy the second floor.\r\nOur windows look directly on the sea and before us to the right and to\r\nthe left there is nothing else. On sunny days the reflection will be\r\nfrightful and in times of rain a vast grey sheet is confused with the\r\nsky and forms the saddest possible outlook; the roar of the waves is\r\nalso most dismal. We have an enormous room and though it has a\r\nfireplace, it is very cold. My room is small and might be warm but the\r\nchimney smokes; everything is very dirty, as the old houses in Nice\r\ngenerally are. I cannot describe the general impression of sadness and\r\ndesolation which comes over us. The better side of the situation which\r\nconsoles us for all the rest is to see Pauline, who is neither better\r\nnor worse than when I left her seven months ago, as she is still\r\nsuffering from her throat; she is thin and looks feverish, but her\r\nillness has not been aggravated. She and her family are at one end of\r\nthe quarter which is known here as _La Terrasse_, while I am at the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n  [47] The Duchesse de Talleyrand had an innate and instinctive\r\n  fear of cats which she was never able to conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 22, 1841._--Yesterday I called upon the Grand Duchess\r\nStephanie between lunch and dinner; she is spending the winter here\r\nwith her daughter. She took me for a drive in her carriage upon the\r\njetty in weather which reminded me of the Chain Pier at Brighton. The\r\nGrand Duchess has excellent rooms at some distance from the sea in the\r\nmidst of a charming garden, with a beautiful view of the mountains;\r\nthe house is well furnished, cheerful and clean, exactly the contrary\r\nto mine and very little more expensive. The Grand Duchess is\r\ninfinitely better since she took the waters of Wildbad, but her\r\nrestlessness and the fidgety and flighty nature of her conversation\r\nwhich her disease had checked have reappeared with an emphasis really\r\nannoying.\r\n\r\nI had no letters from Paris yesterday: a rise in the river has carried\r\naway the boats and made the ford impassable, so that was impossible to\r\npass the Var two hours after the time when we crossed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 24, 1841._--Yesterday I met a large number of\r\nacquaintances at the house of the Grand Duchess, but few worth\r\nmentioning apart from the de Maistre family. She puts on her cards,\r\n_la comtesse Azelia de Maistre, née de Sieyès_. The two names look\r\nstrange side by side; however, she seems a very pleasant person, while\r\nhe has the wit of that particular kind which his name implies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 25, 1841._--Yesterday after lunch I took my niece and\r\nthe Castellanes to Saint Charles, in the most beautiful weather. The\r\nsun was almost too warm and the short walk threw one into a\r\nperspiration; the sky was magnificent and the view beautiful, and the\r\nsmell of the roses, the violets and the orange flowers intoxicating.\r\nOn returning to the town I left a few cards, and went home to rest,\r\nfor the burning sun and the keen sea air were most fatiguing.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange custom here. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and\r\nthroughout the intervening night, cannons are fired every half-hour;\r\nbands of sailors and country people go about the streets singing and\r\nhowling and making the most horrible din; for twenty-four hours this\r\nuproar has never ceased for a moment and I should think no one has had\r\na wink of sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 27, 1841._--I can remember the time when we went to\r\nMannheim to pay our respects to the Grand Duchess Stephanie on Saint\r\nStephen's Day. The same day here is being kept as a festival. At ten\r\no'clock she went to hear mass at the College of the Jesuits: the\r\nFather Rector, who is kind and polite, had invited a dozen people who\r\nwere intimate with the Grand Duchess, and my daughter and myself were\r\nincluded. The choral mass was very well given and we were then allowed\r\nto follow the Grand Duchess round the whole of the establishment, an\r\nexceptional privilege, and the ladies saw everything, even the cells\r\nof the Fathers. In each class one of the pupils made a little speech,\r\nsimple and suitable to the occasion. We then found coffee, chocolate\r\nand sherbet with cakes and sweets in the rector's parlour. There he\r\noffered the Grand Duchess a reliquary containing a relic of Saint\r\nEtienne. As she professes a great admiration for Silvio Pellico, he\r\nadded a copy of this writer's poetry, nicely bound with an autograph\r\nletter by Pellico. The Father Rector was the support and consoler of\r\nPellico's mother while he was in prison, and afterwards strongly\r\ninfluenced him to lead a Christian life. He is now said to be living\r\nin unusual sanctity. This little attention which was most tastefully\r\noffered was entirely successful. Before leaving the college we went\r\ninto the physical laboratory where we were shown some electrical\r\nexperiments. When we went away all the Fathers and pupils drew up in\r\nline and the youngest offered the Grand Duchess a bouquet of the kind\r\nonly procurable in this country where flowers are abundant and where\r\ntheir colour and perfume are incomparable. The whole morning's visit\r\nwas admirably arranged; there was no pedantry, nothing was too long,\r\nthe tactfulness and common sense of the Jesuits were quite obvious.\r\nThe pupils looked very healthy and were polite and well mannered.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we went with Fanny and the Castellanes to the Grand\r\nDuchess. Princesse Marie had invited some fifty persons to take part\r\nin a game of proverbs given in rhyme, which had been specially\r\narranged by several Russian and Italian society people and proved\r\nquite successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 29, 1841._--Yesterday I called upon several people,\r\nincluding the Comtesse Louis de Narbonne, the widow of the friend of\r\nM. de Talleyrand and mother of Madame de Rambuteau. She is pleasant\r\nand cheerful, but it is obvious that she has lived a great deal in the\r\nprovinces and very little with her husband. By birth she is Mlle. de\r\nMontholon, cousin of the first husband of Madame de Sémonville.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 30, 1841._--Yesterday was Pauline's twenty-first\r\nbirthday and to celebrate the double anniversary of her birth and her\r\nmajority, she came to lunch with me with her husband and her little\r\ngirl. She found some small presents and a German cake with as many\r\ncandles as she had lived years. This little surprise pleased her. In\r\nthe morning I went with Fanny and her former governess to visit a\r\ngarden on the hillside protected by wooded slopes from the wind, with\r\na view of the mountains and the sea which is reputed to be extremely\r\npretty. The villa in the centre was closed, but the garden, which\r\ncontained a large number of rare flowers and is more carefully tended\r\nthan usual here, was open. We met the owner, a merchant of Nice, at\r\nthe end of a walk where he was giving instructions to his workmen. He\r\nwas very polite, loaded us with flowers and promised me some seeds for\r\nRochecotte; his villa is called St. Helena. We returned very pleased\r\nwith our walk, although the weather was by no means kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, December 31, 1841._--The Grand Duchess called yesterday when I\r\nwas finishing lunch and carried me off to see a country house near\r\nNice which is very well situated and remarkable for the surrounding\r\nwoods of pine-trees and holm oaks and arbutus. The shade of trees is\r\nnot often to be found here, as the gardens are usually built in\r\nterraces looking southward and leading more or less towards the sea;\r\nany variety of style is therefore not to be despised. Moreover\r\nyesterday's walk reminded me of one which I had projected in the woods\r\naround Rochecotte and pleased me for this reason. The owner is a\r\nretired merchant and an old bachelor. He is very polite, and,\r\naccording to the custom of the country, loaded us with flowers and\r\ngave us orangeade to drink. I thought this refreshment cold under the\r\ncircumstances, for it was by no means hot and driving had certainly\r\nmade us no warmer. I therefore walked home from the house of the Grand\r\nDuchess to restore the circulation; the distance is about that from\r\nthe Louvre to the Arc de Triomphe in the Champs Elysées.\r\n\r\nThis is the last day of a year of which I am not sorry to see the end:\r\nit can count as two years in my life by reason of its length; however,\r\nit has not been entirely unfortunate; the months spent at Rochecotte\r\nwere quiet and the time while I was in Germany was not without\r\ninterest and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis is also the second anniversary of the death of Mgr. de Quélen. It\r\ncould not pass unnoticed by me, for he was a great loss to me, and his\r\nregular and protecting kindness left one of those gaps which can never\r\nbe filled, for nothing can take the place of that which has been\r\nconsecrated by time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1842\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 1, 1842._--Yesterday I made a very beautiful excursion\r\nwith my son-in-law. We drove to the foot of a crag on which a convent\r\nfor men is built. The church is pretty, especially by reason of a\r\nprojecting portico from which there is a beautiful view of the sea\r\nincluding Nice, the Fort of Saint Elmo, and of the chief points of the\r\nlandscape in a delightful setting. We walked up to the convent which\r\nis called Saint Pons: the religious order there established is\r\ncomparatively new, and is called _gli oblati della santissima\r\nVirgine_; young ordained priests from the time when they are allowed\r\nto say Mass, and until they can perform the holy office of confession,\r\nor in other words receive the cure of souls, spend a year here in\r\npreparation. This institution seems to me to be peculiar to Nice, and\r\nin my opinion is a very wise idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 2, 1842._--Yesterday evening I went with the\r\nCastellanes to the official reception given by the Governor of\r\nNice.[48] It is customary here that on New Year's Day every native who\r\nhas been presented at Court and all foreigners should attend this\r\nreception, the men in uniform and the women in full dress. The idea is\r\nthat in this way one congratulates the King and Queen of Sardinia. The\r\nceremony somewhat resembles a London Drawing-room, or one of the great\r\ndiplomatic routs at Paris. There were some curious figures, but on the\r\nwhole the society was unexceptionable and the crowd suffocating. Some\r\ngames were made up in the last reception-room where it was not so\r\nhot, and refreshments went round, while flowers, which are never\r\nwanting here, were to be seen everywhere in profusion, and the light\r\nwas brilliant. The whole scene looked very well. I went round the\r\nrooms twice, once on my son-in-law's arm and the second time with the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, who pays me much attention. The Grand Duchess was\r\ncovered with diamonds but not with beauty, for she had no head-dress,\r\nwhich made her look old. The Princesse Marie also looks better when\r\nshe is not so over-dressed.\r\n\r\n  [48] Comte de Maistre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 3, 1842._--The churches here are most displeasing. It\r\nis very difficult to sit down and one is surrounded by dirty and\r\nunpleasant people who spit and are verminous. The architecture is also\r\nspoilt by wretched rags of gilt and silken material, worn out and\r\ntorn, which make the most unpleasant effect. The singing of the\r\npenitents, who are here organised as brotherhoods, is by no means\r\nmelodious. Apart from what I saw of the Jesuit college, nothing in the\r\nway of religion edifies me here. In the streets you are attacked by\r\nthe most hideous beggars; all the staircases are crowded with them and\r\nare so filthy that one's skirts are only fit to throw away when one\r\ngets home.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 4, 1842._--It is grey damp weather, and one might think\r\noneself at Brighton; it has lasted now for three days and makes one\r\nthink one is being swindled. When the weather was bright there was\r\nalways the possibility of catching some inflammation of the chest,\r\nbecause the bitter wind counteracts the heat of the sun and therefore\r\nbecomes the more dangerous. When the sun goes down the wind certainly\r\nfalls, and then we are confronted by the great grey expanse of the sea\r\nwhich looks like a shroud prepared for our burial. We might still be\r\nat Paris or London.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that the condemnation of Dupoty will probably be\r\nattacked by an appeal to the Chamber of Deputies upon grounds of\r\nillegality.[49] However, the nomination of M. Sauzet to the Presidency\r\nby a great majority is a good omen for the Ministry. It is not yet\r\nknown what will be the consequence of Salvandy's return from Madrid;\r\nhe declined to hand the letters accrediting him as ambassador to\r\nEspartero; the Ambassadors at Paris consider that he was quite right,\r\nand quote as a precedent a similar case under Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n  [49] Dupoty, an ardent republican, had vigorously opposed the\r\n  July Government in certain newspapers under his management. When\r\n  Quesnel made his attempt upon the life of the Duc d'Aumale in\r\n  1841, Dupoty was prosecuted and brought before the Chamber of\r\n  Peers on a charge of moral complicity. He was condemned to five\r\n  years imprisonment, and did not recover his liberty until the\r\n  amnesty of 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 4, 1842._--I hear from Paris that the second trial\r\nbefore the Chamber of Peers will not be protracted or complicated. The\r\nrevelations made by the accused, who have been condemned to death\r\nthough they will not be executed, have made it possible to arrest some\r\nsixty individuals, all from the same class; only four or five of them\r\nwill be brought up for sentence, who are somewhat above the working\r\nclass and are most deeply compromised. It is said that the most\r\nimportant result of this second trial will be to show the ties\r\nexisting between the Communists, the party of equality and the reform\r\nparty, to which M. Arago and others belong, and of which M. Dupoty was\r\nthe secretary.\r\n\r\nThe question of etiquette which hindered Salvandy in Spain is largely\r\noccupying men's minds. M. Guizot said that he sent precise\r\ninstructions to Salvandy to return if Espartero persisted in his\r\nrefusal to allow him to present his letters to the little Queen. His\r\nreturn was expected. It is somewhat derogatory to France that her\r\nAmbassador should be allowed to depart because he claims a natural\r\nright. When Cellamare and some other ambassador came to Paris, they\r\nhanded their letters of credit to Louis XV. who was then six years of\r\nage and not to the Duc d'Orléans who was acting as Regent. This has\r\nbeen constantly repeated but produces no effect at Madrid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 6, 1842._--Yesterday it snowed for several hours in\r\nsuccession, at Nice, of all places. An icy wind was blowing which\r\nfroze us though we were sitting close round the stove in which I am\r\nburning an enormous quantity of fir-cones and sticks of olive wood\r\nwhich are sold here by the pound, and though my extravagance in this\r\nrespect is ruinous I cannot get warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 7, 1842._--Yesterday it snowed nearly all day and the\r\nsnow remained so long upon the ground that on the terrace which\r\ndivides my house from the sea, and which is a public walk, all the\r\nstreet boys of Nice gathered and made large snowballs which they\r\nhurled with savage and animal yells at every passer by. I watched this\r\nstrange spectacle from my windows as I did not go out all day.\r\n\r\nMy huge room reduces me to despair for two reasons; in the first place\r\nbecause it cannot possibly be heated and in the second because it has\r\nbrought down upon me a demand for an evening reception, issued by the\r\nGrand Duchess. I gave in, though with some regret, for it is always\r\nmore or less of an inconvenience and I am extremely lazy. I have\r\ntherefore handed over the room to Princesse Marie, to Fanny and to\r\nPauline: I have ordered my son-in-law to make all the necessary\r\narrangements and have declared that I will have nothing to do with it\r\nexcept pay the bills and receive the visitors. It is well for youth to\r\nbe at work. The Grand Duchess wishes to get up a quadrille and is\r\nstirring Nice to its foundations for that purpose. The reception is to\r\ntake place on Monday next, the 10th. There are a hundred and fifty\r\npeople on my list: it will be called a tea with dancing; the quadrille\r\nwill be given by twelve ladies representing the months of the year and\r\nfour children representing the seasons; these details may not be quite\r\naccurate as I am not interfering in the business. The Grand Duchess\r\nand Pauline, who is more vigorous now than I have seen her for a long\r\ntime, together with Comte Eugène de Césole, settle all these matters\r\nat the house of the Grand Duchess; I shall only abandon my room upon\r\nthe morning of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 11, 1842._--My reception took place yesterday. It was\r\nnot exactly a ball but a tea with a little music, after which there\r\nwere several figure dances, a mazurka and two waltzes. It was all over\r\nby one o'clock.\r\n\r\nWhen Count Pahlen left Paris, our embassy at St. Petersburg received\r\norders not to appear at Court on St. Nicholas' Day and the ambassadors\r\npleaded illness as an excuse. M. de Kisseleff and all the Russians\r\nwere then ordered not to appear at the Tuileries on New Year's Day. On\r\nthis subject Barante writes as follows: \"I had been expecting for some\r\ntime that the strange idea of showing some personal feeling, apart\r\nfrom Cabinet policy, would oblige the Emperor to form a definite\r\nresolution. I think, however, that at present he will try to make his\r\naction as little resolute as possible. Probably the return of Count\r\nPahlen will be indefinitely delayed.\"\r\n\r\nApart from this our Ministry has a majority and seems well content.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 13, 1842._--I hear from Paris that M. de Salvandy has\r\nbeen ordered to return with all his attachés; his embassy will have\r\nbeen of very short duration. Thus we are on as bad terms with the\r\nextreme south of Europe as with the extreme north. Every one is agreed\r\nin saying that Espartero's demands were inadmissible and that he was\r\nurged to them by England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 16, 1842._--At St. Petersburg invitations have been\r\nwithdrawn which had been sent to Casimir-Perier[50] for several\r\nparties, while the boxes at the theatre to the right and left of his\r\nown have been vacated by orders of the authority. What will be the end\r\nof all this?\r\n\r\n  [50] Then French Chargé d'Affaires at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 17, 1842._--Yesterday I spent the latter half of the\r\nmorning with the wife of the governor, the Comtesse de Maistre, who\r\nwas at home with her family. Her sister-in-law[51] who is unmarried,\r\nis a clever person. M. de Maistre is an excellent talker and Madame de\r\nMaistre seems a most pleasant woman; I have spent the most enjoyable\r\nvisits here, as regards conversation, that Nice can offer.\r\n\r\n  [51] Afterwards Madame de Terray; she was born in 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 19, 1842._--Yesterday was a charming day and I went for\r\na walk for two hours with my son-in-law, strolling by the sea,\r\nwatching the poor galley slaves at work in the harbour; observing the\r\neffects of the sunlight on the sea and the brilliant reflections upon\r\nthe mountains, the upper parts of which were covered with snow;\r\nwatching also the ships with their lateen sails, and from time to time\r\nexchanging a few words with acquaintances who were attracted by this\r\ncharming day to follow our example.\r\n\r\nMadame de la Redorte writes from Paris that an unparalleled ovation\r\nhas been given by the Carlist party to the Russian Chargé d'Affaires,\r\nM. de Kisseleff, after the outburst of personal feeling: he was\r\ntriumphantly received at their club without any suggestion on his\r\npart. However, he has been invited to the great hall at the Tuileries\r\nand I presume he will appear there. She also says that the intimacy\r\nbetween M. Guizot and Madame de Lieven has become of such a character\r\nas to arouse public feeling, and that reference will probably be made\r\nto it in the Chamber of Deputies. The newspapers apparently take no\r\nnotice of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 20, 1842._--I spent yesterday morning in preparing the\r\ndecorations for a quadrille which has been entrusted to my care. After\r\ndinner I dressed the hair of my four ladies; their entrance to the\r\nball with their four gentlemen was most successful; Pauline and Fanny\r\nin blue and black, Madame de Césole and an Italian lady in rose and\r\nblack, all four covered with diamonds and wearing the Spanish mantilla\r\nvery gracefully. M. de Césole and Frederick Leveson, the son of Lord\r\nGranville, were the blue knights, while Lord Aston and a young Russian\r\nwere the knights in rose colour. It was a pretty ball, excellently\r\nlighted, with a large number of tasteful and fashionable costumes, but\r\nI thought our quadrille was the prettiest of all. Madame de Césole and\r\nPauline were the queens of the entertainment. Madame de Césole has a\r\nvery Spanish face, and though worn by the cares of six children in\r\nimmediate succession, she is still very pretty with the help of a\r\nlittle adornment; she is a very nice and pleasant person. Pauline\r\nlooks quite beautiful: she is, moreover, very fashionable, much sought\r\nafter, and takes the lead, more or less, everywhere. She seems to\r\nplease every one, even the most serious, and her success makes her the\r\nmore beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 21, 1842._--I have a letter from the Duc de Noailles\r\nannouncing the marriage of his daughter to their cousin Maurice. He\r\nthen devoted four pages to eulogising the talent of Mlle. Rachel and\r\ntold me that he is advising her to play Célimène, and that the chief\r\nadvice he has given is to be deeply in love, as the whole secret of\r\nthe part consists in that.\r\n\r\nYesterday the weather was very fine and I took advantage of it to\r\nascend with my son-in-law, on foot, an imposing mountain which\r\nseparates old from new Nice; a winding path has been made by which the\r\nascent is comparatively easy. From the summit the view over the sea at\r\ncertain times discloses not only the island of Sainte Marguerite, but\r\nalso Corsica; to right and left the old and new town are spread out as\r\nin a panorama, while at the back one sees a circle of hills which shut\r\nin Nice from the north; these hills are covered with villas, churches\r\nand convents and stand out against a background of fine rocks which\r\nare over-topped by snow-covered peaks. The variety and extent of the\r\nview make this walk interesting. On the top of the mountain upon a\r\nwide expanse are to be found the remains of an old ruined fort.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 24, 1842._--Yesterday after dinner I went to the Grand\r\nDuchess Stephanie, to hear a new play by Scribe read; it is making\r\nsome stir in Paris and is called _The Chain_. It was read to us by M.\r\nde Maistre, who is a good reader. The play is in five acts; the\r\ndialogue is witty, the plot well developed and the stage management\r\nperfect, in short it is distinctly interesting, but to me the\r\ntriviality of style characteristic of the author was obvious and an\r\nexcessive complication of incident spoils the rapidity of the action\r\nand fatigues the spectator for the moment. On the stage it should go\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nBarante writes: \"Our little quarrel with Russia seems to be composed;\r\npinpricks have been answered by pinpricks. The Emperor is pleased to\r\nlet the matter drop and perhaps will behave more carefully in future.\r\nIt is said that Count Pahlen may be back in six weeks. The fears of\r\nall the Russians here that they may be recalled from their dear Paris\r\nare quite amusing.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Salvandy is to arrive to-day, after an extraordinary experience\r\nas ambassador. The result would have been the same with any one else,\r\nbut I am assured that his language, his attitude and his despatches\r\nhave been something unheard-of in the annals of diplomacy. I am sorry,\r\nfor he is an upright and excellent man of talent and sound judgment.\"\r\nSo much for Barante. I have also a letter from Salvandy himself dated\r\nJanuary 16 and written from Tours on his way back to Paris: \"For six\r\nweeks I have lived in the midst of constant annoyance and\r\napprehension, and continual work, with more despatches than any\r\nenergetic and permanent embassy ever produced, has filled my days and\r\nmy nights. I have encountered difficulties which I pointed out and in\r\nthe face of which I received the strongest reassurances, but hateful\r\nintrigues rendered them insurmountable. For sixteen days no written\r\nmessage reached me and even ordinary couriers have been stopped. I\r\nprotracted negotiations as long as possible, and cut them short when I\r\nwas bound either to flee or to be driven away. Now what is to be done?\r\nOne point I will guarantee, that France can do what she wishes in\r\nSpain; Spain has offered me full satisfaction for the insolence\r\nsuggested to her authorities. At Bayonne I found an excellent note\r\nfrom Lord Aberdeen, hoping that English influence was not to be found\r\nin this matter and pronouncing in favour of the principles supported\r\nby France. At Paris I shall learn what will be the result of the\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 26, 1842._--The Duchesse d'Albuféra writes telling me\r\nthat M. de Salvandy has returned to Paris and says that a large number\r\nof ridiculous observations are attributed to him; for instance, he is\r\nsaid to have written from Tolosa, \"The French Embassy is touching the\r\nPyrenees and to-morrow will pass the Bidassoa.\" At every stage he sent\r\nhis attachés one after the other, riding headlong to Paris to announce\r\nhis progress. He has left the young son of M. Decazes at Madrid as\r\nChargé d'Affaires. The unanimous assent of the Cortes to Espartero's\r\ndemands further complicates the question.\r\n\r\nThe new _Stabat_ by Rossini is now the rage at Paris; it is said to be\r\nsuperb but by no means religious, and I hear that secular words would\r\nsuit the composition quite as well. In any case it is enough to show\r\nthat this fine musical genius is not dead, as might have been feared\r\nin view of his long silence. Grisi is said to be admirable in the\r\nsolos of this _Stabat_; her head has been turned by the singer Mario;\r\nher husband wishes to separate from her but she declines for some\r\nreason unknown, while the refusal obliges her at this moment, for some\r\nreason unknown to me, to pay her husband eight hundred thousand\r\nfrancs, which by no means pleases the lady. She expressed her grief to\r\nLablache who advised her, with his inimitable Italian accent, to have\r\nthe separation rather than to pay and said, \"But what does it matter\r\nto you? Everybody knows that you are a bad lot!\" In view of so\r\nexcellent a quotation, I make no further comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, January 28, 1842._--Yesterday I called upon Princesse Marie who\r\nis confined to the house by indisposition. She told me of several\r\nroyal marriages: that of Princess Marie of Prussia, the king's cousin,\r\nwith the Crown Prince of Bavaria; this is a mixed marriage, but all\r\nthe children will be brought up as Catholics. One of the young\r\nprincesses of Bavaria is to marry the Hereditary Archduke of Modena;\r\nthe Crown Prince of Sardinia will marry one of the daughters of the\r\nArchduke, who is Viceroy of Milan; while the Princess of Nassau, the\r\nhalf-sister of the reigning duke, is to marry the Prince of Neuwied. I\r\nwish that some husband could be found for poor Marie herself. I think\r\nthis would be the best remedy for her mother's terrible attacks of\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes as follows: \"Salvandy has been wanting in\r\ntact, Aston in goodwill, and the Spanish Government in common sense;\r\nfor all this is obviously against its interests. Attempts have been\r\nmade to point this out through other powers. Recent events at Madrid\r\nregarding the point of etiquette remove all possibility that\r\nEspartero's regency will be of long duration. The English Cabinet has\r\nespoused the cause of France, but somewhat late, for Salvandy had then\r\ngone, while Aston had previously supported the claims of Espartero.\r\nHowever, English opinion has been noted and will have full weight.\r\n\r\n\"I need say nothing further concerning the so-called indisposition of\r\nPérier and Kisseleff, as it has come to an end. My brother tells me\r\nthat our Ambassador will shortly return here.\r\n\r\n\"The King of Prussia has actually gone to England.[52] Imagine that\r\nwhen he reached Ostend the English ships had not arrived. In general,\r\npeople think that the King of Prussia has been more than obliging;\r\ncertainly no great Sovereign ever did as much. Lord Melbourne will be\r\npresent at the baptism, the Palmerstons have been invited for another\r\nday, and Lady Jersey I should think not at all. She has not seen the\r\nQueen since her husband was chief equerry. I do not know why King\r\nLeopold is not to be present at the baptism. It is strange.\"\r\n\r\n  [52] King Frederick William went to England for the baptism of\r\n  the Prince of Wales, to whom he stood godfather.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 2, 1842._--This is a day which used always to be kept\r\nas a festival in our house; M. de Talleyrand was born on February 2,\r\n1754; he would now be eighty-eight years of age, and has been dead\r\nnearly four years. As one advances in life these painful anniversaries\r\nwhich mark progress with bitter memories become more frequent.\r\n\r\nYesterday I paid a visit to France with the Grand Duchess and a fairly\r\nnumerous company, that is to say, we crossed the Var and went to the\r\ncastle of Villeneuve which belongs to M. de Panis, a Provençal\r\ngentleman of considerable wealth and importance. I had met him before\r\nat the house of one of his cousins. He spends his winters at this\r\nresidence near the Var: he has restored it and if he had not daubed\r\nthe old walls and the great towers with yellow paint, it would be as\r\nremarkable for its architecture as it is for its position and the\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 7, 1842._--Yesterday in consequence of a headache I\r\nmissed one of the chief amusements of Italy, the battle of confetti,\r\nwhich takes place on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday. Everybody was\r\nupon the promenade throwing handfuls, and I met people in the evening\r\nwho had thrown so energetically that they could not raise their arms.\r\nThis festival is a great delight to all the street boys who yell so\r\nloudly that I could hear them in my bed. A little French warship is in\r\nthe harbour here: the crew disembarked and came on to the promenade\r\nand the sailors in holiday attire danced a special dance of their own.\r\nIt was said to be very pretty. My son-in-law has invited the officers\r\nof the brig to be present at an entertainment given at his house this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange custom in force here during the carnival: in the\r\nmorning all the streets are full of masks and gaiety reaches the\r\nheight of insanity, but at nightfall the masks disappear and every\r\nmember of a confraternity assumes the dress of a penitent; men and\r\nwomen alike with candles in their hands follow processions which\r\nemerge at the same moment from every church, to the sound of bells;\r\nthe priest bearing the holy sacrament under a canopy concludes the\r\nprocession. Wherever these processions go they produce a strange\r\neffect: there are penitents in grey, white, black and red and every\r\none in the streets falls upon their knees; the penitents sing and wave\r\ntheir candles and the general spectacle is rather gloomy than\r\nedifying. When these processions are over the masked balls begin. The\r\nprocessions are intended to expiate or counterbalance the excesses of\r\nthe carnival.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 8, 1842 (Shrove Tuesday)._--Yesterday morning was\r\nspent in preparing Pauline's costumes. The Grand Duchess lent her some\r\ndiamonds and these with her own and mine looked very well. She was\r\nvery pretty and gave an excellent reproduction of the difficult part\r\nof the Duchesse de Chevreuse in _A Duel under Richelieu_, which is a\r\nhigh-flown melodrama: this was followed by a duo-bouffe sung by two\r\nItalians and then came a little piece, _The Heirs_, in which my\r\nson-in-law took the part of Alain most creditably. The whole company\r\nacted very well, the room was pretty and all the accessories perfect.\r\nThe actors came to supper at my house and the Grand Duchess surprised\r\nme by appearing. She insisted that my health should be drunk, as the\r\nentertainment was given for my birthday which was on the 6th of\r\nFebruary but was put off to avoid falling upon a Sunday. The party did\r\nnot break up until two o'clock in the morning; it was somewhat tiring\r\nbut they all showed such kindness to me that I could not but be duly\r\ngrateful and have an agreeable recollection of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 9, 1842 (Ash Wednesday)._--Yesterday I was able to\r\ntake part in all the carnival absurdities in progress. First there was\r\nlunch with dancing at the house of a great Russian lady, which is\r\nsituated in one of the finest gardens in Nice. We then went to Corso\r\nwhere the battle of confetti had already begun. I was with the Grand\r\nDuchess, Princesse Marie and Fanny: after driving round we halted upon\r\na reserved terrace from which we were able to throw our handfuls upon\r\nthe passers by; they replied from below and the most fashionable threw\r\nlittle bunches of violets or roses instead of confetti or sweets.\r\nSweets are thrown with a kind of spoon with which they can be sent a\r\nlong way; the women wear masks of iron wire, for if these sweets are\r\nthrown vigorously they can hurt when they strike the bare flesh. What\r\nis remarkable but real, is the kind of fury which comes over the\r\ncoolest, and people lose their heads sooner or later. Pauline was more\r\nexcited than any one in the Corso. I was told that the late Emperor of\r\nAustria, Francis II., who was certainly anything but a lively\r\ncharacter, happened to be at Rome in carnival time and took part in\r\nthe contest like a madman. Members of fashionable society show the\r\ngreatest vigour; the common people only think of picking up the\r\nsweets. The military band was playing at the end of the promenade, the\r\nweather was superb and we stayed out of doors until nightfall without\r\nfeeling cold. At half-past eight there was a ball given by some other\r\nforeigners, which was by far the prettiest, the best arranged and the\r\nmost cheerful of all that have been given here.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchess has told me a piece of news which vexes her:\r\nPrincess Alexandrina of Baden is to marry the Hereditary Prince of\r\nCoburg; it is hard for her to see possible husbands passing her\r\ndaughter by, seeing that Princesse Marie is far pleasanter, more\r\ndistinguished and richer than her cousin. The Grand Duchess is anxious\r\nto know what will become of her daughter after her, especially in view\r\nof the death of the Queen Dowager of Bavaria. She is also uneasy\r\nconcerning the Wasa family, whose affairs are terribly involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 10, 1842._--The weather yesterday was incomparable and\r\nthe month of May is not more beautiful at Paris, so after hearing the\r\noffice of the Ashes and lunching, we took advantage of the weather.\r\nThe Castellanes in their little carriage drawn by two Corsican ponies,\r\nFanny, Count Schulenburg, my brother-in-law, who had come from Milan\r\nto pay me a short visit, and myself, went to Villefranche, a\r\npicturesque little seaport; the road thither was not very easy, but\r\nthe view was admirable. A Sardinian warship was leaving the harbour\r\nand from the top of the fort which serves as a state prison, we saw\r\nher setting sail and making the necessary manœuvres to catch the\r\nbreeze before she left the harbour and entered the open sea. The slow\r\nand measured movements of the fine ship gliding over a sea of marble\r\nand diamonds, with the white sails shining in the southern sun, formed\r\none of the most beautiful sights conceivable and one which strikes the\r\nmind even more than the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 17, 1842._--Yesterday I received the following letter\r\nfrom poor Salvandy; \"Since my return I have been overcome with a\r\nconstant sense of deep depression, disgust and weariness; an attack of\r\ngout has come rather as a help than as an additional burden, as it has\r\nexcused me from going out or seeing people; only for the last few days\r\nhave I been in communication with the salons. I should need volumes to\r\ntell you all that has astonished or saddened me upon my return. My\r\naction has received entire approval, except as concerns my long delay\r\nbefore leaving Madrid; whereas society accuses me of acting with\r\nundue precipitation. In the comparatively narrow circle where I\r\nthought I had my friends, I have encountered most unwelcome\r\nmalevolence. I find that my period of delay by which I hoped to\r\nfacilitate the adoption of a policy, if any were possible, has been\r\nused to poison public feeling against me; society ladies can repeat\r\nnumberless quotations from my despatches, naturally imaginary or\r\ndistorted; ladies, moreover, whom I thought would be most likely to\r\ntake my part, as they are those who are in closest touch with the\r\nchief officials of the department. However, as I have been obliged to\r\nsend all my despatches to the great Courts, marks of flattering\r\napproval have been returned. Saint-Aulaire writes to say that they are\r\nimperishable memorials of public right, and Bresson sends me a similar\r\nmessage from the Prussian Court.\r\n\r\n\"The Ministerial position here seems to me very precarious. You will\r\nsee the amount of our majority yesterday; only eight votes upon the\r\nquestion of incompatibility. I am inclined to think that we may do\r\nbetter upon the electoral question, but MM. de Lamartine, Passy, Dupin\r\nand Dufaure will speak against the Ministry; supposing that we are\r\nsuccessful in spite of this effort, a shock remains which we shall\r\nprobably not survive. What will happen then? A Cabinet without Thiers\r\nor Guizot is difficult to form and even more difficult to maintain in\r\noffice, and if the one was not possible the other will not be yet; but\r\nI am entirely outside this movement. On the day of my arrival when I\r\nhad an attack of gout, I hastened to pay my respects to the King, the\r\nPrince Royal, Queen Christina and M. Guizot, being convinced that I\r\nshould not be able to do so the next day, and in fact I have been\r\nconfined for several days to my armchair.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes to-day as follows: \"The King of Prussia has\r\nwon golden opinions at London; he pleased the Court, the town, the\r\nclergy, the journalists and the people. Even that which we from a\r\ndistance are inclined to think too sentimental has been successful in\r\nEngland; I mean his acts of worship with Mrs. Fry,[53] &c. He is said\r\nto be seriously meditating a union of the Anglican and Lutheran\r\nchurches, and it is thought that something will come of his journey to\r\nEngland from this point of view. I do not think that the idea will\r\nplease his subjects and at Paris it is received with much opposition.\"\r\n\r\n  [53] Mrs. Fry was a Quakeress, well known at London for her\r\n  charity. The King of Prussia had been anxious to see her, and in\r\n  the course of this visit she asked him to give his subjects the\r\n  fullest liberty of conscience.\r\n\r\n\"The entertainment given to the King by the Duke of Sutherland was\r\nfairy-like; he is said to have been greatly struck by it. Some sign of\r\nboredom with Court life on his part is thought to have been perceived.\r\nThe Queen's evening receptions do not amuse him nor is he interested\r\nby her conversation, or by her handsome husband playing chess like an\r\nautomaton.\r\n\r\n\"Sainte-Aulaire pleases the English as much as ever and his wife will\r\nsoon start to rejoin him. Barante is awaiting the return of Pahlen.\r\nSome people think that he will not return, but we shall see.\r\n\r\n\"The carnival was magnificent and the ball given by the Duc d'Orléans\r\nmore magnificent than any ball under the Empire or the Restoration.\r\nPeople are now occupied with domestic matters; the Ministry combats\r\nall reforms and the reformers are fairly strong.\r\n\r\n\"Lehon will not return here as ambassador. The Cowleys open their\r\nhouse next week.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that the King of Prussia's journey to London caused much\r\ndispleasure at Berlin. It was thought that a great Sovereign was going\r\nto too much trouble and expense and showing too much courtesy to a\r\nQueen so distantly related. National pride and avarice were wounded.\r\nThe presents brought by the King were magnificent and his fortnight's\r\ntour during which he was the Queen's guest in England, is said to\r\nhave cost him a million crowns, which is an enormous sum for\r\npoverty-stricken Prussia. Moreover the religious reunion to which\r\nMadame de Lieven refers is exactly what Prussia does not want; the\r\nlate King, who was greatly honoured, nearly brought confusion upon\r\nhis country by interfering too constantly with religious practices and\r\ndogma, and the seeds of ill-temper still remain in the country to the\r\ninconvenience of the Government. If these should be restored to life,\r\nmen's minds and, what is worse, their consciences will be in a ferment\r\nand an additional cause of discord will be introduced into a country\r\nwhere religious feeling is already very sensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 21, 1842._--Yesterday I went to the convent of Saint\r\nBarthélemy. It is customary here to go every Sunday during Lent to\r\nhear vespers in one of the many convents by which Nice is surrounded.\r\nThe whole population goes out, eats and drinks in front of the\r\nchurches, where toys and flowers are sold. Music and dancing are\r\nforbidden during Lent, and popular pleasures are therefore reduced to\r\neating. The crowds of people, the carriages, the donkeys, and the\r\nriding horses of strangers make the scene animated and pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 23, 1842._--I have just heard of the death of poor\r\nPozzo di Borgo. It was best for him and for his family that his life\r\nshould end, as he merely vegetated. He leaves an income of four\r\nhundred thousand francs; half to his nephew Charles, the husband of\r\nMlle. de Crillon, with his residence in Paris and his villa at Saint\r\nCloud, and the remainder to his relatives in Corsica.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 25, 1842._--Yesterday there was a heartrending scene\r\nin front of my windows; a terrible storm arose which has not even\r\nto-day sunk to rest; the unfortunate ships were struggling with the\r\nfury of the waves the whole day, and we sat for a long time watching\r\ntheir fate. Fortunately none were lost.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the terrible weather I went out to take my offering to a\r\ncollection which was being made for the Sisters of Saint Vincent de\r\nPaul, at the hospice which they conduct. There I saw Mlle. de Maistre,\r\nthe eldest daughter of the Governor, who is twenty-one years of age\r\nand is spending her novitiate as a Sister of Charity in the hospice.\r\nShe has a definite call to the work, and seems happy; she is said to\r\nbe clever and well educated, as all the family are; she has a\r\npleasant face, intelligent and calm.\r\n\r\nM. Pasquier, I am told, is being complimented on his nomination to the\r\nFrench Academy. M. Molé will introduce M. de Tocqueville, and M. de\r\nBarante will do the same for M. Ballanche; I do not know who will\r\nintroduce M. Pasquier. M. de Tocqueville is taking the place of M. de\r\nCessac, formerly director of the Ministry of War under the Empire, and\r\nnot a promising subject for a eulogy; indeed, it will be difficult for\r\nany one to treat it, and especially so for M. de Tocqueville, who does\r\nnot belong to that time either in point of age or mental habits. He\r\nmentioned his difficulty to M. Thiers, who told him that he might\r\nperhaps be able to help him and would give him some interesting\r\ninformation, as he possesses letters from the Emperor to M. de Cessac\r\nwhich he would send him. M. de Tocqueville, in fact, received the next\r\nday, in an envelope, a letter from Napoleon to M. de Cessac, which\r\nbegan as follows: \"My dear Cessac, you are a fool.\" M. de Tocqueville\r\nhimself related this amusing incident to his cousin, the Marquis\r\nd'Espeuil, who is here. M. d'Espeuil married Mlle. de Chateaubriand, a\r\nnear relation of M. de Tocqueville.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, February 27, 1842._--I have a letter from M. de Barante who\r\nseems less certain concerning the return of Count Pahlen to Paris;\r\nprobably the return will be indefinitely delayed until some incident\r\nsettles the matter one way or the other. Meanwhile Périer is at St.\r\nPetersburg and his official position is quite correct, but society\r\ncontinues to regard him as an outcast, wishing to show that its sense\r\nof patriotism and self-respect has been wounded.\r\n\r\nBarante gives me better news of the domestic situation. The majority\r\nof forty-one seems to be really important, as the opposition, which\r\ncombined every shade of opinion, had set all their hopes upon this\r\ndiscussion. The Minister himself hardly expected so large a majority.\r\nThe speeches of M. Dufaure and M. de Lamartine were received by the\r\nCentres with the strongest censure; every word which seemed to\r\nconform to the doctrines of the Left aroused opposition; in short,\r\nthere is a certain reaction in favour of order and conservatism. We\r\nhave now to see if it will have any influence upon the elections. If\r\nthis hope were realised, France would be in a better position than for\r\nthe last ten years. Such at least is the idea of Barante, though he is\r\nrather optimistic.\r\n\r\nHe also tells me that M. de Chateaubriand, whom he met at Madame\r\nRécamier's house at the Abbaye-au-Bois, has grown surly, taciturn and\r\ndispleased with everybody and everything. Madame Récamier has a\r\ndifficult task, as her business is to soothe the touchiness of wounded\r\npride and to provide a series of the successes for which alone M. de\r\nChateaubriand cares to live. I could never feel the smallest sympathy\r\nfor this barren and vain character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 3, 1842._--This evening we are to celebrate Mid-Lent by\r\nan entertainment from which I would gladly be excused, not that I\r\nanticipate any bad results, but because I think pleasure of this kind,\r\nif it is not to result in a fiasco, demands more time and trouble than\r\nit is worth. Moreover the Castellanes have given me the task of\r\nsending out the invitations, and my fingers are worn out with writing\r\naddresses: further, I myself and none other have to make the four\r\ncostumes of Pauline and those of Charles de Talleyrand: then they want\r\nme to coach them in their parts; I am to receive the company; I have\r\nalso to play in a wretched little scene in the second piece, which is\r\ntrifling, but I have to learn my part and repeat it, and finally I\r\nhave to provide supper for the actors. This is too much. However, I\r\nhave spent my life in being tyrannised over by somebody, and to give\r\nway is, I think, a part that I have least forgotten in my past life,\r\nand I have sometimes obeyed more reluctantly than now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 4, 1842._--I feel somewhat stupid this morning:\r\nyesterday's performance was too long, and the supper which followed it\r\nprolonged the evening still further. I think people were amused. The\r\nprettiest part of the entertainment was the prologue composed by my\r\nson-in-law. It was a clever criticism of the previous performance, in\r\nwhich a handsome young boy satirised the different actors and\r\nsuggested a young débutante to take the place of the prima donna, who\r\nwas supposed to be suddenly indisposed: then two boys dressed as\r\nlacqueys of the last century brought in a little sedan chair, gilded\r\nand surmounted by a crown of lighted candles; from this chair came out\r\nmy little girl, Marie, in full dress of the time of Louis XV.,\r\npowdered wig, long dress and many diamonds. Nothing could have been\r\nprettier, more dignified, more stately and gracious. On leaving her\r\nchair she went round the stage exactly like a great lady. The prologue\r\nwas charming and was greatly appreciated; I foolishly began to weep\r\nwith emotion on seeing the gracefulness of this dear child. The\r\nmelodrama was very well played: the _Malade Imaginaire_ was not\r\nsufficiently well known or taken sufficiently briskly; moreover it\r\nmade the entertainment much too long. The costumes of the melodrama\r\nwere magnificent, and in the _Malade Imaginaire_ were precisely those\r\nof Molière's age. To conclude, the three couplets at the end, composed\r\nby the Grand Duchess, were charming and in the best of taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 14, 1842._--Prince Wasa arrived here yesterday from\r\nFlorence, where he has left his wife, to pay a few days' visit to his\r\nmother-in-law, the Grand Duchess Stephanie. I think she would have\r\nbeen glad to avoid this attention. She took him about everywhere as\r\nsoon as he arrived, and we met them on the French schooner, commanded\r\nby M. de Clérambault. A party of us, including the Castellanes, Fanny,\r\nCharles de Talleyrand and myself, paid a visit to this vessel and to\r\nthe yacht of Lord Ranelagh, which is also at anchor in the harbour at\r\nNice. M. de Clérambault was a comrade of my son, M. de Dino, when he\r\nwas serving in the Navy. I was much impressed to see in his cabin,\r\nround his mother's portrait, a rosary and a little crucifix which had\r\nbeen given him by the Pope on the condition that he would hang them up\r\nin his cabin, which he scrupulously does. This young officer greatly\r\ndistinguished himself at the capture of Saint Juan d'Ulloa[54] and\r\nwas decorated in consequence at the age of twenty-eight. What a pity\r\nmy son did not follow the same career.\r\n\r\n  [54] High-handed action in Mexico to the detriment of French\r\n  residents obliged the French Government to raise claims in 1837,\r\n  which produced no result. A French fleet then blockaded the fort\r\n  of Saint Juan d'Ulloa, which commands the entrance to Vera Cruz.\r\n  The fleet, under the command of Rear-Admiral Baudin, captured the\r\n  fort on November 27, 1838, after a resistance of several months,\r\n  and then obliged the Mexican Government to sign a treaty at Vera\r\n  Cruz on March 9, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 15, 1842._--Yesterday morning was devoted to the open\r\nair. The Grand Duchess had arranged a picnic of twenty people,\r\nincluding ourselves. We drove, each from our own starting-places, to\r\nan inn situated at the top of a mountain which rises between the bay\r\nof Nice and that of Villefranche; then returning by another mountain\r\nwe went to Beaulieu, where we lunched under great olive-trees. After\r\nthis we mounted donkeys and followed a rather narrow path round the\r\nbay of Saint-Soupir and reached Saint-Hospice, where Lord Ranelagh's\r\nyacht was lying. The weather was so fine, the sea so calm and the\r\ndistance so short that even I was persuaded to venture. However, far\r\nfrom being contrary, the wind was so light that we hardly moved, and\r\nspent an hour and a half in returning to Nice, a journey usually made\r\nin half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 18, 1842._--Madame de Lieven writes that Sainte-Aulaire\r\nis giving great satisfaction, both at London and at Paris, but there\r\nis and will be, none the less, a certain amount of friction between\r\nthe two Cabinets. The King of Prussia will go to St. Petersburg at the\r\nend of June.\r\n\r\nM. Bresson writes that Count Maltzan is not likely to take the\r\nportfolio of Foreign Affairs, and it is not yet known whether the King\r\nwill decide to replace him with Kanitz or Bülow. The two men represent\r\ndivergent views. Kanitz is a pietist and legitimist, while Bülow is\r\nneither one nor the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 21, 1842._--For some days I have been feeling distinctly\r\nill, and the day before yesterday my feverishness became so pronounced\r\nthat I was obliged to go to bed, and was soon afterwards covered with\r\nan eruption all over my body. It is an epidemic which has been\r\nprevalent here for the last fortnight, and is called in Italian\r\n_rosalia_; it is a medium between scarlatina and measles, and is less\r\nmalignant than either of these diseases, though at the same time it\r\nmakes the patient feel very ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 24, 1842._--People here are very kind, and every one\r\nshows more interest in me than I deserve on account of my illness. The\r\nGrand Duchess came to see me as soon as her daughter was attacked by\r\nthe same disease, and her fears of carrying infection were removed.\r\nThe Comtesse Adèle de Maistre, a sister of the Governor--a kind,\r\nclever, and benevolent saint, who has taken a fancy to me--nurses me\r\nas if I was her sister, for which I am deeply grateful. The good prior\r\nof the Récollets de Cimier heard from his mendicant brother, who\r\nbrings me flowers in exchange for what I put in his wallet, that I was\r\nill, and came to see me; I was very glad to see him. The doctor\r\nassures me that my convalescence is in sight, and that in a few days\r\nhe will allow me to go into the open air. In this climate eruptive\r\nsicknesses are not as serious as they are elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 27, 1842._--Society here is about to disperse. However,\r\nsome foreign families remain at Nice even during the summer; the\r\nclimate and the cheapness of living induces many people to stay, if\r\nnot permanently, at any rate for several years in succession.\r\n\r\nThis morning I was suddenly aroused by cannon-shots, announcing Easter\r\nDay. These, with the rattles of the street boys and the guns of the\r\ngarrisons, made an appalling uproar. Yesterday all the houses, and\r\nevery room in every house, were blessed by one of the parish priests,\r\nwho sprinkles all the dwellings with water, and is followed by a\r\nchoir-boy.\r\n\r\nA letter from Germany, which I have just received, gives me some news\r\nof considerable importance to my personal interests. My nephew has\r\ndefinitely refused to agree to the arrangement proposed by his mother,\r\nand my sister has sold me the whole of the allodial part of Sagan, or\r\nthe part which she claimed to be subject to this condition. This will\r\nconsiderably complicate my business, and will absolutely force me to\r\ntravel to Prussia next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 29, 1842._--Yesterday I went for a drive, and left cards\r\nupon all who had inquired for me during my illness. I feel that the\r\nopen air did me much good.\r\n\r\nM. de Barante writes to say that M. de Rémusat is giving readings from\r\na work called _Abélard_;[55] he speaks of it as a singular production\r\nin dramatic form, the reading of which will occupy three sessions of\r\nthree hours each--a very long period.\r\n\r\n  [55] This work by M. de Rémusat eventually appeared in 1845; it\r\n  contains a masterly exposition of Abélard's teaching and his\r\n  scholastic philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, March 30, 1842._--I hope soon to leave this town, and I shall\r\nwrite more freely as soon as I am on French territory; for in the\r\nSardinian states before a letter arrives or leaves its starting-place,\r\nit has generally been opened several times. The traces are obvious,\r\nand this knowledge has often paralysed my pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nice, April 1, 1842._--Yesterday evening I went to a great ball given\r\nby the Duke of Devonshire, as a conclusion to the season at Nice. Like\r\neverything that he does, it was magnificent; the lighting of the hall\r\nwas especially novel and beautiful; there were no chandeliers, but\r\nthree great arches formed of palm branches and surmounted with a row\r\nof candles; each of these arches was placed upon the pillars at each\r\nside of the hall, a most novel and tasteful device. I there said\r\ngood-bye to all the company present. I leave Nice fairly well\r\nsatisfied with my stay. There have been some drawbacks, but the good\r\nside outweighs the bad, and my general recollections will be pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aix-en-Provence, April 3, 1842._--I left Nice yesterday and was very\r\nsorry to part from the Castellane trio. They are no less sorry at my\r\ndeparture. The weather was superb, the sea a deep blue, the flowers\r\nabundant and the road admirable as far as Cannes. The hills of the\r\nEsterel were still somewhat rough. I came on here without stopping,\r\nhoping to find the Abbé Dupanloup and to have a talk with him. I only\r\nmissed him by an hour. He has been forced to go forward without\r\nstopping, owing to the regulations of the postal service; he left me a\r\nlittle note expressing his regret. I am now starting for Nîmes and\r\nshall go by way of Arles, a road which I do not know. Nîmes I visited\r\nduring my first journey to the south, in 1817, a terribly long time\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nîmes, April 5, 1842._--I arrived here yesterday evening. It was\r\nraining when we passed by Arles and I was unable to visit the points\r\nof interest. I was especially struck by the new and magnificent road,\r\nfull of works of art, which crosses the most frightful country in the\r\nworld and leads here from Aix. First of all it crosses a district\r\ncalled the Crau, which is horribly sterile and is composed of nothing\r\nbut pebbles. Water has been drawn from the Durance to irrigate this\r\naccursed land by an infinity of little canals. It can only be hoped\r\nthat these measures may evoke a little vegetation. From Arles onwards\r\nthe country is less ugly, though the Camargue is not beautiful, and\r\napart from some wild oxen I saw nothing curious. The girls of Arles\r\nhave a great reputation for their beauty and their pretty costumes.\r\nHere I was unfortunate, for I saw nothing but very ugly faces and very\r\ndirty and slovenly dresses.\r\n\r\nMy travelling companions, Fanny, her governess and Charles de\r\nTalleyrand are starting to see the Pont du Gard which I saw a long\r\ntime ago. On their return we shall visit the curiosities of the town\r\nand go on together to Montpellier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Montpellier, April 6, 1842._--Yesterday we visited the antiquities of\r\nNîmes, which I was glad to see again. They are well preserved, and I\r\ncan remember that some years ago they made me understand the charm of\r\nreal proportion. Unfortunately the weather is wretched and it is very\r\nvexing to encounter rain in a country which constantly suffers from\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Toulouse, April 8, 1842._--We left Montpellier the day before\r\nyesterday at the end of the morning. I gave lunch to the Rector of the\r\nAcademy[56] and to his eldest daughter who is my goddaughter, for her\r\nmother, who died of the cholera, had been brought up with me, and I\r\nhave always kept up my connection with this very estimable family.\r\nThen we went to see the Fabre[57] museum which is poor, and the better\r\nchosen and better arranged museum of the Marquis of Montcalm. Finally,\r\nunder umbrellas, we went round the famous promenade of Peyrou. In good\r\nweather, which we did not enjoy yesterday, the sea, the Pyrenees, the\r\nCévennes and the Alps, can be seen from a certain point. All that we\r\ncould see was the castle, the aqueducts and the equestrian statue of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\n  [56] At that time M. Gergonne, officer of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\n  [57] The museum of Montpellier is now one of the best of\r\n  provincial museums. It was founded in 1825 by Fabre, who returned\r\n  to his native town after a stay of forty years in Italy, and\r\n  brought with him a fine collection of pictures, some of which\r\n  came to him from Alfieri, several works of art and a valuable\r\n  library, which he bequeathed to the town of Montpellier on his\r\n  death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bordeaux, April 10, 1842._--We came on here from Toulouse without\r\nstopping. The weather was better but a bitter wind succeeded the rain,\r\nand I am now taking care of myself by the fire while the others\r\nexplore the town. I have repeatedly visited the south of France and\r\ncan now afford to take my travelling duties easily. To-day we shall\r\nstart again, and the day after to-morrow, if God wills, we shall sleep\r\nat Rochecotte. I am longing to be at rest in my own dear home.\r\n\r\nLetters from Berlin say that Bülow is really to succeed Maltzan. He\r\nowes his triumph to the fact that he is the opposite of Kanitz.\r\nMaltzan is in a sanatorium at Charlottenberg.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven has fallen a victim to influenza: M. Guizot does not\r\nleave her bedside; both are absolute devotees to music. M. Guizot will\r\ntalk of nothing else and professes inability to sleep after visiting\r\nthe opera. He is the subject of much ridicule in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe military manœuvres this summer will extend from Alsace to\r\nChampagne. Such towns as Châlons, Vitry, &c., will be attacked. The\r\nDuc d'Orléans will lead the forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 13, 1842._--At last I am at home again!\r\n\r\nAt Bordeaux while we were at lunch I had an unexpected call from the\r\nAbbé Genoude. I have often met him on different occasions, but never\r\nin my own house. He was staying in the same hotel, had just been\r\npreaching, and so paid me this unexpected attention. He is a clever\r\nand even an agreeable man, and is anxious to be gracious and\r\ninsinuating. I was extremely polite, as he is not a good subject for\r\nrebuffs, but I went no further. As he went out he drew Charles de\r\nTalleyrand aside; he often used to see his mother in times past, and\r\ntold him that his newspaper was entirely at my orders[58] if at any\r\ntime I wished to insert anything. This is very strange and very\r\ncharacteristic of the age.\r\n\r\n  [58] The Abbé Genoude was manager of the _Gazette de France_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 16, 1842._--I have a letter from Toulouse from the\r\nCastellanes. They are waiting until the sea will allow them to cross\r\nto Corsica; however, if the weather does not moderate in two days they\r\nintend to go to Perpignan by land. I hope I shall find that they have\r\nexecuted this latter idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 17, 1842._--The Castellanes have decided for\r\nCorsica[59].\r\n\r\n  [59] The sight of the Corsican coast and the reading of Mérimée's\r\n  novel, _Colomba_, which had just appeared in the _Revue des Deux\r\n  Mondes_, stirred the enterprising character of the Marquis de\r\n  Castellane to anxiety to make this journey, which he carried out\r\n  with his family, and the excursion, which was somewhat\r\n  adventurous at that time, lasted nearly two weeks. On his return\r\n  to France he went to Perpignan, where the commandant was his\r\n  father, the Comte de Castellane, who had been appointed\r\n  Lieutenant-General after his return from the siege of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nSainte-Aulaire writes to me from London as follows: \"I have not left\r\nmy most troublesome task to the end of my labours: the failure to\r\nratify the treaty, the controversy concerning Algiers, and more than\r\nall the Anglophobia which our press maintains and proclaims, has made\r\nmy political position somewhat difficult. Beneath all this friction,\r\nhowever, there is a desire and a necessity upon either side to avoid a\r\nbreach. Upon this I am attempting to work and it will eventually have\r\nits effect. I am very kindly treated by society. The Court is cold but\r\npolite.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Salvandy writes from Paris; \"Politics are pervaded by a cold\r\nand morose spirit. M. Guizot's influence is now predominant. Questions\r\nconcerning the right of visitation are causing him much trouble and\r\nperplexity. The King is very busy with the Spanish question and that\r\nof marriage; the mission of M. Pageot is bearing fruit; the vetos\r\nwhich I have advised and secured have obviated resolutions which would\r\nhave been disgraceful and dangerous. Only a Bourbon will reign over\r\nSpain. Meanwhile M. Molé is turning to literature: on Thursday he will\r\nintroduce M. de Tocqueville to the French Academy; if fortune favours\r\nhim, this will be an event, for he is gaining ground and strengthening\r\nhis position by absence and retirement. Of the three rivals, Thiers\r\nloses ground whether he is in action or repose: M. Guizot is likely to\r\nlose by action what he gains by speech; M. Molé is strengthening his\r\nposition by inaction and silence after improving it in the struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 21, 1842._--There is to be an entertainment to-day\r\nat the Tuileries. _Polyeucte_ and _Richard Cœur de Lion_ will be\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is to take a seat in the Academy this morning for the\r\nreception of M. de Tocqueville by M. Molé; these formalities are\r\nbecoming quite fashionable.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in Paris is rising against England and shows some\r\nexasperation concerning the right of visitation. We are assured that\r\nthe electors will require from the deputies undertakings in their\r\nmanifestoes not to yield upon this point. Madame de Lieven, who is\r\ngenerally optimistic, is said to be much depressed and to be repeating\r\nthat things are going wrong. At London the one topic is a fancy dress\r\nball for May 12 which has thrown the ladies into great excitement;\r\nthey are sending to Paris for pictures and models.\r\n\r\nPauline writes to me from Ajaccio that she is very pleased with her\r\nexpedition and she has already forgotten the thirty-six hours'\r\nseasickness and is on her way to Sardinia with her husband. This news\r\narouses considerable misgivings in my mind, but her energy shows that\r\nshe is strong again and at any rate it keeps her away from the cold of\r\nAuvergne; moreover, if she is interested and happy what more can be\r\nwished?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 22, 1842._--Barante writes on the evening before\r\nthe session of the Academy, to which I have referred: \"The session\r\nwill be very fine: both speeches are quite remarkable; it will be a\r\ngrave but courteous tournament on the questions of the Revolution, the\r\nEmpire and the Democracy. M. Royer-Collard is delighted by the\r\nprospect; public opinion is quite eager and the Academy pleased to\r\nfind itself so fashionable. I fear that when I introduce M. Ballanche\r\nnext week I shall not come off so well, for the work of the subject of\r\nmy speech obliges me to give a philosophical address which is perhaps\r\na little too solemn both for the occasion and the audience.\r\n\r\n\"Politics are entirely preoccupied by questions of railway\r\nconstruction, and how the deputies will disentangle these matters I do\r\nnot know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 24, 1842._--My letters from Paris and the\r\nnewspapers are full of the speeches of M. Molé and of M. de\r\nTocqueville: they agree in saying that the former was quite successful\r\nand the latter extremely wearisome; what I have read myself in the\r\n_Journal des Débats_ leaves me with the same impression.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers report the death of Marshals Moncey and Clausel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 25, 1842._--So far as I can hear the methods of\r\namusement adopted by young ladies of the present day are quite\r\nunparalleled; the clique known as the _lionnes_ devise forms of\r\nentertainment worthy of the Regency. On this question I remember the\r\nanswer of M. de Talleyrand to a young lady who replied somewhat rudely\r\nthat during his youth people were just as bad; \"that may be,\" said M.\r\nde Talleyrand, \"but not in the same way.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Mollien sends me an account of the entertainment at the\r\nTuileries. She says that the room when every one had taken their\r\nplaces was a fine sight, but that order was preceded by a period of\r\nutter chaos. The authorities had resolved that everybody should make\r\ntheir way to the drawing-room and follow the Royal Family. The result\r\nwas that the last princess was followed by a general rush of all the\r\nladies, without any respect for rank or position: the crowd grew\r\ndenser as it advanced, and the rush degenerated into a battle; Madame\r\nde Toreno lost her mantilla, and this part of the proceedings was\r\nperfection of its kind. The dramatic performance was dull: although\r\nthe King set the example by applauding, he was not imitated; a want of\r\nharmony between the audience and the stage was obvious. M. Thiers went\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\nParis is raised to universal enthusiasm by a portrait of the Duc\r\nd'Orléans which Ingres had just painted and which is said to be\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 17, 1842._--The castle of Coblentz is being rebuilt\r\nas a royal residence: eight hundred workmen are now occupied in making\r\nit habitable for next autumn, as the King of Prussia proposes to spend\r\nSeptember and October there.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of M. Royer-Collard's opinion of the session\r\nof the Academy: \"M. Molé carried off the honours and overshadowed M.\r\nde Tocqueville, in my opinion, unjustly. I had read the speeches and\r\nwas keenly interested by M. de Tocqueville's, although I could foresee\r\nthat it would not rouse the sympathies of the audience. Elevation of\r\nthought, some admirable passages and fine ideas, did not\r\ncounterbalance the accuracy of the criticism. I then learnt that the\r\nEmperor and the Empire have a greater influence over men's minds than\r\nI was aware. M. Molé had realised the fact more clearly than myself\r\nand had turned it to excellent account: to considerable talent and an\r\ninfinite power of dissimulation he adds a sprightliness of delivery\r\nwhich will never be surpassed. The laudation of the Empire and the\r\nblackening of the democracy were the vengeance which he took upon the\r\nsuperior speech of M. de Tocqueville.\" M. Royer-Collard has announced\r\nthat he will no longer come forward as a candidate for election;\r\nprobably one of his nephews will take his place in the next Chamber.\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from Madame de Lieven's letter; as always, I give\r\nit word for word: \"There is very little prospect of seeing Pahlen back\r\nat Paris. People think that Gourieff will possibly be sent: he is a\r\nclever man and immensely rich; his wife is still pretty and inclined\r\nto flirtation, so these qualities will suit Paris very well. You will\r\nbe sorry to hear of the misfortune which overtook M. Humann this\r\nmorning; he has just had an apoplectic stroke and there is no hope of\r\nhis recovery. You used to see him often at Baden as I sometimes did,\r\nand both of us liked him. He was a figure of some importance, and it\r\nwill be difficult to find any one to take his place. Queen Victoria is\r\nwholly occupied with her fancy dress ball: she will appear as Queen\r\nPhilippa and insists that her Court should wear costumes of that age;\r\nLord Jersey is obliged to agree, much to his consternation. His\r\nmarried daughter has arrived at Vienna[60] and Prince Paul Esterhazy\r\nwishes to go to London in order to prevent Lady Jersey from following\r\nher daughter. It is even said that he wishes to retain his post, but\r\nMetternich asserts that the ambassador does not reside at Vienna. Paul\r\nMedem is in high favour with the Metternich household. Arnim is going\r\naway on leave and Bernstorff will take his place meanwhile. I am\r\nastonished that Bülow should have sent him here; I have an idea that\r\nBülow will endeavour to be a very interfering Minister. Queen\r\nIsabella's marriage occupies the attention of every Cabinet, including\r\nthat of Vienna, but no one knows what the end of the affair will be.\"\r\n\r\n  [60] On February 8, 1842, Prince Nicolas Esterhazy had married\r\n  Lady Sarah Villiers, daughter of Lord and Lady Jersey.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear of M. Humann's death: he was kind and obliging, and\r\nwas a man of original and distinguished talent; only a week ago he\r\nspoke very kindly of me to the Duchesse d'Albuféra, and a kind\r\ncharacter will always be regretted. The _Journal des Débats_ also\r\nreports the death of Bertin de Veaux. I feel it to be sad news, though\r\nhe had fallen out of our society for some time. He had a remarkable\r\nmind and was very good-hearted; he remained most affectionate to\r\nmyself and to the memory of M. de Talleyrand. For twenty years he had\r\nenjoyed our intimacy, shared our family habits and our confidence; and\r\nthus the ranks are thinned and one's loneliness grows apace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, April 28, 1842._--The Cabinet has wisely completed its\r\nnumbers without delay[61] and has forced M. Lacave Laplagne to take\r\nthe vacancy on the refusal of M. Passy, but the loss of M. Humann is\r\nnone the less real and the perplexity of the Ministry has\r\ncorrespondingly increased. Yesterday's newspaper relates a somewhat\r\namusing remark by Marshal Soult, who said when he heard of several\r\ndeaths during the last week, \"Indeed! Apparently they are beating the\r\nroll-call in the next world.\"\r\n\r\n  [61] By filling the place of M. Humann.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 2, 1842._--I have heard from the Castellanes from\r\nBonifacio at the moment when they were about to cross to Sardinia.\r\nThis unusual expedition, thank Heaven, has been a great success. They\r\nshould now be on their way from Toulon to Perpignan. I shall be glad\r\nto hear that they have returned to the Continent, if only because I\r\nshall have news of them more constantly and more regularly.\r\n\r\nThe successful confinement of the Duchesse de Nemours and the birth of\r\nthe Comte d'Eu has naturally caused much delight among the Royal\r\nFamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 5, 1842._--I have heard from Pauline from Toulon; she\r\ngives no details, as she was disembarking, but I know that she is on\r\ndry land and am relieved.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Orléans wished to hear the _Abélard_ of M. de Rémusat and\r\nspent three evenings at the house of Madame Récamier for that purpose.\r\nA dozen members of the Opposition were also there, including M. and\r\nMadame Thiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 6, 1842._--The Castellanes are now at Perpignan and\r\nare delighted with their tour in Corsica and Sardinia. Pauline rode on\r\nhorseback with a dagger in her waist-belt: she slept in the house of\r\nthe bandits and supped with Orso della Robbia, the hero of\r\nColomba;[62] she took shelter beneath the rock where the two gunshots\r\nwere fired and accepted, as a token of admiration, a dagger stained\r\nwith blood shed in the vendetta. The best part of it is that she had\r\nthe strength to go through these wanderings, that she is perfectly\r\nhappy and interested, that her husband is delighted with the\r\naccomplishment of so original an enterprise, while their little Marie\r\nis as healthy and cheerful as ever.\r\n\r\n  [62] _Colomba_ is a striking picture of a Corsican vendetta,\r\n  which has remained a famous and popular book. Mérimée first\r\n  published it in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, where it appeared\r\n  during the winter of 1842.\r\n\r\nThe Carlist party is dividing more and more. The Duc de Noailles is at\r\nthe head of the moderate faction, which grows stronger. Berryer\r\nremains at the head of the other, which is little more than a group,\r\nand is steadily drifting towards the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 10, 1842._--I have had good news from the\r\nCastellanes. I miss them greatly. The pleasant company of Pauline, the\r\ninfinite resource of Henri's conversation and the pretty ways of\r\nMarie, are a great help to me: I can trust myself to them and never\r\nfeel tired, and in their society I can unbend; they have become quite\r\nnecessary to me; they form part of all my projects and plans for the\r\nfuture, and I cannot conceive my old age separated from them. I\r\nflatter myself that I too have a real part in their life. Yesterday I\r\nhad a charming letter from Henri, full of confidence and tenderness,\r\nsaying what I was to them and to himself in particular. As soon as his\r\neccentricities have been forgotten, his good qualities become a real\r\ntie of affection; he is entirely upright, loyal and sincere, of high\r\nmoral dignity and perfect nobility of heart. Louis, my son, is also a\r\npleasant companion and perfectly reliable; Alexandre has his good\r\npoints, but his position embitters his character and destroys the\r\nequability of his temper. I am sometimes very sorry for him, as\r\nfinancial reasons do not allow him to take the position he would\r\nprefer. He is fond of his children, for which I do him full justice: I\r\nalso am fond of his granddaughter, who is sweet and pretty, and I grow\r\nsad at the thought of what her future may be. At one time I was able\r\nto do without children quite easily, but now I am entirely changed,\r\nand I feel that something is really wanting when one or more of these\r\nlittle people are not about me. I can give them my time with real\r\nearnest and feel greatly drawn to these weak little beings for whom\r\nProvidence may have such great and strange destinies in store. It is\r\nstrange how age changes one's character, and it is a great blessing\r\ngranted by Providence which thus enables us to avoid many a thorn in\r\nour paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 11, 1842._--Newspapers yesterday told us of the\r\ndreadful accident that happened on the railway on the left bank from\r\nVersailles to Paris: the details are appalling. _Galignani_ gives them\r\nin full, though the exact number or the names of the dead are not yet\r\nknown. The bodies, especially those which suffered from fire, are so\r\ndisfigured as to make identification impossible. Since the railways\r\nwere opened, this is the greatest, the most complicated and dreadful\r\naccident which has occurred. I think the damages should be enormous;\r\nthe authorities will then be more careful, for accidents only happen\r\nfrom want of precaution and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 15, 1842. (Whit Sunday.)_--M. de Barante arrived\r\nyesterday at the end of the morning, pleasant, kind and affectionate\r\nas ever. The people he found here are something of an obstacle to\r\nconversation. He told me no news of any importance and his own future\r\nremains very uncertain. If the health of M. de La Tour Maubourg\r\nremains as deplorable as it is, he will be obliged to retire and\r\nBarante will then go to Rome. The question of St. Petersburg may\r\nremain open for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe only topic of conversation at Paris is the lavish magnificence of\r\nMr. Hope's residence and the entertainments given there. They are said\r\nto equal nothing less than the drawing-rooms of Versailles under Louis\r\nXIV.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] William Hope, a Dutch financier of English origin,\r\n  son-in-law of General Rapp and the owner of a vast fortune,\r\n  settled in Paris in a house in the rue Neuve des Mathurins, which\r\n  became a social centre. When this house became too small for his\r\n  numerous entertainments, Mr. Hope built the large residence at\r\n  No. 57 Rue Saint Dominique, which was bought after his death\r\n  by Baron Seillière. He bequeathed it to his daughter, who\r\n  became Princesse de Sagan by her marriage with Boson de\r\n  Talleyrand-Perigord, Prince de Sagan and grandson of the Duchesse\r\n  de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 16, 1842._--Yesterday as I was driving to mass at the\r\nparish church, the coachman insisted upon taking a wrong turning\r\nthrough the woods in spite of my remonstrances. He upset the carriage\r\nand broke his right leg. Madame de Sainte-Aldegonde and myself were\r\nsitting at the back of the carriage, Madame de Dino and M. de Barante\r\nin front, while Jacques was on the seat behind. He jumped in time and\r\nsuffered no harm: Barante and my daughter-in-law were also unscathed;\r\nas I was sitting on the side towards which the carriage overturned,\r\nMadame de Sainte-Aldegonde fell upon me and I was thus crushed by my\r\nneighbour and the hood of the carriage. We were rescued by some people\r\nwho were going to mass. Madame de Sainte-Aldegonde wrenched the\r\nmuscles of her neck in trying to hold herself back; but the only real\r\nsubject for pity was the coachman. The rest of the day was spent in\r\nrecovering from the shock of this event and in the various little\r\ncares necessitated by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 17, 1842._--I am still shaken by the fall of the day\r\nbefore yesterday and feel some pain from the bruises which were caused\r\nby it. It will be several days before the effects of this accident\r\nhave entirely worn off. The coachman is going on as well as can be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nYesterday I spent almost the whole of the morning sitting in the open\r\nair in charming weather. There is no news of any kind, nor did\r\nanything happen of the least interest during the day. Barante's\r\ninteresting and charming conversation is a great resource for me\r\nduring the few days that he is spending here. It is a long time since\r\nsuch a piece of good luck fell to my share. I am enjoying it\r\ninfinitely, and with the more satisfaction because my belief in him is\r\nas complete as my pleasure is real. He is upright, trustworthy and\r\nkind to such an extent that he can be entirely relied upon. He is a\r\ndeeply pious character and his intellect is neither exhausted nor\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 30, 1842._--Yesterday we went to the parish church\r\nfor the Fête Dieu. We followed the procession in a blazing sun to the\r\nresting-place where the little Clémentine de Dino had been carried.\r\nThe priest placed the holy sacrament upon her head; this is said to\r\nbring children good luck. The little girl, who is very sweet and\r\npretty, behaved herself delightfully. She was in the arms of her\r\nnurse, a pretty woman on her knees, in the midst of the people, the\r\nincense, the flowers and the beauties of nature, and the spectacle was\r\ndelightful; it affected me to tears and I earnestly prayed from my\r\ngrandmother's heart that the little girl might become a good and\r\nhonourable Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 1, 1842._--The Duc d'Orléans proposes to make a long\r\ntour of military inspection as a preliminary to the manœuvres. It is\r\nsaid that he will have an interview with the King of the Low Countries\r\nat Luxemburg. Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar is coming to Paris, and Duke\r\nGustavus of Mecklenburg, the other uncle of the Duchesse d'Orléans, is\r\nalready there. The Emperor of Brazil is to marry the last sister of\r\nthe King of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry has experienced some checks in the discussion upon the\r\nbudget; rumours are spreading that it may suffer a defeat during the\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nLord Cowley has invited the Princes to be present at a ball to be\r\ngiven on the 24th, Queen Victoria's birthday; they have declined.\r\nEngland thus appears not to be in the fashion. I am astonished that\r\nthe Prince de Joinville and the Duc d'Aumale should choose this moment\r\nfor a journey to England.\r\n\r\nThe _Charivari_ contains two articles which are said to libel Madame\r\nde Lieven and M. Guizot; one is called \"Two Pigeons,\" the other \"A\r\nDrive in a Pony Chaise by Moonlight.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Christina has ostensibly hired Malmaison as a summer residence.\r\nThe truth seems to be that she has bought it through a third person.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Polignac is at Paris for the marriage of his son with\r\nMlle. de Crillon, and walks about the streets without arousing the\r\nsmallest curiosity. The Legitimists who have a violent grudge against\r\nhim, decline to notice him.\r\n\r\nI hear from Nice that the Grand Duchess Stephanie, when her daughter\r\nwas cured of the rosalie, felt some premonitory symptoms of the same\r\nmalady which she neglected, with her habitual imprudence, and went for\r\na sail against her doctor's advice. The vessel was delayed and she\r\nreturned home very ill. On the 25th her condition was serious, and the\r\ndoctor of Nice had called in other doctors from Marseilles for a\r\nconsultation. I am sorry to hear it, for I feel deeply attached to the\r\nGrand Duchess.\r\n\r\nI have good news from Pauline. My son-in-law paid a visit by himself\r\nto Madame Adélaïde and was warmly welcomed. He was thrown from his\r\nhorse and returned home quite lame.[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] The Marquis de Castellane never recovered from this\r\n  accident. He endured constant suffering with the greatest courage\r\n  for five years and died in 1847 as a consequence of this fall,\r\n  which the surgery of that day was unable to cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 4, 1842._--Our young princes who proposed to travel\r\nto England have postponed their departure indefinitely. Under existing\r\ncircumstances the journey would have been inopportune.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 7, 1842._--I have a very sad letter from Pauline.\r\nHer husband returned from Randan quite ill, either in consequence of\r\nthe fall from his horse or owing to an attack of rheumatic fever.\r\nWhatever the cause may be, the results are serious. He is feverish and\r\ndelirious, has attacks of nervous trouble, terrible pain and fainting\r\nfits. All this happened in the middle of the mountains and it was\r\nnecessary to carry him home on a stretcher with his wife riding beside\r\nhim. Such are the perils of life in the country. There is no doctor in\r\nthe neighbourhood. I do not like this mode of life which is unsuited\r\nto Pauline's delicate health. Love and duty make everything beautiful\r\nin her eyes, but when the moment of trial comes, she feels herself\r\nvery lonely in the midst of a wild country. Her husband was better\r\nwhen she despatched her letter. I am very anxious to hear later news.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 11, 1842._--I hear from Paris that Barante will\r\ncertainly not return to St. Petersburg, because no Ambassador will be\r\nsent. The post will be filled by an ordinary Minister; I have not\r\nheard who will be chosen. Immediately after the elections there will\r\nbe a short session of the Chambers for a fortnight during the month of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 14, 1842._--The newspapers say that M. Dupanloup has\r\ndelivered a strikingly successful course of lectures on pulpit oratory\r\nat the Sarbonne. We shall also see the course suddenly terminated; it\r\nhas given rise to much talk at Paris. M. Royer-Collard tells me that\r\nhe thinks the Abbé Dupanloup was wrong to quote Voltaire in his\r\nlectures, though we may imagine how the quotation was made. He reminds\r\nme that under the Restoration the clergy sent Voltaire through\r\neighteen editions by their attacks. At present he is hardly read, and\r\ntherefore should not be quoted. The Abbé himself wrote to tell the\r\nDean of the Faculty that to avoid any further outbreaks he would bring\r\nhis course of lectures to an end. The Dean communicated the letter to\r\nthe Minister of Education, who took the Abbé at his word without\r\nproposing any preventive measures to avoid the scandal which, as\r\nusual, was caused by a very small and very noisy minority.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven tells me of the death of Matusiewicz, but gives no\r\ndetails. The poor Conference of London is rapidly disappearing: M. de\r\nTalleyrand, the Prince de Lieven, and now Matusiewicz. The Princess\r\nalso tells me that poverty in England is extreme. The customs union of\r\nGermany has greatly damaged English commerce. Sir Robert Peel is\r\nextremely powerful, and seems likely to remain in office; every one\r\nelse is overshadowed by him. Queen Victoria showed much courage and\r\ngood sense in her last adventure. Her would-be assassin will not be\r\nexecuted, as the bullet has not been found.[65]\r\n\r\n  [65] About the beginning of June 1842 an attempt was made to\r\n  assassinate the Queen of England at almost the same place and in\r\n  almost the same manner as in 1840.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot is, as usual, delighted with the session which has just come\r\nto an end, and with the prospect of the coming elections. Barante is\r\npleasantly employed at London, and writes very nice letters. He was\r\nvery kindly received at Windsor: he tells me that he did not find Lady\r\nHolland greatly changed, though he has not seen her for fifteen years;\r\nher rigid and imperious expression apparently remains unaltered. At\r\nthe mention of her husband's name her eyes fill with tears, which does\r\nnot suit her general expression; she shows such general want of\r\namiability that her grief in this respect has become almost a subject\r\nof jest in society. Lady Clanricarde is very bitter against Russia.\r\nLord Stuart has returned suffering from apoplexy, and his brain is\r\nsaid to have been slightly affected; it is not likely that he will\r\nreturn to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nRegarding the general attitude of England to France, Barante writes as\r\nfollows: \"From a political point of view, I think there is a real\r\ndesire to live upon good terms with us, and the manifestations of our\r\nChambers and our newspapers have aroused regret and uneasiness. Every\r\none knows that these were caused by ill-temper, and not by any desire\r\nfor war; but if these demonstrations and opinions should continue to\r\nincrease, it is impossible to foresee the result.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 16, 1842._--M. and Madame de La Rochejaquelein, my\r\nneighbours from Ussé,[66] came to spend part of the day here\r\nyesterday. She has been very pretty and pleasant, and retains both of\r\nthese qualities. Her husband is a kind of wild huntsman from the\r\nVendée who has been wounded in the handsomest possible fashion; the\r\nscar crosses the whole of his face, but does not disfigure it.\r\n\r\n  [66] Ussé, situated upon a hill opposite Rochecotte upon which it\r\n  looks, was occupied in 1842 by the Comtesse de La Rochejaquelein,\r\n  who was the widow of the Prince de Talmont and had married for\r\n  the second time, her husband being the youngest brother of the\r\n  hero of _la Vendée_. The castle of Ussé was added to at different\r\n  times, as is obvious from the picturesque originality of the\r\n  building. The work was begun by Jacques d'Epinay, Chamberlain\r\n  under Louis XI. and Charles VIII., in 1415 that he might be\r\n  nearer to the Court. Ussé afterwards passed to the family of\r\n  Bennin de Valentinay, one member of which married the eldest\r\n  daughter of the Marshal of Vauban. He often visited the place,\r\n  and to him are attributed the arrangement of the terraces and the\r\n  building of the bastion which bears his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 17, 1842._--When I came home after returning Madame\r\nde La Rochejaquelein's call, I found a letter from Pauline. After\r\nreading it I resolved to start at once to help the poor child. As it\r\nis a toilsome journey, difficult and almost dangerous through the\r\nmountains, and as I shall probably be obliged to travel on horseback\r\nfor the last day, while the presence of a man may be useful to\r\nPauline, I resolved to accept the offer of the good Vestier, who knows\r\nthe country, and who is devoted to the Castellanes. They are also fond\r\nof him, and he will accompany me. He will sit on the box with Jacques,\r\nand his presence will be a great support. I shall go through without\r\nstopping; I am leaving all my servants here, and the house will go on\r\nas if I were not absent. It is a hard trial. God is great. Let us bow\r\nthe head and adore, and remember that happiness is not to be found in\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aubijou, June 22, 1842._--I left Rochecotte on the 18th in the\r\nmorning. As I took no luggage in my carriage, had four horses on level\r\nground, six in the mountains, and was preceded by a courier, I did not\r\nstop, and arrived here in forty-eight hours, which is wonderfully\r\nrapid travelling. I found my son-in-law terribly changed. The\r\ncondition of his thigh, which was the primary cause of his illness,\r\nhas improved, and gives no cause for alarm, but the nervous shock\r\nwhich it has produced causes me great anxiety. He is better, but by no\r\nmeans convalescent yet. I shall not return home until he reaches that\r\nstage, and as soon as he can be moved he will go to take the waters at\r\nNéris. Pauline is not ill, but she is growing very tired by reason of\r\nconstant agitation and anxiety; she has shown great devotion. The\r\npresence of Vestier, who was a real support to me in these wild\r\ndistricts, greatly pleases my son-in-law. I thank Providence that he\r\nwas so kind as to think of coming with me, for he is by far the most\r\nacceptable visitor to the invalid.\r\n\r\nThe roads here are frightful; the country for the last three leagues\r\nis not picturesque, but bare, dismal, and wild; the climate is\r\ndisagreeable, and the temporary house in which we are encamped amid\r\ndisorder is disgusting, especially for an invalid. It is a wooden\r\nhouse, swarming with fleas and mice; neither windows nor doors will\r\nshut, so that draughts have full play, and the noise is horrible. We\r\nare six leagues from a chemist's shop, and there is nothing to be had;\r\nI am horrified that they should think of building in such a country.\r\nEverything has to be made, even the level space of ground upon which\r\nto build the house. It will not be finished for years, but the\r\nCastellanes hope they may be able to live in a quarter of it next\r\nyear!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aubijou, June 23, 1842._--My son-in-law is much easier. The weather\r\nis abominable, and yesterday it thundered and rained in torrents the\r\nwhole day; it is a horrible country, and I am not over-estimating its\r\ndeficiencies, and am quite in despair at the idea of building a house\r\nhere. It is quite possible to live here for nothing if people will\r\nlive as the natives do, but any attempt to introduce civilisation is\r\nvery expensive, and I fear my son-in-law will regret his attempt to\r\ntake root here, for reasons both of health and money. No one could be\r\nmore reasonable or gentle than Pauline, or show greater resignation\r\nand devotion; her conduct is admirable throughout this illness and the\r\ninfinite number of troubles and vexations it involves; during all\r\nthese she has shown both spirit and good sense, and is generally held\r\nin the highest esteem. All their servants are quite devoted to them.\r\nHere we are half enveloped in the clouds; the inhabitants are very\r\nuncivilised; in September they bake a six months' supply of bread;\r\nin October they shut themselves up with their cattle and\r\nintercommunication ceases; they then remain buried in the snow, which\r\nsometimes does not melt even in the month of May. Some parts of\r\nAuvergne are very picturesque, but not on this side; the mountains are\r\ntoo round and their summits too flat and bare; there is no fine\r\nexpanse of water, and the whole outlook is most monotonous. The ruins\r\nof the old castle of Aubijou alone give a little character to the\r\ncountryside; these have been wisely covered with climbing plants. My\r\nson-in-law is also planting on a large scale to improve the\r\nsurroundings of the house and the view from the windows, but it will\r\nbe a long time before his plantations grow; meanwhile the general\r\naspect is dismal and I think the climate is very trying.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aubijou, June 24, 1842._--My son-in-law had refused every proposal to\r\nmove him, but after a very restless night he suddenly declared that he\r\nwould stay here no longer. We immediately fell in with his desire for\r\nflight, ordered horses and packed our things, but we cannot start\r\nuntil to-morrow. Henri will travel lying down, and by very short\r\nstages. The doctors declare that to stay here would be the worst\r\npossible thing for him, and of this I am firmly convinced. It is a\r\nmost fatal spot in which to be ill. He will rest for a few days at\r\nClermont and then go to take the waters at Néris which have been\r\nprescribed, and are, I think, the best in the world for nervous\r\nrheumatism. I shall travel for some distance in company with them to\r\nsee how he bears the journey, and will then go in advance of them. I\r\nshall turn aside at Néris to find them a good lodging, and then\r\nproceed to Rochecotte, where I shall be very glad to return, for I am\r\ndreadfully tired and I feel that if I were to stay longer here I\r\nshould fall ill. My poor daughter is worn out; at any rate, both at\r\nClermont and Néris she will be in a civilised country, within reach of\r\nhelp and away from the terrible loneliness in which she lives here.\r\n\r\nTo please my son-in-law I made a long and curious excursion yesterday\r\nin the valley overlooked by his new buildings. I found some fine\r\npieces of water and splendid trees, but there is no means of approach\r\nand paths must be cut with an axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Longueplaine, near Tours, June 29, 1842. At the house of M. de la\r\nBesnardière._--We left Aubijou on the morning of the 25th. It was not\r\nan easy journey. My son-in-law was laid upon a mattress in their large\r\ntravelling carriage, which is fortunately very roomy. Then came the\r\nquestion of leaving the mountains. Apart from the carriage of the\r\nCastellanes, which contained them with their doctor, their\r\nchambermaid, their child, and two lacqueys on the box, there was my\r\ncarriage, with myself, a chambermaid, M. Vestier, and Jacques on the\r\nbox; then came a little tilbury, drawn by Corsican horses, in which\r\nwere the cook and an Auvergne jockey. On horseback was the estate\r\nagent, a keeper, and a negro, whom my son-in-law had brought back\r\nfrom the south and who is called Zéphir, blowing a horn. It was a\r\nstrange spectacle, and resembled a scene from the _Roman comique_. The\r\nroad, however, was by no means cheerful, with its rocks, its\r\nprecipices, and its dangers, but by going gently and holding in the\r\ncarriages, we came through without mishap. I will admit, to my shame,\r\nthat I so far yielded to my fears as to leave my large carriage and\r\ntake the cook's place in the tilbury, which proceeded with less\r\ndanger, as it was lighter and narrower. Night came upon us before we\r\nhad left the region of precipices, and my cowardice was then displayed\r\nin the most disgraceful manner and I wept. The Castellanes spent the\r\nnight at Massiac. I left them there, feeling content with the effect\r\nof the open air upon Henri's nerves. I proceeded in advance, and\r\nreached Clermont on the morning of the 26th. I saw the doctor who had\r\nalready been called in to Henri, and gave him an account of the\r\ninvalid's progress. After announcing that he would arrive the same\r\nevening, I went a few leagues further from the town and visited\r\nRandan. I was very curious to see it, and I also knew that my visit\r\nwould be a compliment to Madame Adélaïde. I admit that I was greatly\r\nundeceived: only three things justify the reputation of the place--the\r\nview, which is admirable, the fine old trees, and the kitchens and\r\nout-buildings, which, are, indeed, too handsome and entirely out of\r\nproportion to the rest of the establishment, which lacks distinction.\r\nA very poor avenue of poplar-trees, crossing a wretched village, leads\r\nto a paling of painted wood; through a gate one enters a kind of\r\nquincunx, at the end of which another turn leads to the narrow\r\ncourtyards of the château. The entrance is very poor, though it would\r\nhave been easy to cut a great avenue through the woods leading\r\nstraight to the château. The château itself is built partly of brick,\r\nwith painted roofs, and partly of white stone abutting upon the old\r\npart of the building, and forming a dreadful contrast of styles. The\r\nrooms are low, the decorations heavy and mean, the furniture without\r\nstyle or harmony, neither simple nor magnificent, and the apotheosis\r\nof bad taste. The hall and the ante-chamber are extremely narrow and\r\ninconvenient; there are no artistic objects, the sculptures are\r\nplaster and the paintings, which chiefly consist of family portraits,\r\nare bad copies. In the salon, which is called the family room because\r\nthe whole of the present generation are there gathered, I was glad to\r\nsee the portrait of Madame de Genlis. Madame Adélaïde's room is very\r\nsmall and, in my opinion, very ugly. The corridors on the first floor\r\nare dark, narrow, and inconvenient. The library is in the principal\r\nreception-room, where there is also a billiard-table; I do not think\r\nthere were more than a thousand volumes. A wide terrace, which covers\r\nthe kitchens, leads from the castle to the chapel. The terrace, which\r\nis well-adorned with flowers, is a fine point of view, but an iron\r\ntrellis-work, which covers half of it, is so narrow and low that it is\r\nquite spoilt. The chapel is large, but in no particular style, and the\r\ndecorations within are ugly. There are some very poor modern windows,\r\na confessional-box, painted and coloured like a screen, holy water\r\nstoups of gilded cardboard, and, I repeat, a general want of dignity,\r\ngracefulness, and taste. The dining-room is the best preserved\r\napartment; it is vaulted and painted with frescoes in extremely varied\r\ncolours, and is too low. Some people praise it highly, but it is not\r\nto my taste.\r\n\r\nI returned to Clermont at the moment when the Castellanes were\r\narriving at the town and my son-in-law had borne the journey well. The\r\ndoctor said he would be able to start for Néris at the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours. I left them on the 27th, satisfied with the\r\npositive assurance that the doctor gave me, that there was no danger,\r\nthough convalescence would be a slow and painful process. I went to\r\nNéris to engage rooms for them, a necessary precaution as there were\r\nmany people in residence, and I had some trouble in finding a suitable\r\nhouse. The doctor at Néris whom I had known for a long time, is an\r\nexcellent and careful man and I gave him full information concerning\r\nthe case. I only stayed at Néris for dinner and to select rooms for\r\nthe Castellanes, and after spending the night in my carriage I arrived\r\nhere yesterday evening at the house of M. de la Besnardière. It has\r\ninvolved a detour of only two leagues and allowed me to pay a\r\nlong-standing debt. They were considerably vexed that I had not paid\r\nthem this visit earlier. The house is pretty, clean, convenient and\r\nalmost fashionable, and full of little comforts which aroused my\r\nastonishment. It was the sight of Rochecotte which induced him to put\r\nthis house in repair and for this purpose he employed Vestier, whose\r\nefforts were very successful. I shall lunch here, call at the\r\nPrefecture of Tours and reach my own house in time for dinner. I\r\ngreatly need rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, June 30, 1842._--I stopped for an hour at Tours yesterday\r\nto call on the d'Entraigues. Every one was busy with the elections. I\r\nfound all in good health except Alava, who had returned during my\r\nabsence and was so changed during these few weeks that I think his end\r\nmust be near.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 3, 1842._--The newspapers announce the death of M.\r\nde Sismondi. Notwithstanding his pedantry, he is a man to be\r\nregretted, a kind and very learned character.\r\n\r\nThe young people here are busy studying motets which are to be sung\r\nto-day in my chapel on the occasion of a solemn benediction which the\r\npriest will pronounce this evening at five o'clock. An association of\r\ngirls has been started in this parish which has existed for a long\r\ntime in neighbouring provinces, and will be called an association of\r\nthe Daughters of the Virgin. It is a secular organisation and no\r\nrenunciation of marriage is required. The members merely undertake to\r\navoid bad company, to live honourable lives, to repeat the little\r\noffice of the Virgin, to attend the sacraments regularly and to set a\r\ngood example. At church and in processions they are dressed in white\r\nwith blue sashes. I was asked to give them a banner and their blue\r\nsashes which I have done. They will be instituted to-day to the number\r\nof fifteen. As my chapel is dedicated to the Virgin and as a mark of\r\ngratitude for my gifts, they propose to go there in procession with\r\ntheir banner unfolded. For this occasion the Grand Vicars have allowed\r\nthe performance of a choral benediction. This is a great event in the\r\nparish. Fortunately the weather is very fine. Pauline would have been\r\nvery glad to be present and I regret her absence deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 4, 1842._--Yesterday's ceremony was most edifying,\r\nbright and picturesque. Fanny, Alexandre and their music master sang\r\nextremely well. The girls were in white and blue and the chapel was\r\ndecorated with flowers. There were at least five hundred people on the\r\nterrace to receive the blessing which was given from the altar which\r\nfaces the chapel door opening on the terrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 7, 1842._--I have a letter from the Princesse de\r\nLieven. She tells me that the Bishop of Orléans[67] has been appointed\r\nArchbishop of Tours and she adds from M. Guizot that I shall find this\r\nprelate very satisfactory. A letter from Pauline tells me that her\r\nhusband is rapidly recovering.\r\n\r\n  [67] Mgr. Morlot, born at Langres in 1795, and Bishop of Orléans\r\n  since 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 10, 1842._--M. de la Besnardière came yesterday to\r\nspend a few hours here in the interval between the formation of\r\ncommittees and a vote of the electoral college of Tours. This\r\ndepartment, which is generally so peaceful, has never been in such a\r\nferment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 11, 1842._--The great news of the district is that\r\nM. Crémieux, a Jewish lawyer, has been elected by a majority of\r\nthirty-five votes. M. Crémieux is a stranger to the district with\r\nwhich he has no connection. The result is really inexplicable unless\r\nit is due to his oratorical powers, for like a true lawyer he has\r\ntalked so many hours on end that he filled the country people with\r\nadmiration. If a similar result occurs at Loches, our department will\r\nbe represented entirely by the Left. The Ministry, which will not\r\nadmit its total neglect of the Prefect's requirements, will then blame\r\nM. d'Entraigues and perhaps we shall lose him, which would grieve me\r\ngreatly. Moreover, these elections were thought likely to strengthen\r\nthe Conservative reaction and if this expectation is falsified, the\r\noutlook will be extremely gloomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 12, 1842._--I have had a call from Dr. Orye and from\r\nM. de Quinemont. Both gave me a description of the disgraceful\r\nelectoral scenes at Chinon, where M. Crémieux was carried shoulder\r\nhigh by the scum of the populace, who were unfortunately joined by\r\nLegitimists from the left bank of the Loire, in which district they\r\nare very numerous. The country electors were also largely influenced\r\nby the fact that they heard M. Crémieux speak for three hours on end\r\nwithout blowing his nose, spitting, or coughing, which they thought\r\nmagnificent. I am very anxious to learn the general result of this\r\nreaction, which may have grave and serious consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 14, 1842._--Alava came back here yesterday, and is\r\nfull of election stories from Tours. Many disgraceful incidents took\r\nplace. According to the newspapers, however, it seems that upon the\r\ngeneral result of the elections the Ministry will have gained a few\r\nvotes, and it is much that they have lost none. I must confess that I\r\nam very anxious to learn the final figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 15, 1842._--M. de Chalais had just arrived yesterday\r\nwhen I was expecting the Prefect, but instead of him a courier rode up\r\nwhom he had sent to bring me the terrible news which has overwhelmed\r\nme, the news that the Duc d'Orléans was dead, in consequence of a fall\r\nfrom his carriage. I know no details except that he died at Neuilly on\r\nJuly 13, the day before yesterday, at half-past four in the afternoon.\r\nThe accident took place the same day at midday at Sablonville. My\r\nthoughts are entirely occupied with this sad event, both as a matter\r\nof personal loss and as a public disaster. How will a long Regency be\r\npossible in a country so disturbed as France now is? Personally, I\r\nhave to regret the friendship of which the young Prince had given me\r\nsuch honourable and flattering proofs. It is also a loss for my son\r\nValençay. I really do not know whether the Prince's wife and mother\r\nwill survive this terrible blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 16, 1842._--M. de Chalais went away yesterday at the\r\nend of the morning, and I accompanied him as far as Langeais. When I\r\nreturned I found the house full of neighbours who had come to learn\r\nthe details of this disastrous death. It seems to me more unfortunate\r\nand more likely to produce serious consequences at every moment. The\r\ndetails in the _Journal des Débats_ formed the only complete and\r\nofficial account. I am also told that passers-by saw the Prince stand\r\nup in his carriage and look in the front of him to see if the horse\r\nwhich had bolted would meet any obstacle upon the road. There was\r\nnothing in the way and the same spectators saw the Prince calmly\r\nresume his seat, then lean out of the carriage and look behind him, as\r\nthough to speak to the servant who was on the seat behind; he,\r\nhowever, had already jumped down, as the seat was empty. Probably the\r\nPrince thought that the servant had fallen and wishing with courageous\r\nkindness to help him, he then jumped from the carriage, for he did not\r\nmake his spring until he had seen that his servant was not in his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 18, 1842._--No one writes to me from Paris where I\r\nhave but few correspondents at this moment; moreover, everybody is\r\noverwhelmed by consternation, but the newspapers are interesting and I\r\nsearch with painful eagerness for every detail touching our poor\r\nPrince and his unhappy family.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see that each newspaper, according to its political\r\nopinions, classifies the newly elected deputies upon different\r\nprinciples. The _Journal des Débats_ announces a majority of\r\nseventy-three for the Ministry; others reduce the majority to three,\r\nand some even say that the Ministry is in a minority.\r\n\r\nI also see that the press is already beginning to discuss the\r\ndifferent forms of Regency, though the terms of the law in which the\r\nGovernment is preparing to deal with the question are not yet known.\r\nWhen the first shock has passed we shall see many sad results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 19, 1842._--Yesterday I received a heartrending\r\nletter from Madame Adélaïde. It is very good of her to have written so\r\nclearly. I had sent her a letter but did not expect any reply. M. de\r\nBoismilon, the secretary of the Duc d'Orléans, has also written a\r\nletter containing many details. No one as yet can think or speak of\r\nanything but the death of this unhappy young Prince.\r\n\r\nM. d'Entraigues arrived here to-day; he will leave me to-morrow, for\r\nat the present moment every official is anxious to be at his post. He\r\nis very despondent on many accounts. The radicals of Tours have\r\nalready given a banquet and did not scruple to express their delight\r\nat the death of the Duc d'Orléans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 21, 1842._--Every one is agreed in predicting the\r\nfall of the Ministry as likely to occur immediately and M. Molé's name\r\nis in every mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Council wished the Duc d'Orléans to be buried at Saint-Denis, but\r\nthe Queen has insisted upon Dreux. I think she is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 22, 1842._--I can think of nothing but the gloomy\r\npalace of Neuilly. The Queen is sublime; she spends days and nights in\r\nthe chapel on her knees by the coffin. The King's time is divided\r\nbetween business and mourning. The Duchesse d'Orléans derives strength\r\nfrom her undaunted Methodist principles. The will of the poor Prince\r\nis said to be an admirable document: it treats the question of the\r\nRegency in full and the solution is in favour of the Duc de Nemours.\r\nThe Duc d'Orléans had no very high opinion of his brother and he\r\ntherefore showed an entire preference for the male sex and the right\r\nof primogeniture. At the same time the Duc de Nemours should be given\r\nhis due: when the doctor Chomel met him and told him the details of an\r\nevent of which he only knew the terrible telegraphic summary, he\r\nfainted and could not be brought round for a long time. His grief does\r\nhim honour and is entirely justified by this dreadful loss; for the\r\nDuc d'Orléans whom I knew very well, was distinguished both as a\r\nPrince and as a man upon the whole, in spite of certain faults of mind\r\nand character. His good and striking qualities were numerous: for\r\ninstance he had a profound respect for the responsibility which had\r\nfallen to him; his clear insight had taught him the necessity of a\r\ndignified bearing and he would have sacrificed at no price what he had\r\ngained in this respect; his judgment, if somewhat restless, was broad,\r\nrapid and fruitful in result; his habits of mind were marked by a\r\ncertain depression, though he would never be discouraged; constantly\r\nthinking of the future, he was always preparing for it, though he had\r\nlittle real belief in it; his generosity was with him a point of\r\npride, as also was the certainty and loyalty of his friendship; though\r\nby no means an emotional character, his courtesy made people forget\r\nhis want of sensitiveness which was not a dominant feature in him and\r\nwas only visible upon rare occasions; he was most courteous to those\r\nin whom he recognised any outstanding quality; for such qualities he\r\nwas ever in search and deferred to them with his accustomed good\r\ntaste. His reign would have displayed many features which are now\r\nwanting; there would have been vigour, stimulus and enthusiasm. When\r\nonce engaged upon a task he would never have retreated: that, indeed,\r\nwould have been the great danger, but he would have learnt prudence by\r\nmeans of the circumspection which was already obvious in him, and\r\nthere was every reason to believe that notwithstanding his\r\nimpetuosity, he would have learnt upon the throne to resist rash\r\nimpulses. At the present moment every one seems to understand that\r\nwith the loss of this link in the royal chain we have lost the\r\nguarantee of our security, and that our heads and our property are\r\nworth less than they were before; so profound is this impression that\r\nthe Ministry hopes to find in it a means of continuing in office, but\r\nthis is not my opinion. When the first days of astonishment are over,\r\npolitical feeling will make its way once more into the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, and will pass votes in accordance with the trend of opinion\r\nwhich has been manifested in the elections. People are generally\r\nagreed that M. Molé's chances are good; M. Guizot and M. Thiers are\r\nout of the question for the moment.\r\n\r\nMy niece Fanny and her governess started for Paris yesterday where I\r\nshall follow them in a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 23, 1842._--I spent yesterday in making some\r\npreparations for departure. The King is described as looking very ill,\r\nwith his features contracted and his complexion ashen. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans has had the dead man's uniform, sword and scarf placed upon\r\nthe bier now lying in the chapel of Neuilly. When the King first saw\r\nthese emblems on the fifth day after the event, he burst into sobs so\r\nloud as to drown those of the mother and sisters. It is said that the\r\nQueen's grief almost deprived her of consciousness. The sorrow of the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans is gentler or as some say calmer. The Duc de\r\nNemours is said to be so upset as to be hardly recognisable. The\r\npainter Scheffer is painting a picture which will show the room in the\r\ninn where the terrible disaster of the 13th was concluded. The Queen\r\ncontinually says to any one she sees, \"Pray for him.\" Her despair is\r\ngreatly increased by the thought that her son died before he could\r\nfulfil his religious duties. Not a single carriage enters the court of\r\nNeuilly and everything there seems to be walled up as if in a tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 24, 1842._--My letters say that nothing was more\r\nmournful than the reception of the visits of condolence. The King\r\nsobbed as one who could not restrain himself. The political horizon is\r\nalready growing dark with clouds. I shall certainly start for Paris\r\nto-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, July 27, 1842._--I have already seen a large number of people:\r\nfirst of all Valençay and Fanny, as they were coming back from the\r\nroyal reception, where the King's sobs rent everybody's heart. Every\r\none is talking of the infinite grief of the Royal Family and the\r\nunpopularity of M. Guizot; however, M. Molé does not think he will be\r\noverthrown in the short session of the Chambers now impending.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, July 28, 1842._--Yesterday morning was a very painful time:\r\nmost of it I spent at Neuilly and stayed more than an hour with Madame\r\nAdélaïde who deeply touched me with her kindness. She treated me as\r\nthe one who regretted the poor Prince most profoundly apart from her\r\nown family. She took me into the little chapel which is almost\r\nentirely filled by the bier and is entered by very few people, to pray\r\nand sprinkle holy water. This mark of kindness is largely due to the\r\nfact that in the will of the dead Prince, very honourable reference is\r\nmade to myself, to judge from the words of his aunt, while a souvenir\r\nwhich he has left me is also mentioned. Madame gave me no other\r\ndetails because, as she said, the Duchesse d'Orléans wished to give me\r\nthem herself. I am to see both her and the King and Queen after the\r\nfuneral. The sadness at Neuilly is impossible to describe. It is a\r\nvast tomb and a visitor would think himself in a mausoleum. By the\r\nQueen's desire the psalms of the priests are continued day and night:\r\nthey can be heard in every part of the castle with terribly gloomy\r\neffect; every face is downcast and tear-stained.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home I found M. de Barante, the Duc de Noailles and M.\r\nde Salvandy who were waiting for me. I heard no news from them except\r\nthat M. Thiers, who wishes to secure his position and his favour with\r\nthe King, is exhorting the Left to a mild and moderate attitude. There\r\nis an official despatch from M. de Flahaut who says that in\r\nconsequence of his fall last year the Duc de Bordeaux is not only\r\npermanently lame but that an abscess has formed in his thigh which\r\nwill not allow him to go to Trieste for the sea bathing and that he\r\nhas countermanded the house which he had taken there. Berlin and\r\nVienna have displayed a very correct attitude on receiving the news of\r\nthe death of the Duc d'Orléans.\r\n\r\nI then had a long interview with poor Boismilon who is overwhelmed by\r\nthe death of his Prince. The evening before the accident the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, who was preparing for camp, said to his old German valet\r\nwho has never left him, \"My dear Holder, you are getting worn out;\r\ncome with me this time only and then I know a position where you will\r\nbe able to rest without leaving me; I will ask the King to appoint you\r\n_keeper of the vault of Dreux_.\" Such were the actual words, for\r\nBoismilon was there and heard them.\r\n\r\nSainte-Aulaire came to talk to me to-day. He has a great admiration\r\nfor England but regrets the bad relations subsisting between the two\r\nGovernments and says that ours is absolutely in the wrong. He says\r\nthat if things go on as they have done the Embassies of London and\r\nParis will be occupied only by Chargés d'Affaires.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles is wearing mourning and receiving letters at\r\nNeuilly on grounds of cousinship. He believes that the Duc de Poix has\r\nwritten to the King on the occasion of this sad event. The Legitimist\r\nparty is greatly shattered and disunited, and had it not been for the\r\ndeath of the Duc d'Orléans, which has shaken all confidence in the\r\nstability and permanence of the present state of things, most of the\r\nLegitimists would have rallied. As things are, unless the condition of\r\nthe Duc de Bordeaux becomes worse, and this seems to be possible, I\r\nsee little chance of an agreement, although the Legitimists do not\r\nfollow any definite system or direction. It is simply another element\r\nof anarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, July 30, 1842._--M. Royer-Collard came to see me yesterday. In\r\ncharacter I think him precisely what he has been in recent years, but\r\nphysically he is greatly changed. This he feels himself and thinks\r\nchiefly of the life beyond.\r\n\r\nTo-day the remains of the Prince Royal were solemnly carried to Paris.\r\nIt was a quiet, grave and calm ceremony in which the clergy took a\r\nvery large part; the first time for twelve years that the clergy have\r\nappeared in public. The experiment produced no bad result. All the\r\nshops were and are closed.\r\n\r\nYesterday I heard that M. de Zea has lost all credit and favour with\r\nQueen Christina. The Infanta Carlotta has so attracted her niece\r\nIsabella, that Espartero is becoming anxious; he wishes to send this\r\nformidable Infanta away from Madrid, and the ladies concerned in this\r\nintimacy have already been removed from the neighbourhood of the young\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Orléans shows not the smallest regret at the loss of\r\nthe Regency: her thoughts are entirely occupied with her position as\r\nguardian of her children and with her rights as mother; she wishes to\r\nhave full liberty of action on both of these accounts and to smooth\r\ndown beforehand any difficulty or controversy on this matter, both for\r\nthe present and for the future, which the King's death will complicate\r\nand make more important.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 1, 1842._--Yesterday I called upon the Marquise de\r\nJaucourt whom I found in a poor state of health. She had heard\r\nyesterday evening from the Prefect of the Seine that the brothers of\r\nthe Prince Royal had run great risks during the transference of his\r\nremains to Paris: barrels of gunpowder had been placed in position to\r\nblow them up, but the matter was discovered in time and no sensation\r\nwill be made. The poor Queen daily receives anonymous letters which\r\nstate that assassins are dogging the King to a greater extent than\r\never. What dreadful monsters!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 2, 1842._--The King has had a somewhat lively interview\r\nwith M. Molé, and reproached him with bringing disunion and discord\r\nupon the Conservative party: M. Molé replied that he was sorry to\r\ndisplease the King, but regretted that he could not obey him, as the\r\nimmediate safety of France depended upon the fall of M. Guizot. Madame\r\nde Lieven is embittered by this reply, and is even less\r\nself-restrained than before.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Orléans causes some astonishment by her anxiety\r\nconcerning her position. She shows no wish to be the Regent of the\r\nminority, but seems anxious to hold that position when the majority is\r\nattained, which will be fixed or has been proposed at the limit of\r\neighteen years. There are many intrigues in progress and all minds are\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphine was to go to Vienna for the birthday of the Emperor as\r\nusual, but on learning of the death of the Duc d'Orléans she wrote to\r\nexcuse herself, and to say that in such circumstances she could not\r\nappear at any festivity and would stay in the country. I think she has\r\nshown excellent dignity and good taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 4, 1842._--The ceremony at Notre Dame was magnificent,\r\nsplendid, simple and imposing. There was no untoward incident except\r\nthe noisy chattering of the deputies; and M. Laffitte, whose duty it\r\nwas as the oldest member of the Chamber to sprinkle holy water on the\r\nbier, bowed neither to the Archbishop, from whom he took the\r\nsprinkler, nor to the coffin. The Duc de Nemours looked very handsome\r\nand bowed most gracefully. The same is true of the Prince de Joinville\r\nalso, but not of the other two princes. Visconti had decorated and\r\narranged Notre Dame most successfully, and the black drapery increased\r\nthe effect of the noble architecture instead of hiding it. The\r\nplain-song, far from spoiling the effect, was more suitable than any\r\nother form would have been, so well was it performed. There was indeed\r\nnothing to criticise, and if every one did not feel the same degree of\r\nemotion, emotion was at least visible in every case.\r\n\r\nMy niece Hohenthal writes from Teplitz to say that the Duc de Bordeaux\r\nis receiving much benefit from the mineral waters and the baths, but\r\npeople were disagreeably surprised to see him at the play on the very\r\nevening when the news of the death of the Duc d'Orléans arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 5, 1842._--Yesterday I went to the Sacré Cœur to say\r\nfarewell to Madame de Gramont. She had just received letters from\r\nKirchberg[68] which told her that the day after the news of the Duc\r\nd'Orléans' death had arrived a black mass was said at which the\r\nDauphin, the Dauphine and Mademoiselle had both been present and had\r\ncommunicated, in prayer for the soul of the deceased. I have heard of\r\nnothing more touching or more Christian.\r\n\r\n  [68] Kirchberg an Wald, a château occupied by Charles X. after\r\n  1830.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rue de Varennes I went to say good-bye to the Princesse de\r\nLieven at Beauséjour. I found her greatly agitated by the Ministerial\r\ncrisis which is in the air, very angry with M. Molé, and delighted\r\nbecause the King was exasperated with him. She also asserted that M.\r\nGuizot will not retire until he has induced the Chamber to pass a\r\ndefinite vote expressing what is known as his unpopularity: she also\r\nsays that he will not retire when an opposition President has been\r\nnominated; that he will oppose the Address and the law upon the\r\nRegency; that he will then demand explanations from the Chamber, and\r\nthat the Chamber will only dissolve when he has been directly and\r\nclearly rejected. The King wishes that such shall be the course of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard came to see me this morning; he was tired, spoke of\r\nhis approaching death, and gave me the impression that he felt it to\r\nbe at hand. This was depressing, and I was not in good spirits at\r\nMaffliers where, in company with M. de Valençay, I dined with the poor\r\nPérigords, whose household has been greatly saddened by the failing\r\nhealth of Madame d'Arenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 7, 1842._--Yesterday at two o'clock I went to Neuilly\r\nin accordance with the orders of Madame Adélaïde. I took my leave of\r\nher, and as the King was kind enough to wish to see me, he came into\r\nhis sister's rooms. I found him looking very ill, and was the more\r\nmoved to compassion as his grief is manifested most naturally.\r\nSometimes he will speak of indifferent subjects, and then a word will\r\nrecall his loss and he weeps bitterly. The Queen's grief is said to be\r\nthe most vehement. She was so good, as was also the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans, as to send very kind messages and regrets that she could\r\nnot see me, but they feared, and with reason, that many other ladies\r\nmight also ask an audience of them if they made any exception. Since\r\nher misfortune the Queen has seen no one except her family, her\r\nhousehold and the Ministers.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Madame I went to see Mesdames de Dolomieu and de\r\nMontjoye. The former was out, but the latter was at home. She showed\r\nme a copy of a letter written to the Queen by one of her\r\nchaplain-bishops which was admirably consoling, and touched me\r\ngreatly. The Queen is growing calmer upon this terrible question, the\r\nmore so as a few weeks before his death, when the Duc d'Orléans was\r\nalone with his mother one day, he told her that she was wrong if she\r\nthought him indifferent upon religious matters and could be assured\r\nthat his ideas in that respect had greatly changed.\r\n\r\nThe King has just received news from St. Petersburg from M. Périer.\r\nHis despatch says that the Emperor Nicholas has assumed mourning\r\nwithout waiting for official notifications, and that he had sent Count\r\nNesselrode to M. Périer with his condolences, telling him he was\r\nordered to write a despatch to M. de Kisseleff, which the latter would\r\nconvey to M. Guizot, containing the same compliments. Similar forms\r\nwere observed upon the occasion of the death of the Duchess of\r\nWürtemberg. Apart from this no special notifications have passed\r\nbetween the two Courts. This breach of etiquette was begun by Russia\r\nat the time of the death of the Grand Duke Constantine, the first\r\nevent of the kind since 1830, and one which the Russian Court did not\r\nnotify to ourselves according to the old forms adopted in such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jeurs, August 9, 1842._--I left Paris yesterday after lunch. The heat\r\nwas great but it is cooler here. M. and Madame Mollien are as kind as\r\never, but I found him greatly changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maintenon, August 11, 1842._--I arrived here yesterday in time for\r\ndinner, after leaving the good Molliens in the morning, who had showed\r\nme their invariable hospitality. Before my departure letters from\r\nNeuilly had reached Jeurs stating that the Royal Family would spend\r\nthe month of September at the town of Eu.\r\n\r\nThere is an ancient celebrity here in the person of Madame Récamier,\r\nwho cannot speak in consequence of a neuralgic affection in her face.\r\nShe wears a perpetual smile which is somewhat wearying. M. Ampère, a\r\ndistinguished professor and a great favourite of Madame Récamier who\r\ntakes him about with her, is a witty and lively character, though with\r\nno distinction of manner. M. Brifaut, a pale member of the Academy and\r\nalso a satellite of Madame Récamier, is here reading old tragedies of\r\nhis own composition. There are also here M. de Vérac who is growing\r\nvery deaf, and Madame de Janson, sister-in-law of the Bishop of Nancy\r\nand sister of the Duchesse de Noailles, intellectual and clever but\r\nshy and reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, August 16, 1842._--I left Bonnétable the day before\r\nyesterday after the Sunday service and Tours yesterday after the mass\r\nof the Assumption, and lunched at the Prefect's house. I thought I\r\nshould arrive roasted. I can never remember being so hot in my life.\r\n\r\nI hear from Vienna that Prince Metternich has gone to Königwarth, that\r\nhe has then to reach the banks of the Rhine at the same time as the\r\nKing of Prussia, but that he is by no means well, looks ill and has\r\ngrown very thin. Barante writes as follows: \"I have some further\r\ndetails concerning the impression produced upon the Emperor by the\r\ndeath of the Duc d'Orléans. It was very keen. Horace Vernet, who\r\narrived the other day from St. Petersburg and who was formerly on\r\nintimate terms with him, told me of some assertions remarkable even\r\nfrom the political point of view. I am not greatly surprised at his\r\nnarratives; at other times and on other occasions the Emperor has\r\nexpressed himself in nearly the same terms, but he has adopted a\r\nposition, established it by certain forms without any consequent\r\ninconvenience to himself and so will not change. However, he does not\r\nwish to aggravate matters, and a mutual return of ambassadors will be\r\narranged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, August 23, 1842._--The Regency law has been passed by an\r\nimposing majority. The peers will confirm it, and in this respect at\r\nleast we can be at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, August 25, 1842._--Yesterday I had a letter from Paris\r\nwhich seems to give a fair summary of the present position. \"The\r\ndebate upon the Regency was fine and also curious: M. de Lamartine\r\nwent over to the Left in exasperation with the Conservatives who did\r\nnot appoint him President; M. Thiers broke his ties with the Left, as\r\nhe wishes to become a possible candidate; M. Odilon Barrot who had\r\nbegun the same manœuvre, did not speak at the last moment for fear of\r\nlosing his popularity with his party. The Legitimists took an\r\ninopportunely high tone and were trampled under foot. Such was the\r\ndrama. It was performed for the benefit of the Ministry, which would\r\nhave secured no advantage from this little session if it had followed\r\nthe advice of M. Thiers, for in that case all would have passed off\r\nwithout a struggle. Instead of that he has been used to win battles\r\nfor the Presidency and the Regency law. This is a first instalment of\r\nthe real session which will begin with extreme vigour, but the Cabinet\r\nhas always some chances of success, doubtless uncertain chances, for\r\nmuch depends upon the difficulty of forming another combination and\r\nthe inclination of the Conservatives to unite against the Left. The\r\nattacks will be furious and severe; there is danger, but also hope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, August 29, 1842._--I heard yesterday of your\r\ndisembarkation[69] at Liverpool. Welcome to our old Europe which, in\r\nspite of its unpleasantnesses, is better than the New World.\r\n\r\n  [69] Extract from a letter to M. de Bacourt.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris: \"The Queen is pale, thin and despondent, but calm:\r\nshe no longer struggles against her grief, and seems now to have\r\naccepted it as a necessary element in the whole of her life, though\r\nless poignant than it was; she can talk of other things. So I spoke to\r\nher of your tears and regrets, at which she cried, 'Oh, I know it and\r\nwas sure of it: the King and my sister have been deeply touched by all\r\nthat she has said to them and by the real sorrow she has shown; my\r\npoor boy had great confidence in her and was really one of her\r\nfriends.' All this was said in a manner which you would have been glad\r\nto hear. The Duchesse d'Orléans has returned from Dreux, where she had\r\ninsisted upon going before the journey to Eu. She seems to have had\r\nsome inclination to settle at the Elysée with her children, but this\r\nidea was so definitely rejected that she did not propose it again. The\r\nmillion voted by the Chambers to the Prince Royal falls to the Comte\r\nde Paris: his mother, as guardian, has the use of it, while she has\r\nalso her settlement of a hundred thousand crowns, so that during the\r\nminority she will be rich. She has made many minor reforms, but\r\npreserves her household of honour and is keeping up all the military\r\nhousehold of the late Prince for her son. There is some fear that she\r\nmay not be quite competent to manage her income: her husband used to\r\nsettle all details of expenditure, to which she is not accustomed and\r\nwhich she does not understand. Now that the first outburst of grief is\r\nover, many little cliques are advancing their claims upon all sides;\r\npolitical intrigues, family jealousies and court rivalry are all\r\nobvious, and if the King does not interfere there will be an Orléans\r\nparty and a Nemours party.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, August 31, 1842._--I have the following letter from Paris\r\nreferring to the life of the Royal Family before their departure for\r\nthe town of Eu: \"The officers on duty do not enter their room or take\r\nmeals with them: the King receives in the billiard room people who\r\ncome to see him or to pay their respects; the Queen, Madame Adélaïde,\r\nPrincesse Clémentine and the Duchesse de Nemours spend the evening in\r\nwork at the round table. Now they have started for Eu, and we must\r\nhope that the change will do them some good. The little Duc de\r\nChartres gave rise to some anxiety for a short time. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans lives in some retirement with the Grand Duchesse of\r\nMecklenburg.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven after spending a week at Dieppe, was so bored that\r\nshe came back hurriedly to her little Beauséjour, from whence she\r\nwrites: \"Thiers has definitely broken with the Left and is coming\r\nforward as the immediate successor to M. Guizot, a move which is not\r\nlikely to please M. Molé. The Chambers will be convoked for January 9.\r\nThere is no news concerning Pahlen or Barante. The whole of September\r\nwill be spent at Eu and they will then return to Saint-Cloud. The\r\nQueen of England is taking her husband to Scotland to console him with\r\ngrouse shooting for the fact that she would not allow him to go to the\r\nmanœuvres on the Rhine. The journey will be made quite quietly, in\r\nfact too quietly. Lord Aberdeen accompanies her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, September 8, 1842._--One of our friends who is now in\r\nEngland writes as follows from London: \"I have seen one of our friends\r\nhere, the excellent Dedel, the minister of the Low Countries who is\r\nsincerely attached to us. We talked a great deal together of past\r\ntimes, and he told me some curious details which may perhaps seem to\r\nyou somewhat like ancient history but which appear to me to be not\r\nwithout interest. At the accession of Queen Victoria, even before the\r\nmembers of the diplomatic body had had time to receive new letters\r\naccrediting them, the Queen wished to see them at Kensington Palace.\r\nThey were all introduced one by one by Lord Melbourne and Lord\r\nPalmerston. When the first three, namely Prince Esterhazy, General\r\nSébastiani and Baron Bülow had been introduced, Lord Melbourne took\r\nthem aside and said, 'Well, what do you think of _my little_ queen? Is\r\nshe not excellent? She is admirably well disposed to all foreign\r\nsovereigns and I can assure you that she will live in peace with every\r\none. There is one, however, for whom she has an extraordinary hatred:\r\nit is childish and foolish and I hope that we shall overcome her\r\nantipathy, but she has a violent dislike for the King of the Low\r\nCountries.' It is even more difficult, said Dedel, to imagine such\r\nlanguage in the mouth of an English Prime Minister. He then went on to\r\nsay that since Sir Robert Peel had been at the head of affairs, the\r\nQueen no longer interferes and leaves him entirely to himself. She had\r\ntaken a keen interest in Lord Melbourne's Ministry, as the precarious\r\ncondition of his Cabinet kept her in a continual state of excitement.\r\nNow she knows that nothing can shake Sir Robert Peel for a long time\r\nand her interest in state affairs is gone. This change has been\r\nunfortunate for Prince Albert, to whom she devotes her entire\r\nattention: she holds him in, does not give him a moment's freedom, and\r\nactually tyrannises over him; and the poor Prince sometimes finds it\r\ndifficult to conceal his disgust and weariness of this treatment. The\r\nQueen, moreover, has retained some affection for Lord Melbourne who\r\nused to amuse her, and was the first to initiate her in affairs of\r\nstate. Her hatred for the King of the Low Countries can be explained\r\nby the influence which the King of the Belgians long exerted over her,\r\nbut the antipathy seems to have grown much weaker of late. Dedel says\r\nthat the diplomatic body at London cuts a very poor figure now, that\r\nit has no social standing or consideration. The Russian Minister,\r\nBaron Brunnow, is an extremely clever man and a business man of high\r\ncapacity: he is false to the point of trickery, a true Russian-Greek,\r\nand a dangerous person with whom to do business. Dedel admits that\r\nBrunnow's diplomatic success in London has been great. General\r\nkindness has been shown to M. and Madame Sainte-Aulaire; she is\r\nreputed courteous and he amusing. M. de Barante has made a good\r\nimpression on those who have talked with him. On the whole, said\r\nDedel, General Sébastiani was the most successful of the three\r\nambassadors who followed M. de Talleyrand at London: his judgment was\r\nexcellent; his early impressions in business were invariably good; his\r\ngreat disadvantage was his inability to develop his ideas clearly. He\r\nhad a sound understanding of the Eastern problem and would have\r\nsettled it suitably if he had been left at his post. M. Guizot\r\ncommitted constant mistakes at London and clearly showed his profound\r\nignorance of diplomacy: he thought himself at Paris where everything\r\ngoes on by means of parliamentary intrigue, and attempted to detach\r\nLord Holland, Lord Clarendon and Lord John Russell from Lord\r\nPalmerston, forgetting that the latter was the brother-in-law of Lord\r\nMelbourne, the ultimate master; he also tried to overthrow the\r\nCabinet, a very imprudent and dangerous attempt for a Foreign Minister\r\nto make; he also tried to stir some Radical members of the House of\r\nCommons to rebel against Lord Palmerston, and was even so imprudent as\r\nto dine with them privately at the Star and Garter at Richmond. Lord\r\nPalmerston once said to Bülow, 'M. Guizot should be obliged to me for\r\nnot making use of the evidence in my hands, which clearly shows his\r\nattempts and intrigues to overthrow the Cabinet; they are of such a\r\nnature that they would authorise the Queen's Government to hand him\r\nhis passports.' The journey of Madame de Lieven to England also\r\ndamaged Guizot's credit in a large degree. Lord Palmerston, who knew\r\nMadame de Lieven's hatred for himself, regarded her arrival as a\r\nfurther blow at himself, and his vengeance then knew no bounds. On the\r\nwhole, France, the French and their Government have been in very bad\r\nrepute in England for the last two years, and it is considered that\r\nthe present French Embassy is not likely to bring about a change in\r\nfeeling. The present English Cabinet which blames Lord Palmerston's\r\nconduct, thinks that it has taken every possible step since it has\r\nbeen in power to restore good feeling with France. The Cabinet\r\nrecognises its failure with regret, but it has decided to do nothing\r\nmore but to await results and to be in readiness for any eventuality.\r\n\r\n\"Affairs are going badly in Holland, where the House of Orange is\r\nbecoming more and more unpopular. The old King is not forgiven for his\r\nrapacity, for the manner in which he has made money out of the country\r\nfor the last twenty-five years, and further, for his marriage with a\r\nBelgian Catholic, while for two years he had condemned the country to\r\nsupport conditions that were at least as burdensome as war without any\r\nof its glory or profit, and all for the aggrandisement of his own\r\nfamily. The new King is fickle, inconsiderate, and imprudent; people\r\ncriticise him for throwing himself into the arms of France, which is a\r\nnew and adventurous policy for Holland; he is also blamed for his\r\nobstinacy in maintaining an army upon a war footing which is ruinous\r\nto the country. The Budget remains at an enormous height: eighty\r\nmillion florins for a population of less than three millions. The\r\nnomination of Baron Heskern as Minister of the Low Countries at Vienna\r\nhas caused a great scandal in Holland, and revived unpleasant\r\nreports.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, September 11, 1842._--Yesterday I had a letter from M. de\r\nSalvandy, of which the following is an extract: \"Thiers has plunged in\r\nextraordinary style; apologies to the Government have been complete,\r\nand he has kissed hands. I should have thought him clever if he had\r\nbeen more dignified, but such things often happen. I do not think that\r\nhe has thus opened a road for his immediate return to power, but by\r\nthe mere fact that he seems to have done so, the advance becomes more\r\ndifficult for any one else. One of the consequences of this great\r\nflattery is to make the King unmanageable. M. de Lamartine has never\r\nbeen anything more than a meteor; he writes to M. Villemain that he\r\nwill form part of 'the great opposition': the only great thing about\r\nhim will be his powerlessness and his fall.\"\r\n\r\nI propose to start for Valençay in a few hours, and to spend a month\r\nwith my son in fulfilment of a long-standing promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 24, 1842._--I have been deeply grieved to hear of\r\nthe death of my poor and excellent cousin, Princesse Pierre\r\nd'Arenberg. Both she, her husband, and all that branch of my family\r\nhave been very kind to me, and I am deeply attached to them all. The\r\nSister of Charity who nursed Madame d'Arenberg heard her say\r\nimmediately after receiving extreme unction, \"Oh, God, Thy will be\r\ndone!\" I am convinced that she was fully aware of her danger during\r\nthe last forty-eight hours of her life, and that she did not speak\r\nmore clearly of her death from strength of mind, and because she would\r\nnot deprive those about her of the consolation of thinking that she\r\nwas still under a delusion. She was one of the elect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 27, 1842._--I did not know that the question of a\r\nmarriage between the Prince de Joinville and one of the Brazilian\r\nPrincesses had been discussed. I was under the impression that these\r\nPrincesses could not leave Brazil unless their brother, the Emperor,\r\nwho is not yet married, should have children. I am also astonished\r\nthat the French Queen does not feel some misgivings concerning the\r\nbreeding and education of these Princesses. Moreover, what reason is\r\nthere for such extreme haste in marrying a young man who is a sailor\r\nby profession, and has three brothers and three nephews already? The\r\nonly result will be a number of collateral branches which the division\r\nof inheritances and the increasing stinginess of the Chambers will\r\nreduce to poverty, so that they will soon become a burden upon the\r\nhead of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 5, 1842._--I have some reason to believe that\r\nPrincess Marie of Baden is to marry the Marquis of Douglas; at any\r\nrate, the newspapers do not know the whole truth.\r\n\r\nI shall leave here on the 15th, dine at Tours with the unfortunate\r\nd'Entraigues, who have just lost a daughter in very sad circumstances,\r\nand shall reach Rochecotte for the night. I prefer a long day's\r\ntravelling to the fatigue and the cold of the inns at this time of\r\nyear. M. Royer-Collard, whom I could not possibly have gone to see at\r\nChâteauvieux in consequence of the bad state of the roads, has been so\r\nkind as to come here; this attention at his age, and with his feeble\r\nhealth, has touched me deeply. He spoke to me of his domestic life,\r\nand of his nearest interests, and seems to care little about anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 16, 1842._--I reached here yesterday evening to\r\npass the night. There is always a special delight about home which is\r\nnot to be found elsewhere. At the same time I am sorry to leave\r\nValençay. They were most attentive to me, and the whole neighbourhood\r\nis always kind. I am very fond of my son and his society, and nowhere\r\nare remembrances so numerous and so powerful as at Valençay.\r\n\r\nA surprising and wonderful event has taken place at Nice, in which\r\nall the parties are known to me: their truth, their uprightness, their\r\nfaith and enlightenment are incontestable. The eldest daughter of the\r\nComte de Maistre[70] had been crippled for months by a twisted leg,\r\nand suffered desperate pain, screaming night and day; the doctors were\r\nin despair, and spoke of gangrene and amputation. She has just been\r\nentirely cured by ten minutes' fervent prayer in the presence of\r\ntwelve people who were in the room, and to the knowledge of the whole\r\ntown of Nice. The prayers were offered by Mlle. Nathalie de Komar, who\r\nhas been a great mystic for some years. The cure is complete, and the\r\nmalady was desperate. The young invalid is herself a saint, and\r\nintends to be a Sister of Charity. Such an event confuses and\r\noverwhelms the mind; it can neither be explained nor disputed under\r\nthe circumstances which occurred. One can but be silent, and bow the\r\nhead in adoration.\r\n\r\n  [70] Francesca de Maistre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 17, 1842._--I am somewhat wearied by my journey\r\nof yesterday. The priest came to tell me that he had been awaiting my\r\nreturn to place the stations of the Cross in his church. One of the\r\nGrand Vicars of Tours had just arrived to perform the ceremony at\r\nwhich I was obliged to be present. It was pretty and touching but the\r\nprocession especially was tiring: then the church is a long distance\r\naway; it is a bad road to drive and too long to walk and, in short,\r\nthe whole affair left me exhausted.\r\n\r\nI have heard from Pauline on the 8th from the villa Melzi and on the\r\n10th from Milan. She is quite delighted by everything that she sees,\r\nastonished at the tasteful splendour of the villa and touched by the\r\ngracious and kind welcome of the family. I am delighted that my\r\ndaughter should find this journey pleasant, as it has cost her a good\r\ndeal to undertake it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 19, 1842._--Yesterday I had a letter from Berlin\r\nwhich says that the ex-King of the Low Countries, the Count of Nassau,\r\nwill very probably return to the Hague. It is thought that he will\r\ntake his daughter with him,[71] as a means of extricating her quietly\r\nfrom her false position with reference to her husband and the whole\r\nCourt. She was allowed to appear at the marriage celebration of\r\nPrincess Marie of Prussia with the Grand Prince of Bavaria, but her\r\nhusband, Prince Albert, excused himself on the ground of illness, did\r\nnot put in an appearance and declines to see his wife again. I know\r\nthat Princess Marianne is regarded as flighty, but on my last journey\r\nto Berlin she was supposed to be on better terms with her very\r\ndisagreeable husband. Something must, therefore, recently have\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n  [71] Princess Albert of Prussia, _née_ Princess Marianne of the\r\n  Low Countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 27, 1842._--At Berlin I had heard some mention,\r\nnot of a huntsman of Prince Albert but of a Stallmeister or whipper-in\r\nwho used to ride alone with the Princess on her excursions in Silesia,\r\nbut I can hardly believe this story, though it seems to have gained\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 3, 1842._--English aristocracy is greatly\r\ndisturbed by the story of Prince George of Cambridge and Lady Blanche\r\nSomerset. What will become of her? A daughter of a private individual,\r\nwhatever his rank, could not marry a prince who might be called to the\r\nsuccession.[72]\r\n\r\n  [72] This marriage, which all the English newspapers announced as\r\n  likely to take place, was not performed, as the Queen absolutely\r\n  refused her consent and was supported by the Privy Council.\r\n  Prince George of Cambridge, through a letter from his solicitor\r\n  to the _Observer_, gave a formal denial to the slanderous rumours\r\n  in circulation, and Lady Blanche Somerset, daughter of the Duke\r\n  of Beaufort by his second marriage, afterwards married Lord\r\n  Kinnoul in 1848.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Lady Harriet d'Orsay was so grieved by the death of\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans that she turned for consolation to religion and she\r\nis to become a Catholic. Princess Belgiojoso is also in a great state\r\nof religious excitement, and as she is always devising some novel\r\nfeat, she is wearing a nun's dress.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Prince who is in Paris[73] at the present time has been to\r\nthe opera. He was taken behind the scenes where he was told that he\r\nwould find the chorus girls very affable: when there he began to kiss\r\nthem all with such vigour that he had to be taken out by main force\r\namid the general laughter of all present.\r\n\r\n  [73] This Indian Prince was a rich banker, Duwarkanout Tayore,\r\n  who was then travelling in England and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 4, 1842._--M. Bresson writes from Berlin to say\r\nthat the re-union of the states and of the railways which now have\r\ntermini in this capital, has largely increased the animation of the\r\ncity. He also says Count Maltzan is very ill and that his life is in\r\ndanger; he thinks Bülow the pleasantest Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nwith whom he has had to deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 12, 1842._--Madame de Lieven tells me that Lord\r\nMelbourne has had an attack which has left him very weak and ended his\r\npolitical career, which is a drawback for the Whigs. The marriage of\r\nPrincess Marie of Baden is officially announced: her position will not\r\nbe entirely agreeable to the English court which has resolved to treat\r\nher only as the Marchioness of Douglas. The poor Grand Duchess has\r\nnegotiated the whole business with her usual carelessness.\r\n\r\nI hear from Vienna that Prince Metternich is in feeble health and that\r\nhe is no longer at home to the diplomatic body in the evening, as he\r\nspends his mornings only in business and avoids any excitement before\r\ngoing to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 24, 1842._--The English seem to me to have a run\r\nof luck: they have successfully concluded their affairs in China and\r\nthe United States;[74] are predominant in Spain and Portugal; have\r\novercome all domestic disturbances and display a preponderant\r\ninfluence everywhere, which makes us ashamed of ourselves. We cannot\r\neven conclude a wretched little treaty with Belgium which will fall\r\ninto the arms of Prussia.\r\n\r\n  [74] After an expedition in China the English had just concluded\r\n  the treaty of Nankin, which opened new ports to European commerce\r\n  and allowed foreigners to settle in Canton. The treaty with the\r\n  United States had been signed on September 9, and settled the\r\n  long debated question of the frontier line between Canada and the\r\n  State of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1843\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 21, 1843._--I have a letter from M. de Salvandy,\r\nbreaking a long silence, which he explains as due to his political\r\nperplexities. He says that M. Guizot showed him very unworthy\r\ntreatment but is now courting his favour upon the eve of a serious\r\nstruggle, while M. Molé, on the other hand, thinks that his help may\r\nbe useful, and has changed disdainful indifference for extreme\r\nattention. Salvandy himself is not anxious either to hurt the King by\r\nvoting and speaking against M. Guizot, or to support an unpopular and\r\nincompetent Ministry. He thinks that the twenty votes which he can\r\nsway would be decisive in either direction. He seems to think that the\r\nMinistry is greatly compromised, and that even if it should emerge\r\nvictorious from the struggle upon the secret service funds, it could\r\nhardly exist until the end of the session. Meanwhile M. Guizot is\r\ngiving a monster rout to-morrow, followed by an Arabian Night's\r\nsupper, to use the romantic expression of Madame de Meulan.[75] The\r\nstruggle in the Chamber will begin next week, and is likely to be very\r\nkeen. M. Molé is full of ardour and confidence; his party will include\r\nMarshal Vallé, MM. Passy, Dufaure, Dupin, Bignon (of Nantes), de\r\nCarné, Laplagne, Salvandy, and Admiral Mackau. M. Thiers declares that\r\nhe will stand aside for the moment. Such is the gist of M. de\r\nSalvandy's letter, which is very long and very literary. I have\r\ntranslated it into ordinary prose.\r\n\r\n  [75] Mother-in-law of M. Guizot.\r\n\r\nI hear from Vienna that Frau von Reichenbach, wife of the old Elector\r\nof Hesse Cassel, has just died and left a large fortune to her\r\ndaughters, one of whom is a sister-in-law of Princess Metternich. The\r\nFlahauts have given two very fine balls, at one of which _he_\r\nattempted to waltz with Princess Paul Esterhazy, but as their strength\r\nrespectively failed, they both fell at full length, apparently with\r\nridiculous effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 23, 1843._--The leading articles in the _Journal\r\ndes Débats_ are becoming very attractive. It is a point of style to\r\nrefer to the Intrigue as a person; to say the Intrigue does, or\r\nspeaks, or wishes, or refuses so and so, which is amusing; but I can\r\nguess what it means; that M. Molé wishes, or refuses, or demands. It\r\nis really somewhat contemptible, and gives rise to actual anxiety, for\r\nnothing spoils theatrical effect so much as constant entrances and\r\nexits on the part of the actors.\r\n\r\nM. d'Arenberg relates a somewhat amusing remark of M. Thiers. At a\r\nconcert given by the Duchesse de Galliera, the Princesse de Lieven\r\nreproached M. Thiers for his want of attention; he told her that he\r\nwould be more attentive when she had left the Ministry. Another saying\r\nof his is also quoted: he is said to have declared that his return to\r\npower was by no means a forthcoming event, and that he would wish it\r\nto be preceded by the presidency of the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, February 25, 1843._--Yesterday I took from the library a\r\nvolume of memoirs, entitled _Memoirs of Gaston d'Orléans_, attributed\r\nto one of the officers of his household, Aglay de Martignac. I found\r\nthere this clever and witty observation by Gaston: \"During a short\r\nstay that the King made at Paris, Monsieur met the Queen when she had\r\njust completed a nine days' fast in prayer that she might have\r\nchildren; he said to her in a jesting tone, 'Madame, you have been\r\narousing the sympathy of your judges against myself; I will allow you\r\nto win your case if the King is sufficiently strong to secure your\r\nwishes.'\"\r\n\r\nBarante writes to say that the ambassador Pahlen is to go to Germany\r\nthis summer, and that he would like to do the same, that he might see\r\nfrom this meeting what his chances really are. He also says that the\r\nprospects of M. Guizot are somewhat doubtful; that the agitation set\r\non foot by M. Molé has lowered his prestige and compromised him; that\r\nThiers is manœuvring with renewed cleverness, and that falsehood is\r\nbecoming so habitual with every one that the general spectacle is\r\nrevolting and depressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 1, 1843._--Prince Pierre d'Arenberg, who has been\r\nhere for two days, brought Madame de Ludre's book,[76] from which he\r\nread some chapters yesterday evening in the drawing-room. The poor\r\nwoman has lost her way in the mazes of metaphysical hair-splitting,\r\nand has produced the most extraordinary and incomprehensible jumble\r\nthat any one could conceive. The ideas of the book and the divisions\r\nof it are amazingly eccentric, nor has it any merits of style, and\r\nwhat the object of it may be no one can tell. By way of a rest after\r\nthis reading we played at nonsense verses, and infantile as this\r\namusement is, it is infinitely more reasonable and intellectual than\r\nthe sublunary theology of Madame de Ludre.\r\n\r\n  [76] _Etudes sur les idées et sur leur union au sein du\r\n  Catholicisme_, two volumes in 8vo, Debécourt, 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, March 2, 1843._--I have come in from a long walk in\r\nincomparable weather; it is one of those days which help one to live\r\nand which are so enjoyable in the country and so rarely suspected at\r\nParis. The advance of vegetation is surprising; all the shrubs are\r\nshowing their opening leaves with the light and tender green of\r\nspring; the jonquils and narcissi are in flower, and we could strew\r\nthe ground with violets. Why should I change all this for the mud and\r\nfoggy atmosphere of Paris?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 12, 1843._--I am again submerged in Paris, and have\r\nheard a considerable amount of news since my arrival. Here are some\r\ndetails which have at least the merit of being amusing. A lady who met\r\nthe Duc de Noailles on the evening of the day when he made his speech\r\nconcerning the right of visitation, complimented him, adding,\r\n\"Unfortunately, M. le Duc, you are like the fowl which lays only one\r\ngolden egg in the course of the year.\" The Marquise de Caraman called\r\nupon the Duchesse de Poix on Tuesday when there were a number of\r\npeople in the room; the Duchesse de Gramont called her over and asked\r\nher to sit down at her side, and said to her aloud, \"Is it true,\r\nMadame, that you married Marshal Sébastiani?\" Madame de Caraman\r\nimmediately replied, calmly and in an equally loud voice, \"I know that\r\nmany people say so, but hitherto I have not met any one sufficiently\r\ntactless to ask me the question.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 14, 1843._--It is said that the monument which is to be\r\nplaced in the memorial chapel for the late Duc d'Orléans, is an\r\nadmirable piece of work. It represents the poor young Prince at the\r\nmoment of his death, in the dress that he was then wearing. The\r\nexpression is beautiful and touching: above the head is placed the\r\nangel, the last work of Princesse Marie, the Prince's sister; the\r\nangel is placed as though to receive the Prince's soul and carry it to\r\nthe skies, a beautiful idea which goes to the heart at once. A\r\nbas-relief represents the genius of France leaning upon an urn and\r\nweeping, with the national flag at its feet. Triqueti was commissioned\r\nwith this fine work. The whole of the Royal Family went to see the\r\nmonument: the Queen burst into sobs, the King nearly fainted and had\r\nto be taken out; the Duchesse d'Orléans wept much, but spoke for a\r\nlong time to the artist who executed this beautiful work.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Doudeauville, better known as the Vicomte Sosthène de La\r\nRochefoucauld, has written a character portrait of Mlle. Rachel who\r\ndoes not seem to be satisfied.[77] He asked Madame Récamier to read it\r\nto her. She replied \"I will ask M. de Chateaubriand.\" The latter said\r\nthat it would weary him, to which Sosthène answered, \"As you are so\r\nanxious to hear it, I will begin,\" and immediately read his\r\ncomposition without stopping.\r\n\r\n  [77] _See_ Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 16, 1843._--M. de Montrond asserts that the King told\r\nhim that he did not wish M. Molé to be minister; he would prefer that\r\nM. Thiers would come to an agreement with M. Guizot and that they\r\nshould act together. \"Molé is entirely perfidious\" the King is said to\r\nhave declared, \"and could never act with any one, whereas Thiers and\r\nGuizot are made to co-operate. They have no reason for mutual reproach\r\nor envy, are both men of letters, distinguished historians, members of\r\nthe Academy, &c.; in short they are made to act in agreement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 17, 1843._--M. Thiers dined the other day with M. Chaix\r\nd'Est-Ange, president of the corporation of barristers; MM.\r\nOdilon-Barrot, Sauzet, d'Argout, Berryer, Dupin, Martin du Nord, the\r\nguardian of the seals[78] and M. de Peyronnet, the former Minister of\r\nCharles X., were also there. M. Walewski was asked to guess in whose\r\nhouse so strange a meeting could have taken place, as most of the\r\nactors were members of the Intrigue, and said: \"It could only be at\r\nthe house of M. Molé.\" This incident took place in the salon of M.\r\nThiers and gave rise to many remarks at M. Molé's expense and the poor\r\nfigure he will cut after he is overthrown.[79]\r\n\r\n  [78] The Duc Pasquier.\r\n\r\n  [79] In 1843 the existence of Guizot's Ministry was endangered by\r\n  the question of the secret service funds. M. Molé, whose Ministry\r\n  had been overthrown in 1839 by the Thiers-Guizot coalition,\r\n  thought that the moment was advisable to organise a league\r\n  against his two adversaries. He went to work secretly by means of\r\n  conversations in drawing-rooms and passages, and entered into\r\n  relations with MM. Dufaure and Passy, who abandoned him at the\r\n  critical moment. The debate on the secret service funds began in\r\n  the Chamber on March 1 and turned in favour of the Cabinet, M.\r\n  Guizot gaining one of his most brilliant successes on this\r\n  occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 18, 1843._--The King has shown himself greatly touched\r\nby the eulogy which M. Guizot delivered upon him in his last speech in\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies, during the discussion upon the secret service\r\nfund. The same evening he wrote to M. Guizot that he would have come\r\nto thank him in person if he had not been prevented. The next day M.\r\nGuizot called upon the King at an early hour and the Queen came in\r\nwith all the Royal Family, and many warm words of thanks were\r\naddressed to the triumphant Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 20, 1843._--M. Molé has declared that he will retire\r\nfrom politics and will have nothing more to do with them, as he is an\r\nunacceptable minister to the King. He speaks of withdrawing into\r\nprivate life and devoting himself to the pleasures of friendship and\r\nof the intellect. Two months earlier this project would not have been\r\nundignified; to-day it seems to be dictated by spleen and will deceive\r\nno one.\r\n\r\nThe extreme calm of the Duchesse d'Orléans has caused some surprise,\r\nas also has the improvement in her health in the midst of her grief.\r\nShe devotes herself ardently to the education of her children, makes\r\nthis the chief object of her life and is not careful to hide the fact.\r\nThe Queen, after a heartrending and passionate outburst of grief, has\r\nrecovered her calm and the approaching marriage of Princesse\r\nClémentine[80] is a useful means of diverting her attention. Princesse\r\nClémentine is simply delighted, not so much because of her husband,\r\nwho is said to be an ordinary and insignificant character, as with the\r\nidea of becoming independent, gaining full liberty and escaping from\r\nthe round table in the family room at the Tuileries, which has been\r\nthe despair of the King's children from all time. Princesse Clémentine\r\nis to be married immediately after Easter at Saint-Cloud. She will\r\nthen start upon a tour to Lisbon, England, Brussels and Gotha, and\r\nreturn to Paris where she will live in the Tuileries. She is to\r\nreceive an income of only sixty thousand francs, while the Prince her\r\nhusband will have only a hundred and eight thousand, a very moderate\r\nincome. The Duchesse de Nemours, a pretty and docile child, obedient\r\nto the Queen in all respects, is her special favourite. The Duc de\r\nNemours is said to have relapsed into his taciturnity.\r\n\r\n  [80] With Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg Gotha (1818-1881),\r\n  brother of the Duchesse de Nemours. One of the children of this\r\n  marriage is the present King of Bulgaria, Ferdinand I.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 23, 1843._--At the Chamber of Deputies reference was\r\nmade to the illness which had suddenly attacked M. Dupin the elder,\r\nand which was said to have especially affected his face; upon which\r\nwords M. Thiers observed aloud with his usual imprudence, \"It is a\r\nface much more suitable for another sort of stroke.\"\r\n\r\nAll who have to deal with the Tuileries seem to think that some clouds\r\nhave already arisen between the Pavillon Marsan and the rest of the\r\npalace.[81] The Queen whom I have seen, told me with more surprise\r\nthan satisfaction that the Duchesse d'Orléans was actually better than\r\nbefore her loss, which no one would have supposed she could survive.\r\nShe added, \"No doubt her love for her children has inspired her with\r\nso much courage.\" The Queen is pleased with her grandsons but regrets\r\nthat they resemble the Weimar rather than the Orléans side of the\r\nfamily. She is also satisfied with the marriage of Princesse\r\nClémentine, as it will be a weight off her mind, and says very\r\nreasonably that Princesse Clémentine is twenty-five years of age and\r\ncan well judge for herself, while the religious aspect of the matter\r\nand the desire to secure a protector in future, make her ready to\r\naccept the marriage which the late Duc d'Orléans had arranged before\r\nhis death with the King of the Belgians. The Queen further said that\r\nthe chief establishment of the Princesse would be at Coburg but that\r\nshe would travel a good deal and often come to Paris.\r\n\r\n  [81] The Pavillon Marsan was occupied by the Duchesse d'Orléans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 27, 1843._--It is widely said that the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans shows the greatest preference for the Duchesse d'Elchingen,\r\nthe wife of one of her _aides-de-camp_; they are bosom friends. Some\r\none ventured to point out to the Duchesse d'Orléans that a preference\r\nof this kind, if unduly marked, might cause some ill-feeling in those\r\nabout her and among the members of her household who were by their\r\nposition her more natural intimates: she replied with some bitterness\r\nand with a touch of sentimentality which has been characterised as\r\ntruly German, to the effect that every one is free to devote himself\r\nunreservedly to the pure enjoyment of a friendship based upon\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nThough the Duchesse d'Orléans is legally the guardian and chief\r\nprotector of her children, she is not to be left in full enjoyment of\r\nher rights. The King has to some extent appropriated the rights of\r\nguardian and leaves his daughter-in-law nothing but the user of the\r\nhundred thousand crowns of her settlement which are assured to her by\r\nlaw. The income of the Comte de Paris goes through the King's hands,\r\nwho pays all expenses and demands an account of everything. The same\r\nis true with regard to the Duc de Chartres, the second son.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the Duchesse d'Orléans had some difficulty in\r\nrealising that she was bound to live in complete retirement during the\r\nperiod of full mourning. She had been giving a large number of\r\naudiences. The King observed somewhat drily that she saw too many\r\npeople for one in her position, and her door is therefore open only to\r\nmembers of her household. People also think that she has been a little\r\ntoo generous in giving away portraits of her husband and autographs;\r\neven M. Gentz de Bussy, the military intendant has been thus favoured.\r\nThose most deeply in her confidence declare when she is pitied that\r\nshe has the highest and most important position in the country and is\r\ncalled to play a most exalted part, and she herself cherishes this\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 30, 1843._--The Comte d'Argout was saying yesterday at\r\nthe house of Madame de Boigne that the Abbé de Montesquiou, when\r\nMinister of the Interior in 1814, obliged the Council of State to\r\nresume the former dress and short cloaks: when these gentlemen were\r\nreceived by Louis XVIII. with the other bodies, their unusual costume\r\naroused great curiosity and the soldiers who were present were\r\nespecially surprised and said among themselves, \"These must be the new\r\nclergy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 2, 1843._--At dinner with the Princesse de Lieven the\r\nother day there was much talk concerning the United States of America,\r\nand little to their credit was naturally said. On this subject M. de\r\nBarante recalled a saying of the late M. de Talleyrand, \"Do not talk\r\nto me of a country where every one I saw wanted to sell me his dog.\"\r\nThere was much pleasant conversation at this dinner which was very\r\nwell assorted. The disaster of Guadeloupe[82] and the comet were not\r\nthe sole topics, as they are everywhere else: these subjects, however,\r\nhad their turn and reference was made to an amusing caricature in\r\nwhich M. Arago, the chief of the Observatory is represented not as\r\nobserving but as observed by the comet.[83] From the pleasant subject\r\nof M. de Noailles on Saint Cyr,[84] the conversation turned to Louis\r\nXIV., the Grande Mademoiselle and the collection of curious portraits\r\nexisting at the castle of Eu. M. Guizot was glad to be able to tell us\r\nthat he had slept on the ground floor in the room of M. de Lauzun and\r\nthat he went upstairs to have an audience with the King by the same\r\nstaircase which had conducted this insolent husband to the Princess,\r\nwhose room the King now uses. What a coincidence.\r\n\r\n  [82] On February 8, 1843, at half-past ten in the morning, an\r\n  earthquake shock which lasted seventy seconds caused great damage\r\n  at Guadeloupe, destroyed the town of La Pointe à Pitreand, almost\r\n  the whole of this French colony, and engulfed thousands of dead\r\n  and wounded. A great deal of damage was also done in the English\r\n  Antilles.\r\n\r\n  [83] In 1843 a Frenchman, M. Faye, discovered a periodic comet,\r\n  whose orbit he calculated, and which bears his name. This\r\n  discovery made some stir. M. Faye was awarded the Lalande prize\r\n  of the Academy of Sciences and was appointed Knight of the Legion\r\n  of Honour.\r\n\r\n  [84] A remarkable fragment upon Saint Cyr was printed and\r\n  published in 1843 for private circulation. It may be regarded as\r\n  the basis of the work of the Duc de Noailles on _Madame de\r\n  Maintenon and the Chief Events of the Reign of Louis XIV._ The\r\n  fragment appears at the beginning of the third volume of this\r\n  work, which was to open the doors of the French Academy to the\r\n  Duc de Noailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 3, 1843._--Yesterday I called upon Madame de Rambuteau\r\nat the Hotel de Ville. She was coming back from service at Notre Dame\r\nand had just heard the Abbé de Ravignan preaching against feminine\r\nluxury and the want of decency in feminine fashions. He used the word\r\n\"low-cut\" and in speaking of low-cut dresses, he went so far as to say\r\n\"Where will they stop?\" and asserted that excess in this direction was\r\nnot even pretty. Father de Ravignan is by temperament grave, simple\r\nand austere and such expressions were regarded as particularly daring\r\nin his mouth. However, his criticism is only too true. Women are far\r\ntoo extravagant: our toilets are complicated by a thousand\r\naccessories, which double the expense without producing any better\r\neffect, and young women or those who wish to be fashionable, are\r\nhardly dressed. My late uncle M. de Talleyrand, when I began to take\r\nPauline into society, advised me most seriously to respect the\r\ndecencies of dress and said to me on this subject, expressing almost\r\nthe same ideas as those of M. de Ravignan, \"If people show what is\r\npretty, it is indecent, and if they show what is ugly, it is very ugly\r\nindeed.\" He also said of a very thin woman who disdained to wear the\r\nlightest gauze, \"No one could disclose more and show less.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 5, 1843._--Some one who ought to know told me yesterday\r\nthat at the time of the coalition which discredited M. Guizot so\r\ngreatly, his constant presence at the house of the Princesse de Lieven\r\ndispleased and embarrassed the diplomatic body. Eventually Count\r\nPahlen, the Russian ambassador, spoke to the Princess upon the subject\r\nin friendly terms and said that he and his colleagues would have to\r\nrefrain from coming to her house in the evening if they were forced to\r\nmeet M. Guizot there upon every occasion. She replied that she was so\r\nanxious to preserve her good relations with her ambassador that she\r\nwould limit M. Guizot's visits. As a matter of fact she simply related\r\nto him her conversation with Count Pahlen and while assuring him of\r\nthe value which she placed upon his friendship, she begged him to be\r\nless constant in his evening calls: M. Guizot replied with some\r\nbitterness, \"As you please, madame, it is understood that I will see\r\nyou no more in the evening until I become Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nwhen the diplomatic body will ask to be invited to your house in order\r\nthat they may meet me.\" No prophecy could have been more exact.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 14, 1843._--The day when General Baudrand, who had been\r\nappointed Governor to the Comte de Paris, came to pay his respects to\r\nthe King, he made some modest observation concerning the weight of his\r\nresponsibilities: the King interrupted him and said, \"Make your mind\r\neasy, my dear general; it is understood that the governor of Paris is\r\nmyself\": I think that the Duchesse d'Orléans has been induced to agree\r\nto this choice because she too intends some day to say to poor General\r\nBaudrand, \"I am the governor.\"\r\n\r\nYesterday evening at the house of Madame de Boigne, where I went with\r\nM. and Madame de Castellane, who have returned from Rome, the\r\nconversation naturally turned upon Cardinal Consalvi, whom I knew very\r\nwell. He was kind, keen-sighted, witty and agreeable as a man of the\r\nworld; there was nothing clerical about him except his dress. The\r\nChancellor[85] who was also with Madame de Boigne, related that when\r\nthe whole weight of governmental responsibility rested upon the\r\nCardinal at Rome, he still took pains to send out theatre tickets and\r\nto perform all the politenesses and duties of social life. At the\r\nCongress of Vienna where he was instructed to defend the interests of\r\nthe Holy Chair and to obtain the restoration of the legations if\r\npossible, I heard him one day vigorously and cleverly advancing the\r\nrights of the Pope. M. de Talleyrand was discussing this question with\r\nhim: after several arguments for and against, the Cardinal suddenly\r\ncried with inimitable Italian gesture and accent, \"But why can you not\r\ngive us a little territory here on earth; we will give you as much as\r\nyou like in the world above\"; with which words he raised his hands and\r\nhis eyes to Heaven with wonderful energy.\r\n\r\n  [85] The Duc Pasquier.\r\n\r\nMadame de Boigne, who is generally as reserved as she is restrained,\r\nwent so far as to quote a somewhat frivolous remark which Pozzo had\r\nmade to her at the time of the Queen of England's marriage. Madame de\r\nBoigne had asked Pozzo whom the Queen of England was to marry and he\r\nreplied, \"Another scion of royalty\": thus he designated the Coburgs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 15, 1843._--Yesterday the Abbé Dupanloup preached upon\r\nthe Agony, at Saint Roch, and showed much cleverness and emotional\r\npower, but his voice was somewhat too artificially modulated, he was\r\nat times wearisome and repeated himself, and the long passage about\r\nthe mother's grief felt by the Virgin would have been more effective\r\nif it had been shortened by half. As he was almost speaking to the\r\nQueen, who was with the Princesses in a pew opposite the pulpit, he\r\nshould have spared her some of the analysis of maternal grief and its\r\nhorrors, which renewed the tortures of the poor Queen: she burst into\r\ntears, and some of those present had the bad taste to rise in their\r\nplaces in order to see her weep.\r\n\r\nThe dress which Prince Augustus of Saxe Coburg is to wear upon his\r\nmarriage day caused some perplexity,[86] but the King of Saxony, his\r\ncousin, solved the difficulty by at once appointing him a general.\r\n\r\n  [86] His marriage with the Princesse Clémentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 16, 1843._--Dr. Cogny reminded me yesterday of M. de\r\nTalleyrand's reply to some one who had said before him that the wise\r\nman should live his life in secret: \"I see no necessity for secrecy or\r\nfor ostentation; a man should be simply what he is, without\r\nforethought or affectation.\" M. de Talleyrand was, in fact, so natural\r\nin every respect and laid such stress upon the truth in matters of\r\nlife that I have constantly known him to say, to write and to repeat\r\neven by way of exclamation, as if he were replying to his own\r\nthoughts, \"What a fine thing simplicity is.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Barante, during his embassy at Turin, convinced himself that\r\nMatthioli, whom some historians have supposed to be the famous Iron\r\nMask, died at Piedmont, and could not possibly be identified with that\r\ncelebrated personage. Louis XVIII. was so curious concerning this\r\nmystery, the truth of which was ultimately known only to Louis XVI.,\r\nthat upon the very day when he saw his unhappy niece, the Duchesse\r\nd'Angoulême at Mitau, he questioned her to learn whether Louis XVI.\r\nbefore his death had entrusted her with this secret. The Princess\r\nreplied that he had not. Louis XVIII. himself told this to the Duc\r\nDecazes. It is an incident which does more honour to his curiosity\r\nthan to his good feeling. On this subject another point occurs to me\r\nwhich I have often heard related by my late uncle, M. de Talleyrand,\r\nwho never quoted it without expressing his profound astonishment. When\r\nhe was Minister of Foreign Affairs a courier came to him one evening\r\nbearing news which might have disturbed the equanimity of Louis\r\nXVIII.: he therefore postponed the communication of it to the King\r\nuntil the next morning, and coming before the King at an early hour,\r\nhe said to him, \"Sire, as I was afraid of spoiling your Majesty's\r\nrest, I postponed bringing these papers until this morning.\" The King\r\nin surprise replied, \"Nothing disturbs my sleep, as you may see from\r\nthis instance: the most dreadful blow of my life was my brother's\r\ndeath; the courier who brought this dreadful news arrived at eight\r\no'clock in the evening; for several hours I was quite overcome, but at\r\nmidnight I went to bed and slept my usual eight hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 20, 1843._--The different people in attendance upon the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans yesterday received a letter from the Princess\r\nsaying that the mourning for the Duc d'Orléans was too serious a\r\nmatter to be interrupted by any incident, and that consequently no one\r\nin her service would be able to suspend his mourning for the marriage\r\nof Princesse Clémentine. The letter concluded with these words, \"Such\r\nis my intention.\" Some people wish to regard this letter as a decided\r\ncriticism of the fact that Princesse Clémentine's marriage is to be\r\ncelebrated before the year of mourning for the Prince has expired. It\r\nis not the first instance which has shown a certain divergence between\r\nthe Duchesse d'Orléans and the Royal Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 22, 1843._--The Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg,\r\nthe mother-in-law of the Duchesse d'Orléans, told a lady with whom she\r\nis on confidential terms and who repeated the remark to me, that she\r\nwas greatly grieved at the restraint in which the King keeps the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans in every respect. It is said that the Princess\r\nproposes to wear mourning for the rest of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 29, 1843._--Some months ago Princesse Belgiojoso\r\nproduced a book which is rather pedantic than serious, entitled _The\r\nFormation of Catholic Dogma_. The work is simply a catalogue of the\r\ndifferent heresies which appeared in the early centuries of Church\r\nhistory. It presupposes researches so long and arduous that it is\r\ndifficult to think that a young society woman could have written it\r\nunaided: the style is simple and strong, and the book is clearly\r\nmarked by want of orthodoxy; indeed it has already been placed upon\r\nthe Index by Rome. There has been much surmise as to who could have\r\ncollaborated with the Princesse. M. Mignet and the Abbé Cœur, who are\r\nboth intimate with her, have been mentioned. On this occasion some one\r\nin whose hearing reference was made to the book said, \"It is a good\r\ninstance of the saying, the style is the man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Coigny, knight of honour to the Duchesse d'Orléans, is a\r\nsomewhat brusque and unpolished character: he had a small quarrel with\r\nthe Princesse on the question of General Baudrand, as governor to the\r\nComte de Paris, saying that it was hardly worth while to press forward\r\na choice so poor and mean, and that people had expected the Duc de\r\nBroglie or some marshal or notable person. The Duchesse d'Orléans\r\nreplied, \"If the choice is a bad one, I alone am responsible for it,\r\nfor I earnestly pressed it upon the King.\" The Duc de Coigny then\r\nbecame really angry, and asked an explanation of this preference.\r\n\"What can you expect?\" was the reply, \"you know that we do not care to\r\nhave about us people who are burdensome.\" M. de Coigny replied, \"So\r\nyour Royal Highness only wanted a man of straw? It is pitiable!\" And\r\nthe conversation then finished.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de la Moskowa, the eldest son of Marshal Ney, is a great\r\nmusician, and conceived a plan for promoting a taste for sacred music\r\nat Paris; such music is strangely unknown and little appreciated. He\r\nhas taken great trouble to gather a few amateurs, and attempts to\r\narouse some interest in the association among certain ladies by asking\r\nthem to become patronesses. I am one of the number. The day before\r\nyesterday the first performance took place in the salon of Hertz. The\r\nattempt was laudable but the result only moderately successful,\r\nnotwithstanding the great talent of Madame de Sparre and another\r\nfemale voice. But in Paris people cannot sing austere and sacred\r\nnumbers of religious music with due simplicity and gravity and without\r\ndramatic action. It is a new art in this country, and can only be\r\nacclimatised at the expense of time, but the attempt is none the less\r\ninteresting. I told the Prince de la Moskowa that he ought to secure\r\nthe support of the Paris priests, of whom I saw two in the room.\r\n\r\nA sad accident has just happened to a family of my acquaintance. A\r\nyoung man of eighteen, Henri Lombard, the pride and joy of his\r\nparents, the honour of his school and beloved by his comrades, died on\r\nthe 24th of this month after an illness of three days; the illness in\r\nquestion was hydrophobia. Last November he found one of his sporting\r\ndogs surly and depressed: the same day his hand was scratched by the\r\nanimal's teeth, which died a short time afterwards of madness. His\r\nmaster, who was very fond of the animal, was so bold as to wipe away\r\nthe foam from the dog's mouth while he was tied up, with his sponge:\r\nhe afterwards washed out the sponge and used it as before; but he\r\ncould not forget the scratch upon his hand of which he had not at\r\nfirst spoken; not until three months after the dog's death did he tell\r\nhis old nurse that for several weeks he had been anxious and uneasy,\r\nbut that lapse of time had entirely reassured him and that he now felt\r\nquite confident. A quiet and studious youth, he was by no means lively\r\nand communicative and spoke very little of his inner feelings: thus,\r\nno member of his family knew how assiduously he had followed for\r\nnearly a year the religious instructions given at Saint Louis d'Antin\r\nby M. Petetot, the clever and respected priest of that parish. Henri\r\nLombard's parents were by no means accustomed to attend such\r\nexercises, and he had probably been afraid of displeasing them by\r\ndisplaying habits in contradiction with theirs. Such was the state of\r\naffairs on Friday, April 21, when he felt very ill, and experienced a\r\nmarked repugnance to liquids; he immediately recognised the hopeless\r\nnature of his condition and begged M. Petetot to come and speak to\r\nhim. He fulfilled all his religious duties not only with exemplary\r\nregularity but with such fervent faith and such remarkable resignation\r\nthat the priest and all present were both astonished and edified.\r\nDuring the dreadful attacks of this horrible malady, in the terrible\r\ngrip of the strait-waistcoat, covered with the disgusting foam of\r\nmania, racked by the disease, for which no remedy can even be tried,\r\nHenri Lombard thought only of heaven: the solemn parting of soul and\r\nbody seemed to have taken place even before the moment of death; the\r\nsoul long buried in silent meditation was thus revealed and fled from\r\nits earthly bonds; it found language and expressions supernatural in\r\ncharacter. When he was able to speak he exhorted every one with\r\nstrange appropriateness and authority, especially his mother, whom he\r\nknew to be in the wrong towards a respected member of his family. He\r\nsaid to her with words of inspiration, \"Mother, from my death-bed I\r\nsend you to ask pardon and to repair the wrong you have done.\" When\r\nMadame Lombard returned to him he said, \"I know you will weep over my\r\ngrave and think you draw nearer to me in going to my tomb, and you\r\nwill not know or feel that I am no longer there. You will not raise\r\nyour eyes to the place where I shall be above. I shall be better off,\r\nfor I shall be where I can intercede for you.\" The schoolboys who were\r\nboarders at the Hospice de la Charité, whom the uncle of Henri\r\nLombard, M. Andral, had placed near him, and who did not leave until\r\nall was over, were so overcome by the scene that their agnostic ideas\r\nwere entirely changed. M. Andral himself, though accustomed to the\r\nmost heartrending sights, was depressed and consoled at the same time.\r\nThe funeral of the youth was remarkable for the fact that it was\r\nattended by the whole of the school to which he belonged and by the\r\ngeneral eulogy and regret which was expressed upon all sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 30, 1843._--The charity bazaar for the benefit of the\r\nvictims in the earthquake at Guadeloupe produced more than a hundred\r\nthousand francs net. Those of us who acted as saleswomen had a\r\nlaborious but not uninteresting task; each of the lady patronesses had\r\nsome small adventure to relate. The following was mine: A man of some\r\nage came and asked me the price of a little porcelain goblet. I\r\nreplied, \"Twenty francs.\" \"Is it French porcelain?\" \"No, sir, it is\r\nSaxony porcelain from the Dresden factory.\" \"From Dresden!\" replied\r\nthe gentleman, \"I have unpleasant memories of Dresden, for I am an\r\nartillery officer, and during the wars of the Empire I blew up the\r\nbridge at Dresden, acting under orders from my superiors.\" \"Well, sir,\r\nthen you do not know that you are speaking to a German lady?\" \"You\r\nwill be generous, madame, and pardon wrongs committed in time of war.\"\r\n\"Yes, sir, if you are generous to our poor people.\" \"Give your orders,\r\nmadame; I will buy anything you like, or at any rate anything I can,\r\nfor I am not rich.\" With these words he emptied his purse upon the\r\ncounter. It contained thirty francs. I was preparing to add a\r\ncigar-holder to the goblet when he asked me to give him something of\r\nmy own make. I substituted some worked slippers for the cigar-holder.\r\nThe officer took them and said to me very gracefully, \"Madame, has\r\npeace been made?\" \"Certainly, sir, signed and ratified.\"\r\n\r\nA provincial lady who came to our stall during the last three days of\r\nthe sale told us upon the last day that she had been so touched and\r\novercome by our zeal and by our polite and obliging energy that she\r\nasked us to accept a little souvenir. She then offered the Comtesse\r\nMollien and myself, who were at the same stall, a pair of lace\r\nmittens. We thanked her in the name of the poor, as we thought she\r\nintended the lace work for our stall, but she clearly explained that\r\nit was for ourselves. She would not tell us her name, and with great\r\ndifficulty we induced her to accept from us in memory of our stall a\r\ncup which we presented to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 5, 1843._--Yesterday I called upon Queen Christina. She\r\nhas intelligent eyes, beautiful skin, a cheerful smile, is pleasantly\r\ndimpled and is a ready talker with a slight accent that animates her\r\nevery observation. She will discuss any subject without embarrassment.\r\nA free and easy life is her preference, and I think she is greatly\r\nrelieved to be far from the throne and political business. The freedom\r\nand to some extent the obscurity of her life at Paris suit her to\r\nperfection. She has not a single lady-in-waiting, and the number of\r\nchamberlains about her are somewhat surprising. Only upon great and\r\nunavoidable occasions is Madame de Toreno requested to accompany the\r\nQueen. Muñoz is here: he lives quietly in the Queen's house, and is\r\nregarded as her husband. Their five children are being brought up at\r\nGrenoble. It is confidently stated that he is a sensible man and that\r\nhis influence over the Queen's mind is supreme. Though not so\r\nenormously fat as the Infanta Carlotta, the Queen is much too stout,\r\nand her deficiency in this respect is the more obvious as she will not\r\nwear stays; besides, she is short of stature. She spoke to me of her\r\nSpanish daughters, and said that Queen Isabella had a very dignified\r\nbearing, that she was a clever and decided character, entirely made\r\nfor the difficult part which she is called on to play; that her health\r\nhad been restored and that she was even strong and robust. She added\r\nthat unfortunately those about her made no attempt to induce her to\r\nstudy, lest they should lose her favour, and she remained very\r\nignorant. The Queen also told me that the news of her daughters that\r\ncame to her was reliable, because she had other than official sources\r\nof information. She spoke a great deal of the late Duc d'Orléans with\r\nextreme regret, saying that his death was a loss not only to France,\r\nbut even to Spain. \"Not that the King,\" she added, \"has been\r\nill-disposed to Spain, but there was in the Prince Royal a youthful\r\nardour and an enterprising spirit which would have been very useful to\r\nmy daughter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day when the Rouen railway was opened, while the Duc de Nemours\r\nwas in the tent upon the platform, a lady and gentleman who were also\r\ntravelling, attempted to come in. The official allowed the lady to\r\npass while the gentleman stopped to talk with some one. When he wished\r\nto follow the lady, the official said to him, \"You cannot pass here.\"\r\n\"But I am a deputy.\" \"No matter.\" \"But you have allowed my wife to go\r\nthrough.\" \"Very likely!\" \"But there she is, talking to the Prince.\"\r\n\"All the more reason why you cannot go through.\" This answer, which\r\nwas heard by several people, caused general delight.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Nemours is taking every trouble to fulfil the\r\nresponsibilities of his new position without omission,[87] but this\r\nwork is obviously an effort to him and he does not show the easy grace\r\nwhich distinguished his elder brother. He goes fairly regularly to the\r\nChamber of Peers and even expresses very correct and reasonable\r\nopinions to his neighbours upon the questions before the House, but he\r\nspeaks coldly and in an embarrassed style and as briefly as possible.\r\nThen he may be seen leaving the Chamber on foot and alone with a cigar\r\nin his mouth, and thus returning to the Tuileries.\r\n\r\n  [87] After the death of the Duc d'Orléans in 1842 the Chamber of\r\n  Deputies passed a law nominating the Duc de Nemours as Regent of\r\n  the Realm during the minority of the Comte de Paris in the event\r\n  of the death of the old King. From this time the Prince sat in\r\n  the Chamber of Peers and made official journeys of inspection\r\n  through the departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 10, 1843._--The Comte de Paris, though hardly five years\r\nold, has been definitely handed over to male guardianship. His tutor\r\nwill sleep in his room. His nurse, however, will still look after him.\r\nThe arrangement seems to be due to the King's wishes. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans is vexed by it. Since her widowhood she had not returned to\r\nher own bedroom and had slept in the nurse's bed in the room of the\r\nComte de Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 12, 1843._--I had a long interview yesterday with the\r\nKing. He spoke of Prussia, whither I am to make a journey, and\r\nexpressed his dissatisfaction at the fact that the King of Prussia\r\nwent to England last year and afterwards came to Neuchâtel,[88] but\r\nwent along the whole frontier of France from Ostend to Bâle without\r\ntouching French territory. However King Louis-Philippe had asked the\r\nKing of Prussia to come by way of Compiègne where they would have met.\r\nThe King of Prussia declined the invitation, replying that his\r\nshortest journey was through Belgium and that his time was fully\r\nengaged. It seems that His Prussian Majesty was anxious to avoid a\r\nmeeting, even with the King of the Belgians, but as the latter had\r\ngone to Ostend for that purpose, he was obliged to give way. The\r\ngreatest ill-feeling was caused by the remark of the King of Prussia,\r\nin reply to some one who expressed his astonishment at His Majesty's\r\nrefusal to travel through France: \"What can you expect; we have\r\npromised not to offer any isolated act of politeness to King\r\nLouis-Philippe.\" The French King, deeply wounded, has since ordered\r\nhis diplomatic officials to refuse passports to foreign princes who\r\nmight wish to come to Paris incognito, in order to save himself the\r\nnecessity of meeting them, as the Princes of Würtemberg have done and\r\nas the Grand Duke Michael of Russia was inclined to do. Orders have\r\nbeen given upon the frontiers to exercise the strictest supervision in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n  [88] The country of Neuchâtel had been ceded to Frederick I.,\r\n  King of Prussia, in 1707, and became French territory from 1806\r\n  to 1814. The treaties of Vienna had restored it to Frederick\r\n  William III., though it remained within the Swiss Confederation.\r\n  The state of things was to continue until the revolution of 1848,\r\n  when the mountaineers expelled the Prussians. Frederick William\r\n  IV. did not finally abandon his rights until 1850, and a\r\n  convention signed on May 24, 1852, secured the independence of\r\n  Neuchâtel while reserving to Prussia her rights.\r\n\r\nMadame Adélaïde seems to be quite in despair at the marriage of\r\nPrincesse Clémentine which will not provide her with a brilliant\r\nposition, while the Prince is a nonentity. Madame told me it was very\r\nembarrassing and \"even worse than the Duke Alexander of Würtemberg.\"\r\nMadame and the King explained their consent to this marriage on the\r\nground that it was impossible to refuse to a daughter aged twenty-six\r\na marriage which was not absolutely unsuitable, when no other\r\nprospects were in view. Madame and the King are astonished at the\r\ndelight which the Princess shows at the prospect of going to Coburg,\r\nafter her first travels, for there she will find very few social\r\nresources, while her position as a Princess of Orléans and a Catholic\r\nmay prove a source of trouble and embarrassment amid all the little\r\nCourts of Germany; but this young and amiable Princess is delighted by\r\nthe prospect of change and novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 15, 1843._--Yesterday I had the honour to receive\r\ncommissions from the Duchesse d'Orléans to be performed by me in\r\nPrussia. She is especially intimate with her cousin, the Princess of\r\nPrussia, whose distinction of mind and lofty character please all her\r\nintimate friends and deepen their attachment to her. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans seemed to me more despondent yesterday than she was the\r\nfirst time that I saw her after her widowhood had begun. She seems to\r\nfeel more and more profoundly her cruel desolation. Many\r\ncircumstances have also contributed to embitter her temper for some\r\ntime. She expresses herself in gentle and measured terms, but with\r\nless restraint. The departure of the Dowager Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenburg has left her very lonely, and I found her at one of those\r\nmoments when the mind cannot suffice for itself, when the power of\r\nresistance is yielding, and when confidence became an imperative need.\r\nRelying upon my sympathy and my loyalty to the memory which she\r\nadores, the Princess threw off restraint and opened her heart in a\r\nmanner which touched me profoundly. She spoke with bitterness, for\r\nwhich she was the first to reproach herself, of her feelings when the\r\nDuc de Nemours was obliged to perform in public those duties which the\r\nlate Prince performed so admirably; the opening of a railway, a race\r\nmeeting, or a public function of the kind, are so many wounds to her.\r\nShe spoke naturally, with perfect choice of language. Her conversation\r\nwas also deeply marked with religious feeling. She referred briefly to\r\nthe marriage of Princesse Clémentine, and her impressions seemed to\r\ncoincide with those of Madame Adélaïde. In short, I stayed two hours\r\nwith the Duchesse d'Orléans, who seemed to find some relief in\r\ntalking, an unusual pleasure for her, as her life is confined within\r\nsomewhat narrow limits. She talks remarkably well, and shows a\r\nshrewdness of observation and a constant desire to please. Perhaps all\r\nthis is too good to be true, and so I was somewhat relieved to see her\r\nlose her self-command for the first time. In order to admire her as\r\nshe deserves, I was waiting for her emotion to become predominant, and\r\nI was not disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 18, 1843._--Yesterday I met Father de Ravignan at the\r\nhouse of the Abbé Dupanloup. I was delighted by his noble face and the\r\ngentle gravity of his talk. The domination which he exerts in the\r\npulpit disappears in conversation; he is grave and gentle, speaks\r\nslowly and in a low tone; the depth of his melancholy gaze is in\r\nconsonance with a smile that is benevolent, but in no sense lively. He\r\nspeaks of God with love, of man with forbearance, of the interests of\r\nthe clergy with moderation, of the triumph of religion with ardour,\r\nof himself with modesty, and of the situation in general with wisdom;\r\nin short, he inspires confidence and esteem. He hardly ever leaves\r\nParis, and his chief task is now to keep together by constant efforts\r\nthe young people whom he has attracted and gathered by his brilliant\r\nlectures; he hears confessions practically only from men, but they\r\ncome to him in crowds, and last Easter Day the number of young men who\r\nwere present at the Sacrament was prodigious. Twelve pupils from the\r\nPolytechnic School in uniform were observed. Two years ago a rosary\r\nwas found in one of the corridors of the school: the pupils seized it,\r\nfastened it to the end of a pole, which they set up in the courtyard,\r\nand amid much laughter and mockery shouted, \"Let us see if the loser\r\nof this rosary will dare to claim it.\" One of the pupils then advanced\r\nand said firmly, \"The rosary is mine and I wish to have it back.\" He\r\nspoke with such simplicity and courage that no one replied to him by a\r\nlight word. From that day several followed his example, and now there\r\nare a dozen openly professing Catholics in the school.\r\n\r\nI am assured that the King has spoken with some vehemence against the\r\nProtestants and that he expressed his fear of them. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans, moved by prudence, diplomacy or conviction, has repeatedly\r\nsaid to the King since her widowhood began; \"You may be certain, Sire,\r\nthat I shall never become the female pope of the Protestants.\"\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, who came this morning to say farewell to me, told me that\r\nthe King would no longer be satisfied by the return of the Russian\r\nAmbassador to Paris; that he had resolved not to resume the equivocal\r\nrelations with the Emperor Nicholas which had subsisted since 1830 and\r\nthat an interchange of ambassadors would only take place if the\r\nEmperor wrote and addressed him as \"brother.\" M. Guizot takes to\r\nhimself the honour for the new step adopted by the King with reference\r\nto the European courts. He spoke to me at great length of the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans and the tenor of his remarks which I believe to be correct,\r\nwas as follows: he thinks her very clever, self-restrained, dignified,\r\ngraceful and a good manager; but she has a restless imagination,\r\nfeels the need for action and the desire to produce an effect, while\r\nher judgment is sometimes ill-balanced; she has also a certain tinge\r\nof German affectation and a tendency to preciosity of language, while\r\nher liberal tendencies are due to her Protestant sympathies and her\r\ndesire for popularity. As she feels herself cleverer than the Duc de\r\nNemours and knows that he is not ambitious, she has no fear of him,\r\nbut she is afraid of the King, who also mistrusts her mental attitude.\r\nHer relations with the Queen are by no means intimate and grow cooler\r\nevery day. She is on better terms with Madame Adélaïde and has one\r\nfriend in the family, the Prince de Joinville, who is truly an heroic\r\nnature, brilliant, undaunted, independent and bold, while he is very\r\nfond of his sister-in-law. The Duc d'Aumale, who is a capable and\r\ncourageous soldier, is behaving excellently in Africa and showing\r\nevery qualification for the position of Viceroy of Algeria which is in\r\nstore for him. The Duc de Montpensier, perhaps the cleverest of the\r\nKing's sons, is still very young and is of no account at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clermont-en-Argonne, May 21, 1843._--My journey has passed off\r\nwithout accident, but the weather is damp and unpleasant and the\r\ncountry looks very dreary; however, from this point onwards, it is\r\nmore diversified and wooded and corresponds to the description of the\r\nArgonne which I read at Baden some years ago. Travelling in a pretty\r\ncountry with some friend, in fine weather, with curiosity aroused and\r\nsatisfied, may certainly be charming, but to be transported in a box\r\non wheels without interest or attraction is the most foolish of all\r\nimaginable occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metz, May 22, 1843._--The church of Meaux is being restored and the\r\nhouses about it are being pulled down. Had it not been for the damp\r\nand for a slight indisposition which I feel, I should have gone in: I\r\nhave been anxious for so long a time to see the pulpit where Bossuet\r\npreached. I have finished the second volume of Walckenauer on Madame\r\nde Sévigné and prefer it to the first; it is cleverly written and the\r\ninterest is well sustained; new information is given upon a theme\r\nwhich seemed to be exhausted, information that has been collected with\r\ngreat trouble and is cleverly expounded. I gained a better\r\nunderstanding of the great trial of Fouquet from this book than from\r\nany other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saarbrück, May 23, 1843._--I am travelling terribly fast, am now\r\nbeyond the French frontier and shall soon cross another frontier in\r\nthe shape of the Rhine. Every stage that I pass saddens me and even a\r\npost painted black and white, or a brook is too much.\r\n\r\nI have read the first half of the first volume of M. de Custine's work\r\non Russia.[89] The preface is too metaphysical, though there is a\r\npassage on Protestantism and the so-called national and political\r\nchurches which is clever and striking; further there is a faithful\r\nportrait of the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia. I was especially\r\nstruck by two chapters composed of letters to the late Madame de\r\nCustine, the author's mother. A short account is given of this amiable\r\nwoman's heroic life: she was one of my friends and I have deeply\r\nregretted her; in point of age she might have been my mother and\r\nretained very little of her beauty when I knew her, but she had great\r\ncharm and every attractive quality. I have been constantly told that\r\nshe was a great coquette and I daresay this statement is true; she was\r\nleft a widow so young and was so pretty and so unguarded that such\r\nbehaviour was natural and excusable. The same behaviour was attributed\r\nto her at the time when I knew her; the fact may have been true, but\r\nher manner was reserved and quiet, she spoke modestly and her\r\nappearance was absolutely respectable. I saw her die without a murmur;\r\nin consequence, I am favourably, even indulgently disposed towards M.\r\nde Custine and his books, which are always clever, sometimes talented,\r\nand are very true when he writes of Russia. I do not think, however,\r\nthat he should publish so much truth when gratitude should order him\r\nto be silent, but men of letters will do anything. They are a class of\r\nwhom I think very little.\r\n\r\n  [89] M. de Custine had collected the memories of his journey in\r\n  Russia in a work in four volumes, entitled _Russia in 1839_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mannheim, May 24, 1843._--My slight indisposition makes me annoyed\r\nwith everything I do. M. de Custine's book is the only thing which\r\nseems to suit me; in spite of the affectation of the style and the\r\nbrilliancy which is obvious even where it rather diminishes than\r\nheightens the effect, and a constant attempt at display, the book\r\namuses and interests me. I do not know enough of the places or the\r\nfacts to check the accuracy of the narrative or descriptions, but by\r\ntradition or from my Russian acquaintances I am well enough informed\r\nto consider the resemblances perfect. His story, for instance of the\r\nthousands of workmen who were sacrificed in order to rebuild the\r\nImperial Winter Palace at St. Petersburg with undue rapidity, was\r\nrelated to me at Berlin. The plague of vermin at St. Petersburg,\r\nespecially of bugs, was also well known to me and the following\r\ninstance was told me by the Prince of Prussia at the marriage of his\r\nniece:[90] he said that the newly built palace was dried by excessive\r\nartificial heat and was so infested with vermin that the bride was\r\ndevoured the first night that she slept there and was obliged to\r\nappear at the entertainments covered with red marks. She changed her\r\nrooms the next day, but I am assured that the plague was very general,\r\nand that the best-kept houses are not exempt from it. This is to be\r\nexplained by the superheating and the way in which houses are\r\nhermetically sealed for nine months in the year.\r\n\r\n  [90] The reference is to the marriage of the Hereditary Grand\r\n  Duke of Russia, afterwards Alexander II., with the daughter of\r\n  the Grand Duke of Hesse Darmstadt, which was celebrated at St.\r\n  Petersburg on April 16, 1841.\r\n\r\nThe following message reached me from the Grand Duchess Stephanie and\r\nis very characteristic of her. It was a kind and even tender note in\r\nwhich she told me that she would call at ten o'clock and bring me back\r\nto lunch with her at eleven, after a drive to take advantage of the\r\nfine weather; and this though she knew that since Metz I have been in\r\nthe open air without a break. However, one must take people as they\r\nare and I should not care to show reluctance for the single day that I\r\nam here. Further, the weather is really very fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mannheim, May 25, 1843._--The Grand Duchess came for me yesterday\r\nmorning at ten o'clock. I found her much older and depressed. The same\r\npeople are with her; old Walsch, clever and tactless, who appears in\r\nthe evening, the Baroness Sturmfeder who gives a good appearance\r\nto the household, the excellent little Kageneck, the modest\r\nSchreckenstein and the old almoner. At dinner there were also Prince\r\nCharles of Solms, son-in-law of the Queen of Hanover and a Count\r\nHerding, of whom I have nothing to say. I was overwhelmed with\r\nquestions but I also allowed myself to ask a few. Princess Marie, or\r\nrather the Marchioness of Douglas is travelling in Italy and is deeply\r\nin love with her handsome husband who appears to answer all her\r\nwishes. I had full details of the wedding, the presents, the splendour\r\nof it and the settlements, etc. It was all very magnificent. The\r\ncouple are soon to come this way on their road to England and\r\nScotland. Princess Marie is thought to be with child. Lord Douglas\r\ntook her from Venice to Goritz, where she was very kindly received by\r\nthe illustrious exiles: while there she wrote to her mother saying\r\nthat the Duc de Bordeaux has a handsome face and is a pleasant talker,\r\nbut his figure is terribly heavy and he limps a great deal.\r\nMademoiselle, though very attractive, was too small and lacking in\r\ndistinction. The Grand Duchess will shortly pay a visit to her\r\ndaughter, Princess Wasa, who is living in the castle of Eichorn, two\r\nleagues from Brünn in Moravia. Prince Wasa insists upon a divorce: the\r\nPrincess will not consent and the Grand Duchess, who has every reason\r\nto fear a trial, wishes to induce her daughter not to run the risk and\r\nto come back to Mannhein here, though she is not personally enchanted\r\nwith the prospect, as she fears the unbalanced and troublesome\r\ncharacter of her daughter Louise. Prince Wasa has behaved very rudely\r\nto his mother-in-law and is, moreover, almost ruined. All this is a\r\ngreat anxiety to the Grand Duchess. She has given up the castle of\r\nBaden to the Grand Duke and bought his town house which she proposes\r\nto enlarge, to decorate and to beautify generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cologne, May 26, 1843._--I embarked this morning at Mayence where I\r\narrived yesterday morning in fine sun-light but also in a violent\r\nwind. Rain and hail soon alternated with the hurricane and the waves\r\nof the Rhine rose and became unpleasantly maritime in character. The\r\nGrand Duchess Stephanie told me that she thought the reputation of the\r\nRhine scenery exaggerated, and I am inclined to agree with her. The\r\nriver is beautiful and magnificently framed: the villages, the\r\nchurches, and the ruins surround it with historical recollections, it\r\nis true, but the lack of vegetation gives an unpleasant aridity to the\r\ncountry; however, the journey is interesting and even poetical if\r\nanybody is so minded. The castle of Stolzenfels, as seen from the\r\nboat, is pretty but by no means grandiose; this is a castle which the\r\nKing of Prussia has just restored and enlarged so that he was able to\r\nstay there with sixty people on his last visit; the interior is said\r\nto be charming and to command an excellent view. As for Rheinstein\r\nwhich Prince Frederick has laid out, it is quite a small place: it can\r\nonly be approached on horseback, whereas it is possible to drive up to\r\nStolzenfels. The several communes which owned old ruined castles on\r\nthe Rhine have presented them to different princes of the house of\r\nPrussia: thus, apart from Stolzenfels, which belongs to the King, and\r\nRheinstein, which belongs to Prince Frederick, the Prince of Prussia\r\nhas received a castle, as also has Prince Charles, and even the Queen\r\nhas her own. They are all on the left bank and the King has ordered\r\nthe new owners to restore them and make them habitable. The castle of\r\nHornbach, where Young Germany held its revolutionary meetings, before\r\nthe establishment of the Commission of Mayence, is on the right bank\r\nand in the Bavarian states: the King of Bavaria has just presented it\r\nto his son, the Prince Royal; he has changed its name and it is now\r\ncalled Maxburg.\r\n\r\nI made some progress to-day with the second volume of M. de Custine.\r\nHe reports conversations which he had with the Emperor and Empress,\r\nwhich are graceful and lively, but were inspired by the idea that they\r\nwould be printed. As I read all these I wondered if a traveller who\r\nowes his magnificent entertainment to the fear of his judgment as an\r\nauthor, to the desire that he may show his hosts kindness in his book,\r\nand avoid any partiality in his descriptions, is bound by the same\r\ndegree of gratitude as the traveller who is well treated from\r\ndisinterested motives, merely because his character happens to please.\r\nI admit that my judgment in this respect wavers a little and though in\r\nany case I should think a delicate discretion preferable, I cannot\r\nhelp finding some excuse for a man who thinks himself less entirely\r\nbound by interested politeness than he would be by spontaneous\r\nkindness. In any case the imperial conversations are described in a\r\nsufficiently laudatory style: the most unfettered and critical mind is\r\nalways more or less influenced by marks of condescension from a crown.\r\nNone the less this work will cause profound dissatisfaction in Russia\r\nand the welcome given to travellers will certainly be colder and more\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Iserlohn, May 27, 1843._--I left Cologne this morning without\r\nregretting the inn of Rheinsberg. All these inns on the banks of the\r\nRhine are nicely situated. They contain furniture of inlaid wood, and\r\nstuffed sofas with pretty coverings; but their proximity to the water\r\nand their exposed position make them very cold. The want of fireplaces\r\nis displeasing, as wind and damp have an easier entrance owing to the\r\nlack of shutters and blinds. In the month of May the double windows\r\nhave been removed, and I really regret them. Daylight, which arrives\r\nbefore four o'clock, and cannot be excluded, leads to untimely waking,\r\nand is an inconvenience at which I grumbled the more as the noise of\r\nforty-five steamboats, the bells which announced their departure and\r\nthe clatter of the stokers, make an uproar which lasts for nearly\r\ntwenty-four hours; then there is the noise made by people coming and\r\ngoing in the inn, and the combination is enough to make one ill. Had\r\nit not been for the rain, I should have gone this morning to the\r\nCathedral to see how far our subscriptions--for I have also\r\nsubscribed--have advanced the work upon this fine monument during the\r\nlast three years; but the weather was so bad, and I felt so worn out\r\nby the most execrable little German bed in all its Teutonic purity,\r\nthat I had no courage to get wet in order to satisfy my curiosity,\r\nand re-entered my carriage in a bad temper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassel, May 28, 1843._--It rained hard all last night, and is raining\r\nstill. The outlook is melancholy and depressing. To-day I am going to\r\nGöttingen, to-morrow to Brunswick, and the day after to-morrow to\r\nHarbke. I shall be interested to see Brunswick, which I do not know,\r\nand Göttingen, whose turbulent students and liberal professors have so\r\noften roused the wrath of the King of Hanover.\r\n\r\nI am still immersed in M. de Custine. In the third volume there is a\r\nletter concerning Princess Trubetzkoi,[91] who followed her husband to\r\nthe mines of Siberia with noble devotion. The effects are so striking\r\nthat no rhetoric is required to make them impressive. Conscious of\r\nthis fact, the author has increased the impressiveness of this\r\nterrible drama in its last phase by simplifying his style. The scene\r\nwhich concludes this unusual story of misfortune moved me deeply. In\r\nmy youth I heard many stories of Siberia from my father, and for that\r\nreason, I suppose, I feel a keen sympathy with the unfortunate\r\nwretches who are there buried alive.\r\n\r\n  [91] Prince Sergius Trubetzkoi, when very young, had taken an\r\n  active part in a conspiracy which broke out at St. Petersburg in\r\n  1825 with reference to the right of the Emperor Nicholas to the\r\n  throne of Russia. He was accused of usurping the crown from his\r\n  brother Constantine. Condemned to death by the Supreme Court of\r\n  Justice, the punishment was commuted to perpetual exile in\r\n  Siberia. There he was obliged to work in the mines as a convict.\r\n  The Emperor Nicholas remained inflexible throughout his life, and\r\n  would never pardon the conspirator against his person, who was\r\n  not released until 1855 by Alexander II. on his accession to the\r\n  throne. Princess Trubetzkoi, urged by passionate devotion,\r\n  followed her husband into exile, and her action was regarded as\r\n  the more heroic, as the married couple had previously lived on\r\n  somewhat cold terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brunswick, May 29, 1843._--Nothing but rain with occasional bursts of\r\nhail, and by way of diversion a miserable ray of sunlight which steals\r\nshamefully forth to announce a new storm. Brunswick is an old and\r\nrather ugly town, with large and gloomy houses, an old church in full\r\nGothic style, and a town hall even more Gothic. It is a great relief\r\nto find something really old after a succession of little capitals\r\nrebuilt without character or historical memory, with their tawdry\r\nmodern ornamentation. I noticed a magnificent breed of post horses\r\nand draught and military horses; they are splendid, strong and\r\nvigorous animals; I do not know whether the district produces them or\r\nif they are brought from Mecklenburg.\r\n\r\nWhen any one's memory is as full of your stories of the United States\r\nas mine is,[92] and when one reads the stories of M. de Custine\r\nconcerning Russia, it is difficult to say which of the two countries\r\nseems the more objectionable, as their bad points are so precisely in\r\ncontradiction; but with regard to the Russians, I think I forgot to\r\ntell you an incident which might very well find a place in M. de\r\nCustine's quotations. When I was recently in Paris for the last time,\r\nI called upon my niece, Madame de Lazareff, to say good-bye. She said\r\nto me, \"You have quite an imperial countenance this morning, aunt.\" I\r\ndid not understand, and told her so. \"Oh,\" she replied, \"at St.\r\nPetersburg, when any one looks particularly well, that is what we\r\nsay.\" Is not that excellent?\r\n\r\n  [92] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harbke, May 31, 1843._--I left Brunswick yesterday morning, but the\r\njourney here took a great deal of time, and caused me many screams of\r\nterror. To begin with, even the highroads in the Duchy of Brunswick\r\nare far from admirable, while Harbke is at the end of a horrible\r\ncross-road. The terrible rains of the last few days have ruined the\r\nroads to such an extent that I really thought we should stick fast.\r\nWhen I arrived, I found the poor old master of the house[93] ill, and\r\nhis wife in great anxiety. I was anxious to start again at once in\r\norder not to embarrass them at such a time, but neither Frau von\r\nVeltheim nor the invalid himself would hear of this plan; so I shall\r\nstart to-morrow very early, and reach Berlin, if God wills, in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n  [93] Count Veltheim (1781-1848).\r\n\r\nThis place is very well arranged for a German château. It is of\r\nconsiderable extent, and would have some style if the old building had\r\nnot been modernised instead of being left as it was. The garden is\r\nwell kept and adjoins beautiful woods. The mistress of the house has\r\nno children, and is devoted to flowers and birds, even to some noisy\r\ncockatoos; she is scrupulously neat, and is aged sixty-two: a tall,\r\nthin, pale figure, she is always dressed in white muslin: and her\r\nlace caps and her shawls, all tied with white ribbons, give her a\r\nsomewhat ghostly appearance. The Veltheim family is most noble and\r\nancient, and the members are well aware of the fact; she is a Bülow.\r\nCount Veltheim's first wife, from whom he is divorced, is now Countess\r\nPutbus, the mother of Countess Lottum, and of the young Putbus who\r\ndied at Carlsruhe. The Veltheims are very wealthy, and a certain note\r\nof opulence prevails in the house where, however, the useful and the\r\nagreeable are in very close conjunction. There is no view, as the\r\ncastle is built in a hollow and overlooked by wooded hills. From the\r\ntop of one of these hills the Hartz mountains can be seen distinctly\r\non the horizon, while the Brocken, where Goethe placed the\r\nsupernatural scenes of _Faust_, stands out very clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magdeburg, June 1, 1843._--A most annoying incident has just\r\nhappened; I have missed the train for Berlin which I hoped to reach\r\nthis evening, and I ought to be very satisfied that I have got so far\r\nsafe and sound; to cover thirteen leagues, the distance from Harbke to\r\nthis town, I was obliged to spend ten hours on the road. The\r\ncontinuous deluge of the last few days and the waterspouts which have\r\nburst over the country, have devastated everything, swollen the\r\nstreams, carried away the dykes, swept away earth, &c. Nothing can\r\ndescribe my anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 2, 1843._--At length I have reached the first\r\nhalting-place on my long and tiresome journey. I have arrived\r\nliterally at the end of my resources, with a ragged dress, reduced to\r\nmy last crown and so exhausted that I feel as if I had spinal\r\ncurvature. The railway from Magdeburg here is very well managed and\r\nthe journey is accomplished in eight hours, though the line is not\r\ndirect, as the railway passes through Dessau and Wittenberg. I did as\r\nI have done on board the steamers and remained in my own carriage:\r\nthis seemed to me the most suitable plan, as I had no male companion\r\nand a very mixed number of people were travelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 3, 1843._--The Duchesse d'Albuféra writes to say that\r\nPrincesse Clémentine went to Brest to embark for Lisbon and Brittany\r\nwhere she was excellently received; while good news has arrived from\r\nthe Prince de Joinville and the Duc d'Aumale is distinguishing himself\r\nin Algeria. The Duchesse de Montmorency tells me of an extraordinary\r\nincident: Madame de Dolomieu has sold for thirty-five thousand francs\r\ncertain autograph letters by living writers in which there are some\r\nthat could only be circulated with unpleasant consequences. The King\r\nof France bought back his letters for twenty-five thousand francs.\r\nReally impudence at the present time knows no bounds! General Fagel\r\nforced Madame de Dolomieu to buy back for eight hundred francs a\r\nletter from the King of the Low Countries which he had given her and\r\nwhich she had sold with the collection.\r\n\r\nThe author of the tragedy of _Lucrèce_, M. Ponsard, and the author of\r\nthe tragedy of _Judith_, Madame Emile de Girardin, whose plays have\r\nmet with such different receptions, came across one another at the\r\nhouse of the Duchesse de Gramont. Madame de Girardin was bursting with\r\nrage, in a manner said to be absolutely grotesque.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 4, 1843._--Yesterday I saw the Countess of Reede. The\r\nold and agreeable lady, who always treats me as her daughter, received\r\nme with open arms and soon put me in possession of all current news.\r\nShe is at the head of the faction hostile to Princesse Albert, who has\r\ngone to Silesia. Her position here is abominable, and though the King\r\nhas so far supported her as not to allow his son to divorce her, the\r\nPrincess feels herself entirely out of place in society and at the\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nI went to tea with the Princess of Prussia. Her husband was there and\r\nhas grown stout, and I am sorry to see how she has changed, as the\r\nbeauty of which I thought so much has disappeared. As she is young and\r\nstrong, I hope that her freshness will return.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 5, 1843._--Yesterday was a day of hard work. First came\r\nSunday mass; then I went home for a long business talk with Herr von\r\nWurmb and Herr von Wolff, and then went to Madame de Perponcher, and\r\nthen to the Werthers; they are to see their son again to-day who is\r\nPrussian Minister at Berne. I then called upon Lady Westmoreland, who\r\nhad just heard that one of her sons, whom she had left in England, was\r\nseriously ill. Finally, I went to the Radziwills.\r\n\r\nI dined with the Princess of Prussia. The other guests were the Prince\r\nand Princess William, the uncle and aunt, their son who has come back\r\nfrom Brazil, the Werthers, Countess Neale, the Radziwills, Prince\r\nPückler-Muskau, and Max von Hatzfeldt. It was a fine and splendid\r\ndinner in the prettiest palace in the world, but the stormy weather\r\nmade every one ill. I did not know Prince Pückler, who has been able\r\nto recover favour at Court,[94] at any rate to some extent, in the\r\nfollowing way: The Prince of Prussia was anxious to improve his park\r\nat Babelsberg in Potsdam, and told his gardener to write to the\r\ngardener of Muskau, requesting him to obtain a few weeks leave from\r\nhis master to come and lay out the garden of Babelsberg. The Prince of\r\nPrussia then received a letter from Prince Pückler, telling him that\r\nthe real gardener of Muskau was himself, and that he was starting\r\nforthwith for Babelsberg for a consultation with the Prince's\r\ngardener. When he arrived he undertook the whole of the gardener's\r\nbusiness and began to lay out walks, clumps of trees, &c. Some days\r\nafterwards the Prince of Prussia found him hard at work, and naturally\r\nthanked him, asked him to dinner, and now he has become quite the\r\nfashion. He told me that he was starting to-day for Muskau, asked me\r\nto pay a visit to his park when I was at Sagan, and offered his help\r\nin laying out the park of Sagan.\r\n\r\n  [94] Prince Pückler in his works had shown an independence and\r\n  boldness of judgment which, in conjunction with his liberal\r\n  ideas, seemed far too advanced for so retrograde a court as that\r\n  of Prussia, and had obliged him to absent himself.\r\n\r\nM. and Madame Bresson called for me later on and took me to the opera,\r\nwhere _Robert le Diable_ was performed, and conducted by Meyerbeer\r\nhimself. The performance was excellent, but the heat was frightful.\r\nMany people came into our box, including Maurice Esterhazy, who seemed\r\nto me somewhat depressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 6, 1843._--I have had a call from Humboldt, who said\r\nthat two years hence there would be a national representative assembly\r\nsitting at Berlin, that it would be at first consultative and\r\nafterwards deliberative.\r\n\r\nI am struck by the animation of Berlin since it has become a railway\r\ncentre. The population has increased by fifty thousand people and the\r\ndevelopment of manufacture and luxury is very marked. The following is\r\na curious little anecdote: Upon the death of the Duc d'Orléans the\r\nEmpress of Russia and the Prince of Prussia, who were at St.\r\nPetersburg, attempted to persuade the Emperor to take the opportunity\r\nof writing directly to King Louis-Philippe; he refused, but told the\r\nEmpress that he would authorise her to write to the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans. The two Princesses had known one another formerly in\r\nGermany, and were on such intimate terms as to speak in the second\r\nperson singular; the Empress wrote in German, using this form; she\r\nreceived a somewhat cold answer in French from which it was absent.\r\nThe Empress was much hurt, and complained to her aunt, the Princess\r\nWilliam of Prussia, sister of the Dowager Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenburg; the Empress asserts that it is very rude to reply in\r\nanother language than that used by the first correspondent, and that\r\nif the Duchesse d'Orléans thought it her duty to use only the language\r\nof her children's country, she, the Empress, would do the same next\r\ntime and would write in Russian.\r\n\r\nI have seen M. Bresson, who told me that recently, in a club at St.\r\nPetersburg, the Emperor spoke to the French Chargé d'Affaires, and\r\nasked, \"When is M. Barante coming back?\"\r\n\r\nI dined with the Wolffs. There were also present, Count Alvensleben,\r\nFinance Minister; Herr von Olfers, Director of the Museum; Huden, the\r\nCouncillor of State; and Barry, who is the first doctor in Berlin\r\nafter Schönlein. I then went to Lady Westmoreland, whom I found very\r\nold and much changed, but witty and pleasant as ever. She told me that\r\nLord Jersey was inconsolable on account of Sarah's marriage with\r\nNicholas Esterhazy, who, however, is happy so far. Old Lord\r\nWestmoreland has treated his son as badly as possible in his will,\r\nand Lady Georgina Fane, far from showing her brother any kindness, as\r\nhas been said, insisted upon the prompt execution of the will with\r\nsuch severity that the Westmorelands would be in serious difficulty\r\nwere it not for their post in Berlin. When I left Lady Westmoreland I\r\ncalled on Countess Neale, one of my oldest acquaintances in this\r\nworld; I found her alone, and we spent a long time talking of our\r\nyoung days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 9, 1843._--Yesterday I dined with the Princess of\r\nPrussia; she is really a very interesting character, and her regular\r\nkindness to myself and her increasing confidence, make me ever more\r\nattached to herself and her fortunes. I am anxious for her health, and\r\nI fear that she is right in regarding it as seriously affected. There\r\nwas a numerous company at her dinner: Princess Charles, her sister; my\r\ntwo nephews Biron; the Prince of Wurtemberg, the youngest of the\r\nbrothers of the Grand Duchess Helena; the latter told me that the\r\nGrand Duke Michael was shortly to reach Marienbad, and from thence\r\nwould go to England. The King of Hanover was taken ill in the course\r\nof his journey to England, and was unable to reach London for the\r\nbaptism; he is said to be in a very bad state and overcome with the\r\nidea, which is probably correct, that he is going to die. This notion\r\nhas taken a strong hold of his mind, as a prophecy was made to him\r\nthat he would die in the year in which his son was married.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 11, 1843._--Yesterday I went to Charlottenburg to visit\r\nthe mausoleum of the late king, by the side of the late queen's tomb.\r\nThe chapel has been enlarged, but the general effect is lost and I was\r\nnot pleased, although the altar of black and white marble is one of\r\nthe prettiest things I have ever seen. The walls are covered with\r\nBible texts which the present King himself chose, painted in golden\r\nletters upon sky-blue scrolls; the effect is somewhat Moorish; the\r\ngeneral appearance is by no means Christian. Protestant architecture\r\nis certainly dry both in outward form, in its general worship, and in\r\nthe essence of its mutable doctrines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 14, 1843._--Yesterday, after dining by the chair of the\r\nCountess of Reede, her daughter, Madame de Perponcher, took me round\r\nthe grand rooms in the castle to show me the Rittersaal which the King\r\nhas just restored. Some curious portraits and some furniture dating\r\nfrom the Great Elector give a certain interest to these rooms though\r\nupon the whole they are very moderate. We left the Countess to go to\r\nthe German Comedy Theatre where we saw an excellent performance of\r\n_Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle_,[95] for translations from the French\r\nstage are continually played in Germany.\r\n\r\n  [95] This play, by Alexandre Dumas père, was then given at the\r\n  Theatre Royal of Berlin (Schauspielhaus) from the German\r\n  translation by L. Osten.\r\n\r\nA historical novel has just appeared which is quite the rage here,\r\ncalled _The Moor_,[96] and deals with the period of Gustavus III. The\r\nauthor, who has been many years in Sweden, had access to the archives\r\nof the realm, and the documents which he quotes are authentic. People\r\nhere say that a negro actually lived at the court of Queen Ulrica and\r\nthat most of the characters and incidents of the novel are true. I am\r\nreading it with much interest; as I knew the Baron of Arnfelt in my\r\nyouth (in fact, he taught me to read) I am particularly interested in\r\nanything relating to him. M. de Talleyrand also spoke to me often of\r\nGustavus III., of whom he saw a great deal at the time of his second\r\nvisit to Paris when he was returning from Rome. The King of Sweden at\r\nthat time had gained the ear of the Pope to such an extent that he\r\nthought he could easily obtain the cardinal's hat for one of his\r\nfriends. He suggested that M. de Talleyrand should present his\r\nrequest, but the favour was declined, as the equivocal reputation of\r\nGustavus III. would have given the request an unpleasant\r\ncolouring.[97] At the same time the Princesse de Carignan,[98] the\r\ngrandmother of the present King of Sardinia, who was strongly\r\nattracted by M. de Talleyrand (at that time he was Abbé of Périgord,\r\nbefore he became Bishop of Autun), thought herself also sufficiently\r\ninfluential at Rome to secure the necessary dispensations which would\r\nhave enabled my uncle to marry her if he became a layman. M. de\r\nTalleyrand has often told me as one of the strangest incidents of his\r\nlife that he was thus simultaneously involved in two contradictory\r\nprojects, both requiring the sanction of the court of Rome; he also\r\ntold me that Gustavus III. was a very clever and agreeable character.\r\n\r\n  [96] This novel, _Der Mohr oder das Haus Holstein-Gattorp in\r\n  Schweden_, which appeared anonymously, takes as its hero a negro\r\n  named Badin, who is said to have been actually brought from\r\n  Africa to Sweden during his youth in 1751.\r\n\r\n  [97] William III., who had been at Rome in 1771 as Crown Prince,\r\n  returned to that city after his accession in 1783. Pius VI. was\r\n  then Pope, and received the King with the greatest kindness. In\r\n  June 1784 Gustavus III. came to Paris to revisit Queen Marie\r\n  Antoinette, to whom he was greatly attached.\r\n\r\n  [98] The Princesse de Carignan, the grandmother of King Charles\r\n  Albert, was a Princess Joséphine of Lorraine and a sister of the\r\n  charming Princesse Charlotte, the Abbess of Remiremont, for whom\r\n  M. de Talleyrand felt so profound an affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 15, 1843._--M. de Talleyrand arrived here the day before\r\nyesterday. We dined at the house of the Radziwills with M. Bresson who\r\ntold me of the marriage of the Prince de Joinville. He is marrying a\r\nBrazilian princess who is pretty and lovable with a dowry of four\r\nmillion francs.\r\n\r\nWe spent the rest of the evening with the Princess of Prussia who was\r\nalone with her husband. I am sorry to think that this kind Princess\r\nwill not be here on my return on the 23rd: she is starting for Weimar\r\non the 20th and is to spend the summer with her mother. I feel very\r\nanxious about her health and spirits which are greatly depressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 16, 1843._--Yesterday I went with the Countess Neale to\r\nPotsdam by railway, to dine at Glienicke with Princess Charles of\r\nPrussia. The weather was rather cold but dry and clear. Prince\r\nAdalbert of Prussia who has just come back from Brazil was also there.\r\nHe had seen the Princesse de Joinville at Rio de Janeiro and spoke of\r\nher as very pretty and pleasant; for the sake of the young Prince I am\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I saw Madame Chreptowitz, _née_ Nesselrode, who is\r\ncoming from St. Petersburg on her way to Naples where her husband has\r\nbeen appointed Chargé d'Affaires. She says that M. de Custine's book\r\nis quite the rage at St. Petersburg, and rage is the correct term, for\r\nthe book rouses the Russians to fearful wrath. They assert that it is\r\nfull of falsehoods. The Emperor reads it attentively, speaks of it\r\ndisdainfully, and is really disgusted with it. An amusing incident in\r\nreference to this subject, is the statement of Madame de Meyendorff,\r\nthe wife of the Russian minister at Berlin, who loudly declares that\r\nthe book is as true as it is amusing and says she hopes that it will\r\nteach the Russians to be less conceited.\r\n\r\nHerr von Liebermann, Prussian Minister at St. Petersburg, who is also\r\nhere on his way to Carlsbad, told me yesterday that his health and\r\nspirits had suffered severely at St. Petersburg and that he would be\r\ndead if he had not obtained leave of absence. The fact is that he\r\nlooks very ill, in spite of his bloated appearance, and seems to be\r\nquite disgusted with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe King of Denmark has announced that he will visit the King of\r\nPrussia in the island of Rügen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 17, 1843._--I arrived here this morning. I am staying in\r\na pretty house opposite the castle where my father's chief agent used\r\nto live. I found a courier there who had come over from Muskau, asking\r\nme to go there and meet the Prince of Prussia. I shall therefore\r\nreturn to Berlin by way of Muskau and spend a day there.\r\n\r\nIn company with Herr von Wolff I drove round part of my new\r\nacquisition, including the forest, and was delighted by the stags and\r\nroe deer which came round the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 19, 1843._--Yesterday was Sunday and I went to high mass\r\nin a very pretty church in the town. The service was choral and was\r\nvery tolerably performed. Then I went to the castle to examine the\r\nbooks and other objects which, however, are by no means valuable and\r\nwhich I have bought with the rest of the fief. This transaction\r\nsomewhat confuses my position towards my nephew the Prince of\r\nHohenzollern, and produces a very disagreeable mixture of meum and\r\ntuum, which I shall bring to an end as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went to the little church where my sister is buried and\r\nhad mass said on her behalf. I explained to an architect the\r\nrestoration which I desired to make in this church. On leaving it I\r\npaid a visit to the schools, the shelters and the factories. I then\r\nreturned to dinner with the officers of the artillery battery and\r\ngarrison here; they had invited the Prefect and several other persons\r\nfrom the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muskau, June 20, 1843._--I could write a long account of this\r\nhousehold and can say at once that it has an individuality of its own.\r\nI left Sagan this morning at about nine o'clock and arrived here at\r\none o'clock. The road is not bad, though near Muskau a sea of sand\r\nbegins which reduces speed almost to the point of immobility. It is\r\ntherefore a double surprise to drive through the freshest and greenest\r\nof parks, as full of flowers and as carefully tended as can be\r\nimagined. It is quite like England, with all its care and comfort\r\nexpended both without and within the castle. A very noble flight of\r\nstairs bordered by fine orange-trees leads to the castle court which\r\nwould be modern in style if it were not for the towers crowned by\r\nbelfries, which give it an imposing aspect not to be found in modern\r\nedifices. At the foot of the stairs I found Prince Pückler surrounded\r\nby footmen, lacqueys, Arabs and negroes, a very strange and motley\r\ntroop. He immediately conducted me to my room which is most luxurious;\r\na sitting-room full of flowers, a bedroom draped with white muslin,\r\nand a dressing-room in a tower; even my servants say they have never\r\nbeen so well lodged. The Prince of Prussia has been detained at Berlin\r\non business and will not arrive until to-morrow. Princess Carolath,\r\nstep-daughter of Prince Pückler, came to apologise for the absence of\r\nher mother, Princess Pückler, who was not quite well and had not yet\r\nfinished dressing. Shortly afterwards she came in: she is very\r\npleasant, extremely distinguished and talks most admirably upon every\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAmong the strange inhabitants of this castle is a very tiny little\r\ndwarf,[99] no taller than a child of four, perfectly proportioned and\r\ndressed as a Pole. He is nineteen years of age and is much petted and\r\ndressed up; he seems happy, though he made a very sad impression on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n  [99] The famous \"Billy,\" as the Prince's friends called him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muskau, June 21, 1843._--The close of yesterday was spoilt by a cold,\r\nsharp and gusty wind which suddenly arose to sadden the country and\r\nfreeze poor mortal frames after three days warm weather. After dinner\r\nI looked over the rest of the house. Everything is very nice, though\r\nthe proportions within are by no means upon a vast scale: flowers have\r\nbeen very artistically used for decoration and give a special beauty\r\nto the rooms; the Princess's room resembles a hothouse and an aviary\r\nat the same time. I was especially struck by a portrait of the Prince\r\nfastened to the Princess's desk round which laurel branches were\r\nartistically placed: they belong to two laurels which stand in pots on\r\neither side of the desk; a little vase of forget-me-nots was placed\r\nbetween the portrait and the writing pad. This is one of the thousand\r\ndetails in this union which was broken off and restored and which is\r\nquite unparalleled; for though in society one may often meet people\r\nwho have separated but have not been divorced, it is much more unusual\r\nto meet divorced people who have not been separated.[100]\r\n\r\n  [100] Princess Pückler was divorced in 1817 by Count Charles von\r\n  Pappenheim and married Hermann Pückler in the same year. They\r\n  were divorced in 1826 because Prince Pückler, who was almost\r\n  ruined by his wild extravagance, wished to marry a rich English\r\n  woman, a Miss Harriet Hamlet. This project failed, and the Prince\r\n  and his wife, though legally divorced, began life again very\r\n  happily under the same roof, though they were not remarried.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disagreeable cold and the bitter wind which would have\r\nexcused a fire, we went for a drive round the park in an open\r\ncarriage. Prince Pückler sat by my side, to act as showman to this\r\nextraordinary estate. In England it would be fine and here it is\r\nmarvellous. He has created not merely a park but a country: sandy\r\nplains, white and dusty hills, have been changed into verdant slopes\r\nand fresh green lawns; superb trees rise upon every side, clumps of\r\nflowers frame the castle; a pretty stream brightens the whole and the\r\ntown of Muskau gives interest to the landscape which is rich,\r\ndiversified and full of beauty; yet, throughout this drive which\r\nlasted for two hours, Prince Pückler would talk of nothing but his\r\ndesire to sell this fair creation. He would like the Prince of Prussia\r\nto buy it: he says that as he has finished his work, he feels no more\r\ninterest in it, and like a painter who has finished his picture, he\r\nwould like to begin another in a better climate; he tells me he is\r\nthinking of South Germany about the Black Forest and the confines of\r\nSwitzerland. The Princess does not hide her sorrow at this idea and I\r\ncan understand her feelings, for she has lived here for twenty-five\r\nyears and the interior of the castle is her work; moreover, she has\r\ndiscovered a mineral spring on the spot, which has suggested the\r\nerection of a watering establishment. This idea has been carried out\r\nand the building in the park looks charming.\r\n\r\nTo return to Prince Pückler, he is not what I had expected him to be:\r\nhe speaks but little, in a low voice, and whether he feels that I am\r\nill-inclined to gossip and scandal, or whether he reserves his own\r\npowers in this direction for his writings, his conversation shows no\r\ntrace of them. He rather gives me the idea of a man who is tired and\r\nbored than of a bad character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muskau, June 22, 1843._--I had proposed to start this morning, but\r\nthe Prince of Prussia told me so graciously that he could not allow me\r\nto leave Muskau before himself, that a refusal would have been\r\nchurlish, the more so as Princess Pückler seemed very anxious that I\r\nshould stay. Here one is allowed to remain in one's room in sloth\r\nuntil midday, which suits my habits excellently. When I went\r\ndownstairs yesterday to the drawing-room, the Prince of Prussia, who\r\nhad arrived at nine o'clock in the morning, was already coming in from\r\na walk. After lunch the Princess displayed many curiosities which her\r\nhusband had brought home; books, frames, models of the Holy Sepulchre,\r\nrosaries and crosses in mother of pearl beautifully worked in\r\nPalestine, Arab paintings, arms and instruments of all kinds. In the\r\nlibrary we were shown a manuscript on vellum with painted vignettes of\r\n_Froissart's Chronicle_. Something of everything is to be found in\r\nthis curious house, which is full of contrasts. In the afternoon the\r\nmen went out again for a long excursion and the ladies walked about\r\nthe gardens, which well deserve to be examined in detail, so\r\nmarvellous is the labour expended upon them, though attention to\r\ndetail has in no way destroyed the general effect. Afterwards we\r\nentered a carriage and reaching a large field covered with people, we\r\nstopped to see the Arab and Egyptian horses of Prince Pückler\r\nparading, curvetting and galloping. They were ridden by men in\r\nOriental dress, and it was a bright and pretty spectacle. Tea was\r\nserved in one of the lounge rooms of the bathing establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 24, 1843._--On arriving here I found letters which will\r\nfurther modify my movements. My sister Acerenza is ill, and her doctor\r\nhas insisted so strongly upon Carlsbad that she is going there with my\r\nother sister on July 1; so, on leaving here I shall go to Carlsbad,\r\ntogether with my son, who has been ordered to take the waters.\r\n\r\nI must say another word concerning the conclusion of my stay in the\r\nfairyland of Muskau. On Thursday, the 22nd, after lunch, every one\r\nwent up to see Prince Pückler's rooms: there are four of them, full of\r\npictures, sculptures, engravings, books, manuscripts, heathen and\r\nChristian curiosities, curiosities from Asia, Barbary and Egypt; a\r\npretty model of the foot of his Abyssinian woman[101] is on his desk\r\nby the side of his wife's portrait; a model of the Holy Sepulchre\r\nhangs by a stuffed crocodile; a portrait of Frederick the Great is\r\nconfronted by that of Napoleon, and the picture of M. de Talleyrand is\r\nside by side with one of Pius VII. There are inscriptions on all the\r\ndoors in the style of Jean Paul. Amid all this miscellany there seems\r\nto be some attempt at order, in which the hand of the master of the\r\nrooms is apparent; in any case they contain interest of every kind.\r\nAfter this inspection we went to tea in a shooting-box in the midst of\r\na most beautiful forest. The Prince of Prussia had a shot at a stag,\r\nwhich he killed. We returned after nightfall, and after supper the\r\nPrince of Prussia was present at a torchlight parade of the military\r\nreserves. This was followed by a walk through the park, which was\r\nilluminated by Bengal lights, so cleverly placed behind the trees and\r\nthe clumps of flowers, that the fires could only be inferred from the\r\neffect which they produced; these effects were really magical, and I\r\nhad never seen anything of the kind. The Prince of Prussia left Muskau\r\nthe night before last at two o'clock, and I followed him yesterday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n  [101] This Abyssinian woman was called Machbouba. Prince Pückler\r\n  had brought her back with him from his travels. She could not\r\n  bear the northern climate, and died at Muskau after embracing the\r\n  Catholic religion at Vienna through the influence of Princess\r\n  Metternich, who took a keen interest in Machbouba.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 25, 1843._--Yesterday I went to an evening party given\r\nby the Radziwills. There I met Humboldt who had just returned from the\r\nisland of Rügen, concerning which he was most enthusiastic: he also\r\nspoke very warmly of the residence of Prince Putbus, who was able to\r\nreceive the two Kings of Prussia and Denmark without any necessity for\r\nhimself or his wife to change their usual mode of life.[102] The King\r\nof Denmark seems to be greatly disturbed as to what will become of his\r\nkingdom after his death. His son is such a bad and even insane\r\ncharacter that his succession is practically impossible; moreover, he\r\nill-treats his wife dreadfully and has no children. Hence there is an\r\nidea that Denmark will be divided; that the islands and Jutland will\r\ngo to a Prince of Hesse-Cassel, and that claims for Holstein and\r\nSchleswig will be raised from very different quarters; Russia will\r\nraise claims, and as Germany is especially anxious to see that Russia\r\ngains no footing there, the two Kings have apparently been trying to\r\navoid any invasion of the kind. An attempt will be made to overthrow\r\nall claims by marrying a Prince of Holstein-Glücksburg with one of the\r\nGrand Duchesses of Russia.\r\n\r\n  [102] On June 17, 1843, the King of Denmark, Christian VIII.,\r\n  disembarked at Putbus, where the King of Prussia was awaiting\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 26, 1843._--Yesterday I dined with the Russian Minister\r\ntogether with M. de Valençay, and saw in full detail my old\r\nhouse,[103] which is much improved; but it was very pretty in its\r\noriginal form, and if I had it now nothing would induce me to sell it.\r\n\r\n  [103] The house of Courlande at Berlin, No. 7 _Unter den Linden_,\r\n  formed part of the fortune which the Duchesse de Talleyrand\r\n  received on her father's death. The Duchesse sold this house,\r\n  through her architect, in 1839, for ninety-five thousand thalers.\r\n  The Emperor Nicholas bought it, and as the proprietor he gained\r\n  the title of Honorary Citizen of Berlin. Apartments for the\r\n  Emperor and his family were reserved in it, and it was then\r\n  appropriated by the Russian Legation, which is still there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 29, 1843._--Yesterday M. de Valençay and myself\r\ntravelled to Potsdam by the railway, and the King's carriage took us\r\nto Sans Souci. The King came in for dinner after a Council which had\r\nlasted five hours and was concerned with the increasing difficulties\r\nin the states of the Rhine provinces. Apparently the King could not\r\nagree with his Ministers upon the policy to be adopted; in any case he\r\nmust have been greatly pre-occupied, for he was by no means in his\r\nnatural humour. Besides M. de Valençay and myself the guests included\r\nthe Ministers, the officers on duty, an old gentleman, one Pourtalès\r\nof Neuchâtel, Humboldt and Rönne, but the dinner was very slow. The\r\nKing has grown stout, which was not necessary in his case; he is also\r\nchanged by age and his colour is too high; I did not think he was\r\nlooking by any means so well as I could wish. After dinner all the\r\nguests returned to Berlin except my son, Humboldt and myself. We were\r\nasked to stay for a drive. I was given a room which the King has just\r\nfitted up and which looks as though it belonged to a novel of the date\r\nof Frederick II. The strange feature of the room is that in 1807 when\r\nthe King was a child at Memel he dreamt one night of a room in this\r\nstyle, and as he remembered his dream he has realised it. The wood is\r\npainted in very light green: all the mouldings, which are in the style\r\nof Louis XV., are gilded, as also are the frames of the mirrors and\r\npictures; the bureau and the curtains are red; the table and wardrobe\r\nare of rosewood, inlaid and decorated with beautiful Saxony porcelain,\r\nas also is the mantelpiece of black marble. At seven o'clock I went\r\nout with the Queen in her carriage, while the King entered the phaeton\r\nwith his favourite Minister, Count Stolberg, who is a very pleasant\r\nman; my son was in the third carriage with Humboldt. The King led the\r\nway and we followed him over very beautiful roads carried through a\r\nforest which he has added to the great park of Potsdam; he was then\r\nkind enough to drive us back to the railway, and the last train\r\nbrought us to Berlin where I was anxious to appear at the house of\r\nFrau von Savigny, who had arranged a musical evening for us. This was\r\na very pleasant entertainment; her nieces, her son and two other\r\ngentlemen sang delightfully, and a certain Passini played the violin\r\ninfinitely better than I have ever heard any violinist play. I thought\r\nhim far superior to Paganini and Bériot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, July 1, 1843._--This new month really should bring us summer,\r\nbut it does not look like doing so. The weather is cold, damp and\r\nabominable. However, I went yesterday with the Radziwills, my son and\r\nHerr von Olfers to see the frescoes which are being executed in the\r\nmuseum under the direction of Cornelius. They are very beautiful\r\ncompositions in point both of design and idea. I also went to the\r\nKunstverein to see the portrait of Tieck by Styler, who is at present\r\nthe most famous portrait painter in Germany and I think deserves his\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, July 3, 1843._--Yesterday we went to Potsdam to a military\r\nfête to which the Emperor of Russia had sent a deputation; in\r\nconsequence all the Russians in residence here were invited. The whole\r\nof the royal family and several of the chief noblemen of the country\r\nwere there; Princess Adalbert, who has returned from Silesia, was also\r\nthere. She has grown much older, is greatly changed, and in my opinion\r\nis extremely ugly; she seemed to be in no way conscious of the fact.\r\nDinner was given in a large gallery, after which we went to see the\r\ntroops dining in the open air. They were continuously exposed to a\r\nfine and very unpleasant rain which entirely spoilt the sight. After\r\ndinner came the theatre, then supper and then the railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Königsbruck, July 6, 1843._--I arrived here yesterday at the house of\r\nmy nieces. The castle is almost full, but only relations are there:\r\nthe Count and Countess of Hohenthal, Madame de Lazareff, and her three\r\nchildren, Fanny Biron, her two young brothers, Pierre and Calixte, the\r\ntwo daughters and the little boy of poor Count Maltzan, who are\r\ncousins-german of my nieces, and then a number of governesses, &c.\r\nEvery one seemed very happy and welcomed me warmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad_, July 11, 1843.--On the 7th we had a terrible storm at\r\nKönigsbruck with hail, a waterspout and a flood. A child in the\r\nvillage was drowned, and everybody was terror-stricken. My poor nephew\r\nHohenthal lost his hay and his harvest. I started on the 8th in good\r\ntime to dine at Pillnitz, where their Majesties received me most\r\nkindly. On the 9th I heard mass at Dresden in the early morning and\r\nstarted after lunch for Teplitz. Yesterday I made a start in stormy\r\nweather, the horses were frightened and inclined to shy; on one\r\noccasion they started to one side of the road, and if they had not\r\nstuck in some heavy earth we should have been upset. It was an\r\nunpleasant experience, for the danger was real. However, as it is\r\nover, one can but thank God for safety and think of it no more. I\r\nfound my sisters very kind and affectionate, but the second is much\r\nchanged, yellow and withered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 13, 1843._--Yesterday I had several callers: Prince\r\nPaul Esterhazy came in first and we talked of many old memories. Then\r\nthe Ambassador Pahlen came; he knows as little of his future career as\r\nBarante knows of his. Afterwards I and my son went to dinner with\r\nPrince Paul Esterhazy: among the guests were Princesse Gabrielle\r\nAuersberg, lady-in-waiting to the Emperor Alexander during the Vienna\r\nCongress; Princess Veriand of Windisch-Graetz, a pretty woman of the\r\nsame period, and her daughter, the Ambassador Pahlen, Herr von\r\nLiebermann and Count Woronzoff-Daschkoff. After dinner I made several\r\ncalls and went to tea with my sisters; several people came in,\r\nincluding the Count of Brandenburg, son of the stout William and of\r\nCountess Doenhoff. We had met long ago at Berlin and were glad to meet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 15, 1843._--I spend almost the whole of my days with\r\nmy sisters. Here people live in the street, wander about and spend\r\ntheir money in the shops, in which they are constantly looking. I was\r\nasked to tea yesterday with the Countess Strogonoff whom I had met at\r\nLondon at dinner with Madame de Lieven. I stayed for half an hour,\r\nbut it was a meeting of St. Petersburg society, and I was quite lost.\r\nI saw Marshal Paskewitch who is known, I think, as the Prince of\r\nWarsaw; his manner is by no means pleasant, and certainly not\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breslau, July 24, 1843._--I am making only a flying visit here as I\r\nwish to dine with my nephew Biron at Polnisch-Wartenberg, and I have\r\nno time to lose. I saw nothing striking on the road from Dresden here,\r\nand Breslau is an old town which is rather stolid than interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polnisch-Wartenberg, July 26, 1843._--I found a regular family\r\nmeeting here the day before yesterday and a pressing invitation to\r\ndine the next day with the Radziwills. I therefore accompanied my\r\nnephew yesterday morning to Antonin, a shooting-box of the Radziwills\r\nin the grand duchy of Posen. The weather was abominable and the Polish\r\nroads extremely bad. Six horses harnessed to a light carriage dragged\r\nus through dark forests, over deep sand through which we jolted over\r\nthe roots of trees. The grand duchy of Posen which begins two leagues\r\nfrom here, has a generally depressing appearance; the population, the\r\nhouses and the cultivation are all in a poor state. I was received\r\nvery kindly by the good Radziwills, who are living in a curious castle\r\nwhich is rather original than comfortable. Near this castle their\r\nparents are buried; I was taken to the family vault to pray over the\r\ntomb of their late mother, Princess Louise of Prussia, who was my\r\ngodmother, and what is more, was a really motherly friend to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polnisch-Wartenberg, July 27, 1843._--My nephew took me for a drive\r\nyesterday morning to see part of his estate. We spent the rest of the\r\ntime examining old family papers and memorials of our grandparents\r\nwhich are collected here. Prince Radziwill dined here in the course of\r\na round of inspection which he was making.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, July 29, 1843._--I have come here from\r\nPolnisch-Wartenberg. I stayed at Breslau for a few hours to visit the\r\nchurches, the old town hall, and some shops which are better stocked\r\nand in better taste than those of Berlin. I also wished to pay my\r\nrespects to the Prince Bishop[104] and ask his blessing. He received\r\nme with affecting sympathy. My nephew who had accompanied me\r\neverywhere, left me in the cathedral and went to ask the Bishop if he\r\ncould receive me; he immediately came to fetch me, notwithstanding his\r\neighty-two years, and took me to his palace which he showed me. It is\r\na fine residence, and I was obliged to accept an invitation to a meal.\r\nThe traditions and character of Breslau pleased me greatly.\r\n\r\n  [104] The Prince Bishop of Breslau was then the Viscount Melchior\r\n  von Diepenbrock, a cardinal (1798-1853).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, July 31, 1843._--I do not know Princess Belgiojoso well\r\nenough to say whether I should be flattered or not by the comparison\r\nwhich M. Cousin has given you of her mind and mine;[105] but I am\r\nquite certain that M. Cousin cannot possibly judge my character,\r\nseeing that I have never spoken with him nor in his presence. His\r\nstatements therefore are based upon hearsay and are, in consequence,\r\nunreliable. In any case my learning which is confined to the\r\nseventeenth century will humbly strike its flag before a mother of the\r\nchurch. I do not write books, I am ignorant and grow more ignorant\r\nevery day, as I am entirely occupied with personal interests, and if I\r\nwere obliged to make researches into any subject, it would be into the\r\nlaw concerning fiefs.[106] This reminds me that I was startled this\r\nmorning by the trumpet blast of a postillion which seemed to me to\r\nannounce some courier sent to Germany for a definite answer. However,\r\nit was Herr von Wolff who had come with a new proposal concerning the\r\nSagan affair. In a fortnight the business will either be ended\r\nsatisfactorily or broken off altogether; so another fortnight of\r\nuncertainty must follow many months of suspense. The late M. de\r\nTalleyrand, who was always right, said that a long distance separated\r\nthe agreement and the conclusion of any piece of business.\r\n\r\n  [105] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\n  [106] An allusion to the business connected with the Fief of\r\n  Sagan, concerning which negotiations were then in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 3, 1843._--I am sorry to hear of the death of\r\nGeneral Alava, though he was not a character who held any high place\r\nin my esteem. With him more recollections of the past have\r\ndisappeared; and at Rochecotte I had also looked after him and had\r\ngrown accustomed to the sound of his stick upon my inlaid floors.\r\nDeath is a very serious matter and when it begins to thin the ranks of\r\none's intimate friends, as has been the case with me for several\r\nyears, it is impossible to avoid serious reflections upon death. It\r\ncomes nearer and nearer to my heart and sometimes it seems to me that\r\nI have no time to lose before I make all my preparations for the great\r\nand final journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 10, 1843._--I spent nearly the whole of\r\nyesterday at Wartenberg: I propose to found a little hospital there\r\nand am greatly occupied by the preparations and arrangements for it, a\r\ntask entirely after my own heart. I spent the beautiful evening\r\nsitting on my balcony, surrounded by flowers, reading and thinking;\r\nbut if thoughts are to be pleasant the heart must be free from all sad\r\nand painful cares, otherwise meditation turns inevitably to\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 16, 1843._--My sisters arrived yesterday morning\r\nand my son Louis yesterday evening; my nieces and their children have\r\nbeen here for some days with Count Schulenburg, so that my little\r\nhouse is almost full.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, August 21, 1843._--Yesterday I went to mass at\r\nWartenberg. When I came back I found Herr von Wolff who told us the\r\nterrible news of the fire in the Opera House at Berlin and the panic\r\nand danger which menaced the charming palace of the dear Princess of\r\nPrussia.[107] She was then indisposed and the fright seems to have\r\nmade her quite ill. The young Archduke of Austria who was then in\r\nBerlin, seems to have behaved marvellously well.[108] Yesterday\r\nevening at tea time the Countess de le Roche-Aymon called here on her\r\nway to her niece, Madame de Bruges, who lives in Upper Silesia. She\r\nhas decided to spend a few days with us: German by extraction, she\r\nhas lived in France for a long time and is now returning to settle in\r\nher native land; she is cheerful and lively in spite of her\r\nseventy-three years. She told us that the will of Prince Augustus of\r\nPrussia, who has just died, was scandalous to the last degree,[109]\r\nand gave a full account of his mistresses and bastard children. The\r\nlatter amount to a hundred and twenty, but have not all survived their\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n  [107] The two buildings were opposite one another, and the wind\r\n  drove the flames towards the palace of the Prince and Princess of\r\n  Prussia.\r\n\r\n  [108] A reference to the Archduke Stephan, son of the Archduke\r\n  Joseph, Count Palatine of Hungary, who was then staying at Berlin\r\n  on his way to Hanover.\r\n\r\n  [109] Prince Augustus of Prussia, the younger brother of Prince\r\n  Louis Ferdinand, who was killed in 1806 at Saalfeld, and the son\r\n  of Prince Ferdinand, the last brother of Frederick the Great, was\r\n  never married. He possessed a considerable fortune which he had\r\n  increased by unscrupulous methods at the expense of his\r\n  relations, and made a will by which the property of which he\r\n  could not dispose reverted to the crown of Prussia, while the\r\n  rest was bequeathed to his numerous natural children; so that he\r\n  thus deprived his sister, Princess Radziwill, of the inheritance\r\n  which should have gone to her. This scandal led to a famous law\r\n  suit, which was lost by the Radziwills and attracted much public\r\n  attention in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hohlstein, September 6, 1843._--I arrived at Hohlstein the day before\r\nyesterday. Unfortunately the weather remains unpleasant and trying.\r\nApart from my sisters there is no one here now except Fanny and myself\r\nand life is very quiet, which suits me entirely.\r\n\r\nYesterday my sisters took me to Neuland, three leagues from here. This\r\nis a large estate with a small castle which the ex-King of the Low\r\nCountries bought eighteen months ago from the Count of Nostitz. It is\r\nsaid that he proposes to settle it upon his wife. Some building is\r\ngoing on and the garden is being laid out, but on a restricted scale\r\nand in poor taste. The site is very ordinary; the fields alone are\r\nbeautiful, but a man of taste might do a great deal. The appearance of\r\nthe whole did not please me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, October 11, 1843._--I can understand that the town of Berlin\r\nwould not suit everybody's taste: though handsome it is too monotonous\r\nand too modern. Prague is much more imposing and Dresden more lively.\r\nThe real importance of Berlin is entirely political and military, and\r\nit always gives one the impression of being at headquarters.\r\n\r\nHerr von Humboldt is extremely kind, but a little spice of malice is\r\ninvariably perceptible in his acts of politeness, and it is well to be\r\non one's guard. He amuses the King with numberless stories in which\r\ncharitable feeling is not the most striking motive.\r\n\r\nA rumour is widely circulated that the bullet shot fired at the\r\ncarriage of the Emperor Nicholas at Posen is a little Russian comedy\r\narranged to provide an excuse for further severity in Poland and to\r\njustify German severity towards the grand duchy of Posen.[110]\r\n\r\n  [110] The Russian Emperor, after a stay at Potsdam, barely\r\n  escaped assassination as he was returning to his kingdom. As he\r\n  passed through Posen on September 19 the people were mourning the\r\n  death of General von Grolman, who had died of heart disease on\r\n  September 15. A great favourite with every class of the\r\n  population, the General had been buried on that same day,\r\n  September 18, amid a great crowd of people. Advantage of the\r\n  crowd was taken a short time afterwards to fire upon the carriage\r\n  of the _aides-de-camp_, which was mistaken for the carriage of\r\n  the Czar. Several bullets were found in the carriage and in the\r\n  cloaks of the officers, but the event was never cleared up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, October 16, 1843._--Yesterday I received at last the ratified\r\nagreement with my nephew the Prince of Hohenzollern, concerning the\r\ntenure of Sagan, duly signed, initialled and attested. The kindness of\r\nHerr von Wolff, to which this result is largely due, makes this final\r\nsolution of the question doubly valuable in my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe official date for taking possession is April 1, though I am\r\nallowed to supervise the workmen from this moment. We have now to\r\nregularise the deed by a family agreement securing the concurrence of\r\nthe agnate relations; then to abandon the allodial rights to the fief\r\nto satisfy the Crown and to reconstitute as one whole that which is\r\nnow divided into several parts. When this has been done, the king must\r\nre-invest me and receive my oath of vassalage.\r\n\r\nHere we have with us the agreeable Balzac who has just returned from\r\nRussia: he gives as unpleasant accounts of the country as M. de\r\nCustine, but he will not write a special book of his travels; he is\r\nmerely writing some _Scenes from Military Life_, several of which will\r\ndeal, I think, with Russia. He is a heavy and vulgar character: I had\r\nalready seen him in France, but he left me with a disagreeable\r\nimpression which has now been strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday we went to dinner, saw the play and had\r\nsupper at the new palace. The play was Shakspere's _Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_, translated by Schlegel. The staging was very fine. At supper I\r\nsat by the side of the Archduke Albert, who is a natural and\r\nwell-educated character. He is to marry Princess Hildegarde of Bavaria\r\nwho is said to be very pretty.\r\n\r\nI am to go and dine at Babelsberg with the Princess of Prussia. She is\r\nto be so kind as to take me in the evening to Sans Souci, where the\r\nKing told me to come and hear Madame Viardot Garcia quite privately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, October 18, 1843._--The little concert at Sans Souci was very\r\nagreeable. Madame Viardot sang very well and was very attractive in\r\nspite of her plainness. She has just started for St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nI informed the King that the treaty between my nephew and myself had\r\nbeen concluded. He was extremely gracious upon this occasion and seems\r\nto me to have abandoned all his prejudices in favour of the elder\r\nbranch of my family.[111] I was really touched by his kindness.\r\nYesterday I had a long conference with the Prince of Wittgenstein who\r\nhas to deal with all questions touching the crown fiefs, as chief\r\nminister of the King's household.\r\n\r\n  [111] The Hohenzollern-Hechingen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 28, 1843._--The Duchesse Mathieu de Montmorency writes\r\ncomplaining of obstinate bronchitis; I should be sorry if she were to\r\ndie, for I should lose in her a Christian friend; she and Mgr. de\r\nQuélen taught me what a friendship could be that was always equable\r\nand kind, in which self-love played no part, for they are friends not\r\nmerely for time but for eternity. To-day I have also a letter from M.\r\nRoyer-Collard. His handwriting is greatly altered: I feel that my\r\nhappiness is threatened in the person of my best friends, and since M.\r\nde Talleyrand's death I have been terribly tried in this respect.\r\n\r\nSagan, which I am examining in detail, is a town of seven thousand\r\npeople with six churches, five of which are Catholic and all of which\r\nare interesting: there are also several charitable foundations in the\r\ntown founded by the Dukes at different times; some are six hundred\r\nyears old and were founded by the Dukes of the house of Piast.[112]\r\nIt is touching to see these works still standing when all purely\r\nsecular monuments so rapidly decay. I have been received here with\r\nmarks of great attention. For four years everything has been left in a\r\nstate of utter abandonment and even longer than that, for my sister\r\nhad moved to Italy and took no interest in her estates.\r\n\r\n  [112] The Polish dynasty founded by Piast, which proceeded from\r\n  842-1370. A branch of the Piast family retained the Duchy of\r\n  Silesia until 1675.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, November 14, 1843._--I have been here for some days. The day\r\nbefore yesterday I had the honour of paying my respects to the\r\nArchduchess Sophie, whom I had known before her marriage: she received\r\nme most kindly, nor could any one be more gracious, more amiable, more\r\nanimated or easy in every way. She asked me many questions about our\r\nRoyal Family and spoke of them in very suitable terms and with tact\r\nand kindness. I was delighted with the interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, November 24, 1843._--Life here is very much more peaceful\r\nthan at Berlin. The Court does not appear and all the fashionable\r\npeople are still shooting in the country. Parties will not begin\r\nbefore New Year's Day. I have been four times to the theatre which is\r\nover by half-past nine, and three times to the house of Prince\r\nMetternich; his parties go on till nearly midnight but there are only\r\nfive or six regular visitors. I have also visited Louise Schönburg;\r\nseveral people regularly stand round her long chair from nine o'clock\r\nto eleven. Medem, M. de Flahaut, Paul and Maurice Esterhazy and\r\nMarshal Marmont often call upon me at the end of the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, January 4, 1844._--I am packing up, saying goodbye and making\r\nthe thousand little arrangements which precede departure. I shall\r\nleave Vienna very well satisfied with my stay and very grateful for\r\nthe extreme kindness and courtesy that every one has shown me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 24, 1844._--The day before yesterday I went out in a\r\nsledge to a shooting-party; two hundred and eighty head of game were\r\nkilled. Yesterday I visited a very fine reformatory which is the chief\r\nhouse of its kind for this part of Silesia. It is in Sagan itself, in\r\na house which was formerly a Jesuit convent. It is a well-arranged\r\nestablishment conducted upon Christian principles by Baron von\r\nStanger. He is a widower; in grief at the loss of a wife whom he\r\nadored, he was impelled by his religious feelings to devote himself to\r\nthis work of redemption. The clergyman subordinate to him is a\r\nconverted Jew, a kind of Abbé of Ratisbon, most zealous and\r\nconscientious and imbued with the missionary spirit. The results so\r\nfar obtained are most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMy life here is simple, quiet and I trust useful. I have also good\r\nnews of all to whom I am sincerely attached, and no more physical\r\ntrouble than I can well bear. To feel oneself entirely useless, to\r\nhave no serious object in life, or to be paralysed by excessive\r\nphysical suffering, are I think, the only conditions under which\r\ncomplaints to God are justifiable. I do not mention the pain of\r\nsurviving those whom one loves whole-heartedly, for that is above all\r\nthings a matter of feeling, to use the admirable expression of Madame\r\nde Maintenon. Besides, the continuous exercise of one's whole energies\r\nin relieving others or helping one's kith and kin is a great means of\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 23, 1844._--The sect of the Pietists which is the\r\nscourge of Prussia, is doing more harm here than even atheists could\r\nproduce. There is no doubt that Prussia, like the rest of Europe, is\r\nagitated by revolutionary feeling and that Silesia is in particular\r\ndisturbed by these movements, the consequence of a mixture of\r\npopulations. These hostilities and rivalries are fomented by the\r\nPietists in a most unchristian way.\r\n\r\nI have seen Princess Albert of Prussia again. She looks better since\r\nher tour in Italy. I was surprised to see her sprightly and cheerful\r\nair, as her position is the more difficult, since her father's death\r\nhas deprived her of her strongest support.\r\n\r\nI hear from Vienna that Madame de Flahaut is patronising the young\r\nHungarians who are causing trouble at the Diet of Pressburg; that she\r\npraises their opposition speeches and encourages them to come to her\r\nhouse. At Vienna the authorities are surprised, but their feeling will\r\nsoon pass that stage. Really, this woman has not a single diplomatic\r\nfibre in the whole of her dry anatomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March 19, 1844._--In honour of the Mecklenburg and Nassau\r\nfamilies and of the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia, we have had some\r\ncarnival festivities upon a small scale which have caused me a certain\r\namount of trouble and weariness and left me rather tired. The Duke of\r\nNassau is a most dismal looking person and I think an unpleasant\r\nperson in every respect; he looks like a regimental surgeon. The young\r\nDuchess has an admirable figure and beautiful arms and complexion, but\r\nshe has red hair, with the coarse chubby face of a doll; she is simple\r\nand very kind. The Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia is better in health\r\nbut by no means improved in looks. Princess Augustus of Cambridge, who\r\nmarried the Crown Prince of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, exactly resembles\r\nwhat her aunt the Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg must have been at her\r\nage. In a few days we shall assume mourning here for the King of\r\nSweden who is certainly dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March 24, 1844._--I was in possession of the information\r\nwhich you have sent me[113] with regard to the fact that Charles X.\r\nalways did justice to M. de Talleyrand in reference to the interview\r\nbetween them during the night of the 16th and 17th of July, 1789. The\r\nKing had said as much to the old Duchesse de Luynes, and I was with my\r\nuncle when she came to repeat the words of Charles X. to him. Since\r\n1830 M. de Vitrolles has become so entirely a stranger to me that I do\r\nnot quite see how I could ask him to testify to the nature of this\r\ninterview, though he repeats his facts as he had them from the mouth\r\nof Charles X. himself.[114]\r\n\r\n  [113] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\n  [114] The Memoirs of the Prince de Talleyrand contain an account\r\n  of the scene to which these memoirs here allude. In the Appendix\r\n  to this volume the reader will find the story, the truth of which\r\n  is attested by M. de Vitrolles himself, as it is given in the\r\n  Appendix to the second volume of the _Memoirs of M. de\r\n  Talleyrand_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March 30, 1844._--I am busy with farewell visits and the\r\nusual preparations and troubles of departure. I shall spend the\r\ngreater part of April at Sagan, and shall start for Paris about the\r\n20th, as I wish to be there for my daughter's confinement. I shall\r\nthen spend a few days at Rochecotte and return to Germany about the\r\nend of June.\r\n\r\nI have been very busy of late and have been obliged to leave several\r\nletters unanswered. Wide separation enables action to be taken which\r\nclose neighbourhood would make difficult. The late M. de Talleyrand\r\nused to think a great deal of this system, and with every reason. He\r\nused to reproach me for the want of skill which I displayed in\r\nreferring and replying to every statement, in my extreme fondness for\r\nargument and discussion, my inability to pass over difficult points,\r\nand my excessive insight into indiscretions and requirements. I used\r\nto tell him that in his position and at his age silence in certain\r\nrespects was taken as a hint or a warning, and therefore permissible,\r\nbut that I was too young and by no means sufficiently independent to\r\nadopt such habits. At that time I was right, but as youth is a fault\r\nwhich can be cured every day, in spite of itself, I have found for\r\nsome time that the moment has come when I may treat as non-existent\r\nthat which troubles or wearies me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere the memoirs are interrupted for three consecutive years. The\r\nDuchesse de Talleyrand started for France in the month of April 1844,\r\nto be with the Marquise de Castellane when she was confined of her\r\nson. The journey did not prove satisfactory, as she encountered\r\ndifficulties with her French relations when she wished to secure their\r\nconsent to the establishment of the fief of Sagan in favour of her\r\neldest son. M. de Bacourt also disapproved of her proposal to settle\r\nin Germany, and the correspondence which has provided material for\r\nthese chronicles became much less frequent. It was not resumed with\r\nany regularity until the end of 1847, after Rochecotte had been given\r\nto the Marquise de Castellane, and the Marquis de Castellane, the\r\nDuchesse de Talleyrand's son-in-law, had died. In consequence of this\r\nevent the Duchesse de Talleyrand returned once more to France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1847\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 12, 1847._--I am delighted to learn that your\r\nnomination to the Embassy of Turin has been settled, since you desire\r\nthe post.[115] I hear from Berlin that the Emperor Nicholas is angry\r\nwith Paul Medem for leaving his post without leave, and that he is\r\ntherefore not receiving the treatment to which he is accustomed and to\r\nwhich he has a right. Count Nesselrode and his numerous friends are\r\ndoing their best to disperse these clouds, and will doubtless be\r\nsuccessful. At Berlin men's minds are full of Switzerland, the past\r\nhistory of which is a disgrace, while the present is an anxiety and\r\nthe future a menace, especially in the south of Germany.[116] M.\r\nGuizot, however, seems to go forward courageously with or without the\r\nconcurrence of England, and at Berlin there is general satisfaction\r\nwith his frankness and his decision. I have this from a high\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n  [115] Extract from a letter to M. de Bacourt.\r\n\r\n  [116] After the fall of the Empire the department of Neuchâtel,\r\n  which had belonged to Prussia since the time of Frederick II.,\r\n  joined the Swiss Confederation as its twenty-first canton, though\r\n  it remained under the suzerainty of Prussia. This ambiguous\r\n  position led to a series of disturbances and struggles. In 1847\r\n  Neuchâtel refused to take part in the war against the Sonderbund,\r\n  and was condemned to pay an indemnity of nearly half a million to\r\n  the Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 18, 1847._--I hear upon good authority that the small\r\nstates of Switzerland are in a great ferment, especially among the\r\npeasants, and that the heavy indemnities laid upon the unfortunate\r\nvictims of the Sonderbund will probably drive them to a general\r\nrevolt. Colleredo and Radowitz were to leave Vienna to-day for\r\nthe Congress, at which the affairs of Switzerland are to be\r\ndiscussed.[117]\r\n\r\n  [117] Various anti-liberal attempts had been made between\r\n  1839-1840 in the Swiss Cantons of Tessin, Argovie, Valais, and\r\n  Vaud. The Grand Council decreed the suppression of the convents.\r\n  The Catholic Cantons protested and formed a league among\r\n  themselves called the Sonderbund for the defence of their rights.\r\n  The radical party regarded this movement as a violation of the\r\n  constitution and declared war upon the Sonderbund, which was\r\n  defeated in a desperate battle on the frontiers of the canton of\r\n  Lucerne.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a visit from Prince and Princess Carolath. I had seen\r\nthem in London in 1830 when Prince Carolath was sent by the King of\r\nPrussia to congratulate William IV. on his succession. Through his\r\nmother, Prince Carolath is cousin german of the Dowager Queen of\r\nEngland.[118] By birth the princess was Countess Pappenheim, a\r\ngranddaughter of the Chancellor Hardenberg; after her mother had been\r\ndivorced from Count Pappenheim, she married Prince Pückler-Muskau. She\r\nis very kind and charitable to the poor, writes charming verses, reads\r\na great deal, and speaks several languages.\r\n\r\n  [118] The mother of Prince Heinrich Carolath-Beuthen was by birth\r\n  Duchess Amelia of Saxe-Meiningen and was the aunt of Queen\r\n  Adelaide of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 24, 1847._--The Empress Marie Louise is dead. A year\r\nago this event would hardly have been noticed, but it now adds a\r\nfurther complication to the state of northern Italy, which was\r\ncertainly not required in a district that is threatened upon every\r\nside. The people of Parma are said to be trembling lest they should\r\nfall under the government of the wretched Duke of Lucca, and are\r\nthought to be on the point of revolt.[119] The Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\ndisturbed by the liberal movement, is harassing the Court of Vienna.\r\nThe Papacy is said to be in the same position as Tuscany. It seems\r\nimpossible that Piedmont should escape all this ferment, and this is\r\nthe fact which interests me most in the whole affair. Apparently there\r\nare many assassinations in Italy. I know that the members of the\r\ndiplomatic body are not greatly exposed, but crimes about one, even if\r\nnot aimed at oneself, make life difficult and sad. At Vienna society\r\nis said to be restless and touchy and inclined to duelling. For this\r\nthere are several reasons. The first and chief is the extraordinarily\r\ntumultuous Diet of Hungary, where the young and untamed nobility of\r\nliberal ideas spends its time during the week, and returns from\r\nPressburg on Saturday to spend the Sunday at Vienna and to shout its\r\ndefiance in the chief casinos, until clubs have been formed. The party\r\nopposed to Metternich (I refer to the conservatives, many of whom are\r\nvery hostile to him) regard Austria's attitude upon the Swiss question\r\nas deplorable.[120] It is loudly asserted that Prince Metternich is\r\nbeing deceived by Lord Palmerston, and that instead of issuing clever\r\nnotes he should have made armed demonstrations, and that if he has\r\nsufficient intellect remaining for the first he has not the energy for\r\nthe second alternative. I am therefore assured that this winter will\r\nbe unpleasant at Vienna, and that there have already been lively and\r\ndisagreeable scenes. Madame de Colloredo is the only cheerful person;\r\nresplendent in the magnificent jewels which her new husband has given\r\nher, dressed in youthful and coquettish style with roses in her hair\r\nas a girl of fifteen, she is totally indifferent to the mockery aimed\r\nat her, which she is enabled to bear by the attentions of Count\r\nColloredo, who seems to be deeply in love and fully satisfied. Such is\r\nthe gossip from Vienna which my brother-in-law brought back yesterday.\r\n\r\n  [119] On the death of the Empress Marie Louise, in virtue of an\r\n  arrangement made at Paris in 1817, Charles Louis of Bourbon, Duke\r\n  of Lucca, took possession of the duchies of Parma and of\r\n  Placentia. The duchy of Guastalla passed to the Duke of Modena\r\n  who ceded the duchy of Lucca to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In\r\n  1848 the new Duke of Parma abdicated in favour of his son,\r\n  Charles III., who had married Mademoiselle, the daughter of the\r\n  Duc de Berry.\r\n\r\n  [120] Throughout the period of struggle in Switzerland, the\r\n  Powers had constantly sent warnings to the radical party. France\r\n  in particular threatened armed intervention, but the events of\r\n  1848 caused the abandonment of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 28, 1847._--I fear that Italy must be bristling with\r\ndomestic and diplomatic difficulties. I am assured that the Duke of\r\nLucca will not assert his rights over Parma, and will abandon them to\r\nhis son. He has shown such want of tact, and has committed such\r\nblunders in England, that Queen Victoria requested the Austrian\r\nAmbassador to induce the Prince of Lucca to leave England at once, as\r\nshe would otherwise be obliged to command his departure herself. It\r\nis very sad for Mlle. de Rosny, his wife,[121] who is said to be\r\ncharming and distinguished.\r\n\r\n  [121] Mademoiselle, daughter of the Duc de Berry.\r\n\r\nM. de Radowitz is a clever and learned man, who thinks a great deal of\r\nhimself and is a great talker. He leads the Catholic mystical party in\r\nPrussia, and is therefore entirely in the King's good graces and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nBarante writes to me from Paris, assuring me that the relations\r\nbetween Russia and France are by no means so near a revival as people\r\nsaid; he seems to me rather to aim at succeeding the Duc de Broglie as\r\nAmbassador at London than at following Bresson in the Embassy at\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 4, 1848._--I am quite overwhelmed by the death of\r\nMadame Adélaïde.[122] It is a misfortune for the King, for the poor\r\nand for my children. In her I lose a friend who regretted daily the\r\nloss of M. de Talleyrand, whose death I have also every reason to\r\ndeplore. And thus the sad year of 1847 has come to an end with this\r\nsudden blow, and I can quite understand that the King's private\r\nfriends begin the year 1848 under gloomy auspices. The political\r\nhorizon seems very dark. I do not maintain that the turn of the north\r\nwill never come, but at the present moment the south is in a very\r\nfeverish condition.\r\n\r\n  [122] Madame Adélaïde died rather suddenly on December 31, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 6, 1848._--There is some truth in Madame de Lieven's\r\nremarks concerning Humboldt: I do not assert that he is absolutely\r\nradical, but his liberalism is of a very advanced type and at Berlin\r\nhe is thought to be urging the Princess of Prussia along the path\r\nwhich she does not always follow with sufficient prudence. However,\r\nHumboldt is too clever to compromise himself and though he may make\r\nhimself conspicuous to some extent, he is at bottom a remnant of the\r\nfew disappearing elements of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nI know enough of King Louise Philippe to be convinced of his courage\r\nand his presence of mind: when therefore I saw the submission of\r\nAbd-el-Kader in the newspaper, I at once considered that the King\r\nwould regard this event as counterbalancing his grief in some\r\ndegree.[123] The ties of affection which united him to his sister were\r\nso strong that he probably will not feel his loss most deeply at the\r\nfirst moment, but as life resumes its usual course, when he finds that\r\nshe is not present to listen to him and to share his thoughts at the\r\ntime when he used to visit her and give her his confidence, his\r\nisolation will be felt and sadness will begin. The Queen is\r\nundoubtedly no less devoted and loyal to him, but she is to some\r\nextent preoccupied by family cares and her mind does not run in the\r\nsame direction; she is not always in the King's room awaiting the\r\nroyal pleasure at every moment, while her religious tendencies are in\r\nadvance of those of the King. In short she may be much but she cannot\r\nbe everything. However, it is much better that the King should survive\r\nhis sister than that he should have died before her, for such a shock\r\nwould have killed Madame forthwith, I am perfectly certain.\r\n\r\n  [123] Notwithstanding the victory of General Bugeaud at Isly,\r\n  Abd-el-Kader, an energetic character, had contrived to continue\r\n  the struggle in Algeria. In a final engagement, however, his most\r\n  devoted adherents fell, and in 1847 he was obliged to surrender\r\n  to General Lamoricière. Abd-el-Kader was kept a prisoner in\r\n  France until the proclamation of the Empire. After Napoleon III.\r\n  had set him at liberty he lived in Syria as a faithful and\r\n  devoted friend of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 10, 1848._--Though I am not free from care when I am\r\nin good health, it must not be imagined that I have a terror of sudden\r\ndeath, the occasion of which I cannot foresee, though of its certainty\r\nI have no doubt. I have no wish to die, but I have no pleasure in\r\nlife. My life's work has certainly been done and all my tasks are\r\naccomplished. What remains affects me but little. It is but a matter\r\nof filling up the time and it is hardly worth the little daily efforts\r\nwhich it costs. However, I refuse to be overcome by depression. I have\r\nmade up my accounts and settled my affairs, and have therefore no\r\nreason for sadness, and as long as I am alive my energy will continue;\r\nbut I can never grow resigned to the idea of finding myself useless,\r\nand I trust that God will be so gracious as to leave me the power of\r\nsympathy with the wants of those about me until the last moment. If I\r\ndid not love the poor I should think myself more miserable than they.\r\nFortunately I feel more drawn towards them every day and they\r\ncompensate for many losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 12, 1848._--I have been invited to the funeral\r\nceremonies of Madame Adélaïde at Dreux. The King is greatly depressed\r\nand feels very lonely. I am very anxious as to what this year 1848 may\r\nhave in store for me.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Duc de Montpensier has been commissioned to arrange\r\nhis aunt's private papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 18, 1848._--I am carefully reading the debates in the\r\nFrench Chambers and have been delighted by the noble answers of the\r\nChancellor[124] and the clever replies of M. de Barante to this M.\r\nd'Alton Shée who carries his tactlessness too far.[125] The general\r\nprospect seems dark and there is no point upon the horizon to which I\r\ncan look with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  [124] The Duc Pasquier.\r\n\r\n  [125] In the session of January 10, at the Chamber of Peers, M.\r\n  de Barante, reporter to the committee, had read the proposed\r\n  Address in reply to the speech from the throne. The proposal was\r\n  vigorously attacked by the Comte d'Alton Shée who spoke for the\r\n  dynastic party and had suddenly joined the opposition from the\r\n  outset of the agitation for reform which preceded the revolution\r\n  of February 1848. The Comte d'Alton Shée did not hesitate to\r\n  express opinions entirely revolutionary, even while speaking in\r\n  the Chamber and in this session he fulminated with all his\r\n  eloquence against the foreign policy of M. Guizot, piling up\r\n  accusations haphazard with reference to Portuguese, Swiss, and\r\n  Italian affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 20, 1848._--I have been attentively reading the speech\r\nupon the Address in the Chamber of Peers, and was charmed by the clear\r\nand noble speech of the Duc de Broglie, while I was reduced to tears\r\nby the brilliant oration of M. de Montalembert on the affairs of\r\nSwitzerland, as he spoke with such sincere emotion, with such\r\ncleverness and resource, and exposed so entirely the intrigues of the\r\nabominable Lord Palmerston.[126] I really do not know why every one\r\nshould be so ready to consider that intermediary who is the curse of\r\nthe age: it seems quite obvious to me that M. Guizot has been duped\r\nby him in the matter of Switzerland; in his place I should have been\r\nbetter inspired, and I cannot imagine how any one can cease to\r\ndistrust him after the many experiences of his bad faith.[127]\r\n\r\n  [126] In the session of January 14, the Chamber of Peers resumed\r\n  discussion of the seventh paragraph of the Address referring to\r\n  Switzerland, and M. de Montalembert obtained one of his finest\r\n  oratorical triumphs when he stigmatised in the loftiest terms the\r\n  iniquitous and barbarous abuses of the revolutionary tyranny of\r\n  which Switzerland was providing sad and grievous instances.\r\n\r\n  [127] The policy of Lord Palmerston who had returned to the\r\n  Foreign Office in 1846, had once more resumed a revolutionary\r\n  character; particularly in the affair of the Sonderbund he was\r\n  seen to be supporting Ochsenbein and Dufour against the Catholic\r\n  Powers. He tricked M. Guizot who was negotiating to secure armed\r\n  intervention with the help of Prussia and Austria and to oppose\r\n  the English policy at a time when the submission of the seven\r\n  cantons was already accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 26, 1848._--So you are leaving Paris to-day to begin a\r\nnew phase of your existence.[128] I could wish that your latest news\r\nfrom Turin might be satisfactory, but I doubt if this will be the\r\ncase. The most important point is that the health of the King of\r\nSardinia should be restored and fortified; he seems to be a clever and\r\nenlightened Prince, quite aware of the necessities of the age, though\r\ndisinclined to make unnecessary concessions to them. I trust that he,\r\nyourself, and Italy in general may have a long and glorious existence.\r\n\r\n  [128] Extract from a letter addressed to M. de Bacourt who had\r\n  just been appointed French Minister at Turin.\r\n\r\nI have a long letter from my daughter Pauline full of regret at your\r\napproaching departure, which she regards as another severe trial.\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of the King of Denmark has just reached us; this\r\nwill further complicate the state of affairs in the North, and\r\napparently Europe[129] will not escape any resulting difficulty. The\r\nKing of Denmark was a learned and enlightened monarch and enjoyed an\r\nexcellent reputation; I had the honour of seeing him and of knowing\r\nthe Queen fairly well, a most saintly person;[130] her mother and mine\r\nwere intimate friends, and among my mother's papers I have found\r\nletters from the Duchess of Augustenburg.\r\n\r\n  [129] King Christian VIII. of Denmark was suddenly taken ill on\r\n  January 6, 1848, and died on the 20th of the same month.\r\n  Frederick VII., his son by his first marriage, succeeded him.\r\n\r\n  [130] By birth Princess of Schleswig-Holstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 29, 1848._--Yesterday we saw a remarkable meteor: for\r\ntwenty minutes a column of fire seemed to connect heaven and earth;\r\nthe sun appeared to be about a third of the way up the sky, and from\r\nthe lower part of its disc depended this luminous column which seemed\r\nto be supported by the horizon of the earth.[131] It was a beautiful\r\nand imposing spectacle. Some centuries ago astrologers would\r\nhave drawn many horoscopes based upon this event. I draw my\r\nprognostications from newspapers, and I dare not hope that this\r\nphenomenon portends any good.\r\n\r\n  [131] The same meteor was seen in France a few days previously\r\n  above Doullens: a sheaf of luminous rays extended horizontally\r\n  from north to south, giving off light denotations comparable to\r\n  those produced by a rocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, February 10, 1848._--On the 5th of the month I was very\r\nagreeably surprised by the arrival of the Prince Bishop of\r\nBreslau.[132] In spite of the unpleasant weather and his bad health he\r\nwas anxious to wish me many happy returns of the day and to say mass\r\nhere in person on St. Dorothea's Day. He was accompanied by several\r\necclesiastics and the chief Catholic lords of the province. The Prince\r\nBishop proposed my health at dinner in a charming speech, dealing with\r\nthe signification of the name of Dorothea and with the arms of\r\nSagan,[133] which he was good enough to term a speaking coat of arms.\r\nHe trembled with emotion and spilled a few drops of wine from his\r\nglass, whereupon he made an end, saying to me, \"When the heart speaks,\r\nthe hand trembles.\"\r\n\r\n  [132] Cardinal Diepenbrock.\r\n\r\n  [133] The arms of Sagan were an angel upon a golden background.\r\n\r\nThe typhus fever which is devastating Upper Silesia threatens to\r\nappear here, though we hope that it may be less deadly than it is upon\r\nthe other side of Breslau. The extremes of want and hunger have been\r\nmore successfully met here than in other parts of the province. In\r\nUpper Silesia this disease has caused dreadful ravages. The doctors\r\nhave succumbed to it, and were it not for the Brothers of Charity sent\r\nby the Prince Bishop, the people would be without relief. Four\r\nthousand orphans are wandering about. Mgr. Diepenbrock, following the\r\nexample of Mgr. de Quélen after the ravages of the cholera in 1833,\r\nproposes to open a place of refuge for them to which the Catholics of\r\nthe province are to devote their time and energy. The plan has been\r\nelaborated here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weimar, February 18, 1848._--We have had a succession of festivities\r\nhere in honour of the birthday of the reigning Grand Duchess. The day\r\nbefore yesterday an excellent performance was given of an opera which\r\nhas made much stir in Germany, called _Martha_, by the composer\r\nFlotow. The libretto and the music are very pretty, and the orchestra\r\nwas admirably conducted by Liszt. He is Capellmeister to the Weimar\r\nCourt, with definite leave of absence for nine months in the year. Of\r\nthis he recently took advantage to make a tour in Constantinople and\r\nOdessa, in the course of which he made much money. This evening he is\r\nto play to us privately at the house of the Grand Duchess, after\r\nPrince Pückler-Muskau has read some extracts dealing with his stay\r\nwith Mehemet Ali. There is to be previously a little dinner at the\r\nyoung Court of the Hereditary Prince. Attempts are made here to\r\ncherish the sacred fire of art and literature, which for sixty years\r\nor more has gained for Weimar the title of the Athens of Germany. The\r\nGrand Duchess, in order to perpetuate the tradition, has devoted a\r\ncertain number of rooms in the castle to the memory of poets,\r\nphilosophers, and artists who have made the district famous. Fresco\r\npaintings recall the various subjects of their works, and the rooms\r\nare decorated with busts, portraits, views of the historical scenes\r\nand curious sites, and pieces of furniture of different periods. The\r\nGrand Duchess enjoys a considerable private fortune, which she expends\r\nvery nobly upon charitable foundations, and in the decoration of her\r\nresidences. For a hundred years the Court of Weimar has been very well\r\ndivided among various Princesses; the grandmother of the present Grand\r\nDuke was the patroness of Schiller, of Goethe and Wieland, and under\r\nher patronage the classical literature of Germany was able to\r\nflourish; her daughter-in-law, the mother of the present Grand Duke,\r\nwas the only Princess of Germany who was able to overawe Napoleon. She\r\nsaved the kingdom for her husband, the Duke, by her courage and\r\nfirmness. M. de Talleyrand often took pleasure in describing the\r\nscenes in which this Princess confronted the conqueror. The\r\ndaughter-in-law of the present Grand Duchess, the Princess of the Low\r\nCountries, is also clever and well educated; she has a charming voice,\r\ngreat tact, and a simple manner which increases the effect of her good\r\nqualities; everything shows that she will be worthy to continue the\r\ntradition of the remarkable Princesses who have reigned over the Court\r\nof Weimar. Among them one might almost include the Duchess d'Orléans,\r\nas her mother was a sister of the reigning Grand Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 28, 1848._--The day before yesterday I was far from\r\nthinking that an interval of forty-eight hours would have brought such\r\nvast changes of the situation. The telegraph has successively\r\nannounced a series of events, though without details, none of which,\r\nhowever, prepared us for the startling news of the abdication of Louis\r\nPhilippe, and of the regency of the Duchesse d'Orléans.[134] We had no\r\nknowledge of the causes or exigencies of the situation, nor can we say\r\nwhat events can be ascribed to prudence or to weakness; but apart from\r\nthe historical value of these events, which we shall learn later, the\r\nsimple fact is sufficiently crushing to cause general consternation\r\nhere, which is equally widespread among all parties from the highest\r\nto the lowest. The considerations which throng upon the mind are the\r\nsame in every case, and there is only one way of regarding the\r\nquestion and its probable results. These results will affect not only\r\nall Governments, but also all private rights. The Princess of Prussia,\r\nwho is united to her cousin by the keenest sympathy, is quite\r\noverwhelmed; she thinks that my presence may help her to bear the\r\nweight of anxiety, so that I have spent many hours with her in\r\nconjectures upon all these dreadful events, and in lamentations\r\nconcerning the mystery which still veils the greater part of this\r\ndrama, or, rather, of this sad tragedy. These grievous events will be\r\nre-echoed more quickly and more loudly in Italy than anywhere else;\r\nthe rest of Europe will then follow, for the respite momentarily\r\ngranted cannot be long. The fact is that it is impossible to find a\r\nsingle part of Europe where undisturbed peace and quiet is certain.\r\nEven America does not seem to me to be secure from disintegrating\r\nelements; such is the general tendency of the age, and we must learn\r\nto endure it in the positions in which Providence has naturally placed\r\nus. I am thankful, however, that I had induced Pauline to leave Paris\r\non February 23 for Le Délivrande.[135] I had disapproved of this plan\r\nin view of the coldness of the season, but I am now tempted to think\r\nit quite providential. This poor child's nerves have already been so\r\nshaken that they would have been overstrained by the sight and uproar\r\nof the city in tumult.\r\n\r\n  [134] King Louis Philippe who had resolved too late upon\r\n  electoral reform and the dissolution of his ministry, was\r\n  surprised by the massacre of the Boulevard des Capucines on\r\n  February 23. On the 24th the whole of Paris was in a ferment, the\r\n  revolution was triumphant and the King resolved to abdicate. He\r\n  left the Tuileries and took refuge at first in the Castle of Eu\r\n  and was under the delusion that his grandson, the Comte de Paris,\r\n  might succeed him, but on the 25th he learnt that the Republic\r\n  had been proclaimed and was forced to take refuge in England.\r\n\r\n  [135] The Marquise de Castellane had gone with her children to La\r\n  Délivrande, a village near Caen, which owes its origin to a\r\n  famous pilgrimage of the Virgin. Mgr. de Quélen had there uttered\r\n  ardent prayers that M. de Talleyrand might die a Christian death.\r\n\r\nPoor Madame Adélaïde died at the right time and God has rewarded her\r\naffection for her brother by sparing her this bitter grief. This is\r\nalso true of M. de Talleyrand; I cannot say the same of the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, who might have been able to turn these terrible events in\r\nanother direction if he had been alive.\r\n\r\nConsiderable excitement is beginning in Russia, but it is true to say\r\nthat the health of the Emperor Nicholas is very bad. He has an\r\neruption at the knee-joints which makes it difficult for him to walk,\r\nand the want of exercise consequently increases the sluggishness of\r\nthe liver to which he is subject; in short, his health gives cause for\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March 2, 1848._--Since February 28 the most frightful news\r\nhas arrived every hour with despairing rapidity. To-day a rumour is in\r\ncirculation which seems to indicate a tendency to a counter-revolution\r\nat Paris; I admit that I put no faith in it. My last direct news is\r\ndated the 24th, and was written during the quarter of an hour for\r\nwhich the regency of the Duchesse d'Orléans lasted. Letters of the\r\nsame date have arrived at Berlin, and we have the _Moniteur_ of the\r\n25th, but nothing more. These messages have not been delayed, and so\r\nwe must withhold our judgment upon events and upon the people who have\r\nfigured in this tragedy until we know the combination of events which\r\ninduced the King to yield, and has, so to speak, paralysed his action\r\nand that of his family. These unfortunate people are already the\r\nobjects of disapproval and criticism; I think it would be better to\r\nsuspend any final judgment. Appearances, however, are very strange,\r\nand incline one to think that M. Guizot and the Duchesse d'Orléans\r\nhave both shown courage and firmness in their several spheres of\r\naction. The English post which arrived yesterday evening gave no news\r\nof Louis Philippe or his family; they are said to be all at London,\r\nbut on this subject there is no official or certain news, and the\r\nmovements of individuals are marked by extreme uncertainty. The\r\nMarquis de Dalmatie[136] is playing a strange part here; thirty-six\r\nhours ago he sent away his servants, has been selling his furniture\r\nand his diamonds, complaining of his poverty, and going from door to\r\ndoor saying that he is a poor _émigré_, and cursing the Sovereign whom\r\nhe represented six days ago. He does not thereby improve his position.\r\nIt is thought that as long as the Duchesse d'Orléans and the Comte de\r\nParis are on French territory he ought to maintain his official\r\nposition and adopt the attitude which it requires; moreover, it is\r\nknown that his father is very rich, and it is improbable that\r\nconfiscation would take place except in cases of actual exile. I shall\r\ntherefore advise my children not to become _émigrés_, as I remember M.\r\nde Talleyrand's constant advice against this course.\r\n\r\n  [136] He was then French Minister at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe excitement here with regard to the European consequences of the\r\ndays of February may easily be imagined. The Belgian Minister, M. de\r\nNathomb, told me yesterday that a strong anti-French movement was\r\nbecoming manifest in Belgium. Herr von Radowitz started for Vienna\r\nlast night, and Prince William, the King's uncle, has gone to\r\nMayence.[137]\r\n\r\n  [137] Herr von Radowitz was then sent to Vienna to try and\r\n  arrange some co-operation between the two courts in view of the\r\n  revolutionary storm which seemed to be threatening. Prince\r\n  William, who had been governor of Mayence from 1844, returned to\r\n  his post in view of the course of events.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which has just come in officially announces the arrival\r\nof the Duchesse d'Orléans and her two children at Deutz, on the\r\noutskirts of Cologne.[138] The district of Baden is being overcome by\r\nexcitement, and there is much anxiety as to the possible course of\r\nevents. People say that there have also been disturbances in\r\nCassel.[139] May God have pity upon this poor old world and those\r\nmembers of it in particular who are dear to me!\r\n\r\n  [138] In the confusion which prevailed during the unhappy day of\r\n  February 24, at Paris, when every one fled as best he could, the\r\n  Duchesse d'Orléans and her two children, after escaping the\r\n  perils which they had run at the Chamber of Deputies, took refuge\r\n  with M. Jules de Lasteyrie at the Hôtel des Invalides, which they\r\n  left secretly during the night. From Paris to Aix la Chapelle,\r\n  the Princess travelled in a public conveyance accompanied by the\r\n  Marquis de Montesquiou and M. de Mornay. She then took the\r\n  railway to Cologne, and after spending the night at Deutz, she\r\n  went to Ems to ask refuge of the Grand Duke of Weimar who placed\r\n  the castle of Eisenach at her disposal. It was not until June\r\n  1849 that she went to England to visit the Royal Family at St.\r\n  Leonards, near Hastings, where the King and Queen had gone in\r\n  view of their health.\r\n\r\n  [139] The old district of Franconia, that is to say, part of\r\n  Baden, Wurtemberg and Hesse, was then the scene of a movement\r\n  akin to the Jacquerie: the peasants rose in a body and committed\r\n  deplorable excesses; castles were burnt and plundered, and\r\n  several landowners were killed or barbarously ill-treated. On the\r\n  10th of March serious disturbances broke out at Cassel under the\r\n  pretext that the newly nominated ministers were the objects of\r\n  popular disapproval. The arsenal was stormed and plundered of\r\n  weapons; resistance was offered to the troops; the Life Guards\r\n  retreated, but the populace held the barracks until the regiment\r\n  was disbanded and the officers put upon trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March 14, 1848._--The whole country between the Rhine and the\r\nElbe is in commotion. Even here the troops are confined to barracks\r\nto-day and popular disturbances are expected. If the King had been\r\nwilling to convoke the Diet a few days ago difficulties would have\r\nbeen greatly decreased. The best chance here is to follow\r\nconstitutional forms openly and promptly; delay, hesitation, or\r\nintrigue will produce a crisis, the extent of which cannot be\r\nforeseen. Hence the present week is likely to be very critical here;\r\nthe burgomasters of the great towns have arrived with terrifying\r\npetitions; revolution is more or less avowed everywhere, and it is\r\nimpossible to say what will be or can be done. Meanwhile the poverty\r\nand the typhus fever are increasing.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Orléans is at Ems with her two children, travelling as\r\nthe Marquise de Mornay: she is anxious to remain entirely incognito\r\nand her confidants therefore deny the fact of her presence at Ems. She\r\nis, however, certainly there, for I have seen people who have talked\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 24, 1848._--Serious events have taken place at Berlin;\r\nprecious time has been lost, and after hesitation half-measures have\r\nbeen reluctantly begun. Further action has been extorted only by fear,\r\nafter two days, March 18 and 19, the horror of which I shall never\r\nforget. Highly disturbing symptoms proceeding from Breslau have\r\naffected Silesia; attacks have been made here upon the town hall and\r\nthe garrison; so far the castle has been spared. My servants thought\r\nthat my presence might calm the excitement and I hastened to the spot.\r\nSo far I have had no reason to regret my action, but as the\r\nneighbourhood of the Russians is a source of extreme and increasing\r\nbitterness, my brother-in-law thinks that I should not stay here and\r\nis sending me back to Berlin, where, however, the atmosphere is by no\r\nmeans calm. He proposes to stay at Sagan to make head against the\r\nstorm and to save what can be saved. Meanwhile the financial crisis is\r\nat its height: there is no money in the country, no one can pay,\r\nbankruptcies are declared on every side, while panic and agitation are\r\nparamount. Pandora's box has been overturned upon Europe. I have just\r\nheard that the Grand Duchy of Posen is in a ferment and as my estates\r\ntouch the frontier, I have a further cause for alarm, but I trust in\r\nthe mercy of God, am entirely calm, resigned and resolved to bow my\r\nhead without murmuring to the decrees of Providence. I only ask from\r\nHeaven the life and health of those whom I love. The uproar at Vienna\r\nhas quite amazed me. We advance from peril to peril.[140]\r\n\r\n  [140] On March 13 a formidable insurrection broke out at Vienna:\r\n  the population rose in a body; the railways were torn up and the\r\n  air resounded with cries, \"The constitution and the liberty of\r\n  the Press.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March 30, 1848._--I have now returned here, where the\r\nagitation is far from appeased. Prince Adam Czartoryski arrived\r\nyesterday from Paris, and I need not point out the nature of this new\r\ncomplication.[141] Complications, however, follow one another with\r\nappalling rapidity. The situation of individuals who have anything to\r\nlose is hardly better than that of the kings whose thrones are\r\ntottering to their fall. For the moment, at any rate, we are all\r\npenniless and neither the war in the east nor the communism of the\r\nwest offer any better chances for us in the future, for we are crushed\r\nbetween these two colossi.\r\n\r\n  [141] Prince Adam Czartoryski, who retained his delusions, was\r\n  inspired with fresh hopes by the disturbances which prevailed on\r\n  every side, and from which the Poles were trying to derive some\r\n  advantage for themselves. The Prince arrived at Berlin where\r\n  disorder was general and proclaimed with considerable effrontery\r\n  that Lord Palmerston and M. de Lamartine had promised to\r\n  support him by land and sea, if Prussia would declare the\r\n  re-establishment of Poland. The presence of Prince Czartoryski at\r\n  Berlin was regarded with such disfavour by the Emperor of Russia,\r\n  that he informed his Minister, Baron Meyendorff, that he would be\r\n  withdrawn from Poland, if the Prince prolonged his stay in that\r\n  capital.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Prussian Diet will be open on April 2, that is in\r\ntwo days, though this is not yet certain. In any case the meeting will\r\nbe short, as it will only deal with the electoral law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, April 1, 1848._--The Diet which is to open to-morrow will\r\nform a new act in the drama.[142] It is impossible to estimate the\r\nresults, and I have lost all interest in forecasts and also in\r\nproposals for a long time. Paul Medem, who is here still, is very\r\nuncertain what his future will be. The news from Vienna does not seem\r\nto me to be particularly reassuring. In general it is scarcely\r\npossible to find a peaceful point on the whole of the globe and the\r\nsole consolation is the remembrance of sure and tried affection which\r\ncan defy revolution and absence and everything that walks abroad\r\nthroughout this vale of tears.\r\n\r\n  [142] On April 2, 1848, at midday the second general Diet was\r\n  opened at Berlin in one Chamber without any distinction of rank\r\n  or representation. The commissary of this Diet, Herr von\r\n  Camphausen, the President of the Council, accompanied by all the\r\n  Ministers, opened the Diet in the King's name. He delivered a\r\n  speech, at the conclusion of which he brought forward proposals\r\n  for a law concerning elections for the purpose of bringing into\r\n  force upon a wide basis the constitution which the King had\r\n  granted to his people after the events of March 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, April 8, 1848._--The effects of the revolution in Paris have\r\nbeen felt here and the consequences have been violent, far-reaching\r\nand irremediable. Everything is still in a ferment and the impetus,\r\nfar from being exhausted is still proceeding, though not in an upward\r\ndirection. The peasants' rising in the provinces is a most disastrous\r\nelement in the situation: I am obliged to remain in the town in\r\nconsequence, though here the continuance of popular excitement\r\ndisagreeably breaks the monotonous and profound melancholy of this\r\ncapital. The Metternich family are in Holland preparing for their\r\ncrossing to England.[143]\r\n\r\n  [143] After a collision between the troops and the people at\r\n  Vienna on March 13, 1848, and after the insurrection in Venice,\r\n  Prince Metternich, who was too prone to overrate his capacity for\r\n  resistance, was forced by an infuriated mob to resign and to flee\r\n  from Austria with his wife. At first they stayed in Dresden, but\r\n  the unpopularity of the Prince was so great that they were\r\n  obliged to proceed to Holland and thence to England. In 1849 they\r\n  settled at Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, April 12, 1848._--Life is very sad and all classes of society\r\nin great agitation. The members of the Diet all left Berlin yesterday\r\nto seek re-election by their constituents. The fate of the country\r\ndepends upon the manner in which this constitutional assembly is to be\r\ncomposed; it is therefore the duty of all right-minded people to\r\nattempt to secure a seat, and such is the general opinion; but many\r\nthings may happen between now and May 22. A net-work of clubs enfolds\r\nthe capital and the provinces ever more closely in its toils;\r\noutbreaks are of constant occurrence in every direction; the temper of\r\nthe militia is doubtful; the audacity of the agitators, foreign\r\ncomplications and the infectious examples which have been set in the\r\nwest and south and in certain disaffected quarters in the north and in\r\nthe east, are enough to make any one lose his head; while the\r\nhesitating attitude of the Government and the absolute abandonment of\r\nany repressive measures are not calculated to restore confidence. The\r\nfifty little tyrants established at Frankfort will certainly do their\r\nbest to turn the balance of things; no one has given them any mandate\r\nand yet every one obeys them.[144] The state of affairs, as we see\r\nit, is utterly inexplicable; forecast is impossible. We must live from\r\nhand to mouth and be satisfied when every twenty-four hours have\r\npassed without some unusual shock. We see many bands of police passing\r\nthrough the town on their way to Posen or Cracow. The Polish\r\nlandowners are giving their peasants full liberty, to avoid the danger\r\nof massacre at their hands. The Polish nationality is in arms against\r\nthe German and no one can see which of the two will emerge triumphant,\r\nif attempts at reconciliation should fail.[145]\r\n\r\n  [144] This assembly was spontaneously convoked at Frankfort to\r\n  provide the country with a centre of action in case the Princes\r\n  declined to support the movement for amalgamation which was then\r\n  in progress among the Germanic races. It was dissolved on April\r\n  2, after securing from the Princes at the Diet the promise that a\r\n  German parliament should meet. A commission, however, was\r\n  appointed by the army consisting of fifty members, to secure the\r\n  execution of this promise, and these members were ordered to\r\n  convoke a national parliament within one month, assuming that a\r\n  parliament had not been already elected by the different states.\r\n\r\n  [145] The news of the Paris Revolution had produced a great\r\n  sensation in the Grand Duchy of Posen. A revolt broke out at\r\n  Posen itself, where Mieroslawski, who was released from prison on\r\n  March 19, formed an army and prepared for war. At Cracow when the\r\n  news of the Vienna disturbances came in, seventy thousand Poles\r\n  went to Count Deyne, the civil commissary, and demanded the\r\n  liberty of four hundred of their compatriots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 20, 1848._--The state of public feeling remains\r\ndisquieting. If the rebels confined their objections merely to the\r\nmoneyed classes, the best of all possible courses would be to let them\r\ntake what they want. People have so little money in hand that they\r\nwould not get much: but in their frenzy they are ready to attack\r\narchives, titles, contracts, and in short anything that determines and\r\nsettles landed tenure. They are also greatly inclined to ill-treat\r\nindividuals and to set fire to barns and buildings, whether they are\r\nopposed or not. The position here has grown a little calmer although\r\nemissaries from the Jacobin club at Breslau appeared two days ago and\r\nare attempting to secure the adherence of the wretched little lawyers\r\nwho are known in Germany as _Die obskure Literatur_. We heard that\r\nthese agitators under pretext of holding a preliminary electoral\r\nmeeting were attempting to raise a mob from the lowest of the people\r\nand to show them the quickest and easiest way of disarming the civil\r\nguard. Fortunately precautions have been taken and I have no doubt\r\nthat if a demonstration should take place, it would be dispersed\r\nwithout bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe wirepullers of the Berlin clubs are agitating against the form of\r\nelection by two stages and are organising a great popular\r\ndemonstration to offer a petition in favour of direct election, to the\r\ncastle and the Ministry. I do not know whether they will be able to\r\nget many workmen together on this political question: possibly they\r\nmight be successful, as the workmen are already greatly disturbed on\r\nthe question of pay; from what I hear they are continually parading\r\nthe streets. The other day there were serious disturbances directed\r\nagainst the bakers who were selling bread by fraudulent weights and\r\nwho certainly deserved a lesson in consequence, though it was not the\r\nbusiness of the people to give it to them. Meanwhile the workmen are\r\ncontracting idle habits and learning to lounge in public: the\r\nworkshops where they desire to work are closed by the wirepullers, and\r\nthe tailors, for instance, are involuntarily on strike. I do not think\r\nthere is any imminent danger of violence, but the general tendency of\r\nthings is bad and may well lead to violence. The Poles have sent their\r\nultimatum to Berlin.[146] They declined to lay down their arms or\r\nseparate until their demands had been conceded. The authorities are\r\nbusy deliberating and find themselves in a difficult position between\r\nthese two peoples, for the Poles decline to consider the demands of\r\nthe Germans who insist upon remaining German, and demand that a line\r\nof demarcation should be drawn, making Posen a German capital and\r\ngiving Gnesen to the Poles.\r\n\r\n  [146] There was no ultimatum properly so-called; this was only a\r\n  newspaper report. The Polish National Committee merely published\r\n  a manifesto proclaiming that until the independence of Poland was\r\n  re-established, the Poles would consider any arbitrary division\r\n  of their national districts as a new partition of Poland, and\r\n  threatened to protest against any such violation before Europe as\r\n  a whole. This protest was eventually made on April 26 by two\r\n  letters from Prince A. Czartoryski, addressed to M. de Lamartine,\r\n  the Minister of Foreign Affairs at Paris, and to Baron Arnim who\r\n  held the same position at Berlin.\r\n\r\nNobody knows what to believe of Italy, as the news from that quarter\r\nis so contradictory. Letters from Vienna are sad and depressing:\r\nEngland offers another spectacle, very different and very glorious for\r\nherself, but I must say that I am furious to see Lord Palmerston, who\r\nhas so largely contributed to this European upheaval, boasting of the\r\ncomfort, of the glory and of the wealth of the English, which\r\nnaturally increases with continental distress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 24, 1848_.--The following is a letter from Vienna sent\r\nto me by the Russian Minister, my cousin Medem: \"Vienna is in a state\r\nof complete depression: there are no social gatherings; the Prater is\r\ndeserted and the Opera is closed, as the public will not allow the\r\nItalians to play. Wallmoden has come to us from Italy; he is said to\r\nbe here in the hopes of arranging a scheme with the Government, if not\r\nfor resuming the offensive in Italy upon a large scale,[147] at any\r\nrate for regaining possession of Venice and the part of Frioul which\r\nis in rebellion. Communications with the army under arms continue to\r\nbe confined to the Tyrolese passes. People are properly indignant at\r\nthe conduct of F. Zichy, of Count Palfy at Venice and Count Ludolf at\r\nTreviso, who capitulated disgracefully without adequate reason.[148]\r\nDissatisfaction and uncertainty of the future is general: every day\r\nthe unpardonable sluggishness of the old administration, both civil\r\nand military, becomes more obvious. Their incompetency is quite\r\nincredible unless one has a knowledge of certain details. The peace of\r\nVienna has not been seriously disturbed of late, but unpleasant\r\ndemonstrations have taken place: these are provoked by unwise people,\r\ngenerally from abroad, who harangue the people in public meetings, in\r\nthe Odeon or in similar places; publications and inflammatory notices\r\nappear everywhere and foment uneasiness in the more sensible part of\r\nthe nation, especially among the upper classes. It is quite time that\r\nthis came to an end, and if it goes on the situation will become\r\ncomplicated. For the moment, at any rate, the state of affairs is much\r\nbetter here than in the capital or the Prussian monarchy, but what\r\nguarantee is there for the future?\"\r\n\r\n  [147] The noble and chivalrous Charles Albert, desiring to throw\r\n  off Austrian influence, had formed a highly organised army\r\n  and proclaimed a constitution. On him the hopes of Italian\r\n  independence were set. Taking advantage of the insurrection which\r\n  had broken out at Milan on March 18 and which had been followed\r\n  by the defeat of the Austrian army and the flight of the Archduke\r\n  Reynier, the King had declared war upon Austria on March 20. At\r\n  first he rapidly carried the positions of the enemy as far as the\r\n  Adige, but he was attacked by superior forces and afterwards (in\r\n  August) he lost the murderous battle of Custozza and was obliged\r\n  to evacuate Milan.\r\n\r\n  [148] After Milan, Venice revolted in turn. On March 20 the\r\n  Arsenal was captured by the insurgents. The civil governor, Count\r\n  Palfy, placed his authority in the hands of Count Zichy, the\r\n  military governor, who hesitated before the prospect of bloodshed\r\n  and finally surrendered to the municipality and made a\r\n  capitulation with the provisional government on March 22; Venice\r\n  was thus freed from the Austrians. On March 21 Treviso had also\r\n  been forced to capitulate and the Austrian garrison had left the\r\n  town.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 30, 1848._--We have now reached the end of the second\r\nmonth of this upheaval, the shocks of which are, I fear, far from\r\nreaching their conclusion. At the present moment Europe is divided\r\nbetween electoral passion and the flames of civil war. Human passion\r\nis displayed in all its hideousness during the rivalry aroused by the\r\nelections: citizens fight with citizens blindly and furiously, while\r\nanarchy, disorder, restlessness, poverty, despondency and despair is\r\nthe picture to be seen everywhere, with a few slight differences.\r\nThose people are only too happy who are but touched by a reaction\r\nwhich has spent its power and contrive to pass the day without\r\npersonal risk, if not without anxiety. Here we shall see what the\r\nelections, which begin to-morrow, will bring forth, and what the\r\nattitude of the country will be during the voting and the counting.\r\nMeanwhile the Press and the clubs are working furiously. Every little\r\ntown has its newspaper and every hamlet its orator. The audiences for\r\nthe most part do not understand what they hear, but they obey like the\r\nsheep of Panurge. The working classes propose to lay down the law to\r\nthe factory directors, who can sell nothing and therefore cannot\r\nincrease or even maintain their output or improve the prospects of\r\ntheir employees. As for the poor people who work upon the land and the\r\nmore prosperous class which finds employment on the railway, their\r\nlabours have come to an end, and one really does not know what to do\r\nfor them. People are dividing with them the last farthing and the corn\r\nfrom the barns, as they are the objects both of pity and fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 5, 1848._--The Grand Duchy of Posen is at present the\r\nscene of the greatest atrocities; civil war is in progress with\r\nunheard of refinements of cruelty. The French newspapers do not know\r\nthese facts or decline to state them, but the details which I have\r\nfrom first hand evidence are enough to make one's hair stand on end.\r\nOn May 1 the Prussians were utterly defeated by the insurgents who,\r\narmed with scythes, disembowelled the horses.[149] Several Polish\r\nlords have been massacred by their peasants, and they can only secure\r\ntheir personal safety by instigating the peasants against the Prussian\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n  [149] The Prussian troops commanded by General Blum, had marched\r\n  upon Miloslaw which they captured after a desperate combat; but\r\n  an advance guard which was pursuing the Poles when approaching a\r\n  wood, was received by so sustained a fire, that the Prussians\r\n  fled, rushed upon their own infantry which was following them,\r\n  broke their ranks and swept the whole force away in rout. The\r\n  Poles pursued the Prussians in turn, drove them out of Miloslaw\r\n  and captured two of their guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 8, 1848._--To-day the electors chosen a week ago are to\r\nappoint the Prussian representatives. I think that undue hopes are\r\nbeing set upon constitutional assemblies, and I fear the result may\r\nshow a general state of delusion. At Vienna the resignation of Count\r\nFicquelmont was one of the most unpleasant incidents in the whole\r\ndrama:[150] some students entered his house, declaring that they would\r\nno longer have him as Minister; he obeyed and would have run great\r\nrisks as he walked to his son-in-law's house if Prince Clary and two\r\nstudents had not acted as his protectors.\r\n\r\n  [150] On May 4 Count Ficquelmont, Minister of Foreign Affairs at\r\n  Vienna, was forced to resign by a tumultuous demonstration of the\r\n  students who regarded him as a pupil of Metternich.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 21, 1848._--The scenes at Paris on the 15th were\r\nfrightful.[151] May Heaven grant that the Moderate Party will use its\r\ntriumph energetically, and that it may not be too often called upon to\r\ncelebrate such victories.\r\n\r\n  [151] For several days manifestations in favour of Poland had\r\n  been proceeding at Paris. On May 15 a band of insurgents attacked\r\n  and invaded the National Assembly, but order was quickly\r\n  restored.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow the constitutional assembly at Berlin is to open. It is so\r\nstrangely composed that any beneficial result will be truly\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 25, 1848._--My mind is full of Rome and of the Pope;[152]\r\nI can think of nothing else. I think that if I had been the Holy\r\nFather I should have set sail for America with a few faithful\r\ncardinals, the poor persecuted monks and nuns and all the money and\r\nholy vessels that could be collected: I should have founded a\r\nsettlement upon the model of that in Paraguay and could thence have\r\ngoverned European catholicism in full independence, just as the\r\nAmerican Catholics have been governed for so long. I think the Romans\r\nwould speedily have cried out for the recall of the Pope; in any case\r\nhe would be at least sheltered from actual indignity and would not be\r\nobliged to sacrifice innocent people and the property of the church.\r\nPossibly my idea is absurd, but at all events there would be something\r\nmagnificent about it; whereas the present scenes display nothing but\r\nhumiliation and degradation.\r\n\r\n  [152] On May 1 a revolutionary movement broke out at Rome, caused\r\n  by the Pope's refusal to declare war against Austria. The\r\n  Ministry resigned: the Pope was threatened with a provisional\r\n  government, and declared in a manifesto that as chief Pontiff he\r\n  could not declare war but that he left the power of declaring war\r\n  as a temporal prince to his Ministry. On May 5 Pius IX. was\r\n  forced to accept a Ministry composed wholly of laymen which was\r\n  constantly in opposition to him.\r\n\r\nI have read with interest and horror the stories of events in Paris on\r\nMay 15 and my opinion is that the work of the deliberative assemblies\r\nwill produce no good effect. I greatly fear that this will be the\r\nconsequence at Berlin, while at Frankfort the assembly is a perfect\r\nbabel. The Prussian newspapers already contain Jacobin outcries\r\nagainst the constitution and I doubt whether the King will be able to\r\ncarry through the two-Chamber system, especially with the small\r\nfragment of hereditary right he is anxious to maintain. Breslau is a\r\nhorrible centre of communism.\r\n\r\nI hear from England that at Claremont domestic quarrels increase the\r\npainful nature of the situation. The sons, disgusted with their forced\r\ninactivity, reproach their father with the loss of his party; he is\r\nwondering what posterity will think of him; and this is all very\r\nunpleasant for poor Queen Amélie whose pride and joy have so long been\r\nthe touching unanimity of her whole family. She is also in a very poor\r\nstate of health. Their financial position approaches poverty.[153]\r\n\r\n  [153] The little exiled court lived very quietly at the seat of\r\n  Claremont in England which belonged to King Leopold who had\r\n  kindly placed it at their disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 28, 1848._--The Duchesse d'Orléans has settled at the\r\ncourt of Eisenach: she lives very quietly with her stepmother and the\r\ntutor[154] of her children, but no other attendants. Her pecuniary\r\nresources are very strained. The castle of Eisenach belongs to the\r\nDuke of Saxe Weimar, the uncle of the Duchesse d'Orléans, who has\r\nplaced it at the disposal of his niece.\r\n\r\n  [154] M. Boismilon.\r\n\r\nI hear from Vienna that all the Hungarians are breaking up their\r\nestablishments and withdrawing either to the country or to Buda or to\r\nPressburg; the Bohemians are going to Prague. In short, the pretty\r\ntown of Vienna, once so cheerful and lively and so aristocratic, is\r\nbecoming a desert and is as depressing as one vast village. Princess\r\nSapieha and Madame de Colleredo have been deeply compromised in the\r\nrecent disturbances; they have been forced to go into hiding. The\r\nArchduke Francis Charles has written from Innsbrück to Lord Ponsonby,\r\nasking him in the Emperor's name to join the court in Tyrol with all\r\nhis colleagues.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulwer has come back from Spain; he had fomented a revolt at\r\nSeville against the Montpensiers who have been obliged to flee to\r\nCadiz; the proverb, \"Like master, like man\" is certainly applicable to\r\nPalmerston and Bulwer.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement continues to prevail in the streets of Berlin, and\r\nthe return of the Prince of Prussia who is expected daily at Potsdam,\r\nwill probably produce an explosion.[155] Meanwhile Berlin is\r\npractically surrounded by a force of sixteen thousand men who can be\r\nused if necessary.\r\n\r\n  [155] It was thought that the Liberalism of Herr von Camphausen\r\n  had sufficiently calmed the popular excitement to allow the\r\n  Prince of Prussia to return to Berlin. At the outbreak of the\r\n  disturbance he had been forced to take refuge in England.\r\n  However, no sooner had the Prince arrived than the Camphausen\r\n  Ministry was overthrown on June 20, after the capture and plunder\r\n  of the Arsenal and the Ministry of Auerswald came into power.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that Madame Dosne is dying with rage to think that\r\nthe revolution could have taken place without being aimed at her\r\nson-in-law. This information may be taken as literally true, as she\r\nwas having her third attack of low fever. I also hear that M. Molé and\r\nM. Thiers are both coming forward as deputies and that M. de\r\nLamartine seems greatly apprehensive that the latter may be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe atrocious scenes at Naples[156] have produced a bad effect at\r\nBerlin and street excitement is said to have become menacing once\r\nmore. The citizens have seized the arsenal.\r\n\r\n  [156] An insurrection had been broken out at Naples. After six\r\n  hours' desperate fighting the royal troops retained possession of\r\n  the town, though they lost three or four hundred men. The Chamber\r\n  and the National Guard were dissolved and a new Ministry was\r\n  formed under the Presidency of Signor Cariati.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 7, 1848._--Mental equanimity depends upon a thousand\r\npetty circumstances in every case. Only those who are very young and\r\nknow nothing of mental trouble, are able to avoid the thousand and one\r\ninfluences of times, places, things, and even of details apparently\r\nmost trivial. I think that Saint Evremond says that the less people\r\nare amenable to pleasure the more they are afflicted by trouble.\r\n\r\nParis seems to be peaceful but at what a price has this result been\r\nobtained? Terrible refinements of cruelty have been committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 12, 1848._--The state of Berlin and Breslau grows\r\nsteadily worse. The provinces are correspondingly affected and I\r\nexpect to see civil war break out any day. The country populations are\r\nready to join the revolutionary movement against their overlords and\r\ntheir priests, but they detest the towns. The peasants do not like the\r\ncitizens and are royalists and supporters of the military, though they\r\nare against the nobles and the priests. The result is a strange\r\nconfusion which heaven alone can disentangle. The assembly which has\r\nmet at Berlin has been hitherto marked by no character except\r\nignorance and disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 18, 1848._--The newspapers and my letters tell me that\r\nGermany is resuming its republican tendencies. Hecker has been elected\r\nfor Frankfort. Confusion is thus inconceivable, especially in view of\r\nthe increasing dislike which France shows for the deplorable\r\ngovernment under which she placed herself four months ago. She must be\r\nreduced to extremities indeed to turn to the Bonapartist flag, so\r\nmiserably represented by Louis Napoleon who is known to be a very poor\r\nfigurehead. And what can be said of the frightful scenes at Prague,\r\nand the assassination of poor Princess Windisch-Graetz.[157] I have\r\nalso been very anxious on account of Berlin, where the pillage of the\r\narsenal and the opposition to the Ministry in the Chamber have\r\ndiminished the prospect of a peaceful solution; three Ministers,\r\nArnim, Schwerin and Kanitz, have resigned.\r\n\r\n  [157] After a bombardment and some street fighting which lasted\r\n  from the 12th to the 17th of June, Prince Windisch-Graetz was\r\n  able to overcome the insurrection at Prague. During these\r\n  struggles his wife was treacherously shot near the window of her\r\n  drawing-room, while standing between her sisters, from the other\r\n  side of the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potsdam, June 23, 1848._--I reached here yesterday after staying for\r\nhalf a day at Berlin. Medem writes from Vienna to his colleague Herr\r\nvon Meyendorff and speaks very mournfully of the vacillation and\r\nuncertainty that have prevailed at Innsbrück since the Baron von\r\nWessenberg has been in power. I am not surprised; Wessenberg is a\r\nkind, clever and good-hearted man, but even from London days I thought\r\nhim muddle-headed and this is a terrible hindrance to the conduct of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nI have news of Prince Metternich: he is sending his sons to a Catholic\r\ncollege in England as he finds no one who will join his fate and act\r\nas tutor; he is also troubled by pecuniary embarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe reigning Grand Duke of Mecklenberg-Schwerin has increased the\r\nsettlements upon his stepmother, in order that the Duchesse d'Orléans\r\nand her children may gain indirectly a means of greater comfort in\r\nlife; a noble and tactful action.\r\n\r\nThe ministerial crisis here is still in progress and the street uproar\r\nhas been thus succeeded by a political disturbance which is no less\r\ndangerous, when a Chamber is composed of ill-assorted elements as that\r\nof Berlin. There was a rumour yesterday evening that a telegram from\r\nFrankfort stated that the assembly in that town had elected a\r\ndictator for Germany in the person of the Archduke John.[158] Here\r\nthere was a wish for a triumvirate. Rumour consequently arose that\r\nPrussia had replied to this news by a protest.\r\n\r\n  [158] In the National Assembly at Frankfort the Committee of the\r\n  Fifty had been tempted several times to form a triumvirate as a\r\n  centre of power. Eventually a commission of eleven deputies was\r\n  elected in June. This commission appointed Archduke John for\r\n  Austria, the old Prince William for Prussia, and Prince Charles\r\n  for Bavaria. The combination was ironically known as the\r\n  directory of the three uncles, these princes being the uncles of\r\n  the kings of their respective countries. The proposal was\r\n  vigorously opposed, and the Session of June 23 eventually elected\r\n  the Archduke John as sole director. A deputation offered the\r\n  dignity to the Archduke who accepted it, and appeared in the\r\n  National Assembly on the following 12th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 28, 1848._--I have returned to my domestic hearth. Though\r\nI have hitherto had no great reason to complain of my own corner of\r\nthe world, I none the less feel that the earth is mined and is\r\ntrembling beneath my feet. The district that I have just left seems to\r\nme to be terribly unsafe. At Paris blood is flowing.[159] For some\r\ndays our knowledge of events there has been confined to telegraphic\r\nnews from Brussels and is very uncertain. I merely know that my\r\nchildren are not in the town.\r\n\r\n  [159] When seven thousand workmen had been dismissed from the\r\n  national workshops, a further outbreak caused much bloodshed in\r\n  Paris for four days. On that occasion the Archbishop, Mgr. Affre,\r\n  was killed upon one of the barricades where he was attempting to\r\n  pacify the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, July 6, 1848._--The struggle in Paris has kept me in a state\r\nof great alarm; fortunately none of my intimate connections have\r\nsuffered anything beyond terror and panic. At present the country\r\ndistricts are becoming dangerous, and so my daughter Pauline has\r\nreturned to the city with her son.\r\n\r\nHere we are very little better off than in France, and when I consider\r\nthe many centres of communistic doctrine in this part of Europe, I\r\ncannot close my eyes to the dangers that threaten us; the less so, as\r\nI am far from thinking that they can be crushed in the manner employed\r\nby Prince Windisch-Graetz at Prague and General Cavaignac at Paris. I\r\npropose to betake myself to Teplitz in a few days and am only awaiting\r\nan assurance that that part of Bohemia has been pacified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Teplitz, July 18, 1848._--My journey here from Sagan passed off\r\nwithout incident, but poverty and restlessness are everywhere\r\nprevalent. The little kingdom of Saxony is, however, less disturbed\r\nthan Prussia or than the Saxon Duchies of Thuringen, where the feeling\r\nis pre-eminently republican. At Dresden the Ministry is so Radical\r\nthat revolutionaries could hardly wish for anything more. There is\r\nalso an idea that the Saxon duchies would be united under the single\r\nand by no means monarchical sceptre of the good King of Saxony, who\r\nretains hardly a shadow of his royal power. Hitherto he has been saved\r\nby the fact that his Minister of the Interior wears no hat or\r\ngloves.[160] He is simply a rustic but is said to be honourable enough\r\nnot to betray his master. Teplitz is almost empty and no one thinks of\r\ntravelling. Apart from the Clarys and the Ficquelmonts, there is no\r\none here except a few obscure paralytics. Herr von Ficquelmont regards\r\nthe prospects of the Austrian empire in a very gloomy light and seems\r\nto disbelieve any possibility that the Archduke John may save it or\r\nthat he may improve the future of Germany. His dealings with the\r\nVienna students are either hypocritical or are prompted by unworthy or\r\nspeculative ambition. At Frankfort he will soon have to struggle\r\nagainst the separatist tendencies, which are continually becoming more\r\nobvious in Prussia, not merely in high places where they might well\r\ncome to nothing, but to an even greater extent among the masses, who\r\nhave been wounded in their interests and their pride.\r\n\r\n  [160] Herr von Pfördten.\r\n\r\n_Teplitz, July 22, 1844._--We hear that there is still some\r\ndisturbance at Prague, though it is sternly repressed by the iron hand\r\nof Prince Windisch-Graetz. Vienna remains in a complete state of\r\nanarchy. Herr von Ficquelmont told me yesterday that the population of\r\nBerlin was more tumultuous and more vicious than that of Vienna and\r\nthat the governmental and administrative machinery was in far better\r\norder at Berlin than at Vienna. On the whole, they are two centres of\r\ndisaffection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eisenach, August 8, 1848._--The Duchesse d'Orléans whom I have come\r\nto see is much changed and complains that she grows steadily weaker.\r\nHowever, she remains calm and reasonable and is not so disinclined as\r\nshe was at first to open connections with the older branch of the\r\nfamily. However, the possibility of forming any such project seems\r\nremote. There is a feeling that dignity must be maintained, while at\r\nthe same time no stone should be left unturned to improve the chances\r\nof the future. She is entirely without prejudice; her insight is clear\r\nand her judgment seems to be more direct and to have been fortified by\r\nthe great lessons of recent events. She was quite open and kind\r\ntowards me; remembrances of the Duc d'Orléans give us a real interest\r\nin one another, and she expressed this fact very graciously by telling\r\nme that for her I stood outside all family questions. She called her\r\nsons and said to them, \"Kiss your father's most faithful friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, August 13, 1848._--Every evening there is some small\r\nexcitement in the streets which is fomented by the deplorable\r\nproceedings of the assembly; moreover, the financial Minister, Herr\r\nHanseman, is proposing laws destined to conclude our ruin. Claims are\r\nbeing laid by the former provinces which may degenerate into revolts\r\nand lead to civil war. The Pan-Germanic party and the Prussian\r\nseparatists, between whom the country is divided, are already\r\nconfronting one another in a hostile temper which makes the conflict\r\nimminent. No one can tell what the future may bring forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, September 9, 1848._--The ministerial crisis at Berlin seems to\r\nmake a catastrophe imminent.[161] Civil war or foreign war may be\r\nexpected and also a breach between the two constitutional assemblies\r\nof Frankfort and Berlin. In short, numberless eventualities present\r\nthemselves and meanwhile private life becomes more and more\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n  [161] The discussions concerning the proposal of a deputy, Herr\r\n  Stein, with reference to the army and to the control which the\r\n  Ministry should exert upon the political opinions of officers,\r\n  were concluded in the Chamber against the desires of the Cabinet.\r\n  The Auerswald Ministry therefore resigned on September 11; on the\r\n  22nd of the same month the King appointed a new Cabinet of which\r\n  General Pfuel was President.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, September 16, 1848._--There are no Ministers at Frankfort[162]\r\nand none at Berlin. There is a total want of energy at Sans Souci and\r\nunfortunately the troops are showing symptoms of disaffection. Use was\r\nnot made of them at the proper time, and agitators have been allowed\r\nto seize the opportunity for shaking their fidelity. The absence of\r\nall legal authority has again aroused the arbitrary greed of the rural\r\npopulations, while the Chambers have failed to satisfy their anxiety\r\nfor a definite settlement with the overlords: thus burning and pillage\r\nhave been begun once more in Upper Silesia. Rothschild of Vienna who\r\nhad a fine estate there has just seen it utterly ruined. The fact is\r\nthat another bad outbreak is in progress and I am more anxious now\r\nthan I have ever been, seeing that the loyalty of the troops has\r\nbecome doubtful.\r\n\r\n  [162] It will be remembered that the populations of Schleswig and\r\n  Holstein, who wished to be united with Germany, had revolted\r\n  against Denmark, and that the Prussians had come to their help.\r\n  After several bloody conflicts an armistice was concluded between\r\n  Denmark and Prussia at Malmæ on August 26, but the National\r\n  Assembly at Frankfort refused to assent to this armistice on the\r\n  ground that Prussia did not ask its authorisation. The council of\r\n  Ministers and all the Ministers of the Empire had thereupon\r\n  resigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 1, 1848._--Things here are going from bad to worse.\r\nThe other night some evil-minded persons exploded bombs near the\r\ncastle. Our precautions have been taken; my army of defence has been\r\norganised and if we are to perish it will not be without a struggle. I\r\nshall not run away, for I have no personal fear, as I am totally\r\nindifferent on my own account; and then people are always overawed by\r\ncourage and determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 5, 1848._--The château of Prince Hatzfeldt has been\r\nattacked by peasants;[163] four of his farms have been burnt, and he\r\nhas been obliged to flee. Here everything is comparatively quiet so\r\nfar, but the morrow belongs to no one.\r\n\r\n  [163] The Château of Trachenberg, not far from Breslau.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 9, 1848._--The post and the Vienna newspapers have\r\nfailed to reach us since the day before yesterday. Current rumour\r\nascribes this absence of direct news to sanguinary causes which are\r\nonly too probable at the present time. Every day brings some fresh\r\nhorrors.[164] Last week we heard of the massacre of Count Lamberg at\r\nBuda;[165] the hanging of poor Eugène Zichy[166] who was so happy and\r\nso great a favourite at Paris ten years ago; he was hung by these\r\nbarbarians in the island where robbers are executed. Yesterday we\r\nheard of the murder of the Comte de la Tour, Minister of War at\r\nVienna, and of General Brédy.[167] The Black and Yellow party is\r\nfighting in the streets against the Hungarian party. If the Anarchist\r\nparty triumphs at Vienna[168] it will be all up with Berlin and\r\nBreslau where people are living upon a powder-mine.\r\n\r\n  [164] In the morning of October 6 a number of the population of\r\n  Vienna opposed the departure of the troops which were marching\r\n  upon Hungary to reinforce Baron Jellachich, and a bloodthirsty\r\n  struggle broke out. The residence of the Minister of War was\r\n  captured by assault, and the Minister, the Comte de la Tour, was\r\n  stabbed, hung to a lamp-post, and riddled with bullets. The\r\n  troops retired, were driven back at every point and forced to\r\n  evacuate the town. The Emperor and the Imperial Family, who had\r\n  returned to Vienna in the month of August, were obliged to retire\r\n  once more and went towards Olmütz. There the emperor abdicated on\r\n  December 2 in favour of his nephew, Francis Joseph I.\r\n\r\n  [165] General Count Lamberg had been appointed Commander-in-Chief\r\n  of the Hungarian troops on September 25: the National Assembly at\r\n  Pesth refused to recognise this nomination and declared all\r\n  guilty of high treason who should obey him, and on his arrival at\r\n  Pesth put him to death on the bridge which unites Buda and Pesth.\r\n\r\n  [166] When Hungary was in a state of insurrection, the insurgents\r\n  seized Count Eugène Zichy, accused him of communicating with the\r\n  Austrian Army and of distributing copies of the emperor's\r\n  proclamation. He was tried before a court presided over by\r\n  Georgei and was condemned to death and shot in the island of\r\n  Czepel and not hung, as the first rumour related.\r\n\r\n  [167] General Brédy was killed at Vienna on October 6, 1848,\r\n  during the struggle between the people and the National Guard in\r\n  the suburb of Leopoldstadt, a few hours before the insurgents\r\n  seized the residence of the Minister of War.\r\n\r\n  [168] By the Black and Yellow party is meant the Imperial party,\r\n  the members of which wore these colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 25, 1848._--Everything here is in suspense and\r\neverything is being settled at Vienna. Hitherto it seems that the\r\nloyal army will dictate laws, but we dare not trust to these gleams of\r\nhope. In Austria, at any rate, an honourable struggle is in progress,\r\nand if failure should come honour will not be lost. As much cannot,\r\nunfortunately, be said of Berlin, and even if the side of right should\r\ntriumph at Vienna will the victory be final? I doubt it and I fear we\r\nshall be living for a long time on a volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 4, 1848._--A revolutionary outburst has just taken\r\nplace at Liegnitz, comparatively close to me. It was necessary to use\r\nmilitary force to quell it. At Berlin there is a riot almost every\r\nday; audacity and weakness daily increase. Yesterday the Ministry was\r\nat last changed: this might indicate a desire to revive energy; I fear\r\nthat it is too late. The Assembly has been besieged, the Deputies and\r\nthe Diplomatic Body imprisoned and threatened with hanging; the\r\nNational Guard has been betrayed by its leader, while Sans Souci has\r\nbeen completely paralysed in the face of these events; and yet people\r\nask if there is still any room for hope.[169] The successful measures\r\nat Vienna have not succeeded in inspiring Potsdam with any energy, and\r\nhave greatly exasperated the anarchists who wish to deliver some\r\nstriking blow to recover their power and to form a centre at Berlin\r\nfor spreading their influence throughout Germany. The part played by\r\nM. Arago, the Minister of the French Republic, during recent days at\r\nBerlin, has been extremely ambiguous,[170] and any self-respecting\r\nGovernment would have sent him his passports, and lodged an official\r\ncomplaint at Paris. My wishes for Vienna have at length been realised.\r\nWindisch-Graetz has shown infinite patience and kindness, and only\r\nwhen the capitulation of the 30th was treacherously violated did he\r\nrage as he was bound to do, and as the infamy of the native\r\nauthorities in Vienna deserved. We are still without details, but the\r\nmain facts are official and we must regard them as providential. God\r\ngrant that this may be the starting-point of a new era. Meanwhile\r\nanarchy, disorder, the want of repressive measures, and poverty are\r\nruining the provinces. Orators are preaching murder and pillage\r\nunpunished to their popular meetings, and the results of these\r\nincendiary harangues may soon be expected. Really the state of things\r\nis frightful.\r\n\r\n  [169] On October 16 a further and bloodthirsty outbreak took\r\n  place at Berlin, ending in a collision between the National Guard\r\n  and the workmen. The result was to revive the agitation which had\r\n  prevailed in this town with short intermissions since the month\r\n  of March.\r\n\r\n  [170] M. Arago, the French Minister, showed himself to the crowd\r\n  which was cheering him before his residence. He uttered a few\r\n  words in French and held out his hand to the people who were\r\n  nearest to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 19, 1848._--I think it would be advisable for Austria\r\nto add to such determined warriors as Jellachich, Radetzky, and\r\nWindisch-Graetz a younger and stronger politician than Wessenberg. It\r\nis said that such a man would be found in Prince Felix of\r\nSchwarzenberg; he has good friends, and has often been the object of\r\ngreat admiration. I saw him pretty frequently at Naples two years ago,\r\nand he showed me much kindness. He was a man of distinguished manner,\r\nclever, dignified, and cool, and his opinions and his speech were well\r\nweighed; but I do not know him well enough to say whether he will be\r\nequal to the heavy task which seems likely to fall upon him. Stadion,\r\nwho is to share it with him, has been a friend of his youth, and their\r\nunanimity may produce fortunate results. I see nothing of the kind in\r\nprospect for Prussia, where warriors and writers, men of eloquence and\r\naction, appear to be utterly wanting in the present crisis. Every\r\nattempt now made is marked by a certain tactlessness which is far from\r\ninspiring me with confidence.[171] They are sheltering themselves\r\nbehind Frankfort, and looking there for refuge, support, and\r\nprotection. It is undignified, and makes no impression upon the enemy,\r\nwhile I think that this bulwark will prove to be futile. We must hope\r\nthat the army is loyal, but we cannot help recognising that it is\r\nwithout enthusiasm, while its ardour is allowed to cool and disappear.\r\nThe soldiers who are bivouacking in the streets of Berlin are\r\nsuffering from the bad weather and are greatly depressed, so persons\r\nsay who write to me and who are busy distributing soup and beer to\r\nsupport their strength and encourage their loyalty.\r\n\r\n  [171] A new Ministry, of which Count Brandenburg was President\r\n  and Herr von Manteuffel was Minister of the Interior, had been\r\n  appointed at Berlin on November 8. Its very first administrative\r\n  act ended in a defeat: an ordinance of the King countersigned by\r\n  the Count of Brandenburg transferred the National Assembly to the\r\n  town of Brandenburg; the Assembly decided against this\r\n  transference by a vast majority, and as the Government could not\r\n  continue amid this increasing anarchy, it resolved upon vigorous\r\n  action. On November 10 a considerable number of troops were\r\n  drafted into the capital and occupied the entrance to the\r\n  Assembly room. The Assembly protested against this violence, and\r\n  an ordinance of the King then declared the civil guard disbanded;\r\n  another ordinance issued on the 12th proclaimed Berlin to be in a\r\n  state of siege. General Wrangel commanded the military forces and\r\n  every measure was taken to avoid a collision.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 26, 1848._--The last week has been a very difficult\r\ntime; since Berlin was proclaimed to be in a state of siege all\r\ndisaffected elements have fallen back upon Silesia; my workmen have\r\nbeen fired upon, and the red flag has been carried about. In fact, the\r\nsituation looked menacing; but now that thirty thousand troops are\r\nsweeping the province we can breathe again, and if I can believe my\r\nlast letters from Berlin, we are to enter upon a new era. On this\r\nsubject I admit my incredulity, and I fear that it will not be\r\ndispelled for a long time; but the fact remains that disturbances have\r\nceased for the moment, and for so much we ought to be grateful, for\r\nthe feverish state of tension was becoming unbearable.\r\n\r\nThe death of Madame de Montjoye has filled the cup of misfortune for\r\npoor Queen Marie Amélie, whose only and most intimate confidential\r\nfriend she was. As a result of drinking poisoned water at\r\nClaremont,[172] I hear that the King's teeth have become black.\r\nRelations between the King and his children are not invariably\r\nsatisfactory, nor are the children agreed among themselves. Providence\r\nis subjecting these _émigrés_ to every kind of hardship; possibly it\r\nis an expiation for the vote of the father and the usurpation of the\r\nson.\r\n\r\n  [172] In November 1848 the whole of the Royal Family had suffered\r\n  from poisoning in consequence of the leaden pipes through which\r\n  the water was carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 1, 1848._--To-day the newspapers announce the\r\nprogramme of the new Austrian Cabinet,[173] which was very well\r\nreceived at Kremsier and has produced a rise in Austrian stocks. May\r\nGod give us a strong and clever Cabinet, at any rate in that quarter.\r\nThe Cabinet which ought to govern in Prussia, and which appeared ready\r\nto assume the iron glove, seems to me to show nothing but weakness,\r\nwhile the glove is distinctly rusty. All good Catholics will be\r\ngreatly moved by the fate of Pius IX. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nwith greater zeal than prudence he ran to liberal extremes, he remains\r\nthe head of our church, the priest of God and a kind man, and his\r\ndanger should stir our hearts to pity and to fear.[174] I hear from\r\nBerlin that Herr von Gagern has failed in his proposed object, and\r\nthat the King was stronger than was thought, for he has thrust aside\r\nthe show of Imperialism which Gagern had offered him on the condition\r\nthat for this occasion only he would submit to the laws of the\r\nFrankfort Government.[175]\r\n\r\n  [173] The Austrian Diet had been sitting since November 15 at\r\n  Kremsier in Moravia, in the beautiful castle of the Archbishops\r\n  of Olmütz. The new Ministry was composed as follows: Prince Felix\r\n  of Schwarzenberg, President of the Council and Minister of\r\n  Foreign Affairs; Stadion, Minister of the Interior; Krauss,\r\n  Financial Minister; Bach, Legal Minister; Gordon, Minister of\r\n  War; Bruck, Minister of Commerce; Thinnfeld, Minister of\r\n  Agriculture; Kulmer, unattached.\r\n\r\n  [174] The Pope had given his subjects a constitution on March 14,\r\n  and after changing his Ministry several times he had at length\r\n  decided on December 15 to appoint as his Prime Minister,\r\n  Pellegrino Rossi, formerly French Ambassador to His Holiness and\r\n  a personal friend of M. Guizot. Rossi undertook to establish a\r\n  regular parliamentary government in the Papal States, relying\r\n  upon the middle classes and intervening between the parties in\r\n  opposition. He was not given the time to carry out his proposals:\r\n  on November 15, as he was going to a Cabinet Council, he was\r\n  stabbed in the throat by a militiaman and fell dead. This deed\r\n  was a signal for a republican rising. The Pope confined himself\r\n  to appointing a new Minister who was out of sympathy with the\r\n  people, upon which the mob and the troops made their way to the\r\n  Quirinal and ordered the Pope to change his Ministers. Pius IX.,\r\n  who was supported by the diplomatic body, declined to accede, and\r\n  popular exasperation then reached its height. A desperate\r\n  struggle broke out between the people and the guards, and the\r\n  bullets even reached the interior of the palace. Eventually the\r\n  Pope yielded under protest and consented to accept as his\r\n  Ministers Sterbini, Galletti, Mamiani, and the Abbé Rosmini. But\r\n  on November 25, dressed as an ordinary Abbé, he left Rome and\r\n  sought the protection of the King of Naples at Gaeta, from which\r\n  town he sent a protest to the Romans against recent events.\r\n\r\n  [175] Herr von Gagern, who had undertaken to draw up a\r\n  constitution for the Empire at Frankfort and to settle the\r\n  central power upon a permanent basis, had come to Berlin to\r\n  examine the situation and to learn whether the King of Prussia\r\n  would be inclined to place himself at the head of the German\r\n  Empire in the event of a rupture between Austria and Germany. The\r\n  King absolutely declined this proposal, which was afterwards\r\n  brought before him once more with more official authority in\r\n  March 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 6, 1848._--Rumour here very generally asserts that\r\nthe worst of the storm has passed. I am by no means sure of the fact;\r\nelectoral excitement will soon begin when the attempt is made to work\r\nthe constitution that has been granted, and the results seem very\r\nuncertain. Anything, in truth, is better than this state of decay and\r\nconfusion in which we are here perishing, but though the danger may\r\nassume new forms, it will not pass so quickly. The country is\r\ncertainly becoming somewhat enlightened and growing weary of the state\r\nof things which reduces every one to utter misery; some better\r\ninstincts are asserting themselves. On the twenty-fifth anniversary\r\nof the King's marriage there was a favourable display of feeling, but\r\ntoo many elements of disaffection are still powerful and the\r\nGovernment cannot make itself respected. In Southern Germany,\r\nespecially in Bavaria, people still seem to be in love with the\r\nproposal for sharing the power among three, particularly since Austria\r\nhas concentrated her members to form one great monarchy. The old\r\nPrince William of Prussia who was nominated as a possible member of\r\nthe triumvirate, has fallen into a state of mental weakness which\r\nwould make him incapable of undertaking this task. Moreover, his son,\r\nPrince Waldemar, is dying at Münster of a spinal disease; it is a sad\r\nbusiness, for he is a distinguished Prince and his death will be a\r\nfinal blow to his poor father. I doubt if the central power will last\r\nvery long, as the King of Prussia mercifully persists in his refusal\r\nto accept the burden. It is said that the Princess of Prussia would\r\nhave liked to see Herr von Gagern at the head of a new Prussian\r\nCabinet. I do not think that this haughty character would have been\r\nwilling to take so uncertain a position or to confront a Chamber so\r\nlittle amenable to parliamentary eloquence. In any case the King has\r\nrejected all insinuations, direct or indirect. It would indeed have\r\nbeen both foolish and utterly ungrateful on his part to dismiss the\r\nonly Ministry which has had the courage and the capacity to raise the\r\nprestige of the Crown in some small degree and to turn events in the\r\ndirection of conservatism.\r\n\r\nItaly is in a pitiable condition. M. de Broglie will doubtless be\r\ndeeply grieved at the death of M. Rossi, as it was he who brought M.\r\nRossi to France, introduced him to politics, raised him to the\r\npeerage, and finally advanced him to the Embassy at Rome. I saw a\r\ngreat deal of him in the salon of Madame de Broglie, and afterwards at\r\nRome; he seemed to me to be an astute and unpretentious character,\r\nless noble but cleverer than Capo d'Istria.[176] Their assassination\r\nwas due to the same cause; both attempted to play the part of\r\nRichelieu without due preparation.\r\n\r\n  [176] Like Pellegrino Rossi, Capo d'Istria suffered a violent\r\n  death. He was accused by the Greeks of acting merely as the tool\r\n  of Russia, and of using arbitrary methods to secure governmental\r\n  power. He was assassinated in 1831 by the brothers George and\r\n  Constantine Mavromichali, who wished to take vengeance upon him\r\n  for the unjust imprisonment of their father and brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 30, 1848._--The calm amid which Napoleon has assumed\r\nthe chief power in France would tend to show that a desire for order\r\nand peace is rising in the country. Rumours are abroad of the\r\nabdication of the King of Sardinia and of a new and warlike Sardinian\r\nMinistry.[177] I hope that Radetzky will bring the rest of Italy to\r\nreason as he has done in Lombardy. Windisch-Graetz is before Raab, and\r\nit is hoped that he will have no great difficulty in entering the\r\ntown. Great cold delays his march, and he is also hampered by the\r\nnecessity of reorganising the civil government in the districts which\r\nhe occupies.[178] Jellachich has been carried away by his impetuosity\r\nand captured temporarily by the Hungarians.[179] He was rescued by his\r\nsoldiers. Windisch-Graetz has bitterly reproached him for his blind\r\nrashness which might have compromised the fate of the army, and the\r\nvital question of the Government. The Archduchess Sophie gave her son,\r\nthe young Emperor, as a Christmas present a frame containing the\r\nportraits of Radetzky, Windisch-Graetz, and Jellachich. It is well to\r\nremind Sovereigns by outward signs of the duty of gratitude, which, as\r\na rule, they find somewhat burdensome. And so the disastrous year of\r\n1848 comes to an end! Heaven grant that 1849 may bring some\r\nimprovement in our lives!\r\n\r\n  [177] King Charles Albert did not abdicate until after the battle\r\n  of Novara on March 23, 1849.\r\n\r\n  [178] About December 15 Prince Windisch-Graetz at the head of the\r\n  Austrian troops drove the Hungarians out of one position after\r\n  another, until they retired behind the bastions of Raab, under\r\n  the command of Georgei. As the great cold prevented their\r\n  reinforcements from coming up, the Hungarians were obliged to\r\n  abandon this position, which the Austrians captured without\r\n  striking a blow, on December 27.\r\n\r\n  [179] On September 29, 1848, near Veneleze, twelve miles away\r\n  from Ofen, Jellachich was utterly defeated by General Moga. His\r\n  army took flight and Jellachich was taken prisoner. He succeeded\r\n  in escaping, however, and made his way through the forests to\r\n  Mor, Risber, and at length to Raab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 11, 1849._--M. Arago has at length left Berlin, where\r\nhe is detested. There seems to be some idea that the Prince of the\r\nMoskowa will come as French Minister, though it is not thought likely\r\nthat he will make a long stay. The Grand Duchess Stephanie is going to\r\nParis, but will probably do no more than make a hurried and agitated\r\nvisit to her cousin, the President of the Republic, and obtain some\r\nsmall reflection of his Imperial grandeur. However, Princess Mathilde\r\nwill not leave him the pleasure of doing the honours of the\r\nPresidency, which she seems to have reserved for herself. The whole\r\nbusiness can hardly be taken seriously.[180]\r\n\r\n  [180] Prince Louis Bonaparte had been nominated President on\r\n  November 10, 1848. M. Molé related that on the morning of that\r\n  day General Changarnier, the commander of the troops who were to\r\n  take the President to the Elysée, after he had taken the oath,\r\n  came to M. Molé and asked for directions, and said as he went\r\n  out, \"Well, supposing I take him to the Tuileries instead of to\r\n  the Elysée!\" to which M. Molé replied, \"Mind you do nothing of\r\n  the sort; he will go there soon enough of his own accord.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 18, 1849._--The meetings preliminary to the Prussian\r\nelections give no great hope of a definite result. The Brandenburg\r\nMinistry, lest it should be accused of reaction, is pursuing the\r\nbarren paths of Liberalism. The Grand Duchess Stephanie, who seems to\r\nhave been aroused from long unconsciousness of my existence, writes in\r\ngreat depression and anxiety concerning the fate of the German Rhine\r\nprovinces. Apparently the Grand Duke of Baden has threatened to\r\nwithdraw her settlements if she spends them in France. I have also a\r\nletter full of dignity and affectionate trust from the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans. I propose to go to Dresden next week, to spend a few days\r\nthere with my sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, January 28, 1849._--At Frankfort the future head of Germany\r\nwas refused hereditary rights and even life tenure of power, and it\r\ntherefore seems impossible that the King of Prussia could undertake a\r\nposition of this kind.[181] This was a clever Austrian intrigue to\r\ndisqualify the King, and to overthrow the whole of this ridiculous and\r\nabominable invention, which has produced nothing but ruin and\r\ndisorder. The Prussian elections are not very hopeful, not so\r\nunfavourable as those of last year, but very far from giving rise to\r\nany real hope. What could be expected from the electoral law which has\r\nbeen granted here? We have mad Chambers, which no one can govern and\r\nno one dare dissolve. I found the Saxon Court very sad. Dresden is\r\nfull of people, but it is difficult to meet any one.\r\n\r\n  [181] The greatest confusion prevailed in Frankfort as soon as\r\n  the question arose of providing a definite head to the German\r\n  Empire, and realising the fine promises of union by means of a\r\n  practical conclusion. Austria pretended to adopt a waiting\r\n  attitude which would enable her to stand apart from all details,\r\n  as though she had no idea of entering into relations with Germany\r\n  until Germany became a constituted state. Her intention, in\r\n  short, was to take no steps with reference to her union with\r\n  Germany until the choice of the head of the empire and of\r\n  pre-eminence was decided in her favour or against her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, February 12, 1849._--I passed through Berlin on my return\r\njourney. The town is now swarming with little German princes, asking\r\nfor mediatisation as the only means of safety; they offer themselves\r\nto Prussia, who refuses them for scrupulous reasons of every kind.\r\nPrussia thinks it dangerous to set such an example; tradition and the\r\nhistorical past of the monarchy are also influential forces; in short,\r\nthese poor princes will all go as they have come, and in spite of the\r\nsomewhat vague promises of protection which they have received as a\r\ncrumb of comfort, they will probably be driven out of their homes some\r\nday or other and reduced to beggary. Count von Bülow, Prussian\r\nMinister at Frankfort, is inclined to support the Frankfort Assembly;\r\nCharlottenberg takes the contrary view; the result is an unpleasant\r\nhitch in proceedings, while the relations between Kremsier and Berlin\r\nare characterised by marked coldness, to the great displeasure of the\r\nKing. I know nothing of this M. de Lurde who is taking the place of M.\r\nArago as French Minister at Berlin, but he may easily appear to\r\nadvantage in comparison with his predecessor, who could speak only of\r\nthe great-heartedness and the noble soul of Barbès!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 1, 1849._--If I am to believe letters from Paris, there\r\nis a general revival in progress, and a complete reaction in favour of\r\norder and prosperity. Praises of the new President are general. M.\r\nThiers said of him, \"He is not Cæsar, but he is Augustus.\" The\r\nLegitimists throng his rooms, and after the ball nothing could be\r\nheard but the shouts of servants--\"The carriage of Madame la Duchesse,\r\nof M. le Prince,\" &c. The President is addressed as _Monseigneur_, a\r\ntitle anything but Republican. I am told that this practice is\r\nfollowed in the provinces. I must say that I rather distrust these\r\nsudden changes, but the present moment seems satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 31, 1849._--The political horizon causes me much\r\nanxiety. Clouds seem to be rising once more, instead of dispersing.\r\nThis unfortunate proposal of an Imperial Crown does not tempt the\r\nKing, but pleases those about him, the young officers of the\r\nbureaucracy, whose petty pride finds matter for self-satisfaction. The\r\nLeft, perfidiously supporting the proposal, are well aware that the\r\nso-called Imperial dignity would subject the King to the orders of the\r\ndemocratic professors of Frankfort. The bad weather and the abominable\r\nstate of the roads delay the subjugation of Hungary.[182] The only\r\nconsolation is the success of Radetzky, and this has been gained at\r\nwhat a price! We have no details yet of his last two victories, and\r\nhave only heard of the abdication of Charles Albert. The actual names\r\nof the victims are unknown.[183]\r\n\r\n  [182] This war, which began upon the accession of Francis Joseph\r\n  to the Austrian throne, lasted for three years. Hungary\r\n  eventually yielded before the overwhelming force of Austria in\r\n  alliance with Russia.\r\n\r\n  [183] As France and England had offered to intervene between\r\n  Austria and Sardinia, the armistice between these two powers,\r\n  which was signed on August 9, 1848, was tacitly prolonged to the\r\n  end of the negotiations. As the negotiations came to nothing,\r\n  Sardinia at length denounced the armistice on March 12, 1849, and\r\n  hostilities began again upon the 20th of the month. On March 23\r\n  the Sardinian army performed prodigies of valour in the decisive\r\n  battle of Novara, but the commanding officer, the Polish General,\r\n  Chrzanowski, made deplorable mistakes and Austria was once again\r\n  successful. King Charles Albert asked Marshal Radetzky for a\r\n  further armistice, but the conditions offered were so harsh that\r\n  the King refused to accept them, abdicated in favour of Victor\r\n  Emmanuel, and went into exile. On the 27th the new King went to\r\n  Marshal Radetzky's headquarters, and after a long conversation,\r\n  signed an armistice which lasted until the eventual conclusion of\r\n  peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 13, 1849._--Kind Lady Westmoreland gave me the pleasant\r\nsurprise of a two days' visit; she arrived yesterday to my great\r\ndelight. She is a clever, lively, affectionate, and really charming\r\nfriend, with warm memories of the late M. de Talleyrand, and talks of\r\nthe past and the present with keen interest and intelligence. We\r\ndiscussed pleasant memories in England; tried as we both are by the\r\nsadness of the present time, we prefer to avoid melancholy\r\ncontemplation of so deplorable a subject and to look backwards,\r\nrecovering some of those precious memories which I should be inclined\r\nto style \"the savings of my heart.\" Thus I take refuge in the past as\r\nI dare not question the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 21, 1849._--Yesterday I received letters from Paris\r\nwhich say that, notwithstanding the efforts of the Union in the Rue de\r\nPoitiers,[184] communism is making great progress in France.\r\n\r\n  [184] The Electoral Union or the famous committee of the Rue de\r\n  Poitiers, was formed at the beginning of 1849 by the conservative\r\n  right to guide the elections and to oppose the democratic\r\n  socialistic committee.\r\n\r\nIt is thought at Berlin that the Frankfort parliament will pursue a\r\nwholly revolutionary course and form an executive committee and a\r\ncommittee of public safety. In that case it would bring troops from\r\nBaden and Nassau in the certainty that the garrison of Mayence would\r\nnot be led against Frankfort, and able thus to profit by the continual\r\nvacillation of Prussia.[185] The asserted adherence of twenty-eight\r\nlittle German governments is sheer effrontery, as their agreement is\r\nonly conditional: they will only join the Prussian banner if,\r\nfollowing the example of these little governments, Prussia submits to\r\nthe constitution drawn up at Frankfort. The four kings of Saxony,\r\nBavaria, Hanover, and Würtemberg refuse their assent.\r\n\r\n  [185] The King of Prussia had been elected on March 28 as Emperor\r\n  of the Germans at the Frankfort Assembly, and a deputation\r\n  immediately started to offer him this title. The deputation was\r\n  received by Frederick William IV. on April 3, who replied that he\r\n  would only accept the position when the kings, the princes, and\r\n  the free towns of Germany had given their voluntary assent. After\r\n  long negotiations the mission of the Frankfort deputies proved a\r\n  failure.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the affairs of Denmark, Prussia would be able to\r\nfortify herself at home, a necessity which she is far from meeting at\r\npresent, and make head against the Frankfort storm; but General von\r\nPritwitz has submitted to the so-called Frankfort government.[186]\r\nDenmark would not be likely to treat with a Government so irregularly\r\nconstituted. The solution of the difficulty is not easy to see. The\r\nKing, who is at bottom kindly disposed towards the King of Denmark and\r\nis afraid of Russia,[187] continues to oppose the occupation of\r\nJutland.\r\n\r\n  [186] General von Pritwitz had taken command of the federal army\r\n  in Schleswig-Holstein, after the appointment of General Wrangel\r\n  as Commander of the Berlin troops.\r\n\r\n  [187] Nicholas I. had threatened to declare war upon the Germanic\r\n  Confederation if the German troops did not evacuate the duchies\r\n  and retire beyond the Elbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 30, 1849._--The state of Germany does not improve. The\r\nKing of Würtemberg has now yielded because his troops declared that\r\nthey would not fire upon the people.[188] The Frankfort parliament is\r\nalso adopting the most revolutionary means to force the sovereigns to\r\nsubmit to its laws.[189] The parliament insists that governments shall\r\nnot dissolve their Chambers without the permission of the so-called\r\ncentral government. This wonderful decree reached Hanover and Berlin\r\nsix hours after the dissolutions had been officially announced.\r\nGeneral von Pritwitz wishes to be relieved of his command against the\r\nDanes because he is unwilling to obey orders from Frankfort and cannot\r\ncommand all the little German princes who severally wish to pose as\r\nmasters. Denmark has already captured a large number of Prussian\r\nmerchant-ships. At Copenhagen, however, there is a desire for peace;\r\nRussia and England are also anxious for peace and so is Prussia,\r\nthough Berlin cannot find courage to recall the twenty thousand men\r\nnow stationed in Holstein and Schleswig. Frankfort is utterly opposed\r\nto peace, with the object of depriving the German princes of their\r\ntroops and thus leaving them defenceless against the hordes of\r\nrevolutionaries. In short, confusion is at its height and I think the\r\nstate of Germany is far worse than it was four months ago. However,\r\nthe dissolution of the Prussian Chamber which had become urgent since\r\nthe Red Republic was proclaimed from the Tribune, will perhaps do some\r\ngood.[190] It is especially necessary that the Austrian operations in\r\nHungary should come to an end. Our fate will be decided there. Russia\r\nhas entered Transylvania with a hundred thousand men: this number is\r\nregarded at Olmütz as unnecessarily large, but the Emperor Nicholas\r\nhas declared that he will run no risks of a second failure such as\r\nthat of Hermannstadt,[191] and that he will either hold aloof\r\naltogether or insist upon sending an imposing force. He also feels\r\nthat he is fighting his personal enemies, the Poles, upon Hungarian\r\nsoil. Twenty thousand Poles are said to follow the standards of Bem\r\nand Kossuth.\r\n\r\n  [188] Yielding to public opinion and to avoid a catastrophe, the\r\n  King of Würtemberg eventually adopted the Constitution voted by\r\n  the Frankfort Assembly, including the article dealing with the\r\n  head of the Empire, which he had previously persisted in\r\n  rejecting.\r\n\r\n  [189] In the session of April 26 the Frankfort Assembly had\r\n  declared that the King of Prussia could not accept the proposed\r\n  position as head of the Empire if he did not also accept the\r\n  Constitution.\r\n\r\n  [190] On April 26 great agitation was produced in the Prussian\r\n  Chamber among the Left by a letter found under the seats of the\r\n  deputies. In this letter a large number of signatures from the\r\n  Red faction proclaimed the sovereignty of the people and\r\n  announced that all their efforts were being aimed at the\r\n  formation of a great Polish republic. The same evening the King's\r\n  ordinance dissolving the Chamber appeared.\r\n\r\n  [191] General Bem, of Polish origin, who had distinguished\r\n  himself in the defence of Warsaw in 1831, joined the Hungarians\r\n  who revolted against Austria in 1848 and won some great successes\r\n  in Transylvania, especially at Hermannstadt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 10, 1849._--Storms are breaking in every direction and\r\nGermany is in a state of conflagration. There has been fighting at\r\nDresden and at Breslau.[192] The Russians have used the Prussian\r\nrailways to invade Moravia; they have been warmly welcomed, for\r\nanything which will check the Hungarian struggle or bring it to an end\r\nwill be a blessing not only for Austria, but for the whole of Europe,\r\nfor the proceedings in Hungary encourage the disaffected, and foment\r\ninsurrection in every direction.\r\n\r\n  [192] On May 3 the King of Saxony absolutely refused to recognise\r\n  the constitution of the empire. His palace was immediately\r\n  surrounded by the crowd, a defence committee was formed and the\r\n  arsenal was attacked. The people seized the town hall and hoisted\r\n  the German Tricolour. The Royal Family and the Ministers fled to\r\n  Königstein. Had it not been for the Prussian intervention and the\r\n  arrival of General Wrangel, the republic would have been\r\n  proclaimed. The contagion of this revolt spread to Breslau,\r\n  where, on May 7, the bands of insurgents paraded the streets with\r\n  the red flag, which they brought before the town hall and\r\n  proclaimed the republic. The military authorities stormed the\r\n  barricades after a vigorous fusillade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 17, 1849._--To-day is a solemn date which I keep whenever\r\nit comes round with heartfelt and painful emotion.[193] The nearer the\r\nyears bring me to a final reunion, the more do I feel the serious and\r\ndecisive nature of the event that happened eleven years ago. May God\r\nbless each of those who bore themselves as Christians should on that\r\noccasion. This I ask of Him amid my misery with a fervour which will,\r\nI trust, make my poor prayers acceptable.\r\n\r\n  [193] The anniversary of the death of M. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 25, 1849._--It is a real misfortune for the Prussian\r\nGovernment to have Bunsen at London. He is there playing an\r\ninconceivable part. Radowitz, whose intentions are excellent, but who\r\nis quite misled, is also complicating the situation at Berlin itself\r\nand is preventing the desirable and speedy solutions of certain\r\nquestions. The King of Prussia has sent General von Rauch to Warsaw,\r\nto try and sooth the Emperor Nicholas, who is angry that the Prussians\r\nshould have entered Jutland in spite of the promise given.[194]\r\n\r\n  [194] The German troops had entered Jutland after a battle\r\n  between Wisdrup and Gudsor. The Danes, however, retired behind\r\n  the ramparts of Fredericia which was bombarded by the Prussian\r\n  troops, while negotiations for peace between Denmark and Prussia\r\n  were proceeding at London under the auspices of Lord Palmerston.\r\n  Some days later a Russian fleet left Cronstadt to help Denmark\r\n  against Prussia, for the Emperor Nicholas maintained that Prussia\r\n  was fomenting among her neighbours a spirit of revolt against the\r\n  legitimate sovereign, and was doing all that she could to make\r\n  herself mistress of the movements of Germany. The note which\r\n  General von Rauch brought pointed out to the Czar that Prussia\r\n  was only making war against Denmark at the orders of the central\r\n  power and that no one was more anxious to see the end of these\r\n  complications than the Prussian Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 31, 1849._--With regard to the negotiations opened at\r\nBerlin, I have the following upon excellent authority:[195] Four days\r\nago a protocol was signed at Berlin between Prussia, Saxony and\r\nHanover stating: (1) Everything that has been done to grant a\r\nreasonable and satisfactory Constitution to Germany; (2) That Hanover\r\nand Saxony in their desire to maintain order in their states,\r\nrecognise and accept the military superiority of Prussia in the case\r\nof any measures that may become necessary to maintain peace within\r\ntheir states. Herr von Beust none the less makes the following\r\nreservations in the name of the Saxon Government: (1) That Saxony does\r\nnot claim by this arrangement to infringe the rights of Austria as a\r\nmember of the Germanic Confederation; (2) That if the great states in\r\nSouthern Germany decline to adhere to the Constitution appended to the\r\nprotocol, Saxony shall have the right to withdraw; (3) That this\r\nConstitution is to receive the sanction of the Saxon Chambers. Hanover\r\nhas handed in a note containing identically the same reservations. The\r\nnew Constitution has been explained in a circular note addressed by\r\nPrussia to all the German governments, inviting them to adhere. The\r\nBavarian Minister, Herr von Lerchenfeld, has also signed the protocol,\r\nbut only as a member of the conference and in the hope that his\r\nGovernment will find some means or other of adhering to the\r\narrangement. Herr von Prokesch has been present only at the first\r\nconference, as Radowitz then declared from the outset that he could\r\nnot treat with governments which would not recognise the general\r\nsuperiority of Prussia as a basis of negotiation. The haughty conduct\r\nof Radowitz is undoubtedly the cause of this deplorable want of\r\nunanimity among the crowned heads, at a time when indissoluble union\r\nis so necessary. With a little cleverness and without putting forward\r\nthe question of supremacy as preliminary, he might have done great\r\nservices to his King and to his country, for the other states would\r\nthen have unanimously requested Prussia to take the leading position,\r\nwhereas now they are inclined to regard these dictatorial claims as\r\nthe expression of views more ambitious than any that are really\r\nentertained. The result is jealousy and distrust which drown the voice\r\nof reason and blind men's eyes to the necessities of the times.\r\nNotwithstanding the presence of a new Danish envoy in Berlin, even an\r\narmistice seems very far distant. The last Danish concessions, though\r\nsupported by Lord Palmerston, were haughtily declined by Prussia,\r\nwhich is making impossible claims and asserts that these alone can\r\nsatisfy her honour.\r\n\r\n  [195] The Prussian Cabinet had invited the other German Cabinets\r\n  to a Congress at Berlin with the object of settling the\r\n  difficulties raised by the refusal of the Frankfort Assembly to\r\n  make any change in the constitution which it had voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 12, 1849._--Cholera has again broken out almost\r\neverywhere in this part of Germany; at Breslau, Berlin, and Halle the\r\ninhabitants have been decimated. In short, the state of the human race\r\nis most deplorable. My correspondents tell me that Lord Palmerston\r\ntold Bunsen that he was tired of the Prussian demands, which required\r\nincreasingly large concessions from Denmark, and that he proposed to\r\nabandon his position as mediator and become an active ally in\r\nconjunction with Russia for the protection of Denmark. Bunsen in\r\nrelating this conversation to his Court added that the threat was not\r\nseriously intended. In this he is wrong, and is also deluding his\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, July 9, 1849._--I have had a visit from Baron von Meyendorff,\r\nRussian Minister at Berlin. He was going to Gastein by way of Warsaw,\r\nwhich is not the shortest route. His forecast of the situation was\r\nvery gloomy, and more gloomy with reference to the north than to the\r\nsouth of Germany--I mean to say that he felt more forebodings\r\nconcerning the nature of the Prussian destinies than of the Austrian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, September 3, 1849._--General Count Haugwitz has been staying\r\nhere for a few days; he came from Vienna where Radetzky was expected.\r\nThe young Emperor, in order to receive the old Ajax, had delayed his\r\ndeparture for Warsaw, where he is going to thank his powerful ally.\r\nThe latter is behaving most loyally and nobly towards his young friend\r\nand ward, for thus he considers the Emperor Francis Joseph. Paskewitch\r\nasked for mercy for Georgei which was immediately granted to\r\nhim.[196] Austria is anxious that a few Russian regiments should\r\nprolong their stay in Galicia for the moment.\r\n\r\n  [196] Georgei had capitulated with twenty-two thousand combatants\r\n  at Vilagos, where he handed his sword to the Russians. He was\r\n  given up to the Austrians after a short confinement, at the\r\n  request of Paskewitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hanover, November 5, 1849._--Yesterday morning was spent in calling\r\nupon several acquaintances in the town and paying my respects to the\r\nCrown Princess. She is kind and gentle, and I saw her two children\r\nwith her. The third is expected this month. The Crown Princess showed\r\nme several very interesting portraits of her family. I was especially\r\nstruck by those of the Electress Sophie, the patroness of Leibnitz and\r\nthe ancestress of the Royal Family of England. She must have been very\r\npretty, with the somewhat long and noble features of the Stuarts. I\r\nalso saw a charming portrait of the sister of the Crown Princess, the\r\nGrand Duchess of Russia, wife of the Grand Duke Constantine, a clever,\r\nlively and striking face; her character is said to correspond with her\r\nexpression, which fact makes her more suitable for the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg than she would be here, where her elder sister seem to have\r\nbeen expressly made to fulfil her sad duties.[197] There was a great\r\ndinner given by the King. I sat between him and the Crown Prince. I\r\nnever saw a blind man eat more cleverly without any help except that\r\nof instinct or habit. At nine o'clock I went back to tea with the\r\nKing, which was taken privately with him and the person known here as\r\nthe Countess Royal (Frau von Grote), my brother-in-law and General\r\nWalmoden. The King lives upon oysters and ices, a strange dietary,\r\nwhich seems to suit his eighty years marvellously. While we were with\r\nhim a despatch arrived from Vienna, which he asked the Countess to\r\nread aloud.[198] It stated that Austria had sent a note to Prussia in\r\nmost serious language, protesting against the convocation of the\r\nso-called Imperial Diet, and that at the same time the movement of the\r\narmy towards the frontiers of Bohemia and Silesia was rapidly\r\nproceeding; some sixty thousand men were said to be there\r\nconcentrated. Prince Schwarzenberg replied to the questions of Count\r\nBernstorff, the Prussian Minister at Vienna, stating that the\r\nconvocation of the Diet at Erfurt had aroused democratic agitation\r\nwhich threatened the realm of the Duchess of Saxony, and that these\r\ntroops were consequently intended for their protection and their\r\ndefence in case of necessity.\r\n\r\n  [197] An allusion to the blindness of the Crown Prince of\r\n  Hanover.\r\n\r\n  [198] The Vienna Cabinet, which was invariably jealous of\r\n  Prussia's position in Germany, strove by every means to destroy\r\n  Prussian influence. The Vienna Cabinet worked upon Hanover to\r\n  withdraw that State from alliance with the King of Prussia, and\r\n  pointed out that a federal State when confined by the terms of\r\n  federation, was likely to advance the cause of democracy, and\r\n  that Prussia by transforming the provisional central power into a\r\n  permanent institution, would become supreme in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke John had looked forward to a quiet unostentatious meeting\r\nwith King Leopold;[199] instead of this he was received with great\r\nsolemnity. Frau von Brandhofen and the little Count of Meran had no\r\npart in the ceremonies, and were sent to make a railway tour in\r\nBelgium incognito. When they reached Brussels they made an unexpected\r\nentry into Metternich's drawing-room, which was the more remarkable,\r\nas the relations between Prince Metternich and the Archduke John had\r\nalways been cold and strained. The politeness of Metternich simplified\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n  [199] The Archduke John, who possessed large properties in Styria\r\n  which he wished to develop, had come to Belgium to examine the\r\n  iron and steel factories. On October 24 the King of the Belgians\r\n  met him at Liège, and visited with him Seraing and the\r\n  establishments of the Vieille Montagne at Angleux. The Archduke\r\n  had contracted a morganatic marriage with Mlle. Plochel who was\r\n  made Baroness of Brandhofen; their only son had received the\r\n  title of Count of Meran.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eisenach, November 7, 1849._--I left Hanover yesterday morning and\r\narrived here in the afternoon. I sent word of my arrival immediately\r\nto Madame Alfred de Chabannes, who at once came to my hotel. We talked\r\nfor a long time about the little _émigré_ Court, of which she at\r\npresent forms part; I use the term _émigré_, although the Duchesse de\r\nOrléans is doing her utmost to avoid obtruding the anomalous nature of\r\nher position. At the same time inconsistencies cannot be entirely\r\nobviated, and arise from the nature of the situation: for instance,\r\nthe opposing parties are represented among those about her; there is a\r\ncoalition and a separatist party. She declines to belong definitely\r\nto either, and does not like people to say that she is opposing\r\ncoalition though she will not take the first steps towards it. At the\r\nsame time she has not allowed any one to declare hitherto that she\r\nwould not be opposed to it. She fears that the first step to coalition\r\nwould disgust her adherents in France, whom she thinks, in my opinion,\r\nto be more numerous than they really are, and this though she sees\r\nthat her truly reliable adherents are growing less every day. The\r\nnames which seem to cause her the most despondency from this point of\r\nview are those of Molé and Thiers. I saw the Duchesse d'Orléans alone\r\nfor half an hour before dinner; we were interrupted by the Duc and\r\nDuchesse de Nemours. I found the Duchesse d'Orléans in no way\r\noutwardly changed, except that her features may have lost something of\r\ntheir refinement; her spirits were more despondent, though she showed\r\nthe same placidity and even dignity, but her energy has decreased and\r\nshe is inclined to feel herself overwhelmed by unpleasant incidents,\r\nwhich are due to people rather than to things. She is humiliated by\r\nthe degradation which has overtaken France, and shows much insight\r\ninto the state of Germany, characterising the so-called central power\r\nand the parody of imperialism at its true worth. The Nemours, who are\r\nstrong supporters of Austria, refer to Lord Palmerston with much\r\nbitterness. They are really coalitionists, and are on their way back\r\nto Claremont from Vienna; she is fresh and pretty, and ventures to\r\nassert her opinions, which are positive; he has grown stouter and much\r\nmore like the King, especially in his way of speaking, as he has at\r\nlast found the courage to express himself; he speaks sensibly, but\r\nwith no style or distinction, and in this respect he was always\r\nwanting. The letters of his brothers which have been published are not\r\napproved by him in any way. He fears that the law may be adopted which\r\nmay recall his family to France, and he does not wish to see his\r\nbrothers hastening back again.[200] This is all very well, but I\r\nrepeat he is wanting in the spirit of energy. He will never be of any\r\naccount, and will never take any practical part, and remains a\r\ndistinguished nonentity. The Comte de Paris is much grown and fairly\r\ngood-looking, as his shyness had disappeared, but he has a squeaky,\r\ndisagreeable intonation of voice. The Duc de Chartres has become much\r\nstronger and very noisy. The three Nemours children seem quite nice.\r\nAfter dinner, which began about seven o'clock, we stayed talking until\r\nnearly eleven o'clock. Boismilon is a strong separatist; Ary Scheffer\r\nwas also there, and seems to me to be one of the zealot party, an\r\nattitude which M. de Talleyrand used to distrust.\r\n\r\n  [200] On October 24 M. Creton had proposed to the National\r\n  Assembly the abrogation of the laws proscribing the Bourbons.\r\n  This question aroused a keen debate. Prince Jérôme Napoléon\r\n  quoted the letters written in 1848 by the sons of Louis Philippe\r\n  protesting against their banishment and asking permission to\r\n  return to their native land on recognising the sovereignty of the\r\n  people. M. Creton's proposal was rejected by 587 votes.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Joinville has been confined of a still-born child and\r\nwas in considerable danger. The child's body was taken to Dreux by my\r\ncousin, Alfred de Chabannes, who gave no notice of his intention. It\r\nwas laid in the family vault, mass was said, and only when all this\r\nhad been done did M. de Chabannes inform the Mayor of his actions. The\r\nceremony was very properly conducted. Madame de Chabannes also told me\r\nthat when her husband went to visit Louis Philippe at Claremont for\r\nthe first time after February, the King said, almost as soon as he saw\r\nhim, \"What would you expect; I thought myself infallible.\" The\r\nobservation seemed to me strikingly true and to be a remarkable\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Orléans proposes to return to London in the spring to\r\ntake the Comte de Paris to his first communion, for which he is being\r\nprepared by the Abbé Guelle, who frequently instructs him at Eisenach.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, November 8, 1849._--On my return here I found my\r\nbrother-in-law, who had come back from Dresden, where the state of\r\npublic feeling is said to be going from bad to worse. The Ministers\r\nhave been unable to obtain from the King of Saxony any decree for the\r\ncapital punishment even of the most guilty, much to the indignation\r\nof right-minded people and to the exasperation of the troops who\r\nfought so admirably last May. The arrogance of the rebels has greatly\r\nincreased in consequence. The King's prestige has sunk so low that his\r\nsalutations are not even returned in the streets.\r\n\r\nYesterday was the anniversary of the installation of the Brandenburg\r\nMinistry, and there was a great entertainment in the rooms of Kroll in\r\nthe Tiergarten: all the Ministers were present, and a feeling of great\r\nloyalty is said to have been manifested. However, in another part of\r\nthe town a so-called religious celebration was in progress of another\r\nanniversary, the shooting of the famous Robert Blum.[201] There was\r\nthus entertainment to suit every taste, and I fear that the taste for\r\nred ruin is by no means blunted.\r\n\r\n  [201] Robert Blum assumed the leadership of the Saxon democracy\r\n  in 1848. He was sent to the Frankfort Assembly and showed some\r\n  oratorical talent, but in taking part in the Vienna revolt, he\r\n  was captured and shot by the Austrians.\r\n\r\nA letter from Paris which I find here tells me that the situation in\r\nFrance is entirely in the hands of the army which is divided between\r\nCavaignac and Changarnier. The former is entirely republican and the\r\nlatter will listen to nobody. Since Louise Philippe wrote his letter\r\nto Edgar Ney[202] at Rome Changarnier is said to have appeared less\r\nfrequently at the Elysée. The President is therefore inclined to\r\ntransfer the command of the Paris troops to General Magnan.\r\n\r\n  [202] The following is the well-known letter to Edgar Ney, which\r\n  France interpreted as a future programme:\r\n\r\n    _Paris, August 18, 1849._\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR NEY,--The French Republic has not sent an army to Rome to\r\n  crush Italian liberty, but on the contrary to regularise it by\r\n  saving it from its own excesses and to give it a solid basis by\r\n  placing on the pontifical throne the Prince, who was the first to\r\n  take the lead courageously in all useful reforms.\r\n\r\n  \"I am sorry to learn that the well-meant actions of His Holiness,\r\n  as well as our measures, have been nullified by passions and\r\n  hostile influences which wish to base the Pope's return upon\r\n  proscription and tyranny. Kindly tell the General from me that he\r\n  should in no case allow any act to be committed under the\r\n  tricolour flag which could give a wrong meaning to our\r\n  intervention. I interpret the temporal power of the Pope\r\n  as follows: a general amnesty, the secularisation of the\r\n  administration, the Napoleonic code and a Liberal government.\r\n\r\n  \"My feelings were wounded when I read the proclamation of the\r\n  three cardinals in which no mention was made of France or of the\r\n  sufferings of her brave soldiers. Any insult to our flag or to our\r\n  Union cuts me to the heart. Advise the General to make the fact\r\n  clear that, though France does not sell her services, she demands\r\n  some sense of gratitude for her sacrifices and her intervention.\r\n\r\n  \"When our armies traversed the whole of Europe, their passage was\r\n  everywhere marked by the destruction of feudal abuse and the\r\n  sowing of the seeds of liberty. It shall not be said that in 1849\r\n  a French army could act with any other object or produce any other\r\n  result.\r\n\r\n  \"Ask the General to thank the army for its noble conduct in my\r\n  name. I am sorry to learn that as regards the necessaries of life,\r\n  it did not receive the treatment it deserved. I hope that he will\r\n  be able to bring this state of affairs to an end forthwith. No\r\n  pain should be spared to secure the comfort of our troops.\r\n\r\n    \"Believe me, my dear Ney,\r\n    Faithfully yours,\r\n    LOUIS NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\"\r\n\r\n  We reproduce this letter from the text given by the _Journal des\r\n  Débats_ of September 7, 1849. M. Edgar Ney was orderly officer to\r\n  the Prince President who had sent him on a mission to the Papal\r\n  Government. Marshal Bugeaud was then in command of the French\r\n  troops at Rome, but as he was suddenly carried off by cholera, his\r\n  place was taken by General Oudinot who conducted all the military\r\n  operations.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven is delighted to return to Paris, and paints England\r\nin the blackest possible colours. She wears a bonnet in the style of\r\nDeffand, praises the president of the republic, and does her best as\r\nformerly to attract every shade of political colour to her house. She\r\nseems to have succeeded so far as to be frankly astonished that no one\r\nmakes any mention of M. Guizot, whom she is expecting in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, November 12, 1849._--I spent almost the whole of yesterday at\r\nSans Souci with the King and Queen, who received me as kindly as ever.\r\nPrince Frederick of the Low Countries, who arrived from the Hague,\r\ngave a very bad account of the situation in that direction.\r\nResignation, abdication, and regency are words openly pronounced. The\r\nyoung King is despised, and the young Queen is not popular or the\r\nDowager Queen either. In short, their position is quite precarious.\r\nThe King of Prussia is expecting the proclamation of the Empire at the\r\nElysée and all eyes are turned upon France.\r\n\r\nA letter from Vienna which I received yesterday, tells me that beneath\r\nall the military display, some new causes of anxiety are obvious. The\r\npeasants are very displeased with the new system of land taxation, by\r\ntheir obligation to redeem the tithes and to pay indemnities by way of\r\ncompensation for all that they expected to wrest from their overlords.\r\nThe nobility consider the equality of taxation to which they are\r\nsubjected is a hardship and a hateful innovation. The hodweds[203] who\r\nhave been drafted into the regiments, are disseminating very bad\r\nideas. The young emperor is rather short and arbitrary with his old\r\ngenerals; in a word, if our neighbours have not to confront the same\r\ndifficulties that prevail here, they have many reasons for\r\ndisquietude.\r\n\r\n  [203] The reserve militia of Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 21, 1849._--A letter from Paris dated the 14th says:\r\n\"An amnesty has been proclaimed by the President to seven hundred and\r\nfifty very undesirable people: this bid for popularity may cost the\r\nauthor of it dear, for these people will return in a state of\r\nexasperation and will have to be made targets of some day or\r\nother.[204] Underneath all the leanings to imperialism, which seem to\r\nbe spreading, there is one question which is very undecided, at any\r\nrate where I am concerned: this is the future action of General\r\nChangarnier,[205] for though he is on excellent terms at present with\r\nthe president, I doubt if he will adhere to him in a time of\r\ntransition, and such a time would then become an inevitable crisis.\"\r\n\r\n  [204] On November 12, M. Barrot, Minister of the Interior,\r\n  announced to the National Assembly at Paris that the President,\r\n  in virtue of the rights conferred upon him by the decree of June\r\n  18, 1848, had ordered the liberation of the majority of the\r\n  insurgents detained at Belle-Isle.\r\n\r\n  [205] General Changarnier was then in command of the troops at\r\n  Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 2, 1849._--The tall Theresa Elssler, who for several\r\nyears has been the mistress of Prince Adalbert of Prussia, is to\r\nbecome his wife under the title of Frau von Fischbach, a title derived\r\nfrom the estate which the old Prince William holds in the Silesian\r\nmountains. There the late Princess William was laid in the odour of\r\nsanctity, and it is somewhat shocking that this name of all others\r\nshould be conferred upon a quondam theatre dancer.[206] At Sans Souci\r\nthis marriage has caused considerable displeasure, but with the\r\nhabitual weakness which is there characteristic, consent has been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n  [206] The King of Prussia refused to give T. Elssler the name of\r\n  Fischbach, but gave her the title of Baroness of Barnim.\r\n\r\nAnother scandal is about to appear at Berlin of more import. This is\r\nthe probable acquittal of Waldeck whose trial has been attracting the\r\ngeneral attention for a long time.[207] They have been so entirely\r\nfoolish as to choose as President of the assizes a weak-minded\r\nmagistrate, the father of a barricade hero, who shows the most\r\nbrazen-faced and clumsy partiality for Waldeck. The jury are\r\nconstantly receiving anonymous letters, and their verdict will be\r\ngiven under stress of intimidation. It is deplorable, for the\r\nconsequences might be very serious.\r\n\r\n  [207] Waldeck was arrested and imprisoned in May as an accomplice\r\n  in the great revolutionary conspiracy. After a long trial he was\r\n  acquitted on December 5 by a court which was not regarded at\r\n  Berlin as entirely impartial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 6, 1849._--The ovation given to the ruffian Waldeck\r\nafter his acquittal seems to have been scandalous enough to\r\nnecessitate military interference. I have no details as yet, but the\r\npost will doubtless bring them to-day. I am of the opinion that we are\r\nabout to enter a period of outbreaks, and this opinion is strengthened\r\nby the fact that the Poles are beginning their processions again, and\r\nwhenever they appear, one may be sure that there is a snake in the\r\ngrass, to use a vulgar expression.\r\n\r\nI have just finished reading the life of Madame de Krüdener. She was\r\nquite a peculiar character, but the story of her life is somewhat\r\ntiresome and my own conclusion is that Madame de Krüdener, who was\r\nalways deluded by her own vanity, was frivolous for that reason during\r\nher youth; that vanity afterwards led her to literature and finally to\r\nmissionary work; but vanity has an honesty of its own, and precisely\r\nfor that reason can display prodigious credulity. As a mystic Madame\r\nde Krüdener has not the loftiness of Saint Theresa or the quiet grace\r\nof Madame Guyon; her would-be clever letters are heavy, and when she\r\ntries to soar aloft the leaden structure of her wings is obvious.\r\nThere must have been some force of attraction in her speeches and\r\naddresses, for without some special gift she could never have\r\nproduced results which contain a certain amount of humbug and on many\r\noccasions some reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 10, 1849._--I was very sorry to read the day before\r\nyesterday in the newspapers the announcement of the death of Queen\r\nAdelaide of England. The news carried me back to that pleasant time\r\nwhen I had the honour of seeing her, and was treated by her with a\r\nkindness which I shall never forget. She was a noble woman who bore\r\nherself with grand and simple dignity in positions that were difficult\r\nfor several reasons.\r\n\r\nThere is some small excitement at Sans Souci, on account of the\r\nconcentration of the Austrian forces upon the Saxon frontier. It would\r\nseem that General Gerlach, who at this moment has considerable\r\ninfluence with the King of Prussia, has been sent to Dresden to bring\r\nmatters to a conclusion. If these troops are only intended to clear\r\nSaxony of the Reds in case of necessity, who are more audacious there\r\nthan anywhere else, this intervention would be regarded as equivalent\r\nto Russia's action in the Grand Duchy of Baden, and nothing would be\r\nsaid; but certain would-be clever people wish to regard the movement\r\nas a veiled threat against the Diet of Erfurt.[208] In this case it is\r\nprobable that it will not pass without comment.\r\n\r\n  [208] Driven from Frankfort, the remnants of the National\r\n  Assembly collected at Stuttgart, and the Revolutionary party,\r\n  giving the signal for open insurrection in Germany, took up arms\r\n  in Saxony, in the Rhine Palatinate, and in the Duchy of Baden,\r\n  overthrowing governments and securing victory everywhere until\r\n  the Prussian troops established order. Saxony and Hanover then\r\n  agreed with Prussia upon a new Constitution, and concluded the\r\n  so-called alliance of the Three Kings; but Austria, who desired\r\n  to become predominant in Germany, opposed the Prussian views and\r\n  induced Saxony and Hungary to withdraw. Frederick William IV.\r\n  then organised the Union with the remainder of his adherents and\r\n  opened the Diet of Erfurt where the new Constitution was\r\n  accepted. Then Austria, to prevent the recurrence of any similar\r\n  project, induced the German States to re-establish the old\r\n  Germanic Confederation, and this plan was executed in spite of\r\n  Prussian opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 12, 1849._--I have read the speech delivered at the\r\nadmission of the Duc de Noailles to the French Academy.[209] It is\r\nwritten in very fine language with real loftiness of style and\r\nthought, and is marked by a correctness and purity worthy of the best\r\nepochs of taste and literature: the ideas are noble and both prudent\r\nand dignified; some passages especially please me, notably those\r\nconcerning Pascal and Voltaire, with a clever transition, bringing the\r\nsubject back to M. de Chateaubriand. However, the speech has one\r\ndefect in my opinion, that it places its subject upon too high a\r\npedestal, and that if it does not exaggerate his talent it certainly\r\ngives too high an estimate of his character. The Duc de Noailles\r\nwith very correct taste touched but lightly on the _Mémoires\r\nd'outre-tombe_, for this gloomy legacy reveals the writer's barrenness\r\nof heart, excessive vanity and acrimonious character, while his talent\r\noften disappears beneath the exaggerations and bad taste for which\r\nclumsy imitators of this school are often blamed. However, all\r\neulogies before the Academy are prone to exaggerate the merits of\r\ntheir subjects; as they are condemned to draw a portrait without\r\nshadows, the truth of their colouring suffers in consequence, and the\r\nreal features are often obscured. These faults are due rather to the\r\naccepted style of oration than to the orator, and for them he cannot\r\nbe blamed. Yesterday I began the sixth volume of the _Mémoires\r\nd'outre-tombe_. This contains a sketch of Napoleon's history with\r\nwhich M. de Chateaubriand padded his own _Mémoires_ in reference to\r\nhimself; the whole is written with a view to effect, but with no great\r\nfeeling for truth. I was greatly struck to find a passing eulogy upon\r\nM. Caulaincourt in spite of the Duc d'Enghien; in other respects the\r\nsame malevolence towards the human race is obvious, and the same\r\nhatred for M. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n  [209] The Duc de Noailles had been elected to the Academy in the\r\n  place of Chateaubriand. He, with M. de Broglie and M. Pasquier,\r\n  there formed a small clique, known as the dukes' party.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 14, 1849._--I hear from Paris that Madame de Lieven\r\nsometimes lays aside her Deffant bonnet in favour of a toque of black\r\nvelvet with white feathers, which is the last word of fashion. She\r\ngoes into society and is seen everywhere; she has even procured an\r\nintroduction to Madame de Circourt where the ultra-Catholic society\r\nmeets; she is trying to find recruits there for her salon, and is\r\nespecially anxious to attract M. de Montalembert.\r\n\r\nTo judge by an article in the _Friend of Religion_, our dear Bishop of\r\nOrléans[210] has gained another triumph at Notre Dame, a triumph for\r\nthe faith by which he is inspired and for the friendship of which he\r\nis the object. I expect a hymn of praise from my good Pauline on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n  [210] The Abbé Dupanloup had recently been appointed Bishop of\r\n  Orléans under the Ministry of Falloux, then Minister of Worship\r\n  and Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 16, 1849._--A letter from Berlin of yesterday's date\r\nsays: \"The German question is more confused than ever, and no one can\r\nforesee the issue. The only decided point seems to be that of the\r\nelections for Erfurt, in spite of Austria, whose language, though\r\nmoderate, none the less shows a strong determination not to give way.\r\nFrom this you may deduce the probable consequences, none of which I\r\nshould care to guarantee.\"\r\n\r\nMy perusal of the sixth volume of the _Mémoires d'outre-tombe_ brings\r\non a succession of nervous shocks. M. de Talleyrand appears at every\r\nmoment, and is treated with a fury which of itself counterbalances the\r\nauthor's malicious tendencies, though of these a good proportion\r\nsurvive; in any case in which M. de Talleyrand really acted, the\r\nauthor is silent: where his influence was small, he attacks him with\r\nfurious invective, and all this because he is trying to prove that his\r\npamphlet, _Bonaparte and the Bourbons_, brought about the restoration\r\nof 1814. For instance, when he is driven into a corner a cry of grief\r\nescapes him, and he says: \"My poor pamphlet was crushed by the foul\r\nintrigues of the Rue de Florentin.\" In this outcry we see the true\r\nexplanation of his furious rage. Vanity of vanities! I trust for the\r\nsake of this hero of vanity that he seriously asked pardon from God\r\nbefore he was taken to the rock of St. Malo, which his vanity again\r\nhas chosen as his last resting-place. As he could not choose his\r\ncradle, for which he would doubtless have selected an eagle's nest, he\r\nhas been careful to ensure that his tomb should be a picturesque point\r\nof pilgrimage. But who will say that while tied to this rock he is not\r\ndevoured by the vulture of conscience? I would not deny that my poor\r\nuncle has been a great sinner, but I would prefer to stand with his\r\nfeeble conscience before the Throne than with this mind full of anger,\r\nmalice, gall and enmity, the revelation of which now permits us all to\r\njudge and to condemn him.\r\n\r\nSalvandy has paid a visit to Claremont, and reports that some words of\r\nwisdom were spoken. Apparently the inhabitants have learned by\r\nexperience and now recognise the value of right. Young and old say\r\nthat they are ready to lower their flag to this principle, and to\r\nserve it. I fear that those at Eisenach are by no means so advanced as\r\nyet, for I have had a letter from Madame de Chabannes; on leaving\r\nEisenach she went through Brussels and spent two days there to see the\r\nQueen. When at length she returned to Versailles, she found her\r\nhusband was also returning from Claremont. She writes to me as\r\nfollows: \"To my great regret I found the Queen of the Belgians\r\nextremely anxious for coalition. England wishes to maintain the\r\n_status quo_ in France in order that this poor country may plunge\r\ndeeper in the mire. Hence Lord Palmerston is intriguing in every\r\npossible way to avoid the possibility of regeneration. King Leopold\r\nsimply echoes Downing Street[211] upon French but not upon German\r\nquestions, and Queen Louise is of her husband's opinion. A snare has\r\nbeen spread for the Duchesse d'Orléans by inviting her to consider a\r\nnew combination--a proposal to induce the Duc de Bordeaux to abdicate,\r\nto which he will certainly never consent. In this you may recognise\r\nthe punic faith of the modern Carthage. My husband has been\r\ncommissioned by Claremont to give the password to our leaders here,\r\nand I know that the Legitimists have been informed of Louis Philippe's\r\nconciliatory attitude; but parties are broken in the numberless\r\nfactions. The Legitimists are no longer drilled as they were, and some\r\nwould prefer the Comte de Montemolin to the Comte de Paris. I often\r\nthink of your prophetic words at Eisenach, to the effect that this\r\ndesirable coalition, which might have produced such great results six\r\nmonths ago, has now missed its opportunity, and that every day's delay\r\ndiminishes its possible importance and utility. But how is one to\r\ndestroy such inveterate prejudices, in which self-esteem is so\r\npowerful a factor and petty subordinate ambition so energetic?\"\r\n\r\n  [211] Lord Palmerston's residence in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter which I have written to the\r\nDuc de Noailles to thank him for his speech before the Academy: \"My\r\ndear Duc, you have gained a brilliant success before a great and\r\nsensitive audience. I propose to offer you one less brilliant and more\r\nremarkable from the depths of my solitude. I was busy reading\r\n_d'Outre-tombe_ when the _Journal des Débats_ brought me a report of\r\nyour magnificent speech; I admired it, although it contains nothing\r\nbut praise of a man against whom my instinct has always revolted, and\r\nwho has become the object of my deep aversion on account of the\r\npersistent jealousy manifested in his acrimonious confessions. But as\r\nI read your speech I had only to consider yourself, and I understood\r\nthat you were not allowed to be a judge, but were forced to be a\r\neulogist. I can therefore honestly say that my applause is the\r\ngreatest triumph that your words can have gained, and perhaps also the\r\ngreatest proof of my friendship. I am also convinced that precisely\r\nbecause you were thinking of me, it must have been difficult for you\r\nto draw a portrait without shadow, and to deprive it of truth\r\nprecisely as you have added to its lustre. Disregarding the question\r\nof truth, I have been keenly delighted by the purity, simplicity, and\r\ntaste--unfortunately now so rare--of your language which has given me\r\ninfinite pleasure. The elevation of thought corresponds to the\r\ndelicacy of feeling; political prudence has nowhere infringed literary\r\ndignity, while supporting it with a tactfulness alike clever and\r\nfelicitous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 21, 1849._--A letter from Paris, which I received\r\nyesterday, contains the following passage: \"Political conditions are\r\ncalmer for the moment, but the majority of the Assembly are divided by\r\nseveral class divisions, and apparently the dangers of the street\r\nalone can force them to unite. This is no great guarantee of security,\r\nand gives a touch of bitterness and sadness to all conversations. The\r\nbest of friends entertain opposite ideas, and argue vehemently, so\r\nthat social relations become difficult and unpleasant. Madame de\r\nLieven alone seems perfectly contented, and quite delighted with her\r\nstay in Paris; she continues to make as many new acquaintances as she\r\ncan, and is especially attentive to people in power, and sorry that\r\nshe cannot go to the Elysée.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 26, 1849._--An incident which I regard as very\r\nvexatious has struck me--the discussion proceeding in the daily Press\r\nconcerning the advantages, the inconveniences, the forms and\r\nconditions of the coalition, so long desired by all the true friends\r\nof France. It seems to me that nothing could be more fatal to the\r\nchance of a successful issue than thus to bring discussion before a\r\npublic which is partial, prejudiced, ill-informed and often both\r\nmalicious and ignorant. I fear I was correct at Eisenach, when I said\r\nthat I feared it might be already too late to take a step which should\r\nhave been burst upon the public unexpectedly, and have made the\r\nimpression of an accomplished fact. Such a step would then have\r\nproduced its full effect--would have decided waverers, gathered\r\ntogether all right-minded people, united the recalcitrants, and apart\r\nfrom a few courageous spirits, a vast number of timid minds would have\r\nbeen soon gathering round this one standard. Now, if it should be\r\nunfurled, it will appear shattered and torn by the missiles of\r\njournalists and the invectives of the wretched subordinate intriguers\r\nwhom I was sorry to see about the Duchesse d'Orléans.\r\n\r\nApparently Vienna wishes to make some social effort to please the\r\nyoung Emperor. Last year the Emperor was greatly attracted at Olmütz\r\nby his cousin, the Archduchess Elizabeth, who has just lost her\r\nhusband: though the Emperor consoled himself, it is said that some\r\nsparks of his early ardour remain to him and that very possibly the\r\nyoung Archduchess, who can easily be consoled, might become Empress\r\nwhen her mourning is over. She is nineteen years of age, is pretty and\r\nhas one child.[212]\r\n\r\n  [212] The Archduchess Elizabeth had lost her husband, the\r\n  Archduke Ferdinand Charles Victor of Este, on December 15, 1849:\r\n  in 1854 she married the Archduke Charles Ferdinand. She was the\r\n  mother of Queen Marie Christina of Spain and the Archdukes\r\n  Frederick, Charles Stephen, and Eugène.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 30, 1849._--In France the conflict of opinion is\r\nobvious. One party are confident that they will secure the empire\r\nwithin a month; the other party are equally certain that the principle\r\nof legitimacy is immutable and universally recognised, so that their\r\ntriumph is assured; the merchants say that they would prefer the\r\nfamily of Orléans, while the Socialists mock at all these dreams and\r\nregard their own accession to power as certain. As the parties would\r\nonly unite in order to combat the Socialists, these last may very well\r\nfind a favourable opportunity eventually.\r\n\r\nIn two days we are to begin a new year and to begin also the second\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century. What a half-century this last has\r\nbeen, and what catastrophes have marked the conclusion of this epoch\r\nof disturbance and madness! During the first years of this\r\nhalf-century we were emerging from chaos, and in chaos the last years\r\nof it have plunged us. Heaven alone knows to what depths we shall\r\nfall. May we at least be able to die peacefully in our beds; desires\r\nand hopes can go no further than that wish, although to desire even so\r\nmuch may seem excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n1850\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 3, 1850._--The weakness of the Prussian Ministry is\r\ninconceivable and so is the utter confusion which the new laws,\r\nwhether proposed or granted, produce throughout the administration of\r\nthe country. It is a case of quoting:\r\n\r\n    Laws lost their forces and right and wrong their meaning,\r\n    Or, to speak truth, a Valois reigned no more.[213]\r\n\r\n  [213] From the \"Henriade,\" Canto I.\r\n\r\nThere is an ancient prophecy in Prussia dating from the reign of the\r\nfather of Frederick II. which says that his fourth successor will be\r\nthe last Hohenzollern to reign over Prussia. There seems to be really\r\nsome reason for believing this prediction. It is proposed to establish\r\nuniform laws from the banks of the Rhine to the Carpathians: this is\r\nsheer foolishness, as manners, civilisation, and interests are utterly\r\ndifferent. The Landwehr which is now very loyal will be retiring next\r\nyear and will be replaced by a new levy of very disaffected character;\r\nin short, wherever we look, nothing but decay is to be seen and\r\nuneasiness spreads apace. However, the Danish negotiations have been\r\nvigorously resumed at Berlin and are said to be safe in the hands of\r\nHerr Usedom.\r\n\r\nI hear of a curious fact from Paris; all the factories are in full\r\nswing, but business can only be done for ready money; bills at three\r\nmonths simply cannot be discounted; the bank has just as many coins\r\nand as much bullion in its cellars as it has notes in circulation.\r\nThis fact, perhaps unexampled hitherto, demonstrates mathematically\r\nthat there is not the smallest confidence in the near future and that\r\nthe people are living from hand to mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, January 9, 1850._--I hear from Paris that M. de Persigny has\r\narrived at Berlin,[214] with many proposals and with the fixed idea of\r\nforming a triple alliance between France, England, and Prussia. This\r\nidea, however, does not originate with him, but with that infernal\r\nPalmerston. Vienna was informed of the proposal at the outset and\r\nPrince Felix Schwarzenberg made it public through the newspapers, but\r\nin spite of this publicity it is said that the proposal has not been\r\nabandoned. Prussia will be offered Saxony and Thuringen and prospects\r\nwill be held out with regard to Hanover after the death, which is\r\nprobably not very remote, of King Ernest Augustus: in exchange Prussia\r\nwould be asked to cede the Rhine provinces; Prussia replies that\r\nFrance should be contented with the Bavarian parts of the Rhine which,\r\nin the views of the Elysée, are sufficient. Such is the point which\r\nthis intrigue has reached, for we cannot dignify it with the title of\r\na negotiation. M. de Persigny tells himself that if he is successful\r\nhe will make certain of the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs for\r\nhimself, to which he aspires, and also secure the empire for his\r\nmaster, who is equally ambitious in this direction. Another\r\ncorrespondent from Paris writes to me: \"Those who were liberated under\r\nthe amnesty and have been restored to their families by the President\r\nare doing more harm in one day than all the scoundrels of Paris in\r\nconcert. They are so full of gratitude that they threaten to kill the\r\nPresident. Many of these men are convinced that their wives brought\r\nabout their arrest and they are therefore searching for proof to rid\r\nthemselves of their better-halves.\"\r\n\r\n  [214] M. de Persigny, aide-de-camp to the Prince President and\r\n  elected representative to the Legislative Assembly in 1849, was\r\n  occupied at Berlin upon a temporary mission, with no great\r\n  success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 12, 1850._--A parliamentary crisis is now in full\r\nprogress here. The King has been unwilling to take without some\r\nreservation an oath which he desires to keep but which is repugnant\r\nto his political conscience.[215] The Ministry absolutely required a\r\nlaw from the Chambers concerning the Press and the clubs if it was to\r\ngovern, and therefore urged the King to take the oath to the\r\nConstitution, as otherwise he could expect nothing from the Chambers.\r\nSuch was the dilemma. Violent scenes took place between the King and\r\nhis Cabinet. The latter was determined to resign and to force the King\r\nto yield. When matters were in this situation two very influential\r\npersonages, General Rauch and Baron von Meyendorff,[216] intervened.\r\nThe Ministry was informed that its exploits hitherto had been so\r\nglorious that it could afford to act in a high-handed manner, and that\r\nto put pressure upon the King in order to endow the country with a\r\ndetestable Constitution, was unworthy of it. The Ministers were\r\ndirectly informed that their weakness had aroused general disgust,\r\nthat they had shown no comprehension of their duty and that when the\r\ndanger of riots was passed they had distinguished themselves only by\r\ntheir incapacity; they were obliged to hear some very stern truths. On\r\nthe other hand attempts were made to soothe the King's feelings by\r\nattributing a firmness to him which is thought to be due to the\r\nQueen's influence. The result of all these comings and goings is the\r\nroyal message which does not reform everything that is bad, but places\r\ncertain landmarks in the country by which people can guide their\r\nsteps. The Ministry has frankly adhered to the King, I am told, who\r\nhas now emerged from his period of obscurity. The next question is\r\nwhether the Chambers will accept the arrangement. It is thought that\r\nthey will agree, because the Cabinet asserts that it will resign upon\r\nrefusal, and the Chambers know that a purely reactionary Ministry\r\nwould take its place immediately. The Second Chamber, which is\r\nanxious to avoid a dissolution, is terrified by this combination, and\r\nit is hoped that it will yield before this menace which may become\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n  [215] A royal message, which had been expected for several days,\r\n  had been presented to the Prussian Chambers in the session of\r\n  January 9. The formation of a hereditary peerage was then\r\n  announced, while the introduction of financial measures was to be\r\n  the privilege of the Second Chamber, and the King was to take an\r\n  oath of fidelity to the Constitution. Numerous modifications were\r\n  introduced for the purpose of restriction, but the King did not\r\n  make his oath a condition _sine qua non_, but thought he was\r\n  fulfilling a conscientious duty in thus submitting his scruples\r\n  to the Chambers.\r\n\r\n  [216] Russian Minister at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 17, 1850._--Your observations concerning women who\r\ninterfere in politics and concerning the dangers which they may run in\r\nconsequence, are perfectly correct.[217] I think it may be said in\r\njustice to myself that at no time have I meddled with such matters and\r\nthat I have never taken part in politics except against my will. Far\r\nfrom attempting to satisfy my self-esteem by such means, I have always\r\nbeen terrified by my responsibility. If, in consequence of my\r\nexceptional position, I have been well informed and have even been\r\nasked for my advice and have exerted some influence upon the decision\r\nof important matters, I have at any rate not lent either my name or my\r\nenergies to an intrigue, nor do I ever desire to play the part of a\r\npolitical woman; in this respect I have always been ready to yield to\r\nothers who were more anxious and probably better fitted for such an\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n  [217] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\nHere public opinion is absorbed by the parliamentary crisis which has\r\nnot yet been settled, while much doubt and great difference of opinion\r\nprevails concerning the result and its consequences. The King has been\r\nso harassed and tormented that after a struggle of several hours the\r\nday before yesterday, he was quite exhausted, sent for his cloak at\r\nnine o'clock in the evening, and went for a walk in the park of\r\nCharlottenburg alone and on foot through the snow, to refresh himself\r\nand recover his spirits in the open air. He was inclined to dismiss\r\nthe Cabinet, dissolve the Chambers, and summon those who are here\r\ncalled the reactionaries. General Rauch prevented this move: no doubt\r\nhe was right, because energetic measures can only succeed in the hands\r\nof those who will shrink from none of the consequences of vigorous\r\naction.\r\n\r\nI spent an hour yesterday with the Countess of Brandenburg, where Herr\r\nvon Meyendorff showed us a letter which he had just received from\r\nMadame de Lieven. Her letters are always pleasant reading as she\r\nwrites with sprightliness, is quite natural, and always has plenty to\r\nsay. In this letter she said that Lord Normanby is undisputed monarch\r\nat the Elysée where he is doing his best to promote the imperial\r\nmovement; that the President has broken with the bigwigs and devotes\r\nhimself entirely to his evil counsellors; that the Assembly is more\r\ndivided than ever, for the leaders defy one another in no measured\r\nterms, Molé calling Broglie a respectable nonentity, Thiers calling\r\nMolé an old woman and the latter replying by \"cad.\" In short,\r\nconfusion in France is complete, but is it not so everywhere,\r\nunfortunately? In such general turmoil it is very difficult to\r\npreserve any clearness of view or definite opinions; when insight is\r\nclouded it becomes weakened and only the heart can remain a certain\r\nguide at a time when all calculations are deceptive and when instinct\r\nalone can provide the guiding clue through the labyrinth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 19, 1850._--The present moment here is an interesting\r\ntime by reason of its critical nature, and if I took the same interest\r\nin mundane affairs as I used to do, I should now be all ears.\r\nYesterday rumours of concession suddenly came to an end; a large\r\nnumber of Conservative deputies and important persons in the town\r\noutside the Chambers, signed a petition to the King begging him not to\r\nyield. Bethman-Holweg, who is not a deputy, took this petition to\r\nCharlottenburg yesterday evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 24, 1850._--Apparently Radowitz has arrived here and\r\nis less energetic in urging the King to concessions than had been\r\nfeared: he also seems to have brought many letters from Gagern to\r\ninfluential members of the Chambers, urging them to obey the King for\r\nthe reason that their refusal would probably endanger the whole\r\nconstitutional edifice of Germany. Next week will bring us a final\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 25, 1850._--Yesterday evening I went to a concert at\r\nCharlottenburg where hardly any one listened to the music, as all\r\npresent were preoccupied with the probable events of to-day. The\r\nparliamentary battle is opened this morning.\r\n\r\nI hear from a good source that M. de Persigny is secretly intimate\r\nwith a somewhat disreputable band of politicians, and that as he\r\ncannot find a welcome in any _salon_, he spends his time with a circle\r\nby no means suitable for one in his official position, either from\r\nill-temper or from boredom or from instinct. In this way he has been\r\ncarrying on a series of petty intrigues for some time. His proposals\r\nare being considered and he is given hopes of success; but no serious\r\nnegotiations are begun with an official and with a Government, neither\r\nof whom can be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 26, 1850._--Yesterday evening at a ball given by\r\nCount Arnim-Boitzenburg, the Meyendorffs told me that M. de Persigny\r\nhad paid them a long visit the evening before and had explained to\r\nthem his Bonapartist and Imperialist theories, asserting that they\r\nalone aroused popularity in France. By way of proof he concluded with\r\nthe statement that in the villages of France whole families could be\r\nfound on their knees before the picture of the Emperor Napoleon,\r\nasking for the return of the Empire. This is a most audacious\r\ninvention. He came up to me at this ball and asked after my daughter,\r\nsaying that he had had the honour of making her acquaintance at the\r\nhouse of M. de Falloux, with whom he asserts that he has been intimate\r\nfor the last eighteen years.[218]\r\n\r\n  [218] This statement was true.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 27, 1850._--Yesterday at eleven o'clock in the\r\nevening the debate upon the royal message was not concluded. There was\r\nevery prospect that Arnim's amendment would be adopted. He proposes to\r\npostpone for two years the law concerning the organisation of the\r\nChamber of Peers and to make this Chamber in any case composed solely\r\nof life members and not hereditary: this two-fold concession would\r\nmake the measure entirely illusory and would merely confirm the\r\nuncertain nature of the provisional arrangements. It is sad, serious,\r\nand fatal.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Minister Prokesch, after being snow-bound for six days,\r\nand the Prince of Leiningen, the brother of Queen Victoria, have\r\narrived from Vienna. The former is staying at Berlin and the latter\r\nproceeding to Frankfort-on-Main; both are delighted with the young\r\nEmperor. They say that if Prussia is not loved at Vienna, England is\r\nparticularly hated and France entirely disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe real leader of the Austrian army is the young Emperor, and his\r\nchief of the staff, General von Hess, is his clever instructor. All\r\nthe orders to the troops and all military measures proceed directly\r\nfrom the Emperor without any intervention or counter-signature on the\r\npart of the Ministry. This is a fact of some importance. Leiningen was\r\nalso greatly struck by the attitude of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg; he\r\nspoke of him as the firmest and even the boldest Minister to be found\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 28, 1850._--Arnim's amendment passed by a small\r\nmajority which it would not have had if fifteen Poles had not\r\nabstained from voting. The paragraph in the royal message referring to\r\nthe _fidei commissum_ was rejected because several deputies on the\r\nRight went away, as they were hungry and sleepy! This fact will show\r\nthe kind of parliamentary customs that prevail. The Ministry, who\r\nmerely wished to patch the matter up, has been satisfied, but is so no\r\nlonger. The King expresses himself as displeased, but I am afraid that\r\nhe will eventually swear to this deplorable Constitution, as soon as\r\nthe first Chamber sanctions the work of the second.\r\n\r\nSome one tells me from Paris that he has seen M. Guizot and found him\r\nin no way exasperated or disappointed, but calm and firm. In speaking\r\nof the feeling in the Assembly and in what is still called society, he\r\nsays that people are not sufficiently uneasy, but too depressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 29, 1850._--A person who recently came from Vienna\r\ntold me that Prince Schwarzenberg was steadily pursuing a proposal for\r\na commercial treaty with the Italian States, to the great wrath of\r\nLord Palmerston. The Vienna Cabinet declares that as long as England\r\nentrusts her diplomacy to this Minister, it will disregard English\r\nrepresentations upon continental matters and go its own way. The chief\r\npoint of dissatisfaction at Vienna is the Pope with his weakness and\r\nvacillation; and Rome has thus become the most disquieting point in\r\nItaly. Here people are gloomy and uneasy, and their minds are occupied\r\nwith the numerous intrigues of recent days which produced the\r\nvote of the day before yesterday. A curious fact is that Count\r\nArnim-Boitzenburg now tells any one who will listen, that the famous\r\namendment is not his but was arranged by Radowitz and that he has\r\nmerely lent his name to it. The fifteen Polish deputies say that the\r\nreason they abstained from voting was because the Government has\r\npromised them unheard-of concessions for the Grand Duchy of Posen if\r\nthey refrained from voting on this very amendment which the Cabinet\r\ndeclared the evening before that it would never admit. Other deputies\r\nhave been persuaded by references to the wish and desires of the King.\r\nThe King declares that he has been misrepresented; in short, it is an\r\nabominable and disgraceful state of confusion. The Left are highly\r\ndelighted. This deplorable comedy is, in my opinion, the last stroke\r\nwhich will overthrow the tottering edifice; when no one has any\r\nconfidence in his neighbour, and when no one knows upon what to rely\r\nor where to find sincerity and firmness, people soon lose the courage\r\nof their opinions, remain as though paralysed, and even lose the\r\ninstinct of personal defence. Thus they slowly descend towards the\r\nabyss which yawns to receive its prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, January 31, 1850._--Yesterday there was a rumour that the\r\nKing would come to the town on Sunday and take the oath to the\r\nConstitution of 1850 in the great white room of the council where the\r\nDiet of 1847 sat. There will be stands for the spectators. I certainly\r\nshall not swell the number of the curious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 2, 1850._--If my uncle had lived he would have\r\nattained his ninety-sixth year to-day. God showed him great mercy in\r\ntaking him away before the beginning of this new phase of revolution,\r\nso profound, so destructive, and so final; a revolution which at his\r\ndeath had lasted fifty years, according to him. I think that we can\r\nnow see the end of it, so near are we to the bottom of the abyss, but\r\nI doubt if we shall have time to rise again to the upper air. The\r\nnewspapers yesterday mentioned February 6 as the day fixed for the\r\nKing to take his oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 4, 1850._--A reliable informant who has arrived from\r\nFrohsdorf says: \"There is at Frohsdorf a sincere desire for\r\nreconciliation and reunion, but not in France. The old Conservative\r\nparty, led by M. Guizot, are asking for union, and would obtain it,\r\nwere it not for the obstinacy of the pure Orléanists, who are\r\nrepresented by the members of the former Opposition. They include some\r\nvery influential men in their ranks, among others the Duc de Broglie.\r\nRecently, in a meeting of journalists, M. de Rémusat spoke very\r\nstrongly against the coalition, basing his arguments not upon any\r\ndynastic dislike, but upon the unpopularity of the nobles and the\r\npriests, who made legitimacy, according to him, hateful and deadly.\r\nThis is a fatal attitude to adopt. The divisions which are rising\r\ndeprive the Orléanist party of all strength, and every one seems to be\r\nplaying the game of Louis Bonaparte, or, what is worse, that of the\r\nRed Socialists.\" Another letter, also from a very reliable source,\r\nwhich I received yesterday from Paris, dated January 31, says: \"The\r\nFrench Government is much more reasonable than I had expected with\r\nreference to the communication which it has recently received\r\nconcerning the Swiss affair.[219] The matter will be decided _ad\r\nreferendum_. Probably no final attitude will be adopted on this point,\r\nbut no support whatever will be given to Switzerland, from whence the\r\nwind of Socialism blows over France, and also upon Germany and Italy.\r\nFinally, no engagement will be made with England, a point of primary\r\nimportance. In the Assembly, the side of the Montagne is about to\r\ncreate a stir; possibly there will be an armed demonstration at Lyons\r\nunder the influence of the Socialists, who are there numerous; no\r\napprehension in consequence is felt here, and perhaps even no\r\nresentment will be shown. At London they will be furious. Ellice, as\r\nhe left here yesterday, said that Lord Palmerston was going to do all\r\nthe mischief he could. Ellice, Whig as he is, seemed very uneasy on\r\naccount of the bad disposition of his friend of Downing Street.\"\r\n\r\n  [219] At the time of the violent reaction which proceeded after\r\n  1849 in several European States, following the suppression of the\r\n  revolutionary movement, thousands of proscribed Germans,\r\n  Italians, and French, took refuge in Swiss territory. Their\r\n  presence provided certain governments with a pretext for\r\n  presenting claims to the Federal Government, which produced\r\n  diplomatic difficulties.\r\n\r\nAs I have thus begun to repeat political gossip, I may also say that a\r\nprompt resumption of hostilities over the Danish affair is expected.\r\nThe people of Schleswig are allowed to arm themselves and make\r\npreparations, and before long there will be a general rising which may\r\nhave serious consequences. Negotiations do not advance. The haughty\r\nlanguage of Radowitz upon questions affecting Germany daily adds fuel\r\nto the fire, and so embitters the relations between the Courts of\r\nVienna and Berlin that one has more reason to expect war in the near\r\nfuture than the continuation of peace, although a conflict between the\r\ntwo great German Powers would be utter madness in the eyes of the most\r\nfar-sighted. The Emperor Nicholas has recently said that he thought an\r\nalmost universal war in Europe was inevitable next spring. It is said\r\nthat Austria proposes to promulgate a new tariff law, so widely framed\r\nas to produce great political advantages to itself, which will be a\r\ncrushing blow to Erfurt and will give Lord Palmerston an epileptic\r\nfit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 7, 1850._--Yesterday was a remarkable day in the\r\nannals of Prussia; the King took the oath to the new Constitution.\r\nThere were no stands, or spectators, or court officials present, and\r\nno princes or princesses. The King is said to have been greatly moved,\r\nand to have delivered a very touching speech which he had not\r\ncommunicated to his Ministers. He did not regard himself as a\r\nconstitutional monarch until he had taken the oath, and the speech was\r\nthe last echo of the old _régime_. The King and some of the Princes\r\ndined with the gentlemen of the Chamber and certain well-worn toasts\r\nwere given. All the Polish deputies have resigned in order to avoid\r\ntaking the oath; Count Hochberg-Fürstentein-Pless, a rich Silesian\r\nlord, has done the same. Twenty-six other Deputies stayed away under\r\npretext of illness. And such has been the day and the deed which is to\r\nlay the cornerstone of the new edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 12, 1850._--Herr von Meyendorff had a letter\r\nyesterday from Madame de Lieven. She says that the scene on the 4th at\r\nParis during the removal of the trees of liberty,[220] a foolish act\r\nof provocation on the part of the police, was enough to bring about a\r\nrevolt, armed intervention and the introduction of the Empire, of\r\nwhich the Elysée continually dreams, though Changarnier seems to have\r\npronounced against it.\r\n\r\n  [220] On February 4, numerous meetings took place to prevent the\r\n  proposal to overthrow the tree of liberty planted in the Rue du\r\n  Carré-Saint-Martin at Paris. It was necessary to send troops to\r\n  secure the performance of the order given by the prefect of\r\n  police. Some people were killed and wounded. General de\r\n  Lamoricière, who happened to be upon the spot, was in great\r\n  danger and was only saved by escaping through an attic window on\r\n  to the roof of a house, where some citizens had dragged him to\r\n  protect him from the fury of the people.\r\n\r\nI hear that Herr von Bernstorff, who was puffed up with Prussian\r\nhaughtiness two months ago, has changed his tone; that the despatches\r\nwhich he writes from Vienna are all inspired by great fear of war, and\r\nbeg people here to avoid it at any cost. Herr von Schleinitz is\r\ndisgusted, and is impatiently awaiting an opportunity to ask for the\r\npost at Vienna in exchange for the Ministry to which Bernstorff will\r\nprobably be called. Radowitz had promised Schönhals and Kübeck, the\r\nAustrian plenipotentiaries at Frankfort, to sign, in company with\r\nthem, the decree referring to Mecklenburg. However, he left Frankfort\r\nwithout performing this promise, and attempted to excuse himself upon\r\ndifferent pretexts. Schönhals then sent him word that if he did not\r\nsign within three days he himself and Kübeck would leave Frankfort,\r\nand that the last bond would be broken. Radowitz then hastily left\r\nErfurt to give the required signature; such, at least, is the story\r\nthat I heard yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 13, 1850._--Yesterday the King presented to the\r\nSecond Chamber a law authorising the borrowing of eighteen millions of\r\nthalers for military preparations. The Chamber considered the matter\r\nand appointed a commission. There is doubt that this authorisation\r\nwill be obtained. The First Chamber also made its nominations for\r\nErfurt yesterday; the choice fell upon the democrats. Herr von\r\nMeyendorff has no doubt that his Sovereign will regard Lord\r\nPalmerston's recent action as a further piece of impertinence, when he\r\naccepted the intervention of France in the affair with Greece[221] and\r\nignored the offers of Russia. England is asking for a new armistice\r\nbetween Denmark and Prussia, and as the armistice now in force was\r\nlargely disregarded by Prussia, who has decidedly encouraged and\r\nsupported the insurrection, the Danes are not inclined to fall into a\r\nnew trap. Prussia has not only failed to recall General von Bonin, but\r\nactually lent him to the insurgent government of Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nwhere he publicly wore his Prussian uniform. The Danish envoys here\r\ncan get no reply from the Government; Herr von Usedom will not see\r\nthem and negotiates only with their adversaries.\r\n\r\n  [221] The case of Pacifico had then reached its most critical\r\n  point. This Portuguese Jew, who was under Prussian protection,\r\n  claimed a considerable sum from the Greek Government in\r\n  compensation for the pillage of a house on April 4, 1847, during\r\n  a demonstration in the streets of Athens, at the time of a\r\n  procession. The sum also included compensation for personal\r\n  outrage. In order to obtain this indemnity Lord Palmerston\r\n  blockaded the ports and coasts of Greece in 1850; on the\r\n  intervention of France and the payment of the sum in question the\r\n  blockade was raised. The French ambassador at London, M. Drouyn\r\n  de Lhuys, left England, and this trivial incident nearly led to a\r\n  general war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 14, 1850._--I admit that every Government has its\r\ndifficulties, and that the number and diversity of the complications\r\nshould be guarantees against violent means of settling them. In a\r\nword, I agree that if war should break out it will be the most\r\nirrefutable symptom of madness upon one side, of weakness upon the\r\nother, and of bewilderment in general; but unfortunately these\r\naberrations are contagious and make such progress before my eyes that\r\nany one who, like myself, can observe all the inventions of bad faith\r\nand haughtiness, speedily grows anxious for the future. If we can get\r\nthrough April and May without the sound of the cannon I think that\r\npeace might last between the great powers, at any rate for a year or\r\ntwo; this would give people time to breathe, to turn round and to get\r\ntheir affairs in order; but I am sadly afraid that between this date\r\nand May 15 at the latest we shall once more be in the midst of a\r\nconflagration. My own opinion is that the latter part of the month of\r\nApril will definitely settle the possibility of war or peace. At the\r\npresent everything points to a general conflagration in the near\r\nfuture. Lord Palmerston is doing his best to promote it, and M. de\r\nPersigny, with his eyes upon the right bank of the Rhine, is also\r\nworking vigorously. Here, with marvellous stupidity, people run into\r\nevery snare and take a delight in alienating their natural allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 23, 1850._--I spent the evening with the\r\nMeyendorffs, the house where the most authentic news is oftenest to be\r\nobtained. Yesterday's news was more peaceful. Two incidents serve to\r\ncalm in some degree the warlike ideas in progress here: in the first\r\nplace an individual has returned who has been sent to inquire into the\r\nmilitary preparations in Bohemia, in the existence of which there was\r\ngeneral disbelief. His report has fully confirmed the rumours. Then M.\r\nde Persigny has made an inconceivable blunder. Feeling hurt because\r\novertures were made directly to Paris through Hatzfeldt on the Swiss\r\nquestion, he took umbrage and picked a quarrel with Count Brandenburg\r\na few days ago. He said that France would not permit the employment of\r\ncoercive measures against Switzerland, and that an opportunity of\r\ncrossing the Rhine with two hundred thousand Frenchmen and of fighting\r\nin Germany would be all to the advantage of the President. In short,\r\nhe showed his teeth so clearly as to give rise to subsequent\r\nreflections which might have been made a little earlier. Whether these\r\nreflections will be sufficiently strong to induce a more prudent\r\nattitude I cannot say. Persigny is completely done for: he came here\r\nwith proposals of peace and will probably go with the threat of which\r\nI have spoken; his policy shows neither intention nor consistency. The\r\nnewspapers represent French domestic affairs as growing worse day by\r\nday, and the attitude of her representative here is therefore more\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, February 24, 1850._--To-day is a serious and very tragical\r\ndate: it marks the downfall of what was called modern society, and\r\nvery falsely called civilised society, as experience has shown.\r\n\r\nA letter from Madame de Lieven received here yesterday predicts\r\nfurther catastrophes in France in the near future; the result in her\r\nopinion will be a temporary military dictatorship in the hands of\r\nChangarnier.\r\n\r\nThe King of Hanover has written a letter which I have seen. He says\r\nthat he has spent some very disagreeable days and that he had a crow\r\nto pick with his Ministers, and had much trouble in converting them to\r\nhis opinion. However, he has succeeded and has broken the last tie of\r\nconnection with Berlin to begin closer relations with Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, February 26, 1850._--I arrived here yesterday afternoon. In\r\nthe train I met Herr von Benningsen, the Hanoverian Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, who was going to Vienna for forty-eight hours to gain\r\ninformation, and was then to return at full speed to his Sovereign's\r\nside. This visit will doubtless cause much displeasure at Berlin.[222]\r\n\r\n  [222] Benningsen had been sent to Vienna to conciliate federal\r\n  and individual instincts by a proposed Constitution which the\r\n  four kingdoms of Bavaria, Saxony, Würtemberg, and Hanover were\r\n  thought to have devised in concert with Austria. The attempt\r\n  proved a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, February 28, 1850._--Count Stirum passed here yesterday on his\r\nway from Berlin, and told me that the Electorate of Hesse had\r\ndefinitely and officially broken with Prussia. I hear that the King of\r\nHanover has officially announced to the Prussian Government his\r\nsecession from the Prussian _Bund_, but that he has been obliged to\r\nyield to his Ministers, who absolutely decline any alliance with\r\nAustria, because Austria is in favour of a Single Chamber, while the\r\nHanoverian Ministers want two. I suppose that Herr von Benningsen went\r\nto Vienna to make all these explanations. The poor King of Hanover is\r\ntherefore completely isolated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 1, 1850._--We are entering upon a month that has been\r\nnotorious and fatal in the annals both of ancient and modern history.\r\nHeaven alone knows what kind of Ides it has in store for us at this\r\npoint of the half-century. Dates and anniversaries inspire terror, and\r\nI feel that we are standing upon ground that is undermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 6, 1850._--Yesterday I had some letters from Paris. On\r\nthe 2nd of this month Paris was in much perplexity concerning the\r\napproach of the elections, and news from the provinces caused some\r\nanxiety; the Red Party was rising once more. Social pleasure and the\r\nfollies of dress are not checked in consequence, and are, indeed,\r\ncarried to an appalling degree. The Grand Duchess Stephanie has been\r\nreceived by the President with the greatest honour; he gave her an\r\nestablishment apart from his own, in order that her movements might be\r\nquite free, and summoned the Diplomatic Body in uniform to be\r\nintroduced to her. She received the introductions seated in a chair of\r\nstate, which was a strange sight at the house of the President of the\r\nRepublic, and provoked some caustic remarks. She is to spend a month\r\nat the Elysée, and will then live with her daughter, Lady Douglas, who\r\nwill arrive at Paris in a few weeks. As the Grand Duchess was ready to\r\nreceive people of every shade of opinion while she was at Baden, many\r\npeople who do not visit the President have asked permisssion to call.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 7, 1850._--Letters truly alarming have reached me from\r\nParis. Those who see everything in a favourable light flatter\r\nthemselves that there will be a change in the English Cabinet, and\r\nthat this will produce an immediate effect at the Elysée, where Lord\r\nNormanby's influence is more powerful than ever on questions of\r\ndomestic as well as foreign policy. His advice is far from excellent,\r\nand is usually given in the evening at the house of the President's\r\nmistress, amid the petty amusements which fill the Presidential hours\r\nof leisure. On the Swiss question Lord Palmerston will again direct\r\nthe President's action; his instincts are warlike, whereas those of\r\nhis Ministers are pacific; but the Ministers have no authority over\r\nPrince Louis or over the Assembly, which distrusts them and distrusts\r\nthe President yet more. The President's attitude, again, upon the\r\nGreek question is even more Palmerstonian than upon the Swiss\r\nquestion; in a word, every problem which arises in Europe, whether\r\ninvolving a conflict or mere rivalry, will be treated with\r\ninconsistency and certainly concluded in confusion. France is also\r\ngreatly distracted. I am told that the President has definitely\r\ndecided to grasp the first opportunity of breaking with the Assembly\r\nand of crushing it. In short, his 18th of Brumaire and his Imperial\r\ncloak have been prepared; he is waiting his opportunity, champing the\r\nbit meanwhile. Probably his struggle against the Reds will give him an\r\nopening, and he believes that the public danger will secure him the\r\npublic support. All eyes are turned upon Changarnier, who is the great\r\npuzzle of the moment; no one can divine his intentions, and he\r\nmaintains so impenetrable a reserve as to lead observers to infer that\r\nhe thinks himself master of the situation; there is, in fact, no doubt\r\nthat he will check the _coup d'état_, but in the excitement of civil\r\nwar some popular movement might be begun which would sweep away even\r\nChangarnier himself. Everything will thus depend upon the extent of\r\nthis struggle and of popular excitement. Will the Reds fight? People\r\nseem inclined to think that they will, and the outbreak is even\r\nexpected this month, while the news from the provinces is most\r\nserious. The provinces threaten to overthrow Paris, and to deprive her\r\nof the long power of initiative which she has exercised upon politics\r\nand revolutions. It is certain that the President is not the man to\r\nmeet this decisive crisis; for the last six months he has sunk in the\r\nopinion of all reasonable people; he is surrounded by advisers of the\r\nworst possible colour, imbued with absurd and dangerous ideas. But in\r\nspite of all this and even more, the conclusion seems inevitable that\r\nthere is no one at present to take his place, and that he must be\r\nendured as he is. Obviously France could only be saved by a military\r\ndictator who would overthrow universal suffrage, the Press, the jury,\r\nthe National Guard--in short, everything that poisons France and\r\ninfects Europe with its contagious miasma. If the Comte de Chambord or\r\nthe Comte de Paris were to return to France to-morrow, I doubt if they\r\ncould do what is necessary; such action seems only within the\r\ncompetence of an exceptional and irregular power. Hence the wish for a\r\nmilitary dictatorship with full power, which, when the present crisis\r\nis over, would return the regular power to the hands of a Government\r\nsanctioned by tradition. But is this the view of God's providence, or\r\nis the old world to fall asunder in blood? Will ferocious hordes\r\nquarrel over our remains? Who can say?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 11, 1850._--I hear from Berlin that M. de Persigny\r\nthinks that he has done an excellent stroke of business by inveighing\r\nagainst Prussia before the Austrian Minister, to whom he said that two\r\nthousand Frenchmen would soon make an end of the propensities of\r\nNeuchâtel. Thereupon Prokesch, who is a somewhat rough and violent\r\ncharacter, turned white with rage, and trembling with fury, told the\r\nlittle favourite that he would endure no such language at his own\r\nhouse, and that in spite of the coolness between the Courts of Vienna\r\nand Berlin, he would assure M. de Persigny that when the first French\r\nsoldier had crossed the Rhine in hostility to Prussia, the whole of\r\nthe Austrian forces would come and help their old ally to stem the\r\nrevolutionary flood. On this vigorous outburst the little man beat a\r\nhasty retreat. He is said to have begun intrigues with the Prussian\r\ndemagogue party, feeling that he has not sufficient influence over the\r\nBrandenburg Cabinet. The latter body, unfortunately, is a perfect\r\nweathercock, continually doing and undoing, beginning and abandoning,\r\nadvancing and retiring with the most deplorable ineptitude that can be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 12, 1850._--The people of Schleswig say that if they are\r\nnot sent a million and a half of crowns they will attack the Danes\r\nalone on April 1. The Danes reply that if they are attacked they will\r\nimmediately seize all the German ships, and upon this occasion there\r\nwill be no question of restoration. Thereupon Rauch was sent to\r\nSchleswig with the most vigorous instructions to dismiss Bonin, and to\r\nrecall all the Prussian officers; but three hours later the Cabinet\r\nwas terrified by its own unusual display of energy, and sent fresh\r\ninstructions after Rauch by express messenger, so much milder in\r\npurport that no definite result can be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 14, 1850._--General von Rauch sent back his son to\r\nBerlin to ask for more definite instructions, as those which he bore\r\ncould not command obedience. However, the Minister of War[223] is\r\nafraid to send orders for the recall of the Prussian officers serving\r\nin Schleswig-Holstein, for the reason that a crowd of Poles are ready\r\nand waiting to take their places. This fact gives rise to a fear that\r\nthe scenes at Baden of last year may be repeated,[224] when it was\r\nnecessary for the Prussians to send a force into the provinces.\r\n\r\n  [223] Herr von Stockhausen.\r\n\r\n  [224] Serious disorders had broken out in the Grand Duchy of\r\n  Baden, where the Government of the Grand Duke Leopold I. had been\r\n  strongly opposed by the Liberals, and had been struggling against\r\n  unpopularity for years. This insurrection, which broke out in May\r\n  1849, was led by Mieroslawski. Leopold was obliged to leave\r\n  Carlsruhe and his States, and was unable to return to them for a\r\n  month, by which time the Prussians had intervened: their\r\n  occupation of the country continued until 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, March 21, 1850._--General von Rauch has returned from Holstein\r\nwithout securing any result. The people of Holstein are penniless, but\r\nthey propose to maintain their army by authorising pillage, and as the\r\nsaid army is composed of bandits, the prospects are cheerful.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Orléans is staying with her nephew Schwerin at\r\nLudwigslust.[225] This is a farewell visit. It is thought that the\r\nparting will be long, if not final, for the Princesse has sent for a\r\nlarge supply of jewels, boxes, pins, rings, bracelets, &c., from\r\nParis, which she is scattering round her family circle before starting\r\nfor England.\r\n\r\n  [225] In Mecklenburg.\r\n\r\nM. de Persigny apparently thinks himself more remote from the pleasant\r\nlittle combat to which he looked forward at Paris, for it has been\r\nnoticed for several days that he is less cheerful and boastful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 9, 1850._--Herr von Meyendorff writes from Berlin: \"The\r\npolicy of Radowitz and Bodelschwing which was rejected by the majority\r\nin the Council of the Ministers, has entered upon a new phase, and it\r\nis now a question of cutting down to the size of a dwarf the coat\r\nwhich was originally cut for a giant on May 29, 1849.[226] The idea of\r\na Constitution for the Empire has been abandoned and there is simply\r\nto be a union of States reduced to its most simple form, that is to\r\nsay maintained within the limits of Prussia's natural sphere of\r\ninfluence where common material interests prevail.\" The King was the\r\nfirst to start this new policy, and one of his chief supporters was\r\nGeneral Stockhausen: Prokesch thinks that the prospects of the\r\nGovernment have improved, in which case the improvement must be very\r\nobvious indeed. Bernstorff, however, who is always stiff and\r\nnarrow-minded, is unable to bring about the necessary understanding.\r\nAt Vienna there is no great feeling in favour of Prussia, so that\r\nheaven knows how much time will be wasted.\r\n\r\n  [226] An allusion to the union between Prussia, Hanover, and\r\n  Saxony, who had been ready to sign the Constitution in May 1849.\r\n  The proposal came to nothing, as Hanover refused her adherence at\r\n  the last moment under the influence of Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, April 23, 1850._--Lady Westmoreland arrived here yesterday\r\nwith her daughter. She brought no very encouraging political news: she\r\nexpects armed intervention on the part of Russia at a near date upon\r\nthe Danish question. A Russian fleet with troops ready for\r\ndisembarkation is preparing to watch the Duchies; whether Lord\r\nPalmerston will leave the glory or the trouble of the affair to Russia\r\nor whether he will decide to join her will be known in a few days.\r\n\r\nLady Westmoreland had a letter from the Queen of the Belgians saying\r\nthat her father was much tired and changed and had grown a good deal\r\nolder after a violent attack of influenza; she was proposing to make a\r\njourney to England to see him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 1, 1850._--The reply expected from London upon the Danish\r\nquestion reached Berlin on Saturday evening. The simultaneous and\r\nidentical proposals of Meyendorff and Westmoreland are fully approved\r\nand the latter is authorised to give vigorous expression to them, as\r\nindeed he is doing; but it seems that the strongest words have little\r\neffect and that acts will be required to change the attitude of the\r\nBerlin Cabinet. Reedtz and Pechlin, the two Danish plenipotentiaries,\r\nare at the end of their patience and complain of the snares that have\r\nbeen spread for them; all are growing bitter and exasperated and the\r\nmost clear-sighted believe that some violent outbreak is in near\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 3, 1850._--The Congress of Princes[227] which was to\r\nassemble at Gotha, is now to meet at Berlin on the 8th of this month;\r\nfor this reason the marriage of Princess Charlotte of Prussia with the\r\nPrince of Meiningen has been postponed to the 18th which will hardly\r\nplease her, for though young she is deeply in love and in a great\r\nhurry.[228] She is a charming person of whom I am very fond and who is\r\nvery fond of me, but I think that Meiningen is too small a theatre for\r\nher extreme energy, and that her future husband is too milk-and-watery\r\nto suit the electrical vivacity which she has inherited from her\r\nmother. This tendency has been restrained by an excellent education.\r\n\r\n  [227] This Congress had been convoked by Prussia upon the\r\n  dissolution of the alliance of the Three Kings, from which\r\n  Hanover and afterwards Saxony had withdrawn. The King of Prussia,\r\n  asserting his desire to work for the unity of the German nation\r\n  with all his power, convoked this Congress to oppose the\r\n  ambitious ideas of Austria. The Princes answered the appeal, and\r\n  the Congress was opened at Berlin on May 12.\r\n\r\n  [228] This marriage in fact took place at Berlin on May 18, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 7, 1850._--Humboldt tells me that as England has delegated\r\nall her powers to Russia upon the Danish question, and that as\r\nMeyendorff's language was threatening and very decided, Berlin has\r\nresolved upon pacific measures. Heaven grant that it may be so! He\r\nalso says that he does not think that the Congress of Princes at\r\nBerlin has been fully attended, and that in any case it will lead to\r\nno great result, and that the convocation of the old Diet at Frankfort\r\nby Austria daily becomes a more formidable danger.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chabannes writes telling me that she is very displeased with\r\nthe Orléanist party, even more than with the party that is opposed to\r\nit. She says that the most acceptable proposals are forthcoming from\r\nthe Comte de Chambord; that the young Orléanist princes are all in\r\nfavour of a family compact; that Louis Philippe, who has grown much\r\nweaker, is vacillating; that the Queen of the Belgians, under English\r\ninfluence, is hostile; and that the Duchesse d'Orléans, who receives\r\nbut incomplete information from Paris, will give no definite reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 8, 1850._--Lady Westmoreland writes to me from Berlin\r\nunder yesterday's date: \"The castle at Berlin is being prepared for\r\nthe stay of the princes invited to the Congress; it has been possible\r\nto arrange seventeen separate sets of rooms; if these should prove\r\ninadequate, the extra princes will be lodged in private houses at the\r\nKing's expense, but probably not so many as seventeen will come;\r\nhitherto the only certainties are the Duke of Coburg, the Duke of\r\nBrunswick, the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, the Grand Duke of Baden, and\r\nthe two Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg. As for the Elector of\r\nHesse-Cassel, he has sent word that he will come and explain to the\r\nKing in person why he could enter the restricted union. General von\r\nBülow is starting for Copenhagen to-day; he is commissioned to treat\r\nfor a separate peace between Prussia and Denmark, and not to touch the\r\nquestions of the Duchies, or Germany, or mediation; when I say 'treat\r\nfor' peace, I mean that he should make proposals to this end, as the\r\nnegotiations are to be carried on here. It has been decided to send a\r\nplenipotentiary to Frankfort, and it is supposed that Herr von\r\nManteuffel, the Minister of the Interior, will go. The important\r\nquestion is whether he will appear as the Russian plenipotentiary or\r\nas representing the restricted union by himself; in the former case\r\nthere will be a great retreat on the part of Prussia, and in the\r\nlatter, Austria will decline to join.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 12, 1850._--Yesterday I had a letter from Berlin of which\r\nthe following is an extract: \"You will see the list of the princes who\r\nhave arrived, as it is in the _Gazette_. They are all here except\r\nNassau and Hesse-Darmstadt, but it is not to be supposed that they are\r\nall agreed. The Duke of Coburg wished to have a preliminary\r\nconference in his own rooms with the other princes before to-day's\r\nsession at the Castle, whither they were invited by the King to hear a\r\nspeech and afterwards to dine. The Duke of Coburg was astonished and\r\nvexed to find that every prince has his own way of regarding the\r\nquestion, and that they will not submit to his proposals.\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz, Hesse and Oldenburg declared themselves entirely\r\nopposed to the Prussian tactics, and the Duke of Brunswick, though\r\nfavourable to the _Bund_,[229] has views of his own upon the subject,\r\nwhich are not those of Coburg. Manteuffel is not going to Frankfort,\r\nand this question remains unsettled.\"\r\n\r\n  [229] The _Bund_ was the alliance of all the German Sovereigns\r\n  against a foreign enemy. It lasted until the war of 1866.\r\n\r\nM. de Persigny, who has returned from Paris, declares that all parties\r\nhave gathered to the support of the President, that they propose to\r\ntake the most energetic measures, and that all danger is passed.\r\nProkesch has been appointed to Constantinople; it is said that his\r\nplace here will be taken by General Thun.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 13, 1850._--I have received two letters from Berlin, one\r\nin German; the following is an extract from it: \"The Congress of\r\nPrinces is proceeding admirably; little business is done, but there is\r\nplenty of occupation. Military displays are unending, and are varied\r\nby monster dinners, while in the evening there is the opera, _The\r\nProphète_, parties, and balls. To-day a reception is given by\r\nMeyendorff, to-morrow by Redern, on Monday by the Prince and Princess\r\nof Prussia, on Tuesday by the Westmorelands, on Wednesday by their\r\nMajesties; and then, thank heaven, the conference is closed. The\r\nPrincess Regent of Waldeck arrived here on Thursday for the great\r\ndinner in the White Hall, which was a fresh cause of joy to the\r\nspectators. As Princess Regent she has been given precedence of all\r\nthe princes. The King shows extreme politeness towards his guests:\r\ninstead of giving his arm to the Queen and leading the way for the\r\nother princes, he took in the Princess of Waldeck and the Queen was\r\ntaken in by the Grand Duke of Baden. The Princess looks very well, is\r\nadmirably dressed in black on account of her widowhood; but\r\nunfortunately, in respect of loftiness of bearing, she in no way\r\nyields to General von Neumann and seems even to have borrowed some of\r\nhis ill-timed affability; I fear that this evening she is likely to\r\nbecome unduly lively at the Meyendorffs' reception, where the support\r\nof the Court will be lacking. The ladies will certainly forget the\r\nRegent, and will regard her only as a Princess of Waldeck. The Duke of\r\nBrunswick was not present at the dinner, as his claim of precedence\r\nover the Duke of Coburg was disputed. Yesterday dinners were given by\r\nPrince Charles and Prince Albert of Prussia, that the King and Queen\r\nmight have a breathing-space. In the evening the Opera Hall was\r\nmagnificent, and the large drawing-room which approaches the royal box\r\nwas beautifully decorated and illuminated; the boxes for the\r\nforeigners had been thrown into the royal box, and proved hardly large\r\nenough for the princes and their suites; the audience was so absorbed\r\nby the sight of them, that they turned their backs on _The Prophète_\r\nduring most of the performance and devoted their attention to the\r\nGerman Union; their interest was naturally increased by the appearance\r\nof the King in the large box, where he took the third place by the\r\nside of the Princess Regent of Waldeck. The Queen remained alone in\r\nher little box, where she was not even in full dress; after the first\r\nact the King took the Regent for a few minutes to see the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"The speech addressed to the Princes by the King is said to have been\r\nmost dignified. He begged them to consider whether they could follow\r\nin loyalty and faithfulness the path which he had taken, adding that\r\nif they were of a different opinion, they need only follow another\r\nroad and diverge from himself, in which case he would feel no\r\nvindictiveness; but if they preferred to follow him they must march\r\nloyally wherever he carried his flag. Yesterday evening in a session\r\nof the Ministers, differences, disputes and quarrels were only too\r\nobvious: the Administrative Council was present to listen; Hassenpflug\r\nimmediately protested against their presence, and eventually it was\r\nnecessary to close the session almost as soon as it had begun. The\r\nresult was an interchange of letters in anything but polite tone\r\nbetween Brandenburg and Hassenpflug, but no session; in short, the\r\nfirst attempt at a session made an end of the union.\"\r\n\r\nThe other letter is from Lady Westmoreland: \"The Princes met in\r\nprivate in the rooms of the Duke of Coburg, who is anxious to take the\r\nlead and would like to dominate the rest: offence has already been\r\ntaken in consequence, by the Duke of Brunswick in particular. The\r\nGrand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who is represented by his eldest\r\nson and the Elector of Hesse-Cassel, speaking for himself and for the\r\nGrand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, declared their inability to consent to\r\nany act which might bring about a Prussian Union, until the Frankfort\r\nAssembly had decided the great question which is there under\r\ndiscussion; all the other Princes declared themselves devoted to the\r\nUnion and to the Prussian policy; they were, however, far from\r\nunanimous among themselves, and while they made the same profession of\r\nfaith, every one wished to interpret it in a different manner; some\r\nwere anxious to attack the political question in the reply to be\r\npresented to the King's speech the next morning, but it was decided\r\nonly to send a polite and formal reply. Yesterday the Ministers of the\r\nPrinces held their first meeting and discussed their course of action.\r\nTo their great astonishment they saw Herr von Radowitz arrive with all\r\nthe members of the _Verwaltungsrat_.[230] Thereupon the Minister of\r\nHesse, who is violently opposed to all Prussian tactics, as you know,\r\nrose and declared that these gentlemen had no concern with the\r\ndiscussions of the Princes' Ministers who could not possibly continue\r\na frank discussion in the presence of men whose acts they would\r\nprobably have to criticise, and the acts of Herr von Radowitz more\r\nthan any others: he is then said to have declared that he was there to\r\nsupport the friends of the Union, and that were it not for him the\r\nPrussian Government would probably yield beneath the attacks of the\r\nhostile Princes; a fine compliment, you see, to Herr von Brandenburg\r\nand his Cabinet. The result was great confusion and an interruption of\r\nthe session before anything had been settled. Such has been the\r\nbeginning of the Congress. There were some interesting episodes: the\r\nDuke of Oldenburg and his son in particular are such enthusiastic\r\npartisans of Radowitz and Gagern, &c., that the father delivered some\r\nremarks before the meeting of the princes which were generally\r\nregarded as far too emphatic. The next day his son happened to be at\r\nthe house of Meyendorff and delivered so unseemly a tirade against\r\nAustria, that Meyendorff was forced to take him to task. The King saw\r\neach of the princes separately upon their arrival. He listened very\r\npatiently to everything that the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\r\nsaid to him and replied, to the great astonishment of the latter, that\r\nhe was quite of his opinion, especially with reference to the proposal\r\nthat nothing should be done until the result of the Frankfort Assembly\r\nwas known. I am afraid he may have told every prince that he shared\r\nhis opinions. In any case nothing will be decided by his opinion,\r\nwhatever that may be.\"\r\n\r\n  [230] Administrative Council of the Federal State.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 5, 1850._--Letters received give me details concerning\r\nClaremont, precisely coinciding with what I already knew: no overtures\r\nor suitable measures may be expected from a family which will never\r\npardon the elder branch for becoming its victim, when the younger\r\nbranch has usurped the rights of the legitimate orphan. As the elder\r\nbranch has no reason for self-reproach with regard to the Orléans\r\nfamily, it is much more conciliatory and more ready to hold out the\r\nhand than the other branch is to offer the little finger. Only great\r\nsouls or minds of a really high stamp can pardon those whom they have\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment at the Opera at Berlin seems to have been\r\nmagnificent, but at the supper, by some inconceivable carelessness,\r\nno one remembered M. de Persigny: in a fury he left the theatre-hall\r\nwhere the invitations had been sent round. The next day an\r\naide-de-camp was sent to him with apologies.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Prussia and the Duke of Wellington will be godfathers to\r\nQueen Victoria's last son,[231] who is to be called Arthur William\r\nPatrick, the last name being a compliment to Ireland.\r\n\r\n  [231] The Duke of Connaught born at Windsor on May 1, 1850.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the two Mecklenburgs, the two Hesses, the Grand Duke\r\nof Baden, and the three free towns have withdrawn from the Union. No\r\npositive statement has been issued, as the conference was still in\r\nprogress, but the rumour seemed highly probable. On this question the\r\nDuke of Coburg is in such a fury that he said he would like to\r\nstrangle the recalcitrants with his own hands. The question of the\r\npresence of Radowitz at the meetings has been settled by the King's\r\nformal desire that he might have a seat at the meetings _in order that\r\nhe could offer the assembled Princes the advantage of his talents_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 16, 1850._--A letter from Berlin dated yesterday says: \"At\r\na long conference yesterday the princes patched up some sort of a\r\nreconciliation and the refractory members consented to withdraw their\r\nproposals for leaving the Union, in view of the fact that they have\r\nall resolved to send their plenipotentiaries to Frankfort under\r\ncertain conditions; they have also decided to form a provisional\r\ngovernment for two months. The majority seem well pleased that they\r\nhave thus avoided a rupture which would have deprived the Union of so\r\nmany members. On the other hand Prokesch is furious and declares that\r\nAustria will never consent to the conditions of the princes. The\r\ncalmer spirits on the contrary believe that Austria would be well\r\nadvised to let them all go to Frankfort and not to force a dissolution\r\nwhich the nature of the situation will inevitably bring about. As the\r\nmission of the princes is thus practically finished, they will take\r\ntheir leave to-morrow and the next day, except the Duke of Meiningen\r\nwho is staying for his son's marriage. Sir Henry Wym, the English\r\nMinister at Copenhagen, has arrived for a consultation with Lord\r\nWestmoreland and Meyendorff concerning Danish affairs. I have no doubt\r\nthat a conclusion will be reached.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 23, 1850._--Herr von Meyendorff writes to me from Berlin\r\nunder date the day before yesterday: \"I have this morning received\r\nnews of an attack upon the King's life which was committed yesterday\r\nand full details of which you will see in all the newspapers,[232] but\r\nthe following is a curious fact which naturally will not appear in any\r\nnewspaper. The King said to some one present who repeated his words to\r\nme exactly, 'I was warned of this attempt; it is a plot which also\r\nthreatens other Sovereigns.'\"\r\n\r\n  [232] On May 22, 1850, Sefeloge, a retired artillery sergeant,\r\n  shot at the King as he was starting for Potsdam to spend the\r\n  summer there. The King was tripped up by one of his spurs, and as\r\n  he stumbled the bullet missed his head and merely grazed his\r\n  right arm between the wrist and the elbow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 25, 1850._--From a large number of letters which I have\r\nreceived from Berlin I can confidently infer, in spite of the\r\ninexplicable efforts which the Government has made hitherto to\r\nrepresent the assassin as a madman acting on his own initiative, that\r\nhe is simply an emissary from that frightful association of regicides,\r\nwhich has its headquarters at London, and which makes a business of\r\nprocuring wild fanatics who are given arms and known as \"the blind.\"\r\nThe Government had received warning of the attempt. There are said to\r\nbe five of these emissaries in Berlin. Meyendorff and Prokesch rushed\r\nto Herr von Brandenburg and Herr von Manteuffel, urging them to take\r\nadvantage of this providential miracle and of the warning which it\r\nprovides to close the clubs, adopt strict measures and terrorise the\r\nfaction meetings; but weakness and cowardice are at their height and\r\nthe Government think only of saving the criminal. Alarm is reasonably\r\nfelt in view of the possibility of similar incidents at Warsaw and\r\nVienna.[233]\r\n\r\n  [233] The Czar had then gone there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, May 29, 1850._--The King is better, though his arm causes him\r\nmuch pain, but that is said to be a sign of cure. The Queen is pale as\r\ndeath, gentle as an angel and courageous as a lion. It seems that the\r\nevidence which shows the assassin to have been affiliated to demagogue\r\nsocieties is so complete and so obvious that the theory of insanity\r\nhas been gradually abandoned, and that a more serious attempt is being\r\nmade to penetrate these bloodstained mysteries. The plot is growing\r\nclearer: the authorities think that they have more than one clue, but\r\nwe are not energetic, nor are we capable of seizing the right\r\nopportunity. It is God alone who can help us, for certainly we do not\r\nhelp ourselves.\r\n\r\n   The two correspondents then met at Baden-Baden and their\r\n   correspondence was interrupted until the month of August, when\r\n   they again separated. When the Duchesse returned from her journey\r\n   she had with her companion, Fräulein von Bodelschwing, a lady of\r\n   Courlande, who was most loyal to her, and remained with her until\r\n   her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stuttgart, August 4, 1850._--After leaving the platform of Carlsruhe\r\nI slept in my carriage as far as Pforzheim, though I sometimes opened\r\nan eye to admire the beautiful country in the intervals of sleep. I\r\narrived here at five o'clock amid fresh and smiling valleys. I drove\r\nin an open carriage to visit Schiller's monument which pleased me, and\r\nthrough the splendid park which adjoins the castle we then mounted to\r\nthe little palace of Rosenstein. The situation and the view are\r\nsplendid, but the palace is very poor. The pictures and statues are\r\nquite ordinary and the proportions insignificant. We returned by way\r\nof Canstadt and stopped at a mineral spring to taste the water, which\r\nI thought detestable. All this neighbourhood is very pretty and far\r\nsuperior, I think, to modest Carlsruhe. We were not allowed to see the\r\nWilhelma, a Moorish garden and palace built by the reigning King, but\r\nas we went along the outer wall I was able to catch glimpses of it\r\nwhich consoled me for my inability to cross the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ulm, August 5, 1850._--This morning, before leaving the capital of\r\nWürtemberg, I visited the chapter church which is interesting, as it\r\ncontains the tombs of the first Counts of Würtemberg. I then went to\r\nthe castle: the only part shown is that intended for receptions; we\r\nvisited the stables and the royal riding school where some Arab\r\nhorses, newly arrived from their native sand, were being broken in.\r\nThe heat was such that they might easily have thought themselves in\r\ntheir native climate. I was roasted by the time we reached the villa\r\nof the Prince Royal: it is not yet finished, but it will be delightful\r\nin the most beautiful renaissance style; it is admirably situated with\r\nsplendid views, but there is no shade, the garden is badly laid out,\r\nand the scene is one of despairing sterility. A messenger from the\r\nKing arrived bringing us written permission, for which we had not\r\nasked, to see the Wilhelma. We accordingly made our way there. There\r\nis a Moorish bath and hothouses for tropical plants which took my\r\nfancy. The garden is not entirely satisfactory. Generally speaking the\r\nStuttgart gardeners do not seem to me to be very clever. The railway\r\nthen took us through a fertile country well watered and wooded, full\r\nof ruins, churches and villages. Here we have come upon the\r\n_Sänger-Vereine_,[234] composed of thirteen hundred singers who\r\nblocked up the railway and the little winding streets of the old city\r\nof Ulm. We visited the cathedral which is very imposing, the town hall\r\nand the Gothic fountain, which are not without interest.\r\n\r\n  [234] The _Sänger-Vereine_ are two choral societies founded\r\n  centuries ago in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Augsburg, August 7, 1850._--I arrived here yesterday and saw nothing\r\nof the town except the part through which we passed. It seemed\r\nsomewhat curious by reason of its old character as an imperial town in\r\npast times. The bronze fountains are very beautiful: there are Roman\r\nremains, a prison and a chapel, the scene of the martyrdom of Saint\r\nAffre. The hotel in which I am staying, the Three Moors, is the oldest\r\nin the whole of Germany, and I am on historical ground. I have seen\r\nthe chapel in which Charles V. heard mass; the fireplace in which the\r\nrich weaver, Fugger, burnt the Imperial receipts, and in short\r\neverything that my head, which is swimming in the heat, can take in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Münich, August 8, 1850._--I arrived here yesterday in the afternoon.\r\nI have visited the church of Saint-Louis which reminds me of one of\r\nthe side chapels in St. Peter's at Rome. I spent the rest of the day\r\nvisiting the statues of Tilley and Wrede, the Street of Saint-Louis\r\nwith all its buildings, and the castle garden which is surrounded by\r\narcades painted in fresco. To-day at nine o'clock in the morning we\r\nstarted off and first went to the _Frauenkirche_ where we heard mass,\r\nthe sound of which came into my room, and was made irresistibly\r\nbeautiful by the organ with its fine harmonies. We then hastened to\r\nthe Leuchtenberg Gallery which is only open on special days at certain\r\nhours. I was attracted only by a very expressive portrait of\r\nPetrarch's Laura, painted by Bronzino; she is depicted half turning in\r\na severe widow's dress, with noble and slightly sharp features and\r\nspeaking eyes wide open and pure. I then saw an admirable picture by\r\nMurillo representing a monk kneeling before an angel who is conferring\r\nthe bishop's mitre upon him: this is a marvellous composition, both\r\nfor colouring and design, and as I have always had a great liking for\r\nMurillo, I was pleased by this further confirmation of my tastes. From\r\nthe Leuchtenberg Palace I then went to the Basilica and was struck by\r\nthe beauty of the frescoes, the richness of the marble and with the\r\nperfection both of the materials and of the workmanship. The Basilica\r\nhas not yet been consecrated. The convent which King Ludwig has built\r\nfor the Benedictines and which is joined to the Basilica by the crypt,\r\nis ready to receive the monks, but is not yet inhabited: the money has\r\nbeen all carried off by the wretched Lola Montes. As I came back I\r\nrevisited the Church of Saint-Louis with its fourteen beautiful\r\nStations of the Cross, each denoted by a fresco full of religious\r\nfeeling: the Stations of the Cross in the open air are quite to my\r\ntaste, and I greatly prefer them to those set up in the interior of\r\nchurches which form an unpleasant interruption to the lines of pillars\r\nand columns. I was delighted to find that certain churches here, the\r\nnew ones at least, have no chairs as in France and no pews as in\r\nPrussia. The Italian churches compel the congregation to kneel upon\r\nthe flags, a more humble and picturesque position and infinitely more\r\nfavourable to the architectural effect. Before coming in I saw the\r\nchurch of the Theatins, the parish church for the Court: its rococo\r\nstyle of architecture is so rich as to attain a certain beauty. The\r\nchurch of Saint Michael is very ugly and decorated or rather degraded\r\nby horribly tawdry ornaments; but the carved tomb of Prince Eugène of\r\nLeuchtenberg[235] by Thorwaldsen interested me. Thus, I think I did a\r\ngood day's work.\r\n\r\n  [235] This monument was erected in memory of Eugène Beauharnais,\r\n  who was made Duke of Leuchtenberg by King Ludwig of Bavaria, his\r\n  father-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Münich, August 10, 1850._--Yesterday I made further explorations\r\namong the curiosities of Münich: I visited the Treasury, the chief\r\nrooms in the castle, the Hall of the Beauties, who are not beauties at\r\nall and look as if they were taken from fashion plates; the fine\r\nstatues of Schwanthaler in the throne-room delighted me greatly. From\r\nthe castle I visited the Artists' Tavern: there they meet every\r\nevening and drink together and discuss art. The tavern has been\r\narranged in a special way recalling the fifteenth-century Guilds:\r\nevery artist has contributed some original decoration to the place\r\nwhich, though small in size is most original in appearance; the\r\ndrinking cups, with each member's name and arms, are neatly arranged\r\nupon brackets and shelves modelled and carved from their designs; on\r\nseveral objects the names of Cornelius, Kaulbach, Schwanthaler may be\r\nread; in fact the place is quite interesting. I also visited the\r\nporter and the tinsmith who make the beer jugs and vessels well known\r\nto Bavaria; the most original designs are to be seen, both graceful\r\nand grotesque. I also saw the chapel dedicated to All Saints which\r\nadjoins the castle, a handsome, noble building, slightly Oriental in\r\nstyle which seems to have been constructed and decorated on the model\r\nof St. Mark at Venice. We then drove outside the town to the\r\n_October-Wiese_, in the middle of which rises the great monument of\r\nBavaria, a colossal bronze statue by Schwanthaler, surrounded on three\r\nsides by a splendid marble colonnade, above which the statue towers\r\nfor thirty feet; the scaffolding has not yet been removed, but what I\r\ncould see is gigantic. As the weather was fine we went two leagues\r\nfurther in the direction of the Isar which flows down from the\r\nmountains to water the plain of Münich. A pretty wood led us to the\r\nfoot of a Gothic castle which Schwanthaler had just finished building\r\nwhen death provided him with a more impregnable defence.\r\n\r\nTo-day I have visited the Glyptothek, the library and the beautiful\r\npalace of the Wittelsbach,[236] the winter residence of King Ludwig\r\nand Queen Theresa which was only completed last winter. We propose\r\nalso to see the Pinacothek and the studio of Schwanthaler which his\r\ncousin carefully preserves and which is said to be interesting. This\r\nevening I shall see a fragment of Norma; and my visit to Münich will\r\nthen be over. My expectations have been surpassed, my curiosity\r\nsatisfied and my energies exhausted.\r\n\r\n  [236] The name of the Royal Family of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salzburg, August 16, 1850._--I arrived here the day before yesterday\r\nafter crossing a most beautiful and picturesque district in charming\r\nweather. I propose to plunge yet deeper into the mountains which shut\r\nin the town of Ischl. I have seen the cathedral, the Nonnenberg, with\r\nits old church and its noble convent, the fortress on its inaccessible\r\nrock, and the rooms which are being restored. I have visited Aigen\r\nwhere Cardinal Schwarzenberg is fond of retiring and which he left\r\nonly ten days ago with great regret. I have seen the castle of\r\nMirabelle and that of Heilbrunn, the beautiful and curious Anif, and\r\nfinally the very original cemetery of St. Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ischl, August 17, 1850._--I am not particularly delighted by my stay\r\nhere. The place upon my arrival seemed pretty enough while the air\r\nfrom the mountains which rise high and give excellent shelter on the\r\nnorth, must be delightful, but Ischl is full of people and,\r\nunfortunately, of people whom I know and who exact attention.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that a crowd of legitimists are going to Wiesbaden\r\nto see the Comte de Chambord, and among others M. de La Ferté,\r\nson-in-law of M. Molé, who is said to have been specially sent by the\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\nI have seen Louise Schönburg who is less uneasy on political subjects\r\nand readier to accord fair treatment to her brother, Felix\r\nSchwarzenberg. She fears, however, that the Minister Bach is a traitor\r\nwho is cutting the ground from beneath her brother's feet. This\r\nMinister Bach is the abomination, primarily of the Austrian lords, but\r\nalso of all landowners whatever their rank. Countess Schönburg, chief\r\nlady to the Duchess Sophia, came to bring me an invitation to dinner\r\nto-morrow with her Imperial Highness. As it is the Emperor's birthday\r\nthere will be a family dinner and I shall see them all, or nearly all\r\nof them, to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ischl, August 19, 1850._--I hear from Berlin that Potsdam has treated\r\nthe Duc de Bordeaux with the most flattering attention and the most\r\nmarked kindness, to the general and complete delight.[237] General\r\nHaynau and Mlle. Rachel have divided public attention:[238] the\r\nGeneral is envious of the place given to the actress, and it is said\r\nthat this rivalry has produced somewhat comical scenes; in any case\r\npeople are much more quickly weary of military vanity than of stage\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\n  [237] The Duc de Bordeaux passed through Berlin, where his\r\n  arrival caused much stir, on his way to Wiesbaden, where the\r\n  question of the coalition between the two branches of the House\r\n  of Bourbon was to be discussed. The King of Prussia, who was then\r\n  at Potsdam, received him with great distinction. The Prince\r\n  arrived on August 6 and stayed in the New Palace. He was\r\n  accompanied by the Duc de Levis, the Marquis de La Ferté, M.\r\n  Berryer, and by several other distinguished Frenchmen. During his\r\n  stay _Polyeucte_ was performed, and acted by Mlle. Rachel, who\r\n  was at Berlin.\r\n\r\n  [238] The Austrian General Haynau had become famous for his\r\n  severe repressive measures in Italy during the bombardment of\r\n  Peschiera and by his reprisals upon the inhabitants of Bergamo\r\n  and Ferrara, by the sack of Brescia and the massacre of the\r\n  insurgents. Afterwards, during the Hungarian war, he showed the\r\n  same severity in the executions carried out at Pesth and Arad in\r\n  October 1849; he was even said to have had women flogged. The\r\n  General was staying at Berlin at that time.\r\n\r\nAt dinner with the Archduchess yesterday I was the only stranger apart\r\nfrom the Royal Family and the officers on duty. The young Emperor\r\nlooks very handsome; his brother Max, my neighbour at table, is very\r\ntalkative, witty and agreeable. The old Archdukes are all very polite,\r\nand the Archduchess Sophia, as usual, is most pleasant and attractive.\r\nThe Emperor's health was drunk, a salvo of guns was fired and the\r\nmilitary band played the National Anthem which was immediately taken\r\nup by the people assembled under the windows. At night the summits of\r\nthe mountains and the town were illuminated with bonfires, with\r\ncharming effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ischl, August 21, 1850._--I have just come back from Aussee where the\r\nBinzer and Zedlitz families are settled in a most idyllic spot;\r\nbeautiful situation, fresh meadows, picturesque lake, luxuriant trees\r\nand a neat, simple and convenient house of rustic form. The mother and\r\nthe daughters superintend the small estate which the father cultivates\r\nhimself, while Zedlitz writes verses, and while the armies of Italy\r\nand Hungary send him addresses and pieces of gold plate. One son draws\r\nbeautifully and two of his friends carve and paint; they work at the\r\ndecoration of this pretty abode, on the walls of which graceful\r\nfrescoes represent the chief scenes from the poems of Zedlitz. In the\r\nevening young and old row about on the lake, singing Tyrolese and\r\nGerman ballads, French romances and Spanish boleros. Their residence\r\nis shut in by a valley, difficult to reach and rarely penetrated by\r\nechoes of the outer world. It is a dream, or better, a fiction within\r\nthe sphere of reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, August 23, 1850._--I arrived here two hours ago literally\r\nroasted and overwhelmed by twelve hours on board a steamboat in\r\nAfrican heat. The little boat was crammed, and though the banks of the\r\nDanube are sometimes picturesque and populous, I did not think them as\r\ninteresting as the Rhine between Mayence and Cologne.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, August 25, 1850._--The extent of human folly is\r\ninconceivable: the King of Denmark has now made a large addition to it\r\nby his ignoble morganatic marriage. Yesterday brought the news of his\r\nabdication.[239]\r\n\r\n  [239] Frederick VII., King of Denmark, married on August 7 a\r\n  milliner named Lola Bosmussen, called the Danish Lola, who was\r\n  made a Countess for the purpose. A rumour then spread from\r\n  Hamburg that the King had abdicated in favour of his natural\r\n  heir, the Duke of Oldenburg, in order to simplify the question of\r\n  succession, but this news was without foundation.\r\n\r\nI have a number of letters to-day from every direction. Madame de la\r\nRedorte writes from the Pyrenees where she seems to be mistaking\r\nboredom for depression, two very different things. Madame Mollien\r\nwrites from Claremont to say that she will soon return to France; she\r\nseems to think that Louis Philippe will not last much longer as he is\r\nat the end of his strength. There was a proposal to take him to\r\nRichmond, but the Duchesse d'Aumale has had a miscarriage which has\r\ndelayed their removal: apparently every member of the family is now\r\nasking what he is to do, what path he can pursue, or what policy he\r\ncan adopt upon the passing away of the old leader, who is said to have\r\nbecome as irritable in temper as he is weak in health. This is a sad\r\nend to a career of contrasts, on which history will probably pronounce\r\na severe judgment as a whole. The man who takes an orphan's place\r\nshould either be able to hold it, or should perish in defending it.\r\nQueen Marie Amélie is said to be more saintly, more resigned, more\r\ncourageous, and more admirable than ever.\r\n\r\nThere is little political talk here; even revolution has not destroyed\r\na certain frivolous habit of gossip which is not displeasing when it\r\nis not overdone. However, people are generally satisfied with the\r\nunusual vigour which the Dresden Cabinet has displayed for the last\r\nfew months: this is attributed to the Minister, Count Beust, who has\r\nadopted energetic measures and has expelled twenty malcontent\r\nprofessors from the university of Leipzig at one stroke.[240]\r\n\r\n  [240] Count Beust became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the\r\n  Dresden Cabinet in 1849, a post he had already held in 1841, and\r\n  at the same time became responsible for the Ministry of Public\r\n  Worship. He took an active part in the alliance of the Three\r\n  Kings and attempted, with the concurrence of Austria, to bring\r\n  about an alliance of the four Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nYesterday I visited the Lichtenstein palace, so fabulous for its\r\nmagnificence. At the same time whatever income may be forthcoming,\r\nto spend eighty thousand florins upon a single chandelier is\r\nunpardonable. However, there is more to admire than to criticise in\r\nthis fine work of modern luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vienna, August 31, 1850._--A rumour is in circulation here that King\r\nLouis Philippe is dead. I have not heard whether the news is authentic\r\nor not.[241] Vienna, notwithstanding recent catastrophes, has taken\r\nremarkably little part in political life, and the Prater, the theatre,\r\nand gossip are the dominant occupations now as formerly. I went to see\r\nthe church of St. Stefan again which always makes a great impression\r\nupon me. I also looked in at the graceful and remarkable church of\r\nMaria Steig, adjoining the Convent of the Ligurians who were driven\r\nout by the Revolution of 1848.\r\n\r\n  [241] King Louis Philippe died on August 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, September 5, 1850._--I have made an excursion by way of\r\nDornbach which belongs to Princess Lory Schwarzenberg, and through\r\nFelsberg and Eisgrub which belongs to the Lichtensteins. Princess Lory\r\nSchwarzenberg does the honours of her delightful villa most agreeably;\r\nthe site and the view are alike charming. Felsberg is a winter\r\nestablishment, shut in, warm, sheltered and rather gloomy; there is\r\nplenty of room, but the apartments are ill-proportioned and the garden\r\nis insignificant. There is a fine chapel, a pretty theatre room, many\r\nfamily portraits, and some old furniture of curious form and date. The\r\nmost striking part of the house is the rooms of Prince Eugène of Savoy\r\nwhich he occupied when he went hunting with his friend Prince\r\nLichtenstein. Eisgrub is a dainty, gay, and well-cared-for estate,\r\nwith a large park which adjoins the woods, in a country covered with\r\nlakes and full of every kind of game. The kennels, the stables, and\r\nthe riding-school are all arranged in English style.\r\n\r\nWe nearly had a serious accident on the railway: it was dark, and a\r\npeasant's horse escaped from his field and lay down across the rails;\r\nthe train passed over it at full speed and killed the animal; the\r\nconsequence was such a shock in our carriage that we were thrown from\r\none side to the other. The train was stopped and help was brought, but\r\nwe eventually came through without further disaster, apart from a\r\ngreat fright.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, September 12, 1850._--I am glad to hear that the newspaper\r\nreports were once more false which said that the Duchesse d'Orléans\r\nhad summoned Thiers to her.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers relate a terrible scene of demonstration against\r\nGeneral Haynau at London, which is hardly consistent with the much\r\nboasted hospitality of mighty Albion.[242]\r\n\r\n  [242] Popular feeling had been greatly aroused against General\r\n  Haynau, on account of the repressive methods which he had used in\r\n  the Italian and Hungarian wars in 1848 and 1849. In September\r\n  1850 he made a journey to London, and as he was visiting the\r\n  brewery of Barclay and Perkins the workmen hooted him, mobbed\r\n  him, tore out his moustaches, and threatened to throw him into\r\n  their barrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, September 16, 1850._--I have just received a letter from M. de\r\nSalvandy dated from the Hague on the 10th of the month. He says that\r\nhe is on his way from London to Frohsdorff to perform a mission. From\r\nhis letter I should think that he is a somewhat important figure in\r\nthe negotiations which he seems to have undertaken officiously and\r\nofficially; which is the more correct adverb I cannot discover from\r\nhis complicated account.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of the Belgians is dying.[243] Poor Queen Marie Amélie, she\r\nhas been indeed a _mater dolorosa_.\r\n\r\n  [243] Queen Louise died at Ostend on October 11, and was buried\r\n  on the 16th at the Church of Laeken.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, October 15, 1850._--The political horizon in Berlin has grown\r\nno clearer, but things have reached so critical a point that the\r\nclouds must necessarily disperse a few weeks hence, either under a ray\r\nof sunlight from Warsaw[244] or by the detonation of cannon. The\r\nmatter will be decided by the will of the autocrat. Herr von\r\nBrandenburg is going there to-morrow: he is taking his wife who was a\r\nfriend of the Empress in her youth, and has remained on intimate terms\r\never since; much reliance is here set upon female effusions and\r\nemotions to which the Emperor is very amenable. Prince Schwarzenberg\r\nis reaching Warsaw on the 20th, and the Austrian Emperor will be there\r\ntwo days later. The diplomatic body here is glad to see Radowitz at\r\nthe Ministry, as he seemed to be playing a yet more dangerous part\r\nbehind the scenes. It is thought that he will repudiate official\r\nresponsibility for his acts, and it is hoped that the report he will\r\nbe obliged to give the Chambers will make him timid. At any rate, we\r\nshall know much sooner and much more definitely upon what we can rely,\r\nand anything seems better than the state of suspense in which Germany\r\nis gradually being worn out in every direction.\r\n\r\n  [244] The struggle between Austria and Prussia had reached a\r\n  critical point and provided the Emperor Nicholas with the\r\n  opportunity of arbitrating between these two Powers, under\r\n  pretext of preventing war. He went to Warsaw and there summoned\r\n  conferences between the young Emperor of Austria and Prince\r\n  Schwarzenberg, the President of the Austrian Council and the\r\n  Count of Brandenburg representing Prussia. All eyes were turned\r\n  in this direction, and assurances were given that every question\r\n  which then disturbed Germany, the problems of Hesse, Schleswig,\r\n  and of Austrian or Prussian supremacy, would be decided. The\r\n  exasperation which the Count of Brandenburg experienced in\r\n  consequence of the concessions then made by Prussia, was believed\r\n  to be the cause of his death which occurred at the beginning of\r\n  November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 2, 1850._--Madame Mollien writes to say that the\r\nsainted Queen Marie Amélie said after her daughter's death, \"I have\r\nonly been placed in this world to send souls to God.\" She thinks\r\nnothing of herself, and disasters great or small do not affect her;\r\nshe thinks only of encouraging, consoling and strengthening those\r\nabout her. She is indeed a saint.\r\n\r\nHumboldt tells me that he saw Salvandy for a moment; he was delighted\r\nwith Frohsdorff and exasperated with Claremont.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, October 26, 1850._--As long as the Warsaw meeting continues no\r\ncorrect idea can be gained of the probable results. Brandenburg and\r\nPaskewitch have been received with great attention.\r\n\r\nGeneral Changarnier has been devoted to the Duchesse d'Orléans for a\r\nlong time, in my opinion. From the outset of her exile she took\r\nparticular pains to win him over by correspondence addressed to a\r\nthird person but intended for the General, who invariably read it. By\r\nthis means the Princesse succeeded in gaining his adherence, and he\r\nmay certainly be regarded as a pure Orléanist. The success of Salvandy\r\nat Claremont and Frohsdorff means nothing so long as the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans is in any way opposed to coalition; as long as she can rely\r\nupon Thiers, or thinks that she can count upon Changarnier, she will\r\nstand aloof, in spite of the fact that the death of the Queen of the\r\nBelgians has removed her chief supporter in that family. I have\r\nventured to send her a letter of condolence upon this loss; it affects\r\nher much more deeply than the loss of her father-in-law, for the\r\nlatter was of no importance to her; on the whole I am almost inclined\r\nto believe that Queen Marie Amélie herself is even more heartbroken by\r\nthe loss of her daughter than by the death of her husband, who must\r\nhave been a considerable source of perplexity on many occasions since\r\nFebruary 24, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 4, 1850._--Yesterday's newspapers announce an\r\nimportant event, the resignation of Radowitz, which was offered and\r\naccepted, after a long council following upon the conference at\r\nWarsaw: his retirement offers every prospect of peace, and may Heaven\r\ngrant that those prospects continue. If Radowitz, Bunsen, and the lame\r\nArnim had not been members of the King's council, many miseries and\r\ncalamities would have been avoided. I have always been afraid of\r\nBunsen, as his action in conjunction with Lord Palmerston can never be\r\nanything but mischievous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 6, 1850._--Here we have been lashed by a tempest\r\nwhich has threatened to overwhelm us for the last two days. At Berlin\r\ntempests of another sort have terrified every one. The retirement of\r\nRadowitz which, alas! I cannot yet regard as positive, the serious,\r\nand perhaps fatal illness of Brandenburg, the resignation of\r\nLadenberg, the appeal of Bernstorff, the ill-temper of the Prince of\r\nPrussia, the King's agitation, the general uneasiness, the meeting of\r\nthe Chambers on the 21st, and the continued military preparations both\r\nhere and in Austria are events quite sufficient to produce utter\r\ndespondency or feverish excitement in every mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 8, 1850._--We are passing through dark days. Just at\r\nthe time when Count Brandenburg had gained a hearing for his pacific\r\nviews he fell ill and died. Radowitz is certainly going to Erfurt, but\r\nLadenberg is returning to the council, and orders are published to\r\nmake every preparation for war. The Prussian railway of Kosel has\r\nreceived orders to carry no more Austrian troops from Cracow to\r\nTroppau. Bernstorff, who had been summoned to Berlin to take the place\r\nof Radowitz, has received orders not to come; and Erfurt is very near\r\nSans Souci! Dresden is delighted by the possibility of war, as it\r\nhopes to reconquer the parts of Saxony which were acquired by Prussia\r\nin 1814. Silesia will be the first province invaded by the Austrians\r\nor occupied by the Cossacks. Count Brandenburg died in consequence of\r\noverstrain during the last two years of the acrimonious scenes through\r\nwhich he had to live at Warsaw, of the very stormy discussion which\r\ntook place in the council on his return, and also of a chill which\r\nfollowed this hurricane. An important despatch came in during the\r\nnight and he got up to reply to it: he was immediately taken with a\r\nshivering fit and was carried off with a gastric fever complicated\r\nwith gout; he was bled and given an emetic most inadvisedly, so people\r\nsay. It is possible, but doctors seem to me to be nothing but the\r\nagents of Providence; they cure or kill according to the completion\r\nwhich the sick man's task has reached. This death deprives the King of\r\none of his most loyal and disinterested servants. The hand of Fate is\r\nobvious in all these events and produces general despondency and\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 11, 1850._--Every hour brings us nearer to a decision\r\nby bloodshed. We thought that peace was at hand and suddenly the army\r\nis mobilised. The Landwehr has been called out, to the great\r\ndisturbance of civil administration, agriculture, manufacture, and\r\nprivate life; several of my workmen, servants, and keepers have been\r\nobliged to go off; horses have been requisitioned and my stable has\r\njust been decimated. I hear from Berlin that war is not yet\r\ninevitable, but every hour makes it more probable, and for what\r\nreason, in Heaven's name? Because those who relied upon boasting and\r\ntrickery have at length been caught in their own snares. The end of\r\nthe week must see the final solution of the question. Heaven grant\r\nthat the wind of peace may blow in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 13, 1850._--The first collision between the Prussians\r\nand the Austro-Bavarians has already taken place near Fulda.[245] The\r\nofficial or Ministerial gazette _die_ _Deutsche Reform_, which\r\nappears twice daily at Berlin, brought me the news. It says that the\r\nPrussians were the first to fire; that the Austrians had not even\r\nloaded their guns, so that several were wounded and were unable to\r\ndefend themselves; that a misunderstanding was the cause of the\r\nconflict; and that after this skirmish the Prussian General, von\r\nGröben, fell back beyond Fulda. The account is preceded by a very\r\npacific leading article. Meanwhile it seems that Bernstorff has\r\nactually gone to Berlin, but only for the purpose of refusing the\r\nMinisterial post which had been offered to him. Confusion is thus\r\ncomplete. Since the trumpet-blast of war resounded, every one is\r\nabsorbed by the thoughts, the predictions, and the arrangements which\r\nso engrossing an occurrence naturally produces. However, I have\r\ndecided not to stir from here; I think it is bad policy to abandon\r\none's home in the hour of danger, and a course of action which is\r\nalmost always regretted.\r\n\r\n  [245] The Prussian and Austro-Bavarian troops had in fact come\r\n  into conflict on the road of Fulda, near the village of\r\n  Brounzell, and five Austrian soldiers had been wounded in this\r\n  outpost struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 15, 1850._--My brother-in-law came back yesterday\r\nfrom Berlin where he had left a state of peace. The King had visited\r\nthe Austrian Minister; a long explanation took place which began with\r\nsome temper and afterwards grew calm. Eventually they separated in\r\nmutual satisfaction. I can only pray that nothing but good may result\r\nfrom this explanation and that no further clouds will come to obscure\r\nthe horizon. Radowitz has so infuriated the Prince of Prussia that in\r\na council held upon the return of the Count of Brandenburg from Warsaw\r\nin which Radowitz preached peace, the Prince accused him of treachery\r\nto his country in no measured terms. The poor Count felt this reproach\r\nso deeply that it is generally thought to have been the cause of his\r\ndeath. The fact remains that in his delirium this scene was\r\ncontinually before his mind and caused him the greatest uneasiness. It\r\nreminds me of the quarrel between the Dauphin and Marshal Marmont at\r\nSaint-Cloud in the month of July 1830.\r\n\r\nAustria is willing to regard the attack near Fulda as due to chance\r\nand not as inspired by any premeditation. Both sides seem anxious to\r\npursue peace, and Austria is sensible enough to lend herself to\r\nanything that will shield Prussian pride during this forced retreat.\r\nThe Austrians have resolved to send twenty-five thousand men to\r\nSchleswig-Holstein to finish the difficulties there. The most\r\ntroublesome point between Vienna and Berlin is Hanover. Austria wishes\r\nthat Hanover should give free passage to her troops, while Berlin is\r\nanxious that Hanover should not grant this concession. I think this is\r\nthe only outstanding point which could throw us back into the anguish\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nI am very curious to know what impression Madame Swetchine has made\r\nupon you.[246] She is old and ugly but clever and well educated,\r\npleasant and insinuating, and entirely suited for the profession she\r\nhas followed for the last thirty years. I have been always surprised\r\nthat those who are religious by profession and who should always be\r\nconsidering their own consciences, should yet find so much time to\r\ndeal with the consciences of others.\r\n\r\n  [246] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 18, 1850._--For several days the chances have been in\r\nfavour of peace. Apparently the conferences which are to settle the\r\nfate of Germany will be begun at Dresden on December 1, and Russia\r\nundertakes the guarantee which Austria and Prussia simultaneously\r\nclaim, while the disarmament of the two Powers will go on\r\nsimultaneously, if agreed upon.[247] At the same time, we cannot\r\nabsolutely deny every possibility of war. The Democratic party, for\r\ninstance, which is fairly strong in the Chambers to be opened on the\r\n21st; the personal ambitions of those who do not belong to this party,\r\nbut who are foolish enough to think that if they join its shouts for\r\nwar they will be able to muzzle it afterwards; personal hatred,\r\nfoolish vanity, patriots with their silly love of glory and all that\r\nis most inappropriately termed the national honour, are influences now\r\nworking, and Manteuffel is obliged to maintain the struggle alone. He\r\nis accused of having already sold himself to Russia and to Austria!\r\nPerhaps the forces which France, according to the newspapers, is\r\nsending to the banks of the Rhine, will provide food for reflection.\r\n\r\n  [247] The conferences were held at Dresden in the greatest\r\n  secrecy and were prolonged throughout the winter. They ended in a\r\n  second Olmütz in May 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, November 29, 1850._--The Minister, Manteuffel, left Berlin\r\nyesterday to keep an appointment with Prince Schwarzenberg;[248] there\r\nis no reason to suppose that this interview will further the cause of\r\npeace. It is also said that the Chambers will be prorogued. Whatever\r\nsolution may be attained, every one must be prepared.\r\n\r\n  [248] This interview took place at Olmütz, not far from\r\n  Oldenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 1, 1850._--All the railways are crowded by troop\r\ntrains, and in spite of this military energy, which continues to\r\nincrease, people are still betting that peace will be secured. Baron\r\nManteuffel passed near here a few hours ago in a special train for\r\nBerlin; in this railway carriage our destinies are contained.[249]\r\nBaron von Meyendorff was present at the interview, and doubtless his\r\ninfluence was weighty and helped to turn the scale. I have also been\r\ntold that the Elector of Hesse is helping to simplify the matter by\r\ndeclaring that he has no wish for either Austrian or Prussian help,\r\nand is capable of reducing his subjects to obedience unaided.\r\n\r\n  [249] Herr von Manteuffel, who undertook temporarily the office\r\n  of Minister of Foreign Affairs on the death of Count Brandenburg,\r\n  secured a point of agreement between Austria and Prussia at\r\n  Olmütz by consenting to the re-establishment of the Germanic\r\n  Diet, by offering to support the abolition of the constitutional\r\n  rights of the electorate of Hesse, and by handing over\r\n  Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. This policy of peace at any price,\r\n  caused profound despondency in Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe castle court is full of waggons, carriages, and horses; the castle\r\nis full of officers of high rank, and the villages are full of\r\nsoldiers; everything is in a bustle; drums are beating, trumpets\r\nsounding, and yet the whole may be nothing more than a military parade\r\nat once ridiculous and burdensome.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 3, 1850._--Letters and newspapers from France have\r\nnot come in for several days; this delay is doubtless due to the\r\nmovements of the troops, which have delayed and disorganised both the\r\nregularity and the safety of the railways. Such irregularity in the\r\ndelivery of letters is a misfortune which I feel deeply at this\r\nmoment, which is a serious time for me in every respect, as my house\r\nhas just been the scene of a tragedy. One of the officers of high\r\nrank--a talented man, and much esteemed in the army, rich and\r\nrespected--has blown out his brains in consequence of some service\r\ndispute. He had dined with me a few hours previously, and gave no sign\r\nthat he had determined on the fatal act. He has left a letter in which\r\nhe explains his motives for this action, and the arrangements he\r\ndesires to be made. In it he thanks me for my kindly welcome, and\r\napologises for the act which he was proposing to commit under my\r\nhospitable roof. This event has affected us all deeply. The poor man\r\nhas just been buried amid the universal regret of the detachment; the\r\nfuneral was not carried out with military honours on account of the\r\nsuicide, but it was honoured by the tears of all those who had served\r\nwith and under the deceased man.\r\n\r\nTo-day we shall know how the Chambers have welcomed the arrangement\r\nwhich Manteuffel and Schwarzenberg have agreed upon; the matter must\r\nhave been discussed yesterday. A stormy and hostile feeling prevailed,\r\nand in any case the contest will have been keen. Herr von Ladenberg\r\nhad offered his resignation, as he declines peace at any price. If the\r\nChambers show themselves too intractable, will the authorities have\r\nthe courage to dissolve them, and exercise the rights of making peace\r\nand war which the Constitution guarantees to the King, or will they\r\nyield before the outcries of the democracy and their dupes who fill\r\nthe Prussian Chambers? That is the question. One might bet with equal\r\ncertainty upon either issue, so impossible is it to rely upon a\r\nconsistent or regular policy when definite resolutions are required.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Potsdam, dated November 30, from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract: \"Our excellent Sovereign has seemed greatly\r\ndepressed during the illness and the death of Count Brandenburg, the\r\nfall of Radowitz, the keen discussions with the Prince of Prussia, and\r\nthe determination to mobilise the army; but he has shown keen\r\nrepugnance for the Gerlach party,[250] and for Herr von Manteuffel,\r\nand great exasperation at the insulting threats of Russia to occupy\r\nthe eastern province as Hesse is occupied. Then, after a terrible\r\ninward struggle, the King has recovered his calm with reference to the\r\narrangements for peace, and has become almost affectionate towards\r\nHerr von Manteuffel; he has also resolved to send him with the Prince\r\nof Schwarzenberg. The King _hopes_ to preserve peace.\"\r\n\r\n  [250] Herr von Gerlach was one of the editors of the _New Gazette\r\n  of Prussia_, and the avowed chief of the so-called Kreuz party,\r\n  often known as Gerlach's party.\r\n\r\nI have also another letter which says: \"The Russian Court has\r\nofficially notified the other Courts of its strict neutrality in\r\npurely German affairs, though this does not apply to the Holstein\r\naffair. On this question the reserve is made that if any one Power\r\nshould claim to prevent the passage of Federal troops, Russia would\r\noppose such claim by force. The London and Paris Cabinets had\r\nrecognised the same right in the case of Denmark, and have undertaken\r\nto leave Russia a free hand. The King of Denmark asked the Emperor\r\nNicholas for twelve thousand men, and the Emperor replied that he\r\nwould send a hundred and twenty thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 5, 1850._--The following are some details which\r\nreached me from an authentic source: Baron Manteuffel arrived on\r\nThursday, November 28, at five o'clock in the evening, at Olmütz, and\r\nthe conference between himself and Prince Schwarzenberg immediately\r\nbegan and lasted till half-past twelve. The first interview led to no\r\nresult, and Manteuffel declared his intention of leaving the place an\r\nhour later by the night train; Prince Schwarzenberg made no offer to\r\ndetain him; on the contrary, he rang the bell and ordered the carriage\r\nto take the Baron back to the station; at that moment Herr von\r\nMeyendorff intervened, and begged the two diplomatic champions to make\r\ntrial of a second interview the next day. Schwarzenberg and Manteuffel\r\nconsented, and their conference was resumed the next morning at nine\r\no'clock and continued till five in the evening. The former had spoken\r\nin the course of the previous evening with such frankness concerning\r\nthe equivocal policy of Prussia, that Herr von Manteuffel was obliged\r\nto tell him that he could not listen to such language. During the\r\nsecond interview he showed more self-control and more readiness to\r\nmake concessions, and eventually the conference ended in the following\r\nresult: Prussia will occupy the military road in Hesse, but will allow\r\nthe Austrian troops to make use of it for the pacification of the\r\ncountry; Cassel is to have a garrison composed partly of Austrians and\r\npartly of Prussians; the domestic affairs of Hesse are to be arranged\r\nby two Commissioners appointed by Austria and Prussia; the question of\r\nSchleswig will also be discussed by two Commissioners, representing\r\neach of the great Powers; Denmark and Holland will be requested to\r\nreduce their military forces by two-thirds, and if it should be\r\nnecessary to bring up troops to secure this result, Austria declares\r\nherself indifferent upon the question as to which Power is to\r\nundertake the operation; in such an event she will allow Prussia to\r\ntake the matter in hand alone or to entrust the task to one of the\r\nother Powers in the Germanic Confederation. The general interests of\r\nGermany are to be discussed in the free conferences held at Dresden.\r\nPrince Schwarzenberg had given no clear explanation of the basis upon\r\nwhich he will regard these interests as established, but he has\r\nconsented that the Frankfort Diet should be suspended while the\r\nDresden conferences are in progress. Stipulations have also been made\r\nthat Prussia should set the example of disarmament, but that the\r\nmoment when disarmament is to be begun shall depend upon the will of\r\nthe King of Prussia. This latter article is, I think, kept strictly\r\nsecret. The King has shown great satisfaction with these results;\r\nhowever, he could not help saying aloud at table that Manteuffel had\r\nonly secured what Radowitz, the most German of all his Ministers, had\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nIn the Prussian Chambers discussion had been marked by strong and\r\nviolent feeling. The result has been an adjournment till January 3.\r\nEmbarrassment will arise in Parliament on the question of money. Will\r\nthe Chambers vote the money which has been expended in preparations\r\nnow found to be useless? It is thought that they will not. There is\r\ntalk of a direct appeal from the King to the Powers and to the\r\ngoodwill of his subjects. We shall see what effect will be produced\r\nupon the provinces and the country at large by the return of the\r\nDeputies to their homes during the month of adjournment. This period\r\nwill probably be spent in every kind of intrigue and in stirring\r\npublic feeling, and as such efforts can be complicated by representing\r\nthe pecuniary sacrifice as pure loss, very unpleasant incidents may be\r\nthe consequence. We are thus entering upon a new phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 9, 1850._--At the present moment all eyes are turned\r\nto Dresden. In five days the conferences are to be opened, and as\r\nthese poor provinces have been exhausted by the concentration of the\r\ntroops, it is of urgent importance that the disarmament should be\r\nquickly begun; they can no longer maintain the troops upon a war\r\nfooting, as they will be literally ruined by them if they are not\r\nturned into an enemy's country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 11, 1850._--Count Stolberg, the son of the former\r\nMinister, who is stationed at a neighbouring hamlet and has just\r\narrived from Berlin, came to dine here and spend the evening. He is\r\nwell informed of the course of events at Sans Souci. He has assured me\r\nthat the authorities have decided to carry matters to extremes with\r\nthe Chambers if they do not show themselves tractable upon their\r\nreturn. A dissolution will then take place, and as a more amenable\r\nChamber is not probable under the present detestable electoral law,\r\nthere is an idea of modifying this law by a _coup d'état_, or an\r\nattempt will be made to do without the Chambers by means of a\r\ntemporary dictatorship, or by an appeal to the people. I must confess\r\nthat I have great doubts whether the authorities have sufficient\r\ncourage to carry matters with so high a hand; at the same time, I\r\nmust admit that things have reached the stage at which we must either\r\npass under the pitiless yoke of the democracy or take the bull by the\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 18, 1850._--The Dresden conferences have been\r\nadjourned to the 23rd, and there is no idea of disarmament upon any\r\nserious scale until their decisions are known. The state of war\r\ncontinues with disastrous results. Those who complain are told that\r\neffective remonstrance can only be made under arms. However, to soothe\r\nthe feelings of Austria, the newspapers publish announcements that the\r\ndisarmament is beginning, which is only true to a very small extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, December 22, 1850._--I hear from Berlin that the Cabinet has\r\nbeen completed and strengthened with Conservative elements; a good\r\nsign, but I shall require twelve signs, like those of the Zodiac, to\r\ngive me any confidence in their consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, December 28, 1850._--News from Berlin is entirely peaceful.\r\nSchwarzenberg has been received with many marks of distinction, though\r\nthe troops are still kept under arms. The officers now say that the\r\nwar footing is continued in agreement with Russia and Austria in order\r\nto reduce the little recalcitrant States who look for French support.\r\nWe shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE RACHEL\r\n\r\nFrom _Sketches and Portraits_ by M. DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, Duc de\r\nDoudeauville, _vol. ii. p. 307 ff, edition of 1844_\r\n\r\nYou have asked me for your portrait, Rachel; do you really wish to\r\nknow yourself, or have you yielded only to the desires of Madame\r\nRécamier? In any case your request is a challenge, and I am too French\r\nto be able to decline it; but do not accuse me of foolish presumption\r\nor of cruel frankness. There is sadness and melancholy in the depths\r\nof your heart, but you prefer to delude yourself concerning its needs.\r\nYou might be the most accomplished and the most remarkable character\r\nof our age, or leave your true friends under a sense of profound\r\nregret; that choice is before you. The most exquisite polish of manner\r\nis as essential a part of your character as talent. Talent and\r\nyourself are inseparable, but in return for these superior powers,\r\nhave you any thought, any fervour, any gratitude to the Eternal who\r\nhas given them to you? It was impossible for a poor observer like\r\nmyself to meet you without studying you with extreme interest. I would\r\nhave laid aside my pen, but you order and I must obey and my pen will\r\nchronicle good and evil, perfections and deficiencies. I could wish\r\nyou were perfect, Rachel, in every respect, and that you would trample\r\nbeneath your pretty feet all that could stain your lofty nature. You\r\nare your own work and no one can boast of what is your success. The\r\ntrue and the beautiful have been your only masters. No one knows you\r\nwell, child as you are, thrown into the world without experience and\r\nfeeling everything with an intensity that is with difficulty\r\nrepressed. You are one of those chosen natures which sometimes come\r\ndown to earth by sudden transition; a creature of instinct that knows\r\nwithout learning and understands without study. You study little, but\r\nyou think deeply and feel more deeply. You have a power of energy and\r\nenthusiasm which sometimes frightens you: to great loftiness of mind\r\nyou add a charming lack of restraint which is sometimes not\r\nsufficiently repressed. You can dominate yourself, but you have not\r\nyet learnt how to conquer yourself. You have nothing to learn, for you\r\nhave understood the world as clearly as the theatre and are perfect\r\nupon either stage; but when you are tired of putting constraint upon\r\nyourself, you sometimes forget the spectators who observe you. Not\r\nwithout anxiety do your admirers see your heart and soul expand too\r\nfreely. For you the stage is a passion, and glory is your sole object.\r\nYour mind is unduly refined, your character vastly distinguished, and\r\nexquisite taste is native to you. Greater nobility and dignity cannot\r\nbe seen at the theatre than you display; you are more than an\r\nadmirable actor, you are the character in person as it is felt and\r\nimagined to be. You then rise to the full height of your fine talents,\r\nand your simple and expressive gestures are never exaggerated. Those\r\nwho criticise you unjustly should rather be astonished by the height\r\nof perfection and truth which you have been able to attain since the\r\noutset of your career, and should leave to your admirable instinct the\r\ntask of correcting the slight imperfections which are due to your\r\ninexperience of passion. Your soul is an abyss into which you fear to\r\ndescend: your head is aflame with feeling, your heart is a touchstone\r\nwhich tries every sentiment; you fear danger without attempting to\r\navoid it, and if excitement wears you out, it pleases you. Your\r\nbeliefs are restricted, and you take men only for what they are worth.\r\nYou are trustful but not blindly so, and you can be carried away\r\nwithout conviction. You can please, but can you love? It is to be\r\nfeared that those who feel only the passions of others, for that very\r\nreason never attain the passion that they so perfectly express, and\r\nwhich in the world as in the theatre lasts so short a time. Thus\r\nprivileged you might be sublime. Be not content to remain the most\r\nperfect actor that the stage and the world have ever produced.\r\nVexation stirs you, obstacles disgust you, and constraint wearies you,\r\nbut the trick of counterfeiting feeling has become so natural to you\r\nthat we rather divine than see your impressions. In your face, as in\r\nthe whole of your being, there is a delicacy and certainty of\r\nexpression full of charm. Greater daintiness of bearing, greater\r\ndistinction of manner, greater tact in conversation or greater\r\nsoundness of judgment, no one could possess: to invincible\r\nperseverance you add an iron will and are able to attack great\r\ndifficulties by force of character as well as by originality. Every\r\nnew part is for you the material for a triumph, of which you are happy\r\nwithout being proud, and your modesty justifies your success. When you\r\ncannot solve a problem, you outflank it with admirable skill; you are\r\na perfect improvisor, and though we never know what you will say, you\r\nalways say what should be said. An opinion of you formed in society\r\nfrom first impressions would quote you as the model of all women; but\r\nbe not content to become an admirable actress, become a perfect model\r\nin all respects. To restore the dignity of the theatre by showing that\r\npassions can be expressed but need not be felt, would be a true glory\r\nand one which you are worthy to claim. Insensible to vulgar sentiment,\r\nyou can appreciate deserved praise. You have an excellent judgment of\r\nthose who speak to you and can follow good advice. You read the minds\r\nof others with exquisite tact: flattery would leave you untouched but\r\npassion stirs you; sincere praise arouses in you the ambition to\r\ndeserve it, unjust criticism shocks you and you prefer to ignore it.\r\nLively, impressionable, and even imperious, you are nervous,\r\nchangeable and irascible under your outward calm, and rather\r\npassionate than capable of deep feeling. Your genius is as great as\r\nyour instinct and you will always remain yourself without attempting\r\nto imitate any one. Sublime is a great word, Rachel, and to deserve it\r\nyou must reach perfection. The term has been justly applied to you\r\nwhen you play certain parts in which you are inimitable. Desire that\r\nthat term should be applicable to your life, and if any obstacle\r\nshould check your path to sublimity, take breath and resume your\r\nprogress to the pinnacle of glory. Neglect no tendril of your crown as\r\na woman, and if it is your pleasure to collect wreaths of laurel,\r\ndisdain not the spray of lilies which contrasts with them so finely. I\r\nam no prophet and even less a flatterer, but of all those who have\r\nmet you, I am perhaps the one who has best understood your position,\r\nand my frankness is the irrevocable proof of my esteem. You will be\r\nastonished by these words and perhaps be angry, but you will feel no\r\ngrudge against me, for your mind is too great not to love the truth.\r\nBut you will think that I am not every one, and that is indeed a valid\r\nargument when I am confronted by you who resemble no one. Your genius\r\nis depicted on your expressive countenance, and to see you is to know\r\nyou, for those at least who can study you. Complete frankness is\r\ndifficult towards one who must be ever self-observant. Your look is\r\npiercing and attempts to read the depths of the heart, but if your\r\nwords are sweet your thoughts are often bitter. What might you be if\r\nyou had the courage to abandon all these delusions and to seek\r\nrealities? Ever the perfection of grace upon the stage, you are no\r\nless graceful in society, nor does any one appear there with greater\r\ncharm, distinction and simplicity. You are welcomed and noticed\r\nwherever you go; all seek your society, but you have too much pride\r\nand real dignity to desire a fleeting success. Your look sometimes\r\nexpresses madness, passion, extravagance and delirium, and when you\r\nfeel this, your eyelids droop and immediately restore the greatest\r\ncalm and sweetness to your face. You are a most exceptional person,\r\ndifficult to know and yet more difficult to explain. Too much severity\r\ntowards you would be an injustice; we may be afraid of the dangers\r\nwhich surround you, but your destiny alone can be blamed for them. Who\r\nelse in your place would have been what you are? And how many\r\nobstacles must you not have overcome to attain so fair a result?\r\nEverywhere around you are flatterers, admirers, courtiers, adorers,\r\nand no support, no real friend. How can you safely avoid these many\r\nrocks and reefs? If, however, you understand the high and noble\r\nmission to which you are called by the world and by your surprising\r\nsuccess, you will never be unequal to your task however difficult it\r\nmay appear. Talent is all that is usually asked from an artist, but\r\nmore is asked from you. We wish you to be worthy of your renown,\r\nworthy of yourself, and, in short, to be that which you must be to\r\njustify the esteem which you inspire. Such demands are entirely an\r\nhonour, for they show that you are appreciated. Remember that if you\r\ndo much for the world, the world has done much to support you against\r\nenvy, at the beginning of your career. Do not fall beneath its hopes\r\nand your destiny will be truly great, your life worthy of envy, and\r\nyou will hold the fairest place in the whole of dramatic history, for\r\nthe historian will be able to say: Rachel has shown that purity of\r\nheart and soul are the food of genius and the best source of real\r\ntalent. Yes, Rachel, it is my real belief that you will offer the\r\nworld that has adopted you nobility and generosity of conduct in\r\nreturn for its benefits. As you are endowed with so much energy, can\r\nyou lack energy in well-doing? No, for you portray virtue too\r\neloquently not to love it. At twenty years life is beginning and your\r\nlife must be unparalleled. Live, therefore, so that you can always\r\nmeet the severest eyes and never be like those debtors who do not pay\r\ntheir debts. Continue, in short, to be one of those brilliant\r\npersonages of whom our country is proud, but whom it has the right to\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_Note by M. DE BACOURT on the conversation of the COMTE D'ARTOIS and\r\nPRINCE TALLEYRAND._\r\n\r\n(_\"Memoirs of Prince Talleyrand,\" vol. i. Appendix to the first\r\npart._)\r\n\r\nWe wish to add to this passage[251] certain details which M. de\r\nTalleyrand had omitted or perhaps forgotten. It is certain that at the\r\ntime to which this passage refers[252] M. de Talleyrand had several\r\ninterviews with the Comte d'Artois in which he tried to convince the\r\nPrince of the necessity for vigorous measures; while supporting the\r\nconcessions which the King had already made, he urged the energetic\r\nrepression of the popular agitations which were of daily occurrence\r\nand had already stained the streets of the capital with blood. The\r\nmost important and the last of these interviews took place at Marly on\r\nthe night of the 16th and 17th of July, 1789, a few hours before the\r\nPrince left France. When M. de Talleyrand appeared at the house of the\r\nComte d'Artois the Prince was already in bed, but none the less urged\r\nhim to come in. The conversation lasted for more than two hours, and\r\nM. de Talleyrand again explained the dangers of the situation and\r\nbegged the Prince to communicate them to the King. The Comte d'Artois\r\nin much agitation rose and went to the King, and after a lengthy\r\nabsence he came back to tell M. de Talleyrand that nothing could be\r\ndone with the King, who had resolved to yield rather than to shed a\r\ndrop of blood by resisting the popular demonstrations. \"As for me,\"\r\nadded the Comte d'Artois, \"I have made up my mind that I shall leave\r\nFrance to-morrow morning.\" M. de Talleyrand vainly urged the Prince to\r\nabandon this resolution, pointing out the difficulties and dangers in\r\nwhich it might involve him and showing how it might prejudice his own\r\nrights and those of his children in the future. The Comte d'Artois\r\npersisted and M. de Talleyrand eventually said, \"Then, my Lord, it\r\nonly remains for each of us to think of his own interests, as the King\r\nand the Prince are deserting theirs and those of the monarchy.\"\r\n\"That,\" replied the Prince, \"is precisely what I should advise you to\r\ndo. Whatever may happen I shall never be able to blame you, and you\r\ncan always rely upon my friendship.\" The Comte d'Artois left the\r\ncountry the next day.\r\n\r\n  [251] An allusion to pages 123 and 124 of vol. i. of the _Memoirs\r\n  of Prince Talleyrand_ in which he referred to his interviews with\r\n  the Comte d'Artois, without giving details of them.\r\n\r\n  [252] June 1789, after the famous session of the 17th, when the\r\n  Third Estate had proclaimed itself to be the National Assembly;\r\n  M. de Talleyrand was at that time one of the clerical Deputies.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April 1814, M. de Talleyrand, who had become President\r\nof the Provisional Government, was able to tell the Comte d'Artois,\r\nwho was then at Nancy awaiting events, that Louis XVIII. had been\r\ncalled to the throne, and that the Prince had been invited to go to\r\nParis to take the post of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom. He\r\ncommissioned the Baron de Vitrolles with this message; when the Baron\r\nwas on the point of departure, while the Prince's despatch was being\r\nsealed, M. de Talleyrand walked about with him in the hall of his\r\nresidence in the Rue St. Florentin and told him the story of the\r\ninterview of July 16, 1789. He then said, \"Oblige me by asking the\r\nComte d'Artois if he remembers this little incident.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Vitrolles, after delivering this important message, asked the\r\nPrince M. de Talleyrand's question and received this reply: \"I\r\nremember the incident perfectly, and M. de Talleyrand's account is\r\nentirely correct.\"\r\n\r\nAs we were informed that M. de Vitrolles had related this anecdote to\r\nseveral people, we thought it our duty to appeal to his memory and his\r\nloyalty; to justify this expression of loyalty it must be said that\r\nafter the revolution of July 1830 M. de Vitrolles had broken off his\r\nrelations with M. de Talleyrand and had criticised his actions very\r\nseverely. Hence the tone of hostility and bitterness which is\r\nperceptible in the letter from M. de Vitrolles which we propose to\r\ninsert here; we think that this hostility will be nothing but a\r\nguarantee both for the reader and for ourselves, of the sincerity\r\nwith which M. de Vitrolles has made his declaration, and of the\r\nauthenticity of the passage in the _Memoirs of M. de Talleyrand_. The\r\nslight differences which will be noticed in the story as given by M.\r\nde Talleyrand and as it appears in the letter from M. de Vitrolles can\r\nbe naturally explained as the result of lapse of time which has\r\naffected the memories of the two narrators. The fact, however, remains\r\ncertain that M. de Talleyrand in July 1789 believed that the\r\nrevolutionary movement could be stopped, was strong enough to say what\r\nhe thought and bold enough to undertake the task of checking it. He is\r\nnot, perhaps, the only man who boasted of it later, but we think that\r\nwe have shown at least that he did not boast wrongly. The following is\r\nthe letter from M. de Vitrolles:\r\n\r\n   _THE BARON DE VITROLLES to M. DE BACOURT._\r\n\r\n    _Paris, April 6, 1852._\r\n\r\n   Sir,--As you have placed some value upon the testimony which I\r\n   can give with respect to a special incident in the life of M. de\r\n   Talleyrand, I think that I cannot better satisfy your wish than\r\n   by copying here what I wrote many years ago in a narrative of the\r\n   events of 1814.\r\n\r\n   \"When the Emperor of Russia and the Prince de Talleyrand had\r\n   realised that the presence of the King's brother invested with\r\n   power as a Lieutenant-General of the Realm became necessary, and\r\n   when I started to induce Monsieur to come to Paris, I had several\r\n   interviews on this subject with the President of the Provisional\r\n   Government (the Prince de Talleyrand). In the last conversation\r\n   at the moment of departure we discussed the forms and conditions\r\n   under which Monseigneur was to be received: after a moment's\r\n   silence the Prince de Talleyrand continued with his gentle smile\r\n   and in a tone which was intended to be careless and almost\r\n   indifferent:\r\n\r\n   \"'I beg you to ask the Comte d'Artois if he remembers the last\r\n   opportunity that I had of seeing him. It was in the month of July\r\n   1789, and the Court was at Marly. Three or four of my friends had\r\n   been startled like myself by the rapidity and violence of the\r\n   movement which was sweeping men's minds away, and we resolved to\r\n   inform King Louis XVI. of the real state of affairs of which the\r\n   Court and the Ministers seemed to be ignorant. We requested His\r\n   Majesty to be so kind as to receive us. We were anxious that this\r\n   audience should be kept secret in his interests as well as our\r\n   own. We were informed that the King had commissioned his brother,\r\n   the Comte d'Artois, to receive us, and an appointment was given\r\n   us at Marly in the residence which the Comte d'Artois occupied\r\n   alone. We arrived there at midnight.'\r\n\r\n   \"M. de Talleyrand told me the precise date and the names of the\r\n   friends who accompanied him; they were members of the National\r\n   Assembly and of that minority of nobles who had joined the Third\r\n   Estate, but I have forgotten both the date and the names.\r\n\r\n   \"'When we came before the Comte d'Artois,' continued M. de\r\n   Talleyrand, 'we told him with full frankness the state of affairs\r\n   and of the country as we saw it. We told him that it was a\r\n   delusion to suppose that the movement that had begun in men's\r\n   minds could be easily laid to rest. Procrastination, negotiation,\r\n   and a few concessions were not the means of averting the danger\r\n   which threatened France, the Throne, and the King. The true means\r\n   were a strong display of the royal authority wisely and prudently\r\n   exerted. We knew the ways and means, and our position allowed us\r\n   to undertake the task and to guarantee success, if the King's\r\n   confidence called us to act. The Comte d'Artois listened very\r\n   carefully and fully appreciated our representations, perhaps with\r\n   the idea that we were exaggerating the danger of the situation\r\n   and our own powers of improving it; but, as he told us, he had\r\n   been ordered by the King only to hear us and to bring to him the\r\n   information which we wished to impart; he could give us no answer\r\n   and had no power to pledge the King's will or word. At that point\r\n   we requested the Comte d'Artois to tell the King that if the step\r\n   we were taking in all good conscience and good faith was not\r\n   appreciated, if it had no consequence and led to no result,\r\n   Monseigneur must not be astonished if we followed the new current\r\n   of national progress, in impotence to stand against the torrent\r\n   which threatened to sweep everything away. Ask Monsieur, if you\r\n   please,' repeated M. de Talleyrand, 'if the conversation of that\r\n   night has remained in his memory; it was just before the time\r\n   when he left France.'\r\n\r\n   \"I admired the cleverness of the man who could find in one of\r\n   these recollections an explanation an excuse and almost a\r\n   justification for the whole of his revolutionary life. He would\r\n   have found many other similar excuses to justify different and\r\n   even contrary circumstances. When I heard this story, which was\r\n   related with a kind of indifference and childlike simplicity, I\r\n   ventured to doubt whether the recollections of Monsieur would be\r\n   in complete correspondence with the words I had just heard.\r\n   However, when I performed M. de Talleyrand's commission at Nancy,\r\n   Monseigneur told me without going into details that he had not\r\n   forgotten the incident and that my reminder of the circumstance\r\n   was in entire harmony with the truth.\"\r\n\r\n   I trust, Sir, that this testimony will fulfil your requirements.\r\n   I thank you for giving me this opportunity of presenting my\r\n   compliments, and I beg to remain,\r\n\r\n    Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    THE BARON DE VITROLLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL INDEX\r\n\r\n   [The names followed by an asterisk (*) are those which have been\r\n   already given with more details in the Biographical Index to vol.\r\n   I.; those followed by two asterisks (**) have been given in vol.\r\n   II.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n  ABERDEEN, Lord* (1784-1860).
